        "content": "Alright, I have this task to develop a Java program that reads JSON data from a RESTful API, parses it, and then stores it into a SQLite database. Sounds like a pretty standard data handling task, but I need to make sure I get all the parts right. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to read data from a RESTful API. I'm not sure which API to use for this example, but for the sake of this exercise, let's assume it's a public API that returns JSON data. I need to make an HTTP request to this API and retrieve the JSON response.\n\nIn Java, handling HTTP requests can be done using various libraries. The built-in `java.net.HttpURLConnection` can be used, but it's a bit verbose. There are also third-party libraries like Apache HttpClient or OkHttp that make this easier. For simplicity, I might consider using Java's built-in classes to keep dependencies minimal.\n\nOnce I have the JSON data, I need to parse it. Java has several libraries for parsing JSON, such as org.json, Gson, and Jackson. Each has its own strengths. Org.json is part of the standard library, so I can use it without adding external dependencies. Gson and Jackson are more feature-rich but would require including their jars in the project.\n\nAfter parsing the JSON, I need to store the data in a SQLite database. SQLite is a lightweight database that doesn't require a separate server process and stores the entire database in a single disk file. Java can interact with SQLite using the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API. I'll need to include the SQLite JDBC driver in my project to handle the database operations.\n\nSo, the overall steps are:\n\n1. Make an HTTP request to the RESTful API to retrieve JSON data.\n\n2. Parse the JSON data into Java objects.\n\n3. Connect to a SQLite database.\n\n4. Create necessary tables in the database if they don't exist.\n\n5. Insert the parsed data into the database.\n\n6. Handle any exceptions and ensure resources are properly closed.\n\nLet me think about each step in more detail.\n\n**Step 1: Making an HTTP request**\n\nI'll use `java.net.HttpURLConnection` to make a GET request to the API. I need to set the URL, open a connection, set the request method to GET, and then read the response.\n\nHere's a rough outline of the code:\n\n```java\n\nURL url = new URL(\"https://api.example.com/data\");\n\nHttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\n\nconnection.setRequestMethod(\"GET\");\n\nint responseCode = connection.getResponseCode();\n\nif (responseCode == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK) {\n\n    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream()));\n\n    String inputLine;\n\n    StringBuilder response = new StringBuilder();\n\n    while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {\n\n        response.append(inputLine);\n\n    }\n\n    in.close();\n\n    // JSON data is in response.toString()\n\n} else {\n\n    System.out.println(\"GET request not worked\");\n\n}\n\n```\n\n**Step 2: Parsing JSON data**\n\nUsing org.json, I can parse the JSON string into a JSONArray or JSONObject, depending on the structure of the JSON.\n\nFor example, if the JSON is an array of objects:\n\n```java\n\nString jsonStr = response.toString();\n\nJSONArray jsonArray = new JSONArray(jsonStr);\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < jsonArray.length(); i++) {\n\n    JSONObject jsonObject = jsonArray.getJSONObject(i);\n\n    // Extract fields from jsonObject\n\n}\n\n```\n\n**Step 3: Connecting to SQLite database**\n\nFirst, I need to add the SQLite JDBC driver to my project. If I'm using Maven, I can add it as a dependency in pom.xml. Otherwise, I need to download the jar and include it in the classpath.\n\nThen, I can establish a connection using JDBC:\n\n```java\n\nString url = \"jdbc:sqlite:mydatabase.db\";\n\nConnection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url);\n\n```\n\n**Step 4: Creating tables**\n\nI need to create tables in the database if they don't already exist. This can be done using SQL CREATE TABLE statements.\n\nFor example:\n\n```java\n\nString createTableSQL = \"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mytable (\"\n\n        + \"id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\"\n\n        + \"name TEXT NOT NULL,\"\n\n        + \"age INTEGER NOT NULL,\"\n\n        + \"email TEXT NOT NULL\"\n\n        + \");\";\n\nStatement stmt = conn.createStatement();\n\nstmt.execute(createTableSQL);\n\n```\n\n**Step 5: Inserting data**\n\nOnce the tables are set up, I can insert the parsed data into the database using SQL INSERT statements.\n\nFor example:\n\n```java\n\nfor (JSONObject jsonObject : jsonObjects) {\n\n    String name = jsonObject.getString(\"name\");\n\n    int age = jsonObject.getInt(\"age\");\n\n    String email = jsonObject.getString(\"email\");\n\n    String insertSQL = \"INSERT INTO mytable (name, age, email) VALUES ('\" + name + \"', \" + age + \", '\" + email + \"');\";\n\n    stmt.executeUpdate(insertSQL);\n\n}\n\n```\n\n**Step 6: Handling exceptions and resource management**\n\nIt's important to handle exceptions that may occur during network operations, JSON parsing, and database operations. Also, ensure that resources like database connections and statements are closed properly to avoid leaks.\n\nUsing try-with-resources in Java can help manage this:\n\n```java\n\ntry (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url);\n\n     Statement stmt = conn.createStatement()) {\n\n    // database operations\n\n} catch (SQLException e) {\n\n    e.printStackTrace();\n\n}\n\n```\n\nAlso, for JSON parsing, handle exceptions like JSONException.\n\nThat's a basic outline of the steps involved. Now, I need to think about how to structure the Java program. Should it be a simple command-line program, or should I make it more modular with classes and methods?\n\nI think organizing the code into methods for each step would make it cleaner and more maintainable. For example:\n\n- A method to make the HTTP request and retrieve the JSON string.\n\n- A method to parse the JSON string into a list of Java objects.\n\n- A method to set up the database connection and create tables.\n\n- A method to insert data into the database.\n\nAdditionally, I can create a class to represent the data structure of the JSON objects, which can make parsing and database insertion more straightforward.\n\nFor example, if the JSON represents users with name, age, and email, I can create a User class:\n\n```java\n\npublic class User {\n\n    private String name;\n\n    private int age;\n\n    private String email;\n\n    // constructors, getters, setters\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThen, the parsing method can return a list of User objects.\n\nAlso, I need to consider error handling. What if the API is unreachable? What if the JSON structure changes? What if there are database connection issues?\n\nI should include try-catch blocks to handle these exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.\n\nAnother consideration is handling existing data in the database. Should I overwrite existing records or append new ones? Depending on the requirement, I might need to implement logic to check for duplicates or update existing entries.\n\nFor now, I'll assume that we're inserting new records each time the program runs.\n\nLet me also think about how to test this program. Since it relies on an external API and database, unit testing might be a bit involved. However, I can write tests for individual methods like parsing JSON or inserting data into the database by mocking the input.\n\nAlternatively, I can hardcode a sample JSON string for testing purposes.\n\nOkay, with all that in mind, I can start outlining the structure of the Java program.\n\nFirst, I need to import the necessary classes:\n\n```java\n\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\n\nimport java.io.InputStreamReader;\n\nimport java.net.HttpURLConnection;\n\nimport java.net.URL;\n\nimport java.sql.Connection;\n\nimport java.sql.DriverManager;\n\nimport java.sql.Statement;\n\nimport org.json.JSONArray;\n\nimport org.json.JSONObject;\n\n```\n\nThen, define the main class and method:\n\n```java\n\npublic class ApiToDatabase {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        // Call methods to perform steps\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nNext, create a method to make the HTTP request and retrieve JSON:\n\n```java\n\nprivate static String retrieveJsonFromApi(String urlStr) throws Exception {\n\n    URL url = new URL(urlStr);\n\n    HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\n\n    connection.setRequestMethod(\"GET\");\n\n    int responseCode = connection.getResponseCode();\n\n    if (responseCode == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK) {\n\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream()));\n\n        String inputLine;\n\n        StringBuilder response = new StringBuilder();\n\n        while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {\n\n            response.append(inputLine);\n\n        }\n\n        in.close();\n\n        return response.toString();\n\n    } else {\n\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"Failed to make GET request: \" + responseCode);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThen, a method to parse the JSON string into a list of User objects:\n\n```java\n\nprivate static List<User> parseJson(String jsonStr) throws Exception {\n\n    List<User> users = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    JSONArray jsonArray = new JSONArray(jsonStr);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < jsonArray.length(); i++) {\n\n        JSONObject jsonObject = jsonArray.getJSONObject(i);\n\n        String name = jsonObject.getString(\"name\");\n\n        int age = jsonObject.getInt(\"age\");\n\n        String email = jsonObject.getString(\"email\");\n\n        users.add(new User(name, age, email));\n\n    }\n\n    return users;\n\n}\n\n```\n\nA method to set up the database connection and create the table:\n\n```java\n\nprivate static Connection setupDatabase() throws Exception {\n\n    String url = \"jdbc:sqlite:mydatabase.db\";\n\n    Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url);\n\n    String createTableSQL = \"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (\"\n\n            + \"id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\"\n\n            + \"name TEXT NOT NULL,\"\n\n            + \"age INTEGER NOT NULL,\"\n\n            + \"email TEXT NOT NULL\"\n\n            + \");\";\n\n    try (Statement stmt = conn.createStatement()) {\n\n        stmt.execute(createTableSQL);\n\n    }\n\n    return conn;\n\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd a method to insert data into the database:\n\n```java\n\nprivate static void insertData(Connection conn, List<User> users) throws Exception {\n\n    try (Statement stmt = conn.createStatement()) {\n\n        for (User user : users) {\n\n            String insertSQL = String.format(\"INSERT INTO users (name, age, email) VALUES ('%s', %d, '%s');\",\n\n                    user.getName(), user.getAge(), user.getEmail());\n\n            stmt.executeUpdate(insertSQL);\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nFinally, in the main method, call these methods in sequence:\n\n```java\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\n    String apiUrl = \"https://api.example.com/users\";\n\n    try {\n\n        String jsonStr = retrieveJsonFromApi(apiUrl);\n\n        List<User> users = parseJson(jsonStr);\n\n        Connection conn = setupDatabase();\n\n        insertData(conn, users);\n\n        conn.close();\n\n        System.out.println(\"Data inserted successfully.\");\n\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n\n        e.printStackTrace();\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nWait a minute, I need to make sure that the JSON structure matches the User class. Let's assume the JSON looks like this:\n\n```json\n\n[\n\n    {\n\n        \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n\n        \"age\": 30,\n\n        \"email\": \"john.doe@example.com\"\n\n    },\n\n    {\n\n        \"name\": \"Jane Smith\",\n\n        \"age\": 25,\n\n        \"email\": \"jane.smith@example.com\"\n\n    }\n\n]\n\n```\n\nSo, the top-level element is an array of objects, each with name, age, and email fields.\n\nIn the parseJson method, I'm assuming that every JSON object has these three fields. If there are missing fields or different data types, it could throw exceptions.\n\nTo make it more robust, I can add checks for null values or handle different data types gracefully.\n\nAlso, in the insertData method, I'm constructing the SQL insert statement using string formatting. This is susceptible to SQL injection attacks. To mitigate this, I should use prepared statements with placeholders for the values.\n\nLet me revise the insertData method to use prepared statements:\n\n```java\n\nprivate static void insertData(Connection conn, List<User> users) throws Exception {\n\n    String insertSQL = \"INSERT INTO users (name, age, email) VALUES (?, ?, ?);\";\n\n    try (PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(insertSQL)) {\n\n        for (User user : users) {\n\n            pstmt.setString(1, user.getName());\n\n            pstmt.setInt(2, user.getAge());\n\n            pstmt.setString(3, user.getEmail());\n\n            pstmt.executeUpdate();\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis is safer and more efficient, especially when inserting multiple records.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider handling duplicates. If the API returns the same data multiple times, I might end up with duplicate records in the database.\n\nTo handle this, I could add a unique constraint to one or more columns, such as email, and use INSERT OR IGNORE in the SQL statement.\n\nFirst, modify the table creation SQL:\n\n```sql\n\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (\n\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n\n    name TEXT NOT NULL,\n\n    age INTEGER NOT NULL,\n\n    email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE\n\n);\n\n```\n\nThen, use INSERT OR IGNORE in the insert statement:\n\n```sql\n\nINSERT OR IGNORE INTO users (name, age, email) VALUES (?, ?, ?);\n\n```\n\nThis way, if a record with the same email already exists, the insertion will be ignored without throwing an error.\n\nAnother consideration is handling large datasets. If the API returns a huge amount of data, loading it all into memory at once might not be feasible.\n\nTo handle large datasets, I could process the JSON data in chunks, inserting data in batches to manage memory usage efficiently.\n\nHowever, for simplicity, I'll assume that the dataset is small enough to handle in memory.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that the program handles exceptions properly and closes resources even if an exception occurs. Using try-with-resources for connections and statements takes care of closing them automatically.\n\nI should also log or print appropriate messages to indicate the progress and any errors that occur.\n\nLet me also think about how to run this program. Since it's a Java application, I need to compile and run it using the Java command.\n\nI need to make sure that all required jars are in the classpath, especially the SQLite JDBC driver and the org.json library if it's not included in the JDK.\n\nIf I'm using Maven, I can manage dependencies easily. Here's an example pom.xml:\n\n```xml\n\n<project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\"\n\n    xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n\n    xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n\n    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n\n    <groupId>com.example</groupId>\n\n    <artifactId>api-to-database</artifactId>\n\n    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n\n    <dependencies>\n\n        <dependency>\n\n            <groupId>org.xerial</groupId>\n\n            <artifactId>sqlite-jdbc</artifactId>\n\n            <version>3.36.0.3</version>\n\n        </dependency>\n\n        <dependency>\n\n            <groupId>org.json</groupId>\n\n            <artifactId>json</artifactId>\n\n            <version>20210307</version>\n\n        </dependency>\n\n    </dependencies>\n\n</project>\n\n```\n\nWith Maven, I can compile and run the program using mvn commands.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm not using Maven, I need to download the sqlite-jdbc.jar and json.jar and include them in the classpath when compiling and running the Java program.\n\nFor example:\n\n```sh\n\njavac -cp .;sqlite-jdbc.jar;json.jar ApiToDatabase.java\n\njava -cp .;sqlite-jdbc.jar;json.jar ApiToDatabase\n\n```\n\nOn Unix-like systems, use colon (:) instead of semicolon (;) to separate classpath entries.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered the main aspects of this task. Now, I need to write the actual code accordingly.\n\nWait, I should also consider the User class. Let's define that.\n\nHere's a simple implementation of the User class:\n\n```java\n\npublic class User {\n\n    private String name;\n\n    private int age;\n\n    private String email;\n\n    public User(String name, int age, String email) {\n\n        this.name = name;\n\n        this.age = age;\n\n        this.email = email;\n\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n\n        return name;\n\n    }\n\n    public int getAge() {\n\n        return age;\n\n    }\n\n    public String getEmail() {\n\n        return email;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nI should place this class in the same package or import it appropriately in the ApiToDatabase class.\n\nAlso, in the insertData method, I need to make sure that the prepared statement is properly closed. Using try-with-resources ensures that.\n\nHere's the revised insertData method:\n\n```java\n\nprivate static void insertData(Connection conn, List<User> users) throws SQLException {\n\n    String insertSQL = \"INSERT OR IGNORE INTO users (name, age, email) VALUES (?, ?, ?);\";\n\n    try (PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(insertSQL)) {\n\n        for (User user : users) {\n\n            pstmt.setString(1, user.getName());\n\n            pstmt.setInt(2, user.getAge());\n\n            pstmt.setString(3, user.getEmail());\n\n            pstmt.executeUpdate();\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nI've also changed the exception type to SQLException since that's the specific exception that can be thrown by JDBC methods.\n\nSimilarly, in the parseJson method, I should catch JSONException if using org.json.\n\nWait, in the initial code, I had a general Exception catch block. It's better to catch specific exceptions and handle them accordingly.\n\nHere's an improved version of the retrieveJsonFromApi method:\n\n```java\n\nprivate static String retrieveJsonFromApi(String urlStr) throws IOException {\n\n    URL url = new URL(urlStr);\n\n    HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\n\n    connection.setRequestMethod(\"GET\");\n\n    int responseCode = connection.getResponseCode();\n\n    if (responseCode == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK) {\n\n        try (BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream()))) {\n\n            StringBuilder response = new StringBuilder();\n\n            String inputLine;\n\n            while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {\n\n                response.append(inputLine);\n\n            }\n\n            return response.toString();\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"Failed to make GET request: \" + responseCode);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nUsing try-with-resources for the BufferedReader ensures it's closed properly.\n\nSimilarly, in the parseJson method:\n\n```java\n\nprivate static List<User> parseJson(String jsonStr) throws JSONException {\n\n    List<User> users = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    JSONArray jsonArray = new JSONArray(jsonStr);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < jsonArray.length(); i++) {\n\n        JSONObject jsonObject = jsonArray.getJSONObject(i);\n\n        String name = jsonObject.getString(\"name\");\n\n        int age = jsonObject.getInt(\"age\");\n\n        String email = jsonObject.getString(\"email\");\n\n        users.add(new User(name, age, email));\n\n    }\n\n    return users;\n\n}\n\n```\n\nI'm specifying JSONException, which is thrown by org.json methods.\n\nIn the setupDatabase method, I need to handle SQLException:\n\n```java\n\nprivate static Connection setupDatabase() throws SQLException {\n\n    String url = \"jdbc:sqlite:mydatabase.db\";\n\n    return DriverManager.getConnection(url);\n\n}\n\n```\n\nWait, in the earlier version, I had table creation inside this method. To keep it simple, I can move table creation to a separate method.\n\nLet me refactor that.\n\nFirst, modify setupDatabase to only establish the connection:\n\n```java\n\nprivate static Connection setupDatabase() throws SQLException {\n\n    String url = \"jdbc:sqlite:mydatabase.db\";\n\n    return DriverManager.getConnection(url);\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThen, create a separate method to create the table:\n\n```java\n\nprivate static void createTableIfNotExists(Connection conn) throws SQLException {\n\n    String createTableSQL = \"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (\"\n\n            + \"id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\"\n\n            + \"name TEXT NOT NULL,\"\n\n            + \"age INTEGER NOT NULL,\"\n\n            + \"email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE\"\n\n            + \");\";\n\n    try (Statement stmt = conn.createStatement()) {\n\n        stmt.execute(createTableSQL);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis way, the setupDatabase method only handles connecting to the database, and creating tables is a separate concern.\n\nNow, in the main method, I can call setupDatabase followed by createTableIfNotExists.\n\nAlso, I should ensure that the database connection is closed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. Using try-with-resources for the connection is ideal.\n\nHere's an improved main method:\n\n```java\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\n    String apiUrl = \"https://api.example.com/users\";\n\n    try (\n\n        Connection conn = setupDatabase()\n\n    ) {\n\n        String jsonStr = retrieveJsonFromApi(apiUrl);\n\n        List<User> users = parseJson(jsonStr);\n\n        createTableIfNotExists(conn);\n\n        insertData(conn, users);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Data inserted successfully.\");\n\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n\n        System.err.println(\"Error retrieving data from API: \" + e.getMessage());\n\n        e.printStackTrace();\n\n    } catch (JSONException e) {\n\n        System.err.println(\"Error parsing JSON: \" + e.getMessage());\n\n        e.printStackTrace();\n\n    } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n        System.err.println(\"Error setting up database: \" + e.getMessage());\n\n        e.printStackTrace();\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis way, the connection is automatically closed after the try block, regardless of exceptions.\n\nI should also consider logging instead of printing stack traces, but for simplicity, this will do.\n\nAdditionally, I can add more descriptive messages or even exit codes to indicate success or failure.\n\nAnother enhancement could be to parameterize the API URL and possibly the database path, maybe through command-line arguments.\n\nFor example:\n\n```java\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\n    if (args.length < 2) {\n\n        System.err.println(\"Usage: java ApiToDatabase <api_url> <database_path>\");\n\n        System.exit(1);\n\n    }\n\n    String apiUrl = args[0];\n\n    String dbPath = args[1];\n\n    try (\n\n        Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(\"jdbc:sqlite:\" + dbPath)\n\n    ) {\n\n        String jsonStr = retrieveJsonFromApi(apiUrl);\n\n        List<User> users = parseJson(jsonStr);\n\n        createTableIfNotExists(conn);\n\n        insertData(conn, users);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Data inserted successfully.\");\n\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n\n        System.err.println(\"Error retrieving data from API: \" + e.getMessage());\n\n        e.printStackTrace();\n\n    } catch (JSONException e) {\n\n        System.err.println(\"Error parsing JSON: \" + e.getMessage());\n\n        e.printStackTrace();\n\n    } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n        System.err.println(\"Error setting up database: \" + e.getMessage());\n\n        e.printStackTrace();\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis makes the program more flexible, as it can work with different API URLs and database files.\n\nHowever, for this example, I'll keep it simple with hardcoded values.\n\nLet me also think about testing this program. Since it depends on an external API and a database file, I need to ensure that the API is accessible and that the program has write permissions for the database file.\n\nTo test the JSON parsing, I can create a sample JSON string and pass it to the parseJson method.\n\nFor example:\n\n```java\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\n    String sampleJson = \"[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"John Doe\\\",\\\"age\\\":30,\\\"email\\\":\\\"john.doe@example.com\\\"},\"\n\n            + \"{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Jane Smith\\\",\\\"age\\\":25,\\\"email\\\":\\\"jane.smith@example.com\\\"}]\";\n\n    try {\n\n        List<User> users = parseJson(sampleJson);\n\n        for (User user : users) {\n\n            System.out.println(user.getName() + \", \" + user.getAge() + \", \" + user.getEmail());\n\n        }\n\n    } catch (JSONException e) {\n\n        e.printStackTrace();\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis way, I can verify that the parsing logic works correctly without relying on the API.\n\nSimilarly, I can test database operations by inserting sample data.\n\nAlso, I should consider edge cases, such as empty JSON arrays, missing fields in JSON objects, or invalid data types.\n\nFor instance, if a JSON object is missing the \"age\" field, getInt(\"age\") will throw a JSONException. To handle this, I can use optInt(\"age\", defaultValue) to provide a default value if the field is missing.\n\nHere's an updated parseJson method:\n\n```java\n\nprivate static List<User> parseJson(String jsonStr) throws JSONException {\n\n    List<User> users = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    JSONArray jsonArray = new JSONArray(jsonStr);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < jsonArray.length(); i++) {\n\n        JSONObject jsonObject = jsonArray.getJSONObject(i);\n\n        String name = jsonObject.optString(\"name\", \"N/A\");\n\n        int age = jsonObject.optInt(\"age\", 0);\n\n        String email = jsonObject.optString(\"email\", \"N/A\");\n\n        users.add(new User(name, age, email));\n\n    }\n\n    return users;\n\n}\n\n```\n\nUsing optString and optInt methods with default values ensures that the program doesn't fail if certain fields are missing, although this might not always be the desired behavior depending on the requirements.\n\nAlternatively, I could skip incomplete records or log an error.\n\nAnother consideration is data validation. For example, email addresses should be in a valid format, and ages should be within a reasonable range.\n\nI can add validation logic in the parseJson method or in a separate method before inserting data into the database.\n\nFor now, I'll keep it simple without validation.\n\nI should also think about performance. If the JSON array is very large, loading all users into a list might consume too much memory.\n\nTo handle large datasets, I could process each JSON object one at a time, inserting it into the database immediately.\n\nThis would require modifying the code to parse the JSON stream incrementally without loading the entire JSON string into memory.\n\nHowever, for simplicity, I'll stick with the current approach assuming the dataset is small.\n\nAnother aspect is error recovery. If an error occurs during data insertion, I might want to roll back any changes made so far to maintain data consistency.\n\nTo do this, I can enable transactions in the database and roll back on error.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```java\n\ntry (\n\n    Connection conn = setupDatabase()\n\n) {\n\n    conn.setAutoCommit(false); // Start a transaction\n\n    try {\n\n        String jsonStr = retrieveJsonFromApi(apiUrl);\n\n        List<User> users = parseJson(jsonStr);\n\n        createTableIfNotExists(conn);\n\n        insertData(conn, users);\n\n        conn.commit(); // Commit the transaction if all operations succeed\n\n        System.out.println(\"Data inserted successfully.\");\n\n    } catch (IOException | JSONException | SQLException e) {\n\n        conn.rollback(); // Roll back on error\n\n        System.err.println(\"Error processing data: \" + e.getMessage());\n\n        e.printStackTrace();\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nBy setting auto-commit to false, all SQL operations become part of a single transaction, which can be committed if successful or rolled back if an error occurs.\n\nThis ensures that the database remains in a consistent state.\n\nI need to make sure that the SQLite database supports transactions, which it does.\n\nAdditionally, I should handle any SQLExceptions that may occur during commit or rollback.\n\nHere's a more robust version:\n\n```java\n\ntry (\n\n    Connection conn = setupDatabase()\n\n) {\n\n    conn.setAutoCommit(false); // Start a transaction\n\n    try {\n\n        String jsonStr = retrieveJsonFromApi(apiUrl);\n\n        List<User> users = parseJson(jsonStr);\n\n        createTableIfNotExists(conn);\n\n        insertData(conn, users);\n\n        conn.commit(); // Commit the transaction if all operations succeed\n\n        System.out.println(\"Data inserted successfully.\");\n\n    } catch (IOException | JSONException | SQLException e) {\n\n        try {\n\n            conn.rollback(); // Roll back on error\n\n        } catch (SQLException ex) {\n\n            System.err.println(\"Error rolling back transaction: \" + ex.getMessage());\n\n            ex.printStackTrace();\n\n        }\n\n        System.err.println(\"Error processing data: \" + e.getMessage());\n\n        e.printStackTrace();\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis way, even if rollback fails, I can log that separately.\n\nAnother thing to consider is closing resources in the correct order. According to the try-with-resources specification, resources are closed in the reverse order of their declaration.\n\nSo, in the setupDatabase method, if I had multiple resources, I need to ensure their order.\n\nBut in this case, since only the connection is managed with try-with-resources in the main method, it's straightforward.\n\nI should also make sure that the User class is immutable or at least that its fields are final, to prevent accidental modifications after creation.\n\nHere's an updated User class with final fields:\n\n```java\n\npublic class User {\n\n    private final String name;\n\n    private final int age;\n\n    private final String email;\n\n    public User(String name, int age, String email) {\n\n        this.name = name;\n\n        this.age = age;\n\n        this.email = email;\n\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n\n        return name;\n\n    }\n\n    public int getAge() {\n\n        return age;\n\n    }\n\n    public String getEmail() {\n\n        return email;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis makes the class safer to use, especially in multi-threaded environments.\n\nHowever, since this program is likely single-threaded, it's more of a best practice.\n\nI should also consider adding getters and setters if there are any mutable fields, but in this case, all fields are final.\n\nAnother improvement could be to use Java 8's try-with-resources with multiple autoclosable objects.\n\nFor example, in the retrieveJsonFromApi method, I can open both the connection and the bufferedReader in try-with-resources:\n\n```java\n\nprivate static String retrieveJsonFromApi(String urlStr) throws IOException {\n\n    try (\n\n        URL url = new URL(urlStr);\n\n        HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\n\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream()))\n\n    ) {\n\n        connection.setRequestMethod(\"GET\");\n\n        int responseCode = connection.getResponseCode();\n\n        if (responseCode == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK) {\n\n            StringBuilder response = new StringBuilder();\n\n            String inputLine;\n\n            while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {\n\n                response.append(inputLine);\n\n            }\n\n            return response.toString();\n\n        } else {\n\n            throw new RuntimeException(\"Failed to make GET request: \" + responseCode);\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis ensures that both the connection and the bufferedReader are closed properly.\n\nWait, actually, HttpURLConnection needs to be closed properly, and using try-with-resources on URL isn't necessary because URL isn't autoclosable.\n\nI need to adjust that.\n\nHere's a better version:\n\n```java\n\nprivate static String retrieveJsonFromApi(String urlStr) throws IOException {\n\n    URL url = new URL(urlStr);\n\n    HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\n\n    connection.setRequestMethod(\"GET\");\n\n    int responseCode = connection.getResponseCode();\n\n    if (responseCode == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK) {\n\n        try (BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream()))) {\n\n            StringBuilder response = new StringBuilder();\n\n            String inputLine;\n\n            while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {\n\n                response.append(inputLine);\n\n            }\n\n            return response.toString();\n\n        } finally {\n\n            connection.disconnect();\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"Failed to make GET request: \" + responseCode);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nCalling connection.disconnect() ensures that the connection is released back to the connection pool or closed appropriately.\n\nThis is a good practice to follow.\n\nI should also consider setting a read timeout to handle cases where the API takes too long to respond.\n\nThis can be done by calling connection.setReadTimeout(timeoutInMillis);\n\nFor example:\n\n```java\n\nconnection.setReadTimeout(10000); // 10 seconds\n\n```\n\nThis prevents the program from hanging indefinitely if the API is unresponsive.\n\nSimilarly, I can set a connection timeout:\n\n```java\n\nconnection.setConnectTimeout(5000); // 5 seconds\n\n```\n\nAdding these timeouts makes the program more robust and responsive.\n\nHere's the updated retrieveJsonFromApi method with timeouts:\n\n```java\n\nprivate static String retrieveJsonFromApi(String urlStr) throws IOException {\n\n    URL url = new URL(urlStr);\n\n    HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\n\n    connection.setRequestMethod(\"GET\");\n\n    connection.setReadTimeout(10000); // 10 seconds read timeout\n\n    connection.setConnectTimeout(5000); // 5 seconds connect timeout\n\n    int responseCode = connection.getResponseCode();\n\n    if (responseCode == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK) {\n\n        try (BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream()))) {\n\n            StringBuilder response = new StringBuilder();\n\n            String inputLine;\n\n            while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {\n\n                response.append(inputLine);\n\n            }\n\n            return response.toString();\n\n        } finally {\n\n            connection.disconnect();\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"Failed to make GET request: \" + responseCode);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis should cover most of the edge cases related to network operations.\n\nNow, regarding the database operations, I need to ensure that the SQLite JDBC driver is properly included in the project.\n\nIf using Maven, as I mentioned earlier, adding the dependency in pom.xml takes care of it.\n\nOtherwise, downloading the sqlite-jdbc.jar and including it in the classpath is necessary.\n\nAlso, I should consider the version compatibility of the JDBC driver with the SQLite version on the system.\n\nMostly, this isn't an issue, but it's good to be aware of potential compatibility problems.\n\nAnother consideration is the location where the database file is created. By specifying \"jdbc:sqlite:mydatabase.db\", the file is created in the current working directory of the program.\n\nI might want to specify an absolute path to avoid confusion about where the database is stored, especially in production environments.\n\nFor example:\n\n```java\n\nString url = \"jdbc:sqlite:/path/to/mydatabase.db\";\n\n```\n\nThis ensures that the database is stored in the intended location.\n\nAlso, I should handle cases where the database file already exists and contains data.\n\nSince I'm using INSERT OR IGNORE, duplicate records based on the unique email constraint will be ignored.\n\nIf I need to update existing records, I could use INSERT OR REPLACE or merge statements, but that's beyond the scope of this simple program.\n\nI should also think about data types and lengths.\n\nIn the database table, I've defined email as TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE.\n\nI should ensure that the email field in the JSON data is indeed a string and doesn't exceed the maximum length allowed by the database.\n\nHowever, in SQLite, TEXT fields can hold up to 2^31-1 bytes of data, which is more than sufficient for email addresses.\n\nSimilarly, the name and age fields should be appropriate.\n\nIf age can be zero or negative, I might want to add constraints in the database or validate it in the code.\n\nFor now, I'll assume that age is a non-negative integer and handle it accordingly.\n\nI can also add more constraints to the database table if needed, such as checking that age is greater than zero.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```sql\n\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (\n\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n\n    name TEXT NOT NULL,\n\n    age INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (age >= 0),\n\n    email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE\n\n);\n\n```\n\nThis adds a check constraint to ensure that age is not negative.\n\nI can include this in the createTableIfNotExists method.\n\nMoreover, I can add indices to the table if necessary for performance, especially if the table grows large.\n\nFor example, creating an index on the email column can speed up lookups and uniqueness checks.\n\nHere's how to create an index:\n\n```sql\n\nCREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS email_index ON users (email);\n\n```\n\nHowever, since I've already defined the email column as UNIQUE, SQLite automatically creates a unique index for it.\n\nSo, in this case, explicitly creating an index might be redundant.\n\nI should also consider the character encoding for text fields, but SQLite handles UTF-8 by default, which is usually sufficient.\n\nAnother aspect is handling errors during database insertion.\n\nIf a record fails to insert due to a unique constraint violation, it will be ignored if using INSERT OR IGNORE.\n\nHowever, if other errors occur, such as database being locked or disk space issues, appropriate exceptions will be thrown, which I need to handle.\n\nIn the current error handling setup, SQLExceptions are caught and printed, which should cover most database-related errors.\n\nI should also consider logging the errors instead of printing them, especially if this program is intended for production use.\n\nUsing a logging framework like Log4j or Java's built-in java.util.logging can provide more flexibility and control over error logging.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll stick with printing stack traces for now.\n\nAdditionally, I can enhance the program by providing more user feedback, such as the number of records inserted or any records that failed to insert.\n\nThis can be useful for monitoring and debugging purposes.\n\nFor example, in the insertData method, I can keep track of the number of inserted records:\n\n```java\n\nprivate static void insertData(Connection conn, List<User> users) throws SQLException {\n\n    String insertSQL = \"INSERT OR IGNORE INTO users (name, age, email) VALUES (?, ?, ?);\";\n\n    try (PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(insertSQL)) {\n\n        int insertedCount = 0;\n\n        for (User user : users) {\n\n            pstmt.setString(1, user.getName());\n\n            pstmt.setInt(2, user.getAge());\n\n            pstmt.setString(3, user.getEmail());\n\n            int rowsAffected = pstmt.executeUpdate();\n\n            if (rowsAffected > 0) {\n\n                insertedCount++;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(insertedCount + \" records inserted.\");\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis provides feedback on how many new records were added to the database.\n\nSimilarly, I can log any records that were skipped due to duplicates.\n\nThis can be done by checking the rowsAffected value and logging the user data if insertion fails.\n\nHowever, this might not be necessary for this simple program.\n\nI should also consider internationalization if the JSON data contains non-English characters.\n\nSince JSON uses UTF-8 encoding by default, and Java handles Unicode well, this should not be an issue in most cases.\n\nI need to ensure that the database and tables are also configured to store Unicode characters correctly.\n\nIn SQLite, UTF-8 is the default encoding, so this should be handled automatically.\n\nAnother consideration is handling null values in the JSON data.\n\nIn the parseJson method, using optString and optInt with default values handles missing fields, but if the JSON contains null values explicitly, I need to decide how to handle them.\n\nFor example, if \"name\" is null in the JSON, optString will return an empty string, which might not be desirable.\n\nI can modify the parseJson method to handle null values appropriately, perhaps by assigning a default value or skipping such records.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```java\n\nString name = jsonObject.isNull(\"name\") ? \"N/A\" : jsonObject.getString(\"name\");\n\nint age = jsonObject.isNull(\"age\") ? 0 : jsonObject.getInt(\"age\");\n\nString email = jsonObject.isNull(\"email\") ? \"N/A\" : jsonObject.getString(\"email\");\n\n```\n\nThis ensures that null fields are handled consistently.\n\nAlternatively, I can skip records with missing required fields.\n\nFor instance, if email is mandatory, I can skip records where email is missing or null.\n\nHere's how to do that:\n\n```java\n\nif (!jsonObject.isNull(\"email\") && !jsonObject.getString(\"email\").isEmpty()) {\n\n    String name = jsonObject.optString(\"name\", \"N/A\");\n\n    int age = jsonObject.optInt(\"age\", 0);\n\n    String email = jsonObject.getString(\"email\");\n\n    users.add(new User(name, age, email));\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis way, only records with a valid email are added to the list.\n\nI need to decide based on the requirements whether to allow default values or skip invalid records.\n\nFor this example, I'll assume that all fields are required and use default values for missing fields.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of the JSON structure changing.\n\nIf the API updates its JSON format, the program might break if it expects different field names or structures.\n\nTo make the program more adaptable, I can configure field names through properties or constants.\n\nFor example, define constants for JSON keys:\n\n```java\n\nprivate static final String KEY_NAME = \"name\";\n\nprivate static final String KEY_AGE = \"age\";\n\nprivate static final String KEY_EMAIL = \"email\";\n\n```\n\nThen, use these constants in the parseJson method:\n\n```java\n\nString name = jsonObject.optString(KEY_NAME, \"N/A\");\n\nint age = jsonObject.optInt(KEY_AGE, 0);\n\nString email = jsonObject.optString(KEY_EMAIL, \"N/A\");\n\n```\n\nThis makes it easier to change field names if needed without modifying multiple parts of the code.\n\nAdditionally, I can add configuration files or command-line arguments to specify JSON field mappings, but that would complicate the program significantly.\n\nFor now, hardcoding the field names is acceptable.\n\nI should also think about the program's scalability.\n\nIf the API returns a large number of records, or if this program needs to run periodically to fetch new data, I need to ensure that it can handle the load efficiently.\n\nTo optimize performance, I can batch insert statements instead of executing them one by one.\n\nSQLite supports executing multiple inserts in a single SQL statement, which can be faster.\n\nHowever, using prepared statements with addBatch and executeBatch can achieve similar performance improvements.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```java\n\nprivate static void insertData(Connection conn, List<User> users) throws SQLException {\n\n    String insertSQL = \"INSERT OR IGNORE INTO users (name, age, email) VALUES (?, ?, ?);\";\n\n    try (PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(insertSQL)) {\n\n        for (User user : users) {\n\n            pstmt.setString(1, user.getName());\n\n            pstmt.setInt(2, user.getAge());\n\n            pstmt.setString(3, user.getEmail());\n\n            pstmt.addBatch();\n\n        }\n\n        pstmt.executeBatch();\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nUsing addBatch and executeBatch can be more efficient than executing each insert statement separately, especially for large datasets.\n\nI should also consider setting the batch size and calling executeBatch in chunks to manage memory usage.\n\nFor example:\n\n```java\n\nprivate static void insertData(Connection conn, List<User> users) throws SQLException {\n\n    String insertSQL = \"INSERT OR IGNORE INTO users (name, age, email) VALUES (?, ?, ?);\";\n\n    try (PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(insertSQL)) {\n\n        int batchSize = 1000;\n\n        int count = 0;\n\n        for (User user : users) {\n\n            pstmt.setString(1, user.getName());\n\n            pstmt.setInt(2, user.getAge());\n\n            pstmt.setString(3, user.getEmail());\n\n            pstmt.addBatch();\n\n            if (++count % batchSize == 0) {\n\n                pstmt.executeBatch();\n\n                pstmt.clearBatch();\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        // Execute any remaining batches\n\n        if (count % batchSize != 0) {\n\n            pstmt.executeBatch();\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis way, the program sends batches of 1000 insert statements at a time to the database, which can improve performance and prevent memory issues with very large datasets.\n\nFor this example, assuming the dataset is small, I'll keep it simple without batch processing.\n\nAnother consideration is transaction management.\n\nIn the current implementation, I'm wrapping all database operations in a single transaction.\n\nFor large datasets, this might not be efficient, as it can lead to long transaction times and increased memory usage.\n\nIn such cases, it's better to commit transactions in batches.\n\nFor example, commit after every 1000 records inserted.\n\nHowever, this requires careful handling to ensure data consistency in case of errors.\n\nGiven the simplicity of this program, I'll keep transaction management as is.\n\nI should also think about how to run this program periodically, for example, to fetch and store data at regular intervals.\n\nThis can be achieved using scheduling mechanisms like Quartz Scheduler or simply using operating system cron jobs to run the program at specified times.\n\nBut that's beyond the scope of this task.\n\nAnother aspect is securing sensitive information, such as database paths or API keys, if the API requires authentication.\n\nIn this example, the API URL is hardcoded, and there's no authentication.\n\nIf authentication is needed, I need to handle API keys or other credentials securely, perhaps by storing them in environment variables or configuration files that are not world-readable.\n\nFor now, assuming the API is public and doesn't require authentication, I'll leave it as is.\n\nI should also consider the program's exit status.\n\nIn the main method, if an error occurs, the program prints the stack trace and exits with a non-zero status.\n\nI can make it more explicit by setting the exit code based on success or failure.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```java\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\n    String apiUrl = \"https://api.example.com/users\";\n\n    int exitCode = 0;\n\n    try (\n\n        Connection conn = setupDatabase()\n\n    ) {\n\n        String jsonStr = retrieveJsonFromApi(apiUrl);\n\n        List<User> users = parseJson(jsonStr);\n\n        createTableIfNotExists(conn);\n\n        insertData(conn, users);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Data inserted successfully.\");\n\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n\n        System.err.println(\"Error retrieving data from API: \" + e.getMessage());\n\n        e.printStackTrace();\n\n        exitCode = 1;\n\n    } catch (JSONException e) {\n\n        System.err.println(\"Error parsing JSON: \" + e.getMessage());\n\n        e.printStackTrace();\n\n        exitCode = 2;\n\n    } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n        System.err.println(\"Error setting up database: \" + e.getMessage());\n\n        e.printStackTrace();\n\n        exitCode = 3;\n\n    } finally {\n\n        System.exit(exitCode);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis way, the program returns different exit codes based on the type of error, which can be useful for scripting and monitoring.\n\nLastly, I should write comments in the code to explain the purpose of each method and important steps, making it easier for others (or myself in the future) to understand and maintain the code.\n\nI can also include a header with documentation, such as the program's purpose, author, date, and usage instructions.\n\nHere's an example of adding comments:\n\n```java\n\n/**\n\n * This program retrieves JSON data from a specified RESTful API, parses the JSON,\n\n * and stores the data into a SQLite database.\n\n *\n\n * Usage:\n\n * java ApiToDatabase <api_url> <database_path>\n\n *\n\n * Example:\n\n * java ApiToDatabase https://api.example.com/users /path/to/mydatabase.db\n\n */\n\npublic class ApiToDatabase {\n\n    // Class implementation with methods and main function\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis provides a clear description of what the program does and how to use it.\n\nIn conclusion, I've outlined a Java program that reads JSON data from a RESTful API, parses it, and stores it in a SQLite database.\n\nI've considered various aspects such as error handling, resource management, data validation, and performance optimizations.\n\nBy following this design, the program should be robust, efficient, and easy to maintain.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo accomplish the task of reading JSON data from a RESTful API, parsing it, and storing it in a SQLite database, we will create a Java program that performs these operations step by step. This solution ensures that all necessary steps are handled efficiently and safely.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Retrieve JSON Data from API:**\n   - Use `java.net.HttpURLConnection` to make a GET request to the API.\n   - Read the response and collect the JSON string.\n\n2. **Parse JSON Data:**\n   - Utilize the `org.json` library to parse the JSON string into Java objects.\n\n3. **Set Up SQLite Database:**\n   - Establish a connection to the SQLite database using JDBC.\n   - Create the necessary table if it doesn't exist.\n\n4. **Insert Data into Database:**\n   - Use prepared statements to insert parsed data into the database.\n   - Ensure data integrity and handle duplicates using unique constraints.\n\n5. **Handle Exceptions and Resource Management:**\n   - Use try-with-resources to manage database connections and statements.\n   - Handle exceptions appropriately to ensure the program doesn't crash unexpectedly.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.InputStreamReader;\nimport java.sql.Connection;\nimport java.sql.DriverManager;\nimport java.sql.PreparedStatement;\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection;\n\nimport org.json.JSONArray;\nimport org.json.JSONException;\nimport org.json.JSONObject;\n\npublic class ApiToDatabase {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String apiUrl = \"https://api.example.com/users\";\n        try (Connection conn = setupDatabase()) {\n            String jsonStr = retrieveJsonFromApi(apiUrl);\n            List<User> users = parseJson(jsonStr);\n            createTableIfNotExists(conn);\n            insertData(conn, users);\n            System.out.println(\"Data inserted successfully.\");\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            System.err.println(\"Error retrieving data from API: \" + e.getMessage());\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        } catch (JSONException e) {\n            System.err.println(\"Error parsing JSON: \" + e.getMessage());\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        } catch (SQLException e) {\n            System.err.println(\"Error setting up database: \" + e.getMessage());\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static String retrieveJsonFromApi(String urlStr) throws IOException {\n        java.net.URL url = new java.net.URL(urlStr);\n        HttpsURLConnection connection = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();\n        connection.setRequestMethod(\"GET\");\n        connection.setReadTimeout(10000);
