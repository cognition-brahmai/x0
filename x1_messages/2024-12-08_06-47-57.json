Useful for acquiring knowledge about people, places, companies, historical events, etc.\nSiteScraper[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline separated links, where input is one or more links, and outputs plain text containing the content of the links.\nHyperlinkExtractor[input]: Extracts hyperlinks from plain text and generates a plain text, newline separated response of links.\nAnswerBot[input]: A question-answering language model, useful for answering questions based on an input text passage. The input must be a text question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., What is the capital of France, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe output should follow this format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may refer to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What is the history of the Eiffel Tower and how has it been maintained over the years?"
