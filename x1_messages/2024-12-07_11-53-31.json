These wetlands are designed to take advantage of the natural processes involving wetland vegetation, soils, and their associated microbial assemblages to assist in treating wastewater. They can be used to treat a variety of types of wastewater including municipal, industrial, and stormwater runoff. The primary mechanisms of treatment include sedimentation, filtration, and biological degradation. Based on this information, which of the following is not a primary mechanism of treatment in a constructed wetland?\nA. Filtration\nB. Sedimentation\nC. Biological degradation\nD. Chemical oxidation"
