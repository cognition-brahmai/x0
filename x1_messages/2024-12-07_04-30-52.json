        "content": "Given the scenario, Tom, Jerry, and Lucy were told that Uncle Jack hid the remaining candies in a red box in the kitchen cabinet. However, Aunt Mary moved the candies to a blue box in the living room without informing the children. When the children decide to look for more candies, they would likely search first in the place where they were told the candies were hidden, which is the red box in the kitchen cabinet.\n\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Information**: Uncle Jack told the children that he hid the remaining candies in a red box in the kitchen cabinet.\n\n2. **Unaware of Change**: Aunt Mary moved the candies to a blue box in the living room without letting the children know about this change.\n\n3. **Children's Knowledge**: The children only have the information given by Uncle Jack and are unaware that Aunt Mary moved the candies.\n\n4. **Natural Behavior**: When looking for something, people generally go to the place where they last remember it being placed.\n\nTherefore, Tom, Jerry, and Lucy would probably search first in the kitchen cabinet for the red box, expecting to find the candies there.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{They would search first in the kitchen cabinet for the red box.}} \\]"
