        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 5 red balls and 7 blue balls, so total balls in the bag are 5 + 7 = 12. I need to find the probability of drawing exactly 2 red balls when I draw 4 balls without replacement.\n\nOkay, first things first, since we're drawing without replacement, the probability changes with each draw. That means I can't just multiply independent probabilities here. I need to think about combinations.\n\nI recall that in probability, when dealing with drawing items without replacement, combinations are often used because the order doesn't matter. So, I should consider the total number of ways to draw 4 balls out of 12, and the number of ways to draw exactly 2 red balls out of 5 and 2 blue balls out of 7.\n\nLet me recall the combination formula: The number of combinations of n items taken k at a time is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!).\n\nSo, the total number of ways to draw 4 balls out of 12 is C(12, 4).\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to draw 2 red balls out of 5 is C(5, 2), and the number of ways to draw 2 blue balls out of 7 is C(7, 2).\n\nSince these are independent events (drawing red and drawing blue), the number of favorable outcomes should be the product of C(5, 2) and C(7, 2).\n\nTherefore, the probability should be [C(5, 2) * C(7, 2)] / C(12, 4).\n\nLet me calculate each part step by step.\n\nFirst, C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * 3!) = (5 * 4 * 3!) / (2 * 1 * 3!)) = (5 * 4) / 2 = 10.\n\nNext, C(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * 5!) = (7 * 6 * 5!) / (2 * 1 * 5!)) = (7 * 6) / 2 = 21.\n\nSo, the numerator is 10 * 21 = 210.\n\nNow, C(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * 8!) = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8!) / (24 * 8!)) = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / 24.\n\nCalculating the numerator: 12 * 11 = 132, 132 * 10 = 1320, 1320 * 9 = 11880.\n\nDivide by 24: 11880 / 24 = 495.\n\nSo, C(12, 4) = 495.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 210 / 495.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 15.\n\n210 \u00f7 15 = 14, and 495 \u00f7 15 = 33.\n\nSo, 14/33.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if it can be simplified further. 14 and 33 have no common factors other than 1, so 14/33 is the simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing exactly 2 red balls out of 4 is 14/33.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nStarting again:\n\nC(5, 2) = 10, that's correct.\n\nC(7, 2) = 21, that's correct.\n\nC(12, 4) = 495, that's correct.\n\n210 / 495 = 14/33, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it step by step, considering the probability of drawing red balls in specific positions.\n\nFor example, the probability of drawing red on the first two draws and blue on the last two.\n\nBut that would be more complicated because the probabilities change with each draw.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the hypergeometric distribution formula, which is exactly what I did with combinations.\n\nSo, I think 14/33 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nSuppose I calculate the probability of drawing exactly 2 red balls by considering the different orders in which this can happen.\n\nFor example, R R B B, R B R B, R B B R, B R R B, B R B R, B B R R.\n\nThere are C(4, 2) = 6 ways to arrange 2 reds and 2 blues.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for one of these sequences, say R R B B.\n\nThe probability of drawing a red first is 5/12.\n\nThen, a second red is 4/11.\n\nThen, a blue is 7/10.\n\nThen, another blue is 6/9.\n\nSo, the probability for R R B B is (5/12) * (4/11) * (7/10) * (6/9).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, 5/12 * 4/11 = (5 * 4) / (12 * 11) = 20 / 132 = 5/33.\n\nThen, 5/33 * 7/10 = (5 * 7) / (33 * 10) = 35 / 330 = 7/66.\n\nFinally, 7/66 * 6/9 = (7 * 6) / (66 * 9) = 42 / 594 = 7 / 99.\n\nSo, the probability for one specific sequence is 7/99.\n\nSince there are 6 such sequences, the total probability is 6 * (7/99) = 42/99 = 14/33.\n\nAgain, I get 14/33.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 14/33 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{33}} \\]"
