        "content": "I'm here to help you with your Python script that interacts with a Memcached server. I'll guide you through the process step by step. First, make sure you have Memcached installed and running on your system. You'll also need to install the `pymemcache` library, which is a Python client for Memcached. You can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pymemcache\n```\n\nOnce you have that set up, we can start writing the script. We'll create a simple command-line tool that allows users to set, get, delete keys, and list all stored keys in the Memcached server.\n\nHere's a basic outline of what the script will do:\n\n1. Connect to the Memcached server.\n2. Provide a menu for the user to choose actions: set, get, delete, list, or exit.\n3. Based on the user's choice, perform the corresponding operation.\n\nLet's start by importing the necessary modules and setting up the connection to the Memcached server.\n\n```python\nfrom pymemcache.client.base import Client\n\n# Connect to the Memcached server\nclient = Client(('127.0.0.1', 11211))\n```\n\nNext, we'll create a loop that presents a menu to the user and acts based on their input.\n\n```python\nwhile True:\n    print(\"\\nMemcached Interactive Script\")\n    print(\"1. Set key\")\n    print(\"2. Get key\")\n    print(\"3. Delete key\")\n    print(\"4. List all keys\")\n    print(\"5. Exit\")\n    \n    choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1-5): \")\n    \n    if choice == '1':\n        # Set key\n        key = input(\"Enter key: \")\n        value = input(\"Enter value: \")\n        client.set(key, value)\n        print(f\"Key '{key}' set to '{value}'\")\n    \n    elif choice == '2':\n        # Get key\n        key = input(\"Enter key: \")\n        value = client.get(key)\n        if value is not None:\n            print(f\"Value for key '{key}': {value.decode('utf-8')}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Key '{key}' not found\")\n    \n    elif choice == '3':\n        # Delete key\n        key = input(\"Enter key: \")\n        client.delete(key)\n        print(f\"Key '{key}' deleted\")\n    \n    elif choice == '4':\n        # List all keys\n        # Note: Memcached does not support listing all keys directly.\n        # This is a limitation of Memcached.\n        print(\"Memcached does not support listing all keys directly.\")\n    \n    elif choice == '5':\n        # Exit\n        print(\"Goodbye!\")\n        break\n    \n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please enter a number between 1 and 5.\")\n```\n\nThere's one important thing to note here: Memcached does not provide a direct way to list all stored keys. This is by design for performance reasons. If you need to list all keys, you might need to maintain a separate list or use a different caching solution that supports this feature.\n\nHowever, for the sake of completeness, if you still want to attempt to list keys, you can try iterating over possible keys, but this is not efficient and not recommended for production use.\n\nHere's an example of how you might attempt to list keys, but please be aware that this is inefficient and may not work as expected:\n\n```python\n    elif choice == '4':\n        # List all keys\n        # This is inefficient and not recommended for production use.\n        keys = []\n        for i in range(1000):  # Arbitrary range, adjust as needed\n            key = f\"key_{i}\"\n            if client.get(key) is not None:\n                keys.append(key)\n        if keys:\n            print(\"Stored keys:\", keys)\n        else:\n            print(\"No keys found\")\n```\n\nAgain, this approach is not efficient and is provided only for illustrative purposes. In a real-world scenario, you should consider maintaining a separate list of keys if you need to track them.\n\nThat's the basic script. You can run it, and it will allow you to set, get, delete keys, and attempt to list keys in Memcached. Remember to handle exceptions and edge cases as needed for a more robust script.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
