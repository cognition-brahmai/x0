        "content": "I'm here to help you with your Ruby script request. Let's break down the task step by step.\n\nFirst, you need to create a Ruby script that takes a URL as input from the user. Then, it should download the HTML content of that page. After downloading the HTML, you need to parse it to extract all the links and images present on the page. Finally, you should save these links and images into separate text files.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to handle errors properly, especially for cases where the URL is invalid or there are network issues that prevent the script from downloading the page.\n\nLet's start by discussing how to approach each part of this task.\n\n1. **Taking URL Input:**\n   - You can use the `gets` method to take input from the user in the console.\n\n2. **Downloading HTML Content:**\n   - To download the HTML content from a URL, you can use the `open` method from the `open-uri` library, which is part of Ruby's standard library.\n\n3. **Parsing HTML:**\n   - For parsing HTML, it's recommended to use a gem like Nokogiri, which is powerful and easy to use for extracting information from HTML and XML documents.\n\n4. **Extracting Links and Images:**\n   - Using Nokogiri, you can select all `<a>` tags for links and `<img>` tags for images, and then extract their `href` and `src` attributes respectively.\n\n5. **Saving to Text Files:**\n   - You can write the extracted links and images to separate text files using Ruby's file handling methods.\n\n6. **Error Handling:**\n   - You need to handle exceptions that may occur due to invalid URLs or network problems. Ruby's `rescue` blocks can be used for this purpose.\n\nBefore we proceed, do you have Nokogiri installed in your Ruby environment? If not, you'll need to install it using `gem install nokogiri`.\n\nAlso, are there any specific requirements for the output format of the text files? For example, should the links and images be listed one per line, or is there a particular format you need to follow?\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on any of these steps."
