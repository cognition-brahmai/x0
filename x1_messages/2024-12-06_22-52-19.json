        "content": "Let's see. There are 50 houses in the village, and each house has at least one cat. Each cat can catch exactly 3 mice per day, and altogether, the cats catch 150 mice per day. I need to find out how many cats there are in the village.\n\nFirst, I know that the total number of mice caught per day is 150, and each cat catches 3 mice per day. So, if I let the number of cats be C, then the total mice caught would be 3 times C, right? Because each cat catches 3 mice.\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 C = 150.\n\nTo find C, I can divide both sides by 3:\n\nC = 150 \u00f7 3 = 50.\n\nSo, there are 50 cats in the village.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that each house has at least one cat. With 50 houses, if each has at least one cat, that already accounts for 50 cats. If there were more cats, say some houses have more than one cat, then the total number of cats would be more than 50.\n\nHowever, in this case, the total number of mice caught is 150, which with each cat catching 3 mice, gives us exactly 50 cats. So, it seems that each house has exactly one cat.\n\nBut let's double-check. If there were more than one cat per house, the total number of cats would be more than 50, which would mean more mice caught, but the total is exactly 150, which matches 50 cats.\n\nAlternatively, if some houses had more cats, but others had just one, as long as the total number of cats is 50, the total mice caught would still be 150.\n\nWait a minute, but if some houses have more than one cat, and some have just one, but the total number of cats is still 50, then the distribution doesn't affect the total mice caught, as long as the total number of cats is 50.\n\nSo, the number of cats is definitely 50.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
