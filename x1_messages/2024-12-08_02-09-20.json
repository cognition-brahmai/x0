        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains moving towards each other. One leaves Town A going towards Town B at 60 miles per hour, and the other leaves Town B going towards Town A at 40 miles per hour. The distance between the two towns is 200 miles. I need to find out when they meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that since both trains are moving towards each other, their speeds add up. So, the relative speed at which they are approaching each other is 60 mph plus 40 mph, which is 100 mph.\n\nNow, if they are covering the distance of 200 miles together at a combined speed of 100 mph, I can find the time it takes for them to meet by dividing the distance by their combined speed. So, time equals distance divided by speed.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 200 miles / 100 mph\n\nTime = 2 hours\n\nSo, the trains will meet after 2 hours.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the distance each train covers in a given time and set up an equation where the sum of those distances equals the total distance between the towns.\n\nLet's denote the time until they meet as t hours.\n\nIn t hours, the first train travels 60t miles (since speed is 60 mph).\n\nIn the same t hours, the second train travels 40t miles (since speed is 40 mph).\n\nThe sum of these distances should equal the total distance between the towns, which is 200 miles.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n60t + 40t = 200\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n100t = 200\n\nNow, solving for t:\n\nt = 200 / 100\n\nt = 2 hours\n\nAgain, I get the same answer. That gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nMaybe I can think about it in terms of each train's position over time. For example, after 1 hour, the first train would have traveled 60 miles, and the second train would have traveled 40 miles, so together they would have covered 100 miles, leaving 100 miles still between them. After another hour, they each travel another 60 and 40 miles, respectively, covering an additional 100 miles, which adds up to 200 miles in total. So, indeed, they meet after 2 hours.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider one train stationary and the other approaching at the combined speed. If I consider the train from Town A as stationary, then the train from Town B is effectively moving towards it at 100 mph (60 mph + 40 mph). So, covering 200 miles at 100 mph would again take 2 hours.\n\nI think no matter how I approach this, the answer remains the same. The trains meet after 2 hours.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if the speeds were different or if the distance was different, but in this specific case, with the given speeds and distance, the answer is consistent.\n\nSo, the final answer is that the trains meet after 2 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
