        "content": "The term you're referring to is called \"cubing\" a number. When you multiply a number by itself three times, you are essentially calculating its cube. For example, if you have the number 2, cubing it would be 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2, which equals 8. So, 8 is the cube of 2. This operation is similar to finding the volume of a cube, where all sides are of equal length. The general formula for cubing a number 'n' is n\u00b3 = n \u00d7 n \u00d7 n."
