        "content": "Istanbul was formerly known as Constantinople. The city was originally founded as Byzantium by Greek colonists in the 7th century BC. In 330 AD, the Roman emperor Constantine the Great moved the capital of the Roman Empire from Rome to Byzantium and renamed it Constantinople in his honor. The city remained the capital of the Byzantine Empire until its conquest by the Ottoman Turks in 1453. After the Ottoman conquest, the city was renamed Istanbul, which is derived from the Greek phrase \"eis ten polin,\" meaning \"to the city.\" Today, Istanbul is a major cultural and economic hub, with a population of over 15 million people, and it continues to serve as a bridge between Europe and Asia."
