        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 houses on a street, each painted a different color: green, white, red, blue, and yellow. We need to figure out where the yellow house is located based on some clues.\n\nFirst, the blue house is the first one on the left. So, if we imagine the street with houses aligned from left to right, the leftmost house is blue.\n\nNext, the red house is in the middle. Since there are five houses, the middle one would be the third house from either end.\n\nThen, the green house is immediately to the right of the white house. That means the white house and the green house are next to each other, with green on the right side of white.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange these houses based on the clues.\n\nWe know:\n\n1. Blue is the first house on the left.\n\n2. Red is the third house.\n\n3. Green is immediately to the right of white.\n\nWe need to place yellow in the remaining spot.\n\nLet's list the positions from left to right as Position 1 to Position 5.\n\nGiven that blue is the first house:\n\nPosition 1: Blue\n\nPosition 2: ?\n\nPosition 3: Red\n\nPosition 4: ?\n\nPosition 5: ?\n\nNow, the green house is immediately to the right of the white house. So, wherever white is, green is next to it on the right.\n\nPossible pairs for white and green:\n\n- Position 2: White, Position 3: Green\n\n- Position 3: White, Position 4: Green\n\n- Position 4: White, Position 5: Green\n\nBut we know that position 3 is red, so white and green cannot be in positions 3 and 4 because position 3 is red. Similarly, position 3 is red, so position 2 and 3 cannot both be white and green because position 3 is red.\n\nTherefore, the only possible pair for white and green is position 4 and 5.\n\nSo:\n\nPosition 4: White\n\nPosition 5: Green\n\nWait, but position 3 is red, and position 4 is white, position 5 is green.\n\nThat seems to fit the condition that green is immediately to the right of white.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nPosition 1: Blue\n\nPosition 2: ?\n\nPosition 3: Red\n\nPosition 4: White\n\nPosition 5: Green\n\nThe only color left is yellow, so position 2 must be yellow.\n\nTherefore, the yellow house is in position 2, which is the second house from the left.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure this arrangement satisfies all the conditions.\n\n- Blue is first on the left: Yes, position 1 is blue.\n\n- Red is in the middle: Position 3 is red, which is the middle position.\n\n- Green is immediately to the right of white: White is in position 4, green in position 5, which satisfies this condition.\n\n- All houses have different colors: Blue, yellow, red, white, green \u2013 all distinct.\n\nSo, the yellow house is in the second position from the left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{second position from the left}} \\]"
