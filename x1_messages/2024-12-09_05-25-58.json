        "content": "Let's see. There are 27 people in the group, and each car can hold up to 4 passengers. So, to find out how many cars they need, I should divide the total number of people by the number of passengers per car.\n\n27 divided by 4 is 6.75. But you can't rent a fraction of a car, so they'll need to round up to the next whole number. That means they need 7 cars to accommodate everyone.\n\nNow, each car costs $30 per day, and the trip is 6 days long. So, the cost per car for the entire trip would be $30 multiplied by 6, which is $180 per car.\n\nSince they're renting 7 cars, the total cost would be 7 multiplied by $180, which equals $1,260.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. Maybe there's a way to optimize this. If 7 cars can hold up to 28 people (since 7 times 4 is 28), but there are only 27 people, so that works. But perhaps they could get away with fewer cars.\n\nLet's see, if they rent 6 cars, that's 24 seats, which is less than 27 people. So, that's not enough. Therefore, 7 cars is indeed the minimum they need.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some cars could hold fewer than 4 people if some people are willing to share rides or if some cars are used more efficiently. But based on the information given, each car can hold up to 4 passengers, and there are 27 people, so 7 cars are necessary.\n\nAnd the total cost would be 7 cars times $30 per day times 6 days, which is indeed $1,260.\n\nSo, the group needs to rent 7 cars, and the total cost for the 6-day trip would be $1,260.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7 \\text{ cars, } \\$1,260} \\]"
