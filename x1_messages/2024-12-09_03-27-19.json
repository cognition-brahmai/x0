        "content": "So I have this problem here about building a fence around a rectangular garden. The garden is 30 feet by 40 feet, and I need to build a fence around it with an additional 5 feet on each side. I need to find out what the perimeter of the fenced area will be.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. There's a rectangular garden that measures 30 feet by 40 feet. So, one side is 30 feet, and the other is 40 feet. Now, I'm supposed to build a fence around it, but not right against the garden. Instead, the fence is set back an additional 5 feet on each side.\n\nOkay, so that means the fenced area is going to be larger than the garden itself. I need to account for that extra 5 feet on all sides.\n\nLet me visualize this. If I have a rectangle that's 30 by 40 feet, and I'm adding 5 feet to each side, it's like expanding the garden by 5 feet in every direction.\n\nWait, but actually, since it's 5 feet on each side, I need to consider that for each dimension, the total addition is 10 feet because there are two sides for each dimension.\n\nLet me think again. If I have a rectangle that's 30 feet long and 40 feet wide, and I add 5 feet to each side, I need to add 5 feet to both the length and the width, but since there are two sides for each, I should add 10 feet to each dimension.\n\nWait, no. Let's be careful here.\n\nIf I have a rectangle, and I'm adding 5 feet on each side, that means for the length, which is 40 feet, I'm adding 5 feet to one end and 5 feet to the other end, so that's a total addition of 10 feet to the length. Similarly, for the width, which is 30 feet, adding 5 feet to both sides means adding a total of 10 feet to the width.\n\nSo, the new length will be 40 feet + 10 feet = 50 feet.\n\nAnd the new width will be 30 feet + 10 feet = 40 feet.\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of this new, larger rectangle, I can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2*(length + width).\n\nPlugging in the new dimensions: P = 2*(50 + 40) = 2*(90) = 180 feet.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the fence is surrounding the garden with a uniform border of 5 feet.\n\nSo, the fence is 5 feet away from the garden on all sides.\n\nTherefore, the fenced area is the garden plus twice the border width for each dimension.\n\nYes, that matches what I did earlier: 30 + 2*5 = 40 feet for width, and 40 + 2*5 = 50 feet for length.\n\nThen, perimeter is 2*(length + width) = 2*(50 + 40) = 2*90 = 180 feet.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if the additional 5 feet is added outside the garden on all sides.\n\nYes, that's what it says: \"an additional 5 feet on each side.\"\n\nSo, the fence is built 5 feet outside the garden on all sides.\n\nTherefore, for both length and width, the total addition is 10 feet each.\n\nSo, again, new dimensions are 40 + 10 = 50 feet, and 30 + 10 = 40 feet.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(50 + 40) = 180 feet.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the fence encloses the garden plus a 5-foot border around it.\n\nSo, the area enclosed by the fence is the garden plus a strip of 5 feet wide around it.\n\nIn that case, the dimensions would indeed be increased by 10 feet in total for each dimension.\n\nWait, but is there another way to look at this?\n\nLet me consider the positions.\n\nIf the garden is 30 feet by 40 feet, and the fence is 5 feet outside on all sides, then:\n\n- The fence's inner sides are 5 feet away from the garden's outer sides.\n\n- So, for the length: garden is 40 feet, plus 5 feet on one end, plus 5 feet on the other end, totaling 40 + 10 = 50 feet.\n\n- Similarly, for the width: 30 feet plus 5 feet on one side and 5 feet on the other, totaling 30 + 10 = 40 feet.\n\n- So, the fenced area is 50 feet by 40 feet.\n\n- Perimeter is 2*(50 + 40) = 2*90 = 180 feet.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the fence is built around the garden, enclosing the garden plus the 5-foot border, then:\n\n- The fence forms a rectangle that is larger than the garden by 5 feet on all sides.\n\n- So, again, adding 10 feet to each dimension: 40 + 10 = 50 feet, and 30 + 10 = 40 feet.\n\n- Perimeter calculation remains the same.\n\nI think I'm consistent in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if the additional 5 feet is only on one side or on all sides.\n\nThe problem says \"on each side,\" which implies all sides.\n\nSo, adding 5 feet to each side means adding 10 feet to each dimension.\n\nTherefore, the fenced area is 50 by 40 feet, and the perimeter is 180 feet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fence is built 5 feet away from the garden on all sides, which would indeed make the fenced area larger by 10 feet in length and width.\n\nWait, but let's think about it differently.\n\nSuppose the garden is positioned inside the fenced area, with a uniform border of 5 feet around it.\n\nThen, the distance from the garden to the fence is 5 feet on all sides.\n\nTherefore, the fenced area's dimensions would be:\n\n- Length: garden length + 2*(border width) = 40 + 2*5 = 50 feet.\n\n- Width: garden width + 2*(border width) = 30 + 2*5 = 40 feet.\n\n- Perimeter: 2*(50 + 40) = 180 feet.\n\nAlternatively, if the fence is only added 5 feet on one side, but the problem says \"on each side,\" which means all sides.\n\nSo, it's not just one side; it's all sides.\n\nTherefore, the total addition to each dimension is 10 feet.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the area of the fenced region, but since the question is only asking for the perimeter, I don't need to calculate the area.\n\nBut to verify, the area of the fenced region would be 50 feet by 40 feet, which is 2000 square feet, while the garden is 30 by 40, which is 1200 square feet.\n\nSo, the additional area is 2000 - 1200 = 800 square feet, which makes sense for a 5-foot border around the garden.\n\nWait, but actually, the garden is 30 by 40, which is 1200 square feet, and the fenced area is 50 by 40, which is 2000 square feet, so the difference is 800 square feet.\n\nBut if I calculate the area of the border, it should be the area between the garden and the fence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nThe question is only about the perimeter of the fenced area, not the area itself.\n\nSo, focusing back on that, I've calculated it to be 180 feet.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider?\n\nIs there any possibility that the fence is not rectangular, or that the sides are not straight?\n\nThe problem describes the garden as rectangular and the fence being built around it with equal additional space on each side, so it's reasonable to assume the fence is also rectangular.\n\nAdditionally, the problem doesn't mention any gates or openings that might affect the perimeter calculation, so I can ignore those.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the fenced area should indeed be 180 feet.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if the fence is built exactly 5 feet outside the garden on all sides, including the corners.\n\nIn that case, the fence would be parallel to the garden's sides, offset by 5 feet.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions would be increased by 10 feet in total for each dimension, as previously calculated.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the perimeter is 180 feet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the fence to be built around the garden, but not necessarily parallel to it.\n\nBut given that the garden is rectangular and the addition is uniform on all sides, it's logical to assume the fence is also rectangular.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is that the perimeter of the fenced area is 180 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]"
