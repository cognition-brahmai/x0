        "content": "To show that the function \\( f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 \\) is increasing on the interval \\([3, \\infty)\\), we need to analyze its first derivative. A function is increasing on an interval if its first derivative is positive on that interval.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of \\( f(x) \\):\n\n\\[ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6) \\]\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation:\n\n\\[ f'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 11 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine where this derivative is positive. To do this, we can analyze the quadratic function \\( f'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 11 \\).\n\nA quadratic function \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) opens upwards if \\( a > 0 \\) and downwards if \\( a < 0 \\). In this case, \\( a = 3 > 0 \\), so the parabola opens upwards.\n\nThe minimum value of \\( f'(x) \\) occurs at its vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ x = -\\frac{-12}{2 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{12}{6} = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the vertex is at \\( x = 2 \\). Since the parabola opens upwards, \\( f'(x) \\) increases as \\( x \\) moves away from 2 in either direction.\n\nWe are interested in the interval \\( [3, \\infty) \\). Let's evaluate \\( f'(x) \\) at \\( x = 3 \\):\n\n\\[ f'(3) = 3(3)^2 - 12(3) + 11 = 3 \\cdot 9 - 36 + 11 = 27 - 36 + 11 = 2 \\]\n\nSince \\( f'(3) = 2 > 0 \\), and \\( f'(x) \\) is increasing for \\( x > 2 \\), it follows that \\( f'(x) > 0 \\) for all \\( x \\geq 3 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( f(x) \\) is increasing on the interval \\( [3, \\infty) \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{The function } f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 \\text{ is increasing on the interval } [3, \\infty).}"
