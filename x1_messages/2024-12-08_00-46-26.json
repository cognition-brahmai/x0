        "content": "So, this is a really interesting and hypothetical question. Let's try to break it down and think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what would happen if every human on Earth blinked simultaneously. Blinking is the act of closing and opening your eyelids, which temporarily blocks light from entering your eyes, resulting in a brief period of darkness for you personally.\n\nNow, the question is asking about how long the world would be in darkness if everyone blinked at the same time. But, darkness in this context is a bit tricky because blinking affects individual vision, not the actual light levels in the environment.\n\nLet me clarify: when you blink, it's just your eyes closing for a split second, but the world around you still has the same amount of light. So, from an environmental perspective, there's no change in light levels; it's only the perception that changes.\n\nHowever, if we interpret \"darkness\" as the period when no one can see because everyone's eyes are closed, then it's a different story.\n\nLet's consider that perspective. If every human on Earth closed their eyes at the same time, there would be a moment when no one was able to see anything because all human eyes were shut.\n\nBut, how long does a blink last? The average blink lasts about 100 to 150 milliseconds. So, if everyone blinked simultaneously, the period of universal \"darkness\" would be around that duration\u2014let's say 150 milliseconds for this scenario.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. Not everyone blinks at the same speed. Some people might have faster blinks, and others might have slower ones. Also, there are people with different eye conditions or who might not blink simultaneously for some reason.\n\nMoreover, there are machines and animals that can perceive light as well. If we're talking about \"the world\" being in darkness, do we include non-human entities that can sense light?\n\nBut, to keep it simple, let's stick with human perception. So, if everyone blinks at the same time, and the longest blink lasts 150 milliseconds, then the world would be in a state of universal human darkness for that duration.\n\nHowever, there's another factor to consider: not everyone can blink simultaneously in reality. Coordinating every person on Earth to blink at exactly the same time is practically impossible. But, since this is a hypothetical scenario, we can assume that it's possible for the sake of the question.\n\nAlso, some people might have their eyes closed already for various reasons, and others might have eyes open. But again, in this hypothetical, we're assuming everyone blinks simultaneously.\n\nAnother point to consider is that even during a blink, some light might still enter around the edges of the eyelids for some people, but for the purpose of this question, let's assume that during the blink, no light enters the eyes.\n\nSo, in conclusion, if every human on Earth blinked simultaneously, the world would be in a state of universal human darkness for about 150 milliseconds, which is the average duration of a blink.\n\nBut, it's essential to remember that this darkness is only in terms of human perception; the actual light levels in the environment wouldn't change at all.\n\nIt's a fascinating thought experiment that plays with our understanding of perception versus reality.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150 \\text{ milliseconds}} \\]"
