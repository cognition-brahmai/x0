        "content": "Alright, here are five fun facts about the solar system for you:\n\n- **The Largest Planet Isn't Always the Heaviest:** Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, but it's not the heaviest. That title goes to Earth, which is denser and heavier than Jupiter, even though Jupiter is much bigger.\n\n- **The Sun Contains 99.86% of the Solar System's Mass:** Almost all the mass in the solar system is concentrated in the Sun. The planets, moons, asteroids, and comets make up only a tiny fraction of the total mass.\n\n- **Pluto Was Once Considered the Ninth Planet:** Pluto was discovered in 1930 and was classified as the ninth planet from the Sun until 2006 when it was reclassified as a \"dwarf planet\" by the International Astronomical Union.\n\n- **The Asteroid Belt Isn't Dense:** Contrary to what you might see in sci-fi movies, the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter isn't densely packed with asteroids. The asteroids are actually spread out, and the chance of a spacecraft colliding with one is very low.\n\n- **Venus is the Hottest Planet, Not Mercury:** Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus is hotter due to its thick atmosphere, which traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect. The surface temperature on Venus can reach a scorching 462 degrees Celsius (864 degrees Fahrenheit)."
