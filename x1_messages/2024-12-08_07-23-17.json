It was designed by Gustave Eiffel for the 1889 Exposition Universelle, which was held to celebrate the 100th year anniversary of the French Revolution. Initially, it was criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals, who thought it was an eyesore and didn't fit into the architecture of Paris. But over time, it has become a beloved symbol of Paris and France itself."
