Composers like Johann Sebastian Bach and Antonio Vivaldi were prominent during this period. The music of this era often featured complex polyphonic textures, where multiple independent melodic lines were woven together. This is in contrast to the homophonic textures that dominated the subsequent Classical period, where one melodic line was accompanied by chords. What is a key characteristic of Baroque music?\nA. Use of simple, repetitive rhythms\nB. Emphasis on a single melodic line\nC. Use of complex polyphonic textures\nD. Frequent use of the whole-tone scale"

        "content": "A key characteristic of Baroque music is the use of complex polyphonic textures. Polyphony involves the combination of two or more independent melodic lines to create a harmonious structure. This is in contrast to homophonic music, which features a single melodic line accompanied by chords.\n\nDuring the Baroque period, composers like Johann Sebastian Bach and Antonio Vivaldi mastered the art of polyphony, creating intricate and layered compositions. Bach's fugues and chorales are prime examples of polyphonic textures, where multiple voices enter in sequence, each contributing its own melodic line that intertwines with the others.\n\nThis complexity in texture was a hallmark of Baroque music, reflecting the era's appreciation for detailed craftsmanship and ornate artistic expressions. The Baroque period's emphasis on polyphony laid the groundwork for future developments in Western classical music, influencing harmony and counterpoint in subsequent epochs.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, the correct option is:\n\nC. Use of complex polyphonic textures"
