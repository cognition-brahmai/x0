        "content": "So the factory makes 1200 widgets each day, and it works for 6 days a week. To find out how many widgets are made in a week, I need to multiply the daily production by the number of days it operates weekly.\n\nSo, that's 1200 widgets per day times 6 days. Let me do the math:\n\n1200 \u00d7 6 = 7200.\n\nSo, the factory produces 7200 widgets in a week.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe there are holidays or maintenance days that affect production. But according to the question, the factory operates for 6 days a week, so I think 7200 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might influence the weekly production. For example, does the factory's production rate change on certain days? Is there any downtime or variation in daily output? The problem doesn't mention any of that, so I assume the production is constant at 1200 widgets per day for the 6 days it operates.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the factory might produce widgets on weekends. The problem states that it operates for 6 days a week, but doesn't specify which days. Maybe it runs on Saturdays and Sundays too. However, the question clearly says it operates for 6 days a week, so if a week has 7 days, that means there is one day off.\n\nBut again, since the question is straightforward, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The key information is:\n\n- Daily production: 1200 widgets\n\n- Operating days per week: 6\n\n- Weekly production: 1200 \u00d7 6 = 7200 widgets\n\nSo, the answer should be 7200 widgets per week.\n\nJust to double-check, let's imagine the factory operates from Monday to Saturday. That's 6 days. Each day, it produces 1200 widgets. So, total production would be:\n\nMonday: 1200\n\nTuesday: 1200\n\nWednesday: 1200\n\nThursday: 1200\n\nFriday: 1200\n\nSaturday: 1200\n\nTotal: 1200 \u00d7 6 = 7200\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that a week has 7 days and the factory operates for 6 days, then it's producing for all but one day of the week. But since it's producing at a constant rate on the days it operates, the total remains 7200 widgets per week.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here. The answer is 7200 widgets per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7200} \\]"
