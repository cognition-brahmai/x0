        "content": "So the farmer has a rectangular field that's 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to put a fence around the whole thing, but he needs to leave a 5-meter-wide opening for his tractor to go in and out. Okay, let's figure out how much fencing he'll need.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total perimeter of the field. Since it's a rectangle, the perimeter is calculated by adding up all four sides. So, that would be twice the length plus twice the width. Let's plug in the numbers:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * length + 2 * width\n          = 2 * 120 meters + 2 * 80 meters\n          = 240 meters + 160 meters\n          = 400 meters\n\nSo, the total perimeter is 400 meters. But he's leaving a 5-meter opening for the tractor, which means he doesn't need fencing for those 5 meters.\n\nTherefore, the amount of fencing needed is the total perimeter minus the opening.\n\nFencing needed = Perimeter - opening\n               = 400 meters - 5 meters\n               = 395 meters\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me visualize this. Imagine a rectangle: length 120 meters, width 80 meters. The perimeter is 400 meters, as calculated. Now, if he leaves a 5-meter opening, it's like subtracting that section from the fencing.\n\nBut, does the opening affect any corners or anything? Hmm.\n\nActually, no, because it's just a straight opening, probably in one of the sides. So, whether it's in the length or the width, it's just a 5-meter section that doesn't need fencing.\n\nSo, yes, fencing needed is 400 meters minus 5 meters, which is 395 meters.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{395} \\]"
