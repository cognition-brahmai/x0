        "content": "So I have this power series: the sum from n=0 to infinity of ((x-2)^n)/n!. I need to find the radius of convergence for this series. I remember there's a formula or a test to determine the radius of convergence for power series, but I can't recall it off the top of my head. Maybe I should look into the ratio test or something similar.\n\nLet me think about the ratio test. The ratio test involves taking the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of a_{n+1}/a_n, where a_n is the general term of the series. For a power series, this would help me find the interval where the series converges absolutely.\n\nSo, for my series, a_n = ((x-2)^n)/n!. Therefore, a_{n+1} = ((x-2)^{n+1})/(n+1)!.\n\nNow, I need to compute the limit as n approaches infinity of |a_{n+1}/a_n|.\n\nLet's calculate a_{n+1}/a_n:\n\na_{n+1}/a_n = [((x-2)^{n+1})/(n+1)!] / [((x-2)^n)/n!] = ((x-2)^{n+1})/(n+1)! * n!/((x-2)^n) = (x-2)/(n+1).\n\nNow, take the absolute value: |(x-2)/(n+1)|.\n\nNow, take the limit as n approaches infinity: lim (n\u2192\u221e) |(x-2)/(n+1)|.\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the denominator (n+1) grows without bound, so the whole expression approaches 0, regardless of the value of x.\n\nSo, the limit is 0, which is less than 1 for all x. According to the ratio test, if this limit is less than 1, the series converges absolutely.\n\nThis suggests that the series converges for all real numbers x. But I'm supposed to find the radius of convergence. Does this mean the radius of convergence is infinite?\n\nWait, I think so. The radius of convergence R is such that the series converges for |x - c| < R and diverges for |x - c| > R. In this case, since the series converges for all x, that means R is infinite.\n\nLet me double-check this. Maybe I should consider the root test as well.\n\nThe root test involves computing lim (n\u2192\u221e) of the n-th root of |a_n|.\n\nSo, for my series, a_n = ((x-2)^n)/n!.\n\nCompute the n-th root: |a_n|^{1/n} = |((x-2)^n)/n!|^{1/n} = |x-2|/((n!)^{1/n}).\n\nNow, what's the limit as n approaches infinity of (n!)^{1/n}?\n\nI recall that n! grows very rapidly, and it's known that (n!)^{1/n} approaches infinity as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut actually, I think more precisely, (n!)^{1/n} behaves like n/e as n gets large, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up Stirling's approximation. Stirling's approximation says that n! is approximately (n/e)^n * sqrt(2\u03c0n).\n\nSo, (n!)^{1/n} \u2248 (n/e) * (2\u03c0n)^{1/(2n)}.\n\nAs n approaches infinity, (2\u03c0n)^{1/(2n)} approaches 1, since any number to the power of 0 is 1.\n\nTherefore, (n!)^{1/n} \u2248 n/e.\n\nSo, lim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_n|^{1/n} = |x-2| / (n/e) = |x-2| * (e/n).\n\nAgain, as n approaches infinity, n in the denominator makes the whole expression approach 0, which is less than 1 for all x.\n\nSo, again, this suggests that the series converges for all x, meaning the radius of convergence is infinite.\n\nAlternatively, I know that the exponential function e^x has a power series expansion: e^x = \u03a3 (x^n)/n!, which has an infinite radius of convergence. My series looks similar, but it's centered at x=2: \u03a3 ((x-2)^n)/n! .\n\nIn fact, this series is the Taylor series expansion of e^{x-2}, which is equal to (e^x)/(e^2).\n\nSince the exponential function has an infinite radius of convergence, and my series is just a shifted version of it, it should also have an infinite radius of convergence.\n\nWait a minute, to confirm, let's recall that the function e^{x-2} is entire, meaning it's analytic everywhere on the complex plane, which implies that its power series converges for all x.\n\nTherefore, the radius of convergence is indeed infinite.\n\nSo, to summarize, using the ratio test, the root test, and recognizing the series as the expansion of e^{x-2}, I can confidently say that the radius of convergence is infinite.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the definition of radius of convergence.\n\nThe radius of convergence R is given by 1/R = lim sup (n\u2192\u221e) of the n-th root of |a_n|.\n\nIn this case, since lim (n\u2192\u221e) of the n-th root of |a_n| is 0, that implies R = \u221e.\n\nAlternatively, using the ratio test, lim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_{n+1}/a_n| = 0 < 1 for all x, which again indicates that the series converges for all x.\n\nTherefore, the radius of convergence is infinity.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The series converges for all real numbers x, so the radius of convergence is infinite.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\infty} \\]"
