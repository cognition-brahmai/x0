        "content": "The primary role of the fully connected layers in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is to classify the features extracted by the convolutional layers. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nE. To classify the features extracted by the convolutional layers\n\nTo elaborate, CNNs are specifically designed to handle data with a grid structure, such as images, where the local relationships between pixels are important. The architecture of a CNN typically consists of several components:\n\n1. **Convolutional Layers**: These layers apply a convolution operation to the input, which involves passing a filter or kernel over the input data to produce a feature map. The filter helps in detecting specific features like edges, textures, etc., in the image. Multiple filters can be used in a layer to capture various features.\n\n2. **Pooling Layers**: Often added after convolutional layers, pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, thereby decreasing the computational complexity and preventing overfitting. Common types of pooling include max-pooling and average-pooling.\n\n3. **Fully Connected Layers**: These layers connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next layer. After the convolutional and pooling layers have extracted and reduced the features, the fully connected layers take these features as input and produce the final classification output. Essentially, they learn to combine the high-level features extracted by the previous layers to make predictions.\n\nSo, while the convolutional layers are responsible for feature extraction, the fully connected layers handle the classification task based on those extracted features. This division of labor makes CNNs highly effective for image recognition and classification tasks."
