        "content": "To create a Java program that reads a CSV file containing employee information and stores it in an ArrayList of Employee objects, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Employee Class**: This class will have properties for ID, name, age, and department, along with getters and setters.\n\n2. **Read the CSV File**: Use a CSV parsing library or manually read the file to extract employee data and create Employee objects.\n\n3. **Store Employees in an ArrayList**: Collect all Employee objects in an ArrayList.\n\n4. **Implement Sorting Methods**: Create methods to sort the ArrayList based on different criteria such as ID, name, age, or department.\n\nFor this example, I'll use the OpenCSV library to handle CSV file reading, as it simplifies the process. If you don't have OpenCSV, you can add it to your project via Maven or download the JAR manually.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Employee Class\n\n```java\npublic class Employee {\n    private int id;\n    private String name;\n    private int age;\n    private String department;\n\n    // Constructor\n    public Employee(int id, String name, int age, String department) {\n        this.id = id;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = age;\n        this.department = department;\n    }\n\n    // Getters and Setters\n    public int getId() {\n        return id;\n    }\n\n    public void setId(int id) {\n        this.id = id;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public void setName(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public int getAge() {\n        return age;\n    }\n\n    public void setAge(int age) {\n        this.age = age;\n    }\n\n    public String getDepartment() {\n        return department;\n    }\n\n    public void setDepartment(String department) {\n        this.department = department;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"Employee [id=\" + id + \", name=\" + name + \", age=\" + age + \", department=\" + department + \"]\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Read the CSV File\n\nWe'll use OpenCSV to read the CSV file. First, ensure you have the OpenCSV library in your project.\n\n```xml\n<!-- Add this to your pom.xml if using Maven -->\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>com.opencsv</groupId>\n    <artifactId>opencsv</artifactId>\n    <version>5.5.2</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n### Step 3: Store Employees in an ArrayList\n\nCreate a class to handle file reading and sorting.\n\n```java\nimport com.opencsv.CSVReader;\nimport com.opencsv.exceptions.CsvException;\n\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Collections;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class EmployeeManager {\n\n    private List<Employee> employees;\n\n    public EmployeeManager(String csvFile) {\n        employees = new ArrayList<>();\n        readCSV(csvFile);\n    }\n\n    private void readCSV(String csvFile) {\n        try (CSVReader reader = new CSVReader(new FileReader(csvFile))) {\n            String[] line;\n            while ((line = reader.readNext()) != null) {\n                if (line.length >= 4) {\n                    int id = Integer.parseInt(line[0]);\n                    String name = line[1];\n                    int age = Integer.parseInt(line[2]);\n                    String department = line[3];\n                    employees.add(new Employee(id, name, age, department));\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (IOException | CsvException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Method to sort by ID\n    public void sortById() {\n        Collections.sort(employees, (e1, e2) -> Integer.compare(e1.getId(), e2.getId()));\n    }\n\n    // Method to sort by name\n    public void sortByName() {\n        Collections.sort(employees, (e1, e2) -> e1.getName().compareTo(e2.getName()));\n    }\n\n    // Method to sort by age\n    public void sortByAge() {\n        Collections.sort(employees, (e1, e2) -> Integer.compare(e1.getAge(), e2.getAge()));\n    }\n\n    // Method to sort by department\n    public void sortByDepartment() {\n        Collections.sort(employees, (e1, e2) -> e1.getDepartment().compareTo(e2.getDepartment()));\n    }\n\n    // Method to print all employees\n    public void printEmployees() {\n        for (Employee e : employees) {\n            System.out.println(e);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        EmployeeManager manager = new EmployeeManager(\"employees.csv\");\n        \n        System.out.println(\" Sorted by ID \");\n        manager.sortById();\n        manager.printEmployees();\n        \n        System.out.println(\"\\n Sorted by Name \");\n        manager.sortByName();\n        manager.printEmployees();\n        \n        System.out.println(\"\\n Sorted by Age \");\n        manager.sortByAge();\n        manager.printEmployees();\n        \n        System.out.println(\"\\n Sorted by Department \");\n        manager.sortByDepartment();\n        manager.printEmployees();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Employee Class**: Represents an employee with ID, name, age, and department. Includes getters, setters, and a constructor.\n\n2. **EmployeeManager Class**: Handles reading the CSV file and sorting the employee list.\n   - **readCSV Method**: Reads the CSV file using OpenCSV and creates Employee objects.\n   - **Sorting Methods**: Use `Collections.sort` with lambda expressions to sort the list based on different criteria.\n   - **printEmployees Method**: Prints all employees in the list.\n\n3. **Main Method**: Demonstrates reading the CSV file and sorting the employees by ID, name, age, and department, then printing the results.\n\nMake sure your CSV file (`employees.csv`) is formatted correctly, with columns in the order: ID, name, age, department.\n\nThis approach ensures that the employee data is handled efficiently and can be sorted easily based on different attributes."
