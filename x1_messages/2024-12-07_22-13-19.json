        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a sports event organizer planning a marathon with 5,000 participants. Each participant pays a registration fee of $50. The organizer wants to donate 25% of the total revenue from these registration fees to a local charity. We need to find out how much will be donated to the charity.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total revenue generated from the registration fees. Since there are 5,000 participants and each pays $50, I can find the total revenue by multiplying the number of participants by the registration fee per participant.\n\nTotal revenue = Number of participants \u00d7 Registration fee per participant\nTotal revenue = 5,000 \u00d7 $50\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication:\n\n5,000 \u00d7 50 = 250,000\n\nSo, the total revenue from registration fees is $250,000.\n\nNext, the organizer wants to donate 25% of this total revenue to a local charity. To find out how much that is, I need to calculate 25% of $250,000.\n\nDonation amount = Total revenue \u00d7 Donation percentage\nDonation amount = $250,000 \u00d7 25%\n\nBut percentages can be tricky, so I'll convert the percentage to a decimal to make the calculation easier. Remember that 25% is the same as 25/100, which is 0.25.\n\nDonation amount = $250,000 \u00d7 0.25\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication:\n\n250,000 \u00d7 0.25 = 62,500\n\nTherefore, the total amount that will be donated to the charity is $62,500.\n\nJust to double-check, let's go through the steps again.\n\n1. Calculate total revenue:\n\n5,000 participants \u00d7 $50 per participant = $250,000\n\n2. Calculate 25% of $250,000:\n\n$250,000 \u00d7 0.25 = $62,500\n\nEverything checks out. So, the charity will receive $62,500.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. But wait a minute, does the registration fee cover all the costs, or is there any profit involved? The problem says that the registration fee covers the cost of organizing the event, water stations, medical support, and finisher medals. So, it seems like the $50 per participant is just enough to cover the expenses, and any amount beyond that would be profit.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't specify if there are any expenses beyond what's covered by the registration fees. It says that the registration fee covers the costs, so presumably, the total revenue is equal to the total costs. But the organizer still wants to donate 25% of the total revenue to charity.\n\nWait a second, if the registration fee exactly covers the costs, then donating 25% of the revenue would mean that the organizer is donating 25% of the costs to charity. Is that what's happening here?\n\nLet me re-read the problem to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\n\"A sports event organizer is planning a marathon race that will have 5,000 participants. Each participant must pay a registration fee of $50, which covers the cost of organizing the event, as well as providing water stations, medical support, and finisher medals. Additionally, the organizer wants to donate 25% of the total revenue generated from registration fees to a local charity. Calculate the total amount that will be donated to the charity and provide step-by-step reasoning.\"\n\nSo, the registration fee of $50 per participant covers all the costs associated with the event, including water stations, medical support, and finisher medals. Additionally, the organizer wants to donate 25% of the total revenue from these registration fees to charity.\n\nIn other words, after covering all the costs, the organizer wants to take 25% of the total revenue and give it to charity.\n\nBut if the registration fee exactly covers the costs, then donating 25% of the revenue would mean that the organizer is donating 25% of the costs to charity. Is that possible? Or does it mean that the organizer is donating 25% of the revenue beyond costs?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider whether the registration fee covers the costs or if there's a profit involved.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the registration fee covers the costs, and any amount beyond that is profit, which the organizer wants to donate 25% of.\n\nBut according to the problem, the registration fee covers the costs, so there shouldn't be any profit. So, donating 25% of the total revenue would mean donating 25% of the costs.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense because it would mean that the organizer is giving away 25% of what was spent on the event.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the organizer is willing to cover the costs and still donate 25% of the revenue to charity, meaning that they are subsidizing the charity donation themselves.\n\nBut the problem states that the registration fee covers the costs, so perhaps the donation is coming out of the organizer's pocket, separate from the registration fees.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"donate 25% of the total revenue generated from registration fees to a local charity.\" So, it's 25% of the revenue from registration fees, which is $250,000, so $62,500, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut if the registration fees exactly cover the costs, then donating 25% of the revenue would mean that the organizer is covering that donation out of their own funds, in addition to covering the costs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the registration fee includes the cost plus the donation, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nWait, let's look at the problem again:\n\n\"Each participant must pay a registration fee of $50, which covers the cost of organizing the event, as well as providing water stations, medical support, and finisher medals. Additionally, the organizer wants to donate 25% of the total revenue generated from registration fees to a local charity.\"\n\nSo, the registration fee covers the costs, and on top of that, the organizer wants to donate 25% of the revenue to charity.\n\nThis suggests that the registration fee is $50, which covers all the expenses, and separately, the organizer is committing to donate 25% of the total revenue to charity.\n\nTherefore, the donation is coming from the organizer's funds, in addition to the costs covered by the registration fees.\n\nSo, the total amount donated is 25% of $250,000, which is $62,500, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the $50 registration fee covers costs and the donation combined.\n\nBut the problem says that the $50 covers the costs, and separately, the organizer wants to donate 25% of the revenue to charity.\n\nTherefore, the donation is an additional 25% of the revenue, which is $62,500.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider the following:\n\nTotal revenue = 5,000 participants \u00d7 $50 = $250,000\n\nDonation = 25% of $250,000 = $62,500\n\nSo, the organizer is donating $62,500 to charity, in addition to covering the costs from the $250,000 revenue.\n\nAlternatively, if the registration fee covers both the costs and the donation, then the calculation would be different.\n\nBut according to the problem, the registration fee covers the costs, and separately, the organizer wants to donate 25% of the revenue to charity.\n\nTherefore, the donation is $62,500.\n\nI think that's the correct interpretation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{62500} \\]"
