        "content": "Certainly! To solve this problem, we'll implement a dynamic programming approach to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an array of integers. The key idea is to build up solutions for smaller subproblems and use those to construct solutions for larger subproblems.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initialization**: We'll create an array `dp` where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending with the element at index `i`. We initialize each `dp[i]` to 1 because the minimum length of LIS ending at any element is 1 (the element itself).\n\n2. **Filling the dp array**: For each element in the array, we compare it with all previous elements. If the current element is greater than a previous element, it can be part of the increasing subsequence ending with the current element. We update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, where `j` is an index less than `i`.\n\n3. **Finding the maximum value in dp**: The length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in the `dp` array.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the LIS length with a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the array.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```javascript\nfunction lengthOfLIS(nums) {\n    if (nums.length === 0) return 0;\n\n    const dp = new Array(nums.length).fill(1);\n\n    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {\n        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n            if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {\n                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return Math.max(...dp);\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**: We handle the edge case where the input array is empty by returning 0. We initialize the `dp` array with 1s because the smallest LIS for any single element is 1.\n\n2. **Filling the dp array**: We use two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from the second element to the end of the array. The inner loop iterates from the start of the array up to the current element of the outer loop. For each pair of elements `(i, j)`, if `nums[i] > nums[j]`, it means we can extend the subsequence ending at `j` by including `i`, so we update `dp[i]` accordingly.\n\n3. **Finding the maximum value in dp**: After filling the `dp` array, the length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in the `dp` array, which we find using `Math.max(...dp)`.\n\nThis method ensures that we compute the LIS length efficiently and correctly for any given array of integers."
