        "content": "So I have this investment problem here. I'm supposed to find out how much $1,000 will grow to after 4 years with an annual interest rate of 6%, and it's compounded annually. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for compound interest. I think it's something like A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount, which is the initial amount of money, so that's $1,000.\n\n- r is the annual interest rate, which is 6%, but I need to write that as a decimal, so that's 0.06.\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's compounded annually, that means once per year, so n = 1.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years, which is 4 years.\n\nSo plugging these values into the formula, I get:\n\nA = 1000 * (1 + 0.06/1)^(1*4)\n\nSimplifying inside the parentheses first:\n\n1 + 0.06/1 = 1 + 0.06 = 1.06\n\nThen raise that to the power of 4:\n\n1.06^4\n\nI'm not sure what 1.06 to the power of 4 is off the top of my head, so maybe I should calculate it step by step.\n\nFirst, 1.06 squared:\n\n1.06 * 1.06 = 1.1236\n\nThen, 1.1236 squared:\n\n1.1236 * 1.1236\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1.1236 * 1.1236 = (1.12 * 1.12) + (1.12 * 0.0036) + (0.0036 * 1.12) + (0.0036 * 0.0036)\n\nWait, that's getting complicated. Maybe I should just use a calculator for this part.\n\nAssuming I have a calculator, 1.06^4 is approximately 1.2625\n\nSo, A = 1000 * 1.2625 = 1262.5\n\nWait, but I think that might not be entirely accurate. Let me check the value of 1.06 to the power of 4 again.\n\n1.06^1 = 1.06\n\n1.06^2 = 1.1236\n\n1.06^3 = 1.1236 * 1.06 = 1.191016\n\n1.06^4 = 1.191016 * 1.06 = 1.26247696\n\nSo, A = 1000 * 1.26247696 \u2248 1262.48\n\nTherefore, after 4 years, the investment will be worth approximately $1,262.48.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the simple interest formula and comparing it to see if compound interest really makes a difference.\n\nThe simple interest formula is I = PRT, where I is the interest, P is the principal, R is the rate, and T is the time.\n\nSo, I = 1000 * 0.06 * 4 = 240\n\nTherefore, the total amount would be 1000 + 240 = 1240\n\nBut with compound interest, it's 1262.48, which is higher. That makes sense because compound interest earns interest on the accumulated interest from previous periods.\n\nAlternatively, I could look at it year by year to see how the amount grows each year.\n\nYear 0: $1,000.00\n\nYear 1: $1,000 + (0.06 * $1,000) = $1,060.00\n\nYear 2: $1,060 + (0.06 * $1,060) = $1,060 * 1.06 = $1,123.60\n\nYear 3: $1,123.60 + (0.06 * $1,123.60) = $1,123.60 * 1.06 = $1,191.02\n\nYear 4: $1,191.02 + (0.06 * $1,191.02) = $1,191.02 * 1.06 = $1,262.48\n\nSo, after 4 years, it's indeed $1,262.48.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use the compound interest formula specifically for annual compounding, it simplifies to A = P(1 + r)^t\n\nSince n = 1, (1 + r/n)^(nt) becomes (1 + r)^t.\n\nSo, A = 1000 * (1 + 0.06)^4 = 1000 * (1.06)^4 = 1000 * 1.26247696 \u2248 1262.48\n\nThis matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the amount.\n\nIs there any taxation on the interest earned? The problem doesn't mention anything about taxes, so I'll assume that the interest is tax-free for the purpose of this calculation.\n\nAlso, is there any fee or deduction from the investment? Again, the problem doesn't mention any fees, so I'll ignore them.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the timing of the compounding. The problem says \"compounded annually,\" so once per year, which aligns with the formula I used.\n\nIf it were compounded more frequently, like quarterly or monthly, the amount would be different, but in this case, it's annually.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after 4 years, the investment of $1,000 at an annual interest rate of 6% compounded annually will be worth approximately $1,262.48.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1262.48} \\]"
