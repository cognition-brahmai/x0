        "content": "So I have this game where I start with 100 points. Each time I lose, my score gets halved. I need to figure out what my score is after losing 6 times. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I start with 100 points. If I lose once, my score gets halved, so it becomes 100 / 2 = 50 points.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. Now, if I lose again, my score gets halved again. So, 50 / 2 = 25 points.\n\n Losing third time: 25 / 2 = 12.5 points.\n\n Fourth loss: 12.5 / 2 = 6.25 points.\n\n Fifth loss: 6.25 / 2 = 3.125 points.\n\n And finally, the sixth loss: 3.125 / 2 = 1.5625 points.\n\nSo, after losing 6 times, my score would be 1.5625 points.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to calculate this without halving the score each time manually? Maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use.\n\nLet me see: each loss halves the score, which means it's like multiplying the score by 1/2 each time.\n\nSo, starting with 100 points, after one loss: 100 * (1/2)^1 = 50.\n\nAfter two losses: 100 * (1/2)^2 = 25.\n\nAfter three losses: 100 * (1/2)^3 = 12.5.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, after six losses, it would be 100 * (1/2)^6.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, (1/2)^6 = 1/64.\n\nSo, 100 * (1/64) = 100/64.\n\nSimplifying that, 100 divided by 64 is 1.5625.\n\nSo, again, I get 1.5625 points.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier by halving each time.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using exponents or logarithms?\n\nWell, since each loss is halving the score, it's an exponential decay with a base of 1/2.\n\nSo, the formula is initial score times (1/2) raised to the number of losses.\n\nIn this case, 100 * (1/2)^6 = 100 * 1/64 = 1.5625.\n\nI think that's pretty much it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if I can express it in terms of exponents.\n\n100 * (1/2)^6 = 100 * 2^-6.\n\nSince 1/2 is 2^-1, and (2^-1)^6 = 2^-6.\n\nSo, 100 * 2^-6.\n\nCalculating 2^6 = 64, so 2^-6 = 1/64.\n\nTherefore, 100 * 1/64 = 1.5625.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nI guess I've confirmed it multiple ways.\n\nSo, final answer: 1.5625 points.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.5625} \\]"
