        "content": "So the factory currently produces 200 widgets per day, and they want to increase that by 50%. So, to find out how many more widgets that is, I need to calculate 50% of 200.\n\nFirst, I'll find 50% of 200. Percentage means per hundred, so 50% is the same as 50/100 or 0.5. So, 0.5 times 200 is 100. That means they're increasing production by 100 widgets per day.\n\nNow, to find the total production after the increase, I just add that 100 to the original 200. So, 200 plus 100 equals 300 widgets per day.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe instead of calculating the increase separately and then adding it, I could just multiply the original production by 1 plus the percentage increase.\n\nSo, if I take 200 and multiply it by 1.5 (since 100% plus 50% is 150%, or 1.5 in decimal form), that should give me the new production rate directly.\n\nLet me try that: 200 times 1.5. 200 times 1 is 200, and 200 times 0.5 is 100, so adding those together gives 300 again.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. So, the factory will produce 300 widgets per day after the increase.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other factor that could affect this. For example, are there any constraints on the factory's capacity? Does the factory have the resources to actually produce 300 widgets per day?\n\nThe question doesn't mention any constraints, so I think it's safe to assume that the factory can meet this increased production target.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm answering the question correctly. The question asks for the number of widgets produced per day after the increase, and I've calculated that to be 300. So, I think that's the final answer.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider another approach. If 200 is 100%, then 50% more would be 150% of 200. So, 150% of 200 is indeed 300.\n\nAlternatively, I could use proportions. If 100% is 200, then 150% is x. So, x equals (150/100) times 200, which again is 300.\n\nAll these different methods lead me to the same conclusion, so I'm confident that 300 is the correct answer.\n\nI don't think there's anything else I need to consider here. The question is straightforward, and I've verified the answer using multiple approaches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
