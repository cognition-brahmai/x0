        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Quick sort is a very efficient sorting algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer principle. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how Quick sort works:\n\n1. **Choose a pivot element**: This can be any element in the array, but common choices are the first element, the last element, or the median element.\n\n2. **Partitioning**: Rearrange the array so that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position.\n\n3. **Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-array of elements less than the pivot and to the sub-array of elements greater than the pivot.**\n\nNow, let's implement this in Java.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement the Quick Sort algorithm in Java, we need to follow the divide-and-conquer approach where we select a pivot element and partition the array around it. Here\u2019s the complete code for Quick Sort:\n\n```java\npublic class QuickSort {\n\n    public static void quickSort(int[] array, int low, int high) {\n        if (low < high) {\n            int pi = partition(array, low, high);\n            quickSort(array, low, pi - 1);\n            quickSort(array, pi + 1, high);\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static int partition(int[] array, int low, int high) {\n        int pivot = array[high];\n        int i = low - 1;\n        for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {\n            if (array[j] < pivot) {\n                i++;\n                // Swap array[i] and array[j]\n                int temp = array[i];\n                array[i] = array[j];\n                array[j] = temp;\n            }\n        }\n        // Swap array[i+1] and array[high] (or pivot)\n        int temp = array[i + 1];\n        array[i + 1] = array[high];\n        array[high] = temp;\n        return i + 1;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] array = {10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5};\n        int n = array.length;\n        quickSort(array, 0, n - 1);\n        System.out.println(\"Sorted array: \");\n        for (int num : array) {\n            System.out.print(num + \" \");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **quickSort Method**:\n    - This is the main method that implements the Quick Sort algorithm.\n    - It takes the array and the low and high indices of the portion of the array to be sorted.\n    - If the low index is less than the high index, it calls the `partition` method to find the pivot index and then recursively sorts the sub-arrays to the left and right of the pivot.\n\n2. **partition Method**:\n    - This method selects the pivot element (in this case, the last element of the array portion).\n    - It rearranges the elements in the array such that all elements less than the pivot are moved to the left of the pivot, and all elements greater than the pivot are moved to the right.\n    - It returns the index of the pivot element after partitioning.\n\n3. **main Method**:\n    - This is the entry point of the program.\n    - It initializes an array of integers.\n    - Calls the `quickSort` method to sort the array.\n    - Prints the sorted array.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the array is sorted in ascending order using the Quick Sort algorithm. The choice of the pivot is crucial for the performance of the algorithm, and in this code, we have chosen the last element as the pivot for simplicity. Other strategies, like choosing the median or a random element, can be used to improve performance on certain types of input data."
