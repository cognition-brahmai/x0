        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 units of product A per day, and each unit of product A requires 3 units of raw material B. So, every day, the factory uses 500 units of A times 3 units of B per A, which is 1500 units of B per day.\n\nNow, the factory has enough raw material B to produce 4500 units of product A. Wait, but each unit of A requires 3 units of B, so 4500 units of A would require 4500 times 3, which is 13,500 units of B.\n\nSo, if the factory uses 1500 units of B each day, and they have 13,500 units of B in total, then the number of days they can continue production is 13,500 divided by 1500, which is 9 days.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If they produce 500 units of A per day, and each A requires 3 units of B, then daily consumption of B is indeed 1500 units. And with 13,500 units of B, dividing that by 1500 per day gives 9 days.\n\nAlternatively, since they can produce 4500 units of A in total with the available B, and they produce 500 units of A per day, then 4500 divided by 500 is also 9 days.\n\nSo, both ways, it seems like the factory can continue production for 9 days without running out of raw material B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
