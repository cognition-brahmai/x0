        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 6 black socks and 4 white socks, making a total of 10 socks. The question is, if you pick two socks at random without looking, what's the probability that both socks are black?\n\nAlright, probability questions can sometimes trip me up, but let's break this down step by step. I know that probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total number of ways to pick two socks out of the ten. Since the order doesn't matter (picking sock A first and sock B second is the same as picking sock B first and sock A second), this is a combination problem. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose. So, for the total number of ways to pick two socks out of ten:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 2) = \\frac{10!}{2!(10 - 2)!} = \\frac{10!}{2! \\times 8!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = 45\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 45 possible ways to pick any two socks from the box.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to pick two black socks. There are 6 black socks, so again, using the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(6 - 2)!} = \\frac{6!}{2! \\times 4!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 15 ways to pick two black socks.\n\nNow, the probability that both socks are black is the number of favorable outcomes (picking two black socks) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (picking any two socks):\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both black}) = \\frac{15}{45} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check. Another way to approach this is to think about it step by step. First, the probability of picking one black sock out of the ten, and then, given that the first was black, the probability of picking another black sock.\n\nThe probability of the first sock being black is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{first black}) = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\n\nThen, since there are now 5 black socks left and a total of 9 socks left, the probability of the second sock being black given that the first was black is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{second black} | \\text{first black}) = \\frac{5}{9}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability of both socks being black is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both black}) = P(\\text{first black}) \\times P(\\text{second black} | \\text{first black}) = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{15}{45} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier. So, the probability is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Maybe using probabilities without combinations. The total number of ways to pick two socks is 10 choose 2, which is 45, and the number of ways to pick two black socks is 6 choose 2, which is 15. So, again, \\(\\frac{15}{45} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the positions. For example, the probability that the first sock is black and the second sock is black. But that's essentially what I did earlier.\n\nWait, is there a way that the order matters here? Like, picking two black socks in a specific order. But no, since the problem doesn't specify order, it's just about both being black, so order shouldn't matter.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I'm missing. Are there any dependencies or special conditions? For example, are the socks being picked with replacement? The problem says \"without looking,\" but it doesn't mention replacement, so I assume it's without replacement, which is what I've done.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the socks are indistinguishable except for their color, which seems to be the case. So, yes, my approach should be correct.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's think about the general formula for probability without replacement:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B|A)\n\\]\n\nIn this case, A is picking a black sock first, and B is picking a black sock second given that the first was black.\n\nWhich is exactly what I did:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both black}) = \\frac{6}{10} \\times \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
