        "content": "Let's see. There are 120 students in total, and 75% of them wear glasses. I need to find out how many students do not wear glasses.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many students wear glasses. Since 75% of them wear glasses, I can calculate that by taking 75% of 120.\n\nTo calculate 75% of 120, I can multiply 120 by 0.75. Let me do that:\n\n120 \u00d7 0.75 = 90\n\nSo, 90 students wear glasses.\n\nNow, to find out how many students do not wear glasses, I can subtract the number of students who wear glasses from the total number of students.\n\nTotal students - students who wear glasses = students who do not wear glasses\n\n120 - 90 = 30\n\nTherefore, 30 students do not wear glasses.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can directly calculate the percentage of students who do not wear glasses.\n\nIf 75% wear glasses, then the remaining percentage does not wear glasses. So, 100% - 75% = 25% do not wear glasses.\n\nNow, I can find 25% of 120 to confirm the number of students who do not wear glasses.\n\n25% of 120 is calculated by multiplying 120 by 0.25.\n\n120 \u00d7 0.25 = 30\n\nAgain, I get 30 students who do not wear glasses.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is good. It confirms that 30 is the correct number of students who do not wear glasses.\n\nLet me think if there's any other way to look at this problem. Maybe using fractions?\n\n75% is the same as 3/4, since 75 divided by 100 is 0.75, which is 3/4.\n\nSo, 3/4 of the students wear glasses. Therefore, 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 do not wear glasses.\n\nNow, 1/4 of 120 is 120 divided by 4, which is 30.\n\nOnce again, I get 30 students who do not wear glasses.\n\nI think no matter which method I use, the answer remains the same. So, I can be confident that the answer is 30.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's add up the number of students who wear glasses and those who do not to see if it totals 120.\n\nStudents who wear glasses: 90\n\nStudents who do not wear glasses: 30\n\nTotal: 90 + 30 = 120\n\nYes, it matches the total number of students. So, everything checks out.\n\nI think I've covered all the possible ways to solve this problem, and all methods lead to the same conclusion that 30 students do not wear glasses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
