        "content": "Let's see. There are about 7.9 billion people on Earth, and each person breathes about 16 times per minute. I need to find out how many total breaths are taken worldwide every hour.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many breaths one person takes in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and each person breathes 16 times per minute, I can multiply 16 breaths by 60 minutes to get the number of breaths per hour per person.\n\nSo, 16 breaths/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 960 breaths/hour per person.\n\nNow, there are approximately 7.9 billion people. To make it easier, I'll write that as 7,900,000,000 people.\n\nSo, to find the total number of breaths per hour worldwide, I need to multiply the number of breaths per hour per person by the total number of people.\n\nThat would be 960 breaths/hour/person * 7,900,000,000 people.\n\nLet me do that multiplication.\n\nFirst, 960 * 7,900,000,000.\n\nI can break it down: 960 * 7,900,000,000 = 960 * 7.9 * 1,000,000,000.\n\nWait, better yet, 960 * 7,900,000,000.\n\nLet's see, 960 * 7,900,000,000.\n\nI can calculate 960 * 79 = 960 * 70 + 960 * 9 = 67,200 + 8,640 = 75,840.\n\nThen, since 7,900,000,000 is 79 * 100,000,000, I need to multiply 75,840 by 100,000,000.\n\nSo, 75,840 * 100,000,000 = 7,584,000,000,000.\n\nWait, that seems too high. Let me check my math again.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 960 * 7.9 * 1,000,000,000.\n\n960 * 7.9 = 7,584.\n\nThen, 7,584 * 1,000,000,000 = 7,584,000,000,000.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, worldwide, people take about 7,584,000,000,000 breaths every hour.\n\nThat's 7.584 trillion breaths per hour.\n\nWow, that's a huge number!\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting over:\n\n- 16 breaths per minute per person.\n\n- 60 minutes in an hour.\n\n- Therefore, breaths per hour per person: 16 * 60 = 960 breaths/hour/person.\n\n- Total population: 7.9 billion = 7,900,000,000 people.\n\n- Total breaths per hour worldwide: 960 * 7,900,000,000.\n\nLet me verify 960 * 7,900,000,000.\n\n960 * 7,900,000,000 = 960 * 7.9 * 1,000,000,000.\n\n960 * 7.9 = 7,584.\n\n7,584 * 1,000,000,000 = 7,584,000,000,000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in scientific notation.\n\n7.9 billion is 7.9 * 10^9.\n\n960 is 9.6 * 10^2.\n\nSo, 9.6 * 10^2 * 7.9 * 10^9 = (9.6 * 7.9) * 10^(2+9) = 75.84 * 10^11.\n\nBut 75.84 * 10^11 is equal to 7.584 * 10^12, which is 7.584 trillion.\n\nYes, that matches my previous result.\n\nSo, the total number of breaths taken worldwide every hour is approximately 7.584 trillion breaths.\n\nThat's a massive number! It really puts into perspective just how many breaths are taken collectively by humanity every hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.584 \\text{ trillion breaths per hour}} \\]"
