        "content": "So I've got this equation to solve: (4x - 2)/3 + 6 = 10. Hmm, let's see. I need to find the value of x that makes this equation true. Okay, first things first, I should probably isolate the term with x in it. So, I have (4x - 2)/3 + 6 = 10.\n\nMaybe I can start by getting rid of the +6 on the left side. To do that, I can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation. That should keep it balanced. So, if I subtract 6 from both sides, I get:\n\n(4x - 2)/3 = 10 - 6\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(4x - 2)/3 = 4\n\nAlright, now I have (4x - 2)/3 = 4. I need to get rid of the denominator here, which is 3. To do that, I can multiply both sides of the equation by 3. So, multiplying both sides by 3 gives:\n\n4x - 2 = 4 * 3\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n4x - 2 = 12\n\nNow, I have 4x - 2 = 12. I need to isolate the term with x, which is 4x. So, I can add 2 to both sides to get rid of the -2 on the left. Adding 2 to both sides:\n\n4x - 2 + 2 = 12 + 2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n4x = 14\n\nNow, I have 4x = 14. To find x, I need to divide both sides by 4. So, dividing both sides by 4:\n\nx = 14 / 4\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx = 3.5\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Maybe I should plug it back into the original equation to verify. So, the original equation is (4x - 2)/3 + 6 = 10. Let's substitute x = 3.5 into it.\n\nFirst, calculate 4x: 4 * 3.5 = 14\n\nThen, 14 - 2 = 12\n\nNow, 12 divided by 3 is 4\n\nThen, 4 + 6 = 10\n\nOkay, that matches the right side of the equation, which is 10. So, x = 3.5 is indeed the correct solution.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can eliminate the fraction right from the beginning. The equation is (4x - 2)/3 + 6 = 10.\n\nPerhaps I can multiply every term by 3 to eliminate the denominator. So, multiplying every term by 3:\n\n3 * [(4x - 2)/3] + 3 * 6 = 3 * 10\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(4x - 2) + 18 = 30\n\nBecause 3 * [(4x - 2)/3] is just 4x - 2, and 3 * 6 is 18, and 3 * 10 is 30.\n\nSo now, I have:\n\n4x - 2 + 18 = 30\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n4x + 16 = 30\n\nNow, subtract 16 from both sides:\n\n4x = 30 - 16\n\nWhich is:\n\n4x = 14\n\nThen, divide both sides by 4:\n\nx = 14 / 4\n\nWhich is again:\n\nx = 3.5\n\nSo, both methods lead me to the same answer, x = 3.5. That gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this equation could be interpreted or if there are any tricks I might have missed. The equation is straightforward: a linear equation with one variable. No exponents, no absolutes, no variables in the denominator\u2014just a simple linear equation.\n\nAnother way to approach this could be to write it in a different form. Let's see:\n\nStarting with (4x - 2)/3 + 6 = 10\n\nI can write this as:\n\n(4x - 2)/3 = 10 - 6\n\nWhich is:\n\n(4x - 2)/3 = 4\n\nNow, multiplying both sides by 3:\n\n4x - 2 = 12\n\nThen, adding 2 to both sides:\n\n4x = 14\n\nFinally, dividing by 4:\n\nx = 3.5\n\nAgain, the same answer. It seems consistent no matter which method I use.\n\nLet me think about whether there's any possibility of another solution. Is there any chance that x could be negative, or is there any other value that could satisfy the equation? Given that the equation is linear, there should be only one solution. So, x = 3.5 is the only solution.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I can plot the equation or think about it graphically. If I consider y = (4x - 2)/3 + 6 and y = 10, then the solution is where these two lines intersect. Since y = 10 is a horizontal line, and y = (4x - 2)/3 + 6 is a linear function with a slope, they should intersect at exactly one point, which corresponds to x = 3.5.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the equation in terms of transformations. Starting with y = (4x - 2)/3, then shifting it up by 6 units to get y = (4x - 2)/3 + 6, and setting that equal to 10.\n\nBut honestly, I think I've beaten this equation enough. It's clear that x = 3.5 is the solution, and I've verified it through multiple methods. I don't see any room for error here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3.5} \\]"
