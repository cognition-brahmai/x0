        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A store sells three types of pens: Pen A, Pen B, and Pen C. Pen A costs $2 each, Pen B costs $3 each, and Pen C costs $4 each. A customer buys a total of 15 pens for $50. I need to figure out how many of each type of pen they bought.\n\nAlright, let's start by defining variables for the number of each pen. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of Pen A.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of Pen B.\n\n- Let \\( z \\) be the number of Pen C.\n\nNow, we know that the total number of pens is 15, so we can write the first equation as:\n\n\\[ x + y + z = 15 \\]\n\nNext, the total cost is $50. Since Pen A costs $2 each, Pen B costs $3 each, and Pen C costs $4 each, the cost equation would be:\n\n\\[ 2x + 3y + 4z = 50 \\]\n\nSo, now we have two equations with three variables. Typically, with three variables, we need three equations to find a unique solution. But maybe we can find a way to solve this with the information given.\n\nLet me see if I can express one variable in terms of the others using the first equation and substitute into the second equation.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n\\[ x = 15 - y - z \\]\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 2(15 - y - z) + 3y + 4z = 50 \\]\n\nLet\u2019s simplify that:\n\n\\[ 30 - 2y - 2z + 3y + 4z = 50 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 30 + y + 2z = 50 \\]\n\nNow, subtract 30 from both sides:\n\n\\[ y + 2z = 20 \\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[ y + 2z = 20 \\]\n\nAnd we already have:\n\n\\[ x = 15 - y - z \\]\n\nNow, we need to find integer values for \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) that satisfy \\( y + 2z = 20 \\), and also ensure that \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\) are non-negative integers since you can't buy a negative number of pens.\n\nLet\u2019s solve for \\( y \\) in terms of \\( z \\):\n\n\\[ y = 20 - 2z \\]\n\nNow, since \\( y \\) has to be a non-negative integer, \\( 20 - 2z \\geq 0 \\), which means \\( z \\leq 10 \\).\n\nAlso, \\( z \\) has to be at least 0.\n\nSimilarly, \\( x = 15 - y - z = 15 - (20 - 2z) - z = 15 - 20 + 2z - z = -5 + z \\)\n\nSo, \\( x = z - 5 \\)\n\nNow, \\( x \\) also has to be a non-negative integer, so \\( z - 5 \\geq 0 \\), which means \\( z \\geq 5 \\)\n\nPreviously, we had \\( z \\leq 10 \\), so \\( z \\) can be 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10.\n\nLet\u2019s check each possible value of \\( z \\):\n\n1. If \\( z = 5 \\):\n\n- \\( y = 20 - 2(5) = 10 \\)\n\n- \\( x = 5 - 5 = 0 \\)\n\nSo, 0 Pen A, 10 Pen B, and 5 Pen C.\n\nLet\u2019s check the total cost: \\( 2(0) + 3(10) + 4(5) = 0 + 30 + 20 = 50 \\), which matches.\n\n2. If \\( z = 6 \\):\n\n- \\( y = 20 - 2(6) = 8 \\)\n\n- \\( x = 6 - 5 = 1 \\)\n\nSo, 1 Pen A, 8 Pen B, and 6 Pen C.\n\nCheck the total cost: \\( 2(1) + 3(8) + 4(6) = 2 + 24 + 24 = 50 \\), which matches.\n\n3. If \\( z = 7 \\):\n\n- \\( y = 20 - 2(7) = 6 \\)\n\n- \\( x = 7 - 5 = 2 \\)\n\nSo, 2 Pen A, 6 Pen B, and 7 Pen C.\n\nCheck the total cost: \\( 2(2) + 3(6) + 4(7) = 4 + 18 + 28 = 50 \\), which matches.\n\n4. If \\( z = 8 \\):\n\n- \\( y = 20 - 2(8) = 4 \\)\n\n- \\( x = 8 - 5 = 3 \\)\n\nSo, 3 Pen A, 4 Pen B, and 8 Pen C.\n\nCheck the total cost: \\( 2(3) + 3(4) + 4(8) = 6 + 12 + 32 = 50 \\), which matches.\n\n5. If \\( z = 9 \\):\n\n- \\( y = 20 - 2(9) = 2 \\)\n\n- \\( x = 9 - 5 = 4 \\)\n\nSo, 4 Pen A, 2 Pen B, and 9 Pen C.\n\nCheck the total cost: \\( 2(4) + 3(2) + 4(9) = 8 + 6 + 36 = 50 \\), which matches.\n\n6. If \\( z = 10 \\):\n\n- \\( y = 20 - 2(10) = 0 \\)\n\n- \\( x = 10 - 5 = 5 \\)\n\nSo, 5 Pen A, 0 Pen B, and 10 Pen C.\n\nCheck the total cost: \\( 2(5) + 3(0) + 4(10) = 10 + 0 + 40 = 50 \\), which matches.\n\nSo, there are six possible solutions:\n\n1. 0 Pen A, 10 Pen B, 5 Pen C\n\n2. 1 Pen A, 8 Pen B, 6 Pen C\n\n3. 2 Pen A, 6 Pen B, 7 Pen C\n\n4. 3 Pen A, 4 Pen B, 8 Pen C\n\n5. 4 Pen A, 2 Pen B, 9 Pen C\n\n6. 5 Pen A, 0 Pen B, 10 Pen C\n\nUnless there's additional information to choose between these options, all of these combinations satisfy the given conditions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{(0,10,5),\\ (1,8,6),\\ (2,6,7),\\ (3,4,8),\\ (4,2,9),\\ (5,0,10)} \\]"
