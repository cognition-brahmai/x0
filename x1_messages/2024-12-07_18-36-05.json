        "content": "Let's see. I know that each spider has 8 legs. So, if I have a certain number of legs and I want to find out how many spiders there are, I need to divide the total number of legs by the number of legs per spider.\n\nSo, total legs are 64, and each spider has 8 legs. So, the number of spiders would be 64 divided by 8.\n\nLet me do the division: 64 \u00f7 8.\n\nI know that 8 times 8 is 64, so 64 \u00f7 8 should be 8.\n\nWait, does that make sense? If I have 8 spiders, each with 8 legs, then 8 times 8 is indeed 64 legs.\n\nSo, yes, there would be 8 spiders.\n\nBut let me double-check. If I multiply 8 spiders by 8 legs per spider, I get 64 legs, which matches the total number of legs given.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of units. If one spider is equal to 8 legs, then to find out how many spiders correspond to 64 legs, I need to see how many times 8 goes into 64.\n\n8 goes into 64 exactly 8 times.\n\nSo, again, that suggests there are 8 spiders.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to subtract 8 legs for each spider until I reach zero. So, starting with 64 legs:\n\n64 - 8 = 56 (1 spider)\n\n56 - 8 = 48 (2 spiders)\n\n48 - 8 = 40 (3 spiders)\n\n40 - 8 = 32 (4 spiders)\n\n32 - 8 = 24 (5 spiders)\n\n24 - 8 = 16 (6 spiders)\n\n16 - 8 = 8 (7 spiders)\n\n8 - 8 = 0 (8 spiders)\n\nAgain, I end up with 8 spiders.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach it, the answer seems to be 8 spiders.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. But just to be thorough, I'll consider if there could be any other factors to consider.\n\nFor example, are there any spiders with a different number of legs? I know that typically spiders have 8 legs, but maybe there are some with fewer due to injury or some other reason. But since the question specifies that each spider has 8 legs, I can assume that all spiders in this scenario have exactly 8 legs.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the total number of legs is indeed 64 and that I haven't misread the number. But the question clearly states \"counted 64 legs.\"\n\nAdditionally, I should consider if there are any other creatures besides spiders, but the question specifically asks about spiders, so I don't need to account for other animals.\n\nSo, with that in mind, I can confidently say that there are 8 spiders.\n\nBut to make sure, I'll do one more check. If I have 8 spiders, each with 8 legs, the total number of legs is 8 \u00d7 8 = 64, which matches the given total.\n\nAlternatively, if I had a different number of spiders, say 7 spiders, that would be 7 \u00d7 8 = 56 legs, which is less than 64. So, that's not enough.\n\nIf I had 9 spiders, that would be 9 \u00d7 8 = 72 legs, which is more than 64.\n\nSo, again, 8 spiders is the only number that gives exactly 64 legs.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8 spiders.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
