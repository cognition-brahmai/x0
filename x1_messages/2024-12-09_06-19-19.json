        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you with this task. So, you need to create a Python script that connects to a MySQL database using the `pymysql` library. The script should retrieve all records from a table named \"employees\" and print each record's first name, last name, and salary. Additionally, the database connection details like host, user, password, and database name should be read from a configuration file.\n\nFirst, let's think about the steps we need to follow:\n\n1. **Read Configuration File:** We need to read the database connection details from a configuration file. For simplicity, let's assume we're using a JSON file to store these details.\n\n2. **Establish Database Connection:** Using the details from the configuration file, we'll connect to the MySQL database using the `pymysql` library.\n\n3. **Retrieve Data:** Once connected, we'll execute a SQL query to retrieve all records from the \"employees\" table.\n\n4. **Print Records:** Finally, we'll iterate through the retrieved records and print the first name, last name, and salary of each employee.\n\nSounds straightforward. Let's start by setting up the configuration file.\n\n### Step 1: Create Configuration File\n\nLet's create a JSON file named `db_config.json` with the following content:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"host\": \"your_host\",\n    \"user\": \"your_user\",\n    \"password\": \"your_password\",\n    \"database\": \"your_database\"\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `your_host`, `your_user`, `your_password`, and `your_database` with your actual database connection details.\n\n### Step 2: Install pymysql\n\nIf you haven't already installed the `pymysql` library, you can do so using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pymysql\n```\n\n### Step 3: Write the Python Script\n\nNow, let's write the Python script to accomplish the tasks outlined above.\n\n#### Complete Script\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport pymysql\n\ndef read_config(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n        config = json.load(file)\n    return config\n\ndef main():\n    # Path to the configuration file\n    config_file = 'db_config.json'\n    \n    # Read database configuration\n    config = read_config(config_file)\n    \n    # Connect to the database\n    connection = pymysql.connect(\n        host=config['host'],\n        user=config['user'],\n        password=config['password'],\n        db=config['database']\n    )\n    \n    try:\n        # Create a cursor object\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            # SQL query to retrieve all records from employees table\n            sql = \"SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees\"\n            cursor.execute(sql)\n            \n            # Fetch all the records\n            records = cursor.fetchall()\n            \n            # Print each record\n            for record in records:\n                first_name, last_name, salary = record\n                print(f\"First Name: {first_name}, Last Name: {last_name}, Salary: {salary}\")\n    finally:\n        # Close the database connection\n        connection.close()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Read Configuration File:**\n   - We define a function `read_config` that reads the database connection details from a JSON file.\n\n2. **Establish Database Connection:**\n   - Using the details from the configuration file, we establish a connection to the MySQL database using `pymysql.connect`.\n\n3. **Retrieve Data:**\n   - We create a cursor object and execute a SQL query to select the first name, last name, and salary from the \"employees\" table.\n   - We fetch all the records using `cursor.fetchall()`.\n\n4. **Print Records:**\n   - We iterate through the fetched records and print the required fields.\n\nThis script ensures that the database credentials are kept separate from the code in a configuration file, which is a good practice for security and maintainability."
