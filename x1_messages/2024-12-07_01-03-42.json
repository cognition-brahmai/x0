        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the city's water department has an aging pipe network that's causing them to lose about 25% of their treated water due to leaks. They've got a 500-mile-long pipe network, and they're planning to upgrade some of it to reduce these losses. They have a budget of $10 million for this project, and it costs $50,000 per mile to replace the old pipes.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many miles of pipes they can replace with the $10 million they have. Since it costs $50,000 per mile, I can calculate the number of miles they can afford to replace by dividing the total budget by the cost per mile.\n\nSo, number of miles that can be replaced = total budget / cost per mile\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of miles = $10,000,000 / $50,000 per mile\n\nLet me do that calculation.\n\n$10,000,000 divided by $50,000 is... well, $50,000 goes into $10,000,000 how many times? Let's see, 50,000 times 200 is 10,000,000. So, they can replace 200 miles of pipes with their $10 million budget.\n\nNow, the next part is to estimate the reduction in water loss after these upgrades are completed. Currently, they're losing 25% of their treated water through leaks.\n\nAssuming that the leaks are uniformly distributed across the entire pipe network, which is 500 miles long, and they're replacing 200 miles of that network, we can estimate the reduction in water loss based on the proportion of pipes being replaced.\n\nSo, if they're replacing 200 miles out of 500, that's 200/500, which simplifies to 2/5 or 40% of the pipe network.\n\nIf 40% of the pipes are being replaced, and assuming that the leaks are uniformly distributed, then they should see a 40% reduction in water loss from leaks.\n\nWait a minute, but is that accurate? Let's think about this carefully.\n\nIf the leaks are uniformly distributed across the pipe network, then replacing 40% of the pipes should reduce the leaks by 40%. However, in reality, leaks might not be uniformly distributed. There could be sections of the pipe network that have more leaks than others. But since we don't have that level of detail, we'll have to assume uniform distribution for this estimation.\n\nSo, if they reduce the leak-prone pipe length by 40%, they should see a 40% reduction in water loss.\n\nBut let's verify this logic.\n\nCurrently, they're losing 25% of treated water. If they replace 40% of the pipes, and assuming that those replaced pipes were contributing to 40% of the leaks, then the reduction in water loss should be 40% of the current 25% loss.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off.\n\nLet me rephrase:\n\nIf 40% of the pipes are replaced, and those pipes were responsible for 40% of the leaks, then the water loss should be reduced by that proportion.\n\nSo, 40% of 25% is 0.4 * 25% = 10%.\n\nSo, they would reduce water loss by 10 percentage points, meaning the new water loss would be 25% - 10% = 15%.\n\nBut is that the correct way to look at it?\n\nAlternatively, if they replace 40% of the pipes, and assuming leaks are uniformly distributed, then the remaining leaks would be in the 60% of pipes that weren't replaced.\n\nSo, 60% of the pipes are left, which would be causing 60% of the original leaks.\n\nOriginal leaks were 25%, so new leaks would be 60% of 25%, which is 0.6 * 25% = 15%.\n\nSo, in this case, the water loss would be reduced from 25% to 15%, which is a 10 percentage point reduction.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was a 40% reduction in water loss, but that doesn't align with this calculation.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nIf leaks are uniformly distributed, then the remaining pipes after replacement would be causing the remaining leaks proportional to their length.\n\nSo, if they replace 40% of the pipes, they're removing 40% of the leaks, leaving 60% of the leaks remaining.\n\nSo, the reduction in water loss is 40% of the original 25% loss.\n\nTherefore, reduction in water loss = 40% of 25% = 10%.\n\nSo, the new water loss would be original loss minus reduction: 25% - 10% = 15%.\n\nAlternatively, since 60% of the pipes remain, and they cause 60% of the original leaks: 0.6 * 25% = 15%.\n\nEither way, the new water loss is estimated to be 15%.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Miles of pipes that can be replaced: 200 miles\n\n- Estimated reduction in water loss: 10 percentage points (from 25% to 15%)\n\nWait, but in terms of percentage reduction, it's a 40% reduction in leaks, but in terms of the actual loss percentage, it's reduced from 25% to 15%.\n\nSo, maybe it's better to state both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more accurate to say that the water loss is reduced by 40% of its original value, which is 10%, leading to a new loss of 15%.\n\nBut let's make sure this makes sense.\n\nAnother way to look at it is:\n\nOriginal water loss: 25% of treated water.\n\nPipes causing leaks: 500 miles.\n\nLeakage rate per mile: 25% / 500 miles = 0.05% per mile.\n\nWait, that seems very low. Let's check that.\n\nActually, that might not be the right way to think about it, because the 25% loss is across the entire system, not per mile.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to consider that the total water loss is 25% of the treated water, and this loss is proportional to the length of the pipes that are leaky.\n\nSo, if they replace 200 miles of pipes, which is 40% of the total pipe network, they're removing 40% of the leaks, hence reducing the water loss by 10 percentage points to 15%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more precise way to model this, but given the information provided, this seems reasonable.\n\nIt's possible that the relationship between pipe length and water loss isn't strictly linear, perhaps due to different sections of the pipe network having different leak rates, but without more data, we'll assume proportionality.\n\nTherefore, the estimated reduction in water loss is 10 percentage points, from 25% to 15%.\n\nSo, to present the final answer:\n\nThe city's water department can replace 200 miles of pipes with their $10 million budget, which is expected to reduce the water loss from 25% to 15% of treated water.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200 \\text{ miles of pipes can be replaced, reducing water loss from } 25\\% \\text{ to } 15\\%} \\]"
