First, we know that 6 eggs are used for 12 cupcakes. So, I think we can find out how many eggs are needed for one cupcake and then multiply that by 36.\n\nLet me calculate that. If 6 eggs are for 12 cupcakes, then for one cupcake, it would be 6 eggs divided by 12 cupcakes, which is 0.5 eggs per cupcake.\n\nNow, if one cupcake requires 0.5 eggs, then 36 cupcakes would require 0.5 eggs times 36, which is 18 eggs.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. Another way to look at it is to see that 36 cupcakes are three times more than 12 cupcakes because 36 divided by 12 is 3.\n\nSo, if 12 cupcakes require 6 eggs, then 36 cupcakes would require 3 times as many eggs, which is 6 eggs times 3, equaling 18 eggs.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. So, the baker would need 18 eggs to make 36 cupcakes.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using proportions.\n\nIf 6 eggs are to 12 cupcakes as x eggs are to 36 cupcakes, then we can set up the proportion: 6/12 = x/36.\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 6 times 36 equals 12 times x.\n\nThat gives us 216 = 12x.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 12 to solve for x: 216 divided by 12 is 18.\n\nSo, again, we get x = 18 eggs.\n\nHmm, interesting. All these methods lead me to the same answer: 18 eggs.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for. For example, maybe there are economies of scale in baking, where using more ingredients at once affects the ratio.\n\nBut in this scenario, it seems like the relationship is directly proportional. Doubling the number of cupcakes requires doubling the number of eggs, and so on.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to stick with the straightforward approach.\n\nTherefore, the baker would need 18 eggs to make 36 cupcakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
