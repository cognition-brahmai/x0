As I sit here in the peaceful Shire, surrounded by the comforts of home, my thoughts often drift back to the days we spent traversing Middle-earth, facing dangers beyond imagination.\n\nSam, words cannot express how much your friendship has meant to me. From the moment you decided to follow me on that fateful day, you have been my rock, my companion, and my brother. Your unwavering loyalty, your courage, and your love for the Shire and its people have been an inspiration to me. Without you by my side, I truly believe that I would not have been able to carry the burden of the Ring as far as I did.\n\nRemembering the times we shared, from the lush gardens of Bag End to the desolate landscapes of Mordor, fills me with both sadness and gratitude. Each step we took, every hardship we endured, was made bearable by your presence. Your humor in dark times, your willingness to sacrifice for others, and your deep appreciation for the simple pleasures of life have left an indelible mark on my soul.\n\nI recall the day we first set out from the Shire, with nothing but a small hobbit pack and a sense of duty that seemed overwhelming. Yet, even then, you never once faltered in your resolve. When the journey became too much, when hope seemed lost, it was your voice that called to me, reminding me of the beauty of the world and the importance of our mission.\n\nSam, you are more than just a friend; you are family. The bond we share is unbreakable, forged in the fires of Mount Doom and tempered by the trials we have faced together. I am eternally grateful for your unwavering support and for being there for me in ways that no one else could.\n\nAs I look back on our adventure, I am filled with a mix of emotions\u2014regret for the pain and loss we experienced, but also joy for the memories and the growth that came from our experiences. Our journey may have ended, but the friendship we built will last forever.\n\nPlease know that you are always welcome in my home, and that I am here for you, just as you have always been there for me. Let us cherish the time we have together, nurturing our friendship and finding happiness in the peace that now envelops the Shire.\n\nWith all my love and gratitude,\n\nFrodo"
