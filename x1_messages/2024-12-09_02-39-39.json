        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are 8 employees in a company, and they want to form a committee of 3 people. But there's a catch: two specific employees can't serve together on the same committee. I need to figure out how many different committees can be formed under this condition.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of possible committees without any restrictions. Since it's about forming groups, and the order doesn't matter, I think I should use combinations. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, for 8 employees choosing 3, it would be C(8, 3). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * (8 - 3)!) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5!) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 5!) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6) / 6 = 56.\n\nSo, there are 56 possible committees without any restrictions.\n\nNow, I need to account for the condition that two specific employees can't serve together. Let's call these two employees A and B. So, any committee that includes both A and B is not allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many committees include both A and B. If A and B are both in the committee, then the third member can be any of the remaining 6 employees (since there are 8 total, minus A and B).\n\nSo, the number of committees that include both A and B is C(6, 1), because we're choosing 1 more member from the remaining 6 employees.\n\nC(6, 1) = 6.\n\nSo, there are 6 committees that include both A and B.\n\nTo find the total number of acceptable committees, I need to subtract these 6 committees from the total number of possible committees.\n\nSo, total acceptable committees = total committees - committees with both A and B = 56 - 6 = 50.\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the different scenarios:\n\n1. Committees that include A but not B.\n\n2. Committees that include B but not A.\n\n3. Committees that include neither A nor B.\n\nI need to add up the number of committees in these three scenarios.\n\nFirst, committees that include A but not B:\n\nIf A is in the committee, and B is not, then the other two members must be chosen from the remaining 6 employees.\n\nSo, number of such committees is C(6, 2).\n\nC(6, 2) = (6 \u00d7 5) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 15.\n\nSimilarly, committees that include B but not A:\n\nThis is the same as above, choosing 2 members from the remaining 6.\n\nSo, another 15 committees.\n\nFinally, committees that include neither A nor B:\n\nIn this case, all 3 members are chosen from the remaining 6 employees.\n\nSo, number of such committees is C(6, 3).\n\nC(6, 3) = (6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 20.\n\nNow, total acceptable committees = 15 (A but not B) + 15 (B but not A) + 20 (neither A nor B) = 50.\n\nThis matches the earlier result of 56 - 6 = 50.\n\nSo, the total number of different committees that can be formed, given that A and B cannot serve together, is 50.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose I consider all possible committees and subtract those that violate the condition.\n\nTotal committees: C(8, 3) = 56.\n\nCommittees that include both A and B: C(6, 1) = 6.\n\nSo, acceptable committees: 56 - 6 = 50.\n\nAlternatively, using the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nTotal committees: C(8, 3) = 56.\n\nNumber of committees including both A and B: C(6, 1) = 6.\n\nSo, acceptable committees: total - forbidden = 56 - 6 = 50.\n\nYes, I think this is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the number of committees where A and B are not together.\n\nThis is equivalent to total committees minus committees where A and B are both members.\n\nWhich is again 56 - 6 = 50.\n\nI think this is solid.\n\nSo, the final answer is 50 different committees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
