        "content": "So I need to find the area of a trapezoid, and I've got the lengths of the two bases and the height. The bases are 6 and 10 units long, and the height is 4 units. I remember there's a formula for the area of a trapezoid, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, what's a trapezoid? It's a four-sided shape with at least one pair of parallel sides. Those parallel sides are called the bases, and the non-parallel sides are the legs. The height is the perpendicular distance between the two bases.\n\nThe formula for the area of a trapezoid is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (b_1 + b_2) \\times h\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( b_1 \\) and \\( b_2 \\) are the lengths of the two bases,\n\n- \\( h \\) is the height.\n\nSo, in this case, \\( b_1 = 6 \\), \\( b_2 = 10 \\), and \\( h = 4 \\).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (6 + 10) \\times 4\n\\]\n\nFirst, add the lengths of the bases:\n\n\\[\n6 + 10 = 16\n\\]\n\nThen, multiply by the height:\n\n\\[\n16 \\times 4 = 64\n\\]\n\nFinally, multiply by half:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 64 = 32\n\\]\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 32 square units.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Sometimes I get confused with the formula. Is there another way to derive this to make sure I'm correct?\n\nAnother way to think about the area of a trapezoid is to imagine it as the average of the two bases multiplied by the height. The average of the bases is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average of bases} = \\frac{b_1 + b_2}{2} = \\frac{6 + 10}{2} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8\n\\]\n\nThen, multiply this average by the height:\n\n\\[\n8 \\times 4 = 32\n\\]\n\nSo, again, the area is 32 square units. That matches my first calculation, so I'm more confident now.\n\nLet me also consider if there's any other information I might need. For example, are the legs important in this calculation? In this case, since I have the heights and the bases, the legs aren't necessary for finding the area. But if I were to find, say, the perimeter, I would need the lengths of the legs as well.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. In this problem, all measurements are in the same units (units), so I don't need to convert anything.\n\nOne more thing: sometimes trapezoids can be oriented differently, or the height might be given differently. But in this case, it's straightforward. The bases are given as 6 and 10, and the height is 4.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's a way to derive this formula myself. Suppose I divide the trapezoid into a rectangle and two triangles. If I have bases of 6 and 10, the difference in length is 4 units. If I split this difference evenly, each triangle would have a base of 2 units (since 4 divided by 2 is 2).\n\nSo, I could think of the trapezoid as a rectangle with base 6 and height 4, plus two right triangles each with base 2 and height 4.\n\nFirst, the area of the rectangle:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 4 = 24\n\\]\n\nArea of one triangle:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 4 = 4\n\\]\n\nSince there are two triangles:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 4 = 8\n\\]\n\nTotal area:\n\n\\[\n24 + 8 = 32\n\\]\n\nAgain, I get 32 square units. This reinforces my previous calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I could imagine cutting the trapezoid along a diagonal and dividing it into two triangles, but that might be more complicated for this purpose.\n\nI think I've confirmed enough that the area is indeed 32 square units. I've used the standard formula and also verified it by breaking down the trapezoid into simpler shapes.\n\nJust to be complete, I should note that in some textbooks, the definition of a trapezoid may vary. For example, in some definitions, a trapezoid has exactly one pair of parallel sides, while in others, it has at least one pair. But in this problem, since it's specified that there are two bases, I can assume that there are two parallel sides.\n\nAlso, if the height was not given directly, I might need to calculate it using the Pythagorean theorem or other methods, but here, the height is provided, so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nIn conclusion, the area of the trapezoid with bases of lengths 6 and 10 and height 4 is 32 square units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]"
