        "content": "So you're asking about the probability when rolling a fair six-sided die twice and wanting the sum to be even. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that each die has six faces: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. When you roll two dice, there are a total of 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes, since each die is independent of the other.\n\nNow, we want the sum of the two numbers to be even. I recall that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are even or both are odd. So, I need to find the number of outcomes where both dice show even numbers or both show odd numbers.\n\nLet's identify the even and odd numbers on a die:\n\n- Even numbers: 2, 4, 6\n\n- Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5\n\nThere are three even numbers and three odd numbers on a standard die.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of outcomes where both dice show even numbers:\n\n- For the first die, there are 3 even numbers.\n\n- For the second die, there are also 3 even numbers.\n\n- So, the number of outcomes where both dice are even is 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nSimilarly, the number of outcomes where both dice show odd numbers is also 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 9 (both even) + 9 (both odd) = 18.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability = 18 / 36 = 0.5.\n\nWait a minute, that seems too straightforward. Is there another way to look at this to confirm?\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the parity of the numbers. The sum is even if both numbers are even or both are odd.\n\nThe probability that the first die is even is 3/6 = 0.5.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that the first die is odd is also 0.5.\n\nGiven that the first die is even, the probability that the second die is even is also 0.5.\n\nSimilarly, given that the first die is odd, the probability that the second die is odd is 0.5.\n\nSo, the total probability that both are even or both are odd is:\n\nP(both even) + P(both odd) = (0.5 * 0.5) + (0.5 * 0.5) = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that no matter what the first die shows, whether even or odd, there's a 0.5 probability that the second die matches it in parity, resulting in an even sum.\n\nSo, again, probability = 0.5.\n\nWait, but I recall that in probability, sometimes independent events can be tricky. Is there any dependency here that I'm missing?\n\nIn this case, the two dice rolls are independent events, so the probability calculations should be straightforward.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor that could influence the outcome.\n\nIs there a possibility of the dice not being fair? Oh, but the question specifies a fair six-sided die, so each face has an equal probability of landing face up.\n\nAlso, since we're dealing with two separate rolls, and assuming there's no influence between the rolls, independence holds.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can consider the sample space.\n\nList all possible outcomes:\n\nDie 1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n\nDie 2: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n\nPossible sums:\n\n(1,1)=2, (1,2)=3, (1,3)=4, ..., (6,6)=12\n\nNow, identify which of these sums are even:\n\n2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.\n\nCount the number of sums that are even.\n\nLooking at the possible sums:\n\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.\n\nEven sums: 2,4,6,8,10,12. That's six possible even sums.\n\nBut wait, in the 36 outcomes, how many result in each sum?\n\nFor example:\n\nSum of 2: only (1,1) -> 1 way\n\nSum of 3: (1,2), (2,1) -> 2 ways\n\nSum of 4: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1) -> 3 ways\n\nSum of 5: (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) -> 4 ways\n\nSum of 6: (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1) -> 5 ways\n\nSum of 7: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) -> 6 ways\n\nSum of 8: (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2) -> 5 ways\n\nSum of 9: (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3) -> 4 ways\n\nSum of 10: (4,6), (5,5), (6,4) -> 3 ways\n\nSum of 11: (5,6), (6,5) -> 2 ways\n\nSum of 12: (6,6) -> 1 way\n\nNow, identify which of these sums are even:\n\nSum of 2: 1 way\n\nSum of 4: 3 ways\n\nSum of 6: 5 ways\n\nSum of 8: 5 ways\n\nSum of 10: 3 ways\n\nSum of 12: 1 way\n\nTotal number of even sum outcomes: 1 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 18\n\nAgain, total outcomes are 36, so probability is 18/36 = 0.5.\n\nThis confirms my earlier calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the parity of each die.\n\nEach die has a 0.5 probability of being even or odd.\n\nThe sum is even if both are even or both are odd.\n\nSo, P(sum even) = P(both even) + P(both odd) = (0.5 * 0.5) + (0.5 * 0.5) = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5.\n\nSame result.\n\nI think it's clear that the probability is 0.5, or 1/2.\n\nJust to be comprehensive, I can also consider the probability that the sum is odd.\n\nP(sum odd) = 1 - P(sum even) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.\n\nAlternatively, calculating it directly:\n\nSum is odd if one die is even and the other is odd.\n\nP(one even and one odd) = P(first even and second odd) + P(first odd and second even) = (0.5 * 0.5) + (0.5 * 0.5) = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5.\n\nThis matches, so it makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled is even is 0.5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.5} \\]"
