        "content": "So there's this problem about houses in a village, right? There are 10 houses in total, and each house has a door of a different color. Specifically, there are 3 red doors, 2 blue doors, and the rest are green doors. The question is, if you pick a house at random, what's the probability that it has a green door?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many green doors there are. Since there are 10 houses in total, and 3 are red and 2 are blue, I can subtract the number of red and blue doors from the total to find the number of green doors.\n\nSo, total houses = 10\n\nRed doors = 3\n\nBlue doors = 2\n\nGreen doors = total houses - (red doors + blue doors) = 10 - (3 + 2) = 10 - 5 = 5\n\nSo, there are 5 green doors.\n\nNow, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcome is picking a house with a green door, and the total possible outcomes are picking any house.\n\nSo, probability of green door = number of green doors / total number of houses = 5 / 10 = 0.5\n\nIf I want to express this as a percentage, I can multiply by 100, which gives 50%.\n\nAlternatively, probabilities are often expressed as fractions, so 5/10 can be simplified to 1/2.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/2, or 0.5, or 50%.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says \"each house has a different color door,\" but then it mentions that there are 3 red doors and 2 blue doors. That seems contradictory because if each house has a different color door, then no two houses should have the same color door.\n\nHmm, maybe I misread that. Let me look back at the problem.\n\n\"In a small village, there are 10 houses. Each house has a different color door. There are 3 red doors, 2 blue doors, and the rest are green doors. If you randomly pick a house to visit, what is the probability that it will have a green door?\"\n\nOkay, so it says each house has a different color door, but then specifies that there are 3 red doors and 2 blue doors. That doesn't make sense because if each door has a different color, then no two houses can have the same color door.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Perhaps it means that there are doors of different colors in general, but some colors are repeated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"each house has a different color door\" means that only one house has each specific shade or tint, but for the purpose of this problem, doors are categorized into red, blue, and green groups.\n\nGiven that, maybe the intention is that there are 3 houses with red doors, 2 with blue doors, and the remaining 5 with green doors, even if \"different color doors\" is a bit misphrased.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"each house has a different color door\" refers to the uniqueness of the door color combination, but that seems too vague.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed with the assumption that there are 3 red doors, 2 blue doors, and 5 green doors, totaling 10 houses.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a house with a green door is 5 out of 10, which is 1/2.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any other interpretation.\n\nLet me consider another angle: if \"each house has a different color door,\" but then it specifies numbers for red and blue doors, perhaps it means that among the 10 houses, there are 3 houses with red doors, 2 with blue doors, and 5 with unique individual colors.\n\nBut that would make the problem more complex, as the \"rest are green doors\" would suggest that the remaining 5 houses all have green doors, which contradicts the \"different color door\" statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"different color door\" means that each house has a door of a different shade within their color group.\n\nBut that seems overly complicated for this context.\n\nGiven that, I think the most straightforward interpretation is that there are 3 red doors, 2 blue doors, and 5 green doors, making a total of 10 houses.\n\nThus, the probability of selecting a house with a green door is 5/10, which simplifies to 1/2.\n\nSo, the answer is 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
