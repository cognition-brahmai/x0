I'll use WikiSearch to look up \"invention of television\" to get a general overview.\n\n:Evidence0: = WikiSearch[\"invention of television\"]\n\nPlan: From the Wikipedia page, I should be able to find the name of the inventor. I'll use PersonIdentifier to extract the name.\n\n:Evidence1: = PersonIdentifier[:Evidence0:]\n\nPlan: Now that I have the inventor's name, I need to find out when television was first used commercially.

I might need to look for specific keywords like \"first commercial use,\" \"commercial debut,\" or \"start of commercial broadcasting.\"\n\nPlan: I'll use QandA to ask about the first commercial use of television, providing the Wikipedia text as context.\n\n:Evidence3: = QandA[\"When was television first used commercially?\", :Evidence0:]\n\nPlan: If QandA provides a specific date, I'll note that. If not, I'll look through the dates extracted earlier and see which one makes the most sense in the context of commercial use.\n\nPlan: Finally, I'll compile the information: the name of the inventor and the date of the first commercial use of television.\n\nAnswer: The inventor of television was [:Evidence1:] and it was first used commercially in [:Evidence3:]."
