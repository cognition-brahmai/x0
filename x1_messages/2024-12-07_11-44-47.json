You know how it is\u2014genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, right? There's always some crazy stuff happening.\n\nSo, I was in my lab, working on this new arc reactor design. It's supposed to be even more efficient than the last one, and I'm telling you, it's going to revolutionize energy production. But, as with all my inventions, nothing ever goes according to plan.\n\nAnyway, I was running some tests, and suddenly, there was this massive explosion. Don't worry; I'm fine, just a few burns and scrapes. Pepper's going to kill me, but hey, that's part of the job.\n\nSo, I had to suit up\u2014Iron Man style, obviously\u2014and contain the damage. It took longer than I thought because some of the debris ended up scattering all over the compound. I had JARVIS help me track it down and make sure nothing sensitive fell into the wrong hands.\n\nAfter that, I had to debrief with Pepper and make sure everything was under control. She's been breathing down my neck lately about safety protocols, and honestly, she's right. I need to be more careful.\n\nSo, here I am, on my way to the meeting, but I'm probably going to be at least 20 minutes late. I've already called ahead and let them know, so hopefully, they're understanding.\n\nLook, I know time is money, and being late isn't acceptable, but sometimes, when you're pushing the boundaries of what's possible, stuff happens. I promise I'll make it up to you guys.\n\nSee you there soon.\n\n\u2014Tony"
