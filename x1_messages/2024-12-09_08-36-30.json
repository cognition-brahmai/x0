Potassium is a soft, silvery-white metallic element that belongs to the alkali metal group. It is highly reactive and is found in nature only in compounds, not in its elemental form. Potassium is essential for the proper functioning of all living cells and plays a crucial role in maintaining electrolyte balance, nerve function, and muscle contraction."
