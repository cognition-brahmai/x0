        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a box with 10 red balls, 20 blue balls, and 30 green balls. I need to find the probability of picking either a red or a blue ball at random. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what probability is. Probability is the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are picking a red or a blue ball, and the total outcomes are picking any ball from the box.\n\nLet me find out the total number of balls in the box. There are 10 red, 20 blue, and 30 green balls. So, total balls = 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 balls.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of red balls plus the number of blue balls, which is 10 + 20 = 30 balls.\n\nSo, the probability P of picking either a red or blue ball is P = number of favorable outcomes / total number of outcomes = 30 / 60 = 0.5.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Is there another way to look at this?\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the addition rule of probability for two events. If A and B are two events that can't happen at the same time (mutually exclusive), then the probability of A or B happening is P(A) + P(B).\n\nIn this case, picking a red ball and picking a blue ball are mutually exclusive because I can't pick both at the same time when I'm picking one ball.\n\nSo, P(red or blue) = P(red) + P(blue).\n\nP(red) = number of red balls / total balls = 10 / 60 = 1/6.\n\nP(blue) = number of blue balls / total balls = 20 / 60 = 1/3.\n\nTherefore, P(red or blue) = 1/6 + 1/3.\n\nNow, to add these fractions, I need a common denominator. 1/6 + 1/3 = 1/6 + 2/6 = 3/6 = 0.5.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the probability is 0.5, or 50%.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other angle I should look at this from. Is there a chance I'm missing something? For example, is there any dependency between picking red and blue balls? No, because I'm picking only one ball.\n\nAlso, all balls are equally likely to be picked, assuming the picking is random.\n\nWait a minute, what if the balls are not equally sized or something? But the problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I can assume all balls are identical except for their color.\n\nSo, I think my answer is correct. The probability of picking either a red or blue ball is 0.5.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me calculate the probability of picking a green ball and see if it makes sense.\n\nP(green) = number of green balls / total balls = 30 / 60 = 0.5.\n\nAnd since red or blue is the opposite of green in this context, P(red or blue) = 1 - P(green) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.\n\nAgain, that matches my previous calculations.\n\nAll right, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.5} \\]"
