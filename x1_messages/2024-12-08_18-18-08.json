        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. It takes 2 hours to make one Type A widget and 3 hours to make one Type B widget. The factory works 120 hours per week, and it maintains a production ratio of 3:2 for Type A to Type B widgets. We need to figure out how many units of each type can be produced in a week.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the ratio means. A 3:2 ratio of Type A to Type B means that for every 3 units of Type A produced, there are 2 units of Type B produced. So, the total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nNow, we need to allocate the 120 hours of factory operation time between producing Type A and Type B widgets according to this ratio.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- The number of Type A widgets produced per week as A\n\n- The number of Type B widgets produced per week as B\n\nGiven the ratio A:B = 3:2, we can express A in terms of B or vice versa. Let's express A in terms of B:\n\nA = (3/2) * B\n\nNow, we know the time taken to produce each type:\n\n- Time for Type A: 2 hours per unit\n\n- Time for Type B: 3 hours per unit\n\nTotal time spent producing widgets is 120 hours.\n\nSo, the total time equation would be:\n\n2A + 3B = 120\n\nNow, substitute A from the ratio expression:\n\n2*(3/2*B) + 3B = 120\n\nSimplify that:\n\n3B + 3B = 120\n\n6B = 120\n\nB = 20\n\nNow, plug B back into the ratio expression to find A:\n\nA = (3/2)*20 = 30\n\nSo, the factory can produce 30 units of Type A and 20 units of Type B widgets per week, maintaining the 3:2 production ratio.\n\nBut let's double-check this to make sure it adds up.\n\nIf A = 30 and B = 20,\n\nTotal time = (30 * 2) + (20 * 3) = 60 + 60 = 120 hours, which matches the given factory operation time.\n\nAlso, the ratio is 30:20, which simplifies to 3:2, as required.\n\nSo, our solution seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30 \\text{ units of Type A and } 20 \\text{ units of Type B}} \\]"
