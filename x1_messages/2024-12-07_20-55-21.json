        "content": "So I have this problem here: In a class of 30 students, 15 play soccer, 12 play basketball, and 7 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport. Hmm, sounds like a classic set theory problem, maybe involving Venn diagrams. I'll try to visualize it.\n\nFirst, there are 30 students in total. Out of these, 15 play soccer and 12 play basketball, but 7 play both. So, if I just add 15 and 12, that would be 27 students playing some sport, but that counts the 7 students who play both sports twice\u2014once in soccer and once in basketball. So, to get the total number of students who play at least one sport, I need to subtract those 7 from the total to avoid double-counting.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal students = 30\n\nStudents playing soccer (S) = 15\n\nStudents playing basketball (B) = 12\n\nStudents playing both (S \u2229 B) = 7\n\nStudents playing at least one sport (S \u222a B) = S + B - S \u2229 B = 15 + 12 - 7 = 20\n\nSo, 20 students play either soccer or basketball or both.\n\nNow, to find the number of students who don't play either sport, I subtract the number of students who play at least one sport from the total number of students:\n\nStudents not playing any sport = Total students - Students playing at least one sport = 30 - 20 = 10\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to approach this to confirm the answer?\n\nMaybe I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The principle states that to find the total number of elements in two sets, you add the sizes of the sets and subtract the intersection to correct for double-counting.\n\nSo, again:\n\nS \u222a B = S + B - S \u2229 B = 15 + 12 - 7 = 20\n\nThen, the complement of S \u222a B would be the students not in S or B, which is indeed 30 - 20 = 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of sets.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- U as the universal set, which is the entire class of 30 students.\n\n- S as the set of students playing soccer.\n\n- B as the set of students playing basketball.\n\nWe are given:\n\nn(U) = 30\n\nn(S) = 15\n\nn(B) = 12\n\nn(S \u2229 B) = 7\n\nWe need to find n(U - (S \u222a B)), which is the number of students not in S or B.\n\nFrom set theory, we know that:\n\nn(U - (S \u222a B)) = n(U) - n(S \u222a B)\n\nAnd as previously calculated, n(S \u222a B) = n(S) + n(B) - n(S \u2229 B) = 15 + 12 - 7 = 20\n\nTherefore, n(U - (S \u222a B)) = 30 - 20 = 10\n\nSo, 10 students don't play either sport.\n\nLet me try to verify this with a Venn diagram.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents soccer players, and the other represents basketball players.\n\n- The overlap (both sports) has 7 students.\n\n- So, only soccer players are 15 - 7 = 8.\n\n- Only basketball players are 12 - 7 = 5.\n\n- Therefore, the total number of students playing at least one sport is 8 (only soccer) + 5 (only basketball) + 7 (both) = 20.\n\n- Again, total students are 30, so students not playing any sport are 30 - 20 = 10.\n\nThis matches my previous calculation.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this?\n\nPerhaps using probabilities or some other formula, but I think for this problem, the set theory approach is sufficient and straightforward.\n\nI don't see any inconsistencies in my reasoning, and both methods give me the same answer.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 10 students not playing either sport.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
