        "content": "In astrophysics, the term for the boundary around a black hole beyond which no light or other radiation can escape is called the event horizon. So, the correct answer is B. The event horizon.\n\nTo elaborate a bit, the event horizon is a theoretical boundary in spacetime around a black hole from which nothing can escape, not even light. This is because the gravitational pull becomes so strong that the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light. The event horizon is not a physical surface but rather a point of no return.\n\nOption A, the heliopause, is actually the boundary around our solar system where the solar wind from the Sun meets the interstellar medium. It's not related to black holes.\n\nOption C, the Schwarzschild radius, is a characteristic radius associated with every mass where, if that mass were compressed to fit within that radius, it would form a black hole. The event horizon of a non-rotating black hole coincides with its Schwarzschild radius. So, in a way, E (both A and C) could be considered correct if we interpret \"boundary\" broadly, but specifically, the term for the boundary beyond which nothing can escape is the event horizon.\n\nOption D, the photon sphere, is another interesting region around a black hole where photons can orbit stably. However, this is closer to the black hole than the event horizon and is not the boundary from which nothing can escape.\n\nSo, while there are several important radii and boundaries in the study of black holes, the event horizon is specifically the one beyond which no light or other radiation can escape."
