        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 5 red balls and 3 blue balls in a box, making a total of 8 balls. I need to find the probability that if I pick two balls at once without looking, both of them will be red.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to pick two balls at once. Is it the same as picking two balls one after the other without replacement? I think it should be the same because in both cases, I'm selecting two balls without replacing the first before picking the second.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 8 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nHere, n = 8 and k = 2, so the total number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 8 is:\n\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8 - 2)!) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 6!) = (8 \u00d7 7) / 2 = 56 / 2 = 28.\n\nSo, there are 28 possible pairs of balls that I could pick.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these pairs are both red. There are 5 red balls, so the number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 5 is:\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5 - 2)!) = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 3!)) = (5 \u00d7 4) / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10.\n\nSo, there are 10 pairs of red balls.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls picked are red is the number of favorable outcomes (both red) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (any two balls).\n\nProbability = Number of red pairs / Total number of pairs = 10 / 28 = 5 / 14.\n\nWait, can I simplify that fraction? 10 divided by 2 is 5, and 28 divided by 2 is 14, so yes, 5/14 is the simplified form.\n\nSo, the probability is 5/14.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I can think about it another way. Let's say I pick the first ball. The probability that it's red is 5 out of 8, since there are 5 red balls and 8 total balls.\n\nThen, without replacing the first ball, I pick the second ball. Now, there are 7 balls left in the box, and 4 of them are red (since I already picked one red ball).\n\nSo, the probability that the second ball is also red, given that the first one was red, is 4 out of 7.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are red is (5/8) \u00d7 (4/7) = 20/56 = 5/14.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous result. So, the probability is indeed 5/14.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that picking two balls at once is different from picking them one after the other, but in terms of probability, it should be the same as long as the order doesn't matter, which in this case it doesn't.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which reassures me that 5/14 is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{14}} \\]"
