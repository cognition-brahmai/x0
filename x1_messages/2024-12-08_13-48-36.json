        "content": "Let's see. We have three friends: Alice, Bob, and Carol. The information given is that Alice is older than Bob, and Bob is younger than Carol. So, Alice > Bob, and Bob < Carol. Wait, but saying Bob is younger than Carol means Carol is older than Bob. So, Carol > Bob.\n\nNow, to find out who is the youngest, we need to see who is the least in terms of age among the three.\n\nLet's list out what we know:\n\n1. Alice is older than Bob.\n\n2. Carol is older than Bob.\n\nFrom these two points, we can see that both Alice and Carol are older than Bob. Therefore, Bob is younger than both Alice and Carol.\n\nBut we don't have a direct comparison between Alice and Carol. Maybe Alice is older than Carol, or maybe Carol is older than Alice. We don't know yet.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the youngest among them, and from the information given, Bob is younger than both Alice and Carol. So, regardless of how Alice and Carol compare in age to each other, Bob is younger than both of them.\n\nTherefore, Bob is the youngest among the three friends.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Bob}} \\]"
