        "content": "In verdant valleys where the rivers sing,\nWhere ancient trees their shadows fling,\nThere rise the mountains, Nature's kings,\nIn splendor, might, and timeless springs.\n\nLike Titans standing guard o'er Earth,\nTheir peaks in misty veils are clothed,\nTheir grandeur strikes the weary heart,\nAnd in their silence, souls are doffed.\n\nOh, mountains! You are living stones,\nWhere eagles soar on updrafts free,\nWhere winds, like harpists, play their tunes,\nAnd clouds, in lazy drifts, agree.\n\nYour slopes are laced with trails unknown,\nWhere shepherds pipe their pastoral airs,\nAnd wildflowers bloom, untrampled, lone,\nIn meadows kissed by sun and stars.\n\nAt dawn, when light first breaks the night,\nYou blush with roseate hues of morn,\nThen, clad in gold, you shine so bright,\nAs if the sky had set you born.\n\nBut when the sun descends to rest,\nAnd twilight casts its purple glow,\nYou stand in solemn, silent vest,\nAs if in prayer to heavens' glow.\n\nIn storms, you bear the tempest's wrath,\nUnmoved, unwavering, you stand,\nWhile lightning flashes, thunder crashes,\nYour steadfastness commands.\n\nYet in your bosom, secrets lie,\nOf glacial streams that slowly flow,\nOf caverns deep where echoes die,\nAnd mysteries only you know.\n\nOh, to climb your heights, to feel\nThe breath of freedom, pure and clean,\nTo touch the sky, and spirits reel,\nIn awe of beauty so serene.\n\nFor in your arms, the world seems small,\nOur cares and woes, but tiny things,\nAgainst the vastness of it all,\nWe find our place, our rightful wings.\n\nSo here's to mountains, proud and high,\nWho teach us strength, and patience, too,\nWho in their majesty, remind us why\nWe love this Earth, and all it's true.\n\n**End of Poem**"
