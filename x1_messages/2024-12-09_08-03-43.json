        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a Java application that connects to a PostgreSQL database, retrieves all records from a \"users\" table, and prints them to the console in a formatted manner. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, you'll need to make sure you have the PostgreSQL JDBC driver in your project. If you're using Maven, you can add it to your `pom.xml` like this:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>\n    <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>\n    <version>42.2.18</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nIf you're not using a build tool like Maven, you'll need to download the JDBC driver JAR and add it to your project's classpath manually.\n\nNext, you'll need to establish a connection to your PostgreSQL database. To do this, you'll need to know the database URL, username, and password. The URL typically follows this format:\n\n```\njdbc:postgresql://hostname:port/databaseName\n```\n\nFor example, if your database is running locally on the default port (5432) and the database name is \"mydb\", the URL would be:\n\n```\njdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb\n```\n\nAssuming you have a username and password for this database, you can use them to connect.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet to connect to the database:\n\n```java\nimport java.sql.Connection;\nimport java.sql.DriverManager;\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\n\npublic class DatabaseConnector {\n    public static Connection connect() throws SQLException {\n        String url = \"jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb\";\n        String user = \"yourUsername\";\n        String password = \"yourPassword\";\n        return DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `\"yourUsername\"` and `\"yourPassword\"` with your actual database credentials.\n\nNow, you need to retrieve all records from the \"users\" table. Assuming the \"users\" table has columns like `id`, `name`, and `email`, you can write a SQL query to select all records from this table.\n\nHere's how you can execute the query and print the results in a formatted manner:\n\n```java\nimport java.sql.Connection;\nimport java.sql.ResultSet;\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\nimport java.sql.Statement;\n\npublic class UserPrinter {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Connection connection = null;\n        Statement statement = null;\n        ResultSet resultSet = null;\n\n        try {\n            connection = DatabaseConnector.connect();\n            statement = connection.createStatement();\n            String sql = \"SELECT id, name, email FROM users\";\n            resultSet = statement.executeQuery(sql);\n\n            // Print header\n            System.out.printf(\"%-5s %-20s %-30s%n\", \"ID\", \"Name\", \"Email\");\n\n            // Print each row\n            while (resultSet.next()) {\n                int id = resultSet.getInt(\"id\");\n                String name = resultSet.getString(\"name\");\n                String email = resultSet.getString(\"email\");\n                System.out.printf(\"%-5d %-20s %-30s%n\", id, name, email);\n            }\n        } catch (SQLException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        } finally {\n            try {\n                if (resultSet != null) resultSet.close();\n                if (statement != null) statement.close();\n                if (connection != null) connection.close();\n            } catch (SQLException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code does the following:\n\n1. Establishes a connection to the database using the `DatabaseConnector` class.\n2. Creates a `Statement` object to execute the SQL query.\n3. Executes the query to select all records from the \"users\" table.\n4. Prints a header row with column names.\n5. Iterates through the result set and prints each row in a formatted manner.\n6. Closes all resources in the `finally` block to prevent resource leaks.\n\nMake sure to handle any exceptions that may occur during database operations, such as `SQLException`, to make your application more robust.\n\nThat's it! This should give you a basic Java application that connects to a PostgreSQL database, retrieves records from the \"users\" table, and prints them to the console in a formatted way.
