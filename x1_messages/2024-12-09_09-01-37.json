        "content": "Let's see. They're planning a road trip that's 1200 miles long, and the car they're using gets 30 miles per gallon. Gas is costing $3.50 per gallon. I need to figure out how much they'll spend on gas for the whole trip.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many gallons of gas they'll need for the trip. Since the car gets 30 miles per gallon, I can divide the total miles by the miles per gallon to find the gallons needed. So, 1200 miles divided by 30 miles per gallon should give me the number of gallons they'll need.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 1200 \u00f7 30. That's 40 gallons. So, they'll need 40 gallons of gas for the trip.\n\nNext, I need to find out how much that will cost. Gas is $3.50 per gallon, so I'll multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon. That's 40 gallons times $3.50 per gallon.\n\nLet me calculate that: 40 \u00d7 3.50. Well, 40 times 3 is 120, and 40 times 0.50 is 20. So, 120 plus 20 is 140.\n\nTherefore, they will spend $140 on gas for the entire trip.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 1200 miles divided by 30 miles per gallon is indeed 40 gallons.\n\nThen, 40 gallons times $3.50 per gallon is $140.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it another way. If the car gets 30 miles per gallon, and gas is $3.50 per gallon, then the cost per mile would be $3.50 divided by 30 miles.\n\nLet me calculate that: $3.50 \u00f7 30 miles. That's $0.1167 per mile, roughly.\n\nThen, for 1200 miles, the cost would be 1200 times $0.1167 per mile.\n\nLet me see: 1200 \u00d7 0.1167. Well, 1200 times 0.10 is 120, and 1200 times 0.0167 is approximately 20.04. So, 120 plus 20.04 is $140.04, which is close enough to $140 considering rounding errors.\n\nSo, both methods give me approximately the same answer, which is $140.\n\nI think that's the correct amount they'll spend on gas for the trip.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]"
