        "content": "So John reads 2 books every month, and I need to find out how many books he'll read in 10 years. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that there are 12 months in a year. So, if John reads 2 books each month, then in one year, he would read 2 books/month times 12 months/year. That would be 2 * 12 = 24 books per year.\n\nNow, since we're looking at 10 years, I can multiply the number of books he reads in one year by 10. So, 24 books/year times 10 years would be 24 * 10 = 240 books.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything I'm missing here? Let's double-check. Does the question say anything about him reading the same number of books every month for 10 years? It seems to assume that his reading habit stays constant.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any leap years in those 10 years, but since he reads by the month and not by the day, maybe that doesn't affect the calculation.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any periods where he might read more or less, but based on the information given, it's a consistent 2 books per month.\n\nSo, sticking with the given data, my calculation seems straightforward: 2 books/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 240 books.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me calculate it another way. If he reads 2 books every month, how many books does he read in a decade?\n\nWell, there are 10 years in a decade. Each year has 12 months, so 10 years have 10 * 12 = 120 months.\n\nReading 2 books each month for 120 months would be 2 * 120 = 240 books.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, so I'm confident that 240 books is the correct total for 10 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
