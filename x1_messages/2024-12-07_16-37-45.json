The derivation involves understanding how energy and momentum are related in relativistic mechanics.\n\n### Step 1: Relativistic Momentum\n\nIn classical mechanics, momentum \\( p \\) is given by \\( p = mv \\), where \\( m \\) is the mass and \\( v \\) is the velocity. However, in special relativity, momentum is modified to account for the effects of high speeds approaching the speed of light \\( c \\).\n\nThe relativistic momentum \\( p \\) is:\n\n\\[\np = \\gamma m v\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Relativistic Energy\n\nEinstein proposed that the energy \\( E \\) of a particle is related to its momentum and mass by the equation:\n\n\\[\nE^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2\n\\]\n\nThis equation is analogous to the Pythagorean theorem in space-time, where energy is the total relativistic energy.\n\n### Step 3: Energy at Rest\n\nWhen the particle is at rest, its velocity \\( v = 0 \\), and thus its momentum \\( p = 0 \\). Plugging these into the energy equation:\n\n\\[\nE^2 = (0)^2 + (mc^2)^2 \\implies E = mc^2\n\\]\n\nThis shows that even at rest, a particle with mass \\( m \\) possesses energy \\( E = mc^2 \\), which is the mass-energy equivalence.\n\n### Step 4: General Case\n\nTo understand the general case, consider a particle moving with velocity \\( v \\). Its total energy \\( E \\) is:\n\n\\[\nE = \\gamma mc^2\n\\]\n\nThis can be expanded using the binomial expansion for \\( \\gamma \\) at low velocities (\\( v \\ll c \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\gamma \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nE \\approx mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m v^2\n\\]\n\nThe first term \\( mc^2 \\) is the rest energy, and the second term \\( \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\) is the classical kinetic energy. This shows that the total energy includes both the rest energy and the kinetic energy.\n\n### Step 5: Derivation from Work-Energy Theorem\n\nAnother approach to derive \\( E = mc^2 \\) is through the work-energy theorem. Consider a force \\( F \\) acting on a particle, doing work \\( dW \\) over a distance \\( dx \\):\n\n\\[\ndW = F \\, dx\n\\]\n\nIn special relativity, force is related to the rate of change of momentum:\n\n\\[\nF = \\frac{dp}{dt}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( p = \\gamma m v \\):\n\n\\[\nF = \\frac{d}{dt} (\\gamma m v)\n\\]\n\nThe work done is then:\n\n\\[\ndW = \\frac{d}{dt} (\\gamma m v) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nUsing the chain rule \\( dx = v \\, dt \\):\n\n\\[\ndW = \\frac{d}{dt} (\\gamma m v) \\, v \\, dt = v \\, d(\\gamma m v)\n\\]\n\nIntegrating both sides from rest to velocity \\( v \\):\n\n\\[\nW = \\int_0^v v \\, d(\\gamma m v) = \\gamma m v^2 - \\int_0^v \\gamma m v \\, dv\n\\]\n\nThis integral can be solved to find the total work done, which equals the kinetic energy \\( K \\):\n\n\\[\nK = (\\gamma - 1) m c^2\n\\]\n\nThe total energy \\( E \\) is then:\n\n\\[\nE = K + mc^2 = \\gamma m c^2\n\\]\n\nAt rest (\\( v = 0 \\)), \\( \\gamma = 1 \\), so \\( E = mc^2 \\), reinforcing the mass-energy equivalence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThrough these steps, we have derived Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula \\( E = mc^2 \\) from the principles of special relativity. This fundamental equation demonstrates that mass and energy are interchangeable and that a small amount of mass can be converted into a large amount of energy, as seen in nuclear reactions.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{E = mc^2} \\]"
