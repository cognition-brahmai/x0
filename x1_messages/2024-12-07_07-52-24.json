        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It's a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the family members: there are two parents and four children. The youngest child is 4 years old, and each child is 2 years older than the previous one. So, the ages of the children are:\n\n- Child 1: 4 years old\n\n- Child 2: 4 + 2 = 6 years old\n\n- Child 3: 6 + 2 = 8 years old\n\n- Child 4: 8 + 2 = 10 years old\n\nNow, let's add up their ages: 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 28 years.\n\nThe sum of the ages of all six family members is 140 years. So, the sum of the parents' ages is 140 - 28 = 112 years.\n\nLet's denote the father's current age as F and the mother's current age as M. So, F + M = 112.\n\nNow, the problem states: \"The father is twice as old as the mother was when the father was the age the mother is now.\"\n\nHmm, that's a bit confusing. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, \"the age the mother is now\" is M.\n\nSo, \"when the father was the age the mother is now\" means when the father was M years old.\n\nLet's find out how many years ago that was. If the father is currently F years old, then years ago, when he was M years old, the number of years that had passed was F - M.\n\nSo, at that time, the mother was M - (F - M) = 2M - F years old.\n\nNow, \"the mother was\" at that time is 2M - F.\n\nAccording to the problem, the father is currently twice as old as that age.\n\nSo, F = 2(2M - F)\n\nLet's solve this equation:\n\nF = 4M - 2F\n\nBringing like terms together:\n\nF + 2F = 4M\n\n3F = 4M\n\nSo, F = (4/3)M\n\nNow, we also have F + M = 112\n\nSubstitute F from above:\n\n(4/3)M + M = 112\n\n(4/3)M + (3/3)M = 112\n\n(7/3)M = 112\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n7M = 336\n\nM = 336 / 7\n\nM = 48 years old\n\nNow, F = (4/3)*48 = 64 years old\n\nSo, the father is 64 and the mother is 48.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nWhen the father was 48 (which is the mother's current age), that was 64 - 48 = 16 years ago.\n\nAt that time, the mother was 48 - 16 = 32 years old.\n\nTwice that age is 64, which matches the father's current age.\n\nPerfect, it checks out.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe father is \\boxed{64} years old and the mother is \\boxed{48} years old."
