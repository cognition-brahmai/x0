        "content": "The character you're referring to is Estella Havisham from Charles Dickens' novel \"Great Expectations.\" Estella, who is raised by the eccentric and vengeful Miss Havisham, develops a fascination with the color white. This is particularly evident in her preference for white flowers and her association with whiteness, which symbolizes purity and innocence, though her personality is often cold and unfeeling. The color white plays a significant role in the novel, reflecting themes of purity, corruption, and the complexities of human nature."
