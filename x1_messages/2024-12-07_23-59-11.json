        "content": "Alright, I'm going to design a MySQL database schema for a simple e-commerce website. The website needs to handle products, customers, and orders. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the tables I'll need. It seems like I'll have at least three main tables: one for products, one for customers, and one for orders. But, since orders can have multiple products, I might need an additional table to handle the many-to-many relationship between orders and products.\n\nLet's start with the products table. Each product should have a name, description, price, and stock quantity. I should also give each product a unique identifier, probably an ID.\n\nSo, for the products table:\n\n- product_id (primary key, auto-increment)\n\n- name (varchar)\n\n- description (text)\n\n- price (decimal)\n\n- stock_quantity (integer)\n\nNext, the customers table. Each customer has a first name, last name, email address, and shipping address. Again, each customer should have a unique identifier.\n\nFor the customers table:\n\n- customer_id (primary key, auto-increment)\n\n- first_name (varchar)\n\n- last_name (varchar)\n\n- email (varchar, unique)\n\n- shipping_address (text)\n\nNow, for the orders table. Each order is placed by a customer and can consist of multiple products. Each order should have a shipping status, like pending, shipped, delivered, etc.\n\nFor the orders table:\n\n- order_id (primary key, auto-increment)\n\n- customer_id (foreign key referencing customers.customer_id)\n\n- shipping_status (enum: 'pending', 'shipped', 'delivered')\n\nBut since one order can have multiple products, I need a way to link orders and products. I'll create an orders_products junction table for this many-to-many relationship.\n\nFor the orders_products table:\n\n- order_id (foreign key referencing orders.order_id)\n\n- product_id (foreign key referencing products.product_id)\n\n- quantity (integer)\n\nThis way, each row in orders_products represents a specific product in a specific order, with the quantity of that product in that order.\n\nLet me summarize the schema:\n\n1. products\n\n- product_id (PK, AI)\n\n- name (varchar)\n\n- description (text)\n\n- price (decimal)\n\n- stock_quantity (int)\n\n2. customers\n\n- customer_id (PK, AI)\n\n- first_name (varchar)\n\n- last_name (varchar)\n\n- email (varchar, unique)\n\n- shipping_address (text)\n\n3. orders\n\n- order_id (PK, AI)\n\n- customer_id (FK to customers.customer_id)\n\n- shipping_status (enum)\n\n4. orders_products\n\n- order_id (FK to orders.order_id)\n\n- product_id (FK to products.product_id)\n\n- quantity (int)\n\nI should also consider adding a composite primary key to the orders_products table to prevent duplicate entries of the same product in the same order.\n\nSo, for orders_products:\n\n- order_id (FK)\n\n- product_id (FK)\n\n- quantity (int)\n\nPrimary key: (order_id, product_id)\n\nThis should cover the basic requirements for the e-commerce website's database schema.\n\n**Final Schema:**\n\n```sql\n\nCREATE TABLE products (\n\n    product_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n\n    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n\n    description TEXT,\n\n    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,\n\n    stock_quantity INT NOT NULL\n\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE customers (\n\n    customer_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n\n    first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n\n    last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n\n    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n\n    shipping_address TEXT NOT NULL\n\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE orders (\n\n    order_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n\n    customer_id INT,\n\n    shipping_status ENUM('pending', 'shipped', 'delivered') NOT NULL,\n\n    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)\n\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE orders_products (\n\n    order_id INT,\n\n    product_id INT,\n\n    quantity INT NOT NULL,\n\n    PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id),\n\n    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id),\n\n    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)\n\n);\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **products:** Stores product details with unique product_id.\n\n- **customers:** Stores customer information with unique customer_id and unique email.\n\n- **orders:** Stores order details linked to a customer via customer_id and tracks shipping status.\n\n- **orders_products:** A junction table to manage the many-to-many relationship between orders and products, recording the quantity of each product in an order.\n\nThis schema ensures that each component of the e-commerce system is appropriately linked and can scale with the business needs."
