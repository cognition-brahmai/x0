        "content": "Let's see. So, there's an item that originally costs $200, and there's a discount of 15%. I need to find out what the final price is after applying that discount.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how much the discount amounts to in dollars. If the discount is 15% off the original price, I can calculate that by taking 15% of $200.\n\nTo calculate 15% of $200, I can multiply 200 by 0.15 because percent means per hundred, so 15% is the same as 15/100 or 0.15.\n\nSo, 200 multiplied by 0.15 is... let's do that math. 200 times 0.15 is 30. So, the discount amount is $30.\n\nNow, to find the final price, I need to subtract the discount amount from the original price. So, $200 minus $30.\n\nThat gives me $170.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If the discount is 15%, and I've calculated the discount amount correctly as $30, then subtracting that from the original price should give me the final price.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of another way to calculate the final price directly. Instead of calculating the discount and then subtracting it, I can think of the final price as being 85% of the original price because 100% minus 15% discount is 85%.\n\nSo, 85% of $200 should also give me the final price.\n\nLet me calculate that to verify. 85% of 200 is 0.85 times 200.\n\n0.85 times 200 is 170.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is $170.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nMaybe using fractions. 15% is the same as 15/100, which simplifies to 3/20.\n\nSo, the discount is 3/20 of 200.\n\n3/20 of 200 is (3/20)*200 = (3*200)/20 = 600/20 = 30.\n\nAgain, the discount is $30, and subtracting that from $200 gives $170.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the final price as being 85% of the original price, that's again $170.\n\nI can also consider that a 15% discount means the customer pays 85% of the original price.\n\nSo, 85% of $200 is $170.\n\nAlternatively, if I use decimals, 85% is 0.85, and 0.85 times 200 is 170.\n\nHmm, I keep getting to the same answer. I think it's safe to conclude that the final price after a 15% discount on a $200 item is $170.\n\nBut wait, let's think about real-life scenarios. Sometimes, stores have different ways of applying discounts, especially with sales tax and other factors. But in this case, it seems like a straightforward discount on the original price, with no mention of tax.\n\nSo, I'll assume that tax is not involved here, and it's just a simple percentage discount.\n\nTherefore, the final price is $170.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider another approach.\n\nSuppose I let the original price be P, which is $200, and the discount rate be D, which is 15%.\n\nThe discount amount is P * (D/100) = 200 * (15/100) = 200 * 0.15 = 30.\n\nThen, the final price F is P - discount amount = 200 - 30 = 170.\n\nAlternatively, F = P * (1 - D/100) = 200 * (1 - 0.15) = 200 * 0.85 = 170.\n\nEither way, I end up with $170.\n\nI can't think of any other method to calculate this, and all approaches give me the same answer.\n\nI think it's confident to say that the final price is $170.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{170} \\]"
