        "content": "So there's a class with 30 students in total, and out of those, 12 are girls. You want to find out what percentage of the class is made up of boys. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to figure out how many boys there are in the class. Since the total number of students is 30 and there are 12 girls, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students to get the number of boys.\n\nSo, number of boys = total students - number of girls\nNumber of boys = 30 - 12\nNumber of boys = 18\n\nNow, we have 18 boys out of 30 students. To find out what percentage this represents, we can use the formula for percentage:\n\nPercentage = (part / whole) * 100\n\nIn this case, the \"part\" is the number of boys, which is 18, and the \"whole\" is the total number of students, which is 30.\n\nSo, percentage of boys = (18 / 30) * 100\n\nNow, let's do the division first:\n\n18 divided by 30 is 0.6\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n0.6 * 100 = 60%\n\nTherefore, 60% of the class is made up of boys.\n\nTo double-check, we can also calculate the percentage of girls and see if both percentages add up to 100%.\n\nNumber of girls is 12 out of 30.\n\nPercentage of girls = (12 / 30) * 100 = 0.4 * 100 = 40%\n\nNow, adding the percentages: 60% (boys) + 40% (girls) = 100%\n\nIt all adds up correctly.\n\nSo, the answer is 60%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60\\%} \\]"
