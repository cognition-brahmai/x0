        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company with a net income of $250,000, and we're told that its operating expenses are 60% of its revenue. We need to find out what the company's revenue is.\n\nFirst, let's understand what net income is. Net income is generally calculated by subtracting all expenses from the total revenue. So, net income = revenue - expenses.\n\nIn this case, we're told that operating expenses are 60% of revenue. So, expenses = 60% of revenue, or in other words, expenses = 0.6 * revenue.\n\nNow, plugging this into the net income formula, we get:\n\nNet income = revenue - (0.6 * revenue)\n\nWe know the net income is $250,000, so:\n\n$250,000 = revenue - (0.6 * revenue)\n\nNow, let's simplify the right side of the equation:\n\nRevenue - 0.6 * revenue = (1 - 0.6) * revenue = 0.4 * revenue\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n$250,000 = 0.4 * revenue\n\nTo find the revenue, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:\n\nRevenue = $250,000 / 0.4\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n$250,000 divided by 0.4 is $625,000.\n\nSo, the company's revenue is $625,000.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nNet income = revenue - expenses\n\nExpenses = 60% of revenue = 0.6 * revenue\n\nSo, net income = revenue - 0.6 * revenue = 0.4 * revenue\n\nGiven that net income is $250,000:\n\n$250,000 = 0.4 * revenue\n\nTherefore, revenue = $250,000 / 0.4 = $625,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about it in terms of percentages. If operating expenses are 60% of revenue, then net income is the remaining 40% of revenue. So, 40% of revenue is $250,000, and 100% of revenue would be $250,000 divided by 40% (or 0.4), which again gives us $625,000.\n\nSo, the company's revenue is $625,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{625000} \\]"
