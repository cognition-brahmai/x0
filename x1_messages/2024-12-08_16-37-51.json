        "content": "So I know that there are 12 months in a year, and each month has a different number of days. Some have 30 days, some have 31, and February is the odd one out with either 28 or 29 days. The question is asking how many months have less than 31 days.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which months have 31 days and which have less than that. I remember that the months with 31 days are January, March, May, July, August, October, and December. That's seven months.\n\nNow, since there are 12 months in total, and seven of them have 31 days, that means the remaining months have less than 31 days. So, 12 minus 7 is 5 months.\n\nBut wait, February is one of those months, and it has either 28 or 29 days, which is less than 31. So, including February, there are five months with less than 31 days.\n\nJust to double-check, let's list out all the months and their days:\n\n- January: 31 days\n\n- February: 28 or 29 days\n\n- March: 31 days\n\n- April: 30 days\n\n- May: 31 days\n\n- June: 30 days\n\n- July: 31 days\n\n- August: 31 days\n\n- September: 30 days\n\n- October: 31 days\n\n- November: 30 days\n\n- December: 31 days\n\nFrom this list, the months with less than 31 days are February, April, June, September, and November. That's five months.\n\nSo, the answer should be five months have less than 31 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
