        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train traveling from Town A to Town B, covering a distance of 300 miles. The problem states that if the train's speed were increased by 20 mph, it would take one hour less to cover that same distance. We need to find the original speed of the train.\n\nFirst, let's recall the basic formula that relates distance, speed, and time:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} \\]\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for time:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} \\]\n\nLet's denote the original speed of the train as \\( s \\) mph. Therefore, the time it takes to travel from Town A to Town B at the original speed is:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{300}{s} \\] hours\n\nNow, if the speed is increased by 20 mph, the new speed becomes \\( s + 20 \\) mph. According to the problem, the time taken at this new speed is one hour less than the original time. So, the time at the increased speed is:\n\n\\[ t - 1 = \\frac{300}{s + 20} \\] hours\n\nNow, we can set up an equation based on these two expressions for time:\n\n\\[ \\frac{300}{s} - 1 = \\frac{300}{s + 20} \\]\n\nOur goal is to solve for \\( s \\). Let's manipulate this equation to find \\( s \\).\n\nFirst, let's isolate one of the fractions. I'll move \\( \\frac{300}{s + 20} \\) to the left side:\n\n\\[ \\frac{300}{s} - \\frac{300}{s + 20} = 1 \\]\n\nNow, let's find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side. The common denominator for \\( s \\) and \\( s + 20 \\) is \\( s(s + 20) \\). Let's rewrite both fractions with this common denominator:\n\n\\[ \\frac{300(s + 20) - 300s}{s(s + 20)} = 1 \\]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n\\[ 300(s + 20) - 300s = 300s + 6000 - 300s = 6000 \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ \\frac{6000}{s(s + 20)} = 1 \\]\n\nNow, we can solve for \\( s \\) by cross-multiplying:\n\n\\[ 6000 = s(s + 20) \\]\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n\\[ s^2 + 20s - 6000 = 0 \\]\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[ s^2 + 20s - 6000 = 0 \\]\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can either factor it, complete the square, or use the quadratic formula. Let's try to factor it first.\n\nWe need two numbers that multiply to \\( -6000 \\) and add up to \\( 20 \\). Let's think about what those numbers could be.\n\nAfter some trial and error, I find that \\( 80 \\) and \\( -75 \\) work because:\n\n\\[ 80 \\times (-75) = -6000 \\]\n\n\\[ 80 + (-75) = 5 \\]\n\nWait, that's not adding up to 20. Let me try again.\n\nActually, perhaps it's better to use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nFor our equation \\( s^2 + 20s - 6000 = 0 \\), the coefficients are:\n\n\\[ a = 1, b = 20, c = -6000 \\]\n\nPlugging these into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{-20 \\pm \\sqrt{20^2 - 4(1)(-6000)}}{2(1)} \\]\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{-20 \\pm \\sqrt{400 + 24000}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{-20 \\pm \\sqrt{24400}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{-20 \\pm 156.205}{2} \\]\n\nLet's calculate both possible solutions:\n\nFirst, using the positive square root:\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{-20 + 156.205}{2} = \\frac{136.205}{2} = 68.1025 \\] mph\n\nNow, using the negative square root:\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{-20 - 156.205}{2} = \\frac{-176.205}{2} = -88.1025 \\] mph\n\nSince speed cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution. Therefore, the original speed of the train is approximately 68.1025 mph.\n\nHowever, let's check if this makes sense by plugging it back into the original conditions.\n\nOriginal time: \\( t = \\frac{300}{68.1025} \\approx 4.404 \\) hours\n\nIncreased speed: \\( 68.1025 + 20 = 88.1025 \\) mph\n\nTime at increased speed: \\( t - 1 = 4.404 - 1 = 3.404 \\) hours\n\nLet's verify if time at increased speed matches \\( \\frac{300}{88.1025} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{300}{88.1025} \\approx 3.404 \\] hours\n\nYes, it matches. So, our solution seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could have factored the quadratic equation, but given the numbers, the quadratic formula was more straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the original speed of the train is approximately 68.1 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
