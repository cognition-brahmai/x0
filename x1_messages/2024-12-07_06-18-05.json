        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a sphere has a surface area of 100 square inches, and I need to find its volume. I know there are formulas for both surface area and volume of a sphere. The surface area formula is A equals 4 times pi times the radius squared, and the volume formula is V equals four-thirds pi times the radius cubed. So, A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2 and V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3.\n\nOkay, so I have the surface area, which is 100 square inches, and I need to find the volume. I think the first step is to use the surface area formula to find the radius, and then use that radius to find the volume. Does that make sense?\n\nSo, starting with the surface area formula:\n\nA = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n\nI know A is 100, so:\n\n100 = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n\nNow, I need to solve for r. First, I can divide both sides by 4 to isolate \u03c0r\u00b2.\n\n100 \u00f7 4 = 25, so:\n\n25 = \u03c0r\u00b2\n\nNext, divide both sides by \u03c0 to solve for r\u00b2.\n\nr\u00b2 = 25 / \u03c0\n\nNow, to find r, I take the square root of both sides.\n\nr = \u221a(25 / \u03c0)\n\nI can simplify that to:\n\nr = 5 / \u221a\u03c0\n\nHmm, maybe I can rationalize the denominator.\n\nr = 5 / \u221a\u03c0 \u00d7 \u221a\u03c0 / \u221a\u03c0 = (5\u221a\u03c0) / \u03c0\n\nSo, r = (5\u221a\u03c0) / \u03c0\n\nAlternatively, I can leave it as r = 5 / \u221a\u03c0. For now, I'll keep it like that.\n\nNow that I have the radius, I can plug it into the volume formula.\n\nV = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\n\nSubstitute r = 5 / \u221a\u03c0:\n\nV = (4/3)\u03c0 (5 / \u221a\u03c0)^3\n\nHmm, okay, let's calculate (5 / \u221a\u03c0)^3\n\nFirst, 5^3 is 125.\n\nThen, (\u221a\u03c0)^3 is (\u03c0^(1/2))^3 = \u03c0^(3/2)\n\nSo, (5 / \u221a\u03c0)^3 = 125 / \u03c0^(3/2)\n\nNow, plug that back into the volume formula:\n\nV = (4/3)\u03c0 \u00d7 (125 / \u03c0^(3/2))\n\nSimplify this expression.\n\nFirst, \u03c0 multiplied by 125 is 125\u03c0.\n\nThen, divided by \u03c0^(3/2).\n\nSo, 125\u03c0 / \u03c0^(3/2) = 125 \u00d7 \u03c0^(1 - 3/2) = 125 \u00d7 \u03c0^(-1/2)\n\nWhich is 125 / \u03c0^(1/2) = 125 / \u221a\u03c0\n\nNow, multiply by 4/3:\n\nV = (4/3) \u00d7 (125 / \u221a\u03c0) = (500 / 3) \u00d7 (1 / \u221a\u03c0)\n\nHmm, maybe I can rationalize the denominator again.\n\nV = (500 / 3) \u00d7 (1 / \u221a\u03c0) \u00d7 (\u221a\u03c0 / \u221a\u03c0) = (500 / 3) \u00d7 (\u221a\u03c0 / \u03c0) = (500\u221a\u03c0) / (3\u03c0)\n\nSo, V = (500\u221a\u03c0) / (3\u03c0)\n\nAlternatively, I can leave it as V = (500 / 3) \u00d7 (1 / \u221a\u03c0)\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to simplify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use decimal approximation for \u03c0 to get a numerical value.\n\nLet me check if the problem asks for an exact value or an approximation.\n\nThe problem says \"use the formula for surface area: A = 4\u03c0r^2 and the formula for volume: V = 4/3\u03c0r^3.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify whether to use an approximation for \u03c0 or not.\n\nMaybe I should leave the answer in terms of \u03c0.\n\nSo, V = (500\u221a\u03c0) / (3\u03c0)\n\nAlternatively, I can write it as V = (500) / (3\u221a\u03c0)\n\nBut perhaps I should check if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a relationship between surface area and volume that I can use directly, without solving for the radius first.\n\nLet me think about it.\n\nI know that surface area A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2 and volume V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3.\n\nIf I solve the surface area formula for r\u00b2, I get r\u00b2 = A / (4\u03c0)\n\nThen, r = \u221a(A / (4\u03c0))\n\nNow, substitute this into the volume formula:\n\nV = (4/3)\u03c0 [\u221a(A / (4\u03c0))]\u00b3\n\nLet me compute [\u221a(A / (4\u03c0))]\u00b3\n\nFirst, \u221a(A / (4\u03c0)) = (A / (4\u03c0))^(1/2)\n\nThen, [(A / (4\u03c0))^(1/2)]\u00b3 = (A / (4\u03c0))^(3/2)\n\nSo, V = (4/3)\u03c0 \u00d7 (A / (4\u03c0))^(3/2)\n\nNow, simplify this expression.\n\nFirst, (A / (4\u03c0))^(3/2) = A^(3/2) / (4\u03c0)^(3/2)\n\nSo, V = (4/3)\u03c0 \u00d7 A^(3/2) / (4\u03c0)^(3/2)\n\nNow, (4\u03c0)^(3/2) = (4)^(3/2) \u00d7 (\u03c0)^(3/2) = 8 \u00d7 \u03c0^(3/2)\n\nBecause 4^(3/2) = (2^2)^(3/2) = 2^3 = 8\n\nSo, V = (4/3)\u03c0 \u00d7 A^(3/2) / (8\u03c0^(3/2))\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: (4/3)\u03c0 \u00d7 A^(3/2)\n\nDenominator: 8\u03c0^(3/2)\n\nSo, V = [(4/3)\u03c0 A^(3/2)] / [8\u03c0^(3/2)]\n\nNow, simplify the fraction:\n\nFirst, (4/3) / 8 = (4/3) \u00d7 (1/8) = 4/(3\u00d78) = 4/24 = 1/6\n\nSecond, \u03c0 / \u03c0^(3/2) = \u03c0^(1 - 3/2) = \u03c0^(-1/2) = 1 / \u03c0^(1/2) = 1 / \u221a\u03c0\n\nThird, A^(3/2) remains as it is.\n\nSo, V = (1/6) \u00d7 (1 / \u221a\u03c0) \u00d7 A^(3/2)\n\nTherefore, V = A^(3/2) / (6\u221a\u03c0)\n\nNow, plug in A = 100:\n\nV = 100^(3/2) / (6\u221a\u03c0)\n\nCalculate 100^(3/2):\n\n100^(3/2) = (100^(1/2))^3 = 10^3 = 1000\n\nSo, V = 1000 / (6\u221a\u03c0)\n\nSimplify 1000 / 6 = 500 / 3\n\nSo, V = (500 / 3) / \u221a\u03c0 = 500 / (3\u221a\u03c0)\n\nThis is the same result I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I can rationalize the denominator:\n\nV = 500 / (3\u221a\u03c0) \u00d7 (\u221a\u03c0 / \u221a\u03c0) = (500\u221a\u03c0) / (3\u03c0)\n\nSo, V = (500\u221a\u03c0) / (3\u03c0)\n\nThis seems to be the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the approximation \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416 to find a numerical value.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, \u221a\u03c0 \u2248 \u221a3.1416 \u2248 1.7725\n\nThen, V \u2248 500 / (3 \u00d7 1.7725) \u2248 500 / 5.3175 \u2248 94.03\n\nSo, V \u2248 94.03 cubic inches.\n\nBut maybe I should check my calculations again to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me go back to the beginning.\n\nGiven A = 100 = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n\nSolve for r\u00b2: r\u00b2 = 100 / (4\u03c0) = 25 / \u03c0\n\nThen, r = \u221a(25 / \u03c0) = 5 / \u221a\u03c0\n\nNow, V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0 (5 / \u221a\u03c0)^3\n\nCompute (5 / \u221a\u03c0)^3 = 125 / \u03c0^(3/2)\n\nSo, V = (4/3)\u03c0 \u00d7 125 / \u03c0^(3/2) = (4/3) \u00d7 125 / \u03c0^(1/2) = (500) / (3\u221a\u03c0)\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I had earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the direct formula I derived:\n\nV = A^(3/2) / (6\u221a\u03c0) = 100^(3/2) / (6\u221a\u03c0) = 1000 / (6\u221a\u03c0) = 500 / (3\u221a\u03c0)\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, the volume is 500 / (3\u221a\u03c0) cubic inches.\n\nAlternatively, rationalized, it's (500\u221a\u03c0) / (3\u03c0) cubic inches.\n\nOr approximately 94.03 cubic inches.\n\nI think for the final answer, I'll present both the exact form and the approximation.\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere is V = 500 / (3\u221a\u03c0) cubic inches, which is approximately 94.03 cubic inches.\n\nWait a second, maybe I can check this with a different approach.\n\nLet me see, is there another way to relate surface area and volume for a sphere?\n\nI recall that for a sphere, the surface area is the derivative of the volume with respect to the radius.\n\nThat is, dV/dr = A.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLet me check.\n\nGiven V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, then dV/dr = 4\u03c0r\u00b2, which is indeed the surface area A.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps me here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the ratio of volume to surface area.\n\nLet me think.\n\nThe volume is V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, and the surface area is A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2.\n\nSo, V/A = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 / 4\u03c0r\u00b2 = (4/3)r / 4 = r / 3\n\nTherefore, V = (A r) / 3\n\nBut I still have r in terms of A, which is r = \u221a(A / (4\u03c0))\n\nSo, V = [A \u00d7 \u221a(A / (4\u03c0))] / 3\n\nWhich is similar to what I had before.\n\nThis seems to be consistent with my earlier approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula that directly relates volume and surface area without solving for radius.\n\nBut I'm not recalling one right now.\n\nMaybe I should just stick with my original approach.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nGiven A = 100 = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n\nSolved for r: r = 5 / \u221a\u03c0\n\nThen, V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0 (5 / \u221a\u03c0)^3 = 500 / (3\u221a\u03c0)\n\nAlternatively, V \u2248 94.03 cubic inches.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{500}{3\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\approx 94.03 \\text{ cubic inches}} \\]"
