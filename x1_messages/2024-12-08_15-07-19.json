        "content": "Yes, Kenneth Arnold is credited with coining the term \"flying saucer\" to describe the unidentified flying objects he observed on June 24, 1947, while flying his private plane near Mount Rainier in Washington state. Arnold reported seeing nine silvery, crescent-shaped objects flying in formation at high speed. When asked to describe their movement, he likened it to saucers skipping across water, hence the term \"flying saucers.\" This sighting garnered significant media attention and is often considered the beginning of the modern UFO phenomenon."
