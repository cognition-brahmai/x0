        "content": "So, we have this problem here about two trains starting from different stations and moving towards each other. Train A is going at 60 km/h and Train B at 40 km/h, and the distance between the stations is 500 km. We need to find out after how many hours they'll meet.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. Both trains are moving towards each other, so their speeds will add up relative to each other. That makes sense because when two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.\n\nSo, Train A's speed: 60 km/h\nTrain B's speed: 40 km/h\nCombined speed: 60 + 40 = 100 km/h\n\nNow, the total distance between them is 500 km. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nIn this case, the distance is 500 km and the combined speed is 100 km/h.\n\nSo, Time = 500 km / 100 km/h = 5 hours\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there anything I'm missing here?\n\nLet me think again. Maybe I should consider their individual distances traveled and set up an equation.\n\nLet's say they meet after t hours.\n\nIn t hours, Train A would have traveled 60t km.\nIn the same t hours, Train B would have traveled 40t km.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they've traveled should equal the total distance between the stations.\n\nSo, 60t + 40t = 500\n\nCombining like terms, 100t = 500\n\nNow, solving for t: t = 500 / 100 = 5 hours\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, it seems like they'll meet after 5 hours.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about it another way.\n\nMaybe I can think about how much distance they cover together each hour.\n\nTrain A covers 60 km every hour, and Train B covers 40 km every hour. Together, they cover 100 km every hour.\n\nSo, to cover 500 km, it would take them 500 / 100 = 5 hours.\n\nAlright, consistent again.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about their relative speed. Since they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is 100 km/h, and the time to cover 500 km at that speed is again 5 hours.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
