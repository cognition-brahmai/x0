        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces widgets at a rate of 200 per hour. Each shipment requires 2 hours of production time. So, in 2 hours, the factory produces 200 widgets/hour * 2 hours = 400 widgets per shipment.\n\nAdditionally, each shipment requires 30 minutes for packaging. So, total time per shipment is 2 hours for production plus 0.5 hours for packaging, which equals 2.5 hours per shipment.\n\nNow, the factory operates for a 10-hour workday. To find out how many shipments can be completed in that time, we divide the total workday hours by the time required per shipment.\n\nSo, number of shipments = total workday hours / time per shipment = 10 hours / 2.5 hours per shipment.\n\nLet me calculate that: 10 divided by 2.5 is 4.\n\nTherefore, the factory can complete 4 shipments in a 10-hour workday.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If each shipment takes 2.5 hours, and you have 10 hours, then 10 / 2.5 does indeed equal 4.\n\nSo, the final answer is 4 shipments.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
