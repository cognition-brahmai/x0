        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a jar with 4 red marbles, 6 blue marbles, and 2 green marbles. So, in total, there are 4 + 6 + 2 = 12 marbles in the jar.\n\nThe question is about finding the probability of drawing a red marble followed by a blue marble without replacing the first marble drawn. Okay, so it's a sequence of two events: first drawing a red marble, and then, without putting it back, drawing a blue marble.\n\nFirst, I need to find the probability of drawing a red marble on the first draw. Since there are 4 red marbles out of 12 total marbles, the probability is 4/12, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nNow, after drawing a red marble and not replacing it, the total number of marbles left in the jar is 11. The number of blue marbles remains 6 because we only drew a red one.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a blue marble on the second draw, given that the first marble drawn was red and not replaced, is 6/11.\n\nTo find the overall probability of both events happening in sequence, I need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, the total probability is (1/3) * (6/11).\n\nLet's calculate that: (1/3) * (6/11) = (1 * 6) / (3 * 11) = 6 / 33.\n\nThis can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3: 6 \u00f7 3 = 2, and 33 \u00f7 3 = 11. So, the simplified fraction is 2/11.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a red marble followed by a blue marble without replacement is 2/11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{11}} \\]"
