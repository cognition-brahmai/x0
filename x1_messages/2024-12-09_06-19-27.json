        "content": "I'm glad you're delving into bioinformatics! Sequence alignment is indeed a fundamental concept in this field. Let's explore the options you've provided to understand which one best describes its primary purpose.\n\nOption A suggests that sequence alignment is used to identify regions of similarity that may indicate functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between sequences. This sounds quite plausible because in biology, similar sequences often share common ancestry or perform similar functions.\n\nOption B mentions calculating the molecular weight of the sequence. While molecular weight is an important property of biological molecules, it's not directly related to sequence alignment. Molecular weight can be calculated directly from the sequence without aligning it to other sequences.\n\nOption C is about predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein. While sequence alignment can be a part of the process to predict protein structure, especially by comparing to known structures, it's not the primary purpose of sequence alignment.\n\nOption D refers to determining the GC content of the sequence. GC content is the percentage of nucleotides that are either guanine (G) or cytosine (C), which can be important for understanding DNA stability and other properties. However, this is a straightforward calculation from a single sequence and doesn't require alignment with other sequences.\n\nGiven these explanations, it seems that option A is the most accurate description of the primary purpose of sequence alignment. By aligning sequences, biologists can uncover similarities that suggest shared functions, structures, or evolutionary histories.\n\nBut to ensure a comprehensive understanding, let's consider why the other options aren't the primary purposes:\n\n- Calculating molecular weight (Option B) is a basic property derived directly from the sequence composition without needing to compare it to other sequences.\n\n- Predicting protein structure (Option C) often involves sequence alignment as a tool, but alignment itself is not primarily for structure prediction. It's more about comparing sequences to find similarities.\n\n- Determining GC content (Option D) is another property that can be calculated without aligning sequences to any references.\n\nTherefore, the primary purpose of sequence alignment is indeed to identify regions of similarity among sequences, which can provide insights into their functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
