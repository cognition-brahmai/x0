        "content": "So, you've got $10,000 that you're putting into a savings account, and this account earns an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded annually. You want to know how much money will be in the account after three years. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand what \"compounded annually\" means. When interest is compounded annually, it means that the interest earned each year is added to the principal amount, and the next year's interest is calculated on this new total.\n\nSo, starting with $10,000, let's calculate the amount for each year.\n\n**Year 1:**\n\nInterest for the first year = 5% of $10,000 = 0.05 * $10,000 = $500\n\nTotal amount at the end of Year 1 = Principal + Interest = $10,000 + $500 = $10,500\n\n**Year 2:**\n\nNow, the principal for the second year is $10,500.\n\nInterest for the second year = 5% of $10,500 = 0.05 * $10,500 = $525\n\nTotal amount at the end of Year 2 = $10,500 + $525 = $11,025\n\n**Year 3:**\n\nPrincipal for the third year is $11,025.\n\nInterest for the third year = 5% of $11,025 = 0.05 * $11,025 = $551.25\n\nTotal amount at the end of Year 3 = $11,025 + $551.25 = $11,576.25\n\nSo, after three years, the account will have $11,576.25.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula for compound interest that can make this calculation quicker. The formula is:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this case, since the interest is compounded annually, n = 1.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nP = $10,000\n\nr = 5% = 0.05\n\nn = 1\n\nt = 3\n\n\\[ A = 10,000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.05}{1}\\right)^{1 \\times 3} = 10,000 \\left(1 + 0.05\\right)^3 = 10,000 \\left(1.05\\right)^3 \\]\n\nCalculating \\( (1.05)^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 1.05^3 = 1.157625 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ A = 10,000 \\times 1.157625 = 11,576.25 \\]\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, after three years, the account will have $11,576.25.\n\n**Additional Insight:**\n\nIt's worth noting that if the interest were not compounded (i.e., simple interest), the calculation would be different. With simple interest, the interest is calculated only on the initial principal, not on the accumulated amount.\n\nFor simple interest:\n\nTotal interest = P * r * t = 10,000 * 0.05 * 3 = $1,500\n\nTotal amount = P + interest = $10,000 + $1,500 = $11,500\n\nSo, with compound interest, the final amount is higher by $76.25 compared to simple interest over the same period. This demonstrates the power of compounding, where interest earns interest over time.\n\n**Future Considerations:**\n\nIf the compounding frequency were different, say quarterly or monthly, the formula would adjust accordingly. For example, if the interest is compounded quarterly, n would be 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year), and the calculation would reflect that.\n\nAdditionally, some accounts may have different terms, such as different interest rates or compounding periods, so it's always a good idea to check the specific terms of the account.\n\nIn summary, for this scenario, with annual compounding, the amount after three years would be $11,576.25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11576.25} \\]"
