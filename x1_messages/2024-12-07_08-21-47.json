        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a store sells a pack of 12 pencils for $3.00, and I need to buy 50 pencils. I need to find out the least amount of money I can spend. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many packs of 12 pencils I need to buy to get at least 50 pencils. So, I'll divide 50 by 12.\n\n50 \u00f7 12 = 4.1667. That means I need more than 4 packs to get 50 pencils. Since I can't buy a fraction of a pack, I'll need to buy 5 packs.\n\nNow, each pack costs $3.00, so 5 packs would cost 5 \u00d7 $3.00 = $15.00.\n\nBut wait, 5 packs give me 5 \u00d7 12 = 60 pencils, which is more than I need. I only need 50 pencils. Is there a way to buy fewer packs and still get at least 50 pencils?\n\nIf I buy 4 packs, that's 4 \u00d7 12 = 48 pencils, which is less than 50. So, that's not enough. Buying 5 packs gives me 60 pencils, which is more than enough, but I'm wondering if there's a better way to minimize the cost.\n\nMaybe the store sells pencils in different pack sizes or offers discounts for buying multiple packs. But based on the information given, I only know about the packs of 12 pencils for $3.00 each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store sells individual pencils, but again, that's not mentioned. So, I'll assume that the only option is to buy packs of 12 pencils for $3.00 each.\n\nIn that case, buying 5 packs is the only way to get at least 50 pencils, even though I'll end up with 10 extra pencils.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can buy 4 packs and then buy some individual pencils to make up the difference. But the problem doesn't mention anything about selling individual pencils, so I might not be able to do that.\n\nUnless perhaps there's a way to buy a smaller pack or maybe the store sells pencils in other pack sizes that I don't know about. But again, the problem only mentions packs of 12 for $3.00.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can buy packs from different stores or look for better deals, but again, the problem seems to imply that I'm only buying from this one store.\n\nSo, assuming that the only option is to buy packs of 12 pencils for $3.00 each, then buying 5 packs is necessary to get at least 50 pencils, and that would cost $15.00.\n\nBut I feel like there might be a better way. Let me think differently.\n\nWhat if I consider the cost per pencil? If a pack of 12 pencils costs $3.00, then each pencil costs $3.00 \u00f7 12 = $0.25 per pencil.\n\nSo, if I need 50 pencils, at $0.25 each, the total cost would be 50 \u00d7 $0.25 = $12.50.\n\nBut wait, the store doesn't sell individual pencils; they only sell packs of 12 for $3.00 each. So, I can't actually buy exactly 50 pencils; I have to buy whole packs.\n\nTherefore, I still need to buy 5 packs to get 60 pencils, spending $15.00.\n\nIs there any way to spend less than $15.00 and still get at least 50 pencils?\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe if I buy packs from another store or look for a better deal, but again, the problem seems to be set in this one store.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to buy a larger pack that I don't know about, but again, the problem only mentions packs of 12 for $3.00.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can buy in bulk and get a discount, but that's not specified.\n\nGiven the information provided, it seems that buying 5 packs of 12 pencils for $3.00 each is the only option, totaling $15.00 for 60 pencils.\n\nTherefore, the least amount I can spend to get at least 50 pencils is $15.00.\n\nBut I'm still thinking, maybe there's a mathematical approach to this.\n\nLet me consider it in terms of cost per pencil.\n\nEach pack costs $3.00 for 12 pencils, which is $0.25 per pencil.\n\nIf I could buy exactly 50 pencils at $0.25 each, it would cost $12.50.\n\nHowever, since I can only buy whole packs, I have to buy enough packs to cover 50 pencils.\n\nSo, number of packs needed is the ceiling of 50 divided by 12, which is 5 packs.\n\nTherefore, the total cost is 5 \u00d7 $3.00 = $15.00.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can buy 4 packs and then find another way to get the remaining pencils.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't mention any other purchasing options, I can't assume that I can buy individual pencils.\n\nTherefore, I have to stick with buying whole packs.\n\nHence, the least amount I can spend is $15.00.\n\nWait, but maybe I can look for another store or find a better deal, but that's not within the scope of the problem.\n\nThe problem states that I'm buying from this store that sells packs of 12 pencils for $3.00, and I need to buy 50 pencils.\n\nSo, given those constraints, buying 5 packs for $15.00 is the only option.\n\nTherefore, the least amount I can spend is $15.00.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way.\n\nSuppose the store has a policy that if you buy multiple packs, you get a discount.\n\nBut again, the problem doesn't mention any such policy.\n\nTherefore, I can't assume any discounts beyond what's stated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the store sells pencils in other pack sizes, but again, that's not mentioned.\n\nTherefore, I have to go with the information provided.\n\nSo, the answer is $15.00.\n\nWait, but the cost per pencil is $0.25, and 50 pencils would be $12.50, but since I can't buy fractional packs, I have to buy 5 packs for $15.00.\n\nTherefore, the least I can spend is $15.00.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a way to get the extra 10 pencils without buying a whole pack, but again, that's not possible based on the information given.\n\nTherefore, $15.00 is the least I can spend.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nNumber of packs needed: 50 \u00f7 12 = 4.1667, so 5 packs.\n\nCost: 5 \u00d7 $3.00 = $15.00.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the least amount I can spend is $15.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
