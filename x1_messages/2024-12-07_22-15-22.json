        "content": "So you're asking about how many different 5-card poker hands can be dealt from a standard deck of 52 playing cards. This sounds like a problem in combinatorics, which is the branch of mathematics concerned with counting and combinations.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basic principles of combinatorics. When dealing with combinations, the order doesn't matter, right? So, unlike permutations where the sequence is important, in combinations, it's just about which items are chosen, not the order in which they're chosen.\n\nGiven that, the formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items,\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose,\n\n- \\( n! \\) denotes the factorial of \\( n \\), which is the product of all positive integers up to \\( n \\).\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 52 \\) (the total number of cards in the deck), and \\( k = 5 \\) (since we're dealing 5-card hands).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\nC(52, 5) = \\frac{52!}{5!(52 - 5)!} = \\frac{52!}{5! \\cdot 47!}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculating factorials of large numbers like 52! can be cumbersome, but we can simplify this expression. Notice that \\( 52! \\) is \\( 52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\times 48 \\times 47! \\), so the \\( 47! \\) in the numerator and denominator will cancel out:\n\n\\[\nC(52, 5) = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\times 48 \\times 47!}{5! \\times 47!} = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\times 48}{5!}\n\\]\n\nNext, I need to calculate \\( 5! \\):\n\n\\[\n5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\n\\]\n\nSo now the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\nC(52, 5) = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\times 48}{120}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's compute the numerator:\n\n\\[\n52 \\times 51 = 2,652\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2,652 \\times 50 = 132,600\n\\]\n\n\\[\n132,600 \\times 49 = 6,500,400\n\\]\n\n\\[\n6,500,400 \\times 48 = 312,019,200\n\\]\n\nSo, the numerator is 312,019,200.\n\nNow, divide this by the denominator, which is 120:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{312,019,200}{120} = 2,600,160\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems too high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nLet me recalculate the numerator step by step:\n\n\\[\n52 \\times 51 = 2,652\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2,652 \\times 50 = 132,600\n\\]\n\n\\[\n132,600 \\times 49 = 6,500,400\n\\]\n\n\\[\n6,500,400 \\times 48 = 312,019,200\n\\]\n\nOkay, that's correct.\n\nNow, dividing 312,019,200 by 120:\n\n\\[\n312,019,200 \\div 120 = 2,600,160\n\\]\n\nBut I have a feeling this might be incorrect because I recall that the number of 5-card hands from a 52-card deck is around 2.6 million, but I want to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can simplify the calculation by canceling out some terms before multiplying.\n\nLet's try that:\n\n\\[\nC(52, 5) = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\times 48}{5!} = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\times 48}{120}\n\\]\n\nI can divide numerator and denominator by 52 and 120.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to simplify step by step.\n\nFirst, divide the numerator and denominator by 52 and 120.\n\nWait, perhaps dividing 52 by 120 isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I can divide 52 by 4 (since 120 is divisible by 4):\n\n52 \u00f7 4 = 13\n\n120 \u00f7 4 = 30\n\nSo now, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\nC(52, 5) = \\frac{13 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\times 48}{30}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's multiply the numerator:\n\n13 \u00d7 51 = 663\n\n663 \u00d7 50 = 33,150\n\n33,150 \u00d7 49 = 1,624,350\n\n1,624,350 \u00d7 48 = 77,968,800\n\nNow, divide by the denominator, which is 30:\n\n77,968,800 \u00f7 30 = 2,598,960\n\nAh, that seems more familiar. I must have made a calculation error earlier.\n\nSo, the number of different 5-card poker hands is 2,598,960.\n\nTo confirm, I can think about it step by step again.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[\nC(52, 5) = \\frac{52!}{5! \\cdot 47!} = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\times 48}{5!} = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\times 48}{120}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 4 (since 52 and 120 are both divisible by 4):\n\nNumerator: 52 \u00f7 4 = 13\n\nDenominator: 120 \u00f7 4 = 30\n\nSo now:\n\n\\[\nC(52, 5) = \\frac{13 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\times 48}{30}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate numerator:\n\n13 \u00d7 51 = 663\n\n663 \u00d7 50 = 33,150\n\n33,150 \u00d7 49 = 1,624,350\n\n1,624,350 \u00d7 48 = 77,968,800\n\nNow, divide by denominator:\n\n77,968,800 \u00f7 30 = 2,598,960\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if this matches known values. I recall that the number of 5-card hands from a 52-card deck is indeed 2,598,960.\n\nTherefore, the number of different 5-card poker hands that can be dealt is 2,598,960.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2598960} \\]"
