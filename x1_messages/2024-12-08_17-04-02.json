        "content": "So the restaurant serves 150 meals per day, and each meal consists of 1 main dish, 2 side dishes, and 1 dessert. I need to find out how many individual items they serve in a week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many items are in one meal. Let's add them up:\n\n- 1 main dish\n\n- 2 side dishes\n\n- 1 dessert\n\nSo, total items per meal = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 items.\n\nNow, the restaurant serves 150 meals per day. So, the total number of items per day would be:\n\n150 meals/day \u00d7 4 items/meal = 600 items/day.\n\nNext, to find out the weekly total, I need to know how many days are in a week. There are 7 days in a week.\n\nTherefore, total items per week = 600 items/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 4200 items/week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should break it down further to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet's consider each type of item separately.\n\n- Main dishes: 1 per meal, 150 meals per day, so 150 main dishes per day.\n\n- Side dishes: 2 per meal, 150 meals per day, so 300 side dishes per day.\n\n- Desserts: 1 per meal, 150 meals per day, so 150 desserts per day.\n\nTotal items per day = 150 (main) + 300 (sides) + 150 (desserts) = 600 items per day.\n\nOver 7 days, that's 600 \u00d7 7 = 4200 items.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of weekly meals. If they serve 150 meals per day, in a week that's 150 \u00d7 7 = 1050 meals.\n\nEach meal has 4 items, so total items in a week are 1050 meals \u00d7 4 items/meals = 4200 items.\n\nEither way, I arrive at the same number, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, are there any holidays or days when the restaurant is closed? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I'll assume it operates every day of the week.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"individual items,\" which seems to mean each dish is counted separately, regardless of what it is. So, one main dish is one item, one side dish is one item, and one dessert is one item.\n\nI think that's straightforward. No need to account for different types of dishes or anything like that.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the restaurant serves 4200 individual items in a week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4200} \\]"
