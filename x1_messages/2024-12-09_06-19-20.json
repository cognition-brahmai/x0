        "content": "Let's see. I have an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 7 and the third term is 15. I need to find the second term. Okay, in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. That means the difference between the first and second term is the same as the difference between the second and third term.\n\nSo, let me denote the terms like this:\n\n- First term: a1 = 7\n\n- Second term: a2 = ?\n\n- Third term: a3 = 15\n\nThe common difference, d, can be found by subtracting the first term from the second term, or the second term from the third term. Since I don't know the second term yet, maybe I can express everything in terms of d.\n\nSo, a2 = a1 + d = 7 + d\n\nAnd a3 = a2 + d = (7 + d) + d = 7 + 2d\n\nBut I know that a3 is 15, so:\n\n7 + 2d = 15\n\nNow, I can solve for d:\n\n2d = 15 - 7\n\n2d = 8\n\nd = 4\n\nNow that I have d, I can find the second term:\n\na2 = 7 + 4 = 11\n\nSo, the second term should be 11.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence. The general formula for the nth term is:\n\nan = a1 + (n - 1)d\n\nSo, for the third term (n=3):\n\na3 = a1 + 2d = 15\n\nWe already have a1 = 7, so:\n\n7 + 2d = 15\n\nSolving for d:\n\n2d = 8\n\nd = 4\n\nThen, a2 = a1 + d = 7 + 4 = 11\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier result.\n\nIs there any other approach I can take to confirm this? Maybe using the concept that in an arithmetic sequence, the average of equally spaced terms is the middle term. Since we have three terms, the second term should be the average of the first and third terms.\n\nSo, a2 = (a1 + a3)/2 = (7 + 15)/2 = 22/2 = 11\n\nAgain, I get 11. That's reassuring.\n\nLet me think if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Is it possible that the sequence is not strictly arithmetic, or that there's a different pattern at play? Well, the problem specifically says it's an arithmetic sequence, so I should stick to that.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, what if the sequence was not arithmetic, but maybe geometric or something else? But the problem states it's arithmetic, so I don't need to consider other types of sequences.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that there aren't any tricks with negative differences or anything like that. But since the third term is larger than the first, the common difference must be positive, which it is in this case (d=4).\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the second term is 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]"
