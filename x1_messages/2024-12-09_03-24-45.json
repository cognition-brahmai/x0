        "content": "Okay, so we've got this equation to solve: 3x + 7 = 22. I need to find out what x is. Let's approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to isolate x, right? That means getting x by itself on one side of the equation. The equation now has 3x plus 7 equals 22. So, I should start by getting rid of the +7 on the left side.\n\nTo do that, I can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation. That way, the +7 and -7 will cancel each other out on the left side. So, if I subtract 7 from both sides:\n\n3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3x = 15\n\nOkay, now I have 3x = 15. I need to get x by itself, so I need to divide both sides by 3.\n\nSo, dividing both sides by 3:\n\n3x / 3 = 15 / 3\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = 5\n\nAlright, so x equals 5. But let me just check if that's correct. I'll plug x = 5 back into the original equation to see if it holds true.\n\nOriginal equation: 3x + 7 = 22\n\nPlugging in x = 5: 3*(5) + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22\n\nYes, it checks out. So, x = 5 is the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
