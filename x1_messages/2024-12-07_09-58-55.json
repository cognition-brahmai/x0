        "content": "So Sarah saw Lisa put her lunchbox in locker number 5, right? But then during recess, Emma spilled juice on it and moved it to locker number 7 to dry. Now, Sarah wants to decorate Lisa's lunchbox with stickers after school. The question is, which locker will Sarah check first to find Lisa's lunchbox?\n\nHmm, let's think about this. Sarah initially saw Lisa place the lunchbox in locker number 5. So, that's her initial point of reference. But then, Emma moved it to locker number 7 because of the juice spill. Now, Sarah wants to surprise Lisa by decorating the lunchbox.\n\nThe key here is to consider what Sarah knows. Does Sarah know that Emma spilled juice on the lunchbox and moved it to locker number 7? If Sarah is aware of this incident, then she would probably check locker number 7 first. However, if Sarah doesn't know about the juice spill and the relocation to locker number 7, she would likely check locker number 5 first, since that's where she last saw Lisa put it.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify whether Sarah is aware of the juice spill and the subsequent move to locker number 7. It only says that Emma accidentally spilled juice on the lunchbox and moved it to locker number 7 to dry off, and then after school, Sarah wants to decorate the lunchbox.\n\nGiven that, we might assume that Sarah doesn't know about the juice spill and the move, unless there's information suggesting otherwise. So, if Sarah doesn't know about the move, she would probably check locker number 5 first, thinking that's where the lunchbox is.\n\nHowever, another angle to consider is whether Sarah might check both lockers. Maybe she remembers seeing Lisa put it in locker 5, but also considers that something might have happened during the day, so she checks locker 7 as well.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking which locker Sarah will check first. So, we need to determine her initial action.\n\nGiven that Sarah wants to surprise Lisa by decorating her lunchbox with stickers after school, and assuming she doesn't have information about the juice spill and the move to locker 7, she would probably go straight to locker number 5, where she last saw Lisa put the lunchbox.\n\nOn the other hand, if Sarah is aware of the juice spill and the move to locker 7, then she would check locker number 7 first.\n\nSince the problem doesn't provide information about whether Sarah knows about the juice spill and the move, we have to make an assumption based on the information given.\n\nLet's look back at the scenario:\n\n1. Sarah sees Lisa put her lunchbox in locker number 5.\n\n2. During recess, Emma spills juice on the lunchbox and moves it to locker number 7.\n\n3. After school, Sarah wants to decorate the lunchbox.\n\nThe crucial point is whether Sarah is aware of the events that occurred after she saw Lisa put the lunchbox in locker 5.\n\nIf Sarah is not aware of the juice spill and the move to locker 7, she would check locker 5 first.\n\nIf she is aware, she would check locker 7 first.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify Sarah's knowledge about the juice spill and the move, we should consider the most likely scenario based on the information provided.\n\nGiven that Emma accidentally spilled juice on the lunchbox and moved it to locker 7 to dry off, it's possible that Sarah wasn't present during this incident and therefore doesn't know about it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Sarah saw Emma move the lunchbox to locker 7, or maybe she heard about it from someone else. However, the problem doesn't mention any such awareness on Sarah's part.\n\nTherefore, without additional information, it's reasonable to assume that Sarah doesn't know about the move to locker 7.\n\nHence, Sarah would likely check locker number 5 first, as that's where she last saw Lisa put the lunchbox.\n\nBut wait a minute. Let's consider another perspective. Maybe Sarah remembers thatEmma spilled juice on Lisa's lunchbox and moved it to locker 7. If that's the case, then she would check locker 7 first.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't specify Sarah's knowledge, we need to base our answer on the information given.\n\nGiven that, I think the safest assumption is that Sarah doesn't know about the move and would therefore check locker number 5 first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that Sarah might ask someone or know about the move, but again, there's no information to support that.\n\nSo, sticking to the information provided, Sarah would check locker number 5 first.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
