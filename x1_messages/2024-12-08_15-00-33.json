        "content": "Rabbits are able to see a limited range of colors compared to humans. They have dichromatic vision, which means they have two types of cone cells in their eyes that are sensitive to different wavelengths of light. Specifically, rabbits can see blues and greens, but they have difficulty distinguishing reds and oranges. So, their color vision is similar to that of a colorblind human.\n\nIn more detail, rabbits' eyes contain cones that are most sensitive to short wavelengths (blue light) and middle wavelengths (green light). They lack the long-wavelength cones that humans have, which allow us to see reds and oranges. This means that rabbits likely perceive the world in shades of blue and green, with other colors appearing more muted or similar to each other.\n\nIt's also worth noting that rabbits have a wide field of vision, which is adapted for detecting predators in their natural environment. Their eyes are positioned on the sides of their head, giving them nearly 360-degree vision, although this comes at the cost of binocular vision and depth perception.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly: rabbits can see blues and greens, but have limited ability to distinguish reds and oranges."
