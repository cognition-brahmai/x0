        "content": "Let's see. The store sells apples for $1.50 per pound, and the customer buys 4 pounds. So, first, I need to calculate the total cost of the apples.\n\nI can do that by multiplying the price per pound by the number of pounds:\n\nTotal cost = $1.50/pound \u00d7 4 pounds\n\nNow, $1.50 times 4. Let's see, 1.5 times 4 is 6. So, the total cost is $6.00.\n\nThe customer pays with a $20 bill. To find out how much change they should receive, I need to subtract the total cost from the amount paid:\n\nChange = $20.00 - $6.00\n\nThat's straightforward. $20 minus $6 is $14.\n\nSo, the customer should receive $14 in change.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The price per pound is $1.50, and 4 pounds would indeed be $6.00. Subtracting that from $20 should give $14. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that sometimes there might be taxes or other additions, but the problem doesn't mention any additional costs, so I'll assume that the price is just $1.50 per pound with no extra charges.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the store has a policy of rounding or something, but again, the problem doesn't specify anything like that, so I'll stick with the straightforward calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the unit price and the quantity. $1.50 per pound for 4 pounds is indeed $6.00. Then, from $20, subtracting $6 gives $14.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about it in terms of how much money is being exchanged, the customer gives $20 and owes $6, so the change should be $14.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The answer should be $14.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
