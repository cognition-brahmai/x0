        "content": "The film you're referring to is \"Titanic,\" directed by James Cameron. It was released in 1997 and tells the story of the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic, which struck an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1912. The movie focuses on the love story between Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater against the backdrop of this historic disaster.\n\n\"Titanic\" was a monumental success at the box office, grossing over $2.18 billion worldwide, which made it the highest-grossing film of all time at that point. Its success was attributed to its epic scale, powerful performances, and the timeless romance between its leads, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.\n\nHowever, in 2009, another James Cameron film, \"Avatar,\" surpassed \"Titanic's\" box office earnings. \"Avatar\" introduced groundbreaking 3D technology and immersive world-building, capturing the imagination of audiences worldwide. As of now, \"Avatar\" holds the title for the highest-grossing film of all time, with \"Titanic\" following closely behind.\n\nBoth films are notable for their innovative approaches to filmmaking and their lasting impact on popular culture. They showcase James Cameron's ability to create visually stunning and emotionally resonant cinematic experiences that resonate with global audiences."
