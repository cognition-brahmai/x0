I've always been fascinated by how the city was built right onto the water. The Grand Canal must be something to see in person. I wonder what it's like to navigate through those narrow passages in a gondola. The gondoliers must have incredible skills to maneuver through there. And the Rialto Bridge, oh my, it's so iconic. I can imagine walking across it, taking in the views of the canal and the bustling markets below. Venice really is a one-of-a-kind place. I hope to visit someday and experience it all for myself."
