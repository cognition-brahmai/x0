        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a group of friends sharing the cost of a meal equally. But two friends don't pay their full share; they each pay $10 less than they should, and this causes everyone else's share to increase by $5. We need to find out how many friends there are in total.\n\nFirst, I need to set up some variables to represent the situation. Let's denote:\n\n- Let \\( n \\) be the total number of friends.\n\n- Let \\( c \\) be the total cost of the meal.\n\n- Therefore, each friend's equal share would be \\( \\frac{c}{n} \\).\n\nNow, according to the problem, two friends pay $10 less than their share. So, each of these two friends pays \\( \\frac{c}{n} - 10 \\).\n\nThe remaining \\( n - 2 \\) friends have to pay $5 more than their original share. So, each of them pays \\( \\frac{c}{n} + 5 \\).\n\nSince the total amount paid should still equal the total cost of the meal, we can set up an equation:\n\n\\[ 2 \\left( \\frac{c}{n} - 10 \\right) + (n - 2) \\left( \\frac{c}{n} + 5 \\right) = c \\]\n\nLet's expand and simplify this equation step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the left side:\n\n\\[ 2 \\left( \\frac{c}{n} - 10 \\right) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{c}{n} - 20 = \\frac{2c}{n} - 20 \\]\n\n\\[ (n - 2) \\left( \\frac{c}{n} + 5 \\right) = (n - 2) \\cdot \\frac{c}{n} + 5(n - 2) = \\frac{(n - 2)c}{n} + 5n - 10 \\]\n\nNow, combine these:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2c}{n} - 20 + \\frac{(n - 2)c}{n} + 5n - 10 = c \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2c}{n} + \\frac{(n - 2)c}{n} + 5n - 30 = c \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{2c + (n - 2)c}{n} + 5n - 30 = c \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{2c + nc - 2c}{n} + 5n - 30 = c \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{nc}{n} + 5n - 30 = c \\]\n\n\\[ c + 5n - 30 = c \\]\n\nWait a minute, if I subtract \\( c \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 5n - 30 = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 5n = 30 \\]\n\n\\[ n = 6 \\]\n\nSo, according to this, there are 6 friends in total.\n\nBut let me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf there are 6 friends, and the total cost is \\( c \\), then each should pay \\( \\frac{c}{6} \\).\n\nTwo friends pay \\( \\frac{c}{6} - 10 \\), and the other 4 pay \\( \\frac{c}{6} + 5 \\).\n\nLet's see if the total adds up to \\( c \\):\n\n\\[ 2 \\left( \\frac{c}{6} - 10 \\right) + 4 \\left( \\frac{c}{6} + 5 \\right) = \\frac{2c}{6} - 20 + \\frac{4c}{6} + 20 = \\frac{6c}{6} + 0 = c \\]\n\nYes, it checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nLet's think about the difference in payments.\n\nThe two friends who pay less, together pay \\( 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\) dollars less than they should.\n\nThis means that the remaining \\( n - 2 \\) friends have to make up for this $20 shortfall.\n\nSince each of them pays $5 more, the total extra amount they pay is \\( 5(n - 2) \\).\n\nThis extra amount should equal the shortfall:\n\n\\[ 5(n - 2) = 20 \\]\n\n\\[ n - 2 = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ n = 6 \\]\n\nAgain, we get \\( n = 6 \\).\n\nThis seems consistent with the first method.\n\nLet me try another approach to see if I get the same answer.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the original share per person as \\( s = \\frac{c}{n} \\).\n\nThen, the two friends pay \\( s - 10 \\), and the other \\( n - 2 \\) friends pay \\( s + 5 \\).\n\nThe total payment is:\n\n\\[ 2(s - 10) + (n - 2)(s + 5) = c \\]\n\nBut since \\( c = n.s \\), substitute:\n\n\\[ 2(s - 10) + (n - 2)(s + 5) = n.s \\]\n\nExpand:\n\n\\[ 2s - 20 + (n - 2)s + 5(n - 2) = n.s \\]\n\n\\[ 2s - 20 + n s - 2 s + 5 n - 10 = n s \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ (2s - 2 s) + n s + 5 n - 30 = n s \\]\n\n\\[ 0 + n s + 5 n - 30 = n s \\]\n\n\\[ n s + 5 n - 30 = n s \\]\n\nSubtract \\( n s \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 5 n - 30 = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 5 n = 30 \\]\n\n\\[ n = 6 \\]\n\nOnce again, \\( n = 6 \\).\n\nIt seems like no matter which way I approach this problem, I end up with \\( n = 6 \\).\n\nMaybe I should consider if there could be other interpretations of the problem.\n\nIs it possible that the $5 increase is per person for the remaining friends, or is it a total increase?\n\nWait, the problem says \"increases everyone else's share by $5.\" This likely means each of the remaining friends pays $5 more than they originally should have.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if it could mean a total increase of $5 for the remaining friends.\n\nIf that were the case, then the equation would be different.\n\nBut the problem specifically says \"increases everyone else's share by $5,\" which suggests that each of the remaining friends pays $5 more.\n\nTherefore, the first interpretation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if \"everyone else's share increases by $5,\" it could be interpreted as the total increase for the group is $5, but that seems less likely in context.\n\nStick with the initial interpretation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is in terms of the total amount paid.\n\nOriginal total: \\( c \\)\n\nTwo friends pay \\( s - 10 \\) each.\n\nRemaining \\( n - 2 \\) friends pay \\( s + 5 \\) each.\n\nTotal paid: \\( 2(s - 10) + (n - 2)(s + 5) \\)\n\nThis should equal \\( c \\), which is \\( n s \\).\n\nSo, \\( 2(s - 10) + (n - 2)(s + 5) = n s \\)\n\nWhich is the same equation as before, leading to \\( n = 6 \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express everything in terms of \\( n \\).\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\nLet \\( n \\) be the number of friends.\n\nEach should pay \\( \\frac{c}{n} \\).\n\nTwo pay \\( \\frac{c}{n} - 10 \\).\n\nRemaining \\( n - 2 \\) pay \\( \\frac{c}{n} + 5 \\).\n\nTotal:\n\n\\[ 2\\left( \\frac{c}{n} - 10 \\right) + (n - 2)\\left( \\frac{c}{n} + 5 \\right) = c \\]\n\nExpand:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2c}{n} - 20 + \\frac{(n - 2)c}{n} + 5(n - 2) = c \\]\n\nCombine terms:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2c}{n} + \\frac{(n - 2)c}{n} + 5(n - 2) - 20 = c \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{2c + (n - 2)c}{n} + 5n - 10 - 20 = c \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{2c + n c - 2c}{n} + 5n - 30 = c \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{n c}{n} + 5n - 30 = c \\]\n\n\\[ c + 5n - 30 = c \\]\n\n\\[ 5n - 30 = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 5n = 30 \\]\n\n\\[ n = 6 \\]\n\nAgain, \\( n = 6 \\).\n\nPerhaps I can try plugging in \\( n = 6 \\) back into the problem to verify.\n\nIf \\( n = 6 \\), each should pay \\( \\frac{c}{6} \\).\n\nTwo friends pay \\( \\frac{c}{6} - 10 \\).\n\nRemaining 4 pay \\( \\frac{c}{6} + 5 \\).\n\nTotal paid:\n\n\\[ 2\\left( \\frac{c}{6} - 10 \\right) + 4\\left( \\frac{c}{6} + 5 \\right) = \\frac{2c}{6} - 20 + \\frac{4c}{6} + 20 = \\frac{6c}{6} + 0 = c \\]\n\nIt checks out.\n\nIs there any other possible value for \\( n \\)?\n\nSuppose \\( n = 5 \\).\n\nThen, each should pay \\( \\frac{c}{5} \\).\n\nTwo pay \\( \\frac{c}{5} - 10 \\).\n\nRemaining 3 pay \\( \\frac{c}{5} + 5 \\).\n\nTotal:\n\n\\[ 2\\left( \\frac{c}{5} - 10 \\right) + 3\\left( \\frac{c}{5} + 5 \\right) = \\frac{2c}{5} - 20 + \\frac{3c}{5} + 15 = \\frac{5c}{5} - 5 = c - 5 \\]\n\nBut this should equal \\( c \\), so \\( c - 5 = c \\), which implies \\( -5 = 0 \\), which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, \\( n = 5 \\) is not a solution.\n\nWhat about \\( n = 7 \\)?\n\nEach should pay \\( \\frac{c}{7} \\).\n\nTwo pay \\( \\frac{c}{7} - 10 \\).\n\nRemaining 5 pay \\( \\frac{c}{7} + 5 \\).\n\nTotal:\n\n\\[ 2\\left( \\frac{c}{7} - 10 \\right) + 5\\left( \\frac{c}{7} + 5 \\right) = \\frac{2c}{7} - 20 + \\frac{5c}{7} + 25 = \\frac{7c}{7} + 5 = c + 5 \\]\n\nThis should equal \\( c \\), so \\( c + 5 = c \\), which implies \\( 5 = 0 \\), which is also not possible.\n\nHence, \\( n = 7 \\) is not a solution.\n\nTherefore, only \\( n = 6 \\) satisfies the equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"A group of friends decide to share equally the cost of a meal. However, two friends do not have enough money and pay $10 less than they should. This increases everyone else's share by $5. How many friends are there in total?\"\n\nI think I've interpreted it correctly, but maybe not.\n\nAlternative interpretation:\n\nMaybe the $5 increase is the total increase for the remaining friends, not per person.\n\nIf that's the case, then the remaining \\( n - 2 \\) friends together pay an extra $5 in total.\n\nSo, each of them pays an extra \\( \\frac{5}{n - 2} \\).\n\nBut this seems less likely, as \"increases everyone else's share by $5\" probably means each person's share increases by $5.\n\nBut for completeness, let's consider this scenario.\n\nSo, the two friends pay \\( s - 10 \\) each, and the remaining \\( n - 2 \\) friends pay \\( s + \\frac{5}{n - 2} \\) each.\n\nTotal paid:\n\n\\[ 2(s - 10) + (n - 2)\\left( s + \\frac{5}{n - 2} \\right) = c \\]\n\nBut \\( c = n s \\), so:\n\n\\[ 2(s - 10) + (n - 2)s + 5 = n s \\]\n\n\\[ 2s - 20 + n s - 2 s + 5 = n s \\]\n\n\\[ (2s - 2 s) + n s - 20 + 5 = n s \\]\n\n\\[ 0 + n s - 15 = n s \\]\n\n\\[ n s - 15 = n s \\]\n\n\\[ -15 = 0 \\]\n\nThis is not possible. So, this interpretation is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the initial interpretation is correct.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the problem involves different payment amounts.\n\nWait, another way: let's think in terms of total shortfall and extra burden.\n\nThe two friends who pay $10 less each create a total shortfall of \\( 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\) dollars.\n\nThis shortfall is covered by the remaining \\( n - 2 \\) friends, who each pay $5 more.\n\nSo, the total extra amount paid by the remaining friends is \\( 5(n - 2) \\).\n\nThis should equal the shortfall:\n\n\\[ 5(n - 2) = 20 \\]\n\n\\[ n - 2 = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ n = 6 \\]\n\nAgain, \\( n = 6 \\).\n\nThis reinforces the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to consider the cost per person.\n\nIf two friends pay $10 less, and the others pay $5 more, perhaps there's a relationship between these amounts.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the difference in what the two friends pay and what they should pay.\n\nEach of the two friends pays $10 less, so together they pay $20 less.\n\nThis $20 is distributed among the remaining \\( n - 2 \\) friends, each paying $5 more.\n\nSo, \\( 5(n - 2) = 20 \\), leading to \\( n - 2 = 4 \\), hence \\( n = 6 \\).\n\nThis is consistent with all previous methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using algebraic manipulation.\n\nLet\u2019s set up the equation again:\n\n\\[ 2\\left( \\frac{c}{n} - 10 \\right) + (n - 2)\\left( \\frac{c}{n} + 5 \\right) = c \\]\n\nLet\u2019s multiply both sides by \\( n \\) to eliminate denominators:\n\n\\[ 2(c - 10n) + (n - 2)(c + 5n) = c n \\]\n\nExpand:\n\n\\[ 2c - 20n + (n - 2)c + 5n(n - 2) = c n \\]\n\n\\[ 2c - 20n + c n - 2 c + 5 n^2 - 10 n = c n \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ (2c - 2c) + c n + 5 n^2 - 20 n - 10 n = c n \\]\n\n\\[ 0 + c n + 5 n^2 - 30 n = c n \\]\n\nSubtract \\( c n \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 5 n^2 - 30 n = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 5 n (n - 6) = 0 \\]\n\nSo, \\( n = 0 \\) or \\( n = 6 \\).\n\n\\( n = 0 \\) is not practical in this context, so \\( n = 6 \\).\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the change in payment.\n\nThe two friends pay $10 less each, so they save a total of $20.\n\nThis $20 is distributed among the remaining \\( n - 2 \\) friends, each paying $5 more.\n\nSo, \\( 5(n - 2) = 20 \\), leading to \\( n - 2 = 4 \\), hence \\( n = 6 \\).\n\nThis is consistent across multiple methods.\n\nPerhaps I can consider the total cost \\( c \\).\n\nWith \\( n = 6 \\), each should pay \\( \\frac{c}{6} \\).\n\nTwo pay \\( \\frac{c}{6} - 10 \\), and four pay \\( \\frac{c}{6} + 5 \\).\n\nSet up an equation to find \\( c \\):\n\nFrom one of the payments:\n\nLet\u2019s say \\( \\frac{c}{6} + 5 = \\) payment by remaining friends.\n\nBut since we already have \\( n = 6 \\), and it satisfies the equation, perhaps finding \\( c \\) is not necessary for determining \\( n \\).\n\nAlternatively, suppose \\( n = 4 \\).\n\nThen, each should pay \\( \\frac{c}{4} \\).\n\nTwo pay \\( \\frac{c}{4} - 10 \\), and two pay \\( \\frac{c}{4} + 5 \\).\n\nTotal:\n\n\\[ 2\\left( \\frac{c}{4} - 10 \\right) + 2\\left( \\frac{c}{4} + 5 \\right) = \\frac{2c}{4} - 20 + \\frac{2c}{4} + 10 = \\frac{4c}{4} - 10 = c - 10 \\]\n\nThis should equal \\( c \\), so \\( c - 10 = c \\), which implies \\( -10 = 0 \\), which is not possible.\n\nThus, \\( n = 4 \\) is invalid.\n\nWhat if \\( n = 8 \\)?\n\nEach should pay \\( \\frac{c}{8} \\).\n\nTwo pay \\( \\frac{c}{8} - 10 \\), and six pay \\( \\frac{c}{8} + 5 \\).\n\nTotal:\n\n\\[ 2\\left( \\frac{c}{8} - 10 \\right) + 6\\left( \\frac{c}{8} + 5 \\right) = \\frac{2c}{8} - 20 + \\frac{6c}{8} + 30 = \\frac{8c}{8} + 10 = c + 10 \\]\n\nThis should equal \\( c \\), so \\( c + 10 = c \\), which implies \\( 10 = 0 \\), not possible.\n\nHence, \\( n = 8 \\) is invalid.\n\nWhat about \\( n = 7 \\), as tried earlier? Also invalid.\n\nWhat about \\( n = 5 \\)? Also invalid.\n\nWhat about \\( n = 3 \\)?\n\nEach should pay \\( \\frac{c}{3} \\).\n\nTwo pay \\( \\frac{c}{3} - 10 \\), and one pays \\( \\frac{c}{3} + 5 \\).\n\nTotal:\n\n\\[ 2\\left( \\frac{c}{3} - 10 \\right) + 1\\left( \\frac{c}{3} + 5 \\right) = \\frac{2c}{3} - 20 + \\frac{c}{3} + 5 = c - 15 \\]\n\nThis should equal \\( c \\), so \\( c - 15 = c \\), which implies \\( -15 = 0 \\), not possible.\n\nThus, \\( n = 3 \\) is invalid.\n\nWhat about \\( n = 9 \\)?\n\nEach should pay \\( \\frac{c}{9} \\).\n\nTwo pay \\( \\frac{c}{9} - 10 \\), and seven pay \\( \\frac{c}{9} + 5 \\).\n\nTotal:\n\n\\[ 2\\left( \\frac{c}{9} - 10 \\right) + 7\\left( \\frac{c}{9} + 5 \\right) = \\frac{2c}{9} - 20 + \\frac{7c}{9} + 35 = \\frac{9c}{9} + 15 = c + 15 \\]\n\nThis should equal \\( c \\), so \\( c + 15 = c \\), which implies \\( 15 = 0 \\), not possible.\n\nHence, \\( n = 9 \\) is invalid.\n\nIt seems that only \\( n = 6 \\) satisfies the condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to generalize this.\n\nSuppose two friends pay \\( p \\) dollars less than their share, and this increases the remaining \\( n - 2 \\) friends' shares by \\( q \\) dollars.\n\nThen, the equation would be:\n\n\\[ 2\\left( \\frac{c}{n} - p \\right) + (n - 2)\\left( \\frac{c}{n} + q \\right) = c \\]\n\nExpand:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2c}{n} -
