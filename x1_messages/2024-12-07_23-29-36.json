In this groundbreaking book, Atticus Finch is a principled lawyer who defends Tom Robinson, an African-American man falsely accused of raping a white woman in the deeply segregated Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama. Through the eyes of Scout, Atticus's young daughter, the novel explores themes of racial injustice, moral growth, and the loss of innocence."
