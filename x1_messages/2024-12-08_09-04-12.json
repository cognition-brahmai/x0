        "content": "So I have this problem about fencing a rectangular garden. The garden is 15 meters long and 8 meters wide. But I need to build a fence around it with an additional 1-meter buffer on all sides. I need to find out how much fencing material I'll need for that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the buffer means. If there's a 1-meter buffer on all sides, that means the fence won't be right against the garden; instead, it will be 1 meter outside the garden on every side.\n\nSo, the fence will enclose an area that is larger than the garden itself. To find out the dimensions of the area to be fenced, I need to add the buffer to both the length and the width.\n\nBut wait, since the buffer is on all sides, I need to add 1 meter to both the left and right sides, and 1 meter to both the top and bottom sides.\n\nLet me visualize this. If the garden is 15 meters long and 8 meters wide, and I add 1 meter on each side, it's like adding 2 meters to both the length and the width because 1 meter is added to both sides of each dimension.\n\nSo, the total length of the area to be fenced would be:\n\n15 meters (original length) + 1 meter (one side) + 1 meter (other side) = 17 meters.\n\nSimilarly, the total width would be:\n\n8 meters (original width) + 1 meter (one side) + 1 meter (other side) = 10 meters.\n\nNow, to find out how much fencing material is needed, I need to calculate the perimeter of this larger rectangle.\n\nThe formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (length + width)\n\nPlugging in the values I have:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (17 meters + 10 meters) = 2 \u00d7 27 meters = 54 meters.\n\nSo, I would need 54 meters of fencing material.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIf the garden is 15m by 8m, and I add 1m buffer on all sides, the fenced area should be 17m by 10m, as I calculated.\n\nPerimeter is indeed 2 times the sum of length and width, so 2 \u00d7 (17 + 10) = 2 \u00d7 27 = 54 meters.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it step by step.\n\nStarting with the garden dimensions:\n\nLength = 15m\n\nWidth = 8m\n\nAdding 1m buffer on all sides means:\n\n- Left side: +1m\n\n- Right side: +1m\n\n- Top side: +1m\n\n- Bottom side: +1m\n\nSo, the total addition to the length is 1m + 1m = 2m\n\nSimilarly, the total addition to the width is 1m + 1m = 2m\n\nTherefore, the fenced area's length is 15m + 2m = 17m\n\nAnd the width is 8m + 2m = 10m\n\nPerimeter is then 2 \u00d7 (17m + 10m) = 2 \u00d7 27m = 54m\n\nSame answer.\n\nI could also think about it in terms of the original perimeter and the additional buffer.\n\nThe original perimeter of the garden is 2 \u00d7 (15m + 8m) = 2 \u00d7 23m = 46m\n\nBut with the 1m buffer on all sides, the fence is not just around the original garden; it's around a larger area.\n\nSo, it's not simply adding a fixed amount to the original perimeter.\n\nNo, it's better to calculate the new dimensions first and then find the perimeter, as I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, since the buffer is uniform around the garden, it's like expanding the garden by 1m on all sides.\n\nIn terms of perimeter, adding 1m to all sides means adding 1m to each side of the rectangle.\n\nFor a rectangle, there are two lengths and two widths.\n\nSo, for the lengths, each increases by 1m + 1m = 2m (one for each side)\n\nSimilarly, for the widths, each increases by 1m + 1m = 2m\n\nTherefore, the total perimeter increases by 2m (for both lengths) + 2m (for both widths) = 4m\n\nSo, original perimeter is 46m, plus 4m for the buffer, totaling 50m.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation of 54m.\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf I add 1m to all sides, for each side of the rectangle, the length increases by 1m.\n\nBut in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal.\n\nSo, for the two lengths, each increases by 1m, adding 2m to the total perimeter.\n\nSimilarly, for the two widths, each increases by 1m, adding another 2m to the total perimeter.\n\nSo, total addition to the perimeter is 4m.\n\nOriginal perimeter is 46m, plus 4m buffer, equals 50m.\n\nBut earlier, by calculating the new dimensions, I got 54m.\n\nThere's a 4m difference here.\n\nI need to figure out which approach is correct.\n\nLet me draw a diagram to visualize this.\n\nSuppose the original garden is 15m long and 8m wide.\n\nSo, length (l) = 15m, width (w) = 8m\n\nPerimeter = 2(l + w) = 2(15 + 8) = 2(23) = 46m\n\nNow, adding 1m buffer on all sides.\n\nSo, the fenced area will be:\n\nLength = original length + 2 meters (1m on each end) = 15m + 2m = 17m\n\nWidth = original width + 2 meters (1m on each side) = 8m + 2m = 10m\n\nPerimeter of fenced area = 2(17 + 10) = 2(27) = 54m\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the buffer adding to the perimeter, it's not just adding 1m to each side; it's adding 1m to each end of the length and each side of the width.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing something.\n\nLet me consider the fence as being 1m outside the garden on all sides.\n\nSo, the distance from the garden's edge to the fence is 1m all around.\n\nTherefore, the fenced area is a larger rectangle that surrounds the garden with a 1m space between them.\n\nSo, to find the dimensions of the fenced area, I need to add 1m to each side of the garden.\n\nBut since there are two sides for length and two sides for width, the total addition to the length is 1m + 1m = 2m, and similarly for the width.\n\nHence, fenced length = 15m + 2m = 17m\n\nFenced width = 8m + 2m = 10m\n\nPerimeter = 2(17m + 10m) = 2(27m) = 54m\n\nNow, why did I get 50m earlier when I thought about adding 4m to the original perimeter?\n\nBecause adding 1m to each side would mean:\n\n- Each length increases by 1m on one side and 1m on the other side, so total addition to length is 2m\n\n- Similarly, each width increases by 1m on one side and 1m on the other side, so total addition to width is 2m\n\nTherefore, the perimeter increases by 2m + 2m = 4m\n\nOriginal perimeter is 46m, plus 4m buffer, equals 50m\n\nBut this contradicts the first calculation of 54m.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose I have a garden that is 15m by 8m.\n\nPerimeter is 46m.\n\nNow, if I add 1m buffer on all sides, it's like creating a new rectangle that is uniformly 1m outside the original rectangle.\n\nSo, the new length should be original length plus 2 meters (1m on each end).\n\nSimilarly, the new width should be original width plus 2 meters (1m on each side).\n\nSo, new length = 15m + 2m = 17m\n\nNew width = 8m + 2m = 10m\n\nPerimeter = 2(17m + 10m) = 2(27m) = 54m\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the buffer adding to the perimeter, I might be misunderstanding how the perimeter increases.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeter doesn't increase by just 4m.\n\nLet me calculate the difference between the new perimeter and the original perimeter.\n\nNew perimeter is 54m, original is 46m, so the difference is 8m.\n\nWait, that doesn't match my earlier thought that it should be +4m.\n\nI'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me consider a smaller example to see what's going on.\n\nSuppose I have a square with side length 2m.\n\nPerimeter is 8m.\n\nNow, adding 1m buffer on all sides.\n\nNew side length is 2m + 2m = 4m (1m on each side)\n\nNew perimeter is 16m.\n\nDifference is 8m, which is twice the perimeter of the original square.\n\nWait, that's interesting.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem:\n\nOriginal perimeter is 46m.\n\nIf I add 1m buffer on all sides, the new perimeter is 54m, which is 46m + 8m.\n\nSo, the addition is 8m, not 4m.\n\nBut why?\n\nWait, perhaps when you add 1m to all sides, you're adding 1m to each side of the rectangle.\n\nA rectangle has four sides:\n\n- Two lengths of 15m each\n\n- Two widths of 8m each\n\nIf I add 1m to each side, then:\n\n- Each length increases by 1m, so total addition for lengths is 2m (1m per length side)\n\n- Each width increases by 1m, so total addition for widths is 2m (1m per width side)\n\nTherefore, total addition to the perimeter is 2m + 2m = 4m\n\nBut earlier calculation shows a difference of 8m.\n\nThere's clearly a mistake in this reasoning.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nActually, when you add 1m to all sides, you're not just adding 1m to the length and 1m to the width once each.\n\nNo, because each side of the rectangle is increased by 1m outward.\n\nSo, for the lengths:\n\n- Each length side is extended by 1m at each end.\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, for a rectangle, the length sides are parallel, and the width sides are parallel.\n\nIf I add 1m buffer on all sides, it's like expanding the rectangle uniformly by 1m in all directions.\n\nSo, the new length is original length plus 2 meters (1m on each end).\n\nSimilarly, the new width is original width plus 2 meters (1m on each side).\n\nTherefore, the new perimeter is based on the new dimensions:\n\nPerimeter = 2*(new length + new width) = 2*(17m + 10m) = 2*27m = 54m\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of the original perimeter plus the addition due to the buffer.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that adding 1m to all sides would add 4m to the perimeter, but that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that adding a buffer around the garden affects the perimeter differently.\n\nLet me consider that the fence is built 1m outside the garden on all sides.\n\nSo, the distance from the garden's edge to the fence is 1m all around.\n\nTherefore, the fenced area is a larger rectangle that encompasses the garden with a 1m border.\n\nTo find the perimeter of the fenced area, I need to calculate the perimeter of this larger rectangle.\n\nAs I did earlier:\n\nNew length = original length + 2 meters (1m on each end)\n\nNew width = original width + 2 meters (1m on each side)\n\nPerimeter = 2*(17m + 10m) = 54m\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the buffer adding to the perimeter, it's not just adding 1m to each side; it's expanding the entire perimeter by accounting for the additional length on all sides.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises from misapplying the perimeter formula.\n\nLet me try calculating the difference between the new perimeter and the original perimeter.\n\nNew perimeter: 54m\n\nOriginal perimeter: 2*(15m + 8m) = 46m\n\nDifference: 54m - 46m = 8m\n\nSo, adding a 1m buffer on all sides increases the perimeter by 8m, not 4m.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about it in terms of the buffer affecting both the length and the width.\n\nEach side of the rectangle is increased by 1m outward, but since the sides are connected at the corners, there is an additional component due to the corners.\n\nWait, perhaps that's where the extra addition comes from.\n\nIn other words, at each corner, the fence has to go around, and the buffer adds extra length beyond just the linear addition to the sides.\n\nBut that might be overcomplicating it.\n\nActually, in terms of simple geometry, when you expand a rectangle uniformly by a certain distance, the perimeter increases by twice the sum of the number of sides times the expansion distance.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps thinking in terms of scaling.\n\nBut in this case, it's not scaling; it's translating the boundary outward by a fixed distance.\n\nIn such a case, the perimeter increases based on the shape and the expansion distance.\n\nFor a rectangle, expanding outward by 1m adds 2m to both the length and the width, resulting in an increase in perimeter of 4m, but as per my earlier calculation, it's 8m.\n\nThere's clearly a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nImagine the garden as a rectangle with length 15m and width 8m.\n\nNow, to build a fence with a 1m buffer on all sides, I can think of the fence as surrounding the garden with a 1m space around it.\n\nSo, the fence will be positioned 1m outside the garden on all sides.\n\nTherefore, the distance from the outer edge of the fence to the corresponding edge of the garden is 1m.\n\nThus, the total addition to the length is 1m on one end and 1m on the other end, totaling 2m.\n\nSimilarly, the total addition to the width is 1m on one side and 1m on the other side, totaling 2m.\n\nTherefore, the fenced area's dimensions are:\n\nLength: 15m + 2m = 17m\n\nWidth: 8m + 2m = 10m\n\nPerimeter: 2*(17m + 10m) = 2*27m = 54m\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the buffer as adding a strip of 1m around the garden, the perimeter of this strip needs to be added to the original perimeter.\n\nBut how much does this strip add to the perimeter?\n\nWell, the strip adds 1m to each side, but since the sides are connected at the corners, there is an additional component due to the corners.\n\nWait, perhaps the extra addition is due to the corners.\n\nEach corner is a right angle, and adding a 1m buffer around the corner requires fencing that goes around the corner, effectively adding more length than just the linear addition.\n\nIn other words, at each corner, the fence has to make a turn, and the buffering creates an additional quarter-circle of radius 1m at each corner.\n\nWait, that might be a more accurate way to think about it.\n\nIf I(buffer) around the rectangle, the fence will not just be a rectangle expanded by 1m; it will have rounded corners because the buffer is a constant distance from the garden's edge.\n\nBut in practical terms, fencing is often done with straight sections, but theoretically, buffering a rectangle by 1m results in a larger rectangle with rounded corners of radius 1m.\n\nHowever, for the purpose of this problem, perhaps it's acceptable to assume that the fence is built as a rectangle expanded by 1m on all sides, without considering the rounded corners.\n\nIn that case, the perimeter calculation of 54m seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to account for the rounded corners, the perimeter would be slightly different.\n\nLet's explore that.\n\nIf I buffer the garden by 1m, the fenced area would have straight sides expanded by 1m on each side and quarter-circles of radius 1m at each corner.\n\nSo, the total perimeter would be:\n\n- The perimeter of the expanded rectangle minus the straight sections replaced by the quarter-circles, plus the circumference of the four quarter-circles.\n\nWait, that might be too complicated for this context.\n\nGiven that the problem likely expects a straightforward calculation, assuming the fence is a rectangle expanded by 1m on all sides, leading to a perimeter of 54m, seems appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the amount of fencing material needed is 54 meters.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the alternative approach of calculating the area to be fenced.\n\nThe area to be fenced is the area of the garden plus the buffer around it.\n\nThe buffer forms a strip of 1m width around the garden.\n\nSo, the area of the buffer is the area of the larger rectangle minus the area of the garden.\n\nLarger rectangle's area: 17m * 10m = 170m\u00b2\n\nGarden's area: 15m * 8m = 120m\u00b2\n\nBuffer area: 170m\u00b2 - 120m\u00b2 = 50m\u00b2\n\nBut the question is about the fencing material needed, which is the perimeter of the larger rectangle, not the area.\n\nSo, the area calculation doesn't directly help here, but it's good for cross-verification.\n\nGiven that, and considering the perimeter calculation is consistent, I can confidently say that 54 meters of fencing material is needed.\n\nAlternatively, if someone argues that the buffer should be accounted for differently, perhaps by considering the fence being placed at a distance of 1m from the garden's edge along the centerline, but that seems unnecessary for this problem.\n\nI think the approach of adding 1m to all sides, resulting in a larger rectangle of 17m by 10m, and then calculating the perimeter as 54m, is the correct way to go.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 54 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{54} \\]"
