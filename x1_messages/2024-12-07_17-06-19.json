So, matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra, and it's important to ensure that the dimensions of the matrices are compatible for multiplication. Specifically, the number of columns in the first matrix must match the number of rows in the second matrix.\n\nTo achieve this in Python, we can use nested lists to represent matrices and write a function to perform the multiplication. We'll also need to check the dimensions before attempting the multiplication to avoid errors.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Input Matrices:** We need to accept two matrices from the user. For simplicity, let's assume the user will input the matrices as lists of lists.\n\n2. **Check Dimensions:** Before multiplying, check if the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix.\n\n3. **Matrix Multiplication:** If dimensions are compatible, perform the multiplication. This involves taking the dot product of rows from the first matrix with columns from the second matrix.\n\n4. **Error Handling:** If dimensions are not compatible, print an error message.\n\nLet's write the code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform matrix multiplication in Python, ensuring that the dimensions of the input matrices are compatible. If they are not compatible, we should print an error message.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Input Matrices:** Accept two matrices from the user as lists of lists.\n2. **Check Dimensions:** Verify if the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.\n3. **Matrix Multiplication:** If dimensions are compatible, perform the multiplication using nested list comprehensions.\n4. **Error Handling:** If dimensions are not compatible, print an error message.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef matrix_multiply(A, B):\n    # Get dimensions of matrices\n    rows_A = len(A)\n    cols_A = len(A[0])\n    rows_B = len(B)\n    cols_B = len(B[0])\n    \n    # Check if multiplication is possible\n    if cols_A != rows_B:\n        print(\"Error: The number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.\")\n        return None\n    \n    # Initialize result matrix with zeros\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(cols_B)] for _ in range(rows_A)]\n    \n    # Perform matrix multiplication\n    for i in range(rows_A):\n        for j in range(cols_B):\n            for k in range(cols_A):\n                result[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage\n# Matrix A\nA = [\n    [1, 2, 3],\n    [4, 5, 6]\n]\n\n# Matrix B\nB = [\n    [7, 8],\n    [9, 10],\n    [11, 12]\n]\n\n# Multiply matrices\nresult = matrix_multiply(A, B)\n\n# Print result\nif result:\n    for row in result:\n        print(row)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Input Matrices:** Matrices `A` and `B` are defined as lists of lists.\n2. **Check Dimensions:** The number of columns in `A` is checked against the number of rows in `B`. If they do not match, an error message is printed.\n3. **Matrix Multiplication:** A new matrix `result` is initialized with zeros. The multiplication is performed using nested loops to calculate the dot product of rows from `A` and columns from `B`.\n4. **Error Handling:** If the dimensions are not compatible, `None` is returned and an error message is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that matrix multiplication is performed correctly and efficiently, with proper dimension checks in place."
