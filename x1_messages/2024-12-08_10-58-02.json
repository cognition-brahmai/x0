        "content": "Let's see. There are 12 apples on the table. I take away 4 apples, so now there are 12 - 4 = 8 apples left. Then I put back 2 apples, so now there are 8 + 2 = 10 apples on the table.\n\nThe question is, how many apples do I need to add to make it twice as many apples as before I took any away. Before I took any away, there were 12 apples, so twice that amount would be 2 * 12 = 24 apples.\n\nNow, there are 10 apples on the table, and I need to have 24 apples. So, the number of apples I need to add is 24 - 10 = 14 apples.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nStarting with 12 apples, take away 4, which leaves 8, then put back 2, which makes 10. To get to twice the original amount, which is 24, I need to add 14 apples. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this. Let's try another method.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of apples I need to add as x.\n\nThe original number of apples is 12.\n\nAfter taking away 4 and putting back 2, there are 10 apples.\n\nSo, 10 + x = 2 * 12\n\nThat is, 10 + x = 24\n\nTherefore, x = 24 - 10 = 14\n\nYes, that confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the net change in the number of apples.\n\nI took away 4 and then put back 2, so the net change is -2 apples (because 4 - 2 = 2).\n\nSo from 12 apples, after net change of -2, there are 10 apples.\n\nTo make it twice the original, which is 24, I need to go from 10 to 24, which is an increase of 14 apples.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think 14 is the correct number of apples to add.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem.\n\nThe problem says: \"How many apples do you need to add to make it twice as many apples as before you took any away?\"\n\nSo, the key phrase is \"before you took any away,\" which was when there were 12 apples.\n\nTwice that is 24.\n\nCurrently, after taking away 4 and putting back 2, there are 10 apples.\n\nSo, to reach 24, I need to add 14 apples.\n\nI can't see any other way to interpret this.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 14 apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
