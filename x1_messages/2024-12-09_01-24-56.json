        "content": "So I've got this partial differential equation to solve: \u2202u/\u2202t = k(\u2202\u00b2u/\u2202x\u00b2). This is known as the heat equation, right? It describes how heat (or temperature) distributes over time in a solid medium like a rod. Here, u(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and k is a constant that represents the thermal diffusivity of the material.\n\nOkay, to find the general solution to this equation, I need to recall some methods for solving PDEs, specifically second-order linear PDEs like this one. One common approach is the method of separation of variables. Let's try that.\n\nAssume that the solution u(x,t) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other only on t. So, let's set:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nNow, plug this into the PDE:\n\n\u2202u/\u2202t = k(\u2202\u00b2u/\u2202x\u00b2) \u2192 X(x) dT/dt = k T(t) d\u00b2X/dx\u00b2\n\nNext, I'll divide both sides by k X(x) T(t) to separate the variables:\n\n(1/kT(t)) dT/dt = (1/X(x)) d\u00b2X/dx\u00b2\n\nNow, since the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -\u03bb (lambda).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n(1/kT(t)) dT/dt = -\u03bb and (1/X(x)) d\u00b2X/dx\u00b2 = -\u03bb\n\nThis gives us two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. dT/dt = -k\u03bb T(t)\n\n2. d\u00b2X/dx\u00b2 = -\u03bb X(x)\n\nNow, I need to solve these ODEs.\n\nFirst, the spatial equation:\n\nd\u00b2X/dx\u00b2 = -\u03bb X(x)\n\nThe general solution to this equation depends on the value of \u03bb.\n\nCase 1: \u03bb > 0\n\nIn this case, the general solution is:\n\nX(x) = A cos(\u221a\u03bb x) + B sin(\u221a\u03bb x)\n\nCase 2: \u03bb = 0\n\nThe equation becomes d\u00b2X/dx\u00b2 = 0, which has the general solution:\n\nX(x) = A x + B\n\nCase 3: \u03bb < 0\n\nLet\u2019s set \u03bb = -\u03bc\u00b2, where \u03bc > 0. Then the equation becomes:\n\nd\u00b2X/dx\u00b2 = \u03bc\u00b2 X(x)\n\nThe general solution is:\n\nX(x) = A e^(\u03bc x) + B e^(-\u03bc x)\n\nNow, for the temporal equation:\n\ndT/dt = -k\u03bb T(t)\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and its general solution is:\n\nT(t) = C e^(-k\u03bb t)\n\nNow, combining the spatial and temporal solutions, we have:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x) T(t) = [A cos(\u221a\u03bb x) + B sin(\u221a\u03bb x)] e^(-k\u03bb t)  for \u03bb > 0\n\nu(x,t) = (A x + B) e^(0) = A x + B  for \u03bb = 0\n\nu(x,t) = [A e^(\u03bc x) + B e^(-\u03bc x)] e^(k\u03bc\u00b2 t)  for \u03bb < 0\n\nHowever, the latter case (\u03bb < 0) often leads to unphysical solutions for the heat equation, as temperatures would grow exponentially over time, which is not typical for heat diffusion. So, in practice, we usually consider \u03bb \u2265 0.\n\nNow, to find the general solution, we need to consider that the heat equation is linear and homogeneous, so solutions can be superposed. Therefore, the general solution is a sum (or integral) of solutions for different values of \u03bb.\n\nIn many cases, especially when dealing with finite domains and specific boundary conditions, the method of separation of variables leads to a Fourier series solution. For example, if the rod has fixed ends at x=0 and x=L, we might have boundary conditions like u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0 for all t.\n\nIn such a case, we would impose the boundary conditions to determine the allowed values of \u03bb and the coefficients A and B.\n\nBut since the problem asks for the general solution without specified boundary conditions, I'll consider the most general form.\n\nFor \u03bb > 0, we have:\n\nu(x,t) = [A cos(\u221a\u03bb x) + B sin(\u221a\u03bb x)] e^(-k\u03bb t)\n\nFor \u03bb = 0:\n\nu(x,t) = A x + B\n\nTo combine these, we can consider \u03bb as a continuous parameter and integrate over all possible \u03bb \u2265 0. This leads to integral solutions involving eigenfunctions.\n\nHowever, another common approach to solve the heat equation is using the method of fundamental solutions or the Green's function approach, which for the heat equation leads to the heat kernel.\n\nThe heat kernel in one dimension is:\n\nG(x,t; \u03be,\u03c4) = (1/(4\u03c0 k (t-\u03c4)))^(1/2) exp[ - (x-\u03be)^2 / (4 k (t-\u03c4)) ]\n\nThis represents the temperature at point x and time t due to a point heat source at position \u03be and time \u03c4.\n\nThe general solution can then be expressed as a convolution of the heat kernel with the initial temperature distribution.\n\nIf we have an initial condition u(x,0) = f(x), then the solution is:\n\nu(x,t) = \u222b G(x,t; \u03be,0) f(\u03be) d\u03be\n\nWhich is:\n\nu(x,t) = (1/(4\u03c0 k t)^(1/2)) \u222b exp[ - (x-\u03be)^2 / (4 k t) ] f(\u03be) d\u03be\n\nThis is the general solution for the heat equation on an infinite domain with given initial conditions.\n\nIf the domain is finite, say 0 \u2264 x \u2264 L, with appropriate boundary conditions, the solution would be expressed as a sum (series) rather than an integral.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify boundary conditions or the domain, I'll present the general solution in terms of the heat kernel for the infinite domain case.\n\nSo, the general solution to the heat equation \u2202u/\u2202t = k \u2202\u00b2u/\u2202x\u00b2 is:\n\nu(x,t) = (1/(4\u03c0 k t)^(1/2)) \u222b exp[ - (x-\u03be)^2 / (4 k t) ] f(\u03be) d\u03be\n\nWhere f(x) is the initial temperature distribution.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the solution as a sum of separated solutions, for \u03bb > 0, we have:\n\nu(x,t) = \u222b [A(\u03bb) cos(\u221a\u03bb x) + B(\u03bb)] e^(-k\u03bb t) d\u03bb + C x + D\n\nBut this form is less common, and the integral solution using the heat kernel is more widely used.\n\nI think this covers the general solution to the given PDE.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi kt}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\xi)^2}{4kt}} f(\\xi) \\, d\\xi} \\]"
