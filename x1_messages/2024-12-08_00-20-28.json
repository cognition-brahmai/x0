        "content": "So there's this problem here about a class with 40 students, and 60% of them are girls. Then, 4 more boys join the class, and we need to find out what the new percentage of girls will be. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many girls and how many boys are in the class initially. The class has 40 students, and 60% of them are girls. So, to find the number of girls, I can calculate 60% of 40.\n\nLet me do that: 60% of 40 is 0.6 times 40, which is 24. So, there are 24 girls in the class.\n\nNow, since the total number of students is 40, and there are 24 girls, the number of boys must be 40 minus 24, which is 16. So, there are 16 boys initially.\n\nThe problem says that 4 more boys are joining the class. So, the new number of boys will be 16 plus 4, which is 20.\n\nThe total number of students after these 4 boys join will be 40 plus 4, which is 44.\n\nNow, the number of girls remains the same, which is 24, because only boys are joining.\n\nWe need to find the new percentage of girls in the class. To find the percentage, I can use the formula:\n\nPercentage of girls = (Number of girls / Total number of students) * 100\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nPercentage of girls = (24 / 44) * 100\n\nLet me calculate that. First, 24 divided by 44 is 0.545454..., and multiplying that by 100 gives approximately 54.55%.\n\nSo, the new percentage of girls in the class is about 54.55%.\n\nBut maybe I should check if this is accurate. Let me see:\n\nInitially, 60% of 40 is 24 girls, and 16 boys.\n\nAfter 4 boys join, boys become 20, and total students are 44.\n\nSo, girls are still 24.\n\nTherefore, the percentage is indeed 24/44 * 100.\n\nLet me verify the division: 24 divided by 44.\n\nWell, 44 goes into 24 zero times, so 0.\n\nThen, 44 goes into 240 five times (44*5=220), subtract that from 240, gets 20.\n\nBring down a zero: 200.\n\n44 goes into 200 four times (44*4=176), subtract that, gets 24.\n\nBring down a zero: 240 again.\n\nThis is repeating, so it's 0.545454..., which is approximately 54.55%.\n\nSo, yep, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could simplify the fraction 24/44 before multiplying by 100.\n\n24 and 44 can both be divided by 4, so 24 divided by 4 is 6, and 44 divided by 4 is 11.\n\nSo, it's 6/11.\n\nNow, 6 divided by 11 is approximately 0.545454..., and multiplying by 100 gives 54.5454..., which is about 54.55%.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nMaybe I can try another way to confirm.\n\nSuppose I think about the proportion of girls before and after.\n\nInitially, 24 out of 40 are girls, which is 24/40 = 0.6, or 60%, which matches the given information.\n\nAfter adding 4 boys, total students are 44, and girls are still 24.\n\nSo, 24 out of 44 are girls.\n\nTo find this percentage, it's again (24/44)*100, which is the same calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of ratios.\n\nInitially, the ratio of girls to total students is 24:40, which simplifies to 3:5.\n\nAfter adding 4 boys, the ratio of girls to total students is 24:44, which simplifies to 6:11.\n\nTo find the percentage, it's still (24/44)*100.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough.\n\nSo, the new percentage of girls in the class is approximately 54.55%.\n\nMaybe the problem expects me to round it to two decimal places or to the nearest whole number.\n\nIf I round 54.55% to the nearest whole number, it's 55%.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify, I'll keep it as 54.55%.\n\nAlternatively, I could express it as a fraction.\n\n24/44 is 6/11, and 6/11 as a decimal is approximately 0.545454..., which is 54.5454...%, which rounds to 54.55%.\n\nSo, I think 54.55% is the accurate answer.\n\nThere you go!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{54.55\\%} \\]"
