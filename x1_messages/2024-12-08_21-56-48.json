        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a car traveling from City A to City B at 60 miles per hour, and then it comes back to City A at 40 miles per hour. The total time for the whole trip is 10 hours, and we need to find the distance between City A and City B.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. We need to find the distance between two cities, given the speeds in both directions and the total time for the round trip.\n\nLet's denote the distance between City A and City B as \\(d\\) miles. Since the car goes from A to B and then back to A, the total distance for the round trip is \\(2d\\) miles.\n\nHowever, the car travels at different speeds in each direction. From A to B, it's 60 mph, and from B to A, it's 40 mph. We know that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, the time taken to go from A to B is \\( \\frac{d}{60} \\) hours, and the time taken to return from B to A is \\( \\frac{d}{40} \\) hours.\n\nThe total time for the round trip is the sum of these two times, which is given as 10 hours. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{d}{40} = 10\n\\]\n\nNow, to solve for \\(d\\), we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 60 and 40, and their least common multiple is 120. So, we can rewrite the equation with a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2d}{120} + \\frac{3d}{120} = 10\n\\]\n\nCombining the fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5d}{120} = 10\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{24} = 10\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\(d\\):\n\n\\[\nd = 10 \\times 24 = 240\n\\]\n\nSo, the distance between City A and City B is 240 miles.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that. If the distance is 240 miles, then the time to go from A to B at 60 mph is \\( \\frac{240}{60} = 4 \\) hours, and the time to return from B to A at 40 mph is \\( \\frac{240}{40} = 6 \\) hours. The total time is \\( 4 + 6 = 10 \\) hours, which matches the given total time.\n\nLooks good! So, the answer is 240 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
