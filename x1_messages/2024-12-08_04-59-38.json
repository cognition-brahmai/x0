        "content": "Greek mythology has had a profound influence on contemporary literature. Many modern authors incorporate elements from ancient myths into their works, either directly or indirectly. This can range from using characters or plotlines from Greek myths, to exploring themes such as fate, hubris, or the human condition that were central to these stories. Furthermore, some authors may employ mythological allusions to add depth and complexity to their narratives. Which of the following books does not draw heavily on Greek mythology for its narrative structure or thematic content?\nA) \"The Song of Achilles\" by Madeline Miller\nB) \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee\nC) \"Percy Jackson & The Olympians\" series by Rick Riordan\nD) \"House of Names\" by Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn\nE) None of the above"

        "content": "Let's see. I need to figure out which book among the options doesn't draw heavily on Greek mythology for its narrative structure or thematic content. So, I'll go through each one and think about their connections to Greek myths.\n\nFirst up, \"The Song of Achilles\" by Madeline Miller. I know that this novel is a retelling of the Trojan War story, focusing on the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus. Both of these characters are central figures in Greek mythology, particularly in Homer's \"Iliad.\" So, it's clear that this book is deeply rooted in Greek mythology.\n\nNext, \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee. Now, I remember that this is a classic American novel set in the South during the Depression era. It deals with issues of racism and injustice through the eyes of a young girl, Scout Finch. I don't recall any direct references to Greek mythology in this book. Maybe there are some thematic similarities, like struggles against injustice, but that's pretty general. So, perhaps this is the book that doesn't draw heavily on Greek mythology.\n\nThen there's \"Percy Jackson & The Olympians\" series by Rick Riordan. This is a young adult fantasy series that directly incorporates Greek mythology. The story follows Percy Jackson, a teenager who discovers he's a demigod, the son of Poseidon. The entire series is filled with Greek gods, monsters, and mythological elements. So, it's obviously heavily influenced by Greek mythology.\n\n\"House of Names\" by Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn is another book on the list. I think this novel is a modern retelling of the House of Atreus myth, which includes the stories of Agamemnon, Clytemnestra, and Orestes. These are all characters from Greek tragedy, particularly in works by Aeschylus and Euripides. So, again, this book is clearly drawing heavily from Greek mythology.\n\nFinally, there's the option \"None of the above,\" which would mean that all of the listed books draw heavily on Greek mythology. But from what I've thought about so far, \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" seems to be the outlier in terms of Greek myth influence.\n\nLet me double-check. \"The Song of Achilles\" is a direct retelling of a Greek myth. \"Percy Jackson\" is all about Greek gods and mythology. \"House of Names\" is another retelling of Greek tragic stories. \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" while it might have thematic parallels to some Greek myths, doesn't seem to incorporate Greek mythology directly into its narrative structure or thematic content.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B) \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
