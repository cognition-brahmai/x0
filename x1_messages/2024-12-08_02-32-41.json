        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here: \"A bottle and a cork together cost $1.10. The bottle costs $1 more than the cork. How much does the cork cost?\" Okay, this seems like a straightforward algebra problem. I need to find the cost of the cork.\n\nFirst, I should define variables for the costs. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( c \\) be the cost of the cork in dollars.\n\n- Then, the bottle costs \\( c + 1 \\) dollars, since it's $1 more than the cork.\n\nNow, according to the problem, together they cost $1.10. So, the equation should be:\n\n\\[ c + (c + 1) = 1.10 \\]\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\[ 2c + 1 = 1.10 \\]\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 2c = 0.10 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ c = 0.05 \\]\n\nSo, the cork costs $0.05, and the bottle costs $1.05 (\\( 0.05 + 1 \\)). Let me check if that adds up to $1.10:\n\n\\[ 0.05 + 1.05 = 1.10 \\]\n\nYes, it does. Seems straightforward. But wait, I've heard some people get confused with this type of problem. Maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose the cork costs \\( c \\) dollars, and the bottle costs \\( b \\) dollars. We have two equations:\n\n1. \\( b + c = 1.10 \\)\n\n2. \\( b = c + 1 \\)\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first:\n\n\\[ (c + 1) + c = 1.10 \\]\n\n\\[ 2c + 1 = 1.10 \\]\n\n\\[ 2c = 0.10 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 0.05 \\]\n\nAgain, the same answer. Maybe I'm overthinking it. But just to be thorough, let's consider the units. Everything is in dollars, and the operations make sense. $0.05 for the cork and $1.05 for the bottle seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it using algebraic manipulation. Let\u2019s consider the difference in cost between the bottle and the cork, which is $1. So, \\( b - c = 1 \\). We already have \\( b + c = 1.10 \\). Now, I can solve these two equations simultaneously.\n\nAdding the two equations:\n\n\\[ (b + c) + (b - c) = 1.10 + 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 2b = 2.10 \\]\n\n\\[ b = 1.05 \\]\n\nThen, substituting back into \\( b + c = 1.10 \\):\n\n\\[ 1.05 + c = 1.10 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 0.05 \\]\n\nAgain, the same result. It seems consistent across different methods. Perhaps the potential confusion comes from misinterpreting the language of the problem.\n\nSome people might think that if the bottle costs $1 more than the cork, they might just subtract $1 from the total cost, but that wouldn't be correct because the bottle is $1 more than the cork, not $1 more than the total.\n\nAlternatively, someone might think that the cork costs $0.10, making the bottle $1.10, but then the total would be $1.20, which doesn't match the given total of $1.10.\n\nWait a minute, maybe that's where the confusion lies. People might assume that the bottle costs $1 more than the cork, so they might think:\n\n- Cork: $0.10\n\n- Bottle: $1.10\n\n- Total: $1.20\n\nBut that exceeds the given total of $1.10. So, they need to adjust their numbers accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, someone might think that the bottle costs $1, and the cork costs $0.10, but that would make the bottle only $0.90 more expensive than the cork, not $1 more.\n\nSo, to satisfy both conditions:\n\n- The sum is $1.10\n\n- The bottle costs $1 more than the cork\n\nThe only way that works is:\n\n- Cork: $0.05\n\n- Bottle: $1.05\n\nBecause $1.05 - $0.05 = $1, and $1.05 + $0.05 = $1.10.\n\nI think that covers it. Unless there's some other interpretation or trick in the wording, but I don't see it right now. So, the cork costs $0.05.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.05} \\]"
