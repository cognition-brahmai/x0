        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train traveling between Town A and Town B, which are 120 miles apart. The train's speed is affected by the wind, which changes its speed by 10 mph depending on whether it's with or against the wind. We're also told that traveling against the wind takes 30 minutes longer than traveling with the wind. We need to find the train's speed in still air, meaning without any wind affecting it.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say the train's speed in still air is \\( s \\) mph. When it's traveling with the wind, its effective speed would be \\( s + 10 \\) mph, and when it's traveling against the wind, its effective speed would be \\( s - 10 \\) mph.\n\nNext, we know that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, the time it takes to travel from Town A to Town B with the wind would be \\( \\frac{120}{s + 10} \\) hours, and the time against the wind would be \\( \\frac{120}{s - 10} \\) hours.\n\nAccording to the problem, the time against the wind is 30 minutes longer than the time with the wind. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we can express this relationship as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120}{s - 10} = \\frac{120}{s + 10} + 0.5\n\\]\n\nNow, we have an equation with one variable, \\( s \\), which we can solve to find the train's speed in still air.\n\nLet's solve this equation step by step.\n\nFirst, subtract \\( \\frac{120}{s + 10} \\) from both sides to isolate the difference in times:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120}{s - 10} - \\frac{120}{s + 10} = 0.5\n\\]\n\nTo combine these fractions, we need a common denominator, which would be \\( (s - 10)(s + 10) = s^2 - 100 \\).\n\nSo, rewriting the left side with the common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120(s + 10) - 120(s - 10)}{(s - 10)(s + 10)} = 0.5\n\\]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n\\[\n120(s + 10) - 120(s - 10) = 120s + 1200 - 120s + 1200 = 2400\n\\]\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2400}{s^2 - 100} = 0.5\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( s^2 \\), we can multiply both sides by \\( s^2 - 100 \\) and then divide both sides by 0.5:\n\n\\[\n2400 = 0.5(s^2 - 100)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4800 = s^2 - 100\n\\]\n\n\\[\ns^2 = 4900\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{4900} = 70 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\nSo, the train's speed in still air is 70 mph.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If the train's speed in still air is 70 mph, then with the wind it's 80 mph and against the wind it's 60 mph.\n\nTime with wind: \\( \\frac{120}{80} = 1.5 \\) hours.\n\nTime against wind: \\( \\frac{120}{60} = 2 \\) hours.\n\nDifference: \\( 2 - 1.5 = 0.5 \\) hours, which matches the given information.\n\nLooks good! So, the train's speed in still air is 70 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70 \\text{ mph}} \\]"
