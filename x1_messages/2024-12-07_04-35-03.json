        "content": "So I've got this problem about a snail climbing up a wall. The snail climbs 3 feet each day and then slips back 2 feet each night. The wall is 30 feet high, and I need to figure out how many days it will take for the snail to reach the top.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening each day. During the day, the snail climbs up 3 feet, but at night, it slips back 2 feet. So, the net progress each day is 3 feet minus 2 feet, which is 1 foot per day.\n\nBut wait, that seems too simple. If the snail is making 1 foot of progress each day, then for a 30-foot wall, it would take 30 days. But I feel like there might be more to it.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Maybe the snail keeps climbing like that until the last day when it reaches or surpasses the top without slipping back.\n\nSo, let's consider that on the final day, the snail climbs the remaining distance during the day and doesn't slip back at night because it has already reached the top.\n\nOkay, so I need to find out when the snail reaches or surpasses the 30-foot mark during its daytime climb.\n\nLet's denote the number of days it takes as \\( d \\).\n\nEach day, the snail makes a net progress of 1 foot, as I calculated earlier. But on the last day, it climbs 3 feet without slipping back.\n\nSo, for the first \\( d - 1 \\) days, the snail climbs 1 foot per day, and on the last day, it climbs 3 feet.\n\nTherefore, the total climb can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total climb} = (d - 1) \\times 1 + 3\n\\]\n\nAnd this total climb should be at least 30 feet:\n\n\\[\n(d - 1) \\times 1 + 3 \\geq 30\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nd - 1 + 3 \\geq 30\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd + 2 \\geq 30\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd \\geq 28\n\\]\n\nSo, it would take at least 28 days for the snail to reach the top.\n\nBut let's verify this. If \\( d = 28 \\), then:\n\n\\[\n(28 - 1) \\times 1 + 3 = 27 \\times 1 + 3 = 27 + 3 = 30 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nPerfect, that matches the wall height.\n\nWait a minute, but earlier I thought it would take 30 days if it makes 1 foot per day. What's the difference?\n\nThe difference is that on the last day, the snail climbs the remaining distance without slipping back at night. So, effectively, it makes faster progress on the last day.\n\nLet me think about it another way. Each full day-night cycle, the snail makes a net progress of 1 foot. So, after 27 days, the snail would have climbed 27 feet (since 27 days \u00d7 1 foot/day = 27 feet). On the 28th day, it climbs 3 feet during the day, reaching 30 feet, and since it has reached the top, it doesn't slip back at night.\n\nTherefore, it takes 28 days in total.\n\nBut let's consider if the wall were a little taller. For example, if the wall was 31 feet, then after 27 days, the snail would have climbed 27 feet. On the 28th day, it climbs 3 feet, reaching 30 feet during the day, and then doesn't slip back at night because it has reached the top. So, it hasn't yet reached 31 feet. Wait, but in this problem, the wall is 30 feet, so 28 days seem correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of problem.\n\nLet me try to generalize it. Each day, the snail climbs up 3 feet and slips back 2 feet, making a net progress of 1 foot per day. But on the last day, it doesn't slip back.\n\nSo, for a wall of height \\( h \\), the number of days \\( d \\) can be found by solving:\n\n\\[\n(d - 1) \\times \\text{net progress per day} + \\text{daytime climb} \\geq h\n\\]\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\[\n(d - 1) \\times 1 + 3 \\geq h\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd - 1 + 3 \\geq h\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd + 2 \\geq h\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd \\geq h - 2\n\\]\n\nBut in our earlier calculation, for \\( h = 30 \\), \\( d = 28 \\), which matches \\( d \\geq 30 - 2 \\), so \\( d \\geq 28 \\).\n\nWait, but if I plug in \\( h = 31 \\), then \\( d \\geq 29 \\), which seems correct because after 28 days, the snail would have reached 30 feet, and on the 29th day, it would climb 3 more feet, reaching 33 feet, but since the wall is 31 feet, it would reach the top on the 29th day.\n\nBut in our original problem, \\( h = 30 \\), so \\( d = 28 \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the snail needs to reach 30 feet, and on the last day, it climbs 3 feet to reach exactly 30 feet.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that the snail needs to make up the difference of 30 feet, but on the last day, it climbs 3 feet without slipping back.\n\nSo, for the first \\( d - 1 \\) days, it climbs 1 foot per day, and on the last day, it climbs 3 feet.\n\nTherefore, the total climb is \\( (d - 1) \\times 1 + 3 = d + 2 \\) feet.\n\nSetting this equal to 30 feet:\n\n\\[\nd + 2 = 30\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd = 28\n\\]\n\nAgain, 28 days.\n\nBut let's consider if the wall were 29 feet. Then:\n\n\\[\n(d - 1) \\times 1 + 3 \\geq 29\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd - 1 + 3 \\geq 29\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd + 2 \\geq 29\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd \\geq 27\n\\]\n\nSo, it would take 27 days to reach 29 feet.\n\nWait, but let's see: after 26 days, the snail has climbed 26 feet (since 26 days \u00d7 1 foot/day = 26 feet). On the 27th day, it climbs 3 feet, reaching 29 feet during the day, and doesn't slip back at night because it has reached the top.\n\nSo, yes, 27 days for a 29-foot wall.\n\nSimilarly, for a 30-foot wall, it would take 28 days.\n\nBut let's think about it again. Maybe there's a better way to model this.\n\nSuppose the snail needs to climb 30 feet. Each day, it makes a net progress of 1 foot, but on the last day, it climbs 3 feet without slipping back.\n\nSo, for the first \\( d - 1 \\) days, it climbs 1 foot per day, and on the last day, it climbs 3 feet.\n\nTherefore, the total climb is:\n\n\\[\n(d - 1) \\times 1 + 3 = d + 2\n\\]\n\nSet this equal to 30:\n\n\\[\nd + 2 = 30\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd = 28\n\\]\n\nSo, 28 days.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the snail needing to be just below the top at the start of the last day.\n\nSo, if the snail needs to be at or above 30 feet at the end of day \\( d \\), and on day \\( d \\), it climbs 3 feet without slipping back, then at the start of day \\( d \\), it needs to be at or above 27 feet.\n\nBecause 27 feet + 3 feet = 30 feet.\n\nBut before that, each day it makes a net progress of 1 foot.\n\nSo, to reach 27 feet, starting from 0, it would take 27 days, since 27 days \u00d7 1 foot/day = 27 feet.\n\nThen, on the 28th day, it climbs 3 feet to reach 30 feet.\n\nTherefore, it takes 28 days.\n\nWait, but this seems consistent with the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the snail's position at the end of each day.\n\nAt the end of day 1: climbs 3 feet, then slips back 2 feet, so net +1 foot.\n\nAt the end of day 2: another +1 foot, so total +2 feet.\n\n...\n\nAt the end of day 27: 27 feet.\n\nAt the end of day 28: climbs 3 feet to 30 feet, and stays there.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the snail needs to reach 30 feet, and on the last day, it climbs 3 feet without slipping back, then the snail needs to be at least 27 feet at the start of the last day.\n\nBecause 27 feet + 3 feet = 30 feet.\n\nGiven that the snail makes 1 foot net progress per day for the first \\( d - 1 \\) days, then to reach 27 feet, it would take 27 days.\n\nThen, on the 28th day, it climbs the remaining 3 feet.\n\nTherefore, it takes 28 days in total.\n\nSo, the answer should be 28 days.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nLet me calculate the snail's position day by day until it reaches 30 feet.\n\nDay 1:\n\n- climbs 3 feet during the day\n\n- slips back 2 feet at night\n\n- net +1 foot\n\n- position: 1 foot\n\nDay 2:\n\n- climbs 3 feet during the day: 1 + 3 = 4 feet\n\n- slips back 2 feet at night: 4 - 2 = 2 feet\n\n- net +1 foot from previous day\n\n- total position: 2 feet\n\nDay 3:\n\n- climbs 3 feet during the day: 2 + 3 = 5 feet\n\n- slips back 2 feet at night: 5 - 2 = 3 feet\n\n- net +1 foot from previous day\n\n- total position: 3 feet\n\n...\n\nI can see a pattern here. Each day, the snail makes a net progress of 1 foot.\n\nSo, after 27 days, the snail would be at 27 feet.\n\nOn day 28:\n\n- climbs 3 feet during the day: 27 + 3 = 30 feet\n\n- since it has reached the top, it doesn't slip back at night.\n\nTherefore, it reaches 30 feet on day 28.\n\nThus, the answer is 28 days.\n\nAlternatively, if the wall were higher, say 31 feet, then:\n\nAfter 27 days: 27 feet\n\nDay 28: climbs to 30 feet during the day, but hasn't reached 31 feet yet, so it slips back 2 feet at night: 30 - 2 = 28 feet\n\nDay 29: climbs 3 feet during the day: 28 + 3 = 31 feet, reaches the top, and doesn't slip back.\n\nSo, it would take 29 days for a 31-foot wall.\n\nBut in this problem, with a 30-foot wall, 28 days is correct.\n\nTherefore, the snail will take 28 days to climb a 30-foot wall.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]"
