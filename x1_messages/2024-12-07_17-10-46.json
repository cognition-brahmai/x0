        "content": "Let's see. I have a box with 12 red balls, 18 blue balls, and 6 green balls. So, in total, there are 12 + 18 + 6 = 36 balls. I need to pick three balls without replacement and find the probability that I get one of each color.\n\nFirst, I should know how many ways there are to pick three balls out of 36. That's the total number of possible outcomes. Then, I need to find out how many of those outcomes include one red, one blue, and one green ball. The probability will be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick three balls out of 36 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So, C(36, 3) = 36! / (3!(36 - 3)!) = (36 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 34) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 7,140.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes: I need one red, one blue, and one green ball. The number of ways to choose one red ball out of 12 is C(12, 1) = 12. Similarly, the number of ways to choose one blue ball out of 18 is C(18, 1) = 18, and the number of ways to choose one green ball out of 6 is C(6, 1) = 6.\n\nSince these choices are independent, the total number of favorable outcomes is the product of these individual choices: 12 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 6.\n\nLet me calculate that: 12 \u00d7 18 = 216, and 216 \u00d7 6 = 1,296.\n\nSo, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes: 1,296 / 7,140.\n\nI should simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 12.\n\n1,296 \u00f7 12 = 108\n\n7,140 \u00f7 12 = 595\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 108/595.\n\nWait, can this be simplified further? Let's check if 108 and 595 have any common divisors.\n\n108 factors: 2 \u00d7 54, 3 \u00d7 36, 4 \u00d7 27, 6 \u00d7 18, 9 \u00d7 12\n\n595 factors: 5 \u00d7 119, 7 \u00d7 85, 17 \u00d7 35\n\nHmm, no common factors between 108 and 595, so 108/595 is the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal for better understanding. Let's divide 108 by 595.\n\n108 \u00f7 595 \u2248 0.1815\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.1815, or 18.15%.\n\nBut maybe I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total number of ways to pick 3 balls out of 36 is C(36, 3) = 7,140. That seems correct.\n\nThen, number of ways to pick one ball of each color: C(12,1) \u00d7 C(18,1) \u00d7 C(6,1) = 12 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 6 = 1,296. That also seems correct.\n\nThen, probability = 1,296 / 7,140 = 108/595 \u2248 0.1815. That seems consistent.\n\nWait a minute, another way to think about this is to consider the sequence in which the balls are picked.\n\nFor example, the first ball can be any color, but then the second ball has to be a different color, and the third ball has to be the remaining color.\n\nBut I think the method I used is simpler and correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nThe number of ways to arrange one red, one blue, and one green ball is 3! = 6, but since we're dealing with combinations, not permutations, we don't need to consider the order.\n\nWait, no, in combinations, order doesn't matter. So, my initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 108/595, or approximately 18.15%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{108}{595}} \\]"
