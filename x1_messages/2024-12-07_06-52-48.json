        "content": "So, the store has a deal where for every 5 items you buy, you get a 6th item for free. The customer is buying 30 items, and I need to figure out how many additional items they'll get for free.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the discount scheme. It says \"for every 5 items bought, you get a 6th item free.\" So, for every group of 5 items, there's one free item.\n\nLet me think about this. If the customer buys 5 items, they get 1 free. So, total items received is 5 + 1 = 6.\n\nIf they buy 10 items, that's two sets of 5, so they get 2 free items. Total items received: 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nSimilarly, for 15 items bought: three sets of 5, so 3 free items. Total: 15 + 3 = 18.\n\nI see a pattern here. For every 5 items bought, they get 1 free. So, for 30 items, I can calculate how many sets of 5 are there in 30.\n\n30 divided by 5 is 6. So, they get 6 free items.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. If they buy 30 items, and for every 5 bought, they get 1 free, then yes, 30 / 5 = 6 free items.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it. Sometimes, these discount schemes can be a bit tricky.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to see how many groups of 6 items (5 paid + 1 free) they are getting.\n\nIf each group is 6 items, and they buy 30 items, then the number of groups is 30 / 6 = 5 groups.\n\nSo, 5 groups mean they get 5 free items.\n\nWait, now I have two different answers: one is 6 free items, the other is 5 free items.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nLet me try to clarify.\n\nIn the first approach, for every 5 items bought, they get 1 free. So, 30 / 5 = 6 free items.\n\nIn the second approach, for every 6 items (5 paid + 1 free), they get 1 free. So, 30 / 6 = 5 free items.\n\nBut hold on, in the second approach, if they get 5 groups of 6 items, that would be 5 free items.\n\nBut in the first approach, it's 6 free items.\n\nWhich one makes more sense?\n\nLet me consider a smaller number to test.\n\nSuppose the customer buys 10 items.\n\nFirst approach: 10 / 5 = 2 free items.\n\nSecond approach: 10 / 6 = 1.666, which wouldn't make sense in this context.\n\nWait, but in reality, if they buy 10 items, how many free items do they get?\n\nWell, for every 5 bought, get 1 free. So, for 10 bought, they should get 2 free items.\n\nSo, the first approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a \"buy 5, get 1 free\" deal, then for every 5 purchased, they get 1 additional free.\n\nSo, for 30 purchased, number of free items is 30 / 5 = 6 free items.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes these deals are structured differently, like \"buy 5, get 1 free,\" meaning for every 6 items, 5 are paid and 1 is free.\n\nBut in that case, the number of free items should be the number of groups of 6.\n\nWait, but in the earlier small example, for 10 purchased items, how many free items would that be?\n\nUsing the first approach: 10 / 5 = 2 free items.\n\nUsing the second approach: 10 / 6 = 1 group of 6 with 4 items left over, so only 1 free item.\n\nBut according to the deal, \"for every 5 bought, get 1 free.\" So, for 10 bought, they should get 2 free.\n\nTherefore, the first approach seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 30 bought, they should get 30 / 5 = 6 free items.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a cap or a limit to the discount.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any cap, so I'll assume that for every 5 bought, they get 1 free, without any restrictions.\n\nTherefore, for 30 bought, they get 6 free.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider another angle.\n\nSuppose the customer buys 30 items. How many groups of 5 are there in 30?\n\n30 / 5 = 6 groups.\n\nFor each group, they get 1 free item.\n\nSo, 6 groups * 1 free per group = 6 free items.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a \"buy 5, get 1 free\" deal, it might be interpreted as for every 6 items, 5 are paid and 1 is free.\n\nBut in that case, the number of free items would be the number of complete groups of 6.\n\nFor 30 items, 30 / 6 = 5 groups.\n\nSo, 5 free items.\n\nBut according to the deal as stated, \"for every 5 items bought, get 1 free,\" which seems to align with the first approach.\n\nMoreover, in the first approach, for 10 bought items, they get 2 free, totaling 12 items.\n\nIn the second approach, for 10 bought, they get 1 free, totaling 11 items.\n\nBut according to the deal, it should be 12 items.\n\nTherefore, the first approach seems more accurate.\n\nHence, for 30 bought items, they should get 6 free items, totaling 36 items.\n\nBut let's see what the question is asking.\n\nIt says, \"how many additional items will they receive for free?\"\n\nThe additional items are the free ones, so 6 free items.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to consider that some of the bought items are actually part of the free items.\n\nNo, the customer is buying 30 items, and getting some additional items for free.\n\nSo, the additional items are the free ones.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 6 free items.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any overlap or if the free items are included in the 30 bought items.\n\nThe deal is \"for every 5 items bought, get a 6th item free.\"\n\nSo, for every 5 bought, they get 1 free.\n\nThe free items are in addition to the bought ones.\n\nHence, for 30 bought, they get 6 free.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes these deals can be interpreted as \"buy 5, get 1 free,\" meaning for every 6 items, 5 are paid and 1 is free.\n\nBut according to the problem, it's \"for every 5 items bought, get a 6th item free.\"\n\nWhich seems to align with the first interpretation.\n\nTherefore, the customer gets 6 free items in addition to the 30 they bought.\n\nSo, the final answer is 6 additional free items.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
