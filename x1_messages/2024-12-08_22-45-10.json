        "content": "In environmental science, the term \"keystone species\" refers to a species that has a disproportionately large effect on its environment relative to its abundance. So, the correct answer is C.\n\nTo elaborate, a keystone species plays a critical role in maintaining the structure of an ecological community and the balance of its ecosystem. Even if this species is relatively rare, its impact on the environment is significant. The term \"keystone\" is used because, like the keystone in an arch, this species holds the ecosystem together, and its removal can lead to dramatic changes or even collapse of the ecosystem.\n\nFor example, sea otters are considered a keystone species in the coastal ecosystems of the Pacific Ocean. They prey on sea urchins, which in turn feed on kelp. If sea otters are removed, sea urchin populations can explode, leading to overgrazing of kelp forests, which are crucial habitats for many other marine species. Thus, the presence of sea otters has a cascading effect on the entire ecosystem, making them a keystone species.\n\nOther examples include apex predators like wolves in Yellowstone National Park or lions in Africa, which regulate populations of herbivores and thereby influence plant communities. Beavers are another classic example; their dam-building activities create wetlands that support a diverse array of species.\n\nIt's important to note that while keystone species are vital, they are different from indicator species, which signal the health of an ecosystem, or flagship species, which are used to represent an environmental cause.\n\nUnderstanding keystone species is crucial for conservation efforts because protecting these species can have wide-ranging benefits for the entire ecosystem."
