        "content": "So I've got this limit problem here: I need to find the limit as x approaches infinity of (3x^2 - 2x)/(x^2 + 1). Hmm, okay, let's see how to tackle this.\n\nFirst off, I know that when you're dealing with limits as x approaches infinity, you're basically seeing what happens to the function as x gets really, really large. For rational functions like this one, where both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials, there's a general rule I can follow.\n\nThe rule is that you look at the degrees of the polynomials in the numerator and the denominator. The degree is just the highest power of x in the polynomial. So, in the numerator, 3x^2 - 2x, the highest power is x^2, so the degree is 2. Similarly, in the denominator, x^2 + 1, the highest power is also x^2, so degree 2.\n\nNow, according to the rules I learned, if the degrees of the numerator and the denominator are the same, then the limit as x approaches infinity is the ratio of the leading coefficients. The leading coefficient is the number in front of the highest power of x.\n\nIn this case, the leading coefficient of the numerator is 3 (from 3x^2), and the leading coefficient of the denominator is 1 (from x^2). So, the limit should be 3/1, which is 3.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I should try to manipulate the expression to make sure. One common technique is to divide both the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of x in the denominator. Here, that's x^2.\n\nSo, let's do that:\n\nNumerator: (3x^2 - 2x) / x^2 = 3 - 2/x\n\nDenominator: (x^2 + 1) / x^2 = 1 + 1/x^2\n\nNow, the expression becomes (3 - 2/x) / (1 + 1/x^2)\n\nAs x approaches infinity, what happens to terms like 2/x and 1/x^2? They approach zero, right? Because dividing 2 by a really large number gives almost zero, and similarly for 1 divided by a really large number squared.\n\nSo, as x approaches infinity, the expression simplifies to (3 - 0) / (1 + 0) = 3/1 = 3.\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier using the rule about degrees and leading coefficients.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider what would happen if the degrees were different. For example, if the degree of the numerator was higher than the denominator, the limit would approach infinity. And if the degree of the numerator was lower than the denominator, the limit would approach zero. But in this case, they're equal, so it's the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the growth rates of the polynomials. Both the numerator and the denominator grow quadratically since their highest power is x^2. The coefficient of x^2 in the numerator is 3, and in the denominator, it's 1, so as x gets very large, the ratio approaches 3.\n\nLet me try plugging in some large values of x to see if this makes sense.\n\nLet's say x = 100:\n\n(3*(100)^2 - 2*100) / (100^2 + 1) = (3*10000 - 200) / (10000 + 1) = (30000 - 200) / 10001 = 29800 / 10001 \u2248 2.9797\n\nThat's pretty close to 3.\n\nLet's try x = 1000:\n\n(3*(1000)^2 - 2*1000) / (1000^2 + 1) = (3*1000000 - 2000) / (1000000 + 1) = (3000000 - 2000) / 1000001 = 2998000 / 1000001 \u2248 2.9980\n\nEven closer to 3.\n\nAnd x = 1,000,000:\n\n(3*(1,000,000)^2 - 2*1,000,000) / (1,000,000^2 + 1) = (3*1,000,000,000,000 - 2,000,000) / (1,000,000,000,000 + 1) = (3,000,000,000,000 - 2,000,000) / 1,000,000,000,001 = 2,999,998,000,000 / 1,000,000,000,001 \u2248 2.999998\n\n practically 3.\n\nSo, all these methods point to the limit being 3.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any other approach I can take. Maybe L'H\u00f4pital's rule, which is used for indeterminate forms like infinity over infinity or zero over zero.\n\nIn this case, as x approaches infinity, both the numerator and the denominator approach infinity, so it's an indeterminate form of type \u221e/\u221e. Therefore, L'H\u00f4pital's rule applies.\n\nL'H\u00f4pital's rule says that if you have an indeterminate form, you can take the derivative of the numerator and the derivative of the denominator and then take the limit of that ratio.\n\nSo, let's try that.\n\nDerivative of the numerator: d/dx (3x^2 - 2x) = 6x - 2\n\nDerivative of the denominator: d/dx (x^2 + 1) = 2x\n\nSo now, the limit becomes (6x - 2)/(2x)\n\nSimplify this: (6x - 2)/(2x) = 3 - 1/x\n\nNow, take the limit as x approaches infinity: 3 - 1/\u221e = 3 - 0 = 3\n\nAgain, it confirms the limit is 3.\n\nIs there any other method I can use to verify this? Maybe factoring out x^2 from both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nSo, factoring x^2 out:\n\nNumerator: x^2(3 - 2/x)\n\nDenominator: x^2(1 + 1/x^2)\n\nSo, the expression becomes [x^2(3 - 2/x)] / [x^2(1 + 1/x^2)] = (3 - 2/x)/(1 + 1/x^2)\n\nWhich is the same as what I had before, and as x approaches infinity, it's 3/1 = 3.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways now. The limit is definitely 3.\n\nJust to make sure there are no tricks here, let's see if the function is defined as x approaches infinity. The denominator x^2 + 1 is always positive for all real x, since x^2 is always non-negative and adding 1 makes it at least 1. So, no worries about division by zero.\n\nAlso, the function is continuous everywhere, so the limit as x approaches infinity should just be the value the function approaches, which we've determined is 3.\n\nI think that's solid. No doubts left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
