        "content": "Let's tackle this rectangle problem step by step. So, we're told that a rectangle's width is half its length, and the perimeter is 30 cm. We need to find the dimensions, specifically the length and the width.\n\nFirst, I know that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides, or more efficiently, by the formula P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width.\n\nGiven that the width is half the length, I can express that as W = (1/2)L.\n\nAlso, the perimeter is given as 30 cm, so P = 30 cm.\n\nNow, I can substitute the expression for W into the perimeter formula:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\n30 = 2L + 2*(1/2)L\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n30 = 2L + 1L\n\n30 = 3L\n\nNow, solving for L:\n\nL = 30 / 3\n\nL = 10 cm\n\nThen, since W = (1/2)L:\n\nW = (1/2)*10\n\nW = 5 cm\n\nSo, the length is 10 cm and the width is 5 cm.\n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense. The perimeter should be 2*L + 2*W = 2*10 + 2*5 = 20 + 10 = 30 cm. That matches the given perimeter.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there are other ways to approach this problem.\n\nAlternative method 1:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the length as L and the width as W.\n\nGiven W = (1/2)L\n\nAnd P = 2L + 2W = 30\n\nSubstitute W:\n\n2L + 2*(1/2)L = 30\n\n2L + L = 30\n\n3L = 30\n\nL = 10 cm\n\nW = 5 cm\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternative method 2:\n\nLet\u2019s think in terms of ratios. Since W = (1/2)L, the ratio of width to length is 1:2.\n\nSo, for every 1 part of width, there are 2 parts of length.\n\nThe perimeter consists of 2 lengths and 2 widths, so total parts are 2*2 + 2*1 = 4 + 2 = 6 parts.\n\nGiven that the perimeter is 30 cm, each part is 30 / 6 = 5 cm.\n\nTherefore, width is 1 part = 5 cm, and length is 2 parts = 10 cm.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nAlternative method 3:\n\nUsing the perimeter formula P = 2(L + W)\n\nGiven P = 30 and W = (1/2)L\n\nSubstitute:\n\n30 = 2(L + (1/2)L)\n\n30 = 2*(3/2)L\n\n30 = 3L\n\nL = 10 cm\n\nW = 5 cm\n\n\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\n\nNow, let me consider if there could be any other interpretations or potential mistakes.\n\nMistake 1:\n\n\u8bef\u5047\u8bbe\u5bbd\u5ea6\u662f\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u4e24\u500d\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u534a\u3002\u4f46\u9898\u76ee\u660e\u786e\u8bf4\u5bbd\u5ea6\u662f\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u4e00\u534a\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5W = (1/2)L\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\n\nMistake 2:\n\n\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5468\u957f\u65f6\u9519\u8bef\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u516c\u5f0f\u3002\u5468\u957f\u5e94\u8be5\u662fP = 2L + 2W\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5176\u4ed6\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5982L + W + L + W\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u76f8\u540c\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3a\u4e86 consistency\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u516c\u5f0f\u66f4\u597d\u3002\n\nMistake 3:\n\n\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0 arithmetic \u9519\u8bef\u3002\u6bd4\u5982\uff0c\u5728\u52a0\u6cd5\u6216\u9664\u6cd5\u4e2d\u72af\u9519\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u4e0a\u8ff0\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\uff0c30 = 3L\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5L = 10 cm\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\n\nMistake 4:\n\n\u5fd8\u8bb0\u68c0\u67e5\u5355\u4f4d\u3002\u9898\u76ee\u4e2d\u5355\u4f4d\u662f\u5398\u7c73\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u4e5f\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5398\u7c73\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5355\u4f4d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\n\nMistake 5:\n\n\u5047\u8bbe\u77e9\u5f62\u662f\u6b63\u65b9\u5f62\u3002\u4f46\u6839\u636e\u9898\u610f\uff0c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u662f\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u4e00\u534a\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u65b9\u5f62\uff0c\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\n\n\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u662f\u5426\u9700\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e2a\u89e3\u662f\u5426\u552f\u4e00\u3002\n\nGiven the constraints, W = (1/2)L and P = 30 cm, with L and W both positive real numbers, this should have only one solution.\n\n\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e14\u53d8\u91cf\u6570\u91cf\u7b49\u4e8e\u65b9\u7a0b\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u6709\u552f\u4e00\u89e3\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u957f\u5ea610 cm\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea65 cm\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u6ee1\u8db3\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3002\n\n\u603b\u7ed3\uff1a\n\n\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u76f4\u63a5\u4ee3\u5165\u3001\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6cd5\u548c perimeter \u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u77e9\u5f62\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u4e3a10 cm\uff0c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e3a5 cm\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u89e3\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u4e14\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{length} = 10 \\text{ cm}, \\text{ width} = 5 \\text{ cm}} \\]"
