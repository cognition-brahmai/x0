        "content": "So there's a class with 40 students, and 60% of them are girls. I need to find out how many boys there are. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that the total number of students is 40. If 60% of them are girls, then the remaining percentage must be boys, right? So, I can calculate the percentage of boys by subtracting the girls' percentage from 100%.\n\nPercentage of boys = 100% - 60% = 40%\n\nNow, to find out how many boys there are, I need to find 40% of 40 students.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. For example, I could first find out how many girls there are and then subtract that number from the total number of students to get the number of boys.\n\nSo, if 60% of 40 students are girls:\n\nNumber of girls = 60% of 40 = (60/100) * 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24\n\nThen, number of boys = total students - number of girls = 40 - 24 = 16\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward. But earlier, I tried to calculate 40% of 40 directly, which should also give me the number of boys.\n\nLet me do that: 40% of 40 = (40/100) * 40 = 0.4 * 40 = 16\n\nGreat, both methods give me the same answer, which is 16 boys in the class.\n\nI think it's always good to cross-verify my calculations, especially with percentages, because sometimes it's easy to get confused with the percentages and the actual numbers.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the ratio of girls to boys. If 60% are girls, then the ratio of girls to the total number is 60:100, which simplifies to 3:5. Similarly, boys would be 40:100, which is 2:5.\n\nSo, for every 5 students, 3 are girls and 2 are boys. Therefore, in a class of 40 students, the number of boys would be (2/5) * 40 = 16, which matches my previous calculations.\n\nI feel confident with this answer now. So, there are 16 boys in the class.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
