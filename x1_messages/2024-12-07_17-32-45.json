        "content": "Let's see. I'm driving at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour for 2 hours and 30 minutes. I need to find out how far I'll have traveled.\n\nFirst, I know that distance is equal to speed multiplied by time. So, distance = speed \u00d7 time.\n\nMy speed is 60 miles per hour, and time is 2 hours and 30 minutes. But, I need to make sure that the units are consistent. Since speed is in miles per hour, time should be in hours.\n\nSo, I need to convert 2 hours and 30 minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.\n\nTherefore, total time is 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours.\n\nNow, distance = 60 miles per hour \u00d7 2.5 hours = 150 miles.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, in 1 hour, I travel 60 miles.\n\nIn 2 hours, I travel 120 miles.\n\nIn 0.5 hours, I travel 30 miles.\n\nTotal distance: 120 + 30 = 150 miles.\n\nYeah, that matches.\n\nOr, another way: speed is 60 miles per hour, time is 2.5 hours, so distance is 60 \u00d7 2.5 = 150 miles.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]\n"
