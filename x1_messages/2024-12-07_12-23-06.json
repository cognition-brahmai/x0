        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a company with 80 employees. First, we need to find out how many of them have a college degree. The problem says that 60% of the employees have a college degree. To find out how many that is, we can calculate 60% of 80.\n\nLet me do that: 60% of 80 is 0.6 times 80, which is 48 employees. So, 48 employees have a college degree.\n\nNext, the problem says that 25% of those with a college degree also have a postgraduate degree. So, we need to find out what 25% of 48 is.\n\nLet's calculate that: 25% of 48 is 0.25 times 48, which equals 12.\n\nTherefore, 12 employees have a postgraduate degree.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider here? The problem seems straightforward. We have the total number of employees, the percentage with a college degree, and the percentage of those who also have a postgraduate degree. By multiplying these percentages step by step, we can find the number of employees with a postgraduate degree.\n\nI think that's it. The answer should be 12 employees have a postgraduate degree.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
