        "content": "Let's dive into this problem step by step. So, we've got a car rental company that's thinking about adding electric vehicles (EVs) to their fleet. They currently have 500 gasoline-powered cars, each with an average daily rental rate of $50 and a fuel cost of $10 per day. The EVs would have a higher daily rental rate of $60 but no fuel costs. The company is considering replacing half of its gasoline-powered cars with EVs, so that's 250 cars.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the potential increase in revenue from this change. To do that, I should figure out the current revenue from the 250 gasoline-powered cars and compare it to the revenue that would come from 250 EVs.\n\nLet's start with the current situation:\n\n- Each gasoline-powered car brings in $50 per day in rental revenue but has a fuel cost of $10 per day. So, the net revenue per gasoline-powered car per day is $50 - $10 = $40.\n\n- For 250 cars, the total daily net revenue would be 250 cars * $40/car/day = $10,000/day.\n\nNow, let's look at the proposed scenario with EVs:\n\n- Each EV brings in $60 per day in rental revenue and has no fuel costs. So, the net revenue per EV per day is $60.\n\n- For 250 EVs, the total daily net revenue would be 250 EVs * $60/EV/day = $15,000/day.\n\nThe potential increase in daily revenue would be $15,000/day (EVs) - $10,000/day (gasoline) = $5,000/day.\n\nThat seems straightforward. But, we also need to consider the initial investment required to purchase the EVs and how long it would take for the increased revenue to pay back that investment. This is known as the payback period.\n\nFirst, let's find out the additional cost of buying the EVs instead of gasoline-powered cars.\n\n- The average price for a gasoline-powered car is $30,000.\n\n- The average price for an EV is $40,000.\n\n- So, the additional cost per EV is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.\n\n- For 250 EVs, the total additional investment would be 250 * $10,000 = $2,500,000.\n\nNow, the increased daily revenue is $5,000. To find out how many days it would take to recover the initial investment, we can divide the total additional investment by the daily increase in revenue.\n\nPayback period in days = $2,500,000 / $5,000/day = 500 days.\n\nBut, it's more common to express payback periods in years. Assuming 365 days in a year,\n\nPayback period in years = 500 days / 365 days/year \u2248 1.37 years.\n\nSo, the payback period would be approximately 1.37 years.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, the net revenue for gasoline-powered cars:\n\n$50 - $10 = $40 per car per day.\n\nFor 250 cars: 250 * $40 = $10,000 per day.\n\nFor EVs:\n\n$60 per car per day, no fuel cost.\n\nFor 250 EVs: 250 * $60 = $15,000 per day.\n\nDifference: $15,000 - $10,000 = $5,000 per day.\n\nAdditional cost per EV: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.\n\nTotal additional cost for 250 EVs: 250 * $10,000 = $2,500,000.\n\nPayback period: $2,500,000 / $5,000/day = 500 days, which is about 1.37 years.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But, is there anything else we should consider?\n\nWell, we might want to consider other costs associated with EVs and gasoline-powered cars, such as maintenance costs, battery replacement costs for EVs, or any subsidies or incentives for purchasing EVs. However, since these details aren't provided, we'll have to make do with the information given.\n\nAlso, it's important to consider that EVs might have different utilization rates compared to gasoline-powered cars. For example, if EVs are in higher demand and thus rented out more days per month, that could affect the overall revenue. But again, since we don't have that data, we'll assume that the utilization rate remains the same.\n\nAnother factor could be the length of the rental periods. If EVs are being rented for longer periods, that could impact revenue differently. But, without specific information, it's hard to factor that in.\n\nSo, based on the given data, the potential increase in revenue is $5,000 per day, and the payback period for the additional investment would be approximately 1.37 years.\n\nBut, to make this more realistic, perhaps we should consider the annual revenue increase.\n\nDaily increase: $5,000.\n\nAssuming 365 days in a year, annual increase would be $5,000 * 365 = $1,825,000 per year.\n\nWith a one-time additional investment of $2,500,000, the payback period is $2,500,000 / $1,825,000/year \u2248 1.37 years.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, it checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the cars might not be rented every single day, we should factor in the utilization rate. But again, without specific data, it's hard to adjust for that.\n\nMoreover, we should consider the lifetime of the vehicles. If the vehicles are expected to last for, say, 10 years, then the total net present value of the investment could be calculated, but that would require discount rates and more detailed financial data, which isn't provided here.\n\nGiven the constraints of the problem, I think the payback period of approximately 1.37 years is a reasonable estimate.\n\nBut, to make it more precise, perhaps we should consider that there are leap years with 366 days. However, over the long term, the average is 365.25 days per year, but for a payback period of less than two years, it's probably not significant enough to affect the result meaningfully.\n\nAlternatively, if the company operates seven days a week without closure, using 365 days is acceptable. If there are days when the cars are not rented, that would extend the payback period.\n\nBut, as per the data given, assuming 365 days per year, the payback period is approximately 1.37 years.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- By replacing 250 gasoline-powered cars with EVs, the company can increase its daily revenue by $5,000.\n\n- The additional investment required is $2,500,000.\n\n- The payback period for this investment is approximately 1.37 years.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable return on investment, assuming that the other costs and factors remain constant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{1.37 \\text{ years}}"
