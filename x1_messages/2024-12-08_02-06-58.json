        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a cylindrical container that's 5 cm in radius and 20 cm tall, completely filled with water. Then, all that water is poured into another cylindrical container that has a radius of 10 cm, and I need to find out how high the water will be in that second container.\n\nAlright, first things first. I need to recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder because that's what's being transferred here\u2014water, which will take the shape of the container it's in.\n\nThe volume V of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nV = \u03c0r\u00b2h\n\nWhere r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nSo, for the first container, it's filled to the brim, so its volume of water is:\n\nV\u2081 = \u03c0*(5 cm)\u00b2*(20 cm) = \u03c0*25 cm\u00b2*20 cm = 500\u03c0 cm\u00b3\n\nNow, this entire volume is poured into the second container, which has a radius of 10 cm. We need to find the height h\u2082 of the water in this second container.\n\nThe volume of water doesn't change, so V\u2081 = V\u2082.\n\nSo, V\u2082 = \u03c0*(10 cm)\u00b2*h\u2082 = \u03c0*100 cm\u00b2*h\u2082\n\nSetting V\u2081 equal to V\u2082:\n\n500\u03c0 cm\u00b3 = \u03c0*100 cm\u00b2*h\u2082\n\nNow, I can solve for h\u2082:\n\nh\u2082 = (500\u03c0 cm\u00b3)/(\u03c0*100 cm\u00b2) = 500\u03c0 cm\u00b3 / 100\u03c0 cm\u00b2 = 5 cm\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. But let's double-check.\n\nFirst, volume of the first cylinder: \u03c0r\u00b2h = \u03c0*(5)^2*(20) = 500\u03c0 cm\u00b3\n\nSecond cylinder has radius 10 cm, so its base area is \u03c0*(10)^2 = 100\u03c0 cm\u00b2\n\nVolume = base area * height, so 500\u03c0 cm\u00b3 = 100\u03c0 cm\u00b2 * h\u2082\n\nDivide both sides by 100\u03c0 cm\u00b2: h\u2082 = 5 cm\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the relationship between the radii. The second cylinder has a radius twice that of the first (10 cm vs. 5 cm), so its base area is four times larger because area scales with the square of the radius (since A = \u03c0r\u00b2).\n\nSo, if the base area is four times larger, the height of the water should be one-fourth of the original height, because volume is base area times height.\n\nOriginal height is 20 cm, so new height should be 20 cm / 4 = 5 cm.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the volumes directly: the first cylinder has volume 500\u03c0 cm\u00b3, the second has volume \u03c0*(10)^2*h\u2082 = 100\u03c0*h\u2082 cm\u00b3\n\nSetting them equal: 500\u03c0 = 100\u03c0*h\u2082 => h\u2082 = 5 cm\n\nSame answer again.\n\nI think it's consistent across different approaches, so I can be confident that the height of the water in the second container will be 5 cm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 \\text{ cm}} \\]"
