        "content": "Let's tackle this break-even analysis problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces 500 units of a product every day. Each unit costs $12 to produce, and they sell each unit for $20. On top of that, there are fixed costs of $3,000 per day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the factory to break even.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what break-even means. Break-even is when the total revenue equals the total costs. Total costs include both the fixed costs and the variable costs. Variable costs are those that change with the level of production, like the production cost per unit, while fixed costs remain the same regardless of the production level.\n\nSo, let's define the variables:\n\n- Production cost per unit: $12\n\n- Selling price per unit: $20\n\n- Fixed costs per day: $3,000\n\n- Units produced per day: 500\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the daily variable costs and the daily revenue.\n\nDaily variable costs = production cost per unit * units produced per day\n\nDaily variable costs = $12 * 500 = $6,000\n\nDaily revenue = selling price per unit * units produced per day\n\nDaily revenue = $20 * 500 = $10,000\n\nNow, total daily costs = fixed costs + variable costs\n\nTotal daily costs = $3,000 + $6,000 = $9,000\n\nDaily profit or loss = daily revenue - total daily costs\n\nDaily profit or loss = $10,000 - $9,000 = $1,000\n\nSo, the factory makes a daily profit of $1,000.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is about breaking even. If the factory is already making a profit of $1,000 per day, does that mean it has already broken even? Or is there some initial investment or something that needs to be accounted for?\n\nLet me re-read the problem to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\n\"A factory produces 500 units of a product every day. The production cost per unit is $12, and each unit is sold for $20. If the factory has fixed costs of $3,000 per day, how many days will it take for the factory to break even?\"\n\nIt seems like the factory is operating daily, incurring fixed costs of $3,000 per day, variable costs of $12 per unit, and selling each unit for $20. Since they produce 500 units per day, their daily revenue is $10,000, and total daily costs are $9,000, leading to a daily profit of $1,000.\n\nIf the factory is making a daily profit, then over time, it would cover any initial costs or losses. But the problem doesn't mention any initial investment or starting costs beyond the daily fixed costs. So, perhaps the break-even point is when the total revenue equals the total of all costs incurred up to that point.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the fixed costs of $3,000 per day include some initial setup costs that are spread out daily, or perhaps there's a one-time fixed cost that needs to be recovered.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the fixed costs are cumulative, meaning that each day adds another $3,000 to the total fixed costs.\n\nLet me consider that. If fixed costs are $3,000 per day, and variable costs are $6,000 per day, total daily costs are $9,000, and revenue is $10,000, resulting in a daily profit of $1,000.\n\nIn this case, since they are making a profit each day, the break-even point would be when the accumulated profits equal the accumulated fixed costs.\n\nBut actually, the profits are covering both the fixed and variable costs. Wait, no, profits are what's left after covering all costs, both fixed and variable.\n\nWait, let's recall that:\n\nTotal revenue = total costs at the break-even point.\n\nTotal costs = fixed costs + variable costs.\n\nVariable costs are dependent on the number of units produced and sold.\n\nIn this problem, the factory produces and sells 500 units every day.\n\nSo, variable costs per day = $12 * 500 = $6,000.\n\nFixed costs per day = $3,000.\n\nTotal costs per day = $6,000 + $3,000 = $9,000.\n\nRevenue per day = $20 * 500 = $10,000.\n\nDaily profit = $10,000 - $9,000 = $1,000.\n\nSo, each day, the factory is covering its daily costs and making an extra $1,000.\n\nBut break-even typically refers to the point where total revenue equals total costs, including all initial investments or fixed costs.\n\nIn this case, since fixed costs are ongoing daily, it seems like the factory is accumulating fixed costs each day, but also covering those costs through daily revenue.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at it from the perspective of contribution margin.\n\nContribution margin per unit = selling price per unit - variable cost per unit.\n\nContribution margin per unit = $20 - $12 = $8.\n\nTotal contribution margin per day = contribution margin per unit * units produced per day.\n\nTotal contribution margin per day = $8 * 500 = $4,000.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated daily profit as $1,000, but according to this, the contribution margin is $4,000.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing things.\n\nLet me recall that:\n\nTotal revenue = price per unit * quantity sold.\n\nTotal variable costs = variable cost per unit * quantity sold.\n\nTotal costs = total variable costs + total fixed costs.\n\nProfit = total revenue - total costs.\n\nIn this case:\n\nTotal revenue per day = $20 * 500 = $10,000.\n\nTotal variable costs per day = $12 * 500 = $6,000.\n\nTotal fixed costs per day = $3,000.\n\nTotal costs per day = $6,000 + $3,000 = $9,000.\n\nProfit per day = $10,000 - $9,000 = $1,000.\n\nSo, the factory is making a daily profit of $1,000.\n\nNow, to find the break-even point, we need to determine how many days it takes for the cumulative profit to cover the cumulative fixed costs.\n\nWait, but fixed costs are incurred daily. So, total fixed costs after d days would be $3,000 * d.\n\nTotal variable costs after d days would be $6,000 * d.\n\nTotal revenue after d days would be $10,000 * d.\n\nTotal costs after d days = $6,000d + $3,000d = $9,000d.\n\nTotal revenue after d days = $10,000d.\n\nBreak-even occurs when total revenue equals total costs:\n\n$10,000d = $9,000d.\n\nBut that would imply d = 0, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, there must be something wrong with this approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed costs are one-time costs, not daily.\n\nBut the problem states \"fixed costs of $3,000 per day.\"\n\nWait, maybe it's cumulative fixed costs of $3,000, not $3,000 per day.\n\nLet me check the problem again.\n\n\"No, it says fixed costs of $3,000 per day.\"\n\nSo, fixed costs are $3,000 each day.\n\nIn that case, total fixed costs after d days are $3,000d.\n\nTotal variable costs after d days are $6,000d.\n\nTotal costs after d days are $9,000d.\n\nTotal revenue after d days are $10,000d.\n\nBreak-even occurs when total revenue equals total costs:\n\n$10,000d = $9,000d.\n\nSubtracting $9,000d from both sides:\n\n$1,000d = 0.\n\nThis implies d = 0.\n\nBut that can't be right. If they're making a profit of $1,000 per day, they should be breaking even immediately, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the fixed costs are initial one-time costs, and then $3,000 per day ongoing.\n\nBut the problem says \"fixed costs of $3,000 per day.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fixed costs are $3,000 in total, not per day.\n\nBut the problem specifies \"per day.\"\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nPerhaps I should calculate the break-even point in units, and then convert that into days based on the daily production.\n\nThe break-even point in units is calculated as:\n\nBreak-even units = total fixed costs / (selling price per unit - variable cost per unit).\n\nIn this case, selling price per unit is $20, variable cost per unit is $12, so contribution margin per unit is $8.\n\nBreak-even units = $3,000 / $8 = 375 units.\n\nSo, the factory needs to sell 375 units to break even.\n\nGiven that they produce and sell 500 units per day, they would break even in less than a day.\n\nSpecifically, days to break even = total break-even units / units produced per day.\n\nDays to break even = 375 / 500 = 0.75 days.\n\nSo, it would take 0.75 days to break even.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that fixed costs are $3,000 per day, so for 0.75 days, the fixed costs would be $3,000 * 0.75 = $2,250.\n\nBut the break-even formula uses total fixed costs, which in this case would be $3,000 for a full day.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fixed costs are $3,000 in total, not per day.\n\nLet me consider that possibility.\n\nIf fixed costs are $3,000 in total, and the factory makes a daily profit of $1,000, then to cover the fixed costs, it would take $3,000 / $1,000 per day = 3 days.\n\nBut the problem specifies \"fixed costs of $3,000 per day,\" which suggests that fixed costs are ongoing daily.\n\nIf fixed costs are $3,000 per day, then cumulative fixed costs after d days are $3,000d.\n\nTotal costs after d days are $9,000d.\n\nTotal revenue after d days are $10,000d.\n\nSet total revenue equal to total costs:\n\n$10,000d = $9,000d.\n\nThis simplifies to d = 0.\n\nThis can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed costs are only incurred once, and then there are daily variable costs.\n\nBut the problem says \"fixed costs of $3,000 per day.\"\n\nThis is perplexing.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nPerhaps the fixed costs are $3,000 in total, and the variable costs are $12 per unit per day.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, given the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fixed costs are $3,000 per day, and the variable costs are $12 per unit, regardless of the production volume.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because variable costs should be dependent on the number of units produced.\n\nWait, perhaps the factory incurs $3,000 in fixed costs regardless of how many units it produces, and variable costs are $12 per unit.\n\nIn that case, with 500 units per day, variable costs are $6,000 per day, total costs are $9,000 per day, and revenue is $10,000 per day, leading to a daily profit of $1,000.\n\nTo cover the fixed costs of $3,000, it would take $3,000 / $1,000 per day = 3 days.\n\nBut if fixed costs are $3,000 per day, then cumulative fixed costs after 3 days would be $9,000, and total revenue would be $10,000 per day.\n\nWait, but total costs include both fixed and variable costs.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the contribution margin.\n\nThe contribution margin is the amount of revenue left over after covering variable costs, which contributes to covering fixed costs.\n\nContribution margin per unit = selling price per unit - variable cost per unit = $20 - $12 = $8.\n\nContribution margin per day = contribution margin per unit * units produced per day = $8 * 500 = $4,000 per day.\n\nFixed costs are $3,000 per day.\n\nSo, each day, the factory covers its fixed costs with the contribution margin and has some left over as profit.\n\nIn this case, the factory covers $3,000 of fixed costs each day, with a contribution margin of $4,000, leaving $1,000 as profit.\n\nBut break-even is when total contributions cover all fixed costs.\n\nIf fixed costs are $3,000 per day, and contribution margin is $4,000 per day, then to cover one day's fixed costs, it would take $3,000 / $4,000 = 0.75 days.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because fixed costs are ongoing daily.\n\nThis is getting really confusing.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the break-even point in terms of cumulative costs and revenues.\n\nLet\u2019s define d as the number of days.\n\nTotal revenue after d days = $10,000d.\n\nTotal costs after d days = total fixed costs + total variable costs.\n\nTotal fixed costs after d days = $3,000d.\n\nTotal variable costs after d days = $6,000d.\n\nTotal costs after d days = $9,000d.\n\nSet total revenue equal to total costs:\n\n$10,000d = $9,000d.\n\nSubtract $9,000d from both sides:\n\n$1,000d = 0.\n\nThus, d = 0.\n\nThis suggests that the factory is already breaking even at zero days, which implies that it doesn't have any costs or revenues, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed costs are one-time costs, and then there are daily variable costs.\n\nIf fixed costs are one-time $3,000, and daily variable costs are $6,000, with daily revenue of $10,000, then daily profit is $4,000 ($10,000 - $6,000 variable costs), and after covering the one-time fixed costs of $3,000, the break-even point would be $3,000 / $4,000 per day = 0.75 days.\n\nIn this case, the factory would break even in 0.75 days.\n\nBut the problem says \"fixed costs of $3,000 per day,\" which suggests that fixed costs are ongoing daily.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nLet me consider that fixed costs are indeed $3,000 per day, and variable costs are $6,000 per day, totaling $9,000 in daily costs, with daily revenue of $10,000, leading to a daily profit of $1,000.\n\nIn this scenario, the factory is making a profit each day, so it's already past the break-even point, which would have been at some point before day 1.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense in practical terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed costs are incurred before production starts, and then there are daily variable costs and revenues.\n\nBut the problem states \"fixed costs of $3,000 per day,\" which suggests that fixed costs are ongoing daily.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should look up the definition of fixed costs in this context.\n\nFixed costs are typically costs that do not change with the level of production or sales, such as rent, salaries, etc. Variable costs change with the level of production.\n\nIn this problem, fixed costs are given as $3,000 per day, which might include daily portions of larger fixed costs, like daily rent, daily salaries, etc.\n\nGiven that, total daily costs are fixed costs plus variable costs: $3,000 + $12*500 = $9,000.\n\nRevenue is $20*500 = $10,000.\n\nProfit is $1,000 per day.\n\nSo, if the factory operates for one day, it covers its daily costs and makes a profit of $1,000.\n\nIn this case, the break-even point is when total revenue equals total costs.\n\nTotal revenue after d days: $10,000d.\n\nTotal costs after d days: $9,000d.\n\nSet them equal:\n\n$10,000d = $9,000d.\n\nThis implies d = 0.\n\nThis suggests that the factory breaks even at the start, before any production or sales occur, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the interpretation of \"fixed costs of $3,000 per day.\"\n\nMaybe the fixed costs are $3,000 in total, not per day.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\nTotal fixed costs: $3,000.\n\nDaily variable costs: $6,000.\n\nDaily revenue: $10,000.\n\nDaily profit: $4,000.\n\nTo cover the fixed costs of $3,000, it would take $3,000 / $4,000 per day = 0.75 days.\n\nSo, the factory breaks even in 0.75 days.\n\nThis seems more reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed costs are $3,000 per day, accumulated over days.\n\nIn that case, total fixed costs after d days: $3,000d.\n\nTotal variable costs after d days: $6,000d.\n\nTotal costs: $9,000d.\n\nTotal revenue: $10,000d.\n\nSet total revenue equal to total costs:\n\n$10,000d = $9,000d.\n\nThis implies d = 0.\n\nThis suggests that the break-even point is at zero days, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed costs are $3,000 in total, and daily variable costs are $6,000, with daily revenue of $10,000.\n\nIn this case, daily profit is $4,000.\n\nTo cover the fixed costs of $3,000, it would take $3,000 / $4,000 per day = 0.75 days.\n\nSo, the factory breaks even in 0.75 days.\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nGiven the confusion about whether fixed costs are per day or in total, perhaps the problem intends for fixed costs to be a one-time cost of $3,000, not $3,000 per day.\n\nIn that case, the break-even point would be 0.75 days.\n\nHowever, the problem clearly states \"fixed costs of $3,000 per day.\"\n\nThis is problematic because, in that scenario, total fixed costs accumulate daily, and the factory is making a daily profit of $1,000.\n\nSetting total revenue equal to total costs leads to d = 0, which doesn't make practical sense.\n\nPerhaps the problem has a mistake, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory needs to cover some initial investment, and the fixed costs are ongoing.\n\nBut the problem doesn't mention any initial investment beyond the daily fixed costs.\n\nThis is really confusing.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSuppose that the fixed costs are $3,000 per day, and the factory operates for d days.\n\nTotal fixed costs: $3,000d.\n\nTotal variable costs: $12 * 500 * d = $6,000d.\n\nTotal costs: $9,000d.\n\nTotal revenue: $20 * 500 * d = $10,000d.\n\nSet total revenue equal to total costs:\n\n$10,000d = $9,000d.\n\nThis simplifies to d = 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed costs are $3,000 in total, and the variable costs are $12 per unit per day.\n\nIn that case:\n\nTotal fixed costs: $3,000.\n\nTotal variable costs after d days: $12 * 500 * d = $6,000d.\n\nTotal costs: $3,000 + $6,000d.\n\nTotal revenue after d days: $20 * 500 * d = $10,000d.\n\nSet total revenue equal to total costs:\n\n$10,000d = $3,000 + $6,000d.\n\nSubtract $6,000d from both sides:\n\n$4,000d = $3,000.\n\nTherefore, d = $3,000 / $4,000 = 0.75 days.\n\nThis seems to be the most logical answer.\n\nSo, the factory will break even in 0.75 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.75} \\]"
