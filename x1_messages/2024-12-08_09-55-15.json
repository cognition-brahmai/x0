        "content": "Let's see. So, in this group, there are twice as many women as men, and the total number of people is 45. I need to find out how many men and women there are.\n\nFirst, I should probably define variables for the number of men and women. Let's say:\n\n- Let m be the number of men.\n\n- Since there are twice as many women as men, the number of women would be 2m.\n\nNow, the total number of people is the sum of men and women, so:\n\nm + 2m = 45\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n3m = 45\n\nNow, to find m, I can divide both sides by 3:\n\nm = 45 / 3\n\nm = 15\n\nSo, there are 15 men.\n\nSince there are twice as many women:\n\nWomen = 2 * 15 = 30\n\nLet me check if that adds up to 45:\n\n15 + 30 = 45\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15 \\text{ men and } 30 \\text{ women}} \\]"
