        "content": "To design a SQL query that retrieves the top 10 most frequently ordered products from an e-commerce platform within the past month, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant tables and their relationships:**\n   - `orders`: Contains information about each order.\n   - `order_items`: Contains details about each item in an order, linking orders to products.\n   - `products`: Contains product details, including product names.\n\n2. **Determine the necessary fields:**\n   - Product name from the `products` table.\n   - Total orders for each product.\n   - Total revenue generated by each product.\n\n3. **Set the time frame:**\n   - Restrict the data to orders placed within the past month.\n\n4. **Aggregate the data:**\n   - Count the number of orders for each product.\n   - Sum the revenue (assuming there's a field for item price or total in `order_items`).\n\n5. **Sort and limit the results:**\n   - Order the products by total orders in descending order.\n   - Limit the result set to the top 10 products.\n\nGiven these steps, here's a possible SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    p.product_name,\n    COUNT(oi.order_id) AS total_orders,\n    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) AS total_revenue\nFROM \n    products p\nJOIN \n    order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id\nJOIN \n    orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id\nWHERE \n    o.order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)\nGROUP BY \n    p.product_id, p.product_name\nORDER BY \n    total_orders DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Table Joins:**\n   - Join `products` with `order_items` on `product_id` to get product details.\n   - Join `order_items` with `orders` on `order_id` to filter orders by date.\n\n2. **Date Filtering:**\n   - Use `WHERE o.order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)` to get orders from the past month.\n\n3. **Aggregation:**\n   - `COUNT(oi.order_id)` to get the total number of orders for each product.\n   - `SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price)` to calculate the total revenue for each product.\n\n4. **Grouping:**\n   - Group by `p.product_id` and `p.product_name` to aggregate data per product.\n\n5. **Sorting and Limiting:**\n   - Order the results by `total_orders` in descending order.\n   - Limit the result set to the top 10 products.\n\nThis query assumes that:\n- `products` table has columns `product_id` and `product_name`.\n- `order_items` table has columns `order_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, and `unit_price`.\n- `orders` table has columns `order_id` and `order_date`.\n\nAdjust the column names as necessary based on the actual schema of your database."
