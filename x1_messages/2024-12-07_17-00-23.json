        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains: one leaving Town A at 60 mph heading towards Town B, and the other leaving Town B at 40 mph heading towards Town A. The distance between Town A and Town B is 180 miles. I need to find out how far each train has traveled when they meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that both trains are moving towards each other, so their speeds add up relative to each other. So, the combined speed is 60 mph + 40 mph = 100 mph. This means that the distance between them is decreasing at a rate of 100 miles per hour.\n\nThe initial distance between them is 180 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Relative Speed\n\nSo, Time = 180 miles / 100 mph = 1.8 hours.\n\nNow, to find out how far each train has traveled, I can multiply their individual speeds by the time.\n\nFor the train from Town A:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 1.8 hours = 108 miles.\n\nFor the train from Town B:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time = 40 mph * 1.8 hours = 72 miles.\n\nSo, when they meet, the train from Town A has traveled 108 miles, and the train from Town B has traveled 72 miles.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The total distance should be 180 miles, and 108 + 72 does equal 180 miles, so that makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the ratio of their speeds. The train from Town A is going faster, so it should cover more distance than the train from Town B.\n\nThe speed ratio is 60:40, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nSo, the distance covered should be in the same ratio.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the distance covered by the train from Town A as 3x and from Town B as 2x.\n\nThen, 3x + 2x = 180 miles.\n\n5x = 180 miles.\n\nx = 36 miles.\n\nTherefore, the train from Town A travels 3x = 108 miles, and the train from Town B travels 2x = 72 miles.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I\u2019m confident that\u2019s the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of relative speed again. Since they are moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is 100 mph, and the time to meet is 1.8 hours, leading to the same distances.\n\nI think that\u2019s solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{108 \\text{ miles and } 72 \\text{ miles}} \\]"
