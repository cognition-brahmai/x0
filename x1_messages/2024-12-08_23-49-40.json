        "content": "Let's see. There are 400 students in the school, and 60% of them are boys. First, I need to find out how many boys and how many girls are there currently.\n\nSo, 60% of 400 students are boys. That means:\n\nNumber of boys = 60/100 * 400 = 240 boys.\n\nNow, the total number of students is 400, so the number of girls would be:\n\nNumber of girls = Total students - Number of boys = 400 - 240 = 160 girls.\n\nThe school wants to maintain a ratio of 4:3 for boys to girls. That means for every 4 boys, there should be 3 girls.\n\nLet's denote the number of boys as B and the number of girls as G. The desired ratio is B/G = 4/3.\n\nBut we know that B = 240, and we want to find out how many more girls should be admitted to achieve this ratio. Let\u2019s denote the additional girls to be admitted as X. So, the new number of girls will be 160 + X.\n\nWe want the ratio of boys to girls to be 4:3, so:\n\n240 / (160 + X) = 4 / 3.\n\nNow, we can solve for X.\n\nFirst, cross-multiply:\n\n240 * 3 = 4 * (160 + X)\n\n720 = 640 + 4X\n\nNow, subtract 640 from both sides:\n\n720 - 640 = 4X\n\n80 = 4X\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4:\n\nX = 80 / 4\n\nX = 20.\n\nSo, the school needs to admit 20 more girls to achieve the ratio of 4:3 boys to girls.\n\nLet me check this.\n\nCurrently, there are 240 boys and 160 girls. After admitting 20 more girls, there will be 180 girls.\n\nSo, the ratio will be 240:180, which simplifies to 4:3. Yes, that\u2019s correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
