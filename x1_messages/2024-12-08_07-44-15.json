        "content": "Let's see. So, there are five friends who went out for dinner and initially planned to split the bill evenly among themselves. But one friend forgot his wallet, so only four friends ended up paying, and each of them paid an extra $5 because one friend wasn\u2019t contributing.\n\nOkay, I need to find the total cost of the meal. Let\u2019s denote the total cost as \\( C \\).\n\nInitially, they planned to split the bill evenly among five friends, so each would pay \\( \\frac{C}{5} \\).\n\nBut since one friend didn\u2019t have his wallet, only four friends split the bill, so each paid \\( \\frac{C}{4} \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, each of the four friends paid an extra $5 because of this change. So, the difference between the new payment and the original payment is $5.\n\nMathematically, that\u2019s:\n\n\\[ \\frac{C}{4} - \\frac{C}{5} = 5 \\]\n\nI need to solve for \\( C \\).\n\nFirst, find a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 4 and 5 is 20.\n\nSo, convert the fractions:\n\n\\[ \\frac{C}{4} = \\frac{5C}{20} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{C}{5} = \\frac{4C}{20} \\]\n\nNow, subtract the second fraction from the first:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5C}{20} - \\frac{4C}{20} = \\frac{C}{20} \\]\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{C}{20} = 5 \\)\n\nTo find \\( C \\), multiply both sides by 20:\n\n\\[ C = 5 \\times 20 \\]\n\n\\[ C = 100 \\]\n\nSo, the total cost of the meal was $100.\n\nLet me double-check this to make sure it makes sense.\n\nIf the total cost is $100, then initially, each of the five friends would have paid \\( \\frac{100}{5} = 20 \\) dollars.\n\nBut since one friend didn\u2019t pay, the remaining four friends split the $100, so each paid \\( \\frac{100}{4} = 25 \\) dollars.\n\nThe difference between what they paid and what they initially expected to pay is \\( 25 - 20 = 5 \\) dollars, which matches the problem statement.\n\nLooks good!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
