        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a group of people with different eye colors: 40% have blue eyes, 30% have green eyes, and the rest have brown eyes. Then, 10 more people with blue eyes join the group, and after that, the percentage of blue-eyed people increases to 50%. We need to find out how many people were originally in the group.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what's given:\n\n- Originally:\n\n- 40% blue eyes\n\n- 30% green eyes\n\n- The remaining percentage must be brown eyes. Since the total percentage must add up to 100%, brown eyes must be 100% - 40% - 30% = 30%.\n\n- Then, 10 more people with blue eyes join the group.\n\n- After these 10 people join, the percentage of blue-eyed people becomes 50%.\n\nOur goal is to find the original number of people in the group.\n\nLet's denote the original number of people in the group as \\( x \\).\n\nNow, in terms of eye colors:\n\n- Number of blue-eyed people originally: \\( 0.4x \\)\n\n- Number of green-eyed people originally: \\( 0.3x \\)\n\n- Number of brown-eyed people originally: \\( 0.3x \\)\n\nWhen 10 more blue-eyed people join, the new number of blue-eyed people becomes \\( 0.4x + 10 \\), and the total number of people becomes \\( x + 10 \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the new percentage of blue-eyed people is 50%, so:\n\n\\[ \\frac{0.4x + 10}{x + 10} = 0.5 \\]\n\nNow, we can solve this equation for \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, multiply both sides by \\( x + 10 \\) to get rid of the denominator:\n\n\\[ 0.4x + 10 = 0.5(x + 10) \\]\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n\\[ 0.4x + 10 = 0.5x + 5 \\]\n\nNow, let's move all terms involving \\( x \\) to one side and constants to the other side:\n\nSubtract \\( 0.4x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 10 = 0.1x + 5 \\]\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 5 = 0.1x \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.1:\n\n\\[ x = 50 \\]\n\nSo, the original number of people in the group was 50.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it makes sense.\n\nOriginally:\n\n- Blue-eyed people: 40% of 50 = 20\n\n- Green-eyed people: 30% of 50 = 15\n\n- Brown-eyed people: 30% of 50 = 15\n\nTotal originally: 50\n\nAfter 10 blue-eyed people join:\n\n- New number of blue-eyed people: 20 + 10 = 30\n\n- New total number of people: 50 + 10 = 60\n\nNow, the percentage of blue-eyed people is \\( \\frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \\), which is 50%, which matches the problem's statement.\n\nLooks good! So, the answer is 50 people originally in the group.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
