        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 100 widgets per hour, and it operates for 8 hours a day. So, first, I need to find out how many widgets are produced in total in one day.\n\nTotal widgets per day = 100 widgets/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 800 widgets.\n\nNow, for every 10 widgets produced, there's a 50% chance that one will be defective. So, I need to figure out how many sets of 10 widgets are there in 800.\n\nNumber of sets of 10 widgets = 800 / 10 = 80 sets.\n\nFor each set, there's a 50% chance that one widget is defective. So, the expected number of defective widgets per set is 0.5.\n\nTherefore, total expected defective widgets = 80 sets \u00d7 0.5 = 40 widgets.\n\nNow, to find the number of non-defective widgets, I subtract the defective ones from the total produced.\n\nNon-defective widgets = total widgets - defective widgets = 800 - 40 = 760 widgets.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal widgets: 100/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 800 widgets.\n\nNumber of sets of 10: 800 / 10 = 80 sets.\n\nDefective per set: 50% chance per set.\n\nSo, expected defective per set: 1 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.5 widgets.\n\nTotal expected defective: 80 \u00d7 0.5 = 40 widgets.\n\nNon-defective: 800 - 40 = 760.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of probability.\n\nThe probability that a set of 10 widgets has one defective is 50%, so the expected number of defective widgets per set is 1 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.5.\n\nSo, over 80 sets, total expected defective is 80 \u00d7 0.5 = 40.\n\nTherefore, non-defective is 800 - 40 = 760.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the probability for each widget.\n\nBut wait, the problem says for every 10 widgets, there's a 50% chance that one is defective.\n\nSo, per set of 10, there's a 50% chance that one specific widget is defective.\n\nWait, actually, it's a 50% chance that one will be defective, but it doesn't specify which one.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to think that per set of 10, there is, on average, 0.5 defective widgets.\n\nTherefore, over 80 sets, that's 40 defective widgets.\n\nSo, again, 800 - 40 = 760 non-defective.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a defective rate.\n\nThe defective rate is 50% per set of 10.\n\nSo, per widget, the defective probability is 50% / 10 = 5%.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no.\n\nIf per set of 10, there's a 50% chance that one is defective, then the probability that any given widget is defective is not simply 5%.\n\nActually, it's more complex because the defect is at the set level, not at the individual widget level.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to stick with the earlier approach.\n\nTotal expected defective widgets are 40, so non-defective are 760.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as, per set of 10, expected number of defective is 0.5, so the expected number of non-defective per set is 10 - 0.5 = 9.5.\n\nThen, over 80 sets, total non-defective widgets are 80 \u00d7 9.5 = 760.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the factory produces 760 non-defective widgets in an 8-hour workday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{760} \\]"
