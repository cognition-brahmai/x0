        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a box with 5 red balls and 7 blue balls, making a total of 12 balls. We're drawing 3 balls at random without replacement, and we want to find the probability that exactly 2 of them are red.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for probability. Probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are the ways to draw exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball, and the total outcomes are all the possible ways to draw any 3 balls from the box.\n\nSo, let's find the total number of possible outcomes. Since we're drawing 3 balls out of 12 without replacement, and the order doesn't matter, this is a combination problem. The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 12 is denoted as C(12,3), which is calculated as 12! / (3! * (12-3)!). Let me compute that:\n\n12! is 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, but since we're dividing by 9!, which is 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 \u2026 \u00d7 1, those terms cancel out. So, C(12,3) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 220.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is drawing exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball. Let's find the number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 5 and 1 blue ball out of 7.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 5 is C(5,2) = (5 \u00d7 4) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 10.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 1 blue ball out of 7 is C(7,1) = 7.\n\nSince these are independent choices, we multiply them to get the total number of favorable outcomes: 10 \u00d7 7 = 70.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes: 70 / 220.\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 10: 7 / 22.\n\nSo, the probability is 7/22.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can also approach this problem using probabilities step by step, without combinations, to verify.\n\nAlright, drawing without replacement means that each draw affects the next one.\n\nThe probability of drawing exactly 2 red balls in 3 draws can happen in different sequences:\n\n1. Red, Red, Blue\n\n2. Red, Blue, Red\n\n3. Blue, Red, Red\n\nLet's calculate each of these probabilities separately and then add them up.\n\nFirst, Red, Red, Blue:\n\n- Probability of first ball being red: 5/12\n\n- Probability of second ball being red, given the first was red: 4/11\n\n- Probability of third ball being blue, given the first two were red: 7/10\n\nSo, the probability for this sequence is (5/12) \u00d7 (4/11) \u00d7 (7/10).\n\nSimilarly, for Red, Blue, Red:\n\n- First ball red: 5/12\n\n- Second ball blue, given first was red: 7/11\n\n- Third ball red, given first was red and second was blue: 4/10\n\nProbability: (5/12) \u00d7 (7/11) \u00d7 (4/10)\n\nAnd for Blue, Red, Red:\n\n- First ball blue: 7/12\n\n- Second ball red, given first was blue: 5/11\n\n- Third ball red, given first was blue and second was red: 4/10\n\nProbability: (7/12) \u00d7 (5/11) \u00d7 (4/10)\n\nNow, let's calculate each of these:\n\nFirst sequence: (5/12) \u00d7 (4/11) \u00d7 (7/10) = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 7) / (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10) = 140 / 1320\n\nSecond sequence: (5/12) \u00d7 (7/11) \u00d7 (4/10) = (5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 4) / (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10) = 140 / 1320\n\nThird sequence: (7/12) \u00d7 (5/11) \u00d7 (4/10) = (7 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4) / (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10) = 140 / 1320\n\nNow, add them up: 140/1320 + 140/1320 + 140/1320 = 420 / 1320\n\nSimplify that fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 60, get 7/22.\n\nSo, again, we get 7/22.\n\nThat matches my earlier result using combinations. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for hypergeometric distribution, since we're sampling without replacement from a finite population.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\nP(X=k) = [C(K, k) * C(N-K, n-k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (12 balls)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (5 red balls)\n\n- n is the number of draws (3 balls)\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (2 red balls)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X=2) = [C(5,2) * C(7,1)] / C(12,3) = [10 * 7] / 220 = 70 / 220 = 7/22\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. The probability is 7/22.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{22}} \\]"
