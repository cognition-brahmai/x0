        "content": "So the problem is about a spider spinning a web. The spider spins at a rate of 3 meters per hour, and we need to find out how long it will take to spin a web that is 15 meters long. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a spider that spins web at a certain speed, which is 3 meters every hour. So, its spinning rate is 3 meters per hour. And we want to know how much time it will take for this spider to spin a web that is 15 meters long.\n\nThis seems like a straightforward problem involving time, rate, and distance. Wait, in this case, instead of distance, it's the length of the web being spun. But the principle should be similar. I recall that in problems involving constant speed, the relationship between distance, rate, and time is given by the formula:\n\nDistance = Rate \u00d7 Time\n\nIn this case, the \"distance\" would be the length of the web, which is 15 meters, and the \"rate\" is the spinning rate, which is 3 meters per hour. So, plugging these values into the formula:\n\n15 meters = 3 meters/hour \u00d7 Time\n\nNow, I need to solve for Time. To do that, I can rearrange the formula to solve for Time:\n\nTime = Distance / Rate\n\nSo, Time = 15 meters / 3 meters per hour\n\nWhen I divide 15 by 3, I get 5. And the units are meters divided by meters per hour, which simplifies to hours. So, Time = 5 hours.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. If the spider spins 3 meters every hour, then in one hour it spins 3 meters, in two hours it spins 6 meters, in three hours it spins 9 meters, in four hours it spins 12 meters, and in five hours it spins 15 meters. Yes, that adds up.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor to consider. Is the spider taking any breaks? Is the spinning rate constant? The problem doesn't mention any breaks, so I'll assume the spinning is continuous at a constant rate.\n\nAlso, I should consider units. The rate is given in meters per hour, and the length is in meters, so the units work out when I divide to get time in hours.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using proportions. If 3 meters take 1 hour, then 15 meters would take x hours. So, 3 meters : 1 hour = 15 meters : x hours. Solving for x, we get x = (15 meters \u00d7 1 hour) / 3 meters = 5 hours. Same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of rates. The spinning rate is 3 meters per hour, so to find the time for 15 meters, I can divide the total length by the rate, which again gives 5 hours.\n\nI think regardless of the approach, the answer remains the same. So, it will take the spider 5 hours to spin a 15-meter long web.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the rate changes over time or if there are any other variables, but the problem doesn't indicate any variations in the spinning rate. It's assumed to be constant at 3 meters per hour.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there's any initial length or any starting conditions, but again, the problem is straightforward, starting from zero length.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
