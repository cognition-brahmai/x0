        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 120 widgets per hour. It operates 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. We need to find out how many widgets it can produce in 4 weeks.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the daily production. If it produces 120 widgets per hour for 8 hours a day, then daily production is:\n\n120 widgets/hour * 8 hours/day = 960 widgets/day\n\nNext, I'll find the weekly production. Since it works 5 days a week:\n\n960 widgets/day * 5 days/week = 4,800 widgets/week\n\nNow, for 4 weeks:\n\n4,800 widgets/week * 4 weeks = 19,200 widgets\n\nSo, the factory can produce 19,200 widgets in 4 weeks.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total number of hours the factory operates in 4 weeks and then multiply by the hourly production rate.\n\nFirst, find the total number of hours per week:\n\n8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week\n\nThen, for 4 weeks:\n\n40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 160 hours\n\nNow, multiply the total hours by the production rate:\n\n120 widgets/hour * 160 hours = 19,200 widgets\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nWait a minute, is there any holiday or downtime that might affect production? The problem doesn't mention any, so I'll assume it operates consistently for those 4 weeks.\n\nAlso, it's important to make sure that the units are consistent. Here, we're dealing with widgets per hour, hours per day, days per week, and weeks, so multiplying them step by step makes sense.\n\nI think 19,200 widgets is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{19200} \\]"
