        "content": "So there are 4 red balls and 6 blue balls in a box, making a total of 10 balls. You're picking two balls without replacement, and you want to know the probability that you pick one ball of each color. Let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once you pick a ball, you don't put it back, so the total number of balls decreases by one after each pick.\n\nNow, the total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 10 is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So, the total number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 10 is C(10, 2).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10 - 2)!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 8!) = (10 \u00d7 9) / 2 = 45.\n\nSo, there are 45 possible pairs of balls you could pick.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to pick one red and one blue ball. Since there are 4 red balls and 6 blue balls, the number of ways to pick one red and one blue is 4 \u00d7 6 = 24.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me think again. Since the order in which I pick the balls doesn't matter (because I'm picking without replacement and just interested in the combination), then yes, it should be 4 red times 6 blue, which is 24.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking one ball of each color is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that would be 24 / 45.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction. Both 24 and 45 are divisible by 3.\n\n24 \u00f7 3 = 8\n\n45 \u00f7 3 = 15\n\nSo, 24/45 simplifies to 8/15.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this in terms of probabilities of sequences. For example, I could pick a red ball first and then a blue ball, or a blue ball first and then a red ball. Since these are two distinct sequences, I can calculate the probability of each and then add them together.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nFirst, the probability of picking a red ball first is 4/10, since there are 4 red balls out of 10 total balls.\n\nThen, given that I picked a red ball first, there are now 9 balls left, with 6 of them being blue. So, the probability of picking a blue ball second is 6/9.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a red ball first and then a blue ball is (4/10) \u00d7 (6/9).\n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking a blue ball first is 6/10, and then picking a red ball second is 4/9, so the probability of picking a blue ball first and then a red ball is (6/10) \u00d7 (4/9).\n\nNow, I add these two probabilities together:\n\n(4/10 \u00d7 6/9) + (6/10 \u00d7 4/9)\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n\nFirst term: (4/10) \u00d7 (6/9) = (4 \u00d7 6) / (10 \u00d7 9) = 24 / 90\n\nSecond term: (6/10) \u00d7 (4/9) = (6 \u00d7 4) / (10 \u00d7 9) = 24 / 90\n\nAdding them together: 24/90 + 24/90 = 48/90\n\nSimplifying 48/90 by dividing numerator and denominator by 6: 48 \u00f7 6 = 8, 90 \u00f7 6 = 15, so 8/15.\n\nSo, again, I get 8/15.\n\nWait a second, earlier I got 8/15 using combinations, and now again 8/15 using sequences. That gives me confidence that 8/15 is the correct probability.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Maybe using permutations.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 10, considering order, is P(10, 2) = 10 \u00d7 9 = 90.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to pick one red and one blue in any order. So, it's the number of ways to pick a red first and then a blue, plus the number of ways to pick a blue first and then a red.\n\nWe already calculated these:\n\nNumber of ways to pick red first and then blue: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n\nNumber of ways to pick blue first and then red: 6 \u00d7 4 = 24\n\nTotal favorable outcomes: 24 + 24 = 48\n\nTherefore, the probability is 48 / 90, which simplifies to 8/15.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of conditional probability. The probability of picking one of each color could be found by considering the probability that the second ball is a different color from the first.\n\nLet's say, the probability that the second ball is a different color given that the first ball was red, plus the probability that the second ball is a different color given that the first ball was blue, weighted by the probabilities of picking each color first.\n\nBut that seems more complicated, and I already have consistent answers from the previous methods.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the inclusion-exclusion principle, but I don't think it's necessary here since the combination and sequence methods already give a clear answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. For example, does the problem specify whether the balls are identical except for color? Assuming they are, since only colors matter.\n\nAlso, picking without replacement means that the picks are dependent, which is already accounted for in the calculations above.\n\nAnother thought: could I use the hypergeometric distribution for this? Yes, the hypergeometric distribution is used for calculating probabilities when sampling without replacement from a finite population.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = [C(K, k) \u00d7 C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (10 balls)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (say, red balls, which is 4)\n\n- n is the number of draws (2 balls)\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (say, 1 red ball)\n\nSo, for one red and one blue ball, k = 1.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(1 red) = [C(4, 1) \u00d7 C(6, 1)] / C(10, 2) = (4 \u00d7 6) / 45 = 24 / 45 = 8 / 15\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIt seems like no matter which method I use, I keep getting 8/15 as the probability.\n\nLet me consider if there's any chance I'm missing something. For example, is there a possibility that picking two balls without replacement could lead to some other outcome that I'm not considering? I don't think so, because the only possible outcomes are: two reds, two blues, or one of each.\n\nWait, maybe I can calculate the probabilities of each possible outcome and see if they add up to 1.\n\nFirst, probability of two reds:\n\nNumber of ways to pick two reds: C(4, 2) = 6\n\nTotal ways: C(10, 2) = 45\n\nSo, P(two reds) = 6 / 45 = 2 / 15\n\nProbability of two blues:\n\nNumber of ways to pick two blues: C(6, 2) = 15\n\nTotal ways: 45\n\nP(two blues) = 15 / 45 = 1 / 3\n\nProbability of one of each:\n\nP(one of each) = 24 / 45 = 8 / 15\n\nNow, let's add them up:\n\n2/15 + 1/3 + 8/15\n\nConvert 1/3 to fifteenths: 1/3 = 5/15\n\nSo, 2/15 + 5/15 + 8/15 = 15/15 = 1\n\nYes, they add up to 1, which is a good check that I've accounted for all possible outcomes correctly.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the probabilities sequentially.\n\nFor example, the probability of picking a red first is 4/10, then a blue is 6/9, so (4/10)*(6/9) = 24/90\n\nProbability of picking a blue first is 6/10, then a red is 4/9, so (6/10)*(4/9) = 24/90\n\nTotal probability: 24/90 + 24/90 = 48/90 = 8/15\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider picking the balls one at a time and consider the probabilities step by step.\n\nLet's say, on the first pick, the probability of picking a red is 4/10, and then the probability of picking a blue next is 6/9. So, the combined probability is (4/10)*(6/9).\n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking a blue first is 6/10, and then a red is 4/9, so (6/10)*(4/9).\n\nAdding these gives the same 8/15.\n\nI think I've confirmed enough different ways that the probability is indeed 8/15.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider the decimal equivalent.\n\n8/15 is approximately 0.5333...\n\nLet's see if that makes sense.\n\nTotal probability should be 1, or 100%.\n\nWe have:\n\nP(two reds) = 2/15 \u2248 0.1333\n\nP(two blues) = 1/3 \u2248 0.3333\n\nP(one of each) = 8/15 \u2248 0.5333\n\nAdding them up: 0.1333 + 0.3333 + 0.5333 \u2248 1.000, which checks out.\n\nAdditionally, intuitively, since there are more blue balls than red balls, it makes sense that the probability of picking one of each is higher than picking two reds, but lower than picking two blues.\n\nWait, no, let's think about that again.\n\nP(two reds) = 2/15 \u2248 0.1333\n\nP(two blues) = 1/3 \u2248 0.3333\n\nP(one of each) = 8/15 \u2248 0.5333\n\nSo, P(one of each) is indeed the highest, which makes sense because there are more blue balls, so the chance of getting at least one blue is higher.\n\nWait, but actually, P(one of each) is higher than P(two blues), which might seem counterintuitive at first, but considering that there are more ways to get one of each compared to getting two blues, it makes sense.\n\nBecause there are more blue balls, but also more combinations that include both colors.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of expected outcomes.\n\nBut I think I've beaten this problem enough. Multiple methods lead to the same conclusion that the probability is 8/15.\n\nSo, the final answer is 8/15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{8}{15}} \\]"
