        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a family with 4 children, and each child has at least one brother and one sister. We need to figure out the gender distribution among these siblings.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. We need to determine how many boys and how many girls there are in this family of four children, given that every child has at least one brother and one sister.\n\nLet's think about what \"at least one brother and one sister\" means. For each child:\n\n- A brother is a male sibling.\n\n- A sister is a female sibling.\n\nSo, each child must have at least one male sibling and at least one female sibling.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible gender distributions for four children. Without any constraints, the possible distributions are:\n\n1. All four are boys: BBBB\n\n2. Three boys and one girl: BBBG\n\n3. Two boys and two girls: BBGG\n\n4. One boy and three girls: BGGG\n\n5. All four are girls: GGGG\n\nBut we have the condition that each child has at least one brother and one sister. So, we need to eliminate any distributions where this condition isn't met.\n\nLet's examine each possibility:\n\n1. **BBBB (All boys):**\n\n   - Each child would have three brothers but no sisters.\n\n   - This violates the condition that each child has at least one sister.\n\n   - So, this distribution is invalid.\n\n2. **BBBG (Three boys and one girl):**\n\n   - The girl has three brothers but no sisters.\n\n   - The boys each have two brothers and one sister.\n\n   - The girl does not have at least one sister.\n\n   - Therefore, this distribution is invalid.\n\n3. **BBGG (Two boys and two girls):**\n\n   - Each boy has one brother and two sisters.\n\n   - Each girl has two brothers and one sister.\n\n   - Every child has at least one brother and one sister.\n\n   - This distribution satisfies the condition.\n\n4. **BGGG (One boy and three girls):**\n\n   - The boy has three sisters but no brothers.\n\n   - Each girl has one brother and two sisters.\n\n   - The boy does not have at least one brother.\n\n   - Therefore, this distribution is invalid.\n\n5. **GGGG (All girls):**\n\n   - Each child would have three sisters but no brothers.\n\n   - This violates the condition that each child has at least one brother.\n\n   - So, this distribution is invalid.\n\nFrom this analysis, only the distribution with two boys and two girls (BBGG) satisfies the condition that each child has at least one brother and one sister.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure there are no other possible distributions that might work.\n\nSuppose there are three boys and one girl (BBBG). As we saw, the girl has no sisters, which violates the condition.\n\nSimilarly, one boy and three girls (BGGG) means the boy has no brothers, which also violates the condition.\n\nAll boys (BBBB) and all girls (GGGG) both fail because there are no sisters or brothers, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the only valid distribution is two boys and two girls.\n\nBut let's consider another angle. Maybe there's a different way to look at this.\n\nSuppose we have at least two boys and at least two girls. That way, every child would have at least one brother and one sister.\n\nIn a family with four children, having at least two boys and at least two girls means the distribution must be exactly two boys and two girls.\n\nIf there were three boys and one girl, that wouldn't satisfy the condition for the girl, as she wouldn't have a sister.\n\nSimilarly, if there were three girls and one boy, the boy wouldn't have a brother.\n\nTherefore, the only possible distribution is two boys and two girls.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the minimum and maximum number of boys and girls.\n\nEach child must have at least one brother and one sister, so:\n\n- There must be at least two boys (so that each boy has at least one brother and each girl has at least one brother).\n\n- There must be at least two girls (so that each girl has at least one sister and each boy has at least one sister).\n\nTherefore, the family must have at least two boys and at least two girls.\n\nGiven that there are four children in total, the only distribution that meets these minimums is two boys and two girls.\n\nSo, the gender distribution is two boys and two girls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ boys and } 2 \\text{ girls}} \\]"
