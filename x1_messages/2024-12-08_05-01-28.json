        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here about a farmer who has chickens and rabbits on his farm. He counts a total of 50 heads and 140 legs. I need to figure out how many chickens and how many rabbits there are.\n\nFirst, I know that both chickens and rabbits have heads, and that's probably what the 50 heads represent. So, if there are 50 heads, that means there are 50 animals in total because each animal has one head.\n\nNow, chickens have 2 legs each, and rabbits have 4 legs each. The total number of legs is 140. So, I need to find out how many of these 50 animals are chickens and how many are rabbits, based on the total number of legs.\n\nLet me try to set this up with some equations. Let's say:\n\n- Let C be the number of chickens.\n\n- Let R be the number of rabbits.\n\nFrom the information given:\n\n1. The total number of animals is 50, so:\n\nC + R = 50\n\n2. The total number of legs is 140. Since chickens have 2 legs and rabbits have 4 legs:\n\n2C + 4R = 140\n\nOkay, now I have a system of two equations with two variables.\n\nI can solve this system to find the values of C and R.\n\nLet me solve the first equation for C:\n\nC = 50 - R\n\nNow, substitute this expression for C into the second equation:\n\n2(50 - R) + 4R = 140\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n100 - 2R + 4R = 140\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n100 + 2R = 140\n\nNow, subtract 100 from both sides:\n\n2R = 40\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nR = 20\n\nSo, there are 20 rabbits.\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation for C:\n\nC = 50 - 20 = 30\n\nTherefore, there are 30 chickens and 20 rabbits.\n\nLet me double-check this to make sure it makes sense.\n\nIf there are 30 chickens, that's 30 * 2 = 60 legs.\n\nIf there are 20 rabbits, that's 20 * 4 = 80 legs.\n\nTotal legs: 60 + 80 = 140, which matches the given information.\n\nAlso, 30 + 20 = 50 heads, which also matches.\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in another way. Let's say all 50 animals are chickens. That would give me 50 * 2 = 100 legs. But actually, there are 140 legs, which is 40 legs more than 100.\n\nSince each rabbit has 2 more legs than a chicken, the difference of 40 legs must be due to the rabbits.\n\nSo, number of rabbits = 40 / 2 = 20 rabbits.\n\nThen, the number of chickens is 50 - 20 = 30 chickens.\n\nThis confirms the previous result.\n\nAlternatively, if I assume all animals are rabbits, that would be 50 * 4 = 200 legs, which is 60 legs more than the actual 140 legs.\n\nSince each chicken has 2 less legs than a rabbit, the difference of 60 legs would mean there are 60 / 2 = 30 chickens.\n\nThen, the number of rabbits would be 50 - 30 = 20 rabbits.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I end up with 30 chickens and 20 rabbits.\n\nThis gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30 \\text{ chickens and } 20 \\text{ rabbits}} \\]"
