        "content": "So there's this problem about two trains leaving different towns at the same time and heading towards each other. Town A and Town B are 360 miles apart. The first train from Town A is going at 50 mph, and the second train from Town B is going at 70 mph. I need to find out how long it takes for them to meet.\n\nOkay, let's see. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds should add up. So, 50 mph plus 70 mph is 120 mph. That means together, they're closing the distance between them at a rate of 120 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the total distance between the two towns is 360 miles. So, if they're closing in at 120 mph, the time it takes for them to meet should be the total distance divided by their combined speed. So, time equals distance divided by speed.\n\nLet me write that down: time = 360 miles / 120 mph.\n\nOkay, doing the math, 360 divided by 120 is 3. So, it should take 3 hours for the two trains to meet.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the distance each train covers in a given time and set up an equation where the sum of those distances equals 360 miles.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time as t hours.\n\nSo, the distance covered by the first train from Town A in t hours is 50t miles.\n\nThe distance covered by the second train from Town B in t hours is 70t miles.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the sum of these distances should equal the initial distance between the towns.\n\nSo, 50t + 70t = 360.\n\nCombining like terms, that's 120t = 360.\n\nNow, solving for t, t = 360 / 120, which again is 3 hours.\n\nOkay, that matches my first approach. So, it seems like 3 hours is the correct answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like whether the speeds are constant or if there's any acceleration involved. But the problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I'll assume the speeds are constant.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. Miles and miles per hour are consistent, so that's fine.\n\nIs there any chance that the trains might not meet in 3 hours? For example, if the trains were going in the same direction, I'd have to subtract their speeds, but since they're heading towards each other, adding their speeds makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it: relative speed when two objects are moving towards each other is the sum of their individual speeds. So, 50 mph + 70 mph = 120 mph. Then, time = distance / relative speed = 360 / 120 = 3 hours.\n\nYeah, I think that's solid.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can consider the distance decreasing over time.\n\nAt time t=0, distance is 360 miles.\n\nAfter 1 hour, Train A has traveled 50 miles, Train B has traveled 70 miles, so total distance covered together is 120 miles. Remaining distance is 240 miles.\n\nAfter 2 hours: 240 - 120 = 120 miles.\n\nAfter 3 hours: 120 - 120 = 0 miles.\n\nSo, indeed, they meet after 3 hours.\n\nI think that confirms it again.\n\nIs there a possibility that the answer could be different if they were moving on different tracks or something? But the problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I'll assume they're on a straight track towards each other.\n\nAlso, no mention of stops or delays, so I'll ignore those factors.\n\nSo, in conclusion, it takes 3 hours for the two trains to meet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
