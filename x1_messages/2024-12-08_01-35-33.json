        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two trains moving towards each other from Town A and Town B, which are 480 miles apart. The first train leaves Town A at 6:00 AM traveling at 60 mph, and the second train leaves Town B at 8:00 AM traveling at 80 mph. We need to find out when these two trains will meet.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how far each train has traveled by the time the second train starts at 8:00 AM.\n\nThe first train has a 2-hour head start (from 6:00 AM to 8:00 AM) traveling at 60 mph. So, the distance it covers in those 2 hours is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nDistance = 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nSo, by 8:00 AM, the first train is 120 miles away from Town A, and the remaining distance between the two trains is:\n\n480 miles - 120 miles = 360 miles\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other, starting at 8:00 AM. The first train is going at 60 mph, and the second train at 80 mph. To find out how long it will take for them to meet, we can add their speeds together because they are moving towards each other. This is called the relative speed.\n\nRelative speed = 60 mph + 80 mph = 140 mph\n\nNow, we can find the time it takes for them to cover the remaining 360 miles at this relative speed.\n\nTime = Distance / Relative speed\n\nTime = 360 miles / 140 mph = 2.5714 hours\n\nHmm, 2.5714 hours is not very straightforward. Let's convert that to hours and minutes.\n\n2 hours is 2 hours, and 0.5714 hours needs to be converted to minutes.\n\n0.5714 hours \u00d7 60 minutes/hour \u2248 34.2857 minutes\n\nSo, approximately 2 hours and 34 minutes.\n\nSince both trains started moving towards each other at 8:00 AM, we add 2 hours and 34 minutes to that time.\n\n8:00 AM + 2 hours = 10:00 AM\n\n10:00 AM + 34 minutes = 10:34 AM\n\nTherefore, the two trains will meet at approximately 10:34 AM.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the first train's head start:\n\n60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles, that seems correct.\n\nRemaining distance: 480 - 120 = 360 miles, correct.\n\nRelative speed: 60 + 80 = 140 mph, that's right.\n\nTime: 360 / 140 = 2.5714 hours, which is 2 hours and roughly 34 minutes, yes.\n\nAdding that to 8:00 AM brings us to 10:34 AM.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10:34\\ \\text{AM}} \\]"
