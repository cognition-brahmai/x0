        "content": "The 19th-century American author who wrote the classic novel \"Moby-Dick\" is Herman Melville. This novel, published in 1851, is considered one of the greatest works of American literature, although it wasn't initially successful during Melville's lifetime. \"Moby-Dick\" is a complex narrative that explores themes of obsession, revenge, and the nature of humanity, among others. It tells the story of Captain Ahab's obsessive quest to hunt down and kill the white whale, Moby-Dick, which had earlier severed his leg. The novel is known for its rich language, deep symbolism, and the character of Ishmael, the narrator who accompanies Ahab on his voyage. Over time, \"Moby-Dick\" has gained recognition for its profound insights and continues to be studied and appreciated by readers and scholars alike."
