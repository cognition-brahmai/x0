        "content": "Let's tackle this train speed problem. So, we have a train that travels at 60 mph for 2 hours and then boosts its speed to 80 mph for the next 3 hours. We need to find the average speed for the entire journey.\n\nFirst off, I know that average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, if I can find the total distance traveled and the total time taken, I can calculate the average speed.\n\nLet me try to calculate the total distance. For the first part of the journey, the train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours. Distance is speed times time, so that's 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nThen, for the next part, it travels at 80 mph for 3 hours. So, distance is 80 mph * 3 hours = 240 miles.\n\nAdding those up, the total distance is 120 miles + 240 miles = 360 miles.\n\nNow, the total time is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.\n\nSo, average speed is total distance divided by total time: 360 miles / 5 hours = 72 mph.\n\nThat seems straightforward. But maybe there's another way to look at it. Maybe I can find the weighted average of the speeds.\n\nLet's see. The train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours and 80 mph for 3 hours. So, the average speed could be a weighted average where the weights are the times spent at each speed.\n\nThe formula for weighted average speed would be (speed1 * time1 + speed2 * time2) / total time.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: (60 * 2 + 80 * 3) / 5 = (120 + 240) / 5 = 360 / 5 = 72 mph.\n\nSame answer as before. That's reassuring.\n\nWait a minute, but I've heard somewhere that average speed isn't always the same as the arithmetic mean of the speeds. Maybe there's another approach I should consider.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Maybe using the harmonic mean, which is sometimes used for average speeds.\n\nThe harmonic mean is appropriate when the distances traveled at each speed are the same. But in this case, the times are different, not the distances at each speed.\n\nHmm. I think the method I used earlier is correct, but let's double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the average speed using the formula: average speed = total distance / total time.\n\nI already did that and got 72 mph.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the average speed as the total displacement over total time, but since the train is moving in a straight line at these speeds, displacement should be equal to distance.\n\nWait, but if the train changes direction or something, that would be different. But the problem doesn't mention any change in direction, so I'll assume it's moving in a straight line.\n\nSo, in that case, average speed should indeed be total distance over total time.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I'm missing. Is there any acceleration or is the speed constant during each segment?\n\nThe problem says it travels at an average speed of 60 mph for 2 hours and then increases to 80 mph for the next 3 hours. So, it's averaging 60 mph for the first part and 80 mph for the second part.\n\nI think it's safe to assume that within each segment, the speed is constant, or at least the average speed is given, so the total distance is still speed times time for each segment.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the train is accelerating between the two speeds, and I need to account for that.\n\nBut the problem says it travels at 60 mph for 2 hours and then increases its speed to 80 mph for the next 3 hours. It doesn't specify anything about the transition between speeds, so I think it's acceptable to treat each segment separately with constant speeds.\n\nAlternatively, if there was a period of acceleration, that might affect the total distance and time, but since it's not mentioned, I'll stick with the initial approach.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. If I plot speed against time, the first 2 hours are at 60 mph, and the next 3 hours are at 80 mph. So, it's two rectangular blocks: one 2 hours by 60 mph, and another 3 hours by 80 mph.\n\nThe area under the speed-time graph gives the total distance. So, the area of the first rectangle is 120 miles, and the second is 240 miles, totaling 360 miles over 5 hours, which again gives 72 mph average speed.\n\nI think this reinforces the earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the average speed as the arithmetic mean of the two speeds, weighted by the distance traveled at each speed.\n\nHmm. That might be similar to what I did earlier.\n\nLet me try calculating it that way.\n\nFirst, find the total distance: 120 miles + 240 miles = 360 miles.\n\nTotal time: 5 hours.\n\nAverage speed: 360 miles / 5 hours = 72 mph.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to calculate it as the arithmetic mean of the speeds, it would be (60 + 80)/2 = 70 mph, but that's not matching the previous result.\n\nSo, that must not be the correct approach.\n\nWait a second, I think I see the confusion. The arithmetic mean of speeds is only applicable if equal distances are traveled at each speed. But in this case, different times are spent at each speed.\n\nSo, indeed, the correct way is to use the total distance over total time.\n\nTherefore, the average speed is 72 mph.\n\nLet me consider another approach to confirm.\n\nSuppose I consider the entire journey as two parts and find the average speed for the whole journey.\n\nAverage speed = total distance / total time.\n\nI already did that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of harmonic mean for average speeds, but again, that's typically used when the distances are equal.\n\nIn this case, since the times are equal in parts, but the speeds are different, the correct approach is still total distance over total time.\n\nI think I'm converging on the conclusion that 72 mph is the correct average speed.\n\nLet me check if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nSuppose the train is accelerating uniformly from 60 mph to 80 mph over the 3-hour period. But the problem states that it travels at 60 mph for 2 hours and then increases its speed to 80 mph for the next 3 hours.\n\nSo, it's not specified that there's a gradual increase in speed; it seems like it's traveling at a constant 60 mph for 2 hours and then at a constant 80 mph for the next 3 hours.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation stands.\n\nAnother way to look at it: if the train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours and 80 mph for 3 hours, the average speed is the total distance divided by total time, which is 360 miles / 5 hours = 72 mph.\n\nSo, I think 72 mph is the correct average speed for the entire journey.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there was a period of acceleration between 60 mph and 80 mph. If there was, say, a half-hour period where the speed increased from 60 to 80 mph, that would affect the total distance and time.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify any such period, I think it's safe to assume that the speed changes instantaneously or that the average speeds given already account for any acceleration.\n\nTherefore, sticking with the initial calculation:\n\nTotal distance = 120 miles + 240 miles = 360 miles.\n\nTotal time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.\n\nAverage speed = 360 miles / 5 hours = 72 mph.\n\nSo, the answer is 72 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72 \\text{ mph}} \\]"
