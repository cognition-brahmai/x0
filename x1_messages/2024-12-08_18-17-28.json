It was indeed a gift from France to the United States to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the American Declaration of Independence in 1876. The statue was designed by French sculptor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi and was dedicated on October 28, 1886. It has since become an iconic symbol of freedom and democracy, welcoming immigrants to the United States."
