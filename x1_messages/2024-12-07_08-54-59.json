        "content": "A word that is spelled and pronounced the same way backward and forward is called a palindrome. So, 'racecar' and 'level' are both examples of palindromic words. This concept isn't limited to words; it can also apply to phrases or sentences, though those often require ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. For instance, \"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama\" is a famous palindromic phrase."
