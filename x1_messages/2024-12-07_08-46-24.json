        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains moving towards each other from stations A and B, which are 300 miles apart. The first train from A is going at 60 mph, and the second train from B is going at 90 mph. I need to find out how long it will take for them to meet.\n\nAlright, so since they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. That makes sense because the closer they get, the faster they approach each other. So, the combined speed should be 60 mph plus 90 mph, which is 150 mph.\n\nNow, the total distance between the two stations is 300 miles. If they're moving towards each other at a combined speed of 150 mph, I can find the time it takes for them to meet by dividing the distance by their combined speed.\n\nSo, time equals distance divided by speed. That would be 300 miles divided by 150 mph. Let me do the math: 300 divided by 150 is 2. So, it should take 2 hours for the two trains to meet.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. In 2 hours, the first train traveling at 60 mph would cover 120 miles (since 60 times 2 is 120), and the second train traveling at 90 mph would cover 180 miles (90 times 2 is 180). If I add those distances together, 120 plus 180 equals 300 miles, which is exactly the distance between the two stations.\n\nPerfect, that checks out. So, my answer is correct. It will take the two trains 2 hours to meet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
