        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Let's create a simple Java program that acts as a calculator. It will take two numbers and an operator from the user and then perform the specified operation.\n\nFirst, we need to set up our Java environment. Make sure you have Java installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Oracle website if you don't have it already.\n\nNext, open your favorite text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or even a simple notepad will do.\n\nWe'll write a Java class that includes the main method, which is the entry point of any Java application.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to create the program:\n\n1. **Import necessary packages:**\n   We need to import `java.util.Scanner` to read input from the user.\n\n2. **Create the class and main method:**\n   Define a public class, say `SimpleCalculator`, and inside it, define the `main` method.\n\n3. **Read input from the user:**\n   Use the `Scanner` class to read two numbers and the operator from the user.\n\n4. **Perform the calculation:**\n   Based on the operator, perform the corresponding operation (+, -, *, /).\n\n5. **Handle division by zero:**\n   If the operator is '/' and the second number is zero, display an error message.\n\n6. **Display the result:**\n   Print the result of the operation.\n\nLet's write the code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple calculator in Java that takes two numbers and an operator from the user and performs the specified operation, you can use the following code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class SimpleCalculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Simple Calculator\");\n        System.out.println(\"Enter first number:\");\n        double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.println(\"Enter second number:\");\n        double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.println(\"Enter an operator (+, -, *, /):\");\n        char operator = scanner.next().charAt(0);\n\n        double result;\n        switch (operator) {\n            case '+':\n                result = num1 + num2;\n                break;\n            case '-':\n                result = num1 - num2;\n                break;\n            case '*':\n                result = num1 * num2;\n                break;\n            case '/':\n                if (num2 != 0) {\n                    result = num1 / num2;\n                } else {\n                    System.out.println(\"Error! Division by zero.\");\n                    return;\n                }\n                break;\n            default:\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid operator!\");\n                return;\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Importing Scanner:**\n   - `import java.util.Scanner;` is used to import the Scanner class which helps in reading input from the user.\n\n2. **Class and Main Method:**\n   - `public class SimpleCalculator` defines the class.\n   - `public static void main(String[] args)` is the main method where execution begins.\n\n3. **Reading Input:**\n   - `Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);` creates a Scanner object.\n   - `double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();` and `double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();` read the two numbers.\n   - `char operator = scanner.next().charAt(0);` reads the operator.\n\n4. **Performing Calculation:**\n   - A `switch` statement is used to perform the operation based on the operator.\n   - For division, it checks if the second number is zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n\n5. **Displaying Result:**\n   - The result is printed using `System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);`.\n\nThis program provides a basic calculator functionality and handles division by zero errors gracefully."
