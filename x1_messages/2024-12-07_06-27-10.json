        "content": "So there's a class with 30 students in total, and out of those, 18 are boys. I need to find out what percentage of the class are girls. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that the total number of students is 30, and among them, 18 are boys. So, to find out how many girls there are, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students. That should give me the number of girls.\n\nLet me do that:\n\nNumber of girls = Total students - Number of boys\n\nNumber of girls = 30 - 18\n\nNumber of girls = 12\n\nSo, there are 12 girls in the class.\n\nNow, I need to find out what percentage 12 is of 30. To find a percentage, I can use the formula:\n\nPercentage = (Part / Whole) * 100\n\nIn this case, the \"part\" is the number of girls, which is 12, and the \"whole\" is the total number of students, which is 30.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nPercentage of girls = (12 / 30) * 100\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, divide 12 by 30:\n\n12 \u00f7 30 = 0.4\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n0.4 * 100 = 40%\n\nSo, 40% of the class are girls.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nTotal students = 30\n\nNumber of boys = 18\n\nNumber of girls = 30 - 18 = 12\n\nPercentage of girls = (12 / 30) * 100\n\n12 divided by 30 is indeed 0.4, and 0.4 times 100 is 40%. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the proportion of girls in the class. Since there are 12 girls out of 30 students, I can simplify the fraction 12/30.\n\n12 \u00f7 12 = 1\n\n30 \u00f7 12 = 2.5\n\nSo, 12/30 simplifies to 1/2.5. But that doesn't directly help with the percentage. Maybe I should think of it in terms of decimals.\n\n1 divided by 2.5 is 0.4, and 0.4 multiplied by 100 is again 40%. So, it confirms the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the percentage of boys first and then subtract it from 100% to get the percentage of girls.\n\nNumber of boys = 18\n\nPercentage of boys = (18 / 30) * 100\n\n18 divided by 30 is 0.6, and 0.6 times 100 is 60%.\n\nSo, percentage of boys is 60%, which means the percentage of girls should be 100% - 60% = 40%, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlright, so all these methods lead me to the same answer: 40% of the class are girls.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I use the concept of ratios. The ratio of girls to total students is 12:30, which can be simplified by dividing both numbers by 6.\n\n12 \u00f7 6 = 2\n\n30 \u00f7 6 = 5\n\nSo, the simplified ratio is 2:5.\n\nTo find the percentage, I can convert the ratio to a fraction: 2/5.\n\nThen, 2 divided by 5 is 0.4, and 0.4 multiplied by 100 is again 40%.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I end up with 40%.\n\nI think that's pretty conclusive. Therefore, the percentage of the class that are girls is 40%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40\\%} \\]"
