        "content": "Let's see. The store sells apples at $1.50 per pound and oranges at $2.00 per pound. I need to find out how much it would cost to buy 7 pounds of apples and 5 pounds of oranges.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the cost of the apples. Since apples are $1.50 per pound and I'm buying 7 pounds, I can multiply 1.50 by 7. Let me do that:\n\n1.50 \u00d7 7 = 10.50\n\nSo, the apples will cost $10.50.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost of the oranges. Oranges are $2.00 per pound, and I'm buying 5 pounds. So, I'll multiply 2.00 by 5:\n\n2.00 \u00d7 5 = 10.00\n\nThe oranges will cost $10.00.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I need to add the cost of the apples and the cost of the oranges together:\n\n10.50 + 10.00 = 20.50\n\nTherefore, the total cost to buy 7 pounds of apples and 5 pounds of oranges is $20.50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20.50} \\]"
