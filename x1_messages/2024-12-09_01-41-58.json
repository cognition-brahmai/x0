She was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, jointly with her husband Pierre Curie and Antoine Henri Becquerel, for their work on radioactivity. Later, in 1911, she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of the elements radium and polonium. Marie Curie remains the only person to have won Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields."
