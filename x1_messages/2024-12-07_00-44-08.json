        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got 15 students in a classroom, and each one shakes hands with every other student exactly once. We need to figure out how many handshakes that amounts to in total.\n\nFirst, I think about how handshakes work. If there are two people, they shake hands once. If there are three people, person A shakes with B, B shakes with C, and A shakes with C, making three handshakes in total. So, it seems like with more people, the number of handshakes increases.\n\nI recall that in math, there's a concept called combinations, which deals with selecting groups from a larger set without regard to the order. Since a handshake between two people is the same regardless of who extends their hand first, combinations might be the way to go here.\n\nSo, if we have 15 students and we want to choose pairs of them to shake hands, it's like finding the number of unique pairs in a set of 15. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the total number of items, \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose, and \\(n!\\) denotes the factorial of \\(n\\), which is the product of all positive integers up to \\(n\\).\n\nIn this case, \\(n = 15\\) and \\(k = 2\\), since we're choosing pairs of students to shake hands.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 2) = \\frac{15!}{2!(15 - 2)!} = \\frac{15!}{2! \\times 13!}\n\\]\n\nNow, I can simplify this. Since \\(15! = 15 \\times 14 \\times 13!\\), the \\(13!\\) terms cancel out:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 2) = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13!}{2! \\times 13!} = \\frac{15 \\times 14}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{210}{2} = 105\n\\]\n\nSo, there should be 105 handshakes in total.\n\nBut wait, let me think about this another way to confirm. Maybe I can use a different approach, like summing up the handshakes each student makes.\n\nIf there are 15 students, the first student shakes hands with 14 others. The next student has already shaken hands with the first, so they shake hands with 13 remaining students. The third student has shaken hands with the first two, so they shake hands with 12 others, and so on.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be:\n\n\\[\n14 + 13 + 12 + \\ldots + 1\n\\]\n\nThis is an arithmetic series where the first term \\(a = 14\\), the last term \\(l = 1\\), and the number of terms \\(n = 14\\).\n\nThe sum \\(s\\) of an arithmetic series is given by:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{n(a + l)}{2}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{14(14 + 1)}{2} = \\frac{14 \\times 15}{2} = \\frac{210}{2} = 105\n\\]\n\nAgain, I get 105 handshakes. That matches my earlier result from the combinations approach, which is a good sign.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this. Perhaps using graphs? In graph theory, each student can be represented as a node, and each handshake as an edge connecting two nodes. The problem then becomes finding the number of edges in a complete graph with 15 nodes.\n\nThe formula for the number of edges \\(e\\) in a complete graph with \\(n\\) nodes is:\n\n\\[\ne = \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in \\(n = 15\\):\n\n\\[\ne = \\frac{15 \\times 14}{2} = \\frac{210}{2} = 105\n\\]\n\nOnce more, I arrive at 105 handshakes.\n\nIs there any other approach I can take to confirm this? Maybe trying smaller numbers and seeing if the pattern holds.\n\nLet's say there are 2 students: they shake hands once. According to the formula, \\(C(2, 2) = 1\\), which matches.\n\nWith 3 students: each shakes hands with the other two, but since each handshake is shared between two students, it's 3 handshakes in total. Using the formula, \\(C(3, 2) = 3\\), which is correct.\n\nWith 4 students: each shakes hands with 3 others, but again, each handshake is shared, so it should be 6 handshakes. Using the formula, \\(C(4, 2) = 6\\), correct.\n\nSo, the pattern holds for smaller numbers, and my calculations for 15 students consistently give me 105 handshakes.\n\nLet me consider if there's any chance of double-counting or missing some handshakes. In the combinations approach, each pair is unique and only counted once, so no double-counting. In the arithmetic series approach, I'm summing the unique handshakes each student makes, adjusting for those already counted, so that seems accurate as well.\n\nGraph theory also confirms the same number, as it's a standard formula for edges in a complete graph.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the total number of handshakes is 105.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]"
