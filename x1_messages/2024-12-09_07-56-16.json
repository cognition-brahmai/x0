        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got an airline with 50 planes, and on average, they consume 5 gallons of fuel per mile. They want to reduce their overall fuel consumption by 15% by replacing some of their older planes with newer ones that consume only 4 gallons per mile. And importantly, the total number of planes stays at 50. We need to figure out how many new planes they should buy to achieve this 15% reduction in fuel consumption.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the current total fuel consumption is. Since there are 50 planes and each consumes an average of 5 gallons per mile, the total fuel consumption per mile is:\n\nTotal current consumption = Number of planes \u00d7 Average fuel consumption per plane\nTotal current consumption = 50 \u00d7 5 = 250 gallons per mile\n\nNow, they want to reduce this by 15%. So, the target fuel consumption should be:\n\nTarget consumption = Total current consumption \u00d7 (1 - reduction percentage)\nTarget consumption = 250 \u00d7 (1 - 0.15) = 250 \u00d7 0.85 = 212.5 gallons per mile\n\nAlright, so the goal is to have the fleet consume 212.5 gallons per mile instead of 250.\n\nNext, let's think about replacing some of the old planes with new ones. Let's say they replace \"x\" number of old planes with new ones. Since the total number of planes remains 50, the number of old planes will be (50 - x).\n\nThe old planes consume 5 gallons per mile, and the new ones consume 4 gallons per mile. So, the total fuel consumption after replacement would be:\n\nTotal new consumption = (Number of old planes \u00d7 fuel consumption per old plane) + (Number of new planes \u00d7 fuel consumption per new plane)\nTotal new consumption = (50 - x) \u00d7 5 + x \u00d7 4\n\nWe want this total new consumption to equal the target consumption of 212.5 gallons per mile. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n(50 - x) \u00d7 5 + x \u00d7 4 = 212.5\n\nNow, let's solve for x.\n\nFirst, expand the equation:\n\n50\u00d75 - x\u00d75 + x\u00d74 = 212.5\n250 - 5x + 4x = 212.5\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n250 - x = 212.5\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n250 - 212.5 = x\nx = 37.5\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because you can't have half a plane. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nLet me double-check. The equation is:\n\n(50 - x) \u00d7 5 + x \u00d7 4 = 212.5\n\nLet's expand it again:\n\n50\u00d75 - x\u00d75 + x\u00d74 = 212.5\n250 - 5x + 4x = 212.5\n250 - x = 212.5\n\nSubtract 212.5 from both sides:\n\n250 - 212.5 = x\nx = 37.5\n\nHmm, still getting x = 37.5. Maybe it's acceptable to have half a plane in a mathematical model, but in reality, they can't buy half a plane. Perhaps the problem allows for fractional planes in the model, and we'll interpret it accordingly.\n\nSo, according to the calculation, they need to replace 37.5 planes with the new, more fuel-efficient models to achieve a 15% reduction in overall fuel consumption.\n\nBut let's verify this. If they replace 37.5 planes:\n\nNumber of old planes = 50 - 37.5 = 12.5\nFuel consumption from old planes = 12.5 \u00d7 5 = 62.5 gallons per mile\nFuel consumption from new planes = 37.5 \u00d7 4 = 150 gallons per mile\nTotal consumption = 62.5 + 150 = 212.5 gallons per mile\n\nYes, that matches the target consumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps using the concept of weighted averages.\n\nThe current average fuel consumption is 5 gallons per mile. The new planes consume 4 gallons per mile. We want the overall average to be such that the total consumption is reduced by 15%, which we've already calculated as 212.5 gallons per mile.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of the average fuel consumption per plane after replacement.\n\nCurrent total consumption: 250 gallons per mile\nTarget total consumption: 212.5 gallons per mile\nNumber of planes: 50\n\nSo, target average fuel consumption per plane = 212.5 / 50 = 4.25 gallons per mile\n\nNow, we have old planes at 5 gallons per mile and new planes at 4 gallons per mile, and we want an average of 4.25 gallons per mile.\n\nThis is a weighted average problem.\n\nLet\u2019s let \u201cn\u201d be the number of new planes, and \u201c50 - n\u201d be the number of old planes.\n\nThe average fuel consumption would be:\n\n[(50 - n) \u00d7 5 + n \u00d7 4] / 50 = 4.25\n\nMultiply both sides by 50:\n\n(50 - n) \u00d7 5 + n \u00d7 4 = 212.5\n\nWait, this is the same equation as before. So, solving it gives n = 37.5 again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can set up the equation in terms of the reduction in fuel consumption.\n\nEach new plane replaces an old one, reducing consumption by 1 gallon per mile (since old is 5 and new is 4).\n\nBut the total number of planes remains 50, so we're adding new planes and removing old ones.\n\nLet\u2019s think differently. Let\u2019s consider that for each new plane added, we are reducing the consumption by 1 gallon per mile for that plane.\n\nBut since the total number of planes is fixed, replacing one old plane with one new plane reduces the total consumption by 1 gallon per mile.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate because the total number of planes remains the same.\n\nWait, no. If I replace one old plane with one new plane, I'm reducing the consumption by 1 gallon per mile for that plane.\n\nSo, if I replace \u201cx\u201d old planes with \u201cx\u201d new planes, the total reduction would be x gallons per mile.\n\nBut, since the total consumption needs to be reduced by 15%, which is 37.5 gallons per mile (since 15% of 250 is 37.5), then x = 37.5.\n\nAgain, we get the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of the fuel consumption per plane.\n\nThe current average is 5 gallons per mile.\n\nWe want an overall average of 4.25 gallons per mile.\n\nThe new planes consume 4 gallons per mile.\n\nSo, the difference between the old planes and the new average is 5 - 4.25 = 0.75 gallons per mile.\n\nThe difference between the new planes and the new average is 4.25 - 4 = 0.25 gallons per mile.\n\nSo, the ratio of old planes to new planes should be equal to the ratio of the differences.\n\nRatio of old to new = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1 / 3\n\nSo, for every 1 old plane, there are 3 new planes.\n\nTherefore, the number of old planes is one quarter of the total fleet.\n\nSince the total fleet is 50 planes, number of old planes = 50 / 4 = 12.5\n\nTherefore, number of new planes = 50 - 12.5 = 37.5\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nThis consistency across different methods reinforces that the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the airline should replace 37.5 of its old planes with new, more fuel-efficient planes to achieve a 15% reduction in overall fuel consumption.\n\nBut since they can't replace half a plane, they would need to replace either 37 or 38 planes. To be precise, they should replace 38 planes to achieve or exceed the 15% reduction.\n\nLet\u2019s check that.\n\nIf they replace 38 planes:\n\nNumber of old planes = 50 - 38 = 12\n\nFuel consumption from old planes = 12 \u00d7 5 = 60 gallons per mile\n\nFuel consumption from new planes = 38 \u00d7 4 = 152 gallons per mile\n\nTotal consumption = 60 + 152 = 212 gallons per mile\n\nWhich is slightly less than the target 212.5 gallons per mile.\n\nWait, but 212 is less than 212.5, so actually, replacing 37 planes would be:\n\nNumber of old planes = 50 - 37 = 13\n\nFuel consumption from old planes = 13 \u00d7 5 = 65 gallons per mile\n\nFuel consumption from new planes = 37 \u00d7 4 = 148 gallons per mile\n\nTotal consumption = 65 + 148 = 213 gallons per mile\n\nWhich is more than the target 212.5.\n\nSo, replacing 37 planes would result in a consumption of 213 gallons per mile, which is still a reduction, but slightly more than the target.\n\nReplacing 38 planes would result in 212 gallons per mile, which is less than the target.\n\nTherefore, to achieve exactly 15% reduction, they should replace 37.5 planes, but since that's not possible, they can replace 38 planes to achieve a slightly greater reduction.\n\nAlternatively, if they replace 37 planes, they achieve a reduction slightly less than 15%.\n\nDepends on whether they want to meet or exceed the 15% reduction.\n\nIn conclusion, the airline should purchase and replace 38 of its older planes with new, more fuel-efficient models to achieve at least a 15% reduction in overall fuel consumption.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{38} \\]"
