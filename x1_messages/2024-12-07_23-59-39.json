        "content": "To solve the system of equations y = 2x + 3 and y = -x + 1, we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations simultaneously. There are several methods to solve such systems, including substitution, elimination, or graphing. In this case, since both equations are already solved for y, the substitution method is straightforward.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Set the two expressions for y equal to each other because both expressions equal y:\n\n   2x + 3 = -x + 1\n\n2. Solve for x:\n\n   First, add x to both sides to get all x terms on one side:\n\n   2x + x + 3 = -x + x + 1\n\n   3x + 3 = 1\n\n   Next, subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the x term:\n\n   3x + 3 - 3 = 1 - 3\n\n   3x = -2\n\n   Finally, divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:\n\n   x = -2/3\n\n3. Now that we have the value of x, substitute it back into one of the original equations to find y. Let's use the first equation y = 2x + 3:\n\n   y = 2*(-2/3) + 3\n\n   y = -4/3 + 3\n\n   To add these, convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:\n\n   y = -4/3 + 9/3\n\n   y = ( -4 + 9 ) / 3\n\n   y = 5/3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = -2/3 and y = 5/3.\n\nTo verify this solution, we can plug these values back into both original equations to ensure they hold true.\n\nFirst equation: y = 2x + 3\n\n   5/3 = 2*(-2/3) + 3\n\n   5/3 = -4/3 + 9/3\n\n   5/3 = 5/3 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSecond equation: y = -x + 1\n\n   5/3 = -(-2/3) + 1\n\n   5/3 = 2/3 + 3/3\n\n   5/3 = 5/3 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSince both equations are satisfied, we can be confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left( -\\dfrac{2}{3},\\ \\dfrac{5}{3} \\right)} \\]"
