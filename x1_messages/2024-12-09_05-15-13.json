        "content": "Alright, I'll help you build a simple command-line calculator in Python that can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers. We'll also include some error handling to make sure the calculator can deal with invalid inputs gracefully.\n\nFirst, let's outline what the calculator needs to do:\n\n1. **Ask the user to choose an operation:** addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.\n\n2. **Ask the user to input two numbers:** These will be the operands for the chosen operation.\n\n3. **Perform the operation:** Based on the user's choice, perform the appropriate mathematical operation.\n\n4. **Display the result:** Show the result of the operation to the user.\n\n5. **Handle errors:** Make sure the program doesn't crash if the user enters invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values or dividing by zero.\n\nLet's start by writing the code step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Get User Input for Operation\n\nWe need to display the available operations to the user and ask them to select one. We'll use a simple print statement to list the options and then use the `input()` function to get the user's choice.\n\n```python\nprint(\"Select operation:\")\nprint(\"1. Addition\")\nprint(\"2. Subtraction\")\nprint(\"3. Multiplication\")\nprint(\"4. Division\")\n\nchoice = input(\"Enter choice (1/2/3/4): \")\n```\n\n### Step 2: Get User Input for Numbers\n\nNext, we need to ask the user to input two numbers. We'll use the `input()` function again for this, but we need to convert the inputs to floating-point numbers to handle decimal values.\n\n```python\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n```\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Operation\n\nBased on the user's choice, we'll perform the corresponding operation. We'll use conditional statements (`if-elif-else`) to handle the different operations.\n\n```python\nif choice == '1':\n    result = num1 + num2\n    operation = \"addition\"\nelif choice == '2':\n    result = num1 - num2\n    operation = \"subtraction\"\nelif choice == '3':\n    result = num1 * num2\n    operation = \"multiplication\"\nelif choice == '4':\n    if num2 != 0:\n        result = num1 / num2\n        operation = \"division\"\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\")\n        exit()\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid input\")\n    exit()\n```\n\n### Step 4: Display the Result\n\nAfter performing the operation, we'll display the result to the user.\n\n```python\nprint(f\"Result of {operation}: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Step 5: Handle Errors\n\nTo handle errors such as invalid inputs (non-numeric values), we'll use try-except blocks around the input conversions.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Invalid input: Please enter numeric values.\")\n    exit()\n```\n\n### Complete Code\n\nPutting it all together, here's the complete code for the simple calculator:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Select operation:\")\nprint(\"1. Addition\")\nprint(\"2. Subtraction\")\nprint(\"3. Multiplication\")\nprint(\"4. Division\")\n\nchoice = input(\"Enter choice (1/2/3/4): \")\n\ntry:\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Invalid input: Please enter numeric values.\")\n    exit()\n\nif choice == '1':\n    result = num1 + num2\n    operation = \"addition\"\nelif choice == '2':\n    result = num1 - num2\n    operation = \"subtraction\"\nelif choice == '3':\n    result = num1 * num2\n    operation = \"multiplication\"\nelif choice == '4':\n    if num2 != 0:\n        result = num1 / num2\n        operation = \"division\"\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\")\n        exit()\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid input\")\n    exit()\n\nprint(f\"Result of {operation}: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Operation Selection:** The user chooses an operation by entering a number (1-4).\n2. **Input Handling:** The program asks for two numbers and converts them to floats. If conversion fails, it handles the `ValueError`.\n3. **Operation Performance:** Based on the choice, it performs the appropriate operation. For division, it checks if the denominator is zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n4. **Result Display:** It prints the result of the operation.\n\nThis simple calculator is a good starting point for understanding basic input handling, conditional logic, and error management in Python."
