        "content": "Let's see. So in this town, 60% of people have dogs, and 40% have cats. But, 20% have both dogs and cats. I need to find out what percentage have neither dogs nor cats.\n\nHmm, I remember something about sets and Venn diagrams for this kind of problem. So, if we have two overlapping circles, one for dog owners and one for cat owners, the overlap is those who have both.\n\nSo, the total percentage who have dogs or cats should be the sum of dog owners and cat owners minus those who have both, right? Because those who have both are counted in both the dog and cat percentages.\n\nSo, that would be 60% + 40% - 20% = 80%.\n\nSo, 80% of people have either dogs or cats or both. Therefore, the percentage who have neither would be 100% - 80% = 20%.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf 60% have dogs and 40% have cats, and 20% have both, then the number of people who have only dogs would be 60% - 20% = 40%, and only cats would be 40% - 20% = 20%. Then, adding up only dogs, only cats, and both: 40% + 20% + 20% = 80%.\n\nSo, yes, 80% have pets, and 20% have neither.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20\\%} \\]"
