It's famous for its canals and gondolas, and it is indeed built on a cluster of islands in a lagoon off the Adriatic Sea. The architecture there is just breathtaking, with all those ornate buildings and bridges. I've always wanted to visit Venice, especially during Carnival when everyone wears those beautiful masks. What about you? Have you ever been to Venice or any other Italian city?"
