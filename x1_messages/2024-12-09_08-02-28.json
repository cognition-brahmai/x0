        "content": "So I have this problem: a printer prints 20 pages in 5 minutes, and I need to figure out how many pages it can print in an hour. Hmm, let's see. First, I need to understand the relationship between the time and the number of pages. It seems like a rate problem, where I have to find out the printing rate and then scale it up to an hour.\n\nOkay, so I know that in 5 minutes, the printer can do 20 pages. I need to find out how many pages it can do in 60 minutes, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. I think the best way to approach this is to first find out how many pages the printer can do per minute, and then multiply that by 60 to get the hourly rate.\n\nSo, pages per minute would be the number of pages divided by the number of minutes. That is, 20 pages divided by 5 minutes, which is 4 pages per minute. Now, if the printer prints 4 pages every minute, then in 60 minutes, it would print 4 pages per minute times 60 minutes, which is 240 pages.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should check if there's another way to think about it. Maybe I can find out how many 5-minute intervals there are in an hour and then multiply that by the number of pages printed in each 5-minute interval.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so divided by 5 minutes per interval, that's 12 intervals. Since each interval produces 20 pages, then 12 intervals times 20 pages would give me 240 pages again. Okay, that matches my first method, which is a good sign.\n\nAnother way to look at it could be using proportions. If 5 minutes corresponds to 20 pages, then 60 minutes would correspond to x pages. So, I can set up a proportion: 5 minutes is to 20 pages as 60 minutes is to x pages. That is, 5/20 = 60/x. Wait, actually, that might not be set up correctly. Let's see.\n\nActually, it should be that the ratio of time to pages is constant. So, time divided by pages is constant. Therefore, 5/x = 60/20, but that doesn't make sense because that would imply that as time increases, the number of pages decreases, which isn't the case. No, I think I need to set it up as pages over time.\n\nSo, pages over time should be constant. That is, 20/5 = x/60. That makes more sense. So, 20 pages in 5 minutes is the same rate as x pages in 60 minutes. Solving for x, I get (20/5) * 60 = 4 * 60 = 240 pages. Again, the same answer.\n\nI feel pretty confident now that 240 pages is the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is the printer's speed constant throughout the hour? Does it slow down over longer periods? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I'll assume the rate is constant.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. I have minutes in both measurements, so that's good. I didn't mix up hours and minutes or anything like that.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there's a maximum capacity or any constraints mentioned, but again, the problem doesn't specify any limits beyond the printing rate, so I'll proceed with the calculation based on the given rate.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the printer can print 240 pages in an hour, given that it prints 20 pages in 5 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
