        "content": "So you've got a water tank that can hold 200 liters, and there's a faucet that fills it up at a rate of 5 liters per minute. You want to know how long it'll take to fill the tank completely, right?\n\nWell, to figure this out, you can think about it like this: if the faucet adds 5 liters every minute, you need to find out how many minutes it takes to reach 200 liters.\n\nSo, you can set up a simple equation. Let's let \\( t \\) be the time in minutes it takes to fill the tank. Since the faucet adds 5 liters per minute, in \\( t \\) minutes, it will add \\( 5 \\times t \\) liters.\n\nYou want that to equal the total capacity of the tank, which is 200 liters. So, the equation is:\n\n\\[ 5t = 200 \\]\n\nNow, to find \\( t \\), you can divide both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{200}{5} \\]\n\nCalculating that gives:\n\n\\[ t = 40 \\]\n\nSo, it will take 40 minutes to fill the tank completely.\n\nBut let's double-check that to make sure. If the faucet adds 5 liters every minute, in 40 minutes it would add:\n\n\\[ 5 \\, \\text{liters.minute} \\times 40 \\, \\text{minutes} = 200 \\, \\text{liters} \\]\n\nYes, that matches the tank's capacity. So, 40 minutes is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, you can think about it in terms of rates. The filling rate is 5 liters per minute, and the total volume is 200 liters. Time is equal to the total volume divided by the rate:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{volume}}{\\text{rate}} = \\frac{200 \\, \\text{liters}}{5 \\, \\text{liters.minute}} = 40 \\, \\text{minutes} \\]\n\nSame answer.\n\nIf you imagine filling the tank in stages, every minute the tank increases by 5 liters. So, after 1 minute, it's at 5 liters, after 2 minutes at 10 liters, and so on, until it reaches 200 liters at 40 minutes.\n\nAnother way to visualize it is to consider how many 5-liter units are there in 200 liters. Well, 200 divided by 5 is 40. So, 40 units of 5 liters each make up 200 liters, and since each unit takes one minute, it takes 40 minutes.\n\nIf you were to plot this on a graph, with time on the x-axis and volume on the y-axis, you'd have a straight line starting at 0, increasing at a slope of 5 liters per minute, and reaching 200 liters at 40 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if the filling rate was different, say 10 liters per minute, then it would take less time. Let's see, 200 divided by 10 is 20 minutes. So, the time is inversely proportional to the rate.\n\nBut in this case, with a rate of 5 liters per minute, it's definitely 40 minutes.\n\nNow, suppose the tank wasn't empty to start with. Let's say it already had 50 liters in it. Then, you'd only need to add 150 liters to fill it up. So, time would be 150 divided by 5, which is 30 minutes.\n\nOr, if the faucet had a variable rate, say it starts at 5 liters per minute and increases over time, then the calculation would be more complex, involving integration or some other method to account for the changing rate.\n\nBut in this straightforward scenario, with a constant rate of 5 liters per minute, filling a 200-liter tank completely from empty takes 40 minutes.\n\nSo, the answer is 40 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
