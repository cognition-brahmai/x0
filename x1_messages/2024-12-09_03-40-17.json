        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here. There's a group of people, and they're categorized based on eye color and whether they wear glasses or not. So, 65% have brown eyes, and 35% have blue eyes. Then, among those with brown eyes, 40% wear glasses, and among those with blue eyes, 20% wear glasses. I need to find out what percentage of the entire group wears glasses.\n\nOkay, first, I should probably figure out how many people in each eye color category wear glasses, and then add those up to get the total percentage for the whole group.\n\nSo, starting with the brown-eyed people. 65% of the group has brown eyes, and 40% of those wear glasses. So, to find out how many brown-eyed people wear glasses, I can multiply 65% by 40%.\n\nLet me calculate that: 65% times 40% is... well, percentages can be tricky, but I remember that to multiply percentages, you multiply the numbers and then divide by 100 to get the actual percentage.\n\nSo, 65 times 40 is 2600, and divided by 100 is 26%. So, 26% of the entire group are brown-eyed people who wear glasses.\n\nNow, for the blue-eyed people. 35% have blue eyes, and 20% of those wear glasses. Again, multiply 35% by 20% to find out how many blue-eyed people wear glasses.\n\n35 times 20 is 700, divided by 100 is 7%. So, 7% of the entire group are blue-eyed people who wear glasses.\n\nNow, to find the total percentage of the group that wears glasses, regardless of eye color, I should add these two percentages together.\n\nSo, 26% plus 7% is 33%.\n\nTherefore, 33% of the entire group wears glasses.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this to confirm? Maybe using fractions or something.\n\nLet me try. Let's assume there are 100 people in the group for simplicity.\n\nSo, 65 people have brown eyes, and 35 have blue eyes.\n\nAmong the brown-eyed people, 40% wear glasses. So, 40% of 65 is... 0.4 times 65 is 26 people.\n\nAmong the blue-eyed people, 20% wear glasses. So, 0.2 times 35 is 7 people.\n\nNow, total number of people who wear glasses is 26 plus 7, which is 33.\n\nSo, in a group of 100 people, 33 wear glasses, which is 33%.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, that makes sense.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using probability or something.\n\nWell, thinking in terms of probability, the probability that a person has brown eyes and wears glasses is 0.65 times 0.40, which is 0.26, or 26%.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that a person has blue eyes and wears glasses is 0.35 times 0.20, which is 0.07, or 7%.\n\nThen, the total probability that a person wears glasses is the sum of these two probabilities, which is 0.26 plus 0.07, equaling 0.33, or 33%.\n\nAgain, the same answer. Seems consistent.\n\nJust to be thorough, are there any other eye colors to consider? The problem only mentions brown and blue eyes, so I'm assuming that's all there is. No mention of other eye colors, so I don't need to account for any other categories.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the percentages add up to 100%, which they do: 65% plus 35% equals 100%.\n\nAnd within each eye color group, the percentages of wearing glasses are given, but it doesn't specify anything about people who don't wear glasses, so I don't need to worry about that for this problem.\n\nSo, in conclusion, 33% of the entire group wears glasses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33\\%} \\]"
