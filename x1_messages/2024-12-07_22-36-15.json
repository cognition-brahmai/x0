        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a restaurant lunch special. It says that the special includes one main dish, one side dish, and one drink. There are 4 choices for the main dish, 3 choices for the side dish, and 2 choices for the drink. The question is asking how many different lunch combinations can be made.\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out the total number of possible combinations when choosing one item from each category: main dish, side dish, and drink. I remember that when you have multiple categories to choose from, and you're picking one item from each category, you can find the total number of combinations by multiplying the number of choices in each category together.\n\nSo, in this case, there are 4 main dishes, 3 side dishes, and 2 drinks. That means the total number of combinations should be 4 times 3 times 2. Let me write that down:\n\nTotal combinations = number of main dishes \u00d7 number of side dishes \u00d7 number of drinks\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal combinations = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2\n\nNow, 4 multiplied by 3 is 12, and 12 multiplied by 2 is 24. So, there should be 24 different lunch combinations possible.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure that I'm understanding this correctly. Is there any chance that some combinations might not be allowed, like certain main dishes not going with certain side dishes? The problem doesn't mention any restrictions, so I think it's safe to assume that all combinations are possible.\n\nAlso, just to double-check, the problem specifies that the lunch special includes one main dish, one side dish, and one drink. So, people have to choose one item from each category. There are no options to choose more or less than that.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list out all the possible combinations. For example, if the main dishes are labeled A, B, C, D, side dishes are 1, 2, 3, and drinks are X, Y, then the combinations would be:\n\nA-1-X, A-1-Y, A-2-X, A-2-Y, A-3-X, A-3-Y\n\nB-1-X, B-1-Y, B-2-X, B-2-Y, B-3-X, B-3-Y\n\nC-1-X, C-1-Y, C-2-X, C-2-Y, C-3-X, C-3-Y\n\nD-1-X, D-1-Y, D-2-X, D-2-Y, D-3-X, D-3-Y\n\nIf I count those up, that's 24 combinations, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. It's a straightforward application of the multiplication principle in combinatorics. As long as there are no restrictions on the choices, multiplying the number of options in each category gives the total number of possible combinations.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 24 different lunch combinations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
