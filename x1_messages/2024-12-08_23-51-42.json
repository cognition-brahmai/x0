It's a spectacular natural wonder carved by the Colorado River over millions of years, attracting millions of visitors each year. Arizona is known for its desert landscapes, cacti, and other natural attractions like the Petrified Forest and Monument Valley, which is also near the Grand Canyon. If you're planning a trip there, make sure to check the weather and plan your activities accordingly, as the canyon can get quite hot during the summer months."
