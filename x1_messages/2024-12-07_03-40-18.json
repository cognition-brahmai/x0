        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a rectangular garden that measures 20 feet by 15 feet, and I need to find out what its area is in square meters. Okay, first things first, I know that area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, in this case, it would be 20 feet times 15 feet. That gives me 300 square feet. But the question wants the answer in square meters, so I need to convert that.\n\nI remember that 1 foot is equal to 0.3048 meters. So, to convert square feet to square meters, I should square that conversion factor because I'm dealing with area, not length. So, (0.3048 meters)^2 equals 0.092903 square meters per square foot. Now, to find the area in square meters, I multiply the area in square feet by this conversion factor.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nArea in square meters = Area in square feet \u00d7 (0.3048 meters)^2\n\nSo, Area in square meters = 300 sq ft \u00d7 0.092903 sq m/sq ft\n\nNow, let me do the math:\n\n300 \u00d7 0.092903 = 27.8709 square meters.\n\nWait, that seems a bit small. Maybe I should check my conversion factor again. I looked it up, and yes, 1 square foot is approximately 0.092903 square meters. So, 300 times that should be 27.8709 square meters.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I can double-check the conversion. Another way to think about it is to convert the lengths to meters first and then multiply them.\n\nSo, first convert the lengths:\n\n20 feet \u00d7 0.3048 meters/foot = 6.096 meters\n\n15 feet \u00d7 0.3048 meters/foot = 4.572 meters\n\nNow, multiply these two to get the area in square meters:\n\n6.096 m \u00d7 4.572 m = let's see, 6.096 \u00d7 4.572.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 6 \u00d7 4.572 is 27.432\n\nThen, 0.096 \u00d7 4.572.\n\nWait, this might take a bit. Maybe I can use a calculator for this part.\n\nAssuming I have a calculator, 6.096 \u00d7 4.572 equals approximately 27.8709 square meters.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the area is approximately 27.87 square meters.\n\nBut, I should consider the significant figures. The original measurements were 20 feet and 15 feet, which are both given to two significant figures. So, the answer should also be reported to two significant figures.\n\n27.87 rounded to two significant figures is 28.\n\nTherefore, the area is approximately 28 square meters.\n\nWait a minute, but the exact calculation gives me 27.8709, which is closer to 28 than to 27. But considering the precision of the conversion factor and the measurements, maybe I should keep more decimal places.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the measurements are exact, and I should report more decimal places.\n\nLet me see: the conversion factor is 0.3048 meters per foot, which is exact, as it's defined that way.\n\nSo, perhaps I can keep more decimal places in my answer.\n\nBut generally, for practical purposes, reporting to two decimal places is sufficient.\n\nSo, 27.87 square meters would be acceptable.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to approach this.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the formula for area conversion directly.\n\nI know that 1 square foot is equal to 0.092903 square meters, so multiplying by 300 should give me the area in square meters.\n\nYes, that's what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, some people might use an approximate conversion factor, like 1 square foot is about 0.093 square meters, but that might not be precise enough.\n\nIt's better to use the exact conversion factor.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the area of the garden is approximately 27.87 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{27.87} \\]"
