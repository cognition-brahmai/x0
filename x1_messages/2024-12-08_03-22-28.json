        "content": "Skunks are known for their unique defense mechanism when they feel threatened. When a skunk perceives a threat, it first tries to escape or hide. If that's not possible, it will try to deter the predator through a series of warning behaviors.\n\nInitially, the skunk may raise its tail, stomp its feet, and chatter or hiss to warn the approaching creature. If the threat continues to advance, the skunk will turn its back and spray a foul-smelling liquid from its anal glands. This liquid can reach up to 10 feet away and is difficult to remove once it's been sprayed.\n\nIt's important to give skunks space and avoid provoking them to prevent getting sprayed. If you encounter a skunk, it's best to slowly back away and avoid direct eye contact, as this can be perceived as a threat."
