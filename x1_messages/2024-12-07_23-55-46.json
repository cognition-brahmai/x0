        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train that's going 60 miles per hour, and it's got a 120-mile journey ahead of it. Halfway through, so at 60 miles, it runs into a problem and has to slow down to 30 miles per hour for the remaining 60 miles. I need to find out how long the whole trip takes.\n\nFirst, I'll think about the first half of the journey. The train is going at 60 miles per hour for 60 miles. Time is distance divided by speed, right? So, time for the first half is 60 miles divided by 60 miles per hour, which is 1 hour.\n\nNow, for the second half, the train slows down to 30 miles per hour for the remaining 60 miles. Again, time is distance divided by speed, so that's 60 miles divided by 30 miles per hour, which is 2 hours.\n\nSo, total time is the time for the first half plus the time for the second half: 1 hour plus 2 hours equals 3 hours. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there anything I'm missing here? The problem says \"halfway through the journey,\" which is clearly 60 miles, since the total journey is 120 miles. And then it reduces speed to 30 miles per hour for the rest of the trip. So, yes, 60 miles at 60 mph and 60 miles at 30 mph.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it in terms of average speed, but I don't think that's necessary here because the speeds are constant for each half of the journey.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the time for each segment separately and then add them up, which is what I did. So, 60 miles at 60 mph takes 1 hour, and 60 miles at 30 mph takes 2 hours, totaling 3 hours.\n\nI guess I can also consider the overall average speed for the entire trip. The total distance is 120 miles, and the total time is 3 hours, so the average speed would be 120 miles divided by 3 hours, which is 40 mph. But again, that's not necessary to answer the question, which is about the total time.\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking this. The problem is pretty straightforward. The train goes half the distance at one speed and the other half at another speed. I've calculated the time for each half and added them up. That should give me the total time.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor that could affect the time, like acceleration or deceleration when the train slows down, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I assume the speed changes instantly.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The speed is given in miles per hour, and the distance in miles, so the time will be in hours, which is fine.\n\nSo, my final answer is 3 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
