        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 7 red balls and 3 green balls in a bag, making a total of 10 balls. I need to find out the probability of picking a red ball twice in a row, with replacement. That means after I pick a ball and look at its color, I put it back into the bag before picking again.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the event is picking a red ball twice in a row. Since the ball is replaced each time, the two picks are independent events. That means the outcome of the first pick doesn't affect the outcome of the second pick.\n\nSo, the probability of both events happening is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nLet me first find the probability of picking a red ball on the first try.\n\nThere are 7 red balls and 10 balls in total, so the probability is 7/10.\n\nSimilarly, since I'm replacing the ball, the probability of picking a red ball on the second try is also 7/10.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both events happening is (7/10) * (7/10) = 49/100.\n\nWait a minute, but probabilities are often expressed as decimals or percentages. 49/100 is 0.49, or 49%.\n\nBut let me double-check if I'm doing this correctly. Is it really independent because of the replacement?\n\nYes, because I'm putting the ball back each time, the total number of balls remains the same for each pick, so the probabilities don't change.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to list all possible outcomes. Each pick has two possibilities: red or green. Since there are two picks, there are four possible outcomes: red-red, red-green, green-red, green-green.\n\nBut since the picks are independent, the probability of each outcome is the product of the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, probability of red-red is (7/10)*(7/10) = 49/100.\n\nProbability of red-green is (7/10)*(3/10) = 21/100.\n\nProbability of green-red is (3/10)*(7/10) = 21/100.\n\nProbability of green-green is (3/10)*(3/10) = 9/100.\n\nIf I add all these up, 49 + 21 + 21 + 9 = 100, which makes sense because they cover all possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the probability of picking two red balls in a row is 49/100, or 0.49, or 49%.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe using combinations or permutations.\n\nWell, since the order matters (we want red first and red second), and it's with replacement, the straightforward probability calculation seems appropriate.\n\nI don't think I need to use combinations here because we're dealing with independent events.\n\nAlternatively, if it was without replacement, the probabilities would change for the second pick, but in this case, it's with replacement, so the probabilities stay the same.\n\nLet me consider if there's any chance of misunderstanding the problem. It says \"pick one ball, look at its color, and then put it back.\" So, replacement is definite.\n\nAlso, it specifies \"twice in a row,\" meaning two consecutive picks, both resulting in red.\n\nSo, my initial approach seems correct.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I'll calculate it another way.\n\nLet me think in terms of percentages.\n\nFirst pick: 70% chance of red.\n\nSecond pick: again 70% chance of red.\n\nSo, 70% of 70% is 49%.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, in decimal form: 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.49.\n\nSame result.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 49%.\n\nBut in fraction form, it's 49/100, which can't be simplified further.\n\nSo, the final answer is 49/100 or 0.49 or 49%.\n\nI think that's clear and correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{49}{100}} \\]"
