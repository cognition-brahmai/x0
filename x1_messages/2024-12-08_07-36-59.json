        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden that's 12 meters long and 8 meters wide, and I need to figure out how much fencing is required to go around it. Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides. So, the lengths are both 12 meters, and the widths are both 8 meters. To find the total amount of fencing needed, I think I need to calculate the perimeter of the garden. The perimeter is the total distance around the shape.\n\nI recall that the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width. Let me plug in the values here.\n\nSo, L is 12 meters and W is 8 meters. Plugging those into the formula:\n\nP = 2(12) + 2(8)\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication:\n\n2 times 12 is 24, and 2 times 8 is 16.\n\nSo, P = 24 + 16.\n\nAdding those together gives me 40.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter is 40 meters.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf I imagine walking around the garden, I'd walk 12 meters along one length, then 8 meters along one width, then another 12 meters along the other length, and finally 8 meters along the other width. So, 12 + 8 + 12 + 8 should equal 40 meters.\n\nLet me add that up: 12 plus 8 is 20, plus another 12 is 32, plus 8 is 40 meters. Yeah, that matches what I got using the formula.\n\nSo, it seems like I need 40 meters of fencing to go around the garden.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to look at this. Maybe using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle isn't the only way.\n\nLet's see, another way could be to add the lengths and widths separately and then multiply by 2.\n\nSo, the total of one length and one width is 12 + 8, which is 20 meters. Then, since there are two such pairs, 2 times 20 is 40 meters. Again, 40 meters.\n\nOr, maybe I can think of it in terms of area, but I don't think that's relevant here because fencing is about the perimeter, not the area.\n\nWait, actually, area is something different. Area is length times width, which would be 12 times 8, that's 96 square meters. But that's not helpful for fencing, which is about the boundary.\n\nSo, sticking with the perimeter calculation.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? For example, does the fence need to be built at a certain height or is there any overlapping at the corners? But I think the problem is straightforward, just asking for the perimeter.\n\nAlright, I think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
