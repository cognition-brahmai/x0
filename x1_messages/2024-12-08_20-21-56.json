        "content": "So there's this problem about two trains leaving from different towns and heading towards each other. Town A and Town B are 210 miles apart. One train leaves Town A going at 60 miles per hour, and the other leaves Town B going at 80 miles per hour. I need to figure out how long it takes for them to meet.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the situation. I have Town A and Town B, 210 miles apart. Train A is going from A to B at 60 mph, and Train B is going from B to A at 80 mph. They're moving towards each other, so their speeds add up when calculating how quickly they'll meet.\n\nSo, the combined speed is 60 mph + 80 mph = 140 mph. That means together, they're closing the distance between them at a rate of 140 miles per hour.\n\nNow, to find out how long it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nHere, the distance is 210 miles, and the combined speed is 140 mph.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTime = 210 miles / 140 mph\n\nLet me calculate that. 210 divided by 140 is 1.5 hours.\n\nSo, it should take 1.5 hours for the two trains to meet.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the time it takes for both trains to cover the entire distance together. Since they're moving towards each other, the time should be the same for both trains until they meet.\n\nLet's denote the time as t hours.\n\nIn t hours, Train A would have traveled 60t miles (since distance = speed \u00d7 time).\n\nSimilarly, Train B would have traveled 80t miles.\n\nWhen they meet, the sum of the distances they've traveled should equal the total distance between the towns, which is 210 miles.\n\nSo, 60t + 80t = 210\n\nCombining like terms, 140t = 210\n\nNow, solving for t: t = 210 / 140 = 1.5 hours\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how each train is moving towards the other, reducing the distance between them at a rate of 140 mph, and again, time = distance / speed, which is 210 / 140 = 1.5 hours.\n\nI think it's consistent across different methods, so I'm confident that the answer is 1.5 hours.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if the trains are moving on the same track or if there's any other factor I'm missing, but based on the problem, it seems straightforward.\n\nTwo trains leaving at the same time from different places, heading towards each other, with given speeds, and a fixed distance between the towns.\n\nSo, no need to worry about directions or anything like that.\n\nTherefore, the time it takes for them to meet is 1.5 hours.\n\nThat seems pretty straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
