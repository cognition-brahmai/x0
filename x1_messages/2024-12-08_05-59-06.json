        "content": "So, the train goes from Town A to Town B, which are 120 miles apart, and it takes 2 hours to do that. Then it comes back to Town A right away without stopping or changing speed. I need to find out how long the whole round trip takes.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the speed of the train. Since it covers 120 miles in 2 hours, I can calculate the speed by dividing the distance by the time. So, speed equals distance divided by time, right?\n\nSo, speed = 120 miles / 2 hours = 60 miles per hour.\n\nAlright, so the train is moving at 60 miles per hour.\n\nNow, it has to go from Town A to Town B and then back to Town A. That means it's traveling the distance twice: once to Town B and once back to Town A.\n\nSo, total distance for the round trip is 120 miles + 120 miles = 240 miles.\n\nSince the train is moving at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, I can find the total time by dividing the total distance by the speed.\n\nSo, total time = total distance / speed = 240 miles / 60 miles per hour = 4 hours.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, since each leg of the trip takes 2 hours, and there are two legs, the total time would be 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think that's the answer: it takes 4 hours for the train to travel from Town A to Town B and back again.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
