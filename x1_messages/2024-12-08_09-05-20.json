        "content": "So, I've got this problem here: If a car uses 8 gallons of gas to travel 240 miles, how many miles can it travel with 15 gallons of gas? Hmm, this seems like a straightforward problem involving proportions. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many miles the car can travel per gallon of gas. If 8 gallons allow for 240 miles, then the miles per gallon (mpg) would be 240 miles divided by 8 gallons. So, that's 240 \u00f7 8 = 30 mpg. Okay, so the car gets 30 miles per gallon.\n\nNow, if the car gets 30 miles per gallon, and I have 15 gallons of gas, then the total miles it can travel would be 30 mpg multiplied by 15 gallons. That should be 30 \u00d7 15. Let's see, 30 times 10 is 300, and 30 times 5 is 150, so altogether that's 300 + 150 = 450 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this to confirm? Maybe using proportions directly. If 8 gallons correspond to 240 miles, then 15 gallons correspond to x miles. So, I can set up a proportion: 8 gallons / 240 miles = 15 gallons / x miles. Wait, actually, that might not be correct. Let's see.\n\nActually, it should be: gallons/miles = gallons/miles, so 8/240 = 15/x. But I think it's better to keep it as miles per gallon for clarity. So, miles per gallon is 240/8 = 30 mpg, and then 30 mpg times 15 gallons = 450 miles. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of unit rates. The car travels 240 miles on 8 gallons, so the rate is 240 miles per 8 gallons. Simplifying that, it's 30 miles per gallon. Then, for 15 gallons, it would be 30 miles/gallon \u00d7 15 gallons = 450 miles. Same answer.\n\nLet me try another approach to be extra sure. If 8 gallons allow for 240 miles, then each gallon allows for 240 \u00f7 8 = 30 miles, as before. So, with 15 gallons, it should be 15 times 30, which is 450 miles.\n\nAlternatively, I could use cross-multiplication for the proportion. If 8 gallons correspond to 240 miles, then 15 gallons correspond to x miles. So, 8/240 = 15/x. Wait, actually, that's not setting up the proportion correctly. It should be gallons to miles, so perhaps it's better to keep it as miles per gallon.\n\nLet me set it up again: If 8 gallons allow for 240 miles, then the ratio is 8 gallons to 240 miles, which is a 1:30 ratio per gallon. So, for each gallon, the car can travel 30 miles. Therefore, with 15 gallons, it's 15 times 30, which is 450 miles.\n\nAnother way: maybe using the concept of direct variation. In direct variation, if one quantity increases, the other increases proportionally. Here, as the number of gallons increases, the miles the car can travel also increases proportionally. So, setting up a proportion: 240 miles / 8 gallons = x miles / 15 gallons.\n\nSo, 240/8 = x/15. Simplifying 240 \u00f7 8 is 30, so 30 = x/15. Then, solving for x, x = 30 \u00d7 15 = 450 miles. Again, the same answer.\n\nLet me check if there's any other way to approach this. Perhaps using dimensional analysis. Starting with 15 gallons, and knowing that the car gets 30 miles per gallon, I can multiply 15 gallons by 30 miles per gallon. The gallons unit cancels out, leaving miles: 15 gallons \u00d7 30 miles/gallon = 450 miles. Perfect, consistent with previous results.\n\nIs there any chance that the answer could be different? Maybe if the car's mileage changes with the amount of gas, but the problem doesn't suggest that. It seems to assume a constant mileage rate. So, I think 450 miles is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any trick here that I'm missing. Perhaps the car has a tank capacity limitation, but again, the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the units more carefully. 8 gallons for 240 miles means 240 miles per 8 gallons, which is 30 miles per gallon. Then, 30 miles per gallon times 15 gallons equals 450 miles. Units check out.\n\nAnother angle: if I were to graph this on a miles versus gallons graph, the slope would be miles per gallon, which is 30. So, for 15 gallons, the miles would be 30 times 15, which is 450.\n\nI think I've confirmed this enough ways. The answer should be 450 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{450} \\]"
