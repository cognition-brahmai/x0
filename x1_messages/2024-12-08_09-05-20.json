        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 30 people in a group: 18 with brown eyes, 10 with green eyes, and 2 with blue eyes. I need to find the probability that none of the 4 people chosen at random have blue eyes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of ways to choose 4 people out of 30. That sounds like a combination problem because the order in which we select the people doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 4 people out of 30 is:\n\n\\[\nC(30, 4) = \\frac{30!}{4!(30 - 4)!} = \\frac{30!}{4! \\cdot 26!}\n\\]\n\nI don't need to calculate this fully right now, but I'll keep it in mind.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to choose 4 people who do not have blue eyes. There are 2 people with blue eyes, which means there are 30 - 2 = 28 people without blue eyes.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 4 people from these 28 is:\n\n\\[\nC(28, 4) = \\frac{28!}{4!(28 - 4)!} = \\frac{28!}{4! \\cdot 24!}\n\\]\n\nAgain, I'll leave it in this form for now.\n\nThe probability that none of the 4 chosen people have blue eyes is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (choosing 4 without blue eyes) to the total number of possible outcomes (choosing any 4 from 30). So, the probability \\( P \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{C(28, 4)}{C(30, 4)}\n\\]\n\nNow, I can simplify this expression. Let's write out the combinations:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\frac{28!}{4! \\cdot 24!}}{\\frac{30!}{4! \\cdot 26!}} = \\frac{28! \\cdot 4! \\cdot 26!}{4! \\cdot 24! \\cdot 30!}\n\\]\n\nI see that \\( 4! \\) appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so they cancel out:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{28! \\cdot 26!}{24! \\cdot 30!}\n\\]\n\nNext, I can express \\( 28! \\) as \\( 28 \\times 27 \\times 26! \\), which allows me to cancel out \\( 26! \\) in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{28 \\times 27 \\times 26! \\cdot 26!}{24! \\cdot 30 \\times 29 \\times 28 \\times 27 \\times 26!}\n\\]\n\nWait, that seems messy. Let me try a different approach.\n\nI know that:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-k+1)}{k!}\n\\]\n\nSo, for \\( C(28, 4) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(28, 4) = \\frac{28 \\times 27 \\times 26 \\times 25}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{28 \\times 27 \\times 26 \\times 25}{24}\n\\]\n\nAnd for \\( C(30, 4) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(30, 4) = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28 \\times 27}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28 \\times 27}{24}\n\\]\n\nNow, the probability \\( P \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{C(28, 4)}{C(30, 4)} = \\frac{\\frac{28 \\times 27 \\times 26 \\times 25}{24}}{\\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28 \\times 27}{24}} = \\frac{28 \\times 27 \\times 26 \\times 25}{30 \\times 29 \\times 28 \\times 27}\n\\]\n\nI can cancel out \\( 28 \\) and \\( 27 \\) from the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{26 \\times 25}{30 \\times 29} = \\frac{650}{870}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 10:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{65}{87}\n\\]\n\nBut I can check if this is the simplest form. Let's see if 65 and 87 have any common factors. 65 is 5 times 13, and 87 is 3 times 29. No common factors, so \\( \\frac{65}{87} \\) is the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate this probability step by step using the concept of conditional probability.\n\nThe probability that the first person chosen does not have blue eyes is \\( \\frac{28}{30} \\), since there are 28 without blue eyes out of 30.\n\nGiven that the first person doesn't have blue eyes, there are now 27 without blue eyes left out of the remaining 29 people. So, the probability that the second person also doesn't have blue eyes is \\( \\frac{27}{29} \\).\n\nSimilarly, the probability that the third person doesn't have blue eyes is \\( \\frac{26}{28} \\), and for the fourth person, it's \\( \\frac{25}{27} \\).\n\nSo, the overall probability is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{28}{30} \\times \\frac{27}{29} \\times \\frac{26}{28} \\times \\frac{25}{27} = \\frac{28 \\times 27 \\times 26 \\times 25}{30 \\times 29 \\times 28 \\times 27} = \\frac{26 \\times 25}{30 \\times 29} = \\frac{650}{870} = \\frac{65}{87}\n\\]\n\nThis matches the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of hypergeometric distribution, which deals with sampling without replacement.\n\nThe formula for the hypergeometric distribution is:\n\n\\[\nP(X = k) = \\frac{C(K, k) \\times C(N - K, n - k)}{C(N, n)}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( N \\) is the population size (30 people),\n\n- \\( K \\) is the number of success states in the population (28 without blue eyes),\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of draws (4 people),\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of observed successes (4 without blue eyes).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nP(X = 4) = \\frac{C(28, 4) \\times C(2, 0)}{C(30, 4)} = \\frac{C(28, 4) \\times 1}{C(30, 4)} = \\frac{C(28, 4)}{C(30, 4)}\n\\]\n\nwhich is the same as what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the probability is \\( \\frac{65}{87} \\), which is approximately 0.7471, or 74.71%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{28 \\times 27 \\times 26 \\times 25}{30 \\times 29 \\times 28 \\times 27} = \\frac{26 \\times 25}{30 \\times 29} = \\frac{650}{870} = \\frac{65}{87}\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate it step by step:\n\nFirst, \\( \\frac{28}{30} = \\frac{14}{15} \\)\n\nThen, \\( \\frac{14}{15} \\times \\frac{27}{29} = \\frac{14 \\times 27}{15 \\times 29} = \\frac{378}{435} \\)\n\nNext, \\( \\frac{378}{435} \\times \\frac{26}{28} = \\frac{378 \\times 26}{435 \\times 28} = \\frac{9828}{12180} \\)\n\nSimplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 12:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9828 \\div 12}{12180 \\div 12} = \\frac{819}{1015}\n\\]\n\nWait, this doesn't match \\( \\frac{65}{87} \\). Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me try again.\n\nStarting with \\( \\frac{14}{15} \\times \\frac{27}{29} = \\frac{14 \\times 27}{15 \\times 29} = \\frac{378}{435} \\)\n\nSimplify \\( \\frac{378}{435} \\) by dividing numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{378 \\div 3}{435 \\div 3} = \\frac{126}{145}\n\\]\n\nThen, \\( \\frac{126}{145} \\times \\frac{26}{28} = \\frac{126 \\times 26}{145 \\times 28} = \\frac{3276}{4060} \\)\n\nSimplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3276 \\div 4}{4060 \\div 4} = \\frac{819}{1015}\n\\]\n\nWait, this still doesn't match \\( \\frac{65}{87} \\). Maybe I made a mistake in the initial simplification.\n\nLet me try to calculate \\( \\frac{26 \\times 25}{30 \\times 29} \\) directly.\n\nFirst, \\( 26 \\times 25 = 650 \\)\n\nThen, \\( 30 \\times 29 = 870 \\)\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{650}{870} = \\frac{65}{87} \\)\n\nBut according to this step-by-step approach, I'm getting \\( \\frac{819}{1015} \\), which doesn't equal \\( \\frac{65}{87} \\). Let me check if these two fractions are equivalent.\n\nTo check if \\( \\frac{65}{87} = \\frac{819}{1015} \\), cross-multiplying should give equal products.\n\n\\( 65 \\times 1015 = 65975 \\)\n\n\\( 87 \\times 819 = 71253 \\)\n\nThese are not equal, so there must be a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step multiplication.\n\nLet me recalculate \\( \\frac{14}{15} \\times \\frac{27}{29} \\times \\frac{26}{28} \\times \\frac{25}{27} \\)\n\nFirst, \\( \\frac{14}{15} \\times \\frac{27}{29} = \\frac{14 \\times 27}{15 \\times 29} = \\frac{378}{435} \\)\n\nSimplify \\( \\frac{378}{435} \\) by dividing numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{378 \\div 3}{435 \\div 3} = \\frac{126}{145}\n\\]\n\nNext, \\( \\frac{126}{145} \\times \\frac{26}{28} = \\frac{126 \\times 26}{145 \\times 28} = \\frac{3276}{4060} \\)\n\nSimplify \\( \\frac{3276}{4060} \\) by dividing numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3276 \\div 4}{4060 \\div 4} = \\frac{819}{1015}\n\\]\n\nThen, \\( \\frac{819}{1015} \\times \\frac{25}{27} = \\frac{819 \\times 25}{1015 \\times 27} = \\frac{20475}{27405} \\)\n\nSimplify \\( \\frac{20475}{27405} \\) by dividing numerator and denominator by 15:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20475 \\div 15}{27405 \\div 15} = \\frac{1365}{1827}\n\\]\n\nThis still doesn't seem right, and it's getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the combination formula again.\n\nTotal ways to choose 4 people out of 30: \\( C(30, 4) = \\frac{30!}{4! \\cdot 26!} = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28 \\times 27}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{657720}{24} = 27405 \\)\n\nWays to choose 4 people out of 28 without blue eyes: \\( C(28, 4) = \\frac{28!}{4! \\cdot 24!} = \\frac{28 \\times 27 \\times 26 \\times 25}{24} = \\frac{491400}{24} = 20475 \\)\n\nTherefore, the probability is \\( P = \\frac{20475}{27405} \\)\n\nSimplify this fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 15:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20475 \\div 15}{27405 \\div 15} = \\frac{1365}{1827}\n\\]\n\nAgain, this doesn't match \\( \\frac{65}{87} \\). Maybe I made a mistake in the initial simplification.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to simplify \\( \\frac{1365}{1827} \\) further.\n\nLet's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1365 and 1827.\n\nFirst, find the GCD of 1365 and 1827.\n\n1827 divided by 1365 is 1 with a remainder of 462.\n\n1365 divided by 462 is 2 with a remainder of 441.\n\n462 divided by 441 is 1 with a remainder of 21.\n\n441 divided by 21 is 21 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSo, the GCD is 21.\n\nTherefore, \\( \\frac{1365 \\div 21}{1827 \\div 21} = \\frac{65}{87} \\)\n\nSo, indeed, \\( \\frac{1365}{1827} = \\frac{65}{87} \\)\n\nTherefore, the probability is \\( \\frac{65}{87} \\), or approximately 0.7471, which is 74.71%.\n\nWait, but earlier I had a discrepancy in the step-by-step multiplication approach. Maybe I need to re-examine that.\n\nStarting with \\( \\frac{28}{30} \\times \\frac{27}{29} \\times \\frac{26}{28} \\times \\frac{25}{27} \\)\n\nFirst, \\( \\frac{28}{30} = \\frac{14}{15} \\)\n\nThen, \\( \\frac{14}{15} \\times \\frac{27}{29} = \\frac{14 \\times 27}{15 \\times 29} = \\frac{378}{435} \\)\n\nSimplify \\( \\frac{378}{435} \\) by dividing numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{378 \\div 3}{435 \\div 3} = \\frac{126}{145}\n\\]\n\nNext, \\( \\frac{126}{145} \\times \\frac{26}{28} = \\frac{126 \\times 26}{145 \\times 28} = \\frac{3276}{4060} \\)\n\nSimplify \\( \\frac{3276}{4060} \\) by dividing numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3276 \\div 4}{4060 \\div 4} = \\frac{819}{1015}\n\\]\n\nThen, \\( \\frac{819}{1015} \\times \\frac{25}{27} = \\frac{819 \\times 25}{1015 \\times 27} = \\frac{20475}{27405} \\)\n\nSimplify \\( \\frac{20475}{27405} \\) by dividing numerator and denominator by 15:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20475 \\div 15}{27405 \\div 15} = \\frac{1365}{1827}\n\\]\n\nAs before, simplifying \\( \\frac{1365}{1827} \\) by dividing numerator and denominator by 21:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1365 \\div 21}{1827 \\div 21} = \\frac{65}{87}\n\\]\n\nSo, finally, I arrive at \\( \\frac{65}{87} \\), which matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the probability that none of the 4 chosen people have blue eyes is \\( \\frac{65}{87} \\), or approximately 74.71%.\n\nThis makes sense because there are only 2 people with blue eyes in a group of 30, so the probability of not selecting any blue-eyed people in a sample of 4 should be fairly high.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{65}{87}} \\]"
