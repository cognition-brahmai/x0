        "content": "The white substance in a boiled egg is called the albumen or the egg white. It is primarily composed of water (about 88%) and proteins (around 10%), with small amounts of vitamins, minerals, and carbohydrates. The main protein in the egg white is ovalbumin, which makes up about 54% of the total protein content.\n\nWhen an egg is boiled, the heat causes the proteins in the albumen to denature and coagulate, turning from a clear, liquid state to the familiar white, opaque solid. This process is what turns the egg white from runny to firm.\n\nSometimes, you might see different shades or textures in the cooked egg white, which can be due to various factors such as the freshness of the egg, the cooking time, and the temperature at which it was cooked. For example, a very fresh egg will have a more concentrated and dense white, while older eggs might have more runny whites due to increased alkalinity over time.\n\nIt's worth noting that the egg yolk, which is the yellow part, contains fat, cholesterol, and a significant portion of the egg's nutrients, including vitamins and minerals. The yolk is suspended in the egg white by strings of protein called chalazae, which are also visible in raw eggs.\n\nIn culinary terms, egg whites are valued for their ability to froth and foam when beaten, which is utilized in dishes like meringues, souffl\u00e9s, and angel food cakes. They are also a popular ingredient in bodybuilding and fitness circles due to their high protein content and low fat and calorie levels.\n\nFrom a nutritional perspective, egg whites are a low-calorie source of protein, containing about 4 calories per gram of protein. They are also rich in essential amino acids, making them a complete protein source. However, they lack the fat-soluble vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids present in the yolk.\n\nIn summary, the white substance in a boiled egg is the albumen or egg white, which is primarily composed of water and proteins, and undergoes structural changes when heated, transforming from a liquid to a solid state."
