While REM sleep is often associated with more vivid and story-like dreams, dreams can also occur during non-REM (NREM) stages, particularly in stages 2 and 3.\n\nIn NREM sleep, dreams tend to be shorter, less frequent, and less vivid compared to REM dreams. They may involve simpler thoughts or feelings rather than complex narratives.\n\nREM sleep is characterized by high brain activity similar to wakefulness, and this is when most vivid dreaming occurs. However, dreams in NREM sleep are also a normal part of the sleep cycle.\n\nSo, while REM sleep is strongly linked with dreaming, it's not the only stage where dreaming happens."
