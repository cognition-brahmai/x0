It's famous for its stunning sunsets and whitewashed buildings, but it also has a significant historical background due to a massive volcanic eruption that occurred around 1600 B.C. This event is thought to have had widespread effects on the region and may have contributed to the decline of the Minoan civilization. The island is indeed also known as Thera, and the eruption is often referred to as the Minoan eruption or the Theran eruption. It's a fascinating piece of geological and historical trivia!"
