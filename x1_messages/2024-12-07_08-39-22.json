        "content": "So I've got this problem here. It says that a tank contains a mixture of water and alcohol in the ratio of 5:3. There are 120 liters of alcohol in the tank, and I need to find out how much water there is and what the total capacity of the tank is.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the ratio. The ratio of water to alcohol is 5:3, which means that for every 5 parts of water, there are 3 parts of alcohol. So, the total parts in the mixture are 5 + 3 = 8 parts.\n\nNow, I know that the alcohol is 3 parts of the total 8 parts, and it's given that alcohol is 120 liters. So, I can set up a proportion to find out what one part is and then find out how much water is there.\n\nLet's denote one part as x liters. Then, alcohol, which is 3 parts, would be 3x liters. According to the problem, 3x = 120 liters. So, I can solve for x:\n\n3x = 120\n\nx = 120 / 3\n\nx = 40 liters\n\nNow that I know one part is 40 liters, I can find out how much water there is. Since water is 5 parts, it would be:\n\nWater = 5x = 5 * 40 = 200 liters\n\nSo, there are 200 liters of water in the tank.\n\nNext, I need to find the total capacity of the tank. The total mixture is water plus alcohol, which is 5 parts + 3 parts = 8 parts. Since one part is 40 liters, the total capacity is:\n\nTotal capacity = 8x = 8 * 40 = 320 liters\n\nAlternatively, I can add the volumes of water and alcohol:\n\nTotal capacity = water + alcohol = 200 + 120 = 320 liters\n\nEither way, I get the same answer.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Water: 200 liters\n\n- Total capacity: 320 liters\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nStarting with the ratio 5:3, total parts are 8.\n\nGiven alcohol is 3 parts equals 120 liters.\n\nSo, one part is 120 / 3 = 40 liters.\n\nThen, water is 5 parts: 5 * 40 = 200 liters.\n\nTotal capacity: 8 * 40 = 320 liters or 200 + 120 = 320 liters.\n\nEverything checks out. I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200 \\text{ liters of water and a total capacity of } 320 \\text{ liters}} \\]\n"
