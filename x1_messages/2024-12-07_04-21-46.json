Salaries:\n\n   \\[ \\text{Salaries} = 30\\% \\times \\$10,000,000 = 0.30 \\times \\$10,000,000 = \\$3,000,000 \\]\n\n2. Rent:\n\n   \\[ \\text{Rent} = 20\\% \\times \\$10,000,000 = 0.20 \\times \\$10,000,000 = \\$2,000,000 \\]\n\n3. Marketing:\n\n   \\[ \\text{Marketing} = 15\\% \\times \\$10,000,000 = 0.15 \\times \\$10,000,000 = \\$1,500,000 \\]\n\nNext, sum up all the expenses:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total expenses} = \\$3,000,000 + \\$2,000,000 + \\$1,500,000 = \\$6,500,000 \\]\n\nNow, subtract the total expenses from the revenue to find the profit:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Total expenses} = \\$10,000,000 - \\$6,500,000 = \\$3,500,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the company makes a profit of \\$3,500,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3500000} \\]\n"
