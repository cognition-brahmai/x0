        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to choose a committee of 4 people from a group of 10, but there are two specific individuals who can't both be on the committee. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that choosing a committee is basically a combination problem, since the order doesn't matter. The total number of ways to choose 4 people from 10 without any restrictions is given by the combination formula \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of people, and \\( k \\) is the number of people to choose. So, total ways without restrictions would be \\( C(10, 4) \\).\n\nLet me calculate that: \\( C(10, 4) = \\frac{10!}{4! \\times 6!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 210 \\). So, there are 210 possible ways without any restrictions.\n\nNow, there are two specific individuals who can't both be on the committee. Let's call them Person A and Person B. So, the committees where both A and B are included are the ones we need to exclude from the total.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many committees include both A and B. If both A and B are already chosen, then we need to choose 2 more people from the remaining 8 people (since 10 - 2 = 8).\n\nSo, the number of committees with both A and B is \\( C(8, 2) \\).\n\nCalculating that: \\( C(8, 2) = \\frac{8!}{2! \\times 6!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28 \\).\n\nTherefore, there are 28 committees that include both A and B.\n\nTo find the number of acceptable committees, we need to subtract these 28 from the total of 210.\n\nSo, \\( 210 - 28 = 182 \\).\n\nWait a minute, is that all? Let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to consider the different scenarios:\n\n1. Neither A nor B is on the committee.\n\n2. Only A is on the committee.\n\n3. Only B is on the committee.\n\nWe need to add up the number of committees in these three scenarios.\n\nFirst, neither A nor B is on the committee. So, we're choosing all 4 people from the remaining 8 people.\n\nThat's \\( C(8, 4) \\).\n\nCalculating: \\( C(8, 4) = \\frac{8!}{4! \\times 4!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 70 \\).\n\nSecond, only A is on the committee. So, we choose A, and then choose 3 more people from the remaining 8 (excluding B).\n\nThat's \\( C(8, 3) \\).\n\nCalculating: \\( C(8, 3) = \\frac{8!}{3! \\times 5!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56 \\).\n\nSimilarly, only B is on the committee. We choose B and then choose 3 more from the remaining 8 (excluding A).\n\nAgain, that's \\( C(8, 3) = 56 \\).\n\nSo, total acceptable committees are \\( 70 + 56 + 56 = 182 \\).\n\nWait, that's the same answer I got earlier by subtracting the unacceptable committees.\n\nSo, both methods give me 182.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this to confirm?\n\nLet me consider that in total, there are 210 possible committees, and 28 of them include both A and B. So, the number of committees where A and B are not both included is indeed 210 - 28 = 182.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the total number of committees minus the committees where both A and B are included.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nTotal committees: \\( C(10, 4) = 210 \\).\n\nCommittees with both A and B: \\( C(8, 2) = 28 \\).\n\nSo, acceptable committees: total minus both A and B = 210 - 28 = 182.\n\nSeems solid.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of cases:\n\nCase 1: Neither A nor B is chosen.\n\nNumber of ways: \\( C(8, 4) = 70 \\).\n\nCase 2: A is chosen, but B is not.\n\nNumber of ways: \\( C(8, 3) = 56 \\).\n\nCase 3: B is chosen, but A is not.\n\nNumber of ways: \\( C(8, 3) = 56 \\).\n\nTotal acceptable committees: 70 + 56 + 56 = 182.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think 182 is the correct number of ways to choose the committee under the given restriction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{182} \\]"
