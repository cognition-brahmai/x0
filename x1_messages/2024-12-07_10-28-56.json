This function is designed to help users locate files by converting their query into a series of search terms and filters, which aligns perfectly with the user's need to find documents based on specific keywords and a date range.\n\n### Selected Function and Parameters\n\n- **Function**: `file_search`\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `keywords`: [\"climate change\"]\n  - `date_range`:\n    - `start`: \"2010-01-01\"\n    - `end`: \"2020-12-31\"\n\n### JSON Response\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"file_search\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"keywords\": [\"climate change\"],\n    \"date_range\": {\n      \"start\": \"2010-01-01\",\n      \"end\": \"2020-12-31\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Function Selection**:\n   - `file_search` is chosen because it directly addresses the user's need to search for files based on specific keywords and a date range.\n\n2. **Parameters**:\n   - **keywords**: The user's query mentions \"climate change,\" so this is included as the primary search term.\n   - **date_range**: The user specified the publication years between 2010 and 2020. To cover the entire decade accurately, the date range is set from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020.\n\nThis approach ensures that the search is both precise and comprehensive, targeting documents that are relevant to the user's query in terms of content and publication date."
