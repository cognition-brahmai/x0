Nocturnal noises need not negate our notion of nature's nobility. Notably, nettles nodded, notifying nearby nymphs, notifying them of nature's next nocturnal nudges. Nationally, nature's needs necessitate our notice, our nurture, our nourishment. Never neglect nature's narrative; it's a never-ending, necessary, nourishing nectar for our existence."
