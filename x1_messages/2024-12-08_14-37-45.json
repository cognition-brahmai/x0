        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of widgets: X and Y. The cost to produce one unit of X is $12, and for Y, it's $8. The store plans to produce a total of 500 widgets, and the total production cost should be $5,200. We need to find out how many units of each widget to produce.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of widget X produced as \\( x \\) and the number of widget Y produced as \\( y \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of widgets is 500.\n\n2. The total production cost is $5,200.\n\nSo, we can write these as equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 500 \\)  (total units)\n\n2. \\( 12x + 8y = 5200 \\)  (total cost)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nOne way to solve this is by using the substitution method. Let's solve the first equation for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 500 - y \\)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 12(500 - y) + 8y = 5200 \\)\n\nLet's expand this:\n\n\\( 6000 - 12y + 8y = 5200 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 6000 - 4y = 5200 \\)\n\nNow, let's isolate \\( y \\):\n\nSubtract 6000 from both sides:\n\n\\( -4y = -800 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by -4:\n\n\\( y = 200 \\)\n\nNow that we have \\( y \\), we can find \\( x \\) using the first equation:\n\n\\( x = 500 - 200 = 300 \\)\n\nSo, the store should produce 300 units of widget X and 200 units of widget Y.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it adds up.\n\nFirst, total units: \\( 300 + 200 = 500 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTotal cost: \\( (300 \\times 12) + (200 \\times 8) = 3600 + 1600 = 5200 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything looks correct. This seems to be the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe store should produce \\boxed{300} units of widget X and \\boxed{200} units of widget Y."
