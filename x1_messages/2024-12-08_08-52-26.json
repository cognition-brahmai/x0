        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a town with 100 houses, and each house has either cats or dogs as pets. No house has both, right? Because it says \"either cats or dogs.\" So, it's exclusive.\n\nNow, each cat owner has exactly 3 cats, and each dog owner has exactly 4 dogs. And the total number of pets in the town is 280. We need to find out how many houses have cats.\n\nLet me try to set this up with some variables. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( c \\) be the number of houses with cats.\n\n- Let \\( d \\) be the number of houses with dogs.\n\nSince there are 100 houses in total, we can write:\n\n\\[ c + d = 100 \\]\n\nNow, each cat house has 3 cats, so the total number of cats is \\( 3c \\). Each dog house has 4 dogs, so the total number of dogs is \\( 4d \\). The total number of pets is 280, so:\n\n\\[ 3c + 4d = 280 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\( c + d = 100 \\)\n\n2. \\( 3c + 4d = 280 \\)\n\nI need to solve for \\( c \\) and \\( d \\). Let's see. I can use the first equation to express \\( d \\) in terms of \\( c \\):\n\n\\[ d = 100 - c \\]\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 3c + 4(100 - c) = 280 \\]\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n\\[ 3c + 400 - 4c = 280 \\]\n\n\\[ -c + 400 = 280 \\]\n\n\\[ -c = 280 - 400 \\]\n\n\\[ -c = -120 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 120 \\]\n\nWait a minute, that can't be right. If \\( c = 120 \\), but there are only 100 houses in total, that doesn't make sense. Something went wrong here.\n\nLet me check my equations again. The first equation is \\( c + d = 100 \\), which seems correct. The second equation is \\( 3c + 4d = 280 \\), which also seems correct. Let's try solving it again.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[ c + d = 100 \\]\n\n\\[ 3c + 4d = 280 \\]\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( d = 100 - c \\). Plugging that into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 3c + 4(100 - c) = 280 \\]\n\n\\[ 3c + 400 - 4c = 280 \\]\n\n\\[ -c + 400 = 280 \\]\n\n\\[ -c = 280 - 400 \\]\n\n\\[ -c = -120 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 120 \\]\n\nHmm, I'm getting the same answer again. But 120 houses with cats would mean that there are more houses with cats than the total number of houses. That can't be possible. Maybe there's a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe some houses have cats and some have dogs, but perhaps not every house has pets. Wait, no, the problem says every house has either cats or dogs as pets. So, every house has at least one pet, either a cat or a dog.\n\nBut according to the equations, if \\( c = 120 \\), and \\( d = 100 - c = -20 \\), which doesn't make sense because the number of houses can't be negative.\n\nThis suggests that there's no solution to the problem as stated, which is odd. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"In a town, there are 100 houses. Every house has either cats or dogs as pets. If each cat owner has exactly 3 cats and each dog owner has exactly 4 dogs, and the total number of pets in the town is 280, how many houses have cats?\"\n\nWait a minute, perhaps some houses have more than one type of pet, but the problem says \"either cats or dogs,\" which implies only one type per house. However, maybe some houses have no pets, but the problem says \"every house has either cats or dogs as pets,\" which suggests that all houses have at least one pet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for houses to have multiple pets of the same type, but the way it's worded, it seems like each cat owner has exactly 3 cats, and each dog owner has exactly 4 dogs.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the only way to resolve this is to consider that some houses might have no pets, which would contradict the initial statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that some houses have cats and some have dogs, but not necessarily that all houses have pets.\n\nWait, the problem says \"every house has either cats or dogs as pets.\" The word \"either\" suggests exclusivity, meaning a house has cats or dogs, but not both.\n\nGiven that, and given that each cat owner has exactly 3 cats and each dog owner has exactly 4 dogs, and total pets are 280 in 100 houses.\n\nBut our earlier equations led to an impossible solution, with \\( c = 120 \\) and \\( d = -20 \\), which doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps there's a misinterpretation of the problem statement.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Let's think about the average number of pets per house. Total pets are 280 in 100 houses, so on average, each house has 2.8 pets.\n\nBut cat houses have 3 pets, and dog houses have 4 pets. So, if all houses had cats, there would be \\( 100 \\times 3 = 300 \\) pets, which is more than 280.\n\nIf all houses had dogs, there would be \\( 100 \\times 4 = 400 \\) pets, which is even more.\n\nWait, but our earlier equations suggested \\( c = 120 \\) and \\( d = -20 \\), which doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps the problem is not feasible as stated. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem itself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows for some houses to have neither cats nor dogs, but the statement says \"every house has either cats or dogs as pets,\" which suggests that all houses have at least one pet.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try another method.\n\nSuppose all 100 houses have cats. Then, total pets would be \\( 100 \\times 3 = 300 \\), which is 20 more than 280.\n\nIf we replace one cat house with a dog house, we increase the total number of pets by 1, because dog houses have 4 pets instead of 3.\n\nSo, for each replacement, we add 1 pet.\n\nWe need to decrease the total from 300 to 280, which is a difference of 20.\n\nBut wait, replacing a cat house with a dog house increases the total number of pets, which is the opposite of what we need.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe I have it backwards.\n\nIf I have a cat house with 3 pets, and I switch it to a dog house with 4 pets, the total number of pets increases by 1.\n\nBut I need the total to be less than 300, specifically 280, which is 20 less than 300.\n\nSo, I need to do something to decrease the total by 20.\n\nBut switching cat houses to dog houses increases the total, which is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some houses have no pets, but the problem says \"every house has either cats or dogs as pets.\"\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for houses to have multiple sets of cats or dogs, but the way it's worded, it seems like each cat owner has exactly 3 cats, and each dog owner has exactly 4 dogs.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that houses have multiples of 3 cats or multiples of 4 dogs.\n\nWait, no, the problem says each cat owner has exactly 3 cats, and each dog owner has exactly 4 dogs.\n\nSo, every cat house has exactly 3 cats, and every dog house has exactly 4 dogs.\n\nGiven that, and that total pets are 280 in 100 houses.\n\nBut our earlier equations led to an impossible solution.\n\nPerhaps the problem is misstated, or perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to be interpreted as houses having at least 3 cats or at least 4 dogs, but the wording doesn't suggest that; it says \"exactly 3 cats\" and \"exactly 4 dogs.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for some houses to have both cats and dogs, but the problem says \"either cats or dogs,\" which suggests exclusivity.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should try to set up the equations differently.\n\nLet me consider that the total number of pets is 280, which is the sum of the number of cats and the number of dogs.\n\nSo, \\( \\text{number of cats} + \\text{number of dogs} = 280 \\).\n\nAlso, since each cat house has exactly 3 cats, the number of cats is \\( 3c \\), where \\( c \\) is the number of cat houses.\n\nSimilarly, the number of dogs is \\( 4d \\), where \\( d \\) is the number of dog houses.\n\nAnd since every house has either cats or dogs, \\( c + d = 100 \\).\n\nSo, again, we have:\n\n\\[ c + d = 100 \\]\n\n\\[ 3c + 4d = 280 \\]\n\nAnd solving as before leads to \\( c = 120 \\) and \\( d = -20 \\), which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem has no solution as stated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that houses can have more than one type of pet, but the problem says \"either cats or dogs,\" which suggests exclusivity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the total number of pets is not 280, but something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows for some houses to have no pets, which would change the equations.\n\nLet me consider that possibility.\n\nSuppose some houses have no pets. Let\u2019s say \\( n \\) houses have no pets.\n\nThen, the number of cat houses is \\( c \\), the number of dog houses is \\( d \\), and the number of houses with no pets is \\( n \\), with \\( c + d + n = 100 \\).\n\nThe total number of pets is \\( 3c + 4d = 280 \\).\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( c + d + n = 100 \\)\n\n2. \\( 3c + 4d = 280 \\)\n\nBut now we have three variables and only two equations, which means we have infinitely many solutions.\n\nPerhaps we need another condition or to approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that all houses have pets, in which case \\( n = 0 \\), but as we've seen, that leads to an impossible solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be that houses have only cats or only dogs, but not both, and possibly some houses have no pets.\n\nIn that case, we can proceed with the equations:\n\n\\[ c + d + n = 100 \\]\n\n\\[ 3c + 4d = 280 \\]\n\nWe need integer solutions where \\( c \\), \\( d \\), and \\( n \\) are non-negative integers.\n\nLet me try to express \\( d \\) in terms of \\( c \\):\n\nFrom the first equation: \\( d = 100 - c - n \\)\n\nPlugging into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 3c + 4(100 - c - n) = 280 \\]\n\n\\[ 3c + 400 - 4c - 4n = 280 \\]\n\n\\[ -c - 4n + 400 = 280 \\]\n\n\\[ -c - 4n = -120 \\]\n\n\\[ c + 4n = 120 \\]\n\nSo, \\( c = 120 - 4n \\)\n\nNow, since \\( c \\) must be a non-negative integer, \\( 120 - 4n \\geq 0 \\), which implies \\( n \\leq 30 \\)\n\nAlso, \\( d = 100 - c - n = 100 - (120 - 4n) - n = 100 - 120 + 4n - n = -20 + 3n \\)\n\nSince \\( d \\) must be non-negative, \\( -20 + 3n \\geq 0 \\), which implies \\( n \\geq \\frac{20}{3} \\), or \\( n \\geq 7.\\overline{3} \\)\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer, \\( n \\geq 8 \\)\n\nAlso, from earlier, \\( n \\leq 30 \\)\n\nSo, possible values for \\( n \\) are integers from 8 to 30 inclusive.\n\nNow, let's choose a value for \\( n \\) and find corresponding \\( c \\) and \\( d \\).\n\nFor example, let\u2019s choose \\( n = 8 \\):\n\nThen, \\( c = 120 - 4 \\times 8 = 120 - 32 = 88 \\)\n\n\\( d = -20 + 3 \\times 8 = -20 + 24 = 4 \\)\n\nSo, \\( c = 88 \\), \\( d = 4 \\), \\( n = 8 \\)\n\nLet\u2019s check if this satisfies the original equations:\n\n\\( c + d + n = 88 + 4 + 8 = 100 \\) \u2705\n\n\\( 3c + 4d = 3 \\times 88 + 4 \\times 4 = 264 + 16 = 280 \\) \u2705\n\nSo, this is a valid solution.\n\nAlternatively, let\u2019s try \\( n = 9 \\):\n\n\\( c = 120 - 4 \\times 9 = 120 - 36 = 84 \\)\n\n\\( d = -20 + 3 \\times 9 = -20 + 27 = 7 \\)\n\nCheck:\n\n\\( 84 + 7 + 9 = 100 \\) \u2705\n\n\\( 3 \\times 84 + 4 \\times 7 = 252 + 28 = 280 \\) \u2705\n\nAnother valid solution.\n\nSimilarly, for \\( n = 10 \\):\n\n\\( c = 120 - 40 = 80 \\)\n\n\\( d = -20 + 30 = 10 \\)\n\nCheck:\n\n\\( 80 + 10 + 10 = 100 \\) \u2705\n\n\\( 3 \\times 80 + 4 \\times 10 = 240 + 40 = 280 \\) \u2705\n\nSo, there are multiple solutions depending on the number of houses with no pets.\n\nTherefore, the problem as stated does not have a unique solution; it has infinitely many solutions depending on the number of houses with no pets, as long as \\( n \\) is an integer between 8 and 30 inclusive.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem intended that all houses have pets, then there is no solution because \\( c = 120 \\) and \\( d = -20 \\) is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the problem might have been misstated or requires additional constraints to have a unique solution.\n\nGiven the standard interpretation, the number of houses with cats can vary from 88 to 120 - 4*30 = 0, but with the constraint that \\( n \\leq 30 \\) and \\( n \\geq 8 \\), the corresponding \\( c \\) values would be from 88 down to 120 - 120 = 0, but not all these would satisfy \\( d \\geq 0 \\).\n\nWait, let's check for \\( n = 30 \\):\n\n\\( c = 120 - 4*30 = 120 - 120 = 0 \\)\n\n\\( d = -20 + 3*30 = -20 + 90 = 70 \\)\n\nCheck:\n\n\\( 0 + 70 + 30 = 100 \\) \u2705\n\n\\( 3*0 + 4*70 = 0 + 280 = 280 \\) \u2705\n\nSo, another valid solution is \\( c = 0 \\), \\( d = 70 \\), \\( n = 30 \\)\n\nSimilarly, for \\( n = 7 \\):\n\n\\( c = 120 - 4*7 = 120 - 28 = 92 \\)\n\n\\( d = -20 + 3*7 = -20 + 21 = 1 \\)\n\nCheck:\n\n\\( 92 + 1 + 7 = 100 \\) \u2705\n\n\\( 3*92 + 4*1 = 276 + 4 = 280 \\) \u2705\n\nSo, \\( n \\) can be from 8 to 30, giving \\( c \\) from 88 to 0 in steps of 4 (since \\( c = 120 - 4n \\)).\n\nTherefore, the number of houses with cats can be any multiple of 4 from 0 to 88, as long as \\( n \\) is between 8 and 30.\n\nThus, without additional constraints, there are multiple possible answers.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the problem intended for all houses to have pets, then there is no solution, as shown earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the total number of pets is not 280, but something else that would make the numbers work out.\n\nFor example, if the total number of pets was 300, then with all houses having cats, \\( c = 100 \\), \\( d = 0 \\), and \\( 3*100 + 4*0 = 300 \\), which works.\n\nAlternatively, if the total number of pets was 280, and houses can have no pets, then there are multiple solutions as shown.\n\nTherefore, the problem likely intended for some houses to have no pets, and the number of houses with cats can vary accordingly.\n\nSo, the answer is that there are multiple possible numbers of houses with cats, ranging from 88 down to 0 in steps of 4, depending on the number of houses with no pets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Multiple solutions possible; houses with cats can range from 0 to 88 in multiples of 4}} \\]"
