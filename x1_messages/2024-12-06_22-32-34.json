He was actually born in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, in April 1564, not in Paris, France, as mentioned in your input. It seems there might be some confusion there.\n\nShakespeare's body of work is indeed impressive. He wrote approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and several other poems. Some of his most famous works include plays like \"Hamlet,\" \"Romeo and Juliet,\" \"Macbeth,\" \"Othello,\" and \"King Lear.\" His sonnets are also highly acclaimed and have been translated into every major living language.\n\nRegarding \"Hamlet,\" it's one of the most-performed plays worldwide, not just in France. It's a tragedy that explores themes of revenge, madness, and mortality. The play has been performed countless times in various languages and adaptations.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"
