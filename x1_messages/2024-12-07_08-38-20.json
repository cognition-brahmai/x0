It's bounded by four major ocean currents: the Gulf Stream to the west, the North Atlantic Current to the north, the Canary Current to the east, and the North Equatorial Current to the south. What makes the Sargasso Sea distinct is that it's defined not by land boundaries, but by these surrounding ocean currents which circulate in a clockwise direction, creating a large, mostly still area in the middle. This area is known for its abundant brown Sargassum seaweed, from which it gets its name."
