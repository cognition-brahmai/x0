        "content": "So I have this problem here: a factory produces 2000 units of a product in 8 hours, and it takes 4 workers to produce one unit in an hour. I need to find out how many workers are there in the factory. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The factory produces 2000 units in 8 hours, and for each unit, it takes 4 workers an hour to produce it. So, I guess I need to find the total number of workers required to achieve this production.\n\nLet me break it down. If it takes 4 workers to produce one unit in an hour, then in one hour, these 4 workers can produce one unit. So, the production rate per worker per hour would be 1/4 units, right? Because four of them together make one unit.\n\nWait, no. If 4 workers produce one unit in an hour, then the production rate per worker per hour is 1 unit divided by 4 workers, which is 0.25 units per worker per hour.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best way to look at it. Maybe I should think about the total worker-hours required to produce one unit.\n\nIf it takes 4 workers to produce one unit in an hour, that means producing one unit requires 4 worker-hours.\n\nSo, for 2000 units, the total worker-hours required would be 2000 units times 4 worker-hours per unit, which is 8000 worker-hours.\n\nNow, this production happens in 8 hours. So, if the factory has a certain number of workers who work for 8 hours, the total worker-hours available is the number of workers times 8 hours.\n\nLet me denote the number of workers as W. Then, total worker-hours available is W times 8.\n\nThis total worker-hours available should equal the total worker-hours required, which is 8000.\n\nSo, W times 8 equals 8000.\n\nTherefore, W equals 8000 divided by 8, which is 1000 workers.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check.\n\nIf there are 1000 workers, and each works for 8 hours, the total worker-hours is 1000 times 8, which is 8000 worker-hours.\n\nEach unit requires 4 worker-hours, so with 8000 worker-hours, the number of units produced is 8000 divided by 4, which is 2000 units.\n\nThat matches the given production amount. So, 1000 workers seem to be the correct answer.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps the 4 workers per unit per hour is somehow related to the speed of production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the production rate per hour.\n\nThe factory produces 2000 units in 8 hours, so per hour, it produces 2000 divided by 8, which is 250 units per hour.\n\nNow, if it takes 4 workers to produce one unit in an hour, then for 250 units per hour, the number of workers required would be 250 times 4, which is again 1000 workers.\n\nOkay, this confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nWait a minute, is there a possibility that workers are not working the full 8 hours, or maybe there are shifts involved?\n\nThe problem doesn't mention anything about shifts or partial hours, so I'll assume all workers work the full 8 hours.\n\nAlso, there's no information about workers' efficiency or breaks, so I'll assume all workers are working continuously during the 8 hours.\n\nGiven that, my conclusion remains that there are 1000 workers in the factory.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the answer should be 1000 workers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1000} \\]"
