        "content": "Let's see. So, the car is traveling at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, and we need to find out how far it will go in 2 hours and 45 minutes. First, I need to make sure that the time is in the same units as the speed. The speed is given in miles per hour, so it would be best to convert the time into hours.\n\nI know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so 45 minutes is 45/60 hours. Let me calculate that:\n\n45 \u00f7 60 = 0.75 hours.\n\nSo, 2 hours and 45 minutes is the same as 2.75 hours.\n\nNow, since speed is distance over time, or s = d/t, I can rearrange that to find distance: d = s \u00d7 t.\n\nPlugging in the values, d = 60 miles per hour \u00d7 2.75 hours.\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n60 \u00d7 2.75.\n\nWell, 60 \u00d7 2 is 120, and 60 \u00d7 0.75 is 45, so total distance is 120 + 45 = 165 miles.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of units. Miles per hour multiplied by hours gives miles.\n\nSo, 60 miles/hour \u00d7 2.75 hours = 165 miles.\n\nYeah, that seems right.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that in one hour, the car travels 60 miles. So in 2 hours, it would travel 120 miles. Then, in 45 minutes, which is 3/4 of an hour, it would travel 3/4 of 60 miles, which is 45 miles. Adding those together, 120 + 45 equals 165 miles.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can convert everything to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 45 minutes, totaling 165 minutes.\n\nNow, the speed is 60 miles per hour. To find the speed in miles per minute, I can divide 60 miles by 60 minutes, which is 1 mile per minute.\n\nSo, if the car travels 1 mile every minute, then in 165 minutes, it would travel 165 miles.\n\nThis again confirms my previous result.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{165} \\]"
