On average, it takes 5 minutes to load and unload passengers between runs. Calculate the maximum number of riders the roller coaster can accommodate in an 8-hour operating day. Additionally, consider a ticket price of $10 per rider and estimate the daily revenue generated by the ride. Explain your calculations."

        "content": "To calculate the maximum number of riders the roller coaster can accommodate in an 8-hour operating day, we need to determine how many runs can be completed in that time frame and then multiply by the capacity per run.\n\nFirst, let's find out the total time required for one complete cycle of the roller coaster, which includes both the ride time and the loading/unloading time.\n\nRide time: 3 minutes\nLoading/unloading time: 5 minutes\nTotal cycle time: 3 + 5 = 8 minutes per cycle\n\nNext, we need to determine how many such cycles can be completed in an 8-hour operating day.\n\nFirst, convert 8 hours to minutes:\n8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes\n\nNow, divide the total operating time by the cycle time to find the number of cycles:\n480 minutes / 8 minutes per cycle = 60 cycles per day\n\nEach cycle can accommodate 30 riders, so the maximum number of riders per day is:\n60 cycles * 30 riders per cycle = 1800 riders per day\n\nNow, to estimate the daily revenue generated by the ride, we multiply the number of riders by the ticket price.\n\nTicket price: $10 per rider\nDaily revenue: 1800 riders * $10/rider = $18,000 per day\n\nTherefore, the roller coaster can accommodate up to 1800 riders per day, generating an estimated daily revenue of $18,000.\n\n**Summary of calculations:**\n\n1. Total cycle time = ride time + loading/unloading time = 3 minutes + 5 minutes = 8 minutes per cycle\n\n2. Total operating time = 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes\n\n3. Number of cycles per day = total operating time / total cycle time = 480 minutes / 8 minutes per cycle = 60 cycles\n\n4. Maximum riders per day = number of cycles per day * capacity per cycle = 60 cycles * 30 riders per cycle = 1800 riders\n\n5. Daily revenue = maximum riders per day * ticket price = 1800 riders * $10/rider = $18,000 per day"
