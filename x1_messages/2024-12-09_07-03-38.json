        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a class of 40 students, and 75% of them passed the exam. First, I need to find out how many students passed.\n\nTo do that, I'll calculate 75% of 40. Percentage calculations are straightforward: you multiply the total number by the percentage in decimal form. Since 75% is 0.75, I'll do:\n\n40 students * 0.75 = 30 students passed the exam.\n\nNow, out of these 30 students who passed, 60% received a grade above 80%. I need to find out how many students that is.\n\nAgain, I'll calculate 60% of 30. 60% is 0.60, so:\n\n30 students * 0.60 = 18 students scored above 80%.\n\nThe question asks for how many students scored below 80%. Since 18 students scored above 80%, I can subtract that from the total number of students who passed to find those who scored below 80%.\n\nSo, 30 students passed, and 18 scored above 80%, therefore:\n\n30 - 18 = 12 students scored below 80%.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check if this is the correct interpretation. The question is about how many students scored below 80%, but I need to consider if there are students who passed but scored exactly 80% or below.\n\nGiven that 60% of the passed students scored above 80%, the remaining 40% must have scored 80% or below, since 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nSo, alternatively, I could calculate 40% of 30 students to find those who scored 80% or below.\n\nLet's calculate that to confirm:\n\n30 students * 0.40 = 12 students scored 80% or below.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation where I subtracted the number of students who scored above 80% from the total passed students.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who scored below 80% is 12.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the overall class. There are 40 students in total, and 30 passed. That means 10 students did not pass, but since the question is only about those who passed and their grades, these 10 students are irrelevant to this particular question.\n\nSo, my final answer is 12 students scored below 80%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
