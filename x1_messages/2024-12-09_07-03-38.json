Sounds straightforward, right? Let's break this down into manageable steps.\n\nFirst, you'll need to make sure you have a CSV file ready. Let's assume your CSV file is named \"contacts.csv\" and it has two columns: \"Name\" and \"Email\". Here's what the CSV might look like:\n\n```\nName,Email\nAlice,alice@example.com\nBob,bob@example.com\nCharlie,charlie@example.com\n```\n\nNext, you'll need to set up your Python environment. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check this by running `python --version` in your command line.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps we need to take in our Python script:\n\n1. Read the CSV file and extract the names and email addresses.\n2. Set up the email server using SMTP.\n3. Compose a personalized email for each person.\n4. Send the email to each person.\n\nLet's start by reading the CSV file. For this, we can use the `csv` module in Python, which is part of the standard library, so you don't need to install anything extra.\n\nHere's a snippet to read the CSV file:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\ncontacts = []\n\nwith open('contacts.csv', newline='') as csvfile:\n    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)\n    for row in reader:\n        contacts.append(row)\n\nprint(contacts)\n```\n\nThis will read the CSV file and store the data in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a person's name and email.\n\nNext, we need to set up the SMTP server to send emails. For this example, I'll assume you're using Gmail's SMTP server. If you're using a different email provider, you'll need to adjust the SMTP server settings accordingly.\n\nTo send emails using Gmail's SMTP server, you'll need to provide your Gmail username and password. For security reasons, it's better to use an app password if you have two-factor authentication enabled on your Gmail account.\n\nHere's how you can set up the SMTP server:\n\n```python\nimport smtplib\nfrom email.mime.text import MIMEText\nfrom email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart\n\nsender_email = \"your_email@gmail.com\"\npassword = \"your_password\"\n\n# Create an SMTP session\nserver = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)\nserver.starttls()\nserver.login(sender_email, password)\n```\n\nNow, we need to compose a personalized email for each person. We'll use the `MIMEMultipart` class to create the email message, which allows us to send both plain text and HTML formatted emails. For simplicity, let's stick with plain text.\n\nHere's an example of how to create and send an email:\n\n```python\nfor contact in contacts:\n    name = contact['Name']\n    email = contact['Email']\n\n    # Create the email\n    message = MIMEMultipart()\n    message['From'] = sender_email\n    message['To'] = email\n    message['Subject'] = \"Hello from Python!\"\n\n    # Add body to email\n    body = f\"Hello {name},\\nThis is a test email sent from Python.\"\n    message.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))\n\n    # Send the email\n    text = message.as_string()\n    server.sendmail(sender_email, email, text)\n\n# Terminate the SMTP session\nserver.quit()\n```\n\nPutting it all together, here's the complete script:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nimport smtplib\nfrom email.mime.text import MIMEText\nfrom email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart\n\n# Read contacts from CSV\ncontacts = []\nwith open('contacts.csv', newline='') as csvfile:\n    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)\n    for row in reader:\n        contacts.append(row)\n\n# SMTP server setup\nsender_email = \"your_email@gmail.com\"\npassword = \"your_password\"\nserver = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)\nserver.starttls()\nserver.login(sender_email, password)\n\n# Send email to each contact\nfor contact in contacts:\n    name = contact['Name']\n    email = contact['Email']\n\n    message = MIMEMultipart()\n    message['From'] = sender_email\n    message['To'] = email\n    message['Subject'] = \"Hello from Python!\"\n\n    body = f\"Hello {name},\\nThis is a test email sent from Python.\"\n    message.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))\n\n    text = message.as_string()\n    server.sendmail(sender_email, email, text)\n\n# Quit the server\nserver.quit()\n```\n\nRemember to replace `\"your_email@gmail.com\"` and `\"your_password\"` with your actual Gmail email and password or app password.\n\nAlso, be aware that sending emails in bulk might trigger spam filters, so use this script responsibly and make sure you have permission to send emails to the recipients.\n\nThat's it! This script should read the CSV file, compose personalized emails, and send them using Gmail's SMTP server. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.\n"
