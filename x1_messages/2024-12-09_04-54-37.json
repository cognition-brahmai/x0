        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, I need to find the probability of drawing a face card\u2014 that's a jack, queen, or king\u2014 followed by an ace, and the first card isn't replaced. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes. Since it's a standard deck, there are 52 cards. When I draw the first card, there are 52 possibilities, and then since I don't replace it, there are 51 cards left for the second draw. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 52 times 51, which is\u2026 let's see, 52 times 50 is 2600, plus 52 more is 2652. So, 2652 possible outcomes in total.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is drawing a face card first and then an ace.\n\nLet's identify how many face cards are in the deck. Face cards are jacks, queens, and kings. There are 4 jacks, 4 queens, and 4 kings, so total face cards are 4 plus 4 plus 4, which is 12.\n\nSo, there are 12 face cards out of 52.\n\nAfter drawing a face card, I don't replace it, so there are now 51 cards left in the deck.\n\nNext, I need to draw an ace. There are 4 aces in a standard deck.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to draw a face card first and then an ace.\n\nThat would be the number of face cards times the number of aces remaining after drawing a face card.\n\nWait a minute, but since the first card is a face card, which is not an ace, the number of aces doesn't change; there are still 4 aces left in the remaining 51 cards.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 12 (face cards) times 4 (aces), which is 48.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability P is 48 over 2652.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction. Both 48 and 2652 are divisible by 12.\n\n48 divided by 12 is 4, and 2652 divided by 12 is\u2026 2652 divided by 12. Let's see, 12 times 220 is 2640, which is 12 less than 2652, so 221. So, 221.\n\nTherefore, P = 4/221.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the probability of drawing a face card first and then an ace, without replacement.\n\nThe probability of drawing a face card first is 12/52, since there are 12 face cards out of 52.\n\nThen, given that the first card was a face card, the probability of drawing an ace next is 4/51, since there are 4 aces left in the remaining 51 cards.\n\nSo, the combined probability is (12/52) times (4/51).\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nFirst, 12/52 simplifies to 3/13, because both numerator and denominator are divisible by 4.\n\nThen, 3/13 times 4/51.\n\nMultiply numerators: 3 times 4 is 12.\n\nMultiply denominators: 13 times 51 is\u2026 13 times 50 is 650, plus 13 more is 663.\n\nSo, 12/663.\n\nCan this be simplified? Let's see, 12 and 663.\n\nBoth are divisible by 3.\n\n12 divided by 3 is 4, and 663 divided by 3 is 221.\n\nSo, 4/221.\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the probability is 4/221.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way is to consider the total number of ways to draw two cards in sequence, which is 52 choose 2, but since the order matters here, it's permutations.\n\nThe number of permutations of 52 cards taken 2 at a time is 52P2, which is 52 times 51, which is 2652.\n\nThen, the number of favorable permutations is the number of face cards times the number of aces, which is 12 times 4, which is 48.\n\nSo, again, probability is 48/2652, which simplifies to 4/221.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider combinations, but since order matters here, permutations are more appropriate.\n\nWait, actually, in combinations, order doesn't matter, but here, order does matter because it's first drawing a face card and then an ace.\n\nSo, permutations are the right way to go.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use combinations, I'd have to adjust for the order.\n\nBut stick with permutations for clarity.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 4/221 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider the decimal equivalent.\n\n4 divided by 221 is approximately 0.0181, or 1.81%.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nWell, there are 12 face cards and 4 aces in 52 cards.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a face card first is 12/52, which is about 23.08%.\n\nThen, given that, the probability of drawing an ace next is 4/51, which is about 7.84%.\n\nMultiplying those gives approximately 1.81%.\n\nDoes that seem reasonable?\n\nWell, it's a specific sequence of events, so it should be less likely, which makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that there are 12 face cards and 4 aces, that's a total of 16 special cards.\n\nBut since I'm drawing in a specific order, and the events are dependent, the calculation above seems correct.\n\nSo, I think the probability is indeed 4/221.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{221}} \\]"
