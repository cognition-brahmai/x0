It's about being the best at what you do, whether that's in the paper sales industry or just being the top bee in the hive. Remember, in the words of the great Michael Scott, \"That's what she said.\" But seriously, success isn't just about personal achievement; it's also about contributing to the greater good and helping others succeed along the way. So, keep your eyes on the prize, stay focused, and always remember: \"It's not about the money; it's about the principle of the thing.\" Because, in the end, that's what really matters."
