Let's dive into implementing a merge sort algorithm in Python that sorts a list of strings alphabetically, ignoring case, and merges duplicate entries together.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what you're asking for:\n\n1. **Merge Sort Algorithm**: This is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the list into halves, sorts them separately, and then merges them back together in sorted order.\n\n2. **Case-Insensitive Sorting**: The sorting should not consider the case of the strings, meaning 'a' and 'A' should be treated as equal.\n\n3. **Handling Duplicates**: When there are duplicate strings (considering case-insensitivity), they should be merged together. This likely means that duplicates should be removed, keeping only one instance of each unique string, regardless of case.\n\nGiven that, here's how I would approach this:\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Convert Strings to Lowercase for Comparison**: To achieve case-insensitive sorting and duplicate handling, I'll convert all strings to lowercase during the sorting process.\n\n2. **Implement the Merge Sort Function**: This function will recursively split the list into halves until each sublist has one element, and then merge them back in sorted order.\n\n3. **Merge Function**: This function will merge two sorted sublists into a single sorted list, removing duplicates in the process.\n\n4. **Remove Duplicates**: While merging, I'll keep track of the last element added to the result to avoid adding duplicates.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    mid = len(arr) // 2\n    left_half = merge_sort(arr[:mid])\n    right_half = merge_sort(arr[mid:])\n    return merge(left_half, right_half)\n\ndef merge(left, right):\n    result = []\n    i = j = 0\n    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):\n        if left[i].lower() < right[j].lower():\n            result.append(left[i])\n            i += 1\n        elif left[i].lower() > right[j].lower():\n            result.append(right[j])\n            j += 1\n        else:\n            # If equal (case-insensitive), pick one and skip duplicates\n            result.append(left[i])\n            i += 1\n            j += 1\n            # Skip duplicates in left\n            while i < len(left) and left[i].lower() == left[i-1].lower():\n                i += 1\n            # Skip duplicates in right\n            while j < len(right) and right[j].lower() == right[j-1].lower():\n                j += 1\n    # Append remaining elements from left or right, skipping duplicates\n    while i < len(left):\n        if not result or left[i].lower() != result[-1].lower():\n            result.append(left[i])\n        i += 1\n    while j < len(right):\n        if not result or right[j].lower() != result[-1].lower():\n            result.append(right[j])\n        j += 1\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [\"banana\", \"Apple\", \"apple\", \"Cherry\", \"banana\", \"Date\"]\nsorted_arr = merge_sort(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **merge_sort Function**:\n   - If the list has one or zero elements, it's already sorted.\n   - Otherwise, split the list into two halves and recursively sort each half.\n   - Merge the two sorted halves using the `merge` function.\n\n2. **merge Function**:\n   - Initialize an empty list `result` to store the merged result.\n   - Use two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse the left and right sublists.\n   - Compare elements from both sublists case-insensitively and append the smaller one to `result`.\n   - If elements are equal (case-insensitive), append one and skip duplicates in both sublists.\n   - After merging, append any remaining elements from either sublist, skipping duplicates.\n\nThis approach ensures that the list is sorted alphabetically ignoring case and that duplicates are merged together, keeping only one instance of each unique string regardless of case.\n"
