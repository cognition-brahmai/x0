        "content": "I'm here to help you with your question. So, Sarah has 20 pencils and she gives away 5 erasers. You want to know how many pens she has left. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, we need to figure out what items Sarah has. You mentioned pencils and erasers, but the question is about pens. Are pens the same as pencils, or does Sarah have pens separately?\n\nWell, pencils and pens are different writing instruments. Pencils have graphite cores, while pens have ink. So, unless specified, pencils and pens are not the same.\n\nThe question says Sarah has 20 pencils and gives away 5 erasers. It doesn't mention anything about pens initially. So, if she didn't have any pens to begin with, giving away erasers wouldn't change the number of pens she has, which is zero.\n\nBut maybe she had some pens already, and the question didn't mention them. However, based on the information provided, we can only work with what's given.\n\nLet me re-read the question: \"Sarah has 20 pencils and gives away 5 erasers. How many pens does she have left?\"\n\nIt seems like there might be some confusion in the question. Maybe it's a trick question or perhaps there's a typo.\n\nIf Sarah has 20 pencils and gives away 5 erasers, her number of pencils shouldn't be affected by giving away erasers, assuming she didn't have any pens to begin with.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the question is trying to misdirect by mentioning erasers. Perhaps it's a test to see if you pay attention to the relevant information.\n\nSo, if Sarah has 20 pencils and gives away 5 erasers, and the question is about pens, which weren't mentioned before, it's possible that she has zero pens.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"pens\" was meant to be \"pencils,\" but in that case, the question would be: \"How many pencils does she have left?\" And the answer would be 20, since she gave away erasers, not pencils.\n\nBut the question specifically says \"pens,\" not pencils.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Maybe there's a relationship between pencils, erasers, and pens that I'm missing.\n\nPerhaps in some contexts, pencils and erasers are used together, and pens are separate. But that doesn't help answer the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the question, and it should have mentioned pens initially.\n\nGiven the information provided, I think the most logical answer is that Sarah has zero pens, since nothing in the question indicates she had any pens to begin with.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because the question seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step:\n\n1. Sarah has 20 pencils.\n\n2. Sarah gives away 5 erasers.\n\n3. Question: How many pens does she have left?\n\nFrom steps 1 and 2, there's no mention of pens. Therefore, unless specified otherwise, it's reasonable to assume that Sarah has zero pens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to test basic arithmetic skills, but it's not clear how giving away erasers affects the number of pens.\n\nWait, maybe there's a misheard or miswritten word, and it's supposed to be \"pens\" instead of \"pencils.\" But that would make more sense if the question was about pencils and pens.\n\nFor example, if it said, \"Sarah has 20 pens and gives away 5 pencils,\" then we could deduce how many pens she has left. But in this case, it's pencils and erasers.\n\nI think the key here is to recognize that pens were never mentioned initially, so she likely has zero pens.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe there's more to the story.\n\nPerhaps Sarah has a stationery set that includes pencils, erasers, and pens, and giving away erasers affects the total number of items, thereby affecting the number of pens.\n\nBut that seems too speculative. The question specifically asks about pens, and without any initial information about pens, it's logical to assume she has zero pens.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is worded incorrectly, and it should be about pencils instead of pens.\n\nFor example, if it said, \"Sarah has 20 pencils and gives away 5 pencils. How many pencils does she have left?\" Then the answer would be 15 pencils.\n\nBut the question specifically says \"gives away 5 erasers,\" not pencils.\n\nTherefore, giving away erasers doesn't affect the number of pencils she has, assuming erasers are separate items.\n\nAgain, pens were never mentioned, so likely, she has zero pens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a assumption that pencils and pens are interchangeable or that some pencils are actually pens, but that's not supported by the information given.\n\nGiven all that, I think the answer is that Sarah has zero pens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
