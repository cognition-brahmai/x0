        "content": "Implementing a chat server in C++ using sockets involves several steps, including setting up a server socket, handling multiple client connections, and managing message broadcasting among clients. Below is a simplified version of such a server. Please note that this is a basic implementation and may require enhancements for production use, such as better error handling, security measures, and optimizations for handling a large number of clients.\n\n### Server Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <arpa/inet.h>\n#include <vector>\n#include <thread>\n\nconst int PORT = 8080;\nint server_fd, new_socket;\nstruct sockaddr_in address;\nint opt = 1;\nint addrlen = sizeof(address);\nstd::vector<int> client_sockets;\n\n// Function to handle client connections and messages\nvoid handle_client(int client_socket) {\n    char buffer[1024] = {0};\n    while (true) {\n        int valread = read(client_socket, buffer, 1024);\n        if (valread <= 0) {\n            // Client disconnected\n            close(client_socket);\n            client_sockets.erase(\n                std::remove(client_sockets.begin(), client_sockets.end(), client_socket),\n                client_sockets.end()\n            );\n            std::cout << \"Client disconnected\" << std::endl;\n            return;\n        }\n        std::string message = \"Client: \" + std::string(buffer);\n        std::cout << message << std::endl;\n        // Broadcast message to all connected clients\n        for (int socket : client_sockets) {\n            if (socket != client_socket) {\n                send(socket, message.c_str(), message.size(), 0);\n            }\n        }\n        // Clear buffer\n        memset(buffer, 0, 1024);\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Create socket file descriptor\n    if ((server_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) == 0) {\n        perror(\"socket failed\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n\n    // Forcefully attaching socket to the port 8080\n    if (setsockopt(server_fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR | SO_REUSEPORT, &opt, sizeof(opt))) {\n        perror(\"setsockopt\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n\n    address.sin_family = AF_INET;\n    address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;\n    address.sin_port = htons(PORT);\n\n    // Forcefully attaching socket to the port 8080\n    if (bind(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&address, sizeof(address)) < 0) {\n        perror(\"bind failed\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n\n    // Listen for incoming connections\n    if (listen(server_fd, 3) < 0) {\n        perror(\"listen\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n\n    std::cout << \"Server is listening on port \" << PORT << std::endl;\n\n    while (true) {\n        if ((new_socket = accept(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&address, (socklen_t*)&addrlen)) < 0) {\n            perror(\"accept\");\n            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n        }\n\n        std::cout << \"New client connected\" << std::endl;\n        client_sockets.push_back(new_socket);\n\n        // Start a new thread to handle the client\n        std::thread client_thread(handle_client, new_socket);\n        client_thread.detach();\n    }\n\n    // Close server socket\n    close(server_fd);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Socket Setup:**\n   - A server socket is created using `socket()`.\n   - `setsockopt()` is used to allow address reuse.\n   - The server binds to a specified port using `bind()`.\n   - It starts listening for incoming connections with `listen()`.\n\n2. **Handling Clients:**\n   - The server accepts new connections using `accept()`.\n   - Each new client connection is handled in a separate thread to allow multiple clients to connect simultaneously.\n   - The `handle_client` function reads messages from the client and broadcasts them to all other connected clients.\n\n3. **Message Broadcasting:**\n   - When a message is received from a client, it is broadcast to all other connected clients.\n   - If a client disconnects, the server removes the client's socket from the list and closes the connection.\n\n### Compilation and Running\n\nTo compile and run this server, you need a C++ compiler with support for C++11 or later (for `std::thread`). Use the following commands:\n\n```sh\ng++ -std=c++11 server.cpp -o chat_server\n./chat_server\n```\n\nThis will start the server, and it will listen for connections on port 8080. You can connect to it using any TCP client, such as `telnet` or a custom client program.\n\n### Note\n\n- This is a basic implementation and does not include advanced features like user authentication, message encryption, or handling of large numbers of clients efficiently.\n- For production use, consider using asynchronous I/O or other techniques to handle multiple clients without creating a new thread for each one.\n- Error handling is minimal and can be expanded to handle various edge cases and network errors."
