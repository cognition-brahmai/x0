        "content": "Let's see. So, there's a factory that makes two types of products, A and B. Product A takes 2 hours to make, and product B takes 4 hours. The factory has a maximum of 40 hours per week to work with. The goal is to produce an equal number of both products. I need to find out the maximum number of each product that can be produced in one week.\n\nFirst, I should probably define a variable for the number of each product. Since they want an equal number, I can use the same variable for both. Let's say \\( x \\) is the number of product A and also the number of product B.\n\nNow, the total time to make \\( x \\) units of product A would be \\( 2x \\) hours, because each A takes 2 hours. Similarly, the total time to make \\( x \\) units of product B would be \\( 4x \\) hours, since each B takes 4 hours.\n\nThe total time spent on both products should not exceed 40 hours. So, I can set up an inequality:\n\n\\[ 2x + 4x \\leq 40 \\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\[ 6x \\leq 40 \\]\n\nNow, solving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x \\leq \\frac{40}{6} \\]\n\n\\[ x \\leq 6.\\overline{6} \\]\n\nSince you can't produce a fraction of a product, the maximum whole number for \\( x \\) would be 6.\n\nLet me check if that works:\n\nIf \\( x = 6 \\), then time for A is \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\) hours, and for B is \\( 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\) hours. Total time is \\( 12 + 24 = 36 \\) hours, which is within the 40-hour limit.\n\nWhat if \\( x = 7 \\)?\n\nTime for A: \\( 2 \\times 7 = 14 \\) hours\n\nTime for B: \\( 4 \\times 7 = 28 \\) hours\n\nTotal time: \\( 14 + 28 = 42 \\) hours, which exceeds the 40-hour limit.\n\nSo, \\( x = 6 \\) is the maximum number of each product that can be produced in one week while staying within the time constraints.\n\nWait a minute, is there a way to maximize the number of products beyond 6 each if they don't have to be equal? But the question specifically says they want to produce an equal number of both products. So, I think 6 of each is the answer.\n\nBut let's consider if there's another way to interpret this. Maybe there's a way to optimize further, but given the constraints, I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to produce more of one product to maximize total production, but again, the requirement is for equal numbers of A and B.\n\nSo, I believe the answer is 6 of each product.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
