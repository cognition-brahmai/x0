        "content": "Hmm, interesting question! So, we've got an electric train going east at 70 mph, and there's wind blowing west at 20 mph. The question is, which way does the smoke blow?\n\nFirst off, I need to think about what's producing the smoke. In a typical scenario, smoke comes from burning something, like in a coal-fired train. But here, it's an electric train. So, do electric trains produce smoke? I think electric trains don't have smoke because they don't burn fuel; they get their power from electricity.\n\nWait, maybe it's a trick question? Maybe there's no smoke to begin with because it's electric. But the question seems to assume there is smoke. Maybe it's just a hypothetical situation, or perhaps there's something else producing smoke, like a chimney or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the smoke is coming from something outside the train, like a smoke stack or a fire nearby. But the question seems focused on the train.\n\nLet me consider the relative speeds. The train is going east at 70 mph, and the wind is blowing west at 20 mph. So, from the perspective of the train, the wind is coming from the west at 20 mph, but the train is moving east at 70, so the effective wind speed relative to the train is 70 + 20 = 90 mph east.\n\nWait, no. If the train is moving east at 70 and the wind is blowing west at 20, the relative wind speed for someone on the train would be 70 - (-20) = 90 mph east. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nBut if there's smoke, and wind is blowing it, the smoke would generally blow in the direction of the wind. However, since the train is moving east, and the wind is blowing west, but from the train's perspective, the wind is effectively blowing east even stronger.\n\nBut hold on, wind direction is tricky. If the wind is blowing west, that means it's coming from the west and going to the east. So, in general, wind direction is the direction it's coming from. So, wind blowing west means it's coming from the west and going to the east.\n\nBut the train is also moving east. So, the smoke would be affected by both the train's movement and the wind.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. If there's smoke coming from something on the train, and the train is moving east, the smoke would likely be carried in the direction of the wind.\n\nBut since the wind is blowing west, it would seem that the smoke should blow west. However, the train is moving east quickly, so maybe the smoke gets carried east despite the wind.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think differently. If the train weren't moving, and the wind is blowing west, then smoke would blow west.\n\nBut since the train is moving east at 70 mph, and the wind is blowing west at 20 mph, the smoke would be affected by both velocities.\n\nIn terms of vectors, the smoke's movement would be the vector sum of the train's velocity and the wind's velocity.\n\nThe train is moving east at 70 mph, and the wind is moving west at 20 mph. So, if we consider east as positive and west as negative, then the smoke's velocity would be +70 (train) + (-20) (wind) = +50 mph east.\n\nSo, the smoke would blow east at 50 mph.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make intuitive sense. If the wind is blowing west, shouldn't it counteract the train's eastward motion?\n\nMaybe I need to consider the reference frame. If I'm standing still on the ground, I see the train going east at 70 mph and the wind blowing west at 20 mph.\n\nIf there's smoke coming from the train, the smoke would be moving with the velocity of the train when it's emitted, and then be affected by the wind.\n\nSo, from the train's perspective, the wind is blowing west at 20 mph, but the train is moving east at 70, so relative to the train, the wind is blowing west at 20 mph plus the train's eastward motion of 70 mph, making the wind appear to blow west at 90 mph from the train's perspective.\n\nWait, no. Relative velocity can be tricky.\n\nLet me try another approach. Imagine you're on the train. The train is moving east at 70 mph, and the wind is blowing west at 20 mph.\n\nThe effective wind you feel on the train would be the wind's velocity minus the train's velocity.\n\nSo, wind velocity: -20 mph (west is negative)\n\nTrain velocity: +70 mph (east is positive)\n\nEffective wind: -20 - 70 = -90 mph. So, from the train's perspective, the wind is blowing west at 90 mph.\n\nBut if there's smoke generated on the train, it would be carried by this effective wind, which is blowing west at 90 mph from the train's perspective.\n\nBut, in reality, the smoke would be affected by the actual wind and the train's motion.\n\nMaybe I need to think in terms of air mass.\n\nThe air is moving west at 20 mph.\n\nThe train is moving east at 70 mph.\n\nSo, the smoke would be emitted from the train and carried by the air moving west at 20 mph.\n\nBut since the train is moving east at 70, the smoke would have an initial eastward velocity of 70 mph and then be affected by the westward wind of 20 mph.\n\nSo, the smoke's velocity would be 70 east minus 20 west, which is 50 east.\n\nSo, the smoke would blow east at 50 mph.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because the wind is blowing west.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the smoke is emitted from the train and then moves with the wind.\n\nSo, when the smoke is emitted, it's moving east at 70 mph with the train, and then the wind affects it, blowing it west at 20 mph.\n\nSo, the net movement of the smoke would be 70 east minus 20 east, which is 50 east.\n\nWait, no. Wind blowing west would be -20 mph.\n\nSo, smoke's velocity: +70 (from train) + (-20) (from wind) = +50 mph east.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the smoke would blow east at 50 mph.\n\nBut intuitively, if the wind is blowing west, you'd expect the smoke to blow west, but because the train is moving east so much faster, the smoke still blows east, just at a reduced speed.\n\nThat's an interesting result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the smoke is emitted from the train and then moves with the wind.\n\nSo, in the air's frame of reference, the smoke is moving west at 20 mph, but since the train is moving east at 70, the smoke has an initial eastward velocity of 70 mph.\n\nSo, the smoke's velocity relative to the ground would be 70 east plus 20 west, which is 50 east.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, the smoke would blow east at 50 mph.\n\nBut now, thinking about it differently, if the train were moving west at 70 mph and the wind is blowing west at 20 mph, the smoke would blow west at 90 mph.\n\nIn this case, since the train is moving east at 70 and wind west at 20, smoke blows east at 50 mph.\n\nInteresting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no smoke from an electric train, and the question is just a trick to make you think about relative velocities.\n\nBut assuming there is smoke for the sake of the problem, the answer seems to be that the smoke blows east at 50 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50 \\text{ mph east}} \\]"
