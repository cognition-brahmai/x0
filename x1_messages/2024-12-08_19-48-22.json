        "content": "Let's break this down. So, there are two types of cookies: chocolate chip and oatmeal. The store sells an average of 120 chocolate chip cookies per day at $0.50 each, and 80 oatmeal cookies per day at $0.75 each. We need to find out how much revenue the store generates from cookie sales in one week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what revenue means. Revenue is the total income from sales, so it's the number of items sold multiplied by the price per item.\n\nLet me calculate the daily revenue from each type of cookie first.\n\nFor chocolate chip cookies:\n\nNumber sold per day: 120\n\nPrice per cookie: $0.50\n\nDaily revenue from chocolate chip = 120 * $0.50\n\nLet me do that multiplication:\n\n120 * 0.50 = $60\n\nSo, $60 per day from chocolate chip cookies.\n\nNow, for oatmeal cookies:\n\nNumber sold per day: 80\n\nPrice per cookie: $0.75\n\nDaily revenue from oatmeal = 80 * $0.75\n\n80 * 0.75 = $60\n\nSo, $60 per day from oatmeal cookies.\n\nNow, total daily revenue from both types of cookies is $60 (chocolate chip) + $60 (oatmeal) = $120 per day.\n\nNext, we need to find out the weekly revenue. Assuming the store is open 7 days a week, we can multiply the daily revenue by 7.\n\nWeekly revenue = $120 per day * 7 days\n\n$120 * 7 = $840\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check if there are any other factors to consider. Is there any information about the store being closed on certain days or any promotions? The question doesn't mention anything like that, so I think 7 days a week is a safe assumption.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes stores might have different sales volumes on weekends versus weekdays, but again, the question states \"average of 120 chocolate chip cookies per day\" and \"80 oatmeal cookies per day,\" so it's an average across the week.\n\nTherefore, the total weekly revenue from cookie sales is $840.\n\nI think that's the answer, but let me just verify the calculations once more.\n\nChocolate chip: 120 * $0.50 = $60 per day\n\nOatmeal: 80 * $0.75 = $60 per day\n\nTotal daily revenue: $60 + $60 = $120\n\nWeekly revenue: $120 * 7 = $840\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{840} \\]"
