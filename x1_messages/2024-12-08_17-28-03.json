        "content": "Let's see... I'm trying to figure out which option isn't a characteristic of prokaryotic cells. I remember that prokaryotes are simpler cells compared to eukaryotes. So, let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says they have a cell wall. I think most prokaryotes do have cell walls made of peptidoglycan, which helps them maintain their shape and protects them. So, that seems like a characteristic they have.\n\nOption B mentions that they reproduce by binary fission. Yeah, I recall that prokaryotes don't undergo mitosis like eukaryotes; instead, they reproduce by binary fission, where the cell divides into two identical daughter cells. So, that's another characteristic.\n\nOption C says they contain mitochondria. Now, mitochondria are organelles responsible for energy production in cells. I think in eukaryotic cells, like plants and animals, they have mitochondria, but I'm not sure about prokaryotes. Wait, don't prokaryotes have simpler structures? Maybe they don't have membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria.\n\nOption D states that they lack a nucleus. That rings a bell. Prokaryotes don't have a true nucleus; their DNA is floating freely in the cytoplasm. So, lacking a nucleus is a defining feature of prokaryotes.\n\nHmm, so if I have to choose one that's NOT a characteristic of prokaryotic cells, it might be option C, that they contain mitochondria. Because prokaryotes are supposed to be simpler and don't have membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. Do prokaryotes have mitochondria? I think in some cases, there might be structures that perform similar functions, but they are not true mitochondria as found in eukaryotes.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be C, they contain mitochondria, because that's not a characteristic of prokaryotic cells.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
