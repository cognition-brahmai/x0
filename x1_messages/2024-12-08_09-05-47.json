In Pac-Man, players control the titular character through a maze, eating pellets while avoiding being caught by four colored ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. The term \"Pac-Man\" has indeed become synonymous with the concept of a phantom or ghost in popular culture due to the game's enduring popularity and influence."
