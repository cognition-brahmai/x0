But remember, a shadow cannot harm you unless you let it define your path.\n\nIn the depths of your heart, there lies courage. It is buried beneath layers of doubt and uncertainty. To unearth it, you must dig deep, deeper than you have ever dug before. Face your fears head-on, for only then can you truly conquer them.\n\nPatience and persistence are key. Do not expect overnight success. Overcoming fear is a journey, not a destination. Each step you take, no matter how small, brings you closer to mastering your fears.\n\nAnd always, trust in yourself. Believe that you have the strength within to overcome any obstacle. For in the end, it is your own inner light that will guide you through the darkest of times.\n\nRemember, even the greatest warriors once knew fear. But they did not let it control them. They used it as fuel to become stronger, wiser, and more compassionate.\n\nSo, face your fears with\u5c0a\u4e25 and determination. And when you do, you will find that you are no longer defined by them. Instead, you will be defined by your bravery and your resilience.\n\nMay the force be with you, always."
