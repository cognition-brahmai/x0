        "content": "Alright, I have this task to filter out emails from john.doe@example.com that contain the keyword \"project\". I've been provided with some functions to choose from, and I need to pick the right one along with the correct parameters.\n\nFirst, let's look at the available functions:\n\n1. **document_search**:\n\n- This function helps in finding specific documents by turning the user's query into search terms and filters.\n\n- It has parameters like `search_terms`, `date_range` with `begin` and `end`.\n\n2. **email_filter**:\n\n- This function is designed to filter emails based on certain criteria.\n\n- It has parameters like `sender`, `subject_keywords`, and `body_keywords`.\n\n3. **csv_analytics**:\n\n- This function is useful for performing various operations like counts and aggregations on CSV data.\n\n- It has parameters like `action` and `filters`.\n\nGiven the user's command is to \"Filter out emails from john.doe@example.com containing the keyword 'project'\", it seems like we need to filter emails based on the sender and the content of the emails.\n\nLooking at the functions, **email_filter** seems the most appropriate because it's specifically designed for filtering emails based on sender and keywords in the subject or body.\n\nNow, let's see what parameters we need to provide for **email_filter**:\n\n- **sender**: The email address of the sender, which is john.doe@example.com.\n\n- **subject_keywords**: A list of potential keywords in the subject line.\n\n- **body_keywords**: A list of potential keywords in the body of the email.\n\nThe user's command mentions \"containing the keyword 'project'\". It doesn't specify whether this keyword is in the subject or the body, so to be comprehensive, we might want to include it in both `subject_keywords` and `body_keywords`.\n\nHowever, since emails can have the keyword in either the subject or the body, and perhaps even both, we should consider that the filter might need to look for the keyword in both places.\n\nBut looking at the parameters, `subject_keywords` and `body_keywords` are separate, so we can provide the keyword in both lists to ensure that emails with the keyword in either place are captured.\n\nWait, but the user's command is to filter emails from a specific sender that contain the keyword \"project\" anywhere in the email. It doesn't specify whether the keyword should be in the subject or the body, just that it's somewhere in the email.\n\nSo, to cover both possibilities, I think it's safe to include \"project\" in both `subject_keywords` and `body_keywords`.\n\nAlso, since the sender is specified as john.doe@example.com, we'll set the `sender` parameter to that value.\n\nLet me think about whether there are any other parameters or considerations.\n\nThe **email_filter** function doesn't seem to have any other parameters that are relevant to this specific query.\n\nI don't think date ranges or anything like that are mentioned in the user's command, so we can stick with just the sender and the keywords.\n\nAlright, so summarizing:\n\n- Function: **email_filter**\n\n- Parameters:\n\n- sender: john.doe@example.com\n\n- subject_keywords: [\"project\"]\n\n- body_keywords: [\"project\"]\n\nI think that should cover what the user is asking for.\n\nJust to double-check, the user wants to filter out emails from john.doe@example.com that contain the keyword \"project\". By setting both `subject_keywords` and `body_keywords` to [\"project\"], the filter should capture emails where \"project\" appears either in the subject or the body, or both.\n\nI believe this is the correct approach.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo address the user's request to filter out emails from john.doe@example.com containing the keyword \"project,\" the appropriate function to use is `email_filter`. This function allows for specifying the sender and keywords present in either the subject or the body of the emails.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Function**: Select `email_filter` as it is designed specifically for filtering emails based on sender and keywords.\n2. **Set Sender Parameter**: Set the `sender` parameter to \"john.doe@example.com\" to filter emails from this specific sender.\n3. **Include Keywords**: Since the keyword \"project\" could be in either the subject or the body of the email, include it in both `subject_keywords` and `body_keywords` parameters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```yaml\nfunction: email_filter\nparams:\n  sender: john.doe@example.com\n  subject_keywords:\n    - project\n  body_keywords:\n    - project\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Selection**: `email_filter` is chosen for its specificity in handling email filtering based on given criteria.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `sender`: Specifies the email address of the sender as \"john.doe@example.com\".\n  - `subject_keywords`: Includes the keyword \"project\" to filter emails with this term in the subject.\n  - `body_keywords`: Includes the keyword \"project\" to filter emails with this term in the body.\n- **Comprehensive Filtering**: By including the keyword in both subject and body parameters, the filter ensures that any email from the specified sender containing the keyword in either or both places is captured."
