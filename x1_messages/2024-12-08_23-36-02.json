        "content": "Wales is part of Great Britain due to historical and political reasons. Great Britain is the island that comprises England, Scotland, and Wales. Wales has been legally and politically united with England since the 16th century, and together they form the country of England and Wales. Scotland was united with England and Wales in 1707 to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. Therefore, Wales is an integral part of Great Britain both geographically and politically."
