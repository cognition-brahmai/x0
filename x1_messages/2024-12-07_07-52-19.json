        "content": "Ah, that's a great question! So, you're asking about a younger English singer-songwriter who worked with Elton John on a song called 'Merry Christmas'. Let me think about this. Elton John has collaborated with many artists over the years, so it might take a minute to pinpoint exactly who that is.\n\nI know that Elton John is a legend in the music industry, and he's collaborated with a lot of talented artists from different generations. 'Merry Christmas' is a song that Elton John has been involved with, but I'm not immediately recalling who the specific collaborator is in this case.\n\nMaybe I should look into some of Elton John's recent collaborations to see who might fit the description. I remember that he has worked with artists like Leon Russell, Kiki Dee, and even more recently with artists like John Legend and Miley Cyrus. But I'm not sure if any of them worked with him on a song specifically titled 'Merry Christmas'.\n\nWait a minute, Elton John is famous for his Christmas songs, like 'Step into Christmas' and 'Blue Christmas'. Maybe 'Merry Christmas' is another one of his holiday tunes, and perhaps he collaborated with someone on it.\n\nLet me try to recall if there was a younger English singer-songwriter who worked with him on a Christmas song. Maybe someone like Ed Sheeran or someone in that genre?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's another artist from the UK that I might not be as familiar with. It's possible that it's someone who is rising in the music industry and collaborated with Elton John to gain more exposure.\n\nAnother thought: Elton John has been involved in charity songs and collaborations for various causes, so maybe 'Merry Christmas' is part of a charity project involving younger artists.\n\nI'm going to take a guess here. Is it George Ezra? He's an English singer-songwriter who has gained popularity in recent years, and his style might align well with Elton John's. But I'm not sure if they've worked together on a Christmas song.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's James Blunt or someone in that genre. But again, I'm not positive about that.\n\nWait, maybe it's someone like Ella Eyre or Passenger? I'm really not sure.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the style of 'Merry Christmas'. Is it a pop song, a rock song, or a more traditional Christmas tune?\n\nIf it's a Christmas song, it might be more likely to be a collaboration with another artist who specializes in that genre.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'Merry Christmas' is part of a broader album or project that Elton John worked on with multiple artists.\n\nI'm a bit stumped here. Maybe I should try to look up some information about Elton John's collaborations, specifically around Christmas songs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 'Merry Christmas' is a song that Elton John has covered or performed with another artist, but I don't recall any specific collaboration off the top of my head.\n\nWait, maybe it's Carla Thomas. She collaborated with Elton John on the song 'Old Rockin' Birthday', but that's not a Christmas song.\n\nAnother thought: Elton John and Rod Stewart did a duet on 'Merry Xmas to You', but Rod Stewart is not exactly a younger artist compared to Elton John.\n\nHmm, maybe it's actually a different song title. Could it be 'Merry Christmas Miracles'? I think that's an album by Elton John, but I don't recall a specific collaboration on that album.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a song titled 'Merry Christmas' that Elton John has worked on with a younger artist.\n\nI'm going to take another guess: is it John Legend? I know Elton John and John Legend have worked together on duets, but I'm not sure about a Christmas song.\n\nWait, maybe it's 'Merry Christmas' by Kazua Uchimura featuring Elton John. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a song where Elton John made a guest appearance or provided backing vocals.\n\nI'm sorry, but I'm having trouble recalling the specific artist you're referring to. Maybe if I think about the release date or any other details related to the song, it might help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a song that was released digitally or on streaming platforms, which might not be as widely known.\n\nI'm going to make one last attempt. Is it Levante? I recall Elton John collaborating with Levante on some songs, but I don't think it was for a Christmas tune.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a collaboration with another artist from the UK that I'm not as familiar with.\n\nI'm really not sure about this one. Maybe I need to do some research to find out who the English singer-songwriter is that worked with Elton John on 'Merry Christmas'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a song that was released for a movie or a TV show, and Elton John collaborated with a younger artist on it.\n\nI'm hitting a blank here. Maybe you could provide a bit more context or check the details of the song to see if that rings any bells?\n\nI appreciate your patience with me on this. I'm doing my best to recall or figure out who this artist might be.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\text{[No specific answer provided due to the nature of the question]} \\]"
