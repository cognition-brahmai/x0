        "content": "So I've got this problem here about families owning cats and dogs. It says that 50% of families own a cat, 40% own a dog, and 20% own both a cat and a dog. I need to find out what percentage of families own either a cat or a dog or both.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. It's about sets of families owning pets, and it involves percentages. I think this is a problem related to set theory, probably involving the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nSo, recalling the principle of inclusion-exclusion for two sets, the formula to find the total percentage of families that own either a cat or a dog or both is:\n\nPercentage owning cat or dog = Percentage owning cat + Percentage owning dog - Percentage owning both.\n\nMakes sense, because if you just add the percentages of cat owners and dog owners, you're double-counting those who own both, so you need to subtract the percentage that owns both to get the total.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n50% (cat owners) + 40% (dog owners) - 20% (both) = 70%.\n\nSo, 70% of families own either a cat or a dog or both.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using Venn diagrams?\n\nYes, Venn diagrams can be helpful here. Let's visualize this.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents cat owners, and the other represents dog owners.\n\n- The cat owners' circle is 50% of families.\n\n- The dog owners' circle is 40% of families.\n\n- The overlapping area, which represents families that own both a cat and a dog, is 20%.\n\nSo, the total area covered by either or both circles would be the sum of the individual areas minus the overlapping area.\n\nThat is again 50% + 40% - 20% = 70%.\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any possibility of families that don't own either a cat or a dog. The problem doesn't mention anything about families that don't own any pets, so I assume that's possible.\n\nBut since the question is only about families that own either a cat or a dog or both, and it's asking for the percentage of such families, I think 70% is the answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are families that own other pets, but the problem specifically mentions only cats and dogs, so I think it's safe to ignore other pets for this calculation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use probabilities or proportions. If I consider the whole town as 100 families for simplicity, then:\n\n- 50 families own a cat.\n\n- 40 families own a dog.\n\n- 20 families own both.\n\nSo, the number of families that own only a cat would be 50 - 20 = 30.\n\nThe number of families that own only a dog would be 40 - 20 = 20.\n\nAnd the number that owns both is 20.\n\nSo, the total number of families that own either a cat or a dog or both would be 30 + 20 + 20 = 70.\n\nWhich again confirms the earlier result.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The percentage of families that own either a cat or a dog or both is 70%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70\\%} \\]"
