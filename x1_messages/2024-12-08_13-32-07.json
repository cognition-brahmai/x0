        "content": "So in this class, there are 40 students in total. Out of these, 60% have brown eyes, 30% have blue eyes, and the rest have green eyes. The question is asking how many more students have brown eyes compared to blue eyes.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many students have brown eyes and how many have blue eyes. Then, I can subtract the number of blue-eyed students from the number of brown-eyed students to find the difference.\n\nLet's start by calculating the number of brown-eyed students. Since 60% of the class has brown eyes, I can find this number by calculating 60% of 40.\n\nTo calculate 60% of 40, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply by the total number of students.\n\n60% = 0.60\n\nSo, 0.60 \u00d7 40 = 24 students have brown eyes.\n\nNext, I'll find the number of blue-eyed students. 30% of the class has blue eyes.\n\n30% = 0.30\n\n0.30 \u00d7 40 = 12 students have blue eyes.\n\nNow, to find how many more students have brown eyes than blue eyes, I'll subtract the number of blue-eyed students from the number of brown-eyed students.\n\n24 (brown) - 12 (blue) = 12\n\nSo, there are 12 more students with brown eyes than blue eyes.\n\nWait a minute, the problem also mentions that the remaining students have green eyes. Although it's not directly relevant to the question, I can check how many students have green eyes to ensure all percentages add up correctly.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the percentages:\n\nBrown eyes: 60%\n\nBlue eyes: 30%\n\nTotal percentage for brown and blue eyes: 60% + 30% = 90%\n\nTherefore, the remaining percentage for green eyes is 100% - 90% = 10%.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of students with green eyes.\n\n10% of 40 students:\n\n10% = 0.10\n\n0.10 \u00d7 40 = 4 students have green eyes.\n\nJust to double-check, let's add up all the students:\n\nBrown-eyed: 24\n\nBlue-eyed: 12\n\nGreen-eyed: 4\n\nTotal: 24 + 12 + 4 = 40, which matches the total number of students.\n\nSo, my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, there are 12 more students with brown eyes than blue eyes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
