To find that, we can multiply 150 by 0.20.\n\nTip = 150 * 0.20 = $30.\n\nNow, add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount.\n\nTotal amount = bill + tip = 150 + 30 = $180.\n\nThere are 6 people in the group, and they want to split the total amount evenly.\n\nSo, each person should pay:\n\nAmount per person = total amount / number of people = 180 / 6 = $30.\n\nTherefore, each person should pay $30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
