Many people mistakenly believe it to be Sydney or Melbourne, but Canberra was specifically chosen to be the capital to represent a compromise between these two larger cities. It's located in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), which is surrounded by the state of New South Wales. So, if you're ever in Australia and someone asks about the capital, remember it's Canberra!"
