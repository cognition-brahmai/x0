        "content": "So I have this question about probabilities in a standard deck of 52 playing cards. I need to find out the probability of drawing a pair of cards with the same value, like two aces or two fives, and so on. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's in a standard deck. There are 52 cards, divided into 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 ranks: ace through 10, and then jack, queen, and king. So, there are 4 of each rank in the deck.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the probability of drawing a pair of cards with the same value. I assume that means two cards of the same rank, like two aces, two kings, two sixes, etc.\n\nOkay, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to draw two cards from a deck of 52.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 cards out of 52 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(52, 2) = \\frac{52!}{2!(52-2)!} = \\frac{52 \\times 51}{2} = 1326\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 1326 possible pairs of cards that can be drawn from the deck.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, that is, the number of ways to draw two cards of the same rank.\n\nThere are 13 ranks in total (ace through king), and for each rank, there are 4 cards (one from each suit). The number of ways to choose 2 cards from the 4 of the same rank is:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, for each rank, there are 6 possible pairs.\n\nSince there are 13 ranks, the total number of favorable outcomes is:\n\n\\[\n13 \\times 6 = 78\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a pair of cards with the same value is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{78}{1326} = \\frac{3}{51} = \\frac{1}{17}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it this way: the first card can be any card from the deck, so there are 52 possibilities for the first card. Then, for the second card, to have the same value as the first, there are 3 possibilities (since there are 4 cards of each rank, and one has already been drawn).\n\nSo, the probability would be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{52}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51} = \\frac{3}{51} = \\frac{1}{17}\n\\]\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to look at this to confirm?\n\nLet me consider that in a deck of 52 cards, there are 13 ranks and 4 suits. When drawing two cards, the probability that they have the same rank.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability that the second card matches the rank of the first card.\n\nFirst card: any card, so probability 1.\n\nSecond card: must match the rank of the first card. There are 3 matching cards left out of the remaining 51 cards.\n\nSo again, probability is 1 \u00d7 (3/51) = 3/51 = 1/17.\n\nOkay, this confirms the earlier result.\n\nLet me see if there's another approach, maybe using permutations or something else.\n\nSuppose I consider the order in which the cards are drawn. Does that change anything?\n\nIf order matters, then the total number of possible outcomes would be 52 \u00d7 51 = 2652.\n\nFor favorable outcomes, for each rank, there are 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 ordered pairs (since first card can be any of the 4, and second any of the remaining 3).\n\nWith 13 ranks, that's 13 \u00d7 12 = 156 favorable ordered pairs.\n\nSo, the probability would be 156 / 2652 = 156 \u00f7 2652.\n\nSimplifying, 156 \u00f7 12 = 13, and 2652 \u00f7 12 = 221, so 13/221.\n\nBut 13 divided by 221 is still 1/17.\n\nSo, again, the same result.\n\nAlright, it seems consistent across different methods.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a pair of cards with the same value from a standard deck of 52 playing cards is 1/17.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{17}} \\]\n"
