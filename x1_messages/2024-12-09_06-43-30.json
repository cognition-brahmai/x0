        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many people in the city own cars. The city has a population of 500,000 people, and 40% of them own cars. So, to find the number of car owners, we calculate 40% of 500,000.\n\nLet me do that calculation:\n\n40% of 500,000 is 0.4 multiplied by 500,000.\n\n0.4 \u00d7 500,000 = 200,000.\n\nSo, there are 200,000 car owners in the city.\n\nNext, we're told that each car produces an average of 4 tons of CO2 emissions per year. To find the total CO2 emissions from all the cars, we need to multiply the number of cars by the emissions per car.\n\nSo, total emissions = number of cars \u00d7 emissions per car.\n\nThat would be:\n\n200,000 cars \u00d7 4 tons/car = 800,000 tons.\n\nTherefore, the cars in this city produce 800,000 tons of CO2 emissions annually.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, 40% of 500,000:\n\n500,000 \u00d7 0.4 = 200,000 car owners.\n\nEach car produces 4 tons of CO2 per year.\n\nSo, 200,000 cars \u00d7 4 tons/car = 800,000 tons.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about it in smaller numbers to verify.\n\nSuppose there are 100 people, and 40% own cars, that's 40 car owners.\n\nIf each car produces 4 tons of CO2, then total emissions would be 40 \u00d7 4 = 160 tons.\n\nSimilarly, for 500,000 people, it should be 200,000 cars \u00d7 4 tons = 800,000 tons.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the emissions per person and then multiply by the population, but since only 40% own cars, we have to account for that.\n\nSo, emissions per person: 4 tons/car \u00d7 40% = 1.6 tons/person.\n\nThen, total emissions: 1.6 tons/person \u00d7 500,000 people = 800,000 tons.\n\nWait, that's the same result.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that only car owners emit CO2 from their cars, then the non-car owners don't contribute to these emissions.\n\nSo, only the 200,000 car owners are emitting CO2 from their cars.\n\nEach emitting 4 tons per year, so total is 800,000 tons.\n\nI think that's accurate.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor we should account for.\n\nAre there perhaps multiple cars per owner? The question says \"own cars,\" which could imply that some owners have more than one car.\n\nBut it doesn't specify that. It just says 40% own cars, and each car emits 4 tons per year.\n\nSo, perhaps it's assuming one car per owner.\n\nAlternatively, if some owners have multiple cars, we would need more information to account for that.\n\nBut based on the information given, we'll assume one car per owner.\n\nTherefore, the total emissions are 200,000 cars \u00d7 4 tons/car = 800,000 tons per year.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this is just the emissions from cars, and the city may have other sources of emissions as well, such as industries, public transport, etc.\n\nBut the question is specifically about car emissions, so we don't need to consider those.\n\nIn conclusion, the cars in this city produce 800,000 tons of CO2 emissions annually.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{800000} \\]"
