        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\nHere's a Java program that implements the bubble sort algorithm on an array of integers:\n\n```java\npublic class BubbleSort {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] array = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};\n        bubbleSort(array);\n        System.out.println(\"Sorted array: \");\n        for (int value : array) {\n            System.out.print(value + \" \");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void bubbleSort(int[] array) {\n        int n = array.length;\n        boolean swapped;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {\n            swapped = false;\n            for (int j = 0; j < n - 1 - i; j++) {\n                if (array[j] > array[j + 1]) {\n                    // Swap array[j] and array[j+1]\n                    int temp = array[j];\n                    array[j] = array[j + 1];\n                    array[j + 1] = temp;\n                    swapped = true;\n                }\n            }\n            // If no two elements were swapped by inner loop, then break\n            if (!swapped) {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Main Method:**\n   - We define an array of integers to be sorted.\n   - We call the `bubbleSort` method to sort the array.\n   - Finally, we print the sorted array.\n\n2. **Bubble Sort Method:**\n   - We get the length of the array.\n   - We use a boolean variable `swapped` to optimize the algorithm. If no swaps are made in a pass, the array is already sorted, and we can terminate early.\n   - We have two nested loops:\n     - The outer loop runs from the start of the array to the end, decreasing by one each time because the largest element is bubbled to the end in each pass.\n     - The inner loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n   - After each pass of the inner loop, the largest unsorted element is moved to its correct position.\n\nThis implementation includes a simple optimization to stop early if the array becomes sorted before completing all the passes, which can improve performance slightly for nearly sorted arrays."
