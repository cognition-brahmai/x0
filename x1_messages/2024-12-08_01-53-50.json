A challenge!\nBut I'll try.\n\nHere's my attempt:\n\nAaa ooo\nEchoes in the void\nSilent whispers\n\nIn this haiku, \"Aaa\" and \"ooo\" are the two words with no consonants. The rest of the poem tries to create a mood that fits with these vowel sounds, suggesting something ethereal or otherworldly.\n\nRemember, in haiku, it's traditional to have a 5-7-5 syllable structure, but in English, people often adapt this to fit the mood or style. In this case, \"Aaa ooo\" could be considered as taking up the first line, \"Echoes in the void\" the second, and \"Silent whispers\" the third, roughly fitting the syllable pattern.\n\nI hope this meets the requirements! If you have any other requests or need further assistance, feel free to ask."
