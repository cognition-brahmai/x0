        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a jar with 4 red marbles, 6 blue marbles, and 10 green marbles. I need to find the probability of picking a red marble followed by a blue marble without replacing the first one. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of marbles in the jar. There are 4 red, 6 blue, and 10 green, so total marbles are 4 + 6 + 10 = 20 marbles.\n\nNow, the probability of picking a red marble first. Since there are 4 red marbles out of 20 total, the probability is 4/20, which simplifies to 1/5.\n\nAfter picking a red marble and not replacing it, the total number of marbles left in the jar is 19. Now, I need to pick a blue marble. There are still 6 blue marbles because I only removed a red one.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a blue marble next is 6/19.\n\nTo find the overall probability of both events happening in sequence\u2014first picking a red marble and then a blue marble\u2014I need to multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\nSo, it's (1/5) * (6/19).\n\nLet's calculate that: 1/5 is 0.2, and 6/19 is approximately 0.3158. Multiplying them gives about 0.06316.\n\nBut maybe it's better to keep it as a fraction.\n\nSo, (1/5) * (6/19) = (1*6)/(5*19) = 6/95.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 6/95.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick 2 marbles out of 20 is C(20,2), which is (20*19)/2 = 190.\n\nThe number of ways to pick a red followed by a blue without replacement would be the number of ways to pick one red out of four and then one blue out of six.\n\nBut since the order matters here (first red, then blue), I should consider permutations.\n\nThe number of ways to pick a red first is 4, and then a blue is 6, so 4*6 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 24/190, which simplifies to 12/95.\n\nWait, that's different from what I got earlier.\n\nHold on, maybe I messed up.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf I consider the sequence: first red, then blue, without replacement.\n\nThe probability of first pick being red is 4/20 = 1/5.\n\nThen, the probability of second pick being blue, given that the first was red, is 6/19.\n\nSo, the combined probability is (1/5)*(6/19) = 6/95.\n\nBut when I thought about it using permutations, I got 12/95.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the permutations approach.\n\nWait, in permutations, the number of ways to pick a red first and then a blue is 4 options for red and 6 for blue, so 4*6=24.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick any two marbles in sequence without replacement is 20*19=380.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be 24/380 = 6/95.\n\nOkay, now that matches the first method.\n\nI must have mistakenly used combinations instead of permutations earlier.\n\nSo, the correct probability is indeed 6/95.\n\nLet me confirm this another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the probability as the probability of picking red first and then blue, considering the reduction in total marbles after the first pick.\n\nWhich is exactly what I did initially: (4/20)*(6/19) = 6/95.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the order doesn't matter, but in this case, order does matter because it's specified \"red followed by blue.\"\n\nSo, yeah, I think 6/95 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another approach.\n\nSuppose I use the concept of conditional probability.\n\nThe probability of picking a blue marble given that a red marble has already been picked.\n\nWe know that P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A).\n\nHere, A is picking a red first, and B is picking a blue second.\n\nWe already have P(A) = 4/20 = 1/5.\n\nP(B|A) = 6/19.\n\nTherefore, P(A and B) = (1/5)*(6/19) = 6/95.\n\nSame as before.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red marble followed by a blue marble without replacement is 6/95.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{6}{95}} \\]"
