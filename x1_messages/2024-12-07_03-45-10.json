        "content": "This is a classic problem known as the Monty Hall problem. Let's think through this step by step.\n\nInitially, there are three doors: Door 1, Door 2, and Door 3. Behind one door is a car, and behind the other two are goats. You choose Door 1.\n\nThe host, who knows what's behind each door, opens Door 3 to reveal a goat. Now, the host asks if you want to switch your choice to Door 2 or stick with Door 1.\n\nFirst, let's consider the probabilities at the beginning:\n\n- Probability that the car is behind Door 1: 1/3\n\n- Probability that the car is behind Door 2: 1/3\n\n- Probability that the car is behind Door 3: 1/3\n\nNow, the host opens Door 3 to reveal a goat. This action gives us new information.\n\nSince the host always opens a door with a goat and never reveals the car, we need to consider how this affects the probabilities.\n\nLet's think about what the host's action means:\n\n- If the car was behind Door 1 (your initial choice), the host can open either Door 2 or Door 3, both having goats.\n\n- If the car was behind Door 2, the host must open Door 3, since Door 1 has a goat.\n\n- If the car was behind Door 3, the host must open Door 2.\n\nBut in this case, the host opened Door 3 to reveal a goat.\n\nNow, we need to update our probabilities based on this new information.\n\nLet's use conditional probability to calculate the updated probabilities.\n\nFirst, the probability that the car is behind Door 1 given that the host opened Door 3.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that the car is behind Door 2 given that the host opened Door 3.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- C1: Car behind Door 1\n\n- C2: Car behind Door 2\n\n- C3: Car behind Door 3\n\n- H3: Host opens Door 3\n\nWe need to find P(C1|H3) and P(C2|H3).\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(C1|H3) = [P(H3|C1) * P(C1)] / P(H3)\n\nP(C2|H3) = [P(H3|C2) * P(C2)] / P(H3)\n\nFirst, we need to find P(H3|C1), P(H3|C2), and P(H3).\n\nGiven that the host always opens a door with a goat and never opens the door with the car:\n\n- If C1 is true, the host can choose to open either Door 2 or Door 3, both having goats. Assuming the host chooses randomly between them, P(H3|C1) = 1/2.\n\n- If C2 is true, the host must open Door 3, since Door 1 has a goat and Door 2 has the car. So, P(H3|C2) = 1.\n\n- If C3 is true, the host must open Door 2, since Door 1 has a goat and Door 3 has the car. So, P(H3|C3) = 0.\n\nNow, P(H3) is the total probability of the host opening Door 3, which can be calculated as:\n\nP(H3) = P(H3|C1)*P(C1) + P(H3|C2)*P(C2) + P(H3|C3)*P(C3)\n\nGiven that initially P(C1) = P(C2) = P(C3) = 1/3,\n\nP(H3) = (1/2)*(1/3) + (1)*(1/3) + (0)*(1/3) = (1/6) + (1/3) + 0 = 1/6 + 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2\n\nNow, plug these back into Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(C1|H3) = ( (1/2)*(1/3) ) / (1/2) = (1/6) / (1/2) = 1/3\n\nP(C2|H3) = ( (1)*(1/3) ) / (1/2) = (1/3) / (1/2) = 2/3\n\nSo, after the host opens Door 3, the probability that the car is behind Door 1 remains 1/3, and the probability that the car is behind Door 2 increases to 2/3.\n\nTherefore, you should switch to Door 2, as it has a higher probability of having the car (2/3 compared to 1/3 for Door 1).\n\nAnother way to think about it is that by switching, you effectively get to choose both Door 2 and Door 3, but since Door 3 has been revealed to have a goat, switching to Door 2 gives you the combined probability of Door 2 and Door 3, which is 2/3.\n\nSticking with Door 1 keeps your original probability of 1/3.\n\nHence, switching doubles your chances of winning the car.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Switch to Door 2}} \\]"
