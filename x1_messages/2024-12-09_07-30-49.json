This tool is useful in finding an appropriate list of sites that may or may not include the answer to the user's question.\nSiteReader[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkPicker[input]: Extract links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nNLPModel[input]: Question answering language model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a #E[n] variable, e.g. What color is the cat, given #E1?\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n#E1 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of #E1]\n#E2 = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context #E1\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2019 and what was their most famous work?"

        "content": "Alright, I need to find out who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2019 and what their most famous work is. I think the best way to start is by searching the web for this information. So, my first plan is to use the WebSearch tool to look up \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2019 winner.\"\n\nPlan: Search for the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2019.\n#E1 = WebSearch[\"Nobel Prize in Literature 2019 winner\"]\n\nOnce I have the search results, I'll need to pick the most relevant links to visit and read for more information. So, my next plan is to use the LinkPicker tool on the search results from #E1.\n\nPlan: Extract relevant links from the search results.\n#E2 = LinkPicker[#E1]\n\nAfter picking the links, I'll need to read the content of those websites to find the answer. For that, I'll use the SiteReader tool on the links from #E2.\n\nPlan: Read the content of the selected links.\n#E3 = SiteReader[#E2]\n\nNow, with the text content from the websites, I can use the NLPModel to answer the question based on this context.\n\nPlan: Use the NLPModel to identify the winner and their most famous work.\n#E4 = NLPModel[\"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2019 and what was their most famous work? Given context: #E3\"]\n\nFinally, the answer will be in #E4.\n\nFinal Answer: #E4\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo solve this problem, we will create a step-by-step plan to determine who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2019 and identify their most famous work. We will utilize a series of tools to achieve this:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **WebSearch**: Initiate a web search to find the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature for the year 2019.\n2. **LinkPicker**: Extract relevant links from the search results for further investigation.\n3. **SiteReader**: Read the content from the selected links to gather detailed information.\n4. **NLPModel**: Use a natural language processing model to interpret the collected data and answer the specific question.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```plaintext\nPlan: Search for the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2019.\n#E1 = WebSearch[\"Nobel Prize in Literature 2019 winner\"]\n\nPlan: Extract relevant links from the search results.\n#E2 = LinkPicker[#E1]\n\nPlan: Read the content of the selected links.\n#E3 = SiteReader[#E2]\n\nPlan: Use the NLPModel to identify the winner and their most famous work.\n#E4 = NLPModel[\"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2019 and what was their most famous work? Given context: #E3\"]\n\nFinal Answer: #E4\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **WebSearch**: This tool performs an internet search to find information about the 2019 Nobel Prize in Literature winner. It returns a list of search results that may include articles, news, and official Nobel Prize pages.\n\n2. **LinkPicker**: From the search results obtained in #E1, this tool extracts the most relevant links that are likely to contain the necessary information. This step helps in focusing on high-quality sources.\n\n3. **SiteReader**: This tool fetches and reads the content from the links selected in #E2. It converts the web pages into plain text, making the information accessible for further processing.\n\n4. **NLPModel**: Using the context gathered from #E3, this natural language processing model answers the specific question about the winner and their most famous work. It processes the text to extract the required information accurately.\n\nBy following this structured approach, we ensure that the information is retrieved efficiently and reliably, providing an accurate answer to the user's question."
