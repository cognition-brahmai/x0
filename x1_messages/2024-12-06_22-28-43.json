        "content": "As of my last update, the African continent is divided into 54 recognized sovereign countries. However, it's essential to note that this number can change due to geopolitical events or alterations in national boundaries. Additionally, there are several territories and regions with varying degrees of autonomy or disputed statuses that may not be universally recognized as independent countries. For the most current and precise information, I recommend consulting the latest sources from international organizations such as the United Nations."
