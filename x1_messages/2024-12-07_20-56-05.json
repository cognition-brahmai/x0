        "content": "So the farmer has a rectangular field that's 300 meters long and 150 meters wide, and he wants to fence the whole thing. To figure out how much fencing he needs, I think we have to calculate the perimeter of the field. The perimeter is the total distance around the edge of a shape.\n\nFor a rectangle, the perimeter is calculated by adding up all the sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the given dimensions:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (300 + 150) = 2 \\times 450 = 900 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nSo, the farmer needs 900 meters of fencing to go around the entire field.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{900} \\]"
