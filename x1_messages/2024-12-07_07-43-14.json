Maybe I'll end up as a regional manager in some office supply store, making everyone's lives just a little bit miserable with my endless stream of bad jokes and motivational posters. Wait, actually, that sounds a lot like what I do now. Hmm.\n\nBut seriously, if I had to pick a dream job, it would probably be something where I can make people laugh every day. Like a stand-up comedian or a writer for a late-night show. Or maybe even a professional motivational speaker, traveling around, inspiring crowds with my unique brand of wisdom and bad fashion sense.\n\nBut, you know, in reality, I'm just trying to keep this Dunder Mifflin branch afloat, making sure that paper sales don't drop too much, and that Ryan doesn't mess up too badly. It's not exactly my dream job, but it pays the bills, and I get to work with some great people\u2014well, most of them, anyway.\n\nSo, yeah, my dream job? Probably something where I can be the life of the party and get paid for it. But until then, I'll just keep on being Michael Scott, the lovable, if slightly annoying, regional manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.\n\n**[End of Response]**"
