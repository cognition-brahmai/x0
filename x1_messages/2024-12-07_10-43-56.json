        "content": "So I have this problem here about a fruit basket. It says there are 5 apples, 6 oranges, and 4 bananas. And I need to find the probability of picking an apple or a banana randomly from the basket. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability means. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either an apple or a banana.\n\nLet me first find out the total number of fruits in the basket. There are 5 apples, 6 oranges, and 4 bananas. So, total fruits would be 5 + 6 + 4, which equals 15 fruits.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of apples plus the number of bananas, which is 5 + 4, making 9.\n\nSo, the probability of picking an apple or a banana should be the number of apples and bananas divided by the total number of fruits, which is 9/15.\n\nBut I can simplify that fraction. Both 9 and 15 can be divided by 3. So, 9 divided by 3 is 3, and 15 divided by 3 is 5. Therefore, the simplified fraction is 3/5.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? I know that probability can also be expressed in decimals or percentages. So, 3/5 is equal to 0.6, or 60%. But I think the question is expecting the answer in fraction form, so 3/5 should be fine.\n\nLet me double-check if I missed anything. Is there any other way this could be interpreted? Maybe using probabilities of individual events and adding them up.\n\nWell, the probability of picking an apple is 5/15, and the probability of picking a banana is 4/15. So, if I add those up, 5/15 + 4/15 equals 9/15, which is the same as before. Again, simplifying to 3/5.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, I'm confident now that 3/5 is the correct probability.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any overlap between apples and bananas that I need to account for, like if there were fruits that are both apples and bananas, but that doesn't make sense in reality, so I don't think that's applicable here.\n\nAlso, since the problem specifies \"randomly pick a fruit without looking,\" it means every fruit has an equal chance of being picked, so my initial approach is correct.\n\nI think that's all I need to do for this problem. The probability of picking an apple or a banana is 3/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{5}} \\]"
