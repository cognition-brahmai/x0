The expression is:\n\n((6 - 2)^2 * 3 + 12 / 4) - 5 * 4\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n(6 - 2) = 4\n\nNow the expression becomes:\n\n(4^2 * 3 + 12 / 4) - 5 * 4\n\nNext, exponents:\n\n4^2 = 16\n\nNow it's:\n\n(16 * 3 + 12 / 4) - 5 * 4\n\nNow, multiplication and division from left to right:\n\n16 * 3 = 48\n\n12 / 4 = 3\n\nSo now it's:\n\n(48 + 3) - 5 * 4\n\nAddition inside the parentheses:\n\n48 + 3 = 51\n\nNow it's:\n\n51 - 5 * 4\n\nNext, multiplication:\n\n5 * 4 = 20\n\nNow it's:\n\n51 - 20\n\nFinally, subtraction:\n\n51 - 20 = 31\n\nSo the answer is 31."
