        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 people in the group, and twice as many women as men. So, if I let the number of men be M, then the number of women should be 2M, right? Because there are twice as many women as men.\n\nSo, the total number of people is men plus women, which is M + 2M = 3M. And this total is 30 people. So, 3M = 30.\n\nTo find M, I can divide both sides by 3. So, M = 30 / 3 = 10.\n\nTherefore, there are 10 men in the group.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If there are 10 men, then there should be twice as many women, which is 20 women. Total is 10 + 20 = 30, which matches the total number of people. So, yeah, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
