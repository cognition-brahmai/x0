        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 cats in a room, and each cat catches some mice. Normally, each cat catches 3 mice, but one cat is lazy and only catches 1 mouse. I need to find out how many legs there are in the room.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many mice there are in total. There are 5 cats, and 4 of them catch 3 mice each, while one cat catches only 1 mouse.\n\nSo, the number of mice caught by the 4 active cats is 4 cats * 3 mice/cat = 12 mice.\n\nThe lazy cat catches 1 mouse, so total mice are 12 + 1 = 13 mice.\n\nNow, each mouse has 4 legs, so the total number of legs from the mice is 13 mice * 4 legs/mouse = 52 legs.\n\nNext, the cats have 4 legs each, so 5 cats * 4 legs/cat = 20 legs.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to consider whether the mice are dead or not, because if they are dead, they might not have legs, or maybe they are just caught but still have their legs. The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume that the mice are still present in the room and have their legs.\n\nAdditionally, there is probably a person in the room, since someone is observing the cats and mice, but the problem might not want to include that person's legs. I'll assume only the cats and mice are in the room.\n\nSo, total legs in the room would be the legs of the cats plus the legs of the mice: 20 + 52 = 72 legs.\n\nBut let's double-check. 5 cats, each with 4 legs, that's 20 legs. 13 mice, each with 4 legs, that's 52 legs. Adding them up gives 72 legs.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]"
