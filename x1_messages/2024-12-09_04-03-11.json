        "content": "So there's a class with 30 students in total, and out of those, 16 are boys. The question is asking how many girls there are in the class. Okay, let's think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The total number of students is 30, and among them, 16 are boys. So, the rest must be girls. To find out how many girls there are, I need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of students.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nNumber of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of girls = 30 - 16\n\nNow, let's do the subtraction.\n\n30 minus 16 is 14.\n\nSo, there are 14 girls in the class.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nTotal students: 30\n\nBoys: 16\n\nGirls: 30 - 16 = 14\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as adding the number of boys and girls should give me the total number of students.\n\nSo, if there are 16 boys and 14 girls, then 16 + 14 equals 30, which matches the total number of students.\n\nSo, my answer is confirmed.\n\nTherefore, there are 14 girls in the class.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
