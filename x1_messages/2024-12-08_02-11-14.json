        "content": "So, originally, there are three friends who decide to share a pizza that has 12 slices equally among themselves. That means each of them would get 12 divided by 3, which is 4 slices each. But then, one more friend arrives, making it four friends in total. Now, they decide to share the same pizza equally among all four of them. So, to find out how many slices each person gets now, we need to divide the total number of slices, which is 12, by the new number of people, which is 4.\n\nSo, 12 slices divided by 4 people equals 3 slices per person.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that. Originally, with three friends, each would get 4 slices, since 12 divided by 3 is 4. But when a fourth friend arrives, the total number of slices remains the same, which is 12, but now they're dividing them among four people. So, 12 divided by 4 is indeed 3.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each person is getting a smaller portion now because there's one more person sharing the same pizza. So, if it was 4 slices per person for three people, now it should be less than that for four people, which makes sense because 3 is less than 4.\n\nAlso, to confirm, if each of the four friends gets 3 slices, then 4 times 3 equals 12, which is the total number of slices. So, that checks out.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Each person now gets 3 slices.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
