        "content": "So the farmer has 100 meters of fencing and he wants to enclose a rectangular area for his sheep. He's trying to maximize the area that his sheep can graze in, right? Okay, let's see how we can help him with that.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the properties of a rectangle. A rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, so if we call the length of one pair 'L' and the other pair 'W', then the perimeter P would be P = 2L + 2W. In this case, the perimeter is given as 100 meters, so 2L + 2W = 100.\n\nI can simplify that equation by dividing both sides by 2, which gives L + W = 50. That seems manageable.\n\nNow, the area A of a rectangle is A = L * W. So, I need to maximize A = L * W, given that L + W = 50.\n\nHmm, I need to express one variable in terms of the other using the perimeter equation and then substitute it into the area formula.\n\nSo, from L + W = 50, I can solve for W: W = 50 - L.\n\nThen, plug that into the area formula: A = L * (50 - L) = 50L - L\u00b2.\n\nSo, A = 50L - L\u00b2.\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in terms of L, and it's in the form A = -L\u00b2 + 50L.\n\nI know that quadratic equations graph as parabolas, and since the coefficient of L\u00b2 is negative, the parabola opens downwards, meaning it has a maximum point.\n\nTo find the maximum area, I need to find the vertex of this parabola.\n\nThe vertex form for a parabola given by y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c has its vertex at x = -b/(2a).\n\nIn this case, a = -1 and b = 50, so the length L at the vertex is L = -50/(2*(-1)) = 50/2 = 25.\n\nSo, L = 25 meters.\n\nThen, W = 50 - L = 50 - 25 = 25 meters.\n\nWait a minute, so both L and W are 25 meters? That means the rectangle is actually a square.\n\nIs that possible? I thought rectangles can be any shape as long as opposite sides are equal.\n\nBut in this case, the maximum area is achieved when the rectangle is a square.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf L = 25 and W = 25, then the area A = 25 * 25 = 625 square meters.\n\nIs there a way to get a larger area with the same perimeter?\n\nLet me try with different values.\n\nSuppose L = 30 meters, then W = 50 - 30 = 20 meters.\n\nArea A = 30 * 20 = 600 square meters.\n\nThat's less than 625.\n\nWhat if L = 20 meters, then W = 30 meters.\n\nArea A = 20 * 30 = 600 square meters again.\n\nSo, still less than 625.\n\nLet me try L = 10 meters, then W = 40 meters.\n\nArea A = 10 * 40 = 400 square meters.\n\nEven smaller.\n\nAnd if L = 5 meters, W = 45 meters.\n\nArea A = 5 * 45 = 225 square meters.\n\nThat's much smaller.\n\nIt seems like the maximum area is indeed when L = W = 25 meters.\n\nI recall that for a given perimeter, the shape that maximizes the area is a circle.\n\nBut in this case, the farmer wants a rectangular area.\n\nSo, among all rectangles with a perimeter of 100 meters, the square has the largest area.\n\nIs there a mathematical proof for that?\n\nWell, in calculus, we learn about optimization problems, and this is one of them.\n\nBut since I might not remember all the calculus details, I'll stick with the algebraic approach for now.\n\nAlternatively, I can complete the square for the quadratic equation to confirm the vertex.\n\nStarting with A = -L\u00b2 + 50L.\n\nTo complete the square:\n\nA = -(L\u00b2 - 50L)\n\nTo complete the square inside the parentheses, take half of 50, which is 25, and square it to get 625.\n\nSo, A = -(L\u00b2 - 50L + 625 - 625) = -( (L - 25)\u00b2 - 625 ) = - (L - 25)\u00b2 + 625.\n\nTherefore, the maximum area is 625 square meters when L = 25 meters.\n\nThis confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the farmer should enclose a square area of 25 meters by 25 meters to maximize the grazing area for his sheep.\n\nBut wait, is there any constraint I'm missing? For example, does the land have to be enclosed against a wall or something?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify any such constraints, so I assume it's a full enclosed area with fencing on all four sides.\n\nAlso, the farmer has exactly 100 meters of fencing, so he needs to use all of it.\n\nIs there a way to enclosure a larger area if he, say, uses the fencing more efficiently?\n\nOr if he shapes the enclosure into something other than a rectangle?\n\nBut the problem specifies a rectangular area, so I guess we're limited to that.\n\nStill, for curiosity's sake, what would be the maximum area if he could enclosure any shape?\n\nI recall that for a given perimeter, the shape that encloses the maximum area is a circle.\n\nSo, for a circle with perimeter (circumference) of 100 meters, the radius r can be found using C = 2\u03c0r = 100, so r = 100/(2\u03c0) = 50/\u03c0 meters.\n\nThen, the area A = \u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0*(50/\u03c0)\u00b2 = \u03c0*(2500/\u03c0\u00b2) = 2500/\u03c0 \u2248 796.18 square meters.\n\nThat's larger than the 625 square meters for the square.\n\nBut again, the problem specifies a rectangular area, so the maximum area is 625 square meters.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it thoroughly.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Perimeter of rectangle: 2L + 2W = 100 meters\n\n- Simplified to L + W = 50 meters\n\n- Area A = L * W = L * (50 - L) = 50L - L\u00b2\n\n- Maximum area occurs at L = 25 meters, W = 25 meters\n\n- Maximum area: 625 square meters\n\nI can also verify this by considering the second derivative in calculus, but since that might be a bit advanced for some, the algebraic approach suffices.\n\nAdditionally, I can think about it in terms of proportions.\n\nIf L is less than 25 meters, then W is more than 25 meters, but the product L*W is less than 625.\n\nSimilarly, if L is more than 25 meters, W is less than 25 meters, and again, L*W is less than 625.\n\nSo, 25 meters by 25 meters gives the maximum area.\n\nTherefore, the farmer should enclose a square area of 25 meters by 25 meters to maximize the grazing area for his sheep, which will be 625 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{625} \\]"
