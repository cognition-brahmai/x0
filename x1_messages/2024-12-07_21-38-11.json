        "content": "Yes, Australia does have a higher obesity rate compared to some other wealthy nations. According to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Australia has one of the highest obesity rates among developed countries. In 2019, approximately 31% of adults in Australia were obese, which is higher than the OECD average of around 20%. This trend is concerning and has been attributed to factors such as poor diet, sedentary lifestyles, and social and environmental influences. The Australian government has implemented various strategies to address this issue, including public health campaigns and policies aimed at promoting healthier lifestyles."
