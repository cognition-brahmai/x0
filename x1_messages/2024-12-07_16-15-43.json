        "content": "So, the car rental company has 100 cars, and they rent out 75% of them every day. We need to find out how many days it will take for them to reach a total of 10,000 rentals.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many cars they rent out each day. If they have 100 cars and rent out 75% of them daily, that means:\n\nNumber of cars rented per day = 100 cars * 75% = 100 * 0.75 = 75 cars per day.\n\nNow, we need to reach a total of 10,000 rentals. Since they rent out 75 cars each day, we can find the number of days by dividing the total rentals by the number of cars rented per day.\n\nNumber of days = Total rentals / Rentals per day = 10,000 / 75.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n10,000 divided by 75 is:\n\n10,000 \u00f7 75 = 133.333...\n\nSince they can't have a fraction of a day in this context, we'll need to round up because they'll need part of a day to reach the total.\n\nSo, it would take 134 days to reach or exceed 10,000 rentals.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider it as they rent 75 cars each day, so in 133 days, they would have rented:\n\n133 * 75 = 9,975 cars.\n\nThat's just shy of 10,000. So, on the 134th day, they'll rent out another 75 cars, bringing the total to 9,975 + 75 = 10,050, which exceeds 10,000.\n\nTherefore, it would take 134 days to reach at least 10,000 rentals.\n\nAlternatively, if they can rent out cars in fractions of a day, then 133.333... days would be the exact amount, but since we're dealing with whole days, 134 days is the answer.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{134} \\]"
