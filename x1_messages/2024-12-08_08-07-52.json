        "content": "To address the user's request, I need to extract specific information from a CSV file based on certain conditions. The user wants to extract the names and addresses of employees who earn more than $50,000 annually. Looking at the available functions, \"employee_info_extractor\" seems appropriate for this task as it is designed to extract specific information about employees from a CSV file based on given conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the fields that need to be extracted. The user is interested in the names and addresses of the employees. Therefore, the \"fields\" parameter should include \"names\" and \"addresses.\"\n\nNext, I need to set up the conditions to filter the employees. The condition specified is that the employees should earn more than $50,000 annually. Therefore, the \"conditions\" parameter should be configured to filter the \"salary\" field (assuming that's the field name for annual earnings) with the operator '>' and the value '50000.'\n\nI need to make sure that the field names match exactly with those in the CSV file. If the CSV file uses different field names, such as \"employee_name\" and \"annual_salary,\" I should adjust the field names accordingly. However, since the exact field names are not provided, I'll assume the fields are labeled \"name,\" \"address,\" and \"salary.\"\n\nAlso, I should consider the data types. The salary is a numerical value, so ensuring that the value '50000' is interpreted correctly is important. If the salary is stored as a string or with currency symbols, additional preprocessing might be needed, but for now, I'll assume it's stored as a numerical value.\n\nGiven that \"document_search\" is another available function, but it seems more geared towards searching documents based on keywords and phrases, which doesn't directly apply to extracting specific data from a CSV file based on conditions. Therefore, \"employee_info_extractor\" is the more suitable function for this task.\n\nIn summary, I will use the \"employee_info_extractor\" function with the following parameters:\n\n- fields: [\"name\", \"address\"]\n\n- conditions:\n\n  - field: \"salary\"\n\n  - operator: \">\"\n\n  - value: \"50000\"\n\nI need to ensure that the function can handle multiple fields for extraction and that the conditions are applied correctly to filter the records.\n\nFinally, I should consider if there are any additional parameters or options that might be necessary, such as specifying the CSV file path or handling headers, but since these are not mentioned in the function description, I'll assume that the function handles these aspects internally.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n```yaml\nfunction: employee_info_extractor\nparameters:\n  fields:\n    - name\n    - address\n  conditions:\n    - field: salary\n      operator: '>'\n      value: '50000'\n```\n\n"
