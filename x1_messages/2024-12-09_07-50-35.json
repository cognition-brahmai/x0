        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. Each Type A widget weighs 3 kg, and each Type B widget weighs 5 kg. The factory produced a total of 150 widgets, and the combined weight of all these widgets is 600 kg. We need to find out how many of each type were produced.\n\nFirst, I think it would be helpful to define variables for the number of each type of widget. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of Type A widgets.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of Type B widgets.\n\nNow, according to the problem, the total number of widgets is 150. So, we can write the first equation as:\n\n\\[ x + y = 150 \\]\n\nNext, the total weight of all widgets is 600 kg. Since each Type A widget weighs 3 kg and each Type B widget weighs 5 kg, we can write the second equation as:\n\n\\[ 3x + 5y = 600 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 150 \\)\n\n2. \\( 3x + 5y = 600 \\)\n\nI need to solve this system to find the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). There are a few methods to do this, such as substitution or elimination. I think I'll use the substitution method here.\n\nFirst, I can solve the first equation for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = 150 - y \\]\n\nNow, I can substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 3(150 - y) + 5y = 600 \\]\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n\\[ 450 - 3y + 5y = 600 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 450 + 2y = 600 \\]\n\nNow, subtract 450 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 2y = 150 \\]\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ y = 75 \\]\n\nSo, there are 75 Type B widgets. Now, I can plug this value back into the first equation to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = 150 - 75 = 75 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 75 Type A widgets and 75 Type B widgets.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If there are 75 Type A widgets at 3 kg each, that's \\( 75 \\times 3 = 225 \\) kg. And 75 Type B widgets at 5 kg each is \\( 75 \\times 5 = 375 \\) kg. Adding those together gives \\( 225 + 375 = 600 \\) kg, which matches the total weight given in the problem. Also, \\( 75 + 75 = 150 \\) widgets, which matches the total number of widgets. So, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Perhaps using ratios or something like that. Let's see.\n\nSuppose I consider the weight per widget for each type. Type A is 3 kg, Type B is 5 kg. The average weight per widget overall is \\( \\frac{600 \\text{ kg}}{150 \\text{ widgets}} = 4 \\) kg per widget.\n\nNow, if I think about the difference in weights:\n\n- Type A is 3 kg, which is 1 kg less than the average.\n\n- Type B is 5 kg, which is 1 kg more than the average.\n\nTo balance out to an average of 4 kg, the number of Type A widgets multiplied by 1 kg less than average should equal the number of Type B widgets multiplied by 1 kg more than average.\n\nSo, \\( x \\times 1 = y \\times 1 \\), which simplifies to \\( x = y \\). So, the number of Type A widgets equals the number of Type B widgets. Since \\( x + y = 150 \\), and \\( x = y \\), then \\( 2x = 150 \\), so \\( x = 75 \\), and \\( y = 75 \\). That matches what I found earlier.\n\nAnother way could be to use the concept of weighted averages, but I think that might complicate things more than necessary for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could use matrices to solve the system of equations, but since the system is straightforward, it might not be necessary.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other approach. Suppose I only knew the total weight and the weights of each type, but not the total number of widgets. Then the problem would be underdetermined, meaning there would be multiple solutions. But since I have both the total number and the total weight, there should be a unique solution, which is what I found.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there could be other integer solutions. For example, maybe there's a way to have different numbers of Type A and Type B widgets that still add up to 150 widgets and 600 kg. But given that the weights are 3 kg and 5 kg, and the average is 4 kg, the only combination that balances out is having equal numbers of each type.\n\nWait, is that always true? Let's see. Suppose I have \\( x \\) Type A widgets and \\( y \\) Type B widgets, with \\( x + y = 150 \\) and \\( 3x + 5y = 600 \\). From the first equation, \\( y = 150 - x \\). Plugging into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 3x + 5(150 - x) = 600 \\]\n\n\\[ 3x + 750 - 5x = 600 \\]\n\n\\[ -2x + 750 = 600 \\]\n\n\\[ -2x = -150 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 75 \\]\n\nThen \\( y = 150 - 75 = 75 \\). So, it confirms that the only solution is 75 of each type.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the difference in weight between Type A and Type B, which is 2 kg (5 kg - 3 kg), and the total weight excess is \\( 600 - 3 \\times 150 = 600 - 450 = 150 \\) kg. Then, the number of Type B widgets can be calculated as \\( \\frac{150}{2} = 75 \\), and Type A widgets would also be 75. Again, the same result.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways, and it all points to 75 Type A widgets and 75 Type B widgets.\n\nJust to make sure there are no other possible solutions, let's consider if negative numbers or non-integer numbers are possible. But since the number of widgets can't be negative or fractional, the only valid solution is x = 75 and y = 75.\n\nTherefore, the factory produced 75 Type A widgets and 75 Type B widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75 \\text{ Type A widgets and } 75 \\text{ Type B widgets}} \\]"
