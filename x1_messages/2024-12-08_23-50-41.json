        "content": "So I have this problem: a book has 250 pages, and each page has 300 words. I need to find out how many words are there in the whole book. Hmm, seems straightforward, but I should probably think it through step by step to make sure I get it right.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have to find the total number of words in the book. To do that, I know that the book is made up of pages, and each page has a certain number of words. So, if I multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page, I should get the total number of words in the book.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal words = number of pages \u00d7 number of words per page\n\nNow, plugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal words = 250 pages \u00d7 300 words per page\n\nOkay, now I just need to do the multiplication. But let me see if there's an easier way to think about this. Multiplying 250 by 300 might be a bit tricky in my head, so maybe I can break it down.\n\nI know that 250 is the same as 25 tens, or 25 \u00d7 10, and 300 is 3 \u00d7 100. So, maybe I can multiply 25 by 3, and then multiply the results by 10 and 100 respectively.\n\nLet me try that:\n\nFirst, 25 \u00d7 3 = 75\n\nNow, since 250 is 25 \u00d7 10, and 300 is 3 \u00d7 100, then:\n\n250 \u00d7 300 = (25 \u00d7 10) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 100) = (25 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (10 \u00d7 100) = 75 \u00d7 1,000 = 75,000\n\nSo, the total number of words is 75,000.\n\nWait a minute, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I can try a different method to verify.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to multiply 250 by 300 directly. I can think of 300 as 3 \u00d7 100, so:\n\n250 \u00d7 300 = 250 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 100) = (250 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 100\n\nFirst, 250 \u00d7 3 = 750\n\nThen, 750 \u00d7 100 = 75,000\n\nOkay, that matches my previous result.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I can use the fact that 250 is 25 \u00d7 10, and 300 is 30 \u00d7 10.\n\nSo, 250 \u00d7 300 = (25 \u00d7 10) \u00d7 (30 \u00d7 10) = (25 \u00d7 30) \u00d7 (10 \u00d7 10) = 750 \u00d7 100 = 75,000\n\nAgain, the same answer. That gives me more confidence.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of place value. 250 is two hundred fifty, and 300 is three hundred. Multiplying hundreds would give me thousands.\n\nWait, perhaps I can calculate it as 250 times 300.\n\nI know that 250 \u00d7 300 is the same as 250 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 100.\n\nFirst, 250 \u00d7 3 = 750\n\nThen, 750 \u00d7 100 = 75,000\n\nSame answer again.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to look at this. Maybe using division.\n\nSuppose I know the total number of words and I want to find out how many pages, or something like that. But in this case, I'm going from pages to words, so multiplication makes sense.\n\nAnother thing I could consider is to think about the units. Pages and words per page make total words.\n\nIt's like units:\n\npages \u00d7 words/page = words\n\nSo, the units confirm that multiplication is the right operation.\n\nLet me see if there's any chance that I should be adding or using another operation. No, because each page has 300 words, and there are 250 pages, so I need to add 300, 250 times, which is multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, if it was a rate or something, but in this case, it's just a straightforward multiplication.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about it in terms of exponents or powers of ten to make the multiplication easier.\n\n250 is 2.5 \u00d7 10^2, and 300 is 3 \u00d7 10^2.\n\nSo, 2.5 \u00d7 10^2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 10^2 = (2.5 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (10^2 \u00d7 10^2) = 7.5 \u00d7 10^4 = 75,000\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. It's clear that the total number of words in the book is 75,000.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about a smaller example to see if the logic holds.\n\nSuppose there are 2 pages, each with 3 words.\n\nTotal words would be 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 words.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, 250 pages \u00d7 300 words per page = 75,000 words.\n\nThe scaling makes sense because 250 is about 100 times more than 2, and 300 is 100 times more than 3, but since both are multiplied, it's 10,000 times more, but that might not be directly comparable.\n\nAnyway, I'm confident with my answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75000} \\]"
