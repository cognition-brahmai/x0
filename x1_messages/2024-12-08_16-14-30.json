        "content": "So the shipping company wants to buy new cargo ships to expand their fleet. Each ship can carry 10,000 tons and costs $30 million. They have a budget of $150 million for this expansion. I need to figure out how many ships they can buy with that money and also calculate the total extra cargo capacity they'll get.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many ships they can purchase within their budget. To do that, I'll divide the total budget by the cost per ship. So, $150 million divided by $30 million per ship.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of ships = Total budget / Cost per ship\n\nNumber of ships = $150,000,000 / $30,000,000\n\nNow, doing the division:\n\n150 divided by 30 is 5.\n\nSo, they can buy 5 ships.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total additional cargo capacity. Since each ship has a capacity of 10,000 tons, I'll multiply the number of ships by the capacity per ship.\n\nTotal capacity = Number of ships * Capacity per ship\n\nTotal capacity = 5 * 10,000 tons\n\nTotal capacity = 50,000 tons\n\nTherefore, the company can purchase 5 new cargo ships, adding a total of 50,000 tons to their current fleet's cargo capacity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe company can purchase 5 ships, adding a total of 50,000 tons to their cargo capacity."
