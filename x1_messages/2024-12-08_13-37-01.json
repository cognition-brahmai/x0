        "content": "Let's see. The company produces 1000 widgets per day, and each widget costs $10 to make. They sell each widget for $15. We need to find out their profit after 30 days.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what profit means. Profit is usually the amount of money left after subtracting the costs from the revenue. So, profit equals revenue minus cost.\n\nOkay, so I need to calculate the revenue and the cost separately and then subtract.\n\nLet's start with the cost. The company produces 1000 widgets per day, and each widget costs $10. So, the daily production cost is 1000 widgets times $10 per widget, which is $10,000 per day.\n\nNow, over 30 days, the total cost would be $10,000 per day times 30 days, which is $300,000.\n\nNext, the revenue. They sell each widget for $15. Assuming they sell all the widgets they produce, which seems likely, their daily revenue would be 1000 widgets times $15 per widget, which is $15,000 per day.\n\nOver 30 days, the total revenue would be $15,000 per day times 30 days, which is $450,000.\n\nNow, profit is revenue minus cost, so $450,000 minus $300,000, which equals $150,000.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check if there are any other costs involved. The problem only mentions the production cost per widget and the selling price. It doesn't mention any other expenses like overhead, labor, etc., so I'll assume that the only cost is the production cost.\n\nAlso, it's important to make sure that all the widgets produced are sold. The problem says they sell each widget for $15, and it doesn't specify if there's any unsold inventory, so I'll assume they sell all 1000 widgets each day.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any taxes or other deductions mentioned. The problem doesn't mention any, so I'll ignore those for now.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nDaily production cost: 1000 widgets * $10 = $10,000\n\nDaily revenue: 1000 widgets * $15 = $15,000\n\nDaily profit: $15,000 - $10,000 = $5,000\n\nTotal profit over 30 days: $5,000 * 30 = $150,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate it by finding the profit per widget and then multiplying by the number of widgets sold in 30 days.\n\nProfit per widget: Selling price - production cost = $15 - $10 = $5\n\nTotal widgets produced and sold in 30 days: 1000 widgets/day * 30 days = 30,000 widgets\n\nTotal profit: 30,000 widgets * $5/widget = $150,000\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that $150,000 is the correct profit after 30 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150000} \\]"
