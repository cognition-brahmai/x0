The concept that humans only use a small percentage of their brain capacity, often cited as 10%, is a myth. Neuroscientists have extensively studied brain activity using various techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans, which show that different parts of the brain are active during different tasks. Additionally, damage to even small areas of the brain can result in significant functional impairments, indicating that all parts of the brain serve important purposes.\n\nSimilarly, regarding DNA usage, it was once believed that only a small portion of human DNA codes for proteins, with the rest being non-coding or \"junk\" DNA. However, more recent research, such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, has shown that a large proportion of the genome is involved in regulatory functions, such as controlling gene expression. Therefore, the idea that we only use a tiny fraction of our DNA is also a misconception. Almost all of our DNA serves some purpose, even if it's not directly coding for proteins.\n\nIt's essential to approach such claims with skepticism and rely on evidence-based information from credible sources."
