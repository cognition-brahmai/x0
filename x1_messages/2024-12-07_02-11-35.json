These entities may have designated staff or contractors who periodically clean and maintain the fountain, which would include retrieving any coins or other objects that have been thrown into it.\n\nAdditionally, some fountains are part of fundraising efforts for charitable causes, and the coins collected may be periodically retrieved and counted by volunteers or organizers of the campaign.\n\nIt's worth noting that throwing coins into fountains is a popular tradition in many cultures, often associated with making wishes or paying respects. However, it's essential to consider the potential environmental impact and cleanliness of the fountain when deciding whether to participate in this practice."
