        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 4 red balls, 6 blue balls, and 5 green balls. So, total balls in the bag are 4 red plus 6 blue plus 5 green, which is 15 balls in total.\n\nThe question is, if you draw two balls from the bag without replacement, what's the probability that both balls are blue. Okay, so without replacement means that once you draw the first ball, you don't put it back before drawing the second one. That changes things a bit.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for probability. Probability of an event is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the total number of possible outcomes when drawing two balls without replacement from 15 balls. That should be the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 15. I think that's a combination, because the order doesn't matter here. So, it's \"15 choose 2.\"\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, total possible outcomes = C(15, 2) = 15! / (2!(15 - 2)!) = (15 \u00d7 14) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 105.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose 2 blue balls out of the 6 blue balls available.\n\nSo, favorable outcomes = C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6 - 2)!) = (6 \u00d7 5) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 15.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are blue is favorable outcomes divided by total possible outcomes, which is 15/105.\n\nI can simplify that fraction: 15 divided by 15 is 1, and 105 divided by 15 is 7. So, it's 1/7.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal balls: 4 red + 6 blue + 5 green = 15 balls.\n\nTotal ways to choose 2 balls out of 15: C(15, 2) = 105.\n\nWays to choose 2 blue balls out of 6: C(6, 2) = 15.\n\nSo, probability = 15/105 = 1/7.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of sequential probabilities.\n\nThe probability that the first ball drawn is blue is number of blue balls divided by total balls, which is 6/15.\n\nThen, since we're not replacing the first ball, the total balls left are 14, and blue balls left are 5.\n\nSo, the probability that the second ball is also blue given that the first one was blue is 5/14.\n\nTherefore, the combined probability is (6/15) \u00d7 (5/14).\n\nLet's calculate that: (6/15) \u00d7 (5/14) = (6 \u00d7 5) / (15 \u00d7 14) = 30 / 210.\n\nSimplify 30/210: both divisible by 30, so 1/7.\n\nSame answer as before. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the probability using permutations if I think about the order, but since in combinations the order doesn't matter, and I'm just choosing two balls, the combination approach makes more sense here.\n\nBut just to verify, let's try the permutation way.\n\nTotal number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 15 without replacement, considering order: that's P(15, 2) = 15 \u00d7 14 = 210.\n\nNumber of ways to draw 2 blue balls out of 6, considering order: P(6, 2) = 6 \u00d7 5 = 30.\n\nSo, probability = 30 / 210 = 1/7.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, no matter which approach I take, I end up with 1/7.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are blue is 1/7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{7}} \\]"
