        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a class of 40 students, and 60% of them are female. First, I need to find out how many female students there are.\n\nTo do that, I'll calculate 60% of 40. Percentages can be a bit tricky, but I remember that \"percent\" means \"per hundred,\" so 60% is like 60 per 100. To find 60% of 40, I can multiply 40 by 0.60.\n\nLet me do that: 40 times 0.60 is 24. So, there are 24 female students in the class.\n\nNow, if there are 40 students in total and 24 are female, then the number of male students must be 40 minus 24, which is 16. So, there are 16 male students.\n\nThe problem says that 10 more male students join the class. So, I need to add 10 to the current number of male students. That would be 16 plus 10, which equals 26 male students.\n\nNow, the total number of students in the class after these 10 males join would be the original 40 plus 10, which is 50 students.\n\nWe need to find out what percentage of this new total is female. There are still 24 female students, but now there are 50 students in total.\n\nTo find the percentage of female students, I'll divide the number of female students by the total number of students and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nSo, that's 24 divided by 50, multiplied by 100.\n\nLet me calculate that: 24 divided by 50 is 0.48. Then, 0.48 multiplied by 100 is 48%.\n\nSo, after 10 more male students join the class, 48% of the class will be female.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 40 students, 60% female: 40 * 0.60 = 24 females.\n\nMales: 40 - 24 = 16 males.\n\nAdding 10 males: 16 + 10 = 26 males.\n\nTotal students now: 40 + 10 = 50 students.\n\nPercentage female: (24 / 50) * 100 = 48%.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it this way: originally, there are 24 females out of 40 students. Adding 10 males makes it 24 females out of 50 students.\n\nTo find the percentage: (24 / 50) * 100 = 48%.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the final answer is 48%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48\\%} \\]"
