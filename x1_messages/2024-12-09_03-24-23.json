In fact, regular exercise can help prevent osteoarthritis by strengthening the muscles around the joints and improving joint flexibility. However, it is important to exercise properly and avoid putting too much stress on the joints. If you have any concerns about your joint health, it is always best to consult with a healthcare professional."
