        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a farmer wants to build a rectangular fence using 200 meters of fencing material, and he wants to maximize the enclosed area. I need to figure out what the dimensions of the fence should be to achieve that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's a rectangular fence, so it has four sides: two lengths and two widths. The total fencing material is 200 meters, which means the perimeter of the rectangle is 200 meters. The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\nwhere L is the length and W is the width.\n\nSo, 2L + 2W = 200 meters.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the area (A) of the rectangle, which is:\n\nA = L * W\n\nI need to find the values of L and W that maximize A, given that 2L + 2W = 200.\n\nHmm, this sounds like an optimization problem. I think I can use algebra to express one variable in terms of the other and then find the maximum area.\n\nFirst, from the perimeter equation:\n\n2L + 2W = 200\n\nI can simplify this by dividing both sides by 2:\n\nL + W = 100\n\nNow, I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for W:\n\nW = 100 - L\n\nNow, substitute this expression for W into the area formula:\n\nA = L * (100 - L)\n\nA = 100L - L^2\n\nSo, the area A is a function of L: A(L) = 100L - L^2\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of L, and it's in the form A = -L^2 + 100L, which is a downward-opening parabola. The maximum value of A occurs at the vertex of the parabola.\n\nFor a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c, the vertex occurs at x = -b/(2a). In this case, a = -1 and b = 100, so:\n\nL = -100 / (2 * -1) = 100 / 2 = 50 meters\n\nSo, the length that maximizes the area is 50 meters.\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation for W:\n\nW = 100 - L = 100 - 50 = 50 meters\n\nWait a minute, that means the width is also 50 meters. So, the rectangle is actually a square with sides of 50 meters.\n\nIs that possible? I thought a rectangle can have different length and width. But according to this, the maximum area is achieved when the rectangle is a square.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense. If L = 50 meters and W = 50 meters, then the perimeter is 2*50 + 2*50 = 100 + 100 = 200 meters, which matches the given fencing material.\n\nThe area would be 50 * 50 = 2500 square meters.\n\nIs this indeed the maximum possible area?\n\nLet me consider other possible dimensions to see if I can get a larger area.\n\nSuppose I choose L = 40 meters, then W = 100 - 40 = 60 meters.\n\nArea = 40 * 60 = 2400 square meters, which is less than 2500.\n\nAlternatively, L = 60 meters, W = 40 meters: same area, 2400 square meters.\n\nWhat about L = 55 meters, W = 45 meters: area = 55 * 45 = 2475 square meters, still less than 2500.\n\nOr L = 45 meters, W = 55 meters: same area, 2475 square meters.\n\nIt seems that indeed, the square configuration gives the maximum area.\n\nIs there a mathematical reason behind this?\n\nYes, for a given perimeter, the rectangle with the maximum area is a square. This is a known geometric property.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about using calculus to find the maximum area.\n\nStarting again with A(L) = 100L - L^2.\n\nTo find the maximum, I can take the derivative of A with respect to L and set it to zero.\n\ndA/dL = 100 - 2L\n\nSet dA/dL = 0:\n\n100 - 2L = 0\n\n2L = 100\n\nL = 50 meters\n\nThen, W = 100 - L = 50 meters.\n\nSo, again, I arrive at the same conclusion.\n\nTo confirm that this is a maximum, I can check the second derivative:\n\nd\u00b2A/dL\u00b2 = -2\n\nSince d\u00b2A/dL\u00b2 is negative, the function A(L) has a maximum at L = 50 meters.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions that maximize the enclosed area are L = 50 meters and W = 50 meters, forming a square.\n\nBut the problem specifies a rectangular fence, and a square is a special type of rectangle where all sides are equal.\n\nSo, the answer should be that the fence should be a square with sides of 50 meters each.\n\nAlternatively, if the farmer insists on having a rectangular shape that is not a square, the area will be less than the maximum possible.\n\nBut since the goal is to maximize the area, the optimal dimensions are indeed 50 meters by 50 meters.\n\nLet me just consider if there are any constraints I've missed.\n\nThe problem says \"rectangular fence,\" which includes squares, so no issues there.\n\nAlso, the total fencing material is 200 meters, which is used for the perimeter, and there are no other constraints mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions that maximize the enclosed area are 50 meters by 50 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50 \\text{ meters by } 50 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
