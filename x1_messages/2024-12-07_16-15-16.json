Every plan should correspond to an evidence value, which will be the outcome of one of the accessible functions considering an input string that could be the user question, one or more prior evidence values, or a blend of both.\n\nAvailable tools to be used:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: A tool enabling users to look up information via the DuckDuckGo search engine. It assists in locating a suitable list of websites that might contain the answer to the user's query. The function does not directly provide the answer; instead, it identifies potential sites that may have the solution.\nHTMLStripper[input]: Strips HTML tags from a website URL and generates a plain text output comprising the content of the link.\nURLCollector[input]: Collects URLs from plain text and delivers a plain text, newline-separated response of URLs.\nNLPModel[input]: Natural Language Processing model adept at responding to queries based on an input text passage. The input needs to be a textual question referring to an :evidence[n]: variable, such as What is the height of the Eiffel Tower, given :evidence1:?\n\nEach function's input should simply be a plain string, devoid of quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, for instance, NLPModel[What is the population of Tokyo, given :evidence3:?]\n\nEnsure to incorporate only one evidence output for every plan step.\n\nThe output should follow this format:\nPlan: [initial action to undertake based on the input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to invoke with input parameter]\nPlan: [subsequent action to perform, based on the outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to invoke and input parameter, which may refer to previous evidence, e.g., \"Considering context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: incorporating the ultimate answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who designed the Sydney Opera House and what inspired their design?"
