        "content": "The theremin is unique because it can be played without physical contact. It is one of the earliest electronic musical instruments, invented by Russian scientist Leon Theremin in 1920. What's fascinating about the theremin is that you don't need to touch it to play it. Instead, you control the pitch and volume by moving your hands in the air around two antennas. The closer your hand is to an antenna, the higher the pitch or lower the volume, depending on which antenna you're near. This makes it a truly innovative and intriguing instrument to watch and hear."
