        "content": "I'm here to help you with your partial differential equation problem. So, you have the heat equation:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\]\n\nwith the initial condition:\n\n\\[u(x,0) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\]\n\nand the boundary conditions:\n\n\\[u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0\\]\n\nThis is a classic problem in partial differential equations, often arising in heat transfer scenarios where you have a rod with insulated ends held at zero temperature.\n\nTo solve this, we'll use the method of separation of variables. The idea is to assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on \\(x\\) and the other only on \\(t\\). So, let's set:\n\n\\[u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\\]\n\nSubstituting this into the PDE, we get:\n\n\\[X(x) \\frac{dT}{dt} = k T(t) \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2}\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by \\(k X(x) T(t)\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{k T(t)} \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{1}{X(x)} \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2}\\]\n\nSince the left side depends only on \\(t\\) and the right side depends only on \\(x\\), both sides must be equal to a constant, say \\(-\\lambda\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{k T(t)} \\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\lambda\\]\\[\\frac{1}{X(x)} \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} = -\\lambda\\]\n\nThis gives us two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. \\[\\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} + \\lambda X = 0\\]\\[X(0) = 0, \\quad X(1) = 0\\]\n\n2. \\[\\frac{dT}{dt} + k \\lambda T = 0\\]\n\nFirst, let's solve the spatial ODE:\n\n\\[\\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} + \\lambda X = 0\\]\\[X(0) = 0, \\quad X(1) = 0\\]\n\nThe general solution to this ODE depends on the value of \\(\\lambda\\):\n\n- If \\(\\lambda > 0\\), the general solution is:\n\n\\[X(x) = A \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda} x) + B \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda} x)\\]\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\n\\[X(0) = B = 0\\]\\[X(1) = A \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) = 0\\]\n\nSince \\(A\\) cannot be zero (trivial solution), we must have:\n\n\\[\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) = 0 \\implies \\sqrt{\\lambda} = n\\pi \\implies \\lambda = n^2 \\pi^2\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is a positive integer.\n\n- If \\(\\lambda = 0\\), the general solution is:\n\n\\[X(x) = Ax + B\\]\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\n\\[X(0) = B = 0\\]\\[X(1) = A = 0\\]\n\nSo, only the trivial solution, which is not useful.\n\n- If \\(\\lambda < 0\\), the general solution involves hyperbolic functions, which do not satisfy the boundary conditions unless both coefficients are zero, leading again to the trivial solution.\n\nTherefore, the only acceptable solutions are for \\(\\lambda = n^2 \\pi^2\\), with \\(n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\), and the corresponding eigenfunctions are:\n\n\\[X_n(x) = \\sin(n \\pi x)\\]\n\nNow, let's solve the temporal ODE for each \\(\\lambda_n = n^2 \\pi^2\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{dT}{dt} + k n^2 \\pi^2 T = 0\\]\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution is:\n\n\\[T_n(t) = e^{-k n^2 \\pi^2 t}\\]\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a sum of these separated solutions:\n\n\\[u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sin(n \\pi x) e^{-k n^2 \\pi^2 t}\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the coefficients \\(B_n\\) using the initial condition:\n\n\\[u(x,0) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(t = 0\\) into the general solution:\n\n\\[\\sin(\\pi x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sin(n \\pi x)\\]\n\nThis is a Fourier sine series, and since the initial condition is already a sine function with \\(n=1\\), we can see that:\n\n\\[B_1 = 1, \\quad B_n = 0 \\text{ for } n \\neq 1\\]\n\nTherefore, the solution to the PDE is:\n\n\\[u(x,t) = \\sin(\\pi x) e^{-k \\pi^2 t}\\]\n\nThis is the final solution to the given partial differential equation with the specified boundary and initial conditions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{u(x,t) = \\sin(\\pi x) e^{-k \\pi^2 t}}\\]"
