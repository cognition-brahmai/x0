        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 people in the room: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, and Eve. Each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes there are in total.\n\nFirst, I think about Alice. She shakes hands with everyone else in the room. So, she shakes hands with Bob, Carol, Dave, and Eve. That's 4 handshakes just for Alice.\n\nNext, Bob has already shaken hands with Alice, so he only needs to shake hands with Carol, Dave, and Eve. That's 3 additional handshakes.\n\nThen, Carol has already shaken hands with Alice and Bob, so she only shakes hands with Dave and Eve. That's 2 more handshakes.\n\nAfter that, Dave has already shaken hands with Alice, Bob, and Carol, so he only shakes hands with Eve. That's 1 additional handshake.\n\nFinally, Eve has already shaken hands with everyone else, so she doesn't need to shake hands with anyone new.\n\nNow, if I add up all these handshakes: 4 (Alice) + 3 (Bob) + 2 (Carol) + 1 (Dave) + 0 (Eve) = 10 handshakes in total.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to calculate this without listing everyone's handshakes? I remember something about combinations. Combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, which is the case here because a handshake between Alice and Bob is the same as a handshake between Bob and Alice.\n\nSo, the number of handshakes should be equal to the number of ways to choose 2 people out of 5 to shake hands. That's a combination problem: C(5,2).\n\nI know that the formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n,k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nSo, C(5,2) = 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!) = (120) / (2 * 6) = 120 / 12 = 10.\n\nThat matches the total I got earlier by listing each handshake.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try this with a smaller number. Suppose there are 3 people: Alice, Bob, and Carol.\n\nUsing the same approach: Alice shakes hands with Bob and Carol (2 handshakes), Bob shakes hands with Carol (1 handshake), and Carol has already shaken hands with both. Total: 2 + 1 + 0 = 3 handshakes.\n\nUsing the combination formula: C(3,2) = 3! / (2! * 1!) = 6 / 2 = 3. It matches again.\n\nSo, for 5 people, it's indeed 10 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of the formula n(n-1)/2 for the number of handshakes, where n is the number of people. Let's see: 5 * 4 / 2 = 10. Same answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this now. The total number of handshakes is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
