        "content": "To find the limit of the function \\( g(x) = \\frac{3x^2 + 2x - 1}{4x^2 + x + 5} \\) as \\( x \\) approaches infinity, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the degrees of the numerator and the denominator:**\n   - The numerator is \\( 3x^2 + 2x - 1 \\), which is a polynomial of degree 2.\n   - The denominator is \\( 4x^2 + x + 5 \\), which is also a polynomial of degree 2.\n\n2. **Compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator:**\n   - Since both the numerator and the denominator have the same degree (degree 2), the limit as \\( x \\) approaches infinity is the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\n3. **Extract the leading coefficients:**\n   - The leading coefficient of the numerator is 3.\n   - The leading coefficient of the denominator is 4.\n\n4. **Calculate the limit:**\n   - When the degrees are equal, the limit is \\( \\frac{\\text{leading coefficient of numerator}}{\\text{leading coefficient of denominator}} \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} g(x) = \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\nTo verify this, let's consider the behavior of the function as \\( x \\) becomes very large:\n\n- For large values of \\( x \\), the highest degree terms in both the numerator and the denominator will dominate the behavior of the function.\n- Thus, \\( 3x^2 \\) in the numerator and \\( 4x^2 \\) in the denominator will be the dominant terms.\n- The other terms (\\( 2x \\), \\(-1\\), \\( x \\), and \\( 5 \\)) become insignificant in comparison to \\( 3x^2 \\) and \\( 4x^2 \\) as \\( x \\) approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, for very large \\( x \\), \\( g(x) \\) behaves like \\( \\frac{3x^2}{4x^2} = \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\nHence, the limit is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{4}} \\]"
