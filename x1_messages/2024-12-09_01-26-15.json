        "content": "Let's see. If someone burns 600 calories per hour by running and they want to burn a total of 3000 calories, we need to figure out how many minutes they need to run.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how many hours they need to run to burn 3000 calories. Since they burn 600 calories per hour, I can divide the total calories they want to burn by the calories burned per hour.\n\nSo, 3000 calories divided by 600 calories per hour. Let me do that calculation.\n\n3000 \u00f7 600 = 5 hours.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for minutes, not hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so to find out how many minutes are in 5 hours, I need to multiply 5 hours by 60 minutes per hour.\n\n5 hours \u00d7 60 minutes/hour = 300 minutes.\n\nSo, they need to run for 300 minutes to burn 3000 calories.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If they run for 300 minutes, that's 5 hours, and at 600 calories per hour, that would be 5 \u00d7 600 = 3000 calories. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of calories burned per minute. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and they burn 600 calories per hour. So, calories burned per minute would be 600 calories \u00f7 60 minutes = 10 calories per minute.\n\nThen, to burn 3000 calories, they would need to run for 3000 calories \u00f7 10 calories per minute = 300 minutes.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that 300 minutes is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
