        "content": "I think you're referring to James Watt, who was a Scottish inventor and engineer, not American. The watt is a unit of power named after him. But perhaps you're thinking of someone else? Let me check. Maybe it's Benjamin Franklin? He was American and had contributions in electricity, but I don't think a unit of power is named after him. Wait, there's also Nikola Tesla, who was American and made significant contributions to electricity and magnetism, but the unit of magnetic flux density is named after him\u2014the tesla. Hmm, maybe it's not a famous American inventor I'm thinking of. Let me try to recall. There's also Alexander Graham Bell, but he's Scottish-Canadian, and the bell is a unit of sound intensity, but that's not power. Maybe it's something else. Let me think differently. Is there any unit of power named after an American inventor? I'm not sure. Perhaps you could provide a bit more context or check if the inventor was indeed American?"
