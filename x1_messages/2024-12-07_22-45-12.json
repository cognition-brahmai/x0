        "content": "So there are 50 people in a room, and I need to find out the probability that at least two people share the same birthday. And I should ignore leap years, so there are 365 days in a year. Alright, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, probability can be tricky, especially with problems like this. I think the key here is to consider the complement of the event \"at least two people share a birthday.\" The complement would be \"no one shares a birthday,\" meaning all 50 people have unique birthdays.\n\nSo, maybe I can calculate the probability of all 50 people having different birthdays and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nStarting with the first person. The first person can have a birthday on any of the 365 days. So, the probability for the first person is 365/365, which is 1.\n\nNow, the second person needs to have a birthday different from the first person. There are 364 remaining days, so the probability for the second person is 364/365.\n\nSimilarly, the third person needs a birthday different from the first two, so that's 363/365, and so on.\n\nSo, for 50 people, the probability that all have unique birthdays is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{all unique}) = \\frac{365}{365} \\times \\frac{364}{365} \\times \\frac{363}{365} \\times \\dots \\times \\frac{365-49}{365} \\]\n\nThat is, the numerator decreases by 1 each time, starting from 365 down to 365-49, which is 316.\n\nSo, more generally, this can be written as:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{all unique}) = \\frac{365!}{(365-50)! \\times 365^{50}} \\]\n\nBut calculating factorials of such large numbers can be cumbersome. Is there a better way to compute this?\n\nMaybe I can use the permutation formula. The number of ways to choose 50 unique birthdays out of 365 is \\( P(365, 50) \\), which is \\( \\frac{365!}{(365-50)!} \\), and the total number of possible birthday assignments is \\( 365^{50} \\). So, again, the probability is \\( P(\\text{all unique}) = \\frac{P(365, 50)}{365^{50}} \\).\n\nBut I need a numerical value. How can I compute this?\n\nPerhaps I can use an approximation. I've heard of the birthday paradox, which suggests that in a group of just 23 people, the probability of a shared birthday is already about 50%. So, with 50 people, it should be even higher.\n\nBut let's try to calculate it more precisely.\n\nI could write a formula in a calculator or a spreadsheet to compute the product:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{all unique}) = \\prod_{k=0}^{49} \\left(1 - \\frac{k}{365}\\right) \\]\n\nThen, the probability of at least one shared birthday is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at least one shared}) = 1 - P(\\text{all unique}) \\]\n\nLet me try calculating this step by step.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[ P = 1 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{365}\\right) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{365}\\right) \\times \\dots \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{49}{365}\\right) \\]\n\nThis might take a while to compute manually, so maybe I can look for a formula or a shortcut.\n\nAlternatively, for small values of k, \\( 1 - \\frac{k}{365} \\) can be approximated using exponentials:\n\n\\[ 1 - x \\approx e^{-x} \\text{ for small } x \\]\n\nSo, the product becomes:\n\n\\[ P \\approx \\prod_{k=1}^{49} e^{-k/365} = e^{-\\sum_{k=1}^{49} k / 365} = e^{-49 \\times 50 / (2 \\times 365)} \\]\n\nBecause \\( \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\), so \\( \\sum_{k=1}^{49} k = \\frac{49 \\times 50}{2} = 1225 \\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ P \\approx e^{-1225 / 365} = e^{-3.3562} \\]\n\nCalculating \\( e^{-3.3562} \\), let's see, e raised to -3.3562 is approximately 0.035 or 3.5%.\n\nTherefore, the probability of all unique birthdays is about 3.5%, and thus the probability of at least one shared birthday is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at least one shared}) = 1 - 0.035 = 0.965 \\]\n\nOr 96.5%.\n\nIs this accurate enough? Maybe I should check with a more precise calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the exact formula and compute it step by step.\n\nLet me try calculating the exact probability.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{365}{365} \\times \\frac{364}{365} \\times \\frac{363}{365} \\times \\dots \\times \\frac{316}{365} \\]\n\nI can compute this product sequentially.\n\nBut doing this manually would be time-consuming. Maybe I can use a calculator or a computer to compute this product.\n\nAssuming I have a calculator, I can input:\n\nStart with P = 1\n\nThen, for each k from 0 to 49:\n\nP = P * (365 - k)/365\n\nAfter 50 steps, P should be the probability of all unique birthdays.\n\nAlternatively, since most calculators can handle factorials, I can compute:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{365!}{(365-50)! \\times 365^{50}} \\]\n\nBut factorials of large numbers like 365! are beyond the capacity of most calculators.\n\nPerhaps I can use Stirling's approximation for factorials, but that might complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, I can look up the formula for the birthday problem and find that the probability of at least one shared birthday among n people is:\n\n\\[ P(n) = 1 - e^{-n(n-1)/(2 \\times 365)} \\]\n\nThis seems similar to the approximation I used earlier.\n\nUsing this formula, plug in n=50:\n\n\\[ P(50) = 1 - e^{-50 \\times 49 / (2 \\times 365)} = 1 - e^{-2450 / 730} = 1 - e^{-3.3562} \\]\n\nWhich again gives approximately 1 - 0.035 = 0.965 or 96.5%.\n\nSo, according to this approximation, the probability is about 96.5%.\n\nBut I recall that in the birthday paradox, with 23 people, the probability exceeds 50%, and it increases rapidly as n grows.\n\nSo, 96.5% seems reasonable for n=50.\n\nIs there a way to get a more precise value without computing the entire product?\n\nAlternatively, I can look up a table or use a calculator that can handle large computations.\n\nAssuming I have access to such a tool, the exact probability for n=50 is approximately 0.9704 or 97.04%.\n\nSo, my earlier approximation of 96.5% was quite close.\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least two people share the same birthday in a room of 50 people is approximately 97%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.97} \\]"
