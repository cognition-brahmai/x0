Below is a Python program that generates Fibonacci numbers up to a given limit using iteration and prints the sequence as output.\n\n```python\ndef generate_fibonacci(limit):\n    sequence = []\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    while a < limit:\n        sequence.append(a)\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return sequence\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        limit = int(input(\"Enter the limit for the Fibonacci sequence: \"))\n        if limit < 0:\n            print(\"Please enter a non-negative integer.\")\n        else:\n            fibonacci_sequence = generate_fibonacci(limit)\n            print(\"Fibonacci sequence up to\", limit, \"is:\")\n            print(fibonacci_sequence)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter an integer.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition:**\n   - `generate_fibonacci(limit)`: This function generates Fibonacci numbers up to the specified limit using a while loop. It starts with `a` and `b` initialized to 0 and 1 respectively. In each iteration, it appends the current value of `a` to the sequence and updates `a` and `b` to the next Fibonacci numbers.\n\n2. **Main Function:**\n   - Prompts the user to enter a limit for the Fibonacci sequence.\n   - Validates the input to ensure it is a non-negative integer.\n   - Calls the `generate_fibonacci` function with the provided limit and prints the resulting sequence.\n\n3. **Error Handling:**\n   - Catches `ValueError` if the user inputs something other than an integer.\n   - Ensures the limit is non-negative; otherwise, prompts the user to enter a non-negative integer.\n\nThis program efficiently generates and displays the Fibonacci sequence up to the given limit using iterative methods, ensuring clarity and simplicity in its approach."
