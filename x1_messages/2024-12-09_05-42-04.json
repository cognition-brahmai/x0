        "content": "So I've got this problem here: x cubed plus y cubed equals 9, and x plus y equals 3. I need to find xy. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that there's a formula for the sum of cubes. It's x\u00b3 + y\u00b3 = (x + y)(x\u00b2 - xy + y\u00b2). Maybe I can use that here.\n\nGiven that x + y = 3, and x\u00b3 + y\u00b3 = 9, I can plug these into the formula.\n\nSo, 9 = (3)(x\u00b2 - xy + y\u00b2)\n\nThat means x\u00b2 - xy + y\u00b2 = 9 / 3 = 3.\n\nAlright, so x\u00b2 - xy + y\u00b2 = 3.\n\nNow, I need to relate this to xy. Is there another equation I can use here?\n\nI know that (x + y)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2.\n\nGiven that x + y = 3, then (3)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2.\n\nSo, 9 = x\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1) x\u00b2 - xy + y\u00b2 = 3\n\n2) x\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2 = 9\n\nMaybe I can subtract these two equations to eliminate x\u00b2 and y\u00b2.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(x\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 - xy + y\u00b2) = 9 - 3\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2 - x\u00b2 + xy - y\u00b2 = 6\n\nThe x\u00b2 and y\u00b2 terms cancel out, leaving:\n\n3xy = 6\n\nTherefore, xy = 6 / 3 = 2.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the identity for x\u00b3 + y\u00b3 in terms of (x + y) and xy.\n\nI recall that x\u00b3 + y\u00b3 = (x + y)(x\u00b2 - xy + y\u00b2), which is what I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, since x + y = 3, maybe I can express y in terms of x.\n\nSo, y = 3 - x.\n\nThen, substitute into x\u00b3 + y\u00b3 = 9:\n\nx\u00b3 + (3 - x)\u00b3 = 9\n\nLet's expand (3 - x)\u00b3:\n\n(3 - x)\u00b3 = 27 - 27x + 9x\u00b2 - x\u00b3\n\nSo, x\u00b3 + 27 - 27x + 9x\u00b2 - x\u00b3 = 9\n\nThe x\u00b3 terms cancel out, leaving:\n\n27 - 27x + 9x\u00b2 = 9\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n9x\u00b2 - 27x + 27 - 9 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n9x\u00b2 - 27x + 18 = 0\n\nDivide the entire equation by 9:\n\nx\u00b2 - 3x + 2 = 0\n\nNow, factor this quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 2) = 0\n\nSo, x = 1 or x = 2\n\nIf x = 1, then y = 3 - 1 = 2\n\nIf x = 2, then y = 3 - 2 = 1\n\nIn both cases, xy = 1 * 2 = 2\n\nSo, this matches my earlier result.\n\nTherefore, xy = 2\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
