        "content": "Certainly! To design a SQL query that retrieves customers who have purchased more than 5 distinct products, we need to join the Customers and Orders tables and then group the results by customer, counting the distinct products each customer has purchased.\n\nHere's how you can structure the query:\n\n1. **Join the Tables**: We need to link the Customers and Orders tables using the CustomerID field.\n2. **Group by Customer**: After joining, we group the results by CustomerID to aggregate the purchases per customer.\n3. **Count Distinct Products**: For each customer, count the number of distinct products they have purchased.\n4. **Filter Customers**: Select only those customers who have purchased more than 5 distinct products.\n\nGiven the table structures:\n\n- Customers (CustomerID, Name, Email)\n- Orders (OrderID, CustomerID, Product, Quantity)\n\nThe SQL query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT C.CustomerID, C.Name, C.Email\nFROM Customers C\nJOIN Orders O ON C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID\nGROUP BY C.CustomerID, C.Name, C.Email\nHAVING COUNT(DISTINCT O.Product) > 5;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **JOIN Operation**:\n   - We join the Customers table (aliased as C) with the Orders table (aliased as O) on the CustomerID field. This combines the customer details with their respective orders.\n\n2. **GROUP BY Clause**:\n   - We group the results by CustomerID, Name, and Email to aggregate the orders per customer.\n\n3. **HAVING Clause**:\n   - We use the HAVING clause to filter groups (customers) based on the condition that the count of distinct products they have purchased is greater than 5.\n\nThis query ensures that only customers who have purchased more than 5 distinct products are listed, along with their details such as CustomerID, Name, and Email."
