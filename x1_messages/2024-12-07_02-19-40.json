        "content": "Let's see. There's this snail trying to climb up a 12-foot wall. Each day, it climbs up 3 feet, but then slides back down 2 feet during the night. I need to figure out how many days it will take for the snail to reach the top.\n\nFirst, I should understand the net progress the snail makes each day. During the day, it climbs up 3 feet, but at night, it slides back 2 feet. So, the net gain each day is 3 feet minus 2 feet, which is 1 foot per day.\n\nBut wait, on the last day when the snail reaches the top, it won't slide back down, right? Because once it's at the top, it's done. So, I need to consider that on the final day, the snail climbs the remaining distance without sliding back.\n\nLet me think about this. If the snail needs to climb 12 feet, and it makes a net progress of 1 foot per day, but with the condition that on the last day, it climbs the remaining distance without sliding back.\n\nMaybe I can calculate how many full days it takes for the snail to be one day away from the top, and then add that last day.\n\nFor example, if the snail needs to climb 12 feet, and each full day it makes a net progress of 1 foot, then after 9 days, it would have climbed 9 feet (since 9 days * 1 foot/day = 9 feet). On the 10th day, it climbs 3 feet, reaching 12 feet, and doesn't slide back.\n\nWait, but let's check that. After 9 days, the snail has climbed 9 feet. On the 10th day, it climbs up 3 feet, reaching 12 feet, and since it's at the top, it doesn't slide back. So, it reaches the top on the 10th day.\n\nBut let's consider another perspective. Each day, the snail effectively climbs 1 foot (3 feet up and 2 feet back). So, to climb 12 feet, it would take 12 days. But according to the previous reasoning, it reaches the top on the 10th day.\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here. I need to resolve this.\n\nLet me try to make a table to track the snail's progress day by day.\n\nDay 1: climbs 3 feet, slides back 2 feet -> net +1 foot, position = 1 foot\n\nDay 2: climbs 3 feet (from 1 to 4 feet), slides back 2 feet -> net +1 foot, position = 2 feet\n\nDay 3: climbs 3 feet (from 2 to 5 feet), slides back 2 feet -> net +1 foot, position = 3 feet\n\n...\n\nI see a pattern here. Each day, the snail makes a net progress of 1 foot. So, after n days, the snail is at n feet.\n\nBut wait, according to this, to reach 12 feet, it would take 12 days. However, in my earlier reasoning, I thought it would take 10 days.\n\nI think the confusion is about the last day's climb. Let's consider that on the last day, the snail climbs 3 feet and doesn't slide back.\n\nSo, if the snail is at 9 feet at the start of the 10th day, it climbs 3 feet to reach 12 feet and stays there without sliding back.\n\nBut according to the table, each day it only makes a net progress of 1 foot, so after 9 days, it's at 9 feet, and on the 10th day, it climbs to 10 feet, not 12 feet.\n\nThere's the mistake. The table doesn't account for the fact that on the last day, the snail climbs without sliding back.\n\nSo, I need to adjust my approach.\n\nLet's think about it differently. Each day, the snail makes a net progress of 1 foot, except for the last day, where it climbs the remaining distance without sliding back.\n\nSo, if the wall is 12 feet, and each day it makes 1 foot of progress, but on the last day, it climbs 3 feet without sliding back.\n\nI need to find out how many full days it takes for the snail to be in a position where, on the next day, it can climb the remaining distance in a single day.\n\nIn other words, on the day before the last day, the snail should be less than 3 feet away from the top, so that on the last day, it can climb the remaining distance in one climb without sliding back.\n\nSo, let's find out after how many days the snail is less than 3 feet from the top.\n\nThe wall is 12 feet. If the snail is less than 3 feet from the top, that means it's at or above 9 feet.\n\nSo, I need to find out how many days it takes for the snail to reach at least 9 feet, so that on the next day, it can climb the remaining 3 feet to reach the top.\n\nGiven that each full day, the snail makes a net progress of 1 foot, to reach 9 feet, it would take 9 days.\n\nThen, on the 10th day, it climbs 3 feet to reach 12 feet and stays there.\n\nTherefore, it takes 10 days for the snail to reach the top.\n\nBut wait, let's confirm this.\n\nAfter 9 days:\n\n- Day 1: starts at 0, climbs to 3, slides back to 1\n\n- Day 2: starts at 1, climbs to 4, slides back to 2\n\n- Day 3: starts at 2, climbs to 5, slides back to 3\n\n- Day 4: starts at 3, climbs to 6, slides back to 4\n\n- Day 5: starts at 4, climbs to 7, slides back to 5\n\n- Day 6: starts at 5, climbs to 8, slides back to 6\n\n- Day 7: starts at 6, climbs to 9, slides back to 7\n\n- Day 8: starts at 7, climbs to 10, slides back to 8\n\n- Day 9: starts at 8, climbs to 11, slides back to 9\n\nAfter 9 days, the snail is at 9 feet.\n\nOn the 10th day:\n\n- It starts at 9 feet, climbs 3 feet to reach 12 feet, and since it's at the top, it doesn't slide back.\n\nTherefore, it takes 10 days for the snail to reach the top of the 12-foot wall.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
