        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 200 widgets per hour and operates for 16 hours each day. So, first, I need to find out how many widgets they produce in one day.\n\nWidgets per day = widgets per hour \u00d7 hours per day\n= 200 \u00d7 16\n= 3,200 widgets per day\n\nNow, they operate for 30 days in the month, so the total production for the month would be:\n\nTotal monthly production = widgets per day \u00d7 days per month\n= 3,200 \u00d7 30\n= 96,000 widgets\n\nBut they only need to produce 60,000 widgets. So, 96,000 is greater than 60,000. That means they can definitely meet the target.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there are any other factors to consider. Like, are there any days off? Or machine breakdowns? But according to the information given, the factory operates 16 hours per day for 30 days, so I think my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they need to produce different types of widgets or there are constraints I'm not aware of, but based on the information provided, it seems they can easily meet the target.\n\nSo, yes, they can meet the target of 60,000 widgets in one month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yes, they can meet the target.}} \\]"
