        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see: there's a bag with 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. I need to find the probability of drawing two red balls in a row without replacing the first one back into the bag. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of balls in the bag. There are 5 red, 3 blue, and 2 green, so total balls are 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 balls.\n\nNow, the probability of drawing the first red ball. Since there are 5 red balls out of 10 total balls, the probability is 5/10, which simplifies to 1/2.\n\nOkay, but that's just the first draw. I need two red balls in a row without replacement. So, after drawing the first red ball, I don't put it back, right? That means for the second draw, there are now only 4 red balls left, because one red ball has already been drawn and not replaced.\n\nAlso, the total number of balls now is 9, because we've removed one ball without replacing it.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a second red ball is 4/9.\n\nNow, to find the probability of both events happening in sequence\u2014first drawing a red ball and then drawing another red ball without replacement\u2014I need to multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\nSo, the overall probability is (5/10) * (4/9).\n\nLet me calculate that: 5/10 is 1/2, and 4/9 is already in simplest form. So, 1/2 times 4/9 is (1*4)/(2*9) = 4/18, which simplifies to 2/9.\n\nWait a minute, can I simplify that further? 4/18 divided by 2 is 2/9, and that's as simple as it gets.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing two red balls consecutively without replacement is 2/9.\n\nLet me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. Total balls: 5 red, 3 blue, 2 green, totaling 10. First draw: 5/10 chance of red. Second draw, without replacement: 4/9 chance of red. Multiplying them gives 2/9. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 5 is C(5,2), and the total number of ways to choose any 2 balls out of 10 is C(10,2). So, the probability would be C(5,2)/C(10,2).\n\nLet me calculate that to verify. C(5,2) is (5*4)/2 = 10. C(10,2) is (10*9)/2 = 45. So, 10/45 simplifies to 2/9. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nGood, so both methods give me the same answer, which reinforces that 2/9 is correct.\n\nI think that's the solution. If there's anything else to consider, I'm not seeing it right now. Maybe I should consider the total number of balls or whether the draws are independent, but since it's without replacement, they're dependent events, which is why I multiplied the probabilities accordingly.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with 2/9 as the probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{9}} \\]"
