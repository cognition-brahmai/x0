First, I need to find out how many eggs one hen lays in a week based on the information that she lays 3 eggs in 2 days.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many eggs she lays in one day. If she lays 3 eggs in 2 days, then in one day she would lay half of that, right? So, 3 eggs divided by 2 days equals 1.5 eggs per day.\n\nNow, a week has 7 days. So, if she lays 1.5 eggs each day, then in 7 days she would lay 1.5 eggs/day times 7 days.\n\nLet me calculate that: 1.5 times 7 is 10.5.\n\nSo, she would lay 10.5 eggs in a week.\n\nBut wait, hens can't lay half an egg, can they? Maybe I should consider that she lays eggs in whole numbers. Maybe the rate isn't completely constant. But according to the math, it's 10.5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of rates. If 3 eggs are laid in 2 days, then what's the weekly rate?\n\nLet me see. There are 7 days in a week. So, compared to 2 days, 7 days is 7 divided by 2, which is 3.5 times longer.\n\nSo, if in 2 days she lays 3 eggs, then in 7 days, which is 3.5 times longer, she would lay 3 eggs times 3.5, which is again 10.5 eggs.\n\nSame answer. So, according to this, it's 10.5 eggs in a week.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way to look at it. Maybe using proportions or something.\n\nLet's try setting up a proportion:\n\n3 eggs / 2 days = x eggs / 7 days\n\nSo, cross-multiplying, 3 eggs * 7 days = 2 days * x eggs\n\n21 = 2x\n\nSo, x = 21 / 2 = 10.5 eggs.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 10.5 eggs in a week.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if the hen lays eggs at a constant rate. The problem doesn't specify that, but it seems to assume a constant rate of egg-laying.\n\nAlternatively, maybe hens have a daily maximum or some other factors, but based on the information given, I think assuming a constant rate is fair.\n\nSo, final answer: 10.5 eggs in a week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10.5} \\]"
