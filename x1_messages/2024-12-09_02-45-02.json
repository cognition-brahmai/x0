        "content": "So, there's a company with 50 employees, and 30% of them work remotely full-time. I need to find out how many employees come to the office every day. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many employees work remotely full-time. Since 30% of the 50 employees work remotely, I can calculate that by multiplying 50 by 30%.\n\nBut wait, percentages can be a bit tricky. I remember that percent means per hundred, so 30% is the same as 30 per 100, or 0.3 in decimal form.\n\nSo, the number of employees working remotely full-time is 50 multiplied by 0.3. Let me do that calculation: 50 times 0.3 is 15. So, 15 employees work remotely full-time.\n\nNow, to find out how many employees come to the office every day, I need to subtract the number of remote employees from the total number of employees.\n\nTotal employees are 50, and remote employees are 15, so 50 minus 15 equals 35.\n\nTherefore, 35 employees come to the office every day.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps some employees work remotely part-time or have different schedules, but according to the question, only 30% work remotely full-time. It doesn't mention any part-time remote workers, so I assume the rest come to the office every day.\n\nWait a minute, does \"full-time remote\" mean that those 15 employees never come to the office, and the remaining 35 come every day? The question seems to imply that, yes.\n\nSo, my answer should be 35 employees come to the office every day.\n\nI think that makes sense. Unless there's more to it that I'm missing, but based on the information given, that should be correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{35} \\]"
