The Great Barrier Reef is located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of the Queensland province in northeastern Australia. It stretches over 2,300 kilometers (about 1,400 miles) and is composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands. This incredible natural wonder is not only a major tourist attraction but also an important ecological site, supporting a diverse range of marine life and playing a crucial role in the health of the planet's oceans."
