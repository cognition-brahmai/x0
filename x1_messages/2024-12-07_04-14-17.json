        "content": "So I've got this problem here about planning hiking trails in a national park. The total distance they want to cover is 200 miles, but the terrain varies between flat and steep inclines, which affects the cost of construction. It costs $10,000 per mile for flat terrain and $20,000 per mile for steep inclines, and they have a budget of $3 million. I need to figure out the optimal mix of flat and steep trails to maximize the total distance within the budget.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. They want to cover as much distance as possible with the given budget, considering the different costs for different terrains. So, it's about allocating the budget between two types of trails in a way that maximizes the total miles constructed.\n\nLet me define some variables to make this clearer. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the miles of flat terrain trails.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the miles of steep incline trails.\n\nThe total distance covered is \\( x + y = 200 \\) miles.\n\nThe cost for flat terrain is $10,000 per mile, so the total cost for flat trails is \\( 10,000x \\).\n\nThe cost for steep inclines is $20,000 per mile, so the total cost for steep trails is \\( 20,000y \\).\n\nThe total budget is $3,000,000, so the cost equation is:\n\n\\[ 10,000x + 20,000y \\leq 3,000,000 \\]\n\nBut since they want to cover exactly 200 miles, I think the equation is:\n\n\\[ x + y = 200 \\]\n\nAnd the cost constraint is:\n\n\\[ 10,000x + 20,000y \\leq 3,000,000 \\]\n\nI need to maximize the total distance, which is already fixed at 200 miles, but perhaps I need to ensure that within the budget, they can build this network.\n\nWait a minute, the total distance is fixed at 200 miles, but the cost depends on the mix of flat and steep trails. So, maybe the goal is to see if building 200 miles is possible within the $3 million budget, and if so, what mix of flat and steep trails achieves that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 200 miles is the desired total, but they might have to adjust it based on the budget. If that's the case, I need to maximize the distance within the budget.\n\nLet me check the question again: \"cover a total distance of 200 miles\" and \"budget for this project is $3 million.\" It seems like they want to cover 200 miles, and they have $3 million to do so. So, I need to find the combination of flat and steep trails that adds up to 200 miles and costs no more than $3 million.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the optimal mix to maximize the total distance covered within the budget constraints.\" Hmm, but the total distance is fixed at 200 miles. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nPerhaps \"maximize the total distance covered within the budget constraints\" means to maximize the distance within the budget, but maybe the 200 miles is the target, and if it's not possible, they have to settle for less, but the question seems to assume 200 miles is achievable.\n\nLet me calculate the cost if all 200 miles are flat terrain:\n\n\\[ 200 \\text{ miles} \\times \\$10,000/\\text{mile} = \\$2,000,000 \\]\n\nThat's within the $3 million budget.\n\nIf all 200 miles are steep inclines:\n\n\\[ 200 \\text{ miles} \\times \\$20,000/\\text{mile} = \\$4,000,000 \\]\n\nThat exceeds the budget by $1 million.\n\nSo, they can't build all 200 miles as steep inclines within the budget.\n\nSince building all flat terrain is within budget and building any steep inclines would increase the cost, but perhaps they want a mix to maximize distance. Wait, but the total distance is fixed; maybe they want to minimize cost while covering 200 miles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 200 miles is the desired total, but they might have to build less if the budget doesn't allow for the desired mix.\n\nI need to clarify the objective.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem is to maximize the distance covered within the budget, given the costs for different terrains.\n\nLet me consider it as maximizing the total distance \\( x + y \\) subject to the cost constraint \\( 10,000x + 20,000y \\leq 3,000,000 \\).\n\nAlso, \\( x \\geq 0 \\), \\( y \\geq 0 \\).\n\nBut the problem states \"covering a total distance of 200 miles,\" which suggests that the total distance is fixed, but maybe they can only cover part of it depending on the budget.\n\nWait, perhaps the 200 miles is the planned total, but they need to see if it's feasible within the budget, and if not, find the maximum distance they can build.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have to cover 200 miles, and they need to choose how much to spend on flat vs. steep trails, but that doesn't make sense because the cost depends on the type of terrain.\n\nPerhaps I should think of it as they have to build a certain number of miles, mix of flat and steep, and they want to maximize the total miles within the budget.\n\nBut the problem says \"covering a total distance of 200 miles,\" which seems like a fixed requirement.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find if building 200 miles is possible within $3 million, and if so, what mix of flat and steep trails achieves that.\n\nLet me set up the equations accordingly.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the miles of flat terrain.\n\nLet \\( y \\) be the miles of steep incline.\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ x + y = 200 \\]\n\nAnd\n\n\\[ 10,000x + 20,000y \\leq 3,000,000 \\]\n\nI can solve for \\( y \\) in the first equation:\n\n\\[ y = 200 - x \\]\n\nSubstitute into the cost equation:\n\n\\[ 10,000x + 20,000(200 - x) \\leq 3,000,000 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ 10,000x + 4,000,000 - 20,000x \\leq 3,000,000 \\]\n\n\\[ -10,000x + 4,000,000 \\leq 3,000,000 \\]\n\nSubtract 4,000,000 from both sides:\n\n\\[ -10,000x \\leq -1,000,000 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by -10,000 (and reverse the inequality):\n\n\\[ x \\geq 100 \\]\n\nSo, \\( x \\) must be at least 100 miles.\n\nThat means they need to build at least 100 miles of flat terrain to stay within the budget.\n\nGiven that, the remaining miles would be steep inclines:\n\n\\[ y = 200 - x \\]\n\nSo, if \\( x = 100 \\), then \\( y = 100 \\)\n\nLet's check the cost:\n\n\\[ 10,000 \\times 100 + 20,000 \\times 100 = 1,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 3,000,000 \\]\n\nThat uses the entire budget.\n\nIf they build more than 100 miles of flat terrain, say 150 miles, then \\( y = 50 \\) miles.\n\nThe cost would be:\n\n\\[ 10,000 \\times 150 + 20,000 \\times 50 = 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 = 2,500,000 \\]\n\nWhich is under the budget.\n\nBut the problem is to cover exactly 200 miles within the budget.\n\nSo, any \\( x \\) greater than or equal to 100 miles will allow them to build 200 miles within the budget.\n\nBut it seems like the minimum \\( x \\) is 100 miles, and \\( y \\) can be up to 100 miles, depending on how much of the budget is used.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the optimal mix to maximize the total distance covered within the budget constraints.\"\n\nWait, but the total distance is fixed at 200 miles. So, maybe the optimization is to maximize the distance within the budget, but since the distance is fixed, perhaps it's to minimize the cost.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want to maximize the number of steep incline miles within the budget.\n\nPerhaps I need to reconsider the objective.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"Determine the optimal mix of flat and steep trails to maximize the total distance covered within the budget constraints.\"\n\nGiven that the total distance is fixed at 200 miles, maybe the optimization is to choose the mix that maximizes some other factor, like the number of steep incline miles, but within the budget.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the objective is to minimize the cost while covering the 200 miles.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to minimize the cost \\( 10,000x + 20,000y \\) subject to \\( x + y = 200 \\) and \\( x \\geq 0 \\), \\( y \\geq 0 \\).\n\nGiven \\( y = 200 - x \\), substitute into the cost:\n\n\\[ \\text{cost} = 10,000x + 20,000(200 - x) = 10,000x + 4,000,000 - 20,000x = 4,000,000 - 10,000x \\]\n\nTo minimize cost, I need to maximize \\( x \\), since cost decreases as \\( x \\) increases.\n\nBut earlier, I found that \\( x \\) must be at least 100 miles to stay within the budget.\n\nSo, to minimize cost, choose the maximum possible \\( x \\), which is 200 miles (all flat terrain).\n\nBut, if \\( x = 200 \\), \\( y = 0 \\), and cost is:\n\n\\[ 10,000 \\times 200 + 20,000 \\times 0 = 2,000,000 \\]\n\nWhich is within the budget.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a requirement to have some steep inclines, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the objective is to maximize the distance covered, but since distance is fixed, perhaps it's to have as many steep inclines as possible without exceeding the budget.\n\nIn that case, maximize \\( y \\), given \\( x + y = 200 \\) and \\( 10,000x + 20,000y \\leq 3,000,000 \\).\n\nFrom \\( x = 200 - y \\), substitute into the cost:\n\n\\[ 10,000(200 - y) + 20,000y \\leq 3,000,000 \\]\n\n\\[ 2,000,000 - 10,000y + 20,000y \\leq 3,000,000 \\]\n\n\\[ 2,000,000 + 10,000y \\leq 3,000,000 \\]\n\n\\[ 10,000y \\leq 1,000,000 \\]\n\n\\[ y \\leq 100 \\]\n\nSo, the maximum \\( y \\) is 100 miles.\n\nTherefore, to maximize the number of steep inclines, build 100 miles of steep inclines and 100 miles of flat terrain, with a total cost of $3,000,000.\n\nAlternatively, to minimize cost, build 200 miles of flat terrain with a cost of $2,000,000.\n\nBut the problem says \"to maximize the total distance covered within the budget constraints.\" Since the total distance is fixed at 200 miles, perhaps the objective is to maximize the distance within the budget, which is already achieved by building 200 miles as long as the cost is within $3 million.\n\nGiven that building 200 miles with 100 miles of flat and 100 miles of steep costs exactly $3 million, and building more flat terrain reduces the cost.\n\nPerhaps the optimal mix is 100 miles of flat and 100 miles of steep, using the entire budget, maximizing the number of steep miles possible.\n\nAlternatively, if the goal is to maximize the distance, but the distance is fixed, then any mix that costs $3 million or less and covers 200 miles is optimal.\n\nBut since 200 miles with all flat terrain costs $2 million, which is within the $3 million budget, they could build all flat terrain and still be within budget.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a requirement to cover certain types of terrain, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nGiven the information provided, the optimal mix to maximize the total distance covered within the budget would be to build 200 miles with as much flat terrain as possible to minimize cost, or if there's a preference for more steep inclines, to build up to 100 miles of steep inclines.\n\nBut since the problem asks to maximize the total distance covered within the budget, and the total distance is fixed at 200 miles, perhaps the optimal mix is the one that allows building exactly 200 miles while staying within the budget.\n\nIn that case, any mix where \\( x + y = 200 \\) and \\( 10,000x + 20,000y \\leq 3,000,000 \\), which, as previously determined, requires \\( x \\geq 100 \\).\n\nSo, the optimal mix is to build at least 100 miles of flat terrain and up to 100 miles of steep inclines, using the entire budget of $3 million.\n\nAlternatively, if the goal is to maximize the number of steep incline miles within the budget, then build 100 miles of steep inclines and 100 miles of flat terrain.\n\nBut the problem specifically says \"to maximize the total distance covered within the budget constraints,\" which seems redundant since the total distance is fixed.\n\nPerhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 200 miles is the desired total, but the park can choose to build more or less, and I need to maximize the distance within the budget.\n\nIf that's the case, then let's set up the problem to maximize \\( x + y \\) subject to \\( 10,000x + 20,000y \\leq 3,000,000 \\), with \\( x \\geq 0 \\), \\( y \\geq 0 \\).\n\nTo maximize the total distance, we need to minimize the cost per mile.\n\nThe cost per mile for flat terrain is $10,000, and for steep inclines, it's $20,000.\n\nSo, to maximize the distance within the budget, one should build as much as possible of the cheaper option, which is flat terrain.\n\nTherefore, build only flat terrain trails.\n\nWith a budget of $3,000,000, the maximum distance possible is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3,000,000}{10,000} = 300 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nBut the problem mentions planning to cover 200 miles, so perhaps there's a different constraint.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are constraints on the types of terrain that need to be covered, but it's not specified.\n\nGiven the information provided, the optimal mix to maximize the total distance within the budget would be to build only flat terrain trails, up to 300 miles.\n\nBut since
