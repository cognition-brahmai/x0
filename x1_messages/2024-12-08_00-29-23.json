        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a school with 1200 students. Out of these, 60% play soccer, 40% play basketball, and 25% play both sports. We need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nFirst, I think I should find out how many students play each sport and then see how many play at least one of them. After that, I can subtract that number from the total number of students to find out how many don't play either sport.\n\nSo, let's start by calculating the number of students who play soccer. Since 60% of the students play soccer, that would be:\n\nNumber of students playing soccer = 60% of 1200 = 0.60 * 1200 = 720 students\n\nNext, the number of students who play basketball is 40% of 1200:\n\nNumber of students playing basketball = 40% of 1200 = 0.40 * 1200 = 480 students\n\nNow, 25% play both sports, so:\n\nNumber of students playing both sports = 25% of 1200 = 0.25 * 1200 = 300 students\n\nTo find the number of students who play at least one of the sports, I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle helps me avoid double-counting the students who play both sports.\n\nSo, the formula for the number of students playing at least one sport is:\n\nNumber playing at least one sport = (Number playing soccer) + (Number playing basketball) - (Number playing both)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber playing at least one sport = 720 + 480 - 300 = 900 students\n\nNow, to find the number of students who don't play either sport, I subtract the number of students playing at least one sport from the total number of students:\n\nNumber not playing either sport = Total students - Number playing at least one sport = 1200 - 900 = 300 students\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the percentages add up: 60% play soccer, 40% play basketball, and 25% play both. That means that the percentage of students playing only soccer is 60% - 25% = 35%, and the percentage playing only basketball is 40% - 25% = 15%. Then, the percentage playing both is 25%. So, the total percentage playing at least one sport is 35% + 15% + 25% = 75%.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of students not playing either sport is 100% - 75% = 25%.\n\nNow, 25% of 1200 students is 0.25 * 1200 = 300 students, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 300 students.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I make a Venn diagram with two circles, one for soccer and one for basketball. The overlap between the two circles represents students who play both sports.\n\nThe soccer circle has 720 students, the basketball circle has 480 students, and the overlap has 300 students.\n\nSo, the part of the soccer circle that doesn't overlap with basketball is 720 - 300 = 420 students (only soccer).\n\nThe part of the basketball circle that doesn't overlap with soccer is 480 - 300 = 180 students (only basketball).\n\nThen, the total number of students playing at least one sport is only soccer + only basketball + both = 420 + 180 + 300 = 900 students.\n\nAgain, subtracting from the total gives 1200 - 900 = 300 students not playing either sport.\n\nThis confirms my previous result.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the union of two sets:\n\nn(A \u222a B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \u2229 B)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n(A) is the number of students playing soccer (720)\n\n- n(B) is the number of students playing basketball (480)\n\n- n(A \u2229 B) is the number of students playing both (300)\n\nSo, n(A \u222a B) = 720 + 480 - 300 = 900 students\n\nThen, the number not playing either sport is the total number of students minus those playing at least one sport: 1200 - 900 = 300 students.\n\nThis is consistent with all the methods I've used.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that 300 students do not play either sport.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
