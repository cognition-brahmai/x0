The Quran mentions that Allah tests humans through both good and bad experiences to see how they will react and to distinguish between the righteous and the wicked. It also emphasizes the importance of free will and accountability for one's actions. Evil is not considered as an independent force but rather as a consequence of human choices and actions.\n"
