On this particular night, Pulsar and Bloom have gathered to savor the Galactic Symphony Orchestra's annual concert, \"Song of the Cosmos.\" This unique concert series features music compositions inspired by various celestial bodies, their movements, and phenomena. The melodies evoke the intricacies of astrobiology and the emotions they stir.\n\nThe Astro Concert Hall itself is designed to reproduce the dazzling grandeur of the cosmos with starlit skies and the projected motions of distant galaxies. Thematic areas of the hall mimic different musical genres that align with the various cosmic bodies - the pulsating beats of electronica for pulsars, the melancholic blues for lonely black holes, and the chaotic jazz for spiraling galaxies. \n\nBefore the concert begins, there's a pleasant and calming hum throughout the concert hall. The ambient sounds of the hall are subtly influenced by the sonification of cosmic radio waves. Around them, a mixed audience of virtual avatars and physical beings from various planetary systems engaged in vibrant discussions about music, science, and the universe. It's a brilliant fusion of science, music, and human, or humanoid, emotions - a setting that's perfect for a instrumental dialogue between an astrobiologist and a psychologist.\nEnd of setting.\nLet's get into it."
