        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we've got a class of 25 students: 12 boys and 13 girls. The teacher is forming groups of 3 students each, and we need to find the probability that a randomly selected group has exactly 2 boys and 1 girl.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how to calculate probabilities in situations like this. Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are the groups with exactly 2 boys and 1 girl, and the total outcomes are all possible groups of 3 students that can be formed from the class.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the total number of possible groups of 3 students. Since the order in which we select the students doesn't matter, this is a combination problem. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 students out of 25 is:\n\n\\[\nC(25, 3) = \\frac{25!}{3!(25 - 3)!} = \\frac{25!}{3! \\cdot 22!}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the \\( 22! \\) in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(25, 3) = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22!}{3! \\times 22!} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23}{3!}\n\\]\n\nNow, \\( 3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\), so:\n\n\\[\nC(25, 3) = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23}{6}\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, \\( 25 \\times 24 = 600 \\), then \\( 600 \\times 23 = 13,800 \\), and finally, \\( 13,800 \\div 6 = 2,300 \\).\n\nSo, there are 2,300 possible groups of 3 students.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable groups, which are the groups with exactly 2 boys and 1 girl.\n\nTo find this, I can think of it as choosing 2 boys out of 12 and 1 girl out of 13.\n\nAgain, since the order doesn't matter, I'll use combinations for both parts.\n\nFirst, the number of ways to choose 2 boys out of 12:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12!}{2!(12 - 2)!} = \\frac{12!}{2! \\cdot 10!}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10!}{2! \\times 10!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2!} = \\frac{132}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 66 ways to choose 2 boys.\n\nNow, the number of ways to choose 1 girl out of 13:\n\n\\[\nC(13, 1) = \\frac{13!}{1!(13 - 1)!} = \\frac{13!}{1! \\cdot 12!} = \\frac{13 \\times 12!}{1 \\times 12!} = 13\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 13 ways to choose 1 girl.\n\nTo find the total number of favorable groups (2 boys and 1 girl), I multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girl:\n\n\\[\n66 \\times 13 = 858\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 858 favorable groups.\n\nNow, to find the probability, I divide the number of favorable groups by the total number of possible groups:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{2 boys and 1 girl}) = \\frac{858}{2,300}\n\\]\n\nLet me simplify this fraction. First, I'll see if both numbers can be divided by 2:\n\n858 \u00f7 2 = 429\n\n2,300 \u00f7 2 = 1,150\n\nSo, it becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{429}{1,150}\n\\]\n\nIs this the simplest form? Let's check if 429 and 1,150 have any common factors.\n\nFirst, check if 429 is divisible by 3: 4 + 2 + 9 = 15, which is divisible by 3, so 429 is divisible by 3.\n\n429 \u00f7 3 = 143\n\nNow, check if 1,150 is divisible by 3: 1 + 1 + 5 + 0 = 7, which is not divisible by 3, so 1,150 is not divisible by 3.\n\nSince 429 is divisible by 3 but 1,150 is not, they have no common factors other than 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability is \\( \\frac{429}{1,150} \\).\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal for better understanding.\n\nLet me divide 429 by 1,150.\n\n429 \u00f7 1,150 \u2248 0.373\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.373, or 37.3%.\n\nWait a minute, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total number of possible groups:\n\n\\[\nC(25, 3) = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23}{6} = \\frac{13,800}{6} = 2,300\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 boys:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nNumber of ways to choose 1 girl:\n\n\\[\nC(13, 1) = 13\n\\]\n\nMultiplying them gives:\n\n\\[\n66 \\times 13 = 858\n\\]\n\nThen, the probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{858}{2,300} = \\frac{429}{1,150} \\approx 0.373\n\\]\n\nEverything checks out. So, the probability is indeed approximately 37.3%.\n\nAlternatively, to express it as a fraction, \\( \\frac{429}{1,150} \\) is the simplest form.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{429}{1150}}\n\\]\n\nor approximately\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.373}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{429}{1150}} \\]"
