        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, in this village, every man has exactly 4 sons. And each son has exactly 3 sisters. We need to find the ratio of boys to girls in the village.\n\nFirst, let's understand the family structure here. Every man has 4 sons. Now, each of these sons has 3 sisters. Wait a minute, if a man has 4 sons, that means his daughters would be the sisters of these sons. So, if each son has 3 sisters, that means there are 3 daughters in the family.\n\nLet me verify that. If a man has 4 sons and 3 daughters, then each son has 3 sisters, which matches the problem statement. Similarly, each daughter would have 4 brothers.\n\nSo, in each family, there are 4 boys and 3 girls.\n\nNow, to find the ratio of boys to girls in the entire village, we can consider that this pattern holds for all families in the village. Assuming that each family has the same structure, with 4 sons and 3 daughters.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of boys to girls in each family is 4:3.\n\nBut, in the village, the total number of boys would be 4 times the number of families, and the total number of girls would be 3 times the number of families.\n\nSo, the ratio of boys to girls in the village would also be 4:3.\n\nWait, but let's think about it differently. Maybe there's a different way to approach this.\n\nSuppose there are m men in the village. Each man has 4 sons, so the total number of sons is 4m.\n\nNow, each son has 3 sisters. Since these sisters are daughters of the same man, and each man has 4 sons and 3 daughters, the total number of daughters in the village would be 3m.\n\nTherefore, the total number of boys is 4m, and the total number of girls is 3m.\n\nHence, the ratio of boys to girls is 4m : 3m, which simplifies to 4:3.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of families. Let\u2019s assume there are f families in the village. Each family has 4 sons and 3 daughters, so the total number of boys is 4f, and the total number of girls is 3f.\n\nThus, the ratio of boys to girls is again 4:3.\n\nWait, but is there any other factor to consider? For example, are there any men without sons or daughters? The problem says \"every man has exactly 4 sons,\" which implies that all men have 4 sons, but it doesn't mention anything about women or other family members.\n\nAlso, it's possible that some men might be sons of other men in the village, but the problem states that every man has 4 sons, so perhaps all the men in the village are of the same generation, or there is some overlapping.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to consider the generational aspect.\n\nLet's suppose there is a generation of fathers, each having 4 sons. Then, each of these sons has 3 sisters, meaning that each father also has 3 daughters.\n\nSo, for each father, there are 4 sons and 3 daughters.\n\nNow, these sons will also become fathers in the next generation, each having their own 4 sons and 3 daughters.\n\nBut, if we consider only one generation, the initial fathers and their children, then the village consists of:\n\n- Fathers: m men\n\n- Sons: 4m\n\n- Daughters: 3m\n\nBut, in this case, the sons are also men, who will have their own sons and daughters.\n\nIf we consider only one generation, then the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, as previously calculated.\n\nHowever, if we consider multiple generations, it complicates things.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the number of generations, so perhaps it's safe to assume only one generation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the village has multiple generations, but the problem states that every man has exactly 4 sons, so perhaps it's a steady state where each generation has men with 4 sons and each son has 3 sisters.\n\nIn that case, the ratio would still be 4:3.\n\nWait, but perhaps there is a different approach.\n\nLet's think in terms of individual children.\n\nTake one son; he has 3 sisters.\n\nThese 3 sisters are his female siblings.\n\nSimilarly, each son in the family has these 3 sisters.\n\nSo, in a family, number of boys is 4, and number of girls is 3.\n\nHence, the ratio is 4:3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to trick us into thinking that each son has 3 sisters, implying that there are more girls, but in reality, it's per family.\n\nWait, but no, the problem says \"each son has exactly 3 sisters,\" which are his sisters within his own family.\n\nSo, within each family, the number of girls is 3.\n\nAnd the number of boys is 4.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 4:3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different interpretation.\n\nSuppose that some daughters are shared among families, but that doesn't make sense because sisters are within the same family.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some men are related, but the problem states that every man has exactly 4 sons and each son has exactly 3 sisters.\n\nThis seems to suggest a uniform structure across all families.\n\nTherefore, the ratio should be 4:3.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the entire village population.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of families as f.\n\nThen, total boys = 4f\n\nTotal girls = 3f\n\nTherefore, ratio of boys to girls = 4f : 3f = 4:3\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that some men might be counted in multiple families, but the problem seems to suggest a simple structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mathematical formula to derive this.\n\nBut, intuitively, it seems that the ratio is 4:3.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look at it from the perspective of one man's children.\n\nOne man has 4 sons and 3 daughters.\n\nTherefore, in his family, the ratio is 4:3.\n\nSince this is true for every man in the village, the overall ratio in the village should also be 4:3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different way to interpret \"each son has exactly 3 sisters.\"\n\nWait, if each son has exactly 3 sisters, that means that in each family, the number of daughters is 3.\n\nAnd since each man has 4 sons, the number of boys per family is 4.\n\nHence, the ratio is 4:3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to set up a system of equations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total number of men as m.\n\nEach man has 4 sons, so the total number of sons is 4m.\n\nEach son has 3 sisters, meaning that each son has 3 daughters in his family.\n\nWait, but this seems similar to the earlier approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of the total number of daughters.\n\nIf each son has 3 sisters, and there are 4m sons in total, then the total number of sisters is 3 times the number of sons, divided by the number of brothers each sister has.\n\nWait, that might be confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the initial approach.\n\nGiven that each family has 4 boys and 3 girls, the ratio is 4:3.\n\nTherefore, in the entire village, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a more mathematical way to confirm this.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that there are f families in the village.\n\nEach family has 1 father, 4 sons, and 3 daughters.\n\nWait, but the father is a man, and he has 4 sons and 3 daughters.\n\nSo, per family:\n\n- 1 father (male)\n\n- 4 sons (male)\n\n- 3 daughters (female)\n\nBut, the sons will also be fathers in the next generation.\n\nHowever, if we consider only one generation, then the total number of boys is 4f, and the total number of girls is 3f.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 4:3.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider multiple generations, it becomes more complex.\n\nBut, since the problem doesn't specify the number of generations, it's likely that we're supposed to consider only one generation.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of boys to girls in the village is 4:3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is implying that the village has reached a steady state where the ratio remains constant across generations.\n\nIn that case, the ratio would still be 4:3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each son has exactly 3 sisters, meaning that in the entire village, each son has exactly 3 sisters.\n\nIf that's the case, then the total number of girls in the village should be equal to 3 times the number of sons, divided by the number of brothers each girl has.\n\nWait, that might be overcomplicating things.\n\nGiven the simplicity of the problem, it's probably safe to assume that each family has 4 boys and 3 girls, leading to a ratio of 4:3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4:3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4:3} \\]"
