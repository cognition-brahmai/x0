        "content": "Let's see how many prime numbers there are between 100 and 200. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, to find the primes in this range, I need to check each number between 100 and 200 to see if it's divisible only by 1 and itself.\n\nBut manually checking each number would take a while, especially since there are 100 numbers in this range. Maybe there's a smarter way to do this. I recall that there's a method called the Sieve of Eratosthenes that can help find all primes up to a given limit. Maybe I can adapt it for this range.\n\nThe Sieve of Eratosthenes works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2. The numbers which remain unmarked at the end are primes. However, since I'm only interested in the range between 100 and 200, I don't need to apply the sieve to all numbers up to 200. But I do need to consider the multiples of primes that fall within this range.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for a list of prime numbers and count how many fall between 100 and 200. That might be faster, but I don't have a list handy right now.\n\nLet me try to list the prime numbers between 100 and 200 manually, just to get an idea.\n\nStarting with 101: Is it prime? Well, 101 is only divisible by 1 and 101, so yes, it's prime.\n\nNext, 102: That's even, so it's divisible by 2, hence not prime.\n\n103: Let's check divisibility by primes less than its square root. The square root of 103 is approximately 10.14. So, I need to check divisibility by 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n- 103 divided by 2 is 51.5 \u2192 not divisible.\n\n- Divided by 3: 103 / 3 \u2248 34.333 \u2192 not divisible.\n\n- By 5: 103 / 5 = 20.6 \u2192 no.\n\n- By 7: 103 / 7 \u2248 14.714 \u2192 no.\n\nSo, 103 is prime.\n\n104: Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n\n105: Divisible by 5 (ends with 5), not prime.\n\n106: Even, not prime.\n\n107: Check divisibility by 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n- 2: 107 / 2 = 53.5 \u2192 no.\n\n- 3: 107 / 3 \u2248 35.666 \u2192 no.\n\n- 5: 107 / 5 = 21.4 \u2192 no.\n\n- 7: 107 / 7 \u2248 15.285 \u2192 no.\n\nSo, 107 is prime.\n\n108: Even, not prime.\n\n109: Check 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n- 2: 109 / 2 = 54.5 \u2192 no.\n\n- 3: 109 / 3 \u2248 36.333 \u2192 no.\n\n- 5: 109 / 5 = 21.8 \u2192 no.\n\n- 7: 109 / 7 \u2248 15.571 \u2192 no.\n\nPrime.\n\n110: Even, not prime.\n\n111: Divisible by 3 (1+1+1=3, which is divisible by 3), not prime.\n\n112: Even, not prime.\n\n113: Check 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n- 2: 113 / 2 = 56.5 \u2192 no.\n\n- 3: 113 / 3 \u2248 37.666 \u2192 no.\n\n- 5: 113 / 5 = 22.6 \u2192 no.\n\n- 7: 113 / 7 \u2248 16.142 \u2192 no.\n\nPrime.\n\n114: Even, not prime.\n\n115: Divisible by 5, not prime.\n\n116: Even, not prime.\n\n117: Divisible by 3 (1+1+7=9), not prime.\n\n118: Even, not prime.\n\n119: Check 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n- 2: 119 / 2 = 59.5 \u2192 no.\n\n- 3: 119 / 3 \u2248 39.666 \u2192 no.\n\n- 5: 119 / 5 = 23.8 \u2192 no.\n\n- 7: 119 / 7 = 17 \u2192 yes, divisible by 7.\n\nSo, not prime.\n\n120: Even, not prime.\n\n121: Check 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n- 2: 121 / 2 = 60.5 \u2192 no.\n\n- 3: 121 / 3 \u2248 40.333 \u2192 no.\n\n- 5: 121 / 5 = 24.2 \u2192 no.\n\n- 7: 121 / 7 \u2248 17.285 \u2192 no.\n\nBut wait, 121 is 11 squared, so it's divisible by 11. But since 11 is greater than the square root of 121, and I've already checked up to 7, which is less than 11, I might have missed it. So, 121 is not prime.\n\n122: Even, not prime.\n\n123: Divisible by 3 (1+2+3=6), not prime.\n\n124: Even, not prime.\n\n125: Divisible by 5, not prime.\n\n126: Even, not prime.\n\n127: Check 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n- 2: 127 / 2 = 63.5 \u2192 no.\n\n- 3: 127 / 3 \u2248 42.333 \u2192 no.\n\n- 5: 127 / 5 = 25.4 \u2192 no.\n\n- 7: 127 / 7 \u2248 18.142 \u2192 no.\n\nPrime.\n\n128: Even, not prime.\n\n129: Divisible by 3 (1+2+9=12), not prime.\n\n130: Even, not prime.\n\n131: Check 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n- 2: 131 / 2 = 65.5 \u2192 no.\n\n- 3: 131 / 3 \u2248 43.666 \u2192 no.\n\n- 5: 131 / 5 = 26.2 \u2192 no.\n\n- 7: 131 / 7 \u2248 18.714 \u2192 no.\n\nPrime.\n\n132: Even, not prime.\n\n133: Check 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n- 2: 133 / 2 = 66.5 \u2192 no.\n\n- 3: 133 / 3 \u2248 44.333 \u2192 no.\n\n- 5: 133 / 5 = 26.6 \u2192 no.\n\n- 7: 133 / 7 = 19 \u2192 yes, divisible by 7.\n\nSo, not prime.\n\n134: Even, not prime.\n\n135: Divisible by 5, not prime.\n\n136: Even, not prime.\n\n137: Check 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n- 2: 137 / 2 = 68.5 \u2192 no.\n\n- 3: 137 / 3 \u2248 45.666 \u2192 no.\n\n- 5: 137 / 5 = 27.4 \u2192 no.\n\n- 7: 137 / 7 \u2248 19.571 \u2192 no.\n\nPrime.\n\n138: Even, not prime.\n\n139: Check 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n- 2: 139 / 2 = 69.5 \u2192 no.\n\n- 3: 139 / 3 \u2248 46.333 \u2192 no.\n\n- 5: 139 / 5 = 27.8 \u2192 no.\n\n- 7: 139 / 7 \u2248 19.857 \u2192 no.\n\nPrime.\n\n140: Even, not prime.\n\n141: Divisible by 3 (1+4+1=6), not prime.\n\n142: Even, not prime.\n\n143: Check 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n- 2: 143 / 2 = 71.5 \u2192 no.\n\n- 3: 143 / 3 \u2248 47.666 \u2192 no.\n\n- 5: 143 / 5 = 28.6 \u2192 no.\n\n- 7: 143 / 7 \u2248 20.428 \u2192 no.\n\nBut 143 is 11 times 13, so it's not prime.\n\n144: Even, not prime.\n\n145: Divisible by 5, not prime.\n\n146: Even, not prime.\n\n147: Divisible by 3 (1+4+7=12), not prime.\n\n148: Even, not prime.\n\n149: Check 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n- 2: 149 / 2 = 74.5 \u2192 no.\n\n- 3: 149 / 3 \u2248 49.666 \u2192 no.\n\n- 5: 149 / 5 = 29.8 \u2192 no.\n\n- 7: 149 / 7 \u2248 21.285 \u2192 no.\n\nPrime.\n\n150: Even, not prime.\n\n151: Check 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n- 2: 151 / 2 = 75.5 \u2192 no.\n\n- 3: 151 / 3 \u2248 50.333 \u2192 no.\n\n- 5: 151 / 5 = 30.2 \u2192 no.\n\n- 7: 151 / 7 \u2248 21.571 \u2192 no.\n\nPrime.\n\n152: Even, not prime.\n\n153: Divisible by 3 (1+5+3=9), not prime.\n\n154: Even, not prime.\n\n155: Divisible by 5, not prime.\n\n156: Even, not prime.\n\n157: Check 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n- 2: 157 / 2 = 78.5 \u2192 no.\n\n- 3: 157 / 3 \u2248 52.333 \u2192 no.\n\n- 5: 157 / 5 = 31.4 \u2192 no.\n\n- 7: 157 / 7 \u2248 22.428 \u2192 no.\n\nPrime.\n\n158: Even, not prime.\n\n159: Divisible by 3 (1+5+9=15), not prime.\n\n160: Even, not prime.\n\n161: Check 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n- 2: 161 / 2 = 80.5 \u2192 no.\n\n- 3: 161 / 3 \u2248 53.666 \u2192 no.\n\n- 5: 161 / 5 = 32.2 \u2192 no.\n\n- 7: 161 / 7 = 23 \u2192 yes, divisible by 7.\n\nNot prime.\n\n162: Even, not prime.\n\nWait, 162 is even?

There's a function in mathematics called the prime-counting function, denoted as \u03c0(n), which gives the number of prime numbers less than or equal to n.\n\nSo, the number of primes between 100 and 200 would be \u03c0(200) - \u03c0(100).\n\nI know that \u03c0(100) is 25, and \u03c0(200) is 46. So, 46 - 25 = 21.\n\nWait, that matches the count I got earlier. So, both methods confirm that there are 21 prime numbers between 100 and 200.\n\nIt's good to cross-verify using different approaches to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]"
