        "content": "I'm here to help you with your Python script! So, you want to create a script that listens for incoming connections on a specific port and sends back the current server time to each connected client. That sounds like a networking task, and in Python, we can achieve this using the `socket` module.\n\nFirst, make sure you understand the basics of socket programming in Python. Sockets are the endpoints of a communication channel and are used for all network communication in Python.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide to creating your script:\n\n1. **Import the necessary modules:**\n   You'll need the `socket` module for networking and the `datetime` module to get the current time.\n\n2. **Create a socket object:**\n   You'll use `socket.socket()` to create a socket object.\n\n3. **Bind the socket to a specific address and port:**\n   Use the `bind()` method to specify the address and port where the server will listen.\n\n4. **Listen for incoming connections:**\n   Use the `listen()` method to start listening for incoming connections.\n\n5. **Accept connections from clients:**\n   Use the `accept()` method in a loop to accept connections from clients.\n\n6. **Send the current server time to each client:**\n   Once a connection is established, get the current server time using `datetime.datetime.now()` and send it to the client.\n\n7. **Close the connection:**\n   After sending the time, close the connection with the client.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample code that demonstrates these steps:\n\n```python\nimport socket\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a socket object\n    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n    \n    # Define the host and the port on which the server will listen\n    host = '0.0.0.0'  # Listen on all available interfaces\n    port = 12345      # You can choose any port number\n    \n    # Bind the socket to the host and port\n    server_socket.bind((host, port))\n    \n    # Start listening for incoming connections\n    server_socket.listen(5)\n    print(f\"Server is listening on {host}:{port}\")\n    \n    try:\n        while True:\n            # Accept a connection from a client\n            client_socket, addr = server_socket.accept()\n            print(f\"Connection from {addr}\")\n            \n            # Get the current server time\n            current_time = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\n            \n            # Send the current time to the client\n            client_socket.sendall(current_time.encode('utf-8'))\n            \n            # Close the connection with the client\n            client_socket.close()\n            print(f\"Connection with {addr} closed\")\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n        print(\"Server is shutting down.\")\n    finally:\n        # Close the server socket\n        server_socket.close()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Socket Creation:**\n   - `socket.AF_INET` specifies the address family as IPv4.\n   - `socket.SOCK_STREAM` specifies that it's a TCP socket.\n\n2. **Binding:**\n   - `host = '0.0.0.0'` makes the server listen on all available network interfaces.\n   - `port = 12345` is the port number where the server will listen. You can choose any port number that is not in use.\n\n3. **Listening:**\n   - `server_socket.listen(5)` makes the server listen for incoming connections with a queue of 5.\n\n4. **Accepting Connections:**\n   - The `accept()` method waits for an incoming connection and returns a new socket object representing the connection and a tuple holding the address of the client.\n\n5. **Sending Data:**\n   - `datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')` formats the current date and time as a string.\n   - `client_socket.sendall(current_time.encode('utf-8'))` sends the current time to the client after encoding it to bytes.\n\n6. **Closing Connections:**\n   - `client_socket.close()` closes the connection with the client.\n   - `server_socket.close()` closes the server socket.\n\nThis script will run indefinitely, listening for connections and sending the current server time to each client that connects, until it's interrupted (e.g., with Ctrl+C)."
