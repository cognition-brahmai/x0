        "content": "So there are five people in a room, each with a different number of balloons: A has 7, B has 10, C has 15, D has 20, and E has 25. Everyone pops one balloon from every other person. I need to figure out how many balloons remain intact after this happens.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"pops one balloon from every other person\" means. Does it mean that each person pops one balloon from each of the other four people? So, for example, person A pops one balloon from B, one from C, one from D, and one from E. Similarly, B pops one balloon from A, C, D, and E, and so on for everyone else.\n\nIf that's the case, then each person will have balloons popped by the other four people. So, for each person, the number of balloons popped from them is equal to the number of other people, which is 4.\n\nSo, for person A, who has 7 balloons, if 4 balloons are popped from them (one from each of the other four people), then A would have 7 - 4 = 3 balloons remaining.\n\nSimilarly, for person B with 10 balloons, after having 4 popped, would have 10 - 4 = 6 balloons left.\n\nPerson C has 15 balloons, so 15 - 4 = 11 balloons remaining.\n\nPerson D has 20 balloons, so 20 - 4 = 16 balloons remaining.\n\nPerson E has 25 balloons, so 25 - 4 = 21 balloons remaining.\n\nNow, to find the total number of balloons remaining intact, I can add up these remaining balloons:\n\n3 (A) + 6 (B) + 11 (C) + 16 (D) + 21 (E) = Let's see, 3 + 6 is 9, plus 11 is 20, plus 16 is 36, plus 21 is 57.\n\nSo, there are 57 balloons remaining intact.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check this logic because there might be another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total number of balloons initially and then subtract the total number of balloons popped.\n\nTotal initial balloons: 7 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 = 7 + 10 is 17, plus 15 is 32, plus 20 is 52, plus 25 is 77 balloons in total.\n\nNow, each person pops one balloon from every other person. There are 5 people, so each pops 4 balloons (from the other four). Therefore, total balloons popped is 5 people times 4 balloons each, which is 20 balloons.\n\nSo, total balloons remaining would be 77 - 20 = 57, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 57 balloons remain intact.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any overlap or if someone popping a balloon from another affects the count in a different way. For example, if person A pops a balloon from person B, does that mean person B has one less balloon, and does that affect how many balloons person B can pop from others? But no, the action is that everyone pops one balloon from every other person simultaneously, or at least in a way that the popping doesn't affect the ability of others to pop balloons.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{57} \\]"
