        "content": "In a non-leap year, the month of February has 28 days. The factory produces both product A and product B daily. To find the total production for February, we need to calculate the daily production total and then multiply by the number of days in February.\n\nFirst, let's find the total daily production:\n\nProduct A: 500 units per day\nProduct B: 300 units per day\n\nTotal daily production = 500 + 300 = 800 units per day\n\nNow, since February has 28 days in a non-leap year, we can calculate the total production for the month:\n\nTotal monthly production = Total daily production \u00d7 Number of days in February\nTotal monthly production = 800 units/day \u00d7 28 days\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication:\n\n800 \u00d7 28\n\nTo make this easier, we can break it down:\n\n800 \u00d7 20 = 16,000\n800 \u00d7 8 = 6,400\n\nNow, add those together:\n\n16,000 + 6,400 = 22,400\n\nSo, the factory will produce a total of 22,400 units in the month of February during a non-leap year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22400} \\]"
