Born in 1856 in what is now Croatia, he emigrated to the United States in 1884.\n\nTesla was an eccentric character with a mind that never rested. He had an extraordinary memory and could visualize intricate inventions entirely in his head before committing them to paper. His insatiable curiosity led him to explore a wide range of scientific fields, but his passion always lay in electricity and its potential to change the world.\n\nDespite his genius, Tesla's life was not without struggle. He faced financial difficulties throughout his career, often due to his disregard for monetary gain in favor of pure innovation. His dedication to his work also led to periods of intense loneliness and isolation.\n\nHowever, Tesla remained steadfastly committed to his vision of a future powered by free, clean energy. Even when his ideas were met with skepticism or outright dismissal, he never lost faith in their potential. His resilience in the face of adversity, combined with his unparalleled intellect, has made him a symbol of ingenuity and perseverance.\nChristopher: Are you aware of your spatial orientation and location within your environment?"
