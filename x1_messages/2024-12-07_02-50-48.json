        "content": "Let's see. So, Alice, Bob, and Carol are taking turns saying numbers starting from 1, and they go in the order Alice, Bob, Carol, and repeat. The game continues until someone says the number 50. Alice starts first.\n\nSo, the sequence of numbers would be:\n\n- Alice says 1\n\n- Bob says 2\n\n- Carol says 3\n\n- Alice says 4\n\n- Bob says 5\n\n- Carol says 6\n\n- and so on, until 50.\n\nI need to figure out who says 50.\n\nFirst, let's think about how many turns there are in total. Since they're counting from 1 to 50, there are 50 turns in total.\n\nNow, the turns are divided among Alice, Bob, and Carol in that order, repeating every 3 turns.\n\nSo, every complete cycle of 3 turns covers numbers 1 to 3, 4 to 6, and so on.\n\nI need to find out which person says the 50th number.\n\nTo do this, I can find the remainder when 50 is divided by 3, since the sequence repeats every 3 turns.\n\nLet's divide 50 by 3:\n\n50 \u00f7 3 = 16 with a remainder of 2.\n\nSo, 50 = 3 \u00d7 16 + 2.\n\nThis means that there are 16 full cycles of Alice, Bob, Carol, and then 2 extra turns.\n\nIn each cycle, Alice says the first number, Bob the second, and Carol the third.\n\nSo, after 16 cycles, the next two turns would be:\n\n- Alice says the 49th number\n\n- Bob says the 50th number\n\nTherefore, Bob says the number 50.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nStarting from 1:\n\n- Turn 1: Alice says 1\n\n- Turn 2: Bob says 2\n\n- Turn 3: Carol says 3\n\n- Turn 4: Alice says 4\n\n- Turn 5: Bob says 5\n\n- Turn 6: Carol says 6\n\n...\n\n- Turn 49: Alice says 49\n\n- Turn 50: Bob says 50\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the pattern:\n\nEvery number that is congruent to 1 modulo 3 is Alice's turn (numbers like 1, 4, 7, ...)\n\nEvery number that is congruent to 2 modulo 3 is Bob's turn (numbers like 2, 5, 8, ...)\n\nEvery number that is congruent to 0 modulo 3 is Carol's turn (numbers like 3, 6, 9, ...)\n\nSince 50 divided by 3 is 16 with a remainder of 2, 50 \u2261 2 mod 3, which corresponds to Bob's turn.\n\nTherefore, Bob says the number 50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Bob}} \\]"
