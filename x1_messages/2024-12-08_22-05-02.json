        "content": "Let's see. There are 800 students in the school, and 60% of them play sports. So first, I need to find out how many students play sports. To do that, I'll calculate 60% of 800.\n\n60% of 800 is calculated as 0.60 multiplied by 800, which equals 480. So, 480 students play sports.\n\nNow, among those who play sports, 40% are girls. I need to find out how many girls that is. So, I'll calculate 40% of 480.\n\n40% of 480 is calculated as 0.40 multiplied by 480, which equals 192.\n\nTherefore, 192 girls play sports in the school.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{192} \\]"
