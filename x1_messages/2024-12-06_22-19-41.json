        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: a train travels at an average speed of 120 kilometers per hour and needs to cover a distance of 600 kilometers. I need to find out how many minutes it will take to complete the journey.\n\nFirst, I know that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, time = distance / speed.\n\nGiven that the distance is 600 km and the speed is 120 km/h, I can plug these values into the formula.\n\nTime = 600 km / 120 km/h.\n\nNow, 600 divided by 120 is 5. So, the time is 5 hours.\n\nBut the question asks for the time in minutes, not hours. I know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes. Therefore, to convert hours to minutes, I need to multiply the number of hours by 60.\n\nSo, time in minutes = 5 hours * 60 minutes/hour.\n\nThat equals 300 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can convert the speed into kilometers per minute and then find the time.\n\nLet's try that. The speed is 120 km/h. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so to find the speed in km/min, I can divide the speed in km/h by 60.\n\nSo, speed in km/min = 120 km/h / 60 min/h = 2 km/min.\n\nNow, time = distance / speed = 600 km / 2 km/min.\n\nThat also gives me 300 minutes.\n\nAlright, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nLet me just double-check if I've done everything correctly. The first method is using the basic formula time = distance / speed, which gave me 5 hours, and then converting that to minutes by multiplying by 60, which is 300 minutes.\n\nThe second method is converting the speed to km/min first, which is 2 km/min, and then dividing the distance by that speed to get 300 minutes.\n\nBoth methods confirm the same result.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. I don't see any room for error here.\n\nSo, the train will take 300 minutes to complete the 600 km journey at an average speed of 120 km/h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
