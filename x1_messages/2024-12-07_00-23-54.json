        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 4 defective items and 16 non-defective items, making a total of 20 items. I need to find the probability that when I randomly select 3 items, at least one of them is defective.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"at least one defective\" means. It means that in the selection of 3 items, I could have 1, 2, or all 3 items being defective. So, I need to find the probability of having 1 defective, 2 defective, or 3 defective items in my selection.\n\nBut calculating each of these probabilities separately might be time-consuming. There might be a simpler way to approach this.\n\nI recall that the probability of an event happening can sometimes be easier to find by calculating the probability of the event not happening and then subtracting that from 1. In this case, the event not happening would be selecting no defective items, which means all 3 items are non-defective.\n\nSo, maybe I can calculate the probability of selecting 3 non-defective items and subtract that from 1 to get the probability of selecting at least one defective item.\n\nThat sounds like a plan. Let's proceed with that.\n\nFirst, I need to find the total number of ways to select 3 items out of 20. Since the order doesn't matter in this selection, it's a combination problem.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 items out of 20 is:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 3) = \\frac{20!}{3!(20 - 3)!} = \\frac{20!}{3! \\cdot 17!}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the \\( 17! \\) in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 3) = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17!}{3! \\times 17!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18}{3!}\n\\]\n\nNow, \\( 3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\), so:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 3) = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18}{6}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the numerator:\n\n\\[\n20 \\times 19 = 380 \\\\\n380 \\times 18 = 6840\n\\]\n\nNow, divide by 6:\n\n\\[\n6840 \\div 6 = 1140\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 1140 ways to choose 3 items out of 20.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to choose 3 non-defective items out of the 16 non-defective ones.\n\nUsing the combination formula again:\n\n\\[\nC(16, 3) = \\frac{16!}{3!(16 - 3)!} = \\frac{16!}{3! \\cdot 13!}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nC(16, 3) = \\frac{16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13!}{3! \\times 13!} = \\frac{16 \\times 15 \\times 14}{3!}\n\\]\n\nAgain, \\( 3! = 6 \\), so:\n\n\\[\nC(16, 3) = \\frac{16 \\times 15 \\times 14}{6}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the numerator:\n\n\\[\n16 \\times 15 = 240 \\\\\n240 \\times 14 = 3360\n\\]\n\nNow, divide by 6:\n\n\\[\n3360 \\div 6 = 560\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 560 ways to choose 3 non-defective items out of 16.\n\nNow, the probability of selecting 3 non-defective items is the number of ways to choose 3 non-defective items divided by the total number of ways to choose any 3 items:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{no defective}) = \\frac{560}{1140}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 20:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{560 \\div 20}{1140 \\div 20} = \\frac{28}{57}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability of selecting no defective items is \\( \\frac{28}{57} \\).\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting at least one defective item is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least one defective}) = 1 - P(\\text{no defective}) = 1 - \\frac{28}{57}\n\\]\n\nSubtracting the fractions:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{28}{57} = \\frac{57}{57} - \\frac{28}{57} = \\frac{29}{57}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability of selecting at least one defective item is \\( \\frac{29}{57} \\).\n\nWait a minute, I should check if this fraction can be simplified further. Let's see, 29 and 57.\n\n29 is a prime number, and 57 divided by 29 is approximately 1.965, which is not an integer. So, the fraction \\( \\frac{29}{57} \\) is already in its simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I can verify this by calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 29 and 57. Since 29 is prime and does not divide 57, the GCD is 1, confirming that the fraction is already simplified.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\( \\frac{29}{57} \\).\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem differently to verify the answer.\n\nAnother way to calculate the probability of selecting at least one defective item is to calculate the probability of selecting exactly one defective item, plus the probability of selecting exactly two defective items, plus the probability of selecting exactly three defective items.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, the probability of selecting exactly one defective item.\n\nTo select exactly one defective item, I need to choose 1 defective out of 4 and 2 non-defective out of 16.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 1 defective out of 4 is:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 1) = \\frac{4!}{1!(4 - 1)!} = \\frac{4!}{1! \\cdot 3!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3!}{1 \\times 3!} = 4\n\\]\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 non-defective out of 16 is:\n\n\\[\nC(16, 2) = \\frac{16!}{2!(16 - 2)!} = \\frac{16!}{2! \\cdot 14!} = \\frac{16 \\times 15 \\times 14!}{2! \\times 14!} = \\frac{16 \\times 15}{2!} = \\frac{240}{2} = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of ways to select exactly one defective item is:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 120 = 480\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the probability of selecting exactly two defective items.\n\nTo select exactly two defective items, I need to choose 2 defective out of 4 and 1 non-defective out of 16.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 defective out of 4 is:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2! \\cdot 2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nThe number of ways to choose 1 non-defective out of 16 is:\n\n\\[\nC(16, 1) = \\frac{16!}{1!(16 - 1)!} = \\frac{16!}{1! \\cdot 15!} = \\frac{16 \\times 15!}{1 \\times 15!} = 16\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of ways to select exactly two defective items is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 16 = 96\n\\]\n\nNext, the probability of selecting exactly three defective items.\n\nTo select exactly three defective items, I need to choose all 3 defective out of 4.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 defective out of 4 is:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 3) = \\frac{4!}{3!(4 - 3)!} = \\frac{4!}{6 \\times 1!} = \\frac{24}{6} = 4\n\\]\n\nThe number of ways to choose 0 non-defective out of 16 is:\n\n\\[\nC(16, 0) = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of ways to select exactly three defective items is:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 1 = 4\n\\]\n\nNow, the total number of ways to select at least one defective item is the sum of the above:\n\n\\[\n480 + 96 + 4 = 580\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, earlier I calculated the number of ways to select 3 items out of 20 as 1140, and the number of ways to select 3 non-defective items as 560. So, the number of ways to select at least one defective item should be:\n\n\\[\n1140 - 560 = 580\n\\]\n\nThat matches the total I just calculated by summing the individual cases.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting at least one defective item is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least one defective}) = \\frac{580}{1140}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 20:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{580 \\div 20}{1140 \\div 20} = \\frac{29}{57}\n\\]\n\nWhich matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, both approaches give the same answer, which is \\( \\frac{29}{57} \\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of the selected items is defective is \\( \\frac{29}{57} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{29}{57}} \\]"
