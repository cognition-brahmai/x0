        "content": "Let's see. There are 25 students in the class, and 60% of them are boys. I need to find out how many girls there are.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many boys there are. If 60% of the class are boys, then I can calculate the number of boys by taking 60% of 25.\n\nTo calculate 60% of 25, I can multiply 25 by 0.60.\n\nSo, 25 times 0.60 is 15. That means there are 15 boys in the class.\n\nNow, to find out how many girls there are, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students.\n\nSo, 25 minus 15 equals 10.\n\nTherefore, there are 10 girls in the class.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can calculate the percentage of girls directly.\n\nIf 60% of the class are boys, then the remaining percentage must be girls. So, 100% minus 60% equals 40%. That means 40% of the class are girls.\n\nNow, to find out how many girls there are, I can calculate 40% of 25.\n\n40% of 25 is 0.40 times 25, which is 10.\n\nSo, again, I get 10 girls in the class.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is good. It confirms that my calculation is correct.\n\nLet me just double-check. If there are 15 boys and 10 girls, that adds up to 25 students, which matches the total number given. Also, 15 boys is 60% of 25, and 10 girls is 40% of 25.\n\nEverything seems to check out.\n\nSo, the final answer is 10 girls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
