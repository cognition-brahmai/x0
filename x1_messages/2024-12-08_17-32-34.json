        "content": "So, Tom can paint a fence by himself in 6 hours, and Jerry can do it in 8 hours. We want to know how long it would take for both of them to paint the fence together. Hmm, this seems like a problem about combining work rates.\n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out how much of the fence each of them can paint in one hour. That's their work rate, right? So, Tom's work rate is 1 fence per 6 hours, which means he paints 1/6 of the fence every hour. Similarly, Jerry paints 1/8 of the fence each hour.\n\nNow, if they work together, their work rates should add up. So, together, they paint (1/6 + 1/8) of the fence per hour. I need to add those fractions. To add 1/6 and 1/8, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 8 is 24, I think.\n\nSo, 1/6 is equal to 4/24, and 1/8 is equal to 3/24. Adding those up, they paint 7/24 of the fence per hour together.\n\nNow, if they paint 7/24 of the fence every hour, how many hours will it take them to paint the whole fence? I think I need to divide 1 (the whole fence) by their combined rate, which is 7/24. So, 1 divided by 7/24 is the same as multiplying by 24/7, which is 24/7 hours.\n\nLet me convert that to a decimal to see it better. 24 divided by 7 is approximately 3.4286 hours. So, it's about 3 hours and 0.4286 of an hour. To find out how many minutes that is, I can multiply 0.4286 by 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. That gives me roughly 25.71 minutes.\n\nSo, together, Tom and Jerry can paint the fence in approximately 3 hours and 26 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, their individual rates:\n\nTom: 1/6 fence per hour\n\nJerry: 1/8 fence per hour\n\nCombined rate: 1/6 + 1/8\n\nConverting to twelfths: 1/6 = 2/12, 1/8 = 1.5/12? Wait, that doesn't seem right. No, I think I made a mistake here.\n\nActually, earlier, I thought the least common multiple of 6 and 8 is 24, and that's correct. So, 1/6 is 4/24 and 1/8 is 3/24. Adding them up gives 7/24, which is correct.\n\nThen, time taken is 1 divided by 7/24, which is 24/7 hours, approximately 3.4286 hours.\n\nConverting 0.4286 hours to minutes: 0.4286 * 60 \u2248 25.71 minutes.\n\nSo, yes, approximately 3 hours and 26 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, I can express it as a fraction: 24/7 hours.\n\nBut maybe the question expects the answer in hours and minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to be more precise, 24/7 is exactly 3 and 3/7 hours. Now, 3/7 of an hour is how many minutes?\n\nSince 1 hour = 60 minutes, 3/7 hour = (3/7)*60 = 180/7 \u2248 25.71 minutes.\n\nSo, again, approximately 3 hours and 26 minutes.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{7} \\text{ hours}} \\]\n\nor approximately 3 hours and 26 minutes."
