        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python script that connects to a MySQL database, fetches some data from an \"employees\" table, and then calculates the average salary for each department. Finally, I need to print these averages to the console. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I get each step right.\n\nFirst things first, I need to make sure I have the pymysql library installed because that's what I'm supposed to use to connect to the MySQL database. I can install it using pip if I don't have it already. So, in my terminal, I'd run something like:\n\n```bash\npip install pymysql\n```\n\nOnce that's installed, I can start writing my Python script. I need to import the pymysql library at the beginning:\n\n```python\nimport pymysql\n```\n\nNext, I need to establish a connection to the MySQL database. For this, I'll need some connection details like the host, user, password, and the database name. Since these details can vary, I should probably keep them as variables at the top of my script so that they're easy to change if needed.\n\n```python\nhost = 'localhost'\nuser = 'your_username'\npassword = 'your_password'\ndatabase = 'your_database_name'\n```\n\nNow, I can create a connection using these details:\n\n```python\nconnection = pymysql.connect(host=host, user=user, password=password, database=database)\n```\n\nIt's important to handle this connection properly, so I should use a context manager to ensure that the connection is closed properly after I'm done with it. In Python, I can use the `with` statement for this purpose.\n\n```python\nwith pymysql.connect(host=host, user=user, password=password, database=database) as connection:\n    # database operations go here\n```\n\nInside this block, I need to create a cursor object which will allow me to execute SQL queries.\n\n```python\nwith pymysql.connect(host=host, user=user, password=password, database=database) as connection:\n    with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n        # SQL query goes here\n```\n\nNow, I need to write the SQL query to retrieve the data from the \"employees\" table. The table has columns \"id\", \"name\", \"salary\", and \"department\". I need to select all rows from this table.\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, salary, department FROM employees;\n```\n\nI'll execute this query using the cursor's `execute` method and then fetch all the rows.\n\n```python\nquery = \"SELECT id, name, salary, department FROM employees;\"\ncursor.execute(query)\nrows = cursor.fetchall()\n```\n\nAt this point, `rows` will be a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a row from the employees table.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the average salary for each department. To do this, I can group the rows by department and then calculate the average salary for each group.\n\nOne way to do this in Python is to use dictionaries. I can create a dictionary where the keys are department names, and the values are lists of salaries in that department. Then, for each department, I can calculate the average salary by summing the salaries and dividing by the number of employees.\n\nBut, there's a better way to handle this using the built-in `groupby` function from the `itertools` module, which is designed for grouping data.\n\nFirst, I need to import `groupby` from `itertools` and also `operator` for sorting.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import groupby\nimport operator\n```\n\nBefore using `groupby`, I need to sort the rows by department so that all rows from the same department are grouped together.\n\n```python\nrows_sorted = sorted(rows, key=operator.itemgetter(3))  # department is the 4th element, index 3\n```\n\nNow, I can use `groupby` to group the rows by department.\n\n```python\ndepartment_groups = groupby(rows_sorted, key=operator.itemgetter(3))\n```\n\nFor each department group, I can extract the salaries, calculate their average, and store the result.\n\nI'll create a list to hold the average salaries.\n\n```python\naverage_salaries = []\n```\n\nThen, iterate over each department group:\n\n```python\nfor department, group in department_groups:\n    salaries = [row[2] for row in group]  # salary is the 3rd element, index 2\n    avg_salary = sum(salaries) / len(salaries)\n    average_salaries.append((department, avg_salary))\n```\n\nNow, `average_salaries` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a department name and its corresponding average salary.\n\nFinally, I need to print these results to the console. I can loop through the `average_salaries` list and print each department and its average salary.\n\n```python\nfor department, avg_salary in average_salaries:\n    print(f\"Department: {department}, Average Salary: {avg_salary:.2f}\")\n```\n\nI'm formatting the average salary to two decimal places for better readability.\n\nPutting it all together, here's what the complete script would look like:\n\n```python\nimport pymysql\nfrom itertools import groupby\nimport operator\n\n# Database connection details\nhost = 'localhost'\nuser = 'your_username'\npassword = 'your_password'\ndatabase = 'your_database_name'\n\n# Connect to the database\nwith pymysql.connect(host=host, user=user, password=password, database=database) as connection:\n    with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n        # SQL query to retrieve data\n        query = \"SELECT id, name, salary, department FROM employees;\"\n        cursor.execute(query)\n        rows = cursor.fetchall()\n\n# Sort rows by department\nrows_sorted = sorted(rows, key=operator.itemgetter(3))\n\n# Group rows by department and calculate average salary\ndepartment_groups = groupby(rows_sorted, key=operator.itemgetter(3))\naverage_salaries = []\nfor department, group in department_groups:\n    salaries = [row[2] for row in group]\n    avg_salary = sum(salaries) / len(salaries)\n    average_salaries.append((department, avg_salary))\n\n# Print the results\nfor department, avg_salary in average_salaries:\n    print(f\"Department: {department}, Average Salary: {avg_salary:.2f}\")\n```\n\nBefore running this script, make sure to replace `'your_username'`, `'your_password'`, and `'your_database_name'` with your actual database credentials.\n\nAlso, ensure that the \"employees\" table exists in your database and has the specified columns.\n\nThis script connects to the database, retrieves the employee data, groups it by department, calculates the average salary for each department, and prints the results neatly formatted.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo accomplish the task of connecting to a MySQL database, retrieving employee data, and calculating the average salary per department, follow the steps below to create and run the Python script.\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. **pymysql Library**: Ensure that the `pymysql` library is installed. If not, install it using:\n   ```bash\n   pip install pymysql\n   ```\n\n2. **Database Connection Details**: Have your database connection details ready (host, user, password, database name).\n\n3. **Table Structure**: Ensure that the `employees` table exists with columns: `id`, `name`, `salary`, and `department`.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport pymysql\nfrom itertools import groupby\nimport operator\n\n# Database connection details\nhost = 'localhost'\nuser = 'your_username'\npassword = 'your_password'\ndatabase = 'your_database_name'\n\n# Connect to the database\nwith pymysql.connect(host=host, user=user, password=password, database=database) as connection:\n    with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n        # SQL query to retrieve data\n        query = \"SELECT id, name, salary, department FROM employees;\"\n        cursor.execute(query)\n        rows = cursor.fetchall()\n\n# Sort rows by department\nrows_sorted = sorted(rows, key=operator.itemgetter(3))\n\n# Group rows by department and calculate average salary\ndepartment_groups = groupby(rows_sorted, key=operator.itemgetter(3))\naverage_salaries = []\nfor department, group in department_groups:\n    salaries = [row[2] for row in group]\n    avg_salary = sum(salaries) / len(salaries)\n    average_salaries.append((department, avg_salary))\n\n# Print the results\nfor department, avg_salary in average_salaries:\n    print(f\"Department: {department}, Average Salary: {avg_salary:.2f}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Database Connection**:\n   - The script connects to the MySQL database using the `pymysql` library with the provided connection details.\n\n2. **Data Retrieval**:\n   - It executes a SQL query to select all records from the `employees` table.\n\n3. **Data Processing**:\n   - The retrieved data is sorted by the department.\n   - The `groupby` function from the `itertools` module groups the data by department.\n   - For each department, it calculates the average salary by summing the salaries and dividing by the number of employees.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - It prints the department name and the corresponding average salary, formatted to two decimal places.\n\n### Notes\n- Replace `'your_username'`, `'your_password'`, and `'your_database_name'` with your actual database credentials.\n- Ensure that the `employees` table exists and contains the specified columns.\n- This script assumes that the database is accessible and that the user has the necessary permissions to execute the query.\n"
