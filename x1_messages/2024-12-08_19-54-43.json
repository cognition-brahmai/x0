        "content": "So the company makes $150,000 every month and spends $100,000 each month. To find out the profit per month, I need to subtract the expenses from the revenue. So, $150,000 minus $100,000 is $50,000. That means the company makes $50,000 profit each month.\n\nNow, to find out the annual profit, I need to calculate how much they make in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, I should multiply the monthly profit by 12. So, $50,000 times 12 equals $600,000.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If they make $50,000 each month, and there are 12 months in a year, then yes, $50,000 times 12 is indeed $600,000.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Are there any taxes or additional expenses that might affect the profit? The question doesn't mention any other costs, so I'll assume that the only expenses are the $100,000 per month.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the revenue and expenses are constant each month. If there were fluctuations, I would need to account for those, but since they're fixed, it's straightforward.\n\nSo, the company's annual profit is $600,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{600000} \\]"
