        "content": "Let's see. John is buying 12 items, each costing $18, and there's a 15% discount because he's buying 10 or more items. So, first, I need to find out the total cost before the discount.\n\nHe's buying 12 items at $18 each, so total cost before discount is 12 times 18. Let me calculate that.\n\n12 times 18 is, hmm, 10 times 18 is 180, and 2 times 18 is 36, so total is 180 plus 36, which is 216. So, $216 is the total before discount.\n\nNow, there's a 15% discount on the entire purchase because he's buying 10 or more items. So, I need to calculate 15% of 216 and then subtract that from 216 to get the final amount he has to pay.\n\nFirst, find 15% of 216. To find 15% of a number, you can multiply the number by 0.15. So, 216 times 0.15.\n\n216 times 0.15: well, 200 times 0.15 is 30, and 16 times 0.15 is 2.4, so total discount is 30 plus 2.4, which is 32.4. So, the discount is $32.4.\n\nNow, subtract the discount from the total before discount: 216 minus 32.4.\n\n216 minus 32.4: 216 minus 30 is 186, and then minus 2.4 is 183.6. So, John will pay $183.6.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's an easier way to calculate this.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to realize that if there's a 15% discount, John is paying 85% of the total amount. Because 100% minus 15% is 85%.\n\nSo, 85% of 216 is the amount he has to pay. To find 85% of 216, multiply 216 by 0.85.\n\n216 times 0.85: 200 times 0.85 is 170, and 16 times 0.85 is 13.6, so total is 170 plus 13.6, which is 183.6. So, same result, $183.6.\n\nAlright, that makes sense. So, John will pay $183.6 after the discount.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{183.6} \\]"
