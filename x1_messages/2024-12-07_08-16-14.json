        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a set of numbers from 1 to n, and we want to find out how many subsets include the number 1. Assuming n is greater than 1, which it is since n > 1.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics about sets and subsets. A set with n elements has a total of 2^n subsets, including the empty set and the set itself. That's a fundamental property of sets.\n\nNow, the question is specifically asking for subsets that include the number 1. So, I need to find out how many of those 2^n subsets contain the number 1.\n\n**Solution 1:**\n\nOne way to think about this is to consider that if a subset must include the number 1, then we can treat 1 as a fixed element that is always included. That means, for each subset that includes 1, the remaining elements can be any combination of the other numbers in the set.\n\nSo, if the set is {1, 2, 3, ..., n}, and 1 is always included, then the subsets we're interested in are all possible combinations of the remaining n-1 elements, each either included or not, along with 1.\n\nTherefore, the number of subsets containing 1 should be equal to the number of subsets of the remaining n-1 elements, which is 2^{n-1}.\n\nThis seems straightforward. Let me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\n**Solution 2:**\n\nAnother approach is to consider the total number of subsets and subtract those that do not contain 1.\n\nWe know that the total number of subsets is 2^n.\n\nThe number of subsets that do not contain 1 is equal to the number of subsets of the set {2, 3, ..., n}, which has n-1 elements. So, there are 2^{n-1} subsets that do not include 1.\n\nTherefore, the number of subsets that do include 1 is the total number of subsets minus the number of subsets that don't include 1, which is 2^n - 2^{n-1}.\n\nSimplifying that, 2^n - 2^{n-1} = 2^{n-1}(2 - 1) = 2^{n-1}.\n\nSo, this again gives us 2^{n-1} subsets that include 1.\n\nInteresting, both methods give the same answer. Maybe there's another way to think about it.\n\n**Solution 3:**\n\nLet's think about building subsets step by step.\n\nStart with the empty set. To include 1, we must add 1 to it. Then, for each of the remaining n-1 elements, we have a choice: include it or not.\n\nSo, for each of the n-1 elements, there are 2 choices: included or not.\n\nTherefore, the total number of subsets that include 1 is 2^{n-1}.\n\nThis is similar to Solution 1, but perhaps a bit more intuitive in terms of the process of building the subsets.\n\n**Solution 4:**\n\nPerhaps we can use combinations to figure this out.\n\nThe total number of subsets of a set with n elements is the sum of combinations: C(n,0) + C(n,1) + ... + C(n,n).\n\nSimilarly, the number of subsets that include 1 would be the sum of C(n-1, k-1) for k from 1 to n, because we're fixing one element (1) and choosing the remaining k-1 elements from the other n-1 elements.\n\nSo, sum from k=1 to n of C(n-1, k-1) = sum from m=0 to n-1 of C(n-1, m) = 2^{n-1}.\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier result.\n\n**Solution 5:**\n\nLet's consider a recursive approach.\n\nSuppose we have a set with n elements, and we want to find the number of subsets that include 1.\n\nIf we remove element n from the set, then the number of subsets that include 1 in the reduced set {1, 2, ..., n-1} is 2^{n-2}.\n\nWhen we add element n back, for each subset that includes 1 in the reduced set, we can choose to include n or not.\n\nTherefore, the number of subsets that include 1 in the full set is 2 * 2^{n-2} = 2^{n-1}.\n\nThis again aligns with the previous solutions.\n\n**Solution 6:**\n\nPerhaps we can think in terms of binary representations.\n\nEach subset can be represented by a binary string of length n, where each bit indicates whether the corresponding element is included (1) or not (0).\n\nSubsets that include 1 correspond to binary strings where the first bit is 1.\n\nThe number of such binary strings is 2^{n-1}, since the first bit is fixed to 1, and the remaining n-1 bits can be anything.\n\nThis is yet another way to arrive at the same answer.\n\n**Ranking the solutions:**\n\nAll these solutions lead to the same conclusion that the number of subsets containing 1 is 2^{n-1}. However, some methods might be more intuitive or easier to understand than others.\n\n- **Solution 1 and Solution 3** are straightforward and intuitive, focusing on fixing one element and considering the combinations of the rest.\n\n- **Solution 2** uses the principle of subtraction, which is also clear and relies on basic set theory.\n\n- **Solution 4** uses combinations, which might be a bit more formal but still straightforward.\n\n- **Solution 5** employs a recursive approach, which could be more complex for some but provides a different perspective.\n\n- **Solution 6** uses binary representations, which is a nice connection to binary systems and can be helpful for those familiar with binary notation.\n\nIn terms of validity, all solutions are valid and correct. However, for educational purposes, Solutions 1, 2, and 3 might be the most accessible because they rely on basic principles of set theory and combinatorics.\n\n**Decision on the best answer:**\n\nGiven that all solutions converge to the same answer and are valid, the best approach is likely the simplest one that is easiest to understand and explain. Therefore, I would recommend **Solution 1** or **Solution 2** as the go-to methods for this problem.\n\n- **Solution 1:** By fixing 1 as included and considering all combinations of the remaining n-1 elements, leading to 2^{n-1} subsets.\n\n- **Solution 2:** By subtracting the number of subsets that do not include 1 (2^{n-1}) from the total number of subsets (2^n), resulting in 2^{n-1} subsets that include 1.\n\nBoth methods are direct and require minimal background knowledge beyond basic set theory and combinatorics.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{2^{n-1}}"
