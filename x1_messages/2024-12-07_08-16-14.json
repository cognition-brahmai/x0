        "content": "So if a store sells 12 apples in an hour, and we want to know how many it sells in a week, we need to figure out how many hours are in a week and then multiply that by 12.\n\nFirst, let's think about how many hours are in a day. There are 24 hours in a day, right? And there are 7 days in a week. So, to find the number of hours in a week, we can multiply 24 hours by 7 days.\n\n24 hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 168 hours/week\n\nNow, if the store sells 12 apples every hour, then in 168 hours, it would sell:\n\n12 apples/hour \u00d7 168 hours/week = 2,016 apples/week\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that multiplication. 12 times 168.\n\n12 \u00d7 100 = 1,200\n\n12 \u00d7 60 = 720\n\n12 \u00d7 8 = 96\n\nNow, add those up: 1,200 + 720 = 1,920, and then 1,920 + 96 = 2,016.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the store sells 2,016 apples in a week.\n\nBut, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this. For example, does the store open every hour of every day? Maybe the store is closed for some hours in a day.\n\nIf the store is not open 24 hours a day, then we need to adjust our calculation based on the actual operating hours.\n\nAssuming the store is open for, say, 12 hours a day, then the number of hours in a week would be:\n\n12 hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 84 hours/week\n\nThen, the number of apples sold in a week would be:\n\n12 apples/hour \u00d7 84 hours/week = 1,008 apples/week\n\nWait, but the initial assumption was that the store sells 12 apples per hour, regardless of whether it's open or not. But realistically, if the store is only open 12 hours a day, then we should use 12 hours/day.\n\nBut to clarify, let's ask: Is the store open 24 hours a day or only during certain hours?\n\nSince the question doesn't specify the store's operating hours, perhaps the initial assumption of 24 hours a day is not accurate.\n\nLet's assume the store is open for 12 hours each day, which is a common business hour setup.\n\nSo, 12 hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 84 hours/week\n\nThen, 12 apples/hour \u00d7 84 hours/week = 1,008 apples/week\n\nAlternatively, if the store is open only on weekdays, say 12 hours a day for 5 days a week, then:\n\n12 hours/day \u00d7 5 days/week = 60 hours/week\n\n12 apples/hour \u00d7 60 hours/week = 720 apples/week\n\nBut the question doesn't specify the store's operating days, so perhaps assuming it's open 7 days a week is safer, unless stated otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the store has different sales rates at different times. For example, maybe it sells more apples during peak hours.\n\nBut again, since the question doesn't provide that level of detail, perhaps it's safest to assume a constant sales rate of 12 apples per hour whenever the store is open, and that it's open a standard number of hours per day.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 12 apples per hour is based on the store's operating hours. For example, if it's open 12 hours a day, selling 12 apples per hour, then daily sales would be 12 apples/hour \u00d7 12 hours/day = 144 apples/day.\n\nThen, over a week (7 days), that would be 144 apples/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 1,008 apples/week\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if the store is open 24 hours a day, then:\n\n12 apples/hour \u00d7 24 hours/day = 288 apples/day\n\n288 apples/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 2,016 apples/week\n\nBut unless specified, it's perhaps more reasonable to assume standard business hours, which are often 12 hours a day.\n\nTherefore, assuming 12 hours of operation per day, the store sells 1,008 apples in a week.\n\nHowever, to provide a more general answer, we can express the total weekly sales in terms of the store's daily operating hours.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nh = number of hours the store is open per day\n\nThen, the number of hours the store is open per week is h \u00d7 7\n\nThe number of apples sold per week is 12 apples/hour \u00d7 h hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 84h apples/week\n\nWithout a specific value for h, this is as far as we can go.\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify h, perhaps the initial assumption of 24 hours a day was incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 12 apples per hour includes only the hours when the store is open.\n\nIn that case, if the store is open h hours a day, then it sells 12h apples per day, and 84h apples per week.\n\nAgain, without knowing h, we can't compute a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 12 apples per hour is an average over the entire week, including closed hours.\n\nBut that seems less likely.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the store's operating hours, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the store is open for a standard number of hours per day.\n\nGiven that, and without specific information, using h = 12 hours/day seems reasonable.\n\nTherefore, total apples sold per week = 12 apples/hour \u00d7 12 hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 1,008 apples/week\n\nAlternatively, if the store is open 24 hours a day, then it would be 12 apples/hour \u00d7 24 hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 2,016 apples/week\n\nBut in the absence of specific information, perhaps it's best to stick with 1,008 apples/week as a more conservative estimate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store has different sales rates at different times of the day.\n\nFor example, maybe it sells more apples during lunch hours or in the evening.\n\nBut again, without specific data, it's hard to account for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are holidays or closure days in the week that affect the total sales.\n\nBut again, without specific information, we can't adjust for that.\n\nTherefore, assuming the store is open 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, selling 12 apples per hour, the total weekly sales would be 1,008 apples.\n\nAlternatively, if the store is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, then it would be 2,016 apples per week.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the answer should be presented in terms of the store's operating hours.\n\nFor example:\n\nTotal apples sold per week = 12 apples/hour \u00d7 h hours/day \u00d7 d days/week\n\nWhere h is the number of hours the store is open per day, and d is the number of days it's open per week.\n\nThen, the user can plug in the specific values for h and d.\n\nBut since the question doesn't provide these values, perhaps providing a formula is the most accurate response.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume standard business hours, say 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, then:\n\nTotal apples sold per week = 12 apples/hour \u00d7 12 hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 1,008 apples/week\n\nAlternatively, if the store is open fewer days, say 5 days a week, then:\n\nTotal apples sold per week = 12 apples/hour \u00d7 12 hours/day \u00d7 5 days/week = 720 apples/week\n\nGiven this uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to calculate based on the store being open 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, leading to 1,008 apples sold per week.\n\nAlternatively, if the store is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, then it would be 2,016 apples per week.\n\nBut in reality, many stores are not open 24 hours a day, so 1,008 apples per week seems more plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store has different sales rates at different times.\n\nFor example, maybe during peak hours it sells 20 apples per hour, and during off-peak hours, 5 apples per hour.\n\nBut again, without specific information, we can't account for that.\n\nGiven all this, perhaps the simplest and most straightforward approach is to assume the store is open 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, leading to 1,008 apples sold per week.\n\nTherefore, the store sells approximately 1,008 apples in a week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1008} \\]"
