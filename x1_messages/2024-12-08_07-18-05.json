        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company with 100 employees, and they are divided into managers and workers. Each manager makes $5000 per month, and each worker makes $3000 per month. The total monthly salary paid by the company is $380,000. We need to find out how many managers and how many workers there are.\n\nFirst, I think I should define variables for the number of managers and workers. Let's say:\n\n- Let m be the number of managers.\n\n- Let w be the number of workers.\n\nNow, according to the problem, the total number of employees is 100, so:\n\nm + w = 100\n\nThat's one equation.\n\nNext, the total monthly salary is $380,000. Since each manager earns $5000 and each worker earns $3000, the total salary can be expressed as:\n\n5000m + 3000w = 380,000\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) m + w = 100\n\n2) 5000m + 3000w = 380,000\n\nThis looks like a system of linear equations, which I can solve using substitution or elimination. I think I'll use the substitution method.\n\nFrom equation 1, I can express w in terms of m:\n\nw = 100 - m\n\nNow, I can substitute this expression for w into equation 2:\n\n5000m + 3000(100 - m) = 380,000\n\nNow, let's expand and simplify this equation:\n\n5000m + 3000*100 - 3000m = 380,000\n\n5000m + 300,000 - 3000m = 380,000\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n(5000m - 3000m) + 300,000 = 380,000\n\n2000m + 300,000 = 380,000\n\nNow, subtract 300,000 from both sides:\n\n2000m = 80,000\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2000:\n\nm = 80,000 / 2000\n\nm = 40\n\nSo, there are 40 managers.\n\nNow, substitute m back into the expression for w:\n\nw = 100 - m = 100 - 40 = 60\n\nTherefore, there are 40 managers and 60 workers.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nTotal salary:\n\n(40 managers * $5000) + (60 workers * $3000) = $200,000 + $180,000 = $380,000\n\nThat matches the total given in the problem.\n\nAlso, the total number of employees is 40 + 60 = 100, which is correct.\n\nSo, the solution seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40 \\text{ managers and } 60 \\text{ workers}} \\]"
