        "content": "Certainly! Reversing a string without using built-in reverse functions can be a great way to understand string manipulation in JavaScript. One common approach is to iterate through the string from the end to the beginning and build a new string with the characters in reverse order.\n\nHere's a simple program that does that:\n\n```javascript\nfunction reverseString(str) {\n    let reversed = '';\n    for (let i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n        reversed += str[i];\n    }\n    return reversed;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst original = \"hello\";\nconst reversed = reverseString(original);\nconsole.log(reversed); // Output: \"olleh\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: We define a function `reverseString` that takes a single parameter `str`, which is the string to be reversed.\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize an empty string `reversed` that will store the reversed string.\n3. **Loop**: We use a `for` loop to iterate over the string from the last character to the first.\n   - `let i = str.length - 1;` starts the counter at the last index of the string.\n   - `i >= 0;` ensures the loop runs until the first character.\n   - `i--` decrements the counter in each iteration.\n4. **String Concatenation**: Inside the loop, we concatenate each character to the `reversed` string.\n5. **Return**: Finally, the function returns the `reversed` string.\n\nThis method is straightforward and efficient for reversing strings without relying on built-in functions.
