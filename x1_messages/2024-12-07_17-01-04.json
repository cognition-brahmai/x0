        "content": "So, I've got this problem here about a car traveling at different speeds for different amounts of time, and I need to find out the total distance it travels. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, the car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours. Then, it travels at an average speed of 40 miles per hour for another 2 hours. I need to find the total distance traveled.\n\nI remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. So, for the first part, the distance should be 60 mph times 3 hours, and for the second part, it's 40 mph times 2 hours. Then, I just add those two distances together to get the total distance.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nDistance 1 = Speed 1 \u00d7 Time 1\n\nDistance 2 = Speed 2 \u00d7 Time 2\n\nTotal Distance = Distance 1 + Distance 2\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDistance 1 = 60 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 180 miles\n\nDistance 2 = 40 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 80 miles\n\nTotal Distance = 180 miles + 80 miles = 260 miles\n\nSo, the total distance traveled by the car is 260 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe by calculating the average speed for the entire trip and then multiplying by the total time.\n\nLet's see:\n\nTotal time traveled is 3 hours + 2 hours = 5 hours.\n\nIf I could find the average speed over the entire trip, then multiply that by the total time, I should get the same distance.\n\nAverage speed is total distance divided by total time. But I don't know the total distance yet; that's what I'm trying to find. So, maybe this isn't the best approach right now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I could use the concept of harmonic mean for the speeds since it's about rates and times.\n\nThe harmonic mean is useful when dealing with rates where the same distance is traveled at different speeds. But in this case, the distances are different because the times are different.\n\nHmm.\n\nActually, in this scenario, since the times are different and not the distances, using the harmonic mean might not be straightforward. Maybe it's simpler to stick with the initial approach of calculating each part separately and then adding them up.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst part: 60 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 180 miles\n\nSecond part: 40 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 80 miles\n\nTotal: 180 + 80 = 260 miles\n\nThat seems straightforward and correct.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Like, are there any breaks or stops mentioned? No, the problem just states the speeds and times for each part of the trip.\n\nAlso, it mentions \"average speed,\" which suggests that the speed wasn't constant, but for calculating distance, using the average speed should give the correct result.\n\nSo, I think 260 miles is the right answer.\n\nBut maybe to be thorough, I can consider the concept of average speed over the entire trip.\n\nIf I have the total distance and the total time, then the average speed is total distance divided by total time.\n\nI already have the total distance as 260 miles and the total time as 5 hours, so the average speed would be 260 miles / 5 hours = 52 mph.\n\nDoes that make sense? Well, the car traveled faster for a longer period of time in the first part, so the average should be closer to 60 mph than to 40 mph.\n\nLet me check: 60 mph for 3 hours covers 180 miles, and 40 mph for 2 hours covers 80 miles, totaling 260 miles in 5 hours, which is indeed 52 mph. That checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to calculate the average speed using the harmonic mean, it would be:\n\nHarmonic mean = (2 \u00d7 Speed1 \u00d7 Speed2) / (Speed1 + Speed2) = (2 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 40) / (60 + 40) = (4800) / (100) = 48 mph\n\nBut that doesn't match the actual average speed of 52 mph, so it's not applicable here because, again, the times are different for each speed.\n\nTherefore, the initial method is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the distance-time graph, where the distance increases at different rates over different time intervals. The total distance would be the sum of the areas under the speed-time graph for each interval.\n\nIn the first 3 hours, the area would be a rectangle with height 60 mph and width 3 hours, giving 180 miles. In the next 2 hours, the area would be a rectangle with height 40 mph and width 2 hours, giving 80 miles. Adding them up gives 260 miles again.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I keep arriving at the same answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The total distance traveled by the car is 260 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{260} \\]"
