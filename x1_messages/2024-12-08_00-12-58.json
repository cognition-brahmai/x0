        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a class of 30 students, and they play different sports: soccer, basketball, and volleyball. Specifically, 18 play soccer, 20 play basketball, and 22 play volleyball. Additionally, we know that 6 students play all three sports. We need to find out how many students play only one sport.\n\nFirst, I think it would be helpful to use a Venn diagram to visualize the overlaps between the students playing these sports. In a Venn diagram for three sets, there are several regions: students playing only soccer, only basketball, only volleyball, soccer and basketball but not volleyball, soccer and volleyball but not basketball, basketball and volleyball but not soccer, and all three sports.\n\nWe're given that 6 students play all three sports. That fills in the center of the Venn diagram.\n\nNext, let's denote the following:\n\n- Let S be the set of students playing soccer.\n\n- Let B be the set of students playing basketball.\n\n- Let V be the set of students playing volleyball.\n\nWe know that:\n\n- |S| = 18\n\n- |B| = 20\n\n- |V| = 22\n\n- |S \u2229 B \u2229 V| = 6\n\nWe need to find the number of students who play only one sport. That means we need to find the number of students who play soccer but not basketball or volleyball, plus those who play basketball but not soccer or volleyball, plus those who play volleyball but not soccer or basketball.\n\nIn set notation, that's:\n\n|S - (B \u222a V)| + |B - (S \u222a V)| + |V - (S \u222a B)|\n\nAlternatively, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of students playing at least one sport and then subtract those playing two or three sports to find those playing only one.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of students playing at least one sport using inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|S \u222a B \u222a V| = |S| + |B| + |V| - |S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 V| - |B \u2229 V| + |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|\n\nWe know |S \u222a B \u222a V| can't be more than 30, since there are only 30 students in the class.\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n|S \u222a B \u222a V| = 18 + 20 + 22 - |S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 V| - |B \u2229 V| + 6\n\nSimplify that:\n\n|S \u222a B \u222a V| = 66 - (|S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V|)\n\nBut |S \u222a B \u222a V| \u2264 30, so:\n\n66 - (|S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V|) \u2264 30\n\nTherefore:\n\n|S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V| \u2265 36\n\nWait a minute, that seems off because the total number of students is 30, but the sum of individual sets is 18 + 20 + 22 = 60, which is already more than 30, indicating significant overlaps.\n\nLet me recall that |S \u2229 B \u2229 V| = 6, so perhaps I can express the pairwise intersections in terms of the only pairwise overlaps and the triple overlap.\n\nGenerally, in a Venn diagram, the pairwise intersection |S \u2229 B| includes those who play only soccer and basketball plus those who play all three. Similarly for the other pairwise intersections.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\n- |S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 B \u2229 V| = number of students playing only soccer and basketball.\n\n- |S \u2229 V| - |S \u2229 B \u2229 V| = number of students playing only soccer and volleyball.\n\n- |B \u2229 V| - |S \u2229 B \u2229 V| = number of students playing only basketball and volleyball.\n\nLet's call these:\n\n- Only S and B: x\n\n- Only S and V: y\n\n- Only B and V: z\n\nSo, |S \u2229 B| = x + 6\n\n|S \u2229 V| = y + 6\n\n|B \u2229 V| = z + 6\n\nNow, let's express the total number of students playing at least one sport again using inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|S \u222a B \u222a V| = |S| + |B| + |V| - |S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 V| - |B \u2229 V| + |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|\n\nPlugging in the expressions:\n\n|S \u222a B \u222a V| = 18 + 20 + 22 - (x + 6) - (y + 6) - (z + 6) + 6\n\nSimplify:\n\n|S \u222a B \u222a V| = 58 - x - y - z\n\nBut we also know that the total number of students is 30, and some may not play any sports. However, the problem doesn't mention students who don't play any sports, so I'll assume that all 30 students play at least one sport.\n\nTherefore:\n\n|S \u222a B \u222a V| = 30\n\nSo:\n\n58 - x - y - z = 30\n\nTherefore:\n\nx + y + z = 28\n\nAlright, now we need to find the number of students who play only one sport. That would be:\n\nOnly S: |S| - (x + y + 6)\n\nOnly B: |B| - (x + z + 6)\n\nOnly V: |V| - (y + z + 6)\n\nLet's compute each one:\n\nOnly S: 18 - (x + y + 6) = 18 - x - y - 6 = 12 - x - y\n\nOnly B: 20 - (x + z + 6) = 20 - x - z - 6 = 14 - x - z\n\nOnly V: 22 - (y + z + 6) = 22 - y - z - 6 = 16 - y - z\n\nNow, the total number of students playing only one sport would be the sum of these three:\n\nOnly one sport = (12 - x - y) + (14 - x - z) + (16 - y - z)\n\nSimplify:\n\nOnly one sport = 12 - x - y + 14 - x - z + 16 - y - z\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nOnly one sport = (12 + 14 + 16) - 2x - 2y - 2z\n\nOnly one sport = 42 - 2(x + y + z)\n\nBut we previously found that x + y + z = 28\n\nTherefore:\n\nOnly one sport = 42 - 2(28) = 42 - 56 = -14\n\nWait, that can't be right. You can't have a negative number of students. Clearly, I've made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check my steps.\n\nFirst, I assumed that |S \u222a B \u222a V| = 30, which may not be the case if there are students who don't play any sports. Maybe that's where I went wrong.\n\nLet me revisit that assumption.\n\nThe problem states: \"In a class of 30 students, 18 play soccer, 20 play basketball, and 22 play volleyball. If 6 students play all three sports, how many students play only one sport?\"\n\nIt doesn't specify whether all students play at least one sport, so perhaps some students don't play any sports.\n\nLet me adjust my approach.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- N = total number of students = 30\n\n- |S \u222a B \u222a V| = number of students playing at least one sport\n\n- Students playing no sports = N - |S \u222a B \u222a V|\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion again:\n\n|S \u222a B \u222a V| = |S| + |B| + |V| - |S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 V| - |B \u2229 V| + |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|\n\nWe can express |S \u2229 B|, |S \u2229 V|, and |B \u2229 V| in terms of x, y, z as before:\n\n|S \u2229 B| = x + 6\n\n|S \u2229 V| = y + 6\n\n|B \u2229 V| = z + 6\n\nSo:\n\n|S \u222a B \u222a V| = 18 + 20 + 22 - (x + 6) - (y + 6) - (z + 6) + 6\n\nSimplify:\n\n|S \u222a B \u222a V| = 58 - x - y - z\n\nBut now, since N = 30, and |S \u222a B \u222a V| could be less than or equal to 30, depending on the overlaps.\n\nPreviously, I assumed |S \u222a B \u222a V| = 30, which led to x + y + z = 28. But then calculating only one sport gave a negative number, which is impossible.\n\nThis suggests that my assumption might be wrong, or there's an error in the calculations.\n\nLet me consider that some students don't play any sports, so |S \u222a B \u222a V| < 30.\n\nLet\u2019s denote |S \u222a B \u222a V| = n, where n \u2264 30.\n\nThen, n = 58 - x - y - z\n\nTherefore, x + y + z = 58 - n\n\nNow, the number of students playing only one sport is:\n\nOnly one sport = (12 - x - y) + (14 - x - z) + (16 - y - z) = 42 - 2(x + y + z) = 42 - 2(58 - n) = 42 - 116 + 2n = 2n - 74\n\nBut we also know that the total number of students playing at least one sport is n, and the total number of students is 30, so students playing no sports = 30 - n\n\nHowever, we need to find only one sport in terms of known quantities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this problem.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the principle of inclusion-exclusion again, but this time solve for n.\n\nWe have:\n\nn = |S \u222a B \u222a V| = |S| + |B| + |V| - |S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 V| - |B \u2229 V| + |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nn = 18 + 20 + 22 - |S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 V| - |B \u2229 V| + 6 = 66 - (|S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V|)\n\nBut we also have:\n\n|S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V| = (number of students playing exactly two sports) + 3(|S \u2229 B \u2229 V|)\n\nSince those playing all three sports are counted in each of the pairwise intersections.\n\nTherefore:\n\n|S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V| = (only S and B) + (only S and V) + (only B and V) + 3*(all three)\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- only S and B: a\n\n- only S and V: b\n\n- only B and V: c\n\nThen:\n\n|S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V| = a + b + c + 3*6 = a + b + c + 18\n\nNow, plugging back into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\nn = 66 - (a + b + c + 18) = 66 - a - b - c - 18 = 48 - a - b - c\n\nBut we also have:\n\nn = number of students playing at least one sport \u2264 30\n\nTherefore:\n\n48 - a - b - c \u2264 30 \u21d2 a + b + c \u2265 18\n\nNow, the number of students playing only one sport would be:\n\nonly S: |S| - (a + b + 6)\n\nonly B: |B| - (a + c + 6)\n\nonly V: |V| - (b + c + 6)\n\nTherefore, only one sport = (18 - a - b - 6) + (20 - a - c - 6) + (22 - b - c - 6) = (12 - a - b) + (14 - a - c) + (16 - b - c) = 42 - 2a - 2b - 2c\n\nSimplify:\n\nonly one sport = 42 - 2(a + b + c)\n\nBut from earlier, n = 48 - a - b - c\n\nAnd n \u2264 30, so a + b + c \u2265 18\n\nLet\u2019s denote a + b + c = x, where x \u2265 18\n\nThen, only one sport = 42 - 2x\n\nAnd n = 48 - x\n\nBut n \u2264 30, so 48 - x \u2264 30 \u21d2 x \u2265 18, which matches our earlier inequality.\n\nAlso, since n is the number of students playing at least one sport, and total students are 30, students playing no sports = 30 - n = 30 - (48 - x) = x - 18\n\nBut the number of students playing no sports can't be negative, so x - 18 \u2265 0 \u21d2 x \u2265 18, which again matches.\n\nNow, to find only one sport = 42 - 2x\n\nBut we need to find a specific value for only one sport, so perhaps there's another equation or constraint we can use.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the total number of students playing at least one sport is n = 48 - x\n\nBut n cannot exceed 30, so n = 30 when x = 18\n\nIf x > 18, then n < 30, but since n has to be an integer and x has to be an integer, let's see what makes sense.\n\nWait, perhaps we can find x by considering the maximum possible n, which is 30.\n\nSo, n = 48 - x \u2264 30 \u21d2 x \u2265 18\n\nAlso, students playing no sports = x - 18\n\nNow, to find only one sport = 42 - 2x\n\nBut x \u2265 18, so only one sport = 42 - 2x \u2264 42 - 36 = 6\n\nBut let's see if x can be exactly 18.\n\nIf x = 18, then n = 48 - 18 = 30, which matches the total number of students, meaning no student plays no sports.\n\nThen, only one sport = 42 - 2*18 = 42 - 36 = 6\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf x = 18, and n = 30, then students playing no sports = 0.\n\nNow, let's verify if this satisfies all the given numbers.\n\nTotal playing at least one sport: n = 30\n\nNumber playing exactly two sports: a + b + c = x - 3*|all three| = 18 - 18 = 0\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no. Earlier, we denoted a, b, c as only playing exactly two sports, so a + b + c is the number of students playing exactly two sports.\n\nBut we have |S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V| = a + b + c + 3*6 = a + b + c + 18\n\nBut a + b + c = x = 18, so |S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V| = 18 + 18 = 36\n\nEarlier, we had |S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V| \u2265 36, and here it equals 36 when x = 18.\n\nSo, with x = 18, n = 30, and only one sport = 6.\n\nLet me see if this adds up.\n\nStudents playing only one sport: 6\n\nStudents playing exactly two sports: a + b + c = 18\n\nStudents playing all three sports: 6\n\nTotal students playing at least one sport: only one + exactly two + all three = 6 + 18 + 6 = 30, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the number of students playing only one sport is 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
