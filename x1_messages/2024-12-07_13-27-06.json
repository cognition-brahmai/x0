This game will allow two players to play against each other, and it will check for a winner or a draw after each move.\n\nFirst, we need to set up the game board. We'll represent the board as a 3x3 grid, and we'll use numbers 1 through 9 to represent the positions on the board.\n\nHere's a rough plan:\n\n1. **Display the board**: Show the current state of the board to the players.\n\n2. **Player input**: Ask the current player to enter their move (a number between 1 and 9).\n\n3. **Validate input**: Check if the chosen position is empty and within the valid range.\n\n4. **Update the board**: Place the player's mark ('X' or 'O') on the selected position.\n\n5. **Check for win or draw**: After each move, check if the current player has won or if the game is a draw.\n\n6. **Switch players**: Alternate between players after each valid move.\n\nLet's start by writing some code.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++, we need to implement a program that allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The game should check for a win or a draw after each move.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Board Representation**: Use a 1D array of size 10 (ignoring index 0 for simplicity) to represent the 3x3 grid.\n2. **Display Board**: Function to print the current state of the board.\n3. **Player Input**: Function to handle player input and update the board.\n4. **Win Check**: Function to check if the current player has won.\n5. **Draw Check**: Function to check if the game is a draw.\n6. **Game Loop**: Main loop to handle turns and game flow.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function to draw the Tic-Tac-Toe board\nvoid drawBoard(char board[]) {\n    cout << \"     |     |     \" << endl;\n    cout << \"  \" << board[1] << \"  |  \" << board[2] << \"  |  \" << board[3] << \"  \" << endl;\n    cout << \"_____|_____|_____\" << endl;\n    cout << \"     |     |     \" << endl;\n    cout << \"  \" << board[4] << \"  |  \" << board[5] << \"  |  \" << board[6] << \"  \" << endl;\n    cout << \"_____|_____|_____\" << endl;\n    cout << \"     |     |     \" << endl;\n    cout << \"  \" << board[7] << \"  |  \" << board[8] << \"  |  \" << board[9] << \"  \" << endl;\n    cout << \"     |     |     \" << endl;\n}\n\n// Function to check if a player has won\nbool checkWin(char board[], char player) {\n    // Check horizontal lines\n    for (int i = 1; i <= 7; i += 3) {\n        if (board[i] == player && board[i+1] == player && board[i+2] == player) return true;\n    }\n    // Check vertical lines\n    for (int i = 1; i <= 3; ++i) {\n        if (board[i] == player && board[i+3] == player && board[i+6] == player) return true;\n    }\n    // Check diagonals\n    if (board[1] == player && board[5] == player && board[9] == player) return true;\n    if (board[3] == player && board[5] == player && board[7] == player) return true;\n    return false;\n}\n\n// Function to check for a draw\nbool checkDraw(char board[]) {\n    for (int i = 1; i <= 9; ++i) {\n        if (board[i] != 'X' && board[i] != 'O') return false;\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    char board[10] = { '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9' };\n    bool gameOver = false;\n    char currentPlayer = 'X';\n\n    cout << \"Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe!\" << endl;\n\n    while (!gameOver) {\n        drawBoard(board);\n        int move;\n        cout << \"Player \" << currentPlayer << \", enter your move (1-9): \";\n        cin >> move;\n\n        // Check if the move is valid\n        if (move < 1 || move > 9 || board[move] == 'X' || board[move] == 'O') {\n            cout << \"Invalid move. Try again.\" << endl;\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        // Make the move\n        board[move] = currentPlayer;\n\n        // Check for a win\n        if (checkWin(board, currentPlayer)) {\n            drawBoard(board);\n            cout << \"Player \" << currentPlayer << \" wins!\" << endl;\n            gameOver = true;\n        }\n        // Check for a draw\n        else if (checkDraw(board)) {\n            drawBoard(board);\n            cout << \"It's a draw!\" << endl;\n            gameOver = true;\n        }\n        // Switch players\n        else {\n            currentPlayer = (currentPlayer == 'X') ? 'O' : 'X';\n        }\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Board Representation**: A character array `board` of size 10 is used to represent the grid positions 1 through 9.\n2. **Display Board**: The `drawBoard` function prints the current state of the board.\n3. **Player Input**: The main loop prompts the current player for their move and updates the board if the move is valid.\n4. **Win Check**: The `checkWin` function checks all possible winning combinations for the current player.\n5. **Draw Check**: The `checkDraw` function checks if all positions are filled and no player has won.\n6. **Game Loop**: The game alternates between players, checks for win or draw after each move, and ends when either condition is met.\n"
