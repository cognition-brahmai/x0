Now, 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Sense and Sensibility'\u2014those are pretty well-known books. I think I might know who wrote them.\n\nLet me think for a moment. I remember reading somewhere that these books were written by a woman. In fact, she was one of the first published women writers, and she's considered one of the greatest writers in English literature.\n\nI believe her name is Jane Austen. Yes, that sounds right. Jane Austen is famous for her novels that explore the lives of the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century. 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Sense and Sensibility' are two of her most renowned works.\n\nIn 'Sense and Sensibility,' she tells the story of the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, and their experiences with love and relationships, highlighting the contrast between practicality ('sense') and passion ('sensibility'). It was published in 1811.\n\nThen, 'Pride and Prejudice,' which was published in 1813, is perhaps her most famous work. It's a love story between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy, exploring themes of first impressions, social class, and the importance of knowing someone's true character beyond superficial traits like pride and prejudice.\n\nJane Austen's writing is known for its wit, irony, and her ability to portray the nuances of human relationships and society during her time. She's had a lasting impact on literature, and her works continue to be studied and enjoyed today.\n\nBesides these two novels, she also wrote 'Mansfield Park,' 'Emma,' 'Northanger Abbey,' and 'Persuasion,' all of which are also highly regarded.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the famous British author who penned 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Sense and Sensibility' is Jane Austen.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Jane Austen}} \\]"
