        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Bash script that watches a specific directory for any changes like new files, modifications, or deletions. Whenever something changes, it should log details like what happened, the file path, and when it occurred into a text file. Also, the script needs to keep running and check for these changes every minute.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to monitor a directory for changes in Bash. There are a few ways to do this. One common method is using the `inotify-tools` package, which provides a set of commands to monitor file system events. Another way is to use `find` command to look for files that have been modified within a certain time frame.\n\nBut since the script should run continuously and check every minute, maybe using a loop with `find` would be more straightforward. I can store the current state of the directory and compare it with the state in the next check.\n\nLet me outline the steps I think I need to take:\n\n1. **Initialize the script:** Set up variables for the directory to watch and the log file.\n\n2. **Capture the initial state:** Create a list of all files in the directory along with their modification times.\n\n3. **Set up an infinite loop:** That runs every minute.\n\n4. **Capture the current state:** Again, list all files with their modification times.\n\n5. **Compare the current state with the previous state:**\n\n- Identify new files (present now but not before).\n\n- Identify deleted files (present before but not now).\n\n- Identify modified files (files present in both states but with different modification times).\n\n6. **Log the changes:** For each type of change, record the event type, file path, and timestamp.\n\n7. **Update the previous state:** Set the current state as the previous state for the next iteration.\n\n8. **Wait for a minute:** Before checking again.\n\nI need to consider how to efficiently store and compare the states. Maybe using associative arrays in Bash to map file paths to their modification times.\n\nAlso, I should think about handling subdirectories. If the directory has subdirectories, I need to recursively list all files.\n\nLet me consider using `find` with options like `-type f` to list only files and `-printf` to get the file path and modification time.\n\nFor example:\n\n`find /path/to/directory -type f -printf '%P %T@\\n'`\n\nThis will list each file with its relative path and modification time in seconds since the epoch.\n\nI can store this output in a variable or a file for comparison.\n\nNow, for comparing two lists of files with their modification times, I need to check for additions, deletions, and modifications.\n\nOne way is to read both lists into arrays or associative arrays and then iterate through them to find differences.\n\nLet me sketch a rough structure of the script:\n\n```bash\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Configuration\n\nWATCH_DIR=\"/path/to/directory\"\n\nLOG_FILE=\"/path/to/logfile.txt\"\n\n# Function to log events\n\nlog_event() {\n\n    local event_type=\"$1\"\n\n    local file_path=\"$2\"\n\n    local timestamp=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S)\n\n    echo \"[$timestamp] $event_type: $file_path\" >> \"$LOG_FILE\"\n\n}\n\n# Initialize previous state\n\nPREV_STATE=$(find \"$WATCH_DIR\" -type f -printf '%P %T@\\n')\n\nwhile true; do\n\n    # Capture current state\n\n    CURR_STATE=$(find \"$WATCH_DIR\" -type f -printf '%P %T@\\n')\n\n    # Compare current and previous states\n\n    # Find new files\n\n    comm -23 <(echo \"$CURR_STATE\" | sort) <(echo \"$PREV_STATE\" | sort) | while read -r line; do\n\n        file_path=$(echo \"$line\" | awk '{print $1}')\n\n        log_event \"NEW\" \"$file_path\"\n\n    done\n\n    # Find deleted files\n\n    comm -13 <(echo \"$CURR_STATE\" | sort) <(echo \"$PREV_STATE\" | sort) | while read -r line; do\n\n        file_path=$(echo \"$line\" | awk '{print $1}')\n\n        log_event \"DELETED\" \"$file_path\"\n\n    done\n\n    # Find modified files\n\n    comm -3 <(echo \"$CURR_STATE\" | sort) <(echo \"$PREV_STATE\" | sort) | while read -r line; do\n\n        if [[ $(echo \"$line\" | wc -w) -eq 2 ]]; then\n\n            file_path=$(echo \"$line\" | awk '{print $1}')\n\n            log_event \"MODIFIED\" \"$file_path\"\n\n        fi\n\n    done\n\n    # Update previous state\n\n    PREV_STATE=$CURR_STATE\n\n    # Wait for a minute\n\n    sleep 60\n\ndone\n\n```\n\nThis seems like a good starting point. Let's break it down:\n\n- **Configuration:** Set the directory to watch and the log file path.\n\n- **log_event function:** A helper function to format and write log entries.\n\n- **Initialize previous state:** Use `find` to get the initial list of files with modification times.\n\n- **Infinite loop:**\n\n- Capture the current state using `find`.\n\n- Use `comm` to find differences between current and previous states.\n\n- `comm -23` finds lines unique to the first file (new files).\n\n- `comm -13` finds lines unique to the second file (deleted files).\n\n- `comm -3` finds lines common to both files but with differences (modified files).\n\n- Log the events accordingly.\n\n- Update the previous state with the current state.\n\n- Wait for 60 seconds using `sleep 60`.\n\nI need to make sure that `comm` is used correctly. `comm` compares sorted files line by line and can suppress or show columns based on options.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- `comm -23 a b` shows lines unique to file a (new files).\n\n- `comm -13 a b` shows lines unique to file b (deleted files).\n\n- `comm -3 a b` shows lines common to both files but with differences in the third column (modification time), indicating modified files.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that the modification time is compared correctly. Since `find` outputs `file_path modification_time`, and `comm` compares lines, if the modification time changes, the line will be different, indicating a modification.\n\nBut, in the `comm -3` output, it shows lines that are common in both files but with differences in the third column. In this case, if the modification time changes, the line will be different, and `comm -3` should capture that.\n\nWait, actually, `comm -3` suppresses the third column, which contains lines that are common in both files but with differences in the third field. But in my script, I'm using `comm -3` to find modified files, assuming that if the modification time has changed, the line will be different.\n\nBut actually, `comm -3` shows lines that are common in both files but with differences in the third field. So, if the modification time has changed, it should be caught here.\n\nHowever, I need to confirm if `comm` handles this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use other methods to compare the states, like using associative arrays in Bash to map file paths to their modification times and then compare them directly.\n\nLet me consider that approach.\n\nFirst, declare associative arrays for previous and current states.\n\nIn Bash, associative arrays are supported in version 4 and above, so I need to make sure that the shell is Bash 4 or higher.\n\nHere's how I can do it:\n\n- Use `declare -A` to declare associative arrays.\n\n- Read the output of `find` into the array, with file paths as keys and modification times as values.\n\n- Then, for each iteration:\n\n- Read the current state into a new associative array.\n\n- Compare the new array with the previous one to find additions, deletions, and modifications.\n\n- Update the previous array with the current one for the next iteration.\n\nThis might be more efficient and straightforward.\n\nLet me try rewriting the script using associative arrays.\n\n```bash\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Configuration\n\nWATCH_DIR=\"/path/to/directory\"\n\nLOG_FILE=\"/path/to/logfile.txt\"\n\n# Function to log events\n\nlog_event() {\n\n    local event_type=\"$1\"\n\n    local file_path=\"$2\"\n\n    local timestamp=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S)\n\n    echo \"[$timestamp] $event_type: $file_path\" >> \"$LOG_FILE\"\n\n}\n\n# Initialize previous state\n\ndeclare -A prev_state\n\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n\n    file_path=$(echo \"$line\" | awk '{print $1}')\n\n    mod_time=$(echo \"$line\" | awk '{print $2}')\n\n    prev_state[\"$file_path\"]=$mod_time\n\ndone < <(find \"$WATCH_DIR\" -type f -printf '%P %T@\\n')\n\nwhile true; do\n\n    # Capture current state\n\n    declare -A curr_state\n\n    while IFS= read -r line; do\n\n        file_path=$(echo \"$line\" | awk '{print $1}')\n\n        mod_time=$(echo \"$line\" | awk '{print $2}')\n\n        curr_state[\"$file_path\"]=$mod_time\n\n    done < <(find \"$WATCH_DIR\" -type f -printf '%P %T@\\n')\n\n    # Find new files\n\n    for file in \"${!curr_state[@]}\"; do\n\n        if [[ -z \"${prev_state[$file]}\" ]]; then\n\n            log_event \"NEW\" \"$file\"\n\n        elif [[ \"${prev_state[$file]}\" != \"${curr_state[$file]}\" ]]; then\n\n            log_event \"MODIFIED\" \"$file\"\n\n        fi\n\n    done\n\n    # Find deleted files\n\n    for file in \"${!prev_state[@]}\"; do\n\n        if [[ -z \"${curr_state[$file]}\" ]]; then\n\n            log_event \"DELETED\" \"$file\"\n\n        fi\n\n    done\n\n    # Update previous state\n\n    prev_state=(\"${curr_state[@]}\")\n\n    # Wait for a minute\n\n    sleep 60\n\ndone\n\n```\n\nThis seems better. Here's what's happening:\n\n- **Initialize previous state:** Use `find` to list all files with their modification times and store them in an associative array where keys are file paths and values are modification times.\n\n- **Infinite loop:**\n\n- Capture the current state in a new associative array.\n\n- **Find new files:** Iterate through the current state and check if the file exists in the previous state. If not, it's new.\n\n- **Find modified files:** If the file exists in both states but has a different modification time, it's modified.\n\n- **Find deleted files:** Iterate through the previous state and check if the file exists in the current state. If not, it's deleted.\n\n- **Update previous state:** Set the previous state to the current state for the next iteration.\n\n- **Wait for a minute:** Use `sleep 60`.\n\nThis approach seems clean and efficient. I need to make sure that associative arrays are supported in the shell where this script will run.\n\nAlso, I should handle any errors that might occur, like permission issues when reading files or if `find` command fails.\n\nLet me add some error handling.\n\nAdditionally, I can optimize the `find` command by using `-printf` to output the file path and modification time in a consistent format.\n\nI should also consider that file paths may contain spaces or special characters, so I need to handle them properly when storing in the associative arrays.\n\nBash associative arrays handle keys with spaces correctly, but I need to make sure that the `read` command handles lines with spaces properly.\n\nTo handle files with spaces in their names, I can use `read -r` and ensure that the IFS (Internal Field Separator) is set appropriately.\n\nIn the current script, I have `IFS= read -r line`, which should read the entire line, including spaces.\n\nHowever, when splitting the line into file path and modification time, I use `awk`, which should handle spaces in file names.\n\nLet me test this logic with a sample input.\n\nSuppose `find` outputs:\n\n```\n\nfile\\ with\\ space.txt 1633072800.000000000\n\nanother_file.txt 1633072801.000000000\n\n```\n\nIn the associative array, the keys would be `file with space.txt` and `another_file.txt`, with their respective modification times.\n\nThis should work fine.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that when comparing modification times, I'm using the correct format. The `%T@` format in `find` gives the modification time in seconds since the epoch with nanosecond precision.\n\nBut for comparison, do I need the full nanosecond precision? Maybe seconds are sufficient.\n\nTo simplify, I can truncate the modification time to seconds.\n\nIn the `find` command, I can use `%T@` and then cut the first 10 characters to get seconds.\n\nLike this:\n\n`find \"$WATCH_DIR\" -type f -printf '%P %T@\\n' | cut -d. -f1`\n\nThis will give me the modification time in seconds since the epoch.\n\nThis should be sufficient for detecting modifications, unless files are modified within the same second, which is less likely.\n\nThis will also make the comparison faster since we're dealing with integers instead of floating-point numbers.\n\nLet me adjust the script accordingly.\n\n```bash\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Configuration\n\nWATCH_DIR=\"/path/to/directory\"\n\nLOG_FILE=\"/path/to/logfile.txt\"\n\n# Function to log events\n\nlog_event() {\n\n    local event_type=\"$1\"\n\n    local file_path=\"$2\"\n\n    local timestamp=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S)\n\n    echo \"[$timestamp] $event_type: $file_path\" >> \"$LOG_FILE\"\n\n}\n\n# Initialize previous state\n\ndeclare -A prev_state\n\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n\n    file_path=$(echo \"$line\" | awk '{print $1}')\n\n    mod_time=$(echo \"$line\" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d. -f1)\n\n    prev_state[\"$file_path\"]=$mod_time\n\ndone < <(find \"$WATCH_DIR\" -type f -printf '%P %T@\\n')\n\nwhile true; do\n\n    # Capture current state\n\n    declare -A curr_state\n\n    while IFS= read -r line; do\n\n        file_path=$(echo \"$line\" | awk '{print $1}')\n\n        mod_time=$(echo \"$line\" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d. -f1)\n\n        curr_state[\"$file_path\"]=$mod_time\n\n    done < <(find \"$WATCH_DIR\" -type f -printf '%P %T@\\n')\n\n    # Find new files\n\n    for file in \"${!curr_state[@]}\"; do\n\n        if [[ -z \"${prev_state[$file]}\" ]]; then\n\n            log_event \"NEW\" \"$file\"\n\n        elif [[ \"${prev_state[$file]}\" != \"${curr_state[$file]}\" ]]; then\n\n            log_event \"MODIFIED\" \"$file\"\n\n        fi\n\n    done\n\n    # Find deleted files\n\n    for file in \"${!prev_state[@]}\"; do\n\n        if [[ -z \"${curr_state[$file]}\" ]]; then\n\n            log_event \"DELETED\" \"$file\"\n\n        fi\n\n    done\n\n    # Update previous state\n\n    prev_state=(\"${curr_state[@]}\")\n\n    # Wait for a minute\n\n    sleep 60\n\ndone\n\n```\n\nThis should work. I've truncated the modification time to seconds to make comparisons easier.\n\nNow, I need to think about potential edge cases and how to handle them.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n1. **Files with special characters in names:** Including spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.\n\n2. **Files being renamed:** Renaming a file is effectively a delete and a create.\n\n3. **Multiple changes in one minute:** The script only checks every minute, so multiple changes within a minute might be detected as a single modification.\n\n4. **Time changes:** If the system time is adjusted, it might affect the modification time comparisons.\n\n5. **Permissions:** The script might not have permission to read certain files or directories.\n\nTo handle these cases:\n\n1. **Special characters in file names:** Bash handles them fine as long as we read the lines correctly, which we are doing with `read -r`.\n\n2. **Renamed files:** Since we're tracking by file path, a rename would be detected as a delete of the old path and a create of the new path.\n\n3. **Multiple changes in one minute:** The script will only detect the final state compared to the previous check. To capture more granular changes, the check interval could be decreased, but that's beyond the scope of this task.\n\n4. **Time changes:** As long as the modification times are consistent with the system clock, this shouldn't be a problem. However, if the system time is rolled back, it might cause confusion in modification time comparisons.\n\n5. **Permissions:** We need to ensure that the script has the necessary permissions to read the directory and its contents. If not, `find` might fail to list some files, leading to incomplete state captures.\n\nI should add some error handling to manage cases where `find` fails or returns an error.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the log file is writable; otherwise, the log entries won't be recorded.\n\nLet me add some checks for these conditions.\n\nAdditionally, I can add a verbose mode or some debug outputs to help with troubleshooting.\n\nHere's an updated version with some error handling:\n\n```bash\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Configuration\n\nWATCH_DIR=\"/path/to/directory\"\n\nLOG_FILE=\"/path/to/logfile.txt\"\n\n# Function to log events\n\nlog_event() {\n\n    local event_type=\"$1\"\n\n    local file_path=\"$2\"\n\n    local timestamp=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S)\n\n    echo \"[$timestamp] $event_type: $file_path\" >> \"$LOG_FILE\" || {\n\n        echo \"Failed to write to log file.\" >&2\n\n        exit 1\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n# Function to capture state\n\ncapture_state() {\n\n    declare -A state=()\n\n    while IFS= read -r line; do\n\n        file_path=$(echo \"$line\" | awk '{print $1}')\n\n        mod_time=$(echo \"$line\" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d. -f1)\n\n        state[\"$file_path\"]=$mod_time\n\n    done < <(find \"$WATCH_DIR\" -type f -printf '%P %T@\\n' 2>/dev/null)\n\n    echo \"$(declare -p state)\"\n\n}\n\n# Initialize previous state\n\neval \"$(capture_state)\"\n\nwhile true; do\n\n    # Capture current state\n\n    eval \"$(capture_state)\"\n\n    # Find new files\n\n    for file in \"${!state[@]}\"; do\n\n        if [[ -z \"${prev_state[$file]}\" ]]; then\n\n            log_event \"NEW\" \"$file\"\n\n        elif [[ \"${prev_state[$file]}\" != \"${state[$file]}\" ]]; then\n\n            log_event \"MODIFIED\" \"$file\"\n\n        fi\n\n    done\n\n    # Find deleted files\n\n    for file in \"${!prev_state[@]}\"; do\n\n        if [[ -z \"${state[$file]}\" ]]; then\n\n            log_event \"DELETED\" \"$file\"\n\n        fi\n\n    done\n\n    # Update previous state\n\n    prev_state=(\"${state[@]}\")\n\n    # Wait for a minute\n\n    sleep 60\n\ndone\n\n```\n\nIn this version:\n\n- **capture_state function:** encapsulates the logic to capture the current state of the directory, storing file paths and their modification times in an associative array. It also redirects `find` errors to `/dev/null` to suppress permission denied messages.\n\n- **eval \"$(capture_state)\":** captures the state and evaluates the output to set the associative array.\n\n- **Error handling in log_event:** checks if writing to the log file succeeds and exits with an error message if it fails.\n\nThis should make the script more robust.\n\nI should also consider adding a header to the log file, perhaps when the script starts, to indicate the beginning of logging.\n\nAdditionally, it might be useful to have an option to specify the watch directory and log file via command-line arguments.\n\nLet me modify the script to accept command-line arguments for the directory and log file.\n\n```bash\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Check for correct number of arguments\n\nif [[ \"$#\" -ne 2 ]]; then\n\n    echo \"Usage: $0 /path/to/directory /path/to/logfile.txt\" >&2\n\n    exit 1\n\nfi\n\nWATCH_DIR=\"$1\"\n\nLOG_FILE=\"$2\"\n\n# Function to log events\n\nlog_event() {\n\n    local event_type=\"$1\"\n\n    local file_path=\"$2\"\n\n    local timestamp=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S)\n\n    echo \"[$timestamp] $event_type: $file_path\" >> \"$LOG_FILE\" || {\n\n        echo \"Failed to write to log file.\" >&2\n\n        exit 1\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n# Function to capture state\n\ncapture_state() {\n\n    declare -A state=()\n\n    while IFS= read -r line; do\n\n        file_path=$(echo \"$line\" | awk '{print $1}')\n\n        mod_time=$(echo \"$line\" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d. -f1)\n\n        state[\"$file_path\"]=$mod_time\n\n    done < <(find \"$WATCH_DIR\" -type f -printf '%P %T@\\n' 2>/dev/null)\n\n    echo \"$(declare -p state)\"\n\n}\n\n# Initialize previous state\n\neval \"$(capture_state)\"\n\nwhile true; do\n\n    # Capture current state\n\n    eval \"$(capture_state)\"\n\n    # Find new files\n\n    for file in \"${!state[@]}\"; do\n\n        if [[ -z \"${prev_state[$file]}\" ]]; then\n\n            log_event \"NEW\" \"$file\"\n\n        elif [[ \"${prev_state[$file]}\" != \"${state[$file]}\" ]]; then\n\n            log_event \"MODIFIED\" \"$file\"\n\n        fi\n\n    done\n\n    # Find deleted files\n\n    for file in \"${!prev_state[@]}\"; do\n\n        if [[ -z \"${state[$file]}\" ]]; then\n\n            log_event \"DELETED\" \"$file\"\n\n        fi\n\n    done\n\n    # Update previous state\n\n    prev_state=(\"${state[@]}\")\n\n    # Wait for a minute\n\n    sleep 60\n\ndone\n\n```\n\nNow, the script expects two arguments: the directory to watch and the log file path.\n\nThis makes it more flexible and reusable.\n\nI should also add some comments to the script for clarity, especially for someone who might read or modify the script later.\n\nAdditionally, I can add a header to the log file indicating when the monitoring started.\n\nHere's the final version of the script with comments and a log header:\n\n```bash\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Check for correct number of arguments\n\nif [[ \"$#\" -ne 2 ]]; then\n\n    echo \"Usage: $0 /path/to/directory /path/to/logfile.txt\" >&2\n\n    exit 1\n\nfi\n\nWATCH_DIR=\"$1\"\n\nLOG_FILE=\"$2\"\n\n# Function to log events\n\nlog_event() {\n\n    local event_type=\"$1\"\n\n    local file_path=\"$2\"\n\n    local timestamp=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S)\n\n    echo \"[$timestamp] $event_type: $file_path\" >> \"$LOG_FILE\" || {\n\n        echo \"Failed to write to log file.\" >&2\n\n        exit 1\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n# Function to capture state\n\ncapture_state() {\n\n    declare -A state=()\n\n    while IFS= read -r line; do\n\n        file_path=$(echo \"$line\" | awk '{print $1}')\n\n        mod_time=$(echo \"$line\" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d. -f1)\n\n        state[\"$file_path\"]=$mod_time\n\n    done < <(find \"$WATCH_DIR\" -type f -printf '%P %T@\\n' 2>/dev/null)\n\n    echo \"$(declare -p state)\"\n\n}\n\n# Initialize previous state\n\neval \"$(capture_state)\"\n\n# Log start of monitoring\n\nlog_event \"START\" \"$WATCH_DIR\"\n\nwhile true; do\n\n    # Capture current state\n\n    eval \"$(capture_state)\"\n\n    # Find new files\n\n    for file in \"${!state[@]}\"; do\n\n        if [[ -z \"${prev_state[$file]}\" ]]; then\n\n            log_event \"NEW\" \"$file\"\n\n        elif [[ \"${prev_state[$file]}\" != \"${state[$file]}\" ]]; then\n\n            log_event \"MODIFIED\" \"$file\"\n\n        fi\n\n    done\n\n    # Find deleted files\n\n    for file in \"${!prev_state[@]}\"; do\n\n        if [[ -z \"${state[$file]}\" ]]; then\n\n            log_event \"DELETED\" \"$file\"\n\n        fi\n\n    done\n\n    # Update previous state\n\n    prev_state=(\"${state[@]}\")\n\n    # Wait for a minute\n\n    sleep 60\n\ndone\n\n```\n\nThis script should now fulfill the requirements: it watches a specified directory for changes, logs events to a text file, and runs continuously, checking every minute.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo monitor a specified directory for changes and log these changes, you can use the following Bash script. This script will check for new files, modified files, or deleted files every minute and log the events with timestamps.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Check for correct number of arguments\n\nif [[ \"$#\" -ne 2 ]]; then\n\n    echo \"Usage: $0 /path/to/directory /path/to/logfile.txt\" >&2\n\n    exit 1\n\nfi\n\nWATCH_DIR=\"$1\"\n\nLOG_FILE=\"$2\"\n\n# Function to log events\n\nlog_event() {\n\n    local event_type=\"$1\"\n\n    local file_path=\"$2\"\n\n    local timestamp=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S)\n\n    echo \"[$timestamp] $event_type: $file_path\" >> \"$LOG_FILE\" || {\n\n        echo \"Failed to write to log file.\" >&2\n\n        exit 1\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n# Function to capture state\n\ncapture_state() {\n\n    declare -A state=()\n\n    while IFS= read -r line; do\n\n        file_path=$(echo \"$line\" | awk '{print $1}')\n\n        mod_time=$(echo \"$line\" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d. -f1)\n\n        state[\"$file_path\"]=$mod_time\n\n    done < <(find \"$WATCH_DIR\" -type f -printf '%P %T@\\n' 2>/dev/null)\n\n    echo \"$(declare -p state)\"\n\n}\n\n# Initialize previous state\n\neval \"$(capture_state)\"\n\n# Log start of monitoring\n\nlog_event \"START\" \"$WATCH_DIR\"\n\nwhile true; do\n\n    # Capture current state\n\n    eval \"$(capture_state)\"\n\n    # Find new files\n\n    for file in \"${!state[@]}\"; do\n\n        if [[ -z \"${prev_state[$file]}\" ]]; then\n\n            log_event \"NEW\" \"$file\"\n\n        elif [[ \"${prev_state[$file]}\" != \"${state[$file]}\" ]]; then\n\n            log_event \"MODIFIED\" \"$file\"\n\n        fi\n\n    done\n\n    # Find deleted files\n\n    for file in \"${!prev_state[@]}\"; do\n\n        if [[ -z \"${state[$file]}\" ]]; then\n\n            log_event \"DELETED\" \"$file\"\n\n        fi\n\n    done\n\n    # Update previous state\n\n    prev_state=(\"${state[@]}\")\n\n    # Wait for a minute\n\n    sleep 60\n\ndone\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - The script takes two arguments: the directory to watch and the log file path.\n   - It defines a function `log_event` to log events with timestamps.\n   - Another function `capture_state` captures the current state of the directory using `find` and stores it in an associative array.\n\n2. **Monitoring Loop:**\n   - The script initializes the previous state by capturing the initial state of the directory.\n   - It then enters an infinite loop where it captures the current state every minute.\n   - Compares the current state with the previous state to detect new, modified, or deleted files.\n   - Logs the detected changes and updates the previous state for the next iteration.\n\n3. **Error Handling:**\n   - Checks for the correct number of arguments.\n   - Handles errors in writing to the log file and suppresses `find` permission errors.\n\nThis script provides a robust way to monitor directory changes and log them efficiently."
