        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a simple text-based calculator in C++. It needs to handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and it should take inputs in the format \"operand1 operator operand2\". Also, I need to make sure it handles errors nicely, like when someone tries to divide by zero or enters something that doesn't make sense.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to structure the program. Since it's text-based, it'll be running in the console, so I'll be using standard input and output streams: cin and cout.\n\nI should start by including the necessary headers. For basic input and output, I'll need <iostream>. Maybe I'll also need <string> to handle user input as strings and then parse them.\n\nSo, at the top:\n\n#include <iostream>\n\n#include <string>\n\nUsing namespace std; might save some typing.\n\nNext, I need to design how the program will interact with the user. Probably, it should keep running until the user decides to exit, so a loop would be appropriate. Maybe a while loop that runs until the user inputs a specific command to quit.\n\nInside the loop, I'll prompt the user to enter an expression, like \"5 + 3\", and then read that input.\n\nReading the input as a string seems straightforward. I can use cin to read the entire line.\n\nOnce I have the input as a string, I need to parse it into operand1, operator, and operand2. I can split the string by spaces to get these three parts.\n\nTo split the string, I can use stringstream or other methods. Maybe I'll use stringstream because it's convenient for parsing.\n\nSo, include <sstream> as well.\n\nAfter splitting the string, I need to convert operand1 and operand2 from strings to numeric types, like doubles, to perform calculations.\n\nI should also check if the operator is one of the supported ones: +, -, *, /.\n\nThen, based on the operator, perform the corresponding operation and output the result.\n\nBut I need to handle errors. For example, if the user enters something like \"5 +\", or \"a + b\", or \"5 / 0\", I need to catch those errors and inform the user nicely without crashing the program.\n\nSo, error handling is crucial here.\n\nLet me think about potential error scenarios:\n\n1. Incorrect number of operands or operators. For example, too many or too few inputs.\n\n2. Invalid operands. If the user enters non-numeric values for operands.\n\n3. Invalid operator. If the operator is not one of the supported ones.\n\n4. Division by zero.\n\nI need to handle each of these cases gracefully.\n\nMaybe I can write a function to parse the input and perform the calculation, and handle exceptions or error codes accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, I can use try-catch blocks for error handling, but since C++ doesn't have built-in exception handling for invalid conversions, I might need to check manually.\n\nFor converting strings to numbers, I can use stoi or stod functions, but they can throw exceptions if the conversion fails. So, I'll need to handle those exceptions.\n\nWait, but the task says to implement error handling for invalid inputs and divide-by-zero errors. So, I need to make sure that the program doesn't crash and instead informs the user about what went wrong.\n\nAlright, let's sketch out the steps:\n\n1. Display a welcome message and instructions to the user.\n\n2. Start a loop that continues until the user decides to exit.\n\n3. Inside the loop:\n\na. Prompt the user to enter an expression.\n\nb. Read the input as a string.\n\nc. Parse the string to extract operand1, operator, and operand2.\n\nd. Convert operand1 and operand2 to numeric types.\n\ne. Check if the operator is valid.\n\nf. Perform the calculation based on the operator.\n\ng. Handle special cases like division by zero.\n\nh. Display the result or an error message.\n\n4. Provide an option for the user to exit the program.\n\nI should also think about how the user can exit the program. Maybe allow them to type \"exit\" or \"quit\" instead of an expression.\n\nNow, let's think about the data types. Since we're dealing with numbers, it's best to use floating-point types like double to handle decimal numbers as well.\n\nSo, operand1 and operand2 should be doubles.\n\nBut when reading from input, they might be integers or floats, so I need to handle both.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that the user might enter negative numbers.\n\nAlright, let's consider writing a function to parse the input string and perform the calculation.\n\nSomething like:\n\ndouble calculate(string expression) {\n\n// parsing and calculation logic\n\n}\n\nBut I need to handle errors, so maybe the function should return a boolean indicating success or failure, and output the result by reference.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use exceptions for error handling.\n\nIn C++, I can throw exceptions when errors occur, and catch them to display error messages.\n\nI'll need to decide what kinds of exceptions to throw.\n\nMaybe define custom exception classes for different error types.\n\nBut perhaps that's overkill for a simple calculator.\n\nAlternatively, I can use error codes or optional types, but exceptions might be simpler.\n\nGiven time constraints, I'll go with exceptions.\n\nSo, in the calculate function, if there's an error in parsing or calculation, I'll throw an exception with an appropriate error message.\n\nThen, in the main loop, I'll catch these exceptions and display the error message to the user.\n\nThis way, the program doesn't crash and can continue to prompt the user for input.\n\nNow, let's think about how to split the input string into operands and operator.\n\nUsing stringstream, I can extract words separated by spaces.\n\nFor example:\n\nstringstream ss(expression);\n\nstring operand1Str, operatorStr, operand2Str;\n\nss >> operand1Str >> operatorStr >> operand2Str;\n\nThen, I can check if exactly three elements were provided.\n\nIf not, it's an invalid input.\n\nNext, try to convert operand1Str and operand2Str to doubles.\n\nIf conversion fails, it's an invalid operand.\n\nThen, check if the operator is one of the supported ones.\n\nIf not, invalid operator.\n\nIf everything is okay, perform the calculation.\n\nFor division, check if operand2 is zero.\n\nIf so, throw an exception for divide-by-zero.\n\nOtherwise, proceed with the calculation and return the result.\n\nIn the main loop, catch any exceptions thrown by the calculate function and display the error message.\n\nAlso, provide an option for the user to exit by typing \"exit\" or \"quit\".\n\nSo, before parsing the input, check if the input is \"exit\" or \"quit\", and if so, break out of the loop to end the program.\n\nAlright, I think this covers the basic requirements.\n\nNow, I need to write the actual code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple text-based calculator in C++ that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, follow the steps below. This program will take user input in the format \"operand1 operator operand2\" and display the result. It also includes error handling for invalid inputs and divide-by-zero errors.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Include necessary headers**: Use `<iostream>`, `<string>`, and `<sstream>` for input, output, and string manipulation.\n2. **Loop until user decides to exit**: Use a `while` loop that continues until the user types \"exit\" or \"quit\".\n3. **Read user input**: Read the entire line of input using `std::getline`.\n4. **Handle exit condition**: If the input is \"exit\" or \"quit\", stop the program.\n5. **Parse the input**: Split the input string into three parts: operand1, operator, and operand2 using `std::stringstream`.\n6. **Convert operands to doubles**: Use `std::stod` to convert string operands to doubles, handling exceptions for invalid conversions.\n7. **Check and perform the operation**: Based on the operator, perform the corresponding arithmetic operation and handle divide-by-zero errors.\n8. **Display the result or error message**: Output the result of the operation or an appropriate error message.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <sstream>\n#include <stdexcept>\n\nint main() {\n    std::cout << \"Simple Calculator\\n\";\n    std::cout << \"Enter expressions like '5 + 3' or type 'exit' to quit.\\n\";\n\n    while (true) {\n        std::string input;\n        std::cout << \"> \";\n        std::getline(std::cin, input);\n\n        // Check for exit condition\n        if (input == \"exit\" || input == \"quit\") {\n            std::cout << \"Goodbye!\\n\";\n            break;\n        }\n\n        // Parse the input\n        std::stringstream ss(input);\n        std::string operand1Str, operatorStr, operand2Str;\n        ss >> operand1Str >> operatorStr >> operand2Str;\n\n        // Check if exactly three elements are provided\n        if (ss.fail() || !ss.eof()) {\n            std::cout << \"Error: Invalid input format.\\n\";\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        try {\n            // Convert operands to doubles\n            double operand1 = std::stod(operand1Str);\n            double operand2 = std::stod(operand2Str);\n\n            // Perform the calculation based on the operator\n            if (operatorStr == \"+\") {\n                std::cout << operand1 + operand2 << \"\\n\";\n            } else if (operatorStr == \"-\") {\n                std::cout << operand1 - operand2 << \"\\n\";\n            } else if (operatorStr == \"*\") {\n                std::cout << operand1 * operand2 << \"\\n\";\n            } else if (operatorStr == \"/\") {\n                if (operand2 == 0) {\n                    throw std::runtime_error(\"Error: Division by zero.\");\n                }\n                std::cout << operand1 / operand2 << \"\\n\";\n            } else {\n                std::cout << \"Error: Unsupported operator.\\n\";\n            }\n        } catch (const std::invalid_argument&) {\n            std::cout << \"Error: Invalid operand.\\n\";\n        } catch (const std::runtime_error& e) {\n            std::cout << e.what() << \"\\n\";\n        }\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Input Handling**: The program reads input lines until the user types \"exit\" or \"quit\".\n- **Parsing**: Uses `std::stringstream` to split the input into operands and operator.\n- **Conversion and Calculation**: Converts string operands to doubles and performs the operation based on the operator.\n- **Error Handling**: Catches exceptions for invalid conversions and divide-by-zero errors, providing user-friendly error messages.\n\nThis approach ensures the program is robust and user-friendly, handling various error scenarios gracefully."
