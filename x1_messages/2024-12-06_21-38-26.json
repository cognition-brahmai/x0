Here it is:\n\nWhy don't skeletons fight in the snow?\n\nBecause they have no guts!\n\nBut I think you might be looking for something more specific to animals with health issues. Let's try another one:\n\nWhy did the chicken go to the doctor?\n\nBecause it was feeling a little under the weather!\n\nHmm, maybe not directly about ailments. How about this one?\n\nWhy did the sheep get kicked out of the movie theater?\n\nBecause it was constantly baaaah-ing during the film, and the theater had a \"no bleating\" policy!\n\nWait, that might not be what you're looking for either. Let me think of a joke that specifically involves an animal with a health problem.\n\nOkay, here's one:\n\nWhy did the cat go to the doctor?\n\nBecause it had a case of the meow-nas!\n\nI hope that brings a smile to your face!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Why did the cat go to the doctor?
