        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company that sells two products, X and Y. Each unit of X brings in $10 profit, and each unit of Y brings in $15 profit. The company wants to make at least $100,000 in profit per month.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. They're telling me that they sell 4,000 units of product X every month, and I need to find out how many units of product Y they need to sell to meet their profit goal of $100,000.\n\nAlright, let's start by calculating the total profit from product X. Since each unit of X makes $10 profit, and they sell 4,000 units, the total profit from X is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit from X} = 4,000 \\text{ units} \\times \\$10/\\text{unit} = \\$40,000 \\]\n\nSo, from product X alone, they make $40,000 per month. But their goal is $100,000. That means they need an additional:\n\n\\[ \\text{Additional profit needed} = \\$100,000 - \\$40,000 = \\$60,000 \\]\n\nThis additional $60,000 needs to come from selling product Y, which makes $15 profit per unit. So, to find out how many units of Y they need to sell to make $60,000, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Units of Y} \\times \\$15/\\text{unit} = \\$60,000 \\]\n\nNow, I can solve for the number of units of Y:\n\n\\[ \\text{Units of Y} = \\frac{\\$60,000}{\\$15/\\text{unit}} = 4,000 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, profit from X: 4,000 units times $10 per unit is indeed $40,000.\n\nThen, subtracting that from the goal of $100,000 gives $60,000 needed from product Y.\n\nEach unit of Y brings in $15, so dividing $60,000 by $15 per unit should give the number of units needed.\n\nLet me do the division again: $60,000 divided by $15 is $60,000 / 15 = 4,000 units.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any other factors involved. For example, are there any costs associated with selling product Y that aren't mentioned? Or are there any constraints on how many units of Y they can sell?\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any additional costs or constraints, so I think assuming that each unit of Y contributes $15 directly to profit is acceptable.\n\nAlso, the company wants to generate \"at least\" $100,000 in profit. So, selling exactly 4,000 units of Y would give them exactly $60,000 from Y, plus $40,000 from X, totaling $100,000. If they want at least that much, selling more than 4,000 units would give them more profit, but the question is asking for the number needed to meet the goal, so 4,000 units is the minimum.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there's a way to express this using inequalities. Let's try that.\n\nLet \\( y \\) be the number of units of product Y sold.\n\nThen, the total profit \\( p \\) is:\n\n\\[ p = 10 \\times 4,000 + 15 \\times y \\]\n\n\\[ p = 40,000 + 15y \\]\n\nThe company wants \\( p \\geq 100,000 \\), so:\n\n\\[ 40,000 + 15y \\geq 100,000 \\]\n\nSubtract 40,000 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 15y \\geq 60,000 \\]\n\nThen, divide both sides by 15:\n\n\\[ y \\geq 4,000 \\]\n\nSo, indeed, they need to sell at least 4,000 units of product Y to meet their profit goal.\n\nMaybe I can also look at the contribution of each product to the total profit. Product X contributes 40% of the total goal, since $40,000 is 40% of $100,000, and product Y needs to cover the remaining 60%.\n\nWait, is that accurate? Let's check:\n\n\\[ \\frac{40,000}{100,000} = 0.4 = 40\\% \\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, product Y needs to contribute the remaining 60%, which is $60,000, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find out how many units of Y are needed to make $60,000, given that each unit brings $15.\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{60,000}{15} = 4,000 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nSame result.\n\nPerhaps I can also consider the profit per unit for both products together.\n\nTotal profit is:\n\n\\[ p = 10x + 15y \\]\n\nGiven that \\( x = 4,000 \\), and \\( p \\geq 100,000 \\), we have:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 4,000 + 15y \\geq 100,000 \\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 40,000 + 15y \\geq 100,000 \\]\n\nThen, solving for y:\n\n\\[ 15y \\geq 60,000 \\]\n\n\\[ y \\geq 4,000 \\]\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough through different methods. It seems consistent that they need to sell at least 4,000 units of product Y to meet their profit goal of $100,000 per month, given that they already sell 4,000 units of product X.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any constraints or other factors that could affect this calculation. For example, perhaps there are fixed costs or variable costs not accounted for in the profit per unit. But based on the information provided, it seems that each unit's profit is given directly, so no need to consider additional costs.\n\nAlso, the problem states that the company \"aims to generate at least $100,000 in profit per month.\" So, meeting or exceeding this target is acceptable. Therefore, selling exactly 4,000 units of Y would meet the target, and selling more would exceed it.\n\nPerhaps I can also calculate what the total profit would be if they sell 4,000 units of Y, just to confirm:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total profit} = (4,000 \\times 10) + (4,000 \\times 15) = 40,000 + 60,000 = 100,000 \\]\n\nYes, that matches the goal.\n\nWhat if they sell fewer than 4,000 units of Y? Let's say they sell 3,000 units of Y:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total profit} = 40,000 + (3,000 \\times 15) = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \\]\n\nWhich is below the target of $100,000.\n\nOr if they sell 5,000 units of Y:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total profit} = 40,000 + (5,000 \\times 15) = 40,000 + 75,000 = 115,000 \\]\n\nWhich exceeds the target.\n\nTherefore, 4,000 units of Y is the break-even point to meet the $100,000 profit goal.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The answer seems straightforward, and I've verified it through multiple methods. The company needs to sell at least 4,000 units of product Y each month to meet their profit target of $100,000, in addition to the 4,000 units of product X they already sell.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4000} \\]"
