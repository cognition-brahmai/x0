        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a small town with 100 houses, and each house has either a red or a blue door. We need to figure out how many red and blue doors there are based on some clues.\n\nThe first clue is: \"If you count the number of red doors in pairs, you get one extra red door left over.\" That sounds like when you try to pair up the red doors, there's always one that doesn't have a pair. In mathematical terms, this means that the number of red doors is an odd number. Because even numbers can be paired up completely without any left over, but odd numbers have one left over.\n\nSo, if R is the number of red doors, then R is odd.\n\nThe second clue is: \"If you count the number of blue doors in groups of three, you get two extra blue doors left over.\" This means that when you try to group the blue doors in threes, there are two left over. So, the number of blue doors, B, when divided by 3, leaves a remainder of 2.\n\nIn mathematical terms, B \u2261 2 mod 3.\n\nAlso, since there are 100 houses in total, R + B = 100.\n\nSo, we have three pieces of information:\n\n1. R is odd.\n\n2. B \u2261 2 mod 3.\n\n3. R + B = 100.\n\nWe need to find values of R and B that satisfy all three conditions.\n\nLet's see. Since R is odd, and R + B = 100, that means B must be odd as well because odd + odd = even, and 100 is even.\n\nWait, is that right? Let's double-check.\n\nActually, odd + odd = even, and even + even = even. So, if R is odd, B must be odd too because 100 is even.\n\nBut, hold on, 100 is even, and R + B = 100.\n\nIf R is odd, then B must be odd because odd + odd = even.\n\nSimilarly, if R were even, B would have to be even because even + even = even.\n\nBut, from the first clue, R is odd, so B is also odd.\n\nSo, B is odd and B \u2261 2 mod 3.\n\nWe need to find an odd number B such that B \u2261 2 mod 3, and B is between 0 and 100 (since there are 100 houses).\n\nLet's list some numbers that satisfy B \u2261 2 mod 3.\n\nNumbers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3 are:\n\n2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50, 53, 56, 59, 62, 65, 68, 71, 74, 77, 80, 83, 86, 89, 92, 95, 98.\n\nNow, we need to pick the odd numbers from this list because B is odd.\n\nSo, from the list above, the odd numbers are:\n\n5, 11, 17, 23, 29, 35, 41, 47, 53, 59, 65, 71, 77, 83, 89, 95.\n\nSo, possible values for B are 5, 11, 17, 23, 29, 35, 41, 47, 53, 59, 65, 71, 77, 83, 89, 95.\n\nNow, since R + B = 100 and R is odd, and we've already established that B is odd, we can check these values to see which one fits.\n\nBut actually, since R = 100 - B, and R is odd, and 100 is even, then B must be odd, which it is in all the values we have.\n\nSo, all these B values are possible, but we need to see if there's only one solution or multiple.\n\nWait, perhaps there's only one solution that fits both conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are multiple solutions, but perhaps the problem expects only one answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a unique solution.\n\nLet me check.\n\nLet's pick B = 5.\n\nThen R = 100 - 5 = 95.\n\nIs 95 odd? Yes.\n\nDoes B \u2261 2 mod 3?\n\nB = 5, 5 divided by 3 is 1 with remainder 2. Yes.\n\nSo, B = 5 is a possible solution.\n\nSimilarly, B = 11.\n\nR = 100 - 11 = 89.\n\n89 is odd.\n\nB = 11 \u2261 2 mod 3? 11 divided by 3 is 3*3=9, remainder 2. Yes.\n\nSo, B = 11 is also a possible solution.\n\nHmm, it seems like there are multiple solutions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nMaybe there's an additional constraint.\n\nLet me read the problem again.\n\n\"In a small town, there are 100 houses. Every house has either a red or blue door. If you count the number of red doors in pairs, you get one extra red door left over. If you count the number of blue doors in groups of three, you get two extra blue doors left over.\"\n\nSo, R is odd, B \u2261 2 mod 3, and R + B = 100.\n\nSeems like that's all the information given.\n\nAnd from that, we have multiple possible solutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a unique solution that fits both conditions.\n\nWait, perhaps there's only one pair (R, B) that satisfies both conditions.\n\nLet me see.\n\nFrom B \u2261 2 mod 3, and B is odd, and B + R = 100, with R odd.\n\nWe can list all possible B values that are odd and \u2261 2 mod 3.\n\nWe have B = 5, 11, 17, 23, 29, 35, 41, 47, 53, 59, 65, 71, 77, 83, 89, 95.\n\nNow, for each of these B values, R = 100 - B is odd.\n\nSo, all these are possible solutions.\n\nUnless there's additional information to choose one specific solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to express the solution in terms of a parameter.\n\nFor example, B = 3k + 2, for some integer k, and B is odd.\n\nBut, since B is odd, and B = 3k + 2, then 3k + 2 must be odd.\n\nSo, 3k must be odd - 2, which is odd minus even, which is odd.\n\nTherefore, 3k is odd, which implies k is odd.\n\nSo, k must be odd.\n\nTherefore, k = 2m + 1, for some integer m.\n\nThen, B = 3(2m + 1) + 2 = 6m + 3 + 2 = 6m + 5.\n\nSo, B = 6m + 5, for integer m \u2265 0.\n\nNow, B must be between 0 and 100.\n\nSo, 0 \u2264 6m + 5 \u2264 100.\n\nSubtract 5: -5 \u2264 6m \u2264 95.\n\nDivide by 6: -5/6 \u2264 m \u2264 95/6.\n\nWhich is approximately -0.833 \u2264 m \u2264 15.833.\n\nSince m is an integer, m can be from 0 to 15.\n\nSo, m = 0 to 15.\n\nThen, B = 6m + 5, for m = 0 to 15.\n\nSo, B = 5, 11, 17, ..., up to m=15, B=6*15 + 5=90 + 5=95.\n\nSo, B can be 5, 11, 17, ..., 95.\n\nCorrespondingly, R = 100 - B.\n\nSo, R = 95, 89, 83, ..., 5.\n\nAll these are valid solutions based on the given conditions.\n\nUnless there's more information to pick a specific solution, all these are possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to find the number of possible solutions.\n\nBut the problem seems to be asking for \"how many red and blue doors there are,\" suggesting perhaps a unique solution, but there are multiple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the problem.\n\nLet me re-read the problem.\n\n\"In a small town, there are 100 houses. Every house has either a red or blue door. If you count the number of red doors in pairs, you get one extra red door left over. If you count the number of blue doors in groups of three, you get two extra blue doors left over.\"\n\nSo, the first condition is about pairing red doors and having one left over, meaning R is odd.\n\nThe second condition is about grouping blue doors in threes and having two left over, meaning B \u2261 2 mod 3.\n\nAnd R + B = 100.\n\nGiven that, we have multiple solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the exact number of red and blue doors, implying there is only one solution.\n\nBut based on the conditions, there are multiple solutions.\n\nUnless there's a constraint on the minimum or maximum number of red or blue doors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the possible number of red and blue doors.\n\nGiven that, we can list all possible pairs (R, B) where B = 6m + 5 for m = 0 to 15, and R = 100 - B.\n\nSo, possible solutions are:\n\nm | B | R\n\n---|---|---\n\n0 | 5 | 95\n\n1 | 11 | 89\n\n2 | 17 | 83\n\n3 | 23 | 77\n\n4 | 29 | 71\n\n5 | 35 | 65\n\n6 | 41 | 59\n\n7 | 47 | 53\n\n8 | 53 | 47\n\n9 | 59 | 41\n\n10 | 65 | 35\n\n11 | 71 | 29\n\n12 | 77 | 23\n\n13 | 83 | 17\n\n14 | 89 | 11\n\n15 | 95 | 5\n\nSo, there are 16 possible solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to find one specific solution, but without additional constraints, we can't determine which one is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a unique solution based on additional implicit constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the number of red and blue doors where R and B satisfy the given conditions, and since there are multiple solutions, we need to express the general solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the number of doors must be non-negative, which we already have, as B ranges from 5 to 95 in steps of 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to determine a unique solution based on additional constraints not yet considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the number of red and blue doors where R and B satisfy the given conditions, and since there are multiple solutions, the answer is that there are multiple possible solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to find the smallest or largest possible number of red or blue doors.\n\nFor example, the smallest number of blue doors is 5, and the largest is 95.\n\nSimilarly, the smallest number of red doors is 5, and the largest is 95.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the number of red and blue doors, and since there are multiple solutions, we need to express the solution in terms of a parameter.\n\nFor example, B = 6m + 5, for m = 0 to 15, and R = 95 - 6m, for m = 0 to 15.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a unique solution based on additional constraints that I haven't considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is misinterpreted, and there's a different way to approach it.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me try to set up equations based on the given conditions.\n\nLet R be the number of red doors, and B be the number of blue doors.\n\nWe have:\n\nR + B = 100.\n\nFrom the first condition: \"If you count the number of red doors in pairs, you get one extra red door left over.\"\n\nThis means that when R is divided by 2, there's a remainder of 1.\n\nIn other words, R \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nWhich means R is odd.\n\nFrom the second condition: \"If you count the number of blue doors in groups of three, you get two extra blue doors left over.\"\n\nThis means that when B is divided by 3, there's a remainder of 2.\n\nIn other words, B \u2261 2 mod 3.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nR \u2261 1 mod 2\n\nB \u2261 2 mod 3\n\nAnd R + B = 100.\n\nWe can solve this system of congruences.\n\nFirst, since R \u2261 1 mod 2, R is odd.\n\nAnd B \u2261 2 mod 3.\n\nAlso, R + B = 100.\n\nLet's express R in terms of B: R = 100 - B.\n\nSince R is odd, 100 - B is odd.\n\nSince 100 is even, -B must be odd, which means B is odd.\n\nSo, B is odd and B \u2261 2 mod 3.\n\nWe need to find B that is odd and B \u2261 2 mod 3.\n\nWe can write B as B = 6k + 2 or B = 6k + 5, since B is odd and \u2261 2 mod 3.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nNumbers \u2261 2 mod 3 are: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, ...\n\nAmong these, the odd ones are: 5, 11, 17, 23, ..., which are of the form B = 6k + 5, where k is an integer \u2265 0.\n\nSo, B = 6k + 5.\n\nThen, R = 100 - B = 100 - (6k + 5) = 95 - 6k.\n\nNow, since B \u2265 0 and B \u2264 100, we have:\n\n0 \u2264 6k + 5 \u2264 100\n\nSubtract 5: -5 \u2264 6k \u2264 95\n\nDivide by 6: -5/6 \u2264 k \u2264 95/6\n\nWhich is approximately -0.833 \u2264 k \u2264 15.833.\n\nSince k is an integer \u2265 0, k can be from 0 to 15.\n\nSo, k = 0 to 15.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nB = 6k + 5\n\nR = 95 - 6k\n\nFor k = 0 to 15.\n\nThus, there are 16 possible solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to find a specific solution based on additional constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the number of red and blue doors, and since there are multiple solutions, we need to express the solution in terms of k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a unique solution based on additional constraints that I haven't considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the number of red and blue doors where R and B satisfy the given conditions, and since there are multiple solutions, the answer is that there are multiple possible solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find one possible solution, not necessarily the only one.\n\nIn that case, we can pick any k from 0 to 15.\n\nFor example, let's pick k=0:\n\nB = 6*0 + 5 = 5\n\nR = 95 - 6*0 = 95\n\nSo, one possible solution is 95 red doors and 5 blue doors.\n\nAlternatively, pick k=1:\n\nB = 6*1 + 5 = 11\n\nR = 95 - 6*1 = 89\n\nSo, another possible solution is 89 red doors and 11 blue doors.\n\nAnd so on, up to k=15:\n\nB = 6*15 + 5 = 95\n\nR = 95 - 6*15 = 95 - 90 = 5\n\nSo, another possible solution is 5 red doors and 95 blue doors.\n\nTherefore, there are multiple possible solutions, ranging from 5 blue doors and 95 red doors to 95 blue doors and 5 red doors, in steps of 6 for B and steps of -6 for R.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to find the number of possible solutions.\n\nIn that case, since k ranges from 0 to 15, there are 16 possible solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the number of red and blue doors, and since there are multiple solutions, we need to express the solution in terms of k, as above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a unique solution based on additional constraints not yet considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the number of red and blue doors must be positive.\n\nBut in the solutions above, B starts at 5 and goes up to 95 in steps of 6, and R correspondingly from 95 to 5 in steps of -6.\n\nSo, both R and B are positive in all these cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the number of red and blue doors where R and B satisfy the given conditions, and since there are multiple solutions, the answer is that there are multiple possible solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to find one specific solution, and the rest are implied.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the simplest solution is when k=0,\u5373 B=5 and R=95.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a standard way to solve such problems, and the answer should be expressed in terms of the general solution.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given conditions, there are multiple possible solutions for the number of red and blue doors, specifically 16 possible pairs (R, B), where B = 6k + 5 and R = 95 - 6k for k = 0 to 15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{There are multiple possible solutions: } B = 6k + 5 \\text{ and } R = 95 - 6k \\text{ for integer } k \\text{ from } 0 \\text{ to } 15.}"
