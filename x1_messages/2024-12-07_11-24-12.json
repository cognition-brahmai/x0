        "content": "Let's see here. So, we have a train that travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, and it takes 4 hours to go between two cities. Now, if the train were to travel 20% faster, how long would it take to cover the same distance?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what 20% faster means. If the train is going 60 miles per hour and it's going 20% faster, that means its new speed is 60 plus 20% of 60.\n\nSo, 20% of 60 is calculated as 0.20 times 60, which is 12 miles per hour. Therefore, the new speed is 60 + 12 = 72 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the distance between the two cities remains the same. Since speed is distance over time, and we know the original speed and time, we can find the distance.\n\nOriginal speed = 60 mph\n\nOriginal time = 4 hours\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time = 60 \u00d7 4 = 240 miles\n\nNow, with the new speed of 72 mph, we need to find the new time to cover 240 miles.\n\nUsing the formula: time = distance / speed\n\nSo, new time = 240 miles / 72 mph\n\nLet me calculate that: 240 divided by 72.\n\nWell, 72 times 3 is 216, which is less than 240. 72 times 3.333... would be 240.\n\nSo, 72 \u00d7 3.333... = 240\n\nTherefore, the new time is approximately 3.333 hours.\n\nTo express that in hours and minutes, 0.333 hours is roughly 20 minutes, since 0.333 \u00d7 60 minutes = 20 minutes.\n\nSo, the train would take about 3 hours and 20 minutes to travel between the same two cities at the faster speed.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nOriginal distance is indeed 240 miles.\n\nNew speed is 72 mph.\n\nTime = distance / speed = 240 / 72\n\nLet me do the division again: 240 divided by 72.\n\n72 times 3 is 216\n\n240 minus 216 is 24\n\nSo, 72 goes into 240 three times with a remainder of 24.\n\nTo find the decimal, 24 divided by 72 is 0.333...\n\nSo, total time is 3.333... hours, which is 3 hours and roughly 20 minutes.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the relationship between speed and time. If the speed increases by 20%, the time should decrease by a certain amount.\n\nSince speed and time are inversely proportional (when one increases, the other decreases), the ratio of the new time to the original time should be the inverse of the ratio of the new speed to the original speed.\n\nSo, original speed / new speed = original time / new time\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n60 / 72 = 4 / new time\n\nSimplify 60 / 72 to 5 / 6\n\nSo, 5 / 6 = 4 / new time\n\nCross-multiplying: 5 \u00d7 new time = 6 \u00d7 4\n\n5 \u00d7 new time = 24\n\nTherefore, new time = 24 / 5 = 4.8 hours\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I calculated it as 3.333 hours, but now it's coming out to be 4.8 hours.\n\nThat doesn't make sense. There must be a mistake in this approach.\n\nLet me check the formula again. Speed and time are inversely proportional, so original speed / new speed should equal new time / original time.\n\nWait, no. Wait, hold on.\n\nActually, the correct relationship is:\n\n(original speed) / (new speed) = (new time) / (original time)\n\nBecause if speed increases, time decreases proportionally.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n60 / 72 = new time / 4\n\nSimplify 60 / 72 to 5 / 6\n\nSo, 5 / 6 = new time / 4\n\nNow, solving for new time: new time = (5 / 6) \u00d7 4 = 20 / 6 \u2248 3.333 hours\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the second method also confirms that the new time is approximately 3.333 hours, or 3 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the train would take about 3 hours and 20 minutes to travel between the same two cities if it traveled 20% faster.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ hours and } 20 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
