I think the scientific term for them is auroras. So, if I'm correct, you're asking about auroras, which are visible near the Earth's polar regions and are caused by charged particles colliding with the atmosphere.\n\nLet me see if I can recall more about this phenomenon. I remember that the Earth has a magnetic field, and it's because of this magnetic field that these charged particles, mostly coming from the sun in the form of solar wind, get directed towards the polar regions. When these charged particles enter the Earth's atmosphere, they interact with gases like oxygen and nitrogen, causing them to emit light. That's what creates those fantastic light shows in the sky.\n\nI think there are different types of auroras depending on the gas involved in the collision. For example, oxygen can produce green or sometimes red colors, while nitrogen might produce blue or purple shades. Combining these, you get these mesmerizing displays of multiple colors dancing in the sky.\n\nI've heard that the aurora in the Northern Hemisphere is called the Aurora Borealis, and in the Southern Hemisphere, it's called the Aurora Australis. Both are essentially the same phenomenon but occur in different parts of the Earth.\n\nIt's fascinating how something as simple as charged particles interacting with atmospheric gases can create such a spectacular natural event. I've always wanted to see it in person. I've heard that to see the auroras, you need to be in places closer to the poles, like Alaska, Canada, Scandinavia, or Antarctica for the southern lights.\n\nI also recall that the intensity of auroras can vary depending on solar activity. There are periods when the sun emits more charged particles, which can lead to more vivid and frequent auroras. These periods are related to the solar cycle, which repeats approximately every 11 years.\n\nMoreover, auroras aren't unique to Earth. I think other planets with magnetic fields, like Jupiter and Saturn, also have their versions of auroras. In fact, space probes have captured images of auroras on these planets, and they seem even more spectacular because of the different atmospheric compositions.\n\nIt's amazing how much we've learned about auroras through scientific research and space exploration. I remember learning about them in school, but there's always more to discover and understand about these natural phenomena.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the natural phenomenon you're referring to is indeed the aurora, specifically the Aurora Borealis in the north and the Aurora Australis in the south. It's caused by charged particles from the sun interacting with the Earth's atmosphere near the poles, resulting in beautiful light displays.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Aurora}} \\]"
