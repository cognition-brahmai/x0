It is useful for finding lists of sites that may contain answers to the user's questions.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts text from websites provided as newline-separated links in the input string. The output is plain text containing the content of the linked pages.\nLinkParser[input]: Parses plain text and produces a list of links separated by newlines.\nAIQA[input]: An AI-based question answering model capable of providing answers based on an input passage of text.

        "content": "Alright, I need to figure out the significance of Leonardo da Vinci's painting 'The Last Supper'. I have these tools to help me: Bing to search for information, TextExtractor to get text from websites, LinkParser to find links in text, and AIQA to answer questions based on provided text. I need to plan this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably search for information about 'The Last Supper' by Leonardo da Vinci. I can use Bing for that. So, I'll set evidence0 to be the result of Bing['The Last Supper Leonardo da Vinci'].\n\nPlan: Search for information about 'The Last Supper' painted by Leonardo da Vinci.\n:evidence0: = Bing['The Last Supper Leonardo da Vinci']\n\nNow, evidence0 will likely be a list of websites that talk about the painting. I need to extract text from these websites to read about its significance. I can use TextExtractor for that. But first, I need to parse the search results to get the actual links. So, I'll use LinkParser on evidence0 to get the links.\n\nPlan: Parse the search results to extract links to articles about the painting.\n:evidence1: = LinkParser[:evidence0:]\n\nOnce I have the links, I can pass them to TextExtractor to get the text content from those pages.\n\nPlan: Extract text from the websites obtained from the search results.\n:evidence2: = TextExtractor[:evidence1:]\n\nNow, evidence2 will be a bunch of text from different websites. I need to make sense of this text and find out what makes 'The Last Supper' significant. I can use AIQA to answer my question based on this text.\n\nPlan: Use the extracted text to answer the question about the significance of 'The Last Supper'.\n:evidence3: = AIQA['What is the significance of Leonardo da Vinci\\'s painting \"The Last Supper\"? Given context: :evidence2:']\n\nFinally, evidence3 should contain the answer I'm looking for. So, I'll set the answer to be evidence3.\n\nAnswer: :evidence3:\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can make this more efficient. Instead of parsing links and extracting text, maybe I can find a specific website that's known for art information, like the official Leonardo da Vinci museum site or a reputable art history website, and extract information directly from there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for summaries or overviews of the painting's significance. Maybe there's a Wikipedia page or an article that directly answers my question.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I can search for '\"The Last Supper\" significance Leonardo da Vinci' to get results that specifically talk about its significance.\n\nPlan: Search for information specifically about the significance of 'The Last Supper'.\n:evidence0: = Bing['\"The Last Supper\" significance Leonardo da Vinci']\n\nThen, parse the links from these search results.\n\nPlan: Parse the search results to extract relevant links.\n:evidence1: = LinkParser[:evidence0:]\n\nExtract text from these links.\n\nPlan: Extract text from the relevant websites.\n:evidence2: = TextExtractor[:evidence1:]\n\nAnd then ask AIQA to summarize the significance based on this text.\n\nPlan: Summarize the significance of 'The Last Supper' based on the extracted text.\n:evidence3: = AIQA['What is the significance of Leonardo da Vinci\\'s \"The Last Supper\"? Given context: :evidence2:']\n\nThis seems like a solid plan. By specifying \"significance\" in the search query, I'm more likely to get results that directly address what makes the painting important or notable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can ask AIQA to search and summarize in one step, but I think breaking it down into these steps is better for accuracy.\n\nAnother thought: maybe there are scholarly articles or reviews that discuss the painting's impact on art history, its innovative techniques, or its cultural influence. I should make sure to look for information that covers these aspects.\n\nPerhaps I can refine my search query to include terms like \"art history,\" \"innovations,\" \"techniques,\" or \"cultural impact.\"\n\nPlan: Search for information about the significance of 'The Last Supper' in art history and its innovations.\n:evidence0: = Bing['\"The Last Supper\" Leonardo da Vinci art history innovations']\n\nParse the links from these search results.\n\nPlan: Parse the search results to extract relevant links.\n:evidence1: = LinkParser[:evidence0:]\n\nExtract text from these links.\n\nPlan: Extract text from the relevant websites.\n:evidence2: = TextExtractor[:evidence1:]\n\nAsk AIQA to summarize the significance based on this text, focusing on art historical context and innovations.\n\nPlan: Summarize the art historical significance and innovations in 'The Last Supper'.\n:evidence3: = AIQA['What is the significance of Leonardo da Vinci\\'s \"The Last Supper\" in art history, particularly in terms of its innovations? Given context: :evidence2:']\n\nThis might give me a more focused answer on why the painting is important from an art historical perspective.\n\nBut maybe I should also consider its religious significance, as it depicts a key Christian moment. Perhaps I should broaden the search a bit.\n\nPlan: Search for information about the religious and artistic significance of 'The Last Supper'.\n:evidence0: = Bing['\"The Last Supper\" Leonardo da Vinci religious and artistic significance']\n\nParse the links.\n\nPlan: Parse the search results to extract relevant links.\n:evidence1: = LinkParser[:evidence0:]\n\nExtract text.\n\nPlan: Extract text from the relevant websites.\n:evidence2: = TextExtractor[:evidence1:]\n\nAsk AIQA to summarize both religious and artistic significance.\n\nPlan: Summarize both the religious and artistic significance of 'The Last Supper'.\n:evidence3: = AIQA['What is the religious and artistic significance of Leonardo da Vinci\\'s \"The Last Supper\"? Given context: :evidence2:']\n\nThis seems comprehensive. Now, I need to execute this plan.\n\nFirst, perform the search:\n\n:evidence0: = Bing['\"The Last Supper\" Leonardo da Vinci religious and artistic significance']\n\nNext, parse the links:\n\n:evidence1: = LinkParser[:evidence0:]\n\nThen, extract text from those links:\n\n:evidence2: = TextExtractor[:evidence1:]\n\nFinally, summarize using AIQA:\n\n:evidence3: = AIQA['What is the religious and artistic significance of Leonardo da Vinci\\'s \"The Last Supper\"? Given context: :evidence2:']\n\nI think this plan will yield a detailed and accurate answer to the user's question.\n\n**Final Plan:**\n\n1. **Search for information:**\n   - :evidence0: = Bing['\"The Last Supper\" Leonardo da Vinci religious and artistic significance']\n\n2. **Parse the search results for links:**\n   - :evidence1: = LinkParser[:evidence0:]\n\n3. **Extract text from the relevant websites:**\n   - :evidence2: = TextExtractor[:evidence1:]\n\n4. **Summarize the significance using AIQA:**\n   - :evidence3: = AIQA['What is the religious and artistic significance of Leonardo da Vinci\\'s \"The Last Supper\"? Given context: :evidence2:']\n\n5. **Provide the final answer:**\n   - Answer: :evidence3:"
