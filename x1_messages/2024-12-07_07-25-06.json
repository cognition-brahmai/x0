        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a car rental company. Let's see what it's asking. There are 50 cars, each rented out for an average of 20 days per month, and they charge $30 per day for each car. I need to find out how much revenue the company generates in a year.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what revenue means in this context. Revenue is basically the total income the company gets from renting out its cars. So, if they rent out cars and charge per day, the revenue would be the number of cars rented, multiplied by the number of days they're rented, multiplied by the daily charge.\n\nSo, the formula for revenue can be:\n\nRevenue = Number of cars \u00d7 Average rental days per month \u00d7 Daily charge \u00d7 Number of months in a year\n\nWait, but let's double-check that. Since the average rental days per month is given, and we're to find annual revenue, we need to consider that there are 12 months in a year.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to calculate the monthly revenue first and then multiply by 12 to get the annual revenue.\n\nAlternatively, I can directly multiply the average rental days per month by 12 to get the average rental days per year for each car, and then multiply by the daily charge and the number of cars.\n\nLet me try both approaches to see if I get the same answer.\n\nFirst approach:\n\n1. Calculate monthly revenue:\n\nMonthly revenue = Number of cars \u00d7 Average rental days per month \u00d7 Daily charge\n\nThen,\n\nAnnual revenue = Monthly revenue \u00d7 12\n\nSecond approach:\n\n1. Calculate average rental days per year for each car:\n\nAverage rental days per year = Average rental days per month \u00d7 12\n\nThen,\n\nAnnual revenue = Number of cars \u00d7 Average rental days per year \u00d7 Daily charge\n\nBoth approaches should give the same result. Let's plug in the numbers.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Number of cars = 50\n\n- Average rental days per month = 20\n\n- Daily charge = $30\n\n- Number of months in a year = 12\n\nFirst approach:\n\nMonthly revenue = 50 cars \u00d7 20 days/month \u00d7 $30/day\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n50 \u00d7 20 = 1000\n\n1000 \u00d7 30 = 30,000\n\nSo, monthly revenue is $30,000.\n\nThen, annual revenue = $30,000/month \u00d7 12 months/year = $360,000/year\n\nNow, second approach:\n\nAverage rental days per year = 20 days/month \u00d7 12 months/year = 240 days/year\n\nThen, annual revenue = 50 cars \u00d7 240 days/year \u00d7 $30/day\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n50 \u00d7 240 = 12,000\n\n12,000 \u00d7 30 = 360,000\n\nSo, annual revenue is $360,000/year\n\nBoth approaches give the same answer, which is a good sign. So, the company generates $360,000 in revenue per year from renting out its 50 cars.\n\nBut wait, let's think a bit more deeply. Is there any other factor that might affect the revenue? For example, are there any costs involved in renting the cars, like maintenance or insurance, that might reduce the revenue? Or is there a chance that some cars aren't rented out for the full 20 days per month?\n\nThe problem states that each car is rented out for an average of 20 days per month, so it seems like they're already accounting for any days when the cars aren't rented. The average takes into account both the days rented and the days not rented.\n\nAlso, the problem is asking for revenue, not profit. Revenue is the total income before any expenses are subtracted. So, we don't need to consider costs like maintenance or insurance for this calculation.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any seasonal fluctuations in rental rates or days rented. For example, maybe in summer more people rent cars, and in winter fewer rent them. But the problem states an average of 20 days per month, so it's probably already accounting for any seasonal variations.\n\nAdditionally, the problem specifies that they charge $30 per day for each car. It doesn't mention any additional fees or taxes that might be added to the daily charge, so I'll assume that $30 is the net amount they charge per day per car.\n\nIt's also important to make sure that the units are consistent. We have days per month, months per year, and daily charges in dollars. By multiplying these together, we get the total revenue in dollars per year, which is what's being asked.\n\nLet me just double-check the calculations to be absolutely sure.\n\nFirst, 50 cars \u00d7 20 days/month = 1,000 car-days per month\n\nThen, 1,000 car-days per month \u00d7 $30/day = $30,000/month\n\nAnnual revenue: $30,000/month \u00d7 12 months/year = $360,000/year\n\nAlternatively, 20 days/month \u00d7 12 months/year = 240 days/year per car\n\nThen, 50 cars \u00d7 240 days/year = 12,000 car-days per year\n\n12,000 car-days per year \u00d7 $30/day = $360,000/year\n\nYes, both methods confirm the same annual revenue.\n\nSo, the company generates $360,000 in revenue per year from renting out its 50 cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360000} \\]"
