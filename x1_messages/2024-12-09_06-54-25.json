        "content": "So there are 50 apples in the basket to start with. You take out 5 apples, so that means there are now 50 - 5 = 45 apples left in the basket. Then you put back 3 rotten apples. So now the basket has 45 + 3 = 48 apples.\n\nBut the question is about how many good apples are left. We know that the 3 apples you put back are rotten, so they're not good. The original 50 apples were all considered good until you took some out and put back the rotten ones.\n\nSo, originally, 50 good apples.\n\nYou took out 5 apples, so now there are 45 good apples left (assuming the ones you took out were good, since you put back rotten ones separately).\n\nThen you put back 3 rotten apples, which are not good, so the number of good apples doesn't change from 45.\n\nTherefore, there are 45 good apples left in the basket.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe some of the apples you took out were already rotten. The problem doesn't specify whether the 5 apples you took out were all good or if some were already rotten.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"There are 50 apples in a basket. You take out 5 apples and then put back 3 rotten apples.\"\n\nFrom this, it seems that the 5 apples you took out were separate from the 3 rotten apples you put back. It implies that the 5 apples you took out were perhaps good apples, and then you put back 3 rotten ones.\n\nSo, starting with 50 good apples.\n\nTake out 5 good apples: 50 - 5 = 45 good apples left.\n\nPut back 3 rotten apples: now the basket has 45 good apples + 3 rotten apples = 48 total apples.\n\nBut the question asks for the number of good apples left, which is still 45.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 apples you took out included some rotten ones, but the problem doesn't specify.\n\nThe way the problem is phrased, \"take out 5 apples and then put back 3 rotten apples,\" suggests that the 3 rotten apples are different from the 5 you took out.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 45 good apples left in the basket.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
