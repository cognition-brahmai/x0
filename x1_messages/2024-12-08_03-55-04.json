It's lovely to be back.\n\n**Graham:** Now, Adele, you've been on this show before, but today is different because you've just released your highly anticipated new album, \"30.\" Can you tell us what inspired this album?\n\n**Adele:** Absolutely. So, \"30\" is really a reflection on my life over the past few years. It's about growing up, becoming a mother, going through a divorce, and just trying to make sense of all these big changes. It was important for me to be honest and vulnerable in my music, to share these experiences with my fans.\n\n**Graham:** That's beautiful. And it shows in the music. Your voice is as powerful as ever. Now, I know you've been very open about your personal life, but is there anything in particular from \"30\" that you're especially proud of?\n\n**Adele:** Hmm, that's a tough one because each song holds a special place for me. But if I had to pick, maybe \"Easy On Me.\" It's the first single, and it feels like a return to my roots, you know? It's simple, acoustic, and really touches on themes of forgiveness and moving forward.\n\n**Graham:** \"Easy On Me\" has already become a massive hit. People are connecting with it on such a deep level. Now, switching gears a bit, you're not just a singer; you're also an actress. You recently starred in \"Cinderella.\" How was that experience?\n\n**Adele:** Oh, it was incredible! Playing the lead role in \"Cinderella\" was a dream come true. I've always loved musicals, and getting to sing and act in such a classic story was so much fun. It was a bit intimidating at first, but the whole crew was amazing, and it was a fantastic learning experience.\n\n**Graham:** I'm sure our audience would love to hear a little snippet from the movie. Do you think you could perform one of the songs from \"Cinderella\" for us?\n\n**Adele:** Absolutely! How about \"Ten Minutes\"? It's one of my favorites from the film.\n\n**[Adele stands up, the band starts playing, and she performs \"Ten Minutes\" from \"Cinderella\"]**\n\n**[After the performance, the audience applauds enthusiastically]**\n\n**Graham:** That was spectacular! Now, Adele, you're known for your incredible live performances. Are there any plans for touring or live shows in the near future?\n\n**Adele:** Well, I'm really looking forward to getting back on stage. I've missed connecting with my fans in person. I haven't announced any tour dates yet, but I promise, it's something I'm considering seriously. Maybe sometime next year?\n\n**Graham:** Fingers crossed! Now, speaking of fans, you have a massive global following. Is there a particular moment or interaction with your fans that stands out to you?\n\n**Adele:** Oh, there are so many amazing moments. But one that comes to mind is when I did a secret show in New York a few years ago. It was just me and a small venue, and seeing how passionate the fans were, singing along to every word, it was really touching. It reminded me why I do what I do.\n\n**Graham:** That's lovely. Now, Adele, you're also a mother. How has motherhood influenced your music and your perspective on life?\n\n**Adele:** Becoming a mother has been the most transformative experience of my life. It's taught me so much about love and sacrifice. In my music, I think it's made me more compassionate and understanding. I try to convey those feelings in my songs now.\n\n**Graham:** It shows. Your music has always been heartfelt, but there's an extra layer of maturity now. Now, switching gears again, you're known for your fashion sense as well. Who are some of your favorite designers or fashion icons?\n\n**Adele:** Oh, I love fashion! It's a way for me to express myself beyond music. I've worked with some amazing designers like Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney. As for icons, I admire people like Jane Birkin and Grace Jones\u2014\u5979\u4eec\u90fd\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u72ec\u7279\u3002\n\n**Graham:** They certainly do. Now, Adele, you've had an incredible career so far, but I have to ask, what's next for you? Any projects or goals you're excited about?\n\n**Adele:** Well, besides possibly touring, I'm interested in doing more acting. I love being on set and bringing characters to life. Maybe a TV series someday? Also, I'm always writing music, so you can expect more albums in the future.\n\n**Graham:** We can't wait to see what you do next. Before we wrap up, is there anything you'd like to say to your fans?\n\n**Adele:** Just a big thank you to everyone who supports my music and journey. It means the world to me. I'm grateful for every single one of you.\n\n**Graham:** That's so sweet. Well, Adele, it's been an absolute pleasure having you here. Everyone, make sure to check out her new album \"30.\" Adele, thank you so much for joining us tonight.\n\n**Adele:** Thank you, Graham! It was great being here.\n\n**[Audience applause as Adele waves goodbye and exits the stage]**\n\n**Graham:** Don't go anywhere; we've got more guests coming up next. Stay tuned!\n\n**[The show continues with the next segment]**\n\n**[End of Transcript]**"
