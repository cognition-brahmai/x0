He is often credited with discovering America because his voyages in the late 15th century opened up the New World to European exploration and colonization. However, it's important to note that there were already indigenous peoples living in America before his arrival, and some argue that Norse explorer Leif Erikson reached North America centuries earlier. But in terms of widespread European knowledge and subsequent exploration, Columbus's voyages are indeed seminal."
