        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students enrolled in Math and Science. There are 25 students in total. 10 are enrolled in Math, 8 in Science, and 5 are enrolled in both subjects. I need to find out how many students are not enrolled in either subject.\n\nOkay, first, I should probably figure out how many students are enrolled in at least one of the subjects, and then subtract that from the total number of students to find those who aren't enrolled in either.\n\nI know that if I just add the number of students in Math and Science, that would be 10 + 8 = 18. But wait, that counts the students enrolled in both subjects twice, once for Math and once for Science. Since there are 5 students enrolled in both, I need to subtract those 5 to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, the number of students enrolled in at least one subject would be:\n\n10 (Math) + 8 (Science) - 5 (both) = 13 students.\n\nNow, if there are 25 students in total, and 13 are enrolled in at least one subject, then the number of students not enrolled in either subject would be:\n\n25 - 13 = 12 students.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check my reasoning.\n\nLet me think about it differently. I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe formula for the number of students enrolled in at least one subject is:\n\nNumber in Math OR Science = Number in Math + Number in Science - Number in Both.\n\nSo, Math OR Science = 10 + 8 - 5 = 13, just like I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the number not enrolled in either would indeed be the total number minus those enrolled in at least one subject: 25 - 13 = 12.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of sets.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Total students: 25\n\n- Math: 10 students\n\n- Science: 8 students\n\n- Both: 5 students\n\nSo, the number of students only in Math would be 10 - 5 = 5.\n\nThe number of students only in Science would be 8 - 5 = 3.\n\nThen, the number of students in at least one subject would be only Math + only Science + both, which is 5 + 3 + 5 = 13.\n\nAgain, subtracting from total students: 25 - 13 = 12.\n\nHmm, consistent with my previous calculation.\n\nIs there another way to look at this to confirm?\n\nMaybe using a Venn diagram.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents Math students, the other represents Science students.\n\nThe overlap, which is both subjects, has 5 students.\n\nSo, the part of the Math circle only would be 10 - 5 = 5.\n\nThe part of the Science circle only would be 8 - 5 = 3.\n\nThen, the total enrolled in at least one subject is 5 (only Math) + 3 (only Science) + 5 (both) = 13.\n\nAgain, 25 total - 13 = 12 not enrolled in either.\n\nWait, maybe I can approach this using set theory formulas.\n\nThe formula for the union of two sets is:\n\nn(A \u222a B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \u2229 B)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n(A) is the number in set A (Math)\n\n- n(B) is the number in set B (Science)\n\n- n(A \u2229 B) is the number in both\n\nSo, n(Math \u222a Science) = 10 + 8 - 5 = 13.\n\nThen, the number not in either is total students - n(Math \u222a Science) = 25 - 13 = 12.\n\nAlright, I'm seeing the same answer from different approaches, which gives me confidence.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any possibility that some students are enrolled in more than two subjects? Well, the problem only mentions Math and Science, so I assume that's all we're dealing with.\n\nAlso, it's a class of 25 students, and the enrollments are solely in Math and/or Science.\n\nSince the question is clear, and my calculations are consistent across different methods, I think 12 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's imagine if there was an error in the initial assumptions.\n\nSuppose some students are enrolled in neither, which is what we're trying to find.\n\nIf we didn't subtract the overlap correctly, we might get a different number.\n\nBut as I've checked multiple times and with different methods, I'm confident that 12 is the correct number of students not enrolled in either subject.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
