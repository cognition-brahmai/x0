        "content": "So, you've got a water tank that holds 500 gallons, and there's a faucet attached to it that lets out water at a rate of 2 gallons per minute. You want to know how long it'll take to drain the tank completely. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the tank's capacity and the faucet's flow rate. The tank has 500 gallons, and the faucet releases 2 gallons every minute. So, to find out how many minutes it'll take to empty the tank, I should divide the total volume of the tank by the flow rate of the faucet.\n\nThat is, time = total volume / flow rate.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: time = 500 gallons / 2 gallons per minute.\n\nLet me do the math: 500 divided by 2 is 250. So, it should take 250 minutes to empty the tank.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. Maybe there's something I'm missing here. Is the flow rate constant? Assuming it is, since there's no information suggesting otherwise.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any other factors affecting the draining process, like the height of the water in the tank or changes in pressure. But since this seems like a straightforward problem, I'll assume that the flow rate remains constant throughout.\n\nSo, time = 500 / 2 = 250 minutes.\n\nMaybe I can convert that into hours to make it more relatable. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 250 minutes divided by 60 would give me the time in hours.\n\n250 divided by 60 is approximately 4.1667 hours. So, roughly 4 hours and 10 minutes.\n\nBut since the original question asks for the time in minutes, 250 minutes is the precise answer.\n\nLet me confirm this with a different approach. If the faucet releases 2 gallons per minute, then in one minute, 2 gallons are gone. So, in 250 minutes, 250 times 2 equals 500 gallons, which matches the tank's capacity.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the tank has 500 gallons, and every minute, 2 gallons are removed. So, the number of minutes required to remove all the water is 500 divided by 2, which again is 250 minutes.\n\nI think that's solid. No other factors seem to be in play here, so 250 minutes is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{250} \\]"
