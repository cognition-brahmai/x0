        "content": "So I have this problem here: a bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 30 books. I need to find out how many books the entire bookshelf can hold. And I have to show my work.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I know that there are 5 shelves, and each one can hold 30 books. So, basically, I need to find the total capacity of all the shelves combined.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is by using multiplication. Since each shelf holds the same number of books, I can multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf to get the total number of books.\n\nSo, that would be:\n\nTotal books = number of shelves \u00d7 number of books per shelf\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal books = 5 \u00d7 30\n\nNow, 5 times 30 is 150. So, the bookshelf can hold 150 books in total.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this to confirm that I'm right? Maybe I can use addition. If each shelf holds 30 books, then adding 30 for each shelf should give me the same total.\n\nLet's try that:\n\nFirst shelf: 30 books\n\nSecond shelf: 30 books\n\nThird shelf: 30 books\n\nFourth shelf: 30 books\n\nFifth shelf: 30 books\n\nNow, adding them up: 30 + 30 + 30 + 30 + 30\n\nThat's 30 multiplied by 5, which again is 150.\n\nOkay, so both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like the bookshelf can hold 150 books in total.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if all shelves are fully loaded. The problem says \"each shelf can hold 30 books,\" but it doesn't specify if they are all filled to capacity. However, since it's asking for the total capacity, not the current number of books, I think assuming each shelf is filled to its maximum capacity is correct.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Maybe the size of the books or something like that, but the problem doesn't provide any additional information, so I don't think that's necessary.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the bookshelf can hold 150 books in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
