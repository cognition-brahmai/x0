        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangle. It says the length is 15 meters and the width is 8 meters, and I need to find both the area and the perimeter. Okay, let's start with the area first.\n\nI remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, if the length is 15 meters and the width is 8 meters, the area should be 15 times 8. Let me do that multiplication: 15 \u00d7 8 equals 120. So, the area is 120 square meters.\n\nNow, for the perimeter. I think the perimeter is the total distance around the rectangle. To find that, I need to add up all the sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, I can calculate it as 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. So, that would be 2 \u00d7 15 plus 2 \u00d7 8. Let's do those calculations step by step.\n\nFirst, 2 \u00d7 15 is 30 meters. Then, 2 \u00d7 8 is 16 meters. Now, I add those together: 30 plus 16 equals 46 meters. So, the perimeter is 46 meters.\n\nWait a minute, I just did those calculations in my head, but I should make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check the area first. Length times width: 15 \u00d7 8. Yes, that's 120 square meters. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for the perimeter: 2 times the length is 30 meters, and 2 times the width is 16 meters. Adding them up gives 46 meters. That looks right too.\n\nJust to be thorough, is there another way to calculate the perimeter? I think I've seen another formula for perimeter, which is 2 times the sum of the length and width. Let me try that. So, 2 \u00d7 (15 + 8) equals 2 \u00d7 23, which is 46 meters. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, that confirms it.\n\nSo, to summarize, the area of the rectangle is 120 square meters, and the perimeter is 46 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe area of the rectangle is \\boxed{120} square meters, and the perimeter is \\boxed{46} meters."
