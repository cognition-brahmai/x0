        "content": "So, the company has 10 employees, and they're giving each one a 15% raise. The current total salary for all employees is $500,000 per year. I need to find out how much the payroll cost will increase overall because of these raises.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a 15% raise means for each employee. If an employee currently makes a certain amount, a 15% raise means they get an additional 15% of their current salary on top of what they already make.\n\nBut since I don't have the individual salaries, and I have the total current salary for all employees, which is $500,000, I can work with that.\n\nI think the easiest way is to calculate 15% of the total current salary. That should give me the total increase in payroll cost.\n\nSo, 15% of $500,000.\n\nTo calculate that, I can convert 15% to a decimal, which is 0.15, and then multiply it by $500,000.\n\nLet me do that:\n\n0.15 \u00d7 500,000 = 75,000.\n\nSo, the total increase in payroll cost would be $75,000 per year.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this to confirm?\n\nMaybe I can think about it on a per-employee basis.\n\nIf there are 10 employees, and each gets a 15% raise, then overall, the total payroll should increase by 15% across all employees.\n\nBut since a 15% raise for each employee collectively means a 15% increase in the total payroll, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to calculate the raise for each employee individually and then sum them up, it should also give me the same total increase.\n\nLet's assume each employee makes the same salary. But actually, they might make different amounts. However, since I don't have individual salaries, the first method is more straightforward.\n\nBut just to verify, if all 10 employees make the same salary, then each makes $500,000 divided by 10, which is $50,000 per year.\n\nThen, a 15% raise for each would be 0.15 \u00d7 $50,000 = $7,500 per employee.\n\nFor 10 employees, that would be 10 \u00d7 $7,500 = $75,000, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIf the employees have different salaries, the total increase would still be 15% of the total current salary, assuming the raise percentage is the same for all.\n\nTherefore, the total increase in payroll cost is $75,000 per year.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75000} \\]"
