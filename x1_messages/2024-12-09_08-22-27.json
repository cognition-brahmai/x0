        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a PHP script that connects to a MySQL database and retrieves records from a \"users\" table where the user's age is between 18 and 25. Then, I'll show you how to display these results in an HTML table, sorted by the last name in ascending order.\n\nFirst things first, make sure you have a MySQL database set up with a \"users\" table. The \"users\" table should have columns for first name, last name, and age, at the very least. For this example, I'll assume the table has the following structure:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE users (\n    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    first_name VARCHAR(50),\n    last_name VARCHAR(50),\n    age INT\n);\n```\n\nNow, let's proceed step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Connect to the MySQL Database\n\nYou need to establish a connection to your MySQL database using PHP. You can use the `mysqli` or `PDO` extensions for this purpose. I'll use `mysqli` in this example because it's straightforward.\n\nCreate a new PHP file, say `fetch_users.php`, and start by setting up the database connection.\n\n```php\n<?php\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"your_username\";\n$password = \"your_password\";\n$dbname = \"your_database\";\n\n// Create connection\n$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n// Check connection\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n?>\n```\n\nReplace `\"your_username\"`, `\"your_password\"`, and `\"your_database\"` with your actual database credentials.\n\n### Step 2: Perform the Query\n\nNext, you need to write a SQL query that selects users whose age is between 18 and 25, and sorts the results by the last name in ascending order.\n\nHere's the SQL query you'll use:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 25 ORDER BY last_name ASC;\n```\n\nIn PHP, you can execute this query using the `mysqli` object.\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Perform the query\n$sql = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 25 ORDER BY last_name ASC\";\n$result = $conn->query($sql);\n?>\n```\n\n### Step 3: Display the Results in an HTML Table\n\nNow, you need to fetch the results from the database and display them in an HTML table.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```php\n<?php\nif ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n    // Output data as an HTML table\n    echo \"<table border='1'>\n            <tr>\n                <th>ID</th>\n                <th>First Name</th>\n                <th>Last Name</th>\n                <th>Age</th>\n            </tr>\";\n    while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n        echo \"<tr>\n                <td>\" . $row[\"id\"] . \"</td>\n                <td>\" . $row[\"first_name\"] . \"</td>\n                <td>\" . $row[\"last_name\"] . \"</td>\n                <td>\" . $row[\"age\"] . \"</td>\n              </tr>\";\n    }\n    echo \"</table>\";\n} else {\n    echo \"0 results\";\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis code checks if there are any rows returned by the query. If there are, it creates an HTML table with headers for ID, First Name, Last Name, and Age. It then loops through each row of the result set and creates a table row for each user.\n\n### Step 4: Close the Database Connection\n\nIt's a good practice to close the database connection once you're done with it.\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Close the connection\n$conn->close();\n?>\n```\n\n### Putting It All Together\n\nHere's the complete `fetch_users.php` script:\n\n```php\n<?php\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"your_username\";\n$password = \"your_password\";\n$dbname = \"your_database\";\n\n// Create connection\n$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n// Check connection\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n\n// Perform the query\n$sql = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 25 ORDER BY last_name ASC\";\n$result = $conn->query($sql);\n\nif ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n    // Output data as an HTML table\n    echo \"<table border='1'>\n            <tr>\n                <th>ID</th>\n                <th>First Name</th>\n                <th>Last Name</th>\n                <th>Age</th>\n            </tr>\";\n    while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n        echo \"<tr>\n                <td>\" . $row[\"id\"] . \"</td>\n                <td>\" . $row[\"first_name\"] . \"</td>\n                <td>\" . $row[\"last_name\"] . \"</td>\n                <td>\" . $row[\"age\"] . \"</td>\n              </tr>\";\n    }\n    echo \"</table>\";\n} else {\n    echo \"0 results\";\n}\n\n// Close the connection\n$conn->close();\n?>\n```\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n1. **Security**: This script is basic and doesn't include any security measures. In a production environment, you should sanitize inputs and use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling to manage different types of errors gracefully.\n\n3. **Styling**: You might want to add some CSS to make the table look better.\n\n4. **Pagination**: If there are many users, consider implementing pagination to display a manageable number of records per page.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with your PHP and MySQL project!
