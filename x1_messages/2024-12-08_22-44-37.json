        "content": "So there's this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a class with 15 students, out of which 8 are boys and 7 are girls. The teacher is going to randomly select 2 students to present their projects, and we need to find the probability that both of those selected students are girls.\n\nAlright, probability questions can sometimes be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step. I remember that probability is basically the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcome is selecting 2 girls, and the total outcomes are all possible ways to select any 2 students from the class.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to select 2 students out of 15. Since the order in which we select the students doesn't matter (selecting student A and then student B is the same as selecting student B and then student A), we should use combinations here, not permutations.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 students out of 15 is:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 2) = \\frac{15!}{2!(15 - 2)!} = \\frac{15!}{2! \\times 13!}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this by canceling out the \\( 13! \\) in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 2) = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 13!} = \\frac{15 \\times 14}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{210}{2} = 105\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 105 possible ways to choose any 2 students from the class.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of the 7 girls available. Again, since the order doesn't matter, we use combinations:\n\n\\[\nC(7, 2) = \\frac{7!}{2!(7 - 2)!} = \\frac{7!}{2! \\times 5!}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\n\\[\nC(7, 2) = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 5!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{42}{2} = 21\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 21 ways to choose 2 girls from the 7 girls.\n\nNow, the probability that both selected students are girls is the number of favorable outcomes (selecting 2 girls) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (selecting any 2 students):\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both girls}) = \\frac{C(7, 2)}{C(15, 2)} = \\frac{21}{105}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 21:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{21}{105} = \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability that both selected students are girls is \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\).\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check our calculations to make sure we didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total number of ways to choose 2 students out of 15:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 2) = \\frac{15 \\times 14}{2 \\times 1} = 105\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNext, number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 7:\n\n\\[\nC(7, 2) = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21\n\\]\n\nThat also seems correct.\n\nThen, the probability is \\( \\frac{21}{105} = \\frac{1}{5} \\), which is 0.2 or 20%.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the probabilities step by step. The probability that the first student selected is a girl is \\( \\frac{7}{15} \\), since there are 7 girls out of 15 students.\n\nThen, given that the first student selected is a girl, there are now 6 girls left and a total of 14 students left. So, the probability that the second student selected is also a girl is \\( \\frac{6}{14} = \\frac{3}{7} \\).\n\nTo find the probability that both events happen (both students are girls), we multiply these probabilities:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both girls}) = \\frac{7}{15} \\times \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{21}{105} = \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\nAgain, we get the same result, which reinforces that our answer is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another approach. We could also calculate the probability using permutations if we consider the order of selection, but since order doesn't matter in this problem, combinations are the way to go. However, for learning purposes, let's see how it would work with permutations.\n\nUsing permutations, the total number of ways to select 2 students out of 15, considering order, is:\n\n\\[\nP(15, 2) = \\frac{15!}{(15 - 2)!} = 15 \\times 14 = 210\n\\]\n\nThe number of ways to select 2 girls out of 7, considering order, is:\n\n\\[\nP(7, 2) = \\frac{7!}{(7 - 2)!} = 7 \\times 6 = 42\n\\]\n\nThen, the probability that both selected students are girls would be:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both girls}) = \\frac{42}{210} = \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\nAgain, we arrive at the same probability, \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\).\n\nThis consistency across different methods makes me confident that the answer is indeed \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\).\n\nJust to explore a bit more, let's consider the probability of selecting at least one girl. This might not be directly asked in the problem, but it's good practice.\n\nThe probability of selecting at least one girl can be found by subtracting the probability of selecting no girls (i.e., selecting 2 boys) from 1.\n\nFirst, find the probability of selecting 2 boys. There are 8 boys, so:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{8!}{2!(8 - 2)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability of selecting 2 boys is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both boys}) = \\frac{28}{105} = \\frac{4}{15}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting at least one girl is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least one girl}) = 1 - P(\\text{both boys}) = 1 - \\frac{4}{15} = \\frac{11}{15}\n\\]\n\nThis is just additional information and not part of the original question, but it's good to see how different probabilities relate to each other.\n\nIn conclusion, the probability that both selected students are girls is \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\), or 20%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{5}} \\]"
