        "content": "So I've got this problem here: If I invest $10,000 at an annual interest rate of 5%, and it's compounded quarterly, how much will it be worth after 3 years? Okay, let's break this down. I remember that compound interest means that the interest earned also earns interest over time, and since it's compounded quarterly, that means it's done four times a year.\n\nFirst, I need to know the formula for compound interest. I think it's something like A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount, which is the initial amount of money, so that's $10,000.\n\n- r is the annual interest rate, which is 5%, but I need to write that as a decimal, so that's 0.05.\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and since it's quarterly, that's 4.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for, in years, which is 3.\n\nSo plugging in these values, I get:\n\nA = 10000(1 + 0.05/4)^(4*3)\n\nLet me calculate that step by step. First, calculate the interest rate per period:\n\n0.05 / 4 = 0.0125\n\nNow, add 1 to that:\n\n1 + 0.0125 = 1.0125\n\nNext, raise that to the power of 4 times 3, which is 12:\n\n1.0125^12\n\nI'll need to calculate 1.0125 raised to the 12th power. Let me see:\n\n1.0125^2 = 1.02515625\n\n1.0125^4 = (1.02515625)^2 = 1.0509453125\n\n1.0125^8 = (1.0509453125)^2 = approximately 1.10494155\n\n1.0125^12 = 1.0125^8 * 1.0125^4 = 1.10494155 * 1.0509453125 \u2248 1.16147181\n\nSo, A = 10000 * 1.16147181 \u2248 11614.7181\n\nRounding to the nearest cent, that would be $11,614.72.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations. Starting with the quarterly interest rate:\n\n0.05 / 4 = 0.0125, that's correct.\n\nThen, 1 + 0.0125 = 1.0125, correct.\n\nRaising to the 12th power:\n\n1.0125^2 = 1.02515625\n\n1.02515625^2 = 1.0509453125\n\n1.0509453125^2 = 1.10494155\n\nThen, 1.10494155 * 1.0509453125 = 1.16147181\n\nMultiplying by the principal amount: 10000 * 1.16147181 = 11614.7181, which rounds to $11,614.72.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a financial calculator or an online compound interest calculator to verify this. But based on the formula and my step-by-step calculation, $11,614.72 seems correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the interest earned each quarter and add it up, but that would be more time-consuming for multiple periods. The formula is designed to simplify that process.\n\nSo, after 3 years, the investment would be worth approximately $11,614.72.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11614.72} \\]"
