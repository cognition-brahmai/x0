        "content": "So the original garden is 15 meters long and 8 meters wide, and the gardener wants to add a 2-meter-wide border around the entire garden. I need to find out what the new dimensions and the new area will be after adding this border.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the border affects the dimensions of the garden. Since the border is added around the entire garden, it means that on every side of the garden, the border extends out by 2 meters.\n\nSo, for the length:\n\nThe original length is 15 meters. The border adds 2 meters to each end of the length. That means total addition to the length is 2 meters + 2 meters = 4 meters.\n\nTherefore, the new length will be:\n\n15 meters + 4 meters = 19 meters.\n\nSimilarly, for the width:\n\nThe original width is 8 meters. The border adds 2 meters to each side of the width. So, total addition to the width is 2 meters + 2 meters = 4 meters.\n\nTherefore, the new width will be:\n\n8 meters + 4 meters = 12 meters.\n\nNow, to find the new area of the garden including the border, I need to multiply the new length by the new width.\n\nNew area = new length \u00d7 new width = 19 meters \u00d7 12 meters.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n19 \u00d7 12:\n\n19 \u00d7 10 = 190\n\n19 \u00d7 2 = 38\n\nSo, 190 + 38 = 228 square meters.\n\nTherefore, the new dimensions are 19 meters in length and 12 meters in width, and the new area is 228 square meters.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can visualize this to make sure I'm correct.\n\nImagine the original garden is a rectangle that is longer in one direction, 15 meters long and 8 meters wide. Now, adding a 2-meter-wide border around it means that on all sides, the garden is extended by 2 meters.\n\nSo, if I draw this, starting with the original garden:\n\n- Length: 15 meters\n\n- Width: 8 meters\n\nNow, adding 2 meters to each side:\n\n- On the length side, 2 meters on one end and 2 meters on the other end, so total addition is 4 meters.\n\n- Similarly, on the width side, 2 meters on one side and 2 meters on the other side, so again, total addition is 4 meters.\n\nTherefore, the new dimensions should indeed be:\n\n- New length: 15 + 4 = 19 meters\n\n- New width: 8 + 4 = 12 meters\n\nAnd the area is length times width, so 19 \u00d7 12 = 228 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the border as creating a larger rectangle that encompasses the original garden and the border around it.\n\nIn that case, the border is 2 meters wide all around, so the new rectangle's length would be the original length plus twice the border width (since the border is on both sides), and similarly for the width.\n\nSo, new length = original length + 2 \u00d7 border width = 15 + 2 \u00d7 2 = 15 + 4 = 19 meters\n\nNew width = original width + 2 \u00d7 border width = 8 + 2 \u00d7 2 = 8 + 4 = 12 meters\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nTo find the area, multiply the new length and width: 19 \u00d7 12 = 228 square meters.\n\nI think this is correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can calculate the area of the border alone and see if it makes sense.\n\nThe area of the original garden is 15 \u00d7 8 = 120 square meters.\n\nThe new area is 228 square meters.\n\nSo, the area of the border is 228 - 120 = 108 square meters.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nWell, the border is 2 meters wide around the entire garden.\n\nIf I think of the border as consisting of four rectangles:\n\n- Two rectangular borders along the length: each is 15 meters long and 2 meters wide.\n\n- Two rectangular borders along the width: each is 8 meters long and 2 meters wide.\n\nHowever, this would count the corners twice, so I need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, actually, since the border is added around the entire garden, it's more accurate to think of it as a larger rectangle minus the original rectangle.\n\nSo, the area of the border is indeed the new area minus the original area, which is 228 - 120 = 108 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the border as four rectangles:\n\n- Two lengths: 15 meters \u00d7 2 meters = 30 square meters each\n\n- Two widths: 8 meters \u00d7 2 meters = 16 square meters each\n\nSo, total area would be 2 \u00d7 30 + 2 \u00d7 16 = 60 + 32 = 92 square meters\n\nWait, that's different from 108 square meters.\n\nHmm, why is there a discrepancy here?\n\nAh, I see. When I think of the border as four rectangles, I'm not accounting for the corners. Each corner is a square of 2 meters by 2 meters, which is 4 square meters per corner.\n\nSince there are four corners, that's an additional 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 square meters.\n\nSo, total border area would be 92 + 16 = 108 square meters, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, everything checks out.\n\nSo, the new dimensions of the garden including the border are 19 meters in length and 12 meters in width, and the new area is 228 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe new dimensions of the garden including the border are \\boxed{19 \\text{ meters by } 12 \\text{ meters}} and the new area is \\boxed{228 \\text{ square meters}}."
