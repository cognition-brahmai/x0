        "content": "Let's see. The train is going from City A to City B, which is 240 miles apart, and it's moving at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. So, first, I need to figure out how long it takes to cover that distance without considering the stop.\n\nIf the distance is 240 miles and the speed is 60 mph, then the time it takes to travel that distance is time equals distance divided by speed. So, 240 miles divided by 60 mph should give me the time in hours.\n\nLet me calculate that: 240 divided by 60 is 4. So, it takes 4 hours to travel from City A to City B without any stops.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that halfway through the journey, it makes a 30-minute stop at a station. Halfway through the journey would be at 120 miles, right? Since the total distance is 240 miles.\n\nSo, the train travels 120 miles to the halfway point, stops for 30 minutes, and then continues the remaining 120 miles to City B.\n\nI already know that without stops, the entire journey takes 4 hours. But with the stop, I need to add that 30 minutes to the total travel time.\n\nSo, 4 hours plus 30 minutes equals 4 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nThe train travels the first half, 120 miles at 60 mph, which should take 2 hours. Then it stops for 30 minutes, and then travels the next 120 miles at 60 mph, which is another 2 hours.\n\nSo, total time is 2 hours plus 30 minutes plus 2 hours, which is indeed 4 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nI think that's the total travel time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
