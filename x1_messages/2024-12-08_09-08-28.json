However, I can tell you that many people who use mechanical keyboards appreciate the tactile feedback and the distinct \"click\" sound they produce with each keystroke. This can make typing feel more satisfying and precise compared to membrane keyboards. Additionally, mechanical keyboards often have higher key travel distances, which some users find more comfortable for extended typing sessions."
