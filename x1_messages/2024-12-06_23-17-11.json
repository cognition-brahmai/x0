        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there are 8 white socks and 12 black socks in a box, and I need to grab a pair of matching socks in complete darkness. The question is, what's the minimum number of socks I must grab to ensure I have a matching pair?\n\nOkay, let's think about this. Since it's completely dark, I can't see the colors, so I have to consider the worst-case scenario to make sure I get a matching pair.\n\nFirst, there are only two colors: white and black. So, if I pick two socks, they could be either both white, both black, or one of each color.\n\nIf I pick two socks and they happen to be the same color, great, I have a matching pair. But if they're different, I need to pick another sock to get a match.\n\nSo, in the worst-case scenario, the first two socks I pick are of different colors. That means I have one white and one black.\n\nNow, if I pick a third sock, it has to be either white or black. If it's white, then I have two white socks, which is a matching pair. If it's black, then I have two black socks, which is also a matching pair.\n\nTherefore, picking three socks guarantees that I have at least one matching pair, because the third sock will necessarily match one of the first two.\n\nLet me double-check this reasoning. If I pick two socks and they're different, then the third one has to match one of them, since there are only two colors. So, yes, three socks are sufficient.\n\nIs there a way to ensure a matching pair by picking fewer than three socks? Well, if I pick only two socks, there's a possibility that they are of different colors, so I don't have a guarantee of a matching pair.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of socks I must grab to ensure I have a matching pair is three.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the total number of socks. There are 8 white and 12 black, making 20 socks in total.\n\nBut the problem is about guaranteeing a matching pair, not about the probability or anything like that. It's more about worst-case scenarios.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose I have more colors. For example, if there were three colors, I would need to pick four socks to guarantee a matching pair, because I could pick one of each color first, and the fourth sock would match one of them.\n\nBut in this case, there are only two colors, so picking three socks should be enough.\n\nAlternatively, think about it like this: the worst thing that could happen is that I pick one white and one black sock first. Then, the next sock I pick will definitely match one of them, because there are only two colors.\n\nSo, yes, three socks are sufficient to guarantee a matching pair.\n\nLet me see if there's a mathematical way to look at this. This seems related to the pigeonhole principle, which states that if you have more items than containers, at least one container must contain more than one item.\n\nIn this case, the \"containers\" are the colors, and the \"items\" are the socks I pick.\n\nThere are two colors, so if I pick three socks, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one color must have at least two socks, which means I have a matching pair.\n\nThat sounds solid.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Like the arrangement of the socks or something? I don't think so, because it's completely dark, so I can't see or choose based on position.\n\nAlso, the number of socks of each color doesn't matter beyond knowing there are only two colors.\n\nEven if there were unequal numbers, like 8 white and 12 black, as long as there are only two colors, the logic still holds.\n\nSo, I think three is the answer.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that there could be more colors accidentally. But the problem specifies only white and black, so I can assume only two colors are present.\n\nTherefore, grabbing three socks ensures that at least two are of the same color.\n\nSo, the minimum number is three.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
