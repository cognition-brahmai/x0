        "content": "Alright, I need to find out what notable works were written by the author of 'Pride and Prejudice'. I know that 'Pride and Prejudice' is a famous novel, and I think it was written by Jane Austen, but I'm not entirely sure. So, first things first, I should confirm who the author is.\n\nPlan: Search for the author of 'Pride and Prejudice'.\n\nTo do this, I can use the WebSearch tool. I'll input the query \"who wrote Pride and Prejudice\" and see what comes up.\n\n:evidence0: = WebSearch[\"who wrote Pride and Prejudice\"]\n\nOnce I have the result from :evidence0:, I should have a list of websites that tell me who the author is. I need to extract the relevant information from these websites.\n\nPlan: Extract text from the search results to find the author's name.\n\nI'll use the TextExtractor tool to get the text from the top few links in :evidence0:.\n\n:evidence1: = TextExtractor[:evidence0:]\n\nNow, with :evidence1:, which is the extracted text, I need to parse it to find the author's name. Maybe I can look for the name that appears most frequently or is mentioned in relation to the book.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the QAModel to directly ask for the author's name from the extracted text.\n\nPlan: Use QAModel to find the author's name from the extracted text.\n\nInput to QAModel: \"Who wrote Pride and Prejudice, given :evidence1:?\"\n\n:evidence2: = QAModel[\"Who wrote Pride and Prejudice, given :evidence1:?\"]\n\nAssuming :evidence2: confirms that Jane Austen is the author, my next step is to find notable works by Jane Austen.\n\nPlan: Search for notable works by Jane Austen.\n\nI can use WebSearch again with the query \"notable works by Jane Austen\".\n\n:evidence3: = WebSearch[\"notable works by Jane Austen\"]\n\nThen, I need to extract the relevant information from the search results.\n\nPlan: Extract text from the search results containing lists of notable works.\n\nUse TextExtractor on :evidence3:.\n\n:evidence4: = TextExtractor[:evidence3:]\n\nNow, with :evidence4:, which is the extracted text, I need to identify the notable works mentioned.\n\nI could use the QAModel to list the notable works from the extracted text.\n\nPlan: Use QAModel to list notable works by Jane Austen from :evidence4:.\n\nInput to QAModel: \"What are some notable works by Jane Austen, given :evidence4:?\"\n\n:evidence5: = QAModel[\"What are some notable works by Jane Austen, given :evidence4:?\"]\n\nFinally, :evidence5: should contain the list of notable works by Jane Austen, which is the answer to the original question.\n\nAnswer: :evidence5:\n\nJust to make sure, I should verify if 'Pride and Prejudice' is included in the list from :evidence5:, as it's one of her notable works. If it's not included, I might need to add it manually.\n\nAlternatively, I could modify the query to include 'Pride and Prejudice' in the list.\n\nBut for now, this plan seems solid.\n\n**Final Plan:**\n\n1. :evidence0: = WebSearch[\"who wrote Pride and Prejudice\"]\n2. :evidence1: = TextExtractor[:evidence0:]\n3. :evidence2: = QAModel[\"Who wrote Pride and Prejudice, given :evidence1:?\"]\n4. :evidence3: = WebSearch[\"notable works by \" + :evidence2:]\n5. :evidence4: = TextExtractor[:evidence3:]\n6. :evidence5: = QAModel[\"What are some notable works by \" + :evidence2: + \", given :evidence4:?\"]\n7. Answer: :evidence5:\n\n**Note:** Ensure that :evidence2: correctly identifies the author's name before proceeding to step 4.\n"
