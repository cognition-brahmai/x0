        "content": "So there's a class of 25 students, and 60% of them passed the exam. I need to find out how many students failed the exam. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many students passed the exam. Since 60% of the 25 students passed, I can calculate that by multiplying 25 by 60%. But wait, percentages can be tricky sometimes. I remember that 60% is the same as 60/100 or 0.6 in decimal form. So, to find 60% of 25, I can multiply 25 by 0.6.\n\nLet me do that: 25 times 0.6. 25 times 0.6 is 15. So, 15 students passed the exam.\n\nNow, to find out how many failed, I can subtract the number of students who passed from the total number of students. So, 25 minus 15 equals 10.\n\nTherefore, 10 students failed the exam.\n\nBut let's double-check that. Another way to approach this is to calculate directly the percentage of students who failed. If 60% passed, then 40% failed, right? Because 100% minus 60% is 40%.\n\nSo, if 40% of the students failed, then I can find 40% of 25 to confirm the number of students who failed.\n\n40% of 25: again, 40% is 0.4 in decimal form. So, 25 times 0.4 is 10.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 10 students failed the exam.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this to ensure I'm not missing anything? Maybe using fractions?\n\nSure, percentages can be expressed as fractions. 60% is the same as 60/100, which simplifies to 3/5. So, if 3/5 of the students passed, then in a class of 25, the number who passed is 3/5 times 25.\n\nLet's calculate that: 3/5 times 25 is (3 times 25) divided by 5, which is 75 divided by 5, which is 15. Again, 15 students passed.\n\nThen, subtracting from the total: 25 minus 15 is 10 students failed.\n\nAlternatively, for the failed students, 40% is 40/100, which simplifies to 2/5. So, 2/5 of 25 is (2 times 25) divided by 5, which is 50 divided by 5, which is also 10.\n\nEverything is consistent here. So, I'm confident that the answer is 10 students failed the exam.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem. For example, maybe some students didn't take the exam, but the problem says \"in a class of 25 students,\" and \"60% of them passed an exam.\" So, it seems like all students took the exam, and either passed or failed.\n\nNo hidden variables here, I think. It's a straightforward percentage problem.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The answer is definitely 10 students failed the exam.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
