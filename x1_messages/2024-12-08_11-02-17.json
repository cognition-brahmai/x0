Giving guidance on guidance. Mark Carney makes his first big speech as governor of the Bank of England. And keeping the dream alive. Fifty years since Martin Luther King\\'s march for jobs and freedom speech. We will be live in Washington in this hour. I\\'m Richard Quest. I mean business. Good evening. Tonight there is growing concern that the conflict in Syria may spread and threaten oil supplies from the region. There may have been no action so far in terms of military activity by the US and allies, but already we are seeing reaction in the markets. As you can see, Brent Crude is now up nearly $3, it\\'s at $117.34 a barrel. And the head of oil research at Societe Generale is warning that Brent may rise to $120 or $125 and beyond in the event of a military strike. Now this, of course, is a great concern, Brent having traded in a relatively secure range of $100 to $107 over, say, the last few months, and that has been largely acceptable in terms of wider economic issues. Now, breaking out of that range, starting to move higher, and causing problems in fragile economies. It\\'s also WTI -- West Texas Intermediate -- is also up. It has gained $0.75. We have a slight situation where unusually WTI is actually cheaper than Brent. It\\'s often the other way around, but at the moment, it\\'s at $109.71. These are levels that have not been seen since 2012. The conflict in Syria has put the emerging markets that we\\'ve talked about over the last few weeks under even more pressure. The Turkish lira -- the Turkish lira and the Indian rupee have both dropped to record lows on Wednesday. The rand in South Africa has also sunk very sharply. Look at the -- let\\'s just concentrate on the rupee, down 7.8 percent so far this week, 3 percent from the lira, and the rand at 1.1 percent. And we\\'ve already had comments, of course, from the head of the -- South African finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, saying that even though it improves export, it does create other difficulties. Investors are reducing their exposure to emerging markets, expecting that the Fed will begin to taper in the next few weeks, and so that is why, of course, we are now seeing both sides of this equation coming along. Let\\'s bring in Rachel Ziemba, the head of emerging markets at Roubini Global Economics. Good to see you. RACHEL ZIEMBA, HEAD OF EMERGING MARKETS, ROUBINI GLOBAL ECONOMICS: It\\'s a pleasure to be with you. QUEST: Well, I have outlined -- set out, if you like, the stall of misery that\\'s in the markets at the moment. Any one of these issues is rather serious, isn\\'t it? ZIEMBA: It is. And what we have, actually, now is a toxic mix of high inflation, low growth, and a vulnerability to tighter financial conditions. And then when you add in a possible increase in oil prices for these oil importing economies, that\\'s just fuel to the fire. But really, I think the tighter financial conditions are really what these countries are ill exposed to. QUEST: What\\'s the big risk for these emerging market economies as they feel this pressure? Because obviously, a country like India cannot withstand 7 percent depreciation in currency even though a $60 billion liquidity fund has been put in place. ZIEMBA: Sure. It\\'s really a question of choices, whether the policies that India can put in pace to stem the decline in the rupee -- QUEST: But they can\\'t -- ZIEMBA: -- involving high interest rates -- QUEST: -- they can\\'t. You don\\'t -- now, let me jump in there. Because you don\\'t believe -- ZIEMBA: Sure. QUEST: -- anymore than the market believes that actually there\\'s anything some of these governments can do to stem this trend. ZIEMBA: I don\\'t -- I think they\\'re going to have to allow the currencies to depreciate. I think we\\'re going to see higher interest rates. But I think under the circumstance, given the inflationary pressures, given the fact that there\\'s positive real returns in the US, I think interest rates are going to have to go up and -- in this circumstance. And that\\'s going to weaken growth, it\\'s going to be particularly problematic for equity markets in many of these countries. QUEST: Right. ZIEMBA: And I think where the RBI is concerned, the fact that they\\'re now targeting three or four different things -- inflation, growth, the currency -- just makes it even more confusing for the markets. QUEST: Right, but -- ZIEMBA: And that, in our mind -- QUEST: I want o strike -- ZIEMBA: -- probably means even tighter policy. QUEST: Forgive me, with the satellite today -- ZIEMBA: Sure. QUEST: Forgive me interrupting you. I just want to throw into this mix the Syria aspect of it, because yesterday -- and yesterday we saw some very sharp falls across European markets, down to six week lows, 2 percent in this market or that market. A bit of a rebound today on the Dow. But fundamentally, if the firing begins, as it\\'s expected, what would you expect the markets to react? Or how? ZIEMBA: I\\'d expect if -- I\\'d expect there\\'d be a knee-jerk reaction, sell- off, in many risky assets, and probably rise in oil prices. If it\\'s limited and surgical and this sort of small response, we might see that mostly priced in even before activity goes on. But here\\'s the issue. We think -- our view is that it\\'s unlikely to be very limited. That we could see a deterioration and regionalization of the conflict. And in that case, we could see more extensive pressure on regional assets. QUEST: Do you -- ZIEMBA: But ultimately -- QUEST: Do you think in any shape or form this -- what we are now seeing, either in emerging markets or in Syria in this aspect, will influence a Fed that might be looking at Sep-tapering? ZIEMBA: Sure. I think whether it\\'s September or December is not sort of the question too much at this point. The real question is that the Fed is going to taper, they are going to start reducing stimulus, and timing does matter. But ultimately, what\\'s going to move the Fed, the Fed is going to be moved by -- by financial contagion to the US and affect on US growth. QUEST: Right. ZIEMBA: So, what we\\'re seeing here at this point, we have -- we\\'ve seen US markets performing quite well. We\\'ve actually seen more flows into US treasuries -- QUEST: Right. ZIEMBA: -- and a flight to safety. And so I think it\\'s really about, if we were to start seeing a big correction in the S&P; 500 that feeds in -- or if we started to see a greater correction in the housing market because 10- year -- 30-year treasuries are increasing and mortgage rates are increasing, that\\'s the kind of thing that would delay the Fed. QUEST: Thank you. ZIEMBA: We still think it might be a December tapering. QUEST: December. It\\'s on its way, just a question of when. Thank you very much for joining us, Rachel. Good to see you -- ZIEMBA: Sure. QUEST: -- many thanks, indeed. Now, Christiane Amanpour is live in France in less than an hour, 50 minutes from now, with all the latest developments on the Syria aspect. The crisis in Syria, that\\'s \"Amanpour,\" live tonight at 8:00 PM in London. Only, of course, on CNN. European markets and indeed around the world continued that unease, uncertainty, which is so disliked. Have a look at the markets. QUEST: They are monitoring what\\'s happening in Syria, and not surprisingly, European markets closed down. We didn\\'t see the sort of losses we saw yesterday, but that loss of 1 percent in Frankfurt is still serious enough. Even Athens, of course, managed to -- wasn\\'t too grim despite the fact and despite the question of whether there\\'ll be another bailout for Greece. In contrast, the US markets are steady nerve. The Dow and the S&P; have moved slightly higher, oil stocks are performing well in the market, and the Dow Jones Industrials is holding their own. To the New York Stock Exchange and Alison Kosik joins me. Alison, a very sharp fall, 170-odd points on the Dow. What the difference a day makes. ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: What a difference a day makes. Don\\'t be fooled here, though. Worries about Syria and possible US military action there, those worries are still present. But you\\'re seeing investors kind of buy back in because stock fell so much yesterday. In fact, one analyst said, what we saw happen yesterday, that 170-point drop, was really more a profit-taking after this huge run-up that stocks had made lately. But another trader says what\\'s happening here with the market is it\\'s basically playing a game of headline roulette and that once events, like the situation in Syria, begin to take place that they could accelerate and become a bigger problem. What\\'s lifting the Dow? Oil companies, energy shares. We are watching -- KOSIK: -- Mobile up 2 percent, Chevron shares up almost 2.5 percent -- QUEST: All right. KOSIK: -- those are some of the leaders on the Dow. Richard? QUEST: And JPMorgan, misery, mischief, and mayhem, and there\\'s still more to come, by all accounts. KOSIK: Ah, yes. More lawsuits. More lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, and these add up to a big possible penalty. \"The Financial Times\" is reporting that the US government wants JPMorgan to pay more than $6 billion to settle allegations that it misrepresented the securities that it sold to government-backed mortgage companies. And these are the bonds that were backed by sub-prime mortgages that the US government says didn\\'t meet investors\\' criteria. So, as borrowers couldn\\'t pay their mortgage bills, the value of these securities fell -- QUEST: Right. KOSIK: -- and on and on. So, of course, JPMorgan, Richard, saying we don\\'t want to pay it. A lot of it was -- QUEST: It\\'s a lot of money. It\\'s a lot of money, $6 billion. KOSIK: It is a lot of money, and it would be the biggest -- QUEST: Right. KOSIK: -- that JPMorgan -- the biggest penalty for JPMorgan Chase, yes. QUEST: Alison, thank you for that, Alison Kosik at the New York Stock Exchange. And of course what we are looking at with JPMorgan is a series of miseries. The possible penalty is just the latest setback as the regulators are really mounting an assault on the company from various different sites. If you look at the super screen, two former traders are accused of sweeping millions of dollars in trading losses under the carpet, allegedly filing false statements to them. So, we have, of course, the Whale scenario, that is one particular incident that JPMorgan is facing at the moment. There are criminal prosecutions, extradition proceedings. That\\'s the tempest in a teapot that suddenly became a rather nasty incident overall. We have what\\'s happening in China. Did JPMorgan -- did they give jobs to relatives of -- or internships, to be more precise -- to relatives of big companies and banks in China hoping to curry favor and win contracts? You\\'ve got the mortgage inquiries. Were they misselling of mortgage inquires? And you have the California markets issue and you have what we\\'re talking about at the moment. Now, Jamie Dimon always said that there would be a bevy of regulatory issues coming his way. Perhaps he never quite realized there\\'d be quite as many overall for the house that Morgan built. Coming up after the break, we have much more to talk about. She tells German voters that Greece should never have been allowed into the euro. Well, she might have been speaking the truth that dare not speak its name. QUEST: QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 20 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
