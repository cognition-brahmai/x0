        "content": "So John is buying apples, and they come in bags of 6. He decides to buy 3 bags. I need to figure out how many apples he has in total.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. He has 3 bags, each containing 6 apples. So, to find the total number of apples, I need to multiply the number of bags by the number of apples per bag.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal apples = number of bags \u00d7 number of apples per bag\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal apples = 3 \u00d7 6\n\nNow, 3 multiplied by 6 is 18.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to think about this to make sure I'm correct?\n\nMaybe I can add the apples instead of multiplying. Since each bag has 6 apples, and he has 3 bags, I can add 6 three times:\n\n6 + 6 + 6\n\nThat equals 18 as well.\n\nOkay, so both methods give me the same answer, which is good. It confirms that the total number of apples John has is 18.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other factor that might affect the total number of apples. For example, is there a possibility that the bags don't contain exactly 6 apples each? The problem says \"bags of 6,\" so I assume each bag has exactly 6 apples.\n\nAlso, it doesn't mention any apples being removed or added beyond what's in the bags. So, no need to account for any additional apples.\n\nTherefore, the total number of apples John has is indeed 18.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The problem is straightforward, and the calculation is simple multiplication or addition, both leading to the same conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
