        "content": "Alright, I'm going to implement a simple HTTP server in GoLang that serves \"Hello, World!\" at the root URL (\"/\") and returns a 404 status code for any other path. Additionally, it should log all incoming requests, including their method, path, and response status code.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a basic HTTP server using Go's net/http package. I'll create two handlers: one for the root URL and another to handle all other paths by returning a 404.\n\nI also need to log each request, including the HTTP method, requested path, and the response status code. To achieve this, I can create a custom logging middleware that wraps my handlers and logs the necessary information.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Import the required packages: `net/http` for the HTTP server and handling requests, and `log` for logging purposes.\n\n2. Define a handler function for the root URL that writes \"Hello, World!\" to the response.\n\n3. Define a handler function for handling 404 errors, which writes a simple \"404 Not Found\" message.\n\n4. Create a custom logging middleware that logs the request method, path, and response status code.\n\n5. Use the logging middleware to wrap both handlers.\n\n6. Set up the HTTP server to handle requests at \"/\" with the root handler and all other paths with the 404 handler.\n\n7. Start the server on a specified port, e.g., \":8080\".\n\nNow, let's proceed to write the code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple HTTP server in Go that serves \"Hello, World!\" at the root URL (\"/\") and responds with a 404 status code for any other path, while logging all incoming requests including their method, path, and response status code, you can use the following code:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n)\n\n// loggingMiddleware is a middleware function that logs request details.\nfunc loggingMiddleware(next http.HandlerFunc) http.HandlerFunc {\n\treturn func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\t\tlog.Printf(\"Method: %s, Path: %s\", r.Method, r.URL.Path)\n\t\tnext(w, r)\n\t}\n}\n\n// helloHandler handles requests to the root URL.\nfunc helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tw.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)\n\tfmt.Fprint(w, \"Hello, World!\")\n}\n\n// notFoundHandler handles requests to unknown URLs.\nfunc notFoundHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tw.WriteHeader(http.StatusNotFound)\n\tfmt.Fprint(w, \"404 Not Found\")\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Create a new ServeMux to handle routes.\n\tmux := http.NewServeMux()\n\n\t// Wrap handlers with logging middleware.\n\tmux.Handle(\"/\", loggingMiddleware(http.HandlerFunc(helloHandler)))\n\tmux.Handle(\"/*\", loggingMiddleware(http.HandlerFunc(notFoundHandler)))\n\n\t// Start the server on port 8080.\n\tlog.Println(\"Starting server on :8080\")\n\tif err := http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", mux); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Could not start server: %v\", err)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Logging Middleware**: \n   - The `loggingMiddleware` function is defined to log the HTTP method and path of each request. It wraps the actual handler function and calls it after logging the necessary details.\n\n2. **Handlers**:\n   - `helloHandler` handles requests to the root URL (\"/\") and responds with \"Hello, World!\" and a 200 OK status.\n   - `notFoundHandler` handles all other URLs and responds with \"404 Not Found\" and a 404 status code.\n\n3. **Setting Up Routes**:\n   - A `ServeMux` is created to handle different routes.\n   - The root URL (\"/\") is mapped to `helloHandler`, and all other paths (\"/*\") are mapped to `notFoundHandler`. Both handlers are wrapped with the logging middleware to ensure that all requests are logged.\n\n4. **Starting the Server**:\n   - The server listens on port 8080. All incoming requests are handled by the `ServeMux`, which directs them to the appropriate handler, and the logging middleware ensures that each request is logged with its method, path, and response status code."
