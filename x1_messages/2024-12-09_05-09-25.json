        "content": "Let's see. The company has 150 employees and needs to transport them to an amusement park. They've allocated $5,000 for transportation, and each bus costs $300 per day and can hold up to 50 people. I need to figure out how many buses to rent and make sure they don't exceed their budget.\n\nFirst, I should determine how many buses are needed based on the number of employees. If each bus holds 50 people, then 150 divided by 50 is 3. So, they need 3 buses to transport all employees.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost. Each bus costs $300 per day, and they need 3 buses, so 3 times $300 is $900.\n\nNow, check if $900 is within the $5,000 budget. Well, $900 is less than $5,000, so yes, they stay well within their budget.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any additional costs, like drivers or extra fees, but the problem doesn't mention any extra costs, so I'll assume that the $300 per bus per day covers everything.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there's a possibility of getting a discount for renting multiple buses, but again, the problem doesn't mention any discounts, so I'll proceed with the given rates.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether all buses need to be rented for the same number of days. The problem says \"per day,\" so perhaps the event is for one day. If it's for multiple days, the cost would increase accordingly, but since it's a one-day event, I'll assume it's for one day.\n\nSo, in summary, the company needs to rent 3 buses at $300 each, totaling $900, which is well within their $5,000 transportation budget.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if renting fewer buses would be possible by opting for larger buses or other transportation options, but the problem specifies buses that hold 50 people each, so there doesn't seem to be an alternative provided.\n\nAlso, perhaps considering the environment or employee comfort, they might want to rent more buses to have fewer people per bus, but again, the problem doesn't mention any constraints or preferences beyond the basic requirements.\n\nGiven that, I think the straightforward approach is the best: rent 3 buses at $300 each, totaling $900, which is well within the $5,000 budget.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
