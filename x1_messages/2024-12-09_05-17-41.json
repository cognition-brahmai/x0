        "content": "Sure! Let's classify these ocean creatures based on their primary habitats.\n\n1. **Anglerfish**: These are primarily deep-sea dwellers. They are known for their unique method of predation, using a bioluminescent lure to attract prey in the dark depths of the ocean.\n\n2. **Clownfish**: Clownfish are typically found in coral reefs. They have a symbiotic relationship with sea anemones, which provide them protection from predators.\n\n3. **Great White Shark**: Great white sharks are known to inhabit various marine environments but are most commonly associated with the open ocean. They are apex predators and can be found in coastal waters as well as farther out at sea.\n\n4. **Giant Squid**: Giant squids are deep-sea creatures. They live in the ocean's twilight zone, where light is minimal, and are known for their massive size and elusive nature.\n\n5. **Green Sea Turtle**: Green sea turtles are primarily found in coastal waters and around coral reefs. They are herbivorous and feed mainly on seagrasses and algae.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- **Deep Sea**: Anglerfish, Giant Squid\n\n- **Coral Reefs**: Clownfish, Green Sea Turtle\n\n- **Open Ocean**: Great White Shark\n\nI hope this helps!"
