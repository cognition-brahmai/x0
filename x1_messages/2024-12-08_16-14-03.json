        "content": "Let's see, I've got this riddle here. It says: \"They can be harbored, but few hold water. You can nurse them, but only by holding them against someone else. You can carry them, but not with your arms. You can bury them, but not in the earth.\"\n\nAlright, so first part: \"They can be harbored, but few hold water.\" Hmm, harboring something usually means protecting or sheltering it. But \"few hold water\" might mean that most don't have the ability to contain water, or perhaps it's a metaphor for not being substantial or having merit. But maybe it's literal.\n\nNext: \"You can nurse them, but only by holding them against someone else.\" Nursing implies caring for something, perhaps like caring for a child or a patient. But here, it says you have to hold them against someone else. That sounds a bit confusing. Maybe it means that nursing these things requires the involvement of another person.\n\nThen: \"You can carry them, but not with your arms.\" So, there's a way to carry them without using your arms. Maybe using other parts of your body, or perhaps using vehicles or containers.\n\nLastly: \"You can bury them, but not in the earth.\" Burying typically means placing something in the ground and covering it with soil. But here, it's saying not in the earth, so maybe it's burying in a different context, like hiding or concealing in another way.\n\nLet me try to think of something that fits all these clues.\n\nFirst, harboring them but few hold water. Maybe they're containers that don't usually hold water, like certain types of vessels or objects.\n\nBut the nursing part is tricky. Nursing them by holding against someone else suggests that the act of caring for them involves another person.\n\nCarrying them without arms could mean carrying them on your back, head, or using carts or other means.\n\nBurying them not in the earth might mean hiding them in a different manner, like burying them in snow or sand, or perhaps covering them up in a figurative sense.\n\nWait, maybe it's something abstract, not physical. Maybe it's emotions or ideas.\n\nLet's consider emotions. You can harbor emotions, but few hold water might mean that emotions aren't tangible like water. You can nurse emotions by sharing them with someone else, holding them close in a metaphorical sense. You can carry emotions without using your arms, as they are internal. And you can bury emotions, meaning suppress or hide them, not literally in the earth.\n\nThat seems promising. But let's see if there's a more specific answer.\n\nAnother possibility is thoughts or ideas. You can harbor ideas, few hold water meaning they may not be viable or make sense. Nursing ideas by discussing them with others, holding them against someone else could mean sharing them in conversation. Carrying ideas without arms, as they are mental. Burying ideas means ignoring or dismissing them, not putting them into action.\n\nBut perhaps it's something more concrete.\n\nLet's think about physical objects. Maybe it's something like fires. You can harbor a fire, but it doesn't hold water; in fact, water extinguishes it. Nursing a fire by holding it against someone else? That doesn't make much sense. Carrying a fire not with your arms, perhaps using a torch or a carrier. Burying a fire means putting it out, not burying it in the earth but extinguishing it in some other way.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nWhat about shadows? You can harbor shadows, they don't hold water. Nursing shadows by holding them against someone else? That seems too abstract. Carrying shadows without arms, as they follow your movements. Burying shadows, perhaps by bringing light into dark areas.\n\nMaybe that's a stretch.\n\nHow about debts or obligations? You can harbor debts, few hold water, meaning they are burdensome. Nursing debts by holding them against someone else, like transferring responsibility. Carrying debts without arms, as they are financial or legal burdens. Burying debts, perhaps by forgiving or paying them off, not burying them in the earth.\n\nThat could work.\n\nAnother thought: maybe it's secrets. You can harbor secrets, few hold water, meaning they don't reveal their true nature. Nursing secrets by sharing them with someone else, holding them close. Carrying secrets without arms, as they are mental burdens. Burying secrets means revealing them or letting them go.\n\nThat seems similar to emotions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's something related to technology or modern concepts.\n\nLet's consider data or information. You can harbor data, but it doesn't hold water in the literal sense. Nursing data by sharing it with someone else, holding it against them perhaps in the sense of using it to influence or inform. Carrying data without arms, as it's digital and can be transported without physical effort. Burying data means deleting or hiding it, not burying it in the earth.\n\nThat could be a possible answer.\n\nBut maybe it's something more straightforward.\n\nLet's consider seeds. You can harbor seeds, and some hold water in the sense of retaining moisture, but few might not. Nursing seeds by planting them and caring for them, which involves holding them against the earth. Carrying seeds without arms, perhaps in containers or packets. Burying seeds not in the earth, but storing them elsewhere.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's something entirely different.\n\nLet's think about diseases or illnesses. You can harbor diseases, few hold water, perhaps meaning that they don't benefit from water therapy or something. Nursing illnesses by holding the patient against you, caring for them. Carrying illnesses without arms, as they are internal and can be spread without physical contact. Burying illnesses by curing them or hiding their existence.\n\nThat could be another interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's something positive, like hopes or dreams. You can harbor hopes, few hold water, meaning they are intangible. Nursing hopes by sharing them with others, holding them close to your heart or against someone else in a supportive way. Carrying hopes without arms, as they are internal desires. Burying hopes means giving up on them or dismissing them, not burying them in the earth.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAnother angle: maybe it's something related to writing or stories. You can harbor stories, few hold water, meaning they may not be factual. Nursing stories by sharing them with others, holding them against someone else in conversation. Carrying stories without arms, as they are oral or written. Burying stories means forgetting them or not passing them on.\n\nInteresting.\n\nWait, perhaps it's something more specific, like seeds again, but thinking differently. Maybe it's seeds of plants that don't need to be planted in the earth, like aquatic plants that can float on water.\n\nBut that might not fit all the clues.\n\nLet me try to think of a single word that could satisfy all these conditions.\n\nThey can be harbored, but few hold water. You can nurse them by holding them against someone else. You can carry them without arms. You can bury them not in the earth.\n\nAfter considering various options, I'm going to take a guess that the answer is \"secrets.\"\n\nYou can harbor secrets, and few hold water, meaning they don't reveal their true nature. Nursing secrets by sharing them with someone else, holding them close in confidence. Carrying secrets without arms, as they are mental burdens. Burying secrets means revealing them or letting them go, not burying them in the earth.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{secrets}} \\]"
