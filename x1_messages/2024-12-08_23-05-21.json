        "content": "To evaluate the improper integral from 1 to infinity of \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) dx, we need to handle it carefully because the upper limit is infinity. Improper integrals are integrals that have infinite limits or integrands that approach infinity at some point within the interval of integration.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the integral from 1 to infinity of \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) dx is defined as the limit as t approaches infinity of the integral from 1 to t of \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) dx. Mathematically, this is written as:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x^2} \\, dx = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\int_{1}^{t} \\frac{1}{x^2} \\, dx\n\\]\n\nSo, our first step is to compute the definite integral from 1 to t of \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) dx, and then take the limit as t approaches infinity.\n\nLet's compute the definite integral from 1 to t of \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) dx.\n\nWe know that the antiderivative of \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) is \\( -\\frac{1}{x} \\), because:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} \\, dx = \\int x^{-2} \\, dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x} + C\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the definite integral from 1 to t is:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{1}^{t} \\frac{1}{x^2} \\, dx = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{x} \\right]_{1}^{t} = -\\frac{1}{t} - \\left( -\\frac{1}{1} \\right) = -\\frac{1}{t} + 1\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to take the limit as t approaches infinity of this expression:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left( -\\frac{1}{t} + 1 \\right)\n\\]\n\nAs t approaches infinity, \\( \\frac{1}{t} \\) approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left( -\\frac{1}{t} + 1 \\right) = 0 + 1 = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the value of the improper integral from 1 to infinity of \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) dx is 1.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I seem to recall that the integral of \\( \\frac{1}{x^p} \\) from 1 to infinity converges for p > 1 and diverges for p \u2264 1. In this case, p = 2, which is greater than 1, so it should indeed converge, and I've calculated it to be 1.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about the general formula for the integral of \\( \\frac{1}{x^p} \\) from 1 to infinity:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x^p} \\, dx = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\int_{1}^{t} x^{-p} \\, dx = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\frac{x^{1-p}}{1-p} \\right]_{1}^{t} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{t^{1-p}}{1-p} - \\frac{1^{1-p}}{1-p} \\right)\n\\]\n\nFor p > 1, 1 - p < 0, so \\( t^{1-p} \\) approaches 0 as t approaches infinity. Therefore, the integral converges to:\n\n\\[\n0 - \\frac{1}{1-p} = -\\frac{1}{1-p} = \\frac{1}{p-1}\n\\]\n\nIn our specific case, p = 2, so:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x^2} \\, dx = \\frac{1}{2-1} = 1\n\\]\n\nThis matches the result I obtained earlier. So, the integral converges to 1.\n\nBut let's consider another approach to confirm this result. We can use the concept of p-integrals. A p-integral is of the form \\( \\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x^p} \\, dx \\), and it converges if p > 1 and diverges if p \u2264 1. Since p = 2 in our case, it converges, and the value is \\( \\frac{1}{p-1} = 1 \\), which again confirms our result.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about the area under the curve \\( y = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) from x = 1 to x = \u221e. As x increases, the function decreases rapidly, and the total area under the curve turns out to be finite, specifically 1.\n\nLet me also consider the comparison test for improper integrals. Since \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) is positive and decreasing for x \u2265 1, and we know that \\( \\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x^2} \\, dx \\) converges to 1, we can use this as a benchmark for other integrals.\n\nFor example, if we have another function that is less than \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) for large x, and its integral from 1 to infinity converges, then by the comparison test, our integral also converges. But in this case, we're directly evaluating the integral, so the comparison test is not necessary.\n\nAnother way to look at this is to consider the p-series for integrals. Just like the p-series for sums, where \\( \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^p} \\) converges for p > 1, the integral \\( \\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x^p} \\, dx \\) also converges for p > 1. Again, this supports our conclusion.\n\nLet me also consider a substitution to see if I get the same result. Let's set u = 1/x, so du/dx = -1/x^2, which means du = -1/x^2 dx. When x = 1, u = 1; when x = t, u = 1/t.\n\nRewriting the integral in terms of u:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{1}^{t} \\frac{1}{x^2} \\, dx = -\\int_{1}^{1/t} du = -\\left[ u \\right]_{1}^{1/t} = -\\left( \\frac{1}{t} - 1 \\right) = -\\frac{1}{t} + 1\n\\]\n\nTaking the limit as t approaches infinity:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left( -\\frac{1}{t} + 1 \\right) = 0 + 1 = 1\n\\]\n\nAgain, we arrive at the same result.\n\nFurthermore, we can consider the improper integral from a to infinity of \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) dx, where a > 0. Using the same method, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{a}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x^2} \\, dx = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\int_{a}^{t} \\frac{1}{x^2} \\, dx = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{x} \\right]_{a}^{t} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left( -\\frac{1}{t} + \\frac{1}{a} \\right) = 0 + \\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{1}{a}\n\\]\n\nIn our specific case, a = 1, so the integral is 1, which confirms our previous results.\n\nLet me also consider the graphical interpretation. The function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) is positive, continuous, and decreasing for x \u2265 1. The area under the curve from x = 1 to x = \u221e is finite, and we've calculated it to be 1.\n\nTo visualize this, imagine plotting \\( y = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) from x = 1 to x = \u221e. As x increases, the curve approaches the x-axis, and the area under the curve forms a finite region.\n\nMoreover, this integral is related to the concept of the Basel problem, which involves the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the natural numbers. However, that's a different topic.\n\nIn conclusion, after evaluating the improper integral from 1 to infinity of \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) dx using multiple methods and approaches, we find that it converges to 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]\n"
