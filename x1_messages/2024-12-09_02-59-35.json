        "content": "So there are 100 houses in total, and the first one is blue. Then, every third house after that is also blue. So, starting from the first house, which is blue, then the fourth house is blue, then the seventh, and so on.\n\nTo find out how many blue houses there are, I need to figure out how many houses are blue in this pattern.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, house number 1 is blue.\n\nThen, house number 1 + 3 = 4 is blue.\n\nNext, house number 4 + 3 = 7 is blue.\n\nThen, house number 7 + 3 = 10 is blue.\n\nI can see a pattern here. The blue houses are every 3 houses after the first one.\n\nSo, the sequence of blue houses is 1, 4, 7, 10, and so on, up to the 100th house.\n\nThis seems like an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 is 1, and the common difference d is 3.\n\nTo find the number of terms n in this sequence that are less than or equal to 100, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\nan = a1 + (n - 1) * d\n\nI need to find the largest n such that an \u2264 100.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n1 + (n - 1) * 3 \u2264 100\n\nLet me solve for n:\n\n(n - 1) * 3 \u2264 99\n\nBecause 1 + (n - 1) * 3 \u2264 100 \u2192 (n - 1) * 3 \u2264 99\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\n\nn - 1 \u2264 33\n\nSo, n \u2264 34\n\nTherefore, there are 34 blue houses in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIf n = 34, then an = 1 + (34 - 1) * 3 = 1 + 33 * 3 = 1 + 99 = 100\n\nSo, house number 100 is also blue.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of houses that are congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nThat is, houses where the house number modulo 3 equals 1.\n\nBecause:\n\n1 mod 3 = 1\n\n4 mod 3 = 1\n\n7 mod 3 = 1\n\n10 mod 3 = 1\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the number of houses where n mod 3 = 1, for n from 1 to 100.\n\nTo find how many numbers between 1 and 100 are congruent to 1 mod 3.\n\nThe sequence is 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., 100.\n\nThe difference between consecutive terms is 3, as before.\n\nSo, using the arithmetic sequence formula is correct.\n\nFirst term a1 = 1\n\nCommon difference d = 3\n\nLast term an = 100\n\nAn = a1 + (n - 1) * d\n\n100 = 1 + (n - 1) * 3\n\n99 = (n - 1) * 3\n\nn - 1 = 33\n\nn = 34\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 3, but since we're starting from 1 and adding 3 each time, it's better to use the arithmetic sequence approach.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the positions of the blue houses.\n\nHouse 1 is blue.\n\nThen every third house after that is blue.\n\nSo, house 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., up to house 100.\n\nTo find how many terms are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that the sequence is 1 + 3k, where k is an integer starting from 0.\n\nSo, for k = 0, house 1\n\nk = 1, house 4\n\nk = 2, house 7\n\n...\n\nk = n - 1, house 1 + 3(n - 1)\n\nSet this equal to 100:\n\n1 + 3(n - 1) = 100\n\nSolve for n:\n\n3(n - 1) = 99\n\nn - 1 = 33\n\nn = 34\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see what happens if I try to count the number of houses where (house number - 1) is divisible by 3.\n\nThat is, house numbers n where n - 1 is divisible by 3, or n \u2261 1 mod 3.\n\nFrom 1 to 100, how many n satisfy n \u2261 1 mod 3?\n\nWell, the first n is 1, and the last n is 100.\n\nThe number of terms in this sequence is floor((100 - 1)/3) + 1 = floor(99/3) + 1 = 33 + 1 = 34\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I get 34 blue houses.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{34} \\]"
