        "content": "I'm here to help you with your question. However, there seems to be some confusion in the statement you provided. Martin Luther King Jr. was actually a prominent figure in the Civil Rights Movement, not the Women's Suffrage Movement. He was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee, while supporting sanitation workers who were striking for better treatment and pay.\n\nLet me provide you with accurate information. Martin Luther King Jr. was an American Baptist minister and activist who became the most visible spokesperson and leader in the civil rights movement from 1954 until his death in 1968. He is best known for his role in the advancement of civil rights using nonviolent civil disobedience based on his Christian beliefs.\n\nKing participated in and led a number of peaceful protests, marches, and campaigns to end racial segregation and discrimination. His most famous speeches include the \"I Have a Dream\" speech, delivered during the 1963 March on Washington, and the \"Letter from Birmingham Jail,\" written in 1963.\n\nTragically, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee, where he had gone to support striking sanitation workers. His assassination led to widespread riots in many U.S. cities and intensified the already existing civil rights movement.\n\nIt's important to have accurate information about historical figures and events to understand their significance and impact properly. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.\n\n**References:**\n\n- [Martin Luther King Jr.](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/martin-luther-king-jr)\n\n- [Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/martin-luther-king-jr-assassination)\n\nENDINPUT"
