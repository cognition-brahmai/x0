It was all very well for an Englishman like Mr. Fogg to make the tour of the world with a carpet-bag; a lady could not be expected to travel comfortably under such conditions. He acquitted his task with characteristic serenity, and invariably replied to the remonstrances of his fair companion, who was confused by his patience and generosity:\n\"It is in the interest of my journey--a part of my programme.\"\nThe purchases made, they returned to the hotel, where they dined at a sumptuously served table-d'hote; after which Aouda, shaking hands with her protector after the English fashion, retired to her room for rest. Mr. Fogg absorbed himself throughout the evening in the perusal of The Times and Illustrated London News.\nHad he been capable of being astonished at anything, it would have been not to see his servant return at bedtime. But, knowing that the steamer was not to leave for Yokohama until the next morning, he did not disturb himself about the matter. When Passepartout did not appear the next morning to answer his master's bell, Mr. Fogg, not betraying the least vexation, contented himself with taking his carpet-bag, calling Aouda, and sending for a palanquin.\nIt was then eight o'clock; at half-past nine, it being then high tide, the Carnatic would leave the harbour. Mr. Fogg and Aouda got into the palanquin, their luggage being brought after on a wheelbarrow, and half an hour later stepped upon the quay whence they were to embark. Mr. Fogg then learned that the Carnatic had sailed the evening before. He had expected to find not only the steamer, but his domestic, and was forced to give up both; but no sign of disappointment appeared on his face, and he merely remarked to Aouda, \"It is an accident, madam; nothing more.\"\nAt this moment a man who had been observing him attentively approached. It was Fix, who, bowing, addressed Mr. Fogg: \"Were you not, like me, sir, a passenger by the Rangoon, which arrived yesterday?\"\n\"I was, sir,\" replied Mr. Fogg coldly. \"But I have not the honour--\"\n\"Pardon me; I thought I should find your servant here.\"\n\"Do you know where he is, sir?\" asked Aouda anxiously.\n\"What!\" responded Fix, feigning surprise. \"Is he not with you?\"\n\"No,\" said Aouda. \"He has not made his appearance since yesterday. Could he have gone on board the Carnatic without us?\"\n\"Without you, madam?\" answered the detective. \"Excuse me, did you intend to sail in the Carnatic?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"So did I, madam, and I am excessively disappointed. The Carnatic, its repairs being completed, left Hong Kong twelve hours before the stated time, without any notice being given; and we must now wait a week for another steamer.\"\nAs he said \"a week\" Fix felt his heart leap for joy. Fogg detained at Hong Kong for a week! There would be time for the warrant to arrive, and fortune at last favoured the representative of the law. His horror may be imagined when he heard Mr. Fogg say, in his placid voice, \"But there are other vessels besides the Carnatic, it seems to me, in the harbour of Hong Kong.\"\nAnd, offering his arm to Aouda, he directed his steps toward the docks in search of some craft about to start. Fix, stupefied, followed; it seemed as if he were attached to Mr. Fogg by an invisible thread. Chance, however, appeared really to have abandoned the man it had hitherto served so well. For three hours Phileas Fogg wandered about the docks, with the determination, if necessary, to charter a vessel to carry him to Yokohama; but he could only find vessels which were loading or unloading, and which could not therefore set sail. Fix began to hope again.\nBut Mr. Fogg, far from being discouraged, was continuing his search, resolved not to stop if he had to resort to Macao, when he was accosted by a sailor on one of the wharves.\n\"Is your honour looking for a boat?\"\n\"Have you a boat ready to sail?\"\n\"Yes, your honour; a pilot-boat--No. 43--the best in the harbour.\"\n\"Does she go fast?\"\n\"Between eight and nine knots the hour. Will you look at her?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Your honour will be satisfied with her. Is it for a sea excursion?\"\n\"No; for a voyage.\"\n\"A voyage?\"\n\"Yes, will you agree to take me to Yokohama?\"\nThe sailor leaned on the railing, opened his eyes wide, and said, \"Is your honour joking?\"\n\"No. I have missed the Carnatic, and I must get to Yokohama by the 14th at the latest, to take the boat for San Francisco.\"\n\"I am sorry,\" said the sailor; \"but it is impossible.\"\n\"I offer you a hundred pounds per day, and an additional reward of two hundred pounds if I reach Yokohama in time.\"\n\"Are you in earnest?\"\n\"Very much so.\"\nThe pilot walked away a little distance, and gazed out to sea, evidently struggling between the anxiety to gain a large sum and the fear of venturing so far. Fix was in mortal suspense.\nMr. Fogg turned to Aouda and asked her, \"You would not be afraid, would you, madam?\"\n\"Not with you, Mr. Fogg,\" was her answer.\nThe pilot now returned, shuffling his hat in his hands.\n\"Well, pilot?\" said Mr. Fogg.\n\"Well, your honour,\" replied he, \"I could not risk myself, my men, or my little boat of scarcely twenty tons on so long a voyage at this time of year. Besides, we could not reach Yokohama in time, for it is sixteen hundred and sixty miles from Hong Kong.\"\n\"Only sixteen hundred,\" said Mr. Fogg.\n\"It's the same thing.\"\nFix breathed more freely.\n\"But,\" added the pilot, \"it might be arranged another way.\"\nFix ceased to breathe at all.\n\"How?\" asked Mr. Fogg.\n\"By going to Nagasaki, at the extreme south of Japan, or even to Shanghai, which is only eight hundred miles from here. In going to Shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the Chinese coast, which would be a great advantage, as the currents run northward, and would aid us.\"\n\"Pilot,\" said Mr. Fogg, \"I must take the American steamer at Yokohama, and not at Shanghai or Nagasaki.\"\n\"Why not?\" returned the pilot. \"The San Francisco steamer does not start from Yokohama. It puts in at Yokohama and Nagasaki, but it starts from Shanghai.\"\n\"You are sure of that?\"\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\"And when does the boat leave Shanghai?\"\n\"On the 11th, at seven in the evening. We have, therefore, four days before us, that is ninety-six hours; and in that time, if we had good luck and a south-west wind, and the sea was calm, we could make those eight hundred miles to Shanghai.\"\n\"And you could go--\"\n\"In an hour; as soon as provisions could be got aboard and the sails put up.\"\n\"It is a bargain. Are you the master of the boat?\"\n\"Yes; John Bunsby, master of the Tankadere.\"\n\"Would you like some earnest-money?\"\n\"If it would not put your honour out--\"\n\"Here are two hundred pounds on account sir,\" added Phileas Fogg, turning to Fix, \"if you would like to take advantage--\"\n\"Thanks, sir; I was about to ask the favour.\"\n\"Very well. In half an hour we shall go on board.\"\n\"But poor Passepartout?\" urged Aouda, who was much disturbed by the servant's disappearance.\n\"I shall do all I can to find him,\" replied Phileas Fogg.\nWhile Fix, in a feverish, nervous state, repaired to the pilot-boat, the others directed their course to the police-station at Hong Kong. Phileas Fogg there gave Passepartout's description, and left a sum of money to be spent in the search for him. The same formalities having been gone through at the French consulate, and the palanquin having stopped at the hotel for the luggage, which had been sent back there, they returned to the wharf.\nIt was now three o'clock; and pilot-boat No. 43, with its crew on board, and its provisions stored away, was ready for departure.\nThe Tankadere was a neat little craft of twenty tons, as gracefully built as if she were a racing yacht. Her shining copper sheathing, her galvanised iron-work, her deck, white as ivory, betrayed the pride taken by John Bunsby in making her presentable. Her two masts leaned a trifle backward; she carried brigantine, foresail, storm-jib, and standing-jib, and was well rigged for running before the wind; and she seemed capable of brisk speed, which, indeed, she had already proved by gaining several prizes in pilot-boat races. The crew of the Tankadere was composed of John Bunsby, the master, and four hardy mariners, who were familiar with the Chinese seas. John Bunsby, himself, a man of forty-five or thereabouts, vigorous, sunburnt, with a sprightly expression of the eye, and energetic and self-reliant countenance, would have inspired confidence in the most timid.\nPhileas Fogg and Aouda went on board, where they found Fix already installed. Below deck was a square cabin, of which the walls bulged out in the form of cots, above a circular divan; in the centre was a table provided with a swinging lamp. The accommodation was confined, but neat.\n\"I am sorry to have nothing better to offer you,\" said Mr. Fogg to Fix, who bowed without responding.\nThe detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profiting by the kindness of Mr. Fogg.\n\"It's certain,\" thought he, \"though rascal as he is, he is a polite one!\"\nThe sails and the English flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three. Mr. Fogg and Aouda, who were seated on deck, cast a last glance at the quay, in the hope of espying Passepartout. Fix was not without his fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant, whom he had so badly treated, in this direction; in which case an explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detective must have ensued. But the Frenchman did not appear, and, without doubt, was still lying under the stupefying influence of the opium.\nJohn Bunsby, master, at length gave the order to start, and the Tankadere, taking the wind under her brigantine, foresail, and standing-jib, bounded briskly forward over the waves.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 390 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"

Fogg, ever the epitome of serenity and efficiency, insisted that all their preparations were part of his well-orchestrated plan for circumnavigating the globe.\n\nUpon returning to their hotel, they dined sumptuously before retiring for the evening. Fogg, immersed in reading the latest news from The Times and Illustrated London News, showed no concern about Passepartout's absence. Even when the servant failed to appear the next morning, Fogg displayed no disturbance, attributing it to an accident and proceeding with their plans to catch the steamer Carnatic to Yokohama.\n\nArriving at the quay, they discovered that the Carnatic had unexpectedly sailed the previous evening, leaving them both surprised and inconvenienced. However, Fogg's composure remained unshaken as he calmly remarked that it was merely an accident and nothing more. It was then that Fix, the detective who suspected Fogg of being a bank robber, approached them, feigning acquaintance from their voyage on the Rangoon.\n\nFix, upon learning that Passepartout was missing, feigned concern and claimed to have thought the servant was with them. This interaction heightened Fix's hopes, as he believed that Fogg's delay in Hong Kong would give him time for a warrant to arrive, solidifying his case against Fogg. However, his optimism was short-lived when Fogg announced his intention to find another vessel to Yokohama, undeterred by the Carnatic's departure.\n\nAfter hours of searching the docks without success, Fogg was about to consider chartering a vessel when he was approached by a sailor offering the use of a pilot boat, number 43, known for its speed and reliability. Fogg saw this as a potential solution to reach Yokohama in time for the next leg of his journey. He proposed a generous payment of a hundred pounds per day, plus an additional two hundred pounds if they arrived in time, which piqued the sailor's interest despite the risks involved in such a long voyage at that time of year.\n\nAouda expressed her willingness to undertake the journey with Fogg, assuring him that she felt safe in his company. The pilot, John Bunsby, after some hesitation, agreed to the terms, and Fogg also extended an invitation to Fix, who eagerly accepted, seeing this as another opportunity to keep an eye on his suspect.\n\nBefore embarking, Fogg made arrangements to search for Passepartout, leaving money at the police station and the French consulate to aid in the search. He and Aouda returned to the wharf, where the Tankadere, their pilot boat, was prepared for departure. The boat was a sleek, twenty-ton vessel, well-maintained and rigged for speed, with Bunsby and his experienced crew ready to set sail.\n\nAs they boarded the Tankadere, Fogg and Aouda cast one last look towards the quay, hoping to spot Passepartout, but he was nowhere to be seen, likely still under the effects of opium. With the sails hoisted and the English flag flying, the Tankadere set off at three o'clock, navigating briskly towards their new destination, Shanghai, with Fix onboard, continuing his vigil over Fogg.\n\n**Summary Word Count:** 390"
