        "content": "So I need to calculate the probability of drawing a red card from a standard deck of playing cards. A standard deck has 52 cards in total. I know that playing cards are divided into four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. I think hearts and diamonds are red, and clubs and spades are black. So, first, I need to figure out how many red cards there are.\n\nLet me see, there are 13 cards in each suit: ace through 10, and then jack, queen, and king. So, for hearts and diamonds, that's 13 cards each. So, 13 plus 13 equals 26 red cards in total.\n\nNow, probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are drawing a red card, which is 26, and the total possible outcomes are drawing any card from the deck, which is 52.\n\nSo, the probability P of drawing a red card is P = 26/52.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2, which gives me 13/26, and again by 13, which gives me 1/2.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/2, which is 0.5, or 50%.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check. There are four suits, two red and two black, each with 13 cards. So, red cards are two suits out of four, which is indeed half the deck. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as there are two colors, red and black, with an equal number of cards in each color. So, the probability of drawing a red card should be 1/2.\n\nHmm, but maybe I should consider if the deck has any jokers or extra cards, but in a standard deck, there are 52 cards without jokers.\n\nAlso, assuming the deck is well-shuffled, each card has an equal chance of being drawn.\n\nSo, yes, I think the probability is indeed 50%.\n\nLet me write it down step by step:\n\n1. Total number of cards in a standard deck: 52.\n\n2. Number of red suits: 2 (hearts and diamonds).\n\n3. Number of cards per suit: 13.\n\n4. Total red cards: 2 suits * 13 cards/suit = 26 cards.\n\n5. Probability P = (number of red cards) / (total number of cards) = 26/52 = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/2 or 50%.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
