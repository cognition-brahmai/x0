        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a bat and a ball that together cost $1.10. Additionally, the bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. We need to find out how much the ball costs.\n\nFirst, I need to assign variables to the unknowns. Let's let:\n\n- \\( b \\) be the cost of the ball in dollars.\n\n- Since the bat costs $1.00 more than the ball, the cost of the bat would be \\( b + 1.00 \\) dollars.\n\nNow, according to the problem, the total cost of the bat and the ball is $1.10. So, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ b + (b + 1.00) = 1.10 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n\\[ 2b + 1.00 = 1.10 \\]\n\nNext, I'll subtract 1.00 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ 2b = 0.10 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ b = 0.05 \\]\n\nSo, the ball costs $0.05, and the bat costs \\( 0.05 + 1.00 = 1.05 \\) dollars. Let's check if these add up to $1.10:\n\n\\[ 0.05 + 1.05 = 1.10 \\]\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that this is a classic trick question because many people intuitively think that if the bat costs $1.00 more than the ball, and together they cost $1.10, then the ball must cost $0.10 and the bat $1.10. But that can't be right because then the bat would cost $1.00 more than the ball only if the ball was $0.10, but in that case, the bat would cost $1.10, which is $1.00 more. However, the total would be $1.20, not $1.10. So, my initial calculation must be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this differently. Let's consider the difference in cost between the bat and the ball, which is $1.00. If I let the cost of the ball be \\( b \\), then the bat costs \\( b + 1.00 \\). The total cost is $1.10, so:\n\n\\[ b + (b + 1.00) = 1.10 \\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 2b + 1.00 = 1.10 \\]\n\nSubtracting 1.00 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 2b = 0.10 \\]\n\nDividing by 2:\n\n\\[ b = 0.05 \\]\n\nSo, the ball costs $0.05, and the bat costs $1.05. Adding them up gives $1.10, which matches the total given.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that the difference between the bat and the ball is $1.00, and together they cost $1.10. So, the total cost is the sum of the ball's cost and the bat's cost, which is the ball's cost plus $1.00 more.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. If I have two quantities, where one is $1.00 more than the other, and their sum is $1.10, what are the individual amounts?\n\nLet\u2019s denote the smaller amount (the ball's cost) as \\( b \\), then the larger amount (the bat's cost) is \\( b + 1.00 \\). Their sum is:\n\n\\[ b + (b + 1.00) = 1.10 \\]\n\nWhich again leads to:\n\n\\[ 2b + 1.00 = 1.10 \\]\n\nSubtracting 1.00 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 2b = 0.10 \\]\n\nDividing by 2:\n\n\\[ b = 0.05 \\]\n\nSo, the ball costs $0.05.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the percentage difference or something, but that might be overcomplicating it. The problem is straightforward in terms of algebra.\n\nLet me try plugging the value back into the original conditions to verify.\n\nIf the ball costs $0.05, then the bat costs $1.00 more, which is $1.05. Adding them together: $0.05 + $1.05 = $1.10, which matches the total cost given.\n\nAlternatively, if I assume the ball costs $0.10, then the bat would cost $1.10, and the total would be $1.20, which is more than $1.10. So, that can't be right.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the ball costs $0.05.\n\nI think the common mistake people make is assuming that if the bat costs $1.00 more than the ball, and together they cost $1.10, then the ball must cost $0.10. But as we saw, that leads to a total of $1.20, which doesn't match the given total. So, the intuition can be misleading in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, the ball costs $0.05, and the bat costs $1.05, totaling $1.10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.05} \\]"
