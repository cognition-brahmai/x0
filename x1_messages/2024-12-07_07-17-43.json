        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a box containing red and blue balls. There are 10 red balls, and we don't know the number of blue balls yet. We're told that if you pick two balls at once without replacement, the probability of getting one red and one blue ball is 1/2.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to pick two balls at once without replacement. I think it's similar to picking two balls randomly from the box without putting any back. The order doesn't matter here because we're just interested in the combination of colors.\n\nThe probability of getting one red and one blue ball is given as 1/2. So, I need to find out how many blue balls are in the box to make this happen.\n\nLet me denote the number of blue balls as B. The total number of balls in the box is then 10 (red) + B (blue).\n\nThe total number of ways to pick two balls from the box is the combination of (10 + B) balls taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 balls from (10 + B) balls is C(10 + B, 2).\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose one red ball and one blue ball is the product of the number of ways to choose one red ball and the number of ways to choose one blue ball. That would be C(10, 1) * C(B, 1).\n\nTherefore, the probability P of picking one red and one blue ball is:\n\nP = [C(10, 1) * C(B, 1)] / C(10 + B, 2)\n\nAnd we know that P = 1/2.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation:\n\n[C(10, 1) * C(B, 1)] / C(10 + B, 2) = 1/2\n\nNow, let's compute the combinations.\n\nC(10, 1) = 10\n\nC(B, 1) = B\n\nC(10 + B, 2) = [ (10 + B)(10 + B - 1) ] / 2 = [ (10 + B)(9 + B) ] / 2\n\nSo, plugging these back into the equation:\n\n(10 * B) / [ (10 + B)(9 + B) / 2 ] = 1/2\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n(10 * B) / [ (10 + B)(9 + B) / 2 ] = 1/2\n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate the fraction in the denominator:\n\n(10 * B * 2) / [ (10 + B)(9 + B) ] = 1/2\n\nSo:\n\n(20 * B) / [ (10 + B)(9 + B) ] = 1/2\n\nNow, cross-multiplying to solve for B:\n\n20B = (1/2) * (10 + B)(9 + B)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n40B = (10 + B)(9 + B)\n\nNow, expand the right side:\n\n40B = 10*9 + 10*B + B*9 + B*B\n\n40B = 90 + 10B + 9B + B^2\n\n40B = B^2 + 19B + 90\n\nBring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:\n\nB^2 + 19B + 90 - 40B = 0\n\nB^2 - 21B + 90 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation: B^2 - 21B + 90 = 0\n\nLet's solve for B using the quadratic formula:\n\nB = [21 \u00b1 sqrt(21^2 - 4*1*90)] / (2*1)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\nD = 21^2 - 4*1*90 = 441 - 360 = 81\n\nSo, B = [21 \u00b1 sqrt(81)] / 2 = [21 \u00b1 9] / 2\n\nTherefore, B = (21 + 9)/2 = 30/2 = 15 or B = (21 - 9)/2 = 12/2 = 6\n\nSo, there are two possible solutions: B = 15 or B = 6\n\nBut, we need to check which one makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\nLet's check B = 15:\n\nTotal balls = 10 red + 15 blue = 25 balls\n\nNumber of ways to pick one red and one blue = 10*15 = 150\n\nTotal number of ways to pick any two balls = C(25, 2) = (25*24)/2 = 300\n\nSo, probability = 150 / 300 = 1/2, which matches the given probability.\n\nNow, check B = 6:\n\nTotal balls = 10 red + 6 blue = 16 balls\n\nNumber of ways to pick one red and one blue = 10*6 = 60\n\nTotal number of ways to pick any two balls = C(16, 2) = (16*15)/2 = 120\n\nProbability = 60 / 120 = 1/2, which also matches.\n\nSo, both B = 15 and B = 6 satisfy the condition.\n\nWait a minute, the problem should have a unique solution. Maybe I need to see if both make sense or if there's a constraint I'm missing.\n\nLet's see, the problem says \"there are red balls and blue balls,\" without specifying that there are more red than blue or vice versa. So, both scenarios are possible.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to determine which one is the correct answer based on additional constraints or context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects only one solution, and I need to find out which one is correct.\n\nLet me see if there's any other information I can use.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem implies that the number of blue balls is different from the number of red balls. But in both cases, B is different from 10 (B=15 and B=6), so that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that there are more blue balls than red balls, but in one case B=15 >10, and in the other B=6 <10.\n\nWithout further context, both solutions seem valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the smaller number of blue balls, but again, without specification, both are possible.\n\nGiven that both solutions satisfy the equation and the problem doesn't provide additional constraints, I think both are mathematically valid solutions.\n\nSo, the number of blue balls could be either 6 or 15.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to determine which one is the intended answer.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is designed such that there is only one solution, and I've made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting from:\n\nP = [C(10,1) * C(B,1)] / C(10+B,2) = 1/2\n\nWhich led to:\n\nB^2 - 21B + 90 = 0\n\nSolutions: B=15 or B=6\n\nBoth satisfy the equation, as shown.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that picking \"one red and one blue\" could be ordered, but since the problem says \"one red and one blue,\" order doesn't matter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the hypergeometric distribution.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\nP(X=k) = [C(K, k) * C(N-K, n-k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (total balls: 10 + B)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (say, red balls: 10)\n\n- n is the number of draws (2)\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (1 red)\n\nSo, P(one red and one blue) = [C(10,1) * C(B,1)] / C(10+B,2) = 1/2\n\nWhich is what I started with.\n\nSo, I don't see any error in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a condition that the number of blue balls must be greater than a certain number, but it's not specified.\n\nGiven that, I think both solutions are mathematically valid.\n\nBut perhaps the context suggests which one is more likely.\n\nIf this is a typical probability problem, sometimes textbooks or problems assume a certain scenario, but here, both seem possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the discriminant.\n\nWait, D = 21^2 - 4*1*90 = 441 - 360 = 81, which is correct.\n\nsqrt(81) = 9, so B = (21 \u00b1 9)/2, which gives B=15 and B=6.\n\nBoth are positive integers, which make sense in the context of counting balls.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that there are two possible numbers of blue balls that satisfy the given probability: 6 or 15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6 \\text{ or } 15} \\]"
