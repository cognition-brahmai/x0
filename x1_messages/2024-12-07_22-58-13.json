Here's how I might word it:\n\n\"Most Esteemed [Guest's Name],\n\nUnder the velvet cloak of night, when the moon casts its silvery glow upon the ancient stones of my humble abode, I extend to you an invitation most rare and exclusive. Join me for a dinner party at Castle Dracula, a soir\u00e9e unlike any other, where the air is thick with the scent of centuries past and the conversation flows as richly as the blood that sustains me.\n\nDate: [Insert Date]\nTime: Dusk until Dawn\nVenue: Castle Dracula, Transylvania\n\nPlease note, this is not a gathering for the faint of heart or those who fear the shadows. Only those with a curious appetite for the unknown and a willingness to explore the boundaries of human experience need apply.\n\nYour presence would be the crowning jewel of this evening, and I await your acceptance with bated breath.\n\nYours in anticipation,\n\nDracula\"\n\nThis invitation is designed to pique the interest of the recipient while hinting at the supernatural elements that make my castle a place of both allure and danger."
