        "content": "I'm here to help with your question! The famous British author who wrote the dystopian novel '1984', which features the concept of Big Brother surveillance, is George Orwell. His real name was Eric Arthur Blair, and he was born in India in 1903 but moved to England with his family at a young age.\n\n'1984' was published in 1949 and is set in a totalitarian society where the government, led by the enigmatic figure known as Big Brother, exercises total control over its citizens through constant surveillance, propaganda, and manipulation of reality. The novel explores themes of power, language, and individual freedom, and has had a profound influence on popular culture and political discourse.\n\nOrwell was a prolific writer, known not only for '1984' but also for another seminal work, 'Animal Farm', which is an allegorical novella critiquing Stalinism. His writing often focused on political themes and social criticism, and he remains one of the most important and widely read authors of the 20th century.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further information, feel free to ask!"
