The expression given is:\n\n((4^2 - 3 * 2)^2 / 2) + 10 * 3 - 5\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting inside the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Calculate the exponent: 4^2 = 16\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n(16 - 3 * 2)^2 / 2 + 10 * 3 - 5\n\n2. Next, multiplication inside the parentheses: 3 * 2 = 6\n\nNow it's:\n\n(16 - 6)^2 / 2 + 10 * 3 - 5\n\n3. Then, subtraction inside the parentheses: 16 - 6 = 10\n\nSo now we have:\n\n(10)^2 / 2 + 10 * 3 - 5\n\n4. Calculate the exponent: 10^2 = 100\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n100 / 2 + 10 * 3 - 5\n\n5. Now, perform multiplication and division from left to right.\n\nFirst, division: 100 / 2 = 50\n\nThen multiplication: 10 * 3 = 30\n\nSo now it's:\n\n50 + 30 - 5\n\n6. Finally, addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\n50 + 30 = 80\n\nThen 80 - 5 = 75\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 75.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
