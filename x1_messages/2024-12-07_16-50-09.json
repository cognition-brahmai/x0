        "content": "I believe the yellow substance in a chicken's gizzard is called \"gallus gallus domesticus.\" It is a type of pigment that gives the gizzard its yellow color. The exact function of this pigment is not entirely understood, but it may play a role in digestion or protection against certain pathogens. However, I'm not entirely sure about this, so it's best to confirm with a reliable source."
