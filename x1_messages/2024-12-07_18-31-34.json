        "content": "So I've got this problem here: A library has 5000 books in total. The number of fiction books is 4 times the number of non-fiction books. I need to find out how many non-fiction books there are. Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. There are two types of books: fiction and non-fiction. The total number of books is 5000, and fiction books are 4 times as many as non-fiction books. So, if I can figure out the relationship between these two types, I can solve for the number of non-fiction books.\n\nLet me try to define variables for this. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( n \\) represent the number of non-fiction books.\n\n- Since fiction books are 4 times the non-fiction books, the number of fiction books would be \\( 4n \\).\n\nNow, the total number of books is the sum of fiction and non-fiction books, right? So:\n\n\\[ n + 4n = 5000 \\]\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 5n = 5000 \\]\n\nTo find \\( n \\), I can divide both sides by 5:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{5000}{5} = 1000 \\]\n\nSo, there are 1000 non-fiction books.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If there are 1000 non-fiction books, then fiction books would be 4 times that, which is 4000. Adding them together: 1000 + 4000 = 5000, which matches the total number of books. Looks good.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the ratio of fiction to non-fiction books. The ratio is 4:1, meaning for every 4 fiction books, there is 1 non-fiction book. So, in total, there are 5 parts (4 + 1). Since the total number of books is 5000, each part represents \\( \\frac{5000}{5} = 1000 \\) books. Therefore, non-fiction books, being 1 part, are 1000.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 1000 non-fiction books.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe using equations with more variables or something like that, but I think the approach I took is the most straightforward and efficient.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 1000 non-fiction books in the library.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1000} \\]"
