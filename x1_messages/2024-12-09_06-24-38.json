He's famous for his obsession with the color green, which symbolizes his dreams, hopes, and his pursuit of Daisy Buchanan. The green light at the end of Daisy's dock is a central symbol in the novel, representing Gatsby's longing for her and his aspirations. So, yeah, Jay Gatsby is the main character you're referring to."
