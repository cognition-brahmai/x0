        "content": "It's a deep, rumbling sound that starts off low and gradually builds in intensity. At first, it's almost like the distant growl of a large animal, but as the engine comes to life, it becomes a powerful, throbbing roar that seems to shake the very ground beneath you. The pitch rises and falls in a rhythmic pattern, synchronized with the rotation of the turbines. It's a sound that commands attention and instills a sense of anticipation for the journey ahead."
