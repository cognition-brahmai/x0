Ventilators cost $25,000 each, patient monitors are priced at $5,000 per unit, and IV pumps are $1,500 each. Additionally, the hospital must pay an annual maintenance fee of 5% of the total equipment cost. Calculate the initial investment required for purchasing the equipment and the annual maintenance fees, considering a possible 3% price increase in equipment after two years."

        "content": "Let's break down the costs step by step. First, we need to calculate the initial cost of purchasing all the equipment. The hospital needs 20 ventilators, 50 patient monitors, and 100 IV pumps. The prices are as follows:\n\n- Ventilators: $25,000 each\n\n- Patient monitors: $5,000 each\n\n- IV pumps: $1,500 each\n\nSo, the total cost for each type of equipment is:\n\n- Ventilators: 20 * $25,000 = $500,000\n\n- Patient monitors: 50 * $5,000 = $250,000\n\n- IV pumps: 100 * $1,500 = $150,000\n\nNow, adding these up to get the total initial investment:\n\nTotal initial investment = $500,000 + $250,000 + $150,000 = $900,000\n\nNext, there's an annual maintenance fee of 5% of the total equipment cost. So, the annual maintenance fee is:\n\nAnnual maintenance fee = 5% of $900,000 = 0.05 * $900,000 = $45,000 per year\n\nNow, regarding the possible 3% price increase in equipment after two years, I assume this is relevant for future purchases or replacements, but since the question is about the initial investment and annual maintenance fees, I think we don't need to include this in our current calculations. However, if the hospital plans to replace the equipment after two years, this price increase would affect future costs, but for the initial investment, it remains $900,000.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Initial investment: $900,000\n\n- Annual maintenance fee: $45,000\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
