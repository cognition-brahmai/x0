        "content": "Let's break this down. The car rental company charges $25 per day and an additional 15 cents per mile driven. The customer is renting the car for 3 days and driving it for 120 miles. I need to find out the total cost.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the cost for the days rented. Since it's $25 per day and the customer is renting for 3 days, I'll multiply 25 by 3.\n\n25 * 3 = 75\n\nSo, the cost for the days is $75.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the cost for the miles driven. It's 15 cents per mile, and the customer drove 120 miles. I need to multiply 0.15 by 120.\n\n0.15 * 120 = 18\n\nSo, the cost for the miles is $18.\n\nNow, I'll add both amounts to get the total cost.\n\n75 + 18 = 93\n\nTherefore, the total cost will be $93.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total cost as the sum of the daily charge and the mileage charge.\n\nDaily charge = $25/day * 3 days = $75\n\nMileage charge = $0.15/mile * 120 miles = $18\n\nTotal cost = $75 + $18 = $93\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the daily charge and the mileage charge separately and then sum them up, which is what I did.\n\nI don't think there are any hidden costs or extra fees mentioned, so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nSo, the final answer should be $93.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{93} \\]"
