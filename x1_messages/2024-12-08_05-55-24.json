Below is a Java program that takes user input for two dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD and calculates the number of days between them.\n\n```java\nimport java.time.LocalDate;\nimport java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;\nimport java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class DaysBetweenDates {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Enter the first date (YYYY-MM-DD):\");\n        String date1Str = scanner.nextLine();\n\n        System.out.println(\"Enter the second date (YYYY-MM-DD):\");\n        String date2Str = scanner.nextLine();\n\n        DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(\"yyyy-MM-dd\");\n        LocalDate date1 = LocalDate.parse(date1Str, formatter);\n        LocalDate date2 = LocalDate.parse(date2Str, formatter);\n\n        long daysBetween = ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(date1, date2);\n\n        if (daysBetween < 0) {\n            daysBetween = -daysBetween;\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Number of days between the two dates: \" + daysBetween);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Input Handling**:\n   - The program uses `Scanner` to read user input for two dates.\n   \n2. **Date Parsing**:\n   - The dates are parsed using `DateTimeFormatter` with the pattern \"yyyy-MM-dd\" to convert the string inputs into `LocalDate` objects.\n\n3. **Calculating Days Between Dates**:\n   - The `ChronoUnit.DAYS.between()` method is used to calculate the number of days between the two dates.\n   - If the result is negative, it is converted to positive since the number of days between two dates is always a positive value.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - The program prints the number of days between the two dates.\n\nThis program ensures that the dates are correctly parsed and handles the calculation of days between them efficiently."
