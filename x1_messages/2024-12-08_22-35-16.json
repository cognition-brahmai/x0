        "content": "So I've got this problem here about fencing a garden with an extra buffer. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, the garden is rectangular, and its dimensions are 12 meters long and 8 meters wide. That means it's a rectangle with length 12m and width 8m.\n\nNow, I need to build a fence around it with an additional 1-meter buffer on all sides. So, that means the fence isn't right up against the garden; instead, it's 1 meter outside the garden on every side.\n\nAlright, to find out how much fencing I'll need, I think I need to calculate the perimeter of the area that includes the garden plus the buffer zone.\n\nLet me visualize this. If the garden is 12m long and 8m wide, and I'm adding 1 meter to all sides, that means the fence will be 1 meter outside each side of the garden.\n\nSo, for the length, which is 12m, adding 1 meter to both ends would make it 12 + 1 + 1 = 14 meters long.\n\nSimilarly, for the width, which is 8m, adding 1 meter to both sides would make it 8 + 1 + 1 = 10 meters wide.\n\nSo, the area to be fenced is 14 meters long and 10 meters wide.\n\nNow, to find the perimeter, which is the total length of fencing needed, I can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P = 2 * (length + width).\n\nPlugging in the numbers: P = 2 * (14 + 10) = 2 * 24 = 48 meters.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf the garden is 12m by 8m, and I'm adding 1 meter on all sides, yes, that should make the fenced area 14m by 10m.\n\nPerimeter is indeed 2 * (length + width), so 2 * (14 + 10) = 2 * 24 = 48 meters.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it step by step:\n\n- The fence goes around the entire area, so it has two lengths and two widths.\n\n- Each length is 14 meters, and each width is 10 meters.\n\n- So, two lengths: 2 * 14 = 28 meters.\n\n- Two widths: 2 * 10 = 20 meters.\n\n- Total fencing: 28 + 20 = 48 meters.\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at it. Maybe I can think about the buffer adding to each side.\n\nThe buffer is 1 meter on all sides, so on the length side, it's added to both ends, meaning the total addition to the length is 2 meters (1 meter per end).\n\nSimilarly, on the width side, it's added to both sides, so again, 2 meters in total.\n\nSo, original length plus 2 meters: 12 + 2 = 14 meters.\n\nOriginal width plus 2 meters: 8 + 2 = 10 meters.\n\nThen, perimeter is again 2 * (14 + 10) = 48 meters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the perimeter of the garden itself and then add the buffer.\n\nThe perimeter of the garden is 2 * (12 + 8) = 2 * 20 = 40 meters.\n\nBut adding the buffer isn't as simple as adding a fixed amount to the perimeter because the buffer adds to both the length and the width.\n\nWait, no. The buffer adds to the area outside the garden, extending the dimensions by 1 meter on all sides.\n\nSo, indeed, the fenced area is larger in both length and width by 2 meters each (1 meter on each side).\n\nTherefore, the perimeter calculation of 48 meters seems correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there a gate or any deductions needed? The problem doesn't specify anything like that, so I'll assume the entire perimeter needs fencing.\n\nAlso, the garden being rectangular and the buffer being uniform, there are no irregular shapes to consider.\n\nSo, I think 48 meters is the correct amount of fencing needed.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let's think about it differently.\n\nIf I were to place the fence 1 meter outside the garden on all sides, then the distance from the fence to the garden would be 1 meter everywhere.\n\nSo, starting from the garden, which is 12m by 8m, and adding 1 meter on all sides, the total area enclosed by the fence would be:\n\n- Length: 12m (garden) + 2 meters (1 meter on each end) = 14 meters.\n\n- Width: 8m (garden) + 2 meters (1 meter on each side) = 10 meters.\n\nPerimeter: 2 * (14 + 10) = 48 meters.\n\nYes, that seems consistent across different ways of thinking about it.\n\nTherefore, the amount of fencing needed is 48 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
