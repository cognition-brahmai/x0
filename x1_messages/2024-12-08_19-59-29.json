It's a famous mural that shows Jesus sitting down with his twelve apostles for their last meal together before his betrayal and crucifixion. The painting is known for its realistic characters and the dramatic use of light and shadow. It's located in the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. Is that the one you're thinking of?"
