        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a professional sports team trying to figure out how much they can make from advertising on their stadium's digital billboard. They want to generate $1 million in revenue from this, and they're trying to figure out what to charge per impression. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an impression is. From what I gather, an impression is basically when a fan views the billboard. So, if a fan is at the game and looks at the billboard, that's one impression. And apparently, on average, each fan views the billboard 20 times per game.\n\nThe stadium has a seating capacity of 60,000 fans. So, if the stadium is full for each game, that's 60,000 fans per game, each viewing the billboard 20 times. That means, per game, the total impressions would be 60,000 fans times 20 views per fan.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n60,000 fans/game * 20 impressions/fan = 1,200,000 impressions per game.\n\nNow, the team plays 80 home games per season. So, to find the total impressions per season, I need to multiply the impressions per game by the number of games.\n\n1,200,000 impressions/game * 80 games = 96,000,000 impressions per season.\n\nSo, that's the total number of impressions generated per season.\n\nNow, the team wants to generate $1 million in advertising revenue from these impressions. To find out the cost per impression, I need to divide the total revenue by the total number of impressions.\n\nCost per impression = total revenue / total impressions\n\nSo, $1,000,000 / 96,000,000 impressions.\n\nLet me do that division.\n\n1,000,000 / 96,000,000 = 0.01041666...\n\nThat's approximately $0.0104 per impression.\n\nTo make it more straightforward, maybe I can express it in cents.\n\n0.0104 dollars is about 1.04 cents per impression.\n\nSo, the team would need to charge roughly 1.04 cents per impression to generate $1 million in revenue from 96 million impressions.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, impressions per game: 60,000 fans * 20 impressions/fan = 1,200,000 impressions per game.\n\nThen, over 80 games: 1,200,000 impressions/game * 80 games = 96,000,000 impressions per season.\n\nNow, $1,000,000 / 96,000,000 = 0.0104 dollars per impression, which is 1.04 cents.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if the stadium is always full. The problem says \"if the stadium has a seating capacity of 60,000 fans,\" but it doesn't specify if it's always sold out. Maybe I should assume it's always full for this calculation, since it doesn't say otherwise.\n\nAlso, the billboard has a total display area of 10,000 square feet and can accommodate up to 50 ads at a time. I'm not sure if that information is relevant for calculating the cost per impression, since we're focusing on the total impressions and the desired revenue.\n\nMaybe it's information for later parts of the problem or for different scenarios, but for this particular question, I think the main things are the impressions and the revenue target.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Total impressions per season: 96,000,000\n\n- Desired revenue: $1,000,000\n\n- Cost per impression: approximately $0.0104 or 1.04 cents\n\nIf the team wants to generate $1 million in advertising revenue, they would need to charge about 1.04 cents per impression.\n\nBut perhaps they want to know how much to charge per thousand impressions, which is a common way to bid in advertising (CPM, cost per mille).\n\nTo find the CPM, I can multiply the cost per impression by 1,000.\n\nSo, 0.0104 dollars/impression * 1,000 = $10.40 per thousand impressions.\n\nThat might be a more standard way to look at it.\n\nSo, the team could charge $10.40 per thousand impressions to reach their $1 million revenue goal.\n\nBut since the question specifically asks for cost per impression, I'll stick with 1.04 cents per impression.\n\nI think that's the answer they're looking for.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe cost per impression should be \\boxed{1.04\\ \\text{cents}}"
