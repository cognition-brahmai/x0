You can store the evidence into a variable #E[index] that can be called by later tools.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nEncyclopedia[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information from Encyclopedia. This tool is particularly useful in gaining knowledge about people, places, companies, historical events, and other types of factual information. The input to this function should be a search string that would help find the appropriate page. The output may be quite verbose and noisy, but often contains the correct piece of information related to the input query.\nAIQA[input]: Tool that can answer questions either directly from common sense and general world knowledge, as well as answering questions given input context that may contain the answer.\n\nEach plan should be followed by exactly one evidence (#E[index]) value.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n#E1 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of #E1]\n#E2 = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context #E1\"]\n...\nFinal answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: What is the population of the city where Microsoft headquarters is located?"
