        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 people in a room, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total.\n\nFirst, I think about one person. If there are 10 people, and one person shakes hands with each of the other 9 people, that would be 9 handshakes for that one person.\n\nBut wait, if every person does that, then it would seem like there are 10 people each shaking hands with 9 others, which would be 10 times 9, equal to 90 handshakes.\n\nHowever, I realize that this counts each handshake twice because when person A shakes hands with person B, it's the same as person B shaking hands with person A. So, in reality, the total number of unique handshakes would be half of that.\n\nSo, 90 divided by 2 equals 45.\n\nTherefore, there are 45 unique handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this in terms of combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 people out of 10 to shake hands is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of people, and k is the number of people involved in each handshake, which is 2.\n\nSo, C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10 - 2)!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 8!) = (10 \u00d7 9) / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that the first person shakes hands with 9 others, the second person shakes hands with 8 remaining people (since they've already shaken hands with the first person), the third person shakes hands with 7 remaining people, and so on, until the last person, who doesn't need to shake hands with anyone because they've already shaken hands with everyone else.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1.\n\nIf I add those up: 9 + 8 = 17, 17 + 7 = 24, 24 + 6 = 30, 30 + 5 = 35, 35 + 4 = 39, 39 + 3 = 42, 42 + 2 = 44, 44 + 1 = 45.\n\nAgain, I get 45 handshakes.\n\nI can also recall that this is similar to finding the number of edges in a complete graph with 10 vertices, which is also given by C(10, 2), which again is 45.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach I take, I keep arriving at 45 handshakes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 45.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
