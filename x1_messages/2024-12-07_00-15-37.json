        "content": "In Greek mythology, the river that souls must cross to reach Hades is the River Styx. However, to be more precise regarding your question, it's actually the River Acheron that is often referred to as the \"river of woe\" and is one of the five rivers surrounding Hades. Souls would be ferried across the Acheron by Charon, the ferryman, to reach the underworld. The River Styx, while also an important river in Hades, serves a different purpose, as it is associated with the oath that gods take and is also where rebellious gods were exiled.\n\nBut to directly answer your question: it's the River Acheron that souls cross, guided by Charon, to reach Hades."
