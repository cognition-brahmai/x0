        "content": "In the verdant realm where Spring's soft breath doth play,\nWhere Zephyrus, with gentle wing, doth stray,\nAnd violets, like stars in emerald sky,\nAwake from winter's slumber, side by side.\n\nO, Summer! Thou with golden tresses fair,\nWhose scorching kiss doth sear the earth, beyond compare;\nThy days are long, thy nights are brief and warm,\nWhen fireflies dance in meadows, playing their sweet charm.\n\nThen Autumn comes, in robes of russet hue,\nWith harvest moon ascending, bright and true;\nThe air is crisp, the leaves like flames aflame,\nAs nature's palette paints a final, glorious name.\n\nAt last, Winter, stern and white, takes hold,\nWith frosty beard and icy, piercing cold;\nYet in his bosom lies the promise of rebirth,\nAs snow blankets the earth, in silent, purest mirth.\n\nSo dance the seasons, in eternal round,\nEach one a verse in nature's wondrous sound;\nFrom Spring's awakening to Winter's sleep,\nIn this great cycle, life and death doth keep.\n\nFor Shelley's voice, though silent now, doth sing\nThrough every leaf, through every snowflake's wing;\nHis spirit lives in nature's ceaseless flow,\nA poet's soul, where winds and waters go."
