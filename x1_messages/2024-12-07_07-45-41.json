        "content": "So the farmer has a rectangular field that's 300 meters long and 150 meters wide. He wants to plant trees along the perimeter, with one tree every 10 meters. We need to figure out how many trees he needs to do this.\n\nFirst, I think I need to calculate the perimeter of the field because the trees are going to be planted along the edge. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2*(length + width). So, plugging in the values, P = 2*(300 + 150) = 2*(450) = 900 meters. That's the total distance where trees will be planted.\n\nNow, if he wants to plant one tree every 10 meters, I can probably just divide the perimeter by the distance between trees. So, 900 meters / 10 meters/tree = 90 trees. Wait, but I remember that when planting things in a loop, like around a perimeter, you have to be careful not to double-count the starting point.\n\nLet me think about this. If I start at one corner and plant a tree every 10 meters, when I get back to the starting point, the first tree would also be the last tree if I just divide the perimeter by the interval. So, in a closed loop, the number of trees should be the perimeter divided by the interval.\n\nBut, to make sure, maybe I should calculate it differently. Let's break it down into sides.\n\nThe field is 300 meters long and 150 meters wide. So, there are two sides that are 300 meters each and two sides that are 150 meters each.\n\nStarting from one corner, let's say I plant a tree at the corner, then every 10 meters along the 300-meter side.\n\nNumber of trees on one 300-meter side: 300 / 10 = 30 trees.\n\nBut wait, if I plant a tree at both ends of the side, then the 30 trees include both end trees. So, actually, the number of intervals is 30, but the number of trees is 31, because you have a tree at both ends.\n\nWait, no. If you plant a tree every 10 meters along a 300-meter side, starting at one end, you'd have trees at 0 meters, 10 meters, 20 meters, ..., up to 300 meters. So, that's 31 trees per 300-meter side.\n\nSimilarly, for the 150-meter sides: 150 / 10 = 15 intervals, so 16 trees per side.\n\nNow, if I add up the trees on all four sides: 2*(31) + 2*(16) = 62 + 32 = 94 trees.\n\nBut wait, this counts the corner trees twice, once for each side that meets at the corner. Since there are four corners, we've double-counted four trees.\n\nSo, to correct for that, we need to subtract the four corner trees that were double-counted.\n\nTherefore, total number of trees = 94 - 4 = 90 trees.\n\nThis matches my first calculation where I divided the perimeter by the interval: 900 / 10 = 90 trees.\n\nSo, it seems like 90 trees is the correct number.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf I plant trees every 10 meters along the perimeter, starting from a corner, and go all the way around, the last tree should coincide with the first tree at the starting corner.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I ended up with 90 trees.\n\nLet me see: perimeter is 900 meters, interval is 10 meters.\n\nSo, number of trees = perimeter / interval = 900 / 10 = 90 trees.\n\nBut if I think about it, if I start at a corner and plant a tree every 10 meters, after 89 trees, I would have covered 89*10 = 890 meters.\n\nThen, the 90th tree would be at 900 meters, which brings me back to the starting point.\n\nSo, yes, 90 trees in total.\n\nAlternatively, considering that it's a closed loop, the number of trees should equal the number of intervals, which is 90.\n\nIn my earlier side-by-side calculation, I got 94 trees but then subtracted the 4 double-counted corner trees to get 90.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the farmer needs 90 trees.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 trees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]\n"
