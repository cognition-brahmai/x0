So, 500 units divided by 8 hours is:\n\n500 / 8 = 62.5 units per hour.\n\nNow, if the factory operates for 16 hours per day, the daily production would be:\n\n62.5 units/hour * 16 hours/day = 1000 units per day.\n\nFinally, to find out the weekly production for 7 days:\n\n1000 units/day * 7 days/week = 7000 units per week.\n\nSo, the factory can produce 7000 units in one week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7000} \\]"
