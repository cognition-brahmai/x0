        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students playing football and basketball. There are 30 students in total. 15 play football, 17 play basketball, and 10 play both games. I need to find out how many students don't play either game. Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many students play at least one of the two games. That way, I can subtract that number from the total number of students to find out how many don't play either game.\n\nSo, 15 play football and 17 play basketball. If I just add those two numbers together, I get 15 + 17 = 32. But wait, that's more than the total number of students, which is 30. That can't be right. Oh, right, because some students play both games. So, those 10 students who play both games are being counted twice if I just add the two numbers together.\n\nSo, to get the total number of students who play at least one game, I need to add the number of football players and basketball players and then subtract the number of students who play both, so I don't double-count them.\n\nSo, it should be 15 + 17 - 10 = 22 students play at least one of the two games.\n\nNow, to find out how many don't play either game, I subtract that number from the total number of students: 30 - 22 = 8.\n\nSo, 8 students don't play either football or basketball.\n\nLet me just double-check that. If 15 play football, and 10 of those also play basketball, then the number of students who only play football is 15 - 10 = 5. Similarly, the number who only play basketball is 17 - 10 = 7. And then, 10 play both. So, total students playing at least one game is 5 + 7 + 10 = 22, which matches what I got earlier. And 30 - 22 = 8.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
