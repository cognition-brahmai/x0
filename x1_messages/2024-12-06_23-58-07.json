        "content": "I'd be happy to help with that problem! So, we're dealing with the central limit theorem here, which is a fundamental concept in statistics. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the central limit theorem tells us that if we take sufficiently large samples from any population, the distribution of the sample means will approximate a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution. In this case, we're sampling 50 people's ages, and we're given that the population mean is 28 years and the standard deviation is 5 years.\n\nSo, our goal is to find the probability that the mean of our sample of 50 people will be between 25 and 30 years old.\n\nStep 1: Identify the parameters.\n\n- Population mean (\u03bc) = 28 years\n\n- Population standard deviation (\u03c3) = 5 years\n\n- Sample size (n) = 50\n\n- Sample mean range: 25 to 30 years\n\nStep 2: Determine the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution.\n\nThe mean of the sampling distribution (\u03bcx\u0304) is equal to the population mean (\u03bc).\n\nSo, \u03bcx\u0304 = 28 years\n\nThe standard deviation of the sampling distribution (\u03c3x\u0304), also known as the standard error, is calculated by dividing the population standard deviation (\u03c3) by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\n\u03c3x\u0304 = \u03c3 / \u221an = 5 / \u221a50 \u2248 0.7071 years\n\nStep 3: Convert the sample mean range to z-scores.\n\nWe need to standardize the sample mean values to z-scores to use the standard normal distribution table.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (x\u0304 - \u03bcx\u0304) / \u03c3x\u0304\n\nFirst, find z for x\u0304 = 25:\n\nz1 = (25 - 28) / 0.7071 \u2248 -4.24\n\nThen, find z for x\u0304 = 30:\n\nz2 = (30 - 28) / 0.7071 \u2248 2.82\n\nStep 4: Find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores.\n\nWe'll use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the area under the curve from z = -4.24 to z = 2.82.\n\nFirst, find the cumulative probability for z = 2.82.\n\nFrom the z-table, P(Z \u2264 2.82) \u2248 0.9976\n\nNext, find the cumulative probability for z = -4.24.\n\nSince the normal distribution is symmetric, P(Z \u2264 -4.24) is approximately 0 (it's a very small value, practically zero).\n\nStep 5: Calculate the probability that the sample mean is between 25 and 30.\n\nP(25 < x\u0304 < 30) = P(z1 < Z < z2) = P(Z < z2) - P(Z < z1) \u2248 0.9976 - 0 \u2248 0.9976\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 99.76%.\n\nWait a minute, that seems too high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, confirming the standard error:\n\n\u03c3x\u0304 = 5 / \u221a50 \u2248 0.7071, that seems correct.\n\nThen, z-scores:\n\nz1 = (25 - 28) / 0.7071 \u2248 -4.24\n\nz2 = (30 - 28) / 0.7071 \u2248 2.82\n\nThose look correct.\n\nNow, looking up these z-scores in the standard normal table:\n\nP(Z \u2264 2.82) is indeed about 0.9976\n\nP(Z \u2264 -4.24) is essentially 0.\n\nSo, the probability between z = -4.24 and z = 2.82 is approximately 0.9976.\n\nBut intuitively, since the population mean is 28 and the sample mean is likely to be close to the population mean due to the central limit theorem, having such a high probability for the sample mean being between 25 and 30 seems plausible.\n\nHowever, let's consider the spread. The standard error is about 0.7071 years, so within one standard error, the sample mean would be between approximately 27.2929 and 28.7071 years. Our range of 25 to 30 years covers more than three standard errors below and above the mean, which should indeed capture almost all of the distribution, given that in a normal distribution, about 99.7% of the data lies within three standard deviations of the mean.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct, and the probability is approximately 99.76% that the sample mean will be between 25 and 30 years old.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.9976} \\]"
