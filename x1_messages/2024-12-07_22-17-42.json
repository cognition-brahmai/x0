        "content": "So we have this system of equations to solve:\n\n1. 2x - y = 4\n\n2. x + 3y = 5\n\nI need to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations at the same time. There are a few methods to solve systems like this, such as substitution, elimination, or even graphing. I think I'll go with the elimination method because it seems straightforward for this pair of equations.\n\nFirst, I need to manipulate one or both equations so that when I add or subtract them, one of the variables cancels out. Let's see, if I look at the coefficients of y in both equations, they are -1 and 3. If I can make those coefficients additive inverses of each other, then adding the equations would eliminate y.\n\nTo do that, I can multiply the first equation by 3, which would make the coefficient of y in the first equation -3, and the second equation has 3y. So, adding them would cancel y.\n\nLet me go ahead and do that.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 3:\n\n3*(2x - y) = 3*4\n\nWhich gives:\n\n6x - 3y = 12\n\nNow, the second equation is:\n\nx + 3y = 5\n\nNow, if I add these two equations together:\n\n(6x - 3y) + (x + 3y) = 12 + 5\n\nThe -3y and +3y cancel out, leaving:\n\n6x + x = 17\n\nSo, 7x = 17\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 17/7\n\nOkay, so x is 17/7. Now, I need to find y. Since I have x, I can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find y. Let's use the second equation because it seems simpler.\n\nThe second equation is:\n\nx + 3y = 5\n\nPlug in x = 17/7:\n\n17/7 + 3y = 5\n\nNow, subtract 17/7 from both sides to solve for y:\n\n3y = 5 - 17/7\n\nTo subtract these, I need a common denominator. 5 is the same as 35/7, so:\n\n3y = 35/7 - 17/7 = 18/7\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\n\ny = (18/7)/3 = 18/7 * 1/3 = 18/21 = 6/7\n\nSo, y = 6/7\n\nWait a minute, let me check that division. Dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying by 1/3, so:\n\ny = (18/7) * (1/3) = 18/21\n\nAnd 18/21 simplifies to 6/7, yes, because both numerator and denominator divide by 3.\n\nSo, y = 6/7\n\nNow, to make sure that these values are correct, I should plug them back into both original equations to verify.\n\nFirst equation: 2x - y = 4\n\nPlug in x = 17/7 and y = 6/7:\n\n2*(17/7) - 6/7 = 34/7 - 6/7 = 28/7 = 4\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSecond equation: x + 3y = 5\n\nPlug in x = 17/7 and y = 6/7:\n\n17/7 + 3*(6/7) = 17/7 + 18/7 = 35/7 = 5\n\nPerfect, that also checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I had chosen to use substitution, I could have solved one equation for one variable and plugged it into the other equation. For example, from the first equation, solve for y:\n\n2x - y = 4\n\n=> -y = 4 - 2x\n\n=> y = 2x - 4\n\nThen, plug this expression for y into the second equation:\n\nx + 3*(2x - 4) = 5\n\nx + 6x - 12 = 5\n\n7x - 12 = 5\n\n7x = 17\n\nx = 17/7\n\nThen, y = 2*(17/7) - 4 = 34/7 - 28/7 = 6/7\n\nSame results as before.\n\nSo, the solution to the system is x = 17/7 and y = 6/7.\n\nI think that's it. Unless there's another way to approach this, but this seems solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left( x, y \\right) = \\left( \\dfrac{17}{7}, \\dfrac{6}{7} \\right)} \\]"
