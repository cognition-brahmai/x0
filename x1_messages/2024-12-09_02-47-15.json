        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a car that originally costs $20,000, and it depreciates by 15% each year. We need to find out after how many years its value will be less than half of what it originally cost. Half of $20,000 is $10,000, so we're looking for the point in time when the car's value drops below $10,000.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the value of the car decreases each year. A 15% decrease per year means that each year, the car is worth 85% of its value from the previous year. That's because 100% - 15% = 85%. So, if we let V be the value of the car after t years, we can express this as:\n\nV = original price * (0.85)^t\n\nIn this case, the original price is $20,000, so:\n\nV = 20000 * (0.85)^t\n\nWe want to find the smallest t such that V < 10000.\n\nSo, we set up the inequality:\n\n20000 * (0.85)^t < 10000\n\nNow, we need to solve for t.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 20000:\n\n(0.85)^t < 10000 / 20000\n\n(0.85)^t < 0.5\n\nNow, to solve for t, we can take the logarithm of both sides. I'll use the natural logarithm (ln) for this, but any logarithm base would work.\n\nln((0.85)^t) < ln(0.5)\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule, ln(a^b) = b * ln(a), so:\n\nt * ln(0.85) < ln(0.5)\n\nNow, ln(0.85) is a negative number because 0.85 is less than 1. When we divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, we have to reverse the inequality sign. So:\n\nt > ln(0.5) / ln(0.85)\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, ln(0.5). The natural logarithm of 0.5 is approximately -0.6931.\n\nln(0.85) is approximately -0.1625.\n\nSo, t > (-0.6931) / (-0.1625) \u2248 4.267\n\nSince t represents years, and we can't have a fraction of a year in this context, we need to round up to the next whole number. Because even after 4 years, the car's value might still be above $10,000, but after 5 years, it will be below.\n\nLet me verify this by calculating the value of the car after 4 and 5 years.\n\nAfter 4 years:\n\nV = 20000 * (0.85)^4\n\nLet's calculate (0.85)^4.\n\n0.85^2 = 0.7225\n\n0.7225 * 0.85 = 0.614125\n\n0.614125 * 0.85 \u2248 0.52195625\n\nSo, V \u2248 20000 * 0.52195625 \u2248 10439.125\n\nThat's still above $10,000.\n\nAfter 5 years:\n\nV = 20000 * (0.85)^5\n\nFirst, calculate (0.85)^5.\n\n0.52195625 * 0.85 \u2248 0.4436628125\n\nSo, V \u2248 20000 * 0.4436628125 \u2248 8873.25625\n\nThat's below $10,000.\n\nTherefore, after 5 years, the car's value will be less than half of its original price.\n\nSo, the answer is 5 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
