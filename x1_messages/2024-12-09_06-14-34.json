        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden that's 20 meters long and 15 meters wide, and I need to figure out the perimeter of a fence that goes around it with an extra 1-meter buffer on all sides. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the buffer means. If there's a 1-meter buffer on all sides, that means the fence isn't right up against the garden; instead, it's 1 meter outside the garden on every side. So, the fence will enclose the garden plus an extra meter around it.\n\nSince the garden is rectangular, the fence will also be rectangular, but its dimensions will be larger than those of the garden. To find the perimeter of the fenced area, I need to know its length and width first.\n\nLet's start with the length. The garden is 20 meters long, and there's a 1-meter buffer on both ends of the length. So, the total addition to the length from the buffers is 1 meter + 1 meter = 2 meters. Therefore, the length of the fenced area is 20 meters + 2 meters = 22 meters.\n\nNext, the width. The garden is 15 meters wide, and again, there's a 1-meter buffer on both sides of the width. So, the total addition to the width from the buffers is also 1 meter + 1 meter = 2 meters. Therefore, the width of the fenced area is 15 meters + 2 meters = 17 meters.\n\nNow that I have the dimensions of the fenced area\u201422 meters in length and 17 meters in width\u2014I can calculate the perimeter. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:\n\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (22 + 17) = 2 \\times 39 = 78 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach this differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the buffer adds 1 meter to each side, so overall, it adds 2 meters to both the length and the width (1 meter on each side). So, the new dimensions should be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{new length} = 20 + 2 = 22 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{new width} = 15 + 2 = 17 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nThen, the perimeter is indeed:\n\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (22 + 17) = 2 \\times 39 = 78 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Maybe I can visualize this. If I draw the garden as a rectangle, 20m by 15m, and then draw the fence 1 meter outside each side, it would encompass a larger rectangle that is 22m by 17m. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can consider the corners. Since the buffer is 1 meter on all sides, including the corners, the shape remains a rectangle, and the dimensions are correctly adjusted by adding 2 meters to both length and width.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the perimeter of the fenced area is 78 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{78} \\]"
