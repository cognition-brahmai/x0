        "content": "The formula to find the surface area of a sphere is given by:\n\nA = 4 * \u03c0 * r\u00b2\n\nWhere A is the surface area and r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the surface area A is 100 square inches, we can plug this value into the formula and solve for r.\n\nSo,\n\n100 = 4 * \u03c0 * r\u00b2\n\nFirst, divide both sides of the equation by 4 * \u03c0 to isolate r\u00b2:\n\nr\u00b2 = 100 / (4 * \u03c0)\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n4 * \u03c0 \u2248 4 * 3.1416 \u2248 12.5664\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 \u2248 100 / 12.5664 \u2248 7.96\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to solve for r:\n\nr \u2248 \u221a7.96 \u2248 2.82 inches\n\nTherefore, the radius of the sphere is approximately 2.82 inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.82 \\text{ inches}} \\]"
