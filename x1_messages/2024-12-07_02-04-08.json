        "content": "Ah, that's a classic one! You're referring to baking soda, which is indeed sodium bicarbonate. It's amazing how something so simple can have such a variety of uses around the house. For baking, it's a leavening agent that helps cakes and cookies rise by producing carbon dioxide when it reacts with acid ingredients like vinegar or lemon juice. In cleaning, it's great for scrubbing surfaces because it's mildly abrasive and also helps to deodorize. And for extinguishing small fires, especially those involving grease or electrical equipment, baking soda can be effective because it smotheres the fire and doesn't conduct electricity. Just make sure not to use it on grease fires in ovens or stovetops unless you have no other option, as it might not be sufficient for larger fires. Safety first!"
