        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a car that travels from Town X to Town Y at 40 mph and comes back at 60 mph. We need to find the average speed for the whole trip.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, if I can find the total distance and the total time, I can calculate the average speed.\n\nLet's assume the distance between Town X and Town Y is D miles. That means the total distance for the round trip is 2D miles.\n\nNow, for the trip from Town X to Town Y at 40 mph, the time taken would be D divided by 40 hours. Similarly, the return trip at 60 mph would take D divided by 60 hours.\n\nSo, the total time for the round trip is (D/40 + D/60) hours.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 40 and 60 is 120. So, D/40 is equal to 3D/120, and D/60 is equal to 2D/120. Adding them up gives (3D + 2D)/120 = 5D/120 = D/24 hours.\n\nNow, the average speed is total distance divided by total time, which is 2D divided by D/24.\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so 2D divided by D/24 is 2D * 24/D. The D's cancel out, leaving 2 * 24 = 48 mph.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. But I've heard that the average speed isn't always just the average of the two speeds. In this case, it's coming out to 48 mph, which is the harmonic mean of 40 and 60, I think.\n\nLet me verify this with another approach. Maybe using the formula for average speed when distances are equal.\n\nI recall that if the distances are equal but speeds are different, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the two speeds. The harmonic mean of two numbers, A and B, is given by 2AB/(A + B).\n\nSo, plugging in A = 40 and B = 60, we get (2 * 40 * 60)/(40 + 60) = (4800)/100 = 48 mph.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the average speed is 48 mph.\n\nBut why isn't it just the arithmetic mean, like (40 + 60)/2 = 50 mph? Well, because the time spent traveling at each speed is different. The car spends more time at the slower speed, so the average speed is closer to the slower speed.\n\nLet me think of it another way. Suppose the distance between Town X and Town Y is 120 miles. That's a nice number that's divisible by both 40 and 60.\n\nSo, going from X to Y at 40 mph, time = 120/40 = 3 hours.\n\nReturning from Y to X at 60 mph, time = 120/60 = 2 hours.\n\nTotal distance = 240 miles.\n\nTotal time = 3 + 2 = 5 hours.\n\nAverage speed = 240 / 5 = 48 mph.\n\nAgain, 48 mph.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the formula for average speed for two equal distances:\n\nAverage speed = (2 * speed1 * speed2)/(speed1 + speed2)\n\nPlugging in speed1 = 40 and speed2 = 60:\n\n(2 * 40 * 60)/(40 + 60) = (4800)/100 = 48 mph.\n\nSo, all these methods lead to the same answer: 48 mph.\n\nI think I've confirmed it thoroughly. The average speed for the entire trip is 48 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
