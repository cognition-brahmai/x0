        "content": "To determine the present value of an investment that will be worth $10,000 in five years with an annual interest rate of 4%, compounded annually, we can use the formula for the present value of a future sum of money. The formula is:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( PV \\) is the present value,\n\n- \\( FV \\) is the future value ($10,000 in this case),\n\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (4%, or 0.04 as a decimal), and\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of years (5 years).\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{10,000}{(1 + 0.04)^5} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n\n\\[ (1 + 0.04)^5 = (1.04)^5 \\]\n\nUsing a calculator to find \\( (1.04)^5 \\):\n\n\\[ (1.04)^5 \\approx 1.2166529 \\]\n\nNow, divide the future value by this amount:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{10,000}{1.2166529} \\approx 8,219.27 \\]\n\nTherefore, the present value of the investment is approximately $8,219.27.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe present value is the amount of money that, if invested today at a given interest rate, will grow to a specified future value over a certain period. In this case, we're finding out how much needs to be invested now to have $10,000 in five years, assuming the investment earns 4% interest compounded annually.\n\nThe formula accounts for the time value of money, which is the concept that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future due to its potential earning capacity. By discounting the future value back to the present using the interest rate, we can determine the initial investment required.\n\nSo, if you invest approximately $8,219.27 today at an annual interest rate of 4%, compounded annually, it will grow to $10,000 in five years."
