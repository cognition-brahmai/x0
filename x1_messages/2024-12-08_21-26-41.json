        "content": "So I've got this problem here: There are 500 buildings in a city, each with an average of 10 floors, and each floor has an average of 4 apartments. I need to find out how many apartments there are in total in the city. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have to find the total number of apartments in the entire city. To do that, I should probably find out how many apartments are in one building and then multiply that by the total number of buildings.\n\nSo, starting with one building: It has 10 floors, and each floor has 4 apartments. So, the number of apartments in one building would be 10 floors times 4 apartments per floor. That is:\n\n10 floors/building * 4 apartments/floor = 40 apartments/building\n\nOkay, so each building has 40 apartments.\n\nNow, there are 500 buildings in the city. So, to find the total number of apartments in the city, I should multiply the number of apartments per building by the total number of buildings.\n\nThat would be:\n\n500 buildings * 40 apartments/building\n\nNow, let's do the math:\n\n500 * 40\n\nWell, 500 times 40 is the same as 500 times 4 tens, which is 2,000 tens, which is 20,000.\n\nSo, there are 20,000 apartments in the city.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of total floors in the city and then multiply by the number of apartments per floor.\n\nFirst, find the total number of floors in the city.\n\nThere are 500 buildings, each with 10 floors, so:\n\n500 buildings * 10 floors/building = 5,000 floors\n\nNow, each floor has 4 apartments, so:\n\n5,000 floors * 4 apartments/floor = 20,000 apartments\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to multiply all the averages together.\n\nSo, number of apartments = number of buildings * average floors/building * average apartments/floor\n\nThat is:\n\n500 * 10 * 4 = 20,000\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this calculation.\n\nFor example, are there any buildings that don't have 10 floors? The problem says \"each building has an average of 10 floors,\" which suggests that some buildings might have more and some less, but the average is 10. Since it's an average, and we're dealing with averages for floors and apartments per floor, multiplying them should give us the total average number of apartments.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"average of 4 apartments per floor,\" so again, some floors might have more or less, but on average, it's 4.\n\nGiven that, our calculation should be accurate.\n\nIs there any other way this could be interpreted?\n\nWell, maybe if the averages weren't independent or something, but in this context, it seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem meant that each building has exactly 10 floors and each floor has exactly 4 apartments, then the calculation is precise.\n\nBut since it's given as an average, and in a large sample like 500 buildings, using the averages should give a good approximation.\n\nI think 20,000 is the correct total number of apartments in the city.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20000} \\]"
