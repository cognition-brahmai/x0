        "content": "So the original garden is a rectangle with a length of 30 meters and a width of 20 meters. The owner wants to increase the length by 50% and the width by 25%. I need to find out what the new area of the garden will be after these increases.\n\nFirst, I should remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, the original area is 30 meters times 20 meters, which is 600 square meters. But of course, the question is about the new area after the increases.\n\nOkay, so the length is increased by 50%. That means the new length will be the original length plus 50% of the original length. Similarly, the width is increased by 25%, so the new width will be the original width plus 25% of the original width.\n\nLet me calculate the new length first. Original length is 30 meters, and it's increased by 50%. So, 50% of 30 meters is 0.5 times 30, which is 15 meters. Therefore, the new length is 30 meters plus 15 meters, which equals 45 meters.\n\nNow, for the width. Original width is 20 meters, and it's increased by 25%. So, 25% of 20 meters is 0.25 times 20, which is 5 meters. Therefore, the new width is 20 meters plus 5 meters, which equals 25 meters.\n\nNow that I have the new length and new width, I can calculate the new area. New area is new length times new width, so that's 45 meters times 25 meters.\n\nLet me do that multiplication. 45 times 25. Well, 40 times 25 is 1000, and 5 times 25 is 125, so total is 1125 square meters.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? The original area was 600 square meters, and both dimensions have been increased, so the new area should indeed be larger. 1125 square meters is larger than 600 square meters, so that seems logical.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that when both dimensions are scaled, the area is scaled by the product of the scale factors. Let me see if that makes sense here.\n\nThe length is increased by 50%, which is the same as multiplied by 1.5 (since 100% + 50% = 150% = 1.5 times the original). The width is increased by 25%, which is the same as multiplied by 1.25 (100% + 25% = 125% = 1.25 times the original).\n\nSo, the area scale factor would be 1.5 times 1.25. Let me calculate that: 1.5 times 1.25. 1 times 1.25 is 1.25, and 0.5 times 1.25 is 0.625, so total is 1.875 times the original area.\n\nOriginal area is 600 square meters, so new area would be 600 times 1.875. Let me calculate that: 600 times 1 is 600, 600 times 0.8 is 480, and 600 times 0.075 is 45, so total is 600 + 480 + 45 = 1125 square meters.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, which is a good sign. So, the new area of the garden is 1125 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1125} \\]"
