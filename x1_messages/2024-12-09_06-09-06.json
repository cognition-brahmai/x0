        "content": "So in this class, there are 40 students in total. And out of these, 75% passed their math exam. I need to find out how many students failed the exam.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many students passed the exam. Since 75% passed, I can calculate that by taking 75% of 40.\n\nTo calculate 75% of 40, I can multiply 40 by 0.75. Let me do that:\n\n40 \u00d7 0.75 = 30\n\nSo, 30 students passed the exam.\n\nNow, to find out how many failed, I can subtract the number of students who passed from the total number of students.\n\nTotal students = 40\n\nStudents who passed = 30\n\nStudents who failed = Total students - Students who passed\n\nStudents who failed = 40 - 30 = 10\n\nTherefore, 10 students failed the exam.\n\nBut let me double-check that.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that if 75% passed, then 25% failed, because 100% - 75% = 25%.\n\nSo, I can also calculate 25% of 40 to find the number of students who failed.\n\n25% of 40 is 0.25 \u00d7 40 = 10\n\nYes, same answer.\n\nSo, definitely, 10 students failed the exam.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
