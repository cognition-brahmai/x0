        "content": "Let's see. The baker uses 4 cups of flour to make 12 muffins, and I need to find out how many cups are needed for 45 muffins. Hmm, this seems like a proportion problem.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much flour is used per muffin. If 4 cups make 12 muffins, then the amount of flour per muffin would be 4 cups divided by 12 muffins. That is, 4/12 = 1/3 cup per muffin.\n\nNow, if each muffin requires 1/3 cup of flour, then for 45 muffins, I would need 45 times 1/3 cup. So, 45 * (1/3) = 15 cups.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Another way to look at it is to set up a proportion. If 4 cups are to 12 muffins, then x cups are to 45 muffins. So, 4/12 = x/45.\n\nTo solve for x, I can cross-multiply: 4 * 45 = 12 * x, which gives 180 = 12x. Then, x = 180 / 12 = 15 cups.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, which is 15 cups. I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
