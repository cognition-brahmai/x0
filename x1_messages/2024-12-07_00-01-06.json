        "content": "Let's see. So, I've got this problem here about driving at different speeds for different amounts of time and needing to find out the total distance traveled. Okay, first things first, I need to remember the basic formula that relates distance, speed, and time. I think it's:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nYeah, that sounds right. So, if I'm driving at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, the distance for that part would be:\n\nDistance1 = 60 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 180 miles\n\nThen, for the next part, driving at 75 mph for 2 hours, the distance would be:\n\nDistance2 = 75 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 150 miles\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just need to add these two distances together:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 180 miles + 150 miles = 330 miles\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider here? Like, is the speed constant throughout each segment, or is there acceleration or something? The problem says \"average speed,\" so I think it's fine to use the formula directly.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. Here, both speeds are in miles per hour and times are in hours, so everything matches up.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations:\n\n60 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 180 miles\n\n75 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 150 miles\n\nAdding them up: 180 + 150 = 330 miles\n\nYeah, that seems correct. I don't think there's anything else I need to consider for this problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{330} \\]"
