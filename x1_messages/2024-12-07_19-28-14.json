        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to find the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle where the legs measure 8 cm and 15 cm. I know that the Pythagorean theorem is what I should use here, but to be honest, it's been a while since I last worked with it. I think it's something like a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse, and a and b are the legs. Let me make sure I have that right.\n\nFirst, I should confirm what the Pythagorean theorem actually states. It's a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle. It says that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, yes, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2 sounds about right.\n\nNow, in this problem, the legs are 8 cm and 15 cm. I need to find the hypotenuse, which is c. So, plugging in the values, I get:\n\n8\u00b2 + 15\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n\nLet me calculate 8 squared and 15 squared.\n\n8\u00b2 is 64, and 15\u00b2 is 225. So,\n\n64 + 225 = c\u00b2\n\nAdding those together gives me:\n\n289 = c\u00b2\n\nNow, to find c, I need to take the square root of both sides.\n\nc = \u221a289\n\nI know that 17\u00b2 is 289, so c should be 17 cm.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check that. Is 17 times 17 really 289?\n\nYes, 17 times 17 is 289. So, c = 17 cm.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should verify this using another method. Maybe using the properties of Pythagorean triples. I recall that there are certain sets of integers that satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, like 3-4-5, 5-12-13, and 8-15-17. Hey, look at that, 8-15-17 is a Pythagorean triple, which matches the sides I have here. So, that confirms that the hypotenuse should be 17 cm.\n\nAlternatively, I could use trigonometry to find the angles and then find the hypotenuse, but that seems more complicated for this straightforward problem. Since I'm dealing with a right triangle and I have both legs, the Pythagorean theorem is definitely the way to go.\n\nLet me also consider if there's any possibility that the hypotenuse could be something else. For example, maybe I misidentified which side is the hypotenuse. But in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is always the longest side and is opposite the right angle. Given that 17 cm is longer than both 8 cm and 15 cm, it makes sense.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the triangle could be scaled or if there are any similar triangles involved, but in this case, it's a straightforward right triangle with given leg lengths, so no need to worry about that.\n\nJust for extra clarity, maybe I can draw a diagram in my mind. Imagine a right triangle with legs of 8 cm and 15 cm. Applying the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nc = \u221a(8\u00b2 + 15\u00b2) = \u221a(64 + 225) = \u221a289 = 17 cm.\n\nYes, that seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use the formula for the hypotenuse in terms of the legs, it's c = \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2), which again gives me c = \u221a(64 + 225) = \u221a289 = 17 cm.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways. The hypotenuse is indeed 17 cm.\n\nJust to be comprehensive, maybe I can think about what the area of the triangle would be, but that's not part of the question. The area would be (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*8*15 = 60 cm\u00b2, but again, that's not what's being asked.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the length of the hypotenuse is 17 cm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17 \\text{ cm}} \\]"
