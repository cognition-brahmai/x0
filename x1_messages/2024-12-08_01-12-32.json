        "content": "So I've got this problem here about building a fence around a rectangular garden. The garden is 30 feet long and 20 feet wide, and I need to add a fence around it with a gate that's 4 feet wide. I need to find out the total length of the fence required.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the perimeter of the garden since the fence is going around the entire thing. For a rectangle, the perimeter is calculated by adding up all the sides, or more specifically, by the formula: perimeter = 2 * (length + width).\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: perimeter = 2 * (30 + 20) = 2 * 50 = 100 feet.\n\nNow, there's a gate that's 4 feet wide. Does that mean I need to subtract the width of the gate from the total perimeter because the gate will be part of the fence? Or is the gate in addition to the fence?\n\nWait a minute, the problem says \"with an additional gate that is 4 feet wide.\" So, it sounds like the gate is included in the fence, and it's an opening that's 4 feet wide. That means, in the total fence length, there's a 4-foot section that doesn't need fencing because it's the gate.\n\nTherefore, the total length of the fence would be the perimeter minus the width of the gate.\n\nSo, total fence length = perimeter - gate width = 100 feet - 4 feet = 96 feet.\n\nBut, I should double-check if there's any other factor I'm missing. Is there anything else mentioned in the problem? Oh, it's a rectangular garden, and we're building a fence around it with one gate that's 4 feet wide. Seems straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if the gate is placed in a specific side. For example, is it on the length or the width side? But actually, since it's a rectangle, and the gate can be placed on any side, it shouldn't matter for the total length calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gate requires additional fencing on either side or something. But the problem doesn't specify any extra requirements for the gate other than its width.\n\nSo, I think my initial approach is correct: total fence length is the perimeter minus the gate width.\n\nTherefore, the total length of the fence required is 96 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{96} \\]"
