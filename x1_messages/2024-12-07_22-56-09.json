        "content": "Let's see. The train is going from Town A to Town B at a constant speed of 60 km/h, and the total distance is 240 km. It takes 2 hours to travel halfway. I need to find out how long it will take to reach Town B.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what halfway means. Since the total distance is 240 km, halfway would be 120 km. So, the train takes 2 hours to cover 120 km.\n\nWait a minute, if the train is moving at a constant speed of 60 km/h, then in 2 hours it should cover 120 km, which matches the halfway distance. So far, so good.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the total time to reach Town B. Since halfway is 120 km and it takes 2 hours, and the train is moving at a constant speed, the time to cover the second half should be the same, another 2 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time to reach Town B would be 2 hours (first half) plus 2 hours (second half), which equals 4 hours.\n\nBut let me double-check. If the train is going at 60 km/h and the total distance is 240 km, then time equals distance divided by speed. So, 240 km divided by 60 km/h should be 4 hours. Yeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but the question says it takes the train 2 hours to travel halfway, which we've established is 120 km at 60 km/h. So, everything consistent here.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using velocity or something, but since it's constant speed, no need to complicate it.\n\nSo, the answer should be 4 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
