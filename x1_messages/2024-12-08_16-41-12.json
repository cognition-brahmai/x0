        "content": "So, the factory makes 500 widgets every hour, and it operates 24 hours a day. We want to find out how many widgets it makes in a week. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many widgets are made in one day. Since there are 24 hours in a day and the factory makes 500 widgets each hour, we can multiply 500 by 24 to get the daily production.\n\n500 widgets/hour \u00d7 24 hours/day = 12,000 widgets/day\n\nSo, the factory makes 12,000 widgets in one day.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many widgets are made in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we can multiply the daily production by 7.\n\n12,000 widgets/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 84,000 widgets/week\n\nTherefore, the factory makes 84,000 widgets in a week.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n1. Calculate hourly production: 500 widgets/hour\n\n2. Calculate daily production: 500 widgets/hour \u00d7 24 hours/day = 12,000 widgets/day\n\n3. Calculate weekly production: 12,000 widgets/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 84,000 widgets/week\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{84000} \\]"
