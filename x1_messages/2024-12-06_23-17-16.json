Here's my effort:\n\nA poem with vowels only, it seems,\nIn i's and e's, it teems.\nWith a and o's, it flows,\nU and y's, it shows,\nIn vowel land, it's supreme.\n\nPlease note that in this limerick, I've used words like \"a,\" \"i,\" \"e,\" \"o,\" and \"u,\" which are vowels. The word \"y\" is sometimes considered a vowel, depending on its usage. This limerick plays with these sounds to create a light-hearted verse.\n"
