        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a jar with 5 red marbles, 3 blue marbles, and 2 green marbles. That's a total of 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 marbles. We're supposed to draw 3 marbles at random without replacement, and we want to find the probability that we get exactly one marble of each color.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I draw a marble, it stays out of the jar, so the total number of marbles decreases with each draw. Also, the order in which I draw the marbles doesn't matter here because we're just interested in the combination of colors.\n\nTo find the probability, I know that probability is equal to the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to find both the total number of ways to draw 3 marbles from 10, and the number of ways to draw one red, one blue, and one green marble.\n\nLet's start with the total number of possible outcomes. Since we're drawing 3 marbles from 10 without regard to order, this is a combination problem. The number of combinations of 10 things taken 3 at a time is denoted as C(10,3), which is calculated as:\n\nC(10,3) = 10! / (3! * (10-3)!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 120\n\nSo, there are 120 possible ways to draw 3 marbles from 10.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to draw one red, one blue, and one green marble. Since there are 5 red, 3 blue, and 2 green marbles, the number of ways to choose one of each is:\n\nNumber of ways to choose one red: C(5,1) = 5\n\nNumber of ways to choose one blue: C(3,1) = 3\n\nNumber of ways to choose one green: C(2,1) = 2\n\nTo find the total number of favorable outcomes, I multiply these together:\n\n5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 = 30\n\nSo, there are 30 ways to draw one marble of each color.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = 30 / 120 = 1/4\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe considering the different orders in which I could draw the marbles.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of drawing one of each color in a specific order, and then multiply by the number of possible orders.\n\nFor example, the probability of drawing a red first, then a blue, then a green would be:\n\n(5/10) \u00d7 (3/9) \u00d7 (2/8) = (1/2) \u00d7 (1/3) \u00d7 (1/4) = 1/24\n\nSimilarly, the probability for any other specific order would be the same, 1/24.\n\nNow, how many different orders are there to draw one of each color? Well, there are 3 colors, and we're drawing 3 marbles, each of a different color, so the number of permutations is 3! = 6.\n\nTherefore, the total probability would be 6 \u00d7 (1/24) = 1/4, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the probability of drawing exactly one marble of each color is 1/4 or 25%.\n\nLet me just make sure there aren't any other factors to consider. Is there any possibility that I could draw marbles of the same color? Well, yes, but that's already accounted for in the total number of possible outcomes. Since we're only interested in the cases where we have one of each color, and we've calculated the number of favorable outcomes accordingly, I think this is correct.\n\nAlso, since the marbles are drawn without replacement, the probabilities change with each draw, which is why I had to adjust the denominators in the second method (from 10 to 9 to 8).\n\nOverall, I'm confident that the probability is 1/4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}} \\]"
