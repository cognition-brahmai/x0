There are currently 50,000 traditional streetlights in the city, which consume 150 watts each. The new LED streetlights consume only 50 watts each. Calculate the potential energy savings and reduction in electricity costs if the city replaces all traditional streetlights with LED streetlights, assuming an electricity cost of $0.12 per kilowatt-hour and an average daily usage of 12 hours per streetlight. Provide step-by-step calculations."

        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. The city council wants to replace traditional streetlights with LED streetlights to save energy and reduce maintenance costs. We've got some numbers to work with:\n\n- There are currently 50,000 traditional streetlights.\n\n- Each traditional streetlight uses 150 watts.\n\n- Each LED streetlight uses 50 watts.\n\n- The cost of electricity is $0.12 per kilowatt-hour.\n\n- Each streetlight is used for an average of 12 hours per day.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how much energy the traditional streetlights use compared to the LED streetlights. Then, I can calculate the potential energy savings and the reduction in electricity costs.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the daily energy consumption of one traditional streetlight.**\n\nPower consumption = 150 watts\n\nUsage per day = 12 hours\n\nEnergy per day = power \u00d7 time = 150 watts \u00d7 12 hours\n\nBut since electricity is billed in kilowatt-hours, I need to convert watts to kilowatts.\n\n1 kilowatt = 1000 watts\n\nSo, 150 watts = 0.15 kilowatts\n\nTherefore, energy per day = 0.15 kW \u00d7 12 hours = 1.8 kilowatt-hours (kWh)\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the daily energy consumption of one LED streetlight.**\n\nPower consumption = 50 watts = 0.05 kilowatts\n\nEnergy per day = 0.05 kW \u00d7 12 hours = 0.6 kWh\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the daily energy savings per streetlight.**\n\nSavings per streetlight = energy consumption of traditional - energy consumption of LED\n\n= 1.8 kWh - 0.6 kWh = 1.2 kWh per day\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total daily energy savings for all 50,000 streetlights.**\n\nTotal savings per day = 1.2 kWh/streetlight \u00d7 50,000 streetlights = 60,000 kWh\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the daily cost savings.**\n\nCost per kWh = $0.12\n\nDaily cost savings = 60,000 kWh \u00d7 $0.12/kWh = $7,200\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the annual cost savings.**\n\nAssuming 365 days in a year:\n\nAnnual cost savings = $7,200/day \u00d7 365 days/year = $2,628,000 per year\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting from step 1:\n\n150 watts = 0.15 kW\n\n0.15 kW \u00d7 12 hours = 1.8 kWh per day\n\nLED: 50 watts = 0.05 kW\n\n0.05 kW \u00d7 12 hours = 0.6 kWh per day\n\nSavings per streetlight: 1.8 - 0.6 = 1.2 kWh per day\n\nTotal savings: 1.2 kWh \u00d7 50,000 = 60,000 kWh per day\n\nCost savings: 60,000 kWh \u00d7 $0.12/kWh = $7,200 per day\n\nAnnual savings: $7,200 \u00d7 365 = $2,628,000 per year\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2,628,000} \\]"
