        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here about balls in a box. There are red, blue, and green balls, and some relationships between their quantities. Let me try to wrap my head around it.\n\nSo, it says there are twice as many red balls as blue balls. That means if I have a certain number of blue balls, the red balls are double that amount. And then, there are three times as many green balls as red balls. So, green balls are three times the red ones. Finally, the total number of all balls together is 72.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to use variables to represent the unknowns. Let's let B represent the number of blue balls. Then, since there are twice as many red balls as blue balls, I can say that the number of red balls, R, is 2 times B, so R = 2B.\n\nNext, the green balls are three times the red balls, so G = 3R. But since R is 2B, that means G = 3*(2B) = 6B.\n\nNow, the total number of balls is the sum of red, blue, and green balls, which is R + B + G = 72.\n\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of B, that's 2B + B + 6B = 72.\n\nCombining like terms, that's 9B = 72.\n\nSo, to find B, I can divide both sides by 9: B = 72 / 9 = 8.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 blue balls in the box.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If B = 8, then R = 2*8 = 16, and G = 3*16 = 48.\n\nAdding them up: 8 + 16 + 48 = 72. Yep, that checks out.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
