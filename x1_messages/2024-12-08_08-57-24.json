        "content": "So the problem is that a restaurant has 12 different dishes, and each customer orders 3 dishes. We need to find out how many different combinations of dishes a customer can order. And you want me to provide step-by-step logic for this.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what a combination is. From what I recall, a combination is a selection of items where the order doesn't matter. So, in this case, since the customer is ordering 3 dishes and it doesn't specify that the order matters, I think combinations are the way to go.\n\nSo, the formula for combinations is given by:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from.\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose.\n\n- \\( n! \\) is the factorial of n, which means the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- \\( n = 12 \\) (since there are 12 different dishes)\n\n- \\( k = 3 \\) (since each customer orders 3 dishes)\n\nSo, plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 3) = \\frac{12!}{3!(12 - 3)!} = \\frac{12!}{3! \\cdot 9!}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate this. But calculating factorials can get messy, especially with large numbers, so I should look for a way to simplify this.\n\nFirst, recall that \\( 12! = 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9! \\), so the \\( 9! \\) terms will cancel out in the numerator and the denominator.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nC(12, 3) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9!}{3! \\times 9!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{3!}\n\\]\n\nNext, \\( 3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\), so:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 3) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{6}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerator:\n\n\\( 12 \\times 11 = 132 \\)\n\n\\( 132 \\times 10 = 1320 \\)\n\nSo, numerator is 1320.\n\nNow, divide by the denominator:\n\n\\( 1320 \\div 6 = 220 \\)\n\nTherefore, the number of different combinations of dishes a customer can order is 220.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about combinations is to use the formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\dots(n-k+1)}{k!}\n\\]\n\nWhich is essentially what we did earlier. In this case:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 3) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{3!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{6} = 220\n\\]\n\nSo, that matches our previous result.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can try calculating it another way. Suppose I think about permutations instead of combinations. In permutations, the order matters.\n\nThe formula for permutations is:\n\n\\[\nP(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nSo, for n=12 and k=3:\n\n\\[\nP(12, 3) = \\frac{12!}{9!} = 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 = 1320\n\\]\n\nNow, in permutations, each different order is considered a distinct arrangement. But in combinations, order doesn't matter, so each combination of 3 dishes would be counted multiple times in permutations.\n\nSpecifically, each combination would be counted \\( k! \\) times in permutations, where k is the number of items chosen. Here, k=3, so each combination is counted \\( 3! = 6 \\) times in permutations.\n\nTherefore, to get the number of combinations from permutations, we divide the number of permutations by \\( k! \\):\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{P(n, k)}{k!} = \\frac{1320}{6} = 220\n\\]\n\nAgain, this matches our previous result.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should be considering. For example, is it possible to order the same dish more than once? The problem doesn't specify, but it says \"each customer orders 3 dishes,\" and since it's from 12 different dishes, I think it's safe to assume that dishes are not being reordered by the same customer. So, no repetition.\n\nAlso, does the order in which the dishes are ordered matter? The problem doesn't indicate that, and since it's about combinations, order shouldn't matter.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the dishes are being ordered simultaneously or in sequence, but again, since it's about the selection, order shouldn't matter.\n\nSo, I think combinations are the correct approach here.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to list out the combinations for a smaller number to see if my understanding is correct. For example, if there were 4 dishes and ordering 2, the combinations would be:\n\n1. Dish A and B\n\n2. Dish A and C\n\n3. Dish A and D\n\n4. Dish B and C\n\n5. Dish B and D\n\n6. Dish C and D\n\nTotal of 6 combinations.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\times 2} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nWhich matches what I listed out. So, the formula seems correct.\n\nApplying the same logic to the original problem:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 3) = \\frac{12!}{3! \\cdot 9!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{6} = 220\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of different combinations of dishes a customer can order is 220.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{220} \\]"
