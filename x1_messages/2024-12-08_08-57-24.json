        "content": "The term \"Cold War\" refers to the tense political and military rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union during the latter half of the 20th century. This period, spanning from the end of World War II in 1945 to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, was characterized by mutual distrust, ideological differences, and proxy conflicts around the world, but without any direct large-scale fighting between the two superpowers themselves. The Cold War shaped global politics, economics, and culture, leading to significant developments such as the Space Race, the Arms Race, and the spread of nuclear weapons."
