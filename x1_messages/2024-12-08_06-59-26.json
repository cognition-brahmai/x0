        "content": "Yes, spinach is indeed a great source of dietary iron. It contains a significant amount of non-heme iron, which is the type of iron found in plant-based foods. A single cup of cooked spinach can provide around 6 milligrams of iron, which is about 30% of the recommended daily intake for adult males and 15% for adult females. However, it's important to note that the iron in spinach is not as easily absorbed by the body as the heme iron found in animal products. To enhance iron absorption from spinach, it's helpful to consume it with a source of vitamin C, such as citrus fruits or bell peppers."
