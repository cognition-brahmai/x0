For example, American Sign Language (ASL) is different from British Sign Language (BSL), and both are distinct from Australian Sign Language (Auslan), among others.\n\nEven within a country, there can be variations in sign language based on regional dialects or local usage. Additionally, just as with spoken languages, sign language users may need interpreters to communicate with users of different sign languages.\n\nIt's important to recognize that sign languages are natural languages in their own right and are not universal. They have developed independently in different communities and have their own structures and expressions."
