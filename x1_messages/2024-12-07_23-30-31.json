        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a bag with 8 red balls, 6 blue balls, and 4 green balls. I need to find the probability of picking either a red or a green ball at random. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what probability is. Probability is the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are picking a red or a green ball, and the total outcomes are picking any ball from the bag.\n\nLet me find the total number of balls in the bag. There are 8 red, 6 blue, and 4 green balls. So, total balls = 8 + 6 + 4 = 18 balls.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of red balls plus the number of green balls, which is 8 + 4 = 12 balls.\n\nSo, the probability P of picking a red or green ball is P = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 12 / 18.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 6, which gives me 2 / 3.\n\nSo, the probability is 2/3.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. I know that probability can also be thought of in terms of adding probabilities of independent events. Since picking a red ball and picking a green ball are two separate events, maybe I can add their individual probabilities.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball is 8/18, and the probability of picking a green ball is 4/18. So, P(red or green) = P(red) + P(green) = 8/18 + 4/18 = 12/18 = 2/3.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of not picking a blue ball, since the only other options are red and green. The number of blue balls is 6, so the probability of not picking blue is 1 - P(blue) = 1 - (6/18) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.\n\nAgain, the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 2/3 is correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. The problem says \"picking one ball without looking,\" which means it's a random pick, and each ball has an equal chance of being picked. So, my approach should be correct.\n\nI should also make sure that I'm not missing any balls or miscounting. Let's see: 8 red, 6 blue, 4 green; total 18. Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said that some balls are identical or that there are different probabilities for picking different colors, that might change things. But it doesn't mention anything like that, so I can assume each ball has an equal chance.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can think about it in terms of permutations or combinations, but since I'm picking only one ball, it's straightforward. The formula for probability remains the same.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability of picking a red or green ball is 2/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}} \\]"
