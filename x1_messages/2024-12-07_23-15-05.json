        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. So, the store has a initial discount of 25% on all items. That means everything is marked down by a quarter of their original price. Then, at the checkout, there's an additional 10% discount on the already discounted price. We need to find out the final price of an item that originally costs $80 after both discounts are applied.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the price after the initial 25% discount.\n\nOriginal price: $80\n\nDiscount: 25% of $80\n\nTo find 25% of $80, I can multiply 80 by 0.25.\n\n$80 * 0.25 = $20\n\nSo, the discount amount is $20.\n\nNow, subtract that from the original price to get the price after the first discount.\n\n$80 - $20 = $60\n\nAlright, so after the first discount, the item costs $60.\n\nNext, there's an additional 10% discount at the checkout on this already discounted price.\n\nSo, I need to find 10% of $60.\n\n10% of $60 is $60 * 0.10 = $6\n\nNow, subtract that additional discount from the already discounted price.\n\n$60 - $6 = $54\n\nTherefore, the final price of the item after both discounts is $54.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a better way to calculate this.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the combined effect of both discounts.\n\nFirst, the first discount is 25%, so the customer pays 75% of the original price.\n\nThen, an additional 10% discount on the already discounted price means the customer pays 90% of the already discounted price.\n\nSo, first, 75% of $80 is $60, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, 90% of $60 is $54, which again matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the combined discount percentage.\n\nBut, to find the combined discount, it's not just adding 25% and 10% because that would be 35%, which isn't accurate in this case.\n\n Discounts are applied sequentially, not cumulatively in this manner.\n\nSo, the correct way is to apply each discount one after the other, as I did initially.\n\nTherefore, the final price is indeed $54.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I try to calculate the overall discount rate.\n\nThe original price is $80.\n\nFinal price is $54.\n\nSo, the total discount is $80 - $54 = $26.\n\nWhat percentage is $26 out of $80?\n\n($26 / $80) * 100% = 32.5%\n\nSo, the total discount is 32.5%.\n\nIs there a way to calculate this directly?\n\nYes, the overall discount can be calculated by multiplying the retention rates.\n\nFirst discount is 25%, so the retention rate is 75% or 0.75.\n\nSecond discount is 10%, so the retention rate is 90% or 0.90.\n\nMultiply them: 0.75 * 0.90 = 0.675\n\nThis means the customer pays 67.5% of the original price.\n\nSo, 67.5% of $80 is $80 * 0.675 = $54, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the final price comes out to be $54.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if the discounts were applied in the reverse order.\n\nSuppose the 10% discount was applied first, followed by the 25% discount.\n\nFirst, 10% discount on $80.\n\n10% of $80 is $8.\n\nSo, $80 - $8 = $72.\n\nThen, 25% discount on $72.\n\n25% of $72 is $18.\n\nSo, $72 - $18 = $54.\n\nAgain, the final price is $54.\n\nInteresting, so regardless of the order in which the discounts are applied, the final price remains the same.\n\nThis makes sense because multiplication is commutative.\n\nThat is, 0.90 * 0.75 is the same as 0.75 * 0.90, both equal 0.675.\n\nTherefore, the final price is indeed $54.\n\nI don't think there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nSo, the answer is $54.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{54} \\]"
