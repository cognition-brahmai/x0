        "content": "So I've got this problem here about apples and probabilities. Let me see if I can figure this out. There are three types of apples: Fuji, Gala, and Granny Smith. The store has 20 Fuji apples, 15 Gala apples, and 25 Granny Smith apples. I need to find the probability of picking a Gala apple at random.\n\nFirst, I think I need to know the total number of apples in the store. To get that, I should add up all the apples of each type. So, 20 Fuji plus 15 Gala plus 25 Granny Smith. Let's do the math: 20 + 15 is 35, and then 35 + 25 is 60. So, there are 60 apples in total.\n\nNow, probability is usually calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is picking a Gala apple, and the total outcomes are all the apples.\n\nSo, the number of Gala apples is 15, and the total number of apples is 60. Therefore, the probability should be 15 divided by 60.\n\nLet me write that down: Probability = 15 / 60.\n\nHmm, that can be simplified. Both 15 and 60 can be divided by 15. So, 15 divided by 15 is 1, and 60 divided by 15 is 4. So, the simplified fraction is 1/4.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check. 15 divided by 60 is indeed 0.25, which is the same as 1/4.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should think about it another way. If there are 60 apples and 15 of them are Gala, then the chance of picking a Gala apple is 15 out of 60, which is indeed 1/4 or 25%.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to look at this. Could there be any dependency or other factors affecting the probability? The problem says \"choose one apple at random,\" so I think it's a straightforward calculation without any additional conditions.\n\nJust to make sure, let's imagine that I have a bag with 60 apples, 15 of which are Gala. If I pick one without looking, the probability should be 15/60, which is 1/4.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of percentages. 15 out of 60 is 25%, so the probability is 25%.\n\nWait, can I also express this probability in decimal form? I think so. 1/4 is equal to 0.25, which corresponds to 25%.\n\nSo, regardless of the form, it seems like the probability is 1/4, or 25%, or 0.25.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any chance that the types of apples are not equally likely to be chosen. The problem doesn't suggest any bias towards any type, so I think each apple has an equal chance of being picked.\n\nAlso, perhaps I should confirm if there are any apples that are mislabeled or anything like that, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I'll assume all apples are correctly labeled.\n\nLet me also consider if there is any replacement or sequential picking, but again, the problem says \"choose one apple at random,\" so it's a single pick.\n\nSo, I think my initial calculation is correct. The probability is 15/60, which simplifies to 1/4.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of proportions. The proportion of Gala apples in the store is 15 out of 60, which is again 1/4.\n\nI think I've confirmed this enough ways. The probability of picking a Gala apple is 1/4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}} \\]"
