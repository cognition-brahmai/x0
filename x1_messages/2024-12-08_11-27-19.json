        "content": "Let's see. So, in this town, there are 100 people, and half of them always tell the truth, and the other half always lie. I meet two residents, Alice and Bob. Alice says, \"At least one of us is a liar.\" I need to figure out if I can determine whether Alice or Bob is a liar or a truth-teller based on this statement.\n\nFirst, let's understand who these people are. Since half of the town always tells the truth and the other half always lies, Alice and Bob each could be either a truth-teller or a liar, but I don't know which is which yet.\n\nAlice says, \"At least one of us is a liar.\" Now, \"us\" means Alice and Bob together. So, the statement is about Alice and Bob.\n\nI need to consider the possible scenarios based on whether Alice is a truth-teller or a liar.\n\n**Case 1: Alice is a truth-teller.**\n\nIf Alice is a truth-teller, then she always tells the truth. Therefore, her statement \"At least one of us is a liar\" must be true.\n\nIf Alice is a truth-teller, then for the statement to be true, there must be at least one liar among Alice and Bob. But since Alice is a truth-teller, Bob must be the liar in this case.\n\nSo, if Alice is a truth-teller, then Bob is a liar.\n\n**Case 2: Alice is a liar.**\n\nIf Alice is a liar, then she always lies. Therefore, her statement \"At least one of us is a liar\" must be false.\n\nIf the statement is false, then it is not the case that at least one of them is a liar. That means neither Alice nor Bob is a liar.\n\nBut wait a minute, if Alice is a liar, then the statement is false, implying that neither of them is a liar. But if Alice is a liar, that contradicts the conclusion that neither is a liar because Alice would be a liar.\n\nThis is a contradiction. So, if Alice is a liar, her statement leads to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that Alice is a truth-teller, and Bob is a liar.\n\nWait, but let's double-check this.\n\nIf Alice is a truth-teller, and Bob is a liar, then Alice's statement \"At least one of us is a liar\" is true, which matches her being a truth-teller.\n\nIf Alice were a liar, her statement would be false, meaning neither is a liar, but that would mean Alice is not a liar, which contradicts the assumption that she is a liar.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that Alice is a truth-teller and Bob is a liar.\n\nSo, yes, it is possible to determine that Alice is a truth-teller and Bob is a liar based on Alice's statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yes, Alice is a truth-teller and Bob is a liar.}} \\]"
