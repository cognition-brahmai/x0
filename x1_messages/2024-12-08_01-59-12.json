        "content": "I'm going to try to tackle this problem step by step. So, the city is facing a housing shortage because of population growth due to job opportunities and economic growth. The government plans to build 10,000 new affordable housing units over the next five years. I need to calculate the total cost of constructing these units, considering land acquisition, infrastructure development, and construction expenses. Also, I have to estimate the impact on local property values and rental rates once these new units are completed.\n\nFirst, I need to estimate the cost of constructing these 10,000 affordable housing units. To do this, I should consider the average cost per unit for each component: land acquisition, infrastructure development, and actual construction.\n\nLet's start with the construction cost per unit. Affordable housing typically means that the construction costs are kept as low as possible while still providing decent living conditions. According to some sources, the average construction cost for affordable housing in urban areas can range from $100,000 to $150,000 per unit. For the sake of this calculation, I'll assume an average construction cost of $125,000 per unit.\n\nSo, for 10,000 units, the total construction cost would be:\n\n10,000 units * $125,000/unit = $1,250,000,000\n\nNext, I need to factor in land acquisition costs. The cost of land can vary widely depending on the location. In a city with high demand for land, acquisition costs can be significant. Let's assume that the city can acquire land at an average cost of $50,000 per unit. This is just an estimate, and actual costs could be higher or lower.\n\nSo, the total land acquisition cost would be:\n\n10,000 units * $50,000/unit = $500,000,000\n\nNow, infrastructure development costs need to be considered. This includes utilities, roads, sewage systems, and other public amenities required to support the new housing units. Infrastructure costs can also vary, but let's assume an average of $30,000 per unit.\n\nThus, the total infrastructure development cost would be:\n\n10,000 units * $30,000/unit = $300,000,000\n\nAdding up all these costs:\n\nConstruction: $1,250,000,000\n\nLand acquisition: $500,000,000\n\nInfrastructure: $300,000,000\n\nTotal cost = $1,250,000,000 + $500,000,000 + $300,000,000 = $2,050,000,000\n\nSo, the total cost of constructing these 10,000 affordable housing units would be approximately $2.05 billion.\n\nNow, I need to estimate the impact on local property values and rental rates once these new units are completed.\n\nThe impact of new affordable housing units on existing property values and rental rates can be complex and depends on several factors, including the current supply and demand dynamics, the quality of the new units, and the overall economic conditions of the city.\n\nGenerally, increasing the supply of housing can help alleviate pressure on prices, especially in a scenario where demand is outpacing supply, as is the case here. By adding 10,000 new affordable units, the city is increasing the housing stock, which could help to stabilize or even decrease rental rates and possibly slow down the appreciation of property values.\n\nHowever, affordable housing units are typically targeted at lower-income households, and their presence might not directly affect the higher-end real estate market. So, the impact might be more noticeable in the mid-to-lower range of the housing market.\n\nOn the other hand, if these new units are well-built and in desirable locations, they could attract a broader range of tenants, including those who might have considered more expensive options. This could have a broader impact on the market.\n\nAdditionally, the development of new housing can stimulate economic activity, improve the overall quality of the neighborhood, and potentially increase property values in the surrounding areas due to improved infrastructure and amenities.\n\nBut it's also possible that the addition of a large number of affordable units could saturate the lower-end rental market, leading to a decrease in rental rates for those properties.\n\nIn summary, the construction of 10,000 new affordable housing units is likely to have a moderating effect on rental rates and possibly slow down the rate of increase in property values, particularly in the mid-to-lower range of the market. However, the exact impact would depend on various factors and would need to be assessed through more detailed market analysis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2,050,000,000} \\]"
