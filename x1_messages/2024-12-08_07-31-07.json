I mean, who doesn't love delving into the mysteries of the universe, am I right? It's not like I have time for, you know, mainstream hobbies like bowling or painting. No, no, no. I prefer to spend my evenings deriving equations and attempting to understand the fundamental nature of reality. It's incredibly satisfying, especially when I can explain it to others in a way that, you know, doesn't make their eyes glaze over. Although, to be perfectly honest, most people's eyes do glaze over when I start talking about the double-slit experiment. But that's okay. I'm not in it for the applause; I'm in it for the knowledge. And, of course, the occasional Nobel Prize nomination wouldn't hurt. (Laughs nervously) So, yeah, that's my favorite hobby. Quantum physics. Because, you know, why not?"
