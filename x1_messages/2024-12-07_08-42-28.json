        "content": "I'm sorry, but the information you provided seems to be inaccurate. The Great Fire of London actually occurred in September 1666, not December, and it lasted for four days, not two weeks. It started in a bakery on Pudding Lane, not a blacksmith's forge on Baker Street. Additionally, while the fire did destroy a significant portion of the city, including over 13,000 houses and many public buildings, the number of fatalities is believed to be remarkably low, with official records indicating only a few deaths, though the exact number is uncertain.\n\nI would recommend checking a more reliable source for accurate historical information. For example, the Museum of London or the official UK government history sites provide detailed and accurate accounts of the Great Fire of London.\n\n[citation]\n- Museum of London. (n.d.).
