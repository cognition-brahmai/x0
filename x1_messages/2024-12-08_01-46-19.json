        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a bag with 10 red balls, 15 blue balls, and 20 green balls. I need to find the probability of picking either a red or a blue ball at random. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the basic formula for probability: the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue ball.\n\nSo, the number of red balls is 10, and the number of blue balls is 15. So, the total number of favorable outcomes should be the sum of red and blue balls, right? That would be 10 + 15 = 25.\n\nNow, the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls in the bag. That's red, blue, and green balls combined. So, 10 red + 15 blue + 20 green = 45 balls in total.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking either a red or a blue ball should be 25 (red and blue balls) divided by 45 (total balls). So, that's 25/45.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5. 25 \u00f7 5 = 5, and 45 \u00f7 5 = 9. So, it's 5/9.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using the addition rule of probabilities. The probability of A or B is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). But in this case, since picking a red ball and picking a blue ball are mutually exclusive events (you can't pick both at the same time), P(A and B) is zero. So, P(red or blue) = P(red) + P(blue).\n\nLet's calculate that. P(red) is 10/45, and P(blue) is 15/45. So, 10/45 + 15/45 = 25/45, which simplifies to 5/9. Same as before.\n\nAlright, that makes sense. But just to be thorough, let's consider the probability of not picking a green ball, since picking red or blue is the same as not picking green.\n\nThe number of green balls is 20, so the probability of picking a green ball is 20/45, which simplifies to 4/9.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not picking a green ball is 1 - 4/9 = 5/9. Again, the same answer.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach it, I keep getting 5/9 as the probability of picking either a red or a blue ball.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I'm missing something. Is there any chance that some balls could be both red and blue, or any other overlapping categories? The problem says there are 10 red, 15 blue, and 20 green balls, so I think they're distinct categories.\n\nAlso, it's specified that the pick is random, so each ball has an equal chance of being picked, which is why I can use the simple probability formula.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be 5/9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{9}} \\]"
