        "content": "I'm here to help with that question about the Energy Policy Act of 2005 in the United States. So, the primary goal of this act was to address various aspects of the country's energy policy, focusing on increasing energy independence and security. Let's look at the options provided:\n\nA. To diversify energy sources and reduce dependence on foreign oil\n\nB. To promote renewable energy sources only\n\nC. To phase out the use of fossil fuels by 2025\n\nD. To mandate the use of electric vehicles by 2030\n\nE. None of the above\n\nFirst, option A suggests that the act aimed to diversify energy sources and reduce dependence on foreign oil. This seems plausible because energy independence has been a\u957f\u671f\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9 in U.S. policy, especially regarding oil imports.\n\nOption B says the act was solely about promoting renewable energy sources. While renewable energy is a part of the policy, it might not be the only focus.\n\nOption C proposes phasing out fossil fuels by 2025. Given that the act was passed in 2005, and considering the state of energy technologies at that time, this seems ambitious and perhaps unlikely.\n\nOption D mentions mandating the use of electric vehicles by 2030. Again, given the time frame and the state of EV technology in 2005, this also seems improbable.\n\nOption E is a catch-all for none of the above.\n\nTo get a better understanding, let's recall what the Energy Policy Act of 2005 actually entailed. This act was indeed aimed at improving the energy security of the United States. It included provisions for increasing domestic energy production, improving energy efficiency, and promoting renewable energy sources.\n\nOne of the key focuses was on reducing dependence on foreign oil, which aligns with option A. The act encouraged the development of alternative and renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and biofuels, to decrease reliance on fossil fuels, particularly oil from unstable regions.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the act also included provisions for increasing the production of domestic fossil fuels, including oil and natural gas, through exploration and development on federal lands and offshore areas. So, while it promoted renewables, it also supported traditional energy sources.\n\nOption B is too narrow because the act wasn't exclusively about renewable energy; it had a broader scope.\n\nOption C about phasing out fossil fuels by 2025 seems unrealistic for 2005, as fossil fuels were and still are a major part of the U.S. energy mix. There was no such aggressive phase-out plan in the act.\n\nOption D about mandating electric vehicles by 2030 also doesn't seem to be a part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. While there might have been some provisions for encouraging alternative transportation fuels, a outright mandate for electric vehicles by 2030 doesn't ring a bell.\n\nTherefore, considering the content of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the primary goal was to diversify energy sources and reduce dependence on foreign oil, which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
