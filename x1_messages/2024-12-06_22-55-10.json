        "content": "Let's see. I'm walking at a constant pace of 3 miles per hour, and I want to know how far I'll have traveled after 45 minutes. Okay, first things first, I need to make sure that the units match. I have time in minutes and speed in miles per hour, so I should probably convert the time into hours.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 45 minutes is 45/60 hours. Let me calculate that:\n\n45 divided by 60 is 0.75, so 45 minutes is 0.75 hours.\n\nNow, I know that distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, if I'm going 3 miles per hour for 0.75 hours, the distance should be 3 times 0.75.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 3 times 0.75 is 2.25.\n\nSo, I would have traveled 2.25 miles in 45 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. If I'm walking at 3 miles per hour, that means in one hour I walk 3 miles. In half an hour, I would walk 1.5 miles. So, in 45 minutes, which is three-quarters of an hour, 3 times 0.75 should indeed be 2.25 miles.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and I'm walking at 3 miles per hour, that means per minute I'm walking 3/60 miles. Let's see: 3 divided by 60 is 0.05 miles per minute.\n\nSo, in 45 minutes, 45 times 0.05 miles should give me the same distance.\n\nLet's calculate that: 45 times 0.05 is 2.25 miles.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, so I'm confident that 2.25 miles is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.25 \\text{ miles}} \\]"
