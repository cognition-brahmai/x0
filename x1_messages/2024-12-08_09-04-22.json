        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a farmer who has both chickens and cows on his farm. He counts a total of 40 heads and 112 legs. We need to figure out how many chickens and how many cows there are.\n\nFirst, let's think about what we know:\n\n1. Chickens have 1 head each and 2 legs each.\n\n2. Cows have 1 head each and 4 legs each.\n\n3. Total heads: 40\n\n4. Total legs: 112\n\nSince each animal has one head, the total number of animals is 40. Now, we need to find out how many of these are chickens and how many are cows.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Let \\( c \\) be the number of chickens.\n\n- Let \\( k \\) be the number of cows.\n\nFrom the information given, we can set up two equations based on heads and legs.\n\nEquation 1: Total heads\n\n\\( c + k = 40 \\)\n\nEquation 2: Total legs\n\n\\( 2c + 4k = 112 \\)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the values of \\( c \\) and \\( k \\).\n\nOne way to solve this is by the substitution method. Let's solve Equation 1 for \\( c \\):\n\n\\( c = 40 - k \\)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( c \\) into Equation 2:\n\n\\( 2(40 - k) + 4k = 112 \\)\n\nLet's simplify and solve for \\( k \\):\n\n\\( 80 - 2k + 4k = 112 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 80 + 2k = 112 \\)\n\nSubtract 80 from both sides:\n\n\\( 2k = 32 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\( k = 16 \\)\n\nSo, there are 16 cows.\n\nNow, plug this value back into the expression for \\( c \\):\n\n\\( c = 40 - 16 = 24 \\)\n\nTherefore, there are 24 chickens and 16 cows.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it makes sense.\n\nTotal heads: \\( 24 + 16 = 40 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTotal legs: \\( 24 \\times 2 + 16 \\times 4 = 48 + 64 = 112 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out. So, the farmer has 24 chickens and 16 cows.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24 \\text{ chickens and } 16 \\text{ cows}} \\]"
