Contrary to the information provided, Lincoln was not the 17th president; that distinction belongs to Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln after his assassination. Lincoln's tenure as president was marked by the American Civil War and his efforts to preserve the Union.\n\nOne of Lincoln's most significant roles was leading the nation through the Civil War, which lasted from 1861 to 1865. He played a crucial part in maintaining the unity of the United States by suppressing the secessionist movement of the Southern states, which had formed the Confederate States of America. Lincoln's leadership during this tumultuous period was instrumental in preserving the Union.\n\nAnother pivotal role Lincoln assumed was the emancipation of slaves. He issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, which declared that all slaves in the Confederate states \"shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.\" This proclamation shifted the war's focus to include the abolition of slavery and paved the way for the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which formally abolished slavery throughout the United States.\n\nLincoln is also remembered for his Gettysburg Address, delivered on November 19, 1863, during the Civil War. This speech is considered one of the most iconic in American history, reaffirming the principles of human equality stated in the Declaration of Independence and redefining the purpose of the war.\n\nFurthermore, Lincoln's leadership extended to Reconstruction efforts aimed at reintegrating the Southern states back into the Union. He proposed lenient terms for the rebellious states, emphasizing reconciliation and unity.\n\nRegarding the Revolutionary War and the Bill of Rights, it's important to note that these are associated with earlier periods in American history. The Revolutionary War took place from 1775 to 1783, and the Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791, both preceding Lincoln's time by several decades.\n\nLincoln was indeed born on February 12, 1809, in a log cabin in Hardin County, Kentucky (now part of LaRue County), not in a two-story brick house in Illinois. He moved to Illinois in the 1830s and began his political career there.\n\nLastly, Lincoln did deliver a Farewell Address, but it was in 1861, not 1860. This address was given when he left Springfield, Illinois, to assume the presidency in Washington, D.C. In it, he expressed his feelings about leaving his home and friends and his commitment to preserving the Union.\n\nIn summary, Abraham Lincoln's significant roles during his presidency included leading the nation through the Civil War, emancipating slaves, delivering the Gettysburg Address, and guiding Reconstruction efforts. His leadership was pivotal in preserving the Union and advancing the cause of human freedom.\n\n**Citation:**\n\n- History.com Editors. \"Abraham Lincoln.\" History.com, A&E Television Networks, 2009, <https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/abraham-lincoln>."
