        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that the factory produces 250 widgets per hour. It operates 16 hours per day but is closed on Sundays. We need to find out how many widgets are produced in a week.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many days the factory is open in a week. Since it's closed on Sundays, that means it's open from Monday to Saturday. So, that's 6 days a week.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total number of hours the factory operates in a week. Since it's open 6 days a week and operates 16 hours each day, I can multiply 6 by 16 to get the total hours per week.\n\nTotal hours per week = 6 days * 16 hours/day = 96 hours.\n\nNow, since the factory produces 250 widgets per hour, I can find the total production by multiplying the number of hours per week by the production rate per hour.\n\nTotal widgets per week = 96 hours * 250 widgets/hour.\n\nLet me do that multiplication:\n\n96 * 250.\n\nWell, 100 * 250 is 25,000. But since 96 is 4 less than 100, I need to subtract 4 * 250 from 25,000.\n\n4 * 250 = 1,000.\n\nSo, 25,000 - 1,000 = 24,000.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 24,000 widgets in a week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's an easier way to calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nFirst, find the daily production:\n\n250 widgets/hour * 16 hours/day = 4,000 widgets/day.\n\nThen, multiply by the number of days in a week it's open:\n\n4,000 widgets/day * 6 days/week = 24,000 widgets/week.\n\nYeah, that matches my previous calculation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 24,000 widgets per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24000} \\]"
