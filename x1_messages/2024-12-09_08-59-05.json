It can create the Elixir of Life, which allows the drinker to live forever, and also produces the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone itself, which can transform any metal into pure gold. The stone plays a central role in the first book and movie of the series, where Harry Potter and his friends must prevent it from falling into the hands of the evil wizard, Voldemort.\n"
