Let's see, founded in 1851, named after a Native American tribe, located in Washington state, known for tech, coffee, and natural beauty. Hmm, that sounds a lot like Seattle to me.\n\nSeattle is indeed built on land that was home to the Duwamish and other Native American tribes, and it was named after Chief Sealth, a leader of the Duwamish and Suquamish tribes. It makes sense given the clues you provided.\n\nThe city is famous for being the home of companies like Amazon and Microsoft, which certainly fits the tech industry part. And let's not forget about Starbucks, which originated in Seattle and is a big part of its coffee culture. Plus, the city is surrounded by beautiful lakes, mountains, and the Puget Sound, so natural beauty is definitely a hallmark of Seattle.\n\nSo, putting all that together, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the city you're referring to is Seattle. Am I right?"
