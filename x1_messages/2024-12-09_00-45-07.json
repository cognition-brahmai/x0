        "content": "Let's see. There's a store having a sale where everything is discounted by 20%. I have an item that originally costs $80, and I want to know how much a customer would save after applying this discount.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 20% discount means. Percentage discount is a reduction in price based on a percentage of the original price. So, if something is 20% off, that means the customer pays only 80% of the original price because 100% - 20% = 80%.\n\nBut the question is asking for how much the customer saves, not how much they pay. So, I should focus on the discount amount, which is 20% of the original price.\n\nTo calculate 20% of $80, I can use the formula:\n\nDiscount Amount = (Discount Percentage / 100) * Original Price\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDiscount Amount = (20 / 100) * 80\n\nSimplifying that:\n\nDiscount Amount = 0.2 * 80\n\nDiscount Amount = 16\n\nSo, the customer saves $16 on the item.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Another way to look at it is to calculate what the customer pays after the discount and then subtract that from the original price to find the savings.\n\nIf the discount is 20%, then the customer pays 80% of the original price.\n\nSo, Amount Paid = (80 / 100) * 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64\n\nOriginal Price - Amount Paid = 80 - 64 = 16\n\nYes, same result. The customer saves $16.\n\nI can also think about it in terms of proportions. 20% of 80 should be the same as one fifth because 20% is equivalent to 1/5.\n\nSo, 1/5 of 80 is 16.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any catch or if there's more to this problem. Is there any additional tax or fees that might affect the savings? The problem doesn't mention anything about tax, so I can assume that the discount is directly applied to the original price without any additional costs.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies that it's a store-wide sale, so the discount applies uniformly to all items, including this particular item costing $80.\n\nTherefore, the customer saves $16 on this item during the sale.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
