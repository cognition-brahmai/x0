        "content": "So, in this class, there are 40 students, and 60% of them are female. First, I need to find out how many female students there are. To do that, I can calculate 60% of 40.\n\nLet me see: 60% of 40 is 0.6 times 40, which is 24. So, there are 24 female students.\n\nNow, it says there's an equal ratio of left-handed to right-handed females. That means the number of left-handed females is the same as the number of right-handed females.\n\nSo, if there are 24 female students in total, and they are split equally into left-handed and right-handed, then the number of left-handed females would be half of 24.\n\nHalf of 24 is 12.\n\nTherefore, there are 12 left-handed females in the class.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Let me double-check.\n\nWe have 40 students, 60% are female, which is 24 females.\n\nThe ratio of left-handed to right-handed females is equal, meaning they are equal in number.\n\nSo, yes, it's straightforward: 24 divided by 2 is 12.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
