        "content": "Let's see. There are five friends standing in a line facing forward: Alice, Bob, Eve, Dave, and Carol. I need to figure out who is standing at the farthest left based on the given positions.\n\nFirst, the statement says: \"Alice is standing to the left of Bob but to the right of Eve.\" So, from this, I can deduce that Eve is to the left of Alice, and Alice is to the left of Bob. So, the order so far is Eve, Alice, Bob.\n\nNext, it says: \"Dave is standing to the right of Carol but to the left of Eve.\" This means Carol is to the left of Dave, and Dave is to the left of Eve.\n\nNow, let's try to combine these pieces of information.\n\nFrom the first statement: Eve, Alice, Bob.\n\nFrom the second statement: Carol, Dave, Eve.\n\nSo, if Eve is after Dave, and Dave is after Carol, and Eve is before Alice and Bob, then the order should be Carol, Dave, Eve, Alice, Bob.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\n- Alice is to the left of Bob: yes, in this order, Alice is before Bob.\n\n- Alice is to the right of Eve: yes, Alice is after Eve.\n\n- Dave is to the right of Carol: yes, Dave is after Carol.\n\n- Dave is to the left of Eve: yes, Dave is before Eve.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nSo, the order from left to right is: Carol, Dave, Eve, Alice, Bob.\n\nTherefore, the person standing at the farthest left is Carol.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Carol}} \\]"
