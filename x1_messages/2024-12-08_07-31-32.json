        "content": "The phenomenon in which the phase velocity of light or other waves differs depending on its frequency is known as dispersion. So, the correct answer is D. Dispersion.\n\nTo elaborate a bit, dispersion occurs because the speed of a wave in a medium depends on its frequency. This frequency dependence leads to the separation of waves into components with different frequencies, which can be observed as a spectrum of colors in the case of light. A classic example of dispersion is the separation of white light into its constituent colors when passing through a prism, where each color corresponds to a different wavelength and thus a different phase velocity within the prism material.\n\nThe other options are important concepts in optics and photonics but describe different phenomena:\n\n- A. Interference: This is the phenomenon where two or more waves superpose to form a resultant wave of greater or lower amplitude.\n\n- B. Diffraction: This refers to the bending of waves around obstacles or through openings, which can lead to the spreading out of waves into regions of shadow.\n\n- C. Polarization: This is the property of waves that describes the direction of oscillation. In electromagnetic waves like light, polarization refers to the orientation of the electric field vector.\n\nSo, while all these phenomena are significant in the study of optics and photonics, it's dispersion that specifically deals with the variation of phase velocity with frequency."
