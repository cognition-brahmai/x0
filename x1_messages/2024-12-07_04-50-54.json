        "content": "So I've got this problem here. It says that in a room full of people, 40% have brown eyes, 30% have green eyes, and the remaining have blue eyes. And it tells me that 12 people have green eyes, and I need to find out how many people are in the room altogether.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I know that percentages represent parts of a whole, and in this case, the whole is the total number of people in the room, which is what I'm trying to find. Let's call the total number of people \"P.\"\n\nSo, 40% of P have brown eyes, 30% have green eyes, and the remaining percentage has blue eyes. It says that 12 people have green eyes, which is 30% of the total.\n\nSo, I can set up an equation based on that. If 30% of P equals 12, then:\n\n0.30 * P = 12\n\nNow, I need to solve for P. To do that, I can divide both sides of the equation by 0.30:\n\nP = 12 / 0.30\n\nLet me calculate that. 12 divided by 0.30 is the same as 12 divided by 3/10, which is the same as 12 multiplied by 10/3.\n\nSo, 12 * (10/3) = (12 * 10) / 3 = 120 / 3 = 40\n\nSo, P equals 40. That means there are 40 people in the room.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If there are 40 people in total, and 30% have green eyes, then 0.30 * 40 = 12, which matches the given information. Okay, that checks out.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's see how many have brown and blue eyes.\n\nBrown eyes: 40% of 40 is 0.40 * 40 = 16 people\n\nGreen eyes: already given as 12 people\n\nBlue eyes: the remaining percentage. Since 40% have brown and 30% have green, that's 70% altogether. So, the remaining percentage with blue eyes is 100% - 70% = 30%.\n\nSo, 30% of 40 is 0.30 * 40 = 12 people\n\nJust to verify, total people: 16 (brown) + 12 (green) + 12 (blue) = 40, which matches the total.\n\nSo, the answer is 40 people in the room.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
