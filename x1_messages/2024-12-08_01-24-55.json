While many spiders are known for their web-spinning abilities, there are numerous species that do not build webs at all or use them in different ways.\n\nFor example, hunting spiders like wolf spiders and jumping spiders actively hunt their prey instead of relying on webs. These spiders use their excellent vision and speed to catch insects.\n\nSome spiders use webs differently. Funnel-web spiders create funnel-shaped webs where they hide and wait for prey to come near. Trap-door spiders construct underground burrows with hinged lids, which they use to ambush passing insects.\n\nMoreover, there are social spiders that live in colonies and build large communal webs to capture prey collectively.\n\nSo, while web-spinning is a common trait among spiders, it's not universal, and spiders have evolved various strategies to catch their food."
