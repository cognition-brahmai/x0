        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 50 people in total, and everyone likes at least one of the two flavors: chocolate or vanilla ice cream. Out of these, 35 like chocolate and 25 like vanilla. But some people might like both, right? The question is asking how many people like both flavors.\n\nI think I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. It's a formula used to count the number of elements in the union of two sets, taking into account the elements that are in both sets.\n\nSo, the formula for the union of two sets A and B is:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nWhere:\n\n- |A \u222a B| is the number of people who like either chocolate or vanilla or both.\n\n- |A| is the number of people who like chocolate.\n\n- |B| is the number of people who like vanilla.\n\n- |A \u2229 B| is the number of people who like both chocolate and vanilla.\n\nIn this problem, we know that:\n\n- The total number of people is 50, and since everyone likes at least one flavor, |A \u222a B| = 50.\n\n- |A| = 35\n\n- |B| = 25\n\nWe need to find |A \u2229 B|, the number of people who like both flavors.\n\nSo, plugging the known values into the formula:\n\n50 = 35 + 25 - |A \u2229 B|\n\nNow, let's solve for |A \u2229 B|:\n\n50 = 60 - |A \u2229 B|\n\nSubtract 60 from both sides:\n\n50 - 60 = - |A \u2229 B|\n\n-10 = - |A \u2229 B|\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n10 = |A \u2229 B|\n\nSo, 10 people like both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nIf 35 people like chocolate and 25 like vanilla, and 10 like both, then the number of people who like only chocolate would be 35 - 10 = 25, and the number who like only vanilla would be 25 - 10 = 15. Adding those up: 25 (only chocolate) + 15 (only vanilla) + 10 (both) = 50, which matches the total number of people.\n\nSo, yes, 10 people like both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
