        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains: one going from City A to City B, and the other going from City B to City A. They both leave at the same time and take different amounts of time to reach their destinations. The first train takes 4 hours, and the second takes 6 hours. We need to find out where they cross paths.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the concept here. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds are adding up. But let's formalize this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Distance between City A and City B as D.\n\n- Speed of the first train as V1.\n\n- Speed of the second train as V2.\n\nWe know that:\n\nTime taken by first train: T1 = 4 hours.\n\nTime taken by second train: T2 = 6 hours.\n\nSo, their speeds can be expressed as:\n\nV1 = D / T1 = D / 4.\n\nV2 = D / T2 = D / 6.\n\nNow, since they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is V1 + V2.\n\nSo, relative speed = D/4 + D/6.\n\nTo add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 12.\n\nSo, D/4 = 3D/12.\n\nD/6 = 2D/12.\n\nTherefore, relative speed = 3D/12 + 2D/12 = 5D/12.\n\nNow, the time it takes for them to meet is the distance D divided by their relative speed.\n\nTime to meet, T = D / (5D/12) = D * (12)/(5D) = 12/5 hours, which is 2.4 hours.\n\nSo, they meet after 2.4 hours.\n\nNow, to find the point where they cross paths, we can calculate how far each train has traveled in 2.4 hours.\n\nFor the first train:\n\nDistance traveled = speed * time = (D/4) * 2.4 = (D/4) * (12/5) = (12D)/(20) = (3D)/5.\n\nSimilarly, for the second train:\n\nDistance traveled = (D/6) * 2.4 = (D/6) * (12/5) = (12D)/30 = (2D)/5.\n\nNow, let's check if these distances add up to D.\n\n(3D)/5 + (2D)/5 = (5D)/5 = D. Yes, they do.\n\nSo, the crossing point is (3D)/5 from City A towards City B.\n\nAlternatively, it's (2D)/5 from City B towards City A.\n\nBut perhaps we can express this in terms of the distance between the cities.\n\nIf we don't know D, but we want a specific point, maybe in terms of miles or kilometers, we'd need the actual distance between City A and City B.\n\nBut since we don't have that, we can express it as a fraction of the total distance.\n\nSo, they cross paths at 3/5 of the distance from City A to City B.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume a specific distance, say D miles, then the crossing point is (3D)/5 miles from City A.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the speeds.\n\nFirst train: D/4 miles per hour.\n\nSecond train: D/6 miles per hour.\n\nRelative speed: D/4 + D/6 = 5D/12 miles per hour.\n\nTime to meet: D / (5D/12) = 12/5 hours, as before.\n\nDistance traveled by first train: (D/4) * (12/5) = 3D/5.\n\nDistance traveled by second train: (D/6) * (12/5) = 2D/5.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think in terms of proportions.\n\nThe first train covers the entire distance in 4 hours, the second in 6 hours.\n\nThe time they travel before meeting is the same, t.\n\nIn that time, the first train covers V1 * t, and the second covers V2 * t.\n\nAnd V1 * t + V2 * t = D.\n\nSo, t = D / (V1 + V2).\n\nWhich is the same as above.\n\nSo, the crossing point is V1 * t = (D/4) * (D/(D/4 + D/6)).\n\nWait, let's simplify that.\n\nFirst, V1 + V2 = D/4 + D/6 = 5D/12.\n\nSo, t = D / (5D/12) = 12/5 hours.\n\nThen, distance from A is V1 * t = (D/4) * (12/5) = 3D/5.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think about their speeds and the time it takes for them to meet.\n\nThe first train covers D in 4 hours, so its speed is D/4.\n\nThe second train covers D in 6 hours, so its speed is D/6.\n\nThe time until they meet is the same for both, so we can set up the equation:\n\nDistance covered by first train + Distance covered by second train = D.\n\nSo, (D/4) * t + (D/6) * t = D.\n\nFactor out t:\n\nt * (D/4 + D/6) = D.\n\nSo, t * (5D/12) = D.\n\nTherefore, t = D / (5D/12) = 12/5 hours.\n\nThen, distance from A is (D/4) * (12/5) = 3D/5.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think about the ratios of their speeds.\n\nThe first train's speed is D/4, the second's is D/6.\n\nThe ratio of their speeds is (D/4) : (D/6) = (1/4) : (1/6).\n\nTo simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by 12:\n\n(1/4)*12 : (1/6)*12 = 3 : 2.\n\nSo, the speeds are in the ratio 3:2.\n\nTherefore, the distances they cover before meeting should also be in the ratio of their speeds, since they start at the same time and meet at the same time.\n\nTherefore, the distances are in the ratio 3:2.\n\nSo, the total parts are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nTherefore, the crossing point is 3/5 of the distance from A to B.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the time perspective.\n\nThe first train takes 4 hours to cover the whole distance.\n\nThe second train takes 6 hours to cover the whole distance.\n\nThe time until they meet is t.\n\nIn that time, the first train covers a fraction t/4 of the distance.\n\nThe second train covers a fraction t/6 of the distance.\n\nSince they meet, the sum of these fractions is 1:\n\nt/4 + t/6 = 1.\n\nFind a common denominator, which is 12.\n\n(3t)/12 + (2t)/12 = 1.\n\nSo, (5t)/12 = 1.\n\nTherefore, t = 12/5 hours.\n\nThen, the distance covered by the first train is (12/5)/4 * D = (12/20)D = (3/5)D.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, it seems consistent that they meet at 3/5 of the distance from A to B.\n\nAlternatively, if we assign a specific distance, say D = 120 miles (chosen because 120 is divisible by both 4 and 6).\n\nThen, first train's speed: 120/4 = 30 mph.\n\nSecond train's speed: 120/6 = 20 mph.\n\nRelative speed: 30 + 20 = 50 mph.\n\nTime to meet: 120 / 50 = 2.4 hours.\n\nDistance from A: 30 * 2.4 = 72 miles.\n\nDistance from B: 20 * 2.4 = 48 miles.\n\nAnd 72 + 48 = 120 miles, which checks out.\n\nSo, 72 miles from A, which is (72/120) = 0.6, or 3/5 of the total distance.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the harmonic mean.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the time to meet can be found using the harmonic mean of their times.\n\nBut that seems more complicated, and the previous methods are sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the crossing point is 3/5 of the distance from City A to City B.\n\nOr, if the distance is known, it's (3/5)*D.\n\nIf the distance is not known, we can express it as a fraction of the total distance.\n\nSo, the answer is that the trains cross paths at a point that is 3/5 of the distance from City A to City B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{5} \\text{ of the distance from City A to City B}} \\]"
