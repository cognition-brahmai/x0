        "content": "I'm here to help you with your question. So, you have a store that sells three types of items: type X, type Y, and type Z. Let's break down the information you've given me.\n\nFirst, there are 50 items of type X, each priced at $15. To find out how much revenue is generated from selling all the type X items, I need to multiply the number of items by the price per item. So, that would be 50 times $15.\n\nSimilarly, there are 70 items of type Y, each priced at $25. So, the revenue from type Y items would be 70 times $25.\n\nLastly, there are 30 items of type Z, each priced at $40. Therefore, the revenue from type Z items would be 30 times $40.\n\nTo find the total revenue generated by selling all the items, I need to add up the revenues from each type of item.\n\nLet me calculate this step by step.\n\nFirst, for type X:\n\n50 items * $15/item = $750\n\nNext, for type Y:\n\n70 items * $25/item = $1750\n\nThen, for type Z:\n\n30 items * $40/item = $1200\n\nNow, to find the total revenue, I'll add these amounts together:\n\n$750 + $1750 + $1200\n\nLet's add $750 and $1750 first:\n\n$750 + $1750 = $2500\n\nThen, add $1200 to that sum:\n\n$2500 + $1200 = $3700\n\nTherefore, the total revenue generated by selling all the items is $3700.\n\nI hope that makes sense! Let me know if you have any other questions or need further assistance."
