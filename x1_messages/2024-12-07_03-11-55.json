Seward under President Andrew Johnson and was initially referred to as \"Seward's Folly\" or \"Seward's Icebox\" due to its remote location and perceived lack of value. However, over time, Alaska has proven to be a valuable addition to the United States, rich in natural resources and scenic beauty. It officially became the 49th state on January 3, 1959.\n"
