        "content": "So the factory produces 500 units of product each day, and each unit needs 3 hours of labor. I need to find out how many hours of labor are required for 10 days of production.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many units are produced in 10 days. Since the factory makes 500 units per day, for 10 days it would be:\n\n500 units/day \u00d7 10 days = 5,000 units\n\nNow, each of these 5,000 units requires 3 hours of labor. So, to find the total labor hours needed, I can multiply the number of units by the labor hours per unit:\n\n5,000 units \u00d7 3 hours/unit = 15,000 hours\n\nTherefore, the factory requires 15,000 hours of labor for 10 days of production.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the daily labor hours and then multiply by the number of days.\n\nFirst, find the daily labor hours:\n\n500 units/day \u00d7 3 hours/unit = 1,500 hours/day\n\nThen, for 10 days:\n\n1,500 hours/day \u00d7 10 days = 15,000 hours\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, 15,000 hours is the correct total labor hours required for 10 days of production.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total labor hours per unit and scale it up for the number of days.\n\nBut anyway, both methods give me the same answer, so I'm confident that 15,000 hours is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15000} \\]"
