        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there are 20 people in a group, and everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total. Hmm, sounds like a classic problem in combinatorics.\n\nFirst off, I know that combinatorics is all about counting things, especially when it comes to combinations and permutations. In this case, since the order of handshaking doesn't matter\u2014meaning that a handshake between person A and person B is the same as a handshake between person B and person A\u2014it seems like I should be using combinations rather than permutations.\n\nSo, the formula for combinations is given by C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this scenario, n would be 20, since there are 20 people, and k would be 2, because a handshake involves two people.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers: C(20, 2) = 20! / (2!(20 - 2)!) = (20!)/(2! * 18!)\u201d.\n\nNow, calculating factorials can get really big really fast, but in this case, a lot of terms will cancel out. Let's see: 20! is 20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18!, and the 18! in the numerator and denominator will cancel each other out.\n\nSo, C(20, 2) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18!) / (2! \u00d7 18!)] = (20 \u00d7 19) / (2 \u00d7 1) = (380) / 2 = 190.\n\nAlright, so that's one way to think about it, using the combination formula. But I should probably consider if there are other approaches to confirm that this is the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to think about it sequentially. Starting with the first person, they shake hands with 19 other people. Then, the second person has already shaken hands with the first person, so they shake hands with 18 remaining people. The third person has already shaken hands with the first two, so they shake hands with 17 people, and so on, until the last person, who doesn't need to shake hands with anyone because they've already shaken hands with everyone else.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be 19 + 18 + 17 + ... + 1.\n\nThis is an arithmetic series where the first term a1 is 19, the last term an is 1, and the number of terms is 19.\n\nThe sum S of an arithmetic series is given by S = n/2 \u00d7 (a1 + an).\n\nSo, S = 19/2 \u00d7 (19 + 1) = (19/2) \u00d7 20 = 19 \u00d7 10 = 190.\n\nOkay, that matches the previous result, which is a good sign.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using graph theory. If we consider each person as a vertex in a graph, and each handshake as an edge connecting two vertices, then the problem reduces to finding the number of edges in a complete graph with 20 vertices.\n\nIn graph theory, a complete graph with n vertices has C(n, 2) edges, which again is n(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 20, number of edges = 20\u00d719/2 = 190.\n\nYet another confirmation.\n\nLet me think if there's a possibility that I'm missing something. For example, maybe someone might argue that handshakes can happen in pairs, so perhaps it's different. But no, because each handshake is unique and involves exactly two people, and we're counting unique pairs.\n\nAlternatively, if we think about it in terms of each person choosing another person to shake hands with, but again, since the order doesn't matter, it's still a combination.\n\nWait a minute, what if we consider that some handshakes might be simultaneous? Like, multiple handshakes happening at the same time. But the problem states that everyone shakes hands with everyone else once, without specifying the timing, so I think the combinatorial approach is still valid.\n\nAnother angle: what if there are people who don't shake hands with each other? But the problem says everyone shakes hands with everyone else once, so no, that's not the case.\n\nIs there a recursive way to think about this? For example, for n people, the number of handshakes is the number of handshakes for (n-1) people plus the handshakes that the nth person makes.\n\nSo, for n = 1, no handshakes.\n\nFor n = 2, 1 handshake.\n\nFor n = 3, the third person shakes hands with 2 others, so total handshakes are 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nFor n = 4, the fourth person shakes hands with 3 others, total handshakes are 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nContinuing this pattern:\n\nn = 5: 6 (previous) + 4 = 10\n\nn = 6: 10 + 5 = 15\n\nand so on, up to n = 20.\n\nThis seems to match the triangular number sequence, where the nth triangular number is n(n-1)/2.\n\nFor n = 20, it would be 20\u00d719/2 = 190, again confirming the earlier result.\n\nSo, all these different approaches\u2014combinations, arithmetic series, graph theory, and recursion\u2014are pointing to the same answer: 190 handshakes.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the most appropriate answer is 190 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{190} \\]"
