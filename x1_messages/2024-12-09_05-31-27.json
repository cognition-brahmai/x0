        "content": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, you need to calculate the area of all six faces and then add them together. The formula for the surface area (SA) is:\n\nSA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.\n\nGiven the dimensions:\n\n- Length (l) = 5 cm\n\n- Width (w) = 3 cm\n\n- Height (h) = 8 cm\n\nFirst, calculate the area of the front and back faces:\n\n2lw = 2 * 5 cm * 3 cm = 30 cm\u00b2\n\nNext, calculate the area of the left and right faces:\n\n2lh = 2 * 5 cm * 8 cm = 80 cm\u00b2\n\nThen, calculate the area of the top and bottom faces:\n\n2wh = 2 * 3 cm * 8 cm = 48 cm\u00b2\n\nFinally, add all these areas together to get the total surface area:\n\nSA = 30 cm\u00b2 + 80 cm\u00b2 + 48 cm\u00b2 = 158 cm\u00b2\n\nSo, the surface area of the rectangular prism is 158 square centimeters."
