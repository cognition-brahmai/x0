        "content": "So I have this problem here: there's a cone with a radius of 4 cm and a height of 6 cm, and I need to find its volume in cubic centimeters. I remember that the volume of a cone is given by a specific formula, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. I think it involves the radius and the height, and maybe there's a \u03c0 in there somewhere.\n\nLet me try to recall the formula. I think it's something like V equals \u03c0 times the radius squared times the height, but I'm not sure if that's exactly right. Wait, I think there's a one-third somewhere in the formula. So, maybe it's V equals one-third times \u03c0 times the radius squared times the height. That sounds familiar.\n\nTo make sure, I should probably look up the formula for the volume of a cone. But since I'm supposed to solve this problem, I'll try to work with what I remember. So, if the formula is V equals one-third \u03c0 r squared h, then I can plug in the values for the radius and the height.\n\nGiven that the radius r is 4 cm and the height h is 6 cm, I can substitute these values into the formula. So, V equals one-third times \u03c0 times 4 squared times 6.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate 4 squared. 4 squared is 16. So now, V equals one-third times \u03c0 times 16 times 6.\n\nNext, I can multiply 16 by 6, which is 96. So now, V equals one-third times \u03c0 times 96.\n\nNow, one-third of 96 is 32. So, V equals 32 times \u03c0.\n\nI know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159, so I could multiply 32 by 3.14159 to get the volume in cubic centimeters. Let me do that.\n\n32 times 3.14159 is approximately 100.53088.\n\nSo, the volume of the cone is approximately 100.53 cubic centimeters.\n\nBut maybe I should check if my formula was correct. Let me recall: the volume of a cone is indeed one-third the volume of a cylinder with the same radius and height. The volume of a cylinder is \u03c0 r squared h, so one-third of that would be the volume of the cone.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, my formula was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the cone's volume in terms of integration, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the volume of the cone as limiting case of pyramids. I know that the volume of a pyramid is one-third the base area times the height, and a cone can be considered a pyramid with a circular base.\n\nSo, in this case, the base area is \u03c0 r squared, and the height is h, so the volume would be one-third times \u03c0 r squared times h, which matches the formula I used.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that my calculation is correct.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check my multiplication. Let's see: 4 squared is 16, and 16 times 6 is 96. One-third of 96 is 32, and 32 times \u03c0 is 32\u03c0.\n\nIf I use \u03c0 approximately equal to 3.14159, then 32 times 3.14159 is indeed approximately 100.53088, which rounds to about 100.53 cubic centimeters.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to express the volume in terms of \u03c0, it would be 32\u03c0 cubic centimeters, which is an exact value.\n\nBut since the problem asks for the volume in cubic centimeters, it's probably expected to use the approximate numerical value.\n\nHowever, sometimes problems specify whether to leave the answer in terms of \u03c0 or to use a numerical approximation. In this case, since it says \"in cubic centimeters,\" I think providing the numerical value is appropriate.\n\nBut to be thorough, I could also provide the exact value in terms of \u03c0. So, the volume is 32\u03c0 cubic centimeters, which is approximately 100.53 cubic centimeters.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. The problem seems straightforward once I recall the formula for the volume of a cone.\n\nJust to summarize:\n\n- Formula for the volume of a cone: V = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h\n\n- Given: r = 4 cm, h = 6 cm\n\n- V = (1/3)\u03c0(4)^2(6) = (1/3)\u03c0(16)(6) = (1/3)\u03c0(96) = 32\u03c0 \u2248 100.53 cubic centimeters\n\nYes, that's clear. I think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32\\pi \\text{ or approximately } 100.53 \\text{ cubic centimeters}} \\]"
