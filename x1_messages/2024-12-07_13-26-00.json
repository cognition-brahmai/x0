        "content": "Sure! I can help you develop a Node.js application that reads JSON data from a REST API, filters it based on a specific criterion (like items with a price greater than $100), and then prints the filtered results. We'll use the `axios` library to make HTTP requests and handle the JSON data.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).\n\nNext, create a new directory for your project and initialize a new Node.js project by running:\n\n```bash\nmkdir filter-api-data\ncd filter-api-data\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nNow, install the `axios` package, which we'll use to make HTTP requests:\n\n```bash\nnpm install axios\n```\n\nCreate a new file called `app.js` in your project directory. This is where we'll write our application code.\n\nOpen `app.js` and start by requiring the `axios` module:\n\n```javascript\nconst axios = require('axios');\n```\n\nNext, define the URL of the REST API you want to fetch data from. For this example, let's assume we're using a sample API like JSONPlaceholder, which provides dummy data for testing purposes. We'll fetch data from the `/posts` endpoint.\n\n```javascript\nconst apiURL = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts';\n```\n\nNow, write a function to fetch the data from the API:\n\n```javascript\nasync function fetchData() {\n  try {\n    const response = await axios.get(apiURL);\n    return response.data;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);\n    return [];\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSince JSONPlaceholder doesn't have a \"price\" field in its posts data, we'll assume that each post has a \"price\" property for the sake of this example. If you're using a different API, make sure it has the necessary fields.\n\nNext, write a function to filter the data based on the price criterion:\n\n```javascript\nfunction filterData(data, minPrice) {\n  return data.filter(item => item.price > minPrice);\n}\n```\n\nNow, combine these functions to fetch the data, filter it, and print the results:\n\n```javascript\nasync function main() {\n  const data = await fetchData();\n  const minPrice = 100;\n  const filteredData = filterData(data, minPrice);\n  console.log('Filtered Data:');\n  console.log(filteredData);\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nIf you run this code now, it will fetch the posts from JSONPlaceholder, filter them based on a hypothetical \"price\" field greater than $100, and print the filtered results.\n\nHowever, since JSONPlaceholder's posts don't actually have a \"price\" field, you'll need to adjust the API URL or modify the data to include a \"price\" field for testing purposes.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a different API that provides data with a \"price\" field, such as an e-commerce API.\n\nHere's the complete code in `app.js`:\n\n```javascript\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\nconst apiURL = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts';\n\nasync function fetchData() {\n  try {\n    const response = await axios.get(apiURL);\n    return response.data;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);\n    return [];\n  }\n}\n\nfunction filterData(data, minPrice) {\n  return data.filter(item => item.price > minPrice);\n}\n\nasync function main() {\n  const data = await fetchData();\n  const minPrice = 100;\n  const filteredData = filterData(data, minPrice);\n  console.log('Filtered Data:');\n  console.log(filteredData);\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nTo run the application, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nnode app.js\n```\n\nThis will output the filtered data to the console.\n\nIf you're using a different API, make sure to update the `apiURL` and adjust the `filterData` function accordingly based on the structure of the API's JSON response.\n\nI hope this helps!
