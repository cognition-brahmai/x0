        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a man who spends parts of his salary on different things, and we need to find out his monthly salary based on what he spends on miscellaneous expenses.\n\nFirst, let's list out all his expenses:\n\n- Rent: 1/3 of his salary\n\n- Groceries: 1/4 of his salary\n\n- Transportation: 1/5 of his salary\n\n- Miscellaneous: The rest, which is $600\n\nOur goal is to find his total monthly salary. Let's denote his salary as \"s.\"\n\nFirst, we need to find out what fraction of his salary he spends on miscellaneous expenses. Since miscellaneous is what's left after spending on rent, groceries, and transportation, we can calculate it by subtracting the sum of the fractions spent on rent, groceries, and transportation from 1 (which represents the whole salary).\n\nSo, the fraction spent on miscellaneous is:\n\n1 - (1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5)\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The denominators are 3, 4, and 5. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is 60.\n\nLet's convert each fraction to have a denominator of 60:\n\n- 1/3 = 20/60\n\n- 1/4 = 15/60\n\n- 1/5 = 12/60\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n20/60 + 15/60 + 12/60 = 47/60\n\nSo, the fraction of the salary spent on rent, groceries, and transportation is 47/60.\n\nTherefore, the fraction spent on miscellaneous is:\n\n1 - 47/60 = 60/60 - 47/60 = 13/60\n\nNow, we know that the miscellaneous expenses, which are 13/60 of his salary, amount to $600.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n(13/60) * s = 600\n\nOur task is to solve for s.\n\nTo isolate s, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 13/60, which is 60/13.\n\nSo,\n\ns = 600 * (60/13)\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication:\n\n600 * 60 = 36,000\n\nThen, divide by 13:\n\n36,000 \u00f7 13 = 2,769.230769230769\n\nRounding to two decimal places, s \u2248 2,769.23\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let's double-check the calculation.\n\nActually, 36,000 divided by 13 is approximately 2,769.23, but let's verify if this makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that 13/60 of s is 600, so s = 600 * (60/13)\n\nLet me calculate it again:\n\n600 * 60 = 36,000\n\n36,000 \u00f7 13 = ?\n\nLet me do the division step by step.\n\n13 * 2769 = 13 * 2000 = 26,000\n\n13 * 700 = 9,100\n\n13 * 69 = 897\n\nTotal: 26,000 + 9,100 = 35,100\n\n36,000 - 35,100 = 900\n\n13 * 69 = 897\n\nSo, 2769 * 13 = 35,997\n\nBut 36,000 - 35,997 = 3\n\nSo, s = 2769 + 3/13 \u2248 2769.23\n\nHmm, but I feel like there might be a better way to handle this without dealing with decimals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that s = 600 * (60/13)\n\nWhich is s = (600 * 60) / 13\n\nCalculating 600 * 60 = 36,000\n\n36,000 \u00f7 13 = ?\n\nLet me see, 13 * 2769 = 35,997\n\nSo, s = 2769 + 3/13\n\nBut in financial contexts, salaries are usually expressed in dollars and cents, so 2769.23 seems acceptable.\n\nHowever, maybe I should check if there's a way to avoid the fraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the fractions.\n\nLet me double-check the fraction for miscellaneous expenses.\n\nTotal fraction spent on rent, groceries, and transportation:\n\n1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5\n\nUsing LCM 60:\n\n20/60 + 15/60 + 12/60 = 47/60\n\nThen, miscellaneous is 13/60, which matches what I had earlier.\n\nSo, the equation (13/60)s = 600 seems correct.\n\nTherefore, s = 600 * (60/13) = 36,000 / 13 \u2248 2769.23\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can cross-multiply to solve for s.\n\nStarting from (13/60)s = 600\n\nMultiply both sides by 60/13:\n\ns = 600 * (60/13)\n\nWhich again gives s = 36,000 / 13 \u2248 2769.23\n\nAlternatively, to avoid decimals, perhaps I can express s as a fraction.\n\ns = 36,000 / 13 = 2769 3/13\n\nBut in practical terms, it's more useful to express it in decimal form.\n\nTherefore, his monthly salary is approximately $2,769.23\n\nBut let's verify if this makes sense.\n\nIf s = 2769.23\n\nThen:\n\nRent: (1/3)*2769.23 \u2248 923.08\n\nGroceries: (1/4)*2769.23 \u2248 692.31\n\nTransportation: (1/5)*2769.23 \u2248 553.85\n\nTotal of these three: 923.08 + 692.31 + 553.85 \u2248 2169.24\n\nThen, miscellaneous: 2769.23 - 2169.24 \u2248 600\n\nWhich matches the given miscellaneous expense.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the man's monthly salary is approximately $2,769.23\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2769.23} \\]"
