        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Java program that simulates a bank account system. It needs to handle creating accounts, depositing money, withdrawing money, and transferring money between accounts. And, to make it more interesting, I have to use multithreading to handle concurrent transactions safely. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst things first, I need to design the structure of the bank account system. Each account should have some basic properties like an account number, account holder's name, and balance. I'll probably create a class called `BankAccount` to represent each account.\n\nNow, for the operations:\n\n1. **Creating accounts**: I need a way to generate unique account numbers and store the account objects somewhere, maybe in a list or a map for faster access.\n\n2. **Depositing money**: This should add a certain amount to the account's balance.\n\n3. **Withdrawing money**: This should subtract a certain amount from the account's balance, but only if there's sufficient balance.\n\n4. **Transferring money**: This involves withdrawing from one account and depositing into another. This needs to be handled carefully to ensure that the transfer is atomic, meaning that both operations succeed or fail together.\n\nSince the system needs to handle concurrent transactions, I have to make sure that multiple threads can access and modify the accounts without causing data inconsistencies. This is where multithreading and synchronization come into play.\n\nI need to think about how to synchronize the access to the account balances so that when one thread is updating a balance, no other thread can modify it at the same time. Java provides several ways to achieve this, such as using synchronized methods or blocks, or using higher-level concurrency utilities like `ReentrantLock`.\n\nLet me consider using synchronized methods for simplicity. I can make the deposit, withdraw, and transfer methods synchronized in the `BankAccount` class to ensure that only one thread can execute these methods on a particular account at a time.\n\nBut wait, for transfer between two accounts, I need to lock both accounts to prevent race conditions. For example, if two threads try to transfer money between the same two accounts simultaneously, I need to make sure that the transfers are serialized to avoid inconsistencies.\n\nTo handle this, I can adopt a strategy where I always lock the accounts in a specific order based on their account numbers. For instance, when transferring from account A to account B, I first lock the account with the smaller account number, then the larger one. This way, I can prevent deadlocks.\n\nNow, let's think about the overall structure of the program.\n\nI'll need a `Bank` class that manages all the accounts. It can have a map that stores account numbers and their corresponding `BankAccount` objects.\n\nThe `Bank` class can provide methods like `createAccount`, `getAccount`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `transfer`.\n\nSince multiple threads will be accessing these methods concurrently, I need to synchronize access to the shared data structures, like the map of accounts.\n\nFor the `createAccount` method, I need to generate unique account numbers. I can use a static variable in the `Bank` class to keep track of the last assigned account number and increment it for each new account.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing the `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `transfer` methods.\n\n- **Deposit**: Given an account number and an amount, add the amount to the account's balance.\n\n- **Withdraw**: Given an account number and an amount, subtract the amount from the account's balance if sufficient funds are available.\n\n- **Transfer**: Given two account numbers and an amount, withdraw the amount from one account and deposit it into the other.\n\nFor transfer, as I mentioned earlier, I need to lock both accounts in a specific order to avoid deadlocks.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline of the classes and methods.\n\nFirst, the `BankAccount` class:\n\n```java\npublic class BankAccount {\n    private String accountNumber;\n    private String accountHolderName;\n    private double balance;\n\n    public BankAccount(String accountNumber, String accountHolderName, double initialBalance) {\n        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;\n        this.accountHolderName = accountHolderName;\n        this.balance = initialBalance;\n    }\n\n    public synchronized void deposit(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0) {\n            balance += amount;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public synchronized boolean withdraw(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0 && balance >= amount) {\n            balance -= amount;\n            return true;\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Getters for account details\n}\n```\n\nNext, the `Bank` class:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\npublic class Bank {\n    private Map<String, BankAccount> accounts;\n    private static int lastAccountNumber;\n\n    public Bank() {\n        accounts = new HashMap<>();\n        lastAccountNumber = 0;\n    }\n\n    public String createAccount(String accountHolderName, double initialBalance) {\n        lastAccountNumber++;\n        String accountNumber = \"ACC\" + lastAccountNumber;\n        BankAccount newAccount = new BankAccount(accountNumber, accountHolderName, initialBalance);\n        accounts.put(accountNumber, newAccount);\n        return accountNumber;\n    }\n\n    public BankAccount getAccount(String accountNumber) {\n        return accounts.get(accountNumber);\n    }\n\n    public void deposit(String accountNumber, double amount) {\n        BankAccount account = accounts.get(accountNumber);\n        if (account != null) {\n            account.deposit(amount);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public boolean withdraw(String accountNumber, double amount) {\n        BankAccount account = accounts.get(accountNumber);\n        if (account != null) {\n            return account.withdraw(amount);\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    public boolean transfer(String fromAccountNumber, String toAccountNumber, double amount) {\n        BankAccount fromAccount = accounts.get(fromAccountNumber);\n        BankAccount toAccount = accounts.get(toAccountNumber);\n\n        if (fromAccount != null && toAccount != null) {\n            // Lock both accounts in order of account number\n            BankAccount firstAccount = fromAccountNumber.compareTo(toAccountNumber) < 0 ? fromAccount : toAccount;\n            BankAccount secondAccount = fromAccountNumber.compareTo(toAccountNumber) < 0 ? toAccount : fromAccount;\n\n            synchronized (firstAccount) {\n                synchronized (secondAccount) {\n                    if (fromAccount.withdraw(amount)) {\n                        toAccount.deposit(amount);\n                        return true;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this setup, the `Bank` class manages all the accounts, and the `BankAccount` class represents individual accounts.\n\nFor the transfer method, I'm locking the accounts in order of their account numbers to prevent deadlocks.\n\nNow, to test this system with multithreading, I can create multiple threads that perform deposit, withdraw, and transfer operations concurrently.\n\nI need to ensure that after all transactions, the total balance in the bank remains consistent.\n\nLet me think about how to set up the testing scenario.\n\nI can create a few bank accounts and then spawn multiple threads that attempt to perform various transactions on these accounts.\n\nTo simulate concurrency, I can have multiple threads trying to deposit, withdraw, or transfer money at the same time.\n\nI should also keep track of the expected balances and verify them after all transactions are complete.\n\nLet me sketch a simple test class:\n\n```java\npublic class BankSystemTest {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Bank bank = new Bank();\n\n        // Create some accounts\n        String acc1 = bank.createAccount(\"Alice\", 1000);\n        String acc2 = bank.createAccount(\"Bob\", 500);\n        String acc3 = bank.createAccount(\"Charlie\", 750);\n\n        // Define some transactions\n        Runnable depositTask = () -> bank.deposit(acc1, 100);\n        Runnable withdrawTask = () -> bank.withdraw(acc2, 50);\n        Runnable transferTask = () -> bank.transfer(acc1, acc3, 200);\n\n        // Create multiple threads for each type of transaction\n        Thread threads[] = new Thread[10];\n        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n            threads[i] = new Thread(() -> {\n                // Randomly choose a task to perform\n                Runnable task = switch ((int) (Math.random() * 3)) {\n                    case 0 -> depositTask;\n                    case 1 -> withdrawTask;\n                    default -> transferTask;\n                };\n                task.run();\n            });\n            threads[i].start();\n        }\n\n        // Wait for all threads to finish\n        for (Thread thread : threads) {\n            try {\n                thread.join();\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Verify balances\n        System.out.println(\"Final balances:\");\n        System.out.println(\"Alice: \" + bank.getAccount(acc1).getBalance());\n        System.out.println(\"Bob: \" + bank.getAccount(acc2).getBalance());\n        System.out.println(\"Charlie: \" + bank.getAccount(acc3).getBalance());\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this test, I'm creating three accounts for Alice, Bob, and Charlie with initial balances. Then, I define some tasks for deposit, withdraw, and transfer. I create multiple threads that randomly choose one of these tasks to perform.\n\nAfter all threads have completed their executions, I print out the final balances to verify that everything worked as expected.\n\nHowever, to make this more robust, I should track the expected balances manually and compare them with the actual balances in the bank accounts.\n\nAlso, I should handle cases where withdrawals or transfers fail due to insufficient funds.\n\nMoreover, I might want to parameterize the transactions or randomize the amounts to make the test more comprehensive.\n\nBut for a starting point, this seems acceptable.\n\nLet me think about potential issues.\n\nOne issue could be that if multiple threads are trying to withdraw from the same account, and the account doesn't have sufficient balance, some withdrawals might fail. I need to make sure that the balance is correctly managed in such scenarios.\n\nAnother issue is that transfers involve two accounts, so locking both accounts in a specific order is crucial to prevent deadlocks.\n\nAlso, I should consider what happens if a thread is interrupted or an exception occurs during a transaction. I need to make sure that the system remains in a consistent state.\n\nTo handle exceptions, I can add try-catch blocks in the transaction tasks and perhaps log any errors.\n\nAdditionally, I can add some synchronization in the `Bank` class to protect the `accounts` map, in case accounts are being created or accessed concurrently.\n\nWait, in the current implementation, the `accounts` map is not synchronized. If multiple threads are trying to create accounts simultaneously, there might be inconsistencies in assigning unique account numbers.\n\nTo fix this, I can synchronize the `createAccount` method in the `Bank` class.\n\nLet me adjust the `Bank` class accordingly.\n\n```java\npublic class Bank {\n    private Map<String, BankAccount> accounts;\n    private static int lastAccountNumber;\n\n    public Bank() {\n        accounts = new HashMap<>();\n        lastAccountNumber = 0;\n    }\n\n    public synchronized String createAccount(String accountHolderName, double initialBalance) {\n        lastAccountNumber++;\n        String accountNumber = \"ACC\" + lastAccountNumber;\n        BankAccount newAccount = new BankAccount(accountNumber, accountHolderName, initialBalance);\n        accounts.put(accountNumber, newAccount);\n        return accountNumber;\n    }\n\n    public BankAccount getAccount(String accountNumber) {\n        return accounts.get(accountNumber);\n    }\n\n    public synchronized void deposit(String accountNumber, double amount) {\n        BankAccount account = accounts.get(accountNumber);\n        if (account != null) {\n            account.deposit(amount);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public synchronized boolean withdraw(String accountNumber, double amount) {\n        BankAccount account = accounts.get(accountNumber);\n        if (account != null) {\n            return account.withdraw(amount);\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    public synchronized boolean transfer(String fromAccountNumber, String toAccountNumber, double amount) {\n        BankAccount fromAccount = accounts.get(fromAccountNumber);\n        BankAccount toAccount = accounts.get(toAccountNumber);\n\n        if (fromAccount != null && toAccount != null) {\n            // Lock both accounts in order of account number\n            BankAccount firstAccount = fromAccountNumber.compareTo(toAccountNumber) < 0 ? fromAccount : toAccount;\n            BankAccount secondAccount = fromAccountNumber.compareTo(toAccountNumber) < 0 ? toAccount : fromAccount;\n\n            synchronized (firstAccount) {\n                synchronized (secondAccount) {\n                    if (fromAccount.getBalance() >= amount) {\n                        fromAccount.withdraw(amount);\n                        toAccount.deposit(amount);\n                        return true;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy synchronizing the `createAccount`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `transfer` methods in the `Bank` class, I ensure that only one thread can access the `accounts` map at a time, preventing race conditions.\n\nIn the `transfer` method, I first synchronize on the `Bank` object to access the `accounts` map, then additionally synchronize on the individual accounts to perform the transfer.\n\nThis should provide the necessary thread safety.\n\nHowever, synchronizing the entire `Bank` class methods might lead to performance bottlenecks if there are many concurrent transactions, as only one thread can execute these methods at a time.\n\nTo improve concurrency, I can consider synchronizing only the critical sections where shared data is accessed or modified.\n\nFor example, in the `transfer` method, I can remove the synchronization from the `Bank` class methods and rely solely on locking the individual accounts.\n\nBut, I need to ensure that when accessing the `accounts` map, it is done in a thread-safe manner.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a `ConcurrentHashMap` instead of a regular `HashMap`.\n\nLet me adjust the `Bank` class to use a `ConcurrentHashMap`.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;\n\npublic class Bank {\n    private ConcurrentHashMap<String, BankAccount> accounts;\n    private static AtomicInteger lastAccountNumber;\n\n    public Bank() {\n        accounts = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();\n        lastAccountNumber = new AtomicInteger(0);\n    }\n\n    public String createAccount(String accountHolderName, double initialBalance) {\n        int accountNumberInt = lastAccountNumber.incrementAndGet();\n        String accountNumber = \"ACC\" + accountNumberInt;\n        BankAccount newAccount = new BankAccount(accountNumber, accountHolderName, initialBalance);\n        accounts.put(accountNumber, newAccount);\n        return accountNumber;\n    }\n\n    public BankAccount getAccount(String accountNumber) {\n        return accounts.get(accountNumber);\n    }\n\n    public void deposit(String accountNumber, double amount) {\n        BankAccount account = accounts.get(accountNumber);\n        if (account != null) {\n            account.deposit(amount);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public boolean withdraw(String accountNumber, double amount) {\n        BankAccount account = accounts.get(accountNumber);\n        if (account != null) {\n            return account.withdraw(amount);\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    public boolean transfer(String fromAccountNumber, String toAccountNumber, double amount) {\n        BankAccount fromAccount = accounts.get(fromAccountNumber);\n        BankAccount toAccount = accounts.get(toAccountNumber);\n\n        if (fromAccount != null && toAccount != null) {\n            // Lock both accounts in order of account number\n            BankAccount firstAccount = fromAccountNumber.compareTo(toAccountNumber) < 0 ? fromAccount : toAccount;\n            BankAccount secondAccount = fromAccountNumber.compareTo(toAccountNumber) < 0 ? toAccount : fromAccount;\n\n            synchronized (firstAccount) {\n                synchronized (secondAccount) {\n                    if (fromAccount.getBalance() >= amount) {\n                        fromAccount.withdraw(amount);\n                        toAccount.deposit(amount);\n                        return true;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy using a `ConcurrentHashMap`, I can ensure that the `accounts` map is thread-safe for concurrent access.\n\nAlso, I replaced the static `lastAccountNumber` with an `AtomicInteger` to handle incrementing in a thread-safe manner.\n\nThis should improve concurrency compared to synchronizing the entire `Bank` class methods.\n\nNow, in the `transfer` method, I'm relying on locking the individual accounts in a specific order to prevent deadlocks.\n\nThis approach should work, but I need to make sure that all transfer operations follow the same locking order.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider the possibility of threads being interrupted while holding locks, which could lead to deadlocks or inconsistent states.\n\nTo handle this, I can use `try-finally` blocks to ensure that locks are always released, even if an exception occurs.\n\nHowever, in Java, synchronized blocks already release locks when the block is exited, even via an exception.\n\nSo, as long as I don't have any code that could consume the exception and continue execution while holding a lock, I should be fine.\n\nAnother consideration is that if a transfer fails due to insufficient funds, I need to make sure that no partial updates occur.\n\nIn the current implementation, if the withdrawal fails because of insufficient funds, the deposit doesn't happen, which is correct.\n\nBut, I should also think about what happens if one account is being transferred from and to in different threads simultaneously.\n\nGiven that each account's deposit and withdraw methods are synchronized, and transfers lock both accounts in order, this should be handled correctly.\n\nTo further test this, I can create more threads and have them perform a variety of operations concurrently.\n\nI can also add logging to see the sequence of operations and verify that balances are updated correctly.\n\nLet me enhance the test class to include more transactions and logging.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;\nimport java.util.concurrent.Executors;\nimport java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;\n\npublic class BankSystemTest {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {\n        Bank bank = new Bank();\n\n        // Create some accounts\n        String acc1 = bank.createAccount(\"Alice\", 1000);\n        String acc2 = bank.createAccount(\"Bob\", 500);\n        String acc3 = bank.createAccount(\"Charlie\", 750);\n\n        // Define some transactions\n        Runnable depositTask = () -> {\n            synchronized (System.out) {\n                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \" is depositing 100 to

        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \" failed to withdraw 50 from \" + acc2);\n                }\n            }\n        };\n\n        Runnable transferTask = () -> {\n            synchronized (System.out) {\n                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \" is transferring 200 from \" + acc1 + \" to \" + acc3);\n            }\n            if (bank.transfer(acc1, acc3, 200)) {\n                synchronized (System.out) {\n                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \" transferred 200 from \" + acc1 + \" to \"

Submit tasks to the executor\n        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n            executor.submit(() -> {\n                // Randomly choose a task to perform\n                Runnable task = switch ((int) (Math.random() * 3)) {\n                    case 0 -> depositTask;\n                    case 1 -> withdrawTask;\n                    default -> transferTask;\n                };\n                task.run();\n            });\n        }\n\n        // Shut down the executor and wait for all tasks to finish\n        executor.shutdown();\n        executor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);\n\n        // Verify balances\n        synchronized (System.out) {\n            System.out.println(\"Final balances:\");\n            System.out.println(\"Alice: \" +

bank.getAccount(acc3).getBalance());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this enhanced test, I'm using an `ExecutorService` to manage a pool of threads, submitting 100 tasks to be executed concurrently.\n\nEach task randomly chooses between depositing to account 1, withdrawing from account 2, or transferring from account 1 to account 3.\n\nI've also added synchronized blocks around print statements to avoid interleaved output and to get a clearer picture of the sequence of operations.\n\nAfter all tasks complete, I print out the final balances.\n\nTo verify the correctness, I can calculate the expected total balance and compare it with the sum of the individual account balances.\n\nGiven that all operations are synchronized properly, the total balance should remain consistent.\n\nHowever, since the specific sequence of operations can affect individual account balances, I need to ensure that no money is created or lost in the system as a whole.\n\nLet me calculate the initial total balance:\n\n- Alice: 1000\n\n- Bob: 500\n\n- Charlie: 750\n\nTotal: 1000 + 500 + 750 = 2250\n\nNow, considering the operations:\n\n- Deposits to Alice: 100 per deposit task\n\n- Withdrawals from Bob: 50 per withdraw task\n\n- Transfers from Alice to Charlie: 200 per transfer task\n\nSince the number of each task is random, I can't predict the exact final balances, but the total balance should remain 2250 plus any deposits minus any withdrawals.\n\nWait, deposits add to the total balance, while withdrawals and transfers move money within the system without changing the total balance.\n\nWait, no. Transfers move money from one account to another, so the total balance remains the same. Withdrawals reduce the total balance, and deposits increase it.\n\nWait, actually, in a bank system, withdrawals and deposits should be handled carefully.\n\nIn this simulation, withdrawals subtract from an account's balance, and deposits add to another account's balance, but in a transfer, it's a combination of both.\n\nHowever, in the `transfer` method, we're withdrawing from one account and depositing into another, so the total balance should remain the same.\n\nIn the `deposit` method, we're adding to an account's balance, which increases the total balance.\n\nIn the `withdraw` method, we're subtracting from an account's balance, which decreases the total balance.\n\nSo, in this test, deposits increase the total balance, withdrawals decrease it, and transfers keep it the same.\n\nTherefore, the expected total balance at the end would be:\n\nInitial total balance + (number of deposits * deposit amount) - (number of successful withdrawals * withdrawal amount)\n\nSince transfers don't change the total balance, they don't affect the sum.\n\nTo verify this, I can keep track of the number of deposits and withdrawals in the test.\n\nHowever, in the current test setup, the number of deposits and withdrawals is determined randomly, so it's challenging to calculate the exact expected total balance.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the total balance before and after the transactions and see if it matches, considering the deposits and withdrawals.\n\nBut, given the random nature of the tasks, it's probably more practical to run the test multiple times and verify that the total balance is consistent each time.\n\nAlternatively, I can modify the test to have a fixed set of transactions, so I can calculate the expected balances precisely.\n\nFor example, I can define specific sequences of deposits, withdrawals, and transfers, and then verify the final balances.\n\nThis would make the test more deterministic and easier to verify.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nI'll define a fixed set of transactions and calculate the expected balances manually.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n- Initial balances:\n\n- Alice: 1000\n\n- Bob: 500\n\n- Charlie: 750\n\n- Transactions:\n\n1. Deposit 100 into Alice\n\n2. Withdraw 50 from Bob\n\n3. Transfer 200 from Alice to Charlie\n\n4. Deposit 200 into Bob\n\n5. Withdraw 100 from Alice\n\n6. Transfer 150 from Charlie to Bob\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected balances step by step.\n\n1. Deposit 100 into Alice:\n\n- Alice: 1000 + 100 = 1100\n\n2. Withdraw 50 from Bob:\n\n- Bob: 500 - 50 = 450\n\n3. Transfer 200 from Alice to Charlie:\n\n- Alice: 1100 - 200 = 900\n\n- Charlie: 750 + 200 = 950\n\n4. Deposit 200 into Bob:\n\n- Bob: 450 + 200 = 650\n\n5. Withdraw 100 from Alice:\n\n- Alice: 900 - 100 = 800\n\n6. Transfer 150 from Charlie to Bob:\n\n- Charlie: 950 - 150 = 800\n\n- Bob: 650 + 150 = 800\n\nFinal expected balances:\n\n- Alice: 800\n\n- Bob: 800\n\n- Charlie: 800\n\nTotal balance: 800 + 800 + 800 = 2400\n\nInitial total balance: 1000 + 500 + 750 = 2250\n\nDifference: 2400 - 2250 = 150\n\nThis difference comes from deposits minus withdrawals:\n\n- Deposits:\n\n- 100 (Alice)\n\n- 200 (Bob)\n\n- Total deposits: 300\n\n- Withdrawals:\n\n- 50 (Bob)\n\n- 100 (Alice)\n\n- Total withdrawals: 150\n\n- Net change: 300 - 150 = 150\n\nWhich matches the difference in total balances.\n\nNow, I'll implement this fixed set of transactions in the test class and verify the final balances.\n\n```java\npublic class BankSystemTest {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Bank bank = new Bank();\n\n        // Create some accounts\n        String acc1 = bank.createAccount(\"Alice\", 1000);\n        String acc2 = bank.createAccount(\"Bob\", 500);\n        String acc3 = bank.createAccount(\"Charlie\", 750);\n\n        // Define transactions as Runnable tasks\n        Runnable depositToAlice = () -> bank.deposit(acc1, 100);\n        Runnable withdrawFromBob = () ->

threads[] = {\n                new Thread(depositToAlice),\n                new Thread(withdrawFromBob),\n                new Thread(transferFromAliceToCharlie),\n                new

bank.getAccount(acc3).getBalance());\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this test, I've defined specific transactions and created separate threads for each one.\n\nAfter all threads have completed, I print out the final balances to verify against the expected balances.\n\nHowever, since threads run concurrently, the actual order of execution might differ, which could lead to different final balances if synchronization is not properly handled.\n\nBut, given that I've synchronized the critical sections, the final balances should match the expected ones.\n\nTo make this test more robust, I can run it multiple times and check if the balances are consistent each time.\n\nAdditionally, I can add logging in each transaction to see the sequence of operations and verify that the synchronization works as intended.\n\nLet me enhance the transactions with logging.\n\n```java\nRunnable depositToAlice = () -> {\n    synchronized (System.out) {\n        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \" is depositing 100 to Alice\");\n    }\n    bank.deposit(acc1, 100);\n    synchronized (System.out) {\n        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \" deposited 100 to Alice\");\n    }\n};\n\nRunnable withdrawFromBob = () -> {\n    synchronized (System.out) {\n        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \" is withdrawing 50 from Bob\");\n    }\n    boolean success = bank.withdraw(acc2, 50);\n    synchronized (System.out) {\n        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \" withdrew 50 from Bob: \" + success);\n    }\n};\n\nRunnable transferFromAliceToCharlie = () -> {\n    synchronized (System.out) {\n        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \" is transferring 200 from Alice to Charlie\");\n    }\n    boolean success = bank.transfer(acc1, acc3, 200);\n    synchronized (System.out) {\n        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \" transferred 200 from Alice to Charlie: \" + success);\n    }\n};\n\nRunnable depositToBob = () -> {\n    synchronized (System.out) {\n        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \" is depositing 200 to Bob\");\n    }\n    bank.deposit(acc2, 200);\n    synchronized (System.out) {\n        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \" deposited 200 to Bob\");\n    }\n};\n\nRunnable withdrawFromAlice = () -> {\n    synchronized (System.out) {\n        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \" is withdrawing 100 from Alice\");\n    }\n    boolean success = bank.withdraw(acc1, 100);\n    synchronized (System.out) {\n        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \" withdrew 100 from Alice: \" + success);\n    }\n};\n\nRunnable transferFromCharlieToBob = () -> {\n    synchronized (System.out) {\n        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \" is transferring 150 from Charlie to Bob\");\n    }\n    boolean success = bank.transfer(acc3, acc2, 150);\n    synchronized (System.out) {\n        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \" transferred 150 from Charlie to Bob: \" + success);\n    }\n};\n```\n\nWith these logging statements, I can see the sequence in which threads are executing their tasks and verify that the operations are being synchronized correctly.\n\nRunning this test multiple times should yield the same final balances, confirming that the bank account system handles concurrent transactions safely.\n\nOverall, I think this approach should work. I've synchronized the critical sections using locks on individual accounts and ensured that the `Bank` class manages the accounts in a thread-safe manner using a `ConcurrentHashMap`.\n\nBy following this design, the bank account system should be able to handle concurrent deposits, withdrawals, and transfers without data inconsistencies.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Java program that simulates a bank account system capable of handling multiple concurrent transactions safely using multithreading.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **BankAccount Class**: \n   - Represents individual bank accounts with properties like account number, account holder's name, and balance.\n   - Provides synchronized methods for depositing and withdrawing money to ensure thread safety.\n\n2. **Bank Class**:\n   - Manages all bank accounts using a ConcurrentHashMap for thread-safe access.\n   - Provides methods to create accounts, deposit, withdraw, and transfer money between accounts.\n   - Uses synchronization to prevent race conditions and deadlocks during concurrent transactions.\n\n3. **BankSystemTest Class**:\n   - Tests the bank account system by creating accounts and performing multiple concurrent transactions using threads.\n   - Verifies that the system maintains consistent account balances despite concurrent access.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;\nimport java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;\n\nclass BankAccount {\n    private String accountNumber;\n    private String accountHolderName;\n    private double balance;\n\n    public BankAccount(String accountNumber, String accountHolderName, double initialBalance) {\n        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;\n        this.accountHolderName = accountHolderName;\n        this.balance = initialBalance;\n    }\n\n    public synchronized void deposit(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0) {\n            balance += amount;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public synchronized boolean withdraw(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0 && balance >= amount) {\n            balance -= amount;\n            return true;\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    public double getBalance() {\n        return balance;\n    }\n\n    // Getters for account details\n}\n\nclass Bank {\n    private ConcurrentHashMap<String, BankAccount> accounts;\n    private AtomicInteger lastAccountNumber;\n\n    public Bank() {\n        accounts = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();\n        lastAccountNumber = new AtomicInteger(0);\n    }\n\n    public String createAccount(String accountHolderName, double initialBalance) {\n        int accountNumberInt = lastAccountNumber.incrementAndGet();\n        String accountNumber = \"ACC\" + accountNumberInt;\n        BankAccount newAccount = new BankAccount(accountNumber, accountHolderName, initialBalance);\n        accounts.put(accountNumber, newAccount);\n        return accountNumber;\n    }\n\n    public BankAccount getAccount(String accountNumber) {\n        return accounts.get(accountNumber);\n    }\n\n    public void deposit(String accountNumber, double amount) {\n        BankAccount account = accounts.get(accountNumber);\n        if (account != null) {\n            account.deposit(amount);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public boolean withdraw(String accountNumber, double amount) {\n        BankAccount account = accounts.get(accountNumber);\n        if (account != null) {\n            return account.withdraw(amount);\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    public boolean transfer(String fromAccountNumber, String toAccountNumber, double amount) {\n        BankAccount fromAccount = accounts.get(fromAccountNumber);\n        BankAccount toAccount = accounts.get(toAccountNumber);\n\n        if (fromAccount != null && toAccount != null) {\n            // Lock both accounts in order of account number\n            BankAccount firstAccount = fromAccountNumber.compareTo(toAccountNumber) < 0 ?

It provides methods to create accounts and perform transactions like deposit, withdraw, and transfer. The transfer method ensures that transfers between two accounts are handled safely by locking the accounts in a specific order based on their account numbers to prevent deadlocks.\n\n- **BankSystemTest Class**: Tests the bank account system by creating accounts and performing a series of transactions in separate threads. It includes logging to track the sequence of operations and verifies the final account balances to ensure the correctness of the system under concurrent access.\n\nThis design ensures that the bank account system can handle multiple concurrent transactions safely without leading to data inconsistencies or race conditions."
