        "content": "I'd be happy to help you with that! To create a Python script that fetches tweets containing specific keywords and performs sentiment analysis on them using the TextBlob library, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up a Twitter Developer Account**: You need to have access to the Twitter API, which requires a developer account. Once you have that, create a new app to get your API keys and access tokens.\n\n2. **Install Required Libraries**: You'll need `tweepy` for interacting with the Twitter API and `textblob` for sentiment analysis. You can install them using pip if you haven't already.\n\n3. **Authenticate with Twitter API**: Use your API keys and access tokens to authenticate your application.\n\n4. **Fetch Tweets**: Use Tweepy to search for tweets containing specific keywords.\n\n5. **Perform Sentiment Analysis**: Use TextBlob to analyze the sentiment of each tweet.\n\n6. **Display or Store Results**: Optionally, you can print the results or store them in a file or database.\n\nHere's a sample script that demonstrates these steps:\n\n```python\nimport tweepy\nfrom textblob import TextBlob\n\n# Step 1: Set up your Twitter API credentials\nconsumer_key = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY'\nconsumer_secret = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET'\naccess_token = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'\naccess_token_secret = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET'\n\n# Step 2: Authenticate with Twitter\nauth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)\nauth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)\napi = tweepy.API(auth)\n\n# Step 3: Define the keyword(s) to search for\nkeywords = 'python programming'\n\n# Step 4: Fetch tweets containing the keywords\ntweets = api.search(q=keywords, lang='en', count=100)\n\n# Step 5: Perform sentiment analysis on each tweet\nfor tweet in tweets:\n    text = tweet.text\n    analysis = TextBlob(text)\n    sentiment = analysis.sentiment.polarity\n    if sentiment > 0:\n        sentiment_label = 'positive'\n    elif sentiment < 0:\n        sentiment_label = 'negative'\n    else:\n        sentiment_label = 'neutral'\n    print(f'Tweet: {text}\\nSentiment: {sentiment_label}\\n')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Setting Up Twitter API Credentials**: Replace the placeholder strings with your actual Twitter API keys and access tokens.\n\n2. **Authentication**: Using Tweepy's `OAuthHandler` to authenticate with the Twitter API.\n\n3. **Searching for Tweets**: The `api.search` method is used to fetch tweets containing the specified keywords. You can adjust the `count` parameter to fetch more or fewer tweets.\n\n4. **Sentiment Analysis**: For each tweet, we create a `TextBlob` object and use its `sentiment.polarity` property to determine the sentiment. The polarity score ranges from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive), with 0 being neutral.\n\n5. **Displaying Results**: Print each tweet along with its sentiment label.\n\n### Notes:\n\n- Make sure to handle rate limits imposed by the Twitter API to avoid getting blocked.\n- Consider error handling for cases where the API request fails.\n- For more accurate sentiment analysis, you might want to preprocess the text (e.g., removing URLs, special characters, etc.).\n\nThis script should give you a good starting point for fetching tweets and performing basic sentiment analysis.
