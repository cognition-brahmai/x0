        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the gardener has 200 flowers and she plants them in rows, with each row containing 7 flowers. We need to find out how many complete rows she can plant and how many flowers will be left unplanted.\n\nFirst, I think I should divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers per row. So, that's 200 divided by 7. But I'm not sure how to do that exactly. Maybe I can use long division?\n\nLet me try long division. Seven goes into 20 three times because 7 times 3 is 21, which is just over 20, but actually, wait, 7 times 2 is 14, which is less than 20. So, 7 times 2 is 14, subtract that from 20, and I get 6. Then bring down the 0, making it 60. Now, 7 goes into 60 eight times because 7 times 8 is 56. Subtract 56 from 60, and I get 4. So, the quotient is 28 and the remainder is 4.\n\nDoes that mean she can plant 28 complete rows and have 4 flowers left over? That seems plausible, but I should check my division to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of multiplication. If each row has 7 flowers, then to find out how many full rows she can plant with 200 flowers, I need to find the largest whole number that, when multiplied by 7, is less than or equal to 200.\n\nLet's try 28 times 7. 28 times 7 is 196, which is less than 200. If I try 29 times 7, that's 203, which is more than 200. So, 28 is indeed the largest whole number where 7 times that number is less than or equal to 200.\n\nNow, to find out how many flowers are left unplanted, I can subtract the total number of flowers used in the complete rows from the total number of flowers. So, 200 minus 196 equals 4 flowers remaining.\n\nWait a minute, but I should consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using modulo operation. I've heard of that in programming. The modulo operation gives the remainder of a division of two numbers. So, 200 modulo 7 should give me the remainder, which is the number of unplanted flowers.\n\nLet me calculate 200 modulo 7. As I did earlier, 7 times 28 is 196, and 200 minus 196 is 4. So, yes, the remainder is 4.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can check with another method. Let's see, if she plants 28 rows with 7 flowers each, that's 28 times 7, which is 196 flowers. Subtracting that from 200 gives me 4 flowers left over.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about how many flowers are needed for 29 rows. 29 times 7 is 203, which is more than 200, so she can't plant a full 29th row. Therefore, again, 28 full rows and some flowers left over.\n\nWait, but how many exactly? Well, as before, 200 minus 196 is 4.\n\nHmm, what if I consider that 7 flowers per row, and I have 200 flowers. Maybe I can think about it in terms of grouping. How many groups of 7 can I make from 200 items?\n\nWell, that's essentially the same as division. 200 divided by 7 gives me the number of full groups, and the remainder is the number of items that don't make a full group.\n\nSo, again, 28 full groups with 4 items left over.\n\nI think I'm convincing myself that the answer is 28 complete rows with 4 flowers remaining.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. Maybe if there's a different arrangement or something, but the problem says she plants them in rows with 7 flowers each, so it's straightforward division.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider if there is a pattern or a formula for this. Is there a mathematical formula for finding the number of complete groups and the remainder?\n\nYes, it's the division algorithm, which states that for any integers a and b, there exist unique integers q and r such that a = b*q + r, where 0 \u2264 r < b.\n\nIn this case, a is 200, b is 7, q is the quotient (number of complete rows), and r is the remainder (unplanted flowers).\n\nSo, 200 = 7*q + r, where 0 \u2264 r < 7.\n\nWe already found q to be 28 and r to be 4, since 200 = 7*28 + 4.\n\nThis seems consistent with the division algorithm.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that 7*28 = 196, and 7*29 = 203, which is greater than 200, so again, 28 full rows and 4 remaining flowers.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, maybe I can use a different method, like subtracting 7 repeatedly until I can't subtract anymore.\n\nStart with 200:\n\n200 - 7 = 193\n\n193 - 7 = 186\n\n186 - 7 = 179\n\n179 - 7 = 172\n\n172 - 7 = 165\n\n165 - 7 = 158\n\n158 - 7 = 151\n\n151 - 7 = 144\n\n144 - 7 = 137\n\n137 - 7 = 130\n\n130 - 7 = 123\n\n123 - 7 = 116\n\n116 - 7 = 109\n\n109 - 7 = 102\n\n102 - 7 = 95\n\n95 - 7 = 88\n\n88 - 7 = 81\n\n81 - 7 = 74\n\n74 - 7 = 67\n\n67 - 7 = 60\n\n60 - 7 = 53\n\n53 - 7 = 46\n\n46 - 7 = 39\n\n39 - 7 = 32\n\n32 - 7 = 25\n\n25 - 7 = 18\n\n18 - 7 = 11\n\n11 - 7 = 4\n\nNow, I can't subtract 7 from 4, so I stop here. I subtracted 7 a total of 28 times, which means 28 full rows, and I have 4 flowers left over.\n\nThis matches my previous result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use decimal division to check. 200 divided by 7 is approximately 28.571, which means 28 full rows, and a fraction of a row remaining.\n\nBut since each row must have 7 flowers, she can't plant a partial row, so again, 28 full rows and some flowers left over.\n\nTo find the exact number left over, I can multiply 28 by 7 to get 196, then subtract from 200 to get 4.\n\nSo, all these methods point to the same answer: 28 complete rows with 4 flowers remaining.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28 \\text{ complete rows with } 4 \\text{ flowers remaining}} \\]"
