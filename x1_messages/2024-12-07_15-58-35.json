        "content": "So I have this problem: I need to calculate the probability of drawing two red cards from a standard deck of playing cards without replacement. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that a standard deck has 52 cards in total. Half of them are red, and half are black. So, there are 26 red cards and 26 black cards.\n\nNow, the problem says \"without replacement,\" which means that once I draw the first card, it stays out of the deck, and the second card is drawn from the remaining cards.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing two red cards in a row without replacement would be the probability of drawing a red card on the first draw multiplied by the probability of drawing another red card on the second draw, given that the first card was red.\n\nLet me write this down:\n\nProbability = P(First card is red) \u00d7 P(Second card is red | First card is red)\n\nFirst, P(First card is red). Since there are 26 red cards out of 52 total cards, that's 26/52, which simplifies to 1/2.\n\nNext, P(Second card is red | First card is red). This means, given that the first card was red, what's the probability that the second card is also red.\n\nIf the first card was red, then there are now 25 red cards left and a total of 51 cards remaining in the deck. So, that's 25/51.\n\nNow, multiply these two probabilities together:\n\nProbability = (1/2) \u00d7 (25/51)\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, 1/2 is 0.5, and 25/51 is approximately 0.4902.\n\nSo, 0.5 \u00d7 0.4902 is approximately 0.2451.\n\nBut maybe I should leave it as a fraction for exactness.\n\nSo, (1/2) \u00d7 (25/51) = 25/102.\n\nTo confirm, 1 times 25 is 25, and 2 times 51 is 102.\n\nSo, the exact probability is 25/102.\n\nAlternatively, I can leave it as a decimal, which is approximately 0.2451, or 24.51%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that fraction.\n\n25 divided by 102 simplifies to... is there a common factor?\n\n25 and 102 don't have any common factors besides 1, so 25/102 is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 25/102.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red cards out of 26 is C(26,2), and the total number of ways to choose any 2 cards out of 52 is C(52,2).\n\nSo, Probability = C(26,2) / C(52,2)\n\nLet me calculate that to verify.\n\nC(26,2) = (26\u00d725)/2 = 325\n\nC(52,2) = (52\u00d751)/2 = 1326\n\nSo, Probability = 325 / 1326\n\nNow, let's see if this simplifies.\n\nBoth 325 and 1326 can be divided by 13.\n\n325 \u00f7 13 = 25\n\n1326 \u00f7 13 = 102\n\nSo, it simplifies to 25/102, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 25/102.\n\nAlternatively, some people might prefer to leave it as a decimal, which is approximately 0.2451, or 24.51%.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify, I'll stick with the fractional form.\n\nSo, the final answer is 25/102.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{102}} \\]"
