        "content": "A 100-watt light bulb uses 100 watts of power per hour. To find out how much energy it uses in a day, you need to multiply the power consumption by the number of hours in a day.\n\nSo, energy consumption in a day = power consumption (in watts) \u00d7 number of hours used per day.\n\nAssuming the light bulb is used for 8 hours a day, the energy consumption would be:\n\n100 watts \u00d7 8 hours = 800 watt-hours (Wh)\n\nSince energy is often measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh), you can convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours by dividing by 1,000:\n\n800 Wh \u00f7 1,000 = 0.8 kWh\n\nTherefore, a 100-watt light bulb used for 8 hours a day consumes 0.8 kilowatt-hours of energy per day.\n\nIf the light bulb is used for a different number of hours, you can adjust the calculation accordingly. For example, if it's used for 12 hours a day:\n\n100 watts \u00d7 12 hours = 1,200 Wh = 1.2 kWh per day.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Power consumption: 100 watts\n\n- Usage time per day: 8 hours\n\n- Energy consumption per day: 0.8 kWh\n\n**Formula:**\n\nEnergy (kWh) = (Power (watts) \u00d7 Hours used per day) / 1,000\n\n**Example Calculation:**\n\nEnergy = (100 watts \u00d7 8 hours) / 1,000 = 0.8 kWh per day\n\n**Note:**\n\n- 1 kilowatt (kW) = 1,000 watts (W)\n\n- 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 1,000 watt-hours (Wh)\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- Energy costs are often billed in kWh, so knowing the energy consumption helps in estimating the cost.\n\n- LED bulbs use significantly less power for the same light output, making them more energy-efficient.\n\n**Example with LED Bulb:**\n\n- An LED bulb that produces the same amount of light as a 100-watt incandescent bulb might only use 15 watts.\n\n- Energy consumption for LED bulb: (15 watts \u00d7 8 hours) / 1,000 = 0.12 kWh per day\n\n- Savings: 0.8 kWh - 0.12 kWh = 0.68 kWh per day\n\n- Over a month (30 days): 0.68 kWh/day \u00d7 30 days = 20.4 kWh\n\n- If electricity costs $0.12 per kWh, monthly savings would be 20.4 kWh \u00d7 $0.12/kWh = $2.45\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSwitching to energy-efficient LED bulbs can lead to significant energy savings and cost reductions over time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.8 \\text{ kWh per day}} \\]"
