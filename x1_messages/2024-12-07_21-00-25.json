So, the profit would be $150,000 (revenue) minus $110,000 (expenses), which equals $40,000.\n\nNext, the company has decided to donate 10% of their profit to charity. To find out how much that is, I need to calculate 10% of $40,000. \n\n10% of $40,000 is calculated as 0.10 multiplied by $40,000, which equals $4,000.\n\nTherefore, the company will donate $4,000 to charity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4000} \\]"
