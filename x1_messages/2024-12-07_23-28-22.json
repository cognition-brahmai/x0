Italians have a rich culinary tradition that goes beyond pasta. While pasta is certainly a staple in many Italian dishes, it is not necessarily eaten every day by all Italians. Italian cuisine varies greatly by region, and diets can include a wide range of dishes such as risotto, polenta, pizza, seafood, meat, vegetables, and more. It's important to remember that generalizations about entire populations can be misleading, as individual preferences and habits can vary widely within any culture."
