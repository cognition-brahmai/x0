        "content": "Let's see. I have this sequence defined recursively: a_n = a_(n-1) + n, and it starts with a_1 = 3. I need to find a_5. Okay, so I'll probably have to calculate each term step by step up to n=5.\n\nStarting with a_1 = 3.\n\nNow, for a_2: a_2 = a_1 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nNext, a_3 = a_2 + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8.\n\nThen, a_4 = a_3 + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12.\n\nFinally, a_5 = a_4 + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17.\n\nSo, a_5 is 17.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to find a_5 without calculating each step? Maybe there's a formula I can derive from the recursive definition.\n\nGiven that a_n = a_(n-1) + n, this is a linear recursive relation. I think I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nLet me try to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nStarting with a_1 = 3.\n\nThen, a_2 = a_1 + 2.\n\na_3 = a_2 + 3 = (a_1 + 2) + 3 = a_1 + 2 + 3.\n\na_4 = a_3 + 4 = a_1 + 2 + 3 + 4.\n\na_5 = a_4 + 5 = a_1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = a_1 + sum from k=2 to n of k.\n\nI know that the sum from k=1 to n of k is (n(n+1))/2.\n\nTherefore, sum from k=2 to n of k = (n(n+1))/2 - 1.\n\nSo, a_n = a_1 + (n(n+1))/2 - 1.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 3, a_n = 3 + (n(n+1))/2 - 1 = 2 + (n(n+1))/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=2: a_2 = 2 + (2*3)/2 = 2 + 3 = 5, which matches earlier calculation.\n\nFor n=3: 2 + (3*4)/2 = 2 + 6 = 8, correct.\n\nn=4: 2 + (4*5)/2 = 2 + 10 = 12, correct.\n\nn=5: 2 + (5*6)/2 = 2 + 15 = 17, which matches.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = 2 + (n(n+1))/2.\n\nTherefore, a_5 = 17.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the method of solving linear recursions, but this way seems straightforward enough for this problem.\n\nI think that's it. The value of a_5 is 17.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]"
