        "content": "So there's a class with 40 students, and 60% of them are female. I need to find out how many male students there are. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that the total number of students is 40. If 60% of them are female, then the remaining percentage must be male, right? So, I can calculate the percentage of male students by subtracting the percentage of female students from 100%.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nPercentage of male students = 100% - 60% = 40%\n\nOkay, so 40% of the students are male. Now, to find out how many that is, I need to calculate 40% of 40 students.\n\nI remember that to find a percentage of a number, I can multiply the percentage by the number and then divide by 100. So, it would be:\n\nNumber of male students = (40% * 40) / 100\n\nLet me do the math:\n\nFirst, 40% is the same as 40 per 100, so 40/100 = 0.4\n\nThen, 0.4 multiplied by 40 is:\n\n0.4 * 40 = 16\n\nSo, there are 16 male students in the class.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way could be to first find out how many female students there are and then subtract that number from the total number of students to get the number of male students.\n\nSo, if 60% of 40 students are female, then:\n\nNumber of female students = (60% * 40) / 100\n\nAgain, 60% is 0.6, so:\n\n0.6 * 40 = 24\n\nSo, there are 24 female students.\n\nNow, total students are 40, so male students would be:\n\n40 - 24 = 16\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, there are 16 male students in the class.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using fractions?\n\nPercentage is just a way of expressing a fraction out of 100, so 60% is 60/100, which simplifies to 3/5.\n\nSo, if 3/5 of the students are female, then the fraction of male students would be:\n\n1 - 3/5 = 2/5\n\nNow, to find the number of male students, I can multiply the total number of students by this fraction:\n\nNumber of male students = 2/5 * 40 = (2 * 40) / 5 = 80 / 5 = 16\n\nAgain, the same answer, 16.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it through different methods. So, the number of male students in the class is 16.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me ensure that the percentages add up correctly.\n\nFemale students: 24 out of 40.\n\nTo find the percentage: (24 / 40) * 100 = 60%, which matches the given information.\n\nMale students: 16 out of 40.\n\nPercentage: (16 / 40) * 100 = 40%\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer is 16 male students.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
