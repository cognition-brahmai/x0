        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 4 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 5 green balls. That means in total, there are 4 + 3 + 5 = 12 balls in the box. I need to find the probability that when I pick three balls at random without replacement, at least one of them is red.\n\nAlright, so \"at least one red ball\" means that in the three balls I pick, there could be one red, two red, or all three red. That seems a bit complicated to calculate directly because there are multiple scenarios to consider. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.\n\nI remember that when dealing with \"at least one\" in probability, it's often easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1. The complementary event of \"at least one red ball\" is \"no red balls at all.\" So, if I calculate the probability of picking three balls and none of them are red, then subtract that from 1, I should get the probability of picking at least one red ball.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, find the probability of picking three balls with no red balls.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick three balls out of 12 is C(12,3), where C(n,k) is the combination formula, which is n! / (k!(n-k)!).\n\nSo, C(12,3) = 12! / (3! * 9!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 220.\n\nNow, the number of ways to pick three balls with no red balls. Since there are 4 red balls, the non-red balls are 12 - 4 = 8 balls. So, there are 8 non-red balls.\n\nThe number of ways to pick three balls from these 8 non-red balls is C(8,3) = 8! / (3! * 5!) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 56.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking three balls with no red balls is 56 / 220.\n\nSimplify that fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 8 \u2192 7 / 27.5, but that's not a proper fraction. Let's divide both by 8: 56 \u00f7 8 = 7, and 220 \u00f7 8 = 27.5. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should divide by 4 instead: 56 \u00f7 4 = 14, and 220 \u00f7 4 = 55. So, 14/55.\n\nSo, P(no red balls) = 14/55.\n\nTherefore, P(at least one red ball) = 1 - P(no red balls) = 1 - 14/55 = (55 - 14)/55 = 41/55.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal ways to pick 3 balls: C(12,3) = 220.\n\nWays to pick 3 non-red balls: C(8,3) = 56.\n\nSo, P(no red) = 56/220 = 14/55.\n\nTherefore, P(at least one red) = 1 - 14/55 = 41/55.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability directly by considering the different scenarios where I pick one, two, or three red balls, but that would involve more calculations.\n\nLet me see if I can verify this another way.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the inclusion-exclusion principle, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of conditional probability, considering the probability of picking a red ball on the first draw, or the second, given that the first wasn't red, and so on.\n\nBut that might be more complicated than the initial approach.\n\nLet me try to calculate it that way to verify.\n\nSo, the probability of picking at least one red ball can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the following mutually exclusive events:\n\n1. First ball is red, and the next two are not.\n\n2. First ball is not red, second ball is red, third is not red.\n\n3. First and second balls are not red, third ball is red.\n\nWait, no. Actually, these are not mutually exclusive because they all involve exactly one red ball in different positions.\n\nWait, but \"at least one red\" includes one, two, or three red balls.\n\nBut to make it simpler, maybe I should think in terms of the complement again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the probability step by step.\n\nProbability that the first ball is red: 4/12 = 1/3.\n\nThen, given that the first ball is red, the probability that the second ball is not red: 8/11.\n\nAnd the probability that the third ball is not red: 7/10.\n\nBut that's for the specific sequence of first ball red and the next two not red.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, it's easier to go with the complement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the probability of at least one red ball by considering that at least one red ball means total probability minus the probability of no red balls, which is what I did initially.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial approach, P(at least one red) = 1 - P(no red balls) = 1 - 14/55 = 41/55.\n\nAlternatively, to cross-verify, let's calculate the probability directly.\n\nProbability of picking exactly one red ball:\n\nNumber of ways to pick one red and two non-red balls: C(4,1) * C(8,2) = 4 * 28 = 112.\n\nProbability: 112 / 220 = 28/55.\n\nProbability of picking exactly two red balls:\n\nNumber of ways: C(4,2) * C(8,1) = 6 * 8 = 48.\n\nProbability: 48 / 220 = 12/55.\n\nProbability of picking exactly three red balls:\n\nNumber of ways: C(4,3) * C(8,0) = 4 * 1 = 4.\n\nProbability: 4 / 220 = 1/55.\n\nTherefore, P(at least one red) = P(exactly one red) + P(exactly two red) + P(exactly three red) = 28/55 + 12/55 + 1/55 = 41/55.\n\nOkay, this matches the previous result. Good, that gives me confidence that 41/55 is the correct probability.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the probability step by step, without using combinations:\n\nThe probability that the first ball is red is 4/12.\n\nGiven that the first ball is red, the probability that the second ball is not red is 8/11.\n\nGiven that the first ball is red and the second is not red, the probability that the third ball is not red is 7/10.\n\nSo, the probability of this specific sequence (red, not red, not red) is (4/12) * (8/11) * (7/10).\n\nSimilarly, the probability of (not red, red, not red) is (8/12) * (4/11) * (7/10).\n\nAnd the probability of (not red, not red, red) is (8/12) * (7/11) * (4/10).\n\nAdding these up should give the probability of exactly one red ball.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst sequence: (4/12) * (8/11) * (7/10) = (1/3) * (8/11) * (7/10) = (1*8*7)/(3*11*10) = 56/330.\n\nSecond sequence: (8/12) * (4/11) * (7/10) = (2/3) * (4/11) * (7/10) = (2*4*7)/(3*11*10) = 56/330.\n\nThird sequence: (8/12) * (7/11) * (4/10) = (2/3) * (7/11) * (2/5) = (2*7*2)/(3*11*5) = 28/165.\n\nWait, 28/165 is equivalent to 56/330.\n\nSo, total probability for exactly one red ball is 56/330 + 56/330 + 56/330 = 168/330 = 28/55.\n\nSimilarly, for exactly two red balls:\n\nProbability of (red, red, not red): (4/12)*(3/11)*(8/10) = (1/3)*(3/11)*(4/5) = (1*3*4)/(3*11*5) = 12/165.\n\nProbability of (red, not red, red): (4/12)*(8/11)*(3/10) = (1/3)*(8/11)*(3/10) = (1*8*3)/(3*11*10) = 24/330 = 12/165.\n\nProbability of (not red, red, red): (8/12)*(4/11)*(3/10) = (2/3)*(4/11)*(3/10) = (2*4*3)/(3*11*10) = 24/330 = 12/165.\n\nSo, total probability for exactly two red balls is 12/165 + 12/165 + 12/165 = 36/165 = 12/55.\n\nAnd for exactly three red balls:\n\nProbability of (red, red, red): (4/12)*(3/11)*(2/10) = (1/3)*(3/11)*(1/5) = (1*3*1)/(3*11*5) = 3/165 = 1/55.\n\nSo, P(at least one red) = P(exactly one red) + P(exactly two red) + P(exactly three red) = 28/55 + 12/55 + 1/55 = 41/55.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of hypergeometric distribution since we're sampling without replacement.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\nP(X=k) = [C(K,k) * C(N-K,n-k)] / C(N,n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (12 balls).\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (4 red balls).\n\n- n is the number of draws (3 balls).\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (red balls).\n\nSo, P(X >=1) = 1 - P(X=0).\n\nP(X=0) = [C(4,0) * C(8,3)] / C(12,3) = [1 * 56] / 220 = 56/220 = 14/55.\n\nTherefore, P(X >=1) = 1 - 14/55 = 41/55.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to calculate P(X>=1) directly:\n\nP(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X=3).\n\nP(X=1) = [C(4,1) * C(8,2)] / C(12,3) = [4 * 28] / 220 = 112/220 = 28/55.\n\nP(X=2) = [C(4,2) * C(8,1)] / C(12,3) = [6 * 8] / 220 = 48/220 = 12/55.\n\nP(X=3) = [C(4,3) * C(8,0)] / C(12,3) = [4 * 1] / 220 = 4/220 = 1/55.\n\nSo, P(X>=1) = 28/55 + 12/55 + 1/55 = 41/55.\n\nConsistently getting the same result gives me confidence in the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of conditional probability.\n\nThe probability that at least one ball is red is equal to the probability that the first ball is red, plus the probability that the first ball is not red but the second ball is red, plus the probability that the first two balls are not red but the third ball is red.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, P(first ball red) = 4/12 = 1/3.\n\nSecond, P(first ball not red and second ball red) = (8/12) * (4/11) = (2/3) * (4/11) = 8/33.\n\nThird, P(first two balls not red and third ball red) = (8/12) * (7/11) * (4/10) = (2/3) * (7/11) * (2/5) = (2*7*2)/(3*11*5) = 28/165.\n\nNow, adding these up: 1/3 + 8/33 + 28/165.\n\nLet me find a common denominator. 3, 33, 165. The least common multiple is 165.\n\nSo, 1/3 = 55/165.\n\n8/33 = 40/165.\n\n28/165 remains the same.\n\nSo, total probability = 55/165 + 40/165 + 28/165 = 123/165.\n\nSimplify 123/165 by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 41/55.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nThis reinforces my confidence in the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about it in terms of permutations.\n\nTotal number of ways to pick three balls in order: 12 * 11 * 10 = 1320.\n\nNumber of ways to pick three balls with at least one red.\n\nAlternatively, it's easier to calculate the number of ways to pick three balls with no red balls and subtract from the total.\n\nNumber of ways to pick three non-red balls in order: 8 * 7 * 6 = 336.\n\nSo, P(no red balls) = 336 / 1320 = 14/55.\n\nTherefore, P(at least one red ball) = 1 - 14/55 = 41/55.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, calculating directly:\n\nNumber of ways to pick at least one red ball = total ways minus ways with no red balls = 1320 - 336 = 984.\n\nSo, P(at least one red) = 984 / 1320 = 41/55.\n\nSame result.\n\nI think I've verified this in every way possible. The probability of picking at least one red ball when drawing three balls from a box containing 4 red, 3 blue, and 5 green balls without replacement is 41/55.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{41}{55}} \\]"
