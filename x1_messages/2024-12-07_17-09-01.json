        "content": "Let's see. There are 12 apples on the table. If I take away 4 apples, that means I'm removing them from the table, right? So, 12 minus 4 would leave 8 apples on the table. Then, if I add 6 more apples to the table, I'm increasing the number of apples present. So, 8 plus 6 should give me 14 apples on the table. Wait a minute, but the question says \"you take away 4 apples,\" does that mean I'm taking them for myself, or just removing them from the table in general? I think it means I'm removing them from the table, regardless of where they're going. So, yes, 12 minus 4 is 8, and then adding 6 more apples would bring it to 14. But let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing. Is there any other way to interpret this? Perhaps the \"you take away 4 apples\" could mean that those apples are no longer on the table, and then adding 6 more apples\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u603b\u6570\u5e94\u8be5\u662f14\u4e2a\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u9677\u9631\uff0c\u6211\u5f97\u518d\u60f3\u60f3\u3002\u6216\u8005\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u684c\u5b50\u4e0a\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u82f9\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u53d6\u8d70\u4e00\u4e9b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6dfb\u52a0\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u82f9\u679c\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5269\u4e0b\u591a\u5c11\u3002\u55ef\uff0c\u6309\u7167\u6b63\u5e38\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u662f12\u51cf\u53bb4\u7b49\u4e8e8\uff0c\u518d\u52a0\u4e0a6\u7b49\u4e8e14\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u5e94\u8be5\u662f14\u4e2a\u82f9\u679c\u7559\u5728\u684c\u5b50\u4e0a\u3002\u4f46\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u4e07\u65e0\u4e00\u5931\uff0c\u6211\u518d\u91cd\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e00\u904d\u300212\u51cf4\u7b49\u4e8e8\uff0c8\u52a06\u7b49\u4e8e14\u3002\u6ca1\u9519\uff0c\u5c31\u662f14\u3002\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u3002"
