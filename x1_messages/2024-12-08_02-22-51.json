        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. To develop a Python script that uses TensorFlow to train a simple neural network model on the MNIST dataset and evaluate its accuracy, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install TensorFlow**: Make sure you have TensorFlow installed in your environment. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install tensorflow\n   ```\n\n2. **Import necessary libraries**: You'll need to import TensorFlow and other necessary modules.\n\n3. **Load the MNIST dataset**: TensorFlow provides the MNIST dataset, which you can load directly.\n\n4. **Preprocess the data**: Normalize the images and one-hot encode the labels.\n\n5. **Build the neural network model**: Define a simple neural network architecture.\n\n6. **Compile the model**: Specify the optimizer, loss function, and metrics.\n\n7. **Train the model**: Fit the model to the training data.\n\n8. **Evaluate the model**: Test the model on the test dataset and print the accuracy.\n\nHere's a complete Python script that accomplishes these tasks:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers, models\nfrom tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist\nfrom tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical\n\n# Load the MNIST dataset\n(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()\n\n# Preprocess the data\n# Normalize the images to [0, 1]\ntrain_images = train_images / 255.0\ntest_images = test_images / 255.0\n\n# One-hot encode the labels\ntrain_labels = to_categorical(train_labels)\ntest_labels = to_categorical(test_labels)\n\n# Reshape the images to fit the model\ntrain_images = train_images.reshape((60000, 28, 28, 1))\ntest_images = test_images.reshape((10000, 28, 28, 1))\n\n# Build the neural network model\nmodel = models.Sequential()\nmodel.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))\nmodel.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))\nmodel.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))\nmodel.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(layers.Flatten())\nmodel.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'))\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\n              loss='categorical_crossentropy',\n              metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5, batch_size=64)\n\n# Evaluate the model\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)\nprint(f\"Test accuracy: {test_acc}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Loading the Dataset**: The MNIST dataset is loaded directly using `tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()`.\n   \n2. **Preprocessing**:\n   - The images are normalized to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255.0.\n   - The labels are one-hot encoded using `to_categorical`.\n   - The images are reshaped to include the channel dimension (1 for grayscale).\n\n3. **Building the Model**:\n   - A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) is built using `Sequential` API.\n   - It consists of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers.\n   \n4. **Compiling the Model**:\n   - The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.\n   - Accuracy is used as the metric.\n\n5. **Training the Model**:\n   - The model is trained for 5 epochs with a batch size of 64.\n\n6. **Evaluating the Model**:\n   - The model is evaluated on the test set, and the accuracy is printed.\n\nThis script should give you a good starting point for training a neural network on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow.
