        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a company with 120 employees, and they initially planned to give each employee a $500 bonus. But, there's a budget constraint\u2014they can only spend $50,000 on bonuses. We need to figure out how much to reduce each employee's bonus so that the total bonus amount doesn't exceed $50,000.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total planned bonus amount before any reductions. If each of the 120 employees is to receive $500, then the total would be:\n\n\\[\\text{Total planned bonus} = 120 \\times 500 = 60,000\\]\n\nBut the company can only spend $50,000. So, there's a difference of:\n\n\\[\\text{Difference} = 60,000 - 50,000 = 10,000\\]\n\nThis $10,000 is the total amount that needs to be reduced from the planned bonus.\n\nNow, to find out how much each employee's bonus should be reduced, we can divide this total reduction by the number of employees:\n\n\\[\\text{Reduction per employee} = \\frac{10,000}{120}\\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[\\frac{10,000}{120} = 83.\\overline{3}\\]\n\nSo, each employee's bonus should be reduced by approximately $83.33.\n\nTo double-check, let's see what the new bonus amount would be:\n\n\\[\\text{New bonus per employee} = 500 - 83.\\overline{3} = 416.\\overline{6}\\]\n\nAnd the total bonus cost would be:\n\n\\[\\text{Total new bonus} = 120 \\times 416.\\overline{6} = 50,000\\]\n\nYes, that matches the budget constraint.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it in terms of finding the maximum bonus amount per employee that, when multiplied by 120, equals $50,000.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the new bonus amount per employee as \\( x \\). Then:\n\n\\[120 \\times x = 50,000\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{50,000}{120} = 416.\\overline{6}\\]\n\nSo, the new bonus per employee is approximately $416.67.\n\nTherefore, the reduction per employee is:\n\n\\[500 - 416.\\overline{6} = 83.\\overline{3}\\]\n\nAgain, approximately $83.33.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the reduction as a percentage of the original bonus. The total reduction needed is $10,000 out of the planned $60,000. So, the percentage reduction is:\n\n\\[\\text{Percentage reduction} = \\left( \\frac{10,000}{60,000} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 100\\% \\approx 16.\\overline{6}\\%\\]\n\nSo, each employee's bonus needs to be reduced by approximately 16.67%.\n\nApplying this percentage reduction to each employee's original bonus:\n\n\\[\\text{Reduction per employee} = 500 \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 83.\\overline{3}\\]\n\nAgain, approximately $83.33.\n\nTherefore, to stay within the $50,000 budget, each employee's bonus should be reduced by about $83.33, resulting in a new bonus amount of approximately $416.67 per employee.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{83.33} \\]"
