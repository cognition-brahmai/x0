If you share it, you don't have it\" is a secret.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- If you have a secret, it's natural to want to share it with someone else.\n\n- But once you share it, it's no longer a secret because someone else knows it.\n\nSo, the thing in question is a secret. It makes sense because secrets are meant to be shared, but once shared, they lose their secrecy.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know or discuss about this riddle?"
