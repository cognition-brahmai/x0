        "content": "Let's see. If a car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, and we want to know how far it will have traveled after 2 hours and 30 minutes, we can use the formula for distance, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nSo, speed is given as 60 miles per hour, and time is 2 hours and 30 minutes. First, we need to make sure that the units for time are compatible with the units for speed. Since speed is in miles per hour, it would be best to convert the time entirely into hours.\n\n2 hours and 30 minutes is the same as 2.5 hours because 30 minutes is half an hour (30/60 = 0.5). So, time = 2.5 hours.\n\nNow, plugging into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 60 \\, \\text{miles per hour} \\times 2.5 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nMultiplying that out:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 150 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nSo, the car will have traveled 150 miles after 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. Another way to think about it is to calculate the distance traveled in 2 hours and then add the distance traveled in the additional 30 minutes.\n\nIn 2 hours at 60 mph:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 60 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 2 \\, \\text{hours} = 120 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nIn 30 minutes at 60 mph, since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 60 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 0.5 \\, \\text{hours} = 30 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nAdding those together:\n\n\\[ 120 \\, \\text{miles} + 30 \\, \\text{miles} = 150 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nSo, yes, that confirms the earlier calculation. The car will have traveled 150 miles after 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem. For example, what if the time was given in minutes or seconds, or if the speed was in different units like kilometers per hour. But in this case, since the speed is in miles per hour and time is in hours and minutes, converting time to hours makes the most sense.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that this calculation assumes that the speed is constant at 60 mph throughout the entire journey. In reality, speeds can vary due to traffic, speed limits, and other factors, but since the problem states an average speed, we can proceed with that.\n\nFurthermore, if the time was given in a different format or if there were multiple segments of the trip with different speeds, we would need to adjust our approach accordingly. But in this straightforward case, the calculation is simply speed multiplied by time.\n\nSo, the final answer is 150 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
