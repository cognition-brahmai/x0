        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the car is traveling in two different phases with different speeds and durations. First, it goes at 45 miles per hour for 3 hours, and then it speeds up to 60 miles per hour for another 4 hours. We need to find out the total distance it travels.\n\nI remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. So, for each phase, I can calculate the distance separately and then add them together to get the total distance.\n\nLet's start with the first phase:\n\nSpeed = 45 miles per hour\n\nTime = 3 hours\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time = 45 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 135 miles\n\nOkay, so in the first 3 hours, the car travels 135 miles.\n\nNow, for the second phase:\n\nSpeed = 60 miles per hour\n\nTime = 4 hours\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time = 60 mph \u00d7 4 hours = 240 miles\n\nSo, in the next 4 hours, the car travels 240 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just need to add these two distances together:\n\nTotal distance = 135 miles + 240 miles = 375 miles\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst phase: 45 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 135 miles. That seems correct.\n\nSecond phase: 60 mph \u00d7 4 hours = 240 miles. That also seems correct.\n\nAdding them up: 135 + 240 = 375 miles. Yeah, that's right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the average speed for the entire trip, but that might be more complicated since the speeds and times are different for each phase. Plus, I might not get an accurate result that way.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the distance covered in each hour separately, but that would be time-consuming. For the first 3 hours, each hour the car covers 45 miles, so 45 \u00d7 3 = 135 miles. Then for the next 4 hours, each hour it covers 60 miles, so 60 \u00d7 4 = 240 miles. Adding them up gives the same total of 375 miles.\n\nI think 375 miles is the correct total distance traveled.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{375} \\]"
