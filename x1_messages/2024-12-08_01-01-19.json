        "content": "So John has 6 cousins, and each of these cousins has 4 siblings. The question is asking for the total number of cousins John has, considering this information.\n\nFirst, let's clarify what's being asked. John already has 6 cousins, as stated initially. The additional information is that each of these cousins has 4 siblings. Now, siblings are brothers and sisters of each other, so if each cousin has 4 siblings, that means each cousin is part of a family with 4 other cousins.\n\nBut wait, in terms of cousins, siblings of cousins are also considered cousins to John, right? Because cousins are children of siblings of John's parents. So, if John has 6 cousins, and each of those cousins has 4 siblings, those siblings are also cousins to John.\n\nSo, for each of John's cousins, there are 4 more cousins (their siblings). Since John has 6 cousins, and each has 4 siblings, that would suggest 6 cousins times 4 siblings each, which is 24 additional cousins.\n\nBut, hold on a second. If each cousin has 4 siblings, and these siblings are also cousins to John, then the total number of cousins John has would be the original 6 plus these 24 additional cousins, totaling 30 cousins.\n\nHowever, this seems a bit off because it might be double-counting. Let's think about it differently.\n\nSuppose John has 6 cousins. Each of these cousins has 4 siblings. But these siblings are also cousins to John, so they are already included in the original count of 6 cousins. Wait, that can't be right because if each cousin has 4 siblings, and these siblings are also cousins, then the total number of cousins should be more than 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 6 cousins John has are from multiple families, and each family has 5 children (since each cousin has 4 siblings, meaning a total of 5 children in the family).\n\nSo, if each family has 5 children, and these are all cousins to John, then the number of families would be the total number of cousins divided by 5.\n\nWait, but John has 6 cousins. If each family has 5 children, then 6 divided by 5 is 1.2 families, which doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of a family.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nLet's consider that John's cousins are from different families, and each cousin has 4 siblings, meaning each family has 5 children (since siblings include the cousin themselves plus their 4 siblings).\n\nSo, if each family has 5 children, and these are all cousins to John, then the total number of cousins would be 5 times the number of such families.\n\nBut John has 6 cousins, which is not a multiple of 5. This suggests that perhaps the cousins are from more than one family, and the number of cousins per family varies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some of the cousins are from the same family and share the same siblings.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to think about it in terms of sets.\n\nLet\u2019s denote John\u2019s cousins as C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n\nEach of these cousins has 4 siblings. So, for C1, the siblings are S1, S2, S3, S4.\n\nSimilarly, for C2, siblings are S5, S6, S7, S8, and so on.\n\nBut, if these siblings are also cousins to John, then they should be included in the total count of cousins.\n\nWait, but the initial statement is that John has 6 cousins. Does this initial count include all possible cousins, or just a subset?\n\nI think there might be some confusion in the terminology here.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the problem.\n\nJohn has 6 cousins. Each of these cousins has 4 siblings. Assuming that these siblings are also cousins to John, how many cousins does John have in total?\n\nSo, starting with 6 cousins, and each has 4 siblings who are also cousins, how many cousins does John have altogether?\n\nIf each of the 6 cousins has 4 siblings who are also cousins, then the total number of additional cousins is 6 times 4, which is 24.\n\nTherefore, the total number of cousins John has would be the original 6 plus these 24, totaling 30 cousins.\n\nBut, perhaps there is some overlap here. Maybe some of these siblings are shared among the cousins, meaning that some cousins are siblings to each other.\n\nWait, but if each cousin has 4 siblings, and they are all part of the same family, then the total number of cousins from that family would be 5 (including the cousin themselves).\n\nSo, perhaps John has cousins from multiple families, each family having 5 cousins.\n\nIf that's the case, then the total number of cousins John has would be a multiple of 5.\n\nBut the initial statement says he has 6 cousins, which is not a multiple of 5.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the cousins are from more than one family, and the number of cousins per family varies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some families have fewer than 5 cousins.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s think about it in terms of family structures.\n\nSuppose John has first cousins from his parents' siblings.\n\nEach of his parents has siblings, and each of those uncles and aunts has children who are John's cousins.\n\nIf each uncle or aunt has 5 children (since each cousin has 4 siblings, totaling 5 children per family), then the number of cousins John has would be 5 times the number of his parents' siblings.\n\nBut, according to the problem, John has 6 cousins. So, if each set of cousins from each uncle or aunt consists of 5 cousins, then having 6 cousins suggests that there are 6 cousins in total from all uncle-aunt families.\n\nWait, but 6 is not a multiple of 5, which is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some uncles or aunts have fewer than 5 children.\n\nFor example, if there are two uncles, and one has 5 children and the other has 1 child, then John would have 6 cousins in total.\n\nBut in this case, the cousin from the second uncle would have no siblings (since they are the only child), which contradicts the statement that each cousin has 4 siblings.\n\nWait, no, the statement says each cousin has 4 siblings, which would imply that each cousin comes from a family with 5 children.\n\nTherefore, if each cousin has 4 siblings, then each family has 5 cousins.\n\nSo, if John has cousins from multiple families, each family contributing 5 cousins, then the total number of cousins should be a multiple of 5.\n\nBut the initial statement says John has 6 cousins, which is not a multiple of 5.\n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cousins are from extended families, and there are overlapping relationships.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the initial count of 6 cousins includes some who are siblings to each other.\n\nWait, but if some cousins are siblings, then they share the same parents, which would make them part of the same family.\n\nBut the problem states that each cousin has 4 siblings, implying that each cousin is part of a family with 5 children.\n\nTherefore, if John has cousins from multiple families, each family has 5 cousins.\n\nSo, the total number of cousins should be 5 times the number of such families.\n\nBut 5 times any integer cannot equal 6, since 6 is not a multiple of 5.\n\nThis suggests that there might be an error in the initial assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cousins are from multiple generations or some other relationship that isn't directly first cousins.\n\nThis is getting too confusing.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSuppose John has 6 cousins, and each of these cousins has 4 siblings who are also cousins to John.\n\nIf these siblings are not already included in the initial count of 6 cousins, then the total number of cousins would be the initial 6 plus the additional siblings who are cousins.\n\nBut, if each of the 6 cousins has 4 siblings who are also cousins, that would suggest 6 * 4 = 24 additional cousins.\n\nTherefore, the total number of cousins would be 6 + 24 = 30 cousins.\n\nHowever, this seems too straightforward and might be missing some overlapping relationships.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some of these siblings are being double-counted.\n\nFor example, if cousin A has siblings B, C, D, E, and cousin B also has siblings A, C, D, E, then counting their siblings separately would lead to double-counting.\n\nBut in this case, since each cousin has exactly 4 siblings, and assuming that siblings are unique across families, then the total should be 6 + 24 = 30 cousins.\n\nWait, but this seems inconsistent with the initial statement that John has 6 cousins.\n\nPerhaps the question is trying to trick us into thinking that the cousins have siblings who are also cousins, but in reality, the initial count of 6 cousins already includes all possible cousins, including siblings.\n\nIn that case, the total number of cousins would remain 6, and the information about each having 4 siblings is irrelevant or misleading.\n\nBut that seems like a trick question, and I'm not sure if that's the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cousins are double-counted because some of them are siblings.\n\nFor example, if there are 5 cousins in one family and 1 in another, but that doesn't add up to 6.\n\nWait, 5 +1=6, but in this case, the single cousin would have no siblings, which contradicts the statement that each cousin has 4 siblings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are two families, each with 5 cousins, but that would make the total number of cousins 10, which is more than 6.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should look at it differently.\n\nIf each cousin has 4 siblings, and these siblings are also cousins to John, then the total number of cousins is the sum of the initial cousins and their siblings who are also cousins.\n\nBut, since siblings are shared among cousins, we need to account for that.\n\nFor example, if there are 5 cousins in a family (since each has 4 siblings), then these 5 are all cousins to John.\n\nSo, if John has cousins from multiple families, each family contributing 5 cousins, then the total number of cousins would be 5 times the number of such families.\n\nBut, as mentioned before, 5 times any integer doesn't equal 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is only one family with 5 cousins, and another family with 1 cousin.\n\nBut in this case, the single cousin would have no siblings, which contradicts the statement that each cousin has 4 siblings.\n\nThis suggests that the initial information might be inconsistent or impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cousins are from multiple generations or have some other complex relationship that isn't being considered here.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for me to figure out.\n\nGiven all this confusion, perhaps the answer is simply that John has 6 cousins, and the information about each having 4 siblings is just additional information that doesn't change the initial count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of cousins is 30, as calculated earlier.\n\nBut considering the inconsistencies in the numbers, I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe the correct answer is that the information provided is contradictory, and therefore, the total number of cousins cannot be determined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to interpret \"each cousin has 4 siblings.\"\n\nMaybe the siblings are not all cousins to John, or perhaps some other relationship.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best answer is that John has 30 cousins in total, considering that each of the initial 6 cousins has 4 siblings who are also cousins, adding 24 more cousins to the total.\n\nSo, total cousins = 6 + 24 = 30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
