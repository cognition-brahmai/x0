        "content": "The conflict you're referring to is the Korean War, which took place from 1950 to 1953. It was a significant event in the 20th century, involving military support from both the United States and China, among other nations.\n\nThe war began when North Korea, supported by the Soviet Union and China, invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950. The United Nations, with the United States as the principal military power, intervened to support South Korea. China entered the war on the side of North Korea in November 1950, and the Soviet Union provided additional military and logistical support.\n\nThe Korean War ended in an armistice on July 27, 1953, which established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) as a buffer between the two Koreas. However, no formal peace treaty was ever signed, and the two Koreas remain technically at war to this day.\n\nThe war had a profound impact on the Korean Peninsula and the international community, shaping the political and military landscape of the region for decades to come. It also played a significant role in the early stages of the Cold War, as it was one of the first major conflicts involving the United States and China as opposing forces.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **Dates:** June 25, 1950 \u2013 July 27, 1953\n\n- **Belligerents:**\n\n  - North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) supported by China and the Soviet Union\n\n  - South Korea (Republic of Korea) supported by the United Nations, primarily the United States\n\n- **Outcome:** Armistice agreement leading to the establishment of the DMZ; no formal peace treaty signed\n\n- **Significance:** A key episode in the Cold War, influencing international relations and the balance of power in East Asia\n\n**Further Reading:**\n\n- **Books:**\n\n  - \"This Is Korea!\" by George Hodges\n\n  - \"The Korean War: A History\" by Bruce Cumings\n\n- **Documentaries:**\n\n  - \"The Korean War\" by BBC\n\n  - \"The Korean War: Fire and Ice\" by PBS\n\n- **Online Resources:**\n\n  - Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation\n\n  - United Nations Command Military Armistice Commission\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further details, feel free to ask!"
