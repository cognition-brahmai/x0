This could be done on a weekly or monthly basis, depending on what works best for you.\n\n2. **Adopt the One-In, One-Out Rule:** For every new item you bring into your home, remove an old one. This helps maintain a balance and prevents accumulation of unnecessary possessions.\n\n3. **Limit Your Possessions:** Set a limit on the number of items you own in different categories, such as clothing, books, or electronics. This can help you make more mindful purchasing decisions.\n\n4. **Practice Minimalist Decor:** Keep your living space clean and uncluttered by choosing simple, functional furniture and decor. Avoid overcrowding your space with too many decorative items.\n\n5. **Digital Minimalism:** Apply minimalist principles to your digital life as well. Regularly clean up your digital files, unsubscribe from unnecessary emails, and limit your use of social media to reduce mental clutter."
