        "content": "Let's see here. The train is going from City A to City B, and the total distance is 300 miles. It's traveling at a constant speed, which is good to know because that means the speed doesn't change throughout the journey.\n\nThe question says that the train takes 4 hours to travel halfway. Halfway would be half of the total distance, so that's 150 miles. So, it takes 4 hours to cover 150 miles.\n\nNow, since the speed is constant, the time to cover the second half should be the same as the first half, right? Because the speed doesn't change.\n\nSo, if the first half takes 4 hours, the second half should also take 4 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time to reach City B would be 4 hours plus 4 hours, which is 8 hours.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this to confirm?\n\nWell, I could calculate the speed of the train. Speed is distance divided by time.\n\nSo, speed = 150 miles / 4 hours = 37.5 miles per hour.\n\nThen, for the total distance of 300 miles, time = distance / speed = 300 miles / 37.5 mph.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 300 divided by 37.5. 37.5 times 8 is 300, so yes, 8 hours.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like the train will take 8 hours to reach City B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
