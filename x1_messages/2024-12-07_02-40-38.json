You can hear the soft chirping of unseen creatures and the gentle rustling of leaves in the breeze.\n\nBefore you lies the vast forest, its canopy stretching high above, filtering the sunlight into dappled patterns on the forest floor. The trees here are unlike any you've ever seen\u2014 their bark shimmers with iridescent hues, and their leaves seem to glow with an inner light.\n\nTo your left, you notice a narrow path winding its way deeper into the woods. To your right, there's a clearing where a group of luminescent butterflies flit about, their wings casting rainbow reflections on the ground. Straight ahead, a small brook trickles over smooth stones, its crystal-clear water inviting you to take a sip.\n\nWhich direction do you choose to explore first?"
