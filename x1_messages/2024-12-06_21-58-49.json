        "content": "In \"Casablanca,\" Ingrid Bergman's character, Ilsa Lund, doesn't say that exact line. The famous line is actually delivered by Humphrey Bogart's character, Rick Blaine, who says, \"Here's looking at you, kid.\" Ingrid Bergman's character replies with a smile, but she doesn't speak those words. The line has become iconic in cinema history and is often misquoted or attributed incorrectly. It's a testament to the enduring popularity of the film and its impact on popular culture."
