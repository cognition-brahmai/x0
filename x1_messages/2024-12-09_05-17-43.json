        "content": "So, let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a car rental company with 50 cars, and they rent each car out at an average rate of $30 per day. Each car is rented for an average of 15 days each month. We need to find out how much revenue they make in one month.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what revenue means in this context. Revenue is the total income generated from renting out the cars. So, it's the amount of money they get from all the cars rented out over a specific period, which in this case is one month.\n\nNow, let's break it down. There are 50 cars, and each car is rented for an average of 15 days in a month. So, for each car, the revenue generated would be the daily rental rate multiplied by the number of days it's rented out.\n\nSo, for one car, revenue = $30 per day * 15 days.\n\nLet me calculate that: 30 * 15 = $450.\n\nSo, each car brings in $450 in revenue per month.\n\nNow, since there are 50 cars, the total revenue for all cars would be the revenue per car multiplied by the number of cars.\n\nSo, total revenue = $450 per car * 50 cars.\n\nLet me do that math: 450 * 50.\n\nWell, 400 * 50 is 20,000, and 50 * 50 is 2,500. So, adding those together, 20,000 + 2,500 = $22,500.\n\nTherefore, the car rental company makes $22,500 in revenue per month.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, per car revenue: $30/day * 15 days = $450.\n\nThen, for 50 cars: $450 * 50 = $22,500.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of total car-days rented.\n\nTotal car-days = number of cars * average rental days per car = 50 * 15 = 750 car-days.\n\nThen, total revenue = total car-days * rental rate per day = 750 * $30 = $22,500.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the daily revenue and then multiply by the number of days in the month.\n\nDaily revenue = number of cars rented out per day * rental rate per day.\n\nBut wait, we don't know how many cars are rented out per day. We only know that each car is rented on average for 15 days a month.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that the rental periods can overlap, meaning multiple cars can be rented on the same day, then the total revenue would indeed be the sum of each car's individual revenue.\n\nIn this case, since each car is rented for 15 days, and there are 50 cars, the total car-days is 750, and at $30 per day, that's $22,500.\n\nBut let me consider if there's another way to interpret this.\n\nIs there any other factor that could affect the revenue, like cars being unavailable for rental on some days, or different rental rates, etc.?\n\nThe problem states that the average rental rate is $30 per day, and each car is rented for an average of 15 days each month.\n\nIt doesn't mention any variations in rental rates or any unrentable days, so I think the calculation is straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the total monthly revenue is $22,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22500} \\]"
