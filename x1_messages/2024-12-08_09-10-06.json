        "content": "So I have this problem here about a car dealership selling cars at an average rate of 3 cars per day, and I need to find the probability that exactly 5 cars will be sold on a given day, assuming a Poisson distribution. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a Poisson distribution is. I think it's a probability distribution that's used to model the number of events happening in a fixed interval of time or space, given a constant mean rate. In this case, the event is selling a car, the fixed interval is one day, and the average rate is 3 cars per day. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the formula for the Poisson probability mass function is:\n\n\\[ P(k; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of events I'm interested in (in this case, 5 cars sold).\n\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the average rate of events (here, 3 cars per day).\n\n- \\( e \\) is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to 2.71828.\n\nAlright, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ P(5; 3) = \\frac{3^5 e^{-3}}{5!} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 3^5 \\):\n\n\\[ 3^5 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 243 \\]\n\nNext, calculate \\( e^{-3} \\). I know that \\( e \\) is approximately 2.71828, so:\n\n\\[ e^{-3} \\approx 0.049787 \\]\n\nThen, calculate \\( 5! \\) (5 factorial):\n\n\\[ 5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120 \\]\n\nNow, put it all together:\n\n\\[ P(5; 3) = \\frac{243 \\times 0.049787}{120} \\]\n\nFirst, multiply 243 by 0.049787:\n\n\\[ 243 \\times 0.049787 \\approx 12.098 \\]\n\nThen, divide by 120:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12.098}{120} \\approx 0.1008 \\]\n\nSo, the probability of selling exactly 5 cars in a given day is approximately 0.1008, or 10.08%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\n\\[ P(5; 3) = \\frac{3^5 e^{-3}}{5!} \\]\n\n\\[ 3^5 = 243 \\]\n\n\\[ e^{-3} \\approx 0.049787 \\]\n\n\\[ 5! = 120 \\]\n\n\\[ P(5; 3) = \\frac{243 \\times 0.049787}{120} \\]\n\n\\[ 243 \\times 0.049787 = 12.098 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{12.098}{120} = 0.1008 \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a Poisson distribution table or a calculator to verify this value. But since I'm doing it manually, I'll trust my calculations.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in a Poisson distribution, the mean (\\( \\lambda \\)) is equal to the variance. So here, both the mean and variance are 3. But I don't think that's directly relevant to solving this specific problem.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the Poisson distribution is appropriate when events occur independently and at a constant average rate. In the context of car sales, this might be a reasonable assumption if sales are spread out randomly throughout the day and aren't influenced by each other.\n\nBut perhaps there are factors that could affect this assumption. For example, if selling one car makes it more likely to sell another (maybe due to customer traffic or sales promotions), then the independence assumption might be violated, and the Poisson distribution might not be the best model. However, for the purposes of this problem, we're assuming it is Poisson, so I'll proceed with that.\n\nAlso, Poisson distribution is often used for modeling rare events, but in this case, with an average of 3 cars per day, it's not necessarily rare, but it's still applicable.\n\nJust to explore further, what if I wanted to find the probability of selling 5 or more cars? I could calculate the cumulative probability from 5 to infinity, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, I could calculate the cumulative probability from 0 to 4 and subtract that from 1.\n\nBut for this problem, I only need the probability of exactly 5 cars, so I don't need to go there.\n\nLet me also consider if there's any other distribution that might be more appropriate. For example, if the number of potential customers is known and each has a certain probability of buying a car, a binomial distribution might be more suitable. But since the problem specifies a Poisson distribution, I'll stick with that.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability of selling exactly 5 cars in a given day is approximately 0.1008, or 10.08%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.1008} \\]"
