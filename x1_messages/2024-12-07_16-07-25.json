        "content": "So there are 50 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes occur in total. Hmm, this sounds like a problem about combinations, where order doesn't matter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. Each handshake is between two people, and it doesn't matter who initiates the handshake; it's the same handshake either way. So, it's not like a situation where order matters, like arranging people in a line.\n\nI recall that in combinatorics, the number of ways to choose k items from n items without regard to order is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, I need to choose 2 people out of 50 to shake hands, so n = 50 and k = 2.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n\\[\nC(50, 2) = \\frac{50!}{2!(50 - 2)!} = \\frac{50!}{2! \\cdot 48!}\n\\]\n\nNow, 50! is 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48!, so the 48! cancels out:\n\n\\[\nC(50, 2) = \\frac{50 \\times 49 \\times 48!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 48!} = \\frac{50 \\times 49}{2} = \\frac{2450}{2} = 1225\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 1225 handshakes.\n\nBut wait, let me think about this another way to confirm. If there are 50 people, and each shakes hands with 49 others, that would be 50 \u00d7 49 = 2450 handshakes. But in this approach, each handshake is counted twice\u2014once for each participant. So, to get the actual number of unique handshakes, I need to divide by 2.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total handshakes} = \\frac{50 \\times 49}{2} = 1225\n\\]\n\nThat matches the earlier result. Good, it's consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the first person shaking hands with 49 others, the second person shaking hands with the remaining 48 (since they've already shaken hands with the first person), and so on, down to the last two people who shake hands once.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be:\n\n49 + 48 + 47 + ... + 2 + 1\n\nThis is the sum of the first 49 positive integers, which is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nBut in this case, it's the sum from 1 to 49:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\frac{49 \\times 50}{2} = 1225\n\\]\n\nAgain, the same answer. So, no matter which way I approach it, I keep getting 1225 handshakes.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility of overlapping handshakes or some handshakes being counted multiple times, but since each handshake is unique and between two distinct people, and each pair shakes hands only once, I don't think there's any overlap.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as forming a complete graph with 50 vertices, where each vertex represents a person and each edge represents a handshake. In a complete graph, the number of edges is given by C(n, 2), which again is 1225.\n\nSo, all these different approaches lead me to the same conclusion that there are 1225 handshakes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1225.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1225} \\]"
