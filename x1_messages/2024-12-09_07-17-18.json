        "content": "Let's calculate the total weekly payroll expense for the company. We have two types of employees: full-time and part-time. \n\nFirst, let's figure out the weekly earnings for each type of employee.\n\nFor full-time employees:\n\n- They work 40 hours per week.\n\n- They earn $20 per hour.\n\nSo, the weekly earnings for one full-time employee would be:\n\n40 hours/week * $20/hour = $800/week\n\nThe company has 30 full-time employees, so the total weekly payroll for full-time employees is:\n\n30 employees * $800/employee/week = $24,000/week\n\nNow, for part-time employees:\n\n- They work 25 hours per week.\n\n- They earn $15 per hour.\n\nSo, the weekly earnings for one part-time employee would be:\n\n25 hours/week * $15/hour = $375/week\n\nThe company has 20 part-time employees, so the total weekly payroll for part-time employees is:\n\n20 employees * $375/employee/week = $7,500/week\n\nFinally, to find the total weekly payroll expense for the company, we add the full-time and part-time payrolls together:\n\n$24,000/week (full-time) + $7,500/week (part-time) = $31,500/week\n\nTherefore, the company's total weekly payroll expense is $31,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{31500} \\]"
