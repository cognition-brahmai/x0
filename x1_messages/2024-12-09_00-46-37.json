        "content": "That's a classic! The theorem you're referring to is called the Pythagorean Theorem. It's named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who is credited with its discovery, although it was known to other cultures before his time. The theorem is fundamental in Euclidean geometry and has numerous applications in mathematics and science.\n\nIn mathematical terms, for a right-angled triangle with sides of lengths a, b, and c, where c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle), the Pythagorean Theorem states that:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n\nThis means that the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nThe theorem has been proven in many different ways, and it's not only useful in geometry but also in trigonometry, physics, and engineering. It's a cornerstone of mathematical knowledge and is taught in schools worldwide.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, the famous theorem you're thinking of is indeed the Pythagorean Theorem."
