        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a gardener who plants 8 trees in a straight line, and they're all spaced equally apart. We need to figure out how many pairs of trees have the same distance between them as the first pair of trees.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what is meant by \"the first pair of trees.\" I think this refers to the two trees that are closest together, which, since all trees are equally spaced, would actually mean that every pair of adjacent trees has the same distance between them. So, if the trees are equally spaced, the distance between tree 1 and tree 2 is the same as between tree 2 and tree 3, and so on, up to tree 7 and tree 8.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is asking for pairs of trees that have the same distance as the first pair. If all adjacent pairs have the same distance, then wouldn't all adjacent pairs have the same distance as the first pair?\n\nLet me visualize this. If I have 8 trees in a straight line, like this:\n\nTree 1 \u2014\u2014 Tree 2 \u2014\u2014 Tree 3 \u2014\u2014 Tree 4 \u2014\u2014 Tree 5 \u2014\u2014 Tree 6 \u2014\u2014 Tree 7 \u2014\u2014 Tree 8\n\nWhere \"\u2014\u2014\" represents the equal spacing between each pair of adjacent trees.\n\nSo, the first pair is tree 1 and tree 2, and their distance is, say, \"d.\"\n\nNow, the next pair is tree 2 and tree 3, which also have distance \"d,\" and so on.\n\nSo, all adjacent pairs have distance \"d.\"\n\nBut the question is about \"pairs\" of trees, not just adjacent pairs. Maybe it's including non-adjacent pairs as well.\n\nLet me think about that. If we have 8 trees, the total number of possible pairs is \"8 choose 2,\" which is 28.\n\nBut not all of these pairs will have the same distance \"d.\" Only the adjacent pairs will have distance \"d.\"\n\nWait, but maybe there are other pairs that coincidentally have the same distance \"d\" due to the equal spacing.\n\nLet me consider the positions of the trees. If the trees are planted in a straight line with equal distances, their positions can be represented as:\n\nPosition of tree 1: 0\n\nPosition of tree 2: d\n\nPosition of tree 3: 2d\n\nPosition of tree 4: 3d\n\nPosition of tree 5: 4d\n\nPosition of tree 6: 5d\n\nPosition of tree 7: 6d\n\nPosition of tree 8: 7d\n\nNow, the distance between any two trees, say tree i and tree j, would be |position of j - position of i|, which is |(j-1)d - (i-1)d| = |(j - i)|d.\n\nSo, the distance between tree i and tree j is |j - i| * d.\n\nNow, the first pair is tree 1 and tree 2, which have a distance of d.\n\nSo, we're looking for all pairs of trees where the distance is d.\n\nGiven the formula above, that would be all pairs where |j - i| = 1.\n\nSo, that's all adjacent pairs.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8.\n\nThat's 7 pairs.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the first pair of trees,\" and specifies \"the same distance between them as the first pair of trees.\" So, if all adjacent pairs have the same distance, then the number should be 7.\n\nBut maybe there's a trick here. Maybe there are non-adjacent pairs that also have distance d due to some symmetry or something.\n\nBut looking at the positions, that doesn't seem possible. If you pick two trees that are not adjacent, say tree 1 and tree 3, their distance is 2d, which is different from d.\n\nSimilarly, tree 1 and tree 4 would be 3d, and so on.\n\nSo, only adjacent pairs have distance d.\n\nTherefore, the number of pairs with distance d is 7.\n\nWait, but let's double-check.\n\nIf we have 8 trees, the number of adjacent pairs is indeed 7.\n\nAlternatively, in general, for n trees in a straight line with equal spacing, the number of adjacent pairs is n - 1.\n\nSo, for n = 8, it's 7.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 7.\n\nBut perhaps the question is trying to trick us into thinking about different distances, but no, since all adjacent pairs have the same distance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"first pair\" is not necessarily the first two trees, but perhaps some other pair, but the wording suggests it's the first pair of trees, which probably is tree 1 and tree 2.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let's consider if \"the first pair of trees\" could refer to something else, but it's unclear. Given the straightforward interpretation, it's tree 1 and tree 2.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
