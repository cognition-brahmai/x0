Before leaving, they store their food supplies in separate bags: Tom's bag is green, Jerry's is blue, and Sue's is red. A mischievous raccoon enters the campsite while they're away and rummages through the bags, mixing up the contents of each bag. Later, when the friends return from fishing, where will they expect to find their individual food supplies?"

So, Tom would check the green bag, Jerry would check the blue bag, and Sue would check the red bag. They might have to sort through the contents to find their own items, but they'll look in their own bags first."
