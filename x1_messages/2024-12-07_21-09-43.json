        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a triangle with sides of 5 cm, 6 cm, and 7 cm. I need to find its semi-perimeter and then use Heron's formula to find its area. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the semi-perimeter. I know that the semi-perimeter is just half of the perimeter of the triangle. The perimeter is the sum of all the sides, so for this triangle, it would be 5 cm + 6 cm + 7 cm. Let me add those up: 5 plus 6 is 11, and then 11 plus 7 is 18 cm. So, the perimeter is 18 cm. Now, the semi-perimeter is half of that, so I just divide by 2. 18 divided by 2 is 9 cm. Okay, so the semi-perimeter is 9 cm.\n\nNext, Heron's formula for the area. Heron's formula says that the area of a triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and semi-perimeter s, is the square root of s times (s - a) times (s - b) times (s - c). So, I have s = 9 cm, and the sides are a = 5 cm, b = 6 cm, and c = 7 cm.\n\nLet me plug these values into the formula. First, I calculate s - a, which is 9 - 5 = 4 cm. Then s - b is 9 - 6 = 3 cm. And s - c is 9 - 7 = 2 cm. Now, I multiply these together: s times (s - a) times (s - b) times (s - c), which is 9 * 4 * 3 * 2.\n\nLet's calculate that step by step. 9 times 4 is 36. 36 times 3 is 108. 108 times 2 is 216. So, the product is 216 cm\u00b2. Now, the area is the square root of this product. So, I need to find the square root of 216.\n\nHmm, 216 isn't a perfect square, but I can simplify it. I know that 216 can be factored into 36 times 6, and 36 is a perfect square. So, the square root of 216 is the square root of 36 times the square root of 6, which is 6 times the square root of 6.\n\nAlternatively, if I want a decimal approximation, I can calculate it. The square root of 216 is approximately 14.6969 cm\u00b2. But since the problem doesn't specify, I can leave it in terms of the square root, which is more exact.\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 6 times the square root of 6 cm\u00b2, or approximately 14.7 cm\u00b2.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I remember that for Heron's formula, sometimes it's easy to make a calculation mistake, especially with multiplying and taking square roots.\n\nLet me verify the steps again. Perimeter is 5 + 6 + 7 = 18 cm, semi-perimeter s = 9 cm. Then, s - a = 9 - 5 = 4 cm, s - b = 9 - 6 = 3 cm, s - c = 9 - 7 = 2 cm. Then, s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) = 9 * 4 * 3 * 2 = 216 cm\u00b2. Square root of 216 is indeed 6\u221a6 cm\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if there's another way to find the area to confirm this result. Maybe using the formula for the area of a triangle with sides a, b, and c using the cosine rule to find an angle and then using (1/2)ab sin C.\n\nLet's try that. First, I can use the cosine rule to find one of the angles. Let's find the angle opposite the largest side, which is 7 cm. So, angle C opposite side c = 7 cm.\n\nThe cosine rule states that c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab cos C. Plugging in the values: 7\u00b2 = 5\u00b2 + 6\u00b2 - 2*5*6*cos C.\n\nSo, 49 = 25 + 36 - 60 cos C.\n\nThat simplifies to 49 = 61 - 60 cos C.\n\nSubtract 61 from both sides: 49 - 61 = -60 cos C \u2192 -12 = -60 cos C.\n\nDivide both sides by -60: cos C = (-12)/(-60) = 12/60 = 0.2.\n\nSo, angle C is arccos(0.2). Using a calculator, arccos(0.2) is approximately 78.46 degrees.\n\nNow, the area of the triangle can also be calculated using (1/2)ab sin C.\n\nSo, area = (1/2)*5*6*sin(78.46\u00b0).\n\nFirst, find sin(78.46\u00b0). Sin(78.46\u00b0) is approximately 0.9781.\n\nSo, area = (1/2)*5*6*0.9781 = (1/2)*30*0.9781 = 15*0.9781 = approximately 14.6715 cm\u00b2.\n\nThis is very close to the earlier result of approximately 14.7 cm\u00b2 using Heron's formula, so that gives me confidence that the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I want an exact answer, I'll stick with 6\u221a6 cm\u00b2.\n\nLet me see if I can rationalize that or express it differently.\n\n6\u221a6 is already simplified, as 6 is not a perfect square.\n\nAlternatively, I could express it in terms of decimal approximation, but since the problem didn't specify, I'll keep it in radical form.\n\nSo, to summarize, the semi-perimeter is 9 cm, and the area is 6\u221a6 cm\u00b2, or approximately 14.7 cm\u00b2.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe semi-perimeter of the triangle is \\boxed{9 \\text{ cm}} and the area is \\boxed{6\\sqrt{6} \\text{ cm}^2} (approximately \\boxed{14.7 \\text{ cm}^2})."
