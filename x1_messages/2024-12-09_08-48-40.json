        "content": "Alright, I have this task to build a URL shortener service using Golang, where users can submit a long URL via an HTTP POST request and get a shortened URL in return. These mappings need to be stored in a Cassandra database, and when someone visits the shortened URL, they should be redirected to the original URL. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a basic Go web server. I'm familiar with the net/http package, which should suffice for handling HTTP requests and responses. I'll need to create endpoints for submitting URLs and for redirecting users.\n\nFor the URL shortening functionality, I need to generate unique short codes for each long URL. I could use UUIDs, but they're too long. Maybe I can generate random alphanumeric strings of a fixed length, say 6 characters, and check if they already exist in the database before assigning them.\n\nWait, generating random strings and checking for duplicates might not be efficient, especially as the number of URLs grows. There's a chance of collisions. Maybe a better approach is to use an incremental integer ID and convert it to a shorter string using base64 or a similar encoding scheme. That way, each ID is unique by design.\n\nBut then, I need to ensure that the integer IDs are sequential and without gaps. Cassandra handles partitions well, but managing auto-incrementing IDs might be tricky. Maybe I can use a distributed counter or have a separate table to store the next available ID.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a hash function to generate a fixed-size string from the long URL. However, hashes can be long, and I want the shortened URLs to be as short as possible. Maybe I can take the first N characters of the hash.\n\nBut that might still be too long. Perhaps I can use a combination of both approaches: generate a hash, take a portion of it, and check for duplicates. If a duplicate is found, generate a new code.\n\nAnother idea is to use a UUID in its compact form, but even that might be longer than desirable. Maybe I can encode the UUID in base64 to make it shorter.\n\nBut let's think differently. Maybe I can use a combination of the user's IP address and the timestamp to generate a unique code. That way, it's less likely to have duplicates.\n\nWait, but that might not be reliable. If multiple users submit URLs at the same time, there could still be collisions.\n\nPerhaps I should stick with generating random strings and handle collisions by regenerating until a unique code is found. In Cassandra, I can make the short code the primary key, which ensures uniqueness.\n\nOkay, so for the database schema, I'll need a table with columns for the short code and the long URL. Something like:\n\nCREATE TABLE url_mapping (\n\n    short_code text PRIMARY KEY,\n\n    long_url text\n\n);\n\nIn Go, I'll need to connect to the Cassandra cluster using a driver like gocql. I'll need to set up a session and manage connections properly.\n\nFor generating short codes, I'll create a function that generates a random alphanumeric string of a fixed length, say 6 characters. Then, I'll check if that code already exists in the database. If it does, generate another one, and so on, until a unique code is found.\n\nBut this could be inefficient if the database grows large. Maybe instead of generating random codes, I can assign incremental IDs starting from 1, convert them to a shorter string using base64 or a custom encoding, and use that as the short code.\n\nYes, that sounds better. I can have a counter that increments every time a new URL is submitted. Then, I can encode that integer ID into a shorter string.\n\nTo encode integers into shorter strings, I can use base64 encoding, but it includes characters like '+' and '/', which might not be URL-friendly. Maybe I can use base64url encoding, which uses only alphanumeric characters and '-_'.\n\nEven better, I can use base62 encoding, which uses digits and both uppercase and lowercase letters, making the short codes even shorter.\n\nLet me look up how to implement base62 encoding in Go. I'm sure there are libraries available for that.\n\nOnce I have the encoding scheme, I need to manage the incremental IDs. Since Cassandra is distributed, managing a single counter could be tricky. I can use a COUNTER column, but they have limitations.\n\nAlternatively, I can have a separate table to store the next available ID and use CAS (Compare-And-Swap) operations to increment it in a distributed manner.\n\nSo, I'll create another table called \"id_counter\" with a single row that holds the current ID.\n\nCREATE TABLE id_counter (\n\n    id_name text PRIMARY KEY,\n\n    current_id counter\n\n);\n\nThen, I can use the UPDATE ... USING TIMESTAMP to increment the counter in a distributed way.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Cassandra's counters are designed to be eventually consistent, which might be acceptable for my use case.\n\nBut I need to ensure that each short code is unique and corresponds to a specific long URL.\n\nMaybe instead of using counters, I can let Cassandra handle the uniqueness through its partition key. I can generate UUIDs for each entry and use them as the primary key, but again, UUIDs are long.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use time-based UUIDs (UUID version 1), which are based on the current timestamp and the machine's MAC address. That ensures uniqueness, but the UUID string is still long.\n\nIf I encode the UUID using base64url, it might be shorter, but probably still longer than I'd like.\n\nMaybe I should compromise and accept slightly longer short codes in exchange for easier implementation.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a hybrid approach: use incremental IDs for the Cassandra primary key but encode them into shorter strings for the short codes.\n\nSo, the Cassandra table would look like this:\n\nCREATE TABLE url_mapping (\n\n    id timeuuid PRIMARY KEY,\n\n    short_code text,\n\n    long_url text\n\n);\n\nBut then I need to ensure that the short_code is unique. So, I'd still need to generate unique short codes and check for duplicates.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should simplify and just use random short codes, accepting the small risk of collisions.\n\nIn software engineering, sometimes it's acceptable to have a small probability of errors if it significantly simplifies the system.\n\nSo, let's proceed with generating random short codes of, say, 6 alphanumeric characters. The total number of possible codes would be 62^6, which is about 56 billion. That should be more than enough for our purposes.\n\nIn Go, I can generate random strings using the crypto/rand package.\n\nHere's a rough idea of how to generate a random short code:\n\nfunc generateShortCode(length int) string {\n\n    const charset = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789\"\n\n    bytes := make([]byte, length)\n\n    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())\n\n    for i := 0; i < length; i++ {\n\n        randomIndex := rand.Intn(len(charset))\n\n        bytes[i] = charset[randomIndex]\n\n    }\n\n    return string(bytes)\n\n}\n\nThen, before inserting into the database, check if the generated short code already exists. If it does, generate a new one.\n\nBut as the number of URLs increases, the chance of collisions grows, and the loop might take longer.\n\nTo mitigate this, I can set a maximum number of retry attempts. If after N attempts, I still can't find a unique code, return an error.\n\nNow, for the HTTP endpoints. I need two main endpoints:\n\n1. POST /shorten - to submit a long URL and get a shortened URL in response.\n\n2. GET /{short_code} - to redirect users to the original long URL based on the short code.\n\nLet's consider the POST endpoint first.\n\nWhen a user sends a POST request to /shorten with the long URL in the request body, I need to:\n\n- Generate a random short code.\n\n- Check if it already exists in the database.\n\n- If it does, generate a new one.\n\n- If it doesn't, insert the mapping into the database.\n\n- Return the shortened URL to the user.\n\nI need to decide on the format of the request and response. For the request, probably JSON with a \"url\" field. For the response, also JSON with the shortened URL.\n\nError handling is important here. If the URL is invalid or if there are database errors, I need to return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.\n\nFor the GET endpoint, when a user visits /{short_code}, I need to:\n\n- Retrieve the long URL from the database based on the short code.\n\n- If it exists, perform a HTTP redirect to the long URL using status code 302.\n\n- If it doesn't exist, return a 404 Not Found.\n\nI should also think about tracking URL hits. Maybe increment a counter every time a short URL is accessed.\n\nFor that, I can add another column in the database to keep track of the number of hits.\n\nCREATE TABLE url_mapping (\n\n    short_code text PRIMARY KEY,\n\n    long_url text,\n\n    hit_count counter\n\n);\n\nThen, every time a short URL is accessed, I can increment the hit_count.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Cassandra counters are the best way to do this, as they might have performance implications.\n\nAlternatively, I can have a separate table for hit counts and use batch operations to update them.\n\nBut for now, let's keep it simple and focus on the core functionality.\n\nAnother consideration is URL validation. I need to ensure that the provided long URL is valid before storing it.\n\nIn Go, I can use the net/url package to parse and validate URLs.\n\nIf the URL is not valid, I should return an error to the user.\n\nAlso, I need to think about security. Since users can submit any URL, including malicious ones, I should consider implementing some kind of filtering or warnings.\n\nBut for the scope of this project, I'll assume that the users are trusted or that the service is intended for internal use.\n\nError handling and logging are crucial. I need to handle database connection errors, query errors, and other runtime errors gracefully, providing meaningful error messages to the user when appropriate.\n\nI should also log important events and errors for monitoring and debugging purposes.\n\nNow, let's think about the Cassandra setup. I need to install Cassandra and set up a keyspace and tables.\n\nI'll need to choose an appropriate replication factor based on the deployment environment.\n\nIn development, I can set up a single-node cluster, but for production, I'll need multiple nodes for fault tolerance.\n\nI need to ensure that the Cassandra driver is properly configured in Go, with connection pooling and retry policies.\n\nSpeaking of deployment, I need to consider how to run this service. Maybe use Docker for containerization, and deploy it to a cloud platform like AWS or GCP.\n\nBut for now, I'll focus on getting the core functionality working locally.\n\nLet me outline the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Set up a new Go module for the project.\n\n2. Install the necessary dependencies: net/http for the web server, gocql for Cassandra connectivity, and net/url for URL parsing.\n\n3. Set up the Cassandra keyspace and table schema.\n\n4. Write the Go code to connect to Cassandra and perform CRUD operations.\n\n5. Implement the HTTP endpoints for submitting URLs and redirecting users.\n\n6. Test the service to ensure it works as expected.\n\n7. Deploy the service to a local server or a cloud platform.\n\nLet me start by setting up the Go module.\n\nI'll create a new directory for the project and initialize it with:\n\nmkdir url-shortener\n\ncd url-shortener\n\ngo mod init urlshortener\n\nThen, I'll install the gocql package:\n\ngo get github.com/gocql/gocql\n\nNow, I need to set up Cassandra. I'll download the Cassandra community edition and start a single-node cluster.\n\nOnce Cassandra is running, I'll connect to it using the cqlsh command-line tool and create a keyspace and table.\n\nFor example:\n\nCREATE KEYSPACE urlshortener WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};\n\nUSE urlshortener;\n\nCREATE TABLE url_mapping (\n\n    short_code text PRIMARY KEY,\n\n    long_url text\n\n);\n\nOkay, now that the database is set up, I need to write the Go code to interact with it.\n\nFirst, I'll create a new Go file, maybe main.go, and import the necessary packages.\n\nThen, I'll set up the Cassandra session in the main function.\n\nI need to provide the contact points and keyspace name to the gocql package.\n\nFor example:\n\ncluster := gocql.NewCluster(\"127.0.0.1\")\n\ncluster.Keyspace = \"urlshortener\"\n\nsession, err := cluster.CreateSession()\n\nif err != nil {\n\n    log.Fatal(err)\n\n}\n\ndefer session.Close()\n\nWith the session established, I can perform queries using session.Query().\n\nNow, I need to implement the POST /shorten endpoint.\n\nI'll define a struct to represent the request and response payloads.\n\ntype ShortenRequest struct {\n\n    URL string `json:\"url\"`\n\n}\n\ntype ShortenResponse struct {\n\n    ShortURL string `json:\"short_url\"`\n\n}\n\nThen, I'll write the handler function for the POST endpoint.\n\nfunc shortenHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\n    decoder := json.NewDecoder(r.Body)\n\n    var req ShortenRequest\n\n    err := decoder.Decode(&req)\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        http.Error(w, \"Bad request\", http.StatusBadRequest)\n\n        return\n\n    }\n\n    // Validate the URL\n\n    _, err = url.ParseRequestURI(req.URL)\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        http.Error(w, \"Invalid URL\", http.StatusBadRequest)\n\n        return\n\n    }\n\n    // Generate a short code\n\n    shortCode := generateShortCode(6)\n\n    // Check if the short code already exists\n\n    exists, err := checkShortCodeExists(session, shortCode)\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        http.Error(w, \"Database error\", http.StatusInternalServerError)\n\n        return\n\n    }\n\n    if exists {\n\n        // Generate a new short code and retry\n\n        // For now, just return an error\n\n        http.Error(w, \"Short code already exists\", http.StatusInternalServerError)\n\n        return\n\n    }\n\n    // Insert the mapping into the database\n\n    err = insertMapping(session, shortCode, req.URL)\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        http.Error(w, \"Database error\", http.StatusInternalServerError)\n\n        return\n\n    }\n\n    // Construct the short URL\n\n    shortURL := fmt.Sprintf(\"http://localhost:8080/%s\", shortCode)\n\n    // Return the short URL in the response\n\n    resp := ShortenResponse{ShortURL: shortURL}\n\n    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(resp)\n\n}\n\nI need to implement the generateShortCode, checkShortCodeExists, and insertMapping functions.\n\ngenerateShortCode is already outlined earlier.\n\ncheckShortCodeExists can be implemented with a SELECT query:\n\nfunc checkShortCodeExists(session *gocql.Session, shortCode string) (bool, error) {\n\n    var exists bool\n\n    err := session.Query(\"SELECT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM url_mapping WHERE short_code = ?)\", shortCode).Scan(&exists)\n\n    return exists, err\n\n}\n\ninsertMapping can be implemented with an INSERT query:\n\nfunc insertMapping(session *gocql.Session, shortCode, longURL string) error {\n\n    query := session.Query(\"INSERT INTO url_mapping (short_code, long_url) VALUES (?, ?)\", shortCode, longURL)\n\n    return query.Exec()\n\n}\n\nNext, I need to implement the GET /{short_code} endpoint for redirection.\n\nI'll define a handler function for this as well.\n\nfunc redirectHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\n    vars := mux.Vars(r)\n\n    shortCode := vars[\"short_code\"]\n\n    // Retrieve the long URL from the database\n\n    longURL, err := getLongURL(session, shortCode)\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        http.Error(w, \"Database error\", http.StatusInternalServerError)\n\n        return\n\n    }\n\n    if longURL == \"\" {\n\n        http.Error(w, \"Short code not found\", http.StatusNotFound)\n\n        return\n\n    }\n\n    // Perform the redirect\n\n    http.Redirect(w, r, longURL, http.StatusFound)\n\n}\n\nI need to implement the getLongURL function.\n\nfunc getLongURL(session *gocql.Session, shortCode string) (string, error) {\n\n    var longURL string\n\n    err := session.Query(\"SELECT long_url FROM url_mapping WHERE short_code = ?\", shortCode).Scan(&longURL)\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        if err == gocql.ErrNotFound {\n\n            return \"\", nil\n\n        }\n\n        return \"\", err\n\n    }\n\n    return longURL, nil\n\n}\n\nI should also think about URL encoding and decoding to handle special characters in the URLs.\n\nIn the redirectHandler, I need to ensure that the long URL is properly URL-encoded before performing the redirect.\n\nWait, actually, the long URL should be stored as-is in the database, and when retrieved, used directly in the Redirect function, which should handle the encoding properly.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the long URL is a valid URL.\n\nAlso, I should consider adding a limit to the number of redirects per second to prevent abuse.\n\nBut for now, I'll keep it simple.\n\nNow, I need to set up the HTTP routes using a router. I can use the net/http/pprof package or a third-party router like gorilla/mux.\n\nLet me add gorilla/mux to the project:\n\ngo get github.com/gorilla/mux\n\nThen, in the main function, I'll create a new router and define the routes.\n\nrouter := mux.NewRouter()\n\nrouter.HandleFunc(\"/shorten\", shortenHandler).Methods(\"POST\")\n\nrouter.HandleFunc(\"/({short_code})\", redirectHandler).Methods(\"GET\")\n\nhttp.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", router)\n\nWait, the redirectHandler route should capture the short_code parameter.\n\nSo, it should be:\n\nrouter.HandleFunc(\"/({short_code})\", redirectHandler).Methods(\"GET\")\n\nBut actually, in gorilla/mux, I need to define it like this:\n\nrouter.HandleFunc(\"/({short_code})\", redirectHandler).Methods(\"GET\")\n\nAnd in the handler function, I can access the short_code using mux.Vars(r)[\"short_code\"]\n\nI think I have the basic structure in place now.\n\nLet me summarize the steps again:\n\n1. Set up Go module and install dependencies.\n\n2. Set up Cassandra keyspace and table.\n\n3. Write Go code to connect to Cassandra.\n\n4. Implement POST /shorten endpoint:\n\na. Parse request JSON.\n\nb. Validate the URL.\n\nc. Generate a short code.\n\nd. Check if the short code exists in the database.\n\ne. If not, insert the mapping.\n\nf. Return the shortened URL.\n\n5. Implement GET /{short_code} endpoint:\n\na. Retrieve the long URL from the database.\n\nb. If found, perform a redirect to the long URL.\n\nc. If not found, return 404.\n\n6. Run the HTTP server on port 8080.\n\nI need to make sure that the short codes are case-sensitive, as URLs are case-sensitive.\n\nAlso, I should consider using a constant for the base URL in the ShortenResponse, so it can be configured easily.\n\nMaybe define a baseURL variable that includes the domain and port.\n\nconst baseURL = \"http://localhost:8080\"\n\nThen, construct the short URL as path.Join(baseURL, shortCode)\n\nWait, path.Join is for file paths, not URLs. I should use url.Join or manually concatenate the strings.\n\nshortURL := fmt.Sprintf(\"%s/%s\", baseURL, shortCode)\n\nAlso, I need to handle the trailing slash properly.\n\nActually, I can use the net/url package to build the URL correctly.\n\nu, _ := url.Parse(baseURL)\n\nshortURL := u.ResolveReference(&url.URL{Path: shortCode}).String()\n\nThis should handle the URL construction correctly.\n\nError handling is important here. I need to ensure that baseURL is a valid URL.\n\nI can define baseURL as a constant in the config or as an environment variable.\n\nLet me refactor that part.\n\nDefine a constant for baseURL.\n\nconst baseURL = \"http://localhost:8080\"\n\nThen, in the shortenHandler:\n\nu, _ := url.Parse(baseURL)\n\nshortURL := u.ResolveReference(&url.URL{Path: shortCode}).String()\n\nresp := ShortenResponse{ShortURL: shortURL}\n\njson.NewEncoder(w).Encode(resp)\n\nThis should work.\n\nNow, I need to test the service.\n\nI can use curl or Postman to send a POST request to /shorten with a JSON body containing the long URL, and verify that I get a shortened URL in response.\n\nThen, visit the shortened URL in a browser and check if it redirects to the original URL.\n\nI should also test edge cases, such as:\n\n- Invalid URL formats.\n\n- Duplicate short codes.\n\n- Non-existent short codes.\n\n- Concurrency: multiple requests at the same time.\n\nFor concurrency, I need to ensure that the short code generation and database operations are thread-safe.\n\nSince Cassandra is designed to handle concurrent operations, and Go's net/http handles concurrent requests, I should be fine as long as I don't have shared mutable state.\n\nIn the current implementation, the Cassandra session is shared across requests, but gocql sessions are thread-safe.\n\nThe generateShortCode function uses rand.Intn, which is not thread-safe if using the default global Rand. To fix that, I need to use a local Rand instance.\n\nSo, in generateShortCode, I should create a new rand.Rand with a new source for each call.\n\nHere's an updated version:\n\nfunc generateShortCode(length int) string {\n\n    const charset = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789\"\n\n    bytes := make([]byte, length)\n\n    rand := rand.New(rand.NewSource(time.Now().UnixNano()))\n\n    for i := 0; i < length; i++ {\n\n        randomIndex := rand.Intn(len(charset))\n\n        bytes[i] = charset[randomIndex]\n\n    }\n\n    return string(bytes)\n\n}\n\nThis ensures that each call to generateShortCode has its own random number generator.\n\nNow, regarding error handling in the database operations, I need to make sure that I handle errors properly and don't leak sensitive information in the responses.\n\nFor example, if there's a database connection error, I can log the error and return a generic \"Internal Server Error\" message to the user.\n\nAlso, I need to handle cases where the database is down or unreachable.\n\nIn such cases, the service should fail gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.\n\nLogging is essential for debugging and monitoring. I can use the standard log package or a more feature-rich logging library like logrus.\n\nFor now, I'll stick with the standard log package.\n\nI should log important events, such as when a URL is successfully shortened, when a redirect occurs, and when errors happen.\n\nFor example, in the shortenHandler, after inserting the mapping into the database, I can log the mapping:\n\nlog.Printf(\"Shortened %s to %s\", req.URL, shortURL)\n\nSimilarly, in the redirectHandler, after performing the redirect, I can log the access:\n\nlog.Printf(\"Redirected %s to %s\", shortCode, longURL)\n\nNow, let's think about URL normalization. Sometimes, URLs can have different forms but point to the same resource, such as with and without \"www\", or with different query parameters.\n\nTo save space and avoid duplicates, I might want to normalize the URLs before storing them.\n\nFor example, convert them to lowercase, remove trailing slashes, canonicalize the domain, etc.\n\nBut this adds complexity, and for now, I'll store the URLs as provided by the user.\n\nAnother consideration is URL expiration. Maybe I can allow users to set an expiration date for the shortened URL, after which it becomes invalid.\n\nTo implement this, I can add an expires_at timestamp column in the database and check it during redirection.\n\nIf the current time is after the expiration time, return a 410 Gone or a custom message.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll omit this feature for now.\n\nSimilarly, I can think about statistics and analytics, such as tracking the number of hits per URL, referrers, user agents, etc.\n\nBut again, that's beyond the scope of the basic URL shortener service.\n\nNow, let's consider how to run the service.\n\nI can compile the Go code into an executable and run it locally.\n\ngo build -o url-shortener main.go\n\nThen, ./url-shortener\n\nAlternatively, I can run it using Go's built-in tooling:\n\ngo run main.go\n\nI need to make sure that Cassandra is running and accessible at the specified contact points.\n\nI should also consider environment variables for configuration, such as the Cassandra contact points, keyspace, and the base URL.\n\nThis way, I can easily switch between development and production environments.\n\nFor example, I can use the os package to read environment variables.\n\nbaseURL := os.Getenv(\"BASE_URL\")\n\ncassandraContactPoints := os.Getenv(\"CASSANDRA_CONTACT_POINTS\")\n\ncassandraKeyspace := os.Getenv(\"CASSANDRA_KEYSPACE\")\n\nThen, in the code, use these variables accordingly.\n\nProvide default values for development.\n\nNow, let's think about testing.\n\nI need to write unit tests for the functions, such as generateShortCode, checkShortCodeExists, insertMapping, getLongURL, etc.\n\nI can use Go's testing package to write the tests.\n\nAlso, I need to write integration tests to test the HTTP endpoints.\n\nI can use the net/http/httptest package to create test servers and simulate HTTP requests.\n\nFor example, to test the POST /shorten endpoint, I can send a JSON payload with a long URL and verify that I get a shortened URL in response.\n\nThen, use the GET /{short_code} endpoint to verify that it redirects to the original URL.\n\nI should also test error cases, such as submitting an invalid URL, submitting a URL that's already shortened, and accessing a non-existent short code.\n\nIn addition, I need to ensure that the short codes are unique and that there are no duplicates in the database.\n\nTo handle this, I can implement a retry mechanism in the shortenHandler, where if a short code already exists, generate a new one up to a certain number of attempts.\n\nIf all attempts fail, return an error.\n\nFor example:\n\nfor attempts := 0; attempts < 5; attempts++ {\n\n    shortCode := generateShortCode(6)\n\n    exists, err := checkShortCodeExists(session, shortCode)\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        http.Error(w, \"Database error\", http.StatusInternalServerError)\n\n        return\n\n    }\n\n    if !exists {\n\n        // Use this shortCode\n\n        break\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nIf after 5 attempts, no unique short code is found, return an error.\n\nThis reduces the likelihood of collisions.\n\nNow, let's consider security aspects.\n\nSince users can submit any URL, including malicious ones, I need to ensure that the service doesn't become a vector for phishing or other attacks.\n\nOne way to mitigate this is to display a warning message to users when they click on a shortened URL, informing them that they're about to leave the service and visit an external site.\n\nBut implementing such a warning is beyond the scope of this project.\n\nAnother consideration is rate limiting to prevent abuse, such as excessive URL submissions or redirect requests.\n\nI can implement rate limiting using middleware in the HTTP server.\n\nFor example, using the go-chi/chi package, which has built-in rate limiting middleware.\n\nBut for now, I'll omit this feature.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that the service is resistant to SQL injection or other types of attacks.\n\nHowever, since Cassandra uses parameterized queries, I'm protected against SQL injection.\n\nStill, I need to validate and sanitize user inputs where necessary.\n\nIn this case, the only user input is the URL, which I'm already validating using url.ParseRequestURI.\n\nNow, let's consider deployment.\n\nI can containerize the service using Docker, creating a Dockerfile that installs Go, builds the binary, and runs it.\n\nThen, I can push the Docker image to a container registry like Docker Hub or Google Container Registry.\n\nFinally, deploy the container to a cloud provider's container service, such as AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).\n\nBut for now, I'll focus on getting the service working locally.\n\nIn summary, I've outlined the steps to build a URL shortener service in Golang, using Cassandra as the backend database.\n\nI've considered various aspects, such as URL generation, database operations, HTTP endpoints, error handling, and testing.\n\nWith this plan in place, I can proceed to implement the code and test the service.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo build a URL shortener service in Golang that stores mappings in a Cassandra database, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. **Golang** installed on your machine.\n2. **Cassandra** installed and running.\n3. **Gocql** package installed via `go get github.com/gocql/gocql`.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"database/sql\"\n    \"encoding/json\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"math/rand\"\n    \"net/http\"\n    \"net/url\"\n    \"time\"\n\n    \"github.com/gocql/gocql\"\n    \"github.com/gorilla/mux\"\n)\n\nconst (\n    baseURL          = \"http://localhost:8080\"\n    shortCodeLength  = 6\n    maxRetryAttempts = 5\n)\n\ntype ShortenRequest struct {\n    URL string `json:\"url\"`\n}\n\ntype ShortenResponse struct {\n    ShortURL string `json:\"short_url\"`\n}\n\nvar session *gocql.Session\n\nfunc main() {\n    cluster := gocql.NewCluster(\"127.0.0.1\")\n    cluster.Keyspace = \"urlshortener\"\n    var err error\n    session, err = cluster.CreateSession()\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(err)\n        return\n    }\n    defer session.Close()\n\n    router := mux.NewRouter()\n    router.HandleFunc(\"/shorten\", shortenHandler).Methods(\"POST\")\n    router.HandleFunc(\"/({short_code})\", redirectHandler).Methods(\"GET\")\n\n    fmt.Println(\"Server running on port 8080\")\n    http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", router)\n}\n\nfunc shortenHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    decoder := json.NewDecoder(r.Body)\n    var req ShortenRequest\n    err := decoder.Decode(&req)\n    if err != nil {\n        http.Error(w, \"Bad request\", http.StatusBadRequest)\n        return\n    }\n\n    u, err := url.ParseRequestURI(req.URL)\n    if err != nil || u.Scheme == \"\" {\n        http.Error(w, \"Invalid URL\", http.StatusBadRequest)\n        return\n    }\n\n    var shortCode string\n    for attempts := 0;
