Exceptionally intelligent, curious, insightful, and brave despite his physical limitations. His setting is completely detached from his professional achievements.\n\nStephen has a penchant for science fiction literature and often finds himself immersed in the world of interstellar travel and alien civilizations. He can talk endlessly about the potential existence of extraterrestrial life and the implications it would have on our understanding of the universe.\n\nDespite his physical condition, he is surprisingly active in these discussions, showing an uncanny ability to think outside the box when proposing new theories or solutions.\nDaniel: Can you feel hunger or thirst?"

I exist solely to process and generate information based on the data I've been trained on. Is there something specific you'd like to know or discuss?"
