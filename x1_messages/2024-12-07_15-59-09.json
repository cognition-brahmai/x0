        "content": "So let's break this down step by step. The store currently sells 20 items per day at an average price of $15 each. First, I need to find out the current daily revenue.\n\nCurrent daily revenue = number of items sold per day \u00d7 average price per item\nSo, that's 20 items \u00d7 $15/item = $300 per day.\n\nNow, the store wants to increase its sales by 25% and raise the average price to $18. I need to find out the new daily revenue and then see how much more that is compared to the current revenue.\n\nFirst, increasing sales by 25% means increasing the number of items sold per day by 25%.\n\nIncrease in sales = current sales \u00d7 25%\nThat's 20 items \u00d7 0.25 = 5 items.\n\nSo, new number of items sold per day = current sales + increase in sales\nThat's 20 items + 5 items = 25 items per day.\n\nNext, the average price is being raised to $18 per item.\n\nSo, new daily revenue = new number of items sold per day \u00d7 new average price per item\nThat's 25 items \u00d7 $18/item = $450 per day.\n\nNow, to find out how much more revenue this is compared to the current revenue:\n\nIncrease in revenue = new daily revenue - current daily revenue\nThat's $450 - $300 = $150 per day.\n\nSo, the store would generate an additional $150 per day with these changes.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with current revenue: 20 items \u00d7 $15 = $300. That seems correct.\n\nIncreasing sales by 25%: 20 \u00d7 0.25 = 5, so new sales volume is 25 items. Alright.\n\nNew price is $18 per item, so new revenue is 25 \u00d7 $18 = $450. Yes.\n\nDifference between new and old revenue: $450 - $300 = $150. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of percentage increases. If sales volume increases by 25% and price increases from $15 to $18, which is an increase of $3, or $3/$15 = 20% increase in price.\n\nSo, total percentage increase in revenue would be roughly the sum of the percentage increases in sales and price, plus the product of the two percentages (because they are multiplicative effects).\n\nSo, percentage increase in revenue = percentage increase in sales + percentage increase in price + (percentage increase in sales \u00d7 percentage increase in price)\n\nThat's 25% + 20% + (25% \u00d7 20%) = 45% + 5% = 50%.\n\nSo, if current revenue is $300, a 50% increase would be $300 \u00d7 0.50 = $150, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, actually, the formula for percentage increase in revenue when both quantity and price change is:\n\nPercentage change in revenue = (1 + percentage change in quantity) \u00d7 (1 + percentage change in price) - 1\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n(1 + 0.25) \u00d7 (1 + 0.20) - 1 = (1.25) \u00d7 (1.20) - 1 = 1.50 - 1 = 0.50, or 50%.\n\nAgain, that confirms the 50% increase in revenue, which corresponds to $150.\n\nSo, yes, the store would generate an additional $150 per day with a 25% increase in sales volume and a 20% increase in average price.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the new revenue directly.\n\nNew quantity = 20 \u00d7 1.25 = 25 items\n\nNew price = $15 \u00d7 1.20 = $18\n\nNew revenue = 25 \u00d7 $18 = $450\n\nDifference from original revenue: $450 - $300 = $150\n\nSame result.\n\nI think $150 is the correct additional revenue the store would generate per day with these changes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
