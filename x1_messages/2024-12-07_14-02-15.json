        "content": "So the factory produces 500 units of product every day, and each unit sells for $30. We need to find out how much revenue the factory generates in one week, which is 7 days. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what revenue means. Revenue is the total amount of money earned from selling products or services. In this case, it's the money earned from selling the units the factory produces.\n\nSo, the factory produces 500 units per day, and each unit sells for $30. To find out the daily revenue, I should multiply the number of units produced per day by the selling price per unit. That is:\n\nDaily Revenue = Number of units per day \u00d7 Selling price per unit\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nDaily Revenue = 500 units/day \u00d7 $30/unit\n\nWhen I multiply that, I get:\n\nDaily Revenue = $15,000/day\n\nAlright, so the factory makes $15,000 each day from selling its products.\n\nNow, to find out the weekly revenue, I need to calculate the total revenue over 7 days. Since we've already found the daily revenue, I can simply multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in a week.\n\nWeekly Revenue = Daily Revenue \u00d7 Number of days in a week\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nWeekly Revenue = $15,000/day \u00d7 7 days\n\nMultiplying that gives:\n\nWeekly Revenue = $105,000\n\nSo, the factory generates $105,000 in revenue in one week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the beginning:\n\n- Units per day: 500\n\n- Selling price per unit: $30\n\n- Days in a week: 7\n\nFirst, multiply units per day by selling price per unit to get daily revenue:\n\n500 units/day \u00d7 $30/unit = $15,000/day\n\nThen, multiply daily revenue by the number of days in a week to get weekly revenue:\n\n$15,000/day \u00d7 7 days = $105,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to first find out the total number of units produced in a week and then multiply that by the selling price per unit.\n\nTotal units per week = Units per day \u00d7 Number of days in a week\n\nTotal units per week = 500 units/day \u00d7 7 days = 3,500 units\n\nThen, Weekly Revenue = Total units per week \u00d7 Selling price per unit\n\nWeekly Revenue = 3,500 units \u00d7 $30/unit = $105,000\n\nSame answer as before, which is a good sign.\n\nI can also consider if there are any other factors that might affect revenue, like production costs or taxes, but the question only asks about revenue from selling the units, so I don't need to consider those additional factors here.\n\nIt's also important to make sure that the units are consistent. In this case, units are in \"per day,\" and the selling price is per unit, so multiplying them directly makes sense.\n\nAdditionally, I should confirm that the factory operates every day of the week. The question says \"per day,\" and it's asking for a week's revenue, so it's reasonable to assume that the factory operates seven days a week. If there were days off, I would need to adjust the calculation accordingly, but based on the information provided, I'll assume it's seven days.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the factory generates $105,000 in revenue in one week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{105000} \\]"
