        "content": "So there are 12 black socks and 8 white socks in a drawer, making a total of 20 socks. I need to find the probability of picking two socks that match, meaning both are black or both are white.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the total number of ways to pick two socks out of 20. That sounds like a combination problem, where order doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 socks out of 20 is C(20, 2). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(20, 2) = 20! / (2!(20 - 2)!) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 18!) = (20 \u00d7 19) / 2 = 190.\n\nSo, there are 190 possible pairs of socks.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of ways to get a matching pair, which means both socks are black or both are white.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of ways to pick two black socks. There are 12 black socks, so the number of ways to choose 2 black socks is C(12, 2).\n\nC(12, 2) = 12! / (2!(12 - 2)!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 10!)) = (12 \u00d7 11) / 2 = 66.\n\nSo, there are 66 ways to pick two black socks.\n\nNext, the number of ways to pick two white socks. There are 8 white socks, so C(8, 2).\n\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8 - 2)!) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 6!)) = (8 \u00d7 7) / 2 = 28.\n\nSo, there are 28 ways to pick two white socks.\n\nNow, the total number of ways to pick a matching pair is the sum of the ways to pick two black socks and the ways to pick two white socks.\n\nTotal matching pairs = 66 + 28 = 94.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a matching pair is the number of matching pairs divided by the total number of possible pairs.\n\nProbability = 94 / 190.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2.\n\n94 \u00f7 2 = 47\n\n190 \u00f7 2 = 95\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 47/95.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert that to a decimal to see it better.\n\n47 divided by 95 is approximately 0.4947.\n\nSo, the probability is about 0.4947, or 49.47%.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using probabilities directly without combinations.\n\nLet's see: the probability of picking two black socks would be (12/20) for the first sock and (11/19) for the second sock, since one black sock has already been picked.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking two white socks would be (8/20) for the first sock and (7/19) for the second sock.\n\nSo, the total probability of getting a matching pair would be the sum of these two probabilities.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nProbability of two black socks: (12/20) * (11/19) = (12 \u00d7 11) / (20 \u00d7 19) = 132 / 380.\n\nProbability of two white socks: (8/20) * (7/19) = (8 \u00d7 7) / (20 \u00d7 19) = 56 / 380.\n\nTotal probability: 132/380 + 56/380 = 188 / 380.\n\nSimplifying that fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 4.\n\n188 \u00f7 4 = 47\n\n380 \u00f7 4 = 95\n\nSo, again, 47/95, which matches what I got earlier with combinations.\n\nThat's reassuring. So, the probability is 47/95, or about 49.47%.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem to confirm?\n\nMaybe by calculating the probability of not getting a matching pair and then subtracting that from 1.\n\nThe probability of not getting a matching pair means picking one black and one white sock.\n\nSo, the probability of picking one black and one white sock.\n\nFirst sock: could be black or white.\n\nIf first sock is black (12/20), then second sock must be white (8/19).\n\nAlternatively, first sock is white (8/20), then second sock must be black (12/19).\n\nSo, total probability of not matching = (12/20)(8/19) + (8/20)(12/19).\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n(12/20)(8/19) = 96 / 380\n\n(8/20)(12/19) = 96 / 380\n\nTotal: 96/380 + 96/380 = 192/380 = 48/95.\n\nNow, probability of matching pair is 1 minus probability of not matching.\n\nSo, 1 - 48/95 = (95 - 48)/95 = 47/95.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nThis gives me more confidence that 47/95 is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about it in terms of combinations again.\n\nTotal ways to pick two socks: C(20, 2) = 190.\n\nNumber of matching pairs: 66 black + 28 white = 94.\n\nProbability: 94/190 = 47/95.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The probability of picking a matching pair of socks is 47/95.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{47}{95}} \\]"
