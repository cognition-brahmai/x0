        "content": "Yes, it is true that humans have a dominant brain hemisphere. This concept is known as lateralization of brain function. Generally, one hemisphere is more dominant for certain functions than the other. For example, in most people, the left hemisphere is dominant for language processing, while the right hemisphere is more involved in spatial abilities and facial recognition. This doesn't mean that one hemisphere is \"better\" than the other; both are essential for overall cognitive functioning."
