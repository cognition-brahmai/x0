        "content": "Alright, so the user wants to identify the author of the book 'War and Peace' and list three other books written by the same author. I've got some tools to help me with this: BookInfo, AuthorWorks, ListFormatter, and QA.\n\nFirst, I need to find out who wrote 'War and Peace'. The BookInfo tool seems perfect for this because it provides information about a particular book, including the author's name. So, I'll use BookInfo with 'War and Peace' as the input.\n\nOnce I have the author's name from BookInfo, I can use the AuthorWorks tool to list other books written by the same author. Since the user wants three other books, I'll need to format the list appropriately. That's where the ListFormatter tool comes in\u2014it can take a list and make it into a readable sentence.\n\nIf, for some reason, I don't get the information I need from these tools, I can always fall back on the QA tool, which has general world knowledge and might know the author and their other works directly.\n\nSo, here's how I'll proceed:\n\n1. Use BookInfo['War and Peace'] to find the author's name.\n\n2. Once I have the author's name, use AuthorWorks[author's name] to get a list of other books by the same author.\n\n3. From that list, select three books and use ListFormatter to present them in a sentence.\n\n4. If any step fails, use QA to fill in the gaps.\n\nLet's start with the first step.\n\n#E1 = BookInfo['War and Peace']\n\nNow, based on #E1, I should have the author's name. Let's assume it returns \"Leo Tolstoy\" as the author.\n\nNext, I'll use AuthorWorks['Leo Tolstoy'] to get a list of his works.\n\n#E2 = AuthorWorks['Leo Tolstoy']\n\nSuppose #E2 returns a list like [\"Anna Karenina\", \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\", \"Resurrection\", \"Hadji Murat\", etc.]\n\nI need to list three other books besides 'War and Peace', so I'll pick the first three from the list: \"Anna Karenina\", \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\", and \"Resurrection\".\n\nThen, I'll use ListFormatter to make this list readable.\n\n#E3 = ListFormatter[\"Anna Karenina\", \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\", \"Resurrection\"]\n\nAssuming #E3 outputs \"Anna Karenina, The Death of Ivan Ilyich, and Resurrection.\"\n\nFinally, I can present the author's name and the list of three other books.\n\nFinal Answer: The author of 'War and Peace' is Leo Tolstoy, and three other books he wrote are Anna Karenina, The Death of Ivan Ilyich, and Resurrection.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo identify the author of 'War and Peace' and list three other books by the same author, follow these steps:\n\n1. Use the `BookInfo` tool with 'War and Peace' as input to find the author's name.\n2. Use the `AuthorWorks` tool with the author's name to get a list of other books by the same author.\n3. Select three books from the list obtained in step 2.\n4. Use the `ListFormatter` tool to format these three book titles into a readable sentence.\n5. Combine the author's name and the formatted list of three books in the final answer.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Find the author of 'War and Peace'**:\n   - Use `BookInfo['War and Peace']` to retrieve the author's name.\n\n2. **List other books by the same author**:\n   - Use `AuthorWorks[author's name]` to get a list of books by the identified author.\n   - Select three books from this list.\n\n3. **Format the list of books**:\n   - Use `ListFormatter` to create a readable sentence from the selected book titles.\n\n4. **Provide the final answer**:\n   - Combine the author's name and the formatted list of books in the final response.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```plaintext\n#E1 = BookInfo['War and Peace']\n# Assuming #E1 returns \"Leo Tolstoy\" as the author.\n\n#E2 = AuthorWorks['Leo Tolstoy']\n# Assuming #E2 returns [\"Anna Karenina\", \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\", \"Resurrection\", \"Hadji Murat\", etc.]\n\n# Select the first three books from the list\nselected_books = [\"Anna Karenina\", \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\", \"Resurrection\"]\n\n#E3 = ListFormatter[selected_books]\n# Assuming #E3 outputs \"Anna Karenina, The Death of Ivan Ilyich, and Resurrection.\"\n\nFinal Answer: The author of 'War and Peace' is Leo Tolstoy, and three other books he wrote are Anna Karenina, The Death of Ivan Ilyich, and Resurrection.\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Step 1**: Identify the author using `BookInfo['War and Peace']`.\n2. **Step 2**: Retrieve a list of works by the author using `AuthorWorks['Leo Tolstoy']`.\n3. **Step 3**: Select three books from the list: \"Anna Karenina\", \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\", and \"Resurrection\".\n4. **Step 4**: Format these book titles into a readable sentence using `ListFormatter`.\n5. **Step 5**: Present the final answer combining the author's name and the formatted list of books."
