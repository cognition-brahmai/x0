        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that in this school, 60% of the students are boys and 40% are girls. That means for every 100 students, 60 are boys and 40 are girls. Also, it's given that there are 240 more boys than girls. I need to find out the total number of students in the school.\n\nFirst, let's think about the percentages. If 60% are boys and 40% are girls, the difference between the percentage of boys and girls is 60% - 40% = 20%. This 20% difference corresponds to the 240 more boys than girls.\n\nSo, 20% of the total number of students is equal to 240. Let's denote the total number of students as T. Then, 20% of T is 240, which can be written as:\n\n0.20 * T = 240\n\nNow, to find T, I can divide both sides of the equation by 0.20:\n\nT = 240 / 0.20\n\nT = 1200\n\nSo, the total number of students is 1200.\n\nBut let me double-check this to make sure I'm correct. If there are 1200 students in total, then the number of boys is 60% of 1200, which is 0.60 * 1200 = 720 boys. The number of girls is 40% of 1200, which is 0.40 * 1200 = 480 girls. The difference between boys and girls is 720 - 480 = 240, which matches the given information.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of variables. Let\u2019s say the total number of students is T. Then, the number of boys is 0.60T and the number of girls is 0.40T. According to the problem, the difference between boys and girls is 240:\n\n0.60T - 0.40T = 240\n\n0.20T = 240\n\nT = 240 / 0.20\n\nT = 1200\n\nAgain, I get the same answer.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the ratio of boys to girls. Since boys are 60% and girls are 40%, the ratio of boys to girls is 60:40, which simplifies to 3:2. This means for every 3 boys, there are 2 girls. The difference in the number of boys and girls is 1 part (3 - 2 = 1), and this difference is given as 240 students. So, 1 part corresponds to 240 students.\n\nIf 1 part is 240, then the total number of parts is 3 + 2 = 5 parts. Therefore, the total number of students is 5 parts times 240 students per part:\n\nT = 5 * 240 = 1200\n\nOnce again, I arrive at the same answer: 1200 students in total.\n\nTo be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to approach this problem. Perhaps using algebra?\n\nLet G represent the number of girls. Then, the number of boys is G + 240, since there are 240 more boys than girls.\n\nThe total number of students is G (girls) + (G + 240) (boys) = 2G + 240.\n\nNow, according to the percentages, boys are 60% of the total students, and girls are 40%. So:\n\nNumber of boys = 0.60 * (total students) \u2192 G + 240 = 0.60 * (2G + 240)\n\nNumber of girls = 0.40 * (total students) \u2192 G = 0.40 * (2G + 240)\n\nLet's use the first equation:\n\nG + 240 = 0.60 * (2G + 240)\n\nNow, distribute the 0.60 on the right side:\n\nG + 240 = 0.60 * 2G + 0.60 * 240\n\nG + 240 = 1.2G + 144\n\nNow, let's move all terms involving G to one side and constants to the other side:\n\nG - 1.2G = 144 - 240\n\n-0.2G = -96\n\nNow, divide both sides by -0.2:\n\nG = -96 / -0.2\n\nG = 480\n\nSo, there are 480 girls. Then, the number of boys is 480 + 240 = 720. Therefore, the total number of students is 480 + 720 = 1200.\n\nThis matches all the previous methods I used. So, I'm confident that the total number of students is 1200.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's verify the percentages with this total.\n\nBoys: 720 out of 1200 is (720/1200)*100% = 60%, which matches the given percentage.\n\nGirls: 480 out of 1200 is (480/1200)*100% = 40%, which also matches.\n\nAnd the difference is indeed 240 students.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The total number of students in the school is 1200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1200} \\]"
