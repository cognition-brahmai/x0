        "content": "Let's see. The company has a budget of $10,000 for employee bonuses and there are 25 employees. They want to give each employee an equal bonus. So, to find out how much each employee will receive, I need to divide the total bonus budget by the number of employees.\n\nSo, that would be $10,000 divided by 25. Let me do the math:\n\n$10,000 \u00f7 25 = $400.\n\nSo, each employee would receive a $400 bonus.\n\nNow, if the company decides to hire 5 more employees, the total number of employees would increase to 25 + 5 = 30 employees.\n\nWith the same bonus budget of $10,000, I need to divide it among 30 employees.\n\nSo, $10,000 \u00f7 30.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n$10,000 \u00f7 30 is approximately $333.33.\n\nSo, each employee would then receive approximately $333.33.\n\nWait a minute, I should check if that's exact.\n\nLet me do the division properly.\n\n10,000 divided by 30.\n\n30 times 333 is 9,990.\n\nSo, 10,000 - 9,990 = 10.\n\nSo, each employee gets $333.333..., but since we're dealing with money, it's usually rounded to two decimal places.\n\nSo, each employee would get $333.33.\n\nBut, if you multiply 30 times $333.33, you get $9,999.90.\n\nSo, there's a $0.10 discrepancy.\n\nIn practice, the company would need to decide how to handle that penny.\n\nThey could either give some employees an extra penny or adjust the budget slightly.\n\nBut for our purposes, we can say each employee gets $333.33.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- With 25 employees: $400 each.\n\n- With 30 employees: approximately $333.33 each.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400 \\text{ dollars each for 25 employees, and approximately } 333.33 \\text{ dollars each for 30 employees}} \\]"
