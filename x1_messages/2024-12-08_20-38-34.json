        "content": "Let's see. There's a car going at 60 miles per hour and a cyclist going at 15 miles per hour in the same direction. I need to find out how long it will take for the car to be 45 miles ahead of the cyclist.\n\nFirst, I should think about their speeds. Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed between the car and the cyclist is the difference in their speeds. So, that would be 60 mph minus 15 mph, which is 45 mph.\n\nNow, the car is moving 45 miles per hour faster than the cyclist. I need to find out how long it takes for the car to get 45 miles ahead.\n\nI remember that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, time equals distance divided by relative speed.\n\nIn this case, the distance is 45 miles, and the relative speed is 45 mph.\n\nSo, time equals 45 miles divided by 45 mph, which is 1 hour.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there anything I'm missing?\n\nLet me double-check. If the car is going 60 mph and the cyclist 15 mph, the car is gaining on the cyclist at a rate of 45 mph. So, to gain 45 miles, it would take 1 hour.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of equations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote time as t hours.\n\nIn t hours, the car travels 60t miles.\n\nIn the same t hours, the cyclist travels 15t miles.\n\nThe difference in their positions after t hours is 60t - 15t = 45t miles.\n\nI want this difference to be 45 miles.\n\nSo, 45t = 45.\n\nSolving for t, t = 1 hour.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nMaybe I can consider it another way to confirm.\n\nSuppose I consider the positions of both the car and the cyclist as functions of time.\n\nLet\u2019s say at time t=0, both are at the same position, where the car passes the cyclist.\n\nThen, at any time t, the car has traveled 60t miles, and the cyclist has traveled 15t miles.\n\nThe car is ahead by 60t - 15t = 45t miles.\n\nI need 45t = 45, so t=1 hour.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same answer.\n\nI think it's clear that it will take 1 hour for the car to be 45 miles ahead of the cyclist.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 \\text{ hour}} \\]"
