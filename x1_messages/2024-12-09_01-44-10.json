        "content": "If a child hugs a teddy bear, it's likely that the child is seeking comfort, security, or companionship. Teddy bears are often used as transitional objects for children, helping them feel safe and calm, especially during times of stress or separation from their caregivers. The physical act of hugging can release oxytocin, a hormone associated with bonding and affection, which may contribute to the child feeling more relaxed and content. Additionally, the tactile sensation of holding or hugging a soft toy can be soothing and may help the child develop fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination."
