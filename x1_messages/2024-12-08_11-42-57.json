I'm writing to you with lots of feelings in my heart.\n\nIt's been ten years since you went away, but everything here reminds me of you. The stone roads remember our laughs, the grape fields remember our dreams, and the big tree still has our names in it.\n\nMarco, living without you is like a song that's not finished - it's nice, but something's missing. I missed you every morning and every night. But I kept hoping and loving, like someone lost at sea holding onto a floaty thing in a big storm.\n\nHearing that you're coming back made me so happy, like a big wave washing all the sadness away. I can't wait to see you again, to look into your eyes that used to promise me everything.\n\nI want you to know, Marco, that I still love you. My love is like a lighthouse showing the way home to lost boats, or like the North Star. It's even stronger now, because I've missed you and time has made it grow.\n\nAs I write this, I think of a line from a poem by Dante, \"Love, that moves the sun and other stars.\" Our love, Marco, is like that - strong, lasting, never-ending.\n\nPlease remember, no matter where you go, you'll always have a part of my heart. And our little town, with its pretty sunsets and grape fields, will always be happy to see you.\n\nUntil we see each other again, I am,\n\nAlways yours,\nIsabella"

I am sitting here, pen in hand, with a heart full of emotions, ready to pour out my thoughts to you.\n\nIt's been a decade since you left, yet every corner of this place seems to echo with your presence. The cobblestone streets still resonate with the laughter we shared, the vineyards whisper our dreams, and the old oak tree stands tall, bearing the initials we carved into its bark all those years ago.\n\nLiving without you feels like a melody that's incomplete\u2014beautiful, yet lacking its most essential note. Each dawn and dusk, I find myself missing you profoundly. It's as if I'm adrift in a vast ocean, clutching onto a buoy in the midst of a storm, hoping against hope that I'll find my way back to shore.\n\nThe news of your return has brought an overwhelming sense of joy, washing away the layers of sadness that have accumulated over the years. I can hardly wait to see you again, to look into those eyes that once held so many promises.\n\nI need you to know, Marco, that my love for you has never wavered. It's like a lighthouse, guiding lost ships to safety, or the North Star, constant and unwavering. If anything, time has only made it stronger, nurturing it through the years of separation.\n\nAs I pen these words, a verse from Dante comes to mind: \"Love, which moves the sun and the other stars.\" Our love, Marco, is akin to that\u2014powerful, enduring, and infinite.\n\nPlease remember, no matter where life takes you, a piece of my heart will always belong to you. And our little town, with its breathtaking sunsets and vibrant vineyards, eagerly awaits your return.\n\nUntil we meet again, I remain,\n\nAlways yours,\nIsabella"
