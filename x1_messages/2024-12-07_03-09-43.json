        "content": "So the water tank can hold 200 liters when it's full. Right now, it's filled to 80% of its capacity. I need to find out how many more liters are needed to fill it completely.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much water is currently in the tank. Since it's 80% full, I can calculate 80% of 200 liters.\n\nTo find 80% of 200, I can multiply 200 by 0.80.\n\n200 liters * 0.80 = 160 liters.\n\nSo, the tank currently has 160 liters of water.\n\nNow, to find out how many more liters are needed to fill it completely, I need to subtract the current amount from the full capacity.\n\n200 liters (full capacity) - 160 liters (current amount) = 40 liters.\n\nTherefore, 40 more liters are needed to fill the tank completely.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe by calculating the percentage that's still needed.\n\nIf the tank is 80% full, then it's 100% - 80% = 20% empty.\n\nSo, 20% of 200 liters is the amount needed to fill it up.\n\nLet me calculate that to verify.\n\n20% of 200 liters is 0.20 * 200 = 40 liters.\n\nYeah, same answer as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation.\n\nLet x be the amount needed to fill the tank.\n\nThen, current amount + x = full capacity.\n\nSo, 160 + x = 200.\n\nSolving for x: x = 200 - 160 = 40 liters.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIt seems like 40 liters is the correct amount needed to fill the tank completely.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nIs there any leakage or evaporation that might affect the amount needed? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I can assume that the tank is perfect and there are no losses.\n\nAlso, the tank's capacity is given in liters, and the problem is straightforward, so no need to convert units or anything.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 40 liters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
