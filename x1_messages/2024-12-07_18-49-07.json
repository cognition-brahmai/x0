        "content": "So the question is: A father has five sons. Each son has two children, one boy and one girl. How many grandchildren does the father have?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The father has five sons. Each of these sons has two children: one boy and one girl. So, for each son, there are two grandchildren for the father.\n\nSo, if there are five sons, and each has two grandchildren for the father, then total grandchildren should be 5 sons times 2 grandchildren per son, which is 10 grandchildren.\n\nWait a minute, but let's think about this carefully. Each son has one boy and one girl. So, for each son, that's indeed two grandchildren. And since there are five sons, it should be 5 times 2, which is 10.\n\nBut maybe there's a trick here. Is there any possibility that some of these grandchildren are shared between sons or something? No, each son has their own two children.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to impose some familial restrictions, like intermarriage or something, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. The question is straightforward: each son has two children, one boy and one girl.\n\nSo, again, five sons, each with two grandchildren for the father, totals to 10 grandchildren.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion could arise if someone miscounts the number of sons or misreads the number of children each son has. But as presented, it's clear: five sons, each with two children.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the entire family tree. The father has five sons. Each of these sons has one boy and one girl, so that's two grandchildren each.\n\nSo, total grandchildren are 5 \u00d7 2 = 10.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of gender, there are five sons, each with one boy and one girl. So, overall, there are five boys and five girls among the grandchildren, totaling 10 grandchildren.\n\nIs there any other angle to this that I might be missing? Perhaps considering half-siblings or stepchildren, but the question doesn't mention anything like that. It's just about five sons, each having two children, one boy and one girl.\n\nSo, I think the answer is straightforward: the father has 10 grandchildren.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
