        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got an online retailer that's got four warehouses right now, each handling 10,000 orders per day. They're expecting their order volume to grow by 15% each year for the next five years. We need to figure out how many more warehouses they'll need to build to keep up with this growth, and each new warehouse can handle 12,000 orders per day. Also, we're supposed to estimate the total cost if each new warehouse costs $5 million to build.\n\nFirst things first, let's find out what the current order processing capacity is. They have four warehouses, each doing 10,000 orders per day. So, total current capacity is:\n\n4 warehouses * 10,000 orders/warehouse/day = 40,000 orders per day.\n\nNow, orders are expected to grow by 15% each year for five years. To find out the order volume in five years, we can use the formula for compound growth:\n\nFuture orders = Current orders * (1 + growth rate)^number of periods.\n\nBut wait, the current orders are 40,000 per day, but this is the processing capacity, not the current order volume. Actually, the problem says they \"expect order volume to grow by 15% annually over the next five years.\" It doesn't specify what the current order volume is, but it mentions that their current warehouses can process 10,000 orders per day each, totaling 40,000 per day.\n\nI think it's safe to assume that the current order volume is what their current warehouses can handle, which is 40,000 orders per day. So, the expected order volume in five years would be:\n\nFuture orders = 40,000 * (1 + 0.15)^5.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, calculate 1 + 0.15 = 1.15.\n\nThen, 1.15^5.\n\nLet's see, 1.15^2 = 1.3225.\n\n1.15^3 = 1.3225 * 1.15 \u2248 1.520875.\n\n1.15^4 \u2248 1.520875 * 1.15 \u2248 1.74900625.\n\n1.15^5 \u2248 1.74900625 * 1.15 \u2248 2.0113571875.\n\nSo, future orders \u2248 40,000 * 2.0113571875 \u2248 80,454.29 orders per day.\n\nAlright, so in five years, they're expecting to handle about 80,454 orders per day.\n\nNow, their current capacity is 40,000 orders per day. So, the additional capacity needed is:\n\n80,454 - 40,000 = 40,454 orders per day.\n\nEach new warehouse can handle 12,000 orders per day. So, to find out how many new warehouses are needed, we can divide the additional orders by the capacity of one new warehouse:\n\n40,454 / 12,000 \u2248 3.371.\n\nSince they can't build a fraction of a warehouse, they'll need to build 4 new warehouses to meet the demand.\n\nNow, each new warehouse costs $5 million to build. So, the total cost would be:\n\n4 warehouses * $5,000,000/warehouse = $20,000,000.\n\nWait a minute, but actually, since 3 warehouses would provide 3 * 12,000 = 36,000 orders per day, which is less than the needed 40,454, they would still fall short by 4,454 orders per day. So, they need to build a fourth warehouse to cover the additional demand.\n\nAlternatively, they could try to find other solutions for the excess capacity, but based on the problem, it seems they want to ensure they can handle the entire demand with their own warehouses.\n\nTherefore, they need to build 4 new warehouses, costing a total of $20 million.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with current capacity: 4 warehouses * 10,000 = 40,000 orders per day.\n\nGrowth rate: 15% per year for 5 years.\n\nFuture orders: 40,000 * (1.15)^5.\n\nI calculated (1.15)^5 \u2248 2.011, so 40,000 * 2.011 = 80,440 orders per day (rounded).\n\nAdditional capacity needed: 80,440 - 40,000 = 40,440 orders per day.\n\nEach new warehouse: 12,000 orders per day.\n\nNumber of new warehouses: 40,440 / 12,000 = 3.37, so need to round up to 4.\n\nTotal cost: 4 * $5,000,000 = $20,000,000.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if they build 3 warehouses, they add 36,000 orders per day, bringing total capacity to 40,000 + 36,000 = 76,000 orders per day, which is less than the expected 80,440. So, they'd still need another 4,440 orders per day covered, meaning they need a fourth warehouse.\n\nTherefore, the answer is they need to build 4 additional warehouses, at a total cost of $20 million.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ warehouses at a total cost of } \\$20,000,000} \\]"
