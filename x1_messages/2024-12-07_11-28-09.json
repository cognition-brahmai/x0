        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two trains moving towards each other from stations A and B, which are 300 miles apart.\n\nFirst, train A leaves station A at 9 AM, traveling at 60 miles per hour towards station B.\n\nThen, train B leaves station B at 10 AM, traveling at 40 miles per hour towards station A.\n\nWe need to find out when these two trains will meet.\n\nOkay, so let's think about this. Train A has a head start because it leaves an hour earlier than train B.\n\nFrom 9 AM to 10 AM, train A is traveling alone towards station B. In that one hour, how far does train A go?\n\nWell, speed is 60 miles per hour, so in one hour, it covers 60 miles.\n\nSo, by 10 AM, when train B starts, train A has already covered 60 miles, meaning the remaining distance between the two trains is 300 miles minus 60 miles, which is 240 miles.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other. Train A is going at 60 mph, and train B at 40 mph. So, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds, right? Because they're moving towards each other.\n\nSo, relative speed = 60 mph + 40 mph = 100 mph.\n\nNow, they have 240 miles between them at 10 AM, and they're closing that distance at 100 miles per hour.\n\nTo find the time it takes for them to meet, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, time = 240 miles / 100 mph = 2.4 hours.\n\nNow, 2.4 hours is 2 hours and 0.4 hours. Since 0.4 hours is 0.4 * 60 minutes = 24 minutes, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes.\n\nSince train B started at 10 AM, adding 2 hours and 24 minutes to that time will give us the meeting time.\n\n10:00 AM + 2 hours = 12:00 PM, and plus 24 minutes brings it to 12:24 PM.\n\nWait a minute, but train A started at 9 AM, so let's double-check if everything adds up correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this differently to confirm.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the time after 9 AM when the trains meet.\n\nLet\u2019s denote t as the time in hours after 9 AM when the two trains meet.\n\nSo, train A has been traveling for t hours, and train B has been traveling for (t - 1) hours, since it started at 10 AM, which is 1 hour after 9 AM.\n\nThe distance covered by train A is 60 * t miles.\n\nThe distance covered by train B is 40 * (t - 1) miles.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they cover should equal the initial distance between the stations, which is 300 miles.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n60t + 40(t - 1) = 300\n\nNow, let's solve for t.\n\nFirst, expand the equation:\n\n60t + 40t - 40 = 300\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n100t - 40 = 300\n\nAdd 40 to both sides:\n\n100t = 340\n\nDivide both sides by 100:\n\nt = 3.4 hours\n\nSo, t = 3 hours and 0.4 hours. Again, 0.4 hours is 24 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the meeting time is 9:00 AM + 3 hours and 24 minutes, which is 12:24 PM.\n\nWait, this matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check the distances each train has traveled by that time.\n\nTrain A: 3.4 hours * 60 mph = 204 miles\n\nTrain B: (3.4 - 1) hours * 40 mph = 2.4 hours * 40 mph = 96 miles\n\nTotal distance covered: 204 + 96 = 300 miles, which matches the initial distance.\n\nSo, yes, the two trains will meet at 12:24 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12:24 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
