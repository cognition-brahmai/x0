        "content": "Assuming that a single dollar bill has a thickness of about 0.11 millimeters, we can calculate the height of the stack by multiplying the number of bills by the thickness of each bill.\n\nFirst, let's convert the national debt to dollars:\n\n$28 trillion = 28,000,000,000,000 dollars\n\nNow, let's calculate the total thickness:\n\nTotal thickness = Number of bills \u00d7 Thickness per bill\n\nTotal thickness = 28,000,000,000,000 bills \u00d7 0.11 mm/bill\n\nTotal thickness = 3,080,000,000,000 mm\n\nTo convert millimeters to meters, we divide by 1,000,000 (since there are 1,000,000 millimeters in a meter):\n\nHeight in meters = 3,080,000,000,000 mm \u00f7 1,000,000 = 3,080,000 meters\n\nSo, the stack would be 3,080,000 meters high.\n\nFor context, that's approximately 1,914 miles or about 3.08 million meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3080000 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
