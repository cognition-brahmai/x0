        "content": "Using your phone while driving is not recommended because it can significantly increase the risk of accidents. When you're driving, your attention needs to be fully focused on the road and other vehicles around you. Using a phone, whether it's for talking, texting, or browsing, can divert your attention away from driving, making it harder to react to unexpected situations.\n\nMoreover, many countries have laws that prohibit the use of mobile phones while driving to ensure road safety. It's always best to prioritize safety and avoid using your phone while driving. If you need to make a call or send a message, pull over to a safe location first."
