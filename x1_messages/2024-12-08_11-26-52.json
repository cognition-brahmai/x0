        "content": "In Norse mythology, the mighty hammer wielded by Thor, the god of thunder, is called Mj\u00f6lnir. This iconic weapon is not only a symbol of Thor's power but also plays a crucial role in various mythological stories and rituals. Mj\u00f6lnir is known for its ability to level mountains and return to Thor's hand after being thrown. It's often depicted with a short handle, which is attributed to a mistake made during its creation by the dwarven smiths Brokkr and Eitri."
