        "content": "So there are 50 apples on a tree, and 20% of them fall off. I need to find out how many apples are left on the tree. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many apples fall off. If 20% of the apples fall off, I can calculate that by taking 20% of 50. To find 20% of 50, I can multiply 50 by 0.20.\n\nSo, 50 times 0.20 is 10. That means 10 apples fall off the tree.\n\nNow, to find out how many apples are left on the tree, I can subtract the number of apples that fell off from the total number of apples that were originally on the tree.\n\nSo, 50 minus 10 equals 40.\n\nTherefore, there are 40 apples remaining on the tree.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe instead of finding 20% and subtracting it, I can find out what 80% of the apples remain on the tree, since 100% minus 20% is 80%.\n\nSo, 80% of 50 should also give me the number of apples left on the tree.\n\nLet me calculate that. 80% of 50 is 50 times 0.80, which is 40.\n\nYeah, that matches my previous result. So, either way, it's 40 apples remaining on the tree.\n\nGood, I think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
