        "content": "So, the problem is that a baker uses 2 eggs to make 3 cupcakes, and we need to find out how many eggs he'll need to make 15 cupcakes. Hmm, this seems like a straightforward proportion problem, but I want to make sure I explain it clearly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between eggs and cupcakes. The baker uses 2 eggs for every 3 cupcakes. So, the ratio of eggs to cupcakes is 2:3. Now, I need to find out how many eggs are needed for 15 cupcakes.\n\nOne way to approach this is to set up a proportion. If 2 eggs are needed for 3 cupcakes, then x eggs are needed for 15 cupcakes. So, it's 2/3 = x/15. To find x, I can cross-multiply: 2 * 15 = 3 * x, which simplifies to 30 = 3x. Then, dividing both sides by 3, I get x = 10. So, the baker needs 10 eggs for 15 cupcakes.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If 2 eggs make 3 cupcakes, then how many eggs are needed for one cupcake? Well, 2 eggs divided by 3 cupcakes is 2/3 eggs per cupcake. So, for 15 cupcakes, I would multiply 2/3 eggs by 15, which is (2/3) * 15 = 30/3 = 10 eggs. Okay, that matches my first answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to scale up the original ratio. If 3 cupcakes require 2 eggs, then to make 15 cupcakes, which is 5 times more (since 15 divided by 3 is 5), I would need 5 times more eggs. So, 2 eggs multiplied by 5 equals 10 eggs. Again, the same answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor to consider, like perhaps the baker needs whole eggs and can't use fractions. But in this case, since 10 is a whole number, it's not an issue. If the answer came out to a fraction, I might need to consider how to handle it, but here it's straightforward.\n\nI can also verify this by thinking about smaller numbers. For example, if 3 cupcakes require 2 eggs, then 6 cupcakes would require 4 eggs, 9 cupcakes would require 6 eggs, and so on, up to 15 cupcakes requiring 10 eggs. It all makes sense.\n\nSo, the final answer is 10 eggs. I'm confident with this conclusion based on the different methods that all lead to the same result.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
