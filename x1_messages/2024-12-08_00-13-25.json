        "content": "Those terms\u2014scalene, isosceles, and equilateral\u2014come from geometry, which is a branch of mathematics concerned with the properties and relations of points, lines, surfaces, solids, and higher dimensional analogs. Specifically, these terms are used to describe different types of triangles based on the lengths of their sides.\n\n- **Equilateral Triangle:** All three sides are equal in length, and all three internal angles are also equal, each measuring 60 degrees.\n\n- **Isosceles Triangle:** At least two sides are equal in length, and the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal.\n\n- **Scalene Triangle:** All sides have different lengths, and all angles have different measures.\n\nGeometry is fundamental in many areas of mathematics and has applications in physics, engineering, architecture, and computer graphics, among other fields. If you're interested in learning more about triangles or other geometric shapes, there are many resources available, including textbooks, online courses, and educational websites."
