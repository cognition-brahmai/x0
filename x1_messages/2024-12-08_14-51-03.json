        "content": "Let's see. The city has a population of 1 million people, and 60% of them own cars. So first, I need to find out how many people own cars. That should be 60% of 1 million.\n\nSo, 60% of 1,000,000 is calculated as:\n\n0.60 \u00d7 1,000,000 = 600,000\n\nSo, 600,000 people own cars.\n\nNow, of these car owners, 20% have electric vehicles. So, I need to find out what 20% of 600,000 is.\n\nThat would be:\n\n0.20 \u00d7 600,000 = 120,000\n\nTherefore, there are 120,000 electric vehicles in the city.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nStarting with the population: 1,000,000 people.\n\n60% own cars: 0.60 \u00d7 1,000,000 = 600,000 car owners.\n\n20% of car owners have electric vehicles: 0.20 \u00d7 600,000 = 120,000 electric vehicles.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as overall, what percentage of the population owns electric vehicles.\n\nFirst, 60% own cars, and then 20% of those have electric vehicles, so the percentage of the population that owns electric vehicles is:\n\n0.60 \u00d7 0.20 = 0.12, or 12%.\n\nSo, 12% of 1,000,000 is indeed 120,000.\n\nEither way, the answer is 120,000 electric vehicles in the city.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120000} \\]"
