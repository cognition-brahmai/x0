        "content": "Reversing a singly linked list without using any additional data structures can be achieved by iteratively changing the pointers of each node so that they point to the previous node instead of the next one. This approach only requires a few pointer variables to keep track of the previous, current, and next nodes.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with two pointers, `prev` and `current`. Set `prev` to `None` and `current` to the head of the list.\n2. **Iteration**:\n   - While `current` is not `None`, do the following:\n     - Store the next node in a temporary variable `next`.\n     - Reverse the link of the current node to point to `prev` instead of the next node.\n     - Move `prev` and `current` one step forward: set `prev` to `current` and `current` to `next`.\n3. **Update Head**: After the loop, set the head of the list to `prev`, which will be the new first node of the reversed list.\n\nThis method modifies the list in place and does not require any extra space beyond a few pointer variables, thus adhering to the constraint of not using additional data structures.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo reverse a singly linked list in place without using any additional data structures, we can use a iterative approach that involves updating the pointers of each node to point to the previous node.\n\n### Approach\n1. Initialize three pointers: `prev` as `None`, `current` as the head of the list, and `next` to temporarily store the next node.\n2. Iterate through the list:\n   - Store the next node of the current node.\n   - Reverse the link of the current node to point to the previous node.\n   - Move `prev` and `current` one step forward.\n3. Update the head of the list to `prev` after the loop ends.\n\nThis method ensures that we reverse the list in place with O(1) extra space.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, x):\n        self.val = x\n        self.next = None\n\ndef reverseList(head):\n    prev = None\n    current = head\n    while current is not None:\n        next = current.next  # Store next node\n        current.next = prev  # Reverse the link\n        prev = current       # Move prev forward\n        current = next       # Move current forward\n    head = prev  # Update head to new first node\n    return head\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - `prev` is initialized to `None` because the new tail should point to `None`.\n   - `current` starts at the head of the list.\n\n2. **Iteration**:\n   - For each node, we first store its next node in `next`.\n   - Then, we reverse the `next` pointer of the current node to point to `prev`.\n   - We then move `prev` to the current node and `current` to the next node.\n\n3. **Termination**:\n   - When `current` becomes `None`, we have traversed the entire list.\n   - Finally, we update the head to `prev`, which is now the first node of the reversed list.\n\nThis approach efficiently reverses the list using constant extra space and runs in linear time relative to the length of the list."
