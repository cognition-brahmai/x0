        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangle. It says that the original length is 20 inches and the width is 15 inches. Then, it says that the length is increased by 50% and the width is decreased by 25%, and I need to find the new area of the rectangle after these changes.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember the formula for the area of a rectangle. I think it's just length times width, right? So, area equals length multiplied by width. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the original dimensions are 20 inches in length and 15 inches in width. But these are changing. The length is increased by 50%, and the width is decreased by 25%. So, I need to calculate what the new length and new width are going to be.\n\nLet's start with the length. Original length is 20 inches, and it's increased by 50%. To find 50% of 20, I can calculate 0.5 times 20, which is 10 inches. So, the length increases by 10 inches. Therefore, the new length is 20 inches plus 10 inches, which equals 30 inches.\n\nNext, the width is decreased by 25%. Original width is 15 inches. To find 25% of 15, I can calculate 0.25 times 15, which is 3.75 inches. So, the width decreases by 3.75 inches. Therefore, the new width is 15 inches minus 3.75 inches, which equals 11.25 inches.\n\nNow that I have the new dimensions, I can calculate the new area. So, new area equals new length times new width, which is 30 inches times 11.25 inches.\n\nLet me do that multiplication. 30 times 11 is 330, and 30 times 0.25 is 7.5, so total area is 330 plus 7.5, which equals 337.5 square inches.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nOriginal area is 20 times 15, which is 300 square inches. New area is 337.5 square inches. So, it increased by 37.5 square inches.\n\nIs that reasonable? Let's see, the length increased by 50%, which is a significant increase, and the width decreased by 25%, which is a moderate decrease. So, overall, the area should increase, which matches my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the percentage changes. If the length is increased by 50%, that's multiplying the length by 1.5. If the width is decreased by 25%, that's multiplying the width by 0.75. So, the new area would be original area times 1.5 times 0.75.\n\nLet me calculate that. Original area is 20 times 15, which is 300. Then, 300 times 1.5 is 450, and 450 times 0.75 is 337.5, which matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, it seems like 337.5 square inches is the correct new area.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Maybe using the formula for percentage changes in area.\n\nIf both dimensions are changed by certain percentages, the overall percentage change in area is approximately the sum of the percentage changes plus the product of the percentage changes divided by 100.\n\nWait, actually, for small percentage changes, there's a formula for percentage change in area, but in this case, the changes are not small, so maybe that's not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the area scale factor is the product of the scale factors for length and width.\n\nThe scale factor for length is 1.5 (since it's increased by 50%), and for width is 0.75 (decreased by 25%). So, the area scale factor is 1.5 times 0.75, which is 1.125.\n\nMultiplying the original area by the area scale factor: 300 times 1.125 equals 337.5, again confirming my earlier calculation.\n\nI think I've verified it enough. The new area of the rectangle is 337.5 square inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{337.5} \\]"
