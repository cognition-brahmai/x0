        "content": "Alright, let's try to channel some Stephen King vibes here. So, imagine you're driving through this creepy, isolated town on a stormy night, and you come across this house. It's one of those old Victorian mansions that time forgot, perched atop a hill, looming over the deserted streets like a malevolent presence.\n\nThe house itself is a monstrosity, with twisted gargoyles adorning its crumbling facade, their eyes seeming to follow you wherever you move. The once-grand windows are now shattered or boarded up, casting an eerie shadow over the overgrown lawn. vines creep up the walls, as if the very earth is trying to consume the place.\n\nAs you approach, the front door creaks open slightly, as if inviting you in, but there's something off about it. The air is thick with the scent of decay and something sweeter, like rotting fruit. You can hear whispers carried by the wind, voices that seem to be emanating from within the house.\n\nInside, it's even worse. The foyer is dark, with only flickering lightning providing any illumination. The floorboards are rotten, and every step you take echoes through the empty halls. There are portraits hanging on the walls, their subjects staring at you with lifeless eyes, as if they're watching your every move.\n\nYou venture deeper into the house, and that's when things start to get really strange. Doors slam shut on their own, and you swear you hear footsteps upstairs, but whenever you investigate, there's no one there. The temperature drops suddenly, and you can feel eyes on you, even though there's no one around.\n\nThen, you come across the attic. It's filled with dusty relics and forgotten memories, but something about it feels... wrong. Like there's a presence lurking in the shadows, watching you. You try to leave, but the door won't budge. That's when the whispers turn into screams, and you realize you're not alone in this house.\n\nSuddenly, the floor gives way beneath you, and you plummet into darkness. When you come to, you're in a basement, surrounded by cobwebs and decaying furniture. And that's when you see them\u2014the ghosts of the people who died in this house, their spirits trapped within its walls, forever haunted by their own demons.\n\nYou try to run, but the house seems to be alive, twisting its corridors to trap you. Every exit leads back to the same room, and the ghosts close in, their faces contorted in agony and rage. You're trapped, forever doomed to wander the halls of this haunted house, a prisoner of its malevolent spirit.\n\nThat's the kind of haunted house Stephen King would describe, I think\u2014equal parts terrifying and mesmerizing, with a deep sense of dread that seeps into your bones."
