        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to find out how much labor is required for each product per day and then calculate the cost based on the hourly wage. Finally, we'll multiply that daily cost by 30 to get the monthly labor cost.\n\nSo, starting with product A:\n\n- The factory produces 500 units of product A each day.\n\n- Each unit of product A requires 2 hours of labor.\n\nTherefore, the total labor hours for product A per day is:\n\n500 units * 2 hours/unit = 1000 hours\n\nSimilarly, for product B:\n\n- The factory produces 300 units of product B each day.\n\n- Each unit of product B requires 3 hours of labor.\n\nSo, the total labor hours for product B per day is:\n\n300 units * 3 hours/unit = 900 hours\n\nNow, adding the labor hours for both products to get the total labor hours per day:\n\n1000 hours (A) + 900 hours (B) = 1900 hours\n\nNext, we need to calculate the labor cost per day. Workers are paid $15 per hour, so:\n\n1900 hours * $15/hour = $28,500\n\nFinally, to find the monthly labor cost for a 30-day month:\n\n$28,500/day * 30 days = $855,000\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot of money. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nProduct A: 500 units * 2 hours/unit = 1000 hours\n\nProduct B: 300 units * 3 hours/unit = 900 hours\n\nTotal hours per day: 1000 + 900 = 1900 hours\n\nHourly wage: $15/hour\n\nDaily labor cost: 1900 hours * $15/hour = $28,500\n\nMonthly labor cost for 30 days: $28,500 * 30 = $855,000\n\nHmm, it seems correct. But maybe I should consider if there are any overtime costs or if the workers work more than 8 hours a day, but the problem doesn't specify that. So, I'll stick with $855,000 as the monthly labor cost.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{855000} \\]"
