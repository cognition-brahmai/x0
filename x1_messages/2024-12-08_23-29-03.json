        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a school's basketball team with 15 players, and they need new uniforms for the upcoming season. Each uniform set consists of a jersey and shorts, costing $75 per set. Additionally, they want to buy warm-up jackets at $60 each per player. We need to calculate the total cost for all this gear and then see if the team can afford it with their current budget of $1,800.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost for the uniform sets. There are 15 players, and each uniform set costs $75. So, the total cost for uniforms would be:\n\n15 players * $75 per uniform set = $1,125\n\nNext, we need to calculate the cost for the warm-up jackets. Again, there are 15 players, and each jacket costs $60. So, the total cost for jackets would be:\n\n15 players * $60 per jacket = $900\n\nNow, to find the total cost for all the gear, we need to add the cost of the uniforms and the cost of the jackets:\n\nTotal cost = cost of uniforms + cost of jackets\n\nTotal cost = $1,125 + $900 = $2,025\n\nOkay, so the total cost for all the new gear is $2,025.\n\nNow, the team has a current budget of $1,800. We need to determine if they can afford the $2,025 with this budget.\n\nLet's compare the total cost to the budget:\n\nTotal cost = $2,025\n\nBudget = $1,800\n\nSince $2,025 is greater than $1,800, the team cannot afford the new gear with their current budget.\n\nTo find out how much more money they need, we can subtract the budget from the total cost:\n\nAdditional money needed = total cost - budget\n\nAdditional money needed = $2,025 - $1,800 = $225\n\nSo, the team needs an additional $225 to afford the new gear.\n\nAlternatively, if the team cannot get additional funds, they might need to consider reducing the costs. For example, they could look for less expensive uniforms or jackets, or perhaps seek sponsors to help cover the costs.\n\nAnother option could be to prioritize the purchases. Maybe they can buy the uniforms now and postpone the warm-up jackets to next season, depending on their immediate needs.\n\nBut based on the current information, with a budget of $1,800 and total costs of $2,025, the team cannot afford everything they want.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2025} \\]"
