She served as queen consort to both France and England, a rare feat in history.\n\nEleanor is often depicted as an epitome of a \"queen-regnant\", a female monarch who rules in her own right rather than through marriage to a king. She was not only competent in governance but also deeply committed to cultural and intellectual growth. Known for her intelligence, charisma, and political acumen, she played a crucial role in the politics of Western Europe during the 12th century.\n\nShe is best remembered today for her patronage of literature and the arts, particularly during the period known as the Courtly Love movement. This was a philosophy that celebrated chivalry and love, which greatly influenced European literature and culture. Through her support, Eleanor fostered a vibrant court life filled with music, poetry, and scholarly discussions.\n\nUnlike many queens of her time, Eleanor of Aquitaine was actively involved in the affairs of the kingdom. Despite being married to two kings, she maintained her independence and exercised significant influence over matters of state. Her ability to navigate the complex world of medieval politics while promoting cultural development made her a remarkable figure in history.\nDaniel: How far are you from Paris?"
