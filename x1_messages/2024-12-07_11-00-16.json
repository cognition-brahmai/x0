        "content": "So the original garden is 15 meters long and 10 meters wide. That means its area is 15 times 10, which is 150 square meters. The owner wants to increase this area by 50%. So, 50% of 150 square meters is 75 square meters. Therefore, the new area should be 150 plus 75, which is 225 square meters.\n\nNow, the plan is to add an equal amount of space along both the length and the width. Let's call this equal amount \"x\" meters. So, the new length will be 15 plus x, and the new width will be 10 plus x. The area of the new garden will be (15 + x) times (10 + x), and that should equal 225 square meters.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation: (15 + x)(10 + x) = 225.\n\nLet me expand this equation: 15*10 + 15x + 10x + x\u00b2 = 225, which simplifies to 150 + 25x + x\u00b2 = 225.\n\nNow, I'll move 225 to the left side: x\u00b2 + 25x + 150 - 225 = 0, which simplifies to x\u00b2 + 25x - 75 = 0.\n\nOkay, now I have a quadratic equation: x\u00b2 + 25x - 75 = 0.\n\nI can solve this using the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a), where a = 1, b = 25, and c = -75.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discriminant: b\u00b2 - 4ac = 25\u00b2 - 4*1*(-75) = 625 + 300 = 925.\n\nNow, sqrt(925) is... let me see, 925 is 25 times 37, so sqrt(925) = sqrt(25*37) = 5*sqrt(37).\n\nSo, x = [-25 \u00b1 5*sqrt(37)] / 2.\n\nThis gives two possible solutions: x = [-25 + 5*sqrt(37)] / 2 and x = [-25 - 5*sqrt(37)] / 2.\n\nSince x represents an added space, it can't be negative. So, we'll take the positive solution: x = [-25 + 5*sqrt(37)] / 2.\n\nLet me calculate the numerical value of x.\n\nFirst, sqrt(37) is approximately 6.0828.\n\nSo, x = [-25 + 5*6.0828] / 2 = [-25 + 30.414] / 2 = (5.414)/2 = 2.707 meters.\n\nTherefore, the new length is 15 + 2.707 \u2248 17.707 meters, and the new width is 10 + 2.707 \u2248 12.707 meters.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nOriginal area: 15*10 = 150 m\u00b2.\n\nNew area: 17.707*12.707 \u2248 225 m\u00b2.\n\nYes, that's a 50% increase.\n\nSo, the new dimensions should be approximately 17.7 meters in length and 12.7 meters in width.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe new dimensions of the garden should be approximately \\boxed{17.7 \\text{ meters in length and } 12.7 \\text{ meters in width}}."
