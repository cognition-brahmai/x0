        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of people with twice as many women as men. That means if there are m men, there are 2m women. Got it.\n\nNow, 20% of the men wear glasses, and 15% of the women wear glasses. I need to find out what percentage of the whole group wears glasses.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many men wear glasses. If there are m men, and 20% of them wear glasses, then the number of men wearing glasses is 0.2m.\n\nSimilarly, the number of women wearing glasses is 15% of 2m, which is 0.15 * 2m = 0.3m.\n\nSo, the total number of people wearing glasses is 0.2m + 0.3m = 0.5m.\n\nNow, the total number of people in the group is m + 2m = 3m.\n\nTo find the percentage of the whole group that wears glasses, I need to divide the number of people wearing glasses by the total number of people and then multiply by 100.\n\nSo, (0.5m / 3m) * 100 = (0.5 / 3) * 100.\n\nLet me calculate that: 0.5 divided by 3 is approximately 0.1667, and multiplying by 100 gives about 16.67%.\n\nSo, approximately 16.67% of the whole group wears glasses.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If there are m men and 2m women, and 20% of men and 15% of women wear glasses, leading to 0.2m + 0.3m = 0.5m wearing glasses, and the total group is 3m, then yes, 0.5m / 3m is indeed 1/6, which is approximately 16.67%.\n\nSo, the answer should be approximately 16.67%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16.\\overline{6}\\%} \\]"
