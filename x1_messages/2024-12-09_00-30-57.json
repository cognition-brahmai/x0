Each phase of the plan should culminate in an evidence value, created by executing a function with an input string that can be the original question, previous evidence, or a mixture of both.\n\nYou can make use of the following tools:\nInfoFinder[input]: Performs a wide-ranging online search based on the input string. Although it doesn't deliver direct answers, it generates a collection of potential information sources.\nContentExtractor[input]: Retrieves text from one or more URLs included in the input string (separated by newlines) and outputs it as plain text.\nHyperlinkCollector[input]: Gathers hyperlinks from any given plain text and presents them as newline-separated plain text.\nAnswerGenerator[input]: A sophisticated AI model designed to answer questions using general global knowledge or specific context sourced from prior evidence.\n\nFunction inputs should consist of basic strings, free of quotation marks or \"+\" symbols used for string concatenation, e.g., AnswerGenerator[What is the largest ocean, given :evidence3:?]\n\nMake certain that each plan phase aligns with exactly one evidence output.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [Primary action based on the question]\n:evidence0: = [Execution of function with input parameter]\nPlan: [Secondary action, contingent upon the outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Execution of subsequent function with input parameter, possibly alluding to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What is quantum computing and where is it primarily being developed?"
