        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. We have three boxes, each with a different mixture of black and white balls:\n\n- Box A: 4 black, 6 white\n\n- Box B: 5 black, 7 white\n\n- Box C: 8 black, 2 white\n\nWe're supposed to pick one ball from each box without looking and find the probability that exactly two of the three balls are black.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the event is picking exactly two black balls out of three picks, one from each box.\n\nSo, I need to find all the possible ways to pick two black balls and one non-black ball, and then divide that by the total number of possible outcomes when picking one ball from each box.\n\nLet me first find the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nFor Box A: There are 4 black + 6 white = 10 balls.\n\nFor Box B: 5 black + 7 white = 12 balls.\n\nFor Box C: 8 black + 2 white = 10 balls.\n\nSince the picks are independent (picking from one box doesn't affect the others), the total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of choices from each box:\n\nTotal outcomes = 10 (from A) * 12 (from B) * 10 (from C) = 1200.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the scenarios where exactly two balls are black.\n\nThere are three possible scenarios for exactly two black balls:\n\n1. Black from A, black from B, white from C.\n\n2. Black from A, white from B, black from C.\n\n3. White from A, black from B, black from C.\n\nI'll calculate the number of ways for each scenario and then sum them up.\n\n**Scenario 1: Black from A, black from B, white from C.**\n\n- From A: 4 black balls.\n\n- From B: 5 black balls.\n\n- From C: 2 white balls.\n\nNumber of ways for this scenario: 4 * 5 * 2 = 40.\n\n**Scenario 2: Black from A, white from B, black from C.**\n\n- From A: 4 black balls.\n\n- From B: 7 white balls.\n\n- From C: 8 black balls.\n\nNumber of ways: 4 * 7 * 8 = 224.\n\n**Scenario 3: White from A, black from B, black from C.**\n\n- From A: 6 white balls.\n\n- From B: 5 black balls.\n\n- From C: 8 black balls.\n\nNumber of ways: 6 * 5 * 8 = 240.\n\nNow, sum these up to get the total number of favorable outcomes:\n\nTotal favorable = 40 + 224 + 240 = 504.\n\nFinally, the probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes:\n\nProbability = 504 / 1200.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction.\n\nBoth numerator and denominator are divisible by 24:\n\n504 \u00f7 24 = 21\n\n1200 \u00f7 24 = 50\n\nSo, Probability = 21/50.\n\nAlternatively, as a decimal, that's 0.42 or 42%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total outcomes: 10 * 12 * 10 = 1200. That seems correct.\n\nNow, favorable outcomes:\n\nScenario 1: 4 * 5 * 2 = 40.\n\nScenario 2: 4 * 7 * 8 = 224.\n\nScenario 3: 6 * 5 * 8 = 240.\n\nTotal favorable: 40 + 224 + 240 = 504.\n\nProbability: 504 / 1200 = 21/50 or 0.42.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of probabilities for each box.\n\nProbability of picking a black ball from A: 4/10 = 0.4.\n\nFrom B: 5/12 \u2248 0.4167.\n\nFrom C: 8/10 = 0.8.\n\nSo, the probability of exactly two blacks is:\n\nP(A black, B black, C white) + P(A black, B white, C black) + P(A white, B black, C black).\n\nLet's calculate each:\n\n1. P(A black) * P(B black) * P(C white) = (4/10) * (5/12) * (2/10) = (0.4) * (0.4167) * (0.2) \u2248 0.0333.\n\n2. P(A black) * P(B white) * P(C black) = (4/10) * (7/12) * (8/10) = (0.4) * (0.5833) * (0.8) \u2248 0.1867.\n\n3. P(A white) * P(B black) * P(C black) = (6/10) * (5/12) * (8/10) = (0.6) * (0.4167) * (0.8) \u2248 0.2000.\n\nNow, sum these probabilities: 0.0333 + 0.1867 + 0.2000 = 0.42, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the probability is indeed 0.42 or 42%, or as a fraction, 21/50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{21}{50}} \\]"
