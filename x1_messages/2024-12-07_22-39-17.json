Every plan should come with an associated evidence value, which is the output of one of the available functions when provided with an input string.\n\nThe tools available are:\nNetSurfer[input]: Allows the user to search for information online. This tool finds a list of sites that could potentially contain the answer to the user's question.\nPageReader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline-separated links. The input is one or more links, and it produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nHyperlinkGatherer[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline-separated response of links.\nInfoAnalyzer[input]: A question-answering language model that answers questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a :info[n]: variable, e.g., What breed is the dog, given :info1:?\n\nEach function's input should simply be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an info variable, e.g., InfoAnalyzer[What is the population of Tokyo, given :info3:?]\n\nMake sure to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should follow this format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on the input question]\n:info0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :info0:]\n:info1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :info0\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:info[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who is the founder of Microsoft and what are some of the key products they have developed?"
