        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains moving towards each other from Station A and Station B. The distance between them is 320 miles. The first train from Station A is going at 80 miles per hour, and the second train from Station B is going at 60 miles per hour. We need to find out when they will meet.\n\nOkay, so both trains are moving towards each other, so their speeds will add up relative to each other. That makes sense because they are coming from opposite directions. So, the combined speed is 80 mph plus 60 mph, which is 140 mph.\n\nNow, we have the total distance of 320 miles, and the combined speed of 140 mph. To find the time it takes for them to meet, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTime = 320 miles / 140 mph\n\nLet me calculate that. 320 divided by 140 is the same as 32 divided by 14, which is approximately 2.2857 hours.\n\nBut maybe it's better to express that in hours and minutes. So, 0.2857 hours times 60 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour) is about 17.14 minutes.\n\nSo, they will meet approximately 2 hours and 17 minutes after they both leave their respective stations.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a better way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way is to think about the relative speed. Since they are moving towards each other, the relative speed is indeed the sum of their individual speeds, which is 140 mph.\n\nSo, the time it takes for them to cover the 320 miles between them at this relative speed is indeed 320 / 140 = 2.2857 hours.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation to find the time.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time they travel until they meet as t hours.\n\nIn that time, the first train would have covered a distance of 80t miles.\n\nThe second train would have covered 60t miles.\n\nSince they are moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they cover should equal the total distance between the stations.\n\nSo:\n\n80t + 60t = 320\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n140t = 320\n\nNow, solve for t:\n\nt = 320 / 140 = 32 / 14 = 16 / 7 \u2248 2.2857 hours\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, yes, they will meet after approximately 2 hours and 17 minutes.\n\nBut maybe I can express it more precisely. 16/7 hours is the exact value.\n\nTo convert 16/7 hours into hours and minutes:\n\nFirst, 16 divided by 7 is 2 with a remainder of 2, since 7*2 = 14, and 16 - 14 = 2.\n\nSo, 2 hours and 2/7 hours.\n\nNow, convert 2/7 hours to minutes:\n\n(2/7) * 60 \u2248 17.14 minutes.\n\nSo, approximately 2 hours and 17 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, for more precision, 0.14 minutes is 0.14 * 60 = 8.4 seconds.\n\nBut maybe that's too precise for this problem.\n\nSo, the final answer is that they will meet approximately 2 hours and 17 minutes after they start.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours and } 17 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
