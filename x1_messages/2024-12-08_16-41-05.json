However, I can imagine that touching a freshly painted canvas would feel smooth and slightly tacky, depending on the type of paint used. The texture might vary based on whether it's oil paint, acrylic, or watercolor, each offering a different tactile experience. The smell of the paint could also be prominent, adding another dimension to the sensory experience."
