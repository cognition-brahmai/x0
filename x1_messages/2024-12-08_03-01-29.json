Just like how Patrick and I stick together through thick and thin, no matter what crazy adventures come our way. It's about being there for each other, sharing laughs, and even picking up each other's slack when needed. A true friend is someone who accepts you for who you are, even if you're a sponge living in a pineapple. So, remember, friendship is all about loving the person for who they are, not for what they can do for you. (As SpongeBob) That's what Mr. Krabs would call a \"good investment\"! (laughs)"
