        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We start with 12 apples on a tree.\n\nFirst, half of them fell off. So, half of 12 is 6. That means 6 apples fell off initially.\n\nNow, subtract those 6 fallen apples from the original 12:\n\n12 - 6 = 6 apples remaining on the tree.\n\nNext, a third of the remaining apples fell off. We have 6 apples left, so a third of 6 is 2.\n\nTherefore, 2 more apples fell off.\n\nNow, subtract those 2 fallen apples from the remaining 6:\n\n6 - 2 = 4 apples.\n\nSo, there are 4 apples left on the tree.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Started with: 12 apples\n\n- Half fell off: 12 / 2 = 6 fell off, leaving 6\n\n- A third of remaining fell off: 6 / 3 = 2 fell off, leaving 4\n\nFinal answer: 4 apples left on the tree.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
