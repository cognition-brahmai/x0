        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, we have a class of 40 students, and 60% of them are girls. First, I need to find out how many girls and how many boys there are in the class.\n\nTo find the number of girls, I can calculate 60% of 40:\n\nNumber of girls = 60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 girls\n\nNow, since the total number of students is 40, the number of boys would be:\n\nNumber of boys = Total students - Number of girls = 40 - 24 = 16 boys\n\nNext, it says that all the boys participated in a sports competition. So, all 16 boys participated.\n\nAdditionally, only half of the girls participated. So, half of 24 girls is:\n\nNumber of girls who participated = 0.5 * 24 = 12 girls\n\nNow, to find the total number of students who participated, I add the number of boys and the number of girls who participated:\n\nTotal participants = Number of boys who participated + Number of girls who participated = 16 + 12 = 28 students\n\nFinally, to find the percentage of the class that participated, I divide the number of participants by the total number of students and multiply by 100:\n\nPercentage participated = (Total participants / Total students) * 100 = (28 / 40) * 100 = 70%\n\nSo, 70% of the class participated in the sports competition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70\\%} \\]"
