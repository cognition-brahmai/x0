        "content": "Given the user's input and the available functions, the appropriate function to use is `csv_analytics`. The task is to count how many times 'AI' appears in the 'technology' column of a given CSV file. Therefore, the action to be performed is a \"count\" action with a filter on the 'technology' column for the value 'AI'.\n\nHere's how the parameters should be set:\n\n- `action`: \"count\"\n\n- `filters`:\n\n  - `column`: \"technology\"\n\n  - `value`: \"AI\"\n\nSince there's no mention of any date range or other filters, we don't need to include additional filters or parameters.\n\nTherefore, the response in YAML format should look like this:\n\n```yaml\nfunction: csv_analytics\nparams:\n  action: count\n  filters:\n    - column: technology\n      value: AI\n```\n\nHowever, considering that the `filters` is a list of dictionaries in the schema provided, but in the available functions description, it's mentioned as a dictionary with `column`, `value`, and `expression`. To match the provided schema, it might be safer to pass `filters` as a single dictionary unless multiple filters are needed.\n\nSo, alternatively:\n\n```yaml\nfunction: csv_analytics\nparams:\n  action: count\n  filters:\n    column: technology\n    value: AI\n```\n\nBut to be consistent with potential extensions where multiple filters might be required, using a list is advisable.\n\nHence, the first version is preferable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\texttt{function: csv\\_analytics} \\]\n\\[ \\texttt{params:} \\]\n\\[ \\texttt{\\ \\ action: count} \\]\n\\[ \\texttt{\\ \\ filters:} \\]\n\\[ \\texttt{\\ \\ \\ \\ - column: technology} \\]\n\\[ \\texttt{\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ value: AI} \\]"
