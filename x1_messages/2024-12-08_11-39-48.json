        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to understand the current situation and then figure out what changes are needed to reach the desired percentage of male employees.\n\nSo, the company has 120 employees in total. Out of these, 60% are male. That means the number of male employees is:\n\n\\[\\text{Number of males} = 60\\% \\times 120 = 0.60 \\times 120 = 72\\]\n\nSo, there are 72 male employees. The rest are female, so:\n\n\\[\\text{Number of females} = 120 - 72 = 48\\]\n\nNow, the company wants to increase the percentage of male employees to 75%. Let's denote the number of additional male employees to be hired as \\(x\\). After hiring these \\(x\\) males, the total number of employees will become \\(120 + x\\), and the number of male employees will be \\(72 + x\\).\n\nWe want the ratio of male employees to total employees to be 75%, so:\n\n\\[\\frac{72 + x}{120 + x} = 75\\% = 0.75\\]\n\nNow, we can set up the equation and solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{72 + x}{120 + x} = 0.75\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(120 + x\\) to get rid of the denominator:\n\n\\[72 + x = 0.75(120 + x)\\]\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n\\[72 + x = 90 + 0.75x\\]\n\nNow, let's isolate \\(x\\). Subtract \\(0.75x\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[72 + 0.25x = 90\\]\n\nSubtract 72 from both sides:\n\n\\[0.25x = 18\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.25:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{18}{0.25} = 72\\]\n\nSo, the company needs to hire 72 more male employees to increase the percentage of males to 75%.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this result to make sure it makes sense. If the company hires 72 more males, the total number of employees becomes \\(120 + 72 = 192\\), and the number of males becomes \\(72 + 72 = 144\\). Let's see what percentage that is:\n\n\\[\\frac{144}{192} = 0.75 = 75\\%\\]\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the answer is 72 additional male employees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]"
