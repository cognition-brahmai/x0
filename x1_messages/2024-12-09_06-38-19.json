        "content": "So there's this problem here: There are 10 houses on one side of the street and 5 houses on the other side, making a total of 15 houses. Each house has at least 1 cat and no more than 3 cats. I need to find the minimum number of cats in the town.\n\nHmm, okay. So, to find the minimum number of cats, I should probably try to assign the smallest possible number of cats to each house, right? Since each house has at least 1 cat, that means the smallest number per house is 1.\n\nSo, if every house has exactly 1 cat, then the total number of cats would be 15 houses times 1 cat each, which is 15 cats.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"no more than 3 cats,\" but it doesn't say anything about the houses having different numbers of cats. So, could all houses have exactly 1 cat?\n\nI think that's possible. So, in that case, the minimum number of cats would be 15.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way to have fewer than 15 cats? Well, if some houses have fewer cats, but the problem says each house has at least 1 cat, so no house can have fewer than 1 cat. Therefore, 15 is indeed the minimum.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a trick here. Maybe the arrangement of houses on different sides of the street matters? The problem mentions 10 houses on one side and 5 on the other. Could there be a constraint based on that?\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"There are 10 houses on one side of the street and 5 houses on the other side. If each house has at least 1 cat and no more than 3 cats, what is the minimum number of cats in the town?\"\n\nNo, it doesn't seem like the sides matter for the cat count. The constraints are the same for all houses: at least 1 cat, at most 3 cats.\n\nSo, again, to minimize the total number of cats, I should minimize the number of cats per house, which is 1 per house.\n\nTherefore, 15 is the answer.\n\nBut perhaps there's more to it. Maybe there's a condition I'm missing. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose I try to maximize the number of cats, just to see. Each house can have up to 3 cats, so maximum would be 15 houses times 3 cats, which is 45 cats.\n\nBut the question is about the minimum, not the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me into considering that some houses might have no cats, but no, it says each house has at least 1 cat.\n\nSo, unless there's some other condition, 15 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about the distribution of cats between the two sides of the street. Perhaps there's a constraint on the total number of cats per side.\n\nBut again, reading the problem, there doesn't seem to be any such constraint. It just gives the number of houses on each side and the range of cats per house.\n\nSo, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The minimum total number of cats is simply the number of houses times the minimum number of cats per house, which is 15.\n\nYes, that should be it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
