        "content": "So I've got this problem here: the population of a city doubles every 20 years, and the current population is 100,000. I need to find out what the population will be after 60 years. Hmm, doubling every 20 years, that sounds like exponential growth, right? I remember that exponential growth can be modeled with a formula, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the concept of doubling time. Doubling time is the time it takes for a quantity to double in size at a constant rate of growth. In this case, the doubling time is 20 years. So, if the population is 100,000 now, in 20 years it will be 200,000, then in another 20 years (so 40 years total), it will be 400,000, and so on.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the population after 60 years. That's three 20-year periods, right? So, starting with 100,000:\n\n- After 20 years: 100,000 * 2 = 200,000\n\n- After 40 years: 200,000 * 2 = 400,000\n\n- After 60 years: 400,000 * 2 = 800,000\n\nSo, the population after 60 years would be 800,000. That seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check with a formula to make sure.\n\nI recall that the general formula for exponential growth is:\n\n\\[ P(t) = P_0 \\times (1 + r)^t \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( P(t) \\) is the population at time \\( t \\)\n\n- \\( P_0 \\) is the initial population\n\n- \\( r \\) is the growth rate\n\n- \\( t \\) is time\n\nBut in this case, I have the doubling time instead of the growth rate. How can I find \\( r \\) from the doubling time?\n\nI know that after the doubling time \\( t_d \\), the population doubles, so:\n\n\\[ P(t_d) = 2 \\times P_0 \\]\n\nPlugging into the exponential growth formula:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times P_0 = P_0 \\times (1 + r)^{t_d} \\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( P_0 \\):\n\n\\[ 2 = (1 + r)^{t_d} \\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\ln(2) = t_d \\times \\ln(1 + r) \\]\n\nSolving for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ r = e^{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_d}} - 1 \\]\n\nGiven that the doubling time \\( t_d \\) is 20 years:\n\n\\[ r = e^{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{20}} - 1 \\]\n\nI can calculate this value. Let's see:\n\nFirst, \\( \\ln(2) \\) is approximately 0.6931.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ r = e^{\\frac{0.6931}{20}} - 1 \\]\n\n\\[ r = e^{0.034655} - 1 \\]\n\nUsing a calculator for \\( e^{0.034655} \\):\n\n\\[ e^{0.034655} \\approx 1.03526 \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ r \\approx 1.03526 - 1 = 0.03526 \\]\n\nSo, the growth rate \\( r \\) is approximately 3.526% per year.\n\nNow, plugging back into the exponential growth formula:\n\n\\[ P(t) = P_0 \\times (1 + r)^t \\]\n\n\\[ P(60) = 100,000 \\times (1 + 0.03526)^{60} \\]\n\nCalculating \\( (1 + 0.03526)^{60} \\):\n\n\\[ (1.03526)^{60} \\approx 6.000 \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ P(60) = 100,000 \\times 6 = 600,000 \\]\n\nWait a minute, that can't be right. Earlier, by simply doubling every 20 years, I got 800,000, but now using the formula, I get 600,000. There's a discrepancy here. What did I do wrong?\n\nLet me check my calculations again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the growth rate \\( r \\).\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[ r = e^{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{20}} - 1 \\]\n\n\\[ r = e^{0.034655} - 1 \\]\n\n\\[ e^{0.034655} \\approx 1.03526 \\]\n\n\\[ r \\approx 0.03526 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ P(60) = 100,000 \\times (1.03526)^{60} \\]\n\n\\[ (1.03526)^{60} \\approx 6.000 \\]\n\n\\[ P(60) = 100,000 \\times 6 = 600,000 \\]\n\nBut according to the simple doubling method, it should be 800,000. There's a clear discrepancy here. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something fundamental about exponential growth.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Perhaps there's a better formula to use when dealing with doubling time directly.\n\nI recall there's a formula that relates the population to the doubling time:\n\n\\[ P(t) = P_0 \\times 2^{\\frac{t}{t_d}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( P(t) \\) is the population at time \\( t \\)\n\n- \\( P_0 \\) is the initial population\n\n- \\( t \\) is time\n\n- \\( t_d \\) is the doubling time\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n\n\\[ P(60) = 100,000 \\times 2^{\\frac{60}{20}} \\]\n\n\\[ P(60) = 100,000 \\times 2^{3} \\]\n\n\\[ P(60) = 100,000 \\times 8 \\]\n\n\\[ P(60) = 800,000 \\]\n\nOkay, now this matches my initial simple calculation. So, according to this formula, the population after 60 years should be 800,000.\n\nBut earlier, using the exponential growth formula with the calculated growth rate, I got 600,000. There's obviously a mistake in that approach.\n\nLet me see where I went wrong. Perhaps the mistake is in how I calculated the growth rate \\( r \\).\n\nWait, maybe I should use a different method to find \\( r \\). I know that if the population doubles in \\( t_d \\) years, then:\n\n\\[ 2 = (1 + r)^{t_d} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ r = 2^{\\frac{1}{t_d}} - 1 \\]\n\nLet's try that.\n\nGiven \\( t_d = 20 \\) years:\n\n\\[ r = 2^{\\frac{1}{20}} - 1 \\]\n\nCalculating \\( 2^{\\frac{1}{20}} \\):\n\n\\[ 2^{\\frac{1}{20}} \\approx 1.03526 \\]\n\n\\[ r \\approx 1.03526 - 1 = 0.03526 \\]\n\nSo, \\( r \\approx 3.526\\% \\) per year, which is the same as before.\n\nNow, plugging back into the exponential growth formula:\n\n\\[ P(t) = P_0 \\times (1 + r)^t \\]\n\n\\[ P(60) = 100,000 \\times (1.03526)^{60} \\]\n\nWait, earlier I got \\( (1.03526)^{60} \\approx 6.000 \\), but according to the doubling formula, it should be 8.\n\nLet me recalculate \\( (1.03526)^{60} \\):\n\nUsing a calculator:\n\n\\[ (1.03526)^{20} \\approx 2 \\]\n\n\\[ (1.03526)^{40} \\approx 4 \\]\n\n\\[ (1.03526)^{60} \\approx 8 \\]\n\nWait, actually, if \\( (1.03526)^{20} = 2 \\), then \\( (1.03526)^{60} = (2)^3 = 8 \\).\n\nSo, \\( P(60) = 100,000 \\times 8 = 800,000 \\).\n\nAh, I see my mistake now. Earlier, I thought \\( (1.03526)^{60} \\approx 6.000 \\), but that's not correct. It actually equals 8, which matches the doubling formula.\n\nSo, the correct population after 60 years is 800,000.\n\nI must have made a error in calculating \\( (1.03526)^{60} \\) previously. It's important to double-check calculations, especially when there are discrepancies.\n\nThis also reinforces the idea that when dealing with doubling time, using the formula \\( P(t) = P_0 \\times 2^{\\frac{t}{t_d}} \\) is more straightforward and less prone to error.\n\nIn summary, the population after 60 years will be 800,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{800000} \\]"
