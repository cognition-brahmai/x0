They have transparent bodies and long antennae.\n   - **Behaviors:** They form large swarms and feed on organic matter that falls from upper layers of the ocean.\n\n2. **Bamboo Brittle Star:**\n   - **Depth:** Found at approximately 5,500 meters.\n   - **Characteristics:** This brittle star has long, slender arms that resemble bamboo, with a dark brown coloration.\n   - **Behaviors:** It lives among deep-sea corals and feeds on plankton and other organic particles.\n\n3. **Dumbo Octopus:**\n   - **Depth:** Inhabits depths from 3,000 to 4,000 meters.\n   - **Characteristics:** Small in size, usually around 20 cm long, with a rounded body and distinctive ear-like fins.\n   - **Behaviors:** It uses its fins to maneuver through the water, similar to flying, and burrows into soft sediment. It feeds on bivalves and crustaceans."
