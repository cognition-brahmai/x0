        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a box with 10 black balls, 20 white balls, and 30 red balls. I need to figure out the maximum number of balls I have to draw without looking to guarantee that I get at least one pair of matching colors. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's not about finding the probability of drawing a pair, but rather determining the maximum number of balls I must draw to ensure that at least two of them are the same color, regardless of what happens. So, it's about worst-case scenarios.\n\nI remember there's a principle in combinatorics called the pigeonhole principle that might apply here. The pigeonhole principle basically says that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole has more than one pigeon. Translating that here, the \"pigeons\" are the balls I draw, and the \"pigeonholes\" are the colors.\n\nSo, the colors are black, white, and red. That means there are 3 pigeonholes. To apply the pigeonhole principle, I need to find out how many balls (pigeons) I need to draw to ensure that at least one color (pigeonhole) has at least two balls.\n\nLet's think about the worst-case scenario. What's the maximum number of balls I can draw without getting a pair of the same color? That would be drawing one ball from each color. So, one black, one white, and one red. That's 3 balls, and still, no pair.\n\nBut as soon as I draw the fourth ball, it has to be one of the three colors, right? So, regardless of which color it is, it will match one of the balls I've already drawn. Therefore, the maximum number of balls I need to draw to guarantee a matching pair is 4.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Suppose I draw one black, one white, and one red ball. That's 3 balls, and no pairs yet. The next ball I draw, the fourth one, has to be either black, white, or red. If it's black, then it matches the black ball I already have; if it's white, it matches the white one; and if it's red, it matches the red one. So, yes, the fourth ball guarantees a pair.\n\nIs there any way to draw more than 4 balls without getting a pair? Let's see. If I draw a fifth ball, it will still have to be one of the three colors, so it will match one of the previous balls. So, 4 is indeed the maximum number needed to guarantee a pair.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the quantities of each color. There are 10 black, 20 white, and 30 red balls. Does the number of balls of each color affect the result? In this case, no, because no matter how many balls there are of each color, as long as there are only three colors, the pigeonhole principle applies in the same way.\n\nHowever, if there were more colors, I would need to adjust accordingly. But since there are only three colors, the maximum number remains 4.\n\nLet me think of another way to approach this. Suppose I have n colors. In the general case, the maximum number of balls I need to draw to guarantee a pair is n + 1. Because I could draw one ball of each color (n balls) and still not have a pair, but the (n+1)th ball will necessarily match one of the existing colors.\n\nIn this problem, n = 3 (black, white, red), so n + 1 = 4. That matches what I concluded earlier.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider a simpler example. Suppose there are only two colors: black and white. What's the maximum number of balls I need to draw to guarantee a pair? Well, in the worst case, I draw one black and one white (2 balls), and the third ball I draw will be either black or white, matching one of the first two. So, 3 balls guarantee a pair.\n\nSimilarly, with three colors, it's 4 balls.\n\nSo, generalizing, for n colors, it's n + 1 balls.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the answer should be 4.\n\nBut let's think about it another way. Maybe there's a formula or a different approach that could confirm this.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the total number of possible colors. Here, there are three colors. The worst-case scenario is drawing one ball of each color without getting a pair. The next ball drawn will inevitably create a pair.\n\nSo, again, 4 balls are needed.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about combinations. The number of ways to choose two balls of the same color.\n\nBut that seems more complicated for this problem, which is more about guarantees than probabilities.\n\nWait, actually, this isn't a probability problem; it's about guarantees based on the pigeonhole principle.\n\nSo, sticking with that approach seems best.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the maximum number of balls needed to draw to guarantee a matching pair is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
