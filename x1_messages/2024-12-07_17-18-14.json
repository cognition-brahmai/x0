        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. We have two boxes, Box A and Box B, each containing apples and oranges. Box A has 10 apples and 20 oranges, and Box B has 15 apples and 5 oranges. We're supposed to find the probability that if we pick one fruit from each box, both fruits are of the same type.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for both fruits to be of the same type. That means either both are apples or both are oranges. So, the total probability should be the sum of the probabilities of these two independent events.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- P(AA) as the probability that both fruits are apples.\n\n- P(OO) as the probability that both fruits are oranges.\n\nThen, the total probability P(same type) = P(AA) + P(OO).\n\nNow, let's calculate P(AA). To find the probability that both fruits are apples, we need to find the probability of picking an apple from Box A and an apple from Box B.\n\nThe probability of picking an apple from Box A is the number of apples in Box A divided by the total number of fruits in Box A. Box A has 10 apples and 20 oranges, so the total number of fruits in Box A is 10 + 20 = 30. Therefore, P(Apple from A) = 10/30 = 1/3.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking an apple from Box B is the number of apples in Box B divided by the total number of fruits in Box B. Box B has 15 apples and 5 oranges, so the total number of fruits in Box B is 15 + 5 = 20. Therefore, P(Apple from B) = 15/20 = 3/4.\n\nSince these are independent events, P(AA) = P(Apple from A) * P(Apple from B) = (1/3) * (3/4) = 1/4.\n\nNext, let's calculate P(OO), the probability that both fruits are oranges.\n\nThe probability of picking an orange from Box A is the number of oranges in Box A divided by the total number of fruits in Box A. We already know that's 20 oranges out of 30 fruits, so P(Orange from A) = 20/30 = 2/3.\n\nThe probability of picking an orange from Box B is the number of oranges in Box B divided by the total number of fruits in Box B. That's 5 oranges out of 20 fruits, so P(Orange from B) = 5/20 = 1/4.\n\nAgain, since these are independent events, P(OO) = P(Orange from A) * P(Orange from B) = (2/3) * (1/4) = 1/6.\n\nNow, adding P(AA) and P(OO) to get the total probability that both fruits are of the same type:\n\nP(same type) = P(AA) + P(OO) = 1/4 + 1/6.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator, which is 12 in this case.\n\nSo, 1/4 = 3/12 and 1/6 = 2/12.\n\nTherefore, P(same type) = 3/12 + 2/12 = 5/12.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. For example, maybe I can calculate the probability that the fruits are of different types and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability that they are the same.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, find P(one fruit is apple and the other is orange) plus P(one fruit is orange and the other is apple).\n\nSo, P(different types) = P(AO) + P(OA),\n\nwhere P(AO) is the probability that the fruit from Box A is apple and from Box B is orange,\n\nand P(OA) is the probability that the fruit from Box A is orange and from Box B is apple.\n\nWe already have P(Apple from A) = 1/3, P(Orange from B) = 1/4, so P(AO) = (1/3)*(1/4) = 1/12.\n\nSimilarly, P(Orange from A) = 2/3, P(Apple from B) = 3/4, so P(OA) = (2/3)*(3/4) = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, P(different types) = 1/12 + 1/2 = 1/12 + 6/12 = 7/12.\n\nThen, P(same type) = 1 - P(different types) = 1 - 7/12 = 5/12.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, the probability that both fruits are of the same type is 5/12.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Maybe using combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick one fruit from each box is the product of the number of fruits in each box.\n\nTotal ways = 30 (from A) * 20 (from B) = 600.\n\nNow, the number of ways to pick two apples: number of apples in A times number of apples in B = 10 * 15 = 150.\n\nThe number of ways to pick two oranges: number of oranges in A times number of oranges in B = 20 * 5 = 100.\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 150 + 100 = 250.\n\nSo, the probability is 250/600 = 5/12.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIt seems consistent across different methods, so I can be confident that 5/12 is the correct probability that both fruits are of the same type.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{12}} \\]"
