Each plan should have an associated evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user question, one or more previous evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nHere are the tools you can use:\nWebSearch[input]: A tool that allows the user to search for information on the web. This tool is useful in finding a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts text from a webpage given its URL. The input must be a URL and the output is plain text containing the content of the page.\nLinkFinder[input]: Finds links within a block of text. The input is a string of text and the output is a list of URLs found within the text.\nQAModel[input]: A question answering model that can answer questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., What color is the cat, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe format of the output should be as follows:\nPlan: [first action to take based on the input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what is their most famous work?"

        "content": "Alright, I need to find out who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what their most famous work is. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably look up who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020. I can use the WebSearch tool for this. I'll search for \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner.\"\n\nPlan: Search for the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020.\n:evidence0: = WebSearch[\"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner\"]\n\nOnce I have the name of the winner from the search results, I need to find out what their most famous work is. For that, I might need to visit their official website or a reliable biography page to get accurate information.\n\nPlan: Extract text from the top result of the web search to get the winner's name.\n:evidence1: = TextExtractor[:evidence0:first URL]\n\nAfter getting the winner's name, I can then search for their most famous work. Maybe I can use the QAModel to ask directly about their famous work, referencing the text I extracted.\n\nPlan: Use QAModel to find out the most famous work of the winner.\n:evidence2: = QAModel[\"Who is the Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner and what is their most famous work? Given context :evidence1:\"]\n\nBut wait, maybe I should look for a specific biography or a page that lists their works to ensure I get accurate information about their most famous work. Perhaps using LinkFinder on the initial search results could help me find relevant pages.\n\nPlan: Find links in the search results that might lead to the winner's biography or list of works.\n:evidence3: = LinkFinder[:evidence0:]\n\nThen, I can choose one of those links, extract the text, and use the QAModel to find the most famous work.\n\nPlan: Extract text from the most relevant link found.\n:evidence4: = TextExtractor[:evidence3:first URL]\n\nPlan: Use QAModel to identify the most famous work from the extracted text.\n:evidence5: = QAModel[\"What is the most famous work of [Winner's Name]? Given context :evidence4:\"]\n\nHmm, I need to make sure that I have the winner's name correctly. Maybe I should first extract the name from the search results and then use it in subsequent steps.\n\nPlan: Extract the winner's name from the search results.\n:evidence6: = QAModel[\"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020? Given context :evidence0:\"]\n\nThen, use this name to search for their most famous work.\n\nPlan: Search for the most famous work of the winner.\n:evidence7: = WebSearch[\"Most famous work of :evidence6:\"]\n\nPlan: Extract text from the top result of this search.\n:evidence8: = TextExtractor[:evidence7:first URL]\n\nFinally, use the QAModel to pinpoint the most famous work.\n\nPlan: Ask the QAModel to identify the most famous work.\n:evidence9: = QAModel[\"What is the most famous work of :evidence6:? Given context :evidence8:\"]\n\nNow, to compile the final answer, I need to combine the winner's name and their most famous work.\n\nPlan: Formulate the final answer using the information from :evidence6: and :evidence9:.\n:evidence10: = QAModel[\"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what is their most famous work? Given winner name :evidence6: and most famous work :evidence9:\"]\n\nAnswer: :evidence10:\n\n**Final Plan:**\n\n1. Plan: Search for the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020.\n   - :evidence0: = WebSearch[\"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner\"]\n\n2. Plan: Extract the winner's name from the search results.\n   - :evidence1: = QAModel[\"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020? Given context :evidence0:\"]\n\n3. Plan: Search for the most famous work of the winner.\n   - :evidence2: = WebSearch[\"Most famous work of :evidence1:\"]\n\n4. Plan: Extract text from the top result of this search.\n   - :evidence3: = TextExtractor[:evidence2:first URL]\n\n5. Plan: Use the QAModel to identify the most famous work.\n   - :evidence4: = QAModel[\"What is the most famous work of :evidence1:? Given context :evidence3:\"]\n\n6. Plan: Formulate the final answer using the winner's name and their most famous work.\n   - :evidence5: = QAModel[\"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what is their most famous work? Given winner name :evidence1: and most famous work :evidence4:\"]\n\n**Final Answer:** :evidence5:"
