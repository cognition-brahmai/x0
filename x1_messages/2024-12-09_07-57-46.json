        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about students passing exams. There are 40 students in total. 75% passed the math exam, 80% passed the English exam, and 70% passed both exams. I need to find out how many students failed both exams.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many students passed each exam and how many passed both. Then, I can use that information to find out who failed both.\n\nSo, 75% of 40 students passed math. Let me calculate that:\n\n75% of 40 is 0.75 times 40, which is 30 students.\n\nSimilarly, 80% of 40 students passed English:\n\n80% of 40 is 0.8 times 40, which is 32 students.\n\nAnd 70% passed both:\n\n70% of 40 is 0.7 times 40, which is 28 students.\n\nNow, I know that some students passed both exams, some passed only one, and some failed both.\n\nMaybe I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The total number of students who passed at least one exam is equal to the number who passed math plus the number who passed English minus the number who passed both.\n\nSo, that would be 30 (math) + 32 (English) - 28 (both) = 34 students passed at least one exam.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who failed both exams would be the total number of students minus those who passed at least one exam.\n\nThat is 40 - 34 = 6 students.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if this makes sense.\n\nI have 30 who passed math, 32 who passed English, and 28 who passed both.\n\nSo, the number who passed only math is 30 - 28 = 2.\n\nThe number who passed only English is 32 - 28 = 4.\n\nAnd the number who passed both is 28.\n\nSo, total students who passed at least one exam is 2 (only math) + 4 (only English) + 28 (both) = 34.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the number who failed both is 40 - 34 = 6.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
