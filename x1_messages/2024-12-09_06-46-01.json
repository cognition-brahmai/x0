        "content": "To determine how many additional doctors and nurses are needed to reduce the waiting time in the emergency department (ED) from 90 minutes to 60 minutes or less, we need to analyze the current patient flow and calculate the required capacity.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Current Situation\n\n- **Average patients per day:** 250\n- **Average waiting time:** 90 minutes\n\n### Step 2: Determine Current Throughput\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many patients are being seen per hour currently.\n\nAssuming the ED operates for a certain number of hours per day, let's denote:\n\n- \\( H \\) = number of hours the ED is open per day\n\nThen, the current patient arrival rate is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Arrival rate} = \\frac{250 \\text{ patients}}{H \\text{ hours}} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Current Treatment Capacity\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\( D \\) = number of current doctors\n- \\( N \\) = number of current nurses\n\nAssuming each doctor and nurse can see 10 patients per hour, the total treatment capacity per hour is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Treatment capacity} = (D + N) \\times 10 \\text{ patients per hour} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Relationship Between Arrival Rate and Treatment Capacity\n\nIn queueing theory, waiting time is influenced by the relationship between arrival rate and service rate. For simplicity, we can use the formula for waiting time in a single-server queue (M/M/1 queue), but since there are multiple servers, we'll use the M/M/c queue model, where \\( c \\) is the number of servers.\n\nHowever, for this problem, we can simplify the approach by considering the desired waiting time and calculating the required treatment capacity.\n\n### Step 5: Determine Required Treatment Capacity\n\nWe need to reduce the waiting time to 60 minutes or less. To achieve this, the treatment capacity should be higher than the arrival rate.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- \\( \\lambda \\) = arrival rate (patients per hour)\n- \\( \\mu \\) = treatment rate per doctor/nurse (10 patients per hour)\n- \\( c \\) = total number of doctors and nurses\n\nThe waiting time in queue \\( W_q \\) in an M/M/c queue is given by:\n\n\\[ W_q = \\frac{\\rho^c}{c!(c\\mu - \\lambda)} \\times \\frac{1}{\\mu(c - \\rho)} \\]\n\nWhere \\( \\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{c\\mu} \\) is the utilization factor.\n\nThis formula is complex, so for simplicity, we can use the fact that waiting time is inversely proportional to the treatment capacity.\n\nGiven that the current waiting time is 90 minutes with current staff, and we want to reduce it to 60 minutes, we can set up a proportion.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\( c_{\\text{current}} \\) = current number of doctors and nurses\n- \\( c_{\\text{required}} \\) = required number of doctors and nurses\n\nAssuming that waiting time is inversely proportional to the treatment capacity:\n\n\\[ \\frac{W_{\\text{current}}}{W_{\\text{desired}}} = \\frac{c_{\\text{required}}}{c_{\\text{current}}} \\]\n\nHowever, this is not entirely accurate, but for estimation purposes, we can use it.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the required treatment capacity based on the desired waiting time.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate Required Number of Staff\n\nFirst, find the arrival rate \\( \\lambda \\):\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{250 \\text{ patients}}{H \\text{ hours}} \\]\n\nAssume the ED operates for 24 hours:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{250}{24} \\approx 10.42 \\text{ patients per hour} \\]\n\nEach doctor and nurse can see 10 patients per hour.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total number of doctors and nurses as \\( c \\).\n\nThe total treatment rate is \\( c \\times 10 \\) patients per hour.\n\nTo reduce the waiting time, we need to increase the treatment rate.\n\nWe can use the formula for waiting time in an M/M/c queue to find the required \\( c \\).\n\nHowever, for simplicity, let's assume that the waiting time is inversely proportional to the number of staff.\n\nCurrent waiting time: 90 minutes\n\nDesired waiting time: 60 minutes\n\nRatio of waiting times:\n\n\\[ \\frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \\]\n\nTherefore, to reduce the waiting time by a factor of 1.5, we need to increase the number of staff by a factor of 1.5.\n\nSo, \\( c_{\\text{required}} = 1.5 \\times c_{\\text{current}} \\)\n\nBut we don't know \\( c_{\\text{current}} \\).\n\nAlternatively, let's calculate the current and required treatment rates.\n\nCurrent waiting time is 90 minutes, which is 1.5 hours.\n\nDesired waiting time is 60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nAssuming that waiting time is proportional to the queue length, and queue length is determined by the difference between arrival rate and treatment rate.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for a simple estimation.\n\nLet\u2019s try a different approach.\n\n### Step 7: Use Little's Law\n\nLittle's Law states that:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average number of patients in the system} = \\lambda \\times W \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( \\lambda \\) = arrival rate\n- \\( W \\) = average time spent in the system\n\nCurrently:\n\n\\[ L_{\\text{current}} = 250 / 24 \\times 1.5 = 10.42 \\times 1.5 \\approx 15.63 \\text{ patients} \\]\n\nDesired:\n\n\\[ L_{\\text{desired}} = 250 / 24 \\times 1 = 10.42 \\times 1 \\approx 10.42 \\text{ patients} \\]\n\nThe reduction in the number of patients in the system is approximately 15.63 - 10.42 = 5.21 patients.\n\nEach additional doctor/nurse can see 10 patients per hour.\n\nSo, the additional treatment capacity needed is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Additional treatment rate} = \\frac{5.21 \\text{ patients}}{1 \\text{ hour}} \\]\n\nSince each doctor/nurse can see 10 patients per hour, the number of additional staff needed is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Additional staff} = \\frac{5.21}{10} \\approx 0.52 \\]\n\nThis suggests that less than one additional doctor or nurse is needed, which is not practical.\n\nHowever, this result seems counterintuitive because reducing waiting time typically requires more staff.\n\n### Step 8: Reevaluate Approach\n\nPerhaps using Little's Law isn't the best approach here. Let's try calculating the required number of staff based on the desired waiting time.\n\nIn queueing theory, for an M/M/c queue, the waiting time can be calculated using:\n\n\\[ W_q = \\frac{\\rho^c}{c!(c\\mu - \\lambda)} \\times \\frac{1}{\\mu(c - \\rho)} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( \\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{c\\mu} \\)\n\nThis is complex to solve directly, so let's use an approximation.\n\n### Step 9: Use Queueing Theory Approximation\n\nWe can use the Erlang C formula to find the number of servers needed for a desired waiting time.\n\nHowever, the Erlang C formula is typically used to find the number of servers for a desired service level (e.g., percentage of calls answered within a certain time), not directly for waiting time.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that in an M/M/c queue, the waiting time decreases as the number of servers increases.\n\nGiven that, we can set up an equation where the waiting time is less than or equal to 60 minutes.\n\nBut this requires knowing the current number of doctors and nurses, which we don't have.\n\n### Step 10: Make Assumptions About Current Staffing\n\nLet's assume that currently, there are \\( c \\) doctors and nurses combined.\n\nEach can see 10 patients per hour.\n\nTotal treatment rate: \\( 10c \\) patients per hour.\n\nArrival rate: \\( \\lambda = 10.42 \\) patients per hour.\n\nUtilization factor: \\( \\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{c\\mu} = \\frac{10.42}{10c} = \\frac{10.42}{10c} = \\frac{1.042}{c} \\)\n\nFor the system to be stable, \\( \\rho < 1 \\), so \\( c > 1.042 \\). Since \\( c \\) must be an integer, \\( c \\geq 2 \\).\n\n### Step 11: Calculate Waiting Time for Different Values of c\n\nLet's calculate the waiting time for different values of \\( c \\) and find the smallest \\( c \\) that results in \\( W_q \\leq 1 \\) hour.\n\nUsing the formula for waiting time in an M/M/c queue:\n\n\\[ W_q = \\frac{\\rho^c}{c!(c\\mu - \\lambda)} \\times \\frac{1}{\\mu(c - \\rho)} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ W_q = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1.042}{c} \\right)^c}{c! \\left( 10c - 10.42 \\right)} \\times \\frac{1}{10(c - \\frac{1.042}{c})} \\]\n\nThis is complicated to compute manually, so let's try specific values of \\( c \\).\n\n#### For \\( c = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ \\rho = \\frac{1.042}{2} = 0.521 \\]\n\n\\[ W_q = \\frac{(0.521)^2}{2!(20 - 10.42)} \\times \\frac{1}{10(2 - 0.521)} \\]\n\n\\[ W_q = \\frac{0.271}{2 \\times 9.58} \\times \\frac{1}{10 \\times 1.479} \\]\n\n\\[ W_q = \\frac{0.271}{19.16} \\times \\frac{1}{14.79} \\]\n\n\\[ W_q \\approx 0.0141 \\times 0.0676 \\approx 0.00095 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThis is much less than 1 hour, which suggests that with 2 doctors and nurses combined, the waiting time would be very low.\n\nHowever, this seems inconsistent with the current situation where waiting time is 90 minutes with current staffing.\n\nThis indicates that our assumption about current staffing is incorrect.\n\n### Step 12: Reassess Current Staffing\n\nGiven that with \\( c = 2 \\), waiting time is much less than 90 minutes, but currently, waiting time is 90 minutes, it suggests that current staffing is less than 2, which is unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the treatment rate per doctor/nurse is overestimated.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that each doctor and nurse can see 10 patients per hour only when working together efficiently, but in reality, nurses and doctors have different roles.\n\nMaybe we need to model doctors and nurses separately.\n\n### Step 13: Model Doctors and Nurses Separately\n\nAssume that doctors are the bottleneck since they are likely to be fewer and have more critical tasks.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that nurses can handle initial assessments and triage, but doctors are needed for final evaluations.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of doctors is the limiting factor.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that nurses assist doctors, allowing each doctor to see more patients per hour.\n\nHowever, this complicates the model significantly.\n\nGiven time constraints, let's simplify by assuming that the combined effort of doctors and nurses allows them to see 10 patients per hour per staff member.\n\n### Step 14: Use Current Waiting Time to Find Current Staffing\n\nGiven that current waiting time is 90 minutes, and desired is 60 minutes, we can set up a proportion.\n\nIf waiting time is inversely proportional to staff, then:\n\n\\[ \\frac{W_{\\text{current}}}{W_{\\text{desired}}} = \\frac{c_{\\text{required}}}{c_{\\text{current}}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{90}{60} = \\frac{c_{\\text{required}}}{c_{\\text{current}}} \\]\n\n\\[ 1.5 = \\frac{c_{\\text{required}}}{c_{\\text{current}}} \\]\n\n\\[ c_{\\text{required}} = 1.5 \\times c_{\\text{current}} \\]\n\nBut without knowing \\( c_{\\text{current}} \\), this is not helpful.\n\n### Step 15: Estimate Current Staffing from Waiting Time\n\nAlternatively, we can estimate the current number of staff based on the current waiting time.\n\nGiven that current waiting time is 90 minutes, and desired is 60 minutes, we can assume that reducing waiting time by 33% requires increasing staff by a certain amount.\n\nHowever, this is a rough estimate.\n\n### Step 16: Consider Hiring Additional Staff Proportionally\n\nIf the hospital hires additional doctors and nurses such that the total treatment capacity increases by a certain factor, we can calculate the required increase.\n\nGiven that waiting time needs to decrease by 33% (from 90 to 60 minutes), we can assume that treatment capacity needs to increase by 50%.\n\nThis is based on the relationship in queueing theory where waiting time is inversely proportional to the excess of service rate over arrival rate.\n\nSo, if we increase the service rate by 50%, waiting time decreases by 33%.\n\nTherefore, to achieve the desired waiting time, the hospital needs to increase its treatment capacity by 50%.\n\n### Step 17: Calculate Additional Staff Needed\n\nIf the current treatment capacity is \\( c \\) staff members, each treating 10 patients per hour, then the current treatment rate is \\( 10c \\) patients per hour.\n\nTo increase treatment capacity by 50%, the new treatment capacity should be \\( 1.5 \\times 10c = 15c \\) patients per hour.\n\nThis would require \\( c_{\\text{required}} = \\frac{15c}{10} = 1.5c \\) staff members.\n\nTherefore, additional staff needed is \\( 1.5c - c = 0.5c \\).\n\nBut without knowing \\( c \\), we can't find the exact number.\n\n### Step 18: Estimate Current Staff Based on Patient Volume\n\nLet\u2019s estimate the current number of staff based on the patient volume.\n\nAssuming the ED sees 250 patients per day over 24 hours, with each staff member (doctor or nurse) treating 10 patients per hour.\n\nTotal treatment required per day: 250 patients.\n\nTreatment capacity per staff per day: 10 patients/hour * 24 hours = 240 patients per staff per day.\n\nTherefore, the number of staff needed to handle 250 patients per day is:\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{250}{240} \\approx 1.04 \\]\n\nThis suggests that approximately 1 staff member can handle the patient volume, but this doesn't account for waiting times.\n\nHowever, in reality, having only one staff member would lead to long waiting times, which aligns with the current 90-minute waiting time.\n\n### Step 19: Determine Required Staff for Desired Waiting Time\n\nGiven that current waiting time is 90 minutes with approximately 1 staff member, and we want to reduce it to 60 minutes, we can use the earlier proportion.\n\n\\[ c_{\\text{required}} = 1.5 \\times c_{\\text{current}} = 1.5 \\times 1.04 \\approx 1.56 \\]\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a staff member, we'd need to round up to 2 staff members.\n\nTherefore, the hospital needs to hire approximately 1 additional staff member (from 1 to 2).\n\nHowever, this seems too low given the initial waiting time of 90 minutes.\n\n### Step 20: Consider Refining the Model\n\nPerhaps a more accurate model is needed.\n\nLet\u2019s consider using the formula for waiting time in an M/M/c queue.\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\( \\lambda = 10.42 \\) patients per hour\n- \\( \\mu = 10 \\) patients per hour per staff\n- \\( c \\) = number of staff\n\nThe waiting time in queue \\( W_q \\) is:\n\n\\[ W_q = \\frac{\\rho^c}{c!(c\\mu - \\lambda)} \\times \\frac{1}{\\mu(c - \\rho)} \\]\n\nWhere \\( \\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{c\\mu} = \\frac{10.42}{10c} = \\frac{1.042}{c} \\)\n\nWe want \\( W_q \\leq 1 \\) hour.\n\nLet\u2019s try different values of \\( c \\) to find the smallest integer \\( c \\) that satisfies this condition.\n\n#### For \\( c = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ \\rho = \\frac{1.042}{1} = 1.042 \\]\n\nSince \\( \\rho > 1 \\), the queue is unstable, and waiting time is infinite. This matches the current situation where waiting time is 90 minutes, indicating that \\( c = 1 \\) is insufficient.\n\n#### For \\( c = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ \\rho = \\frac{1.042}{2} = 0.521 \\]\n\n\\[ W_q = \\frac{(0.521)^2}{2!(20 - 10.42)} \\times \\frac{1}{10(2 - 0.521)} \\]\n\n\\[ W_q = \\frac{0.271}{2 \\times 9.58} \\times \\frac{1}{10 \\times 1.479} \\]\n\n\\[ W_q = \\frac{0.271}{19.16} \\times \\frac{1}{14.79} \\]\n\n\\[ W_q \\approx 0.0141 \\times 0.0676 \\approx 0.00095 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThis is much less than 1 hour, which suggests that with 2 staff members, waiting time is negligible.\n\nThis contradicts the current situation, suggesting that our assumption about current staffing is incorrect.\n\n### Step 21: Reevaluate Assumptions\n\nPerhaps the treatment rate per staff member is lower than 10 patients per hour.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that each doctor can see 10 patients per hour, and each nurse can assist to increase the doctor's capacity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the arrival rate is higher.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the ED operates for fewer hours per day.\n\nAssume the ED operates for 12 hours per day.\n\nThen, arrival rate \\( \\lambda = \\frac{250}{12} \\approx 20.83 \\) patients per hour.\n\nNow, with \\( \\mu = 10 \\) patients per hour per staff, and \\( c \\) staff members.\n\nUtilization factor \\( \\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{c\\mu} = \\frac{20.83}{10c} = \\frac{2.083}{c} \\)\n\n#### For \\( c = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ \\rho = \\frac{2.083}{2} = 1.0415 \\]\n\nAgain, \\( \\rho > 1 \\), so the queue is unstable.\n\n#### For \\( c = 3 \\):\n\n\\[ \\rho = \\frac{2.083}{3} \\approx 0.694 \\]\n\n\\[ W_q = \\frac{(0.694)^3}{3!(30 - 20.83)} \\times \\frac{1}{10(3 - 0.694)} \\]\n\n\\[ W_q = \\frac{0.339}{6 \\times 9.17} \\times \\frac{1}{10 \\times 2.306} \\]\n\n\\[ W_q = \\frac{0.339}{55.02} \\times \\frac{1}{23.06} \\]\n\n\\[ W_q \\approx 0.00616 \\times 0.0433 \\approx 0.000267 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThis is still much less than 1 hour.\n\nThis suggests that with 3 staff members, waiting time is very low, which contradicts the current waiting time of 90 minutes.\n\n### Step 22: Consider Separate Roles for Doctors and Nurses\n\nPerhaps doctors and nurses have different roles and treatment rates.\n\nAssume that doctors are the bottleneck.\n\nLet\u2019s say each doctor can see 10 patients per hour, and each nurse can assist multiple doctors.\n\nAssume that one nurse can assist two doctors.\n\nTherefore, for every two doctors, one nurse is needed.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\( d \\) = number of doctors\n- \\( n \\) = number of nurses, where \\( n = \\lceil \\frac{d}{2} \\rceil \\)\n\nTreatment rate per doctor: 10 patients per hour\n\nTotal treatment rate: \\( 10d \\) patients per hour\n\nArrival rate: \\( \\lambda = \\frac{250}{12} \\approx 20.83 \\) patients per hour\n\nUtilization factor: \\( \\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{10d} = \\frac{20.83}{10d} = \\frac{2.083}{d} \\)\n\n#### For \\( d = 3 \\):\n\n\\[ \\rho = \\frac{2.083}{3} \\approx 0.694 \\]\n\n\\[ W_q = \\frac{(0.694)^3}{3!(30 - 20.83)} \\times \\frac{1}{10(3 - 0.694)} \\]\n\n\\[ W_q = \\frac{0.339}{6 \\times 9.17} \\times \\frac{1}{10 \\times 2.306} \\]\n\n\\[ W_q = \\frac{0.339}{55.02} \\times \\frac{1}{23.06} \\]\n\n\\[ W_q \\approx 0.00616 \\times 0.0433 \\approx 0.000267 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nStill very low.\n\n### Step 23: Consider That Current Waiting Time is 90 Minutes\n\nGiven that current waiting time is 90 minutes (1.5 hours), and with \\( d = 3 \\), \\( W_q \\) is much less than 1 hour, which suggests that current staffing is less than 3 doctors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the treatment rate per doctor is lower than 10 patients per hour.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that each doctor can see 5 patients per hour instead of 10.\n\nThen, treatment rate per doctor: 5 patients per hour\n\nTotal treatment rate: \\( 5d \\) patients per hour\n\nUtilization factor: \\( \\rho = \\frac{20.83}{5d} = \\frac{4.166}{d} \\)\n\n#### For \\( d = 5 \\):\n\n\\[ \\rho = \\frac{4.166}{5} = 0.8332 \\]\n\n\\[ W_q = \\frac{(0.8332)^5}{5!(5 \\times 5 -
