        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There are 5 red balls, 4 blue balls, and 3 green balls in a room. I need to find the probability that if I pick two balls at random without replacement, both of them will be red. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of balls there are. So, 5 red plus 4 blue plus 3 green gives me a total of 12 balls. So, there are 12 balls in total.\n\nNow, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are the scenarios where both balls picked are red, and the total possible outcomes are all possible ways to pick any two balls from the 12 available.\n\nLet's start by figuring out the total number of ways to pick two balls from 12. Since the order doesn't matter (picking ball A first and then ball B is the same as picking ball B first and then ball A), this is a combination problem. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 balls from 12 is:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12!}{2!(12 - 2)!} = \\frac{12!}{2! \\times 10!}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the \\( 10! \\) in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 10!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{132}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 66 possible ways to pick any two balls from the 12 balls.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to pick two red balls from the 5 red balls available. Again, this is a combination problem.\n\n\\[\nC(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2! \\times 3!}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 2) = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 10 ways to pick two red balls from the 5 red balls.\n\nNow, the probability that both balls picked are red is the number of favorable outcomes (picking two red balls) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (picking any two balls from 12).\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both red}) = \\frac{C(5, 2)}{C(12, 2)} = \\frac{10}{66} = \\frac{5}{33}\n\\]\n\nWait, can I simplify that fraction further? Let's see. 10 divided by 2 is 5, and 66 divided by 2 is 33. So, yes, \\( \\frac{10}{66} \\) simplifies to \\( \\frac{5}{33} \\).\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this problem step by step, considering the probability of picking a red ball on the first draw and then another red ball on the second draw, without replacement.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball first is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{first red}) = \\frac{5}{12}\n\\]\n\nAfter picking one red ball, there are now 4 red balls left and a total of 11 balls remaining.\n\nSo, the probability of picking another red ball is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{second red} | \\text{first red}) = \\frac{4}{11}\n\\]\n\nThe conditional probability here means \"the probability of the second ball being red given that the first ball was red.\"\n\nTo find the overall probability of both events happening, I multiply these probabilities:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both red}) = P(\\text{first red}) \\times P(\\text{second red} | \\text{first red}) = \\frac{5}{12} \\times \\frac{4}{11} = \\frac{20}{132} = \\frac{5}{33}\n\\]\n\nAgain, I get \\( \\frac{5}{33} \\).\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like the probability that both balls picked are red is \\( \\frac{5}{33} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{33}} \\]"
