        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python script that connects to a PostgreSQL database, creates some tables for students, courses, and enrollments, inserts some sample data, and then runs a query to find all students enrolled in a specific course, displaying their names and enrollment dates. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I get all the parts right.\n\nFirst things first, I need to connect to a PostgreSQL database using Python. For that, I'll need the `psycopg2` library, which is a popular PostgreSQL adapter for Python. I should probably start by installing that if it's not already installed. I can do that using `pip install psycopg2`.\n\nOnce I have `psycopg2`, I need to establish a connection to my PostgreSQL database. I'll need the database name, user, password, and perhaps the host and port if they're not the defaults. I should keep these credentials safe, but for the sake of this script, I can hardcode them or maybe use environment variables for better security.\n\nSo, the connection part might look something like this:\n\n```python\nimport psycopg2\n\ntry:\n    connection = psycopg2.connect(\n        database=\"your_database\",\n        user=\"your_username\",\n        password=\"your_password\",\n        host=\"127.0.0.1\",\n        port=\"5432\"\n    )\n    print(\"Connected to the database\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\nNext, I need to create tables for students, courses, and enrollments. I should design the schema in a way that makes sense. Let's think about what each table should contain.\n\nFor the \"students\" table, I might have:\n\n- student_id: a unique identifier for each student (primary key)\n\n- first_name: the student's first name\n\n- last_name: the student's last name\n\n- Maybe other details like email or date of birth, but to keep it simple, I'll stick with first and last names.\n\nFor the \"courses\" table:\n\n- course_id: a unique identifier for each course (primary key)\n\n- course_name: the name of the course\n\n- Perhaps a description or other details, but again, keeping it simple.\n\nFor the \"enrollments\" table, which will link students to courses:\n\n- enrollment_id: a unique identifier for each enrollment (primary key)\n\n- student_id: foreign key referencing the students table\n\n- course_id: foreign key referencing the courses table\n\n- enrollment_date: the date when the student enrolled in the course\n\nI need to make sure that I define the foreign key constraints properly to maintain data integrity.\n\nSo, the SQL commands to create these tables might look like this:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE students (\n    student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    first_name VARCHAR(100),\n    last_name VARCHAR(100)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE courses (\n    course_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    course_name VARCHAR(100)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE enrollments (\n    enrollment_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    student_id INTEGER REFERENCES students(student_id),\n    course_id INTEGER REFERENCES courses(course_id),\n    enrollment_date DATE\n);\n```\n\nI'll need to execute these SQL commands using Python. I can do this by creating a cursor object and then executing the SQL commands.\n\nNow, for inserting sample data into these tables, I need to decide on some dummy data. Let's say I have a few students and a few courses, and some enrollments linking them together.\n\nFor example:\n\nStudents:\n\n1. John Doe\n\n2. Jane Smith\n\n3. Mike Johnson\n\nCourses:\n\n1. Mathematics\n\n2. Science\n\n3. History\n\nEnrollments:\n\n- John Doe enrolled in Mathematics on 2023-01-15\n\n- Jane Smith enrolled in Science on 2023-02-20\n\n- Mike Johnson enrolled in History on 2023-03-10\n\n- John Doe also enrolled in Science on 2023-02-01\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to write INSERT statements for these.\n\nFinally, the main part is to run a query that finds all students enrolled in a specific course and displays their names and enrollment dates. For this, I'll need to write a SQL query that joins the students, enrollments, and courses tables based on the course_id.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```sql\nSELECT students.first_name, students.last_name, enrollments.enrollment_date\nFROM students\nJOIN enrollments ON students.student_id = enrollments.student_id\nJOIN courses ON enrollments.course_id = courses.course_id\nWHERE courses.course_name = %s;\n```\n\nI'll need to parameterize the query to avoid SQL injection attacks, hence the `%s` placeholder.\n\nI should also think about error handling throughout the script. Database operations can fail for various reasons, like connection issues, SQL syntax errors, or integrity constraints being violated. It's important to catch these exceptions and handle them gracefully, perhaps by rolling back transactions if necessary.\n\nAlso, don't forget to close the database connection once all operations are done.\n\nAlright, let's start putting this all together step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll set up the connection to the database. I'll hardcode the credentials for now, but in a real-world scenario, I'd use environment variables or a configuration file.\n\nNext, I'll create the tables. I need to make sure that if the tables already exist, the script doesn't fail. Maybe I should include some logic to drop the tables if they exist, or at least check for their existence.\n\nThen, I'll insert the sample data. I need to be careful with the foreign key constraints; make sure that the student_id and course_id in enrollments correspond to existing records in students and courses.\n\nAfter that, I'll write the query to find students enrolled in a specific course. I'll prompt the user to input the course name or hardcode it for simplicity.\n\nLastly, I'll display the results.\n\nLet me sketch a rough structure of the script:\n\n1. Connect to the PostgreSQL database.\n\n2. Create the students, courses, and enrollments tables.\n\n3. Insert sample data into these tables.\n\n4. Ask the user for a course name or specify one.\n\n5. Run a query to find all students enrolled in that course.\n\n6. Display their names and enrollment dates.\n\n7. Handle any exceptions that may occur.\n\n8. Close the database connection.\n\nI should also think about committing the transactions after creating tables and inserting data. In `psycopg2`, by default, each SQL command is executed in its own transaction, so I need to commit them explicitly unless I'm using autocommit mode.\n\nWait, I think `psycopg2` allows setting autocommit to True, which would automatically commit each command without needing explicit commits. That might simplify things.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a transaction block with commit and rollback as needed.\n\nI need to decide on that.\n\nAlso, I should consider using the context manager (`with` statement) for handling the connection and cursor, as it ensures that resources are properly cleaned up.\n\nLet me look up how to use `psycopg2` with context managers.\n\nFrom the `psycopg2` documentation, I can see that both the connection and cursor objects support the context manager protocol.\n\nSo, I can do something like:\n\n```python\nwith psycopg2.connect(...) as conn:\n    with conn.cursor() as cur:\n        # execute SQL commands\n```\n\nThis way, the cursor and connection will be properly closed after exiting the blocks.\n\nThat's neat.\n\nNow, about creating tables. I need to make sure that if the tables already exist, I don't get an error. Maybe I can wrap the table creation commands in a DROP TABLE IF EXISTS statement.\n\nYes, that's a good idea.\n\nSo, for each table, I can do:\n\n```sql\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS enrollments;\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS students;\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS courses;\n```\n\nAnd then create the tables.\n\nBut I need to be careful with the order because of foreign key constraints. I should drop and create tables in an order that avoids constraint issues.\n\nProbably, drop courses first, then students, then enrollments, since enrollments references both students and courses.\n\nWait, no. Actually, since enrollments references both students and courses, I should drop enrollments first, then students and courses.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, when creating tables, I should create courses and students first, then enrollments.\n\nOkay.\n\nNow, for inserting data, I need to insert into courses and students first, so that I can get their IDs to insert into enrollments.\n\nOr, since I'm using SERIAL for IDs, I can insert into courses and students with just the names, and then retrieve the generated IDs to use in enrollments.\n\nIn `psycopg2`, after inserting a row with a SERIAL primary key, I can retrieve the generated ID using `cursor.fetchone()[0]` if I use `RETURNING student_id` in the INSERT statement.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\ncur.execute(\"INSERT INTO students(first_name, last_name) VALUES(%s, %s) RETURNING student_id;\", (first_name, last_name))\nstudent_id = cur.fetchone()[0]\n```\n\nThat way, I can capture the generated student_id and use it in the enrollments table.\n\nSame for course_id.\n\nAlright.\n\nSo, I need to insert sample data into students and courses, capture their IDs, and then use those IDs to insert into enrollments.\n\nLet me think about the sample data.\n\nLet's say I have the following students:\n\n1. John Doe\n\n2. Jane Smith\n\n3. Mike Johnson\n\nAnd courses:\n\n1. Mathematics\n\n2. Science\n\n3. History\n\nAnd enrollments:\n\n- John Doe in Mathematics on 2023-01-15\n\n- Jane Smith in Science on 2023-02-20\n\n- Mike Johnson in History on 2023-03-10\n\n- John Doe in Science on 2023-02-01\n\nI can structure my script to insert these rows accordingly.\n\nNow, for the query to find students enrolled in a specific course, I need to join the three tables and filter by the course name.\n\nI need to make sure that the course name is provided correctly and that it exists in the courses table.\n\nI can either hardcode the course name in the script or ask the user to input it.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll hardcode it for now, say \"Science\".\n\nThen, the query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT students.first_name, students.last_name, enrollments.enrollment_date\nFROM students\nJOIN enrollments ON students.student_id = enrollments.student_id\nJOIN courses ON enrollments.course_id = courses.course_id\nWHERE courses.course_name = %s;\n```\n\nAnd then execute it with the course name as a parameter.\n\nFinally, fetch and display the results.\n\nI should also handle cases where no students are enrolled in the course or if the course doesn't exist.\n\nAlright, I think I have a plan. Let's start writing the script.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo accomplish the task, we will create a Python script that interacts with a PostgreSQL database to manage students, courses, and enrollments. The script will connect to the database, create necessary tables, insert sample data, and query students enrolled in a specific course.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport psycopg2\nfrom psycopg2 import sql\n\n# Database connection parameters\ndb_params = {\n    \"database\": \"your_database\",\n    \"user\": \"your_username\",\n    \"password\": \"your_password\",\n    \"host\": \"127.0.0.1\",\n    \"port\": \"5432\"\n}\n\ndef connect():\n    try:\n        conn = psycopg2.connect(**db_params)\n        print(\"Connected to the database\")\n        return conn\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef create_tables(conn):\n    with conn.cursor() as cur:\n        # Drop tables if they exist\n        cur.execute(sql.SQL(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS enrollments;\"))\n        cur.execute(sql.SQL(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS students;\"))\n        cur.execute(sql.SQL(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS courses;\"))\n        \n        # Create courses table\n        cur.execute(sql.SQL(\"\"\"\n            CREATE TABLE courses (\n                course_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n                course_name VARCHAR(100)\n            );\n        \"\"\"))\n        \n        # Create students table\n        cur.execute(sql.SQL(\"\"\"\n            CREATE TABLE students (\n                student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n                first_name VARCHAR(100),\n                last_name VARCHAR(100)\n            );\n        \"\"\"))\n        \n        # Create enrollments table\n        cur.execute(sql.SQL(\"\"\"\n            CREATE TABLE enrollments (\n                enrollment_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n                student_id INTEGER REFERENCES students(student_id),\n                course_id INTEGER REFERENCES courses(course_id),\n                enrollment_date DATE\n            );\n        \"\"\"))\n        \n        conn.commit()\n        print(\"Tables created successfully\")\n\ndef insert_data(conn):\n    with conn.cursor() as cur:\n        # Insert sample courses\n        courses = [\"Mathematics\", \"Science\", \"History\"]\n        for course in courses:\n            cur.execute(sql.SQL(\"INSERT INTO courses(course_name) VALUES(%s) RETURNING course_id;\"), (course,))\n        \n        # Insert sample students\n        students = [\n            (\"John\", \"Doe\"),\n            (\"Jane\", \"Smith\"),\n            (\"Mike\", \"Johnson\")\n        ]\n        for first_name, last_name in students:\n            cur.execute(sql.SQL(\"INSERT INTO students(first_name, last_name) VALUES(%s, %s) RETURNING student_id;\"), (first_name, last_name,))\n        \n        # Insert sample enrollments\n        enrollments = [\n            (1, 1, \"2023-01-15\"),\n            (2, 2, \"2023-02-20\"),\n            (3, 3, \"2023-03-10\"),\n            (1, 2, \"2023-02-01\")\n        ]\n        for student_id, course_id, enrollment_date in enrollments:\n            cur.execute(sql.SQL(\"INSERT INTO enrollments(student_id, course_id, enrollment_date) VALUES(%s, %s, %s);\"), (student_id, course_id, enrollment_date,))\n        \n        conn.commit()\n        print(\"Sample data inserted successfully\")\n\ndef query_enrolled_students(conn, course_name):\n    with conn.cursor() as cur:\n        query = sql.SQL(\"\"\"\n            SELECT students.first_name, students.last_name, enrollments.enrollment_date\n            FROM students\n            JOIN enrollments ON students.student_id = enrollments.student_id\n            JOIN courses ON enrollments.course_id = courses.course_id\n            WHERE courses.course_name = %s;\n        \"\"\")\n        cur.execute(query, (course_name,))\n        results = cur.fetchall()\n        \n        if not results:\n            print(f\"No students enrolled in {course_name}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Students enrolled in {course_name}:\")\n            for row in results:\n                first_name, last_name, enrollment_date = row\n                print(f\"{first_name} {last_name}: enrolled on {enrollment_date}\")\n\ndef main():\n    conn = connect()\n    if conn:\n        create_tables(conn)\n        insert_data(conn)\n        course_name = \"Science\"  # Specify the course name here\n        query_enrolled_students(conn, course_name)\n        conn.close()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Connecting to the Database:**\n   - The `connect` function establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database using the provided credentials.\n\n2. **Creating Tables:**\n   - The `create_tables` function drops existing tables (if any) and creates new tables for courses, students, and enrollments.\n\n3. **Inserting Sample Data:**\n   - The `insert_data` function inserts sample data into the courses, students, and enrollments tables.\n\n4. **Querying Enrolled Students:**\n   - The `query_enrolled_students` function retrieves and displays students enrolled in a specified course.\n\n5. **Main Function:**\n   - The `main` function orchestrates the database operations and executes the necessary functions in sequence.\n\nThis script provides a comprehensive solution for managing student enrollments in a PostgreSQL database using Python."
