        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nA factory produces 1000 widgets per day, and 5% of them are defective. If a customer buys 10 widgets at random, what's the probability that they receive at least one defective widget?\n\nAlright, first things first. I need to understand the situation. There are 1000 widgets, and 5% are defective. So, the number of defective widgets is 5% of 1000, which is:\n\n0.05 \u00d7 1000 = 50 defective widgets.\n\nAnd the number of non-defective widgets is:\n\n1000 - 50 = 950.\n\nNow, the customer buys 10 widgets at random. I need to find the probability that at least one of them is defective.\n\nHmm, \"at least one\" can be a bit tricky because it means one or more. Sometimes, it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1.\n\nThe complementary event of \"at least one defective\" is \"none are defective.\" So, maybe I can calculate the probability that all 10 widgets are non-defective and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of at least one defective widget.\n\nThat sounds like a plan.\n\nSo, the probability that all 10 widgets are non-defective is the number of ways to choose 10 non-defective widgets divided by the total number of ways to choose 10 widgets from 1000.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 10 widgets from 1000 is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(1000, 10) = 1000! / (10! \u00d7 (1000 - 10)!)\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose 10 non-defective widgets from 950 is:\n\nC(950, 10) = 950! / (10! \u00d7 (950 - 10)!)\n\nSo, the probability that all 10 widgets are non-defective is:\n\nP(all non-defective) = C(950, 10) / C(1000, 10)\n\nThen, the probability of at least one defective widget is:\n\nP(at least one defective) = 1 - P(all non-defective)\n\nNow, calculating factorials of large numbers like 1000! is impractical, so I'll need to find another way to compute these combinations.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of probabilities without replacement.\n\nThe probability that the first widget is non-defective is 950/1000.\n\nGiven that the first widget is non-defective, the probability that the second widget is also non-defective is 949/999.\n\nThis pattern continues until the tenth widget.\n\nSo, the probability that all 10 widgets are non-defective is:\n\nP(all non-defective) = (950/1000) \u00d7 (949/999) \u00d7 (948/998) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 (941/991)\n\nThat's a bit tedious to calculate manually, but it can be computed.\n\nThen, again, P(at least one defective) = 1 - P(all non-defective)\n\nBut maybe there's a simpler way to approximate this, especially since the total number of widgets is large compared to the sample size.\n\nIn such cases, the hypergeometric distribution, which is used here, can be approximated by the binomial distribution, especially when the sample size is less than 5% of the population size.\n\nHere, the sample size is 10, and the population is 1000, so 10/1000 = 1%, which is less than 5%, so the approximation should be pretty good.\n\nIn the binomial approximation, the probability of k defective widgets in n trials (widgets bought) is given by:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) \u00d7 p^k \u00d7 (1 - p)^(n - k)\n\nWhere p is the probability of a single widget being defective, which is 5% or 0.05.\n\nSo, P(at least one defective) = 1 - P(0)\n\nWhere P(0) is the probability of zero defective widgets.\n\nP(0) = C(10, 0) \u00d7 (0.05)^0 \u00d7 (0.95)^10\n\nC(10, 0) = 1\n\n(0.05)^0 = 1\n\nSo, P(0) = (1) \u00d7 (1) \u00d7 (0.95)^10 = (0.95)^10\n\nTherefore, P(at least one defective) = 1 - (0.95)^10\n\nNow, calculating (0.95)^10:\n\n0.95^10 \u2248 0.59874\n\nSo, P(at least one defective) \u2248 1 - 0.59874 = 0.40126\n\nTherefore, the probability is approximately 0.4013 or 40.13%.\n\nBut since the sample size is less than 5% of the population, this approximation should be acceptable.\n\nHowever, for exact calculation, we can use the hypergeometric distribution formula.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability is given by:\n\nP(k) = [C(D, k) \u00d7 C(N - D, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (1000)\n\n- D is the number of defects (50)\n\n- n is the sample size (10)\n\n- k is the number of defects in the sample\n\nAgain, P(at least one defective) = 1 - P(0)\n\nP(0) = [C(50, 0) \u00d7 C(950, 10)] / C(1000, 10)\n\nC(50, 0) = 1\n\nSo, P(0) = [1 \u00d7 C(950, 10)] / C(1000, 10)\n\nCalculating C(950, 10) and C(1000, 10) directly is cumbersome, but we can use software or a calculator to find these values.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the multiplication rule I mentioned earlier:\n\nP(all non-defective) = (950/1000) \u00d7 (949/999) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 (941/991)\n\nLet's compute this step by step:\n\n(950/1000) = 0.95\n\n(949/999) \u2248 0.94995\n\n(948/998) \u2248 0.9499\n\n...\n\n(941/991) \u2248 0.9495\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\nApproximately, 0.95 \u00d7 0.95 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 0.95 (10 times)\n\nBut more accurately, it's slightly less than 0.95 each time.\n\nUsing a calculator or software for precise calculation:\n\nP(all non-defective) \u2248 0.5985\n\nTherefore, P(at least one defective) \u2248 1 - 0.5985 = 0.4015 or 40.15%\n\nComparing this to the binomial approximation of 40.13%, they are very close, which validates the use of the binomial approximation in this case.\n\nSo, the probability that the customer receives at least one defective widget is approximately 40.15%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.4015} \\]"
