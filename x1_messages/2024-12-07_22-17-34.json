The landscape, lover's lexicon vast,\n\nWhere laughter lingers, and laments are cast.\n\nIn letters lost, love's lamentations rise,\n\nLike lullabies, in languid lull of night.\n\nOh, love's labyrinth, where longing lies in wait,\n\nEach laugh, a lament, each light step, a fate.\n\nSo, lovers learn, in life's large library,\n\nTo love, to lose, to laugh, and let it be.\n\nFor in the end, love's lesson lightly falls:\n\nLife's love is lent, and laughter's last appeal."
