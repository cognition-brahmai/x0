        "content": "Let's see. So, the bacteria population doubles every 3 hours, and we want to know how many times it will double in one week. Okay, first things first, I need to figure out how many hours there are in a week.\n\nI know that:\n\n- There are 24 hours in a day.\n\n- There are 7 days in a week.\n\nSo, total hours in a week would be 24 hours/day * 7 days = 168 hours.\n\nNow, the bacteria doubles every 3 hours. So, to find out how many times it doubles in 168 hours, I should divide the total hours by the doubling time.\n\nSo, number of doublings = total hours / doubling time = 168 hours / 3 hours/doubling.\n\nLet me do the math: 168 divided by 3 is 56.\n\nSo, the bacteria population will double 56 times in one week.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\n24 hours in a day times 7 days is indeed 168 hours.\n\nAnd dividing 168 by 3 does give 56.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let's think about it another way.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate how many 3-hour periods there are in a week.\n\nSince there are 168 hours in a week, and each period is 3 hours, then the number of periods is 168 / 3 = 56.\n\nSo, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of days.\n\nThere are 24 hours in a day, so in one day, the number of 3-hour periods is 24 / 3 = 8.\n\nTherefore, in one day, the bacteria doubles 8 times.\n\nOver 7 days, it would double 8 times/day * 7 days = 56 times.\n\nAgain, that's the same answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nThe question is: \"how many times will it double in one week?\"\n\nGiven that it doubles every 3 hours, and there are 168 hours in a week, dividing 168 by 3 gives 56.\n\nSo, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider whether the starting point counts as a doubling.\n\nFor example, at time t=0, the population is P, and then it doubles every 3 hours.\n\nSo, at t=3 hours, it's 2P; at t=6 hours, it's 4P, and so on.\n\nIn this case, each doubling period is 3 hours, and over 168 hours, there are 56 such periods.\n\nTherefore, the population will double 56 times in one week.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{56} \\]"
