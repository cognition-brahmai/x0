        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains here, one leaving Station A at 10:00 AM going east at 80 mph, and another leaving Station B at 11:00 AM going west at 60 mph. The distance between Station A and Station B is 300 miles. I need to find out when these two trains will meet.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the situation. Station A and Station B are 300 miles apart. Train from A is going east at 80 mph, and train from B is going west at 60 mph, starting an hour later.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up relative to each other. So, the relative speed is 80 + 60 = 140 mph.\n\nBut wait, the second train starts an hour later. So, in that one hour, the first train has already covered some distance.\n\nLet me calculate how far the first train has traveled by 11:00 AM.\n\nFrom 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM is one hour. At 80 mph, it covers 80 miles in that hour.\n\nSo, by 11:00 AM, the first train is 80 miles east of Station A.\n\nNow, the second train leaves Station B at 11:00 AM going west at 60 mph.\n\nAt 11:00 AM, the distance between the two trains is 300 miles minus the 80 miles the first train has already covered, which is 220 miles.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other starting at 11:00 AM, with a combined speed of 140 mph.\n\nTo find the time it takes for them to cover the 220 miles between them, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, Time = 220 miles / 140 mph = 1.5714 hours.\n\nThat's approximately 1 hour and 34.286 minutes.\n\nSo, if they start at 11:00 AM, adding 1 hour and 34.286 minutes to that time would give us the meeting time.\n\n11:00 AM + 1 hour = 12:00 PM.\n\nPlus 34.286 minutes is approximately 34 minutes.\n\nSo, the trains will meet around 12:34 PM.\n\nBut let me check if this is exact.\n\n1.5714 hours is exactly 1 hour and 34.286 minutes.\n\nTo be more precise, 0.5714 hours is 0.5714 * 60 minutes = 34.286 minutes.\n\nSo, it's 1 hour and 34.286 minutes, which we can round to 12:34 PM.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should use fractions for more accuracy.\n\n220 miles / 140 mph = 11/7 hours.\n\n11/7 hours is 1 hour and 4/7 hours.\n\n4/7 hours is (4/7)*60 minutes = approximately 34.2857 minutes.\n\nSo, still, 12:34 PM.\n\nTherefore, the two trains will meet at approximately 12:34 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12:34 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
