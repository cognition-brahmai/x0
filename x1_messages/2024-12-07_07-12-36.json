        "content": "So I have 20 candies, and I want to give 2 candies to each of my friends. I need to figure out how many friends I can share my candies with. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have a total of 20 candies, and I'm giving away 2 candies to each friend. So, I need to find out how many friends can receive these 2 candies each.\n\nThis seems like a division problem because I'm dividing the total number of candies by the number of candies per friend. So, I should divide 20 by 2.\n\nLet me write that down: 20 \u00f7 2.\n\nNow, 20 divided by 2 is 10. So, that means I can share my candies with 10 friends, giving each 2 candies.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If I have 10 friends and each gets 2 candies, then 10 times 2 is 20, which matches the total number of candies I have. So, that makes sense.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using subtraction. I could keep subtracting 2 candies for each friend until I run out.\n\nLet's see:\n\nStart with 20 candies.\n\nGive 2 to the first friend: 20 - 2 = 18.\n\nGive 2 to the second friend: 18 - 2 = 16.\n\nContinue this process:\n\nThird friend: 16 - 2 = 14.\n\nFourth: 14 - 2 = 12.\n\nFifth: 12 - 2 = 10.\n\nSixth: 10 - 2 = 8.\n\nSeventh: 8 - 2 = 6.\n\nEighth: 6 - 2 = 4.\n\nNinth: 4 - 2 = 2.\n\nTenth: 2 - 2 = 0.\n\nOkay, so after giving 2 candies to the tenth friend, I have no candies left. So, again, that suggests I can share with 10 friends.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider how many 2-candy portions are there in 20 candies. That's again a division problem: 20 \u00f7 2 = 10.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of multiplication. If each friend gets 2 candies, and I want to find out how many friends can get those 2 candies from a total of 20, I can set up the equation:\n\nNumber of friends \u00d7 2 candies per friend = 20 candies.\n\nSo, number of friends = 20 \u00f7 2 = 10.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same answer: 10 friends.\n\nIs there any other scenario I should consider? For example, what if I have some candies left over? But in this case, since 20 is perfectly divisible by 2, there are no candies left over.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm not misinterpreting the problem. The question says \"give away 2 candies to each friend.\" It doesn't say \"at least 2 candies to each friend,\" so I don't need to consider giving more than 2 to any friend.\n\nAdditionally, I should assume that I can't give a fraction of a candy, so I need to give whole candies.\n\nGiven that, my answer remains 10 friends.\n\nLet me consider if there are any constraints I'm not aware of. For example, maybe I can't give candies to more than a certain number of friends, but the problem doesn't specify any such constraints.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, I can conclude that I can share my 20 candies with 10 friends, giving each 2 candies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
