        "content": "Let's see. I have $10 and I want to buy exactly 5 pieces of fruit, which include apples and oranges. Apples cost $1.50 each, and oranges cost $1.00 each. I need to figure out how many of each I can buy without exceeding my $10.\n\nFirst, let's denote the number of apples as A and the number of oranges as O. We have two main constraints:\n\n1. The total number of fruits is 5: A + O = 5\n\n2. The total cost is less than or equal to $10: 1.5A + 1O \u2264 10\n\nI need to find non-negative integer values for A and O that satisfy both equations.\n\nFrom the first equation, I can express O in terms of A: O = 5 - A\n\nNow, substitute O in the second equation:\n\n1.5A + 1(5 - A) \u2264 10\n\nSimplify that:\n\n1.5A + 5 - A \u2264 10\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n0.5A + 5 \u2264 10\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n\n0.5A \u2264 5\n\nDivide both sides by 0.5:\n\nA \u2264 10\n\nBut wait, A cannot be more than 5 because I'm only buying 5 fruits in total. So A can be from 0 to 5.\n\nLet me list out the possible values for A and O and check which ones satisfy the cost constraint.\n\nOption 1: A = 0, O = 5\n\nCost: 1.5(0) + 1(5) = 0 + 5 = $5 \u2264 $10 \u2192 valid\n\nOption 2: A = 1, O = 4\n\nCost: 1.5(1) + 1(4) = 1.5 + 4 = $5.5 \u2264 $10 \u2192 valid\n\nOption 3: A = 2, O = 3\n\nCost: 1.5(2) + 1(3) = 3 + 3 = $6 \u2264 $10 \u2192 valid\n\nOption 4: A = 3, O = 2\n\nCost: 1.5(3) + 1(2) = 4.5 + 2 = $6.5 \u2264 $10 \u2192 valid\n\nOption 5: A = 4, O = 1\n\nCost: 1.5(4) + 1(1) = 6 + 1 = $7 \u2264 $10 \u2192 valid\n\nOption 6: A = 5, O = 0\n\nCost: 1.5(5) + 1(0) = 7.5 + 0 = $7.5 \u2264 $10 \u2192 valid\n\nSo all options from 0 to 5 apples are valid, as long as the total number of fruits is 5 and the total cost does not exceed $10.\n\nBut the question is: how many apples and oranges can you buy? It seems like there are multiple solutions here. Maybe I need to find all possible combinations.\n\nLet's list them out:\n\n1. 0 apples and 5 oranges, costing $5\n\n2. 1 apple and 4 oranges, costing $5.5\n\n3. 2 apples and 3 oranges, costing $6\n\n4. 3 apples and 2 oranges, costing $6.5\n\n5. 4 apples and 1 orange, costing $7\n\n6. 5 apples and 0 oranges, costing $7.5\n\nAll of these options are within the $10 budget. So, depending on personal preference, any of these combinations would work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for a specific combination, but it's not specified. Perhaps I need to maximize the number of apples or something like that, but it doesn't say.\n\nWait, maybe the question is to spend exactly $10, not less than or equal to $10. The wording says \"you have a $10 bill,\" which might imply that you need to spend the entire amount.\n\nLet me check that possibility.\n\nSo, if I need to spend exactly $10, then the equation would be:\n\n1.5A + 1O = 10\n\nWith A + O = 5\n\nI can solve these two equations simultaneously.\n\nFrom the first equation: O = 5 - A\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\n1.5A + 1(5 - A) = 10\n\nSimplify:\n\n1.5A + 5 - A = 10\n\n0.5A + 5 = 10\n\n0.5A = 5\n\nA = 10\n\nBut A cannot be 10 because A + O = 5, so A cannot exceed 5.\n\nThis suggests that there is no solution where you spend exactly $10 while buying exactly 5 fruits.\n\nTherefore, the initial interpretation is correct: you can buy any combination of apples and oranges that adds up to 5 fruits, as long as the total cost is less than or equal to $10.\n\nGiven that, all the combinations listed earlier are valid.\n\nSo, to answer the question: you can buy any combination of apples and oranges that totals 5 fruits, and the cost will be within $10.\n\nFor example, you could buy 0 apples and 5 oranges, costing $5.\n\nOr 1 apple and 4 oranges, costing $5.5.\n\nAnd so on, up to 5 apples and 0 oranges, costing $7.5.\n\nAll these options are acceptable based on the given constraints.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Any combination of apples and oranges totaling 5 fruits, with the total cost not exceeding \\$10.}}\\]"
