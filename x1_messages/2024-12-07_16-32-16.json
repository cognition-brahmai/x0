        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 200 units of product A and 300 units of product B each day. Product A needs 4 hours of labor per unit, and product B needs 6 hours per unit. I need to find out the total hours of labor required for production in one week.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the daily labor hours for each product and then sum them up to get the total daily labor hours. After that, I can multiply the total daily labor hours by the number of days in a week to get the weekly labor hours.\n\nSo, for product A:\n\n200 units/day * 4 hours/unit = 800 hours/day\n\nFor product B:\n\n300 units/day * 6 hours/unit = 1800 hours/day\n\nNow, total daily labor hours:\n\n800 hours/day (for A) + 1800 hours/day (for B) = 2600 hours/day\n\nAssuming the factory operates 7 days a week, the total weekly labor hours would be:\n\n2600 hours/day * 7 days/week = 18,200 hours/week\n\nWait a minute, but some factories might not operate on weekends. If the factory only operates on weekdays, that would be 5 days a week.\n\nSo, if it's 5 days a week:\n\n2600 hours/day * 5 days/week = 13,000 hours/week\n\nI should check if there's any information about the number of operating days in a week. The question doesn't specify, so maybe I should assume a standard 5-day workweek.\n\nBut to cover all bases, I can calculate for both scenarios.\n\nFor a 5-day workweek:\n\n2600 hours/day * 5 days = 13,000 hours\n\nFor a 7-day workweek:\n\n2600 hours/day * 7 days = 18,200 hours\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question implies a different number of days. Maybe I should ask for clarification.\n\nBut since it's a factory, it might operate on weekends as well. Maybe it's a continuous operation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the standard is different. In many places, factories operate 6 days a week.\n\nIf it's 6 days a week:\n\n2600 hours/day * 6 days = 15,600 hours\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the week is considered to be 40 hours, but that seems unlikely since the daily hours are already calculated based on units produced.\n\nWait, but 2600 hours per day is way more than 40 hours. 40 hours is a standard workweek for an employee, but in a factory, there might be multiple shifts, so total labor hours can exceed 40 per week.\n\nPerhaps the question expects a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"each day\" refers to a standard workday, and the factory doesn't operate on weekends.\n\nBut to be comprehensive, I think I should consider both scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the total labor hours required for one week of production, assuming production happens every day of the week.\n\nIn that case, it would be 2600 hours/day * 7 days = 18,200 hours.\n\nHowever, if the factory only operates on weekdays, it would be 2600 hours/day * 5 days = 13,000 hours.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should mention both possibilities in my answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes a standard 5-day workweek.\n\nIn that case, the total weekly labor hours would be 13,000 hours.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider that some factories operate on weekends as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question doesn't specify the number of workdays in a week, so maybe I should assume a 7-day operation.\n\nIn that case, the total would be 18,200 hours.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should ask for clarification on the number of operating days per week.\n\nBut since it's a multiple-choice question, maybe I can look at the options to see which one fits.\n\nWait, the question didn't provide options. I assume it's an open-ended question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's part of a larger question with given options, but in this case, it's presented as a standalone question.\n\nGiven that, I think the safest approach is to assume a 7-day operation, as factories often operate continuously.\n\nTherefore, total weekly labor hours would be 2600 hours/day * 7 days = 18,200 hours.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there are holidays or downtime, but the question doesn't mention any, so I'll proceed with 18,200 hours.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard industry practice, but as I don't have that information, I'll stick with the calculation based on the given data.\n\nTherefore, the total hours of labor required for production in one week is 18,200 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18200} \\]"
