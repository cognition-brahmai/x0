        "content": "So the farmer has 5 chickens, and each chicken lays 2 eggs every day. We need to find out how many eggs the farmer will collect in a month, assuming the month has 30 days.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many eggs are laid per day by all the chickens together. Since each chicken lays 2 eggs daily, and there are 5 chickens, we can multiply the number of chickens by the eggs each lays per day:\n\n5 chickens * 2 eggs/chicken/day = 10 eggs/day\n\nSo, the farmer gets 10 eggs every day.\n\nNow, to find out the total for 30 days, we'll multiply the daily amount by the number of days:\n\n10 eggs/day * 30 days = 300 eggs\n\nTherefore, the farmer will collect 300 eggs in a month.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's think if there's anything else we should consider. For example, are there any chickens that might not lay eggs every day? Or maybe some eggs get broken. But according to the problem, each chicken lays 2 eggs every day, and there's no mention of any eggs being unusable or lost. So, we can stick with the calculation.\n\nAlso, we assumed that a month has exactly 30 days, as instructed. In reality, months have varying numbers of days, but since the problem specifies 30 days, we'll go with that.\n\nSo, the final answer is 300 eggs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
