It is useful for finding sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts text from a webpage given its URL. The input should be a single link and the output will be plain text content of the page.\nLinkPicker[input]: Picks the most relevant links from a list of URLs based on the input query.\nAnswerBot[input]: A tool that answers questions based on an input passage of text.

        "content": "Alright, I need to find out who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what their most famous work is. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably look up who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020. I can use the WebSearch tool for that. So, I'll search for \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner.\"\n\nOnce I have the name of the winner, I need to find out their most famous work. For that, I might need to look up more information about them. Maybe another web search or find a biography or list of their works.\n\nLet me plan this out.\n\nPlan: Search the web to find out who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020.\n\n#E1 = WebSearch[\"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner\"]\n\nPlan: Once I have the name from #E1, I can search for their most famous work.\n\n#E2 = WebSearch[\"{winner's name} most famous work\"]\n\nAlternatively, I could find a biography or a list of their works to determine which one is the most famous.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way. Maybe the initial search result in #E1 already includes information about their notable works. I should check that first before doing another search.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nPlan: Search the web to find out who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and look for information about their notable works.\n\n#E1 = WebSearch[\"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner and their works\"]\n\nThen, from the results in #E1, I can extract the name and the most famous work.\n\nBut, I'm not sure if the WebSearch tool provides detailed information like that. Maybe I need to extract text from a specific webpage.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the AnswerBot tool to extract the information from the search results.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nPlan: Search the web to find the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020.\n\n#E1 = WebSearch[\"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner\"]\n\nThen, pick the most relevant link from the search results.\n\n#E2 = LinkPicker[#E1]\n\nNext, extract the text from that webpage.\n\n#E3 = TextExtractor[#E2]\n\nFinally, use AnswerBot to answer who the winner is and their most famous work based on the extracted text.\n\n#E4 = AnswerBot[\"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what is their most famous work? Given #E3\"]\n\nThis seems more systematic. Let's outline it:\n\n1. Use WebSearch to find the winner.\n\n2. Use LinkPicker to select the most relevant link from the search results.\n\n3. Use TextExtractor to get the text from that link.\n\n4. Use AnswerBot to answer the question based on the extracted text.\n\nThis should give me the information I need.\n\nAlternatively, I could use AnswerBot directly on the search results, but it might not be as accurate.\n\nWait, maybe I can combine some steps.\n\nPlan: Search the web for \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner.\"\n\n#E1 = WebSearch[\"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner\"]\n\nThen, use AnswerBot to extract the winner's name from the search results.\n\n#E2 = AnswerBot[\"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020? Given #E1\"]\n\nNext, search the web for the winner's name and \"most famous work.\"\n\n#E3 = WebSearch[\"{winner's name} most famous work\"]\n\nThen, use AnswerBot to extract the most famous work from these search results.\n\n#E4 = AnswerBot[\"What is the most famous work of {winner's name}? Given #E3\"]\n\nFinally, combine the winner's name and their most famous work in the final answer.\n\n#E5 = AnswerBot[\"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what is their most famous work? Given #E2 and #E4\"]\n\nThis seems a bit redundant, though. Maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nLet me consider that the initial web search might provide both the winner's name and their notable works. So, perhaps I can extract both pieces of information in one go.\n\nPlan: Search the web for \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner and their works.\"\n\n#E1 = WebSearch[\"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner and their works\"]\n\nThen, use AnswerBot to extract both the winner's name and their most famous work from the search results.\n\n#E2 = AnswerBot[\"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what is their most famous work? Given #E1\"]\n\nThis simplifies the process. If #E1 provides sufficient information, this should work.\n\nBut, to ensure accuracy, maybe I should first find the winner's name and then separately find their most famous work.\n\nPlan: Search the web for \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner.\"\n\n#E1 = WebSearch[\"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner\"]\n\nThen, use AnswerBot to extract the winner's name.\n\n#E2 = AnswerBot[\"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020? Given #E1\"]\n\nNext, search the web for \"{winner's name} most famous work.\"\n\n#E3 = WebSearch[\"{winner's name} most famous work\"]\n\nThen, use AnswerBot to extract the most famous work.\n\n#E4 = AnswerBot[\"What is the most famous work of {winner's name}? Given #E3\"]\n\nFinally, combine the information.\n\n#E5 = AnswerBot[\"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what is their most famous work? Given #E2 and #E4\"]\n\nThis seems thorough. Let's proceed with this plan.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo answer the question \"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what is their most famous work?\", follow this step-by-step plan using the provided tools.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Search for the Nobel Prize in Literature Winner in 2020:**\n   - Use the `WebSearch` tool to find out who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020.\n   - Input: `\"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner\"`\n\n2. **Extract the Winner's Name:**\n   - Use the `AnswerBot` tool to extract the winner's name from the search results.\n   - Input: `\"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020?
