        "content": "Let's see. I start with 6 apples in my basket. So, the first thing I do is give half of them to my friend. Half of 6 is 3, right? So, I give 3 apples to my friend. That means I have 6 minus 3, which is 3 apples left.\n\nThen, I eat one of the remaining apples. So, I had 3 apples and I eat one, that leaves me with 2 apples.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I started with 6, gave half away, which is 3, so 6 - 3 = 3. Then I eat one, so 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nYeah, that seems correct. So, I have 2 apples left.\n\nBut maybe I should think about this differently. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAnother way: I start with 6 apples. I give half to my friend, which is 3 apples, so I have 3 left. Then I eat one, so that's 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes in math problems, the wording can be tricky, but in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other interpretation. For example, does \"half of them\" mean exactly half, or could it be something else? In normal language, half means exactly half, so 6 divided by 2 is 3.\n\nOkay, so no ambiguity there.\n\nNow, after giving away 3 apples, I have 3 left. Then, I eat one of those 3. Eating one should reduce the number by one, so 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nIs there any chance that more apples are involved? For example, maybe the apples I gave to my friend somehow come back, or maybe I get more apples from somewhere else. But according to the problem, that's not the case. It's just giving away half and then eating one.\n\nSo, no, that doesn't apply here.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the apples I have left include the ones I ate. But no, eating an apple means consuming it, so it's no longer in my possession.\n\nTherefore, I started with 6, gave away 3, had 3 left, ate 1, so now I have 2 left.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
