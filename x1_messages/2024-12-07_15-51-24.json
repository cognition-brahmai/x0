        "content": "So, I have this problem here: If a bottle holds 2 liters of water, and you pour out half of its contents, how much water is left in the bottle? And I need to explain my thought process.\n\nAlright, let's start with what we know. The bottle initially holds 2 liters of water. That seems straightforward. Now, the action being taken is pouring out half of its contents. So, I need to find out how much water is left after pouring out half.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"half of its contents\" means. Since the bottle has 2 liters, half of that would be 2 liters divided by 2, which is 1 liter. So, pouring out half means removing 1 liter from the original 2 liters.\n\nNow, to find out how much is left, I subtract the amount poured out from the initial amount. That is, 2 liters minus 1 liter, which equals 1 liter.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using fractions or percentages. Let's see.\n\nIf the bottle holds 2 liters and I pour out half, that's the same as pouring out 50% of the contents. So, 50% of 2 liters is 1 liter, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of fractions. Half is 1/2, so 1/2 of 2 liters is 1 liter.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same conclusion: 1 liter is left in the bottle after pouring out half of its contents.\n\nBut let's double-check. If I have 2 liters and I pour out 1 liter, yes, that leaves 1 liter. Seems straightforward.\n\nIs there any chance that the bottle could still have more or less than 1 liter left? For example, if the bottle had some water stuck to the sides or something like that, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It seems like a straightforward volume subtraction.\n\nAlso, I should consider if \"pouring out half of its contents\" means exactly half, or if there's any ambiguity. The problem says \"half,\" which typically means exactly 50%. So, no ambiguity there.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the units. The initial amount is given in liters, and the answer should also be in liters unless specified otherwise. Since the question asks \"how much water is left in the bottle,\" and the initial measurement is in liters, it's safe to assume the answer should be in liters as well.\n\nSo, to sum it up, starting with 2 liters and pouring out half, which is 1 liter, leaves 1 liter in the bottle.\n\nFinal answer: 1 liter.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
