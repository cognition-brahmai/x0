The reference to \"ink of the deep sea\" is a nod to his use of dark colors for skies and oceans, while \"brushstrokes of waves, soft and slow\" reflects his gentle and methodical painting techniques. The last line, \"Nature's canvas free,\" echoes his philosophy of allowing nature to be the guide in artistic expression."
