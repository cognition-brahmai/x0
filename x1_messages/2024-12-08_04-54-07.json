        "content": "Alright, I'm going to guide you through creating a web scraper using Puppeteer in JavaScript to extract job listings from a popular job board website. We'll make sure it accepts a keyword and location as input and saves the extracted data in JSON format.\n\nFirst, you need to set up your environment:\n\n1. **Install Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).\n\n2. **Set up a new project**:\n   - Create a new directory for your project.\n   - Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.\n   - Run `npm init -y` to create a `package.json` file.\n\n3. **Install Puppeteer**:\n   - Run `npm install puppeteer` to install the Puppeteer library.\n\nNow, let's create the scraper:\n\n1. **Create a new JavaScript file**:\n   - Create a file named `scraper.js` in your project directory.\n\n2. **Set up Puppeteer**:\n   - Import Puppeteer and set up the browser and page.\n\n3. **Handle inputs**:\n   - Accept keyword and location as command-line arguments.\n\n4. **Navigate to the job board**:\n   - Use Puppeteer to navigate to the job board website.\n   - Input the keyword and location into the search fields.\n   - Submit the search form.\n\n5. **Extract job listings**:\n   - Wait for the job listings to load.\n   - Extract relevant data such as job title, company, location, and description.\n\n6. **Save data to JSON**:\n   - Collect the extracted data into an array of objects.\n   - Write the array to a JSON file.\n\nHere's a step-by-step code example:\n\n```javascript\nconst puppeteer = require('puppeteer');\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\n// Function to scrape job listings\nasync function scrapeJobs(keyword, location) {\n  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: true });\n  const page = await browser.newPage();\n\n  // Navigate to the job board website\n  await page.goto('https://www.indeed.com/');\n\n  // Input keyword and location\n  await page.type('#text-input-what', keyword);\n  await page.type('#text-input-where', location);\n\n  // Click the search button\n  await page.click('.yosegi-InlineWhatWhere-primaryButton');\n\n  // Wait for job listings to load\n  await page.waitForSelector('.jobsearch-SerpJobCard');\n\n  // Extract job listings\n  const jobs = await page.evaluate(() => {\n    const jobCards = document.querySelectorAll('.jobsearch-SerpJobCard');\n    const jobList = [];\n\n    jobCards.forEach(card => {\n      const title = card.querySelector('.title > a').innerText.trim();\n      const company = card.querySelector('.company').innerText.trim();\n      const location = card.querySelector('.location').innerText.trim();\n      const summary = card.querySelector('.summary').innerText.trim();\n\n      jobList.push({\n        title,\n        company,\n        location,\n        summary\n      });\n    });\n\n    return jobList;\n  });\n\n  // Save to JSON file\n  fs.writeFileSync('jobs.json', JSON.stringify(jobs, null, 2));\n  console.log(`Scraped ${jobs.length} jobs and saved to jobs.json`);\n\n  await browser.close();\n}\n\n// Get keyword and location from command-line arguments\nconst keyword = process.argv[2];\nconst location = process.argv[3];\n\nif (!keyword || !location) {\n  console.log('Usage: node scraper.js \"keyword\" \"location\"');\n  process.exit(1);\n}\n\nscrapeJobs(keyword, location);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Setting up Puppeteer**:\n   - Launch a headless browser and create a new page.\n\n2. **Navigating to the job board**:\n   - Go to Indeed.com.\n   - Input the keyword and location into the search fields.\n   - Click the search button.\n\n3. **Extracting job listings**:\n   - Wait for the job listings to load.\n   - Use `page.evaluate` to extract job titles, companies, locations, and summaries.\n\n4. **Saving data to JSON**:\n   - Collect the extracted data into an array.\n   - Write the array to a `jobs.json` file.\n\n### Running the scraper:\n\n1. **Save the code** to `scraper.js`.\n\n2. **Run the scraper** from the terminal:\n   ```sh\n   node scraper.js \"software engineer\" \"New York\"\n   ```\n\nThis will scrape job listings for \"software engineer\" in \"New York\" and save the results to `jobs.json`.\n\n### Notes:\n\n- **Headless mode**: Puppeteer runs in headless mode by default. Set `headless: false` to see the browser window.\n\n- **Error handling**: Add try-catch blocks for better error handling.\n\n- **Pagination**: Implement pagination to scrape multiple pages.\n\n- **Respect website terms**: Ensure that web scraping complies with the website's `robots.txt` and terms of service.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point for your job scraper.
