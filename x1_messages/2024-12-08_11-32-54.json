To find out how many seconds are in a leap year, we need to calculate the total number of seconds in 366 days.\n\nFirst, let's recall that:\n\n- 1 minute = 60 seconds\n\n- 1 hour = 60 minutes = 3,600 seconds\n\n- 1 day = 24 hours = 86,400 seconds\n\nSo, for 366 days, the total number of seconds would be:\n\n366 days * 86,400 seconds/day\n\nLet's do the multiplication:\n\n366 * 86,400 = 31,622,400 seconds\n\nTherefore, there are 31,622,400 seconds in a leap year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{31622400} \\]"
