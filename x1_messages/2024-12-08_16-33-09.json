        "content": "So in this village, every person has either a cat or a dog as a pet. There are 50 cats and 30 dogs. I need to find out how many people live in the village.\n\nFirst, I should consider that each person has one pet, right? So, if someone has a cat, they don't have a dog, and vice versa. That means the total number of pets should equal the total number of people.\n\nSo, if there are 50 cats and 30 dogs, the total number of pets is 50 plus 30, which is 80. Therefore, there are 80 people in the village.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe some people have more than one pet. The problem says \"either a cat or a dog,\" but perhaps some people have both a cat and a dog.\n\nHmm. The problem states that every person has either a cat or a dog as a pet, implying that each person has one pet, either a cat or a dog, but not both.\n\nSo, in that case, the total number of people should be the sum of the number of cat owners and dog owners.\n\nGiven that there are 50 cats and 30 dogs, and assuming that each cat and each dog has one owner, then the total number of people is 50 plus 30, which is 80.\n\nBut let's think about it differently. Maybe some cats or dogs are owned by the same person. For example, one person has two cats, or one cat and one dog.\n\nWait, but the problem says every person has either a cat or a dog as a pet. It doesn't mention multiple pets per person. So, probably, each person has only one pet.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people is equal to the total number of pets, which is 50 cats plus 30 dogs, equaling 80 people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me by giving the number of cats and dogs separately, but in reality, some people might have multiple pets, but based on the information given, it seems that each person has only one pet.\n\nSo, my final answer is that there are 80 people in the village.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
