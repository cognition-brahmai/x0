        "content": "Let's tackle this house coloring problem step by step. So, we've got 5 houses in a row, each to be painted either red, blue, or green. The constraints are that no two adjacent houses can have the same color, and importantly, the first and last houses can't both be red. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many ways to color the houses without considering the condition about the first and last houses both being red. Then, I'll account for that condition separately.\n\nSo, starting with the basic scenario where no two adjacent houses have the same color. For the first house, there are 3 choices: red, blue, or green. For the second house, since it can't be the same color as the first, there are 2 choices. Similarly, each subsequent house has 2 choices, as it can't match the color of the house immediately before it.\n\nSo, for 5 houses, the total number of colorings without any other constraints would be:\n\n3 (for the first house) \u00d7 2 (for the second) \u00d7 2 (for the third) \u00d7 2 (for the fourth) \u00d7 2 (for the fifth) = 3 \u00d7 2^4 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48.\n\nBut wait, we have that additional condition: the first and last houses cannot both be red. So, I need to subtract the number of arrangements where both the first and last houses are red from the total above.\n\nLet's calculate the number of arrangements where both the first and fifth houses are red.\n\nIf the first house is red, then the second house can be either blue or green (2 choices). The third house can't be the same as the second, so again 2 choices. The fourth house can't be the same as the third, so 2 choices again. Finally, the fifth house must be red, as per this specific case.\n\nSo, the number of such arrangements is:\n\n1 (first house red) \u00d7 2 (second house) \u00d7 2 (third house) \u00d7 2 (fourth house) \u00d7 1 (fifth house red) = 1 \u00d7 2^3 \u00d7 1 = 8.\n\nTherefore, the total number of valid arrangements is the total without the restriction minus the invalid cases where both first and last are red:\n\n48 - 8 = 40.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider two separate cases:\n\n1. The first house is not red.\n\n2. The first house is red, but the last house is not red.\n\nLet's calculate each case separately.\n\n**Case 1: The first house is not red.**\n\nIf the first house is not red, it can be either blue or green (2 choices).\n\nThen, each subsequent house has 2 choices, as long as it's different from the previous one.\n\nSo, for this case:\n\n2 (first house) \u00d7 2 (second) \u00d7 2 (third) \u00d7 2 (fourth) \u00d7 2 (fifth) = 2^5 = 32.\n\n**Case 2: The first house is red, and the last house is not red.**\n\nIf the first house is red, the second house can be blue or green (2 choices).\n\nThe third house can be anything except the color of the second house (2 choices).\n\nThe fourth house can be anything except the color of the third house (2 choices).\n\nThe fifth house can be anything except the color of the fourth house, and it can't be red.\n\nWait, hold on. The fifth house can't be red, but it also can't be the same as the fourth house.\n\nSo, the number of choices for the fifth house depends on the color of the fourth house.\n\nIf the fourth house is not red, then the fifth house can be either of the two colors except the fourth house's color, but since it can't be red, it might have only one choice.\n\nWait, this seems a bit tricky. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that the first house is red, and the fifth house is not red, and calculate accordingly.\n\nLet me try to find the number of arrangements where the first house is red and the fifth house is not red.\n\nFirst house: red (1 choice).\n\nSecond house: blue or green (2 choices).\n\nThird house: can't be the same as the second house (2 choices).\n\nFourth house: can't be the same as the third house (2 choices).\n\nFifth house: can't be the same as the fourth house and can't be red.\n\nSo, for the fifth house, it can be one color if the fourth house is not red, or another color if the fourth house is red.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of total arrangements where the first house is red and subtract those where the fifth house is also red.\n\nFrom earlier, we know that if the first house is red, there are 2^4 = 16 possible colorings for the remaining houses, but we need to ensure that the fifth house is not red.\n\nBut wait, in these 16 arrangements where the first house is red, how many have the fifth house red?\n\nWe already calculated that: 8 arrangements where both first and fifth are red.\n\nTherefore, the number of arrangements where the first house is red and the fifth house is not red is 16 - 8 = 8.\n\nSo, combining both cases:\n\nCase 1: 32 arrangements.\n\nCase 2: 8 arrangements.\n\nTotal: 32 + 8 = 40.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more systematic way using recursion or combinatorics.\n\nLet me try to model this using recursion.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- Let \\(a_n\\) be the number of valid colorings for n houses where the first house is not red.\n\n- Let \\(b_n\\) be the number of valid colorings for n houses where the first house is red and the last house is not red.\n\n- Let \\(c_n\\) be the number of valid colorings for n houses where the first and last houses are both red.\n\nThen, the total number of valid colorings is \\(a_5 + b_5\\), since \\(c_5\\) is invalid.\n\nWe already know that \\(c_5 = 8\\), and the total without restrictions is 48, so \\(a_5 + b_5 = 48 - c_5 = 40\\).\n\nBut let's see if we can build a recursive relation.\n\nFirst, for \\(a_n\\):\n\n- The first house is not red, so it can be blue or green (2 choices).\n\n- The second house can be anything except the first house's color (2 choices).\n\n- And so on, up to the nth house.\n\nActually, \\(a_n\\) is similar to the total number of colorings for n houses with the first house not red.\n\nSimilarly, \\(b_n\\) is the number of colorings where the first house is red and the last house is not red.\n\nThis might be a bit convoluted for this problem, as our initial approach already gave us the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of the number of ways to color a row of houses with given constraints using dynamic programming.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- Let\u2019s denote R, B, G as the colors red, blue, green.\n\n- Let\u2019s keep track of the number of valid colorings ending with each color.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- \\(r_n\\): number of valid colorings of n houses where the nth house is red.\n\n- \\(b_n\\): number of valid colorings of n houses where the nth house is blue.\n\n- \\(g_n\\): number of valid colorings of n houses where the nth house is green.\n\nThen, the total number of colorings for n houses is \\(r_n + b_n + g_n\\).\n\nThe constraints are:\n\n- No two adjacent houses have the same color.\n\n- The first and last houses cannot both be red.\n\nFirst, let's find recursive relations for \\(r_n\\), \\(b_n\\), and \\(g_n\\).\n\nFor \\(r_n\\):\n\n- The (n-1)th house can be blue or green.\n\n- So, \\(r_n = b_{n-1} + g_{n-1}\\).\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- \\(b_n = r_{n-1} + g_{n-1}\\)\n\n- \\(g_n = r_{n-1} + b_{n-1}\\)\n\nNow, we need initial conditions.\n\nFor n=1:\n\n- \\(r_1 = 1\\) (just red)\n\n- \\(b_1 = 1\\) (just blue)\n\n- \\(g_1 = 1\\) (just green)\n\nFor n=2:\n\n- \\(r_2 = b_1 + g_1 = 1 + 1 = 2\\)\n\n- \\(b_2 = r_1 + g_1 = 1 + 1 = 2\\)\n\n- \\(g_2 = r_1 + b_1 = 1 + 1 = 2\\)\n\nFor n=3:\n\n- \\(r_3 = b_2 + g_2 = 2 + 2 = 4\\)\n\n- \\(b_3 = r_2 + g_2 = 2 + 2 = 4\\)\n\n- \\(g_3 = r_2 + b_2 = 2 + 2 = 4\\)\n\nFor n=4:\n\n- \\(r_4 = b_3 + g_3 = 4 + 4 = 8\\)\n\n- \\(b_4 = r_3 + g_3 = 4 + 4 = 8\\)\n\n- \\(g_4 = r_3 + b_3 = 4 + 4 = 8\\)\n\nFor n=5:\n\n- \\(r_5 = b_4 + g_4 = 8 + 8 = 16\\)\n\n- \\(b_5 = r_4 + g_4 = 8 + 8 = 16\\)\n\n- \\(g_5 = r_4 + b_4 = 8 + 8 = 16\\)\n\nSo, the total number of colorings without the first and last houses both red is:\n\nTotal = \\(r_5 + b_5 + g_5 -\\) (number of colorings where first and last are both red).\n\nWait, but we need to subtract the cases where the first and last houses are both red.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of colorings where the first and last houses are both red.\n\nWe can find this by considering that the first house is red, and the fifth house is red.\n\nGiven that no two adjacent houses can have the same color, if the first and fifth houses are both red, then the second house must be blue or green, the fourth house must be blue or green (since it can't be red), and the third house must be different from both the second and fourth houses.\n\nThis seems a bit involved. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nTotal valid colorings = total colorings without adjacent houses having the same color - colorings where first and last houses are both red.\n\nWe already calculated the total colorings without adjacent houses having the same color as 48.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the number of colorings where both the first and last houses are red.\n\nAs before, if the first house is red and the fifth house is red, then the second house can be blue or green (2 choices), the third house can be anything except the second house's color (2 choices), and the fourth house can be anything except the third house's color and not red (since the fifth house is red).\n\nWait, the fourth house can't be red, and also can't be the same as the third house.\n\nSo, if the third house is blue, the fourth house can be green (since it can't be blue or red). If the third house is green, the fourth house can be blue.\n\nSo, in both subcases, the fourth house has only one choice.\n\nTherefore, the number of such colorings is:\n\n2 (for the second house) \u00d7 2 (for the third house) \u00d7 1 (for the fourth house) = 4.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8. There seems to be inconsistency here.\n\nLet me re-examine.\n\nIf the first house is red and the fifth house is red, then:\n\n- Second house: blue or green (2 choices).\n\n- Third house: can't be the same as the second house (2 choices, since it can be red or the other color).\n\n- Fourth house: can't be the same as the third house and can't be red (since the fifth house is red).\n\nSo, if the third house is red, the fourth house can be blue or green.\n\nIf the third house is blue, the fourth house must be green.\n\nIf the third house is green, the fourth house must be blue.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, the fourth house can't be the same as the third house and can't be red.\n\nSo, if the third house is red, the fourth house can be blue or green.\n\nIf the third house is blue, the fourth house can't be blue or red, so it must be green.\n\nIf the third house is green, the fourth house can't be green or red, so it must be blue.\n\nTherefore, in all cases, the fourth house has only one choice.\n\nSo, the number of such colorings is:\n\n2 (second house) \u00d7 2 (third house) \u00d7 1 (fourth house) = 4.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8. There must be a mistake in one of my approaches.\n\nLet me cross-verify.\n\nFrom the initial approach, total colorings without restrictions: 3 \u00d7 2^4 = 48.\n\nNumber of colorings where first and last are both red: 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 8.\n\nTherefore, total valid colorings: 48 - 8 = 40.\n\nBut according to this newer approach, it's 48 - 4 = 44.\n\nHmm, there's inconsistency here. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me carefully recount the number of colorings where both first and last houses are red.\n\nFirst house: red.\n\nSecond house: blue or green (2 choices).\n\nThird house: can't be the same as the second house.\n\nIf second house is blue, third house can be red or green.\n\nIf second house is green, third house can be red or blue.\n\nSo, for each choice of the second house, the third house has 2 choices.\n\nFourth house: can't be the same as the third house and can't be red (since the fifth house is red).\n\nWait, no, actually, the fifth house is red, so the fourth house can't be red, but it also can't be the same as the third house.\n\nSo, depending on the third house's color:\n\n- If third house is red, fourth house can be blue or green.\n\n- If third house is blue, fourth house must be green.\n\n- If third house is green, fourth house must be blue.\n\nSo, let's enumerate the possibilities:\n\n1. Second house: blue.\n\n- Third house: red or green.\n\n- If third house is red, fourth house: blue or green.\n\n- If third house is green, fourth house: blue.\n\nSo, for second house blue:\n\n- Third house red: fourth house blue or green.\n\n- Third house green: fourth house blue.\n\nTotal for second house blue: 1 (blue) \u00d7 (1 (red) \u00d7 2 (blue or green) + 1 (green) \u00d7 1 (blue)) = 1 \u00d7 (2 + 1) = 3.\n\nWait, actually, I'm getting confused with the way I'm counting.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations where the first and fifth houses are red.\n\nFirst house: red.\n\nSecond house: blue or green (2 choices).\n\nThird house: can't be the same as the second house.\n\nIf second house is blue, third house can be red or green.\n\nIf second house is green, third house can be red or blue.\n\nFourth house: can't be the same as the third house and can't be red (since fifth house is red).\n\nFifth house: red.\n\nSo, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n**Option 1: Second house is blue.**\n\n- Third house: red or green.\n\n- If third house is red, fourth house: blue or green.\n\n- If third house is green, fourth house: blue.\n\nSo, for second house blue:\n\n- Third house red: fourth house blue or green.\n\n- Third house green: fourth house blue.\n\nTotal for this subcase: 1 (second house blue) \u00d7 [1 (third house red) \u00d7 2 (fourth house blue or green) + 1 (third house green) \u00d7 1 (fourth house blue)] = 1 \u00d7 [2 + 1] = 3.\n\n**Option 2: Second house is green.**\n\n- Third house: red or blue.\n\n- If third house is red, fourth house: blue or green.\n\n- If third house is blue, fourth house: green.\n\nSo, for second house green:\n\n- Third house red: fourth house blue or green.\n\n- Third house blue: fourth house green.\n\nTotal for this subcase: 1 (second house green) \u00d7 [1 (third house red) \u00d7 2 (fourth house blue or green) + 1 (third house blue) \u00d7 1 (fourth house green)] = 1 \u00d7 [2 + 1] = 3.\n\nTherefore, total number of colorings where first and last houses are both red: 3 (from option 1) + 3 (from option 2) = 6.\n\nWait a minute, now I'm getting 6, not 8 or 4.\n\nThis is confusing. I need to reconcile these different counts.\n\nPerhaps it's better to consider the general formula for such problems.\n\nThe number of ways to color n houses with k colors where no two adjacent houses have the same color is given by k \u00d7 (k-1)^(n-1).\n\nIn this case, k=3, n=5.\n\nSo, total colorings without the first and last house restriction: 3 \u00d7 2^4 = 48.\n\nNow, the number of colorings where both first and last houses are red.\n\nIf the first house is red and the last house is red, then the second to fourth houses must be colored such that no two adjacent houses have the same color, and the fourth house can't be red.\n\nThis is similar to coloring a row of 3 houses (houses 2,3,4) with the additional constraint that the fourth house isn't red.\n\nLet me think of it as coloring houses 2,3,4 with colors B and G if house 1 and house 5 are red.\n\nWait, no. House 2 can be B or G.\n\nHouse 3 can't be the same as house 2.\n\nHouse 4 can't be the same as house 3 and can't be red.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for manual enumeration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of ways to color houses 2,3,4 such that house 2 is different from house 1 (which is red), house 3 is different from house 2, house 4 is different from house 3, and house 4 is not red.\n\nSo, house 2: 2 choices (B or G).\n\nHouse 3: 2 choices (can't be same as house 2).\n\nHouse 4: depends on house 3.\n\nIf house 3 is red, house 4 can be B or G.\n\nIf house 3 is B, house 4 must be G.\n\nIf house 3 is G, house 4 must be B.\n\nSo, in all cases, house 4 has only one choice if house 3 is not red, and two choices if house 3 is red.\n\nLet me consider the possibilities:\n\n- House 3 is red: house 4 has 2 choices (B or G).\n\n- House 3 is not red: house 4 has 1 choice.\n\nSo, total for house 3:\n\n- If house 3 is red: probability of house 3 being red is based on house 2.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider the number of ways house 3 can be red or not.\n\nGiven house 2 is B or G.\n\nIf house 2 is B, house 3 can be R or G.\n\nIf house 2 is G, house 3 can be R or B.\n\nSo, P(house 3 is red) = in both subcases, house 3 can be red with probability 1/2.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to just count the cases.\n\n**Case 1: house 2 is blue.**\n\n- House 3: red or green.\n\n- If house 3 is red, house 4: blue or green.\n\n- If house 3 is green, house 4: blue.\n\nSo, for house 2 blue:\n\n- House 3 red: house 4 blue or green \u2192 2 options.\n\n- House 3 green: house 4 blue \u2192 1 option.\n\nTotal: 3 options.\n\n**Case 2: house 2 is green.**\n\n- House 3: red or blue.\n\n- If house 3 is red, house 4: blue or green.\n\n- If house 3 is blue, house 4: green.\n\nSo, for house 2 green:\n\n- House 3 red: house 4 blue or green \u2192 2 options.\n\n- House 3 blue: house 4 green \u2192 1 option.\n\nTotal: 3 options.\n\nTherefore, total number of colorings where first and last houses are both red: 3 (from case 1) + 3 (from case 2) = 6.\n\nTherefore, the total number of valid colorings is 48 (total without restriction) - 6 (invalid cases) = 42.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 40. Which one is correct?\n\nI need to verify this.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the first house is red. Then, the second house has 2 choices (B or G).\n\nSimilarly, the third house has 2 choices (can't be the same as the second house), the fourth house has 2 choices (can't be the same as the third house), and the fifth house has to be red, but only if the fourth house isn't red.\n\nWait, no. The fifth house has to be red, but it can't be the same as the fourth house.\n\nSo, if the fourth house is B, the fifth house must be red.\n\nIf the fourth house is G, the fifth house must be red.\n\nBut the fifth house can't be the same as the fourth house, so if the fourth house is B, fifth can't be B; if fourth is G, fifth can't be G.\n\nBut since fifth house is red, it's only invalid if the fourth house is red.\n\nWait, no. If the fourth house is B, fifth is red: valid.\n\nIf fourth is G, fifth is red: valid.\n\nIf fourth is R, fifth is red: invalid.\n\nBut the fifth house being red is only invalid if the first house is also red, which is already accounted for.\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled up here.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of ways to color the houses with the first house red and the fifth house not red, and then add the number of ways with the first house not red.\n\n**First house not red:**\n\nFirst house: B or G (2 choices).\n\nThen, each subsequent house has 2 choices (can't be the same as the previous house).\n\nSo, total for this case: 2 \u00d7 2^4 = 32.\n\n**First house red, fifth house not red:**\n\nFirst house: red (1 choice).\n\nSecond house: B or G (2 choices).\n\nThird house: can't be the same as the second house (2 choices).\n\nFourth house: can't be the same as the third house (2 choices).\n\nFifth house: can't be the same as the fourth house and can't be red.\n\nSo, the fifth house has:\n\n- If the fourth house is B, fifth house can be G.\n\n- If the fourth house is G, fifth house can be B.\n\n- If the fourth house is R, fifth house can't be R, but since it can't be the same as the fourth house, it's already excluded.\n\nWait, no. If the fourth house is R, fifth house can't be R, but it also can't be R, so it's okay.\n\nWait, actually, if the fourth house is R, fifth house can't be R, but since it can't be R anyway (because first house is red), it's fine.\n\nSo, in this case, the fifth house has only one choice, depending on the fourth house.\n\nTherefore, the number of such colorings is:\n\n1 (first house red) \u00d7 2 (second house) \u00d7 2 (third house) \u00d7 2 (fourth house) \u00d7 1 (fifth house based on fourth house) = 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 8.\n\nTherefore, total valid colorings: 32 (first house not red) + 8 (first house red, fifth house not red) = 40.\n\nEarlier, I had 42, but that seems incorrect based on this.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 40.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's confirm with another method.\n\nLet\u2019s use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal colorings without first and last both red: total colorings - number of colorings where first and last are both red.\n\nTotal colorings: 3 \u00d7 2^4 = 48.\n\nNumber of colorings where first and last are both red.\n\nFirst house: red.\n\nSecond house: B or G (2 choices).\n\nThird house: can't be the same as second house (2 choices).\n\nFourth house: can't be the same as third house and can't be red.\n\nWait, earlier I thought this was 8, but in the case-by-case analysis, it was 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list all possibilities.\n\nLet\u2019s list them:\n\nAssume houses are labeled H1 to H5.\n\nH1: R\n\nH2: B or G\n\nLet\u2019s consider H2 = B:\n\n- H3: R or G\n\n- If H3 = R, H4: B or G\n\n- If H3 = G, H4: B\n\n- H5: R\n\nSo, for H2 = B:\n\n- H3 = R, H4 = B, H5 = R\n\n- H3 = R, H4 = G, H5 = R\n\n- H3 = G, H4 = B, H5 = R\n\nThat's 3 options.\n\nSimilarly, for H2 = G:\n\n- H3: R or B\n\n- If H3 = R, H4: B or G\n\n- If H3 = B, H4: G\n\n- H5: R\n\nSo, for H2 = G:\n\n- H3 = R, H4 = B, H5 = R\n\n- H3 = R, H4 = G, H5 = R\n\n- H3 = B, H4 = G, H5 = R\n\nAnother 3 options.\n\nTotal: 6.\n\nTherefore, the number of colorings where both first and last houses are red is 6.\n\nTherefore, total valid colorings: 48 - 6 = 42.\n\nBut earlier, I had 40 using a different approach.\n\nHmm, there's inconsistency here.\n\nLet me check the approach where I added the two cases:\n\n**Case 1: first house not red.**\n\n2 choices for first house, 2 for each subsequent house: 2 \u00d7 2^4 = 32.\n\n**Case 2: first house red, fifth house not red.**\n\n1 choice for first house, 2 for second, 2 for third, 2 for fourth, and 1 for fifth (based on fourth): 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 8.\n\nTotal: 32 + 8 = 40.\n\nBut according to inclusion-exclusion, it's 48 - 6 = 42.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here.\n\nI think the mistake is in the second approach.\n\nIn the second approach, when first house is red and fifth house is not red, the number might not be 8.\n\nLet me recalculate that.\n\nFirst house: red.\n\nSecond house: B or G (2 choices).\n\nThird house: can't be same as second house (2 choices).\n\nFourth house: can't be same as third house and can't be red.\n\nFifth house: can't be same as fourth house and can't be red.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the dependencies more carefully.\n\nLet\u2019s consider:\n\n- Second house: B or G (2 choices).\n\n- Third house: can't be same as second house (2 choices).\n\n- Fourth house: can't be same as third house and can't be red (might be only 1 choice).\n\n- Fifth house: can't be same as fourth house and can't be red.\n\nWait, perhaps in some subcases, fifth house has no choices.\n\nWait, no, since fourth house can't be red, and fifth house can't be same as fourth house and can't be red, there should always be at least one choice for the fifth house.\n\nWait, maybe not.\n\nLet me consider:\n\nSuppose first house is red, second is B, third is R, fourth is G, fifth must be B (not R or G).\n\nWait, but fifth can't be G (same as fourth) and can't be R.\n\nSo, only B is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, if first is R, second is B, third is G, fourth is B, fifth must be G.\n\nWait, but fourth house is B, so fifth can't be B or R, so only G.\n\nSimilarly, if first is R, second is G, third is R, fourth is B, fifth must be G.\n\nIf first is R, second is G, third is B, fourth is G, fifth must be B.\n\nSo, in all these cases, the fifth house has only one choice.\n\nTherefore, the number of such colorings is:\n\n1 (first house R) \u00d7 2 (second house B or G) \u00d7 2 (third house) \u00d7 2 (fourth house) \u00d7 1 (fifth house) = 8.\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation.\n\nBut according to the inclusion-exclusion approach, the number of colorings where first and last are both red is 6.\n\nNow, I'm confused because both approaches seem logical but give different answers.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in one of them.\n\nLet me re-examine the inclusion-exclusion approach.\n\nTotal colorings without restrictions: 3 \u00d7 2^4 = 48.\n\nNumber of colorings where first and last are both red: 6 (as listed earlier).\n\nTherefore, total valid colorings: 48 - 6 = 42.\n\nBut according to the other approach: 32 (first house not red) + 8 (first house red, fifth house not red) = 40.\n\nThere's a discrepancy of 2.\n\nPerhaps there are overlapping cases or miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total number of colorings where first and last are both red is actually 8, not 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some combinations earlier.\n\nLet me list all possible colorings where first and last houses are both red.\n\nFirst house: R.\n\nSecond house: B or G (2 choices).\n\nThird house: can't be same as second house (2 choices).\n\nFourth house: can't be same as third house and can't be red.\n\nFifth house: R.\n\nLet me list them explicitly.\n\n**Option 1: Second house B.**\n\n- Third house R or G.\n\n- If third house R, fourth house B or G.\n\n- If third house G, fourth house B.\n\n- Fifth house R.\n\nSo:\n\n- R-B-R-B-R\n\n- R-B-R-G-R\n\n- R-B-G-B-R\n\n**Option 2: Second house G.**\n\n- Third house R or B.\n\n- If third house R, fourth house B or G.\n\n- If third house B, fourth house G.\n\n- Fifth house R.\n\nSo:\n\n- R-G-R-B-R\n\n- R-G-R-G-R\n\n- R-G-B-G-R\n\nSo, in total, there are 6 distinct colorings where first and last houses are both red.\n\nTherefore, the number of invalid colorings is 6.\n\nThus, total valid colorings are 48 - 6 = 42.\n\nBut earlier, when I added the two cases, I got 32 + 8 = 40.\n\nThere must be an overlap or miscounting in the addition approach.\n\nPerhaps some colorings are being double-counted or some constraints are not being considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the addition approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe in the case where first house is red and fifth house is not red, the number is not 8.\n\nLet me recalculate that more carefully.\n\nFirst house: R.\n\nSecond house: B or G (2 choices).\n\nThird house: can't be same as second house (2 choices).\n\nFourth house: can't be same as third house (2 choices).\n\nFifth house: can't be same as fourth house and can't be red.\n\nWait, hold on. The fourth house can't be red, but it also can't be the same as the third house.\n\nSo, the number of choices for the fourth house depends on the third house's color.\n\nIf the third house is red, then fourth house can be B or G.\n\nIf the third house is B, then fourth house can be G.\n\nIf the third house is G, then fourth house can be B.\n\nSo, in all cases, the fourth house has only one choice except when the third house is red, in which case it has two choices.\n\nTherefore, the number of such colorings is:\n\nFirst house: R (1 choice).\n\nSecond house: B or G (2 choices).\n\nThird house: can't be same as second house (2 choices).\n\nFourth house: depends on third house.\n\nFifth house: based on fourth house.\n\nLet me consider:\n\n- Second house: B.\n\n- Third house: R or G.\n\n- If third house is R, fourth house: B or G.\n\n- If third house is G, fourth house: B.\n\n- Fifth house: can't be same as fourth house and can't be R.\n\nSo:\n\n1. R-B-R-B-R (invalid, since fifth is R).\n\n2. R-B-R-G-R (invalid).\n\n3. R-B-G-B-R (invalid).\n\nWait, all these options have fifth house R, which is invalid.\n\nWait a minute, if first house is R and fifth house is R, all these are invalid.\n\nBut in the addition approach, I'm considering first house R and fifth house not R.\n\nSo, perhaps there are no valid colorings in this case.\n\nWait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to ensure that the fifth house is not R.\n\nSo, let's adjust the previous enumeration.\n\nIf first house is R, and fifth house is not R, then:\n\nFirst house: R.\n\nSecond house: B or G (2 choices).\n\nThird house: can't be same as second house (2 choices).\n\nFourth house: can't be same as third house and can't be R.\n\nFifth house: can't be same as fourth house and can't be R.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the fifth house must be different from fourth house and not R.\n\nGiven that the fourth house can't be R, the fifth house can be chosen accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider specific examples.\n\nLet\u2019s consider:\n\nFirst house: R.\n\nSecond house: B.\n\nThird house: R or G.\n\n- If third house is R, fourth house: B or G.\n\n- If fourth house is B, fifth house can't be B or R \u2192 no options? Wait, but fifth house can't be same as fourth house and can't be R.\n\n- If fourth house is B, fifth house can't be B or R \u2192 but only option is G.\n\n- If fourth house is G, fifth house can't be G or R \u2192 only option is B.\n\nSimilarly, if third house is G, fourth house: B.\n\nThen, fifth house can't be B or R \u2192 only G.\n\nWait, but fifth house can't be same as fourth house, which is B, and can't be R, so only G.\n\nBut fifth house can't be G because it's same as fourth house? Wait, no, if fourth house is B, fifth house can't be B or R, so it must be G.\n\nBut G is different from B.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that in this case, when first house is R and fifth house is not R, the fifth house's color is determined by the fourth house's color.\n\nSo, the fifth house must be different from the fourth house and can't be R.\n\nTherefore, for each valid coloring where first house is R and fifth house is not R, the fifth house's color is uniquely determined by the fourth house's color.\n\nTherefore, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of ways to color the first four houses with first house R and fourth house not R, and the fifth house is determined.\n\nSo, first house: R (1 choice).\n\nSecond house: B or G (2 choices).\n\nThird house: can't be same as second house (2 choices).\n\nFourth house: can't be same as third house and can't be R (1 choice in some cases, 2 in others).\n\nThen, fifth house: can't be same as fourth house and can't be R (1 choice).\n\nThis seems complex to calculate directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the total number of colorings where first house is R (which is 1 \u00d7 2^4 = 16), subtract the number of colorings where first and last houses are both R (which is 6), to get 10 colorings where first house is R and fifth house is not R.\n\nThen, adding to the case where first house is not R (32 colorings), the total would be 32 + 10 = 42.\n\nThis matches the inclusion-exclusion approach.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 8.\n\nPerhaps I miscalculated the number of colorings where first house is R and fifth house is not R.\n\nLet me recalculate that.\n\nTotal colorings where first house is R: 1 \u00d7 2^4 = 16.\n\nNumber of colorings where first and last houses are both R: 6.\n\nTherefore, number of colorings where first house is R and fifth house is not R: 16 - 6 = 10.\n\nTherefore, total valid colorings: 32 (first house not R) + 10 (first house R and fifth house not R) = 42.\n\nThis matches the inclusion-exclusion approach.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 42.\n\nEarlier, I had mistakenly calculated the number of colorings where first house is R and fifth house is not R as 8, but it's actually 10.\n\nTherefore, the total number of valid colorings is 42.\n\n**Final answer**\n\n\\boxed{42}"
