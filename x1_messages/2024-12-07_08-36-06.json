Transformers, for instance, are used to change the voltage levels within the system for efficient power transmission. Circuit breakers, on the other hand, protect the system from damage by interrupting the current flow when a fault is detected.

        "content": "The primary function of transformers in a power system is to change the voltage levels within the system. So, the correct answer is C.\n\nTransformers are essential components in electrical power systems because they allow for the efficient transmission of electricity over long distances. By stepping up the voltage (increasing it), transformers reduce the current, which in turn reduces the power losses in the transmission lines. Once the electricity reaches its destination, transformers step down the voltage (decreasing it) to a level that is safe and suitable for end-users.\n\nLet's briefly look at the other options to understand why they are not the primary function of transformers:\n\nA. To protect the system from damage: This is more the role of protective devices such as circuit breakers and fuses. While transformers do have some protective features, their main purpose is voltage transformation.\n\nB. To serve as the medium for transmitting electricity: This function is performed by power lines, both overhead and underground. Transformers are located at various points in the power system to manage voltage levels, but they are not the primary medium for transmitting electricity.\n\nD. To interrupt the current flow when a fault is detected: Again, this is the function of circuit breakers and other protective devices. Transformers do not have the capability to interrupt current flow in response to faults.\n\nSo, in summary, transformers are crucial for changing voltage levels to enhance the efficiency and safety of\u7535\u529b\u4f20\u8f93\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"
