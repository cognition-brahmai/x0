How the seasons change with gentle grace,\nFrom summer's warmth to winter's chill embrace,\nEach fleeting hour, a verse in nature's tale,\nWhere every leaf and flower doth sing her pale.\n\nI see in stream's meandering course below,\nThe flow of time, relentless yet serene,\nIt carves the earth, as thoughts our hearts bestow,\nEternal changes, in their ebb and teens.\n\nSo let us cherish each\u77ac\u606f's sweet refrain,\nFor in their passing, life's true beauty reigns."
