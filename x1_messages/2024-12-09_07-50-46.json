        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about people's preferences for tea and coffee, and whether they take them with milk or not. I need to find out what percentage of the entire group drinks their preferred beverage with milk.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the given information:\n\n- 60% of the group prefers tea over coffee.\n\n- 40% prefers coffee over tea.\n\nAmong those who prefer tea:\n\n- 30% drink it with milk.\n\nAmong those who prefer coffee:\n\n- 50% drink it with milk.\n\nI need to find the overall percentage of the group that drinks their preferred beverage with milk.\n\nAlright, so I think I can approach this by considering the group as a whole and breaking it down into parts.\n\nLet's assume there are 100 people in the group for simplicity.\n\n- 60% prefer tea: that's 60 people.\n\n- 40% prefer coffee: that's 40 people.\n\nNow, among the tea preferers:\n\n- 30% drink tea with milk: 30% of 60 is 0.3 * 60 = 18 people.\n\nAmong the coffee preferers:\n\n- 50% drink coffee with milk: 0.5 * 40 = 20 people.\n\nSo, the total number of people who drink their preferred beverage with milk is 18 (tea with milk) + 20 (coffee with milk) = 38 people.\n\nSince we assumed a group of 100 people, the percentage is simply 38%.\n\nBut wait, is there a general formula for this? I think this is an application of weighted averages.\n\nLet me try to generalize it.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- P_t = percentage that prefers tea = 60%\n\n- P_c = percentage that prefers coffee = 40%\n\n- M_t = percentage of tea preferers who drink with milk = 30%\n\n- M_c = percentage of coffee preferers who drink with milk = 50%\n\nThen, the total percentage that drinks their preferred beverage with milk is:\n\nTotal_M = (P_t * M_t) + (P_c * M_c)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTotal_M = (60% * 30%) + (40% * 50%)\n\nBut percentages are involved, so I need to convert them to decimals for calculation:\n\nTotal_M = (0.60 * 0.30) + (0.40 * 0.50)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: 0.60 * 0.30 = 0.18\n\nSecond term: 0.40 * 0.50 = 0.20\n\nAdding them up: 0.18 + 0.20 = 0.38\n\nConverting back to percentage: 0.38 * 100% = 38%\n\nSo, the answer is 38%.\n\nAlternatively, I could have thought of it in terms of probabilities. The probability that a randomly selected person prefers tea and drinks it with milk plus the probability that they prefer coffee and drink it with milk.\n\nP(Tea with milk) = P(prefer tea) * P(drink with milk | prefer tea) = 0.60 * 0.30 = 0.18\n\nP(Coffee with milk) = P(prefer coffee) * P(drink with milk | prefer coffee) = 0.40 * 0.50 = 0.20\n\nTotal probability: 0.18 + 0.20 = 0.38 or 38%\n\nThis seems consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using fractions.\n\nLet's try:\n\nP_t = 60% = 3/5\n\nP_c = 40% = 2/5\n\nM_t = 30% = 3/10\n\nM_c = 50% = 1/2\n\nTotal_M = (3/5 * 3/10) + (2/5 * 1/2)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (3/5 * 3/10) = 9/50\n\nSecond term: (2/5 * 1/2) = 2/10 = 1/5\n\nConverting 1/5 to 10/50:\n\nTotal_M = 9/50 + 10/50 = 19/50\n\nConverting to percentage: (19/50) * 100% = 38%\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think this is solid. But to be thorough, let's consider if there's any overlap or other factors I might have missed.\n\nThe problem states that people prefer either tea over coffee or coffee over tea, so there's no overlap in preferences. Everyone falls into one category or the other.\n\nAlso, the preferences for milk are only within their preferred beverage group, so no one adds milk to a beverage they don't prefer.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is straightforward: sum of (tea preferers with milk) and (coffee preferers with milk).\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the entire group and the proportions.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the group size as G.\n\nNumber preferring tea: 0.60G\n\nNumber preferring coffee: 0.40G\n\nNumber drinking tea with milk: 0.30 * 0.60G = 0.18G\n\nNumber drinking coffee with milk: 0.50 * 0.40G = 0.20G\n\nTotal drinking preferred beverage with milk: 0.18G + 0.20G = 0.38G\n\nTherefore, the percentage is 0.38G / G * 100% = 38%\n\nThis reinforces the earlier result.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider actual numbers.\n\nSuppose there are 200 people in the group.\n\nNumber preferring tea: 60% of 200 = 120\n\nNumber preferring coffee: 40% of 200 = 80\n\nNumber drinking tea with milk: 30% of 120 = 36\n\nNumber drinking coffee with milk: 50% of 80 = 40\n\nTotal drinking preferred beverage with milk: 36 + 40 = 76\n\nPercentage: (76 / 200) * 100% = 38%\n\nSame answer again.\n\nI think it's clear that the answer is 38%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{38\\%} \\]"
