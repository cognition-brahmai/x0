        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a bottle contains 500 ml of water, and I drink 150 ml every hour. I need to figure out how long the water will last. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have a certain amount of water, which is 500 ml, and I'm consuming it at a rate of 150 ml per hour. I want to know how many hours it will take for me to finish the entire bottle.\n\nOkay, so this seems like a division problem. I need to divide the total amount of water by the amount I drink each hour. So, 500 ml divided by 150 ml per hour.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTime = Total water / Drinking rate\n\nTime = 500 ml / 150 ml/hour\n\nNow, when I do that division, 500 divided by 150, what do I get?\n\n500 \u00f7 150 = 3.333...\n\nSo, that's 3 and one-third hours.\n\nBut let's make sure that makes sense. If I drink 150 ml each hour, in 3 hours, I would have drunk:\n\n150 ml/hour \u00d7 3 hours = 450 ml\n\nSo, after 3 hours, I've drunk 450 ml, and there's 500 - 450 = 50 ml left.\n\nNow, I still have 50 ml left, and I drink 150 ml per hour. So, I need to find out how much time it takes to drink that remaining 50 ml.\n\nSince I drink 150 ml in one hour, to drink 50 ml, it would be:\n\nTime = 50 ml / 150 ml/hour = 1/3 hour\n\nSo, 1/3 of an hour is how long it takes to drink the remaining 50 ml.\n\nNow, to express that in minutes, since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 1/3 of an hour is:\n\n1/3 \u00d7 60 minutes = 20 minutes\n\nTherefore, the total time the water will last is 3 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of how many 150 ml portions are there in 500 ml.\n\nSo, 500 \u00f7 150 = 3.333...\n\nThat means there are 3 full portions of 150 ml, with a remainder.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, 3 portions \u00d7 150 ml = 450 ml, leaving 50 ml.\n\nThen, the time to drink the remainder is proportional to the amount left.\n\nSo, time = (50 ml) / (150 ml/hour) = 1/3 hour = 20 minutes.\n\nSo, overall, 3 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the drinking rate in ml per minute.\n\nBut perhaps that's more complicated. Let's see.\n\nI drink 150 ml per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so my drinking rate is:\n\n150 ml / 60 minutes = 2.5 ml per minute.\n\nNow, total water is 500 ml, so time = total water / drinking rate.\n\nTime = 500 ml / 2.5 ml/minute.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n500 \u00f7 2.5 = 200 minutes.\n\nSo, 200 minutes is how long the water will last.\n\nNow, to convert 200 minutes into hours and minutes, we know that:\n\n60 minutes = 1 hour\n\nSo, 200 minutes \u00f7 60 = 3 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nBecause 3 hours \u00d7 60 = 180 minutes, and 200 - 180 = 20 minutes.\n\nSo, again, 3 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, expressing it as a decimal, 3.333... hours is indeed 3 hours and 0.333... hours, which is 20 minutes, since 0.333... \u00d7 60 \u2248 20 minutes.\n\nWait, actually, 0.333... is exactly one-third, and one-third of 60 is exactly 20 minutes.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nTherefore, the water will last for 3 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I plot this on a graph, with time on the x-axis and amount of water left on the y-axis.\n\nStarting at time = 0, water = 500 ml.\n\nEvery hour, I drink 150 ml, so the water decreases linearly.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n\nWater left = 500 - 150 \u00d7 time (in hours)\n\nI want to find when water left = 0.\n\nSo, set 500 - 150 \u00d7 time = 0\n\nThen, 150 \u00d7 time = 500\n\nTime = 500 / 150 = 3.333... hours\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, using proportions.\n\nIf 150 ml is drunk in 1 hour, then 500 ml would be drunk in (500 / 150) hours.\n\nWhich again is 3.333... hours.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, I keep arriving at the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the water will last for 3 hours and 20 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ hours and } 20 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
