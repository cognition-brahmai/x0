        "content": "So I have this problem here about a rectangular garden. It's currently 30 meters long and 20 meters wide, and I need to figure out how much to increase either the length or the width to make the area 50% bigger. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the current area of the garden is. For a rectangle, area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width, right? So, current area is 30 meters times 20 meters, which is 600 square meters.\n\nNow, I need to increase this area by 50%. So, what's 50% of 600 square meters? That would be 0.5 times 600, which is 300 square meters. Therefore, the new area should be 600 plus 300, which is 900 square meters.\n\nOkay, now I need to figure out how much to increase either the length or the width to reach this new area of 900 square meters.\n\nLet's consider increasing the length first. If I increase the length by some amount, let's call it \"x\" meters, then the new length would be 30 + x meters, and the width remains 20 meters. The new area would be (30 + x) times 20 equals 900 square meters.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation: (30 + x) * 20 = 900.\n\nLet me solve for x.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 20: 30 + x = 900 / 20.\n\n900 divided by 20 is 45.\n\nSo, 30 + x = 45.\n\nSubtract 30 from both sides: x = 15 meters.\n\nAlright, so if I increase the length by 15 meters, the new length would be 45 meters, and the width remains 20 meters, giving an area of 900 square meters.\n\nNow, let's see about increasing the width instead.\n\nSimilarly, if I increase the width by some amount, let's say \"y\" meters, then the new width would be 20 + y meters, and the length remains 30 meters. The new area would be 30 times (20 + y) equals 900 square meters.\n\nSo, the equation is: 30 * (20 + y) = 900.\n\nLet's solve for y.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 30: 20 + y = 900 / 30.\n\n900 divided by 30 is 30.\n\nSo, 20 + y = 30.\n\nSubtract 20 from both sides: y = 10 meters.\n\nOkay, so if I increase the width by 10 meters, the new width would be 30 meters, and the length remains 30 meters, which also gives an area of 900 square meters.\n\nInteresting, so to increase the area by 50%, I can either increase the length by 15 meters or increase the width by 10 meters.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe in terms of percentages rather than absolute increases.\n\nLet's see. The original area is 600 square meters, and I want to increase it by 50%, which is again 900 square meters.\n\nIf I want to increase either the length or the width by a certain percentage, how would that affect the area?\n\nLet's assume I increase the length by a percentage p. So, the new length would be 30 * (1 + p), and the width remains 20 meters. The new area would be 30*(1 + p) * 20 = 600*(1 + p).\n\nI want this to be equal to 900 square meters.\n\nSo, 600*(1 + p) = 900.\n\nDivide both sides by 600: 1 + p = 1.5.\n\nSubtract 1: p = 0.5, or 50%.\n\nSo, increasing the length by 50% would achieve the desired area increase.\n\nSimilarly, if I increase the width by a percentage q, the new width would be 20*(1 + q), and the length remains 30 meters. The new area would be 30 * 20*(1 + q) = 600*(1 + q).\n\nSet this equal to 900: 600*(1 + q) = 900.\n\nDivide by 600: 1 + q = 1.5.\n\nSubtract 1: q = 0.5, or 50%.\n\nWait a minute, so whether I increase the length or the width by 50%, the area increases by 50%. But earlier, I got different absolute increases: 15 meters for length and 10 meters for width.\n\nHmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIf I increase the length by 50%, that's 50% of 30 meters, which is 15 meters, making the new length 45 meters, and width remains 20 meters. Area is 45 * 20 = 900 square meters.\n\nSimilarly, if I increase the width by 50%, that's 50% of 20 meters, which is 10 meters, making the new width 30 meters, and length remains 30 meters. Area is 30 * 30 = 900 square meters.\n\nOkay, so in both cases, increasing either dimension by 50% results in the same area increase to 900 square meters.\n\nBut in the first approach, when I considered increasing only one dimension while keeping the other constant, I got different absolute increases: 15 meters for length and 10 meters for width.\n\nWait, but according to this, both increases correspond to a 50% increase in their respective dimensions.\n\nSo, to achieve a 50% increase in area, I need to increase either the length or the width by 50%.\n\nBut the problem seems to be asking how much to increase the length or the width, implying that I can choose to increase only one of them.\n\nYes, and that's what I did.\n\nSo, to increase the area by 50%, I can either increase the length by 15 meters (which is 50% of 30 meters) or increase the width by 10 meters (which is 50% of 20 meters).\n\nWait, but in the second approach, when I considered percentage increases, I got that I need to increase either dimension by 50% to achieve a 50% area increase.\n\nBut in reality, if I increase one dimension by 50%, the area increases by 50%.\n\nSimilarly, if I increase the other dimension by 50%, the area also increases by 50%.\n\nBut in the first approach, where I kept one dimension constant and increased the other, I got different absolute increases.\n\nWait, no, in both cases, the percentage increase was 50%, but the absolute increases were different because the original dimensions are different.\n\nWait, no, in the length case, increasing by 15 meters is a 50% increase from 30 meters.\n\nIn the width case, increasing by 10 meters is a 50% increase from 20 meters.\n\nSo, in both cases, it's a 50% increase in the dimension.\n\nWait, but the problem might be interpreted as increasing only one dimension by a certain amount while keeping the other constant, which is what I did in the first approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intends to find a uniform percentage increase applied to both dimensions.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"increase the length or the width.\"\n\nSo, I believe the interpretation is to choose to increase either the length or the width, not both, to achieve the desired area increase.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, to increase the area by 50%, I can either increase the length by 15 meters or increase the width by 10 meters.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to increase both dimensions by the same percentage, say p, then the new area would be 30*(1 + p) times 20*(1 + p) = 600*(1 + p)^2.\n\nSet this equal to 900: 600*(1 + p)^2 = 900.\n\nDivide both sides by 600: (1 + p)^2 = 1.5.\n\nTake square roots: 1 + p = sqrt(1.5).\n\nSo, p = sqrt(1.5) - 1.\n\nCalculate sqrt(1.5)... that's approximately 1.2247 - 1 = 0.2247, or about 22.47%.\n\nSo, if I increase both dimensions by approximately 22.47%, the area would increase by 50%.\n\nBut the problem specifies increasing either the length or the width, not both.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to choose to increase either the length or the width, keeping the other dimension constant, to achieve the desired area increase.\n\nThus, to increase the length: increase it by 15 meters.\n\nTo increase the width: increase it by 10 meters.\n\nAlternatively, in terms of percentages, that's a 50% increase in either dimension.\n\nBut the problem seems to ask for the amount to increase, so it's 15 meters for length or 10 meters for width.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's another way to interpret this.\n\nMaybe the problem is asking for the amount by which to increase either dimension to achieve the 50% area increase, regardless of which dimension is increased.\n\nIn that case, I've already calculated that increasing the length by 15 meters or the width by 10 meters would both achieve the desired area increase.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for a general formula for the increase in length or width to achieve a 50% area increase.\n\nLet's consider that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the original length as L and the original width as W.\n\nThe original area is A = L * W.\n\nWe want the new area to be A + 0.5A = 1.5A.\n\nIf we increase the length by x, the new length is L + x, and the width remains W.\n\nSo, (L + x) * W = 1.5A.\n\nBut A = L * W, so:\n\n(L + x) * W = 1.5 * L * W.\n\nDivide both sides by W (assuming W \u2260 0):\n\nL + x = 1.5L.\n\nSubtract L from both sides:\n\nx = 0.5L.\n\nSo, the increase in length needed is half of the original length.\n\nSimilarly, if we increase the width by y, the new width is W + y, and the length remains L.\n\nSo, L * (W + y) = 1.5A.\n\nAgain, A = L * W:\n\nL * (W + y) = 1.5 * L * W.\n\nDivide both sides by L (assuming L \u2260 0):\n\nW + y = 1.5W.\n\nSubtract W from both sides:\n\ny = 0.5W.\n\nSo, the increase in width needed is half of the original width.\n\nIn this specific case, with L = 30 meters and W = 20 meters:\n\nx = 0.5 * 30 = 15 meters for length.\n\ny = 0.5 * 20 = 10 meters for width.\n\nWhich matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, to increase the area by 50%, you can either increase the length by 15 meters or increase the width by 10 meters.\n\nAlternatively, if you choose to increase both dimensions by the same percentage, that percentage would be approximately 22.47%, as calculated earlier.\n\nBut again, the problem specifies increasing either the length or the width, so the appropriate answers are 15 meters for length or 10 meters for width.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to this.\n\nSuppose I want to minimize the amount I have to increase one dimension.\n\nIn other words, which option requires a smaller absolute increase: increasing the length by 15 meters or increasing the width by 10 meters.\n\nWell, 10 meters is less than 15 meters, so increasing the width by 10 meters involves less absolute increase.\n\nAlternatively, if I look at it in terms of percentage, both increases are 50% of their original dimensions.\n\nSo, percentage-wise, it's the same effort.\n\nBut in terms of absolute measurements, increasing the width by 10 meters is less than increasing the length by 15 meters.\n\nTherefore, from a practical standpoint, it might be more efficient to increase the width by 10 meters rather than the length by 15 meters.\n\nUnless there are constraints on how much I can expand in either direction.\n\nBut based on the information given, both options are feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for increasing both dimensions by certain amounts, but the interpretation seems to be to increase only one dimension.\n\nWait, the problem says \"increase the length or the width,\" which suggests choosing one of them to increase.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be to increase the length by 15 meters or the width by 10 meters.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem allows for increasing both dimensions by possibly different amounts, that would be a different approach.\n\nBut given the phrasing, I think it's safe to assume that only one dimension is to be increased.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the amount by which to increase one dimension while keeping the other constant, to achieve the desired area increase.\n\nIn that case, again, it's either increasing the length by 15 meters or the width by 10 meters.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the general formula for the increase in one dimension to achieve a desired area increase, given the other dimension remains constant.\n\nIn that case, the formulas I derived earlier apply: x = 0.5L for increasing the length, and y = 0.5W for increasing the width.\n\nIn this specific case, x = 15 meters and y = 10 meters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the increment in one dimension such that, when that dimension is increased, the area increases by 50%.\n\nWhich is what I've already done.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the relationship between the dimensions and the area.\n\nWait, let's consider that the area of a rectangle is A = L * W.\n\nWe want to increase A by 50%, so new area A' = 1.5A.\n\nIf we keep one dimension constant and increase the other, we can solve for the required increase.\n\nWhich is exactly what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of differentials.\n\nIf we consider small changes, then dA = L dW + W dL.\n\nWe want dA = 0.5A = 0.5 L W.\n\nSo, L dW + W dL = 0.5 L W.\n\nIf we hold one dimension constant, say dL = 0, then L dW = 0.5 L W, so dW = 0.5 W.\n\nSimilarly, if dW = 0, then W dL = 0.5 L W, so dL = 0.5 L.\n\nWhich again confirms the earlier result that increasing either dimension by 50% achieves the desired area increase.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider increasing both dimensions by certain percentages, we can set up equations accordingly.\n\nBut given the problem's wording, it's sufficient to consider increasing only one dimension.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that to increase the area of the garden by 50%, you can either increase the length by 15 meters or increase the width by 10 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15 \\text{ meters for length or } 10 \\text{ meters for width}} \\]"
