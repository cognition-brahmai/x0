        "content": "So, the train goes from Town A to Town B, which are 300 miles apart, and it takes 3 hours to do that. It's traveling at a constant speed, which means it's going at the same speed the whole time. First, I need to figure out what that speed is.\n\nSpeed is calculated by dividing the distance by the time, right? So, if it's 300 miles in 3 hours, the speed should be 300 miles divided by 3 hours, which is 100 miles per hour. So, the train is going at 100 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the question is asking how long it will take for the train to travel halfway back to Town A from Town B. Halfway back from Town B to Town A would be half of 300 miles, which is 150 miles.\n\nSo, I need to find out how long it takes to travel 150 miles at a speed of 100 miles per hour.\n\nTime is calculated by dividing the distance by the speed. So, time equals distance divided by speed.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: time equals 150 miles divided by 100 miles per hour, which is 1.5 hours.\n\nTherefore, it will take the train 1.5 hours to travel halfway back to Town A.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The train is going back from Town B to Town A, and we're looking for halfway, which is 150 miles, and its speed is constant at 100 miles per hour. So, time is distance over speed, which is 150 divided by 100, which indeed is 1.5 hours.\n\nAlternatively, since the full journey from A to B is 3 hours, halfway back would be half the time it takes to go from A to B, which would be 1.5 hours. That makes sense too.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1.5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
