        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a box with red and blue balls. There are 6 red balls, and we don't know how many blue balls there are. We're told that if you pick two balls at random without putting them back, the probability that both are red is 1/3. We need to find out how many blue balls are in the box.\n\nFirst, let's understand what probability means in this context. The probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Here, the event is picking two red balls without replacement.\n\nLet's denote the number of blue balls as B. So, the total number of balls in the box is the number of red balls plus the number of blue balls, which is 6 + B.\n\nNow, when we pick the first ball, the probability that it's red is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. That is:\n\nP(first red) = 6 / (6 + B)\n\nAfter picking the first red ball, since we're not replacing it, the number of red balls left is 5, and the total number of balls left is (6 + B - 1) = (5 + B).\n\nSo, the probability that the second ball is also red, given that the first one was red, is:\n\nP(second red | first red) = 5 / (5 + B)\n\nThe probability of both events happening, that is, both balls being red, is the product of these two probabilities:\n\nP(both red) = P(first red) * P(second red | first red) = (6 / (6 + B)) * (5 / (5 + B))\n\nWe're told that this probability is 1/3. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n(6 / (6 + B)) * (5 / (5 + B)) = 1/3\n\nNow, we need to solve for B.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the left side of the equation:\n\n(6 * 5) / ((6 + B) * (5 + B)) = 1/3\n\n30 / ((6 + B) * (5 + B)) = 1/3\n\nNow, cross-multiplying:\n\n30 * 3 = (6 + B) * (5 + B)\n\n90 = (6 + B)(5 + B)\n\nLet's expand the right side:\n\n90 = 6*5 + 6*B + 5*B + B^2\n\n90 = 30 + 11B + B^2\n\nNow, let's bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:\n\nB^2 + 11B + 30 - 90 = 0\n\nB^2 + 11B - 60 = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve this quadratic equation for B. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nB = [-11 \u00b1 sqrt(11^2 - 4*1*(-60))]/(2*1)\n\nFirst, calculate the discriminant:\n\nD = 11^2 - 4*1*(-60) = 121 + 240 = 361\n\nSo, sqrt(D) = sqrt(361) = 19\n\nNow, plug it back into the quadratic formula:\n\nB = [-11 \u00b1 19]/2\n\nFirst solution:\n\nB = (-11 + 19)/2 = 8/2 = 4\n\nSecond solution:\n\nB = (-11 - 19)/2 = -30/2 = -15\n\nNow, since the number of balls can't be negative, we discard B = -15.\n\nTherefore, B = 4.\n\nSo, there are 4 blue balls in the box.\n\nLet me just double-check this to make sure.\n\nIf there are 6 red balls and 4 blue balls, the total number of balls is 10.\n\nThe probability of picking two red balls without replacement is:\n\n(6/10) * (5/9) = (3/5) * (5/9) = (3*5)/(5*9) = 15/45 = 1/3\n\nYes, that matches the given probability. Great, it seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
