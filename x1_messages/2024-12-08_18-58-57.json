        "content": "If I read at a speed of 250 words per minute, to find out how long it would take me to read a book with 100,000 words, I need to divide the total number of words by my reading speed.\n\nSo, 100,000 words divided by 250 words per minute:\n\n100,000 \u00f7 250 = 400 minutes.\n\nNow, to convert minutes into hours, since there are 60 minutes in an hour:\n\n400 \u00f7 60 \u2248 6.6667 hours.\n\nSo, it would take approximately 6 hours and 40 minutes to read the book at that speed.\n\nBut wait, reading for that long without breaks? Probably not realistic. People usually take breaks, so maybe in practice, it would take longer.\n\nAlso, some books have shorter words, others have longer words. Sentence complexity can affect reading speed too. But assuming average text, 250 words per minute seems plausible for a skilled reader.\n\nLet me check another way. Some books have about 250 pages, with around 400 words per page, so that's about 100,000 words. If I read 250 words per minute, how many pages per minute is that?\n\n400 words per page \u00f7 250 words per minute = 1.6 pages per minute.\n\nSo, 1.6 pages per minute. Over 250 pages, that would be 250 \u00f7 1.6 = 156.25 minutes, which is about 2.6 hours.\n\nWait, that's less than my earlier calculation. Hmm, inconsistency here.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the word count per page. If the book has 250 pages with 400 words per page, that's 250 * 400 = 100,000 words. So, reading at 250 words per minute, it should be 100,000 \u00f7 250 = 400 minutes, which is 6.6667 hours, as I initially calculated.\n\nBut according to the pages, 250 pages \u00f7 1.6 pages per minute = 156.25 minutes, which is about 2.6 hours. That doesn't make sense. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, I think I see the mistake. If I read 250 words per minute and the page has 400 words, then time per page is 400 \u00f7 250 = 1.6 minutes per page. So, for 250 pages, it's 250 * 1.6 = 400 minutes, which matches the initial calculation of 400 minutes or 6.6667 hours.\n\nSo, the earlier step where I thought 250 pages \u00f7 1.6 pages per minute = 156.25 minutes was incorrect. It should be 250 pages * 1.6 minutes per page = 400 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it's consistent: 400 minutes, or approximately 6 hours and 40 minutes.\n\nBut in reality, people don't read non-stop. Assuming 10-minute breaks every hour, for example, that would add additional time.\n\nLet's say for every 50 minutes of reading, I take a 10-minute break. So, for every 60 minutes, I only read for 50 minutes.\n\nTo find out how many such cycles I need for 400 minutes:\n\nFirst, find how many 50-minute reading sessions are in 400 minutes:\n\n400 \u00f7 50 = 8 sessions.\n\nEach session has a 10-minute break, so 8 breaks * 10 minutes = 80 minutes of breaks.\n\nTherefore, total time = reading time + break time = 400 + 80 = 480 minutes, which is 8 hours.\n\nSo, with 10-minute breaks every hour, it would take 8 hours to read the book.\n\nAlternatively, if I take breaks less frequently, say every 2 hours, that would be different.\n\nLet's say for every 100 minutes of reading, I take a 20-minute break.\n\nFirst, find how many 100-minute reading sessions are in 400 minutes:\n\n400 \u00f7 100 = 4 sessions.\n\nEach session has a 20-minute break, so 4 breaks * 20 minutes = 80 minutes of breaks.\n\nTotal time = 400 + 80 = 480 minutes, or 8 hours.\n\nWait, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I take breaks every 3 hours, say every 150 minutes of reading, a 30-minute break.\n\n400 \u00f7 150 = 2.6667 sessions.\n\nSo, 2 full sessions and a bit extra.\n\nTotal breaks: 2 breaks * 30 minutes = 60 minutes.\n\nPlus the remaining 100 minutes of reading.\n\nTotal time: 400 minutes reading + 60 minutes breaks = 460 minutes, or about 7.67 hours.\n\nSo, with longer breaks, it's slightly faster.\n\nBut in practice, reading fatigue might set in if breaks are too infrequent.\n\nSo, perhaps the first scenario of 10-minute breaks every 50 minutes is more realistic.\n\nTherefore, it would take approximately 8 hours to read a 100,000-word book at 250 words per minute, including breaks.\n\nBut wait, professional speed readers can read much faster. According to Guinness World Records, the world record for speed reading is held by Anna Maria Cross, who read 4,720 words in 1 minute.\n\nHowever, comprehension at that speed is minimal. For regular reading where comprehension is important, 250 words per minute seems reasonable.\n\nIn schools, average reading speeds are lower, around 150-200 words per minute for adults.\n\nSo, 250 wpm is above average but achievable with practice.\n\nAnother factor is the difficulty of the text. Reading dense academic text vs. an easy novel makes a difference.\n\nAssuming it's an average difficulty text, like a novel or non-fiction book.\n\nSo, to summarize, at 250 words per minute, without breaks, it would take 400 minutes or about 6 hours and 40 minutes to read a 100,000-word book.\n\nWith reasonable breaks, it would take around 8 hours.\n\nBut in reality, people's reading speeds vary, and factors like comprehension, text difficulty, and interest in the material affect reading time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8\\text{ hours}} \\]"
