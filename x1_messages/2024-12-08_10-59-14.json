        "content": "Let's see... This sounds like a riddle. So, it says, \"I appear in the morning. But am always there. You can never see me. Though I am everywhere. By night I am gone, though I sometimes never was. Nothing can defeat me. But I am easily gone.\" Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, it mentions appearing in the morning but being always there. So, maybe something that becomes noticeable in the morning but is present all the time. And it's invisible but everywhere, which makes me think of something intangible, like air or light.\n\nBut then it says \"by night I am gone,\" which suggests that it's related to daylight. Like, perhaps it's light itself. Light appears in the morning, is everywhere during the day, and disappears at night. You can't see light directly, but you see its effects. And it's true that nothing can defeat light, but it's easily gone when night falls.\n\nWait, but the riddle says \"I am always there,\" but also \"by night I am gone.\" That seems contradictory. Maybe it's present all the time but only appears in the morning. So, perhaps it's not light itself, but something associated with the onset of day.\n\nLet me consider another angle. It says \"though I sometimes never was.\" What could that mean? Maybe it refers to situations where it doesn't appear, or perhaps in places where there is no morning, like the polar regions during certain times of the year.\n\nNothing can defeat me, but I am easily gone. So, it's invincible in a way, but also transient. That seems like a paradox. Light fits the invincibility part, but it's not really invincible since it can be blocked or obscured.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe it's not a physical entity but a concept. Like hope, or something abstract. But then it appears in the morning and is gone by night, which doesn't quite fit with abstract concepts.\n\nWait, what about heat? Heat increases in the morning, peaks during the day, and decreases at night. It's invisible, everywhere, and nothing can really defeat it, but it comes and goes with the sun. But then, heat is still present at night, just less intense.\n\nMaybe it's shadow. Shadows appear in the morning as the sun rises, are everywhere during the day, and are gone at night. But shadows are visible, which contradicts \"you can never see me.\" Unless it's referring to the absence of light, which is shadow.\n\nBut shadows are visible in the sense that we see their effects, but perhaps not the shadow itself. It's a bit philosophical. Anyway, maybe that's a stretch.\n\nLet's consider another option: sound. Sound is everywhere, invisible, and you can't see it directly. It's present all the time, but maybe it's more noticeable in the morning with birds chirping or other morning sounds, and less at night when things are quieter. But it doesn't really fit the \"nothing can defeat me\" part, as sound can be easily overcome or blocked.\n\nWhat about time? Time appears in the morning, is always there, invisible, everywhere. By night it's gone in the sense that the day has passed, but time continues. However, time is always moving forward, so it's not really gone at night.\n\nMaybe it's opportunity. Opportunities appear in the morning, are everywhere, invisible, and nothing can defeat them, but they can easily pass away. Though that seems a bit forced.\n\nWait, perhaps it's silence. Silence appears in the morning, is everywhere, invisible, and nothing can defeat it, but it's easily broken. But silence is more associated with the absence of sound, and it's not necessarily present all the time or gone at night.\n\nI'm a bit stumped here. Let me read the riddle again: \"I appear in the morning. But am always there. You can never see me. Though I am everywhere. By night I am gone, though I sometimes never was. Nothing can defeat me. But I am easily gone.\"\n\nMaybe it's dawn or sunrise. Dawn appears in the morning, is invisible, everywhere in the sense that it happens all over the world, and by night it's gone. But dawn is a specific time, not something that's always there.\n\nWait, perhaps it's morning itself. Morning appears in the morning, is everywhere, invisible (as it's a period of time), and by night it's gone. Nothing can defeat morning because it comes every day, but it's easily gone as the day progresses into afternoon and night.\n\nBut morning is a concept, not a tangible thing. Maybe that's the direction to think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's freshness or freshness of the air in the morning. It's there in the morning, invisible, everywhere, and by night it's gone. But again, that seems a bit too specific.\n\nLet me consider another angle. It says \"though I sometimes never was.\" So, perhaps in some situations, it doesn't appear at all. For example, in places with perpetual night, like the polar regions in winter, there is no morning, so the thing in question never appears.\n\nMaybe it's day or daylight. Daylight appears in the morning, is invisible (light itself), everywhere during the day, and by night it's gone. Nothing can defeat daylight; it comes every day, but it's easily gone with the setting sun.\n\nBut again, daylight is present all the time in some places, which contradicts \"though I sometimes never was.\" However, in places like the Arctic Circle during the summer, there is no night, so daylight is always present.\n\nPerhaps it's something related to nature or the environment. Like mist or fog that appears in the morning, is invisible (or rather, consists of tiny water particles that form a veil), is everywhere in the morning, and by night it's gone. But mist can be seen, albeit vaguely, so that might not fit \"you can never see me.\"\n\nWait, what about darkness? Darkness is gone in the morning, is always there on the side of the planet facing away from the sun, is invisible, and everywhere at night. But the riddle says it appears in the morning, which darkness doesn't.\n\nHmm, maybe it's the contrast between light and dark. The difference between light and dark appears in the morning, is everywhere, invisible, and by night it's gone, as everything is dark. But that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nLet me try to think of it differently. Perhaps it's something that is associated with the start of the day, is intangible, ubiquitous, invincible, and transient.\n\nCould it be inspiration or creativity? Inspiration appears in the morning for some people, is everywhere, invisible, nothing can defeat it, but it can easily fade away.\n\nBut that seems too abstract and not directly related to the appearance in the morning and disappearance at night.\n\nWait, perhaps it's something more scientific. Like infrared radiation, which is invisible, everywhere, present all the time, but more noticeable perhaps in the morning as the sun rises. But that might be stretching it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's something related to human perception or biology. Like alertness or consciousness. People are more alert in the morning, it's invisible, everywhere in the sense that everyone experiences it, nothing can defeat it in the sense that it's a natural part of human biology, but it's easily gone as the day progresses and fatigue sets in.\n\nBut that seems a bit metaphorical.\n\nI'm going to take a guess: is it \"light\"? It appears in the morning, is always there in the sense that it's a fundamental part of our world, invisible directly, everywhere during the day, gone at night, nothing can defeat it as it's a natural phenomenon, and it's easily gone with the setting sun.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that fits all the parts of the riddle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's \"dew.\" Dew forms in the morning, is everywhere on surfaces, invisible as it's just water droplets, and by night it's gone as it evaporates. But dew is visible if you look closely, and it's tangible.\n\nWait, perhaps it's \"mist\" or \"fog.\" Fog appears in the morning, is everywhere, invisible in the sense that you can't see it directly, just its effects on visibility, and it's gone by night as it burns off. Nothing can defeat fog, but it dissipates easily with sunlight.\n\nBut again, fog is visible, albeit unclearly.\n\nI'm starting to think that the answer is \"light\" or \"daylight.\" It seems to fit most of the descriptors in the riddle.\n\nSo, my final answer is light."
