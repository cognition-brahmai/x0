        "content": "So the car rental company has 100 cars, and each car is rented out for an average of 20 days per month at a daily rate of $50. We need to find out the monthly revenue generated by the company.\n\nFirst, let's understand what revenue means in this context. Revenue is the total income generated from renting out the cars. To find the total revenue, we need to calculate how much money is earned from all the cars combined in a month.\n\nHere's how we can approach this:\n\n1. Find out how much revenue is generated from one car in a month.\n\n2. Multiply that by the total number of cars to get the overall monthly revenue.\n\nLet's start with step 1: Revenue from one car.\n\nEach car is rented out for an average of 20 days per month, and the daily rate is $50. So, the revenue from one car per month would be:\n\nRevenue per car = Number of days rented per month \u00d7 Daily rate\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nRevenue per car = 20 days \u00d7 $50/day\n\nNow, let's calculate that.\n\n20 \u00d7 50 = 1000\n\nSo, each car generates $1,000 in revenue per month.\n\nNow, for step 2: Total revenue from all cars.\n\nThe company has 100 cars, so the total monthly revenue would be:\n\nTotal revenue = Revenue per car \u00d7 Number of cars\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal revenue = $1,000/car \u00d7 100 cars\n\nNow, let's calculate that.\n\n1,000 \u00d7 100 = 100,000\n\nTherefore, the monthly revenue generated by the company is $100,000.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check our calculations.\n\nFirst, revenue per car:\n\n20 days \u00d7 $50/day = $1,000\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nThen, total revenue:\n\n$1,000 per car \u00d7 100 cars = $100,000\n\nThat also seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it in total days rented per month for all cars combined.\n\nTotal days rented per month for all cars = Number of cars \u00d7 Average days rented per car per month\n\nTotal days rented = 100 cars \u00d7 20 days/car = 2,000 days\n\nNow, total revenue = Total days rented \u00d7 Daily rate\n\nTotal revenue = 2,000 days \u00d7 $50/day = $100,000\n\nSame result. So, $100,000 is indeed the monthly revenue.\n\nBut, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect the revenue.\n\nFor example, are there any costs involved in renting the cars, such as maintenance or insurance? Or are there any discounts given for longer rental periods?\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, we only have the number of cars, the average days rented per month, and the daily rate. So, we can assume that the revenue is simply the product of these factors, without considering any additional costs or discounts.\n\nTherefore, the monthly revenue is $100,000.\n\nWait, but in business terms, revenue is usually considered before deducting expenses. So, $100,000 would be the gross revenue, and net revenue would be after subtracting expenses. But since the question asks for monthly revenue generated, and not net profit, $100,000 is the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total possible revenue if all cars were rented out for the entire month.\n\nAssuming a month has 30 days, if each car was rented out for all 30 days, the revenue would be:\n\n100 cars \u00d7 30 days \u00d7 $50/day = $150,000\n\nBut in reality, each car is only rented out for an average of 20 days, so the actual revenue is:\n\n100 cars \u00d7 20 days \u00d7 $50/day = $100,000\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the monthly revenue generated by the company is $100,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100000} \\]\n"
