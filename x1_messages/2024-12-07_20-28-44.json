        "content": "So I've got this problem here: There's a jar with black and white marbles, total of 30 marbles, and the ratio of black to white marbles is 2:3. I need to find out how many black marbles there are. Alright, let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that ratios compare amounts. So, a ratio of 2:3 means that for every 2 black marbles, there are 3 white marbles. That makes sense. Now, I need to figure out how many of each there are in a jar of 30 marbles.\n\nI think one way to approach this is to consider the ratio as parts. So, black marbles are 2 parts and white marbles are 3 parts, making a total of 2 + 3 = 5 parts altogether.\n\nSince there are 30 marbles in total, each part must represent 30 divided by 5. Let me do that calculation: 30 \u00f7 5 = 6. So, each part is 6 marbles.\n\nNow, since black marbles are 2 parts, I can find the number of black marbles by multiplying 2 parts by 6 marbles per part. That would be 2 \u00d7 6 = 12 black marbles.\n\nTo check if that makes sense, I'll find the number of white marbles the same way. White marbles are 3 parts, so 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 white marbles.\n\nAdding them together, 12 black + 18 white = 30 marbles, which matches the total given. Also, the ratio of 12 to 18 simplifies to 2:3, which matches the given ratio. So, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use proportions. The ratio of black to total marbles is 2 to 5, since there are 2 parts black out of 5 total parts.\n\nSo, the fraction of marbles that are black is 2/5. To find the number of black marbles, I can multiply this fraction by the total number of marbles: 2/5 \u00d7 30 = 12.\n\nAgain, that gives me 12 black marbles, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nI could also set up an equation. Let\u2019s say B is the number of black marbles and W is the number of white marbles.\n\nWe know that B + W = 30, and B/W = 2/3.\n\nFrom the ratio B/W = 2/3, I can cross-multiply to get 3B = 2W, or W = (3B)/2.\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation: B + (3B)/2 = 30.\n\nCombining like terms: (2B + 3B)/2 = 30 \u2192 5B/2 = 30.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2: 5B = 60.\n\nDividing by 5: B = 12.\n\nAgain, 12 black marbles.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I keep getting 12 black marbles. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, I\u2019ll check the ratio with 12 black and 18 white marbles: 12:18.\n\nDividing both numbers by 6, the greatest common divisor, gives 2:3, which matches the given ratio.\n\nAlso, 12 + 18 = 30, which matches the total number of marbles.\n\nI think I\u2019ve covered all the bases here. The answer is definitely 12 black marbles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
