        "content": "To determine the number of ways to choose 3 items from a set of 5 distinct items, we can use the concept of combinations. Combinations are used when the order of selection does not matter.\n\nThe formula for combinations is given by:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items,\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose,\n- \\( n! \\) denotes the factorial of \\( n \\), which is the product of all positive integers up to \\( n \\).\n\nIn this problem:\n- \\( n = 5 \\)\n- \\( k = 3 \\)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 3) = \\frac{5!}{3!(5 - 3)!} = \\frac{5!}{3! \\cdot 2!}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the factorials:\n\n\\[\n5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these values back into the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 3) = \\frac{120}{6 \\times 2} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 10 different ways to choose 3 items from a set of 5 distinct items.\n\nAlternatively, we can list all possible combinations to verify:\n\nLet's denote the five distinct items as A, B, C, D, and E.\n\nThe possible combinations of 3 items are:\n\n1. A, B, C\n2. A, B, D\n3. A, B, E\n4. A, C, D\n5. A, C, E\n6. A, D, E\n7. B, C, D\n8. B, C, E\n9. B, D, E\n10. C, D, E\n\nCounting these, we indeed have 10 unique combinations.\n\nIt's worth noting that the combination formula \\( C(n, k) \\) is also denoted as \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\), which is read as \"n choose k.\"\n\nAdditionally, there's a property of combinations that \\( \\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n - k} \\). In this case:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{3} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \\frac{120}{2 \\times 6} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10\n\\]\n\nThis confirms our earlier calculation.\n\nMoreover, combinations are fundamental in probability theory and combinatorics. They help us determine the number of possible groups or subsets that can be formed from a larger set without regard to the order of selection.\n\nIn contrast, if the order of selection matters, we would use permutations instead of combinations. The formula for permutations is:\n\n\\[\nP(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nBut since in this problem the order does not matter, combinations are the appropriate tool to use.\n\nTo further illustrate the difference, let's consider the number of permutations of 3 items from 5.\n\nUsing the permutation formula:\n\n\\[\nP(5, 3) = \\frac{5!}{(5 - 3)!} = \\frac{120}{2} = 60\n\\]\n\nThis means there are 60 different ways to arrange 3 items out of 5 when the order matters. However, in our original problem, since the order does not matter, we use combinations, which give us 10 ways.\n\nAnother way to think about combinations is that they are permutations adjusted for the fact that order does not matter. Specifically, each unique combination corresponds to \\( k! \\) different permutations. Therefore, the number of combinations is the number of permutations divided by \\( k! \\):\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{P(n, k)}{k!}\n\\]\n\nWhich aligns with our earlier formula.\n\nLet's also consider a smaller example to build intuition. Suppose we have a set of 3 items: {A, B, C}, and we want to choose 2 items.\n\nUsing the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(3, 2) = \\frac{3!}{2!(3 - 2)!} = \\frac{6}{2 \\times 1} = 3\n\\]\n\nThe combinations are:\n\n1. A, B\n2. A, C\n3. B, C\n\nIndeed, there are 3 unique combinations.\n\nIf we consider permutations of 2 items from 3:\n\n\\[\nP(3, 2) = \\frac{3!}{(3 - 2)!} = \\frac{6}{1} = 6\n\\]\n\nThe permutations are:\n\n1. A, B\n2. A, C\n3. B, A\n4. B, C\n5. C, A\n6. C, B\n\nHere, order matters, so A, B is different from B, A.\n\nBut in combinations, A, B and B, A are considered the same, hence only 3 unique combinations.\n\nReturning to the original problem, with 5 items and choosing 3, we've established there are 10 combinations.\n\nIt's also useful to know that combinations satisfy Pascal's identity:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n - 1}{k - 1} + \\binom{n - 1}{k}\n\\]\n\nThis identity can be used to compute combinations recursively.\n\nFor example, \\( \\binom{5}{3} = \\binom{4}{2} + \\binom{4}{3} \\).\n\nWe already know \\( \\binom{5}{3} = 10 \\).\n\nCalculating the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{3} = \\frac{4!}{3!1!} = \\frac{24}{6} = 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} + \\binom{4}{3} = 6 + 4 = 10\n\\]\n\nWhich matches our earlier result.\n\nCombinations are also related to the binomial coefficients, which appear in the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nIn this context, \\( \\binom{5}{3} \\) would represent the coefficient of the \\( a^{2} b^{3} \\) term in the expansion of \\( (a + b)^5 \\).\n\nFurthermore, combinations can be interpreted in terms of set theory. The number of subsets of size \\( k \\) from a set of size \\( n \\) is given by \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\).\n\nIn our problem, we're essentially finding the number of 3-element subsets from a 5-element set, which is \\( \\binom{5}{3} = 10 \\).\n\nAnother perspective is through the use of combinations in probability. For instance, if we randomly select 3 items from 5, the total number of possible outcomes is \\( \\binom{5}{3} = 10 \\), assuming each selection is equally likely.\n\nCombinations are also used in various real-world applications, such as in statistics, where they help calculate probabilities in experiments involving sampling without replacement.\n\nIn summary, the number of ways to choose 3 items from a set of 5 distinct items is 10, as calculated using the combination formula \\( \\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!(5 - 3)!} = 10 \\). This result can be verified through listing all possible combinations or by understanding the relationship between combinations and permutations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
