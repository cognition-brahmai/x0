        "content": "So here's this probability problem involving three friends\u2014Alice, Bob, and Carol\u2014who are taking turns rolling a fair six-sided die in alphabetical order. The game continues until someone rolls a 6, and I need to find the probability that Alice is the first one to roll a 6.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. They roll in the order: Alice, then Bob, then Carol, and this sequence repeats until someone rolls a 6. Since the die is fair, each face has an equal probability of landing face up, which is 1/6 for any specific number, including 6.\n\nNow, the key here is that the rolls are independent events, meaning the outcome of one roll doesn't affect the outcome of the others. Also, since they're taking turns in a fixed order, I need to consider the sequence of their rolls.\n\nLet's think about when Alice can roll a 6 first. She can roll a 6 on her first turn, or if none of them rolls a 6 in the first round, then Alice can roll a 6 on her second turn, and so on.\n\nSo, the probability that Alice rolls a 6 first can be broken down into the sum of the probabilities of her rolling a 6 on her first turn, plus the probability that none of them rolls a 6 in the first round and then she rolls a 6 on her second turn, and so forth for each possible round.\n\nMathematically, this can be represented as an infinite series.\n\nFirst, let's define the probabilities for each person rolling a 6 or not.\n\nThe probability that Alice rolls a 6 is P(A) = 1/6.\n\nThe probability that Alice does not roll a 6 is P(A') = 5/6.\n\nSimilarly, for Bob: P(B) = 1/6, P(B') = 5/6.\n\nAnd for Carol: P(C) = 1/6, P(C') = 5/6.\n\nNow, for Alice to roll a 6 on her first turn, the probability is simply P(A) = 1/6.\n\nFor Alice to roll a 6 on her second turn, none of them should have rolled a 6 in the first round, and then Alice rolls a 6 on her second turn.\n\nThe probability of none of them rolling a 6 in one full round (all three turns) is P(A') * P(B') * P(C') = (5/6) * (5/6) * (5/6) = 125/216.\n\nThen, the probability that Alice rolls a 6 on her second turn is (125/216) * (1/6).\n\nSimilarly, the probability that Alice rolls a 6 on her third turn is (125/216)^2 * (1/6), and so on.\n\nSo, the total probability that Alice rolls a 6 first is:\n\nP(A_first) = (1/6) + (125/216)*(1/6) + (125/216)^2*(1/6) + ...\n\nThis is an infinite geometric series with the first term a = 1/6 and the common ratio r = 125/216.\n\nThe sum S of an infinite geometric series is given by S = a / (1 - r), provided that |r| < 1.\n\nIn this case, |r| = 125/216 < 1, so the formula applies.\n\nTherefore, P(A_first) = (1/6) / (1 - 125/216) = (1/6) / (91/216) = (1/6) * (216/91) = 216/(6*91) = 36/91.\n\nSo, the probability that Alice rolls a 6 first is 36/91.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to approach this.\n\nLet's consider the probability that Alice rolls a 6 before Bob or Carol.\n\nSince the rolls are independent and they take turns in a fixed order, I can think of the game as repeating cycles of Alice, Bob, Carol, until one of them rolls a 6.\n\nThe probability that Alice rolls a 6 in her turn is 1/6, and the probability that she doesn't is 5/6.\n\nSimilarly for Bob and Carol.\n\nThe probability that none of them rolls a 6 in a complete cycle is (5/6)^3 = 125/216, as I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the probability that someone rolls a 6 in a complete cycle is 1 - 125/216 = 91/216.\n\nNow, given that someone rolls a 6 in a cycle, what is the probability that it's Alice?\n\nWell, in a cycle, Alice rolls first. So, the probability that Alice rolls a 6 before Bob and Carol in a single cycle is the probability that Alice rolls a 6 on her turn, given that someone rolls a 6 in that cycle.\n\nThis can be calculated as P(A rolls 6 | someone rolls 6) = P(A rolls 6) / P(someone rolls 6) = (1/6) / (91/216) = (1/6)*(216/91) = 36/91.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of conditional probabilities.\n\nLet me denote P(A) as the probability that Alice rolls a 6 first.\n\nNow, on the first turn, Alice rolls the die. The probability that she rolls a 6 is 1/6, in which case she wins immediately.\n\nIf she doesn't roll a 6 (probability 5/6), then Bob rolls the die.\n\nIf Bob rolls a 6 (probability 1/6), then Alice doesn't win this round.\n\nIf Bob doesn't roll a 6 (probability 5/6), then Carol rolls the die.\n\nIf Carol rolls a 6 (probability 1/6), then Alice doesn't win this round.\n\nIf Carol doesn't roll a 6 (probability 5/6), then the turn cycle repeats, and Alice gets another chance to roll, and so on.\n\nSo, I can set up an equation for P(A):\n\nP(A) = probability that Alice rolls a 6 on her first turn + probability that none of them rolls a 6 in the first cycle and then Alice rolls a 6 in the subsequent cycles.\n\nMathematically:\n\nP(A) = (1/6) + (5/6)*(5/6)*(5/6)*P(A)\n\nHere, (5/6)*(5/6)*(5/6) is the probability that all three don't roll a 6 in the first cycle, and then the game essentially resets, and Alice has the same probability P(A) of rolling a 6 first in the subsequent cycles.\n\nSo, P(A) = 1/6 + (125/216)*P(A)\n\nNow, solving for P(A):\n\nP(A) - (125/216)*P(A) = 1/6\n\nP(A)*(1 - 125/216) = 1/6\n\nP(A)*(91/216) = 1/6\n\nP(A) = (1/6) / (91/216) = (1/6)*(216/91) = 36/91\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the probabilities for Bob and Carol as well to see if everything adds up correctly.\n\nLet me calculate the probability that Bob rolls a 6 first.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can roll a 6 first only if Alice doesn't roll a 6 on her turn, and then Bob rolls a 6 on his turn.\n\nSo, P(B_first) = P(A') * P(B) + P(A')*P(B')*P(C')*P(A')*P(B) + ...\n\nWhich is P(B_first) = (5/6)*(1/6) + (5/6)^3*(5/6)*(1/6) + ...\n\nThis is again an infinite geometric series with first term a = (5/6)*(1/6) = 5/36 and common ratio r = (5/6)^3 = 125/216.\n\nTherefore, P(B_first) = a / (1 - r) = (5/36) / (1 - 125/216) = (5/36) / (91/216) = (5/36)*(216/91) = (5*216)/(36*91) = (5*6)/(1*91) = 30/91.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that Carol rolls a 6 first would be P(C_first) = P(A')*P(B')*P(C) + P(A')*P(B')*P(C')*P(A')*P(B')*P(C) + ...\n\nWhich is a geometric series with first term a = (5/6)^2*(1/6) = 25/216 and common ratio r = 125/216.\n\nTherefore, P(C_first) = a / (1 - r) = (25/216) / (91/216) = 25/91.\n\nNow, let's check if these probabilities sum up to 1:\n\nP(A_first) + P(B_first) + P(C_first) = 36/91 + 30/91 + 25/91 = 91/91 = 1.\n\nPerfect, they add up to 1, which makes sense because one of them has to roll a 6 eventually.\n\nAlternatively, there's a simpler way to think about this problem using the concept of states or recursive probabilities.\n\nLet me consider the state at the start of each cycle (before Alice rolls).\n\nAt the start of a cycle, the probability that Alice rolls a 6 first is P(A).\n\nIf Alice rolls a 6, which happens with probability 1/6, then P(A) = 1/6 * 1 + probability that none of them rolls a 6 in the cycle and then Alice rolls a 6 first in the subsequent cycles.\n\nWait, I think I've already done this above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the overall probabilities for each player.\n\nSince the turns are cyclic and the die is fair, the probabilities should be proportional to their positions in the cycle.\n\nAlice rolls first, Bob second, Carol third.\n\nThe probability that Alice rolls a 6 first is her turn probability divided by the sum of the turn probabilities of all three.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the probabilities in a single cycle.\n\nIn a single cycle, the probability that Alice rolls a 6 first is P(A rolls 6) * P(none of them rolls 6 in previous turns).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the initial approach.\n\nGiven that the infinite series approach and the conditional probability approach both give the same answer of 36/91, and that the probabilities for Bob and Carol sum up correctly, I'm confident that this is the right answer.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Alice rolls a 6 first is 36/91.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{36}{91}} \\]"
