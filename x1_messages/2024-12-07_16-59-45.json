This time, I think it's best if you stay behind.\n\nI've been tracking this lead for weeks now, and it's taking me into some of the darkest corners of Gotham. There are elements involved that I don't fully understand yet, and I don't want to put you in unnecessary danger.\n\nRemember when we took on the Penguin's operation a few months back? That was intense, but at least we had a clear plan and knew what we were up against. This is different. This feels... bigger. There are whispers of an old enemy resurfacing, someone who's been quiet for too long.\n\nI need to go in alone, at least for the initial\u9636\u6bb5. I have to gather information, assess the situation, and make sure I'm not walking into a trap. Once I have a better grasp of what's going on, I'll call you in. I promise.\n\nIn the meantime, there are other cases that need your attention. The streets of Gotham don't stop needing heroes just because I'm off on a solo mission. Plus, I could use someone to watch my back while I'm gone. Alfred can't do it all himself.\n\nI trust you to handle things here. You've come a long way since you first put on the Robin suit, and I'm proud of how you've grown. This is an opportunity for you to lead, to make decisions on your own. Show me \u2013 and yourself \u2013 what you're made of.\n\nJust keep in mind: stay safe. Don't take unnecessary risks. And if something big goes down while I'm away, try to handle it, but know when to call for backup.\n\nI'll be in touch as soon as I can. Until then, keep the night watch.\n\nBatman"
