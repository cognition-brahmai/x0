        "content": "To find the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg), you can use the formula:\n\nmpg = miles driven / gallons of gas used\n\nSo, in this case:\n\nmpg = 240 miles / 8 gallons = 30 mpg\n\nTo convert this to liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km), we need to follow a few steps. First, we need to convert miles to kilometers and gallons to liters.\n\n1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers\n\n1 gallon (US) = 3.78541 liters\n\nFirst, convert the miles driven to kilometers:\n\n240 miles * 1.60934 km/mile = 386.2416 km\n\nNow, convert the gallons of gas used to liters:\n\n8 gallons * 3.78541 L/gallon = 30.28328 L\n\nNow, to find liters per 100 kilometers, we use the formula:\n\nL/100km = (liters used * 100) / kilometers driven\n\nSo:\n\nL/100km = (30.28328 L * 100) / 386.2416 km \u2248 7.84 L/100km\n\nTherefore, the car's fuel efficiency is 30 mpg and approximately 7.84 L/100km."
