        "content": "So I've got this problem here about finding the average number of students per class in a school. There are 5 classes with 30 students each and 3 classes with 25 students each. I need to find the average number of students per class overall.\n\nFirst, I think I need to find the total number of students in all the classes combined. To do that, I'll multiply the number of classes by the number of students in each type of class and then add those totals together.\n\nSo, for the 5 classes with 30 students each, that would be 5 times 30, which is 150 students. And for the 3 classes with 25 students each, that's 3 times 25, which is 75 students.\n\nNow, I'll add those two totals together to get the overall total number of students: 150 plus 75 equals 225 students.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many classes there are in total. There are 5 classes with 30 students and 3 classes with 25 students, so 5 plus 3 equals 8 classes in total.\n\nTo find the average number of students per class, I'll divide the total number of students by the total number of classes. So, 225 students divided by 8 classes.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 225 divided by 8 is 28.125.\n\nSo, the average number of students per class is 28.125.\n\nBut wait a minute, you can't really have a fraction of a student, can you? In reality, you'd have whole numbers of students, but since we're asked for the average, it's acceptable to have a decimal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should express it as a fraction. 28.125 is the same as 28 and 1/8, since 0.125 is equal to 1/8.\n\nSo, the average is 28 and 1/8 students per class.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total students in the 5 classes with 30 students: 5 times 30 is indeed 150.\n\nThen, total students in the 3 classes with 25 students: 3 times 25 is 75.\n\nAdding those together: 150 plus 75 is 225.\n\nTotal number of classes: 5 plus 3 is 8.\n\nDividing 225 by 8: yes, that's 28.125.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Perhaps using weights or something like that.\n\nLet me think: average is just the total sum divided by the number of items, which is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as a weighted average, where the number of students per class is weighted by the number of classes.\n\nSo, the classes with 30 students have a weight of 5, and the classes with 25 students have a weight of 3.\n\nThe formula for weighted average is the sum of (value times weight) divided by the sum of weights.\n\nSo, that would be (30 times 5 plus 25 times 3) divided by (5 plus 3), which is the same calculation I did earlier: (150 plus 75) divided by 8 equals 225 divided by 8, which is 28.125.\n\nSo, same answer.\n\nMaybe I can also think about it in terms of percentages or something, but I think the approach I took is straightforward and correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the average.\n\nFor example, are there any classes with different numbers of students that I haven't accounted for? The problem says there are only 5 classes with 30 students and 3 classes with 25 students, so I think I've covered all the classes.\n\nAlso, is there any possibility that some students are counted in multiple classes? The problem doesn't suggest that, so I can assume that each student is in only one class.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the school has any classes with different sizes not mentioned here, but again, the problem specifies only these classes.\n\nSo, I believe my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the average number of students per class is 28.125.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the answer in fraction form, it would be 28 and 1/8.\n\nBut since it's an average, either way is acceptable.\n\nI think I've covered everything here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28.125} \\]"
