        "content": "First, I need to find the area of the room in square feet and then convert that to square meters. The area in square feet is length times width, so that's 12 feet times 10 feet. Let me calculate that.\n\n12 feet * 10 feet = 120 square feet.\n\nNow, I need to convert 120 square feet to square meters. I know that 1 foot is equal to 0.3048 meters. But since we're dealing with area, I need to square that conversion factor.\n\nSo, 1 square foot = (0.3048 meters)^2 = 0.09290304 square meters.\n\nNow, to find the area in square meters, I multiply the area in square feet by the conversion factor.\n\n120 square feet * 0.09290304 square meters/square foot = ?\n\nLet me do the multiplication.\n\n120 * 0.09290304 = 11.1483648 square meters.\n\nSo, the area of the room is approximately 11.15 square meters.\n\nBut I should check if I did everything correctly. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nFirst, area in square feet: 12 ft * 10 ft = 120 sq ft. That seems right.\n\nConversion factor: 1 ft = 0.3048 m, so 1 sq ft = (0.3048)^2 sq m = 0.09290304 sq m. That looks correct.\n\nNow, 120 sq ft * 0.09290304 sq m/sq ft = 11.1483648 sq m.\n\nRounding to two decimal places, it's approximately 11.15 sq m.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be sure, maybe I can look up an online converter to verify.\n\nSuppose I look up \"120 square feet in square meters\". An online converter would probably give me the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the conversion differently. For example, convert the feet to meters first and then multiply.\n\nSo, length in meters: 12 ft * 0.3048 m/ft = 3.6576 m.\n\nWidth in meters: 10 ft * 0.3048 m/ft = 3.048 m.\n\nNow, area in square meters: 3.6576 m * 3.048 m = ?\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n3.6576 * 3.048 = Let's see, 3.6576 * 3 = 10.9728.\n\nThen, 3.6576 * 0.048. First, 3.6576 * 0.04 = 0.146304.\n\nAnd 3.6576 * 0.008 = 0.0292608.\n\nAdding those up: 0.146304 + 0.0292608 = 0.1755648.\n\nSo, total area: 10.9728 + 0.1755648 = 11.1483648 sq m.\n\nSame as before. So, that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the area of the room is approximately 11.15 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11.15} \\]"
