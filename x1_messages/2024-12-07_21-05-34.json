        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a father who is four times as old as his son right now. And in 20 years, the father will be twice as old as the son. We need to find out how old the son is currently.\n\nFirst, let's assign some variables to make this easier. Let's say the son's current age is S years, and the father's current age is F years.\n\nAccording to the first statement, the father is four times as old as his son. So, we can write that as:\n\nF = 4S\n\nNow, the second statement says that in 20 years, the father will be twice as old as the son. In 20 years, the son will be S + 20 years old, and the father will be F + 20 years old. So, at that time, the father's age will be twice the son's age:\n\nF + 20 = 2(S + 20)\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of F from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n4S + 20 = 2(S + 20)\n\nNow, let's solve for S:\n\n4S + 20 = 2S + 40\n\nSubtract 2S from both sides:\n\n2S + 20 = 40\n\nSubtract 20 from both sides:\n\n2S = 20\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nS = 10\n\nSo, the son is currently 10 years old.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If the son is 10, then the father is four times that, which is 40. In 20 years, the son will be 30, and the father will be 60, which is indeed twice the son's age at that time. Perfect, it checks out.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
