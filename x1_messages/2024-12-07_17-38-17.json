        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we've got a bag of marbles with different colors: 4 red, 6 blue, and 10 green. The total number of marbles is 4 + 6 + 10, which equals 20 marbles. The question is, what's the probability of picking a red marble at random?\n\nFirst, I recall that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is picking a red marble, and the total possible outcomes are all the marbles in the bag.\n\nSo, the probability P of picking a red marble should be P(red) = number of red marbles / total number of marbles. Plugging in the numbers, that's 4 red marbles divided by 20 total marbles, which simplifies to 1/5. To express this as a percentage, I can multiply by 100, so 1/5 times 100 is 20%. Therefore, there's a 20% chance of picking a red marble.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at this. Could there be any other factors affecting the probability, like the arrangement of the marbles in the bag or something? I don't think so, because the problem says it's a random pick, which means each marble has an equal chance of being selected. So, the straightforward approach should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of odds. The odds in favor of picking a red marble are the number of red marbles compared to the number of non-red marbles. There are 4 red marbles and 16 non-red marbles (6 blue + 10 green = 16). So, the odds in favor are 4 to 16, which simplifies to 1 to 4. To convert odds to probability, I can use the formula: probability = favorable outcomes / (favorable outcomes + unfavorable outcomes). So, that's 1 / (1 + 4) = 1/5, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the proportion of each color in the bag. Red marbles make up 4 out of 20 marbles, which is 4/20 = 1/5 or 20%. Blue marbles are 6/20 = 3/10 or 30%, and green marbles are 10/20 = 1/2 or 50%. If I add up these percentages, 20% + 30% + 50% equals 100%, which makes sense because they cover all possibilities.\n\nI could also simulate this scenario. Imagine I have 20 marbles in a bag and I pick one without looking. Each marble has an equal chance of being picked. Since 4 out of the 20 are red, the probability should indeed be 4/20, which is 1/5 or 20%.\n\nLet me consider if there's any chance that the marbles are not equally likely to be picked. For example, if the bag isn't well-mixed or if some marbles are larger than others. But the problem states that the pick is random, so I have to assume that each marble has an equal chance.\n\nAnother angle: suppose I pick two marbles instead of one. How would that affect the probability? Well, that's a different problem. Since the question specifies picking one marble, I should focus on that.\n\nI should also make sure that I'm not confusing this with conditional probability or dependent events. Here, it's a single pick, so it's a straightforward probability calculation.\n\nLet me think about it in terms of expected value. If I pick a marble many times and record the color, the proportion of red marbles I pick should approach 20% over a large number of trials. That aligns with my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use the concept of combinations, I could think of the number of ways to choose 1 red marble out of 4, which is C(4,1), and the total number of ways to choose any 1 marble out of 20, which is C(20,1). So, P(red) = C(4,1)/C(20,1) = 4/20 = 1/5, same as before.\n\nI could also consider that each marble has an equal probability of being selected, which is 1/20. Since there are 4 red marbles, the total probability of picking a red one is 4 * (1/20) = 4/20 = 1/5.\n\nAnother way: if I list all possible outcomes, there are 20 marbles, each labeled uniquely, say M1 to M20, with M1 to M4 being red, M5 to M10 blue, and M11 to M20 green. The probability of picking any specific marble is 1/20. Since there are 4 red marbles, the probability of picking a red one is 4 * (1/20) = 1/5.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here. The probability is clearly 1/5 or 20%. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{5}} \\]"
