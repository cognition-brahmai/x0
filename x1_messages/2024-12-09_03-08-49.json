        "content": "So I have this matrix A, which is:\n\nA = [[1, 2],\n\n     [3, 4]]\n\nAnd I need to find its inverse. I remember that not all matrices have inverses, but since they're asking me to calculate it, I'll assume that this one does. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the inverse of a 2x2 matrix. For a general 2x2 matrix:\n\nM = [[a, b],\n\n     [c, d]]\n\nThe inverse, denoted as M\u207b\u00b9, is given by:\n\nM\u207b\u00b9 = (1 / det(M)) * [[d, -b],\n\n                      [-c, a]]\n\nWhere det(M) is the determinant of M, which is calculated as (a*d - b*c).\n\nSo, for my matrix A, a=1, b=2, c=3, and d=4. Let's compute the determinant first.\n\ndet(A) = (1*4) - (2*3) = 4 - 6 = -2.\n\nOkay, the determinant is -2, which is not zero, so the inverse exists. If the determinant was zero, the matrix would be singular and wouldn't have an inverse.\n\nNow, using the formula for the inverse:\n\nA\u207b\u00b9 = (1 / -2) * [[4, -2],\n\n                  [-3, 1]]\n\nLet's compute each element of the matrix.\n\nFirst element: (1 / -2) * 4 = -2\n\nSecond element: (1 / -2) * (-2) = 1\n\nThird element: (1 / -2) * (-3) = 1.5\n\nFourth element: (1 / -2) * 1 = -0.5\n\nSo, A\u207b\u00b9 = [[-2, 1],\n\n           [1.5, -0.5]]\n\nWait a minute, but I've heard that matrix inverses often have integer entries. Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, the determinant is correct: 1*4 - 2*3 = 4 - 6 = -2.\n\nNow, the formula for the inverse is (1 / det(A)) * [ [d, -b], [-c, a] ].\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n(1 / -2) * [ [4, -2], [-3, 1] ]\n\nMultiplying each element by (1 / -2):\n\n-2, 1, 1.5, -0.5\n\nWait, but 1.5 and -0.5 are not integers. Maybe I should leave them as fractions.\n\nLet's see: 1.5 is 3/2, and -0.5 is -1/2.\n\nSo, A\u207b\u00b9 = [[-2, 1],\n\n           [3/2, -1/2]]\n\nHmm, that seems odd. Let me verify this by multiplying A and A\u207b\u00b9 to see if I get the identity matrix.\n\nLet's compute A * A\u207b\u00b9:\n\nA = [[1, 2],\n\n     [3, 4]]\n\nA\u207b\u00b9 = [[-2, 1],\n\n       [1.5, -0.5]]\n\nMultiplying these:\n\nFirst row, first column: 1*(-2) + 2*1.5 = -2 + 3 = 1\n\nFirst row, second column: 1*1 + 2*(-0.5) = 1 - 1 = 0\n\nSecond row, first column: 3*(-2) + 4*1.5 = -6 + 6 = 0\n\nSecond row, second column: 3*1 + 4*(-0.5) = 3 - 2 = 1\n\nSo, the result is [[1, 0],\n\n                  [0, 1]]\n\nWhich is indeed the identity matrix. So, my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express A\u207b\u00b9 with integers only. Let's see.\n\nI recall that sometimes matrices are manipulated using row operations to find the inverse, and that might keep the entries as integers longer.\n\nLet me try that method.\n\nTo find A\u207b\u00b9 using row operations, I can augment matrix A with the identity matrix and then perform row operations to transform A into the identity, with the augmented part becoming A\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo, I set up:\n\n[A | I] = [[1, 2 | 1, 0],\n\n          [3, 4 | 0, 1]]\n\nAnd I need to turn this into:\n\n[I | A\u207b\u00b9] = [[1, 0 | a, b],\n\n            [0, 1 | c, d]]\n\nLet's perform row operations.\n\nFirst, I can eliminate the 3 in the second row, first column, by subtracting 3 times the first row from the second row.\n\nR2 = R2 - 3*R1\n\nSo:\n\nR2 = [3 - 3*1, 4 - 3*2 | 0 - 3*1, 1 - 3*0] = [0, -2 | -3, 1]\n\nNow, the matrix is:\n\n[[1, 2 | 1, 0],\n\n [0, -2 | -3, 1]]\n\nNext, I can make the second row, second column, equal to 1 by dividing the second row by -2.\n\nR2 = R2 / -2\n\nSo:\n\nR2 = [0 / -2, -2 / -2 | -3 / -2, 1 / -2] = [0, 1 | 3/2, -1/2]\n\nNow, the matrix is:\n\n[[1, 2 | 1, 0],\n\n [0, 1 | 3/2, -1/2]]\n\nNext, eliminate the 2 in the first row, second column, by subtracting 2 times the second row from the first row.\n\nR1 = R1 - 2*R2\n\nSo:\n\nR1 = [1 - 2*0, 2 - 2*1 | 1 - 2*(3/2), 0 - 2*(-1/2)] = [1, 0 | 1 - 3, 0 + 1] = [1, 0 | -2, 1]\n\nNow, the matrix is:\n\n[[1, 0 | -2, 1],\n\n [0, 1 | 3/2, -1/2]]\n\nThis gives me A\u207b\u00b9 = [[-2, 1],\n\n                    [3/2, -1/2]]\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express A\u207b\u00b9 with fractions instead of decimals.\n\nSo, A\u207b\u00b9 = [[-2, 1],\n\n           [3/2, -1/2]]\n\nOr, to write it with fractions:\n\nA\u207b\u00b9 = [[-2/1, 1/1],\n\n       [3/2, -1/2]]\n\nI suppose this is the most simplified form.\n\nAlternatively, if I want all entries to be integers, maybe I can multiply the matrix by 2 to eliminate the denominators, but that would change the matrix, and it wouldn't be the inverse anymore.\n\nLet me confirm my result by multiplying A and A\u207b\u00b9 again.\n\nA * A\u207b\u00b9 = [[1, 2],\n\n           [3, 4]] * [[-2, 1],\n\n                      [3/2, -1/2]]\n\nFirst row, first column: 1*(-2) + 2*(3/2) = -2 + 3 = 1\n\nFirst row, second column: 1*1 + 2*(-1/2) = 1 - 1 = 0\n\nSecond row, first column: 3*(-2) + 4*(3/2) = -6 + 6 = 0\n\nSecond row, second column: 3*1 + 4*(-1/2) = 3 - 2 = 1\n\nSo, indeed, the product is the identity matrix.\n\nSimilarly, A\u207b\u00b9 * A should also be the identity matrix.\n\nLet's check:\n\nA\u207b\u00b9 * A = [[-2, 1],\n\n           [3/2, -1/2]] * [[1, 2],\n\n                           [3, 4]]\n\nFirst row, first column: -2*1 + 1*3 = -2 + 3 = 1\n\nFirst row, second column: -2*2 + 1*4 = -4 + 4 = 0\n\nSecond row, first column: (3/2)*1 + (-1/2)*3 = 3/2 - 3/2 = 0\n\nSecond row, second column: (3/2)*2 + (-1/2)*4 = 3 - 2 = 1\n\nAgain, the identity matrix.\n\nSo, my calculation is correct.\n\nPerhaps there's another way to express the inverse. Let's see.\n\nI know that some matrices can be inverted using the adjugate matrix divided by the determinant.\n\nFor a 2x2 matrix, this should be the same as the formula I used earlier.\n\nLet me compute the adjugate of A.\n\nThe adjugate of A is the transpose of the cofactor matrix of A.\n\nFirst, find the cofactor matrix.\n\nFor a 2x2 matrix, the cofactor matrix is:\n\nC = [[d, -b],\n\n     [-c, a]]\n\nWhich is the same as for the inverse, before dividing by the determinant.\n\nSo, C = [[4, -2],\n\n         [-3, 1]]\n\nNow, the adjugate is the transpose of C, which for a 2x2 matrix is the same as C, since it's symmetric in this case.\n\nTherefore, adj(A) = [[4, -3],\n\n                    [-2, 1]]\n\nThen, A\u207b\u00b9 = adj(A) / det(A) = (1 / -2) * [[4, -3],\n\n                                          [-2, 1]] = [[-2, 1.5],\n\n                                                      [1, -0.5]]\n\nWait, this is different from what I got earlier.\n\nWait, no, actually, this matches if I arrange the elements correctly.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the adjugate matrix.\n\nWait, for a 2x2 matrix, the adjugate is simply [ [d, -b], [-c, a] ], without transposing, because the cofactor matrix is already [ [d, -b], [-c, a] ], and the adjugate is its transpose, which in this case is the same.\n\nSo, adj(A) = [ [4, -2], [-3, 1] ]\n\nThen, A\u207b\u00b9 = adj(A) / det(A) = (1 / -2) * [ [4, -2], [-3, 1] ] = [ [-2, 1], [1.5, -0.5] ]\n\nYes, this matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, everything is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the inverse of matrix A is:\n\nA\u207b\u00b9 = [[-2, 1],\n\n       [1.5, -0.5]]\n\nOr, in fraction form:\n\nA\u207b\u00b9 = [[-2, 1],\n\n       [3/2, -1/2]]\n\nI think this is the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\begin{bmatrix} -2 & 1 \\\\ 1.5 & -0.5 \\end{bmatrix}} \\]"
