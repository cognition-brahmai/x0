        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students playing sports. There are 40 students in total, and among them, 12 play basketball, 18 play soccer, and 5 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport. Hmm, sounds like a classic problem in set theory, maybe involving Venn diagrams.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I know that some students play both sports, so they are counted in both the basketball and soccer groups. To avoid double-counting those students, I need to adjust my calculations.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the total number of students who play at least one sport. That would be the sum of students who play basketball and those who play soccer, minus those who play both, because they are counted in both groups.\n\nSo, the formula for the number of students who play at least one sport is:\n\nNumber playing at least one sport = (Number playing basketball) + (Number playing soccer) - (Number playing both)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber playing at least one sport = 12 + 18 - 5 = 25\n\nSo, 25 students play either basketball, soccer, or both.\n\nNow, to find out how many students don't play either sport, I'll subtract the number of students who play at least one sport from the total number of students.\n\nNumber not playing either sport = Total students - Number playing at least one sport\n\nNumber not playing either sport = 40 - 25 = 15\n\nTherefore, 15 students do not play either sport.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I remember there's a formula for the union of two sets:\n\nn(A \u222a B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \u2229 B)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n(A \u222a B) is the number of elements in either set A or set B or both.\n\n- n(A) is the number of elements in set A.\n\n- n(B) is the number of elements in set B.\n\n- n(A \u2229 B) is the number of elements in both sets A and B.\n\nIn this case, set A is students playing basketball, and set B is students playing soccer.\n\nSo, n(A) = 12, n(B) = 18, n(A \u2229 B) = 5.\n\nTherefore, n(A \u222a B) = 12 + 18 - 5 = 25, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAnd the total number of students is 40, so the number not in A \u222a B is 40 - 25 = 15.\n\nThat seems solid. But maybe I can approach it differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way is to consider the number of students who play only basketball, only soccer, and both, and then see how that adds up.\n\nNumber playing only basketball = total basketball players - those who play both = 12 - 5 = 7\n\nNumber playing only soccer = total soccer players - those who play both = 18 - 5 = 13\n\nNumber playing both = 5\n\nSo, total playing at least one sport = only basketball + only soccer + both = 7 + 13 + 5 = 25\n\nAgain, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nNow, to find those who don't play either sport: total students - those who play at least one sport = 40 - 25 = 15\n\nI think that's pretty much it. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I were to use the concept of sets and verify with a Venn diagram.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents basketball players, and the other represents soccer players.\n\n- The overlap (both sports) has 5 students.\n\n- Only basketball would be 12 - 5 = 7 students.\n\n- Only soccer would be 18 - 5 = 13 students.\n\nSo, adding up the parts: 7 (only basketball) + 13 (only soccer) + 5 (both) = 25 students involved in at least one sport.\n\nTotal students are 40, so 40 - 25 = 15 students not involved in either sport.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the probability or the complement set, the number of students not playing either sport would be the total minus those playing at least one sport.\n\nBut since this is a finite set, the approach remains the same.\n\nI don't think I need to complicate it further. The answer seems clear: 15 students do not play either sport.\n\nJust to make sure, let me see if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any possibility that some students play other sports not mentioned here? The question only talks about basketball and soccer, so I think it's safe to assume that's all the information needed.\n\nAlso, it's a class of 40 students, and the question specifies how many play each sport and how many play both.\n\nSo, sticking with the set theory approach, I'm confident that 15 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
