        "content": "Alright, I'll help you with that. We'll create a Python script that interacts with a SQLite database to manage student records. SQLite is a lightweight database that doesn't require a separate server process and is perfect for small applications like this.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Python installed on your system. SQLite comes pre-installed with Python, so you don't need to install any additional packages.\n\nLet's break down the tasks:\n\n1. Connect to a SQLite database.\n2. Create a table named \"students\" with columns for name, age, and grade.\n3. Insert sample data into the \"students\" table.\n4. Create a function to display all records from the \"students\" table.\n5. Create a function to update a student's information by ID.\n6. Create a function to delete a student by ID.\n\nI'll guide you through each step.\n\n**Step 1: Connect to a SQLite database**\n\nTo connect to a SQLite database in Python, you'll use the `sqlite3` module. You'll need to import it and then establish a connection to the database file. If the database file doesn't exist, SQLite will create it automatically.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Connect to the database (or create it if it doesn't exist)\nconnection = sqlite3.connect('students.db')\n\n# Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands\ncursor = connection.cursor()\n```\n\n**Step 2: Create the \"students\" table**\n\nNow, you'll create a table named \"students\" with columns for name, age, and grade. We'll also include an ID column as the primary key for each student, which will help in updating and deleting records.\n\nHere's the SQL command to create the table:\n\n```python\n# Create the students table\ncreate_table_query = '''\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n    name TEXT NOT NULL,\n    age INTEGER NOT NULL,\n    grade REAL NOT NULL\n);\n'''\ncursor.execute(create_table_query)\n```\n\n**Step 3: Insert sample data into the \"students\" table**\n\nLet's insert some sample data into the \"students\" table. You can insert multiple records using a loop or individual insert statements.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\n# Sample data\nsample_students = [\n    ('Alice', 20, 85.5),\n    ('Bob', 22, 78.0),\n    ('Charlie', 21, 90.2)\n]\n\n# Insert sample data\nfor student in sample_students:\n    insert_query = '''\n    INSERT INTO students (name, age, grade) VALUES (?, ?, ?);\n    '''\n    cursor.execute(insert_query, student)\n\n# Commit the changes\nconnection.commit()\n```\n\n**Step 4: Create a function to display all records**\n\nWe'll create a function that retrieves and prints all records from the \"students\" table.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef display_all_students():\n    select_query = '''\n    SELECT id, name, age, grade FROM students;\n    '''\n    cursor.execute(select_query)\n    rows = cursor.fetchall()\n    \n    print(\"\\nAll Students:\")\n    for row in rows:\n        print(f\"ID: {row[0]}, Name: {row[1]}, Age: {row[2]}, Grade: {row[3]}\")\n```\n\n**Step 5: Create a function to update a student's information by ID**\n\nNext, we'll create a function to update a student's information based on their ID.\n\nHere's an example function:\n\n```python\ndef update_student(student_id, new_name, new_age, new_grade):\n    update_query = '''\n    UPDATE students SET name = ?, age = ?, grade = ? WHERE id = ?;\n    '''\n    cursor.execute(update_query, (new_name, new_age, new_grade, student_id))\n    connection.commit()\n    print(f\"Updated student with ID {student_id}\")\n```\n\n**Step 6: Create a function to delete a student by ID**\n\nFinally, we'll create a function to delete a student record based on their ID.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef delete_student(student_id):\n    delete_query = '''\n    DELETE FROM students WHERE id = ?;\n    '''\n    cursor.execute(delete_query, (student_id,))\n    connection.commit()\n    print(f\"Deleted student with ID {student_id}\")\n```\n\n**Putting it all together**\n\nNow, let's put all these parts together into a complete script. I'll also add some example usage of the functions.\n\nHere's the complete Python script:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Connect to the database (or create it if it doesn't exist)\nconnection = sqlite3.connect('students.db')\ncursor = connection.cursor()\n\n# Create the students table\ncreate_table_query = '''\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n    name TEXT NOT NULL,\n    age INTEGER NOT NULL,\n    grade REAL NOT NULL\n);\n'''\ncursor.execute(create_table_query)\n\n# Sample data\nsample_students = [\n    ('Alice', 20, 85.5),\n    ('Bob', 22, 78.0),\n    ('Charlie', 21, 90.2)\n]\n\n# Insert sample data\nfor student in sample_students:\n    insert_query = '''\n    INSERT INTO students (name, age, grade) VALUES (?, ?, ?);\n    '''\n    cursor.execute(insert_query, student)\n\n# Commit the changes\nconnection.commit()\n\ndef display_all_students():\n    select_query = '''\n    SELECT id, name, age, grade FROM students;\n    '''\n    cursor.execute(select_query)\n    rows = cursor.fetchall()\n    \n    print(\"\\nAll Students:\")\n    for row in rows:\n        print(f\"ID: {row[0]}, Name: {row[1]}, Age: {row[2]}, Grade: {row[3]}\")\n\ndef update_student(student_id, new_name, new_age, new_grade):\n    update_query = '''\n    UPDATE students SET name = ?, age = ?, grade = ? WHERE id = ?;\n    '''\n    cursor.execute(update_query, (new_name, new_age, new_grade, student_id))\n    connection.commit()\n    print(f\"Updated student with ID {student_id}\")\n\ndef delete_student(student_id):\n    delete_query = '''\n    DELETE FROM students WHERE id = ?;\n    '''\n    cursor.execute(delete_query, (student_id,))\n    connection.commit()\n    print(f\"Deleted student with ID {student_id}\")\n\n# Example usage\ndisplay_all_students()\n\n# Update a student\nupdate_student(1, 'Alice Johnson', 21, 88.5)\ndisplay_all_students()\n\n# Delete a student\ndelete_student(2)\ndisplay_all_students()\n\n# Close the connection\nconnection.close()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n1. **Connecting to the Database:** We use `sqlite3.connect()` to connect to the SQLite database file `students.db`. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.\n\n2. **Creating the Table:** We execute an SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement to create the \"students\" table if it doesn't already exist. The table has columns for ID, name, age, and grade.\n\n3. **Inserting Sample Data:** We insert a few sample student records into the table using parameterized SQL queries to prevent SQL injection.\n\n4. **Displaying All Records:** The `display_all_students` function fetches and prints all records from the \"students\" table.\n\n5. **Updating a Student's Information:** The `update_student` function updates the name, age, and grade of a student based on their ID.\n\n6. **Deleting a Student by ID:** The `delete_student` function removes a student record from the table based on their ID.\n\n7. **Example Usage:** We demonstrate how to use these functions by displaying all students, updating a student's information, displaying again, deleting a student, and displaying the final list.\n\nMake sure to run this script in an environment where you have Python installed, and you should see the output in the console showing the students' data being inserted, updated, and deleted as per the functions called.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further clarification on any part of this script, feel free to ask!"
