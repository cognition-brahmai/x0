        "content": "So there's a class with 20 students, and out of those, 12 are boys. I need to find the ratio of girls to boys in the class. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many girls are in the class. Since there are 20 students in total and 12 of them are boys, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students to get the number of girls.\n\nSo, number of girls = total students - number of boys\nThat would be 20 - 12 = 8 girls.\n\nNow, I need to find the ratio of girls to boys. The ratio compares the number of girls to the number of boys. So, it's girls:boys.\n\nI've got 8 girls and 12 boys. So, the ratio is 8:12.\n\nBut ratios can be simplified, just like fractions. To simplify, I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 8 and 12.\n\nLet's see, the factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, 8.\nThe factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\nThe greatest common factor is 4.\n\nSo, I can divide both parts of the ratio by 4.\n\n8 \u00f7 4 = 2\n12 \u00f7 4 = 3\n\nTherefore, the simplified ratio of girls to boys is 2:3.\n\nLet me just double-check that.\n\nStarting with 20 students, 12 boys, so 8 girls.\n\nRatio is 8:12, divide both by 4, gets 2:3.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2:3} \\]"
