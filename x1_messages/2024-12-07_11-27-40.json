        "content": "Let's see. If someone saves 5% of their $3,000 monthly income, that means they're setting aside $3,000 times 5%, right? So, first, I need to calculate what 5% of $3,000 is.\n\n5% of $3,000 is 0.05 multiplied by 3000, which is $150. So, they save $150 each month.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much they'll have saved after 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so 2 years would be 2 times 12, which is 24 months.\n\nSo, if they save $150 each month for 24 months, the total savings would be $150 multiplied by 24.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 150 times 24.\n\nWell, 150 times 20 is 3,000, and 150 times 4 is 600. So, 3,000 plus 600 is 3,600.\n\nTherefore, after 2 years, they would have saved $3,600.\n\nBut wait, is there anything else I should consider? Like interest or something? The question doesn't mention anything about interest, so probably we can assume it's just straightforward savings without interest.\n\nOkay, so the final answer should be $3,600.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3600} \\]"
