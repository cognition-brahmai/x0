The current annual maintenance cost for the natural grass field is $200,000, while the artificial turf has an installation cost of $1 million and an expected lifespan of 10 years with an annual maintenance cost of $50,000. Calculate the total cost savings over a 10-year period if the stadium switches to artificial turf and provide step-by-step reasoning."

        "content": "To determine the total cost savings over a 10-year period for the sports stadium switching from natural grass to artificial turf, we need to compare the total costs of maintaining both options over that timeframe.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of maintaining the natural grass field over 10 years:\n\nAnnual maintenance cost for natural grass: $200,000\n\nTotal cost for 10 years = 10 years * $200,000/year = $2,000,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of installing and maintaining the artificial turf over the same 10-year period:\n\nInstallation cost for artificial turf: $1,000,000\n\nAnnual maintenance cost for artificial turf: $50,000\n\nTotal maintenance cost over 10 years = 10 years * $50,000/year = $500,000\n\nTotal cost for artificial turf over 10 years = installation cost + total maintenance cost = $1,000,000 + $500,000 = $1,500,000\n\nNext, we'll find the difference between the total costs of the two options to determine the cost savings:\n\nCost savings = total cost of natural grass - total cost of artificial turf = $2,000,000 - $1,500,000 = $500,000\n\nTherefore, by switching to artificial turf, the stadium can save $500,000 over a 10-year period.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of maintaining natural grass for 10 years.\n   - Annual maintenance: $200,000\n   - Total: 10 * $200,000 = $2,000,000\n\n2. Calculate the total cost of artificial turf installation and maintenance for 10 years.\n   - Installation: $1,000,000\n   - Annual maintenance: $50,000\n   - Total maintenance over 10 years: 10 * $50,000 = $500,000\n   - Total cost: $1,000,000 + $500,000 = $1,500,000\n\n3. Determine the cost savings by subtracting the total artificial turf cost from the total natural grass cost.\n   - Savings: $2,000,000 - $1,500,000 = $500,000\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500000} \\]"
