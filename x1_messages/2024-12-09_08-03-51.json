        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces two types of products: Product X and Product Y. The profit for each unit of Product X is $20, and for Product Y, it's $30. The factory produces a total of 800 units per day and makes a daily profit of $22,000. We need to find out how many units of each product are produced.\n\nFirst, I think we should define variables for the number of units of each product. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of units of Product X.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of units of Product Y.\n\nNow, according to the problem, the total number of units produced per day is 800. So, we can write the first equation as:\n\n\\[ x + y = 800 \\]\n\nNext, the profit from each unit of Product X is $20, and for Product Y, it's $30. The total daily profit is $22,000. So, the profit equation would be:\n\n\\[ 20x + 30y = 22,000 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 800 \\)\n\n2. \\( 20x + 30y = 22,000 \\)\n\nI think the best way to solve this is by using the substitution or elimination method. Let's try the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 10 to make the numbers smaller:\n\n\\[ 2x + 3y = 2,200 \\]\n\nNow, our system looks like:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 800 \\)\n\n2. \\( 2x + 3y = 2,200 \\)\n\nLet's try to eliminate one of the variables. If we multiply the first equation by 2, we get:\n\n\\[ 2x + 2y = 1,600 \\]\n\nNow, we can subtract this new equation from the second equation to eliminate \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ (2x + 3y) - (2x + 2y) = 2,200 - 1,600 \\]\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n\\[ 2x + 3y - 2x - 2y = 600 \\]\n\n\\[ y = 600 \\]\n\nSo, \\( y = 600 \\). That means 600 units of Product Y are produced.\n\nNow, we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x + 600 = 800 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 800 - 600 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 200 \\]\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 200 units of Product X and 600 units of Product Y.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. The total number of units is \\( 200 + 600 = 800 \\), which matches the given total. Now, let's check the profit:\n\nProfit from Product X: \\( 200 \\times 20 = 4,000 \\) dollars\n\nProfit from Product Y: \\( 600 \\times 30 = 18,000 \\) dollars\n\nTotal profit: \\( 4,000 + 18,000 = 22,000 \\) dollars, which matches the given profit.\n\nLooks good! So, the factory produces 200 units of Product X and 600 units of Product Y each day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200 \\text{ units of Product X and } 600 \\text{ units of Product Y}} \\]"
