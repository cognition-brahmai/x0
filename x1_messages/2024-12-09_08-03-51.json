        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a train traveling from Town A to Town B at 60 km/h, and then from Town B to Town C at 80 km/h. The total distance from Town A to Town C is 280 km, and the entire journey takes 4 hours. We need to find the distance between Town A and Town B.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say the distance from Town A to Town B is \\( d \\) kilometers. Since the train travels at 60 km/h from A to B, the time it takes to cover this distance is \\( \\frac{d}{60} \\) hours.\n\nNext, the distance from Town B to Town C would be the total distance minus the distance from A to B, which is \\( 280 - d \\) kilometers. The train travels this segment at 80 km/h, so the time for this part is \\( \\frac{280 - d}{80} \\) hours.\n\nThe total time for the entire journey is the sum of the times for both segments, which is given as 4 hours. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{280 - d}{80} = 4\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to solve for \\( d \\). To do this, let's first find a common denominator for the fractions, which would be 240 (the least common multiple of 60 and 80).\n\nRewriting each fraction with the common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{60} = \\frac{4d}{240}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{280 - d}{80} = \\frac{3(280 - d)}{240} = \\frac{840 - 3d}{240}\n\\]\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4d + 840 - 3d}{240} = 4\n\\]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d + 840}{240} = 4\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the denominator, multiply both sides by 240:\n\n\\[\nd + 840 = 960\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract 840 from both sides:\n\n\\[\nd = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, the distance between Town A and Town B is 120 kilometers.\n\nLet me just double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If \\( d = 120 \\) km, then the time from A to B is \\( \\frac{120}{60} = 2 \\) hours. The distance from B to C is \\( 280 - 120 = 160 \\) km, and the time for that part is \\( \\frac{160}{80} = 2 \\) hours. Total time is 2 + 2 = 4 hours, which matches the given total time. Looks good!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
