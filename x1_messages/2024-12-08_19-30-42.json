        "content": "To find the area of a triangle when you know the lengths of all three sides, you can use Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle whose sides have lengths a, b, and c is:\n\nArea = \u221a[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]\n\nwhere s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle:\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2\n\nFirst, let's identify the side lengths:\n\na = 5 cm\n\nb = 7 cm\n\nc = 9 cm\n\nNow, calculate the semi-perimeter:\n\ns = (5 + 7 + 9)/2 = 21/2 = 10.5 cm\n\nNext, plug the values into Heron's formula:\n\nArea = \u221a[10.5(10.5 - 5)(10.5 - 7)(10.5 - 9)] = \u221a[10.5 \u00d7 5.5 \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 1.5]\n\nCalculate the product inside the square root:\n\n10.5 \u00d7 5.5 = 57.75\n\n3.5 \u00d7 1.5 = 5.25\n\nNow, 57.75 \u00d7 5.25 = 303.1875\n\nSo, Area = \u221a303.1875 \u2248 17.412 cm\u00b2\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is approximately 17.412 square centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17.412} \\]"
