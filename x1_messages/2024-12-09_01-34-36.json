        "content": "So I've got this algebra problem here: simplify (3x^2 - 5x + 7) - (2x^2 - 4x - 1). Hmm, okay, let's see. I remember that when you subtract one polynomial from another, you basically need to distribute the negative sign through the second set of parentheses and then combine like terms.\n\nSo first, I'll write it out again to make sure I'm clear:\n\n(3x^2 - 5x + 7) - (2x^2 - 4x - 1)\n\nNow, I need to distribute that negative sign to each term inside the second set of parentheses. That means:\n\n- (2x^2) becomes -2x^2\n\n- (-4x) becomes +4x (because negative times negative is positive)\n\n- (-1) becomes +1\n\nSo after distributing the negative, the expression becomes:\n\n3x^2 - 5x + 7 - 2x^2 + 4x + 1\n\nNext, I need to combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. So, I'll group the x^2 terms, the x terms, and the constant terms together.\n\nx^2 terms: 3x^2 - 2x^2\n\nx terms: -5x + 4x\n\nConstant terms: 7 + 1\n\nNow, let's do the math for each group:\n\nx^2 terms: 3x^2 - 2x^2 = (3 - 2)x^2 = 1x^2, which is just x^2\n\nx terms: -5x + 4x = (-5 + 4)x = -1x, which is -x\n\nConstant terms: 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, putting it all together, the simplified expression is:\n\nx^2 - x + 8\n\nI think that's the final answer. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\n(3x^2 - 5x + 7) - (2x^2 - 4x - 1)\n\nDistribute the negative:\n\n3x^2 - 5x + 7 - 2x^2 + 4x + 1\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3x^2 - 2x^2 = x^2\n\n-5x + 4x = -x\n\n7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, yes, x^2 - x + 8.\n\nI feel confident about that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{x^{2} - x + 8} \\]"
