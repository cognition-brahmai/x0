        "content": "Alright, I need to figure out how Albert Einstein contributed to quantum mechanics. I know Einstein is famous for his theory of relativity, but I'm not too sure about his work in quantum mechanics. Maybe I should start by searching for some general information about Einstein's contributions to physics, and see where quantum mechanics fits in.\n\nSo, first step: use the InfoSearch tool to look up \"Albert Einstein contributions to quantum mechanics.\"\n\nPlan: Search for information about Einstein's contributions to quantum mechanics.\n:evidence0: = InfoSearch[\"Albert Einstein contributions to quantum mechanics\"]\n\nOnce I have that search result, I can look through the URLs provided and maybe pick a few that look promising for a deeper dive. Probably, encyclopedia entries or science articles would be good sources.\n\nPlan: Select a relevant URL from :evidence0: and read its content.\n:evidence1: = URLReader[select URL from :evidence0:]\n\nAfter reading the content, I should have a better understanding of Einstein's role in quantum mechanics. Maybe I can summarize the main points or pull out key contributions he made.\n\nPlan: Summarize Einstein's contributions to quantum mechanics based on :evidence1:.\n:evidence2: = QAMachine[\"What were Albert Einstein's key contributions to quantum mechanics?\", given :evidence1:]\n\nBut I should probably cross-verify this information with another source to ensure accuracy. So, maybe do another search or check another URL.\n\nPlan: Search for additional information to confirm :evidence2:.\n:evidence3: = InfoSearch[\"Einstein's quantum theory\"]\n\nThen, read another relevant URL.\n\nPlan: Select another URL from :evidence3: and read its content.\n:evidence4: = URLReader[select URL from :evidence3:]\n\nNow, compare the information from :evidence1: and :evidence4: to see if they agree on Einstein's contributions. If there's any discrepancy, I might need to look for more sources or understand the context better.\n\nPlan: Compare :evidence2: and :evidence4: to ensure consistency.\n:evidence5: = QAMachine[\"Do these sources agree on Einstein's contributions to quantum mechanics?\", given :evidence2: and :evidence4:]\n\nAssuming they agree, I can proceed to compile a detailed answer. If not, I might need to seek more sources or clarify the discrepancies.\n\nPlan: Compile a detailed answer based on the consistent information from :evidence2: and :evidence4:.\n:evidence6: = QAMachine[\"Provide a detailed explanation of Albert Einstein's contributions to quantum mechanics.\", given :evidence2: and :evidence4:]\n\nFinally, I can present this as the answer to the user's question.\n\nAnswer: :evidence6:\n\n**Final Output**\n\nPlan: Search for information about Einstein's contributions to quantum mechanics.\n:evidence0: = InfoSearch[\"Albert Einstein contributions to quantum mechanics\"]\n\nPlan: Select a relevant URL from :evidence0: and read its content.\n:evidence1: = URLReader[select URL from :evidence0:]\n\nPlan: Summarize Einstein's contributions to quantum mechanics based on :evidence1:.\n:evidence2: = QAMachine[\"What were Albert Einstein's key contributions to quantum mechanics?\", given :evidence1:]\n\nPlan: Search for additional information to confirm :evidence2:.\n:evidence3: = InfoSearch[\"Einstein's quantum theory\"]\n\nPlan: Select another URL from :evidence3: and read its content.\n:evidence4: = URLReader[select URL from :evidence3:]\n\nPlan: Compare :evidence2: and :evidence4: to ensure consistency.\n:evidence5: = QAMachine[\"Do these sources agree on Einstein's contributions to quantum mechanics?\", given :evidence2: and :evidence4:]\n\nPlan: Compile a detailed answer based on the consistent information from :evidence2: and :evidence4:.\n:evidence6: = QAMachine[\"Provide a detailed explanation of Albert Einstein's contributions to quantum mechanics.\", given :evidence2: and :evidence4:]\n\nAnswer: :evidence6:"
