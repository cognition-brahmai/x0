        "content": "Let's see. So, in this village, there are 100 houses, and every house has a dog. That means there are 100 dogs in total, right? Now, each of these dogs chases exactly one cat, and each cat is chased by exactly two dogs. I need to find out how many cats there are in the village.\n\nHmm, let me think about this. If every dog chases one cat, and there are 100 dogs, then initially, it might seem like there are 100 cats. But wait, the problem says that each cat is chased by exactly two dogs. So, that changes things.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's say the number of cats is C. Each cat is chased by exactly two dogs, so the total number of dog-to-cat relationships should be 2C, because each cat has two dogs chasing it.\n\nBut, we also know that there are 100 dogs, and each dog chases exactly one cat. So, the total number of dog-to-cat relationships is also equal to the number of dogs, which is 100.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n2C = 100\n\nNow, solving for C:\n\nC = 100 / 2\n\nC = 50\n\nSo, there are 50 cats in the village.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this. If there are 50 cats and each cat is chased by exactly two dogs, then the total number of dog-to-cat relationships is 50 cats * 2 dogs/cat = 100 relationships. And since there are 100 dogs, each chasing one cat, that also gives us 100 relationships. So, it matches.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. There are 50 cats in the village.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
