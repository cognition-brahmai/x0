        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that. Let's break down the task into smaller steps to make it manageable.\n\nFirst, we need to create a Java program that reads data from a CSV file. The CSV file contains information about employees, including their ID, name, age, and department. We'll need to read this file and store the data in an ArrayList of Employee objects.\n\nSo, the first step is to define the Employee class. This class should have properties for ID, name, age, and department, along with getters and setters for these properties.\n\nNext, we need to read the CSV file. To do this, we can use the Scanner class in Java, which allows us to read data from files. We'll open the file using a File object and then use a Scanner to read each line.\n\nEach line in the CSV file represents an employee's data, separated by commas. So, we'll split each line by commas to get the individual values and create an Employee object with these values. Then, we'll add this object to an ArrayList.\n\nOnce we have the data stored in the ArrayList, we need to implement methods to sort this list based on different criteria: employee ID, name, age, or department. To sort the list, we can use the Collections.sort() method in Java, along with a Comparator that defines the sorting order based on the desired property.\n\nFinally, we need to display the sorted list on the console. This involves iterating through the ArrayList and printing each Employee object's details.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the code. I'll probably create a main class, say EmployeeManager, which will have the main method and methods to read the file, sort the list, and display the list.\n\nI should also handle any potential exceptions that might occur when reading the file, such as the file not existing or having incorrect formatting.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline of the classes and methods:\n\n1. Employee class:\n\n- private int id;\n\n- private String name;\n\n- private int age;\n\n- private String department;\n\n- Getters and setters for all properties;\n\n- A constructor that takes id, name, age, and department as parameters and initializes the properties.\n\n2. EmployeeManager class:\n\n- private ArrayList<Employee> employees;\n\n- Constructor: initializes the employees list;\n\n- Method readCSV(String filename): reads the CSV file and populates the employees list;\n\n- Method sortById(): sorts the employees list by ID using Collections.sort() and a Comparator;\n\n- Method sortByName(): sorts the employees list by name using Collections.sort() and a Comparator;\n\n- Method sortByAge(): sorts the employees list by age using Collections.sort() and a Comparator;\n\n- Method sortByDepartment(): sorts the employees list by department using Collections.sort() and a Comparator;\n\n- Method display(): iterates through the employees list and prints each employee's details;\n\n- Main method: demonstrates reading the file, sorting, and displaying the list.\n\nI should also consider making the sorting methods more generic, perhaps using a single sort method that takes a Comparator as a parameter. This way, we can avoid code duplication.\n\nWait, yes, that's a good idea. We can have a single sort method that accepts a Comparator, and then define different Comparators for sorting by ID, name, age, and department.\n\nThis approach is more flexible and adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.\n\nSo, in the EmployeeManager class, I can have something like:\n\npublic void sort(Comparator<Employee> comparator) {\n\nCollections.sort(employees, comparator);\n\n}\n\nThen, I can define static Comparators in the EmployeeManager class or as separate classes implementing Comparator<Employee>.\n\nFor example:\n\npublic static Comparator<Employee> ID_COMPARATOR = Comparator.comparingInt(Employee::getId);\n\nSimilarly for name, age, and department.\n\nThis way, I can call sort(ID_COMPARATOR) to sort by ID, sort(NAME_COMPARATOR) to sort by name, and so on.\n\nThis seems efficient.\n\nNow, for reading the CSV file, I need to handle potential exceptions like FileNotFoundException or IOException.\n\nI should also handle cases where the CSV file has incorrect formatting, such as missing fields or extra commas.\n\nTo make the program more robust, I can add error handling to skip invalid lines or display error messages for specific issues.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider making the program user-friendly by allowing the user to specify the CSV file path and choose the sorting criteria.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's hardcode the file path and provide options in the main method to demonstrate sorting by different criteria.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement the readCSV method.\n\nI'll use a File object to represent the CSV file and a Scanner to read its contents.\n\nI'll open the file using new Scanner(new File(filename)), and then read each line using scanner.nextLine().\n\nFor each line, I'll split it by commas using split(\",\"), which will give me an array of strings.\n\nThen, I'll parse the ID and age as integers, and assign the name and department as strings.\n\nI'll create an Employee object with these values and add it to the employees list.\n\nHowever, I need to handle cases where the number of fields is incorrect. For example, if a line has only three fields instead of four, I should skip that line or handle it appropriately.\n\nAlso, I should handle any parsing exceptions when converting strings to integers for ID and age.\n\nTo handle this, I can add try-catch blocks inside the loop that reads each line.\n\nIf a line has incorrect formatting or parsing errors, I can skip it and print a warning message indicating the line number or the specific error.\n\nThis way, the program can continue processing the rest of the file without terminating abruptly.\n\nNow, for displaying the list, I'll iterate through the employees list and print each employee's details in a formatted manner.\n\nI can use System.out.println() to print each employee's ID, name, age, and department, separated by tabs or aligned properly.\n\nTo make it look neat, I can use String.format() to align the columns.\n\nFor example:\n\nSystem.out.printf(\"%-10d %-20s %-10d %-20s%n\", employee.getId(), employee.getName(), employee.getAge(), employee.getDepartment());\n\nThis will print the ID in a field of width 10, name in 20, age in 10, and department in 20, with left alignment.\n\nThis should make the output look tidy and organized.\n\nNow, let's consider how to sort the list based on different criteria.\n\nAs I thought earlier, I can define static Comparators for each sorting option.\n\nIn Java 8 and above, we can use Comparator.comparingInt() for integer properties and Comparator.comparing() for string properties.\n\nSo, for sorting by ID:\n\npublic static final Comparator<Employee> ID_COMPARATOR = Comparator.comparingInt(Employee::getId);\n\nSimilarly, for name:\n\npublic static final Comparator<Employee> NAME_COMPARATOR = Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName);\n\nFor age:\n\npublic static final Comparator<Employee> AGE_COMPARATOR = Comparator.comparingInt(Employee::getAge);\n\nFor department:\n\npublic static final Comparator<Employee> DEPARTMENT_COMPARATOR = Comparator.comparing(Employee::getDepartment);\n\nThen, in the sort method, I can accept any of these Comparators as a parameter.\n\npublic void sort(Comparator<Employee> comparator) {\n\nCollections.sort(employees, comparator);\n\n}\n\nThis way, I can sort the list by any of the properties by passing the corresponding Comparator.\n\nThis is clean and flexible.\n\nAlternatively, I could also make the employees list a SortedSet with a custom Comparator, but for simplicity, using ArrayList and sorting it as needed should suffice.\n\nNow, let's think about the main method.\n\nIn the main method, I'll create an instance of EmployeeManager, read the CSV file, sort the list by different criteria, and display the sorted list each time.\n\nFor demonstration purposes, I can sort the list by ID, then by name, then by age, and finally by department, displaying the list after each sort.\n\nThis will show that the sorting functions correctly.\n\nI should also ensure that the program doesn't have any memory leaks or resource leaks, such as forgetting to close the Scanner after reading the file.\n\nIn Java 7 and above, we can use try-with-resources to automatically close the Scanner.\n\nSo, instead of:\n\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(filename));\n\n// read the file\n\nscanner.close();\n\nI can do:\n\ntry (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(filename))) {\n\n// read the file\n\n}\n\nThis ensures that the scanner is closed automatically, even if an exception occurs.\n\nThis is a good practice to follow.\n\nAlso, I should handle the case where the CSV file doesn't exist or cannot be read.\n\nI can catch FileNotFoundException and display an appropriate error message.\n\nSimilarly, if there are parsing errors or invalid lines in the file, I can catch NumberFormatException or ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and handle them gracefully.\n\nNow, regarding the Employee class, I should ensure that the properties are properly encapsulated with private access modifiers and provide public getters and setters.\n\nI should also override the toString() method in the Employee class to provide a string representation of the employee object, which can be useful for debugging or printing.\n\nHowever, since I'm already planning to display the list in a formatted manner in the display() method, overriding toString() might not be necessary unless I need it elsewhere.\n\nBut, for completeness, I can still override it.\n\nNow, let's think about writing some test data for the CSV file.\n\nSuppose the CSV file is named \"employees.csv\" and has the following content:\n\n1,John Doe,30,HR\n\n2,Jane Smith,25,IT\n\n3,Michael Johnson,35,IT\n\n4,Emily Davis,28,HR\n\n5,David Brown,40,Finance\n\n6,Sarah Miller,32,Finance\n\n7,Joshua Garcia,29,HR\n\n8,Alexander Martinez,33,IT\n\n9,Samantha Thompson,27,HR\n\n10,Christopher White,31,IT\n\nThis should be enough data to test the sorting functionality.\n\nI can place this file in the project's directory or specify the full path in the readCSV method.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement the display method.\n\nI can iterate through the employees list and print each employee's details.\n\nUsing String.format() will help align the columns properly.\n\nI can also print column headers before printing the employee data to make it clearer.\n\nFor example:\n\nSystem.out.printf(\"%-10s %-20s %-10s %-20s%n\", \"ID\", \"Name\", \"Age\", \"Department\");\n\nThen, for each employee:\n\nSystem.out.printf(\"%-10d %-20s %-10d %-20s%n\", employee.getId(), employee.getName(), employee.getAge(), employee.getDepartment());\n\nThis will print a header row followed by the employee data, with each column aligned properly.\n\nNow, to make the program more interactive, I could allow the user to choose the sorting criteria via command-line input.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll hardcode the sorting demonstrations in the main method.\n\nSo, in the main method, I'll create an EmployeeManager object, read the CSV file, sort by ID, display, sort by name, display, and so on for age and department.\n\nThis will showcase the sorting functionality without adding extra complexity.\n\nNow, let's consider potential error scenarios and how to handle them.\n\n1. The CSV file doesn't exist or cannot be found.\n\n- Catch FileNotFoundException and display an error message.\n\n2. The CSV file has lines with incorrect number of fields.\n\n- When splitting the line by commas, check if the resulting array has exactly four elements.\n\n- If not, skip that line and print a warning message with the line number.\n\n3. The ID or age cannot be parsed as integers.\n\n- Catch NumberFormatException when parsing ID or age and skip that line, printing an error message.\n\n4. The CSV file is empty.\n\n- Check if the employees list is empty after reading the file and display a message accordingly.\n\n5. The CSV file has only invalid lines.\n\n- Similarly, check if the employees list is empty after reading and display an appropriate message.\n\nBy handling these cases, the program will be more robust and user-friendly.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement the sorting in a case-insensitive manner for string properties like name and department.\n\nIn Java, Comparators have methods like ignoringCase() to perform case-insensitive comparisons.\n\nSo, for sorting by name and department, I can use:\n\npublic static final Comparator<Employee> NAME_COMPARATOR = Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);\n\npublic static final Comparator<Employee> DEPARTMENT_COMPARATOR = Comparator.comparing(Employee::getDepartment, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);\n\nThis will ensure that the sorting is case-insensitive.\n\nThis is important because otherwise, sorting by name or department would be case-sensitive, which might not be desirable.\n\nNow, let's consider if there are any employees with the same value in the sorting criteria.\n\nFor example, multiple employees with the same name or department.\n\nIn such cases, the order of these employees relative to each other depends on the stability of the sorting algorithm.\n\nIn Java, Collections.sort() is stable, meaning that equal elements retain their relative order.\n\nSo, if two employees have the same name, their order relative to each other will be the same as in the original list.\n\nIf needed, I can chain comparators to define secondary sorting criteria.\n\nFor example, sort by department first, then by name within the same department.\n\nBut for this task, sorting by a single criterion should suffice.\n\nHowever, if time permits, I can optionally implement multi-level sorting as an extension.\n\nNow, let's think about how to organize the code.\n\nI'll create two classes: Employee and EmployeeManager.\n\nIn Employee.java:\n\n- Define the Employee class with private fields for ID, name, age, and department.\n\n- Provide getters and setters for all fields.\n\n- Optionally, override toString() for debugging.\n\nIn EmployeeManager.java:\n\n- Define the EmployeeManager class with an ArrayList<Employee> employees.\n\n- Implement the readCSV method to read the CSV file and populate the list.\n\n- Implement the sort method that takes a Comparator<Employee> and sorts the list.\n\n- Define static Comparators for each sorting criterion.\n\n- Implement the display method to print the list in a formatted way.\n\n- Implement the main method to demonstrate reading and sorting the list.\n\nI should also add comments to the code to explain each method's purpose and functionality.\n\nThis will make the code easier to understand and maintain.\n\nNow, let's consider writing some unit tests to verify the correctness of the program.\n\nFor example, I can create a small test CSV file with known data and check if the readCSV method correctly reads and parses the data.\n\nI can also test the sorting methods by sorting the list and verifying that it matches the expected order.\n\nHowever, since this is a simple program, I'll skip writing formal unit tests for now, but I'll add some assertions in the main method to check the sorting results.\n\nFor example, after sorting by ID, I can iterate through the list and ensure that each employee's ID is less than or equal to the next employee's ID.\n\nSimilarly for other sorting criteria.\n\nThis will provide some level of validation that the sorting is working correctly.\n\nNow, let's think about the file path for the CSV file.\n\nI can hardcode the file path in the readCSV method for simplicity, but it's better to accept it as a parameter.\n\nThis way, the user can specify different CSV files if needed.\n\nSo, I'll modify the readCSV method to accept the file path as a String parameter.\n\nIn the main method, I'll pass the file path to this method.\n\nI can also provide a default file path if no path is specified.\n\nAlternatively, I can make the file path a command-line argument.\n\nThis adds flexibility without complicating the program.\n\nNow, regarding the CSV file format, I'll assume that the file uses commas to separate fields and that there are no commas within the field values.\n\nIf the field values can contain commas, I'll need a more robust CSV parsing library, but for this simple case, splitting by commas should suffice.\n\nI should also consider handling leading or trailing spaces in the field values.\n\nI can trim the split values to remove any whitespace.\n\nThis will make the data cleaner.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing the readCSV method in detail.\n\nHere's a rough sketch:\n\npublic void readCSV(String filename) {\n\ntry (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(filename))) {\n\nint lineNum = 0;\n\nwhile (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n\nString line = scanner.nextLine();\n\nlineNum++;\n\nString[] parts = line.split(\",\");\n\nif (parts.length != 4) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Skipping invalid line \" + lineNum + \": \" + line);\n\ncontinue;\n\n}\n\ntry {\n\nint id = Integer.parseInt(parts[0].trim());\n\nString name = parts[1].trim();\n\nint age = Integer.parseInt(parts[2].trim());\n\nString department = parts[3].trim();\n\nEmployee employee = new Employee(id, name, age, department);\n\nemployees.add(employee);\n\n} catch (NumberFormatException e) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Error parsing line \" + lineNum + \": \" + line);\n\n}\n\n}\n\n} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"File not found: \" + filename);\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThis method reads the file line by line, splits each line into parts, checks if there are exactly four parts, trims them, parses the integers, and creates Employee objects.\n\nIt also handles cases where the line has an incorrect number of fields or parsing errors.\n\nNow, for the sort method:\n\npublic void sort(Comparator<Employee> comparator) {\n\nCollections.sort(employees, comparator);\n\n}\n\nAnd for the display method:\n\npublic void display() {\n\nSystem.out.printf(\"%-10s %-20s %-10s %-20s%n\", \"ID\", \"Name\", \"Age\", \"Department\");\n\nfor (Employee employee : employees) {\n\nSystem.out.printf(\"%-10d %-20s %-10d %-20s%n\", employee.getId(), employee.getName(), employee.getAge(), employee.getDepartment());\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThis will print the list in a formatted table.\n\nNow, in the main method, I'll demonstrate reading the file and sorting by different criteria.\n\nHere's a rough sketch:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\nEmployeeManager manager = new EmployeeManager();\n\nmanager.readCSV(\"employees.csv\");\n\nmanager.sort(ID_COMPARATOR);\n\nmanager.display();\n\nmanager.sort(NAME_COMPARATOR);\n\nmanager.display();\n\nmanager.sort(AGE_COMPARATOR);\n\nmanager.display();\n\nmanager.sort(DEPARTMENT_COMPARATOR);\n\nmanager.display();\n\n}\n\nThis will read the file, sort by ID, display, sort by name, display, and so on.\n\nNow, to make the output clearer, I can print headers before each display, indicating the sorting criterion used.\n\nFor example:\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Sorted by ID:\");\n\nmanager.sort(ID_COMPARATOR);\n\nmanager.display();\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Sorted by Name:\");\n\nmanager.sort(NAME_COMPARATOR);\n\nmanager.display();\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis will make it clear to the user which sorting is being applied each time.\n\nNow, let's think about the overall structure of the program.\n\nI'll have two classes: Employee and EmployeeManager.\n\nEmployee.java:\n\n- Private fields: id, name, age, department.\n\n- Public getters and setters.\n\n- Constructor that initializes the fields.\n\nEmployeeManager.java:\n\n- Private field: ArrayList<Employee> employees.\n\n- Constructor that initializes the list.\n\n- readCSV(String filename): reads the CSV file and populates the list.\n\n- sort(Comparator<Employee> comparator): sorts the list using the provided comparator.\n\n- Static Comparators for ID, name, age, and department.\n\n- display(): prints the list in a formatted manner.\n\n- main method: demonstrates reading the file and sorting by different criteria.\n\nI should also ensure that the ArrayList is initialized in the constructor of EmployeeManager.\n\npublic EmployeeManager() {\n\nemployees = new ArrayList<>();\n\n}\n\nThis prevents null pointer exceptions when adding employees.\n\nNow, let's consider if there are any enhancements or additional features I can add.\n\nOne possible enhancement is to handle CSV files with headers.\n\nSometimes, CSV files have a header row that specifies the column names.\n\nI can modify the readCSV method to skip the first line if it's a header.\n\nTo do this, I can add a boolean parameter to indicate whether the file has a header.\n\nFor example:\n\npublic void readCSV(String filename, boolean hasHeader) {\n\ntry (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(filename))) {\n\nif (hasHeader) {\n\nscanner.nextLine(); // Skip header line\n\n}\n\nint lineNum = 1;\n\nwhile (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n\nString line = scanner.nextLine();\n\nlineNum++;\n\n// Rest of the reading logic\n\n}\n\n} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"File not found: \" + filename);\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThen, in the main method, I can call readCSV(\"employees.csv\", true);\n\nThis makes the program more flexible.\n\nAnother enhancement could be to allow the user to specify the sorting order (ascending or descending).\n\nI can modify the sort method to accept an additional parameter for the sorting order.\n\nFor example:\n\npublic void sort(Comparator<Employee> comparator, boolean descending) {\n\nif (descending) {\n\nCollections.sort(employees, comparator.reversed());\n\n} else {\n\nCollections.sort(employees, comparator);\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThen, I can define static Comparators with both ascending and descending orders.\n\nBut for this task, sorting in ascending order should suffice.\n\nNow, let's think about error handling in more detail.\n\nWhen parsing integers for ID and age, I'm catching NumberFormatException.\n\nBut I should also handle cases where the age is negative or zero, which might not make sense.\n\nI can add checks to ensure that age is a positive integer.\n\nSimilarly, ID should be a positive integer and unique, but enforcing uniqueness might be overkill for this simple program.\n\nFor age, I can add a check like:\n\nint age = Integer.parseInt(parts[2].trim());\n\nif (age <= 0) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Invalid age in line \" + lineNum + \": \" + line);\n\ncontinue;\n\n}\n\nThis ensures that only positive ages are accepted.\n\nSimilarly, for ID, I can check if it's positive.\n\nHowever, in many organizations, employee IDs can be negative or zero, so it's better to assume that IDs can be any integer.\n\nBut for age, it's reasonable to require it to be positive.\n\nNow, let's consider handling empty strings or null values in the CSV file.\n\nIf any of the fields are empty or null, I should handle them appropriately.\n\nFor example, if the name is empty, I can skip that line or assign a default value.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll assume that all fields are present and non-empty.\n\nIf a field is empty after trimming, I'll treat it as invalid and skip that line.\n\nTo do this, I can add checks like:\n\nif (id <= 0 || name.isEmpty() || age <= 0 || department.isEmpty()) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Invalid data in line \" + lineNum + \": \" + line);\n\ncontinue;\n\n}\n\nThis ensures that all required fields are present and valid.\n\nNow, let's think about internationalization.\n\nIf the program needs to handle non-English names or departments, I should ensure that the program can handle Unicode characters properly.\n\nIn Java, Strings are Unicode by default, so this should not be an issue.\n\nNow, regarding the performance, since we're dealing with a small CSV file (assuming less than a few thousand employees), performance should not be a concern.\n\nHowever, if the file is large, using a more efficient CSV parsing library like OpenCSV could be beneficial.\n\nBut for this simple case, using Scanner and split should be sufficient.\n\nNow, let's consider writing the actual code.\n\nFirst, the Employee class:\n\npublic class Employee {\n\nprivate int id;\n\nprivate String name;\n\nprivate int age;\n\nprivate String department;\n\n// Constructor\n\npublic Employee(int id, String name, int age, String department) {\n\nthis.id = id;\n\nthis.name = name;\n\nthis.age = age;\n\nthis.department = department;\n\n}\n\n// Getters and setters\n\npublic int getId() {\n\nreturn id;\n\n}\n\npublic void setId(int id) {\n\nthis.id = id;\n\n}\n\npublic String getName() {\n\nreturn name;\n\n}\n\npublic void setName(String name) {\n\nthis.name = name;\n\n}\n\npublic int getAge() {\n\nreturn age;\n\n}\n\npublic void setAge(int age) {\n\nthis.age = age;\n\n}\n\npublic String getDepartment() {\n\nreturn department;\n\n}\n\npublic void setDepartment(String department) {\n\nthis.department = department;\n\n}\n\n// Optional: override toString() for debugging\n\n@Override\n\npublic String toString() {\n\nreturn \"Employee[id=\" + id + \", name=\" + name + \", age=\" + age + \", department=\" + department + \"]\";\n\n}\n\n}\n\nNext, the EmployeeManager class:\n\nimport java.io.File;\n\nimport java.io.FileNotFoundException;\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\n\nimport java.util.Collections;\n\nimport java.util.Comparator;\n\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class EmployeeManager {\n\nprivate ArrayList<Employee> employees;\n\npublic EmployeeManager() {\n\nemployees = new ArrayList<>();\n\n}\n\npublic void readCSV(String filename, boolean hasHeader) {\n\ntry (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(filename))) {\n\nif (hasHeader) {\n\nscanner.nextLine(); // Skip header line\n\n}\n\nint lineNum = 1;\n\nwhile (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n\nString line = scanner.nextLine();\n\nlineNum++;\n\nString[] parts = line.split(\",\");\n\nif (parts.length != 4) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Skipping invalid line \" + lineNum + \": \" + line);\n\ncontinue;\n\n}\n\ntry {\n\nint id = Integer.parseInt(parts[0].trim());\n\nString name = parts[1].trim();\n\nint age = Integer.parseInt(parts[2].trim());\n\nString department = parts[3].trim();\n\nif (name.isEmpty() || department.isEmpty() || age <= 0) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Invalid data in line \" + lineNum + \": \" + line);\n\ncontinue;\n\n}\n\nEmployee employee = new Employee(id, name, age, department);\n\nemployees.add(employee);\n\n} catch (NumberFormatException e) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Error parsing line \" + lineNum + \": \" + line);\n\n}\n\n}\n\n} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"File not found: \" + filename);\n\n}\n\n}\n\npublic void sort(Comparator<Employee> comparator) {\n\nCollections.sort(employees, comparator);\n\n}\n\n// Define static Comparators\n\npublic static final Comparator<Employee> ID_COMPARATOR = Comparator.comparingInt(Employee::getId);\n\npublic static final Comparator<Employee> NAME_COMPARATOR = Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);\n\npublic static final Comparator<Employee> AGE_COMPARATOR = Comparator.comparingInt(Employee::getAge);\n\npublic static final Comparator<Employee> DEPARTMENT_COMPARATOR = Comparator.comparing(Employee::getDepartment, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);\n\npublic void display() {\n\nSystem.out.printf(\"%-10s %-20s %-10s %-20s%n\", \"ID\", \"Name\", \"Age\", \"Department\");\n\nfor (Employee employee : employees) {\n\nSystem.out.printf(\"%-10d %-20s %-10d %-20s%n\", employee.getId(), employee.getName(), employee.getAge(), employee.getDepartment());\n\n}\n\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\nEmployeeManager manager = new EmployeeManager();\n\nmanager.readCSV(\"employees.csv\", true);\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Sorted by ID:\");\n\nmanager.sort(ID_COMPARATOR);\n\nmanager.display();\n\nSystem.out.println(\"\\nSorted by Name:\");\n\nmanager.sort(NAME_COMPARATOR);\n\nmanager.display();\n\nSystem.out.println(\"\\nSorted by Age:\");\n\nmanager.sort(AGE_COMPARATOR);\n\nmanager.display();\n\nSystem.out.println(\"\\nSorted by Department:\");\n\nmanager.sort(DEPARTMENT_COMPARATOR);\n\nmanager.display();\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThis should cover all the requirements specified in the task.\n\nI've included error handling for missing files, invalid lines, and parsing errors.\n\nThe program reads the CSV file, sorts the employee list by different criteria, and displays the sorted list in a formatted manner.\n\nI've also made the sorting case-insensitive for string properties.\n\nAdditionally, I've provided options to handle CSV files with headers.\n\nThis should be a complete and functional solution.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Java program that reads employee data from a CSV file and allows sorting and displaying this data based on different criteria.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Employee Class**: Define a class to hold employee data with fields for ID, name, age, and department.\n2. **EmployeeManager Class**: \n   - Read the CSV file and store employee data in an `ArrayList`.\n   - Implement sorting methods for ID, name, age, and department.\n   - Display the sorted list in a formatted manner.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.FileNotFoundException;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Collections;\nimport java.util.Comparator;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\nclass Employee {\n    private int id;\n    private String name;\n    private int age;\n    private String department;\n\n    public Employee(int id, String name, int age, String department) {\n        this.id = id;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = age;\n        this.department = department;\n    }\n\n    public int getId() {\n        return id;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public int getAge() {\n        return age;\n    }\n\n    public String getDepartment() {\n        return department;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"Employee[id=\" + id + \", name=\" + name + \", age=\" + age + \", department=\" + department + \"]\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class EmployeeManager {\n    private ArrayList<Employee> employees;\n\n    public EmployeeManager() {\n        employees = new ArrayList<>();\n    }\n\n    public void readCSV(String filename, boolean hasHeader) {\n        try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(filename))) {\n            if (hasHeader) {\n                scanner.nextLine(); // Skip header line\n            }\n            int lineNum = 1;\n            while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n                String line = scanner.nextLine();\n                lineNum++;\n                String[] parts = line.split(\",\");\n                if (parts.length != 4) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Skipping invalid line \" + lineNum + \": \" + line);\n                    continue;\n                }\n                try {\n                    int id = Integer.parseInt(parts[0].trim());\n                    String name = parts[1].trim();\n                    int age = Integer.parseInt(parts[2].trim());\n                    String department = parts[3].trim();\n                    if (name.isEmpty() || department.isEmpty() || age <= 0) {\n                        System.out.println(\"Invalid data in line \" + lineNum + \": \" + line);\n                        continue;\n                    }\n                    Employee employee = new Employee(id, name, age, department);\n                    employees.add(employee);\n                } catch (NumberFormatException e) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Error parsing line \" + lineNum + \": \" + line);\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n            System.out.println(\"File not found: \" + filename);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void sort(Comparator<Employee> comparator) {\n        Collections.sort(employees, comparator);\n    }\n\n    public static final Comparator<Employee> ID_COMPARATOR = Comparator.comparingInt(Employee::getId);\n    public static final Comparator<Employee> NAME_COMPARATOR = Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);\n    public static final Comparator<Employee> AGE_COMPARATOR = Comparator.comparingInt(Employee::getAge);\n    public static final Comparator<Employee> DEPARTMENT_COMPARATOR = Comparator.comparing(Employee::getDepartment, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);\n\n    public void display() {\n        System.out.printf(\"%-10s %-20s %-10s %-20s%n\", \"ID\", \"Name\", \"Age\", \"Department\");\n        for (Employee employee : employees) {\n            System.out.printf(\"%-10d %-20s %-10d %-20s%n\", employee.getId(), employee.getName(), employee.getAge(), employee.getDepartment());\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        EmployeeManager manager = new EmployeeManager();\n        manager.readCSV(\"employees.csv\", true);\n        System.out.println(\"Sorted by ID:\");\n        manager.sort(ID_COMPARATOR);\n        manager.display();\n        System.out.println(\"\\nSorted by Name:\");\n        manager.sort(NAME_COMPARATOR);\n        manager.display();\n        System.out.println(\"\\nSorted by Age:\");\n        manager.sort(AGE_COMPARATOR);\n        manager.display();\n        System.out.println(\"\\nSorted by Department:\");\n        manager.sort(DEPARTMENT_COMPARATOR);\n        manager.display();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Employee Class**: Holds employee data with getter methods.\n2. **EmployeeManager Class**:\n   - **readCSV**: Reads the CSV file, skipping headers if specified, and parses lines into `Employee` objects.\n   - **sort**: Sorts the list using the provided `Comparator`.\n   - **display**: Prints the list in a formatted table.\n   - **Main Method**: Demonstrates reading the file and sorting/displaying data by ID, name, age, and department.\n\nThis approach ensures the program is robust, handling errors and invalid data gracefully while providing clear, formatted output."
