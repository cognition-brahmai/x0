        "content": "The primary function of chlorophyll in the process of photosynthesis is to capture light energy from the sun. So, the correct answer is B. It captures light energy from the sun.\n\nTo elaborate a bit, chlorophyll is a green pigment found in the chloroplasts of plants and algae. It plays a crucial role in photosynthesis by absorbing light energy, primarily in the blue and red regions of the spectrum, and converting it into chemical energy. This energy is then used to power the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.\n\nWhile options A, C, and D are related to photosynthesis, they describe different aspects of the process:\n\n- A. Absorbing water from the soil is primarily the function of the plant's root system, not chlorophyll.\n\n- C. Releasing oxygen into the atmosphere is a byproduct of photosynthesis, but it's not the primary function of chlorophyll itself.\n\n- D. Converting carbon dioxide into glucose is part of the Calvin cycle in photosynthesis, which is powered by the energy captured by chlorophyll, but again, it's not the direct function of chlorophyll.\n\nSo, to summarize, chlorophyll's main role is to capture light energy, which is then used in the photosynthetic process to produce glucose and oxygen."
