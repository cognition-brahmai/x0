        "content": "So the factory makes 1200 widgets every day, and each one has a 2% chance of being defective. I need to find out the expected number of defective widgets per day. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that \"expected value\" in probability is like the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents. So, in this case, it's the average number of defective widgets I'd expect if the factory produces 1200 widgets every day over a long period.\n\nEach widget has a 2% chance of being defective. That means for each widget, the probability of being defective is 0.02. Since the widgets are independent of each other, I can probably just multiply the total number of widgets by the probability of a single widget being defective to get the expected number of defective widgets.\n\nSo, expected number of defective widgets = total widgets per day \u00d7 probability of a widget being defective.\n\nThat would be 1200 \u00d7 0.02.\n\nLet me calculate that: 1200 \u00d7 0.02 = 24.\n\nSo, the expected number of defective widgets per day is 24.\n\nBut wait, is there a better way to look at this? Maybe using the binomial distribution? Because each widget can be either defective or not, which sounds like a binomial process.\n\nIn a binomial distribution, the expected value is given by n \u00d7 p, where n is the number of trials (widgets) and p is the probability of success (defective in this case).\n\nSo, again, that's 1200 \u00d7 0.02 = 24.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this. Is there any chance that the defectiveness of one widget affects another? If they are independent, which the problem seems to imply, then the binomial approach is correct.\n\nAlso, 2% is a relatively small probability, and 1200 is a large number, so the distribution of the number of defective widgets would be approximately normal, but since we're only looking for the expected value, that doesn't matter. The expected value remains n \u00d7 p regardless of the distribution shape.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that on average, out of every 100 widgets, 2 are defective. So, for 1200 widgets, the number of defectives would be (1200 / 100) \u00d7 2 = 12 \u00d7 2 = 24.\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nJust to make sure I'm not missing anything, let's consider if the factory's production rate affects the defect rate. The problem says each widget has a 2% chance of being defective, regardless of how many are produced, so the production rate doesn't affect the defect probability per widget.\n\nTherefore, the expected number of defective widgets per day is indeed 24.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
