        "content": "The sitar, a prominent instrument in Indian classical music, was popularized in the Western world by George Harrison of The Beatles. Harrison developed an interest in Indian music and the sitar during the production of the Beatles' album \"Rubber Soul\" in 1965. He took lessons from sitar maestro Ravi Shankar and incorporated the sitar into several Beatles songs, including \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\" and \"Within You Without You.\" This introduction to the sitar by Harrison played a significant role in bringing Indian music and culture to a broader international audience in the 1960s."
