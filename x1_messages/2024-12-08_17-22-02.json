        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here. It says that in a certain city, 60% of the population is male and 40% is female. Among the males, 25% are married, and among the females, 30% are married. I need to find out what percentage of the total population is married.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. I have the percentages of males and females in the population, and the percentages of married individuals within each group. I need to find the overall percentage of married people in the entire population.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to assume a total population number to make the calculations easier. Let's assume the total population is 1000 people. That way, percentages will be easy to work with.\n\nSo, total population = 1000 people.\n\nNow, 60% of these are male, so:\n\nMales = 60% of 1000 = 0.60 * 1000 = 600 males.\n\nFemales = 40% of 1000 = 0.40 * 1000 = 400 females.\n\nNext, among males, 25% are married:\n\nMarried males = 25% of 600 = 0.25 * 600 = 150 males.\n\nAmong females, 30% are married:\n\nMarried females = 30% of 400 = 0.30 * 400 = 120 females.\n\nNow, the total number of married people in the population is the sum of married males and married females:\n\nTotal married = 150 + 120 = 270 people.\n\nTo find the percentage of the total population that is married, I divide the number of married people by the total population and multiply by 100:\n\nPercentage married = (270 / 1000) * 100 = 27%.\n\nSo, 27% of the total population is married.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this without assuming a total population? Maybe using proportions directly.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total population as P.\n\nMales = 60% of P = 0.60P.\n\nFemales = 40% of P = 0.40P.\n\nMarried males = 25% of males = 0.25 * 0.60P = 0.15P.\n\nMarried females = 30% of females = 0.30 * 0.40P = 0.12P.\n\nTotal married = married males + married females = 0.15P + 0.12P = 0.27P.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the total population that is married is 0.27P / P * 100% = 27%.\n\nSo, whether I assume a specific population or use variables, I end up with the same answer.\n\nI think 27% is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{27\\%} \\]"
