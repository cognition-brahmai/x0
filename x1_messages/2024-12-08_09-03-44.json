        "content": "So, I've got this problem here about a spider spinning a web. Every day, the spider uses 50 strands of silk, and each strand is 2 meters long. I need to find out how many kilometers of silk the spider uses in a month, assuming a month has 30 days. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how much silk the spider uses in one day. Since there are 50 strands and each is 2 meters long, I can multiply the number of strands by the length of each strand to get the total length of silk used per day.\n\nSo, 50 strands \u00d7 2 meters/strand = 100 meters per day.\n\nAlright, that makes sense. Now, I need to find out how much silk is used in 30 days. So, I'll multiply the daily usage by the number of days in the month.\n\n100 meters/day \u00d7 30 days = 3000 meters.\n\nNow, the question asks for the answer in kilometers, but I have meters. I know that 1 kilometer equals 1000 meters, so to convert meters to kilometers, I need to divide by 1000.\n\n3000 meters \u00f7 1000 = 3 kilometers.\n\nSo, the spider uses 3 kilometers of silk in a month.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I didn't miss anything. The spider uses 50 strands each day, each 2 meters long, so 50 \u00d7 2 = 100 meters per day. Over 30 days, that's 100 \u00d7 30 = 3000 meters. Converting to kilometers: 3000 \u00f7 1000 = 3 kilometers. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll verify the units at each step. Starting with strands and meters per strand, multiplying them gives meters per day, which is correct. Then, multiplying by the number of days gives total meters in the month. Finally, converting meters to kilometers by dividing by 1000 is the right conversion factor. So, everything checks out.\n\nI think that's the answer: 3 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
