        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this problem about a farmer who has chickens and cows, and he counts 30 heads and 86 legs. I need to figure out how many chickens there are.\n\nFirst, I know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each. Also, each animal has one head. So, if there are 30 heads, that means there are 30 animals in total, right?\n\nLet me denote the number of chickens as \"c\" and the number of cows as \"k\". So, I can write two equations based on the information given.\n\nThe first equation would be for the heads:\n\nc + k = 30\n\nBecause each animal has one head, and there are 30 heads in total.\n\nThe second equation would be for the legs:\n\n2c + 4k = 86\n\nBecause chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and there are 86 legs in total.\n\nNow, I need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of c and k.\n\nI can start by solving the first equation for one of the variables, say c:\n\nc = 30 - k\n\nThen, substitute this expression for c into the second equation:\n\n2(30 - k) + 4k = 86\n\nNow, let's simplify that:\n\n60 - 2k + 4k = 86\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n60 + 2k = 86\n\nNow, subtract 60 from both sides:\n\n2k = 26\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2:\n\nk = 13\n\nSo, there are 13 cows.\n\nNow, plug this value back into the first equation to find c:\n\nc = 30 - 13 = 17\n\nTherefore, there are 17 chickens.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.\n\nIf there are 17 chickens with 2 legs each, that's 17 * 2 = 34 legs.\n\nAnd there are 13 cows with 4 legs each, that's 13 * 4 = 52 legs.\n\nTotal legs: 34 + 52 = 86, which matches the given number.\n\nAlso, 17 + 13 = 30 heads, which also matches.\n\nSo, the answer should be 17 chickens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]"
