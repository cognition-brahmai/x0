        "content": "Let's see. The car rental company has 50 cars, and each car is rented out for an average of 20 days per month. We need to find out how many total rental days the company generates in a year.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many rental days there are per month for the entire fleet. Since each car is rented for 20 days per month, and there are 50 cars, the total rental days per month would be 50 cars times 20 days, which is 1,000 rental days per month.\n\nNow, to find out the annual total, I need to multiply the monthly rental days by the number of months in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so 1,000 rental days per month times 12 months would give us 12,000 rental days per year.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations. 50 cars times 20 days is indeed 1,000 rental days per month. And 1,000 per month times 12 months is 12,000. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if all cars are always available for rental or if there are any downtime periods for maintenance or other reasons. The problem says the fleet has 50 cars and each is rented for an average of 20 days per month, so I think it's safe to assume that's the average rental days per car.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that there are no leap years or extra days to consider. Since we're dealing with a standard 12-month year, and the average is given per month, I don't think I need to worry about leap years.\n\nSo, my final answer is 12,000 rental days per year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12000} \\]"
