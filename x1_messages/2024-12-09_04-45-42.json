The constructivist theory, on the other hand, posits that state actions are driven by historically formed identities. The Marxist theory views global politics as a struggle between classes, with the capitalist class exploiting the working class. Based on these descriptions, which theory would most likely view international organizations as having limited influence due to the overriding power of sovereign states?\nA. Realism\nB.

        "content": "Given the descriptions provided, the theory that would most likely view international organizations as having limited influence due to the overriding power of sovereign states is realism. Realism emphasizes the self-interest and state security of individual nations, suggesting that states are the primary actors in international relations and that they act to maximize their own power and security. In this worldview, international organizations may have some role, but their influence is constrained by the sovereignty and autonomy of individual states, which prioritize their own interests above those of the organization.\n\nLiberalism, in contrast, places greater importance on cooperation and democracy, suggesting that international organizations can facilitate collaboration and collective action among states. Constructivism focuses on how historically formed identities shape state actions, implying that international organizations could influence state behavior through social constructs and shared norms. Marxism views global politics through the lens of class struggle, with the capitalist class exploiting the working class, and may see international organizations as tools of capitalist domination rather than as limited in influence due to state sovereignty.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, realism is the theory that would most likely view international organizations as having limited influence because of the overriding power of sovereign states.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
