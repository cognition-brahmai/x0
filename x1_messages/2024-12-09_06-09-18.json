        "content": "Let's see. There are 50 people in the room. Half of them are wearing glasses, so that's 25 people with glasses. One-third are wearing hats, which would be about 16.67, but since we can't have a fraction of a person, let's calculate it exactly: 50 divided by 3 is 16 and 2/3, but since we're dealing with people, maybe it's 16 or 17. Wait, but 50 divided by 3 is exactly 16 and 2/3, so perhaps the problem expects us to round or consider it as 16 or 17. But maybe it's better to work with fractions here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes exact divisions, so maybe it's okay to have a fraction. But that seems odd for counting people. Maybe I should consider that the numbers given are exact: half wearing glasses, one-third wearing hats, and one-sixth wearing both.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\n- Total people, T = 50\n\n- Wearing glasses, G = T / 2 = 25\n\n- Wearing hats, H = T / 3 = 50 / 3 \u2248 16.666, but let's keep it as 50/3\n\n- Wearing both glasses and hats, B = T / 6 = 50 / 6 \u2248 8.333, but keep it as 50/6\n\nNow, we need to find the number of people not wearing either glasses or hats. That would be the total people minus those wearing glasses or hats.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\nPeople wearing glasses or hats = G + H - B\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n= 25 + 50/3 - 50/6\n\nTo add these, let's find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 1, 3, and 6 is 6.\n\nConvert each term:\n\n25 = 25 * 6/6 = 150/6\n\n50/3 = 50 * 2/6 = 100/6\n\n50/6 remains 50/6\n\nSo, 150/6 + 100/6 - 50/6 = (150 + 100 - 50)/6 = 200/6 = 100/3 \u2248 33.333\n\nBut again, we have a fraction, which is odd for counting people. Maybe there's an error in the assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider only whole numbers, so maybe it's better to round or consider the closest integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of people should be such that when divided by 2, 3, and 6, we get whole numbers. But 50 divided by 3 is not a whole number, nor is 50 divided by 6.\n\nWait a minute, 50 is not divisible by 3 or by 6. Maybe the problem has a mistake, or perhaps it's expecting us to work with fractions, which seems unlikely for this type of problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem means that half of them are wearing glasses, one-third are wearing hats, and one-sixth are wearing both, and we need to find those wearing neither, accepting fractional people as a mathematical abstraction.\n\nIn that case, proceeding as above:\n\nPeople wearing glasses or hats = 25 + 50/3 - 50/6 = 100/3 \u2248 33.333\n\nThen, people wearing neither = total - (glasses or hats) = 50 - 100/3 = (150/3 - 100/3) = 50/3 \u2248 16.666\n\nSo, approximately 16.666 people are not wearing either. But again, we can't have a fraction of a person.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider only whole numbers, so maybe it's 16 or 17 people.\n\nBut given that the divisions don't result in whole numbers, maybe the problem is to be interpreted differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be solved using variables, assuming that the numbers must be integers.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the total number of people is T, and T is such that T/2, T/3, and T/6 are all integers. In that case, T must be a multiple of 6.\n\nBut in the problem, T is given as 50, which is not a multiple of 6, so perhaps there's an inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to find the number of people not wearing either in terms of fractions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup, and it should have a total number of people that is a multiple of 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should consider that the number of people wearing both is not exactly T/6, but rather the number that wear both is the intersection of those wearing glasses and those wearing hats.\n\nBut given the problem states one-sixth are wearing both, perhaps we need to proceed with the given fractions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the problem in terms of sets.\n\nLet G be the set of people wearing glasses, H be the set wearing hats.\n\nWe have:\n\n|G| = T/2 = 25\n\n|H| = T/3 \u2248 16.666\n\n|G \u2229 H| = T/6 \u2248 8.333\n\nThen, |G \u222a H| = |G| + |H| - |G \u2229 H| = 25 + 50/3 - 50/6 = 100/3 \u2248 33.333\n\nThen, the number not wearing either is T - |G \u222a H| = 50 - 100/3 = 50/3 \u2248 16.666\n\nGiven that we can't have a fraction of a person, perhaps the answer is 17 people, rounding up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to express the answer as a fraction, 50/3, or approximately 16.67 people.\n\nBut since it's unusual to have a fraction of a person, maybe the problem is to be interpreted differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the number of people not wearing either, accepting that it's a fraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an error in the problem, and the total number of people should be a multiple of 6 to avoid fractions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the number of people wearing hats is rounded to the nearest whole number, which would be 17, and similarly for those wearing both, which would be 8 or 9.\n\nBut that seems too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be solved using algebra, without plugging in numbers.\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\nLet T be the total number of people.\n\nNumber wearing glasses, G = T/2\n\nNumber wearing hats, H = T/3\n\nNumber wearing both, B = T/6\n\nThen, number wearing glasses or hats = G + H - B = T/2 + T/3 - T/6\n\nFinding a common denominator, which is 6:\n\n= (3T/6 + 2T/6 - T/6) = (3T + 2T - T)/6 = 4T/6 = 2T/3\n\nSo, people wearing glasses or hats = 2T/3\n\nThen, people wearing neither = T - 2T/3 = T/3\n\nSo, the number of people not wearing either is T/3.\n\nGiven that T = 50, then T/3 = 50/3 \u2248 16.666\n\nSo, approximately 16.666 people are not wearing either.\n\nAlternatively, expressing it as a fraction, it's 50/3 people.\n\nBut since we can't have a fraction of a person, perhaps the answer is 17 people, rounding to the nearest whole number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to leave the answer as a fraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an error in the problem setup, and the total number of people should be a multiple of 3 to avoid fractions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted in a different way.\n\nGiven that all the above attempts lead to the same fraction, perhaps the answer is indeed 50/3, which is approximately 16.67 people.\n\nBut since we can't have a fraction of a person, maybe the problem is to be rounded to the nearest whole number, which is 17.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that the number of people wearing neither is 16 or 17, but since it's a fraction, perhaps it's 16.\n\nBut given that 50/3 is approximately 16.666, rounding to the nearest whole number would be 17.\n\nTherefore, the number of people not wearing either glasses or hats is 17.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]"
