        "content": "In Norse mythology, the mighty hammer wielded by Thor, the god of thunder, is called Mjolnir. This iconic weapon is not only a symbol of Thor's power but also plays a crucial role in various mythological stories. Mjolnir is known for its ability to return to Thor's hand after being thrown and for its devastating impact when used in battle against Thor's enemies, particularly the jotnar (giants). The hammer also has the power to create thunder and lightning, further emphasizing Thor's connection to storms and weather phenomena."
