        "content": "Let's tackle this park planning problem step by step. So, we've got a 10-acre park to develop with basketball courts, tennis courts, and playgrounds. Each facility takes up a different amount of space: basketball courts need 0.5 acres, tennis courts need 1 acre, and playgrounds need 2 acres. Also, at least 30% of the park should be left as open green space. Our goal is to figure out how many of each facility can be built while keeping that green space requirement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the space constraints. The park is 10 acres total, and at least 30% should be green space. So, let's calculate how much area that is.\n\n30% of 10 acres is:\n\n0.30 * 10 = 3 acres\n\nSo, at least 3 acres must be left as open green space. That means the remaining area available for facilities is:\n\n10 acres - 3 acres = 7 acres\n\nNow, we need to allocate this 7 acres among basketball courts, tennis courts, and playgrounds.\n\nLet's denote:\n\nB = number of basketball courts\n\nT = number of tennis courts\n\nP = number of playgrounds\n\nEach basketball court takes 0.5 acres, so B courts will take 0.5B acres.\n\nEach tennis court takes 1 acre, so T courts will take 1T acres.\n\nEach playground takes 2 acres, so P playgrounds will take 2P acres.\n\nThe total area occupied by facilities should not exceed 7 acres:\n\n0.5B + 1T + 2P \u2264 7\n\nThis is our main constraint.\n\nNow, we need to find non-negative integer values for B, T, and P that satisfy this inequality.\n\nSince we're dealing with whole facilities, B, T, and P must be integers greater than or equal to zero.\n\nMoreover, it's likely that the city wants to maximize the number of facilities or provide a good mix of them. However, since the problem doesn't specify an objective, I'll assume we're to find all possible combinations that meet the space constraints.\n\nLet's consider different scenarios by varying the number of playgrounds, since they take the most space.\n\n**Scenario 1: P = 0**\n\nIf there are no playgrounds, the inequality becomes:\n\n0.5B + 1T \u2264 7\n\nIn this case, we can have various combinations of B and T.\n\nFor example:\n\n- B = 0, T = 7 (since 0.5*0 + 1*7 = 7)\n\n- B = 2, T = 6 (0.5*2 + 1*6 = 1 + 6 = 7)\n\n- B = 4, T = 5 (0.5*4 + 1*5 = 2 + 5 = 7)\n\n- B = 6, T = 4 (0.5*6 + 1*4 = 3 + 4 = 7)\n\n- B = 8, T = 3 (0.5*8 + 1*3 = 4 + 3 = 7)\n\n- B = 10, T = 2 (0.5*10 + 1*2 = 5 + 2 = 7)\n\n- B = 12, T = 1 (0.5*12 + 1*1 = 6 + 1 = 7)\n\n- B = 14, T = 0 (0.5*14 + 1*0 = 7 + 0 = 7)\n\nAdditionally, we can have combinations where 0.5B + T is less than 7, allowing for some unused space.\n\n**Scenario 2: P = 1**\n\nIf there is one playground, it takes 2 acres, so the remaining area for other facilities is:\n\n7 - 2 = 5 acres\n\nThus:\n\n0.5B + 1T \u2264 5\n\nAgain, various combinations:\n\n- B = 0, T = 5 (0.5*0 + 1*5 = 0 + 5 = 5)\n\n- B = 2, T = 4 (0.5*2 + 1*4 = 1 + 4 = 5)\n\n- B = 4, T = 3 (0.5*4 + 1*3 = 2 + 3 = 5)\n\n- B = 6, T = 2 (0.5*6 + 1*2 = 3 + 2 = 5)\n\n- B = 8, T = 1 (0.5*8 + 1*1 = 4 + 1 = 5)\n\n- B = 10, T = 0 (0.5*10 + 1*0 = 5 + 0 = 5)\n\n**Scenario 3: P = 2**\n\nTwo playgrounds take 4 acres, leaving:\n\n7 - 4 = 3 acres\n\nSo:\n\n0.5B + 1T \u2264 3\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- B = 0, T = 3 (0 + 3 = 3)\n\n- B = 2, T = 2 (1 + 2 = 3)\n\n- B = 4, T = 1 (2 + 1 = 3)\n\n- B = 6, T = 0 (3 + 0 = 3)\n\n**Scenario 4: P = 3**\n\nThree playgrounds take 6 acres, leaving:\n\n7 - 6 = 1 acre\n\nThus:\n\n0.5B + 1T \u2264 1\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- B = 0, T = 1 (0 + 1 = 1)\n\n- B = 2, T = 0 (1 + 0 = 1)\n\n**Scenario 5: P = 4**\n\nFour playgrounds would take 8 acres, but we only have 7 acres available for facilities, which is not possible. So, P cannot be 4 or more.\n\nTherefore, the possible combinations are those listed in Scenarios 1 through 4.\n\nTo summarize, here are some possible combinations of facilities:\n\n1. No playgrounds:\n\n- Up to 14 basketball courts and 0 to 7 tennis courts, with the relationship 0.5B + T \u2264 7.\n\n2. One playground:\n\n- Up to 10 basketball courts and 0 to 5 tennis courts, with 0.5B + T \u2264 5.\n\n3. Two playgrounds:\n\n- Up to 6 basketball courts and 0 to 3 tennis courts, with 0.5B + T \u2264 3.\n\n4. Three playgrounds:\n\n- Up to 2 basketball courts and 0 or 1 tennis court, with 0.5B + T \u2264 1.\n\nThese combinations ensure that the green space requirement is met, as the total facility area does not exceed 7 acres.\n\nAdditionally, it's essential to consider other factors such as the demand for each type of facility, accessibility, maintenance costs, and the overall layout of the park to make the most of the available space.\n\nFor example, if the demand for playgrounds is high, opting for more playgrounds with fewer basketball and tennis courts might be preferable. Conversely, if there's a strong community interest in sports, more basketball and tennis courts could be justified.\n\nAlso, considering the space efficiency, basketball courts take the least space per court, allowing for more facilities in the same area compared to tennis courts and playgrounds.\n\nFurthermore, the city might want to consider the adjacency of different facilities to maximize the utility of the park. For instance, placing playgrounds near walking paths or combining smaller facilities to create multi-use areas.\n\nIn conclusion, there are multiple ways to allocate the available 7 acres among basketball courts, tennis courts, and playgrounds while\u4fdd\u7559\u81f3\u5c1130%\u7684\u7eff\u5730\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u6bcf\u79cd\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u57ce\u5e02\u53ef\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u793e\u533a\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u504f\u597d\u3002"
