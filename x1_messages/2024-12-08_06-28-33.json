        "content": "The principle of conservation of momentum in classical mechanics states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant if no external forces act on it. So, the correct answer is C. The total momentum of a closed system is constant if no external forces are acting on it.\n\nTo elaborate, momentum is a measurement involving mass in motion, defined as the product of the mass and velocity of an object. The principle essentially means that in a system isolated from external influences, the total momentum of interacting bodies or particles remains unchanged, regardless of the interactions among them. This principle is fundamental in physics and applies to a wide range of phenomena, from collisions between particles to the movements of planets.\n\nOption A is actually the statement of the conservation of energy, not momentum. It says that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed from one form to another. This is a separate conservation law in physics.\n\nOption B is another way of stating the conservation of energy, emphasizing that in an isolated system, the total amount of energy remains constant.\n\nOption D is Newton's second law of motion, which relates the force acting on an object to its mass and acceleration. While related to momentum (since momentum is mass times velocity, and force can be seen as the rate of change of momentum), it is not the statement of the conservation of momentum.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C."
