        "content": "I'm here to provide information and assistance based on known facts and evidence. The Yeti, also known as the Abominable Snowman, is a mythical creature said to inhabit the Himalayan region of Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet. Despite numerous alleged sightings and accounts over the years, there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of such a creature. Many experts believe that the legends may be based on misidentifications of known animals or natural phenomena. It's essential to approach such claims with a critical and evidence-based mindset."
