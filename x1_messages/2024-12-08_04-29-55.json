        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have 100 people standing in a line, and the first person is wearing a hat. Then, for every person wearing a hat, there are 9 people without hats between them and the next person wearing a hat. We need to find out how many people in total are wearing hats.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand the pattern here. The first person has a hat, then there are 9 people without hats, then another person with a hat, and this pattern repeats throughout the line.\n\nSo, it's like: Hat, No Hat, No Hat, No Hat, No Hat, No Hat, No Hat, No Hat, No Hat, No Hat, Hat, and so on.\n\nIn other words, every 10th person is wearing a hat because there are 9 people without hats between each person with a hat.\n\nWait a minute, but the first person has a hat, then the next person with a hat would be the 1st plus 10, which is the 11th person, then the 21st, 31st, and so on.\n\nLet me list it out to see:\n\n- Person 1: Hat\n\n- Person 2-10: No Hat\n\n- Person 11: Hat\n\n- Person 12-20: No Hat\n\n- Person 21: Hat\n\n- Person 22-30: No Hat\n\n- Person 31: Hat\n\n- And so on...\n\nSo, it's every 10th person starting from the first person.\n\nNow, to find out how many people are wearing hats, we need to see how many multiples of 10 are there up to 100, including the first person.\n\nWait, but the first person is number 1, and then 11, 21, 31, ..., up to 91, and then 101, but there are only 100 people, so 101 is not included.\n\nSo, the people with hats are: 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91.\n\nThat's 10 people.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's another way to calculate this.\n\nWe can think of this as an arithmetic sequence where the first term a=1, and the common difference d=10.\n\nThe nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\na_n = a + (n-1)d\n\nWe need to find the largest n such that a_n \u2264 100.\n\nSo,\n\n1 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 100\n\n(n-1)*10 \u2264 99\n\nn-1 \u2264 9.9\n\nSince n must be an integer, n-1 \u2264 9\n\nTherefore, n \u2264 10\n\nSo, n=10\n\nTherefore, there are 10 people wearing hats.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the positions of people with hats as:\n\n1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91\n\nThat's 10 people.\n\nWait, but what if we consider the last person, number 100? Is he wearing a hat?\n\nAccording to the pattern, the next person after 91 would be 101, which is beyond 100, so person 100 is not wearing a hat.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people wearing hats is 10.\n\nBut let's double-check this.\n\nIf we have 10 people wearing hats, and between each pair of hat-wearers there are 9 people without hats, then the total number of people would be:\n\nNumber of hat-wearers = 10\n\nNumber of gaps between hat-wearers = 9 (since it's 10 people)\n\nNumber of people without hats = 9 gaps * 9 people per gap = 81 people\n\nTotal people = hat-wearers + people without hats = 10 + 81 = 91 people\n\nBut wait, that's only 91 people, and we have 100 people in total.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to adjust my approach.\n\nLet me consider that the first person has a hat, then there are 9 people without hats, then another hat, and so on.\n\nSo, each \"block\" consists of 1 hat and 9 no hats, totaling 10 people per block.\n\nSo, each block has 10 people.\n\nNow, with 100 people, the number of complete blocks is 100 / 10 = 10 blocks.\n\nEach block has one hat, so total hats should be equal to the number of blocks, which is 10.\n\nBut earlier, when I calculated it this way, I got 91 people, which is less than 100.\n\nWait, perhaps there are more people after the last complete block.\n\nLet's see: 10 blocks * 10 people = 100 people.\n\nSo, exactly 100 people.\n\nTherefore, 10 hats.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that 10 blocks would only account for 91 people, but that's incorrect.\n\nWait, no: 10 blocks * 10 people = 100 people.\n\nSo, it's 10 hats.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nIf the first person has a hat, then every 10th person after that has a hat: 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91.\n\nThat's 10 people.\n\nBut 10*10=100, so it fits perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 10.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that between each hat, there are 9 people without hats, so for 10 hats, there would be 9 gaps of 9 people each, totaling 81 people without hats, plus 10 hats, equaling 91 people.\n\nBut that doesn't add up to 100.\n\nSo, there must be a mistake in this approach.\n\nAh, I see the mistake.\n\nIn the first block: hat, followed by 9 no hats.\n\nSecond block: hat, followed by 9 no hats.\n\n...\n\nTenth block: hat, followed by 9 no hats.\n\nBut the tenth block would end at person 100.\n\nWait, person 1 is hat, 2-10 no hats.\n\nPerson 11 is hat, 12-20 no hats.\n\n...\n\nPerson 91 is hat, 92-100 no hats.\n\nSo, person 100 is without a hat.\n\nTherefore, total people with hats are 10.\n\nBut according to the earlier calculation, 10 blocks * 10 people = 100 people.\n\nSo, it seems consistent.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 10 hats + 81 no hats = 91 people, but that's incorrect because actually, it's 10 hats + 90 no hats = 100 people.\n\nWait, no: in 10 blocks, each block has 1 hat and 9 no hats, so 10 hats and 90 no hats, totaling 100 people.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 81 no hats, but that was a mistake.\n\nActually, 10 blocks * 9 no hats = 90 no hats, plus 10 hats = 100 people.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people with hats is 10.\n\nBut the problem states that there are 100 people in total, and according to this, we have accounted for all 100 people with 10 hats and 90 no hats.\n\nSo, the answer should be 10.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider if the last block is incomplete.\n\nNo, since 100 divided by 10 is exactly 10, so there are no incomplete blocks.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people wearing hats is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
