        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company that currently produces 500 units of a product each day, and each unit costs $20 to produce. They're thinking about increasing production by 100 units per day, which would bring the total production to 600 units per day, and at the same time, they expect the cost per unit to decrease to $18.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much they currently spend on production daily. That should be the number of units they produce multiplied by the cost per unit. So, currently, it's 500 units times $20 per unit. Let me calculate that:\n\n500 units * $20/unit = $10,000 per day.\n\nOkay, so they're spending $10,000 per day on production now.\n\nNext, if they increase production by 100 units, they'll be producing 600 units per day, and the cost per unit will be $18. So, the new daily production cost would be 600 units times $18 per unit.\n\n600 units * $18/unit = $10,800 per day.\n\nAlright, so with the increased production and reduced cost per unit, they would be spending $10,800 per day.\n\nNow, to find out how much more or less they will spend compared to what they're spending now, I need to subtract the current daily production cost from the new daily production cost.\n\nNew cost - current cost = $10,800 - $10,000 = $800.\n\nSo, they will spend $800 more per day.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, current production: 500 units * $20/unit = $10,000. That seems correct.\n\nSecond, new production: 600 units * $18/unit = $10,800. Yeah, that's right.\n\nDifference: $10,800 - $10,000 = $800.\n\nSo, they will spend $800 more per day.\n\nBut, maybe I should consider whether increasing production by 100 units and reducing the cost per unit to $18 actually leads to a higher or lower total cost.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe there's a way to see the change in a different perspective.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the total cost before and after and then find the difference.\n\nTotal cost before = 500 units * $20/unit = $10,000.\n\nTotal cost after = 600 units * $18/unit = $10,800.\n\nDifference = $10,800 - $10,000 = $800 more.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of the change in units and the change in cost per unit.\n\nThey're increasing production by 100 units and reducing the cost per unit by $2 (from $20 to $18).\n\nSo, the additional cost for the extra 100 units at $18 per unit is 100 units * $18/unit = $1,800.\n\nBut, they're saving $2 per unit on all 600 units because the cost per unit is reduced by $2.\n\nWait, is that the right way to look at it?\n\nLet me try to break it down.\n\nIf they keep the production at 500 units but reduce the cost per unit to $18, the cost would be 500 units * $18/unit = $9,000.\n\nComparing this to the current cost of $10,000, they would save $1,000.\n\nBut then, they're increasing production by 100 units at $18 per unit, which adds an additional cost of 100 units * $18/unit = $1,800.\n\nSo, total change would be saving $1,000 plus spending an additional $1,800, which results in a net increase of $800.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, indeed, they will spend $800 more per day.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors I should take into account.\n\nIs there any fixed cost or variable cost that might be affected by increasing production?\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any fixed costs or additional variable costs beyond the cost per unit.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to assume that the only costs are the variable costs associated with producing each unit, and that the cost per unit is fully variable.\n\nTherefore, the total cost is simply the number of units produced multiplied by the cost per unit.\n\nHence, the calculation I did is accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look at the change in total cost as the sum of the change in production volume and the change in cost per unit.\n\nThe change in production volume is +100 units.\n\nThe change in cost per unit is -$2 per unit.\n\nBut, since both are changing simultaneously, it's a bit tricky to separate their effects.\n\nPerhaps it's better to stick with the straightforward approach of calculating total costs before and after.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total cost change due to the volume increase and the cost per unit decrease.\n\nThe increase in production volume is 100 units, and at the new cost per unit of $18, that adds $1,800 to the total cost.\n\nSimultaneously, reducing the cost per unit by $2 on the original 500 units would save $1,000.\n\nSo, the net change is -$1,000 (savings) + $1,800 (additional cost) = $800 more.\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the change in cost per unit across all units produced after the increase.\n\nThat is, the new total cost is 600 units * $18/unit = $10,800.\n\nThe original total cost was $10,000.\n\nDifference is $800 more.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways now.\n\nSo, the company will spend $800 more per day if they increase production by 100 units and reduce the cost per unit to $18.\n\nBut, perhaps there's another perspective.\n\nWhat if they had increased production by 100 units but kept the cost per unit at $20?\n\nThen, the total cost would be 600 units * $20/unit = $12,000.\n\nCompared to the original $10,000, that would be an increase of $2,000.\n\nBut, by reducing the cost per unit to $18, they're saving $2 per unit on all 600 units, which is a total savings of $1,200.\n\nSo, the increased production would cost an additional $2,000, but the savings from reduced cost per unit is $1,200.\n\nTherefore, the net change is $2,000 - $1,200 = $800 more.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nThis reinforces that the company will spend $800 more per day with the proposed changes.\n\nI think I've approached this problem from several angles and consistently arrived at the same answer.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the additional daily production cost will be $800 more.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{800} \\]"
