        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 houses in the village, and each house has one cat. So, there are 10 cats in total. Each cat catches 3 mice per day. I need to find out how many mice all the cats catch in one week.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many mice all the cats catch in one day. Since each cat catches 3 mice per day, and there are 10 cats, I can multiply the number of cats by the number of mice each cat catches per day.\n\nSo, 10 cats \u00d7 3 mice/cat/day = 30 mice per day.\n\nNow, to find out how many mice they catch in one week, I need to know how many days are in a week. There are 7 days in a week.\n\nSo, I can multiply the number of mice caught per day by the number of days in a week.\n\nThat is, 30 mice/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 210 mice per week.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me break it down again:\n\n- Number of houses: 10\n\n- Cats per house: 1\n\n- Total cats: 10\n\n- Mice caught per cat per day: 3\n\n- Mice caught per day by all cats: 10 \u00d7 3 = 30\n\n- Days in a week: 7\n\n- Mice caught per week by all cats: 30 \u00d7 7 = 210\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the total number of mice caught by all cats in one day is 30, and then multiplied by 7 for the week, which again gives 210.\n\nOr, I could think in terms of total mice caught by one cat in a week and then multiply by the number of cats.\n\nSo, one cat catches 3 mice per day, so in one week, one cat catches 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 mice.\n\nThen, with 10 cats, total mice caught would be 10 \u00d7 21 = 210.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think 210 is the correct total number of mice caught by all the cats in one week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{210} \\]"
