        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a box containing red and blue balls. The initial probabilities are given: the probability of picking a red ball is 2/5, and for a blue ball, it's 3/5. Then, we add three more red balls to the box, but the number of blue balls stays the same, and after that, the probability of picking a red ball becomes 1/2. We need to find out how many red balls were in the box initially.\n\nFirst, let's understand what probability means in this context. Probability is the likelihood of an event happening, and it's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, for red balls, the probability is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls in the box.\n\nLet's denote:\n- Let \\( r \\) be the initial number of red balls.\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of blue balls.\n\nFrom the first piece of information, the probability of picking a red ball initially is \\( \\frac{r}{r + b} = \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking a blue ball is \\( \\frac{b}{r + b} = \\frac{3}{5} \\). Actually, since there are only red and blue balls, the probability of picking a blue ball is just 1 minus the probability of picking a red ball, which checks out because \\( 1 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{5} \\).\n\nNow, we're told that three more red balls are added to the box, so the new number of red balls is \\( r + 3 \\), and the number of blue balls remains \\( b \\). The new total number of balls is \\( r + 3 + b \\).\n\nAfter adding these three red balls, the probability of picking a red ball becomes \\( \\frac{r + 3}{r + 3 + b} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{r}{r + b} = \\frac{2}{5} \\)\n\n2. \\( \\frac{r + 3}{r + b + 3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nOur goal is to solve for \\( r \\), the initial number of red balls.\n\nLet's work with the first equation:\n\n\\( \\frac{r}{r + b} = \\frac{2}{5} \\)\n\nWe can cross-multiply to get:\n\n\\( 5r = 2(r + b) \\)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n\\( 5r = 2r + 2b \\)\n\nSubtract \\( 2r \\) from both sides:\n\n\\( 3r = 2b \\)\n\nSo, \\( b = \\frac{3r}{2} \\)\n\nNow, let's look at the second equation:\n\n\\( \\frac{r + 3}{r + b + 3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nAgain, cross-multiplying:\n\n\\( 2(r + 3) = r + b + 3 \\)\n\nExpand the left side:\n\n\\( 2r + 6 = r + b + 3 \\)\n\nNow, substitute \\( b \\) from the first equation:\n\n\\( 2r + 6 = r + \\frac{3r}{2} + 3 \\)\n\nLet's combine like terms. First, get all terms involving \\( r \\) on one side. Subtract \\( r \\) from both sides:\n\n\\( 2r - r + 6 = \\frac{3r}{2} + 3 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( r + 6 = \\frac{3r}{2} + 3 \\)\n\nNow, subtract 3 from both sides:\n\n\\( r + 3 = \\frac{3r}{2} \\)\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:\n\n\\( 2(r + 3) = 3r \\)\n\nExpand the left side:\n\n\\( 2r + 6 = 3r \\)\n\nSubtract \\( 2r \\) from both sides:\n\n\\( 6 = r \\)\n\nSo, the initial number of red balls is 6.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it makes sense.\n\nInitially, \\( r = 6 \\), and from earlier, \\( b = \\frac{3r}{2} = \\frac{3 \\times 6}{2} = 9 \\).\n\nSo, initially, there are 6 red balls and 9 blue balls, making a total of 15 balls.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball is \\( \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{2}{5} \\), which matches the given information.\n\nAfter adding 3 red balls, the new number of red balls is \\( 6 + 3 = 9 \\), and the total number of balls is \\( 15 + 3 = 18 \\).\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball now is \\( \\frac{9}{18} = \\frac{1}{2} \\), which also matches the given information.\n\nEverything checks out, so the initial number of red balls is indeed 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
