        "content": "Alright, I'll guide you through creating a Python web scraper that uses BeautifulSoup to extract data from a website and save it to a JSON file. We'll make sure it handles pagination and includes error handling.\n\nFirst, you'll need to install the necessary libraries if you haven't already. You'll need `requests` for making HTTP requests and `beautifulsoup4` for parsing the HTML. You can install them using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install requests beautifulsoup4\n```\n\nFor this example, let's assume we're scraping a website that has product listings with pagination. Each page has multiple products, and we want to extract the product names and prices.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Basics\n\nImport the necessary libraries:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport json\n```\n\n### Step 2: Make a Request to the Website\n\nDefine a function to make a request to the website and handle potential errors:\n\n```python\ndef fetch_url(url):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raises an HTTPError for bad responses\n        return response.text\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching URL: {e}\")\n        return None\n```\n\n### Step 3: Parse the HTML and Extract Data\n\nDefine a function to parse the HTML and extract the required data. For this example, let's assume that product names are in `<h2>` tags with class `product-name` and prices are in `<span>` tags with class `price`.\n\n```python\ndef extract_data(html):\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')\n    products = []\n    for item in soup.find_all('div', class_='product'):\n        name_tag = item.find('h2', class_='product-name')\n        price_tag = item.find('span', class_='price')\n        if name_tag and price_tag:\n            product = {\n                'name': name_tag.text.strip(),\n                'price': price_tag.text.strip()\n            }\n            products.append(product)\n    return products\n```\n\n### Step 4: Handle Pagination\n\nAssume that the pagination links are in `<a>` tags with class `page-link` and the next page link has class `next-page`. We'll collect all the pages and scrape each one.\n\n```python\ndef get_all_pages(base_url):\n    all_products = []\n    url = base_url\n    while url:\n        html = fetch_url(url)\n        if html:\n            products = extract_data(html)\n            all_products.extend(products)\n            soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')\n            next_link = soup.find('a', class_='next-page')\n            if next_link:\n                url = base_url + next_link['href']\n            else:\n                url = None\n        else:\n            break\n    return all_products\n```\n\n### Step 5: Save Data to JSON\n\nDefine a function to save the extracted data to a JSON file:\n\n```python\ndef save_to_json(data, filename):\n    with open(filename, 'w') as f:\n        json.dump(data, f, indent=4)\n```\n\n### Step 6: Main Function\n\nCombine all the functions in a main function and specify the base URL and output filename:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    base_url = 'https://example.com/products/'\n    output_file = 'products.json'\n    \n    all_products = get_all_pages(base_url)\n    save_to_json(all_products, output_file)\n    print(f\"Scraped {len(all_products)} products and saved to {output_file}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Full Script\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport json\n\ndef fetch_url(url):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.text\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching URL: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef extract_data(html):\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')\n    products = []\n    for item in soup.find_all('div', class_='product'):\n        name_tag = item.find('h2', class_='product-name')\n        price_tag = item.find('span', class_='price')\n        if name_tag and price_tag:\n            product = {\n                'name': name_tag.text.strip(),\n                'price': price_tag.text.strip()\n            }\n            products.append(product)\n    return products\n\ndef get_all_pages(base_url):\n    all_products = []\n    url = base_url\n    while url:\n        html = fetch_url(url)\n        if html:\n            products = extract_data(html)\n            all_products.extend(products)\n            soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')\n            next_link = soup.find('a', class_='next-page')\n            if next_link:\n                url = base_url + next_link['href']\n            else:\n                url = None\n        else:\n            break\n    return all_products\n\ndef save_to_json(data, filename):\n    with open(filename, 'w') as f:\n        json.dump(data, f, indent=4)\n\ndef main():\n    base_url = 'https://example.com/products/'\n    output_file = 'products.json'\n    \n    all_products = get_all_pages(base_url)\n    save_to_json(all_products, output_file)\n    print(f\"Scraped {len(all_products)} products and saved to {output_file}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **fetch_url**: Makes an HTTP request to the URL and handles exceptions.\n2. **extract_data**: Parses the HTML and extracts product names and prices.\n3. **get_all_pages**: Handles pagination by following the next page link until there are no more pages.\n4. **save_to_json**: Saves the collected data to a JSON file.\n5. **main**: Orchestrates the scraping process and outputs the result.\n\nMake sure to adjust the tag names and classes according to the actual structure of the website you're scraping. Also, respect the website's `robots.txt` file and terms of service to ensure you're scraping ethically."
