        "content": "Let's see. There are 40 students in total, and 12 of them are girls. So, the rest are boys. That means there are 40 - 12 = 28 boys.\n\nNow, half of the girls have brown hair. So, half of 12 girls is 12 / 2 = 6 girls with brown hair.\n\nNext, one-third of the boys have brown hair. So, one-third of 28 boys is 28 / 3. Wait, 28 divided by 3 is approximately 9.333, but we can't have a fraction of a student. Hmm, maybe I should check that again.\n\nActually, 28 divided by 3 is exactly 9 and 1/3, but since we're dealing with whole people, perhaps the problem expects us to consider only whole numbers. Maybe I should see if 28 is divisible by 3. 3 times 9 is 27, which leaves a remainder of 1, so 28 / 3 is 9 with a remainder of 1. So, perhaps 9 boys have brown hair.\n\nBut, to be precise, one-third of 28 is 9 and one-third, which isn't a whole number. Maybe the problem has a slight issue here, but I think it's safe to assume that 9 boys have brown hair.\n\nSo, total students with brown hair would be the girls with brown hair plus the boys with brown hair: 6 + 9 = 15.\n\nWait a minute, but earlier I thought 12 girls minus those with brown hair, but no, the question is about how many have brown hair.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n- Total students: 40\n\n- Girls: 12\n\n- Boys: 40 - 12 = 28\n\n- Half of the girls have brown hair: 12 / 2 = 6 girls\n\n- One-third of the boys have brown hair: 28 / 3 = 9.333, but since we can't have a fraction of a student, it's likely 9 boys.\n\n- Total with brown hair: 6 + 9 = 15\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
