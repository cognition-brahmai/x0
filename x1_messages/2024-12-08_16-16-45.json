        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a square with an area of 64 square units, and I need to find the length of its diagonal. Okay, let's start from the beginning.\n\nFirst, I know that the area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one of its sides. So, if the area is 64 square units, that means the length of each side is the square root of 64. Let me calculate that:\n\n\u221a64 = 8 units\n\nSo, each side of the square is 8 units long.\n\nNow, I need to find the length of the diagonal. I remember that in a square, the diagonals are equal in length and they bisect each other at right angles. Also, the diagonals of a square can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, since the diagonal forms a right triangle with two sides of the square.\n\nSo, if I consider one of the right triangles formed by the diagonal, the two legs are both 8 units (the sides of the square), and the hypotenuse is the diagonal I'm looking for.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n\nWhere a and b are the legs, and c is the hypotenuse.\n\nIn this case, a = 8 units, b = 8 units.\n\nSo:\n\n8\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n\n64 + 64 = c\u00b2\n\n128 = c\u00b2\n\nNow, to find c, I need to take the square root of both sides:\n\nc = \u221a128\n\nI can simplify \u221a128. Let's see:\n\n128 can be factored into 64 * 2, and \u221a(64 * 2) = \u221a64 * \u221a2 = 8\u221a2\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal is 8\u221a2 units.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe using the properties of a square or some formula I don't remember?\n\nLet me think. I recall that in a square, the relationship between the side length and the diagonal is that the diagonal is equal to the side length multiplied by the square root of 2. Yeah, that sounds familiar.\n\nSo, diagonal = side * \u221a2\n\nGiven that the side is 8 units, diagonal = 8 * \u221a2 units\n\nThat matches what I got earlier using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nIs there any other way to confirm this?\n\nMaybe I can use trigonometry. In a square, all angles are 90 degrees, and the diagonals split the angles in half, creating 45-degree angles.\n\nSo, each triangle formed by the diagonal is a 45-45-90 triangle.\n\nIn a 45-45-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is equal to the leg multiplied by \u221a2.\n\nAgain, that confirms that diagonal = side * \u221a2\n\nSo, everything points to 8\u221a2 units being the correct answer.\n\nLet me just double-check if I made any calculation errors.\n\nStarting with area = 64 square units, side length is \u221a64 = 8 units.\n\nThen, diagonal = 8 * \u221a2 units.\n\nI don't think there's any mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to find the numerical value, I can approximate \u221a2 as 1.414.\n\nSo, diagonal \u2248 8 * 1.414 = 11.312 units\n\nBut since the problem likely expects the answer in terms of \u221a2, I'll stick with 8\u221a2 units.\n\nAlright, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8\\sqrt{2}} \\]"
