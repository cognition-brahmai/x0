        "content": "So, I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's asking. You read 20 pages of a book every day, and after 15 days, you've read 300 pages. Also, it says that at this point, you're halfway through the book. I need to find out how many pages the book has in total.\n\nFirst, I should probably confirm whether the information given makes sense. If you read 20 pages every day for 15 days, the total pages read should be 20 times 15, right? Let me calculate that: 20 multiplied by 15 is 300 pages. That matches the information given, so that checks out.\n\nNow, it says that after reading 300 pages, you're halfway through the book. So, that means that half of the book is 300 pages. To find the total number of pages, I need to find out what number 300 is half of.\n\nLet me think about this. If half of the book is 300 pages, then the whole book should be twice that, right? So, 300 times 2 would be 600 pages. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there isn't any other aspect to this problem. Is there any other information given that I might have missed? Let's see. The problem says you read 20 pages every day, and after 15 days, you've read 300 pages, which is halfway through the book.\n\nI don't think there's any need for more complex calculations here. It's a straightforward problem. You've read half the book in 15 days, reading 20 pages each day, totaling 300 pages. Therefore, the whole book has 600 pages.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if the reading rate is constant and if there are any variables I haven't accounted for. But based on the information given, it seems straightforward.\n\nSo, my final answer is that the book has 600 pages.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{600} \\]"
