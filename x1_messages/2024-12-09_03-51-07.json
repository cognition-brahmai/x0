        "content": "Let's see. The library has 12,000 books in total. Out of these, 30% are fiction and 25% are non-fiction. The rest are reference books. I need to find out how many more fiction books there are compared to non-fiction books.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many fiction books there are. Since 30% of the books are fiction, I can calculate that by taking 30% of 12,000.\n\nSo, fiction books = 30% of 12,000.\n\nSimilarly, non-fiction books = 25% of 12,000.\n\nThen, to find out how many more fiction books there are than non-fiction books, I'll subtract the number of non-fiction books from the number of fiction books.\n\nLet me do the calculations step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate 30% of 12,000:\n\n30% of 12,000 = (30/100) * 12,000 = 0.3 * 12,000 = 3,600.\n\nSo, there are 3,600 fiction books.\n\nNext, calculate 25% of 12,000:\n\n25% of 12,000 = (25/100) * 12,000 = 0.25 * 12,000 = 3,000.\n\nSo, there are 3,000 non-fiction books.\n\nNow, to find out how many more fiction books there are than non-fiction books:\n\n3,600 (fiction) - 3,000 (non-fiction) = 600.\n\nSo, there are 600 more fiction books than non-fiction books.\n\nWait a minute, the problem also mentions that the rest of the books are reference books. Maybe I should check how many reference books there are.\n\nFirst, let's find out what percentage of the books are reference books.\n\nTotal percentage of fiction and non-fiction books is 30% + 25% = 55%.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of reference books is 100% - 55% = 45%.\n\nSo, reference books = 45% of 12,000.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n45% of 12,000 = (45/100) * 12,000 = 0.45 * 12,000 = 5,400.\n\nSo, there are 5,400 reference books.\n\nJust to double-check, let's add up all the books:\n\nFiction: 3,600\n\nNon-fiction: 3,000\n\nReference: 5,400\n\nTotal = 3,600 + 3,000 + 5,400 = 12,000.\n\nYes, that matches the total number of books.\n\nSo, the answer is that there are 600 more fiction books than non-fiction books.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{600} \\]"
