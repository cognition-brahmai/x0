        "content": "So, we've got this problem here about two machines in a factory, Machine A and Machine B, and we need to find out how many total units they produce in one day. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, it says that Machine A produces 60 units per hour. Okay, so that's its production rate. And Machine B produces 80 units per hour. Got it. Both machines work for 8 hours a day. So, I need to calculate how much each machine produces in those 8 hours and then add them together to get the total production for the day.\n\nLet me start with Machine A. If it makes 60 units every hour, and it works for 8 hours, then the total units produced by Machine A in one day would be 60 units/hour times 8 hours. That should be 480 units.\n\nNow, for Machine B, which produces 80 units per hour, working the same 8 hours a day. So, its total production would be 80 units/hour times 8 hours, which is 640 units.\n\nFinally, to find the total units produced by both machines in one day, I just need to add their individual productions together. So, 480 units from Machine A plus 640 units from Machine B equals 1120 units.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should do the calculations again to be sure.\n\nMachine A: 60 units/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 480 units.\n\nMachine B: 80 units/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 640 units.\n\nTotal units: 480 + 640 = 1120 units.\n\nYeah, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of it in another way. Since both machines are working for the same amount of time, I could add their production rates together first and then multiply by the number of hours.\n\nSo, Machine A produces 60 units/hour and Machine B produces 80 units/hour. Together, they produce 60 + 80 = 140 units per hour.\n\nThen, working for 8 hours, their total production would be 140 units/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 1120 units.\n\nHmm, that's the same answer I got earlier. So, either way, the total units produced in one day are 1120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Unless there's something I'm missing, like any breaks or downtime for the machines, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It says both machines work for 8 hours a day, so I assume they are operational throughout that time.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 1120 units per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1120} \\]"
