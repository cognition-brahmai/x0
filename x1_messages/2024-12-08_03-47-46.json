        "content": "The term you're looking for is B. Pleiotropy. Pleiotropy refers to the phenomenon where a single gene influences multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits. This can occur because the gene product is involved in multiple pathways or has functions in different parts of the organism.\n\nTo elaborate a bit more:\n\n- **Genomic imprinting** (option A) is a phenomenon where genes are expressed differently depending on whether they are inherited from the mother or the father. This involves epigenetic modifications that affect gene expression without changing the DNA sequence.\n\n- **Epistasis** (option C) refers to the interaction between genes where the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more other genes. It's about how genes influence each other's expression or effects.\n\n- **Polygenic inheritance** (option D) involves multiple genes contributing to a single trait. Each gene has a small effect, and their combined effects determine the phenotype. This is common in complex traits like height, weight, and susceptibility to certain diseases.\n\n- **Pleiotropy** (option B), as mentioned, is when one gene affects multiple traits. A classic example is sickle cell anemia, where a mutation in the hemoglobin gene not only affects red blood cell shape but also provides resistance to malaria in heterozygotes.\n\nUnderstanding pleiotropy is crucial in genetics because it helps explain how a single genetic change can have wide-ranging effects on an organism's phenotype. It also has implications for evolutionary biology, as a gene that affects multiple traits may be subject to different selective pressures."
