        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about the percentages of people with different eye colors and their genders, and I need to find out what percentage of the total population are men. Okay, so let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that 30% of the people have blue eyes, and 70% have brown eyes. That means if I take the total population as 100%, 30% have blue eyes and 70% have brown eyes. Now, among the blue-eyed people, 60% are men. Similarly, among the brown-eyed people, 40% are men.\n\nSo, I need to find the total percentage of men in the population. To do that, I should probably find out what percentage of the blue-eyed people are men and what percentage of the brown-eyed people are men, and then add those together.\n\nLet me try that. First, for blue-eyed people: 30% of the population has blue eyes, and 60% of those are men. So, the percentage of the total population that are blue-eyed men would be 30% times 60%. Let's calculate that:\n\n30% * 60% = 0.30 * 0.60 = 0.18, which is 18%.\n\nOkay, so 18% of the total population are blue-eyed men.\n\nNext, for brown-eyed people: 70% of the population has brown eyes, and 40% of those are men. So, the percentage of the total population that are brown-eyed men would be 70% times 40%. Let's calculate that:\n\n70% * 40% = 0.70 * 0.40 = 0.28, which is 28%.\n\nSo, 28% of the total population are brown-eyed men.\n\nNow, to find the total percentage of men in the population, I should add these two percentages together: 18% + 28% = 46%.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I should double-check if there's any other way to look at this. Maybe I should consider whether there are people with other eye colors, but the problem says that 30% have blue eyes and 70% have brown eyes, which adds up to 100%, so there are no other eye colors in this population.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm not missing anything about the distribution of genders within each eye color group. The problem says that among blue-eyed people, 60% are men, which implies that 40% are women. Similarly, among brown-eyed people, 40% are men and 60% are women.\n\nSo, the calculations seem correct. Blue-eyed men are 18% of the total population, and brown-eyed men are 28% of the total population. Adding those gives 46% men in the total population.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this differently. Suppose I consider the entire population as 100 people. Then, 30 people have blue eyes, and 70 have brown eyes.\n\nAmong the blue-eyed people: 60% are men, so 0.60 * 30 = 18 men.\n\nAmong the brown-eyed people: 40% are men, so 0.40 * 70 = 28 men.\n\nTotal men: 18 + 28 = 46 men out of 100.\n\nSo, that's 46%.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the proportions.\n\nThe proportion of men in the blue-eyed group is 0.60, and the proportion of blue-eyed people in the population is 0.30. So, the contribution of blue-eyed men to the total population is 0.60 * 0.30 = 0.18 or 18%.\n\nSimilarly, the proportion of men in the brown-eyed group is 0.40, and the proportion of brown-eyed people in the population is 0.70. So, the contribution of brown-eyed men to the total population is 0.40 * 0.70 = 0.28 or 28%.\n\nAdding these contributions gives 18% + 28% = 46%.\n\nI think this is solid. There doesn't seem to be any other factor to consider here. The answer should be 46%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{46\\%} \\]"
