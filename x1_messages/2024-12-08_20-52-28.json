        "content": "So I've got this algebra problem here: (4x^2 - 6x + 2) - (2x^2 + 4x - 1). Hmm, okay, I need to subtract these two polynomials. I remember that subtracting polynomials means I have to distribute the negative sign through the second polynomial and then combine like terms.\n\nFirst, let's write it out again to make sure I'm clear:\n\n(4x^2 - 6x + 2) - (2x^2 + 4x - 1)\n\nI need to distribute that negative sign to each term inside the second set of parentheses. So, that means:\n\n4x^2 - 6x + 2 - 2x^2 - 4x + 1\n\nWait, did I get all the signs right? Let's double-check. The original expression is:\n\n(4x^2 - 6x + 2) - (2x^2 + 4x - 1)\n\nSo, subtracting 2x^2, subtracting 4x, and subtracting -1, which is the same as adding 1. Yep, that looks correct.\n\nNow, I need to combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same power of x.\n\nSo, let's group the x^2 terms together, the x terms together, and the constant terms together.\n\nx^2 terms: 4x^2 and -2x^2\n\nx terms: -6x and -4x\n\nConstant terms: 2 and 1\n\nNow, let's add them up separately.\n\nFor the x^2 terms: 4x^2 - 2x^2 = 2x^2\n\nFor the x terms: -6x - 4x = -10x\n\nFor the constant terms: 2 + 1 = 3\n\nSo, putting it all together, I get:\n\n2x^2 - 10x + 3\n\nWait a minute, is that the final answer? It seems straightforward, but I should check if there's any simplification I missed or if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could have factored or something, but I don't think that's necessary here since the problem is just to subtract the two polynomials.\n\nLet me verify my distribution again. Starting with:\n\n(4x^2 - 6x + 2) - (2x^2 + 4x - 1)\n\nDistributing the negative sign:\n\n4x^2 - 6x + 2 - 2x^2 - 4x + 1\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n4x^2 - 2x^2 = 2x^2\n\n-6x - 4x = -10x\n\n2 + 1 = 3\n\nSo, 2x^2 - 10x + 3\n\nI think that's correct. Maybe I can check by plugging in a value for x and seeing if it makes sense.\n\nLet's pick x = 1.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n(4(1)^2 - 6(1) + 2) - (2(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1) = (4 - 6 + 2) - (2 + 4 - 1) = (0) - (5) = -5\n\nNow, my simplified expression is 2x^2 - 10x + 3\n\nPlugging in x = 1: 2(1)^2 - 10(1) + 3 = 2 - 10 + 3 = -5\n\nOkay, it matches. That gives me some confidence.\n\nLet me try another value, say x = 0.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n(4(0)^2 - 6(0) + 2) - (2(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1) = (0 - 0 + 2) - (0 + 0 - 1) = 2 - (-1) = 3\n\nSimplified expression: 2(0)^2 - 10(0) + 3 = 0 - 0 + 3 = 3\n\nAgain, it matches.\n\nOne more time, let's try x = 2.\n\nOriginal: (4(2)^2 - 6(2) + 2) - (2(2)^2 + 4(2) - 1) = (16 - 12 + 2) - (8 + 8 - 1) = (6) - (15) = -9\n\nSimplified: 2(2)^2 - 10(2) + 3 = 8 - 20 + 3 = -9\n\nPerfect, it's consistent.\n\nI think I've confirmed that my answer is correct. So, the final answer should be:\n\n2x^2 - 10x + 3\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2x^2 - 10x + 3} \\]"
