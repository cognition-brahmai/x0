        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. To create a basic command-line calculator in Ruby that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, we'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Get user input:** We need to ask the user for two numbers and the operation they want to perform.\n\n2. **Parse the input:** Convert the input strings into appropriate data types (numbers for the operands and a symbol for the operator).\n\n3. **Perform the operation:** Based on the operator provided, perform the corresponding mathematical operation.\n\n4. **Display the result:** Output the result of the operation to the user.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n### Step 1: Get User Input\n\nWe'll use Ruby's `gets` method to retrieve input from the user. We need to ask for two numbers and the operator.\n\n```ruby\nputs \"Simple Calculator\"\nputs \"Enter the first number:\"\nnum1 = gets.chomp\n\nputs \"Enter the second number:\"\nnum2 = gets.chomp\n\nputs \"Enter the operator (+, -, *, /):\"\noperator = gets.chomp\n```\n\n### Step 2: Parse the Input\n\nWe need to convert the input strings to numbers. We'll use `to_f` to handle floating-point numbers, but if you only want integers, you can use `to_i`.\n\n```ruby\nnum1 = num1.to_f\nnum2 = num2.to_f\n```\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Operation\n\nWe'll use a case statement to determine which operation to perform based on the operator provided.\n\n```ruby\ncase operator\nwhen \"+\"\n  result = num1 + num2\nwhen \"-\"\n  result = num1 - num2\nwhen \"*\"\n  result = num1 * num2\nwhen \"/\"\n  if num2 != 0\n    result = num1 / num2\n  else\n    puts \"Error: Division by zero\"\n    exit\n  end\nelse\n  puts \"Invalid operator\"\n  exit\nend\n```\n\n### Step 4: Display the Result\n\nFinally, we'll print the result to the console.\n\n```ruby\nputs \"The result is: #{result}\"\n```\n\n### Complete Code\n\nPutting it all together, here's the complete code for the basic calculator:\n\n```ruby\nputs \"Simple Calculator\"\nputs \"Enter the first number:\"\nnum1 = gets.chomp.to_f\n\nputs \"Enter the second number:\"\nnum2 = gets.chomp.to_f\n\nputs \"Enter the operator (+, -, *, /):\"\noperator = gets.chomp\n\ncase operator\nwhen \"+\"\n  result = num1 + num2\nwhen \"-\"\n  result = num1 - num2\nwhen \"*\"\n  result = num1 * num2\nwhen \"/\"\n  if num2 != 0\n    result = num1 / num2\n  else\n    puts \"Error: Division by zero\"\n    exit\n  end\nelse\n  puts \"Invalid operator\"\n  exit\nend\n\nputs \"The result is: #{result}\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Input Handling:** We use `gets.chomp` to read user input and `to_f` to convert strings to floats.\n- **Operator Handling:** A case statement checks the operator and performs the corresponding operation.\n- **Error Handling:** We check for division by zero and invalid operators, providing appropriate messages.\n\nThis calculator is straightforward and handles basic arithmetic operations. You can extend it by adding more features like handling more operators, handling multiple operations in a single expression, or improving user input validation.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!"
