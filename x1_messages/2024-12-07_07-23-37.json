        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you set up a Node.js server using Express that can handle file uploads and downloads. We'll use Multer for handling the file uploads, and Express will manage the routing for both uploading and downloading files. The uploaded files will be stored in a local directory named \"uploads\".\n\nFirst, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Once you have Node.js installed, open your terminal or command prompt and create a new directory for your project:\n\n```bash\nmkdir file-upload-server\ncd file-upload-server\n```\n\nNext, initialize a new Node.js project by running:\n\n```bash\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nThis will create a `package.json` file in your project directory.\n\nNow, install the required packages: Express and Multer. You can do this by running:\n\n```bash\nnpm install express multer\n```\n\nOnce the packages are installed, create a new file called `server.js` in your project directory. This is where we'll write our server code.\n\nFirst, let's set up the basic structure of the Express server:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst multer = require('multer');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nNext, we need to configure Multer to handle file uploads. Multer is a middleware that parses incoming request with multipart/form-data content-type. It will handle the file upload and save it to the \"uploads\" directory.\n\nFirst, create the \"uploads\" directory:\n\n```bash\nmkdir uploads\n```\n\nNow, configure Multer to store the uploaded files in the \"uploads\" directory:\n\n```javascript\nconst upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });\n```\n\nYou can customize the file naming and other options if needed, but for simplicity, we'll use the default settings.\n\nNow, let's create the endpoint for uploading files. We'll use the `POST` method for this endpoint. The endpoint will be `/upload`.\n\n```javascript\napp.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {\n  if (!req.file) {\n    return res.status(400).send('No file uploaded.');\n  }\n  res.send('File uploaded successfully.');\n});\n```\n\nIn this code, `upload.single('file')` tells Multer to expect a single file with the form field name \"file\". If no file is uploaded, it returns a 400 bad request error; otherwise, it sends a success message.\n\nNext, we need to create an endpoint for downloading files by their filename. We'll use the `GET` method for this endpoint, and the endpoint will be `/download/:filename`, where `:filename` is a parameter that captures the filename.\n\nTo serve files from the \"uploads\" directory, we can use the `express.static` middleware. However, since we want to serve files by their filename, we'll handle it explicitly.\n\nFirst, make sure that the \"uploads\" directory is set up correctly:\n\n```javascript\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst uploadsDir = path.join(__dirname, 'uploads');\n```\n\nNow, create the download endpoint:\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/download/:filename', (req, res) => {\n  const filename = req.params.filename;\n  const file_path = path.join(uploadsDir, filename);\n\n  res.download(file_path, filename, (err) => {\n    if (err) {\n      console.error(err);\n      res.status(404).send('File not found.');\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n\nIn this code, we construct the full path to the file using the provided filename and serve it using `res.download()`. If the file doesn't exist, it sends a 404 not found error.\n\nThat's it! Your server is now set up to handle file uploads and downloads.\n\nTo test the upload endpoint, you can use a tool like Postman or cURL. Here's an example using cURL:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST -F 'file=@path/to/your/file.txt' http://localhost:3000/upload\n```\n\nReplace `path/to/your/file.txt` with the actual path to the file you want to upload.\n\nTo download a file, simply navigate to `http://localhost:3000/download/filename.txt` in your web browser or use a tool like cURL:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:3000/download/filename.txt -o downloaded_file.txt\n```\n\nReplace `filename.txt` with the name of the file you want to download, and `downloaded_file.txt` with the desired name for the downloaded file.\n\nRemember to handle errors and edge cases in a production environment, such as validating file types, sizes, and ensuring that only authorized users can upload and download files.\n\nI hope this helps you set up your file upload and download server using Node.js and Express!
