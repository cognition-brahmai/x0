        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a company with 100 employees. First, we need to find out how many of these employees are managers and how many are non-managers.\n\nGiven that 40% of the employees are managers, we can calculate the number of managers as follows:\n\nNumber of managers = 40% of 100 employees = 0.40 * 100 = 40 managers\n\nNow, since there are 100 employees in total, the number of non-managers would be:\n\nNumber of non-managers = Total employees - Number of managers = 100 - 40 = 60 non-managers\n\nNext, we're told that 60% of the managers have a degree. So, let's find out how many managers have a degree:\n\nManagers with a degree = 60% of 40 managers = 0.60 * 40 = 24 managers\n\nSimilarly, among the non-managers, 25% have a degree. So, the number of non-managers with a degree is:\n\nNon-managers with a degree = 25% of 60 non-managers = 0.25 * 60 = 15 non-managers\n\nNow, to find the total number of employees with a degree, we add the managers with a degree and the non-managers with a degree:\n\nTotal employees with a degree = Managers with a degree + Non-managers with a degree = 24 + 15 = 39 employees\n\nFinally, to find the percentage of total employees who have a degree, we use the formula:\n\nPercentage with a degree = (Total employees with a degree / Total employees) * 100 = (39 / 100) * 100 = 39%\n\nSo, 39% of the total employees have a degree.\n\n**Summary of steps:**\n\n1. Calculate the number of managers: 40% of 100 = 40 managers\n2. Calculate the number of non-managers: 100 - 40 = 60 non-managers\n3. Calculate managers with a degree: 60% of 40 = 24 managers\n4. Calculate non-managers with a degree: 25% of 60 = 15 non-managers\n5. Calculate total employees with a degree: 24 + 15 = 39 employees\n6. Calculate the percentage: (39 / 100) * 100 = 39%\n\n**Final answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{39\\%} \\]"
