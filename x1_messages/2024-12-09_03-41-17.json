        "content": "So there are 7 red balls and 5 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 12 balls. I need to find the probability that both balls picked are red, and I replace the first ball before picking the second one.\n\nFirst, I should find the probability of picking a red ball on the first draw. Since there are 7 red balls out of 12 total balls, the probability is 7/12.\n\nNow, because I'm replacing the ball after the first draw, the total number of balls remains the same for the second draw. So, the probability of picking a red ball on the second draw is also 7/12.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening together (both picks being red), I need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, the probability of both picks being red is (7/12) * (7/12).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n7/12 * 7/12 = 49/144.\n\nSo, the probability is 49/144.\n\nWait, but I should check if this is the simplest form. Let's see, 49 and 144 don't have any common factors other than 1, so it's already in simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of percentages. To convert 49/144 to a percentage, I can divide 49 by 144 and then multiply by 100.\n\n49 \u00f7 144 = approximately 0.3402777...\n\nMultiply by 100: about 34.03%.\n\nSo, there's roughly a 34.03% chance that both balls picked are red.\n\nBut I think the fraction 49/144 is a more precise answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could leave it as a decimal: approximately 0.3403.\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify, I'll stick with the fraction.\n\nSo, the final answer is 49/144.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{49}{144}} \\]"
