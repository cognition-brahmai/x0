        "content": "So, I've got this little riddle here: \"Late afternoons I often bathe. I'll soak in water piping hot. My essence goes through. My see through clothes. Used up am I - I've gone to pot.\" Hmm, interesting. Let's break this down bit by bit.\n\nFirst line: \"Late afternoons I often bathe.\" So, something that happens regularly in the late afternoon, involving bathing. Bathing could mean immersing in water, right? So, maybe it's something that needs to be cleaned or refreshed.\n\nSecond line: \"I'll soak in water piping hot.\" Okay, so the water is hot, specifically \"piping hot,\" which means very hot, almost boiling maybe. So, whatever this object is, it can handle hot water without being damaged.\n\nThird line: \"My essence goes through. My see through clothes.\" This is a bit tricky. \"Essence goes through\" might mean that some vital part of it is transferred or released when it's soaked in hot water. \"See through clothes\" could refer to something transparent or perhaps porous, allowing things to pass through.\n\nLast line: \"Used up am I - I've gone to pot.\" This suggests that after this process, the object is depleted or spent. \"Gone to pot\" is an idiom that means to deteriorate or fall into disrepair, but in this context, it might mean that it's no longer useful or has served its purpose.\n\nPutting it all together: something that is used regularly in the late afternoon, soaked in hot water, releases its essence through its porous or transparent covering, and after use, it's considered spent or used up.\n\nLet me think about what this could be. Could it be a tea bag? Tea bags are often used in the afternoon, steeped in hot water, release their essence (the tea), and after use, they're discarded.\n\nBut the riddle says \"see through clothes,\" which might not directly apply to tea bags, unless we consider that tea bags are made of a porous material that allows the tea to seep out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a coffee filter, but coffee is more commonly associated with mornings, not late afternoons.\n\nAnother possibility is a spice bag used in cooking, where spices are soaked in hot water or broth to flavor a dish, and then discarded.\n\nBut the \"see through clothes\" part makes me think it's something more transparent.\n\nWait, maybe it's a French press or a coffee press, where you steep grounds in hot water, and the plunger acts as a filter. But that doesn't really match the \"see through clothes\" description.\n\nLet me think differently. Could it be a type of paper or cloth used for straining or filtering something in the kitchen?\n\nOr perhaps it's something used in beauty or hygiene, like a compress or a washcloth, but that doesn't quite fit with \"essence goes through.\"\n\nWait a minute, maybe it's a poultice, like a herbal remedy applied to the skin, which is soaked in hot water to release its medicinal properties.\n\nBut that might not align perfectly with the \"see through clothes\" line.\n\nAnother angle: could it be a type of tea, but not in a bag, maybe loose tea that's steeped in hot water, and the used leaves are discarded?\n\nBut again, that doesn't fully capture the \"see through clothes\" part.\n\nPerhaps it's something more literal, like a porous container that holds something, and when soaked in hot water, the contents are released.\n\nWait, maybe it's a tea egg, which is a Chinese tea infuser made of metal with small holes, used to steep tea or herbs.\n\nThat could work because it's porous due to the holes, and after use, it's discarded or cleaned.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the \"see through clothes.\" Metal isn't see-through.\n\nUnless \"see through clothes\" refers to something that appears transparent or barely there, like fine mesh.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a piece of cloth used to strain something, like a cheesecloth.\n\nCheesecloths are made of thin, loosely woven fabric, which is semi-transparent, and when soaked in hot water, whatever is being strained releases its essence.\n\nAfter use, the cheesecloth with the spent materials is discarded.\n\nThat seems plausible.\n\nLet me check each line against this assumption.\n\n\"Late afternoons I often bathe.\" \u2013 Cheesecloth is used in cooking, which might happen in the afternoon.\n\n\"I'll soak in water piping hot.\" \u2013 Yes, in cooking, hot water or broth is used.\n\n\"My essence goes through. My see through clothes.\" \u2013 The essence (flavors) of whatever is being strained passes through the cheesecloth.\n\n\"Used up am I - I've gone to pot.\" \u2013 After use, the cheesecloth with the spent materials is discarded or \"gone to pot.\"\n\nThis seems to fit quite well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a tea strainer, which is often made of metal with small holes, allowing the tea to pass through while holding back the leaves.\n\nBut again, metal isn't see-through; it's more opaque.\n\nUnless \"see through clothes\" refers to the openness of the mesh, allowing vision through the holes.\n\nBut that might be stretching the meaning.\n\nComparatively, cheesecloth seems more transparent and fits better with \"see through clothes.\"\n\nAnother possibility is a paper filter, like those used in coffee makers or some tea infusers.\n\nPaper can be semi-transparent, especially when wet, and after use, it's discarded.\n\nSo, perhaps that's another candidate.\n\n\"Late afternoons I often bathe.\" \u2013 Could be used in preparing tea or coffee in the afternoon.\n\n\"I'll soak in water piping hot.\" \u2013 Hot water is used to steep tea or coffee.\n\n\"My essence goes through. My see through clothes.\" \u2013 The essence (beverage) passes through the paper filter, which is somewhat see-through.\n\n\"Used up am I - I've gone to pot.\" \u2013 After use, the paper filter is discarded.\n\nThis also fits well.\n\nBetween cheesecloth and a paper filter, both seem to match the riddle quite well.\n\nPerhaps the answer is a paper filter or a tea bag, since tea bags are also often used in the afternoon and are made of a porous material that's somewhat see-through.\n\nTea bags are widely used, and after use, they're discarded, aligning with \"used up am I - I've gone to pot.\"\n\nAlso, the \"see through clothes\" could refer to the thin, translucent material that tea bags are made of.\n\nI think that makes the most sense.\n\nSo, the answer to the riddle is a tea bag.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{tea bag}} \\]"
