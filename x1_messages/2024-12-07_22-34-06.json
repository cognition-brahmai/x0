        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the city's water treatment plant needs to upgrade its filtration system because the population is growing, and that means more water is needed. Currently, the system can handle 10 million gallons of water per day, but in five years, the demand is expected to be 15 million gallons per day. We need to find out two things: first, the percentage increase in processing capacity needed, and second, the cost of upgrading the system, given that each additional million gallons of daily capacity costs $500,000.\n\nAlright, starting with the percentage increase in processing capacity. To find the percentage increase, I know I need to look at how much the capacity needs to go up and then compare that to the original capacity. So, the increase needed is the projected demand minus the current capacity. That would be 15 million gallons minus 10 million gallons, which is 5 million gallons. Now, to find the percentage increase, I think I should divide that increase by the original capacity and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. So, 5 million divided by 10 million is 0.5, and 0.5 times 100 is 50%. So, the processing capacity needs to increase by 50%.\n\nNow, for the cost of upgrading the system. It says that each additional million gallons of daily capacity requires an investment of $500,000. Since we need to add 5 million gallons of capacity, I can multiply the additional capacity needed by the cost per million gallons. So, 5 million gallons times $500,000 per million gallons. Wait a minute, that doesn't seem right. If each million gallons requires $500,000, then for 5 million gallons, it should be 5 times $500,000, which is $2,500,000. So, the total cost of the upgrade would be $2,500,000.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe there's something I'm missing. The current capacity is 10 million gallons, and we need to go to 15 million gallons, which is an increase of 5 million gallons. Each million gallons costs $500,000 to add. So, 5 million gallons times $500,000 per million gallons is indeed $2,500,000. That seems straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider whether the current system can be modified or if a completely new system needs to be built. But the problem doesn't mention any constraints like that, so I think assuming that we're just adding to the existing system is fine.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the percentage increase is calculated correctly. I have the increase being 5 million gallons from 10 million gallons, which is indeed a 50% increase. Another way to think about it is that the new capacity is 150% of the original capacity, which means it's a 50% increase. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nIs there anything else I need to consider? The problem seems pretty straightforward. We have the current capacity, the projected demand, the increase needed, and the cost per additional million gallons. Plugging in those numbers gives us the percentage increase and the total cost.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. So, to summarize, the processing capacity needs to increase by 50%, and the cost of upgrading the system will be $2,500,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50\\% \\text{ increase in processing capacity, } \\$2,500,000 \\text{ upgrade cost}} \\]"
