        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains, one leaving from Station A going towards Station B, and the other leaving from Station B going towards Station A. The distance between the two stations is 300 miles. Train A is moving at 60 miles per hour, and Train B is moving at 40 miles per hour. I need to find out when they will meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that since both trains are moving towards each other, their speeds will add up relative to each other. So, the combined speed at which they are approaching each other is 60 mph + 40 mph, which is 100 mph.\n\nNow, if they are covering a distance of 300 miles together at a combined speed of 100 mph, the time it will take for them to meet can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 300 miles / 100 mph = 3 hours\n\nSo, the two trains will meet each other in 3 hours.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of the distance each train covers individually until they meet.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time until they meet as t hours.\n\nIn t hours, Train A will have traveled a distance of 60t miles (since distance = speed \u00d7 time).\n\nSimilarly, Train B will have traveled 40t miles in the same time.\n\nWhen they meet, the sum of the distances they have traveled will be equal to the total distance between the two stations, which is 300 miles.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation:\n\n60t + 40t = 300\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n100t = 300\n\nNow, solving for t:\n\nt = 300 / 100 = 3 hours\n\nOkay, this matches my previous calculation. So, it seems that the two trains will meet after 3 hours.\n\nLet me consider if there\u2019s any other factor I should account for, like whether the trains are moving at constant speeds, or if there\u2019s any acceleration involved. The problem doesn\u2019t mention anything about acceleration, so I can assume that they are moving at constant speeds.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. Both speeds are given in miles per hour, and the distance is in miles, so the time will indeed be in hours.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the concept of relative speed. When two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So, again, that\u2019s 60 mph + 40 mph = 100 mph.\n\nThen, the time until they meet is the total distance divided by their relative speed, which is 300 miles / 100 mph = 3 hours.\n\nI think this is solid. But to be absolutely sure, let\u2019s consider the positions of the trains at different times.\n\nAfter 1 hour:\n\n- Train A has traveled 60 miles (from A towards B)\n\n- Train B has traveled 40 miles (from B towards A)\n\n- Remaining distance between them: 300 - 60 - 40 = 200 miles\n\nAfter 2 hours:\n\n- Train A has traveled 120 miles\n\n- Train B has traveled 80 miles\n\n- Remaining distance: 300 - 120 - 80 = 100 miles\n\nAfter 3 hours:\n\n- Train A has traveled 180 miles\n\n- Train B has traveled 120 miles\n\n- Total distance covered together: 180 + 120 = 300 miles\n\nSo, they have covered the entire 300 miles between them, meaning they meet at this point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is indeed 3 hours.\n\nJust to be thorough, let\u2019s consider if one train starts before the other or if there\u2019s any head start, but the problem states that both trains leave at the same time, so that\u2019s not an issue.\n\nAlso, I should consider if the trains are moving on the same track or if there\u2019s any chance they might not meet, but since they are heading towards each other, they are bound to meet at some point.\n\nI think I\u2019ve covered all the bases here. The answer is that the two trains will meet each other in 3 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
