        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is (4 * 2) + (5^2) - (8 / 2). First, I need to remember the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\n1. (4 * 2) = 8\n\n2. (5^2) = 25\n\n3. (8 / 2) = 4\n\nNow, plugging these values back into the expression, it becomes:\n\n8 + 25 - 4\n\nNext, I perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n\n8 + 25 = 33\n\nThen, 33 - 4 = 29\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 29."
