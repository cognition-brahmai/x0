        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a book has 450 pages, and I read 15 pages every day. I need to find out how many days it'll take to finish the book. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have a total number of pages, which is 450, and I'm reading 15 pages each day. I need to find out how many days it will take to read all 450 pages.\n\nWell, this seems like a division problem. If I divide the total number of pages by the number of pages I read each day, that should give me the number of days required.\n\nSo, let's write that out:\n\nTotal pages: 450\n\nPages per day: 15\n\nNumber of days: 450 \u00f7 15\n\nNow, I need to do the division. Let's see, 15 times what number equals 450.\n\nI know that 15 times 30 is 450 because 15 times 10 is 150, and 15 times 20 is 300, so 15 times 30 is 450.\n\nSo, 450 divided by 15 is 30.\n\nTherefore, it will take 30 days to finish the book if I read 15 pages every day.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If I multiply 15 pages by 30 days, I should get back to 450 pages.\n\n15 times 30 is indeed 450. So, that checks out.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using multiplication or addition to verify.\n\nWell, if I read 15 pages each day for 30 days, that's 15 plus 15 plus ... and so on, 30 times. But that would take forever to add up manually.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so maybe calculate how many weeks it would take.\n\nBut the question is in days, so maybe it's simpler to stick with days.\n\nIs there any other factor to consider here? Like, maybe some days I read more or less, but the problem says I read 15 pages every day, so it's consistent.\n\nAlright, so I think 30 days is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any remainder when dividing 450 by 15.\n\n450 divided by 15 is 30 with no remainder, because 15 times 30 is exactly 450.\n\nSo, no extra days needed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 30 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
