        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company that sells its product for $100 per unit. They offer a discount of 15% on each unit and still manage to make a profit of $25 per unit. We need to find out what their cost price per unit is.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a discount means in this context. A discount reduces the selling price of the product. So, if they offer a 15% discount on the $100 product, the selling price after the discount will be less than $100.\n\nLet me calculate the selling price after the discount.\n\nOriginal selling price: $100\n\nDiscount: 15% of $100\n\nDiscount amount: 0.15 * $100 = $15\n\nSo, selling price after discount: $100 - $15 = $85\n\nNow, the company still makes a profit of $25 per unit even after this discount.\n\nProfit is calculated as selling price minus cost price.\n\nSo, profit = selling price after discount - cost price\n\nWe know the profit is $25 and the selling price after discount is $85.\n\nSo, $25 = $85 - cost price\n\nTo find the cost price, I can rearrange this equation:\n\nCost price = $85 - $25 = $60\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check if I'm missing anything.\n\nIs there any other factor that could affect the cost price or the profit?\n\nThe problem seems straightforward: they sell at $100, give a 15% discount to make $85, and still make a $25 profit per unit.\n\nSo, cost price should indeed be $85 - $25 = $60.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of the formula:\n\nSelling price = cost price + profit\n\nGiven that, after the discount, selling price is $85 and profit is $25, so cost price is $85 - $25 = $60.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to be thorough, I can consider the discount as a reduction from the marked price to the selling price.\n\nMarked price: $100\n\nDiscount: 15% of $100 = $15\n\nSelling price: $100 - $15 = $85\n\nProfit: $25\n\nCost price: selling price - profit = $85 - $25 = $60\n\nEverything points to the cost price being $60 per unit.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose they make a profit of $25 per unit even after the discount. That means, regardless of the discount, their cost remains the same.\n\nSo, cost price is fixed, and the selling price after discount is $85, which gives them $25 profit.\n\nSo, again, cost price is $85 - $25 = $60.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's think about it differently.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the cost price is C.\n\nThey sell at $100 with a 15% discount, so selling price is $85.\n\nProfit is selling price minus cost price, which is $85 - C.\n\nWe know profit is $25, so:\n\n$85 - C = $25\n\nTherefore, C = $85 - $25 = $60\n\nYes, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to express it in terms of equations:\n\nLet C be the cost price.\n\nSelling price after discount, S = $85\n\nProfit, P = $25\n\nWe know that S = C + P\n\nSo, $85 = C + $25\n\nTherefore, C = $85 - $25 = $60\n\nIt\u2019s consistent across different approaches.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any trick or additional layers in this problem. It seems to be a straightforward profit and loss calculation with a discount involved.\n\nSo, the cost price per unit is $60.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
