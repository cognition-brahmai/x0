        "content": "Let's break this down. So, John is renting a car from this company, and they have a flat fee of $20 per day plus 10 cents for every mile he drives. He's renting it for 3 days and driving it for 200 miles. I need to find out the total cost for him.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the cost for the days he rents the car. Since it's $20 per day and he rents it for 3 days, I can multiply 20 by 3. That should give me the total fee for the rental period.\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\nSo, $60 for renting the car for 3 days.\n\nNext, he drives it for 200 miles, and they charge 10 cents per mile. So, I need to calculate 10 cents times 200 miles. But since 10 cents is $0.10, I can multiply 0.10 by 200.\n\n0.10 * 200 = 20\n\nSo, that's an additional $20 for the miles driven.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I just need to add the two amounts together:\n\n60 + 20 = 80\n\nTherefore, John will be charged $80 in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps there's a formula or something I should be using.\n\nLet me think. The total cost (C) is equal to the daily fee multiplied by the number of days (d) plus the mileage fee per mile (m) multiplied by the number of miles driven (miles).\n\nSo, C = (daily fee * d) + (mileage fee * miles)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nC = (20 * 3) + (0.10 * 200)\n\nThat's the same as before:\n\nC = 60 + 20 = 80\n\nOkay, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of total fee per day including mileage, but that seems more complicated. I think the way I did it is straightforward and makes sense.\n\nI can also consider if there are any additional fees or taxes, but based on the information given, it seems like just these two components make up the total cost.\n\nSo, I'm confident that $80 is the correct total charge for John.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]\n"
