        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. We have three bags: A, B, and C, each containing different colored balls. We're supposed to pick one ball from each bag and find the probability that exactly one of those balls is red.\n\nFirst, let's list out what's in each bag:\n\n- Bag A: 3 red, 4 blue\n\n- Bag B: 5 red, 3 green\n\n- Bag C: 6 blue, 2 yellow\n\nSo, total balls in each bag are:\n\n- Bag A: 3 + 4 = 7 balls\n\n- Bag B: 5 + 3 = 8 balls\n\n- Bag C: 6 + 2 = 8 balls\n\nWe need exactly one red ball out of the three picks. That means we have to consider the scenarios where:\n\n1. The ball from Bag A is red, and the balls from B and C are not red.\n\n2. The ball from Bag B is red, and the balls from A and C are not red.\n\n3. The ball from Bag C is red, and the balls from A and B are not red.\n\nWait a minute, but looking at the contents again, Bag C does not contain any red balls. So, the third scenario isn't possible. Therefore, we only need to consider the first two scenarios.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for each scenario separately and then add them up.\n\n**Scenario 1:** Ball from Bag A is red, balls from B and C are not red.\n\n- Probability of picking a red ball from Bag A: 3/7\n\n- Probability of not picking a red ball from Bag B: Since Bag B has 5 red and 3 green, the probability of picking green (not red) is 3/8\n\n- Probability of not picking a red ball from Bag C: Bag C has no red balls, so this probability is 1 (since any ball picked will not be red)\n\nSo, the probability for Scenario 1 is (3/7) * (3/8) * 1 = 9/56\n\n**Scenario 2:** Ball from Bag B is red, balls from A and C are not red.\n\n- Probability of picking a red ball from Bag B: 5/8\n\n- Probability of not picking a red ball from Bag A: Bag A has 3 red and 4 blue, so probability of blue is 4/7\n\n- Probability of not picking a red ball from Bag C: Again, 1, since no red balls\n\nSo, the probability for Scenario 2 is (5/8) * (4/7) * 1 = 20/56\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of these two scenarios to get the total probability of having exactly one red ball:\n\n9/56 + 20/56 = 29/56\n\nWait, but let's double-check this. Maybe there's another way to approach it.\n\nAlternatively, we could calculate the total number of ways to pick one ball from each bag and then count the number of favorable outcomes where exactly one ball is red.\n\nTotal number of ways:\n\n7 (from A) * 8 (from B) * 8 (from C) = 448 possible outcomes\n\nNow, favorable outcomes:\n\n- Scenario 1: Red from A, not red from B, any from C (but since C has no red, it's automatically not red)\n\nNumber of ways: 3 (red from A) * 3 (green from B) * 8 (from C) = 72 ways\n\n- Scenario 2: Red from B, not red from A, any from C (again, C has no red)\n\nNumber of ways: 5 (red from B) * 4 (blue from A) * 8 (from C) = 160 ways\n\nTotal favorable outcomes: 72 + 160 = 232\n\nTherefore, probability is 232 / 448\n\nLet's simplify this fraction:\n\n232 \u00f7 8 = 29\n\n448 \u00f7 8 = 56\n\nSo, 29/56\n\nThat matches our earlier calculation.\n\nIs there any other way this could be interpreted? For example, could there be a dependency between the picks or some conditional probability involved? From the problem statement, it seems that picks from each bag are independent.\n\nAnother angle: since Bag C doesn't have any red balls, we don't need to worry about it concerning red balls, which simplifies things.\n\nAlso, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's a possibility of picking more than one red ball. But since we need exactly one red ball, we've already excluded those cases by only considering scenarios where only one bag contributes a red ball.\n\nI think 29/56 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{29}{56}} \\]"
