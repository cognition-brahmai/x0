        "content": "Let's see. There are three siblings: Alice, Bob, and Carol. The sum of their ages is 60 years. Alice is twice as old as Bob, and Carol is 5 years younger than Alice. I need to find out how old Bob is.\n\nOkay, first, I should assign variables to their ages to make it easier to work with. Let's say:\n\n- Let B represent Bob's age.\n\n- Since Alice is twice as old as Bob, Alice's age would be 2B.\n\n- Carol is 5 years younger than Alice, so Carol's age would be 2B - 5.\n\nNow, the sum of their ages is 60, so I can write the equation:\n\nB + 2B + (2B - 5) = 60\n\nLet me simplify that:\n\nB + 2B + 2B - 5 = 60\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n5B - 5 = 60\n\nNow, I'll add 5 to both sides to isolate the terms with B:\n\n5B - 5 + 5 = 60 + 5\n\n5B = 65\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\n\n5B / 5 = 65 / 5\n\nB = 13\n\nSo, Bob is 13 years old.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nIf Bob is 13, then Alice is twice that, so 26.\n\nCarol is 5 years younger than Alice, so 26 - 5 = 21.\n\nNow, sum them up: 13 + 26 + 21 = 60.\n\nYes, that matches the total sum given. So, Bob is indeed 13 years old.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
