        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 1500 units of product A and 2000 units of product B in one day. Each unit of product A needs 4 minutes of labor, and each unit of product B needs 6 minutes of labor. I need to find out the total hours of labor required for one day's production.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total labor minutes for product A. That would be the number of units times the labor per unit. So, for product A: 1500 units * 4 minutes/unit = 6000 minutes.\n\nNext, for product B: 2000 units * 6 minutes/unit = 12,000 minutes.\n\nNow, I add the labor minutes for both products to get the total labor minutes for the day: 6000 minutes + 12,000 minutes = 18,000 minutes.\n\nBut the question asks for hours of labor, not minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so I need to convert minutes to hours by dividing by 60.\n\nTotal hours = 18,000 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 300 hours.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there any other way to look at this?\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total labor required per unit for both products and then multiply by the number of units.\n\nBut no, that might complicate things. The initial approach seems correct.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\n1500 units of A * 4 minutes = 6000 minutes.\n\n2000 units of B * 6 minutes = 12,000 minutes.\n\nTotal minutes: 6000 + 12,000 = 18,000 minutes.\n\nNow, 18,000 minutes divided by 60 equals 300 hours.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, the factory requires 300 hours of labor for one day's production.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
