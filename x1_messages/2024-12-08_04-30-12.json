Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\nHere's how you can implement bubble sort in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfunction bubbleSort(arr) {\n    let n = arr.length;\n    for (let i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {\n        for (let j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) {\n            if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {\n                // Swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]\n                let temp = arr[j];\n                arr[j] = arr[j+1];\n                arr[j+1] = temp;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return arr;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nlet array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90];\nconsole.log(bubbleSort(array)); // Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We define a function `bubbleSort` that takes an array `arr` as its parameter.\n\n- We get the length of the array and store it in variable `n`.\n\n- We use two nested loops. The outer loop runs from the first element to the second last element.\n\n- The inner loop compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n\n- This process repeats until no more swaps are needed, which indicates that the array is sorted.\n\n- Finally, the sorted array is returned.\n\nYou can test this function with different arrays to see how it works. Let me know if you have any questions or need further explanation!"
