        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here. There's a product that costs $150, and there are two discounts being applied: first, 20% off the original price, and then an additional 15% off the already discounted price. I need to find out what the final price is after both discounts.\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to understand how discounts work. When you have a percentage discount, you're essentially reducing the price by that percentage. So, a 20% discount means you're paying 80% of the original price, right? Because 100% - 20% = 80%.\n\nSo, for the first discount:\n\nOriginal price: $150\n\nDiscount: 20% of $150\n\nTo calculate 20% of $150, I can multiply 150 by 0.20.\n\n$150 * 0.20 = $30\n\nSo, the first discount saves me $30.\n\nNow, to find the price after the first discount:\n\n$150 - $30 = $120\n\nAlright, so after the first discount, the price is $120.\n\nNow, there's an additional 15% off this discounted price. So, I need to calculate 15% of $120.\n\n15% of $120 is $120 * 0.15 = $18\n\nSo, the second discount is $18.\n\nNow, subtract that from the already discounted price:\n\n$120 - $18 = $102\n\nTherefore, the final price after both discounts is $102.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe a quicker way to calculate it without finding each discount separately.\n\nI've heard of combining percentages, but I'm not sure if that applies here because the second discount is applied to the already discounted price, not the original price.\n\nLet me think about this. If I were to combine the discounts, I'd need to find the total percentage discount.\n\nFirst discount is 20%, second is 15% off the already discounted price.\n\nSo, it's not just 20% + 15% = 35%, because the second discount is applied to a smaller amount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as applying two successive multiplicative discounts.\n\nFirst, 20% off is the same as multiplying by 0.80 (since 100% - 20% = 80%).\n\nThen, 15% off on the new price is multiplying by 0.85 (since 100% - 15% = 85%).\n\nSo, the overall multiplication factor would be 0.80 * 0.85.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.80 * 0.85 = 0.68\n\nSo, overall, it's a 68% of the original price.\n\nTo find the final price, multiply the original price by 0.68:\n\n$150 * 0.68 = $102\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier by calculating each discount step by step.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same final price of $102.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can calculate the total discount percentage.\n\nOriginal price: $150\n\nFinal price: $102\n\nTotal discount: $150 - $102 = $48\n\nTotal discount percentage: ($48 / $150) * 100% = 32%\n\nWait, but earlier I got 68% of the original price, which implies a 32% total discount.\n\nBut when I added the discounts separately, 20% + 15% = 35%, which seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, no, that's because the second discount is applied to the already discounted price, not the original price.\n\nSo, the total discount isn't just the sum of the individual discounts.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I had added the discounts directly, I would get an incorrect total discount percentage.\n\nSo, the correct final price is indeed $102.\n\nI think that's accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{102} \\]"
