        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular method for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights. I'll guide you through implementing it in Python using an adjacency matrix representation.\n\nFirst, let's understand the basics of Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Set the distance to the starting node as 0 and to all other nodes as infinity.\n   - Create a set to keep track of vertices whose shortest paths have been determined.\n\n2. **Main Loop**:\n   - Select the vertex with the smallest distance that has not been finalized yet.\n   - For the current vertex, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current vertex.\n   - If the new path's distance is less than the previously recorded distance, update the distance.\n   - Repeat this process until all nodes are visited or the target node is reached.\n\n3. **Path Reconstruction**:\n   - Keep track of the previous node for each node to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\nNow, let's proceed to implement this in Python.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement Dijkstra's algorithm in Python for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph represented by an adjacency matrix, follow the steps below.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Set the distance to the starting node as 0 and to all other nodes as infinity.\n   - Use a list to keep track of the nodes whose shortest paths have been determined.\n\n2. **Main Loop**:\n   - Select the node with the smallest distance that has not been processed yet.\n   - For the current node, update the distances of its unprocessed neighbors.\n   - Repeat this process until all nodes are processed or the target node is reached.\n\n3. **Path Reconstruction**:\n   - Maintain a list to track the previous node for each node to reconstruct the path.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef dijkstra(adj_matrix, start, end):\n    n = len(adj_matrix)\n    import sys\n    INF = sys.maxsize\n    \n    # Initialize distances and visited list\n    distances = [INF] * n\n    distances[start] = 0\n    visited = [False] * n\n    path = [-1] * n  # To keep track of the path\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        # Select the node with the smallest distance\n        min_distance = INF\n        min_index = -1\n        for v in range(n):\n            if not visited[v] and distances[v] < min_distance:\n                min_distance = distances[v]\n                min_index = v\n        \n        # Mark the selected node as visited\n        visited[min_index] = True\n        \n        # Update distances of the adjacent vertices\n        for v in range(n):\n            if adj_matrix[min_index][v] and not visited[v]:\n                new_distance = distances[min_index] + adj_matrix[min_index][v]\n                if new_distance < distances[v]:\n                    distances[v] = new_distance\n                    path[v] = min_index\n    \n    # Reconstruct the path\n    path_list = []\n    current = end\n    while current != -1:\n        path_list.append(current)\n        current = path[current]\n    path_list.reverse()\n    \n    if distances[end] == INF:\n        return \"No path exists\", None\n    else:\n        return path_list, distances[end]\n\n# Example usage:\nadj_matrix = [\n    [0, 10, 20, 0, 0],\n    [10, 0, 5, 16, 20],\n    [20, 5, 0, 20, 1],\n    [0, 16, 20, 0, 2],\n    [0, 20, 1, 2, 0]\n]\nstart = 0\nend = 4\nprint(dijkstra(adj_matrix, start, end))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Initialization**: Distances are set to infinity except for the start node, which is set to 0.\n- **Selecting the Node with the Smallest Distance**: In each iteration, select the unvisited node with the smallest distance.\n- **Updating Distances**: For each neighbor of the selected node, calculate the new distance through the current node and update if it's smaller.\n- **Path Reconstruction**: Use the `path` list to track the path from the start to the end node.\n\nThis implementation ensures that we find the shortest path in a graph with non-negative weights efficiently."
