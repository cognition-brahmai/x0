        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. The company has a budget of $10,000 for employee bonuses, but they need to deduct a 5% administrative fee first. After that, the remaining amount will be divided equally among the 20 employees. So, I need to find out how much each employee will get.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the administrative fee. It's 5% of the $10,000 budget. To find 5% of $10,000, I can multiply 10,000 by 0.05 (since 5% equals 0.05 in decimal form).\n\nAdministrative fee = $10,000 * 0.05 = $500\n\nNow, I need to subtract this administrative fee from the total budget to find out how much is left for the bonuses.\n\nRemaining budget = $10,000 - $500 = $9,500\n\nThis $9,500 will be divided equally among the 20 employees. So, to find out how much each employee gets, I need to divide $9,500 by 20.\n\nBonus per employee = $9,500 / 20\n\nLet me do that calculation.\n\n$9,500 divided by 20 is $475.\n\nSo, each employee will receive a bonus of $475.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check the calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst, the administrative fee is 5% of $10,000, which is indeed $500.\n\nThen, subtracting $500 from $10,000 gives $9,500.\n\nDividing $9,500 by 20 employees should be $475 per employee.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of percentages. If they deduct 5%, that means 95% of the budget is left for the bonuses.\n\nSo, 95% of $10,000 is $9,500, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, dividing that by 20 gives $475 per employee.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the bonus per employee directly.\n\nIf the total budget after deductions is $9,500, and there are 20 employees, then $9,500 / 20 = $475.\n\nI can also check if the total bonuses add up to the remaining budget.\n\nIf each employee gets $475, and there are 20 employees, then total bonuses are $475 * 20 = $9,500, which matches the remaining budget after the administrative fee.\n\nSo, it all checks out.\n\nTherefore, each employee will receive a bonus of $475.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{475} \\]"
