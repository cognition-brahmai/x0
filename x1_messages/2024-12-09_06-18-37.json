        "content": "Alright, let's dive into this. I need to design a database for a school that includes students, teachers, courses, and grades. Then, I have to write some SQL queries to fetch specific information from this database.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the entities and their relationships. In a school, we have students who take courses, teachers who teach courses, and grades that are assigned to students for each course they take.\n\nLet me start by defining the tables:\n\n1. **Students Table**\n\n   - student_id (Primary Key)\n\n   - first_name\n\n   - last_name\n\n   - date_of_birth\n\n   - grade_level\n\n2. **Teachers Table**\n\n   - teacher_id (Primary Key)\n\n   - first_name\n\n   - last_name\n\n   - hire_date\n\n3. **Courses Table**\n\n   - course_id (Primary Key)\n\n   - course_name\n\n   - teacher_id (Foreign Key to Teachers)\n\n4. **Grades Table**\n\n   - grade_id (Primary Key)\n\n   - student_id (Foreign Key to Students)\n\n   - course_id (Foreign Key to Courses)\n\n   - grade_value\n\nOkay, so with these tables, I can represent the relationships between students, teachers, courses, and grades.\n\nNow, let's move on to the queries.\n\n**Query 1: Find all students taking a particular course.**\n\nAssume the particular course is \"Mathematics\".\n\nI need to join the Students and Grades tables on student_id, and the Grades and Courses tables on course_id, and then filter where course_name is \"Mathematics\".\n\nHere's how I can write this query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT s.student_id, s.first_name, s.last_name\nFROM Students s\nJOIN Grades g ON s.student_id = g.student_id\nJOIN Courses c ON g.course_id = c.course_id\nWHERE c.course_name = 'Mathematics';\n```\n\n**Query 2: Calculate the average grade for each course.**\n\nFor this, I need to group the grades by course_id and calculate the average of grade_value.\n\n```sql\nSELECT c.course_id, c.course_name, AVG(g.grade_value) as average_grade\nFROM Courses c\nJOIN Grades g ON c.course_id = g.course_id\nGROUP BY c.course_id, c.course_name;\n```\n\n**Query 3: List all teachers along with the number of courses they teach.**\n\nI need to join the Teachers and Courses tables on teacher_id, and then count the number of courses per teacher.\n\n```sql\nSELECT t.teacher_id, t.first_name, t.last_name, COUNT(c.course_id) as number_of_courses\nFROM Teachers t\nLEFT JOIN Courses c ON t.teacher_id = c.teacher_id\nGROUP BY t.teacher_id, t.first_name, t.last_name;\n```\n\nI used a LEFT JOIN here to include teachers who might not be teaching any courses yet.\n\n**Query 4: Identify students who are failing in more than one course.**\n\nAssume that a failing grade is anything below 60.\n\nI need to find students who have more than one grade below 60.\n\n```sql\nSELECT s.student_id, s.first_name, s.last_name\nFROM Students s\nJOIN Grades g ON s.student_id = g.student_id\nWHERE g.grade_value < 60\nGROUP BY s.student_id, s.first_name, s.last_name\nHAVING COUNT(g.grade_id) > 1;\n```\n\nThis query joins Students and Grades, filters for grades below 60, groups by student, and then uses HAVING to select students with more than one such grade.\n\nAlright, I think that covers all the requirements. Let me double-check:\n\n- Tables: Students, Teachers, Courses, Grades\n\n- Queries:\n\n  1. Students taking a particular course\n\n  2. Average grade per course\n\n  3. Teachers and their course counts\n\n  4. Students failing in more than one course\n\nEverything seems in order. If there's anything else you need, just let me know!"
