        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 10 red balls and 20 blue balls. I need to find the probability that if I pick one ball, replace it, and then pick another ball, both balls are red. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of balls in the box. There are 10 red and 20 blue, so total balls are 10 + 20 = 30 balls.\n\nNow, the probability of picking a red ball in the first draw. Since there are 10 red balls out of 30 total balls, the probability is 10/30, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nOkay, so P(Red1) = 1/3.\n\nNow, because I'm replacing the ball after the first draw, the total number of balls remains the same for the second draw. So, the probability of picking a red ball in the second draw is also 10/30, or 1/3.\n\nP(Red2) = 1/3.\n\nSince these are independent events\u2014because I'm replacing the ball\u2014the probability of both events happening is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, P(Both Red) = P(Red1) * P(Red2) = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Is there another way to look at it?\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of combinations. The total number of ways to pick two balls with replacement is 30 * 30 = 900 possible outcomes.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes, where both balls are red, is 10 * 10 = 100.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 100/900 = 1/9.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might be missing. Is the replacement really not affecting anything here? Well, replacement keeps the probabilities constant for each draw, which is why we can multiply them directly.\n\nIf it was without replacement, the probabilities would change for the second draw, but in this case, it's with replacement, so it's fine.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the probability as:\n\nP(Both Red) = P(Red1 and Red2) = P(Red1) * P(Red2 | Red1)\n\nBut since it's with replacement, P(Red2 | Red1) is equal to P(Red2), which is 1/3.\n\nSo again, P(Both Red) = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.\n\nI think this is solid.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the decimal equivalent to see if it makes sense.\n\n1/9 is approximately 0.111..., which is about 11.1%.\n\nAlternatively, the probability of picking a red ball twice in a row, with replacement, should indeed be around that percentage, given that the probability of picking a red ball once is 1/3 or about 33.3%.\n\nSo, multiplying that probability by itself makes sense to get around 11.1%.\n\nAll right, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{9}} \\]"
