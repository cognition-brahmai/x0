        "content": "Light travels at a speed of approximately 186,282 miles per second. To find out how many miles light travels in one Earth year, we need to multiply this speed by the number of seconds in a year.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of seconds in a minute, hour, day, and year:\n\n- 1 minute = 60 seconds\n\n- 1 hour = 60 minutes \u00d7 60 seconds = 3,600 seconds\n\n- 1 day = 24 hours \u00d7 3,600 seconds = 86,400 seconds\n\n- 1 year = 365.25 days (accounting for leap years) \u00d7 86,400 seconds \u2248 31,557,600 seconds\n\nNow, multiply the speed of light by the number of seconds in a year:\n\n186,282 miles/second \u00d7 31,557,600 seconds \u2248 5,878,625,373,183.6 miles\n\nSo, light travels approximately 5.88 trillion miles in one Earth year.\n\n**Note:** The exact value can vary slightly depending on the precise definition of a year and the speed of light used."
