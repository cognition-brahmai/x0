The company has fixed costs of $200,000.\n   \n   - **Variable Costs:** These are costs that vary with the level of production. The variable cost per unit is $50, and the company produces 10,000 units.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Variable Costs} = \\text{Variable Cost per Unit} \\times \\text{Number of Units}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Variable Costs} = 50 \\times 10,000 = 500,000\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Total Costs:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Costs} = \\text{Fixed Costs} + \\text{Total Variable Costs}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Costs} = 200,000 + 500,000 = 700,000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Total Profit:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Profit} = \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Total Costs}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Profit} = 1,000,000 - 700,000 = 300,000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total profit for the company is $300,000."
