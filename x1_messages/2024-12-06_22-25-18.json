        "content": "Alright, I'm going to create a simple command-line calculator in Python that can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I need to make sure it handles invalid inputs gracefully too. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to get user input for the operation they want to perform and the numbers they want to use. I should probably ask for the operation first, then the two numbers.\n\nI should define functions for each operation to keep the code organized. So, I'll have add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide() functions.\n\nFor error handling, I need to consider a few things:\n\n1. The user might enter an operation that isn't recognized.\n\n2. The user might enter something that isn't a number for the operands.\n\n3. For division, I need to handle division by zero.\n\nI'll use try-except blocks to handle these errors and provide useful messages to the user.\n\nLet me sketch out the structure of the program:\n\n- Print a welcome message\n\n- Present the user with operation choices: add, subtract, multiply, divide\n\n- Ask the user to input the operation they want to perform\n\n- Ask for the two numbers\n\n- Based on the operation, call the corresponding function\n\n- Handle any errors that occur during input or calculation\n\n- Print the result\n\n- Ask the user if they want to perform another calculation\n\nI should also consider making the program loop until the user decides to exit.\n\nLet me think about how to handle the operations. I can use a dictionary to map operation names to their corresponding functions.\n\nFor example:\n\noperations = {\n\n'add': add,\n\n'subtract': subtract,\n\n'multiply': multiply,\n\n'divide': divide\n\n}\n\nThen, based on the user's input, I can look up the function and call it.\n\nNow, for the addition function, it's straightforward: take two numbers and return their sum.\n\nSimilarly for subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the inputs are actually numbers. I'll try to convert the inputs to floats, since people might want to do calculations with decimals.\n\nIf the conversion fails, I'll catch the ValueError and inform the user to enter valid numbers.\n\nFor division, I need to check if the second number is zero. If it is, I'll raise an error and ask the user to enter a non-zero divisor.\n\nI should also consider making the program case-insensitive for the operation names, so that 'ADD', 'Add', 'add', etc., all work.\n\nLet me think about the user interface. I'll probably use input() functions to get user input, and print() to display outputs.\n\nI should also think about how to handle multiple operations. Maybe after one calculation, ask the user if they want to do another one. If they do, repeat the process; if not, exit the program.\n\nI can use a while loop for this, with a flag variable to control whether to continue or not.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nwhile True:\n\n# Print welcome message\n\n# Present operation choices\n\n# Get operation input from user\n\n# Get two number inputs\n\n# Try to convert inputs to float\n\n# Based on operation, call corresponding function\n\n# Handle errors\n\n# Print result\n\n# Ask user if they want to perform another calculation\n\n# If not, break the loop\n\nNow, let's think about the add function:\n\ndef add(a, b):\n\nreturn a + b\n\nSimilarly for the other operations:\n\ndef subtract(a, b):\n\nreturn a - b\n\ndef multiply(a, b):\n\nreturn a * b\n\ndef divide(a, b):\n\nif b == 0:\n\nraise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n\nreturn a / b\n\nI should also think about formatting the output, maybe to a certain number of decimal places, but for simplicity, I'll just use the default float formatting.\n\nLet me consider how to handle invalid operations. If the user enters something other than 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', or 'divide', I should inform them and ask for a valid operation.\n\nI can do this by checking if the operation is in the operations dictionary.\n\nIf not, print an error message and continue to the next iteration.\n\nNow, for the user input, I'll use the input() function, but I need to make sure to strip any extra spaces and convert to lowercase for consistency.\n\nFor example:\n\noperation = input(\"Enter operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide): \").strip().lower()\n\nSimilarly for the numbers:\n\nnum1 = input(\"Enter first number: \").strip()\n\nnum2 = input(\"Enter second number: \").strip()\n\nThen, try to convert num1 and num2 to floats.\n\ntry:\n\na = float(num1)\n\nb = float(num2)\n\nexcept ValueError:\n\nprint(\"Invalid input. Please enter valid numbers.\")\n\ncontinue\n\nThen, look up the operation function.\n\nif operation in operations:\n\nfunc = operations[operation]\n\ntry:\n\nresult = func(a, b)\n\nprint(\"Result:\", result)\n\nexcept ValueError as e:\n\nprint(e)\n\nelse:\n\nprint(\"Invalid operation. Please choose a valid operation.\")\n\nFinally, ask the user if they want to perform another calculation.\n\nuser_choice = input(\"Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): \").strip().lower()\n\nif user_choice != 'yes':\n\nbreak\n\nThis way, the program keeps running until the user decides to stop.\n\nI should also think about edge cases, like dividing by zero, which I've already considered, or entering non-numeric values for numbers.\n\nI should make sure that the program doesn't crash on any input and always provides a useful error message.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the code. I can put the operation functions at the top, then define the main loop.\n\nI can also define the operations dictionary at the top for clarity.\n\nHere's a rough sketch:\n\ndef add(a, b):\n\nreturn a + b\n\ndef subtract(a, b):\n\nreturn a - b\n\ndef multiply(a, b):\n\nreturn a * b\n\ndef divide(a, b):\n\nif b == 0:\n\nraise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n\nreturn a / b\n\noperations = {\n\n'add': add,\n\n'subtract': subtract,\n\n'multiply': multiply,\n\n'divide': divide\n\n}\n\nwhile True:\n\nprint(\"Welcome to the calculator!\")\n\nprint(\"Operations available: add, subtract, multiply, divide\")\n\noperation = input(\"Enter operation: \").strip().lower()\n\nnum1 = input(\"Enter first number: \").strip()\n\nnum2 = input(\"Enter second number: \").strip()\n\ntry:\n\na = float(num1)\n\nb = float(num2)\n\nexcept ValueError:\n\nprint(\"Invalid numbers. Please enter valid numbers.\")\n\ncontinue\n\nif operation in operations:\n\nfunc = operations[operation]\n\ntry:\n\nresult = func(a, b)\n\nprint(\"Result:\", result)\n\nexcept ValueError as e:\n\nprint(e)\n\nelse:\n\nprint(\"Invalid operation. Please choose a valid operation.\")\n\nuser_choice = input(\"Another calculation? (yes/no): \").strip().lower()\n\nif user_choice != 'yes':\n\nbreak\n\nThis seems pretty solid. I might want to add more formatting or features later, but for a basic calculator, this should work.\n\nI should also think about how to handle floating point precision, but for now, I'll keep it simple.\n\nLet me consider if there's any way to improve the user interface. Maybe I can list the operations with numbers for the user to choose, like 1 for add, 2 for subtract, etc. That might make it easier for some users.\n\nAlternatively, I can accept both the operation name and a numeric choice.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll stick with operation names for now.\n\nI should also think about internationalization or different input formats, but since this is a basic calculator, I'll assume the user is entering inputs in the expected format.\n\nLet me think about how to handle continuous operations. Maybe allow the user to chain operations, but that might be beyond the scope of a basic calculator.\n\nFor now, I'll keep it to one operation at a time.\n\nI should also consider adding a help option or instructions for the user if they need assistance.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll just have the welcome message and operation choices.\n\nLet me think about potential errors beyond invalid inputs. What if the user enters a non-numeric value for the \"another calculation\" prompt? Well, since I'm just checking if it's 'yes', I can handle non-matches by assuming they want to exit.\n\nI should make that explicit in the code.\n\nAlso, I should consider adding a message before exiting, like \"Exiting the calculator. Goodbye!\"\n\nAdditionally, I can add more descriptive messages for errors, like \"Error: Invalid operation. Please try again.\"\n\nBut for now, I'll keep it as is.\n\nI think this covers the basic requirements. Let me proceed to write the actual code based on this plan.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a basic command-line calculator in Python that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with proper error handling, follow the steps below.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **User Input:** Get the operation choice and numbers from the user.\n2. **Operation Functions:** Define functions for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide).\n3. **Error Handling:** Handle errors for invalid inputs and operations.\n4. **Loop:** Allow the user to perform multiple calculations until they decide to exit.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\ndef subtract(a, b):\n    return a - b\n\ndef multiply(a, b):\n    return a * b\n\ndef divide(a, b):\n    if b == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    return a / b\n\noperations = {\n    'add': add,\n    'subtract': subtract,\n    'multiply': multiply,\n    'divide': divide\n}\n\nwhile True:\n    print(\"\\nWelcome to the calculator!\")\n    print(\"Operations available: add, subtract, multiply, divide\")\n    \n    operation = input(\"Enter operation: \").strip().lower()\n    num1 = input(\"Enter first number: \").strip()\n    num2 = input(\"Enter second number: \").strip()\n    \n    try:\n        a = float(num1)\n        b = float(num2)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid numbers. Please enter valid numbers.\")\n        continue\n    \n    if operation in operations:\n        func = operations[operation]\n        try:\n            result = func(a, b)\n            print(\"Result:\", result)\n        except ValueError as e:\n            print(e)\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid operation. Please choose a valid operation.\")\n    \n    another = input(\"Another calculation? (yes/no): \").strip().lower()\n    if another != 'yes':\n        print(\"Exiting the calculator. Goodbye!\")\n        break\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Operation Functions:** Simple functions to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Division includes error handling for division by zero.\n2. **Operations Dictionary:** Maps operation names to their corresponding functions for easy lookup.\n3. **Input Handling:** Continuously prompt the user for operation and numbers. Convert inputs to floats and handle conversion errors.\n4. **Error Handling:** Provide user-friendly error messages for invalid operations and invalid number inputs.\n5. **Loop Control:** Allow the user to perform multiple calculations in a loop until they decide to exit by not answering 'yes' to another calculation."
