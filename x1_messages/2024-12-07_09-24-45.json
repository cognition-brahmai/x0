However, I can help answer your question based on general knowledge.\n\nFirstly, it's important to note that roosters are male chickens and do not lay eggs. Only female chickens, known as hens, lay eggs. So, the scenario you've described is biologically inaccurate.\n\nAssuming the scenario was meant to be a hen laying an egg on top of a barn roof, the direction in which the egg would roll would depend on the slope of the roof. Roofs are typically designed with a slope to allow water to run off, so if the roof has a slope, the egg would roll in the direction of that slope.\n\nIf the roof is perfectly flat, the egg wouldn't roll at all unless there's some external force acting upon it, like wind or someone nudging it.\n\nSo, in summary, the egg would roll downhill along the slope of the roof, if there is one.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The egg rolls in the direction of the roof's slope.}} \\]"
