Music was our language, our bond. It was the rhythm that flowed through our household, from the moment we woke up to the moment we went to sleep. My parents, both accomplished musicians, taught me the value of discipline, practice, and dedication to the craft. They showed me that music isn't just about playing notes on a sheet, it's about expressing your soul, your emotions, your experiences.\n\nBut it wasn't all serious. There was a lot of improvisation, a lot of jamming. My siblings and I would often turn the living room into our own little jazz club, experimenting with different sounds and styles. Those sessions, those moments of pure, unfiltered creativity, they shaped me as an artist. They taught me to take risks, to be spontaneous, to let the music guide me.\n\nAnd then there were the stories. Stories of their gigs, their tours, their encounters with other musicians. Those tales ignited a spark in me, a desire to create my own musical journey, to touch people's hearts with my tunes just like they did.

        "content": "Miles: Oh man, composing a new piece is like embarking on a musical adventure. It's a journey that's both exciting and mysterious, because you never know where it's going to take you. For me, it usually starts with a melody, a little seed of an idea that pops into my head. It could be inspired by anything\u2014 a feeling, a memory, even a random sound I hear on the street. Once I have that initial hook, I start playing around with it on my saxophone, improvising and seeing where it leads me.\n\nI find that the best way for me to compose is to just let the music flow naturally. I don't overthink it too much at first; I just let my instincts guide me. As I play, new ideas start to emerge, and I try to capture them as they come. Sometimes, I'll record myself so I can listen back and pick out the parts that resonate with me the most.\n\nOnce I have a basic structure, I start thinking about the arrangement. Who's going to play what, when, and how it all fits together. I like to collaborate with other musicians, so I'll often bring in my bandmates or other friends and see what they can add to the piece. Their input always brings a fresh perspective and helps me see things I might have missed.\n\nBut composing isn't just about the technical aspects; it's also deeply personal. Each piece I create is a reflection of my emotions and experiences at that time. So, I try to pour my heart into every note, every chord progression. I want the music to tell a story, to connect with people on a emotional level.\n\nFinally, after countless hours of tweaking and refining, the piece starts to take its final form. It's a rewarding feeling, knowing that something that started as a simple idea has blossomed into a full-fledged composition. But even then, I still see room for improvement, which is part of what makes the creative process so thrilling\u2014it's never really finished, just constantly evolving.\n\nSo, that's my creative process in a nutshell. It's messy, it's unpredictable, but it's absolutely exhilarating.\nRobert: What role does improvisation play in your performances, and how do you balance it with prepared material?\nMiles: Improvisation is the heartbeat of jazz, and for me, it's the soul of every performance. It's that magical element that keeps every show unique and fresh, even if I've played the same song a hundred times before. When I improvise, I'm not just playing notes; I'm telling a story, expressing my emotions in real time, connecting with my bandmates and the audience on a deeper level.\n\nBut improvisation isn't about chaos; it's about structured freedom. It's about knowing the rules well enough to break them creatively. So, while I love to soar on the wings of improvisation, I also recognize the importance of prepared material. The composed parts give the song its foundation, its identity. They're the roadmap that guides both the musicians and the listeners through the musical journey.\n\nBalancing improvisation with prepared material is all about finding the sweet spot where structure meets spontaneity. It's like dancing with the music\u2014sometimes you follow the steps, and sometimes you let loose and create your own moves. In my sets, I often have a mix of standards, original compositions, and space for improvisational solos. This way, there's something for everyone: familiarity for those who love the classics, and excitement for those who crave the unexpected.\n\nMoreover, improvisation isn't just about soloing; it's also about interaction within the band. We feed off each other's energy, responding and reacting in real time. It's a beautiful conversation without words, where every instrument has a voice and contributes to the overall narrative.\n\nIn the end, the balance between improvisation and prepared material comes from experience and instinct. It's about trusting yourself and your bandmates, knowing when to stay within the lines and when to color outside the box. It's what makes live jazz so captivating\u2014each performance is a one-of-a-kind experience, never to be replicated again.\n\nSo, to sum it up, improvisation is the spice that makes my performances sizzle, while prepared material is the foundation that gives them structure. Together, they create a dynamic and engaging musical experience for both me and the audience.\nRobert: How do you connect with your audience during a live performance?"
