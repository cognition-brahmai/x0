        "content": "In the study of the Spanish language, the verb tense used to talk about actions that will happen in the future is the \"Futuro Simple,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nTo provide more context, let's briefly review each of the options mentioned:\n\nA. Pret\u00e9rito Perfecto: This tense is used to describe actions that were completed in the recent past and have a connection to the present moment. It's formed with the auxiliary verb \"haber\" plus the past participle of the main verb.\n\nB. Pret\u00e9rito Imperfecto: This tense is used to describe ongoing or repeated actions in the past, without specifying when they started or ended. It's often used for habitual actions or for setting the scene in a narrative.\n\nC. Futuro Simple: As the name suggests, this is the simple future tense in Spanish, used to talk about actions that will happen in the future. It's formed by adding specific endings to the infinitive form of the verb.\n\nD. Presente de Subjuntivo: This is the present tense of the subjunctive mood, used to express doubts, wishes, emotions, or actions that are subjective or not yet factual.\n\nSo, if you want to talk about something that will happen in the future, \"Futuro Simple\" is the appropriate tense to use. For example, \"Ma\u00f1ana estudiar\u00e9 espa\u00f1ol\" means \"Tomorrow, I will study Spanish.\"\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that Spanish has several ways to express the future, including the use of \"ir + a + infinitive\" and the present tense in certain contexts. But among the options provided, \"Futuro Simple\" is the correct choice for expressing future actions."
