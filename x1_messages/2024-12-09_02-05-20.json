        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to figure out how many possible combinations there are for a 4-digit lock where each digit can be from 0 to 9, and no digit is repeated. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that a combination lock typically means that the order of the digits matters. So, for a 4-digit lock, the sequence of numbers is important. For example, 1234 is different from 4321.\n\nNow, each digit can be from 0 to 9, which gives us 10 possible choices for each digit if repetition were allowed. But in this case, no digit is repeated. So, for each position in the lock, the number of choices decreases as we move along.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. For the first digit, I can choose any number from 0 to 9, which is 10 possibilities. Once I've chosen the first digit, I can't use it again. So, for the second digit, I have only 9 remaining choices. Similarly, for the third digit, I have 8 choices, and for the fourth digit, 7 choices.\n\nSo, the total number of possible combinations should be the product of these choices: 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7.\n\nLet me calculate that: 10 \u00d7 9 is 90, times 8 is 720, and times 7 is 5040.\n\nWait a minute, that seems too large. Is there a better way to approach this?\n\nI recall that in permutations, where order matters and no repetitions are allowed, the formula is P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!, where n is the total number of items to choose from, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 (digits 0-9) and k = 4 (since it's a 4-digit lock).\n\nSo, P(10, 4) = 10! / (10 - 4)! = 10! / 6!.\n\nLet me compute that. 10! is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, and 6! is 720.\n\nSo, 10! / 6! = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6!) / 6!) = 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 = 5040.\n\nWait, that's the same result I got earlier. So, 5040 seems to be the answer.\n\nBut, just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nLet's consider that for each position in the 4-digit lock, the number of choices decreases by one because no digit repeats.\n\nFirst digit: 10 choices (0-9)\n\nSecond digit: 9 choices (excluding the first digit)\n\nThird digit: 8 choices (excluding the first two digits)\n\nFourth digit: 7 choices (excluding the first three digits)\n\nMultiplying these together: 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 = 5040.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about combinations where order doesn't matter, that would be C(10, 4), but since order matters here, it's permutations, not combinations.\n\nSo, P(10, 4) = 10! / (10 - 4)! = 5040.\n\nI think that's solid. No holes in this reasoning.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider whether zero can be the first digit or not. In lock combinations, can the first digit be zero?\n\nHmm, in most locking mechanisms, including digital ones, zero is allowed as the first digit. So, it should be permitted here as well.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation stands: 5040 possible combinations.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's think about a smaller case. Suppose it's a 2-digit lock with digits from 0 to 9, no repeats.\n\nFirst digit: 10 choices (0-9)\n\nSecond digit: 9 choices (excluding the first digit)\n\nTotal combinations: 10 \u00d7 9 = 90.\n\nIf I use the permutation formula, P(10, 2) = 10! / (10 - 2)! = 10! / 8! = 10 \u00d7 9 = 90.\n\nThis matches, so applying the same logic to the original problem seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible combinations for a 4-digit lock with digits 0-9 and no repeats is 5040.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5040} \\]"
