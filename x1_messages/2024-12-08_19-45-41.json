I need to find out how many green birds there are.\n\nFirst, I'll find out how many birds are blue. Since half of them are blue, that means:\n\nBlue birds = 120 / 2 = 60 birds\n\nNext, one-third of them are red:\n\nRed birds = 120 / 3 = 40 birds\n\nNow, to find the green birds, I'll subtract the blue and red birds from the total number of birds:\n\nGreen birds = Total birds - Blue birds - Red birds\n\nGreen birds = 120 - 60 - 40 = 20 birds\n\nSo, there are 20 green birds on the tree."
