        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 5 red balls, 7 blue balls, and 8 green balls. So, total number of balls is 5 + 7 + 8, which is 20 balls. Got that.\n\nNow, the question is: if you pick one ball at random, what's the probability that it's not green? Okay, so it's not green. That means it could be either red or blue.\n\nOne way to approach this is to find the probability of picking a red ball plus the probability of picking a blue ball. Let's calculate those.\n\nFirst, probability of picking a red ball: number of red balls divided by total number of balls. That's 5/20, which simplifies to 1/4.\n\nNext, probability of picking a blue ball: 7/20. That can't be simplified further, I think.\n\nSo, the total probability of picking either red or blue is 1/4 plus 7/20. To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. 4 and 20 have 20 as a common denominator.\n\n1/4 is the same as 5/20. So, 5/20 plus 7/20 is 12/20, which simplifies to 3/5.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of not picking green as 1 minus the probability of picking green.\n\nProbability of picking green is 8/20, which is 2/5.\n\nSo, 1 minus 2/5 is 3/5.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier. So, the probability is 3/5.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Total balls: 5 red + 7 blue + 8 green = 20.\n\nNot green means red or blue, which is 5 + 7 = 12.\n\nSo, 12 out of 20 is indeed 3/5.\n\nAlternatively, 1 minus probability of green: 1 - 8/20 = 1 - 2/5 = 3/5.\n\nYeah, makes sense.\n\nSo, the answer should be 3/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{5}} \\]"
