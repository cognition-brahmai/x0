        "content": "Certainly! To design this SQL query, we need to consider a few things about the database structure. Typically, employee records are stored in a table called `employees`, which might include fields such as `employee_id`, `name`, `hire_date`, `salary`, and `department_id`. There might be another table called `departments` that includes `department_id` and `department_name`.\n\nGiven this setup, here's how you can construct the query:\n\n1. **Calculate the average salary for each department.**\n2. **Identify employees who have been with the company for more than five years.**\n3. **Select employees whose salary is above the average salary of their department and who have been with the company for more than five years.**\n\nAssuming today's date is used to calculate the hire date condition, you can use the `DATEDIFF` function or similar date functions depending on your SQL dialect to calculate the difference between the current date and the hire date.\n\nHere is a sample SQL query that achieves this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT e.employee_id, e.name, e.hire_date, e.salary, d.department_name\nFROM employees e\nJOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id\nWHERE DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), e.hire_date) > 5*365  -- Assuming 5 years is more than 1825 days\nAND e.salary > (\n    SELECT AVG(e2.salary)\n    FROM employees e2\n    WHERE e2.department_id = e.department_id\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Joining Tables:** We join the `employees` table with the `departments` table on `department_id` to get the department name for each employee.\n\n2. **Date Calculation:** We use `DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), e.hire_date) > 5*365` to check if the employee has been with the company for more than five years. Note that this is a rough calculation assuming a year has 365 days. For more accurate date calculations, you might want to use `PERIOD_DIFF` or other date functions depending on your SQL database.\n\n3. **Subquery for Average Salary:** We use a subquery to calculate the average salary for each department. This subquery averages the salaries of employees in the same department as the current employee (`e.department_id = e2.department_id`).\n\nThis query will return the employee ID, name, hire date, salary, and department name for all employees who meet the specified criteria."
