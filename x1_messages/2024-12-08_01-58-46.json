        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about a food processing plant that makes canned vegetables. They currently produce 20,000 cans per day, and they want to increase that by 50% over the next year. Each canning line can produce 1,000 cans per hour, and the plant operates 16 hours a day. I need to figure out how many additional canning lines are needed to meet this increased demand.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the target production is. They want to increase their output by 50%. So, if they're currently producing 20,000 cans per day, a 50% increase would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Increase} = 20,000 \\times 0.50 = 10,000 \\text{ cans per day} \\]\n\nSo, their target production is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Target production} = 20,000 + 10,000 = 30,000 \\text{ cans per day} \\]\n\nNow, I need to find out how much production capacity they currently have and how much more they need to reach 30,000 cans per day.\n\nEach canning line produces 1,000 cans per hour, and the plant operates 16 hours a day. So, the production per canning line per day is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Production per line per day} = 1,000 \\text{ cans/hour} \\times 16 \\text{ hours/day} = 16,000 \\text{ cans/day} \\]\n\nCurrently, the plant produces 20,000 cans per day. I need to find out how many canning lines they currently have. Let's denote the current number of canning lines as \\( n \\). So:\n\n\\[ n \\times 16,000 = 20,000 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{20,000}{16,000} = 1.25 \\]\n\nSo, they currently have 1.25 canning lines. But since you can't have a fraction of a canning line, this probably means they have 1 full line and are somehow achieving additional capacity, maybe through overtime or partial lines. However, for the sake of this calculation, I'll proceed with 1.25 lines.\n\nNow, they need to produce 30,000 cans per day. Let's find out how many canning lines are required to reach this target.\n\nLet \\( n_{\\text{target}} \\) be the number of canning lines needed.\n\n\\[ n_{\\text{target}} \\times 16,000 = 30,000 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( n_{\\text{target}} \\):\n\n\\[ n_{\\text{target}} = \\frac{30,000}{16,000} = 1.875 \\]\n\nSo, they need 1.875 canning lines to meet the target production.\n\nNow, to find out how many additional canning lines are needed, I subtract the current number of lines from the target number of lines:\n\n\\[ \\text{Additional lines} = n_{\\text{target}} - n = 1.875 - 1.25 = 0.625 \\]\n\nAgain, you can't have a fraction of a canning line, so they would need to add at least one more full canning line to meet the increased demand.\n\nBut let's double-check this to make sure it makes sense.\n\nIf they add one more full canning line, they would have:\n\n\\[ n_{\\text{new}} = 1.25 + 1 = 2.25 \\text{ lines} \\]\n\nTotal production would be:\n\n\\[ 2.25 \\times 16,000 = 36,000 \\text{ cans per day} \\]\n\nWhich is more than the target of 30,000 cans per day.\n\nAlternatively, if they added only 0.625 lines, they would have:\n\n\\[ n_{\\text{new}} = 1.25 + 0.625 = 1.875 \\text{ lines} \\]\n\nProduction:\n\n\\[ 1.875 \\times 16,000 = 30,000 \\text{ cans per day} \\]\n\nWhich exactly meets the target.\n\nHowever, since they can't have a fraction of a canning line, they would need to round up to the next whole line, which is 2 lines in total.\n\nBut wait, they already have 1.25 lines. Adding another line would bring them to 2.25 lines, which is more than needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they can find a way to increase the efficiency or operate more hours to meet the increased demand without adding a full additional line.\n\nBut based on the information provided, and assuming they can't split lines, they would need to add one more full canning line, bringing their total to 2.25 lines, which would produce 36,000 cans per day, exceeding their target of 30,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can operate the existing lines for more hours or find other ways to increase capacity without adding new lines.\n\nBut according to the problem, the plant operates 16 hours per day, and we're to determine how many additional canning lines are needed to achieve the desired production increase.\n\nGiven that, and considering they can't have a fraction of a canning line, they need to add one more full canning line to meet the increased demand.\n\nSo, the answer is they need to add one additional canning line.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
