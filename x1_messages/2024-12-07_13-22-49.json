        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a class of 40 students, and 60% of them are girls. First, I need to find out how many girls and how many boys are in the class right now.\n\nOkay, 60% of 40 students are girls. To find out how many that is, I can calculate 60% of 40:\n\nNumber of girls = 60% of 40 = 0.60 \u00d7 40 = 24 girls.\n\nNow, since there are 40 students in total and 24 of them are girls, the rest must be boys.\n\nNumber of boys = Total students - Number of girls = 40 - 24 = 16 boys.\n\nAlright, so right now, there are 16 boys in the class.\n\nThe problem says that 10 more boys join the class. So, I need to add 10 to the current number of boys.\n\nNew number of boys = 16 + 10 = 26 boys.\n\nNow, the total number of students in the class will also increase by 10, since only boys are joining.\n\nNew total students = 40 + 10 = 50 students.\n\nOkay, now I need to find out what percentage of this new total are boys.\n\nTo find the percentage of boys, I can use the formula:\n\nPercentage of boys = (Number of boys / Total students) \u00d7 100.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nPercentage of boys = (26 / 50) \u00d7 100.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n26 divided by 50 is 0.52.\n\nThen, 0.52 multiplied by 100% is 52%.\n\nSo, after 10 more boys join the class, 52% of the class will be boys.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 40 students, 60% are girls, which is 24 girls.\n\nThen, boys are 40 - 24 = 16 boys.\n\nAdding 10 boys: 16 + 10 = 26 boys.\n\nNew total students: 40 + 10 = 50 students.\n\nPercentage of boys: (26 / 50) \u00d7 100% = 52%.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it differently to confirm.\n\nInitially, there are 16 boys out of 40 students.\n\n16 / 40 = 0.4, which is 40% boys.\n\nBut that's before the new boys join.\n\nAfter 10 boys join, there are 26 boys out of 50 students.\n\n26 / 50 = 0.52, which is 52%.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 52%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{52\\%} \\]"
