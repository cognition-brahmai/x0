        "content": "So there's this problem about two trains leaving from different stations and heading towards each other. Train A is leaving from Station A to Station B at 100 km/h, and Train B is leaving from Station B to Station A at 200 km/h. The distance between the two stations is 300 km. The question is, how far apart will the trains be when they meet?\n\nHmm, let's see. Since both trains are moving towards each other, their speeds will add up relative to each other. So, the relative speed is 100 km/h plus 200 km/h, which is 300 km/h.\n\nNow, the distance between the two stations is 300 km. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Relative Speed\n\nSo, Time = 300 km / 300 km/h = 1 hour.\n\nAlright, so they will meet after 1 hour. Now, to find out how far apart they are when they meet, well, actually, when they meet, they should be at the same point, right? So, the distance apart should be zero.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"how far apart will the trains be when they meet?\" If they meet, isn't the distance between them zero?\n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding something here. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"A train leaves from Station A to Station B at 100 km/h. At the same time, another train leaves from Station B to Station A at 200 km/h. The distance between the two stations is 300 km. How far apart will the trains be when they meet?\"\n\nYes, it seems straightforward. They are moving towards each other, so they will meet at some point between the two stations. And when they meet, the distance between them should be zero.\n\nBut perhaps the question is asking something else. Maybe it's a trick question or I'm missing a detail.\n\nLet me consider the distances each train travels in that 1 hour.\n\nTrain A is going at 100 km/h, so in 1 hour, it covers 100 km.\n\nTrain B is going at 200 km/h, so in 1 hour, it covers 200 km.\n\nSo, Train A has traveled 100 km from Station A, and Train B has traveled 200 km from Station B.\n\nSince the total distance between Station A and Station B is 300 km, if Train A has traveled 100 km and Train B has traveled 200 km, they should have covered the entire 300 km between them.\n\nTherefore, they meet after 1 hour, and at that point, they are at the same location, so the distance apart is zero.\n\nBut maybe the question is asking for the distance each train has traveled when they meet, or something like that.\n\nWait, no, it specifically says \"how far apart will the trains be when they meet?\"\n\nSo, again, that should be zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me check the relative speed again.\n\nTrain A is going at 100 km/h towards Station B, and Train B is going at 200 km/h towards Station A.\n\nSo, their speeds are adding up because they are moving towards each other. So, relative speed is indeed 100 + 200 = 300 km/h.\n\nDistance is 300 km, so time to meet is 300 km / 300 km/h = 1 hour.\n\nDistance apart when they meet should be zero.\n\nUnless... unless perhaps the trains pass each other and continue moving. But even then, at the instant they meet, the distance between them is zero.\n\nMaybe the question is worded poorly, or maybe I'm overthinking this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the distance each train has traveled, not the distance between them when they meet.\n\nBut it specifically says \"how far apart will the trains be when they meet?\"\n\nSo, I think the answer is zero.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the distance traveled by Train A as \\(d_A\\) and the distance traveled by Train B as \\(d_B\\). The sum of these distances should be equal to the total distance between the stations when they meet.\n\nSo, \\(d_A + d_B = 300\\) km.\n\nWe also know that \\(d_A = 100 \\times t\\) and \\(d_B = 200 \\times t\\), where \\(t\\) is the time in hours.\n\nSubstituting, we get:\n\n\\(100t + 200t = 300\\)\n\n\\(300t = 300\\)\n\n\\(t = 1\\) hour.\n\nSo, \\(d_A = 100 \\times 1 = 100\\) km, and \\(d_B = 200 \\times 1 = 200\\) km.\n\nAt this point, they have covered the entire 300 km between them, so they meet, and the distance between them is zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be zero.\n\nBut to confirm, maybe I should think about it in terms of position.\n\nLet\u2019s assume Station A is at position 0, and Station B is at position 300 km.\n\nTrain A starts at 0 and moves towards 300 km at 100 km/h.\n\nTrain B starts at 300 km and moves towards 0 at 200 km/h.\n\nAfter time \\(t\\), position of Train A is \\(100t\\) km.\n\nPosition of Train B is \\(300 - 200t\\) km.\n\nThey meet when \\(100t = 300 - 200t\\).\n\nSolving for \\(t\\):\n\n\\(100t + 200t = 300\\)\n\n\\(300t = 300\\)\n\n\\(t = 1\\) hour.\n\nAt \\(t = 1\\) hour, position of Train A is \\(100 \\times 1 = 100\\) km.\n\nPosition of Train B is \\(300 - 200 \\times 1 = 100\\) km.\n\nSo, both trains are at the 100 km mark when they meet.\n\nTherefore, the distance between them at that point is zero.\n\nI think this is solid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the distance from one station to the meeting point.\n\nBut the question specifically says \"how far apart will the trains be when they meet?\"\n\nSo, again, that should be zero.\n\nPerhaps to make it more confusing, maybe there's a misunderstanding about the concept of \"meeting.\"\n\nBut in practical terms, when two trains meet, they are at the same point, so the distance between them is zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the distance each has traveled, but again, that's not what it's asking.\n\nI think the answer is zero.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
