        "content": "To calculate the definite integral of f(x) = x\u00b2 - 3x + 2 from x = 0 to x = 4, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the antiderivative of f(x):**\n   The antiderivative F(x) of f(x) is found by integrating each term of f(x) separately.\n\n   - The antiderivative of x\u00b2 is (x\u00b3)/3.\n   - The antiderivative of -3x is (-3/2)x\u00b2.\n   - The antiderivative of 2 is 2x.\n\n   So, F(x) = (x\u00b3)/3 - (3/2)x\u00b2 + 2x + C, where C is the constant of integration. Since we're dealing with a definite integral, the constant will cancel out.\n\n2. **Evaluate F(x) at the upper limit (x = 4):**\n   Plug x = 4 into F(x):\n\n   F(4) = (4\u00b3)/3 - (3/2)(4\u00b2) + 2*(4)\n        = (64)/3 - (3/2)*(16) + 8\n        = 64/3 - 24 + 8\n        = 64/3 - 16\n\n   To subtract 16 from 64/3, convert 16 to a fraction with denominator 3:\n\n   16 = 48/3\n\n   So, F(4) = 64/3 - 48/3 = 16/3\n\n3. **Evaluate F(x) at the lower limit (x = 0):**\n   Plug x = 0 into F(x):\n\n   F(0) = (0\u00b3)/3 - (3/2)*(0\u00b2) + 2*(0) = 0\n\n4. **Subtract F(0) from F(4):**\n   The definite integral from 0 to 4 is F(4) - F(0) = 16/3 - 0 = 16/3\n\nTherefore, the integral of f(x) = x\u00b2 - 3x + 2 from x = 0 to x = 4 is 16/3.\n\n**Additional check using geometry:**\n\nWe can also verify this by considering the areas under the curve geometrically, but since f(x) is a quadratic function, it's more straightforward to use the antiderivative method. However, for educational purposes, let's see:\n\nThe function f(x) = x\u00b2 - 3x + 2 can be factored as f(x) = (x-1)(x-2), which means it crosses the x-axis at x=1 and x=2.\n\nFrom x=0 to x=1, f(x) is positive.\nFrom x=1 to x=2, f(x) is negative.\nFrom x=2 to x=4, f(x) is positive.\n\nSo, the integral from 0 to 4 is the sum of the areas from 0 to 1, minus the area from 1 to 2 (since it's below the x-axis), plus the area from 2 to 4.\n\nBut calculating these areas geometrically would be more complicated than using the antiderivative, so we'll stick with the antiderivative method.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{16}{3}} \\]"
