        "content": "So, there are 100 houses in the village, and each house has at least one cat but no more than five cats. I need to find out the minimum number of cats in the village. Hmm.\n\nWell, if every house has at least one cat, that means each house has a minimum of one cat. So, if there are 100 houses, and each has at least one cat, then the total number of cats would be at least 100. But wait, the question says \"no more than five cats,\" but it doesn't say anything about the maximum number of cats per house affecting the minimum total number of cats.\n\nSo, to minimize the total number of cats, I should assume that each house has only one cat, since that's the least number allowed. So, 100 houses times one cat each would be 100 cats in total. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's a trick here. The problem says \"every house has at least one cat and no more than five cats.\" It doesn't specify any other constraints, like the total number of cats or anything like that.\n\nSo, indeed, to find the minimum number of cats, I just need to have each house have the minimum number of cats, which is one. Therefore, 100 houses times one cat equals 100 cats.\n\nI don't think there's more to it. It's a straightforward minimization problem with given constraints.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
