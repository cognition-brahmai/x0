        "content": "So I've got this problem here: the ratio of taxi drivers to Uber drivers is 4:3, and there are 1,400 taxi drivers in the city. I need to find out how many Uber drivers there are. Hmm, ratios can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a ratio compares two quantities. Here, it's comparing taxi drivers to Uber drivers, and the ratio is 4:3. That means for every 4 taxi drivers, there are 3 Uber drivers. So, the number of taxi drivers is like 4 parts, and the number of Uber drivers is like 3 parts.\n\nNow, I'm given that there are 1,400 taxi drivers. So, these 1,400 drivers correspond to the 4 parts in the ratio. I need to find out what one part is equal to, and then I can find out what 3 parts (the Uber drivers) would be.\n\nTo find the value of one part, I can divide the number of taxi drivers by 4. So, 1,400 divided by 4.\n\n1,400 \u00f7 4 = 350.\n\nSo, one part is 350.\n\nNow, since Uber drivers are 3 parts, I can multiply 350 by 3 to get the number of Uber drivers.\n\n350 \u00d7 3 = 1,050.\n\nTherefore, there are 1,050 Uber drivers in the city.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way to handle ratios is to set up a proportion. So, if the ratio of taxi to Uber drivers is 4:3, I can write it as:\n\nTaxi drivers / Uber drivers = 4 / 3.\n\nI know the number of taxi drivers is 1,400, so:\n\n1,400 / Uber drivers = 4 / 3.\n\nLet me denote the number of Uber drivers as U. Then:\n\n1,400 / U = 4 / 3.\n\nTo solve for U, I can cross-multiply:\n\n1,400 \u00d7 3 = 4 \u00d7 U.\n\nSo, 4,200 = 4U.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4:\n\nU = 4,200 / 4 = 1,050.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous result. So, there are indeed 1,050 Uber drivers in the city.\n\nLet me consider if there's yet another way to look at this. Maybe using fractions.\n\nThe ratio is 4:3, which means taxi drivers are 4 parts and Uber drivers are 3 parts, making a total of 7 parts.\n\nIf there are 1,400 taxi drivers, which is 4 parts, then the total number of drivers (taxi plus Uber) would be 7 parts.\n\nFirst, find the value of one part: 1,400 \u00f7 4 = 350.\n\nThen, total drivers: 7 \u00d7 350 = 2,450.\n\nNow, Uber drivers are 3 parts: 3 \u00d7 350 = 1,050.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it, Uber drivers are 3/7 of the total drivers.\n\nBut I already know there are 1,400 taxi drivers, which are 4/7 of the total.\n\nSo, 4/7 of total drivers = 1,400.\n\nTo find the total, I can set up the equation:\n\n(4/7) \u00d7 total = 1,400.\n\nThen, total = 1,400 \u00d7 (7/4) = 1,400 \u00d7 1.75 = 2,450.\n\nNow, Uber drivers are 3/7 of the total:\n\n(3/7) \u00d7 2,450 = 1,050.\n\nAgain, the same answer. So, I'm confident that 1,050 is the correct number of Uber drivers in the city.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about it in terms of multiples.\n\nThe ratio is 4:3, so the number of taxi drivers should be a multiple of 4, and Uber drivers should be the corresponding multiple of 3.\n\nGiven that there are 1,400 taxi drivers, which is 4 times 350, then Uber drivers should be 3 times 350, which is 1,050.\n\nEverything points to 1,050 Uber drivers.\n\nI don't think I need to consider any other methods; this seems straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1050} \\]"
