        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the company produces 150 units each day, and each unit costs $25 to make. They sell each unit for $40. We need to find out the profit after 30 days.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what profit is. Profit is basically the amount of money left after subtracting the costs from the revenue. So, profit equals revenue minus cost.\n\nNow, let's find out the daily revenue and daily cost, and then we can calculate the daily profit. After that, we can multiply the daily profit by 30 to get the profit over 30 days.\n\nLet's start with the daily revenue. The company sells each unit for $40, and they produce and sell 150 units each day. So, daily revenue would be:\n\nDaily Revenue = Selling Price per Unit \u00d7 Number of Units Sold per Day\n\nDaily Revenue = $40 \u00d7 150\n\nDaily Revenue = $6,000\n\nNext, the daily cost. The company costs $25 per unit to produce, and they produce 150 units each day.\n\nDaily Cost = Cost per Unit \u00d7 Number of Units Produced per Day\n\nDaily Cost = $25 \u00d7 150\n\nDaily Cost = $3,750\n\nNow, the daily profit would be:\n\nDaily Profit = Daily Revenue - Daily Cost\n\nDaily Profit = $6,000 - $3,750\n\nDaily Profit = $2,250\n\nFinally, to find the profit after 30 days, we multiply the daily profit by 30:\n\nTotal Profit = Daily Profit \u00d7 Number of Days\n\nTotal Profit = $2,250 \u00d7 30\n\nTotal Profit = $67,500\n\nSo, the company makes a profit of $67,500 after 30 days.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that I haven't missed anything. Is there any other cost involved, like fixed costs or something? The problem only mentions the cost per unit, so I think it's just the variable cost. No fixed costs mentioned, so I don't need to account for those.\n\nAlso, it says they produce 150 units each day and sell each unit for $40. I assume they sell all the units they produce, so no unsold inventory.\n\nAlright, I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{67500} \\]"
