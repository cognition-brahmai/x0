        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here, and I need to find the probability that a man stops after taking out exactly three balls from a bag containing 10 red balls and 20 blue balls, with the condition that he stops when he gets two balls of the same color. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There are 10 red balls and 20 blue balls, making a total of 30 balls. He takes them out one at a time without looking, and he stops when he has two of the same color. I need to find the probability that he stops after exactly three draws.\n\nHmm, so he stops after exactly three draws means that the first two balls he draws are of different colors, and the third ball matches one of the first two. Wait, no. Actually, the condition is that he stops when he gets two balls of the same color. So, if the first two balls are of the same color, he would stop after the second draw. Therefore, if he stops after exactly three draws, that means the first two balls are of different colors, and the third ball matches one of the first two, making two of the same color.\n\nWait, but the problem says he stops when he gets two balls of the same color. So, if the first two balls are the same, he stops after the second draw. If the first two are different, he draws a third ball. So, to stop after exactly three draws, the third ball must match one of the first two, but since the first two are different, the third ball will make it two of the same color.\n\nBut actually, if the first two are different, and the third matches one of them, then he has two of the same color, and stops after the third draw. That makes sense.\n\nSo, to rephrase: the sequence must be two different colors first, and then the third ball matches one of the first two.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the probability of this happening.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to draw three balls from 30. That would be combinations, but since the order might matter, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, actually, since he's drawing one at a time without replacement, perhaps it's best to consider the draws as ordered.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a specific sequence of colors.\n\nLet me consider the possible sequences where the first two balls are different, and the third matches one of the first two.\n\nSo, possible sequences:\n\n1. Red, Blue, Red\n\n2. Red, Blue, Blue\n\n3. Blue, Red, Blue\n\n4. Blue, Red, Red\n\nWait, but in sequences 2 and 4, the third ball matches the second one, which would mean that he actually has two of the same color before the third draw.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if he draws Red, Blue, Blue, then the first two are different, and the third is blue, matching the second, so he has two blues. Similarly, Blue, Red, Red would have two reds.\n\nSo, those sequences are valid.\n\nBut, if he draws Red, Blue, Red, he has two reds, and if he draws Blue, Red, Blue, he has two blues.\n\nSo, all four sequences are valid for stopping after the third draw.\n\nWait, but is there any sequence where drawing three balls doesn't result in having two of the same color? Well, if the first two are different, and the third is different from both, then he would have three different colors, but since there are only two colors, that's impossible. So, yes, any third draw will result in having two of the same color if the first two are different.\n\nTherefore, the probability that he stops after exactly three draws is equal to the probability that the first two draws are of different colors.\n\nWait, is that right? Wait, no. Wait, if the first two are different, then the third draw will always make it two of the same color, as there are only two colors.\n\nSo, yes, the probability is equal to the probability that the first two draws are different.\n\nSo, perhaps I can calculate that.\n\nFirst, probability that the first ball is red: 10/30.\n\nThen, probability that the second ball is blue, given the first was red: 20/29.\n\nSimilarly, probability that the first ball is blue: 20/30.\n\nThen, probability that the second ball is red, given the first was blue: 10/29.\n\nSo, total probability that the first two are different is (10/30 * 20/29) + (20/30 * 10/29).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 10/30 * 20/29 = (10*20)/(30*29) = 200/870.\n\nSimilarly, 20/30 * 10/29 = (20*10)/(30*29) = 200/870.\n\nSo, total probability is 200/870 + 200/870 = 400/870.\n\nSimplify that: divide numerator and denominator by 10, get 40/87.\n\nSo, the probability is 40/87.\n\nWait, but I feel like I might be missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother way: total number of ways to draw three balls from 30 is C(30,3).\n\nNumber of favorable outcomes: first two different, third matches one of the first two.\n\nWait, but since order matters in this case, perhaps it's better to consider ordered draws.\n\nSo, total number of ordered ways to draw three balls: 30*29*28.\n\nNumber of favorable sequences:\n\nFirst, sequences where first is red, second is blue, third is red:\n\nNumber of such sequences: 10 (first red) * 20 (second blue) * 9 (third red).\n\nSimilarly, first is red, second is blue, third is blue: 10*20*19.\n\nWait, but in this case, third matches one of the first two, so in this sequence, third is blue, matching the second.\n\nSimilarly, first is blue, second is red, third is blue: 20*10*19.\n\nFirst is blue, second is red, third is red: 20*10*9.\n\nSo, total favorable sequences: 10*20*9 + 10*20*19 + 20*10*19 + 20*10*9.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst term: 10*20*9 = 1800.\n\nSecond term: 10*20*19 = 3800.\n\nThird term: 20*10*19 = 3800.\n\nFourth term: 20*10*9 = 1800.\n\nTotal favorable: 1800 + 3800 + 3800 + 1800 = 11200.\n\nTotal possible: 30*29*28 = 24,360.\n\nSo, probability is 11,200 / 24,360.\n\nSimplify that fraction.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 40: 280 / 609.\n\nWait, does that reduce further? Let's see.\n\n280 and 609 divided by 7: 40 and 87.\n\nSo, 40/87.\n\nSo, same answer as before.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 40/87.\n\nWait, but I feel like maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nIs there a simpler way to think about it?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using conditional probability.\n\nProbability that the first two are different, and the third matches one of the first two.\n\nBut since in this problem, the third necessarily matches one of the first two because there are only two colors, then it's just the probability that the first two are different.\n\nWhich is what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, yes, 40/87 is the correct answer.\n\nI think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{40}{87}} \\]"
