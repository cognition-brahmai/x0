So, that means 50 people have blue eyes and 50 have green eyes.\n\nIf one person with blue eyes leaves the room, then the number of people with blue eyes decreases by one. So, now there are 49 people with blue eyes and still 50 people with green eyes.\n\nThe ratio of people with blue eyes to those with green eyes would be 49 to 50.\n\nSo, the ratio is 49:50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{49:50} \\]"
