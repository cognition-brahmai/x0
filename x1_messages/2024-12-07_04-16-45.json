        "content": "So there are 5 red balls and 3 green balls in a bag, making a total of 8 balls. I need to pick two balls without looking and find out the probability that both are red.\n\nFirst, I should remember that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 8 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nHere, n = 8 and k = 2.\n\nSo, total ways = C(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8 - 2)!) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 6!) = (8 \u00d7 7) / 2 = 56 / 2 = 28.\n\nNow, the number of ways to pick 2 red balls out of 5.\n\nSo, favorable ways = C(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5 - 2)!) = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 3!)) = (5 \u00d7 4) / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10.\n\nTherefore, probability = favorable ways / total ways = 10 / 28 = 5 / 14.\n\nWait, but I should consider whether the balls are picked with replacement or without replacement. The question says \"without looking,\" but it doesn't specify if it's with or without replacement. I think \"picking two balls without looking\" implies picking two balls at once, without replacement.\n\nBut let's confirm:\n\nIf it's without replacement, then my calculation is correct.\n\nIf it's with replacement, then the total number of possible outcomes would be different.\n\nIn with replacement, after picking the first ball, it's put back, so the total remains the same for the second pick.\n\nBut in this case, since it's \"without looking\" and \"pick two balls,\" it's more likely without replacement.\n\nSo, I think 5/14 is the correct probability.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it step by step.\n\nFirst, the probability of picking a red ball on the first pick is 5/8.\n\nThen, given that the first ball was red, the probability of picking another red ball is 4/7.\n\nSo, the combined probability is (5/8) \u00d7 (4/7) = 20/56 = 5/14.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo, either way, the answer is 5/14.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{14}} \\]"
