The expression is ((3^2 * 4) / 2 - 5)^2.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the exponentiation, multiplication, division, and subtraction in the correct order, following the order of operations, often remembered by PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nSo, starting inside the parentheses:\n\n1. Calculate the exponentiation: 3^2.\n\n3^2 = 9.\n\nNow the expression is ((9 * 4) / 2 - 5)^2.\n\n2. Next, multiplication: 9 * 4.\n\n9 * 4 = 36.\n\nNow it's (36 / 2 - 5)^2.\n\n3. Then, division: 36 / 2.\n\n36 / 2 = 18.\n\nNow it's (18 - 5)^2.\n\n4. Subtraction: 18 - 5.\n\n18 - 5 = 13.\n\nNow it's 13^2.\n\n5. Finally, exponentiation: 13^2.\n\n13^2 = 169.\n\nSo, the final answer is 169."
