        "content": "To calculate the pH of a solution, we use the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nwhere [H+] is the hydrogen ion concentration in mol/L.\n\nGiven that [H+] = 1 x 10^-7 mol/L, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\npH = -log10(1 x 10^-7)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the logarithm (base 10) of 1 x 10^-7.\n\nlog10(1 x 10^-7) = log10(1) + log10(10^-7)\n\nWe know that log10(1) = 0, because 10^0 = 1.\n\nAlso, log10(10^-7) = -7, because 10^-7 = 1/10^7.\n\nSo, log10(1 x 10^-7) = 0 + (-7) = -7\n\nNow, we have:\n\npH = -(-7) = 7\n\nTherefore, the pH of the solution is 7.\n\nThis makes sense because a pH of 7 is considered neutral, which is consistent with the hydrogen ion concentration of 1 x 10^-7 mol/L, typical of pure water at 25\u00b0C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
