        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a simple bank account system in Python using object-oriented programming and including exception handling for invalid inputs. Sounds straightforward enough. I need to make sure that users can deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance. Also, I have to handle cases where someone tries to do something invalid, like withdrawing more money than they have.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by defining a class for the bank account. Let's call it `BankAccount`. Inside this class, I'll need methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance. I also need to keep track of the account balance, so I'll have an instance variable for that.\n\nI should think about how to initialize the account. Maybe when a `BankAccount` object is created, it should have an initial balance. Let's make that a parameter in the constructor. But what if someone doesn't provide an initial balance? I'll set a default value, maybe zero.\n\nSo, the constructor could look like this:\n\n```python\ndef __init__(self, initial_balance=0):\n    self.balance = initial_balance\n```\n\nNext, the deposit method. This should take an amount to deposit and add it to the balance. But I need to make sure that the amount is a positive number. If someone tries to deposit a negative amount, that doesn't make sense, right? So, I should handle that case.\n\nI can raise an exception if the deposit amount is negative. Let's use the `ValueError` exception for this.\n\nThe deposit method could look like this:\n\n```python\ndef deposit(self, amount):\n    if amount < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Deposit amount cannot be negative.\")\n    self.balance += amount\n```\n\nNow, the withdraw method. This should take an amount to withdraw and subtract it from the balance. But there are a couple of things to consider here. First, the amount to withdraw should be positive. Second, the account should have sufficient funds to cover the withdrawal. If either of these conditions isn't met, I should handle it appropriately.\n\nAgain, I can raise a `ValueError` if the withdrawal amount is negative. And if the amount is positive but exceeds the balance, I probably should raise another exception, maybe saying that there are insufficient funds.\n\nSo, the withdraw method could look like this:\n\n```python\ndef withdraw(self, amount):\n    if amount < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Withdrawal amount cannot be negative.\")\n    if amount > self.balance:\n        raise ValueError(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n    self.balance -= amount\n```\n\nThen, the method to check the balance. This should just return the current balance.\n\n```python\ndef get_balance(self):\n    return self.balance\n```\n\nAlright, so that's the basic structure of the `BankAccount` class. Now, I need to think about how to use this class in a program that interacts with the user. I'll need to get input from the user on what they want to do: deposit, withdraw, or check balance. Then, based on their choice, I'll call the appropriate method on the `BankAccount` object.\n\nI should also handle cases where the user enters invalid inputs, like non-numeric amounts or invalid choices. For that, I can use try-except blocks to catch exceptions and inform the user appropriately.\n\nLet's sketch out the main part of the program.\n\nFirst, create an instance of `BankAccount`. Maybe ask the user for an initial balance when starting the program.\n\nThen, present a menu to the user with options to deposit, withdraw, check balance, or exit.\n\nBased on the user's choice, perform the corresponding action.\n\nI need to make sure that the program keeps running until the user chooses to exit.\n\nAlso, for deposit and withdraw actions, I need to get the amount from the user and ensure it's a valid number.\n\nLet me think about the menu. Something like:\n\n\"Welcome to the Bank Account Simulator!\n\nPlease choose an option:\n\n1. Deposit\n\n2. Withdraw\n\n3. Check Balance\n\n4. Exit\n\nEnter your choice: \"\n\nThen, based on the choice, proceed accordingly.\n\nI should use a loop to keep displaying the menu until the user chooses to exit.\n\nNow, for getting the amount, I need to make sure that the user enters a valid number. If they enter something that's not a number, I should handle that and ask them to enter a valid amount.\n\nI can use a try-except block to catch `ValueError` exceptions when converting the input to a float.\n\nFor example, when asking for the amount to deposit:\n\n```\namount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to deposit: \"))\n```\n\nIf the input can't be converted to a float, a `ValueError` will be raised, and I can catch it and inform the user.\n\nSimilarly, for withdrawal, I need to make sure that the amount is positive and doesn't exceed the balance, but those checks are already in the `withdraw` method.\n\nAlso, in the `deposit` method, I'm already checking for negative amounts.\n\nSo, in the main program, after getting a valid float amount, I can call the appropriate method on the `BankAccount` object.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the main program.\n\nI'll use a loop that continues until the user chooses to exit.\n\nInside the loop, I'll display the menu and ask for the choice.\n\nBased on the choice, I'll perform the corresponding action.\n\nIf the choice is 1, ask for the deposit amount and call the deposit method.\n\nIf the choice is 2, ask for the withdrawal amount and call the withdraw method.\n\nIf the choice is 3, call the get_balance method and display the balance.\n\nIf the choice is 4, exit the loop and end the program.\n\nIf the choice is none of the above, inform the user to enter a valid choice.\n\nAlso, I need to handle cases where the user enters something other than an integer for the choice.\n\nSo, for the choice input, I can also use a try-except block to catch `ValueError` if they enter non-numeric input.\n\nLet me try to write some pseudocode for the main program.\n\n```\n\ncreate a BankAccount object with initial balance\n\nwhile True:\n\n    display menu\n\n    try:\n\n        choice = int(input(\"Enter your choice: \"))\n\n        if choice == 1:\n\n            try:\n\n                amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to deposit: \"))\n\n                account.deposit(amount)\n\n                print(\"Deposit successful.\")\n\n            except ValueError as e:\n\n                print(\"Error:\", e)\n\n        elif choice == 2:\n\n            try:\n\n                amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to withdraw: \"))\n\n                account.withdraw(amount)\n\n                print(\"Withdrawal successful.\")\n\n            except ValueError as e:\n\n                print(\"Error:\", e)\n\n        elif choice == 3:\n\n            balance = account.get_balance()\n\n            print(\"Current balance:\", balance)\n\n        elif choice == 4:\n\n            print(\"Exiting. Goodbye!\")\n\n            break\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please select a valid option.\")\n\n    except ValueError:\n\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number for your choice.\")\n\n```\n\nThat looks pretty good. Now, I need to implement this in actual Python code.\n\nI should also think about formatting the currency amounts properly, maybe with two decimal places.\n\nI can use the `format` function or f-strings to format the balance display.\n\nFor example:\n\n`print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")`\n\nBut to make it more general, I can define a formatting function or use string formatting wherever necessary.\n\nAlso, I should consider handling multiple accounts, but for simplicity, let's assume there's only one account being simulated here.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the balance should never go negative, which is already handled in the withdraw method by checking if the amount exceeds the balance.\n\nI should also think about allowing decimal amounts, since money can have cents. So, using float for amounts is appropriate.\n\nBut, I should be aware of potential floating point precision issues. To mitigate that, in real-world applications, it's better to use the `decimal` module for monetary calculations. But for this simple simulation, float should suffice.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered the main points. Now, I'll proceed to write the actual Python code based on this plan.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple bank account system in Python using object-oriented programming principles with appropriate exception handling, follow the steps below.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Class Definition**: Define a `BankAccount` class to handle account operations.\n2. **Constructor**: Initialize the account with an optional initial balance.\n3. **Deposit Method**: Allow deposits with positive amounts.\n4. **Withdraw Method**: Allow withdrawals if the amount is positive and sufficient funds are available.\n5. **Balance Check**: Provide a method to check the current balance.\n6. **Main Program**: Implement a user interface to interact with the `BankAccount` object, handling user inputs and choices.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        if amount < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Deposit amount cannot be negative.\")\n        self.balance += amount\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Withdrawal amount cannot be negative.\")\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            raise ValueError(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n        self.balance -= amount\n\n    def get_balance(self):\n        return self.balance\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Bank Account Simulator!\")\n    initial_balance = float(input(\"Enter initial balance: \"))\n    account = BankAccount(initial_balance)\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nPlease choose an option:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n        try:\n            choice = int(input(\"Enter your choice: \"))\n            if choice == 1:\n                try:\n                    amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to deposit: \"))\n                    account.deposit(amount)\n                    print(\"Deposit successful.\")\n                except ValueError as e:\n                    print(\"Error:\", e)\n            elif choice == 2:\n                try:\n                    amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to withdraw: \"))\n                    account.withdraw(amount)\n                    print(\"Withdrawal successful.\")\n                except ValueError as e:\n                    print(\"Error:\", e)\n            elif choice == 3:\n                balance = account.get_balance()\n                print(f\"Current balance: ${balance:.2f}\")\n            elif choice == 4:\n                print(\"Exiting. Goodbye!\")\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid choice. Please select a valid option.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number for your choice.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **BankAccount Class**:\n    - **Constructor**: Initializes the account balance.\n    - **deposit**: Adds a positive amount to the balance.\n    - **withdraw**: Subtracts a positive amount from the balance if sufficient funds are available.\n    - **get_balance**: Returns the current balance.\n\n2. **Main Program**:\n    - Initializes a `BankAccount` object with user-provided initial balance.\n    - Presents a menu for deposit, withdraw, check balance, or exit.\n    - Handles user inputs and calls appropriate methods of the `BankAccount` class.\n    - Includes exception handling for invalid inputs and operations.\n\nThis program provides a simple text-based interface to manage a bank account, ensuring all operations are valid and user inputs are properly managed."
