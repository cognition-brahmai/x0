        "content": "So I've got this problem here about marbles in a bag. There are 5 red, 3 blue, and 7 green marbles. I need to find the probability that if I pick two marbles without replacing the first one, both of them will be green. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of marbles in the bag. Let's add them up: 5 red plus 3 blue plus 7 green gives me 15 marbles in total.\n\nNow, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. But since I'm picking two marbles without replacement, the probability changes after the first pick because the total number of marbles decreases by one.\n\nSo, for the first pick, the probability of drawing a green marble is the number of green marbles divided by the total number of marbles, which is 7 out of 15. That's 7/15.\n\nNext, if I've already picked one green marble, there are now 6 green marbles left and a total of 14 marbles remaining in the bag. So, the probability of picking another green marble is 6/14.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening together\u2014that is, both picks being green\u2014I need to multiply the probabilities of each event happening in sequence.\n\nSo, the overall probability is (7/15) multiplied by (6/14).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 7/15 * 6/14.\n\nI can simplify this before multiplying. Notice that 7 and 14 have a common factor of 7, and 15 and 6 have a common factor of 3.\n\nSo, 7/15 simplifies to 7 \u00f7 3 = 7/15, but actually, 15 \u00f7 3 = 5, so it's 7/15.\n\nAnd 6/14 simplifies to 6 \u00f7 2 = 3 and 14 \u00f7 2 = 7, so it's 3/7.\n\nWait, actually, I can simplify across the fractions. So, 7/15 * 6/14 can be simplified by dividing 7 and 14 by 7, and 6 and 15 by 3.\n\nSo, 7 \u00f7 7 = 1, 14 \u00f7 7 = 2, 6 \u00f7 3 = 2, and 15 \u00f7 3 = 5.\n\nSo now, it's 1/5 * 2/2 = 1/5 * 1 = 1/5.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, 7/15 * 6/14 = (7*6)/(15*14) = 42 / 210.\n\nNow, 42 divided by 210 is 0.2, which is the same as 1/5.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/5.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 green marbles out of 7 is C(7,2), and the total number of ways to choose any 2 marbles out of 15 is C(15,2).\n\nSo, probability = C(7,2) / C(15,2).\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nC(7,2) = 7! / (2! * (7-2)!) = (7*6)/2 = 21.\n\nC(15,2) = 15! / (2! * 13!) = (15*14)/2 = 105.\n\nSo, probability = 21/105 = 1/5.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both marbles picked are green is 1/5, or 0.2, which is 20%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{5}} \\]"
