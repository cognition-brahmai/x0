        "content": "So there's a class of 40 students, and 65% of them passed the exam. I need to find out how many students failed the exam. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many students passed the exam. Since 65% passed, I can calculate that by taking 65% of 40. To find a percentage of a number, I multiply the percentage by the number and then divide by 100. So, it's (65/100) * 40.\n\nLet me do the math: 65 times 40 is 2600, and then divided by 100 is 26. So, 26 students passed the exam.\n\nNow, to find out how many failed, I can subtract the number of students who passed from the total number of students. That is, 40 minus 26.\n\n40 minus 26 is 14.\n\nSo, 14 students failed the exam.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can directly calculate the percentage of students who failed and then find that number.\n\nIf 65% passed, then the remaining percentage must have failed. Since the total is 100%, the failure percentage is 100% minus 65%, which is 35%.\n\nSo, 35% of the students failed. Now, I can calculate 35% of 40 to find the number of students who failed.\n\nThat would be (35/100) * 40.\n\n35 times 40 is 1400, divided by 100 is 14.\n\nAgain, I get 14 students failed the exam.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is good. It confirms that 14 students failed the exam.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem to make sure I'm not missing anything?\n\nLet's see, another approach could be to use proportions. If 65% passed, then the ratio of passing students to total students is 65:100.\n\nSo, passing students / total students = 65/100.\n\nTherefore, passing students = (65/100) * 40, which again is 26.\n\nThen, failing students = total students - passing students = 40 - 26 = 14.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation. Let\u2019s say P is the number of students who passed, and F is the number who failed.\n\nI know that P + F = 40, and P = 65% of 40.\n\nSo, P = 0.65 * 40 = 26.\n\nThen, F = 40 - 26 = 14.\n\nYet another way: I could think in terms of fractions.\n\n65% is equivalent to 65/100, which simplifies to 13/20.\n\nSo, passing students = (13/20) * 40 = 26.\n\nFailing students = 40 - 26 = 14.\n\nAll these different methods lead me to the same conclusion that 14 students failed the exam.\n\nI think I've covered all the possible ways to approach this problem, and the answer remains consistent across different methods. So, I'm confident that the number of students who failed the exam is 14.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
