        "content": "Let's see. There's a problem here about two trains moving towards each other from different towns. Town A and Town B are 180 miles apart. One train leaves Town A going towards Town B at 60 mph, and another train leaves Town B going towards Town A at 40 mph. I need to figure out when they'll meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand the situation. Both trains are moving towards each other, so their speeds will add up relative to each other. That makes sense because they're approaching each other.\n\nSo, the speed of the first train is 60 mph, and the second train is 40 mph. If I add these speeds together, it's 100 mph. That means the distance between them is decreasing at a rate of 100 miles per hour.\n\nThe initial distance between them is 180 miles. To find out how long it takes for them to meet, I can divide the distance by their combined speed.\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, Time = 180 miles / 100 mph = 1.8 hours.\n\nBut maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using the concept of relative speed or something like that.\n\nLet me think about relative speed. If two objects are moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. That's what I did earlier, adding 60 mph and 40 mph to get 100 mph.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how far each train travels in a certain amount of time and set up an equation where the sum of the distances equals 180 miles.\n\nLet's denote the time until they meet as t hours.\n\nIn t hours, the first train would travel 60t miles, and the second train would travel 40t miles.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the sum of these distances should be equal to the initial distance between them, which is 180 miles.\n\nSo, 60t + 40t = 180\n\nCombining like terms, that's 100t = 180\n\nThen, t = 180 / 100 = 1.8 hours\n\nThat matches what I got earlier.\n\nMaybe I can convert 1.8 hours into hours and minutes to make it more understandable.\n\n1.8 hours is 1 hour plus 0.8 of an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 0.8 hours is 0.8 * 60 = 48 minutes.\n\nSo, the trains will meet after 1 hour and 48 minutes.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way to look at this problem. What if I consider the speed of one train relative to the other?\n\nLet's say I'm on the first train going at 60 mph, and I look at the second train coming towards me at 40 mph. Relative to me, the second train appears to be moving at 60 + 40 = 100 mph.\n\nSo, from my perspective, the second train is approaching me at 100 mph, and the distance is 180 miles. So, time = 180 / 100 = 1.8 hours, which again confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the first train's speed relative to a stationary second train, but that seems more complicated. The straightforward approach is to add their speeds since they're moving towards each other.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 1.8 hours, or 1 hour and 48 minutes.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's think about the positions of the trains at that time.\n\nAfter 1.8 hours, the first train would have traveled 60 mph * 1.8 hours = 108 miles.\n\nThe second train would have traveled 40 mph * 1.8 hours = 72 miles.\n\nAdding those distances: 108 + 72 = 180 miles, which matches the initial distance between the towns.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.8 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
