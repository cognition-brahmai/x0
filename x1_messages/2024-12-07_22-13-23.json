        "content": "So I've got this problem here: \"It takes 10 men 5 hours to build a wall. How long would it take 20 men to build the same wall?\" Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a task: building a wall. We know that 10 men can do it in 5 hours. Now, we're supposed to find out how long it would take if we double the number of men to 20.\n\nI think this is a problem about work and how it relates to the number of workers and the time they take. There's probably a relationship between the number of workers and the time required to complete a task.\n\nLet me recall, is this about direct proportion or inverse proportion? Hmm, if more men are working, they should be able to build the wall faster, right? So, as the number of men increases, the time should decrease. That sounds like inverse proportion.\n\nIn inverse proportion, the product of the two variables is constant. So, if m is the number of men and h is the time in hours, then m \u00d7 h = k, where k is a constant.\n\nGiven that 10 men take 5 hours, so k = 10 \u00d7 5 = 50.\n\nNow, if we have 20 men, we can set up the equation: 20 \u00d7 h = 50.\n\nSolving for h, h = 50 / 20 = 2.5 hours.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check if I'm applying the concept correctly.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of man-hours. The total work required to build the wall is fixed, right? So, the total man-hours needed is 10 men \u00d7 5 hours = 50 man-hours.\n\nIf we have 20 men, then the time t they need to work to complete the 50 man-hours of work is given by 20 \u00d7 t = 50.\n\nAgain, t = 50 / 20 = 2.5 hours.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous answer. Good, consistent results.\n\nLet me consider another angle. If 10 men take 5 hours, then one man would take 10 times longer, right? Because if you have only one man, he'd have to do all the work himself.\n\nSo, one man would take 10 \u00d7 5 = 50 hours.\n\nNow, if we have 20 men, they should be able to do the work 20 times faster than one man.\n\nSo, time taken by 20 men would be 50 / 20 = 2.5 hours.\n\nAgain, the same answer. Seems solid.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about it in terms of work rates.\n\nThe work rate of one man is the amount of work he can do per hour.\n\nIf one man's work rate is r walls per hour, then 10 men working together have a combined work rate of 10r.\n\nThey take 5 hours to build one wall, so:\n\n10r \u00d7 5 = 1 wall\n\nSo, 50r = 1 \u21d2 r = 1/50 walls per hour.\n\nNow, if we have 20 men, their combined work rate is 20r = 20 \u00d7 (1/50) = 20/50 = 2/5 walls per hour.\n\nTo build one wall, time t is given by:\n\n(2/5) walls per hour \u00d7 t hours = 1 wall\n\nSo, t = 1 / (2/5) = 5/2 = 2.5 hours.\n\nOnce again, 2.5 hours.\n\nI think I've approached this from multiple perspectives, and all methods lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 2.5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
