        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! To develop a Node.js application that connects to a Memcached server, stores key-value pairs, and retrieves values based on keys provided by the user, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up your environment:**\n   - Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).\n   - Install the `memjs` package, which is a client for Memcached in Node.js. You can install it using npm (Node Package Manager):\n\n     ```bash\n     npm install memjs\n     ```\n\n2. **Create the Node.js application:**\n   - Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:\n\n     ```bash\n     mkdir memcached-node-app\n     cd memcached-node-app\n     ```\n\n   - Create a new file, for example, `app.js`, where you'll write your application code.\n\n3. **Connect to the Memcached server:**\n   - In your `app.js`, require the `memjs` module and create a connection to your Memcached server. Assuming your Memcached server is running locally on the default port (11211), the code would look like this:\n\n     ```javascript\n     const memjs = require('memjs');\n\n     const client = memjs.Client.create('127.0.0.1:11211');\n     ```\n\n4. **Create functions to store and retrieve data:**\n   - Define functions to set a key-value pair and to get a value by key. Here's an example:\n\n     ```javascript\n     function setKeyValue(key, value) {\n       return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n         client.set(key, value, { expires: 0 }, (err) => {\n           if (err) {\n             reject(err);\n           } else {\n             resolve(`Key ${key} set successfully.`);\n           }\n         });\n       });\n     }\n\n     function getValueByKey(key) {\n       return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n         client.get(key, (err, value) => {\n           if (err) {\n             reject(err);\n           } else {\n             resolve(value);\n           }\n         });\n       });\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **Handle user input:**\n   - You can use the `readline` module to handle user input from the command line. Here's how you can set it up:\n\n     ```javascript\n     const readline = require('readline');\n\n     const rl = readline.createInterface({\n       input: process.stdin,\n       output: process.stdout\n     });\n\n     function askQuestion(query) {\n       return new Promise((resolve) => {\n         rl.question(query, (answer) => {\n           resolve(answer);\n         });\n       });\n     }\n     ```\n\n6. **Implement the main application logic:**\n   - Use the above functions to interact with the user and perform operations on Memcached. Here's an example of how you might structure the main part of your application:\n\n     ```javascript\n     async function main() {\n       let choice;\n\n       do {\n         console.log(\"\\nMemcached Node.js Application\");\n         console.log(\"1. Set key-value\");\n         console.log(\"2. Get value by key\");\n         console.log(\"3. Exit\");\n\n         choice = await askQuestion(\"Enter your choice: \");\n\n         switch (choice) {\n           case '1':\n             const key = await askQuestion(\"Enter key: \");\n             const value = await askQuestion(\"Enter value: \");\n             try {\n               const result = await setKeyValue(key, value);\n               console.log(result);\n             } catch (err) {\n               console.error(\"Error setting key-value:\", err);\n             }\n             break;\n           case '2':\n             const searchKey = await askQuestion(\"Enter key to retrieve value: \");\n             try {\n               const value = await getValueByKey(searchKey);\n               if (value) {\n                 console.log(`Value: ${value.toString()}`);\n               } else {\n                 console.log(\"Key not found.\");\n               }\n             } catch (err) {\n               console.error(\"Error getting value by key:\", err);\n             }\n             break;\n           case '3':\n             console.log(\"Exiting...\");\n             rl.close();\n             break;\n           default:\n             console.log(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\");\n         }\n       } while (choice !== '3');\n     }\n\n     main();\n     ```\n\n7. **Run your application:**\n   - Execute your application by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n     ```bash\n     node app.js\n     ```\n\n   - Follow the on-screen instructions to set and retrieve key-value pairs.\n\nThat's it! You've created a simple Node.js application that interacts with a Memcached server to store and retrieve data based on user input. This should give you a good starting point, and you can expand upon this foundation as needed for more complex scenarios."
