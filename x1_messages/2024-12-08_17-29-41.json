        "content": "So there's this problem here: In a room, there are 10 people who shake hands with each other once. How many handshakes will there be altogether? And I need to show my work.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what's being asked. We have 10 people, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. So, no-repeats, and it's not like they shake hands multiple times. Just once per pair of people.\n\nHmm, so how to approach this? Well, one way is to think about it combinatorially. Like, how many unique pairs can be formed from 10 people, since each handshake is between two people.\n\nI recall that the number of ways to choose k items from n items without regard to the order is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, n is 10 (the number of people), and k is 2 (since handshakes are between two people).\n\nSo plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 2) = \\frac{10!}{2!(10 - 2)!} = \\frac{10!}{2! \\cdot 8!}\n\\]\n\nNow, 10! is 10 factorial, which is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, but actually, we can simplify this before calculating.\n\nSince 10! is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!, and the 8! in the numerator and denominator will cancel out:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 2) = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8!}{2! \\times 8!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2!} = \\frac{90}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nSo, there should be 45 handshakes.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe there's another way to think about it.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider that each person shakes hands with every other person. So, the first person shakes hands with 9 others, the second person shakes hands with 8 remaining people (since they already shook hands with the first person), the third shakes hands with 7, and so on, until the last person, who doesn't need to shake hands with anyone because they've already shaken hands with everyone else.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be:\n\n9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = ?\n\nLet's add them up:\n\n9 + 8 = 17\n\n17 + 7 = 24\n\n24 + 6 = 30\n\n30 + 5 = 35\n\n35 + 4 = 39\n\n39 + 3 = 42\n\n42 + 2 = 44\n\n44 + 1 = 45\n\nAgain, 45 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, I know that the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nBut in this case, since the first person shakes hands with 9 others, it's the sum of the first 9 natural numbers:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{9 \\times 10}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nSame answer again.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I end up with 45 handshakes.\n\nMaybe to be extra sure, let's consider a smaller number of people and see if the formula holds.\n\nSuppose there are 3 people: A, B, and C.\n\nPossible handshakes: A-B, A-C, B-C. That's 3 handshakes.\n\nUsing the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(3, 2) = \\frac{3!}{2!(3 - 2)!} = \\frac{6}{2 \\times 1} = 3\n\\]\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother example: 4 people: A, B, C, D.\n\nPossible handshakes: A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, C-D. That's 6 handshakes.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2! \\times 2!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\times 2} = 6\n\\]\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold for smaller numbers, and since it's consistent across different methods, I'm confident that for 10 people, there will be 45 handshakes.\n\nJust to make sure there's no other factor to consider, like whether someone shakes hands with themselves or something, but that doesn't make sense. Handshakes are between two distinct people, so no need to worry about that.\n\nAlso, the problem says \"each other once,\" which confirms that it's a single handshake per pair.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 45 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
