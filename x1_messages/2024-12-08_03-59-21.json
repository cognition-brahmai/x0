        "content": "Let's break this down. So, the car rental company charges $25 per day for renting a car, and also charges an additional 10 cents for every mile you drive. I need to find out the total cost if I rent the car for 5 days and drive it for 300 miles.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the cost for renting the car for 5 days. Since it's $25 per day, I can multiply 25 by 5.\n\n25 * 5 = 125\n\nSo, the rental cost for 5 days is $125.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost for driving 300 miles. The charge is 10 cents per mile. So, I can multiply 0.10 by 300.\n\n0.10 * 300 = 30\n\nSo, the mileage cost is $30.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I need to add the rental cost and the mileage cost together.\n\n125 + 30 = 155\n\nTherefore, the total cost for renting the car for 5 days and driving it for 300 miles is $155.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nRental cost: $25 per day * 5 days = $125\n\nMileage cost: $0.10 per mile * 300 miles = $30\n\nTotal cost: $125 + $30 = $155\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the total cost formula, which would be:\n\nTotal Cost = (Daily Rental Rate * Number of Days) + (Mileage Rate * Number of Miles)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal Cost = (25 * 5) + (0.10 * 300) = 125 + 30 = 155\n\nSame result.\n\nI wonder if there are any additional fees or taxes that might apply, but since they're not mentioned in the problem, I'll assume that the total cost is just the sum of the rental and mileage costs.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The daily rate is in dollars per day, and the mileage rate is in dollars per mile, and the total is in dollars, which makes sense.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the total cost per day including mileage, but since the mileage is based on miles driven, it's better to keep them separate as they are.\n\nSo, the final answer is $155.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{155} \\]"
