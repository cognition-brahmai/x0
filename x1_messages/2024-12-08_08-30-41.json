        "content": "So I've got this problem here about organizing a tournament with 32 teams in a single-elimination format. Each team plays one game per week, and the tournament continues until we have a champion. I need to figure out two main things: the total number of games required to determine the champion and the duration of the tournament in weeks, considering possible scheduling conflicts and rest days between games.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the total number of games. In a single-elimination tournament, each game results in one team being eliminated. To find a champion among 32 teams, we need to eliminate 31 teams (since only one team remains as the champion). Therefore, the total number of games required is equal to the number of teams to be eliminated, which is 31.\n\nSo, total games = 31.\n\nNow, for the duration of the tournament in weeks, we need to consider how the games are scheduled. Each week, one game per team is allowed, but in a single-elimination tournament, not all teams play every week. In fact, in each round, half of the teams are eliminated, so the number of games per round decreases as the tournament progresses.\n\nLet's outline the structure of the tournament:\n\n- Round 1: 32 teams play 16 games, resulting in 16 winners.\n\n- Round 2: 16 teams play 8 games, resulting in 8 winners.\n\n- Round 3: 8 teams play 4 games, resulting in 4 winners.\n\n- Round 4: 4 teams play 2 games, resulting in 2 winners.\n\n- Round 5: 2 teams play 1 game, determining the champion.\n\nSo, there are 5 rounds in total.\n\nIf each round is scheduled in a single week, then the tournament would take 5 weeks. However, the problem mentions that each team plays one game per week, and we need to consider potential scheduling conflicts and rest days between games.\n\nWait a minute, in a single-elimination tournament, teams do not play every week. They play only when they are in the current round. For example, in Round 1, 32 teams play in week 1, then the 16 winners proceed to Round 2 in week 2, and so on.\n\nBut the problem states that each team plays one game per week. This seems a bit conflicting because in a standard single-elimination tournament, teams do not play every week; they are eliminated after one loss.\n\nPerhaps the intention is that the surviving teams play one game per week, meaning that in each week, a certain number of games are played, corresponding to that round.\n\nGiven that, let's consider the scheduling:\n\n- Week 1: Round 1 \u2013 16 games.\n\n- Week 2: Round 2 \u2013 8 games.\n\n- Week 3: Round 3 \u2013 4 games.\n\n- Week 4: Round 4 \u2013 2 games.\n\n- Week 5: Round 5 \u2013 1 game.\n\nThis would mean the tournament lasts for 5 weeks.\n\nHowever, the problem mentions \"each team plays one game per week.\" This seems inconsistent with single-elimination, where teams are eliminated after one loss and thus do not play in subsequent weeks.\n\nMaybe the tournament is designed differently, perhaps with some kind of seeding or byes, but in standard single-elimination, it's not possible for each team to play every week.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a mistake in the problem statement, and it should be each remaining team plays one game per week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a misinterpretation of the single-elimination format.\n\nWait, perhaps the tournament is designed so that in each week, the remaining teams play to eliminate half of them, and this continues until one champion remains.\n\nIn that case, with 32 teams:\n\n- Week 1: 32 teams play 16 games, 16 winners advance.\n\n- Week 2: 16 teams play 8 games, 8 winners advance.\n\n- Week 3: 8 teams play 4 games, 4 winners advance.\n\n- Week 4: 4 teams play 2 games, 2 winners advance.\n\n- Week 5: 2 teams play 1 game, determine the champion.\n\nSo, again, 5 weeks.\n\nBut the problem says \"each team plays one game per week.\" In this setup, only the remaining teams play each week, not all 32 teams every week.\n\nWait, perhaps the tournament is double-elimination or something else, but the problem specifies single-elimination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a round-robin tournament, but that doesn't align with single-elimination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a single-elimination bracket where each surviving team plays one game per week.\n\nIn that case, the number of weeks would still be 5, as each round corresponds to one week.\n\nBut the problem specifically says it's a single-elimination format, and each team plays one game per week.\n\nI think the confusion arises from the phrase \"each team plays one game per week.\" In single-elimination, only the remaining teams play each week, not all teams every week.\n\nPerhaps the intention is that in each week, the remaining teams play their current round's game.\n\nGiven that, the tournament would still take 5 weeks, as outlined above.\n\nHowever, the problem also mentions \"taking into account potential scheduling conflicts and the need for rest days between games.\"\n\nIn single-elimination, since each team plays only once and then is either eliminated or advances, rest days aren't an issue because they don't play consecutive games.\n\nBut if we consider that teams need rest days between their games in case it's a different format, it might affect the scheduling.\n\nBut given it's single-elimination, and each team plays only once until eliminated, rest days don't come into play in the same way.\n\nTherefore, the tournament duration is determined by the number of rounds, which is 5 for 32 teams.\n\nHence, the tournament lasts for 5 weeks.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nTotal number of games: 31\n\nDuration of the tournament: 5 weeks\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{31 \\text{ games, } 5 \\text{ weeks}} \\]"
