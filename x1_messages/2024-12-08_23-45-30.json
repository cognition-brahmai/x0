So, it's something that has one eye, which probably means it has a single opening or a marker that's referred to as an \"eye,\" but it can't see. That rules out animals or anything living, because if they have an eye, they can see. So maybe it's an object.\n\nI remember that a needle has an eye, right? The hole through which thread passes is called the eye of the needle. But a needle can't see; it's just an object. So, could the answer be a needle? That makes sense because it has one eye and it can't see.\n\nWait, but are there any other objects that have an eye? Maybe a potato has eyes, but those are the sprout spots, and it's still an object that can't see. But needles are more commonly associated with having eyes.\n\nLet me check if there are any other possibilities. Maybe a spoon has an eye if it's a demitasse spoon or something, but that seems stretchy. Or perhaps a weather eye, but that's a figure of speech. No, I think needle is the most straightforward answer.\n\nSo, the answer to \"What has one eye but cannot see?\" is a needle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{needle}} \\]"
