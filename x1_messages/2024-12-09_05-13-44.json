Invented by Alfred Mosher Butts in the 1930s during the Great Depression, Scrabble has since become a beloved pastime enjoyed by millions around the world. The game's simplicity and strategic depth make it a timeless favorite, and its cultural impact is evident in the numerous tournaments and competitive leagues that have sprung up over the years.\n\nScrabble is played on a square grid of 15x15 squares, where players take turns placing lettered tiles on the grid to form words in a crossword fashion. Each letter tile has a point value based on its frequency in the English language, with common letters like E and A worth one point and less common letters like Q and Z worth higher points. The goal is to score points by forming words horizontally or vertically, connecting to existing words on the board, and utilizing premium squares that multiply the value of letters or words.\n\nAlfred Mosher Butts developed Scrabble during the Great Depression as a way to create a new board game that combined elements of anagrams and crossword puzzles. He initially called it \"Criss Cross Words\" before it was renamed Scrabble in 1948. The game's popularity surged in the 1950s, and it has since been translated into multiple languages and adapted for various cultures and languages worldwide.\n\nScrabble not only provides entertainment but also promotes vocabulary building, spelling skills, and strategic thinking. It encourages players to think creatively and strategically about word placement and tile management, making it a mentally stimulating activity for people of all ages.\n\nIn summary, Scrabble is a legendary board game invented by Alfred Mosher Butts during the Great Depression. Its enduring popularity is a testament to its engaging gameplay, educational benefits, and the joy it brings to players across generations and cultures."
