        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem about a zoo expanding its animal habitats in three phases: mammals, birds, and reptiles/amphibians. The total budget is $3 million, and it's divided into percentages for each group: 40% for mammals, 30% for birds, and 30% for reptiles/amphibians. I need to figure out how much money should be spent on each type of enclosure.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the total budget is and how it's being split. The total budget is $3 million. That's $3,000,000. Okay, got that.\n\nNow, 40% of that is for mammal enclosures. So, I need to calculate 40% of $3,000,000. Similarly, 30% for birds and 30% for reptiles/amphibians. But I should make sure that all the percentages add up to 100%. Let's check: 40% + 30% + 30% = 100%. Good, that covers the entire budget.\n\nSo, starting with mammals: 40% of $3,000,000. To calculate that, I can multiply 3,000,000 by 40% or 0.40.\n\nLet me do the math: 3,000,000 * 0.40 = 1,200,000. So, $1,200,000 should be spent on mammal enclosures.\n\nNext, birds: 30% of $3,000,000. That's 3,000,000 * 0.30 = 900,000. So, $900,000 for bird enclosures.\n\nFinally, reptiles/amphibians: also 30%. So, again, 3,000,000 * 0.30 = 900,000. $900,000 for reptile/amphibian enclosures.\n\nJust to double-check, let's add up all the amounts: 1,200,000 + 900,000 + 900,000 = 3,000,000. Yes, that matches the total budget.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Mammals: $1,200,000\n\n- Birds: $900,000\n\n- Reptiles/amphibians: $900,000\n\nI think that's straightforward. But maybe there's more to it. Maybe I should consider if there are any other costs that might be associated with the expansion that aren't being accounted for in this budget allocation. For example, maybe there are overhead costs, or perhaps some species within these groups require more expensive enclosures.\n\nBut based on the information provided, I don't think I need to worry about that. The problem specifies that the budget is allocated percentages for each group, so I can assume that's how the money should be spent.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if the percentages are correctly allocated. The problem says 40% for mammals, 30% for birds, and 30% for reptiles/amphibians. That seems fair, but I wonder if that's based on any particular criteria, like the number of species or the space they need.\n\nBut again, the problem doesn't provide that information, so I probably don't need to consider it.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using fractions instead of decimals.\n\nSo, 40% is the same as 40/100, which simplifies to 2/5. So, 2/5 of $3,000,000 is (2/5)*3,000,000 = 1,200,000. Same as before.\n\nSimilarly, 30% is 30/100, which is 3/10. So, 3/10 of 3,000,000 is (3/10)*3,000,000 = 900,000.\n\nSame results as before.\n\nI think that's solid. No need to change anything.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n- Mammals: $1,200,000\n\n- Birds: $900,000\n\n- Reptiles/amphibians: $900,000\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Mammals: } \\$1,200,000,\\ \\text{Birds: } \\$900,000,\\ \\text{Reptiles/Amphibians: } \\$900,000} \\]"
