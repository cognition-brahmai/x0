This script retrieves all running processes on the local computer, sorts them by their memory usage in descending order, and then displays the process name, process ID (PID), and memory usage.\n\n```powershell\n# Get all running processes and sort them by memory usage in descending order\n$processes = Get-Process | Sort-Object -Property WS -Descending\n\n# Select and display the process name, PID, and memory usage\n$processes | Select-Object Name, Id, @{Name=\"MemoryUsageKB\";Expression={$_.WS / 1KB}} | Format-Table -AutoSize\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Get-Process**: This cmdlet retrieves all running processes on the local computer.\n2. **Sort-Object -Property WS -Descending**: This sorts the processes based on the 'WS' (Working Set) property, which represents the amount of memory used by the process, in bytes. The `-Descending` parameter ensures that processes using more memory appear first.\n3. **Select-Object Name, Id, @{Name=\"MemoryUsageKB\";Expression={$_.WS / 1KB}}**: This selects the process name and ID, and calculates the memory usage in kilobytes for better readability.\n4. **Format-Table -AutoSize**: This formats the output as a table and adjusts the column widths to fit the content.\n\nYou can run this script in PowerShell to see the list of processes sorted by memory usage."
