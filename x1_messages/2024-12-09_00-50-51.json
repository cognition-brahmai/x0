        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a car depreciates at a rate of 15% per year, and I need to find out what its value will be after 5 years if it was initially worth $25,000. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what depreciation means. Depreciation is when the value of something decreases over time. In this case, it's decreasing by 15% each year. So, each year, the car is worth 15% less than it was the previous year.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to use the formula for exponential decay, because depreciation is similar to exponential decay. The general formula for exponential decay is:\n\n\\[V = P \\times (1 - r)^t\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(V\\) is the final value\n\n- \\(P\\) is the initial principal balance (in this case, the initial value of the car)\n\n- \\(r\\) is the depreciation rate\n\n- \\(t\\) is the time in years\n\nSo, plugging in the values from the problem:\n\n- \\(P = 25,000\\)\n\n- \\(r = 0.15\\) (since 15% as a decimal is 0.15)\n\n- \\(t = 5\\)\n\nTherefore, the formula becomes:\n\n\\[V = 25,000 \\times (1 - 0.15)^5\\]\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate \\(1 - 0.15\\):\n\n\\[1 - 0.15 = 0.85\\]\n\nSo, now it's:\n\n\\[V = 25,000 \\times (0.85)^5\\]\n\nNext, I need to calculate \\(0.85\\) raised to the power of 5. Let's do that:\n\n\\[0.85^1 = 0.85\\]\\[0.85^2 = 0.7225\\]\\[0.85^3 = 0.614125\\]\\[0.85^4 = 0.52195625\\]\\[0.85^5 = 0.44366278125\\]\n\nSo, \\(0.85^5\\) is approximately \\(0.4437\\) (I'll round it for simplicity).\n\nNow, multiply that by the initial value:\n\n\\[V = 25,000 \\times 0.4437 = 11,092.5\\]\n\nSo, the value of the car after 5 years would be approximately $11,092.50.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with \\(0.85^5\\):\n\n\\[0.85^2 = 0.7225\\]\\[0.7225 \\times 0.85 = 0.614125\\]\\[0.614125 \\times 0.85 = 0.52195625\\]\\[0.52195625 \\times 0.85 = 0.44366278125\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, multiplying by 25,000:\n\n\\[25,000 \\times 0.44366278125 = 11,091.56953125\\]\n\nRounded to two decimal places, that's $11,091.57.\n\nHmm, earlier I had $11,092.50, but that might be due to rounding differences. Let me confirm the exact value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a financial formula for depreciation. Sometimes, depreciation is calculated differently, like straight-line depreciation or others.\n\nIn straight-line depreciation, the value decreases by a constant amount each year, but in this case, it's a percentage, so it's probably exponential decay, which makes sense for depreciation based on percentage.\n\nAlternatively, some methods might use compound depreciation, which is similar to what I've done.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the depreciation each year and subtract it from the value.\n\nStarting with $25,000.\n\nYear 1:\n\nDepreciation = 15% of 25,000 = 0.15 \u00d7 25,000 = $3,750\n\nValue at end of Year 1 = 25,000 - 3,750 = $21,250\n\nYear 2:\n\nDepreciation = 15% of 21,250 = 0.15 \u00d7 21,250 = $3,187.50\n\nValue at end of Year 2 = 21,250 - 3,187.50 = $18,062.50\n\nYear 3:\n\nDepreciation = 15% of 18,062.50 = 0.15 \u00d7 18,062.50 = $2,709.375\n\nValue at end of Year 3 = 18,062.50 - 2,709.375 = $15,353.125\n\nYear 4:\n\nDepreciation = 15% of 15,353.125 = 0.15 \u00d7 15,353.125 = $2,302.96875\n\nValue at end of Year 4 = 15,353.125 - 2,302.96875 = $13,050.15625\n\nYear 5:\n\nDepreciation = 15% of 13,050.15625 = 0.15 \u00d7 13,050.15625 = $1,957.5234375\n\nValue at end of Year 5 = 13,050.15625 - 1,957.5234375 = $11,092.6328125\n\nSo, according to this method, the value after 5 years is approximately $11,092.63.\n\nComparing this to the earlier calculation using the exponential formula, which gave $11,091.57, there's a slight difference due to rounding.\n\nBut both methods give roughly the same result, so I can conclude that the value of the car after 5 years is around $11,092.\n\nLet me just confirm if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSometimes, depreciation is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[V = P \\times (1 - r)^t\\]\n\nWhich is exactly what I used first. So, it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if it were straight-line depreciation, the value would decrease by a constant amount each year, but since it's a percentage, it's exponential decay.\n\nI think the exponential decay formula is the correct approach here.\n\nTherefore, the value of the car after 5 years is approximately $11,092.\n\nWait, but in the step-by-step calculation, it was $11,092.63, and with the formula, it was $11,091.57. The difference is only $1.06, which is negligible due to rounding.\n\nSo, for practical purposes, $11,093 would be a fair estimate.\n\nBut to be more precise, I'll keep it at $11,092.\n\nLet me just check if there's any other factor I should consider. Is there any salvage value or anything like that mentioned in the problem? No, it's just the initial value and the depreciation rate.\n\nAlso, the depreciation is annual and compounded annually, which aligns with the formula I used.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that $11,092 is the correct value after 5 years.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the depreciation were simple interest style, but that doesn't make sense for depreciation, which is typically compounded.\n\nSo, exponential decay is the appropriate method.\n\nAlright, I think that's it. The value of the car after 5 years of depreciating at 15% per year from an initial value of $25,000 is approximately $11,092.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11092} \\]"
