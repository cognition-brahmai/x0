She tells them that she hid the presents in different rooms: Peter's is in the living room, Susan's is in the kitchen, and Paul's is in the study. While the children are playing outside, Grandpa moves Peter's present from the living room to the dining room, Susan's present from the kitchen to the bathroom, and Paul's present from the study to the bedroom. When the children go inside to search for their presents, where will each child look first?"

        "content": "Let's see. So, Grandma hid three presents for Peter, Susan, and Paul in different rooms: Peter's in the living room, Susan's in the kitchen, and Paul's in the study. But then, while the children were playing outside, Grandpa moved them all to different rooms: Peter's to the dining room, Susan's to the bathroom, and Paul's to the bedroom.\n\nNow, the question is, when the children go inside to search for their presents, where will each child look first?\n\nHmm. Well, Grandma told them where she hid the presents originally. So, Peter was told his present is in the living room, Susan was told hers is in the kitchen, and Paul was told his is in the study.\n\nBut Grandpa moved them without telling the children, so they don't know about the new locations.\n\nSo, if they go inside to search for their presents, they would probably look first in the rooms where Grandma said the presents were hidden.\n\nTherefore, Peter would look first in the living room, Susan in the kitchen, and Paul in the study.\n\nEven though Grandpa moved them, the children don't know that, so they would still check the original places first based on Grandma's information.\n\nMaybe some of them would check other rooms if they don't find their presents in the original locations, but initially, they would look where Grandma said the presents were.\n\nSo, to answer the question, each child will look first in the room that Grandma told them their present was hidden: Peter in the living room, Susan in the kitchen, and Paul in the study.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Peter: living room, Susan: kitchen, Paul: study}} \\]"
