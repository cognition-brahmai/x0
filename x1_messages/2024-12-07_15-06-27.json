        "content": "I've got this problem here: A book has 100 pages, and if you open it completely randomly, what's the probability that the sum of the two facing page numbers is 101? Interesting. So, first things first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLet me think about how books are arranged. Usually, books have pages numbered sequentially, and when you open a book, you see two pages at once: the right-hand page and the left-hand page. For example, if you open to page 10, you'd see page 10 on the right and page 9 on the left.\n\nWait, actually, in most books, the page numbers are on the bottom or top, and when you open the book, the left page has an even number, and the right has an odd number. No, hold on, that's not generally true. In many books, especially printed books, the left page has the lower page number, and the right has the higher one. For example, open to a spread, and you have page 20 on the left and 21 on the right.\n\nBut actually, standard book pagination typically has left pages with even numbers and right pages with odd numbers. Wait, no, in English books, the right page is usually the odd-numbered page, and the left is even. But to make sure, maybe I should confirm that.\n\nAssuming that's the case, then when you open the book to any random spread, you see an even page number on the left and the next odd page number on the right.\n\nSo, for page pairs like (2,3), (4,5), up to (98,99). Note that page 1 is likely to be the first page, and page 100 would be on the right side of the last spread.\n\nBut wait, does the book have a cover page or title pages that might affect pagination? The problem doesn't specify, so maybe we can assume it's just pages 1 through 100, front to back.\n\nNow, the question is about the sum of the two facing page numbers being 101. So, if I denote the left page as L and the right page as R, and usually R = L + 1.\n\nSo, L + R = L + (L + 1) = 2L + 1 = 101.\n\nSolving for L: 2L + 1 = 101 => 2L = 100 => L = 50.\n\nSo, the only pair that sums to 101 is pages 50 and 51.\n\nNow, how many total possible pairs are there?\n\nSince the book has 100 pages, the number of possible spreads you can open to is 50, because each spread shows two pages.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let's see: pages 1 and 2, 3 and 4, up to 99 and 100. Wait, no, that would be 50 spreads.\n\nBut in standard book pagination, it's more like pages 2 and 3, 4 and 5, up to 98 and 99, with page 1 being the front page and page 100 being on its own, or something like that.\n\nHmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think differently. If the book has 100 pages, and you open it randomly to any spread, you're seeing two consecutive pages, say n and n+1.\n\nSo, the sum is n + (n+1) = 2n + 1.\n\nWe set that equal to 101: 2n + 1 = 101 => n = 50.\n\nSo, only one pair satisfies this: pages 50 and 51.\n\nNow, how many total possible spreads are there?\n\nIf the book has 100 pages, the possible spreads are from pages (1,2), (2,3), ..., up to (99,100). So, there are 99 possible spreads.\n\nWait, but in actual book pagination, you don't have overlapping page pairs like (1,2), (2,3). Each spread shows a unique pair without overlapping.\n\nWait, no, in a physical book, each spread shows two consecutive pages, but you don't have the same page appearing in two different spreads.\n\nSo, for a book with p pages, the number of possible spreads is p/2, assuming p is even.\n\nIn this case, p=100, so number of spreads is 50.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it's 99, but that's if you consider overlapping pairs, which isn't the case in physical books.\n\nSo, correcting myself, in a physical book with 100 pages, there are 50 possible spreads.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/50, since only one spread (50,51) sums to 101.\n\nWait, but let's check: if spreads are (1,2), (3,4), ..., up to (99,100), then page 50 and 51 are indeed one of these spreads.\n\nSo, probability is 1/50.\n\nBut hold on, in standard book pagination, the spreads are often (left page, right page), with left being even and right being odd, or vice versa.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that.\n\nIn many books, the left page is even, and the right page is odd.\n\nSo, spreads would be (2,3), (4,5), ..., (98,99).\n\nWait, but in this scheme, page 100 would be on the left side with page 99 on the right, but that might not be standard.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the last spread has page 99 on the left and page 100 on the right.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the book has 100 pages, numbered from 1 to 100, and when you open the book randomly, you see two consecutive pages, regardless of their numbering.\n\nIn that case, there are 50 possible spreads, and only one of them sums to 101, so probability is 1/50.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nConsider that the sum of the two facing pages is n + (n+1) = 2n + 1.\n\nWe set 2n + 1 = 101 => n = 50.\n\nSo, only when the left page is 50 and the right is 51.\n\nNow, assuming that the book has 100 pages, and spreads are paired as (1,2), (3,4), ..., (99,100), then yes, there are 50 possible spreads, and only one of them is (50,51).\n\nHence, probability is 1/50.\n\nAlternatively, if the book is paginated differently, say, spreads are (2,3), (4,5), ..., (98,99), with page 100 possibly\u5355\u72ec on the right or something, but still, it would likely still be 50 spreads.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the book has front matter or something, but the problem states \"a book contains 100 pages,\" so likely it's just pages 1 through 100.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 1/50.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should consider that the book might have an introduction or something, but the problem doesn't specify, so probably it's just 100 pages of main text.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the book has pages numbered from 0 to 99, but that's unlikely, as books usually start with page 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the book has pages numbered from 1 to 100, with page 1 on the right of the first spread, and page 2 on the left, but that seems unusual.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the book is paginated such that each spread shows pages (2k, 2k+1), for k from 1 to 50.\n\nIn that case, pages 50 and 51 are one spread, and their sum is 101.\n\nSo, again, probability is 1/50.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the book alternates odd and even pages differently, but I think the standard pagination is to have even pages on the left and odd on the right.\n\nIn any case, the key is to determine how many possible spreads there are and how many of them satisfy the condition that the sum of the page numbers is 101.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is indeed 1/50.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nConsider that the sum of the two facing pages is uniformly distributed over possible sums.\n\nWhat are the possible sums?\n\nThe smallest sum is 1 + 2 = 3, and the largest is 99 + 100 = 199.\n\nThe sums increase by 2 for each subsequent spread, since you're adding (n + (n+1)) and ((n+1) + (n+2)), which are 2n + 1 and 2n + 3, respectively.\n\nSo, sums are 3, 5, 7, ..., up to 199.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with first term 3, last term 199, and common difference 2.\n\nNumber of terms: n = ((199 - 3)/2) + 1 = (196/2) + 1 = 98 + 1 = 99.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there are 50 possible spreads, but now I have 99 possible sums.\n\nThis suggests that maybe there are overlapping pairs being considered here.\n\nBut in a physical book, spreads don't overlap; each spread shows a unique pair of pages.\n\nSo, perhaps the 99 sums correspond to pairs (1,2), (2,3), ..., (99,100), but in reality, you can't have overlapping spreads in a physical book.\n\nTherefore, perhaps in a physical book with 100 pages, there are only 50 possible spreads, as initially thought.\n\nHence, the probability is 1/50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the book is arranged differently.\n\nWait, maybe the book has pages numbered from 0 to 99, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the book has front matter pages that are unnumbered, but the problem states \"a book contains 100 pages,\" so likely all pages are numbered from 1 to 100.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the book is arranged such that the first spread is pages 1 and 2, the second spread is pages 3 and 4, and so on, up to pages 99 and 100.\n\nIn this case, there are indeed 50 spreads.\n\nHence, only one spread satisfies the condition, so probability is 1/50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the book has a different pagination style, but without specification, I think assuming standard pagination is reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/50.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should consider that the book might have an introduction or something, but the problem states \"a book contains 100 pages,\" so likely it's just pages 1 through 100.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the book has pages numbered from 1 to 100, with pages 1 and 2 on the first spread, 3 and 4 on the second, and so on, up to 99 and 100 on the last spread.\n\nIn this case, again, 50 spreads, probability is 1/50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the book has pages arranged differently, but without specification, I think 1/50 is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{50}} \\]"
