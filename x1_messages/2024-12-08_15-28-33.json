        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this task. I need to create a simple Node.js server that can handle POST requests with JSON payloads containing a \"timestamp\" and a \"value\", and then keep track of the sum of these \"value\" properties for the last 60 seconds. Additionally, a GET request to \"/sum\" should return this sum.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a basic Node.js server. I'll use the `express` framework because it makes handling HTTP requests easy. If I don't have express installed, I can install it using npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install express\n```\n\nNext, I'll create a file, say `server.js`, and start by importing the necessary modules:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000; // or any other port you prefer\n```\n\nSince I need to handle JSON payloads, I should use express's json body parser:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(express.json());\n```\n\nNow, I need to create a route for POST requests to \"/data\". This endpoint should accept a JSON object with \"timestamp\" and \"value\" properties. I need to store these values somewhere, but I also need to ensure that I only consider the values from the last 60 seconds when calculating the sum.\n\nTo handle this, I can use an array to store the received data points and periodically clean up old entries. However, for efficiency, especially if the server receives a high volume of requests, I should consider using a data structure that allows quick insertion and removal of old items. A queue, specifically a doubly-ended queue (deque), would be ideal, but JavaScript doesn't have a built-in deque. Instead, I can use an array and manage it carefully.\n\nI'll store the data points in an array, and before calculating the sum, I'll remove any entries older than 60 seconds.\n\nHere's how I can implement the POST endpoint:\n\n```javascript\nconst dataPoints = [];\n\napp.post('/data', (req, res) => {\n    const { timestamp, value } = req.body;\n    const now = new Date();\n    const receivedAt = new Date(timestamp);\n    \n    // Only accept data points received in the last 60 seconds\n    if (now - receivedAt <= 60000) {\n        dataPoints.push({ timestamp, value });\n        res.status(200).send('Data received');\n    } else {\n        res.status(400).send('Timestamp is too old');\n    }\n});\n```\n\nNow, for the GET endpoint \"/sum\", I need to calculate the sum of \"value\" for all data points received in the last 60 seconds.\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/sum', (req, res) => {\n    const now = new Date();\n    const oneMinuteAgo = new Date(now.getTime() - 60000);\n    \n    let sum = 0;\n    for (let i = dataPoints.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n        const dataPoint = dataPoints[i];\n        const timestamp = new Date(dataPoint.timestamp);\n        if (timestamp >= oneMinuteAgo) {\n            sum += dataPoint.value;\n        } else {\n            // Since timestamps are in order, no need to check older entries\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    res.json({ sum });\n});\n```\n\nWait a minute, for this to work efficiently, I need to keep the dataPoints array sorted by timestamp in ascending order. That way, when calculating the sum, I can iterate from the end backwards and stop once I reach an entry older than 60 seconds.\n\nTo ensure the array is sorted, I should insert new data points in the correct position. However, this could be inefficient for large arrays. An alternative is to accept that the array is unsorted and filter it each time, but that might be acceptable for smaller loads.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll assume that the array is unsorted and filter it each time.\n\nHere's an updated version:\n\n```javascript\napp.post('/data', (req, res) => {\n    const { timestamp, value } = req.body;\n    const now = new Date();\n    const receivedAt = new Date(timestamp);\n    \n    if (now - receivedAt <= 60000) {\n        dataPoints.push({ timestamp, value });\n        res.status(200).send('Data received');\n    } else {\n        res.status(400).send('Timestamp is too old');\n    }\n});\n\napp.get('/sum', (req, res) => {\n    const now = new Date();\n    const oneMinuteAgo = now.getTime() - 60000;\n    \n    const recentPoints = dataPoints.filter(dp => new Date(dp.timestamp).getTime() >= oneMinuteAgo);\n    const sum = recentPoints.reduce((acc, dp) => acc + dp.value, 0);\n    res.json({ sum });\n});\n```\n\nThis should work, but over time, the `dataPoints` array will grow indefinitely, which is not efficient. To handle this, I should periodically clean up old entries or use a mechanism to automatically remove old data points.\n\nOne way to handle this is to set up an interval that periodically removes old data points.\n\n```javascript\nsetInterval(() => {\n    const now = new Date();\n    const oneMinuteAgo = now.getTime() - 60000;\n    dataPoints.splice(0, dataPoints.length, ...dataPoints.filter(dp => new Date(dp.timestamp).getTime() >= oneMinuteAgo));\n}, 60000); // every minute\n```\n\nThis interval will run every minute and remove any data points older than 60 seconds.\n\nAlternatively, I can remove old entries when calculating the sum, but that might not be efficient if the array gets large.\n\nAnother approach is to use a data structure that automatically expires old entries, like a queue where I push new entries and remove old ones as needed.\n\nHere's an example using a queue-like approach:\n\n```javascript\nconst dataPoints = [];\n\napp.post('/data', (req, res) => {\n    const { timestamp, value } = req.body;\n    const now = new Date();\n    const receivedAt = new Date(timestamp);\n    \n    if (now - receivedAt <= 60000) {\n        dataPoints.push({ timestamp, value });\n        res.status(200).send('Data received');\n    } else {\n        res.status(400).send('Timestamp is too old');\n    }\n});\n\napp.get('/sum', (req, res) => {\n    const now = new Date();\n    const oneMinuteAgo = now.getTime() - 60000;\n    \n    let sum = 0;\n    while (dataPoints.length > 0 && new Date(dataPoints[0].timestamp).getTime() < oneMinuteAgo) {\n        dataPoints.shift();\n    }\n    sum = dataPoints.reduce((acc, dp) => acc + dp.value, 0);\n    res.json({ sum });\n});\n```\n\nIn this version, every time a GET request is made to \"/sum\", it first removes old data points from the front of the array before calculating the sum. This way, the array doesn't grow indefinitely, and old data is cleaned up on demand.\n\nThis seems efficient enough for a simple server. If I anticipate a very high volume of requests, I might need to optimize further, perhaps by using a more efficient data structure or by batching updates.\n\nFinally, I need to start the server:\n\n```javascript\napp.listen(port, () => {\n    console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);\n});\n```\n\nPutting it all together, here's the complete code:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.use(express.json());\n\nconst dataPoints = [];\n\napp.post('/data', (req, res) => {\n    const { timestamp, value } = req.body;\n    const now = new Date();\n    const receivedAt = new Date(timestamp);\n    \n    if (now - receivedAt <= 60000) {\n        dataPoints.push({ timestamp, value });\n        res.status(200).send('Data received');\n    } else {\n        res.status(400).send('Timestamp is too old');\n    }\n});\n\napp.get('/sum', (req, res) => {\n    const now = new Date();\n    const oneMinuteAgo = now.getTime() - 60000;\n    \n    while (dataPoints.length > 0 && new Date(dataPoints[0].timestamp).getTime() < oneMinuteAgo) {\n        dataPoints.shift();\n    }\n    const sum = dataPoints.reduce((acc, dp) => acc + dp.value, 0);\n    res.json({ sum });\n});\n\n// Optionally, clean up old data points periodically\nsetInterval(() => {\n    const now = new Date();\n    const oneMinuteAgo = now.getTime() - 60000;\n    dataPoints.splice(0, dataPoints.length, ...dataPoints.filter(dp => new Date(dp.timestamp).getTime() >= oneMinuteAgo));\n}, 60000);\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n    console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);\n});\n```\n\nThis should satisfy the requirements. The server accepts JSON payloads via POST to \"/data\", keeps track of the sum of \"value\" properties for the last 60 seconds, and returns this sum via a GET request to \"/sum\"."
