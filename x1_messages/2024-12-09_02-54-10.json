        "content": "Let's see. The farmer has a rectangular field that's 200 meters long and 100 meters wide. He wants to plant trees along the perimeter, with each tree spaced 10 meters apart. I need to figure out how many trees he'll need for that.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate the perimeter of the field since the trees are going around the edge. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nP = 2(200) + 2(100) = 400 + 200 = 600 meters.\n\nThat means the total distance around the field is 600 meters.\n\nNow, if he wants to plant trees every 10 meters, I can divide the perimeter by the spacing to find out how many trees are needed.\n\nNumber of trees = Perimeter /Spacing = 600 /10 = 60 trees.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that when placing objects at regular intervals along a closed path, you have to consider that the first and last tree will be at the same point, so you might end up with one less tree than the division suggests.\n\nLet me think about this again. If I start at one corner and place a tree every 10 meters, when I get back to the starting point, the last tree would be at the same place as the first one, so I shouldn't double-count it.\n\nSo, in that case, the number of trees would actually be Perimeter / Spacing = 600 /10 = 60 trees.\n\nBut, to confirm, let's imagine a smaller scale. Suppose the field is 10 meters by 5 meters.\n\nPerimeter would be 2(10) + 2(5) = 20 + 10 = 30 meters.\n\nIf trees are spaced 5 meters apart, Number of trees = 30 /5 = 6 trees.\n\nLet's list them:\n\nStart at corner A, tree 1.\n\nMove 5 meters to point B, tree 2.\n\nMove another 5 meters to point C, tree 3.\n\nContinue around the perimeter.\n\nWhen I get back to corner A, which is 30 meters away, that should be tree 7, but since it's the same as tree 1, I don't need an extra tree there.\n\nSo, total trees needed are 6.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, Perimeter is 600 meters, spacing is 10 meters, so Number of trees = 600 /10 = 60 trees.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people make the mistake of thinking it's Perimeter / Spacing +1, but that would be for an open path, not a closed one.\n\nSince the field is rectangular and the trees are planted around the perimeter, forming a closed loop, the correct calculation is Perimeter / Spacing.\n\nTherefore, the farmer will need 60 trees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
