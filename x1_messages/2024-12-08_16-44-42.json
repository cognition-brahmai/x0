        "content": "In electrical engineering, the term \"reactance\" refers to a component's resistance to alternating current (AC). There are two types of reactance: capacitive and inductive. Capacitive reactance decreases with increasing frequency, while inductive reactance increases with increasing frequency. The total reactance in a circuit can be calculated by subtracting the capacitive reactance from the inductive reactance. What does the reactance of a component in an electrical circuit primarily depend on?\nA. The resistance of the component\nB. The frequency of the AC signal\nC. The voltage across the component\nD. The power consumed by the component\nE. All of the above"

        "content": "The reactance of a component in an electrical circuit primarily depends on the frequency of the AC signal. So, the correct answer is B. The frequency of the AC signal.\n\nTo elaborate a bit, reactance is a property of capacitors and inductors that resists changes in voltage and current, respectively, in an AC circuit. It's different from resistance, which is present in resistors and resists the flow of current regardless of the frequency.\n\nInductive reactance (XL) increases with increasing frequency and is given by the formula:\n\nXL = 2 * \u03c0 * f * L\n\nWhere:\n\n- f is the frequency of the AC signal\n\n- L is the inductance of the component\n\nCapacitive reactance (XC), on the other hand, decreases with increasing frequency and is given by:\n\nXC = 1 / (2 * \u03c0 * f * C)\n\nWhere:\n\n- f is the frequency of the AC signal\n\n- C is the capacitance of the component\n\nSo, as you can see, both types of reactance are directly dependent on the frequency of the AC signal.\n\nNow, let's quickly look at why the other options aren't primarily correct:\n\nA. The resistance of the component: Resistance is a different property from reactance. While resistance affects the magnitude of current in an AC circuit, it doesn't change with frequency like reactance does.\n\nC. The voltage across the component: Reactance affects the relationship between voltage and current (specifically, it causes a phase shift), but it doesn't directly depend on the voltage itself.\n\nD. The power consumed by the component: Power in an AC circuit is related to both resistance and reactance, but reactance itself doesn't depend on the power consumed.\n\nE. All of the above: Since options A, C, and D aren't primarily correct, this can't be the right answer.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the reactance of a component in an electrical circuit primarily depends on the frequency of the AC signal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
