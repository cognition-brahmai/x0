        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. I have a bag with 100 marbles, half of them are black and the other half are white. So that's 50 black and 50 white marbles. The question is, if I pick two marbles at once without replacement, what's the probability that both of them are black?\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what it means to pick two marbles at once without replacement. I think this means I'm grabbing two marbles simultaneously, without looking, and without putting any back. So, it's not like picking one, noting its color, then picking another. It's both at the same time.\n\nNow, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes would be picking two black marbles, and the total outcomes would be picking any two marbles from the bag.\n\nLet me try to figure out the total number of ways to pick two marbles from 100. I think this is a combination problem, because the order doesn't matter. It doesn't matter which black marble I pick first or second, as long as both are black.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 marbles from 100 is C(100, 2). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(100, 2) = 100! / (2!(100 - 2)!) = (100 \u00d7 99 \u00d7 98!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 98!) = (100 \u00d7 99) / 2 = 4950.\n\nSo, there are 4950 possible pairs of marbles I could pick from the bag.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, I need to find the number of ways to pick 2 black marbles from the 50 black marbles available.\n\nSo, that would be C(50, 2):\n\nC(50, 2) = 50! / (2!(50 - 2)!) = (50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 48!)} = (50 \u00d7 49) / 2 = 1225.\n\nSo, there are 1225 ways to pick 2 black marbles.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both marbles are black is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 1225 / 4950.\n\nLet me simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 25.\n\n1225 \u00f7 25 = 49\n\n4950 \u00f7 25 = 198\n\nSo, it becomes 49/198.\n\nCan this be simplified further? Let's see, 49 is 7 \u00d7 7, and 198 is 2 \u00d7 99, which is 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 33, which is 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 11. So, no common factors between 49 and 198 other than 1. So, 49/198 is the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I could express this as a decimal for better understanding. Let's see:\n\n49 divided by 198 is approximately 0.2475.\n\nSo, the probability is about 0.2475, or 24.75%.\n\nWait a minute, does this make sense? Let's see if there's another way to approach this problem to verify.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the probability of picking one black marble, and then another black marble without replacement.\n\nThe probability of picking the first black marble is 50/100, which is 1/2.\n\nThen, since we don't replace it, there are now 49 black marbles left and 99 marbles in total.\n\nSo, the probability of picking another black marble is 49/99.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both events happening is (1/2) \u00d7 (49/99) = 49/198.\n\nWait, that's the same answer I got earlier. So, that's a good sign. It confirms that 49/198 is indeed the correct probability.\n\nAlternatively, some people might think that since the marbles are picked at once, it's different from picking them sequentially without replacement. But in reality, the probability should be the same because in both cases, you're selecting two marbles without replacement, and the order doesn't matter.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the total number of ways to pick two marbles, which is C(100, 2) = 4950, and the number of ways to pick two black marbles, which is C(50, 2) = 1225, leading again to 1225/4950 = 49/198.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I end up with the same answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. For example, someone might mistakenly think that since the marbles are picked at once, it's a different scenario, but fundamentally, it's still about selecting two marbles without regard to order.\n\nAnother potential mistake could be to think that the probability is (50/100) \u00d7 (50/100) = 1/4, but that would be incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that once a black marble is picked, there's one less black marble and one less total marble for the second pick.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability that both marbles picked at once are black is 49/198, or approximately 24.75%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{49}{198}} \\]"
