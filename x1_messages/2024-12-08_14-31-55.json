        "content": "So the factory produces 250 units every day and operates for 25 days each month. To find out how many units it produces in a year, we need to calculate the monthly production first and then multiply that by the number of months in a year.\n\nFirst, let's find the monthly production:\n\nUnits per day: 250\n\nOperating days per month: 25\n\nSo, monthly production = 250 units/day * 25 days/month\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n250 * 25 = 6,250 units per month\n\nNow, to find the annual production, we need to multiply the monthly production by the number of months in a year. There are 12 months in a year.\n\nAnnual production = monthly production * 12\n\nSo, 6,250 units/month * 12 months/year\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n6,250 * 12 = 75,000 units per year\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 250 units per day times 25 days is indeed 6,250 units per month.\n\nThen, 6,250 units per month times 12 months is 75,000 units per year.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of total days in a year the factory operates.\n\nDays operated per month: 25\n\nMonths in a year: 12\n\nTotal operating days in a year: 25 * 12 = 300 days\n\nThen, units produced per day: 250\n\nSo, total units per year: 250 units/day * 300 days/year = 75,000 units/year\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the annual production directly.\n\nSo, 250 units/day * 25 days/month * 12 months/year = 250 * 25 * 12\n\nLet's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 250 * 25 = 6,250\n\nThen, 6,250 * 12 = 75,000\n\nOr, alternatively, 250 * 25 * 12 = 250 * 300 = 75,000\n\nEither way, we arrive at the same figure.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 75,000 units in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75000} \\]"
