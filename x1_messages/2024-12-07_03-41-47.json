        "content": "So if a restaurant serves 50 meals every hour and it's open for 8 hours each day, first I need to find out how many meals they serve in a day. To do that, I'll multiply the number of meals per hour by the number of hours they're open each day.\n\nSo, 50 meals/hour \u00d7 8 hours/day = 400 meals/day.\n\nNow, to find out how many meals they serve in a week, I need to multiply the daily meal count by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:\n\n400 meals/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 2,800 meals/week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If they serve 50 meals per hour and are open 8 hours a day, that's 400 meals a day. And over 7 days, that would indeed be 2,800 meals.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any days they're closed or anything like that, but the question says they operate 8 hours each day, assuming it's every day of the week. So, no holidays or anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they operate different hours on different days, but the question says \"assuming it operates for 8 hours each day,\" so I think it's safe to assume it's 8 hours every day.\n\nSo, the total number of meals served in a week would be 2,800.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2800} \\]"
