        "content": "Sure! Here are five underwater creatures classified into mammals, fish, and invertebrates:\n\n1. **Mammals:**\n   - **Dolphin:** Dolphins are highly intelligent marine mammals known for their agility and sociable behavior. They breathe air and give birth to live young.\n   - **Whale:** Whales are large marine mammals that include species like the blue whale, the largest animal on Earth. Like dolphins, they are air-breathing and warm-blooded.\n\n2. **Fish:**\n   - **Tuna:** Tuna are fast-swimming predatory fish found in oceans around the world. They are known for their high speed and are important both ecologically and commercially.\n   - **Anglerfish:** Anglerfish are deep-sea dwellers characterized by a bioluminescent lure used to attract prey in the dark depths of the ocean.\n\n3. **Invertebrates:**\n   - **Octopus:** Octopuses are highly intelligent mollusks known for their eight arms and ability to change color and texture for camouflage.\n   - **Jellyfish:** Jellyfish are gelatinous, free-swimming marine animals with a bell-shaped body and trailing tentacles. They are found in all oceans.\n\nThese classifications help us understand the diversity of life in aquatic environments."
