Let me think about this.\n\nI know that Greece has a rich history, and there are several ancient cities that are renowned for their contributions to Western civilization. Athens comes to mind immediately because it's often referred to as the cradle of Western civilization. It's where democracy was first practiced, and it was a center for philosophy with great thinkers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's verify if Athens is still the capital of Greece today. I believe it is. Athens has been the capital of modern Greece since its independence from the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the ancient city that is known as the birthplace of democracy and philosophy and is currently the capital of Greece is Athens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Athens}} \\]"
