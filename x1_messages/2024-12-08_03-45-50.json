        "content": "So there are 100 birds on a tree, and a hunter shoots and kills 10 of them. The question is, how many birds are left on the tree?\n\nAt first glance, it seems like a straightforward subtraction problem: 100 birds minus 10 killed birds equals 90 birds left. But let's think about it more carefully.\n\nWhen a hunter shoots at birds on a tree, it's likely that the sound of the gun would scare the other birds away. So, even if only 10 birds are killed, the remaining birds might fly away out of fear.\n\nTherefore, it's possible that after the hunter shoots, not only are the 10 birds killed, but the rest of the birds fly away. In that case, there might be no birds left on the tree.\n\nAlternatively, if the birds are very calm or don't hear the shot, maybe the remaining 90 birds stay on the tree.\n\nBut considering the typical reaction of birds to gunshots, it's more realistic to assume that the noise would scare them away.\n\nSo, the answer could be that there are 0 birds left on the tree.\n\nWait, but the question says \"how many birds are left on the tree?\" Not \"how many birds are alive.\"\n\nSo, even if the other birds fly away, the 10 dead birds are still on the tree.\n\nTherefore, there would be 10 dead birds left on the tree.\n\nBut perhaps the hunter removes the dead birds. If that's the case, then there might be no birds left on the tree.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify that the hunter removes the dead birds.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the most accurate answer is that there are 10 dead birds left on the tree.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the other birds fly away and the dead ones remain, then it's 10.\n\nBut perhaps some of the other birds don't fly away and stay on the tree.\n\nWait, but the question says \"100 birds on a tree.\" It doesn't specify if they are all in one tree or spread across multiple trees. Assuming they are all on one tree.\n\nAnd \"a hunter shoots and kills 10 of them.\"\n\nSo, if they are all on one tree, and the hunter shoots 10 of them, killing them, it's likely that the sound would scare the others away.\n\nTherefore, after the shooting, the remaining birds, who are not killed, would fly away.\n\nSo, only the 10 dead birds remain on the tree.\n\nUnless, of course, some of the birds are injured but not killed, but the question says \"kills 10 of them,\" so presumably, the other 90 are either flown away or possibly some are injured but not killed.\n\nBut based on the information given, it's safe to assume that after the hunter shoots and kills 10 birds, the remaining 90 fly away, and only the 10 dead birds remain on the tree.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10 birds are left on the tree.\n\nWait, but they are dead. Are dead birds considered \"left on the tree\"?\n\nMaybe the question is worded to imply live birds.\n\nIf that's the case, then the number of live birds left on the tree would be zero, since the remaining 90 would have flown away, and the 10 are dead.\n\nBut the question just says \"how many birds are left on the tree?\" Without specifying alive or dead.\n\nSo, both alive and dead birds could be considered \"left on the tree.\"\n\nBut typically, when we think of birds on a tree, we think of live birds.\n\nHowever, since the question doesn't specify, perhaps the answer is 10 dead birds.\n\nBut maybe the hunter removes the dead birds. If that's the case, then there are 0 birds left on the tree.\n\nBut the question doesn't mention the hunter removing the dead birds, so we can't assume that.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable answer is that there are 10 dead birds left on the tree.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the other birds fly away and only the dead ones remain, then again, 10 birds are left on the tree.\n\nSo, the answer is 10.\n\nWait, but the question is: \"how many birds are left on the tree?\"\n\nIf we consider only live birds, then 0.\n\nIf we consider both live and dead birds, then 10.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 0, assuming that the live birds fly away, and the dead ones are no longer considered \"birds\" in the context of being on the tree.\n\nBut that seems semantics.\n\nI think the most straightforward answer is 0, assuming that the live birds fly away due to the gunshot, and the dead ones are no longer considered \"left on the tree\" in the context of the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dead birds are considered still \"on the tree.\"\n\nIn that case, the answer is 10.\n\nBut considering the common understanding of the phrase \"birds on a tree,\" it likely refers to live birds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.\n\nBut to be precise, the answer depends on whether \"birds\" includes both live and dead birds.\n\nIf \"birds\" implies live birds, then 0.\n\nIf it includes dead birds, then 10.\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify, perhaps the best answer is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
