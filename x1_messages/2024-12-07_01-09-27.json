The expression is:\n\n(4^2 * 3) / (6 - 2)^2 + 7\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the exponentiation and the subtraction inside the parentheses.\n\n4^2 is 16, and 6 - 2 is 4.\n\nSo now the expression becomes:\n\n(16 * 3) / 4^2 + 7\n\nNext, 4^2 is 16.\n\nSo now it's:\n\n(16 * 3) / 16 + 7\n\nNow, I do the multiplication inside the parentheses:\n\n16 * 3 is 48.\n\nSo now it's:\n\n48 / 16 + 7\n\nNow, division:\n\n48 / 16 is 3.\n\nSo now it's:\n\n3 + 7\n\nFinally, addition:\n\n3 + 7 is 10.\n\nSo the final answer is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
