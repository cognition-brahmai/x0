        "content": "Let's see. I have this sequence where each term after the first two is the sum of the previous two terms. The first term is 3 and the second term is 5. I need to find the eighth term.\n\nOkay, so let's list out the terms one by one.\n\nThe first term is given as 3. So, term 1 = 3.\n\nThe second term is given as 5. So, term 2 = 5.\n\nNow, term 3 is the sum of term 1 and term 2, which is 3 + 5 = 8.\n\nTerm 4 is the sum of term 2 and term 3, which is 5 + 8 = 13.\n\nTerm 5 is the sum of term 3 and term 4, which is 8 + 13 = 21.\n\nTerm 6 is the sum of term 4 and term 5, which is 13 + 21 = 34.\n\nTerm 7 is the sum of term 5 and term 6, which is 21 + 34 = 55.\n\nFinally, term 8 is the sum of term 6 and term 7, which is 34 + 55 = 89.\n\nSo, the eighth term in the sequence is 89.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I've got this right. The sequence is defined such that each term is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 3 and 5.\n\nSo:\n\n- Term 1: 3\n\n- Term 2: 5\n\n- Term 3: 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- Term 4: 5 + 8 = 13\n\n- Term 5: 8 + 13 = 21\n\n- Term 6: 13 + 21 = 34\n\n- Term 7: 21 + 34 = 55\n\n- Term 8: 34 + 55 = 89\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could use the general formula for a linear recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for the nth term, but since the sequence is straightforward and I only need the eighth term, listing them out step by step is efficient and less error-prone.\n\nI don't think there's any need for further verification. The answer is clearly 89.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{89} \\]"
