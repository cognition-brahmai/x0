        "content": "The French sculptor who created the iconic Statue of Liberty that stands in New York Harbor is Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi. Born on April 2, 1834, in Colmar, France, Bartholdi was a renowned sculptor known for his large-scale public works. He studied art in Paris and was influenced by the works of famous sculptors such as Fran\u00e7ois Rude and Albert-Eug\u00e8ne Durand.\n\nBartholdi began working on the concept for the Statue of Liberty in the 1860s, envisioning it as a gift from France to the United States to commemorate the centennial of American independence. The statue was designed to symbolize freedom and democracy, with Lady Liberty holding a torch in her right hand and a tablet in her left, inscribed with the date of the American Declaration of Independence.\n\nConstruction of the statue began in France in 1875, with Bartholdi overseeing the work. The statue was completed in France in 1884 and then disassembled and shipped to the United States, where it was reassembled and dedicated on October 28, 1886, on Liberty Island in New York Harbor.\n\nIn addition to the Statue of Liberty, Bartholdi created several other notable public works, including the Suez Canal Lighthouse in Port Said, Egypt, and various monuments and sculptures throughout France. He died on October 4, 1904, in Paris, leaving behind a legacy as one of France's most prominent sculptors of the 19th century.\n\nToday, the Statue of Liberty remains one of the most recognizable symbols of freedom and democracy around the world, attracting millions of visitors each year to Liberty Island. The statue has become an iconic representation of the United States and its values, and Bartholdi's masterpiece continues to inspire people from all walks of life.\n\n**References:**\n\n1.
