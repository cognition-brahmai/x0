        "content": "To design a SQL query that returns the average salary of employees grouped by department, along with the total number of employees in each department, you can use the following approach:\n\n1. **Identify the tables and their relationships:**\n   - `employee` table likely contains employee details including a department identifier.\n   - `department` table contains department details.\n   - `salary` table contains salary information, possibly linked to employees.\n\n2. **Determine the required fields:**\n   - Department name or identifier.\n   - Average salary for each department.\n   - Total number of employees in each department.\n\n3. **Join the necessary tables:**\n   - Join `employee` with `department` using a common department ID.\n   - Join `employee` with `salary` using an employee ID or similar identifier.\n\n4. **Group the results by department:**\n   - Use the GROUP BY clause on the department identifier or name.\n\n5. **Calculate aggregates:**\n   - Use AVG() to calculate the average salary.\n   - Use COUNT() to count the number of employees in each department.\n\nAssuming the following table structures:\n\n- `employee` table:\n  - `emp_id` (primary key)\n  - `emp_name`\n  - `dept_id` (foreign key referencing department.dept_id)\n\n- `department` table:\n  - `dept_id` (primary key)\n  - `dept_name`\n\n- `salary` table:\n  - `salary_id` (primary key)\n  - `emp_id` (foreign key referencing employee.emp_id)\n  - `amount`\n  - `salary_date`\n\nThe SQL query can be constructed as follows:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    d.dept_name,\n    AVG(s.amount) AS avg_salary,\n    COUNT(e.emp_id) AS total_employees\nFROM\n    department d\nJOIN\n    employee e ON d.dept_id = e.dept_id\nJOIN\n    salary s ON e.emp_id = s.emp_id\nGROUP BY\n    d.dept_name;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Selecting Columns:**\n   - `d.dept_name`: Department name from the department table.\n   - `AVG(s.amount) AS avg_salary`: Average salary from the salary table.\n   - `COUNT(e.emp_id) AS total_employees`: Count of employees in each department.\n\n2. **Joining Tables:**\n   - Join `department` (aliased as `d`) with `employee` (aliased as `e`) on `dept_id`.\n   - Join `employee` with `salary` (aliased as `s`) on `emp_id`.\n\n3. **Grouping:**\n   - Group the results by `dept_name` to get department-wise averages and counts.\n\nThis query assumes that each employee has multiple salary entries over time, and the average is calculated over all salary entries per employee. If you need the average of the latest salary or salary per specific period, additional conditions or subqueries might be necessary."
