        "content": "Let's see. There are 45 people going on a trip that's 600 miles long, and they have to choose between a bus and a van for transportation. The bus can hold 50 passengers and gets 6 miles per gallon, while the van holds 15 passengers and gets 18 miles per gallon. Fuel costs $3 per gallon, and we need to find out the total fuel cost for each option.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which vehicle(s) they would use in each scenario.\n\nFor the bus:\n\n- The bus can hold 50 passengers, which is more than enough for the 45 people. So, they would only need one bus.\n\n- The bus gets 6 miles per gallon, and the trip is 600 miles.\n\n- So, the amount of fuel needed for the bus would be 600 miles divided by 6 miles per gallon, which is 100 gallons.\n\n- At $3 per gallon, the total fuel cost would be 100 gallons * $3/gallon = $300.\n\nFor the van:\n\n- The van can hold 15 passengers.\n\n- Since there are 45 people, they would need 45 / 15 = 3 vans.\n\n- Each van gets 18 miles per gallon, and the trip is 600 miles.\n\n- So, the fuel needed per van is 600 miles / 18 miles per gallon = approximately 33.33 gallons per van.\n\n- For 3 vans, the total fuel needed would be 3 * 33.33 gallons = 99.99 gallons, which we can round to 100 gallons.\n\n- At $3 per gallon, the total fuel cost would be 100 gallons * $3/gallon = $300.\n\nWait a minute, both options come out to $300 in fuel costs. Is that right?\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nFor the bus:\n\n- 600 miles / 6 mpg = 100 gallons.\n\n- 100 gallons * $3/gallon = $300.\n\nFor the van:\n\n- Each van: 600 miles / 18 mpg = 33.33 gallons.\n\n- 3 vans: 3 * 33.33 = 99.99 gallons, which rounds to 100 gallons.\n\n- 100 gallons * $3/gallon = $300.\n\nHmm, so according to these calculations, the fuel cost is the same for both options.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps there are other factors to consider, like the number of vehicles or the efficiency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that the vans would need exactly 33.33 gallons each. Let's think about it differently.\n\nIf each van can hold 15 passengers and gets 18 mpg, then for 45 people, they need 3 vans, as calculated earlier.\n\nEach van doing the 600-mile trip would consume 600 / 18 = 33.33 gallons, times 3 vans is 100 gallons, costing $300.\n\nFor the bus, it's straightforward: one bus for all 45 people, needing 100 gallons, costing $300.\n\nSo, based on fuel costs alone, there's no difference between the two options.\n\nBut perhaps there are other costs to consider, like maintenance or driver costs, but since those aren't mentioned, I guess we can stick with fuel costs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vans could make multiple trips, but with the bus having enough capacity for all 45 people, it's more efficient in terms of fuel.\n\nWait, but according to the calculations, both options use the same amount of fuel and cost the same.\n\nLet me see if there's another approach.\n\nSuppose the vans were to make multiple trips to transport all 45 people.\n\nEach van holds 15 passengers, so to transport 45 people, they would need 3 vans in one trip.\n\nAlternatively, they could use one van for three separate trips, each carrying 15 passengers.\n\nBut that would mean each van makes three trips of 600 miles each.\n\nThat seems inefficient, as it would triple the distance traveled by each van.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. The problem states that the group has 45 members, and they need to travel 600 miles, so presumably, they would all travel together in one trip.\n\nTherefore, they would need either one bus or three vans to transport everyone at once.\n\nGiven that, the fuel calculations stand as $300 for both options.\n\nAlternatively, if they use the vans in multiple trips, the total fuel consumption would increase, making it more expensive.\n\nFor example, if they use one van to make three separate trips, each van would travel 600 miles three times, totaling 1800 miles per van.\n\nFuel consumption would be 1800 miles / 18 mpg = 100 gallons per van.\n\nAt $3 per gallon, that's $300 per van.\n\nWith three vans, that would be $900 in total, which is more expensive than the bus option.\n\nTherefore, it's more economical to use one bus or three vans in a single trip, both costing $300 in fuel.\n\nBut wait, three vans in one trip also cost $300 in fuel, same as the bus.\n\nHowever, the bus can carry all 45 people in one go, while the vans need three separate vehicles.\n\nMaybe there are other considerations, like driver costs or vehicle availability, but since the question only asks for fuel costs, and both options come out to $300, that must be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the assumption that three vans would consume the same amount of fuel as the bus.\n\nLet me recalculate.\n\nBus:\n\n- One bus for 45 people: 600 miles / 6 mpg = 100 gallons * $3 = $300.\n\nVans:\n\n- Three vans, each carrying 15 people: each van 600 miles / 18 mpg = 33.33 gallons.\n\n- Total fuel for three vans: 3 * 33.33 = 100 gallons * $3 = $300.\n\nYes, the fuel cost is the same for both options.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of fuel for each option is $300.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
