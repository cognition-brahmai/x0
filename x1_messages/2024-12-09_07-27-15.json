        "content": "Let's see. So, there's a group of friends who went out for dinner and they decided to split the bill evenly. But there was a mistake in the bill; they were charged for an extra meal that none of them ordered. The total bill came to $180, and each person's share, including the extra meal, was $30. I need to find out how many friends were in the group.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. I need to find the number of friends in the group. Let's denote the number of friends as \\( n \\).\n\nGiven that the total bill is $180 and each person's share is $30, including the extra meal, I can set up an equation to relate these quantities.\n\nSince they split the bill evenly, the total bill divided by the number of friends should equal each person's share:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{180}{n} = 30\n\\]\n\nWait, but there's an extra meal included in the bill that no one ordered. So, the total bill includes the cost of this extra meal. If we let the cost of one meal be \\( m \\), then the total bill should be equal to the cost of the meals ordered by the friends plus the cost of the extra meal.\n\nLet\u2019s think about it differently. If there are \\( n \\) friends, and each ordered one meal, the total cost should be \\( n \\times m \\), where \\( m \\) is the cost per meal. But since there was an extra meal charged, the total bill is actually \\( (n + 1) \\times m = 180 \\).\n\nAlso, each person's share, including the extra meal, is $30. So, the total bill divided by the number of friends is $30:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{180}{n} = 30\n\\]\n\nFrom this equation, I can solve for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{180}{30} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 6 friends in the group.\n\nBut wait, let me check if this makes sense. If there are 6 friends, and the total bill is $180, then each person pays $30, which includes the extra meal. But I need to confirm if the extra meal is accounted for correctly.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the extra meal is one additional meal, so the total number of meals paid for is \\( n + 1 = 7 \\) meals. The cost per meal would then be:\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{180}{n + 1} = \\frac{180}{7} \\approx 25.71\n\\]\n\nBut actually, I don't need to find the cost per meal to determine the number of friends. The initial approach seems sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the total bill being divided among the friends, including the extra meal's cost.\n\nEach friend pays $30, and there are \\( n \\) friends, so:\n\n\\[\nn \\times 30 = 180\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{180}{30} = 6\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that there are 6 friends in the group.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this problem to ensure I'm not missing anything.\n\nSuppose the cost of each meal is \\( m \\), and there are \\( n \\) friends. The total cost should be \\( n \\times m \\), but due to the extra meal, it's \\( (n + 1) \\times m = 180 \\).\n\nEach friend pays $30, so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(n + 1) \\times m}{n} = 30\n\\]\n\nBut I have two variables here, \\( n \\) and \\( m \\), and only one equation, which makes it seem like I need another equation to solve for both variables.\n\nHowever, from the first equation:\n\n\\[\n(n + 1) \\times m = 180\n\\]\n\nAnd from the second equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(n + 1) \\times m}{n} = 30\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{180}{n} = 30\n\\]\n\nWhich again gives:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{180}{30} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, whether I approach it directly or through setting up equations with variables, I arrive at the same conclusion that there are 6 friends in the group.\n\nTo double-check, let's assume there are 6 friends. The total bill is $180, and each pays $30. So, 6 friends paying $30 each total $180. The extra meal is included in that total, meaning that the cost of 7 meals is $180, since the extra meal is one additional meal beyond what the 6 friends ordered.\n\nThus, each meal costs \\( \\frac{180}{7} \\approx 25.71 \\) dollars, but since the question only asks for the number of friends, and I've consistently arrived at 6 through different methods, I'm confident that the answer is 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
