        "content": "So I've got this question about the Amazon Rainforest. It says that the Amazon Rainforest is a big tropical rainforest in South America, covering most of the Amazon basin. The basin is about 7 million square kilometers, and out of that, 5.5 million square kilometers are covered by the rainforest. It spans across nine different countries and covers 3.4% of the world's total surface area. The majority is in Brazil, which has 60% of the rainforest, followed by Peru with 13%, and then some minor amounts in other countries.\n\nThe question is asking which country has the second largest portion of the Amazon Rainforest. The options are:\n\nA. Colombia\n\nB. Venezuela\n\nC. Bolivia\n\nD. Peru\n\nFrom the information provided, it mentions that after Brazil with 60% and Peru with 13%, there are minor amounts in other countries. So, Peru is listed with 13%, and then it says \"minor amounts in other countries.\" That suggests that Peru has the second largest portion.\n\nBut let's double-check. The question is asking for the second largest portion, and it's giving options that include Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Peru.\n\nGiven that Brazil has 60%, and Peru has 13%, it's likely that Peru is second, but maybe one of the other countries has a larger share than Peru.\n\nLet me see. I know that the Amazon Rainforest covers parts of several South American countries, including Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana.\n\nThe information provided states that Brazil has 60% and Peru has 13%, and the rest are minor amounts. So, probably, Colombia, Venezuela, and Bolivia have smaller portions than Peru.\n\nBut to be sure, I can look up the approximate percentages for each country.\n\nBrazil: 60%\n\nPeru: 13%\n\nColombia: around 10%\n\nVenezuela: around 4%\n\nBolivia: around 8%\n\nEcuador: around 5%\n\nGuyana, Suriname, and French Guiana have smaller portions.\n\nSo, based on this, Peru has 13%, Colombia has around 10%, Bolivia has around 8%, and Venezuela has around 4%. Therefore, Peru has the second largest portion after Brazil.\n\nBut wait, the information provided in the question says that after Brazil and Peru, there are minor amounts in other countries. So, probably, Peru is second, and then the other countries have smaller portions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Peru.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"which country has the second largest portion of the Amazon Rainforest?\" and the options include Peru, which is listed as 13%, and the others have smaller percentages.\n\nSo, yes, Peru should be the second largest.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider the options:\n\nA. Colombia - approximately 10%\n\nB. Venezuela - approximately 4%\n\nC. Bolivia - approximately 8%\n\nD. Peru - 13%\n\nSo, in descending order: Brazil (60%), Peru (13%), Colombia (10%), Bolivia (8%), Venezuela (4%), and so on.\n\nTherefore, Peru is indeed the second largest.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Peru.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
