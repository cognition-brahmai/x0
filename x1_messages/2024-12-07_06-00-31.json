        "content": "So there are 50 people in the room. 30% of them wear glasses, and 40% have brown hair. And we're told that there are no other correlations between these characteristics, which I think means that having glasses and having brown hair are independent events.\n\nFirst, I'll find out how many people wear glasses. 30% of 50 people is:\n\n0.30 * 50 = 15 people wear glasses.\n\nNext, 40% of 50 people have brown hair:\n\n0.40 * 50 = 20 people have brown hair.\n\nNow, to find out how many people have both glasses and brown hair, since the characteristics are independent, I can multiply the probabilities.\n\nSo, the probability of having glasses and brown hair is:\n\n0.30 * 0.40 = 0.12, or 12% of the people.\n\nThen, 12% of 50 people is:\n\n0.12 * 50 = 6 people.\n\nTherefore, 6 people have both glasses and brown hair.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if independence is assumed here. The question says \"there are no other correlations between these characteristics,\" which suggests that having glasses doesn't affect the probability of having brown hair, and vice versa. So, independence seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use the inclusion-exclusion principle, the total number of people with either glasses or brown hair or both would be:\n\nNumber with glasses + number with brown hair - number with both.\n\nBut since we're not given the total with either, and we're told to assume no correlations beyond what's given, sticking with independence seems appropriate.\n\nSo, my final answer is 6 people have both glasses and brown hair.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
