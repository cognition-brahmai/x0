        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of friends who want to buy a $120 gift, and they're trying to split the cost equally among themselves. If three more friends join, each person would pay $4 less. We need to find out how many friends were originally in the group.\n\nFirst, let's define the original number of friends as \\( n \\). So, each of them would pay \\( \\frac{120}{n} \\) dollars.\n\nNow, if three more friends join, the number of friends becomes \\( n + 3 \\), and each person would pay \\( \\frac{120}{n + 3} \\) dollars.\n\nAccording to the problem, when three more friends join, each person pays $4 less. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120}{n} - \\frac{120}{n + 3} = 4\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to solve for \\( n \\).\n\nFirst, let's find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side. The common denominator of \\( n \\) and \\( n + 3 \\) is \\( n(n + 3) \\). So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120(n + 3) - 120n}{n(n + 3)} = 4\n\\]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n\\[\n120(n + 3) - 120n = 120n + 360 - 120n = 360\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{360}{n(n + 3)} = 4\n\\]\n\nNow, we can solve for \\( n \\) by isolating it. First, multiply both sides by \\( n(n + 3) \\):\n\n\\[\n360 = 4n(n + 3)\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\n90 = n(n + 3)\n\\]\n\nNow, expand the right side:\n\n\\[\n90 = n^2 + 3n\n\\]\n\nBring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 3n - 90 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to solve this quadratic equation for \\( n \\). We can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nIn this equation, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 3 \\), and \\( c = -90 \\). Plugging these values in:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4(1)(-90)}}{2(1)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 360}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{369}}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, \\( \\sqrt{369} \\) is approximately 19.22, since \\( 19^2 = 361 \\) and \\( 20^2 = 400 \\). So:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-3 \\pm 19.22}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two potential solutions:\n\n1. \\( n = \\frac{-3 + 19.22}{2} = \\frac{16.22}{2} = 8.11 \\)\n\n2. \\( n = \\frac{-3 - 19.22}{2} = \\frac{-22.22}{2} = -11.11 \\)\n\nHowever, the number of friends can't be a fraction or negative, so neither of these solutions makes sense in the context of the problem. It seems like there might have been a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the steps.\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120}{n} - \\frac{120}{n + 3} = 4\n\\]\n\nCombining the fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120(n + 3) - 120n}{n(n + 3)} = 4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying numerator:\n\n\\[\n120n + 360 - 120n = 360\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{360}{n(n + 3)} = 4\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\n360 = 4n(n + 3)\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\n90 = n(n + 3)\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 3n - 90 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, solving the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 360}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{369}}{2}\n\\]\n\nWait, \\( \\sqrt{369} \\) is indeed approximately 19.22, but perhaps I should keep it in radical form for more precision.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor the quadratic equation.\n\nLet's try factoring:\n\nWe need two numbers that multiply to -90 and add up to 3.\n\nPossible factor pairs of -90:\n\n- 1 and -90\n\n- 2 and -45\n\n- 3 and -30\n\n- 5 and -18\n\n- 6 and -15\n\n- 9 and -10\n\nLooking for a pair that adds up to 3.\n\n9 + (-10) = -1, not 3.\n\n6 + (-15) = -9, not 3.\n\n5 + (-18) = -13, not 3.\n\n3 + (-30) = -27, not 3.\n\n2 + (-45) = -43, not 3.\n\n1 + (-90) = -89, not 3.\n\nHmm, none of these add up to 3. Maybe I need to consider fractions, but since n has to be a whole number, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects an integer solution, so maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider possible integer values for n that divide 120, since the cost per person must be a divisor of 120.\n\nPossible divisors of 120: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.\n\nNow, we need to find n such that when 3 is added, the cost per person decreases by $4.\n\nLet me try n = 5.\n\nOriginal cost per person: 120 / 5 = $24.\n\nWith 3 more friends: n + 3 = 8.\n\nNew cost per person: 120 / 8 = $15.\n\nDifference: 24 - 15 = $9, which is more than $4.\n\nNot matching.\n\nTry n = 6.\n\nOriginal: 120 / 6 = $20.\n\nWith 3 more: n + 3 = 9.\n\nNew: 120 / 9 \u2248 $13.33.\n\nDifference: 20 - 13.33 \u2248 $6.67, still more than $4.\n\nNot matching.\n\nn = 7.\n\nOriginal: 120 / 7 \u2248 $17.14.\n\nWith 3 more: n + 3 = 10.\n\nNew: 120 / 10 = $12.\n\nDifference: 17.14 - 12 = $5.14, still more than $4.\n\nn = 8.\n\nOriginal: 120 / 8 = $15.\n\nWith 3 more: n + 3 = 11.\n\nNew: 120 / 11 \u2248 $10.91.\n\nDifference: 15 - 10.91 \u2248 $4.09, close but not exactly $4.\n\nn = 9.\n\nOriginal: 120 / 9 \u2248 $13.33.\n\nWith 3 more: n + 3 = 12.\n\nNew: 120 / 12 = $10.\n\nDifference: 13.33 - 10 = $3.33, less than $4.\n\nSo, n = 8 gives a difference of approximately $4.09, which is close but not exact. Maybe the problem expects n = 8, considering rounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to set up the equation differently.\n\nLet me go back to the original equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120}{n} - \\frac{120}{n + 3} = 4\n\\]\n\nI'll solve it again carefully.\n\nFirst, find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120(n + 3) - 120n}{n(n + 3)} = 4\n\\]\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n\\[\n120n + 360 - 120n = 360\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{360}{n(n + 3)} = 4\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\n360 = 4n(n + 3)\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\n90 = n(n + 3)\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 3n - 90 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, solving the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 360}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{369}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\sqrt{369} \\) is not a perfect square, n is not an integer. But the number of friends should be a whole number.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup or in the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects n to be 8, considering the closest integer value.\n\nSo, the original number of friends is approximately 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
