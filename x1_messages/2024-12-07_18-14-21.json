It was commonly used in thermometers due to its unique properties, such as its ability to expand and contract uniformly with temperature changes and its visibility as a silvery liquid. However, mercury is indeed toxic, and its use in thermometers has been phased out in favor of safer alternatives like alcohol or digital thermometers."
