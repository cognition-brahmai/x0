        "content": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 1, we'll apply the rules of differentiation step by step. Differentiation is a fundamental concept in calculus that allows us to find the rate at which a function is changing at any given point. The derivative of a function gives us the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph at that point.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Understand the function:**\n   The given function is a polynomial: f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 1.\n\n2. **Apply the power rule:**\n   The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, where n is any real number, then the derivative f'(x) = n*x^(n-1).\n\n   We'll apply this rule to each term in the polynomial.\n\n3. **Differentiate each term:**\n   - For the first term, x^3:\n     Using the power rule, the derivative is 3*x^(3-1) = 3x^2.\n\n   - For the second term, -4x^2:\n     The derivative is -4 * 2*x^(2-1) = -8x.\n\n   - For the third term, 6x:\n     The derivative is 6 * 1*x^(1-1) = 6.\n\n   - For the constant term, -1:\n     The derivative of a constant is always 0.\n\n4. **Combine the derivatives of all terms:**\n   f'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 6.\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 1 is f'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 6.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify the function to be differentiated: f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 1.\n\n- **Step 2:** Recall the power rule for differentiation: If f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n*x^(n-1).\n\n- **Step 3:** Apply the power rule to each term in the polynomial:\n\n  - For x^3: n = 3 \u2192 f'(x) = 3*x^(2) = 3x^2.\n\n  - For -4x^2: n = 2 \u2192 f'(x) = -4*2*x^(1) = -8x.\n\n  - For 6x: n = 1 \u2192 f'(x) = 6*1*x^(0) = 6.\n\n  - For -1: n = 0 \u2192 f'(x) = 0.\n\n- **Step 4:** Sum the derivatives of all terms to get the final derivative:\n\n  f'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 6.\n\nThis is the derivative of the given function."
