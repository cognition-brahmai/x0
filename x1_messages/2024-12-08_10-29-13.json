        "content": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. The expression we have is (9 / 3 * 2)^2 - 6 * (4 - 1). Okay, so first things first, I need to remember the order of operations. I think it's PEMDAS or something like that. Parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division from left to right, and addition and subtraction from left to right. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses. There are two sets here: (9 / 3 * 2) and (4 - 1). Let's solve the inner parentheses first. (4 - 1) is straightforward; that's just 3. So now the expression becomes (9 / 3 * 2)^2 - 6 * 3.\n\nNext, I need to handle the division and multiplication inside the first parentheses. According to PEMDAS, division and multiplication have the same precedence, so I should perform them from left to right. So, 9 divided by 3 is 3, and then 3 multiplied by 2 is 6. So, (9 / 3 * 2) simplifies to 6. Now the expression is 6^2 - 6 * 3.\n\nNow, exponents come next. 6 squared is 36. So now it's 36 - 6 * 3.\n\nThen, multiplication and division from left to right. 6 multiplied by 3 is 18. So now it's 36 - 18.\n\nFinally, subtraction: 36 minus 18 equals 18.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 18.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I missed something. Let's go through it again.\n\nStarting with (9 / 3 * 2)^2 - 6 * (4 - 1).\n\nFirst, solve the parentheses:\n\n(4 - 1) = 3.\n\nNow, (9 / 3 * 2). Division and multiplication are equal, so left to right:\n\n9 / 3 = 3.\n\n3 * 2 = 6.\n\nSo, (6)^2 - 6 * 3.\n\n6 squared is 36.\n\nThen, 6 * 3 = 18.\n\n36 - 18 = 18.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent. I think 18 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
