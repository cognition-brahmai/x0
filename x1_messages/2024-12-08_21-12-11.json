The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width})\n\\]\n\nGiven that the garden measures 30 feet in length and 20 feet in width, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (30 \\text{ feet} + 20 \\text{ feet}) = 2 \\times 50 \\text{ feet} = 100 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, 100 feet of fencing will be needed to enclose the entire garden."
