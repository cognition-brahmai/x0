        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a bag with 5 red balls and 7 blue balls, making a total of 12 balls. I need to find the probability that if I pick two balls at random without replacing the first one, both of them are red.\n\nAlright, first things first. Probability is all about finding the chance of something happening. In this case, the chance that both balls I pick are red.\n\nI remember that when you don't replace the first ball, the events are dependent. That means the outcome of the first pick affects the outcome of the second pick.\n\nSo, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find the probability of picking a red ball on the first draw.\n\nThere are 5 red balls out of a total of 12 balls, so the probability is 5/12.\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, since I'm not replacing the first ball, the total number of balls left in the bag is 11, and the number of red balls left is 4.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red ball on the second draw, given that the first one was red, is 4/11.\n\nAlright, now I need to find the probability that both events happen: the first ball is red AND the second ball is red.\n\nSince these are dependent events, I need to multiply the probability of the first event by the probability of the second event given that the first one occurred.\n\nSo, that would be (5/12) multiplied by (4/11).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n5/12 * 4/11 = (5*4)/(12*11) = 20/132.\n\nNow, I can simplify that fraction.\n\nBoth 20 and 132 are divisible by 4.\n\n20 divided by 4 is 5, and 132 divided by 4 is 33.\n\nSo, 5/33.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are red is 5/33.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem to confirm?\n\nYeah, I can use combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 12 is C(12,2), which is 12 choose 2.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to pick 2 red balls out of 5 is C(5,2).\n\nSo, the probability should be C(5,2)/C(12,2).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nC(5,2) = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!) = (5*4*3!) / (2*1 * 3*)) = (20) / 2 = 10.\n\nC(12,2) = 12! / (2! * 10!) = (12*11*10!) / (2*1 * 10!)) = (132) / 2 = 66.\n\nSo, probability is 10/66, which simplifies to 5/33.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier result.\n\nGood, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability sequentially.\n\nThe probability of drawing a red ball first is 5/12.\n\nThen, given that the first ball was red, the probability of drawing another red ball is 4/11.\n\nMultiplying them gives 5/12 * 4/11 = 20/132 = 5/33.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now.\n\nSo, the final answer is 5/33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{33}} \\]"
