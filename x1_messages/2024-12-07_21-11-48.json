        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a box containing red balls and green balls, and we're told that if we pick two balls at random without replacement, the probability of getting two red balls is 1/3. We need to find the minimum number of balls in the box that satisfies this condition.\n\nFirst, let's denote the total number of balls in the box as \\(n\\), and the number of red balls as \\(r\\). The probability of picking two red balls without replacement is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{two red balls}) = \\frac{r}{n} \\times \\frac{r - 1}{n - 1} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest possible integer value of \\(n\\) that makes this equation true for some integer \\(r\\) (since the number of balls must be whole numbers).\n\nLet's rearrange the equation to make it easier to work with:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r(r - 1)}{n(n - 1)} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[\n3r(r - 1) = n(n - 1)\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find integer values of \\(n\\) and \\(r\\) that satisfy this equation, with \\(r \\leq n\\), since you can't have more red balls than total balls.\n\nTo find the minimal \\(n\\), we can start by testing small values of \\(n\\) and see if they yield an integer value for \\(r\\).\n\nLet's try \\(n = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n3r(r - 1) = 2(1) \\implies 3r^2 - 3r - 2 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for \\(r\\):\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 24}}{6} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{33}}{6}\n\\]\n\nThis doesn't give an integer value for \\(r\\), so \\(n = 2\\) is not possible.\n\nNext, \\(n = 3\\):\n\n\\[\n3r(r - 1) = 3(2) \\implies 3r^2 - 3r - 6 = 0 \\implies r^2 - r - 2 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(r\\):\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm 3}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives \\(r = 2\\) or \\(r = -1\\). Since the number of balls can't be negative, \\(r = 2\\). So, with \\(n = 3\\) and \\(r = 2\\), the probability is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nThis satisfies the condition. But is this the minimal \\(n\\)? Let's check \\(n = 1\\) to be thorough.\n\nFor \\(n = 1\\):\n\nIf there's only one ball, you can't pick two balls. So, \\(n = 1\\) is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of balls in the box is 3, with 2 red balls.\n\nWait a minute, let's see if there's a smaller \\(n\\) that works. We already checked \\(n = 2\\) and it didn't yield an integer \\(r\\), and \\(n = 1\\) is invalid. So, \\(n = 3\\) seems to be the smallest possible.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's check \\(n = 4\\) to see if there's a smaller \\(n\\) that also satisfies the condition.\n\nFor \\(n = 4\\):\n\n\\[\n3r(r - 1) = 4(3) \\implies 3r^2 - 3r - 12 = 0 \\implies r^2 - r - 4 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(r\\):\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 16}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{17}}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis doesn't give an integer \\(r\\), so \\(n = 4\\) is not valid.\n\nSimilarly, \\(n = 5\\):\n\n\\[\n3r(r - 1) = 5(4) \\implies 3r^2 - 3r - 20 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(r\\):\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 240}}{6} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{249}}{6}\n\\]\n\nAgain, not an integer.\n\nSo, it seems that \\(n = 3\\) with \\(r = 2\\) is indeed the minimal solution.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about the problem in terms of combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 red balls is \\( \\binom{r}{2} \\), and the total number of ways to choose any 2 balls is \\( \\binom{n}{2} \\). So, the probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\binom{r}{2}}{\\binom{n}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{r(r - 1)}{2}}{\\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}} = \\frac{r(r - 1)}{n(n - 1)} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nThis is consistent with our earlier equation.\n\nTo ensure that \\(n = 3\\) is indeed the minimal solution, let's consider that for \\(n < 3\\), either \\(n = 1\\) or \\(n = 2\\), and we've already seen that only \\(n = 3\\) yields an integer \\(r\\).\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of balls in the box is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
