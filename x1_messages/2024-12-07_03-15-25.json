His most famous work is indeed the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City, which he painted between 1508 and 1512. The frescoes on the ceiling, including the iconic scene of \"The Creation of Adam,\" are some of the most recognizable artworks in the world. Michelangelo's talent extended beyond painting; he was also celebrated for his sculptures, such as \"David\" and \"Piet\u00e0,\" and his architectural contributions to St. Peter's Basilica. His work had a profound influence on the development of Western art."
