I exist solely to process and generate text based on the input I receive. So, I can't tell the difference between the smell of a rose and a jasmine flower. However, I can tell you that roses generally have a sweet, fruity fragrance, while jasmine has a more floral, heady scent. But again, this is just based on textual descriptions, not actual sensory experience."
