        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 machines in the factory, but only 3 can operate at the same time due to power limitations. Each machine produces 100 widgets per hour. The factory needs to produce a total of 1500 widgets. I need to find out how long it will take to produce these 1500 widgets with only 3 machines operating at any given time.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the production rate when 3 machines are operating. Since each machine produces 100 widgets per hour, 3 machines would produce 3 times 100, which is 300 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, to find out how many hours are needed to produce 1500 widgets at a rate of 300 widgets per hour, I can divide the total number of widgets by the hourly production rate.\n\nSo, time required = total widgets / production rate per hour = 1500 / 300 = 5 hours.\n\nWait a minute, but there are 5 machines in total. Does the fact that there are 5 machines affect the time required? I think not, because only 3 can operate at a time due to power limitations. So, even if there are more machines, they can't all operate simultaneously.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if the factory can switch which machines are operating to maximize production. For example, maybe some machines are more efficient or have different production rates, but in this problem, it says each machine produces 100 widgets per hour, so they all have the same rate.\n\nAlso, the problem states that only 3 machines can operate at any given time, so I don't think switching machines would change the production rate.\n\nTherefore, the time required should be 5 hours.\n\nBut let me double-check. If 3 machines are operating, producing 300 widgets per hour, then in 5 hours, they would produce 300 * 5 = 1500 widgets, which is exactly what is needed.\n\nSo, the answer should be 5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
