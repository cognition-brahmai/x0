        "content": "So the train usually goes at 60 km/h, but if it speeds up by 50%, how long will it take to cover 180 km? Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find out what the new speed is after it increases by 50%. Increasing something by 50% means you're adding half of it to itself. So, half of 60 km/h is 30 km/h. Therefore, the new speed is 60 km/h plus 30 km/h, which is 90 km/h.\n\nNow, I need to find out how long it takes to cover 180 km at this new speed. The formula for time when you have distance and speed is:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{180 \\, \\text{km}}{90 \\, \\text{km/h}} \\]\n\nSo, that simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = 2 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. If the train is going faster, it should take less time to cover the same distance, right? Originally, at 60 km/h, the time would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{180 \\, \\text{km}}{60 \\, \\text{km/h}} = 3 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nSo, increasing the speed by 50% to 90 km/h should indeed reduce the time to 2 hours. That seems consistent.\n\nBut let's make sure about the speed calculation. Increasing 60 km/h by 50%:\n\n50% of 60 is indeed 30, so 60 + 30 = 90 km/h. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, you could think of increasing by 50% as multiplying the original speed by 1.5:\n\n\\[ 60 \\, \\text{km/h} \\times 1.5 = 90 \\, \\text{km/h} \\]\n\nSame result.\n\nNow, using the formula for time:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{180 \\, \\text{km}}{90 \\, \\text{km/h}} = 2 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nThat seems straightforward. But maybe I should consider if there are any other factors, like acceleration or anything. The problem just says it increases its speed by 50%, so I think it's safe to assume that the entire journey is at this new constant speed.\n\nAlternatively, if it's accelerating uniformly, the average speed would be different, but the problem seems to imply a constant speed increase, so probably not necessary to consider acceleration.\n\nAnother way to think about it: if the speed is increased by 50%, the time should decrease by what factor? Since speed and time are inversely proportional for a given distance, increasing speed by 50% (i.e., multiplying by 1.5) should decrease time by the factor of 1.5, or divide time by 1.5.\n\nSo, original time is 3 hours, divided by 1.5, which is indeed 2 hours.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the units. Distance is in kilometers, speed in kilometers per hour, so time should be in hours, which it is.\n\nAlternatively, if needed, we could convert the time into minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours would be 120 minutes. But the question doesn't specify units, so hours should be fine.\n\nAlso, if the train increases its speed instantly to 90 km/h and maintains that speed, then the time calculated is correct.\n\nI don't think there's any need to consider relativistic effects or anything like that, as we're dealing with everyday speeds.\n\nSo, the answer should be 2 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
