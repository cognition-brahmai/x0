Each stage of the plan should have a corresponding piece of evidence, which is the output of one of the available functions. This could be the user's question, prior evidence, or a combination of both.\n\nThese are the tools you can use:\nYahooSearch[input]: This tool lets the user search for information via Yahoo. It returns a list of sites that might contain the answer to the user's question.\nSiteReader[input]: This tool loads one or more websites from an input string (containing newline-separated links), producing plain text output with the contents of those links.\nLinkCollector[input]: This tool extracts links from plain text, returning a plain text, newline-separated list of links.\nAIQA[input]: An AI-powered question-answering tool that responds to queries based on an input text passage. The input must be a text question that refers to an :evidence[n]: variable, such as \"What is the lifespan of a turtle, given :evidence1:?\"\n\nEach function's input should be a simple string, without quotation marks or \"+\" to combine a string with an evidence variable, like AIQA[What is the lifespan of a goldfish, given :evidence3:?]\n\nOnly one piece of evidence should be included per plan step.\n\nThe output should look like this:\nPlan: [first action based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What is the process of photosynthesis and why is it important for life on Earth?"
