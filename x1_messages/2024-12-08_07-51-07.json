        "content": "So I have this problem here: I've got a stack of 20 books, and each book is 3 cm thick. I need to find out how tall the whole stack is. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have 20 books, and each one is 3 cm thick. If I stack them all up, how high will the stack be? It seems like I need to find the total height of the stack by adding up the thickness of each book.\n\nNow, since all the books are the same thickness, I can use multiplication to make this easier. Multiplication is basically repeated addition, right? So, if each book is 3 cm thick, and there are 20 books, I can multiply the number of books by the thickness of each book to get the total height.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal height = number of books \u00d7 thickness per book\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal height = 20 \u00d7 3 cm\n\nNow, 20 multiplied by 3 is 60. So, the total height should be 60 cm.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Maybe there's something else I need to consider, like the cover of the books or anything else that might add extra height.\n\nBut according to the problem, each book is 3 cm thick, and there's no mention of anything extra like covers or anything. So, I think assuming that the thickness includes everything is fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Maybe I can imagine stacking one book at a time and seeing how the height accumulates.\n\nStarting with the first book: height is 3 cm.\n\nSecond book: add another 3 cm, so total is 6 cm.\n\nThird book: add another 3 cm, total is 9 cm.\n\nAnd so on, up to 20 books.\n\nSo, it's like 3 cm added 20 times, which again is 20 multiplied by 3 cm, leading back to 60 cm.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation. Maybe I can try a different approach to confirm.\n\nWhat if I consider the stack as a single unit made up of 20 layers, each layer being 3 cm thick. To find the total height, I sum up the thickness of all layers.\n\nSo, total height = sum of thickness of each layer\n\nSince all layers are equal, it's 3 cm + 3 cm + ... + 3 cm (20 times), which again is 20 \u00d7 3 cm = 60 cm.\n\nAlternatively, I could use division to see how many 3 cm units are in the total height, but that doesn't make much sense in this context because I know the number of books and their individual thickness, and I need to find the total height.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about proportions. If 1 book is 3 cm, then 20 books would be 20 times that.\n\nSo, 1 book: 3 cm\n\n20 books: 20 \u00d7 3 cm = 60 cm\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility that the books might not be stacked directly on top of each other or if there's any space between them, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. So, I'll assume that the books are perfectly stacked, one on top of the other, with no extra space between them.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the bottom book might be resting on a surface, which could affect the total height measured from the ground, but I think the question is probably referring to the height of the stack itself, not including any surface it's resting on.\n\nSo, sticking with the straightforward approach, total height should be 20 books times 3 cm per book, which is 60 cm.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can try using addition to add up the thicknesses:\n\n3 cm + 3 cm + 3 cm + ... + 3 cm (20 times)\n\nAdding them sequentially:\n\n3 + 3 = 6\n\n6 + 3 = 9\n\n9 + 3 = 12\n\n12 + 3 = 15\n\n15 + 3 = 18\n\n18 + 3 = 21\n\n21 + 3 = 24\n\n24 + 3 = 27\n\n27 + 3 = 30\n\n30 + 3 = 33\n\n33 + 3 = 36\n\n36 + 3 = 39\n\n39 + 3 = 42\n\n42 + 3 = 45\n\n45 + 3 = 48\n\n48 + 3 = 51\n\n51 + 3 = 54\n\n54 + 3 = 57\n\n57 + 3 = 60 cm\n\nAgain, 60 cm. That matches my previous calculations.\n\nAlternatively, if I know that multiplication is just repeated addition, and I've added 3 cm twenty times, that's the same as 20 times 3 cm, which is 60 cm.\n\nSo, no matter which way I look at it, the total height of the stack is 60 cm.\n\nI think I've confirmed this sufficiently. There doesn't seem to be any trick or additional considerations in the problem. It's a straightforward multiplication problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60 \\text{ cm}} \\]"
