        "content": "So there's this problem about two trains leaving from different towns and heading towards each other. Town A and Town B are 450 miles apart. One train leaves Town A going at 60 miles per hour, and the other leaves Town B going at 90 miles per hour. I need to figure out how long it will take for them to meet.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the situation. I have Town A and Town B, 450 miles apart. Train A is leaving Town A going towards Town B at 60 mph, and Train B is leaving Town B going towards Town A at 90 mph. They're moving towards each other, so their speeds will add up relative to each other.\n\nSo, the combined speed is 60 mph + 90 mph = 150 mph. That means together, they're closing the distance between them at a rate of 150 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the total distance they need to cover before they meet is 450 miles. So, time equals distance divided by speed. So, time = 450 miles / 150 mph.\n\nLet me calculate that: 450 divided by 150 is 3. So, it should take 3 hours for them to meet.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nAnother way is to think about how far each train travels in a given time and set up an equation where the sum of the distances equals 450 miles.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time as t hours.\n\nDistance covered by Train A in t hours is 60t miles.\n\nDistance covered by Train B in t hours is 90t miles.\n\nWhen they meet, the sum of these distances should be equal to the total distance between the towns, which is 450 miles.\n\nSo, 60t + 90t = 450.\n\nCombining like terms, that's 150t = 450.\n\nNow, solving for t: t = 450 / 150 = 3 hours.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using relative speed concepts.\n\nIf two objects are moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So, again, 60 mph + 90 mph = 150 mph.\n\nThen, time to meet would be the total distance divided by the relative speed, which is 450 miles / 150 mph = 3 hours.\n\nAlright, every approach I take leads me to the same answer: 3 hours.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let's think about it in terms of each train's position over time.\n\nAfter 1 hour, Train A has traveled 60 miles from Town A, and Train B has traveled 90 miles from Town B. So, the remaining distance between them is 450 - 60 - 90 = 300 miles.\n\nAfter 2 hours, Train A has traveled 120 miles, Train B has traveled 180 miles, so the remaining distance is 450 - 120 - 180 = 150 miles.\n\nAfter 3 hours, Train A has traveled 180 miles, Train B has traveled 270 miles. 180 + 270 = 450 miles, so they should have met by now.\n\nWait, 180 + 270 is actually 450, which is the total distance. So, yes, they meet after 3 hours.\n\nWhat if I consider the ratio of their speeds? Could that give me any insight?\n\nTrain A is going at 60 mph, Train B at 90 mph. The ratio of their speeds is 60:90, which simplifies to 2:3.\n\nThat means for every 2 miles Train A travels, Train B travels 3 miles in the same time.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly in this problem, since I'm more interested in the time it takes for them to cover the total distance together.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how much closer they get to each other every hour.\n\nSince Train A is going at 60 mph and Train B at 90 mph towards each other, every hour they close the gap by 60 + 90 = 150 miles.\n\nSo, to cover 450 miles, it would take 450 / 150 = 3 hours.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\nMaybe I can also think about it from the perspective of one train or the other.\n\nLet's pick Train A. From Train A's perspective, it's moving at 60 mph, and Train B is approaching it at 90 mph.\n\nSo, from Train A's frame of reference, Train B is moving towards it at 90 mph, and Train A is moving at 60 mph, but since they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is still 150 mph.\n\nAgain, time = distance / relative speed = 450 / 150 = 3 hours.\n\nAlternatively, from Train B's perspective, Train A is approaching it at 60 mph, and Train B is moving at 90 mph towards Train A, so again, relative speed is 150 mph, and time is 450 / 150 = 3 hours.\n\nIt seems no matter how I look at it, the answer is consistently 3 hours.\n\nPerhaps I can consider the distance each train travels in that time to confirm.\n\nIn 3 hours, Train A travels 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles.\n\nTrain B travels 90 mph * 3 hours = 270 miles.\n\nTotal distance covered: 180 + 270 = 450 miles, which matches the distance between the towns.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nI think I've covered all angles here, and I'm confident that the answer is 3 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
