        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to implement an LRU cache in Python. I need to create a cache that has a fixed size, and when it fills up, it should evict the least recently used item to make space for new items. I've heard about LRU caches before, but I'm not entirely sure how they work under the hood. I think I need to use some kind of data structure that allows me to keep track of the order in which items are accessed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what LRU means. LRU stands for Least Recently Used, which is a caching strategy where the least recently accessed item is removed to make space when the cache reaches its capacity. So, in other words, the items that are used more frequently should stay in the cache, while the ones that haven't been used in a while get evicted first.\n\nOkay, so I need to design a cache that can store a certain number of items, and whenever a new item is added and the cache is full, it should remove the least recently used item. Also, I need to make sure that accessing an item marks it as recently used, so it shouldn't be evicted immediately after accessing it.\n\nI think I need to choose appropriate data structures to implement this. I need something that allows me to quickly add and remove items, as well as keep track of the order in which they were accessed.\n\nOne idea is to use a dictionary to store the items, where the keys are the item identifiers and the values are the items themselves. Dictionaries in Python provide O(1) lookup time, which is great for a cache.\n\nBut, I also need to keep track of the order in which items are accessed. Maybe I can use a list to maintain the order of access. Every time an item is accessed or added, I can move it to the end of the list, indicating that it was recently used. Then, when the cache is full and a new item needs to be added, I can remove the item from the front of the list, as it would be the least recently used.\n\nWait, but lists in Python aren't the most efficient for this purpose because inserting and removing from the front is O(n), which isn't ideal for a cache that could have frequent operations.\n\nI recall that Python has a built-in module called `collections`, which contains a data structure called `OrderedDict`. An OrderedDict is a dictionary subclass that remembers the order in which items were inserted. It seems perfect for implementing an LRU cache because it maintains the order of items based on when they were inserted or accessed.\n\nLet me look up the documentation for OrderedDict to see if it can help me with this implementation.\n\nOkay, so OrderedDict allows me to keep track of the order of insertion, and it also provides methods to move an item to the end when it's accessed, which is exactly what I need for the LRU policy.\n\nHere's what I plan to do:\n\n1. Use an OrderedDict to store the items in the cache. The keys will be the item identifiers, and the values will be the items themselves.\n\n2. Set a maximum size for the cache.\n\n3. When an item is accessed (either read or written), I'll move it to the end of the OrderedDict to mark it as recently used.\n\n4. When a new item is added and the cache is full, I'll remove the first item in the OrderedDict, which is the least recently used item.\n\nThis seems straightforward. Let me try to outline the methods I need to implement:\n\n- `get(key)`: Retrieve the value associated with the given key. If the key exists, move it to the end of the OrderedDict to mark it as recently used. If the key doesn't exist, return None.\n\n- `put(key, value)`: Add a new item with the given key and value. If the key already exists, update its value and move it to the end. If the cache is full, remove the least recently used item (the first item in the OrderedDict) before adding the new item.\n\nI should also consider what happens when trying to add a null key or other edge cases, but for now, I'll stick to the basic functionality.\n\nLet me try to write some pseudocode to see how this would work.\n\nPseudocode:\n\nclass LRUCache:\n\ndef __init__(self, capacity):\n\nself.cache = OrderedDict()\n\nself.capacity = capacity\n\ndef get(self, key):\n\nif key in self.cache:\n\n# Move the key to the end to mark as recently used\n\nself.cache.move_to_end(key)\n\nreturn self.cache[key]\n\nelse:\n\nreturn None\n\ndef put(self, key, value):\n\nif key in self.cache:\n\n# Update the value and move to the end\n\nself.cache.move_to_end(key)\n\nself.cache[key] = value\n\nelse:\n\nif len(self.cache) >= self.capacity:\n\n# Remove the least recently used item (first item)\n\nself.cache.popitem(last=False)\n\nself.cache[key] = value\n\nThis looks pretty good. Now, I need to test this logic to make sure it works as expected.\n\nLet's say I create an LRUCache with a capacity of 2.\n\ncache = LRUCache(2)\n\nThen I add items:\n\ncache.put(1, 'a')\n\ncache.put(2, 'b')\n\nNow, the cache contains {1: 'a', 2: 'b'}\n\nIf I access cache.get(1), it should return 'a' and move 1 to the end, so the order is now {2: 'b', 1: 'a'}\n\nThen, if I add cache.put(3, 'c'), since the cache is full, it should evict the least recently used item, which is 2, and add 3, so the cache becomes {1: 'a', 3: 'c'}\n\nIf I access cache.get(2), it shouldn't exist, so it should return None.\n\nIf I access cache.get(1), it should return 'a' and move 1 to the end, making the order {3: 'c', 1: 'a'}\n\nThen, if I add cache.put(4, 'd'), the cache is full again, so it should evict the least recently used item, which is 3, and add 4, resulting in {1: 'a', 4: 'd'}\n\nThis seems to be working correctly.\n\nWait a minute, in the standard library, OrderedDict has a `move_to_end` method, which is perfect for this purpose.\n\nI should also consider the time complexity. Since OrderedDict allows O(1) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and moving to end, this should be efficient enough for a cache implementation.\n\nBut, I should note that in Python 3.7 and later, regular dictionaries also maintain insertion order, and have a `move_to_end` method. So, perhaps I can use a regular dictionary instead of OrderedDict for this implementation.\n\nLet me check the documentation for Python 3.7 dictionaries.\n\nYes, starting from Python 3.7, dictionaries maintain insertion order, and they have `move_to_end` and `popitem` methods, similar to OrderedDict.\n\nSo, in Python 3.7 and later, I can use a regular dictionary for this implementation, which might be more efficient in terms of space.\n\nHowever, since the behavior of maintaining insertion order is officially guaranteed only from Python 3.7 onwards, if I want my code to be compatible with earlier versions, I should stick with OrderedDict.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with OrderedDict to ensure compatibility.\n\nLet me try to write the actual code based on the pseudocode I have.\n\nCode:\n\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\nclass LRUCache:\n\ndef __init__(self, capacity: int):\n\nself.cache = OrderedDict()\n\nself.capacity = capacity\n\ndef get(self, key: int) -> int:\n\nif key in self.cache:\n\n# Move the key to the end to mark as recently used\n\nself.cache.move_to_end(key)\n\nreturn self.cache[key]\n\nelse:\n\nreturn -1  # As per conventional implementation, return -1 if key not found\n\ndef put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:\n\nif key in self.cache:\n\n# Update the value and move to the end\n\nself.cache.move_to_end(key)\n\nself.cache[key] = value\n\nelse:\n\nif len(self.cache) >= self.capacity:\n\n# Remove the least recently used item (first item)\n\nself.cache.popitem(last=False)\n\nself.cache[key] = value\n\nI think this should work. Let me test this implementation with some examples.\n\nTest Case 1:\n\ncache = LRUCache(2)\n\ncache.put(1, 1)\n\ncache.put(2, 2)\n\nprint(cache.get(1)) # returns 1\n\ncache.put(3, 3) # evicts key 2\n\nprint(cache.get(2)) # returns -1\n\ncache.put(4, 4) # evicts key 1\n\nprint(cache.get(1)) # returns -1\n\nprint(cache.get(3)) # returns 3\n\nprint(cache.get(4)) # returns 4\n\nTest Case 2:\n\ncache = LRUCache(1)\n\ncache.put(2, 1)\n\nprint(cache.get(2)) # returns 1\n\ncache.put(3, 2) # evicts key 2\n\nprint(cache.get(2)) # returns -1\n\ncache.put(4, 3) # evicts key 3\n\nprint(cache.get(3)) # returns -1\n\nprint(cache.get(4)) # returns 3\n\nThese test cases seem to cover basic scenarios of insertion, access, and eviction.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, such as:\n\n- Adding a key that already exists (should update the value and mark it as recently used)\n\n- Getting a key that doesn't exist (should return -1)\n\n- Creating a cache with capacity 0 (though it's invalid, but need to handle it gracefully)\n\n- Sequentially filling the cache and evicting items correctly\n\nI should also think about the time and space complexity.\n\nTime Complexity:\n\n- get operation: O(1), since dictionary access is O(1)\n\n- put operation: O(1), since inserting and deleting from OrderedDict is O(1)\n\nSpace Complexity:\n\n- O(capacity), since the cache can hold up to 'capacity' items.\n\nI think this implementation is efficient and meets the requirements.\n\nAnother consideration is thread-safety. If multiple threads are accessing the cache concurrently, this implementation may not be thread-safe. But for simplicity, I'll assume single-threaded access for now.\n\nAlso, I might want to add some methods like `size()` to return the current number of items in the cache, but it's not necessary for the basic functionality.\n\nI should also think about how to handle cases where the capacity is changed dynamically, but that's beyond the scope of this implementation.\n\nOverall, I think this should work fine.\n\nLet me try to implement this code and run some tests to verify.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache in Python, we can make use of the `OrderedDict` from the `collections` module, which maintains the order of elements based on the order of insertion and access. Here's how you can create an LRU cache with a fixed size and ensure that the least recently used item is evicted when the cache becomes full.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Use of OrderedDict**: The `OrderedDict` helps in maintaining the order of elements. When an item is accessed or added, it is moved to the end, indicating that it was recently used.\n2. **get Operation**: If the key exists, return the value and move the key to the end of the OrderedDict.\n3. **put Operation**: If the key already exists, update its value and move it to the end. If the cache is full, remove the least recently used item (the first item in the OrderedDict) and add the new item.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\nclass LRUCache:\n    def __init__(self, capacity: int):\n        self.cache = OrderedDict()\n        self.capacity = capacity\n\n    def get(self, key: int) -> int:\n        if key in self.cache:\n            # Move the key to the end to mark as recently used\n            self.cache.move_to_end(key)\n            return self.cache[key]\n        else:\n            return -1  # Conventional return value for cache miss\n\n    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:\n        if key in self.cache:\n            # Update the value and move to the end\n            self.cache.move_to_end(key)\n            self.cache[key] = value\n        else:\n            if len(self.cache) >= self.capacity:\n                # Remove the least recently used item (first item)\n                self.cache.popitem(last=False)\n            self.cache[key] = value\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Initialization**: The `LRUCache` class is initialized with a fixed `capacity`, and an OrderedDict is used to store cache items.\n- **get Operation**: \n  - If the key is found in the cache, it is moved to the end of the OrderedDict to indicate recent access and its value is returned.\n  - If the key is not found, `-1` is returned to indicate a cache miss.\n- **put Operation**:\n  - If the key already exists, its value is updated, and it is moved to the end of the OrderedDict.\n  - If the key does not exist and the cache has reached its capacity, the least recently used item (the first item in the OrderedDict) is evicted.\n  - The new key-value pair is then added to the cache.\n\nThis implementation ensures efficient cache operations with O(1) time complexity for both get and put operations, making it suitable for scenarios requiring fast data access and limited storage."
