        "content": "So I've got this cylindrical container, right? It has a radius of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm. I need to figure out how much water it can hold, and they want the answer in liters. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the formula for the volume of a cylinder. I think it's V equals pi times the radius squared times the height. Yeah, that sounds right. So, V = \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h. Given that the radius r is 5 cm and the height h is 10 cm, I can plug those values into the formula.\n\nLet me calculate that. Pi is approximately 3.1416. So, V = 3.1416 * (5 cm)\u00b2 * 10 cm. First, square the radius: 5 squared is 25. Then, multiply by pi: 3.1416 * 25 is 78.54 cm\u00b2. Finally, multiply by the height: 78.54 cm\u00b2 * 10 cm = 785.4 cm\u00b3.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the volume in liters, not cubic centimeters. I need to convert cubic centimeters to liters. I recall that 1 liter is equal to 1000 cubic centimeters. So, to find the volume in liters, I should divide the volume in cubic centimeters by 1000.\n\nSo, 785.4 cm\u00b3 divided by 1000 equals 0.7854 liters.\n\nTherefore, the cylindrical container can hold 0.7854 liters of water.\n\nBut maybe I should check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through it again.\n\nStarting with the formula: V = \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h.\n\nPlugging in the values: V = 3.1416 * (5 cm)\u00b2 * 10 cm.\n\nCalculate the square of the radius: 5\u00b2 = 25 cm\u00b2.\n\nMultiply by pi: 3.1416 * 25 = 78.54 cm\u00b2.\n\nThen multiply by the height: 78.54 cm\u00b2 * 10 cm = 785.4 cm\u00b3.\n\nConvert to liters: 785.4 cm\u00b3 / 1000 = 0.7854 liters.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this problem. For example, I could think about the area of the base of the cylinder and then multiply by the height. The base is a circle with radius 5 cm, so the area is \u03c0 * r\u00b2, which is again 78.54 cm\u00b2. Then multiplying by the height gives the same volume of 785.4 cm\u00b3, which converts to 0.7854 liters.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the volume of a cylinder in terms of the diameter, but since I have the radius, it's easier to use the radius formula.\n\nI should also consider significant figures. The given values are 5 cm and 10 cm, which have two significant figures. So, maybe I should round my answer to two significant figures as well. 0.7854 liters rounded to two significant figures is 0.79 liters.\n\nBut let's check the precision of the given data. The radius is 5 cm, which could be considered having one significant figure, but perhaps it's precise to two significant figures. The height is 10 cm, which has two significant figures if the zero is significant. Assuming that, I'll keep my answer to two significant figures.\n\nTherefore, the container can hold approximately 0.79 liters of water.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should use a more precise value of pi. Let's try using 3.1415926535 instead of 3.1416.\n\nSo, V = 3.1415926535 * 25 cm\u00b2 * 10 cm = 785.3981634 cm\u00b3.\n\nDivide by 1000 to get liters: 0.7853981634 liters.\n\nRounded to two decimal places, that's 0.79 liters.\n\nAlternatively, if I use fractions, pi is approximately 22/7, so V = (22/7) * 25 * 10 = 5500/7 \u2248 785.7142857 cm\u00b3, which is about 0.7857 liters, or 0.79 liters when rounded.\n\nRegardless of the method, I'm getting approximately 0.79 liters.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed, like the thickness of the container walls or anything like that. But since it's a theoretical problem and no such information is provided, I don't think that's necessary.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. All measurements are in centimeters, and I've converted cubic centimeters to liters correctly.\n\nSo, final answer: the cylindrical container can hold approximately 0.79 liters of water.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.79 \\text{ liters}} \\]\n"
