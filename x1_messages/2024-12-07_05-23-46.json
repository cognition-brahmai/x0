        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a restaurant that offers pizzas in 3 different sizes with 10 different toppings, and customers can choose up to 3 toppings for their pizza. I need to figure out how many different pizza combinations are possible. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, there are 3 sizes: let's say small, medium, and large. And then there are 10 toppings to choose from, but customers can pick up to 3 toppings. That means they could choose no toppings, one topping, two toppings, or three toppings.\n\nSo, I need to consider all possible combinations of toppings and then multiply that by the number of sizes.\n\nLet me start by figuring out how many ways to choose the toppings.\n\nThe number of ways to choose k toppings out of 10 is given by the combination formula C(10, k), which is 10 choose k.\n\nSo, for no toppings, that's C(10, 0) = 1.\n\nFor one topping, C(10, 1) = 10.\n\nFor two toppings, C(10, 2) = 45.\n\nFor three toppings, C(10, 3) = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check those calculations.\n\nC(10, 0) = 1, that's straightforward.\n\nC(10, 1) = 10, also straightforward.\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 * 9)/2 = 45, yeah.\n\nC(10, 3) = (10 * 9 * 8)/(3 * 2 * 1) = 120, that's correct.\n\nSo, total number of topping combinations is 1 + 10 + 45 + 120 = 176.\n\nNow, since there are 3 sizes, and for each size, you can have any of these 176 topping combinations, the total number of different pizzas would be 3 times 176, which is 528.\n\nWait a minute, but let me think again. Is there any restriction on the number of toppings per size or anything like that? The problem says \"customers can choose up to 3 toppings for their pizza,\" and there are 3 sizes available.\n\nSo, yes, each size can have any of the 176 topping combinations.\n\nTherefore, total combinations = number of sizes * number of topping combinations = 3 * 176 = 528.\n\nBut, let me consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as for each topping, the customer can choose to include it or not, up to a maximum of 3 toppings.\n\nBut since there's a limit of up to 3 toppings, I think the way I did it initially is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if there was no limit on the number of toppings, then it would be 2^10 for the toppings, but since there's a limit of 3, I have to sum C(10,0) + C(10,1) + C(10,2) + C(10,3) = 176, as I did.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 528 is the correct total number of different pizza combinations.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if order matters in toppings. Does it matter if you put pepperoni first and then mushrooms, or mushrooms first and then pepperoni? I don't think the order matters; it's just the combination that matters.\n\nSo, combinations are appropriate here, not permutations.\n\nAlso, since you can't have the same topping multiple times, it's without replacement.\n\nSo, yes, C(10, k) is the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem allowed for multiple servings of the same topping, that would be different, but it doesn't specify that, so I think combinations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 528 different pizza combinations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{528} \\]"
