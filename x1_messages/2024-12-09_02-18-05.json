Okay, first things first, I should know how many hours there are in a week.\n\nI know that:\n\n- There are 24 hours in a day.\n\n- And there are 7 days in a week.\n\nSo, to find the total number of hours in a week, I can multiply 24 hours by 7 days.\n\nLet me do that:\n\n24 hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 168 hours/week\n\nSo, there are 168 hours in a week.\n\nNow, if the factory produces 1000 widgets every hour, then in 168 hours, it would produce:\n\n1000 widgets/hour \u00d7 168 hours/week\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n1000 \u00d7 168 = 168,000\n\nSo, the factory produces 168,000 widgets in a week.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, hours in a week:\n\n24 hours/day \u00d7 7 days = 168 hours/week\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nThen, widgets per week:\n\n1000 widgets/hour \u00d7 168 hours/week = 168,000 widgets/week\n\nYes, that looks right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it step by step.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- In one hour: 1000 widgets\n\n- In one day (24 hours): 1000 \u00d7 24 = 24,000 widgets\n\n- In one week (7 days): 24,000 \u00d7 7 = 168,000 widgets\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the units to ensure I'm multiplying correctly.\n\nWidgets per hour multiplied by hours per week gives widgets per week.\n\nSo, 1000 widgets/hour \u00d7 168 hours/week = 168,000 widgets/week.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nI think 168,000 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{168000} \\]"
