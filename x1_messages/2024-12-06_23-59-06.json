        "content": "D. Realism\n\nRealism in international relations theory suggests that states are the main actors in the global political arena and that their behavior is primarily motivated by self-interest and the pursuit of power. This perspective emphasizes the anarchic nature of the international system, where there is no overarching authority above states, leading them to prioritize their own security and power to ensure survival in a competitive environment.\n\nConstructivism, on the other hand, focuses on the role of ideas, norms, and shared beliefs in shaping state behavior and international outcomes. Liberalism emphasizes the role of institutions, interdependence, and cooperation among states to achieve common goals. Marxism applies class struggle and economic determinism to international relations, viewing global politics through the lens of capitalism and class conflict. Therefore, among the options provided, Realism is the theory that posits states as primary actors driven by self-interest and power."
