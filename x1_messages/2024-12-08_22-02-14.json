        "content": "Let's see. There are 120 passengers in total on the train. According to the information, 50% are women, 40% are men, and the remaining are children. I need to find out how many more women there are than men.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the number of women. Since 50% of the passengers are women, I can find that by taking 50% of 120.\n\nNumber of women = 50% of 120 = (50/100) * 120 = 60\n\nNext, the number of men is 40% of the total passengers.\n\nNumber of men = 40% of 120 = (40/100) * 120 = 48\n\nNow, to find out how many more women there are than men, I subtract the number of men from the number of women.\n\nMore women than men = Number of women - Number of men = 60 - 48 = 12\n\nSo, there are 12 more women than men on the train.\n\nWait a minute, the question also mentions that the rest are children. Although it's not directly related to the question of how many more women there are than men, I can still verify if the percentages add up correctly.\n\nThe percentage of children would be 100% - (50% + 40%) = 10%\n\nSo, number of children = 10% of 120 = (10/100) * 120 = 12\n\nAdding them up: women (60) + men (48) + children (12) = 120, which matches the total number of passengers.\n\nEverything seems consistent here. The answer should be 12 more women than men.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
