        "content": "Let's see. So, we have a group of people, and 40% prefer tea, while 70% prefer coffee. Now, the question is asking for the percentage that prefers both tea and coffee.\n\nHmm, this seems like a problem involving sets or maybe Venn diagrams. I remember that when you have two overlapping sets, the total percentage that likes either one or both is the sum of the individual percentages minus the percentage that likes both.\n\nSo, if we let T be the set of people who prefer tea, and C be the set of people who prefer coffee, then the formula for the union of T and C would be:\n\n|T \u222a C| = |T| + |C| - |T \u2229 C|\n\nWhere:\n\n- |T \u222a C| is the percentage that prefers either tea or coffee or both.\n\n- |T| is the percentage that prefers tea, which is 40%.\n\n- |C| is the percentage that prefers coffee, which is 70%.\n\n- |T \u2229 C| is the percentage that prefers both tea and coffee, which is what we're trying to find.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't say anything about people who prefer neither tea nor coffee. If everyone prefers at least one of them, then |T \u222a C| should be 100%.\n\nLet me check that assumption. If everyone prefers either tea or coffee or both, then |T \u222a C| = 100%. So, plugging into the formula:\n\n100% = 40% + 70% - |T \u2229 C|\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n100% = 110% - |T \u2229 C|\n\nSo, |T \u2229 C| = 110% - 100% = 10%\n\nTherefore, 10% of the group prefers both tea and coffee.\n\nBut wait, is it possible that some people prefer neither? The problem says \"a group of people were asked if they prefer tea or coffee\", but it doesn't specify if there are people who prefer neither. Maybe some people don't prefer either tea or coffee.\n\nIf that's the case, then |T \u222a C| might be less than 100%. Let's consider that possibility.\n\nLet\u2019s denote N as the percentage that prefers neither tea nor coffee. Then, the total should be:\n\n|T \u222a C| + N = 100%\n\nUsing the earlier formula:\n\n|T| + |C| - |T \u2229 C| + N = 100%\n\n40% + 70% - |T \u2229 C| + N = 100%\n\n110% - |T \u2229 C| + N = 100%\n\nSo, N = |T \u2229 C| - 10%\n\nNow, since N can't be negative, the smallest possible value for N is 0%, which would occur when |T \u2229 C| = 10%. If |T \u2229 C| were greater than 10%, then N would be positive, meaning some people prefer neither tea nor coffee.\n\nBut the problem doesn't provide information about N, so I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at it differently. Maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nAccording to inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|T \u222a C| = |T| + |C| - |T \u2229 C|\n\nWe know |T| and |C|, but we don't know |T \u222a C| or |T \u2229 C|.\n\nIf we assume that everyone prefers at least one, then |T \u222a C| = 100%, and we can solve for |T \u2229 C| as before, getting 10%.\n\nBut if some people prefer neither, then |T \u222a C| < 100%, and |T \u2229 C| would be larger to account for the overlap.\n\nHowever, without knowing N, I can't determine |T \u2229 C| exactly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the total percentages:\n\n40% prefer tea, 70% prefer coffee.\n\nIf no one preferred both, the total would be 110%, which is impossible since only 100% exists. Therefore, there must be an overlap of at least 10%.\n\nIf some people prefer both, then the overlap increases, and the total |T \u222a C| decreases accordingly.\n\nBut again, without knowing how many prefer neither, I can't find the exact overlap.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem assumes that everyone prefers at least one, tea or coffee.\n\nIf that's the case, then |T \u222a C| = 100%, and we can proceed as before.\n\nIn that case, |T \u2229 C| = |T| + |C| - |T \u222a C| = 40% + 70% - 100% = 10%.\n\nSo, 10% prefer both tea and coffee.\n\nBut I'm still unsure if the problem implies that everyone prefers at least one.\n\nMaybe I should consider that some people might prefer neither, and in that case, the overlap could be more than 10%.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't provide information about people who prefer neither, perhaps the assumption is that everyone prefers at least one.\n\nIn many such problems, if it's not specified, it's often assumed that the union of the sets covers the entire group.\n\nTherefore, I'll proceed with that assumption and conclude that 10% prefer both tea and coffee.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10\\%} \\]"
