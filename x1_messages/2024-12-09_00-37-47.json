        "content": "If one hose takes 8 hours to fill the pool, then four hoses should fill it faster, right? Let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rate at which the hose fills the pool. If one hose takes 8 hours to fill the pool, then its filling rate is the entire pool divided by 8 hours. So, the rate is 1 pool per 8 hours, or 1/8 pool per hour.\n\nNow, if I have four hoses, each filling at a rate of 1/8 pool per hour, then together, their combined rate should be 4 times 1/8, which is 4/8, or 1/2 pool per hour.\n\nSo, if four hoses can fill half the pool in one hour, how long will it take to fill the whole pool? Well, if they fill half the pool in one hour, then to fill the entire pool, it should take 2 hours.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If one hose takes 8 hours, and four hoses are working together, it should indeed be faster. From 8 hours with one hose to 2 hours with four hoses\u2014that seems logical because 8 divided by 4 is 2.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of total work. The total work to fill the pool is 1 pool. The rate of one hose is 1/8 pool per hour. So, for four hoses, the rate is 4 * 1/8 = 1/2 pool per hour. To fill 1 pool at a rate of 1/2 pool per hour, it would take 1 / (1/2) = 2 hours.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that if one hose takes 8 hours, adding more hoses should proportionally decrease the time. So, with four hoses, the time should be divided by 4, which gives 8 / 4 = 2 hours.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor that could affect this. Assuming all hoses have the same flow rate and there are no limitations like the pool's capacity or water pressure issues, then this should hold true.\n\nSo, my final answer is that it would take 2 hours to fill the pool using four hoses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
