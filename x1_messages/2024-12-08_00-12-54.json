        "content": "I'm sorry, but the information you provided contains inaccuracies. Albert Einstein was not a biologist, nor was he born in London, England on April 15, 1880. He is actually a renowned physicist, best known for his theory of relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. Einstein was born in Ulm, W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany on March 14, 1879.\n\nThe discovery of penicillin is attributed to Alexander Fleming, a Scottish biologist and pharmacologist, not Albert Einstein. Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928, which indeed had a profound impact on medicine by introducing the first effective treatment against bacterial infections.\n\nIt's important to ensure that historical facts are accurate to properly acknowledge the contributions of these great scientists. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.\n\nSource: [Biography.com - Albert Einstein](https://www.biography.com/scientist/albert-einstein)\n"
