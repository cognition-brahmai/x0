        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this train that's traveling at different speeds for different amounts of time, and I need to find out how far it goes in total. Okay, first, it travels at 90 km/h for 3 hours, and then it slows down to 60 km/h for another 2 hours. So, I think I need to calculate the distance it covers in each part and then add them together to get the total distance.\n\nAlright, so for the first part, it's going at 90 km/h for 3 hours. I remember that distance is equal to speed multiplied by time. So, distance = speed \u00d7 time. So, for the first part, distance1 = 90 km/h \u00d7 3 h. Let me calculate that: 90 times 3 is 270 km. So, it covers 270 km in the first part.\n\nNow, for the second part, it's going at 60 km/h for 2 hours. So, distance2 = 60 km/h \u00d7 2 h. That's 60 times 2, which is 120 km.\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just need to add distance1 and distance2 together. So, total distance = 270 km + 120 km = 390 km.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. Like, is there any acceleration or something? Oh, no, it's just average speeds given for different time intervals, so I think it's fine to just calculate the distances separately and add them up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the total time traveled and some average speed or something, but I don't think that's necessary here because the speeds are given for specific time intervals.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the total distance traveled by the train is 390 km.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{390} \\]"
