        "content": "Petra is located in Jordan, a Middle Eastern country known for its rich history and archaeological sites. This ancient city, carved into rose-colored sandstone cliffs, was the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom more than 2,000 years ago. It's famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, and it's often referred to as the \"Rose City\" due to the color of the stone from which it is carved. Petra was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1985 and was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2007."
