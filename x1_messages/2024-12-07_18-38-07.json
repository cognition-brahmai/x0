        "content": "So I have this equation to solve: (4x + 2) / 2 = 6. Alright, let's see how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to simplify the left side of the equation. The expression is (4x + 2) divided by 2. I can split this into two separate fractions: 4x/2 + 2/2.\n\nNow, 4x divided by 2 is 2x, and 2 divided by 2 is 1. So, the equation simplifies to 2x + 1 = 6.\n\nNext, I want to isolate the term with x. To do that, I can subtract 1 from both sides of the equation. So, 2x + 1 - 1 = 6 - 1, which simplifies to 2x = 5.\n\nNow, to solve for x, I need to divide both sides by 2. So, 2x / 2 = 5 / 2, which gives me x = 5/2.\n\nLet me check if this is correct. If I plug x = 5/2 back into the original equation, I get (4*(5/2) + 2)/2 = (10 + 2)/2 = 12/2 = 6. Yeah, that matches the right side.\n\nSo, the solution is x = 5/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{2}} \\]"
