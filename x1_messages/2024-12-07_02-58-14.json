The song you're referring to is \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\" The title was inspired by a drawing made by John Lennon's son Julian. According to John, Julian brought home a picture he'd drawn at school and said, \"This is Lucy in the sky with diamonds.\" The drawing featured his schoolfriend Lucy O'Donnell, and John incorporated the phrase into the song's title. This led to some controversy, as the title bears a resemblance to the acronym for the drug LSD, but John consistently maintained that it was simply based on his son's drawing and the name of his friend Lucy."
