        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 20 houses on one side of the street and 15 houses on the other side. Each house has 4 people living in it. Now, half of the people from each house on one side visit a house on the other side. I need to find out how many people will be visiting the other side.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which side is sending visitors to the other. The problem says \"half of the people from each house on one side visit a house on the other side.\" It doesn't specify which side, so I can choose either. Maybe it doesn't matter because the calculation would be the same. Let's assume it's the side with 20 houses.\n\nSo, there are 20 houses, each with 4 people. If half of the people from each house visit the other side, that means 2 people from each house are visiting.\n\nSo, 2 people per house times 20 houses would be 40 people visiting the other side.\n\nWait, but let's double-check that. Maybe I need to consider both sides.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more complex, with people from both sides visiting each other. But the problem says \"from each house on one side visit a house on the other side,\" implying only one side is sending visitors.\n\nBut to be sure, I should consider if it's possible that both sides are sending visitors. However, the problem seems to indicate that only one side is sending visitors, as it says \"from each house on one side visit a house on the other side.\"\n\nSo, sticking with my initial approach: 20 houses, each sending half of its inhabitants, which is 2 people per house, to the other side.\n\nTherefore, 20 houses times 2 people per house equals 40 people visiting the other side.\n\nBut let's consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe the 15 houses are also sending visitors back. But the problem doesn't specify that. It only mentions half of the people from each house on one side visiting the other side.\n\nSo, based on the information given, I think 40 people are visiting the other side.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should calculate the total number of people on both sides first.\n\nTotal people on the first side: 20 houses times 4 people each equals 80 people.\n\nTotal people on the second side: 15 houses times 4 people each equals 60 people.\n\nNow, half of the people from each house on one side visit the other side. So, if it's the first side sending visitors, that's half of 4 people, which is 2 people per house, times 20 houses, which is 40 people.\n\nAlternatively, if it's the second side sending visitors, that's half of 4 people, which is 2 people per house, times 15 houses, which is 30 people.\n\nBut the problem says \"from each house on one side visit a house on the other side.\" It doesn't specify which side, but in my initial approach, I assumed it was the side with 20 houses.\n\nHowever, perhaps I need to consider that it could be either side, and the problem wants a general answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that half of the people from each house on one side visit a house on the other side, but it's the same for both sides. Meaning, both sides are sending visitors.\n\nBut the problem doesn't explicitly say that both sides are sending visitors. It only mentions \"from each house on one side visit a house on the other side.\"\n\nSo, to avoid assuming, I'll stick with my initial calculation: 20 houses, each sending 2 people, totaling 40 people visiting the other side.\n\nAlternatively, if it's the side with 15 houses sending visitors, it would be 15 houses times 2 people per house, equaling 30 people visiting the other side.\n\nBut since the problem says \"from each house on one side visit a house on the other side,\" and doesn't specify which side, perhaps the answer should consider both possibilities.\n\nMaybe the answer is that either 40 or 30 people will be visiting the other side, depending on which side is sending the visitors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume a specific side, but I don't want to make that assumption.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem differently. Maybe it's asking for the total number of people visiting the other side, considering that half from each house on one side are visiting.\n\nIf it's the side with 20 houses, then 20 houses times 2 people per house equals 40 people visiting.\n\nIf it's the side with 15 houses, then 15 houses times 2 people per house equals 30 people visiting.\n\nBut the problem says \"from each house on one side visit a house on the other side,\" which seems to imply that only one side is sending visitors.\n\nTherefore, depending on which side is sending visitors, either 40 or 30 people will be visiting the other side.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that people from both sides are visiting each other, but that would complicate the calculation, and the problem seems to suggest only one side is sending visitors.\n\nSo, to keep it simple, I'll go with my initial answer: 40 people visiting the other side, assuming it's the side with 20 houses.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider that the problem might expect me to consider that it's the side with more houses sending visitors, which is the side with 20 houses, hence 40 people visiting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to trick me into thinking it's only one side, but in reality, it's both sides.\n\nBut the problem clearly states \"from each house on one side visit a house on the other side,\" which indicates only one side is sending visitors.\n\nTherefore, the number of people visiting the other side is 40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
