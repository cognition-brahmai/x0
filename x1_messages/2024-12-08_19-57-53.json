        "content": "So the telecom company is looking to expand its fiber-optic network into some rural areas. They currently cover 1,000 square miles with 500,000 customers. The expansion will add another 2,000 square miles, but these areas have a lower population density\u2014only 100 people per square mile. They\u2019ve got a budget of $50 million for this project, and I need to figure out how many new customers they can serve and what the cost per customer will be.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many new customers they can get from this expansion. To do that, I should calculate the total population in the new area they\u2019re covering.\n\nThe new area is 2,000 square miles, and the population density is 100 people per square mile. So, the total new population would be:\n\nNew population = 2,000 square miles * 100 people/square mile = 200,000 people\n\nNow, assuming that all of these people will sign up for the service, which might not be the case, but based on the information given, I\u2019ll proceed with 200,000 new customers.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost per customer. The total budget for the project is $50 million. To find the cost per customer, I\u2019ll divide the total cost by the number of new customers.\n\nCost per customer = Total cost / Number of new customers\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nCost per customer = $50,000,000 / 200,000 customers = $250 per customer\n\nSo, the company can serve an additional 200,000 customers at a cost of $250 per customer.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there\u2019s more to this. Maybe there\u2019s a need to consider the current customer density to see if the new areas will have similar uptake.\n\nCurrently, they cover 1,000 square miles with 500,000 customers. So, their current customer density is:\n\nCurrent customer density = 500,000 customers / 1,000 square miles = 500 customers per square mile\n\nIn the new area, the population density is 100 people per square mile. If we assume that the uptake rate is similar to the current area, then perhaps not all 100 people per square mile will sign up.\n\nBut the problem doesn\u2019t specify an uptake rate, so maybe it\u2019s safe to assume that all people in the new area will sign up for the service.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company has a certain penetration rate in the current area. Let\u2019s see:\n\nCurrent penetration rate = 500,000 customers / (1,000 square miles * population density)\n\nWait, but I don\u2019t know the population density in the current area. The problem only gives population density for the new area.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company serves 500,000 customers in 1,000 square miles, but I don\u2019t know the total population in that area.\n\nWithout knowing the penetration rate in the current area, it\u2019s challenging to estimate the number of customers in the new area.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the company serves all the people in the areas it covers, assuming full penetration.\n\nIn that case, in the new area, covering 2,000 square miles with 100 people per square mile, the total new population is 200,000 people, and assuming full penetration, all 200,000 will be customers.\n\nTherefore, new customers = 200,000\n\nTotal cost = $50,000,000\n\nCost per customer = $50,000,000 / 200,000 = $250 per customer\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company doesn\u2019t have full penetration in the current area. Maybe not all 500,000 people in the covered area are customers.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, then the penetration rate is:\n\nPenetration rate = 500,000 customers / total population in current area\n\nBut I don\u2019t know the total population in the current area.\n\nWait, I can calculate the total population in the current area if I knew the population density there.\n\nBut the problem only gives the population density for the new area (100 people per square mile). It doesn\u2019t provide the population density for the current area.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the current area has a higher population density, which is why it\u2019s being differentiated from the new rural area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company serves only a certain percentage of the population in the areas it covers.\n\nBut without that information, I\u2019ll stick with the initial assumption that all people in the covered area are customers.\n\nTherefore, new customers = 200,000\n\nCost per customer = $250\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other costs to consider, like the cost of maintaining the existing network. But the problem specifies that the $50 million is the overall budget for the project, which is the expansion. So, I think it\u2019s safe to assume that this cost is solely for the expansion.\n\nTherefore, the total number of new customers is 200,000, and the cost per customer is $250.\n\nBut maybe I should consider that the cost per mile of fiber-optic installation might differ between urban and rural areas. Perhaps rural areas are cheaper due to less congestion and easier access.\n\nBut again, the problem doesn\u2019t provide that information, so I\u2019ll assume that the cost is uniformly distributed based on the area covered and the number of customers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cost is proportional to the area covered.\n\nThe company is expanding from 1,000 to 3,000 square miles, so that\u2019s a 2,000 square mile expansion.\n\nIf the current network of 1,000 square miles serves 500,000 customers, then the cost per square mile for the expansion can be calculated.\n\nBut wait, the company is expanding by 2,000 square miles with a budget of $50 million.\n\nSo, cost per square mile for expansion = $50,000,000 / 2,000 square miles = $25,000 per square mile\n\nBut I already calculated cost per customer as $250. Is there a relationship here?\n\nWell, with 200,000 new customers in 2,000 square miles, that\u2019s 100 customers per square mile.\n\nSo, cost per customer = cost per square mile / customers per square mile\n\n$25,000 per square mile / 100 customers per square mile = $250 per customer\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, it\u2019s consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company has a certain cost structure where the cost per customer is based on the density.\n\nBut given the information provided, my approach seems valid.\n\nTherefore, the total number of new customers is 200,000, and the cost per customer is $250.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200,000 \\text{ new customers at } \\$250 \\text{ per customer}} \\]"
