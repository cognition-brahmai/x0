        "content": "So there's this box with different colored balls: 9 red, 3 blue, and 2 green. The question is, what's the probability of picking a red ball without looking?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability means. Probability is like measuring chances\u2014how likely something is to happen. It's usually expressed as a fraction or a decimal between 0 and 1, where 0 means it'll never happen, and 1 means it's certain to happen.\n\nSo, to find the probability of drawing a red ball, I need to know two things:\n\n1. The total number of red balls.\n\n2. The total number of balls in the box.\n\nFrom the question, there are 9 red balls. And the total number of balls is the sum of red, blue, and green balls. So that's 9 red + 3 blue + 2 green, which equals 14 balls in total.\n\nNow, the probability (P) of drawing a red ball is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. So, P(red) = number of red balls / total number of balls.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: P(red) = 9 / 14.\n\nThat's the simplest form, I think, because 9 and 14 don't have any common factors other than 1.\n\nSo, the probability is 9/14.\n\nBut just to make sure I understand this correctly, let's think about it differently. Suppose I draw one ball from the box. There are 14 possible outcomes, since there are 14 balls. Out of these 14, 9 are red. So, the chance that I pick a red one is 9 out of 14, which is indeed 9/14.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of percentages. To get the percentage chance, I could divide 9 by 14 and multiply by 100. Let's see: 9 divided by 14 is approximately 0.642857, and multiplied by 100 is about 64.29%. So, there's roughly a 64.29% chance of drawing a red ball.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify the format, fractions are usually more precise for probabilities, so I'll stick with 9/14.\n\nJust to explore more, what if I wanted to find the probability of not drawing a red ball? That would be the probability of drawing either a blue or a green ball.\n\nThe number of non-red balls is 3 blue + 2 green = 5 balls.\n\nSo, P(not red) = 5 / 14.\n\nAnd, interestingly, P(red) + P(not red) should equal 1, because those are the only two possibilities.\n\nLet's check: 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1. Perfect, that makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the probability of drawing a red ball is proportional to the number of red balls compared to all the balls.\n\nSo, in a way, the red balls have 9 out of 14 shares in the total possible outcomes.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let's consider if there were more or fewer balls.\n\nSuppose there were 10 red balls and 4 blue balls, total 14 balls. Then P(red) would be 10/14, which is 5/7.\n\nBut in our case, it's 9 red balls out of 14, which can't be simplified further.\n\nSo, 9/14 is the correct probability.\n\nI think that's clear now.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{14}} \\]"
