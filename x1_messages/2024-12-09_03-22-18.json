I need to find out how much money they'll have in the account after 5 years. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the formula for compound interest. The general formula for compound interest is:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this problem, the interest is compounded annually, so n = 1. The principal P is $10,000, the annual interest rate r is 2% which is 0.02 in decimal form, and the time t is 5 years.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, I get:\n\nA = 10000(1 + 0.02/1)^(1*5)\n\nSimplifying inside the parentheses:\n\nA = 10000(1 + 0.02)^5\n\nA = 10000(1.02)^5\n\nNow, I need to calculate 1.02 raised to the power of 5. Let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, 1.02^1 = 1.02\n\n1.02^2 = 1.02 * 1.02 = 1.0404\n\n1.02^3 = 1.0404 * 1.02 = 1.061208\n\n1.02^4 = 1.061208 * 1.02 \u2248 1.08243216\n\n1.02^5 = 1.08243216 * 1.02 \u2248 1.1040808032\n\nSo, A \u2248 10000 * 1.1040808032 \u2248 11040.808032\n\nRounding to the nearest cent, since we're dealing with money, that would be $11,040.81.\n\nLet me double-check that. Another way to calculate compound interest is to apply the interest rate each year successively.\n\nStarting with $10,000.\n\nAfter the first year: $10,000 + (0.02 * $10,000) = $10,000 + $200 = $10,200\n\nAfter the second year: $10,200 + (0.02 * $10,200) = $10,200 + $204 = $10,404\n\nAfter the third year: $10,404 + (0.02 * $10,404) = $10,404 + $208.08 = $10,612.08\n\nAfter the fourth year: $10,612.08 + (0.02 * $10,612.08) = $10,612.08 + $212.2416 \u2248 $10,824.3216\n\nAfter the fifth year: $10,824.3216 + (0.02 * $10,824.3216) = $10,824.3216 + $216.486432 \u2248 $11,040.808032\n\nAgain, rounding to the nearest cent, $11,040.81.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same result. It looks like after 5 years, the account will have $11,040.81.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other way to approach this. Maybe using the simple interest formula and comparing it to compound interest.\n\nThe simple interest formula is I = PRT, where I is the interest, P is the principal, R is the rate, and T is the time.\n\nSo, I = 10000 * 0.02 * 5 = $1,000.\n\nTherefore, the total amount with simple interest would be $10,000 + $1,000 = $11,000.\n\nBut in compound interest, we get $11,040.81, which is a little more because interest is earned on the accumulated interest each year.\n\nSo, yes, compound interest does provide a higher return over time compared to simple interest.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that the more frequently interest is compounded, the higher the final amount will be. But in this case, it's compounded annually, so n = 1.\n\nIf it were compounded quarterly or monthly, the amount would be slightly higher, but according to the problem, it's annually.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any withdrawals or additional deposits. The problem doesn't mention any, so we can assume that the only amount in the account is the initial $10,000 plus the accumulated interest.\n\nLastly, inflation isn't factored into this calculation, so the real value of the money after 5 years might be less than the nominal amount due to inflation, but again, the problem is only asking for the nominal amount in the account, not the real value.\n\nSo, to conclude, after 5 years, the account will have $11,040.81.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11040.81} \\]"
