        "content": "To create a Node.js application that reads a JSON file containing information about books and outputs the titles of all books published before 2000, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up your project:**\n   - Initialize a new Node.js project by creating a directory and running `npm init` to create a `package.json` file.\n   - Install any necessary dependencies. For this task, you won't need additional packages beyond what's included in Node.js core modules.\n\n2. **Create the JSON file:**\n   - Create a JSON file, say `books.json`, that contains an array of book objects with properties like `title`, `author`, and `publicationYear`.\n\n   Example `books.json`:\n   ```json\n   [\n     {\n       \"title\": \"Book One\",\n       \"author\": \"Author A\",\n       \"publicationYear\": 1998\n     },\n     {\n       \"title\": \"Book Two\",\n       \"author\": \"Author B\",\n       \"publicationYear\": 2001\n     },\n     {\n       \"title\": \"Book Three\",\n       \"author\": \"Author C\",\n       \"publicationYear\": 1995\n     }\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. **Write the Node.js script:**\n   - Create a JavaScript file, say `app.js`, that reads the JSON file, parses its content, filters books published before 2000, and logs their titles.\n\n   Example `app.js`:\n   ```javascript\n   const fs = require('fs');\n   const path = require('path');\n\n   // Path to the JSON file\n   const booksPath = path.join(__dirname, 'books.json');\n\n   // Read the JSON file\n   fs.readFile(booksPath, 'utf8', (err, data) => {\n     if (err) {\n       console.error('Error reading file:', err);\n       return;\n     }\n\n     try {\n       // Parse the JSON data\n       const books = JSON.parse(data);\n\n       // Filter books published before 2000\n       const oldBooks = books.filter(book => book.publicationYear < 2000);\n\n       // Output the titles of filtered books\n       oldBooks.forEach(book => {\n         console.log(book.title);\n       });\n     } catch (parseErr) {\n       console.error('Error parsing JSON:', parseErr);\n     }\n   });\n   ```\n\n4. **Run the application:**\n   - Open your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run `node app.js`. This will read the `books.json` file, filter the books published before 2000, and print their titles to the console.\n\nThis simple application demonstrates how to read a file, parse JSON data, filter data based on a condition, and output the results using Node.js."
