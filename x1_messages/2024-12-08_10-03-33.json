        "content": "So, the restaurant serves about 150 customers each day, and on average, each customer spends $25 on their meal. We want to find out how much the restaurant makes in one year, assuming it's open every day.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the daily revenue. That should be the number of customers per day multiplied by the average spending per customer. So, that's 150 customers times $25 per customer.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 150 \u00d7 25.\n\nWell, 150 \u00d7 20 is 3,000, and 150 \u00d7 5 is 750. Adding those together, 3,000 + 750 equals 3,750.\n\nSo, the restaurant makes $3,750 per day.\n\nNow, to find out the annual revenue, I need to multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in a year. There are 365 days in a normal year.\n\nSo, it's $3,750 per day times 365 days.\n\nLet's break that multiplication down to make it easier.\n\nFirst, 3,750 \u00d7 300.\n\n3,750 \u00d7 300 is the same as 3,750 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 100.\n\n3,750 \u00d7 3 is 11,250.\n\nThen, 11,250 \u00d7 100 is 1,125,000.\n\nNext, 3,750 \u00d7 60.\n\n3,750 \u00d7 60 can be calculated as 3,750 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 10.\n\n3,750 \u00d7 6 is 22,500.\n\nThen, 22,500 \u00d7 10 is 225,000.\n\nFinally, 3,750 \u00d7 5.\n\n3,750 \u00d7 5 is 18,750.\n\nNow, I need to add all these parts together: 1,125,000 + 225,000 + 18,750.\n\nFirst, 1,125,000 + 225,000 is 1,350,000.\n\nThen, 1,350,000 + 18,750 is 1,368,750.\n\nSo, the restaurant makes approximately $1,368,750 in one year.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there's a simpler way to do this multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that 365 is 365, and multiply 3,750 by 365 directly.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, 3,750 \u00d7 300 = 1,125,000.\n\nThen, 3,750 \u00d7 60 = 225,000.\n\nAnd 3,750 \u00d7 5 = 18,750.\n\nAdding them up: 1,125,000 + 225,000 = 1,350,000.\n\nThen, 1,350,000 + 18,750 = 1,368,750.\n\nYeah, same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that 365 is 365, and see if there's a smarter way to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that 365 is 400 - 35.\n\nSo, 3,750 \u00d7 400 would be 1,500,000.\n\nThen, 3,750 \u00d7 35 is 131,250.\n\nSubtracting, 1,500,000 - 131,250 = 1,368,750.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nSo, the restaurant makes about $1,368,750 in one year.\n\nBut, I should consider whether there are leap years or not.\n\nSince the question says \"assuming it's open every day,\" and doesn't specify leap years, I'll assume it's a normal 365-day year.\n\nIf it were a leap year with 366 days, the revenue would be slightly higher.\n\nBut based on the information provided, $1,368,750 is the annual revenue.\n\nJust to double-check my calculations:\n\nDaily revenue: 150 customers \u00d7 $25 = $3,750.\n\nAnnual revenue: $3,750 \u00d7 365 = $1,368,750.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1368750} \\]"
