        "content": "So we have a group of 30 people: 10 doctors and 20 engineers. Among the doctors, 6 have PhDs, and among the engineers, 12 have PhDs. We need to find the probability that a randomly selected person is a doctor with a PhD.\n\nFirst, let's understand what probability means. Probability is like figuring out the chances of something happening. It's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcome is selecting a doctor with a PhD, and the total possible outcomes are selecting any one person from the group of 30.\n\nSo, the formula for probability is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} \\]\n\nWe know the total number of possible outcomes is 30 because there are 30 people in the group.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of doctors with PhDs. According to the information, there are 6 doctors with PhDs.\n\nSo, plugging these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{6}{30} \\]\n\nSimplifying this fraction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{6}{30} = \\frac{1}{5} \\]\n\nSo, the probability is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\), which can also be expressed as 0.2 or 20%.\n\nTo make sure this makes sense, let's think about it differently. If we have 30 people and 6 of them are doctors with PhDs, then for every 30 people, we expect 6 to be doctors with PhDs. So, the ratio is 6 to 30, which reduces to 1 to 5, meaning one in every five people is a doctor with a PhD.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the probabilities step by step. First, the probability of selecting a doctor from the group is \\(\\frac{10}{30} = \\frac{1}{3}\\). Then, given that we've selected a doctor, the probability that this doctor has a PhD is \\(\\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}\\). To find the overall probability of both events happening (selecting a doctor and that doctor having a PhD), we multiply the probabilities:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{1 \\times 3}{3 \\times 5} = \\frac{3}{15} = \\frac{1}{5} \\]\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation, which is a good check that we're on the right track.\n\nIt's also interesting to note that there are 12 engineers with PhDs, but since we're only interested in doctors with PhDs, those 12 don't affect our favorable outcomes. However, they do contribute to the total number of people with PhDs in the group. If the question were about selecting someone with a PhD, regardless of whether they're a doctor or an engineer, then we'd add the doctors with PhDs and the engineers with PhDs together: 6 + 12 = 18. So, the probability of selecting someone with a PhD would be \\(\\frac{18}{30} = \\frac{3}{5}\\), or 60%. But that's not what the question is asking.\n\nSo, to summarize, the probability of selecting a doctor with a PhD from the group is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\), or 20%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{5}} \\]"
