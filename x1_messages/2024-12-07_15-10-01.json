        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a town where 60% of the people have dogs, and 40% have cats. Additionally, 25% of the people have both dogs and cats. The question is asking for the percentage of dog owners who also own cats.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked here. It's not just about finding out how many people have both pets, but specifically, what proportion of those who own dogs also own cats. That sounds like a conditional probability problem to me.\n\nIn probability terms, we're looking for the probability that a person owns a cat given that they own a dog. The formula for conditional probability is:\n\nP(Cats | Dogs) = P(Dogs and Cats) / P(Dogs)\n\nWhere:\n\n- P(Cats | Dogs) is the probability of owning a cat given that one owns a dog.\n\n- P(Dogs and Cats) is the probability of owning both dogs and cats.\n\n- P(Dogs) is the probability of owning a dog.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n\n- P(Dogs) = 60% or 0.6\n\n- P(Cats) = 40% or 0.4\n\n- P(Dogs and Cats) = 25% or 0.25\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nP(Cats | Dogs) = 0.25 / 0.6\n\nNow, let's do the division:\n\n0.25 divided by 0.6 equals approximately 0.4167\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n0.4167 * 100 = 41.67%\n\nSo, approximately 41.67% of dog owners also own cats.\n\nWait a minute, does this make sense? Let's double-check our calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nP(Cats | Dogs) = P(Dogs and Cats) / P(Dogs)\n\n= 0.25 / 0.6\n\n= 0.4167\n\nWhich is 41.67%\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about this in terms of Venn diagrams or sets to verify.\n\nLet\u2019s assume there are 100 people in the town for simplicity.\n\n- Number of dog owners: 60% of 100 = 60 people\n\n- Number of cat owners: 40% of 100 = 40 people\n\n- Number of people who own both dogs and cats: 25% of 100 = 25 people\n\nNow, out of the 60 dog owners, 25 also own cats.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of dog owners who also own cats is:\n\n(25 / 60) * 100% = (0.4167) * 100% = 41.67%\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to verify the consistency of the given percentages.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion principle states that:\n\nP(Dogs or Cats) = P(Dogs) + P(Cats) - P(Dogs and Cats)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(Dogs or Cats) = 0.6 + 0.4 - 0.25 = 0.75 or 75%\n\nSo, 75% of the people own either dogs or cats or both.\n\nGiven that, and our earlier calculation, everything seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I recall that in some probability problems, especially with overlapping sets, it's possible for the numbers to be inconsistent if the percentages don't add up correctly. But in this case, it seems fine.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check if the number of people who own both pets is less than or equal to the smaller individual group.\n\nThe number of people who own both dogs and cats is 25%, which is less than both the 40% who own cats and the 60% who own dogs. So, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider only dog owners, which is 60%, and within that group, 25% of the total population owns both dogs and cats. But to find the percentage within dog owners, I need to see what fraction of dog owners also own cats, which we've already calculated as approximately 41.67%.\n\nIs there another way to look at this?\n\nPerhaps using Bayes' theorem, but I think that might be overkill for this problem since we're dealing with straightforward conditional probability.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of proportions.\n\nIf 25% of the population owns both dogs and cats, and 60% owns dogs, then the ratio of both to dog owners is 25/60, which is approximately 41.67%.\n\nThis aligns with our previous calculations.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that approximately 41.67% of dog owners also own cats.\n\nBut, to be precise, maybe I should express it as a fraction.\n\n25 divided by 60 is 5/12, since 25 \u00f7 5 = 5 and 60 \u00f7 5 = 12.\n\nSo, exactly 5/12 of dog owners also own cats.\n\nConverting 5/12 to a decimal: 5 \u00f7 12 = 0.41666..., which is approximately 0.4167 or 41.67%.\n\nSo, whether I use decimals or fractions, I arrive at the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of dog owners who also own cats is approximately 41.67%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{41.67\\%} \\]"
