        "content": "So in this city, there are 500,000 people, and 60% of them own cars. So, to find out how many cars are owned by the residents, I need to calculate 60% of 500,000.\n\nFirst, I should remember that \"percent\" means \"per hundred,\" so 60% is the same as 60 per 100 or 60/100, which is also 0.60 in decimal form.\n\nSo, to find 60% of 500,000, I can multiply 500,000 by 0.60.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of cars = 500,000 \u00d7 0.60\n\nNow, multiplying 500,000 by 0.60.\n\n500,000 times 0.60.\n\nWell, 500,000 times 0.60 is the same as 500,000 times 60 divided by 100.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 500,000 times 6, and then divide by 10.\n\nWait, no, let's see.\n\nActually, 0.60 is 6/10, so 500,000 times 6/10.\n\nThat would be (500,000 \u00d7 6) \u00f7 10.\n\nFirst, 500,000 times 6 is 3,000,000.\n\nThen, divide that by 10, which is 300,000.\n\nSo, the number of cars owned by the residents is 300,000.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if there's any other factor here. For example, does each car owner own only one car? Or could some own multiple cars?\n\nThe question says \"how many cars are owned by the residents,\" and it says \"60% of these people own cars.\" It doesn't specify if these are individual cars or if some people own more than one.\n\nAssuming that each car owner owns exactly one car, then the number of cars would be equal to the number of car owners, which is 300,000.\n\nHowever, in reality, some people might own more than one car. But since the problem doesn't provide any information about multiple car ownership, I think it's safe to assume that each car owner has one car.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 300,000 cars.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother way is to think about the percentage directly.\n\n60% of 500,000 is what?\n\nWell, again, that's 0.60 times 500,000, which is 300,000.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate 50% of 500,000 and then add 10% of 500,000.\n\n50% of 500,000 is 250,000.\n\nWait, no, 50% of 500,000 is actually 250,000.\n\nWait, no, that's not right.\n\nWait, 50% of 500,000 is 250,000.\n\nThen, 10% of 500,000 is 50,000.\n\nSo, 60% would be 50% plus 10%, which is 250,000 plus 50,000, totaling 300,000.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, definitely, the number of cars is 300,000.\n\nJust to be extra sure, maybe I can use a proportion.\n\nIf 100% represents 500,000 people, then 60% represents how many people?\n\nSet up a proportion:\n\n100% / 500,000 = 60% / x\n\nSolve for x:\n\nx = (60% \u00d7 500,000) / 100%\n\nWhich again is 0.60 times 500,000, which is 300,000.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach it, I keep getting 300,000 cars.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 300,000 cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300000} \\]"
