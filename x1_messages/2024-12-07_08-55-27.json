That means 50 people are wearing hats, and 50 are not.\n\nNow, if 10 hat-wearing people leave the room, then we need to subtract those 10 from the original 50 who were wearing hats.\n\nSo, 50 minus 10 equals 40.\n\nTherefore, there are 40 people with hats still remaining in the room.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. Initially, there are 50 hat-wearers and 50 non-hat-wearers. If 10 hat-wearers leave, then the number of hat-wearers left is 50 - 10 = 40.\n\nThe total number of people left in the room would be 100 - 10 = 90. Out of these 90 people, 40 are wearing hats.\n\nSo, the answer should be 40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
