        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, there are 5 cats and 3 dogs in the room. Each cat has 2 kittens, so the number of kittens is 5 cats times 2 kittens per cat, which is 10 kittens. Each dog has 1 puppy, so the number of puppies is 3 dogs times 1 puppy per dog, which is 3 puppies.\n\nNow, the total number of animals initially in the room is the sum of the cats, dogs, kittens, and puppies. That would be 5 cats + 3 dogs + 10 kittens + 3 puppies = 21 animals.\n\nBut then, one of the puppies leaves the room. So, we need to subtract one puppy from the total. That means 21 - 1 = 20 animals remain in the room.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that. Are kittens considered separate from the cats? I think in this context, kittens are offspring of the cats, but they are still cats. Similarly, puppies are offspring of the dogs, but they are still dogs. So, perhaps the initial count should be:\n\n5 adult cats + 10 kitten cats = 15 cats\n\n3 adult dogs + 3 puppy dogs = 6 dogs\n\nTotal animals: 15 cats + 6 dogs = 21 animals\n\nThen, one puppy leaves, which is one dog, so 21 - 1 = 20 animals remain.\n\nAlternatively, if kittens and puppies are considered separate entities from their parents, then the initial count of 21 is correct, and subtracting one puppy still leaves 20 animals.\n\nHmm, but the way the question is phrased, \"each cat has 2 kittens,\" it seems that kittens are separate from the cats, and similarly, puppies are separate from the dogs. So, perhaps the initial count of 21 is accurate.\n\nTherefore, after one puppy leaves, 20 animals remain in the room.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
