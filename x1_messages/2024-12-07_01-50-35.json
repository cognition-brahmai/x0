        "content": "Let's see. The train is going at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, and I need to find out how far it travels in 45 minutes. First, I should probably convert the time from minutes to hours because the speed is in miles per hour.\n\nSo, 45 minutes is 45/60 hours. That simplifies to 0.75 hours. Now, I can use the formula for distance, which is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDistance = 60 miles per hour \u00d7 0.75 hours\n\nMultiplying those together:\n\nDistance = 45 miles\n\nSo, the train will travel 45 miles in 45 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using proportions. If the train travels 60 miles in 60 minutes, how many miles would it travel in 45 minutes?\n\nLet me set up a proportion:\n\n60 miles / 60 minutes = x miles / 45 minutes\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = (60 miles \u00d7 45 minutes) / 60 minutes\n\nSimplifying that:\n\nx = (2700 miles\u00b7minutes) / 60 minutes\n\nThe minutes cancel out:\n\nx = 45 miles\n\nSame answer as before. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, since 45 minutes is 3/4 of an hour, and the train is going at 60 miles per hour, I can think of it as:\n\nDistance = 60 miles per hour \u00d7 3/4 hour = 45 miles\n\nAgain, the same result. It seems like 45 miles is the correct distance the train travels in 45 minutes at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
