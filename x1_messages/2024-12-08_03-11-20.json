        "content": "So the tree produces 200 apples each season, and only 70% of them are good enough to sell. I need to find out how many bad apples that leaves.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many apples are good. If 70% are good, then:\n\nGood apples = 70% of 200\n\nTo calculate that, I can multiply 200 by 0.70:\n\n200 * 0.70 = 140\n\nSo, there are 140 good apples.\n\nNow, to find the bad apples, I subtract the good ones from the total:\n\nBad apples = Total apples - Good apples\n\nBad apples = 200 - 140 = 60\n\nTherefore, the tree produces 60 bad apples each season.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe by calculating the percentage of bad apples directly.\n\nIf 70% are good, then the remaining percentage must be bad:\n\nPercentage of bad apples = 100% - 70% = 30%\n\nThen, I can find 30% of 200 to get the number of bad apples:\n\nBad apples = 30% of 200\n\nWhich is 0.30 * 200 = 60\n\nSame result as before. So, either way, it's 60 bad apples.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can check if these numbers make sense.\n\nIf 70% are good, and 30% are bad, and total apples are 200, then:\n\nGood apples: 140\n\nBad apples: 60\n\nTotal: 140 + 60 = 200, which matches the total number of apples.\n\nAlso, 140 is indeed 70% of 200, since 140 / 200 = 0.70.\n\nAnd 60 is 30% of 200, since 60 / 200 = 0.30.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nSo, the answer is 60 bad apples each season.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
