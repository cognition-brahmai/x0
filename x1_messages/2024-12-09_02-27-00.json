        "content": "In Lewis Carroll's \"Alice in Wonderland,\" Alice first encounters the Cheshire Cat in the forest. During their initial interaction, Alice approaches the cat and starts a conversation by asking for directions or advice on which path to take. The exact wording of her first words to the Cheshire Cat might not be directly quoted in your question, but typically, she might say something like, \"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\" or a similar inquiry seeking guidance through the confusing landscape of Wonderland.\n\nHowever, to provide a precise answer, let's refer to the actual text. In Chapter Six, titled \"Pig and Pepper,\" Alice encounters the Cheshire Cat for the first time. Here is an excerpt from that scene:\n\n---\n\nAlice was getting very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice, 'without pictures or conversations?'\n\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\n\nThere was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.\n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\n\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.\n\n'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)\n\nDown, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! 'I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for remembering them, she thought it would do her good to try.) 'Yes, that's about the right distance\u2014but then I wonder what I shall find at the bottom of it all? Shall I find trees, and flowers, and cats and dogs down here, too? Oh, I think I'll stop and rest a while!' So she sat down on a bright green rackit, and began to think over all she had seen and heard since she had set out that morning. First, there had been the dream about the mouse and the telescope\u2014and she tried to remember what had followed it, but that was difficult, because she was so used to having numerous dreams, that she never could remember them for six consecutive minutes. But, after a while, she went on again: 'And then the mouse, and the rabbit, and\u2014oh, my dear paws! How confusing it all is! I can't keep the various pieces of it together for a moment! How can I remember all the things I've seen today? Let me count: one, two, three, four, five, six. Seven, where did that come from? Four is the rabbit, five is the Mock Turtle, that must be! Six is the Cheshire Cat, and seven\u2014oh dear, I can't go on at this rate! I wonder what would happen if I tried to sing one of my old songs in this place? I'll try, and see; (a little timidly,) 'In Wonderland'\u2014no, that's no use, it's out of date, you know. (After some thought, and trying the first verse of 'Twinkle, twinkle, little bat', which was all wrong, as the text said 'star', not 'bat',) 'How doth the little crocodile'\u2014oh, that's the way the thing seems to come out here\u2014' improve his shining tail, And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale!' How funny it seems to change all the words! (She kept turning round and round as she spoke, to see if she could see herself in the mirror, but though she could see the full-length of herself in the glass, she couldn't see her face, so she went on, talking to herself as well as she could remember, for she had quite a perfect horror of appearing abrupt; whether there was anybody to hear her or not.) 'I wonder if any of the animals down here are never never beasts? Iggy, the Ape, used to read me fairy tales when I was a child, and there was one about the 'Three Little Pigs'. I don't suppose porcupines change into pigs, do they? And again, what are those plural things called, that live in swarms?\u2014I forget their names for the moment\u2014bees, perhaps? Well, perhaps they do, for I can't remember the end of the story: I only know that the third little pig became aBOOLEAN, or something like that, and lived happily ever after.' (After a pause, while she tried to remember more, but without success, she went on again,) 'And then there was the story of 'Alice Through the Looking-Glass', which was a great favourite of mine when I was small. I should like to read it again, but I don't suppose I could find it down here. I wonder if they've got any books in the library? I must ask the Gryphon about that; he seems to know everything, that animal does. I only wish I hadn't missed him at the concert the other night; I should have liked to hear him sing that song about the whiting and the oyster. It must have been something very funny, by the way everybody laughed. I think I'll go and look for him now; perhaps I shall find him in the kitchen.' So, getting up, she brushed the rackit off, and started to look for the kitchen. It wasn't difficult to find, for there was a large door leading into it, with a brass knob in the middle. Alice opened the door and walked in, rather timidly, as she had never been in a kitchen before, except in her dreams. It was a very large kitchen, much larger than any she had ever seen above-ground, and it was full of cooks and scullions, all busily employed in preparing dinner. There was a huge fire in the grate, and over it hung a caldron in which something was boiling, emitting a most delicious odour. Alice stood for a minute or two, watching the cooks stir the contents of the caldron, and wondering what it could be. At last one of the cooks noticed her, and called out, 'Who are you, and what do you want here?' Alice stammered out that she was looking for the Gryphon, and that she wanted to ask him something about the library. The cook sniffed contemptuously, and said, 'The Gryphon! He's not here, and he won't be back till dinner-time. You'd better go away and come back later.' Alice was quite disheartened; she had hoped to find the Gryphon and get some information from him, but it seemed that she would have to wait till dinner-time, which was a long way off, as it was only luncheon-time now. She turned to go out of the kitchen, but before she could reach the door, another cook called out to her, 'Hey, you there! Where do you think you're going?' Alice explained that she was going back to the hall, but the cook insisted on searching her pockets to make sure that she hadn't stolen any of the knives or forks. This was rather humiliating for Alice, but she had to submit to the search, which, however, revealed nothing incriminating. At last the cook allowed her to go, with a final warning to keep away from the kitchen in future. Alice made her way back to the hall, feeling rather cross and disappointed. She sat down on the same green rackit as before, and began to think again. 'What a funny place this is!' she said to herself. 'Everything is so different from what it used to be at home. I wonder if I shall ever get back again. Oh, I do hope so! But how is it all happening? I must have been dreaming, I suppose; but then again, perhaps it's all real, and I'm only dreaming that I used to live in a house with a garden, and go to school, and have lessons. It does seem a long time ago, doesn't it? Well, I must try to make the best of it, anyway. Perhaps if I keep on thinking, I shall remember something useful.' So she went on thinking, and trying to remember things she had learnt in her lessons, but it was very difficult, because everything seemed so mixed up and confused. She tried to recall the multiplication table, but somehow the numbers wouldn't come out right; and when she tried to remember the names of the kings and queens of England, they all got mixed up with the characters in the fairy tales she had read. At last she gave it up in despair, and decided to go and explore some more of the palace. She had hardly taken a few steps when she came to a door with a large brass plate on it, inscribed 'Drawings-room'. 'I wonder what that means?' thought Alice. 'Is it a room where they keep drawings, or where they draw pictures? I suppose the latter; but then, who would be drawing pictures in a palace? Perhaps the King has a hobby for painting, and this is his studio. Well, I might as well go in and see.' So she turned the handle and walked in. The room was dimly lit, with only a few candles burning in sconces on the wall. In the centre of the room was a large easel, with a canvas propped up against it, but the canvas was blank; not a stroke had been put upon it. Around the easel were scattered various artist's materials\u2014pallets, brushes, jars of paint, and so on\u2014but everything was covered with a thick layer of dust, as if nothing had been touched for a long time. Alice walked up to the easel and looked at the blank canvas. 'I declare,' she said to herself, 'this is the queerest place I ever was in! A drawing-room with a blank canvas, and nobody to paint it! I wonder what it's all about.' Just then, she heard a faint whisper behind her, and turning round, she saw a small figure sitting in the shadows, who seemed to be making signs to her to come nearer. Alice approached cautiously, not knowing what to expect. As she drew closer, she saw that it was a little old mouse, dressed in a tiny waistcoat and wearing a pair of spectacles. The mouse beckoned to her to sit down beside him, which Alice did, feeling rather bewildered. 'Well, Alice,' said the mouse in a hoarse whisper, 'I've been watching you for some time, and I think you're in need of some advice.' 'Oh, are you?' said Alice, surprised. 'Who are you, if I might ask?' 'I'm the Mouse,' was the reply. 'I used to belong to the King's menagerie, but I escaped some time ago and have been living wild ever since. I've seen a good deal of this place, and I know most of its secrets.' 'Really?' said Alice, interested. 'Then perhaps you can tell me how to get out of it. I want to go home.' 'Home?' repeated the Mouse, with a sneer. 'What's home to you? A place where you have to obey rules and do as you're told? Bah! You're better off here, where you can do as you please.' 'But I don't know how to do as I please,' said Alice, shaking her head. 'Everything is so confusing. I don't even know where I am.' 'You're in the King's palace, of course,' said the Mouse. 'But you already knew that, didn't you?' 'Well, yes and no,' said Alice, puzzled. 'I mean, I supposed I was in a palace, but I didn't know whose it was.' 'The King of Hearts, of course,' said the Mouse. 'This is his residence, and you're his guest.' 'His guest?' repeated Alice, startled. 'But I didn't come here as his guest. I fell down a rabbit-hole by accident.' 'Accident, indeed!' said the Mouse, with a snort. 'Everything happens for a reason, my dear Alice. You were meant to come here, and now that you're here, you'd better make the most of it.' 'But I don't want to make the most of it,' said Alice, beginning to feel rather annoyed. 'I want to go home.' 'Home!' said the Mouse, with contempt. 'What's home to you? A place where you have to obey rules and do as you're told? Bah! You're better off here, where you can do as you please.' 'But I don't know how to do as I please,' said Alice, shaking her head. 'Everything is so confusing. I don't even know where I am.' 'You're in the King's palace, of course,' said the Mouse. 'But you already knew that, didn't you?' 'Well, yes and no,' said Alice, puzzled. 'I mean, I supposed I was in a palace, but I didn't know whose it was.'

'The King of Hearts, of course,' said the Mouse. 'This is his residence, and you're his guest.' 'His guest?' repeated Alice, startled. 'But I didn't come here as his guest. I fell down a rabbit-hole by accident.' 'Accident, indeed!' said the Mouse, with a snort. 'Everything happens for a reason, my dear Alice.
