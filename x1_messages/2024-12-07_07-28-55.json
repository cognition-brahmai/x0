        "content": "So I need to calculate the volume of a cube where each side is 5 cm long. I remember that volume is basically the space inside the cube, and for cubes, there's a specific formula to find it. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the volume of a cube. I think it's something like side length cubed, or side length multiplied by itself three times. Yes, that sounds right. So, the formula should be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = \\text{side}^3 \\]\n\nor\n\n\\[ V = s^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( s \\) is the length of a side of the cube.\n\nNow, the side length is given as 5 cm. So, I just need to plug that into the formula:\n\n\\[ V = 5^3 \\]\n\nBut what does \\( 5^3 \\) mean? It means 5 multiplied by itself three times. So:\n\n\\[ 5^3 = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\]\n\nLet me calculate that step by step. First, multiply the first two 5s:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\]\n\nThen, multiply that result by the third 5:\n\n\\[ 25 \\times 5 = 125 \\]\n\nSo, the volume is 125. But wait, what are the units here? Since the side length is in centimeters, the volume should be in cubic centimeters. So, it's 125 cubic centimeters.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about what volume really means. Volume is the three-dimensional space occupied by an object. For a cube, which has all sides equal, multiplying the length, width, and height together gives the volume. Since all sides are 5 cm, it's:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\times \\text{height} = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125 \\, \\text{cm}^3 \\]\n\nThat makes sense. Another way to think about it is to imagine filling the cube with 1 cm\u00b3 cubes. How many 1 cm\u00b3 cubes would fit inside a 5 cm on each side cube? Well, along one edge, you can fit 5 cubes, and since it's three-dimensional, you'd have 5 layers of 5 by 5 cubes.\n\nSo, the bottom layer would have 5 rows with 5 cubes each, which is:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\, \\text{cubes} \\]\n\nThen, since there are 5 layers like this stacked up, the total number of cubes is:\n\n\\[ 25 \\times 5 = 125 \\, \\text{cubes} \\]\n\nEach of these small cubes represents 1 cm\u00b3, so the total volume is 125 cm\u00b3.\n\nJust to double-check, I can also use the general formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:\n\n\\[ V = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\nSince a cube is a special kind of rectangular prism where all sides are equal, plugging in 5 cm for each dimension:\n\n\\[ V = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125 \\, \\text{cm}^3 \\]\n\nIt's consistent with what I calculated earlier.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough. The volume of the cube is 125 cubic centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{125 \\, \\text{cm}^3} \\]"
