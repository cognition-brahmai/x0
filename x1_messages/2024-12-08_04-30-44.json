        "content": "Let's see. There's this snail climbing a 30-foot tree. It goes up 3 feet each day but slides back 2 feet each night. I need to find out how many days it takes for the snail to reach the top.\n\nFirst, I should think about the net progress the snail makes each day. During the day, it climbs up 3 feet, but at night it slides back 2 feet. So, the net gain each day is 3 feet minus 2 feet, which is 1 foot per day.\n\nIf it's just 1 foot per day, then for a 30-foot tree, it would take 30 days, right? But wait, I think there's more to it.\n\nLet me consider what happens on the last day. On the final day, when the snail reaches the top during the day, it won't slide back down at night because it has already reached the destination. So, I need to account for that.\n\nLet's say the snail needs to reach 30 feet. Each day it makes a net progress of 1 foot, but on the day it reaches the top, it doesn't slide back.\n\nMaybe I should calculate how much it needs to climb before the last day. If on the last day it climbs 3 feet and reaches the top, then on the previous day it must have been at 27 feet, because 27 + 3 = 30.\n\nBut wait, if it starts at 27 feet, climbs 3 feet to reach 30 feet during the day, and then doesn't slide back, it would have reached the top in that day.\n\nSo, how many days does it take to reach 27 feet with a net gain of 1 foot per day? That would be 27 days.\n\nThen, on the 28th day, it climbs the remaining 3 feet to reach 30 feet.\n\nTherefore, it takes 28 days in total.\n\nBut let's double-check this.\n\nOn day 1: climbs 3 feet, slides back 2 feet, net +1 foot.\n\nDay 2: starts at 1 foot, climbs to 4 feet, slides back to 3 feet.\n\nDay 3: starts at 3 feet, climbs to 6 feet, slides back to 4 feet.\n\n...\n\nEach day, it's effectively moving up by 1 foot.\n\nOn day 27: it would start at 26 feet, climb to 29 feet, slide back to 27 feet.\n\nOn day 28: starts at 27 feet, climbs to 30 feet, and reaches the top.\n\nNo slide back on day 28 because it has reached the top.\n\nSo, yes, it takes 28 days.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as each day it makes 1 foot of progress, but on the last day, it makes 3 feet of progress.\n\nSo, total progress needed is 30 feet.\n\nMinus the 3 feet it climbs on the last day, it needs to cover 27 feet with net 1 foot per day, which takes 27 days.\n\nPlus the last day, total 28 days.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation.\n\nLet d be the number of days.\n\nFor d-1 days, it makes 1 foot per day, and on the last day, it makes 3 feet.\n\nSo, total progress: (d-1)*1 + 3 = 30.\n\nSo, d - 1 + 3 = 30.\n\nTherefore, d + 2 = 30.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, (d-1)*1 + 3 = 30.\n\nSo, d - 1 + 3 = 30.\n\nTherefore, d + 2 = 30.\n\nThen, d = 28.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier conclusion.\n\nSo, the snail reaches the top in 28 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]"
