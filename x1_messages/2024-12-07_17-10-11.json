        "content": "Let's see. The store has a total inventory worth $20,000, and Product X makes up 60% of that inventory value. Each unit of Product X costs $40, and I need to find out how many units of Product X are in the inventory.\n\nFirst, I should find out how much value is assigned to Product X. Since it's 60% of the total inventory, I can calculate that by taking 60% of $20,000.\n\nSo, 60% of $20,000 is calculated as:\n\n0.60 \u00d7 20,000 = 12,000\n\nSo, the value of Product X in the inventory is $12,000.\n\nNow, each unit of Product X costs $40. To find out how many units make up $12,000, I need to divide the total value of Product X by the cost per unit.\n\nNumber of units of Product X = Total value of Product X / Cost per unit\n\nNumber of units of Product X = 12,000 / 40\n\nLet me do that division:\n\n12,000 \u00f7 40 = 300\n\nSo, there are 300 units of Product X in the inventory.\n\nWait a minute, just to double-check, let me verify my calculations.\n\nFirst, 60% of $20,000 is indeed $12,000.\n\nThen, $12,000 divided by $40 per unit should give me the number of units.\n\nYes, 12,000 \u00f7 40 is definitely 300.\n\nSo, the answer should be 300 units.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to find out the value of Product Y and see if it makes sense.\n\nSince Product X is 60% of the inventory, Product Y must be the remaining 40%.\n\nSo, 40% of $20,000 is:\n\n0.40 \u00d7 20,000 = 8,000\n\nSo, Product Y is worth $8,000 in the inventory.\n\nBut the question is only about Product X, so I don't need to worry about Product Y for this particular question.\n\nAlternatively, if I had information about the number of units of Product Y or its cost per unit, I could cross-verify, but since that's not provided, I don't need to go there.\n\nI think my initial calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of units of Product X in the inventory is 300.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
