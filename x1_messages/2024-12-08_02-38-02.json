        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a train going from City A to City B at an average speed of 80 miles per hour, and the distance between the two cities is 320 miles. Then, on its return journey, it travels back from City B to City A at an average speed of 100 miles per hour. We need to find the average speed for the entire round trip.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, for a round trip, the total distance would be twice the distance between City A and City B, since it's going and coming back. That means total distance is 2 * 320 miles, which is 640 miles.\n\nNow, I need to find the total time taken for the round trip. The time taken for each leg of the trip can be found using the formula: time = distance / speed.\n\nSo, for the trip from City A to City B:\n\nTime\u2081 = 320 miles / 80 mph = 4 hours.\n\nFor the return trip from City B to City A:\n\nTime\u2082 = 320 miles / 100 mph = 3.2 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time for the round trip is Time\u2081 + Time\u2082 = 4 hours + 3.2 hours = 7.2 hours.\n\nNow, the average speed for the entire round trip is total distance divided by total time:\n\nAverage speed = 640 miles / 7.2 hours.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n640 divided by 7.2. Hmm, to make it easier, I can multiply both numerator and denominator by 10 to get rid of the decimal:\n\n(640 * 10) / (7.2 * 10) = 6400 / 72.\n\nNow, 6400 divided by 72. Let's see, 72 times 88 is 6336, which is less than 6400. 72 times 89 is 6372, still less. 72 times 88.8 is 6372 + 72*0.8 = 6372 + 57.6 = 6429.6, which is more than 6400. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nMaybe I should use division directly:\n\n6400 \u00f7 72 = ?\n\nWell, 72 * 88 = 6336, which is 6400 - 64 = 6336, so 6400 - 6336 = 64, which means 72 * 88 + 64, but that's not directly helping.\n\nAlternatively, I can simplify the fraction 6400/72.\n\nBoth numbers are divisible by 16:\n\n6400 \u00f7 16 = 400\n\n72 \u00f7 16 = 4.5\n\nSo, 400 / 4.5.\n\nNow, 400 divided by 4.5. Again, to eliminate the decimal, multiply numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n(400 * 2) / (4.5 * 2) = 800 / 9.\n\nNow, 800 divided by 9 is approximately 88.888... repeating.\n\nSo, the average speed is approximately 88.89 miles per hour.\n\nBut let me check if there's a better way to calculate this, maybe using the formula for average speed when two distances are traveled at different speeds.\n\nThere's a formula for the average speed of a round trip when the distances are equal:\n\nAverage speed = (2 * speed\u2081 * speed\u2082) / (speed\u2081 + speed\u2082)\n\nWhere speed\u2081 and speed\u2082 are the speeds of the outgoing and returning trips, respectively.\n\nIn this case, speed\u2081 = 80 mph, speed\u2082 = 100 mph.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nAverage speed = (2 * 80 * 100) / (80 + 100) = (16000) / 180 = 1600 / 18 = 88.888... mph, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the average speed for the entire round trip is approximately 88.89 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that the average speed should not be the arithmetic mean of the two speeds. In fact, it should be less than the harmonic mean of the two speeds, which is what this formula represents.\n\nLet me verify this with the general formula for average speed, which is total distance over total time.\n\nWe already calculated that:\n\nTotal distance = 640 miles\n\nTotal time = 7.2 hours\n\nAverage speed = 640 / 7.2 = approximately 88.89 mph\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the harmonic mean of two speeds, s\u2081 and s\u2082, for the same distance is given by:\n\nHarmonic mean = 2 * s\u2081 * s\u2082 / (s\u2081 + s\u2082)\n\nWhich again gives us the same result.\n\nSo, the answer should be approximately 88.89 miles per hour.\n\nBut maybe I should express it as a fraction to be more precise.\n\nFrom earlier, 6400 / 72 simplifies to 800 / 9, which is approximately 88.888... repeating.\n\nSo, as a fraction, it's 800/9 mph, or approximately 88.89 mph.\n\nTherefore, the average speed for the entire round trip is 800/9 mph, or about 88.89 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{88.\\overline{8} \\text{ mph}} \\]"
