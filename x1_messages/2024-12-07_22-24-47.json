Mr. Brown plants red roses, Mrs. Green plants yellow daffodils, and Ms. White plants purple tulips. One day, a strong wind blows some petals from each flowerbed into the others. Unaware of this event, what colors of petals do Mr. Brown, Mrs. Green, and Ms. White think they will find in their respective flowerbeds?"

None of them are aware of the wind disturbing the petals, so they each assume that only their own type of flower's petals are present in their flowerbeds."
