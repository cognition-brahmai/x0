        "content": "So, there are 25 students in the class, and each one has an average of 5 pencils. To find out the total number of pencils all the students have together, I think I need to multiply the number of students by the average number of pencils per student.\n\nSo, that would be 25 students times 5 pencils per student. Let me do the math: 25 multiplied by 5 is 125. So, all the students have 125 pencils combined.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe if some students have more pencils and some have fewer, but the average is 5, then the total should still be 25 times 5, right? Because average is the total divided by the number of items.\n\nSo, average pencils per student is total pencils divided by number of students. So, average = total pencils / 25. Then, total pencils = average * 25, which is again 5 * 25 = 125.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. I don't think there's anything else I need to consider here. The answer should be 125 pencils in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{125} \\]"
