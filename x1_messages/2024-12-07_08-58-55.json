        "content": "So I have this problem here: there's a spherical ball with a diameter of 6 inches, and I need to find its surface area in square inches. Okay, let's see. I remember that the formula for the surface area of a sphere involves the radius and pi. Let me recall the exact formula.\n\nI think the formula for the surface area (SA) of a sphere is SA = 4 * \u03c0 * r\u00b2, where r is the radius of the sphere. Yeah, that sounds right. So, first things first, I need to find the radius from the given diameter.\n\nThe diameter is 6 inches, so the radius (r) would be half of that, right? So, r = diameter / 2 = 6 inches / 2 = 3 inches. Okay, got the radius.\n\nNow, plugging this into the formula: SA = 4 * \u03c0 * (3 inches)\u00b2. Let me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, square the radius: (3 inches)\u00b2 = 9 square inches.\n\nThen, multiply by \u03c0: 9 square inches * \u03c0 \u2248 9 * 3.1416 \u2248 28.2744 square inches.\n\nFinally, multiply by 4: 4 * 28.2744 square inches \u2248 113.0976 square inches.\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere is approximately 113.10 square inches.\n\nWait a minute, but I should consider the precision of my answer. The given diameter is 6 inches, which is a precise value, but \u03c0 is an irrational number. Maybe I should express the surface area in terms of \u03c0 rather than using a decimal approximation.\n\nLet's try that. Using the formula SA = 4 * \u03c0 * r\u00b2, and plugging in r = 3 inches:\n\nSA = 4 * \u03c0 * (3 inches)\u00b2 = 4 * \u03c0 * 9 square inches = 36\u03c0 square inches.\n\nSo, the exact surface area is 36\u03c0 square inches. That's probably a better way to present it, especially since the problem didn't specify to use a decimal approximation for \u03c0.\n\nBut just to be thorough, if I need to find a numerical value, using \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416, then SA \u2248 36 * 3.1416 = 113.0976 square inches, which rounds to about 113.10 square inches, as I calculated earlier.\n\nI think both answers are acceptable, depending on the context. If the problem expects an exact value, then 36\u03c0 square inches is perfect. If it needs a decimal approximation, then 113.10 square inches is fine.\n\nLet me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the formula involving the diameter directly. I know that the surface area can also be expressed in terms of the diameter, but I'm not sure off the top of my head what that formula is.\n\nLet me derive it. Since diameter (d) = 2r, then r = d/2. Plugging this into the surface area formula:\n\nSA = 4 * \u03c0 * (d/2)\u00b2 = 4 * \u03c0 * (d\u00b2/4) = \u03c0 * d\u00b2.\n\nWait, that seems too simple. So, SA = \u03c0 * d\u00b2? Let me verify that.\n\nIf d = 6 inches, then SA = \u03c0 * (6 inches)\u00b2 = \u03c0 * 36 square inches = 36\u03c0 square inches, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, yes, there's a simpler formula: SA = \u03c0 * d\u00b2, where d is the diameter. That's handy to know.\n\nI guess I was overcomplicating it by converting diameter to radius first. Directly using SA = \u03c0 * d\u00b2 is easier in this case.\n\nBut it's good to know both formulas, just in case.\n\nAlright, so to summarize, the surface area of the spherical ball is 36\u03c0 square inches, or approximately 113.10 square inches.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36\\pi \\text{ square inches}} \\]"
