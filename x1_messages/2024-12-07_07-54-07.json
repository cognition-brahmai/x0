        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a village with 50 houses, each house has 4 rooms, each room has 2 beds, and on each bed, there are 3 cats sleeping. We need to find out how many legs are in the village based on this setup.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total number of cats in the village because cats have legs, and that's what the question is asking for, right? I don't think there are any people in the houses since it only mentions cats sleeping on the beds. So, I'll assume that only cats are present.\n\nOkay, starting with the houses. There are 50 houses.\n\nEach house has 4 rooms, so the total number of rooms in the village is:\n\n50 houses * 4 rooms/house = 200 rooms\n\nNow, each room has 2 beds:\n\n200 rooms * 2 beds/room = 400 beds\n\nAnd on each bed, there are 3 cats:\n\n400 beds * 3 cats/bed = 1200 cats\n\nAlright, so there are 1200 cats in the village.\n\nNow, cats have 4 legs each, so the total number of legs would be:\n\n1200 cats * 4 legs/cat = 4800 legs\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that in some cultures, there are beliefs about cats having different numbers of legs, but I think universally, cats have 4 legs. So, 4800 legs seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\n- 50 houses\n\n- Each house has 4 rooms: 50 * 4 = 200 rooms\n\n- Each room has 2 beds: 200 * 2 = 400 beds\n\n- Each bed has 3 cats: 400 * 3 = 1200 cats\n\n- Each cat has 4 legs: 1200 * 4 = 4800 legs\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in a multiplicative way all at once:\n\n50 houses * 4 rooms/house * 2 beds/room * 3 cats/bed * 4 legs/cat\n\nThat would be:\n\n50 * 4 = 200\n\n200 * 2 = 400\n\n400 * 3 = 1200\n\n1200 * 4 = 4800 legs\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think 4800 is the correct total number of legs in the village.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4800} \\]"
