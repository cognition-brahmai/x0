        "content": "Yes, all stars eventually burn out. Stars have a finite lifespan, and once they exhaust their nuclear fuel, they can no longer sustain the nuclear fusion reactions in their cores that produce the energy needed to counteract gravitational collapse. The final stages of a star's life depend on its mass. For stars like our Sun, they will expand into red giants, shed their outer layers, and eventually become white dwarfs, cooling over billions of years. More massive stars may explode as supernovae and leave behind neutron stars or black holes. In all cases, the star eventually ceases to shine and becomes a stellar remnant."
