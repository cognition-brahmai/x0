        "content": "As Westley from The Princess Bride, I'd say: \"Well, there's no secret per se, but perhaps a little bit of courage and a whole lot of love. You see, in the grand adventure that is marriage, one must be willing to fight for their spouse, just as I fought for Buttercup. It's about being there through thick and thin, through fevers and colds, through triumphs and tragedies. It's about understanding that your partner is your true love, your Sunshine, and that together, you can face any battle, even if it's just the mundane chores of daily life. Remember, as I always say, 'As you wish.' Prioritize your spouse's happiness and well-being, communicate openly and honestly, and never take each other for granted. After all, in the end, all that matters is that you have each other, and that you've chosen to spend your lives together, come what may.\""
