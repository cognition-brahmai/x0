        "content": "Creating a multi-threaded chat server in C++ that supports multiple clients, real-time messaging, and user management involves several steps. Below is a basic implementation outline to help you get started.\n\n### Server Requirements:\n\n1. **Multi-threading**: To handle multiple clients simultaneously.\n2. **Socket Programming**: For network communication.\n3. **User Management**: Track online users and broadcast join/leave messages.\n4. **Message Handling**: Receive and forward messages between clients.\n\n### Implementation Steps:\n\n1. **Set Up the Server Socket**:\n   - Create a server socket.\n   - Bind the socket to a specific IP and port.\n   - Listen for incoming client connections.\n\n2. **Handle Client Connections**:\n   - Accept incoming client connections.\n   - Assign each client a new thread to handle their communications.\n\n3. **User Management**:\n   - Maintain a list of connected users.\n   - Broadcast join and leave messages to all connected clients.\n\n4. **Message Handling**:\n   - Receive messages from clients.\n   - Forward messages to all other connected clients.\n\n### Sample Code:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <thread>\n#include <mutex>\n#include <vector>\n#include <string>\n#include <sys/socket.h>\n#include <arpa/inet.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\nstd::vector<int> client_sockets;\nstd::mutex clients_mutex;\n\nvoid broadcast(const std::string& message) {\n    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(clients_mutex);\n    for (int sock : client_sockets) {\n        send(sock, message.c_str(), message.size(), 0);\n    }\n}\n\nvoid handle_client(int client_socket) {\n    char buffer[1024];\n    std::string welcome = \"Welcome to the chat server!\\n\";\n    send(client_socket, welcome.c_str(), welcome.size(), 0);\n\n    std::string username;\n    recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);\n    username = buffer;\n\n    {\n        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(clients_mutex);\n        client_sockets.push_back(client_socket);\n    }\n\n    std::string join_message = username + \" has joined the chat.\\n\";\n    broadcast(join_message);\n\n    while (true) {\n        ssize_t bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);\n        if (bytes_received <= 0) {\n            break;\n        }\n        buffer[bytes_received] = '\\0';\n        std::string message = username + \": \" + buffer;\n        broadcast(message);\n    }\n\n    {\n        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(clients_mutex);\n        auto it = std::find(client_sockets.begin(), client_sockets.end(), client_socket);\n        if (it != client_sockets.end()) {\n            client_sockets.erase(it);\n        }\n    }\n\n    std::string leave_message = username + \" has left the chat.\\n\";\n    broadcast(leave_message);\n\n    close(client_socket);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int server_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);\n    if (server_socket == -1) {\n        std::cerr << \"Failed to create socket\\n\";\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    struct sockaddr_in server_addr;\n    server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;\n    server_addr.sin_port = htons(12345);\n    server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;\n\n    if (bind(server_socket, (struct sockaddr*)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr)) == -1) {\n        std::cerr << \"Bind failed\\n\";\n        close(server_socket);\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    if (listen(server_socket, 3) == -1) {\n        std::cerr << \"Listen failed\\n\";\n        close(server_socket);\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    std::cout << \"Server is listening on port 12345...\\n\";\n\n    while (true) {\n        struct sockaddr_in client_addr;\n        socklen_t client_size = sizeof(client_addr);\n        int client_socket = accept(server_socket, (struct sockaddr*)&client_addr, &client_size);\n        if (client_socket == -1) {\n            std::cerr << \"Accept failed\\n\";\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        std::thread client_thread(handle_client, client_socket);\n        client_thread.detach();\n    }\n\n    close(server_socket);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Server Setup**:\n   - A server socket is created and bound to port 12345.\n   - The server listens for incoming connections.\n\n2. **Client Handling**:\n   - Each client connection is accepted and handled in a new thread.\n   - The client's username is received and stored.\n   - Join and leave messages are broadcast to all connected clients.\n\n3. **Message Broadcasting**:\n   - All messages from clients are broadcast to everyone else.\n\n4. **User Management**:\n   - A list of client sockets is maintained to track connected users.\n   - Mutex is used to synchronize access to the client list.\n\nThis is a basic implementation and can be expanded with features like private messaging, user authentication, and more robust error handling."
