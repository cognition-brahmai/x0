        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are 30 people in a group, and among them, 18 like chocolate ice cream, 20 like vanilla ice cream, and 10 like both chocolate and vanilla. I need to find out how many people do not like either flavor. Hmm, sounds like a classic set theory problem, maybe involving Venn diagrams?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I know that the total number of people is 30. Now, 18 like chocolate and 20 like vanilla, but 10 like both. So, if I just add 18 and 20, that's 38, but that includes the 10 who like both twice\u2014once in the chocolate group and once in the vanilla group. To get the total number of people who like at least one of the flavors, I need to subtract those 10 who were counted twice.\n\nSo, the number of people who like at least one flavor is 18 + 20 - 10 = 28. That makes sense because the overlapping group was counted twice, so we subtract once to get the correct total.\n\nNow, since there are 30 people in total and 28 like at least one of the flavors, the number of people who do not like either flavor should be 30 - 28 = 2.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The principle states that for any two sets, the size of their union is the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of their intersection.\n\nIn formula terms, |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|.\n\nHere, A is the set of people who like chocolate, and B is the set of people who like vanilla.\n\nSo, |A| = 18, |B| = 20, and |A \u2229 B| = 10.\n\nTherefore, |A \u222a B| = 18 + 20 - 10 = 28.\n\nAnd since the total number of people is 30, the number who like neither is 30 - |A \u222a B| = 30 - 28 = 2.\n\nThat seems consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there's any possibility of overlap or miscounting. For example, could there be someone who likes only chocolate, only vanilla, or both?\n\nYes, that's exactly what's happening here. The 10 who like both are included in the counts for both chocolate and vanilla.\n\nSo, to verify:\n\n- Number who like only chocolate: 18 (total who like chocolate) - 10 (who like both) = 8.\n\n- Number who like only vanilla: 20 (total who like vanilla) - 10 (who like both) = 10.\n\n- Number who like both: 10.\n\n- So, total who like at least one flavor: 8 (only chocolate) + 10 (only vanilla) + 10 (both) = 28.\n\nAgain, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who do not like either flavor is 30 - 28 = 2.\n\nI think that's the answer, but let me see if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nMaybe using a Venn diagram would help visualize it.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents people who like chocolate, and the other represents people who like vanilla.\n\n- The chocolate circle has 18 people.\n\n- The vanilla circle has 20 people.\n\n- The overlapping area, where people like both, has 10 people.\n\nSo, the part of the chocolate circle that doesn't overlap with vanilla is 18 - 10 = 8 people.\n\nThe part of the vanilla circle that doesn't overlap with chocolate is 20 - 10 = 10 people.\n\nThen, the overlapping area is 10 people.\n\nAdding those up: 8 + 10 + 10 = 28 people like at least one flavor.\n\nTotal people are 30, so 30 - 28 = 2 people do not like either flavor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use probabilities or some other method, but since this is a straightforward set theory problem, I think the approach I've taken is sufficient and accurate.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this logic, and the calculations seem correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the number of people who do not like either flavor is 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
