        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a bee lands on a flower every 10 seconds, and I need to figure out how many flowers it can land on in 15 minutes. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to convert 15 minutes into seconds because the bee's landing interval is given in seconds. I know that 1 minute is 60 seconds, so 15 minutes would be:\n\n15 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 900 seconds\n\nSo, in 15 minutes, there are 900 seconds.\n\nNow, the bee lands on a flower every 10 seconds. To find out how many times it can land in 900 seconds, I should divide the total time by the interval between landings.\n\nNumber of landings = Total time / Interval\n\nNumber of landings = 900 seconds / 10 seconds/landing\n\nWhen I do that division, I get:\n\nNumber of landings = 90\n\nSo, the bee can land on 90 flowers in 15 minutes.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check that. Suppose the bee lands on its first flower at time zero, then at 10 seconds, 20 seconds, and so on, up to 900 seconds. So, the number of landings should be the total time divided by the interval plus one for the initial landing.\n\nLet me consider that. If it lands at time zero, then the landings would be at 0, 10, 20, ..., up to 900 seconds. To find the number of landings, it's like finding how many 10-second intervals fit into 900 seconds, including the starting point.\n\nSo, number of landings = (900 seconds / 10 seconds) + 1 = 90 + 1 = 91\n\nHmm, now I'm confused. Some people might consider the first landing at time zero, others might consider the first landing at time 10 seconds.\n\nLet me see. If it lands every 10 seconds, starting at time zero, then the landings are at:\n\nTime 0: landing 1\n\nTime 10: landing 2\n\nTime 20: landing 3\n\n...\n\nTime 900: landing 91\n\nSo, that would be 91 landings in 15 minutes.\n\nBut if it starts landing at time 10 seconds, then:\n\nTime 10: landing 1\n\nTime 20: landing 2\n\n...\n\nTime 900: landing 90\n\nThat would be 90 landings.\n\nThe problem says \"lands on a flower every 10 seconds,\" but it doesn't specify when it starts. To be safe, I'll assume it starts at time zero.\n\nSo, my final answer is 91 flowers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{91} \\]"
