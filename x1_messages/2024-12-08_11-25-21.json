        "content": "So I've got this probability question here: \"In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, what is the probability of drawing an Ace followed by a King without replacement?\" Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that a standard deck has 52 cards, with 4 Aces and 4 Kings. The problem specifies drawing two cards without replacement, which means once the first card is drawn, it's not put back into the deck before drawing the second card. That changes things because the probabilities will be dependent on each draw.\n\nSo, the event we're interested in is drawing an Ace first and then a King. Since these are sequential events without replacement, I think I need to calculate the probability of both events happening in that specific order.\n\nLet me start by finding the probability of drawing an Ace first. There are 4 Aces in a deck of 52 cards, so the probability of drawing an Ace first should be:\n\nP(Ace first) = Number of Aces / Total number of cards = 4/52 = 1/13\n\nOkay, that makes sense. Now, given that an Ace has been drawn and not replaced, the deck now has 51 cards left. Among these, there are still 4 Kings, since no King has been drawn yet.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a King second, given that an Ace was drawn first, should be:\n\nP(King second | Ace first) = Number of Kings / Remaining cards = 4/51\n\nNow, to find the overall probability of both events happening in sequence\u2014first drawing an Ace and then drawing a King\u2014I need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, the total probability should be:\n\nP(Ace then King) = P(Ace first) \u00d7 P(King second | Ace first) = (1/13) \u00d7 (4/51)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n(1/13) \u00d7 (4/51) = (1 \u00d7 4) / (13 \u00d7 51) = 4 / 663\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the simplest form. Let me check if 4 and 663 have any common factors.\n\n4 is 2 \u00d7 2, and 663 divided by 3 is 221, so 663 = 3 \u00d7 221. 221 divided by 13 is 17, so 663 = 3 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 17. So, nothing in common with 4, which is 2 \u00d7 2. Therefore, 4/663 is already in simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate it in decimal form to get a better sense. Let's see:\n\n4 divided by 663 is approximately 0.00603, or 0.603%.\n\nSo, the probability is about 0.6%.\n\nWait a minute, does that sound right? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, P(Ace first) = 4/52 = 1/13, that's correct.\n\nThen, P(King second | Ace first) = 4/51, since there are still 4 Kings left and 51 cards remaining.\n\nMultiplying them: (1/13) \u00d7 (4/51) = 4/663, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of combinations or permutations. Since the order matters here, perhaps it's better to think in terms of permutations.\n\nThe number of ways to draw an Ace first and then a King would be:\n\nNumber of Aces \u00d7 Number of Kings = 4 \u00d7 4 = 16\n\nThe total number of ways to draw any two cards in sequence without replacement is:\n\n52 \u00d7 51 = 2,652\n\nSo, the probability would be:\n\nP = (4 \u00d7 4) / (52 \u00d7 51) = 16 / 2,652\n\nSimplifying 16/2,652:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 4: 4/663\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, confirmed, the probability is 4/663, or approximately 0.6%.\n\nJust to be thorough, what if I considered drawing a King first and then an Ace? Would the probability be the same?\n\nLet's see:\n\nP(King first) = 4/52 = 1/13\n\nThen, P(Ace second | King first) = 4/51\n\nSo, P(King then Ace) = (1/13) \u00d7 (4/51) = 4/663\n\nSame as before.\n\nInteresting, so the probability of drawing an Ace followed by a King is the same as drawing a King followed by an Ace.\n\nWait, but intuitively, I would think that the order shouldn't matter, but in reality, the probability calculations give the same result for both sequences.\n\nDoes that make sense? Yes, because the calculations are based on the specific sequence, and in both cases, it's one specific rank followed by another, with the same number of cards for each rank.\n\nNow, if the question was about drawing an Ace and a King in any order, then it would be different. In that case, I would need to consider both sequences: Ace then King, and King then Ace, and add their probabilities.\n\nSo, P(Ace then King or King then Ace) = P(Ace then King) + P(King then Ace) = 4/663 + 4/663 = 8/663\n\nWhich is approximately 1.2%.\n\nBut in this specific question, it asks for drawing an Ace followed by a King, so the sequence matters, and the answer should be 4/663.\n\nJust to make sure, is there any other way to approach this problem?\n\nMaybe using conditional probability formula?\n\nThe conditional probability formula is:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) \u00d7 P(B|A)\n\nWhich is exactly what I used earlier.\n\nP(drawing an Ace first and a King second) = P(Ace first) \u00d7 P(King second | Ace first)\n\nAnd that's how I calculated it.\n\nI think that's the most straightforward way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of permutations.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to draw an Ace first and a King second.\n\nNumber of Aces: 4\n\nNumber of Kings: 4\n\nSo, favorable outcomes: 4 \u00d7 4 = 16\n\nTotal possible outcomes when drawing two cards in sequence without replacement: 52 \u00d7 51 = 2,652\n\nSo, P = 16 / 2,652 = 4 / 663\n\nSame as before.\n\nAnother way could be to use combinations, but since order matters here, permutations are more appropriate.\n\nIf order didn't matter, I could use combinations, but in this case, order is important.\n\nWait, actually, in combinations, order doesn't matter, so for combinations, it would be inappropriate here.\n\nSo, permutations are the way to go.\n\nI think I've confirmed the answer sufficiently.\n\nJust to summarize:\n\nThe probability of drawing an Ace followed by a King without replacement from a standard deck of 52 playing cards is 4/663, or approximately 0.6%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{663}} \\]"
