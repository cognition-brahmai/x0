The product rule states that if you have a function f(x) = u(x) * v(x), then the derivative f'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x).\n\nLet's set u(x) = e^(2x) and v(x) = cos(x).\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x).\n\nThe derivative of u(x) = e^(2x) is u'(x) = 2e^(2x). Remember that the derivative of e^(kx) is k*e^(kx).\n\nThe derivative of v(x) = cos(x) is v'(x) = -sin(x).\n\nNow, applying the product rule:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nf'(x) = (2e^(2x))(cos(x)) + (e^(2x))(-sin(x))\n\nf'(x) = 2e^(2x)cos(x) - e^(2x)sin(x)\n\nWe can factor out e^(2x):\n\nf'(x) = e^(2x)(2cos(x) - sin(x))\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = e^(2x) * cos(x) is f'(x) = e^(2x)(2cos(x) - sin(x)).\n"
