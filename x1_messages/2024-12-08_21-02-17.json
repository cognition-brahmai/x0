        "content": "Let's see. There's a store having a 20% discount on all items, and a customer wants to buy something that originally costs $80. I need to figure out how much the customer will pay after the discount.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a 20% discount means. Percentage discount is a reduction in price based on a percentage of the original price. So, 20% off means the customer saves 20% of the original price.\n\nTo calculate the discount amount, I can multiply the original price by the discount percentage. But I need to make sure I use the percentage in the correct form. Since 20% is the same as 20 per 100, or 0.20 in decimal form, I'll use 0.20 for the calculation.\n\nSo, the discount amount is $80 multiplied by 0.20.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 80 times 0.20.\n\n80 times 0.20 is 16. So, the discount amount is $16.\n\nNow, to find out the final price the customer has to pay, I need to subtract the discount amount from the original price.\n\nOriginal price is $80, minus the discount of $16.\n\n80 minus 16 equals 64.\n\nTherefore, the customer will pay $64 for the item after the 20% discount.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to calculate this? Maybe instead of calculating the discount and then subtracting, I can find out what percentage of the original price the customer has to pay directly.\n\nIf there's a 20% discount, that means the customer pays 100% minus 20%, which is 80% of the original price.\n\nSo, 80% of $80 should give me the same result.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n80% is 0.80 in decimal form.\n\nSo, $80 multiplied by 0.80.\n\n80 times 0.80 is 64.\n\nAgain, $64.\n\nGood, both methods give me the same answer, which reinforces that $64 is the correct amount the customer will pay.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this?\n\nPerhaps I can use fractions. 20% is equivalent to 1/5, since 20 divided by 100 is 1/5.\n\nSo, the discount is 1/5 of the original price.\n\n1/5 of $80 is $16, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSubtracting $16 from $80 again gives $64.\n\nAlright, no matter which method I use, I keep getting $64 as the final price.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{64} \\]"
