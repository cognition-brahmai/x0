        "content": "The musical instrument you're referring to is the piano. It was indeed invented in the early 18th century by Bartolomeo Cristofori, an Italian instrument maker. The piano is a keyboard instrument that produces sound by striking strings with hammers when its keys are pressed. This mechanism allows for a wide range of dynamics, from soft to loud, depending on how forcefully the keys are played. The piano has since become one of the most popular and versatile instruments in Western music, used in various genres such as classical, jazz, blues, and more."
