        "content": "The term \"cross-price elasticity of demand\" in agricultural economics refers to option A: The ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded of one good to the percentage change in price of another good.\n\nTo elaborate, cross-price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the demand for one product to a change in the price of another related product. This concept is particularly important in agriculture where products can be substitutes or complements.\n\nFor example, if the price of corn increases, farmers might shift their production to soybeans, assuming they are substitutes in production. Similarly, if corn is used as feed for livestock, a change in the price of corn could affect the demand for meat products, making them complements.\n\nUnderstanding cross-price elasticity helps in predicting how changes in market conditions or policies affecting one agricultural commodity can have spillover effects on others. This is crucial for making informed decisions in production, pricing, and policy formulation in the agricultural sector."
