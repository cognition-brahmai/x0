        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. The car rental company charges a daily rate and an additional amount per kilometer driven. So, the total cost will be the sum of the daily charges and the charges for the kilometers driven.\n\nFirst, the daily charge: it's $20 per day. The customer rents the car for 3 days, so we need to multiply $20 by 3.\n\n$20/day * 3 days = $60\n\nNext, the charge per kilometer: it's 15 cents per kilometer. The customer drives 250 kilometers, so we need to multiply 15 cents by 250.\n\nBut wait, it's easier to work with dollars instead of cents. Since 15 cents is $0.15, we can use that.\n\n$0.15/km * 250 km = $37.50\n\nNow, we add the two amounts together to get the total charge.\n\n$60 + $37.50 = $97.50\n\nSo, the total amount the customer will be charged is $97.50.\n\nLet me just double-check that.\n\nDaily charge: $20 * 3 = $60\n\nKilometer charge: $0.15 * 250 = $37.50\n\nTotal: $60 + $37.50 = $97.50\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{97.50} \\]"
