        "content": "So if someone saves $200 every month for 5 years without any interest, we can calculate the total savings by multiplying the monthly savings by the number of months in 5 years.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many months are there in 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 5 years would have 5 times 12, which is 60 months.\n\nNow, if they save $200 each month for 60 months, the total savings would be $200 multiplied by 60.\n\nLet me do the math: 200 multiplied by 60 is 12,000.\n\nSo, at the end of 5 years, they would have saved $12,000, assuming no interest is earned.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12000} \\]"
