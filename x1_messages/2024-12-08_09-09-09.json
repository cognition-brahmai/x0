        "content": "So, you've got a car traveling at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, and it takes 3 hours to get from point A to point B. You want to know how far apart these two points are. Okay, let's think about this.\n\nFirst, I recall that when we're dealing with constant speed, distance, speed, and time are related by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nIn this case, the speed is 60 miles per hour, and the time is 3 hours. So, plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 60 \\, \\text{miles per hour} \\times 3 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nNow, when you multiply miles per hour by hours, the hours unit cancels out, leaving you with miles. So,\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 180 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, points A and B are 180 miles apart.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If the car is going at 60 miles per hour, that means it covers 60 miles every hour. So, in 3 hours, it should cover:\n\n\\[ 60 \\, \\text{miles/hour} \\times 3 \\, \\text{hours} = 180 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of velocity and time. Since the speed is constant, the velocity is also constant in this context, and the distance traveled is indeed the product of velocity and time.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the rate of travel. The car is traveling at a rate of 60 miles per hour, so in one hour, it covers 60 miles. Therefore, in three hours, it would cover three times that distance, which is again 180 miles.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The distance between points A and B is 180 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180 \\text{ miles}} \\]"
