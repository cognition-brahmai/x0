        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a PHP script that connects to a MySQL database and performs CRUD operations on an \"employees\" table. The table has fields like id, first_name, last_name, email, and hire_date. I need to write functions for adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving employee records.\n\nFirst, I need to set up the database connection. In PHP, I can use MySQLi or PDO to connect to a MySQL database. Since MySQLi is more feature-rich and secure, I'll go with that. I'll need to know the database host, username, password, and database name to establish the connection.\n\nLet me sketch out the basic structure of the script. I'll create a class called EmployeeDB that handles the database connection and CRUD operations.\n\nclass EmployeeDB {\n    private $host = 'localhost';\n    private $db_name = 'company_db';\n    private $username = 'root';\n    private $password = '';\n    private $conn;\n\n    public function __construct() {\n        $this->connect();\n    }\n\n    private function connect() {\n        $this->conn = new mysqli($this->host, $this->username, $this->password, $this->db_name);\n\n        if ($this->conn->connect_error) {\n            die(\"Connection failed: \" . $this->conn->connect_error);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // CRUD functions will go here\n}\n\nOkay, so in the constructor, I'm calling the connect() method, which establishes the database connection. If there's an error connecting, it will die and print the error message.\n\nNow, let's work on the CRUD operations.\n\nFirst, Create: Adding a new employee.\n\nI need a function that takes first_name, last_name, email, and hire_date as parameters and inserts a new record into the employees table.\n\npublic function addEmployee($first_name, $last_name, $email, $hire_date) {\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email, hire_date) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)\";\n    $stmt = $this->conn->prepare($sql);\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"ssss\", $first_name, $last_name, $email, $hire_date);\n\n    if ($stmt->execute()) {\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\nI'm using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. The \"ssss\" in bind_param specifies that all parameters are strings.\n\nNext, Read: Retrieving employee records.\n\nI'll create a function to fetch all employees and another to get a single employee by ID.\n\npublic function getAllEmployees() {\n    $sql = \"SELECT * FROM employees\";\n    $result = $this->conn->query($sql);\n\n    if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n        return $result;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\npublic function getEmployeeById($id) {\n    $sql = \"SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = ?\";\n    $stmt = $this->conn->prepare($sql);\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"i\", $id);\n    $stmt->execute();\n    $result = $stmt->get_result();\n\n    if ($result->num_rows == 1) {\n        return $result->fetch_assoc();\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\nIn getEmployeeById, I'm using \"i\" in bind_param because id is an integer.\n\nNow, Update: Modifying an existing employee's details.\n\nI'll create a function that takes id, first_name, last_name, email, and hire_date as parameters and updates the corresponding record.\n\npublic function updateEmployee($id, $first_name, $last_name, $email, $hire_date) {\n    $sql = \"UPDATE employees SET first_name=?, last_name=?, email=?, hire_date=? WHERE id=?\";\n    $stmt = $this->conn->prepare($sql);\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"ssssi\", $first_name, $last_name, $email, $hire_date, $id);\n\n    if ($stmt->execute()) {\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\nHere, \"ssssi\" in bind_param indicates that the first four parameters are strings and the last one is an integer.\n\nFinally, Delete: Removing an employee by ID.\n\npublic function deleteEmployee($id) {\n    $sql = \"DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = ?\";\n    $stmt = $this->conn->prepare($sql);\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"i\", $id);\n\n    if ($stmt->execute()) {\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\nThat should cover all the CRUD operations.\n\nI should also consider closing the database connection when done. I can add a closeConnection method.\n\nprivate function closeConnection() {\n    $this->conn->close();\n}\n\nAnd perhaps call it in the destructor.\n\npublic function __destruct() {\n    $this->closeConnection();\n}\n\nAlright, let me summarize the class.\n\nclass EmployeeDB {\n    private $host = 'localhost';\n    private $db_name = 'company_db';\n    private $username = 'root';\n    private $password = '';\n    private $conn;\n\n    public function __construct() {\n        $this->connect();\n    }\n\n    private function connect() {\n        $this->conn = new mysqli($this->host, $this->username, $this->password, $this->db_name);\n\n        if ($this->conn->connect_error) {\n            die(\"Connection failed: \" . $this->conn->connect_error);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public function addEmployee($first_name, $last_name, $email, $hire_date) {\n        $sql = \"INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email, hire_date) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)\";\n        $stmt = $this->conn->prepare($sql);\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"ssss\", $first_name, $last_name, $email, $hire_date);\n\n        if ($stmt->execute()) {\n            return true;\n        } else {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public function getAllEmployees() {\n        $sql = \"SELECT * FROM employees\";\n        $result = $this->conn->query($sql);\n\n        if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n            return $result;\n        } else {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public function getEmployeeById($id) {\n        $sql = \"SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = ?\";\n        $stmt = $this->conn->prepare($sql);\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"i\", $id);\n        $stmt->execute();\n        $result = $stmt->get_result();\n\n        if ($result->num_rows == 1) {\n            return $result->fetch_assoc();\n        } else {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public function updateEmployee($id, $first_name, $last_name, $email, $hire_date) {\n        $sql = \"UPDATE employees SET first_name=?, last_name=?, email=?, hire_date=? WHERE id=?\";\n        $stmt = $this->conn->prepare($sql);\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"ssssi\", $first_name, $last_name, $email, $hire_date, $id);\n\n        if ($stmt->execute()) {\n            return true;\n        } else {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public function deleteEmployee($id) {\n        $sql = \"DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = ?\";\n        $stmt = $this->conn->prepare($sql);\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"i\", $id);\n\n        if ($stmt->execute()) {\n            return true;\n        } else {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    private function closeConnection() {\n        $this->conn->close();\n    }\n\n    public function __destruct() {\n        $this->closeConnection();\n    }\n}\n\nNow, to use this class, I can create an instance of EmployeeDB and call its methods.\n\n$employeeDB = new EmployeeDB();\n\n// Add a new employee\nif ($employeeDB->addEmployee('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', '2023-01-01')) {\n    echo \"Employee added successfully.\";\n} else {\n    echo \"Error adding employee.\";\n}\n\n// Get all employees\n$employees = $employeeDB->getAllEmployees();\nif ($employees) {\n    while ($row = $employees->fetch_assoc()) {\n        echo \"ID: \" . $row['id'] . \", Name: \" . $row['first_name'] . \" \" . $row['last_name'] . \"<br>\";\n    }\n} else {\n    echo \"No employees found.\";\n}\n\n// Get employee by ID\n$employee = $employeeDB->getEmployeeById(1);\nif ($employee) {\n    echo \"ID: \" . $employee['id'] . \", Name: \" . $employee['first_name'] . \" \" . $employee['last_name'] . \"<br>\";\n} else {\n    echo \"Employee not found.\";\n}\n\n// Update employee\nif ($employeeDB->updateEmployee(1, 'Jane', 'Doe', 'jane.doe@example.com', '2023-01-15')) {\n    echo \"Employee updated successfully.\";\n} else {\n    echo \"Error updating employee.\";\n}\n\n// Delete employee\nif ($employeeDB->deleteEmployee(1)) {\n    echo \"Employee deleted successfully.\";\n} else {\n    echo \"Error deleting employee.\";\n}\n\nI should also make sure that the employees table exists in the database with the specified fields. Here's the SQL to create the table:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees (\n    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    first_name VARCHAR(100),\n    last_name VARCHAR(100),\n    email VARCHAR(100),\n    hire_date DATE\n);\n\nI need to ensure that the database connection details are correct, especially the hostname, username, password, and database name. In a production environment, it's better to keep these credentials in a config file or environment variables for security reasons.\n\nAlso, error handling can be improved. Instead of just returning true or false, I could throw exceptions or return more detailed error messages.\n\nAdditionally, for the email field, I might want to add validation to ensure it's a valid email format. However, that would be handled at the application level before calling the add or update methods.\n\nThat's pretty much it for the basic CRUD operations using PHP and MySQLi. If there are any specific requirements or additional features needed, I can expand on this.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo perform CRUD operations on a MySQL database using PHP, you can use the following script. This script uses the MySQLi extension to connect to the database and perform operations on an \"employees\" table.\n\n## Final Solution Code\n\n```php\nclass EmployeeDB {\n    private $host = 'localhost';\n    private $db_name = 'company_db';\n    private $username = 'root';\n    private $password = '';\n    private $conn;\n\n    public function __construct() {\n        $this->connect();\n    }\n\n    private function connect() {\n        $this->conn = new mysqli($this->host, $this->username, $this->password, $this->db_name);\n\n        if ($this->conn->connect_error) {\n            die(\"Connection failed: \" . $this->conn->connect_error);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public function addEmployee($first_name, $last_name, $email, $hire_date) {\n        $sql = \"INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email, hire_date) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)\";\n        $stmt = $this->conn->prepare($sql);\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"ssss\", $first_name, $last_name, $email, $hire_date);\n\n        if ($stmt->execute()) {\n            return true;\n        } else {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public function getAllEmployees() {\n        $sql = \"SELECT * FROM employees\";\n        $result = $this->conn->query($sql);\n\n        if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n            return $result;\n        } else {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public function getEmployeeById($id) {\n        $sql = \"SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = ?\";\n        $stmt = $this->conn->prepare($sql);\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"i\", $id);\n        $stmt->execute();\n        $result = $stmt->get_result();\n\n        if ($result->num_rows == 1) {\n            return $result->fetch_assoc();\n        } else {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public function updateEmployee($id, $first_name, $last_name, $email, $hire_date) {\n        $sql = \"UPDATE employees SET first_name=?, last_name=?, email=?, hire_date=? WHERE id=?\";\n        $stmt = $this->conn->prepare($sql);\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"ssssi\", $first_name, $last_name, $email, $hire_date, $id);\n\n        if ($stmt->execute()) {\n            return true;\n        } else {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public function deleteEmployee($id) {\n        $sql = \"DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = ?\";\n        $stmt = $this->conn->prepare($sql);\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"i\", $id);\n\n        if ($stmt->execute()) {\n            return true;\n        } else {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    private function closeConnection() {\n        $this->conn->close();\n    }\n\n    public function __destruct() {\n        $this->closeConnection();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n1. **Database Connection**: The `EmployeeDB` class establishes a connection to the MySQL database in its constructor using the provided credentials.\n\n2. **Adding an Employee**: The `addEmployee` method inserts a new record into the `employees` table using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.\n\n3. **Retrieving All Employees**: The `getAllEmployees` method fetches all records from the `employees` table.\n\n4. **Retrieving an Employee by ID**: The `getEmployeeById` method fetches a single employee record based on the provided ID.\n\n5. **Updating an Employee**: The `updateEmployee` method updates an existing employee record in the database.\n\n6. **Deleting an Employee**: The `deleteEmployee` method removes an employee record from the database based on the provided ID.\n\n7. **Closing the Connection**: The database connection is closed when the `EmployeeDB` object is destroyed, ensuring resources are properly released.\n\nThis script provides a basic CRUD functionality and can be extended or modified based on specific requirements."
