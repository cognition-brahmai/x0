        "content": "Let's see. The car rental company has 150 cars, and 60% of them are rented out at any given time. So, first I need to find out how many cars are rented out normally.\n\n60% of 150 is calculated as 0.60 \u00d7 150 = 90 cars. So, 90 cars are rented out, and therefore, 150 - 90 = 60 cars are available for rent at any given time.\n\nNow, the company wants to have at least 100 cars available for rent always. So, they need to increase the number of cars in such a way that even after 60% are rented out, there are still at least 100 cars left.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total number of cars needed as x. Then, 40% of x should be at least 100, because 60% are rented out, leaving 40% available.\n\nSo, 0.40x \u2265 100.\n\nTo find x, divide both sides by 0.40:\n\nx \u2265 100 / 0.40 = 250.\n\nSo, the company needs to have at least 250 cars in total to ensure that at least 100 are always available for rent.\n\nNow, they currently have 150 cars, so the number of additional cars they need to purchase is 250 - 150 = 100 cars.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIf they have 250 cars and 60% are rented out, that's 0.60 \u00d7 250 = 150 cars rented out, leaving 250 - 150 = 100 cars available. That matches the requirement.\n\nAlternatively, 40% of 250 is indeed 100 cars available.\n\nSo, yes, they need to purchase 100 more cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
