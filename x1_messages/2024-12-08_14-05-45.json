        "content": "So I've got this problem here: If it takes 6 workers 8 hours to complete a job, how long would it take 4 workers to complete the same job if they work at the same rate? Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a job that's being done by 6 workers in 8 hours. Now, if we have fewer workers, specifically 4, how much time will they need to finish the same job, assuming they all work at the same rate?\n\nI think the key here is to find out the total amount of work done, and then see how long it takes for a different number of workers to complete that same amount of work.\n\nMaybe I can calculate the total work in terms of \"worker-hours.\" If 6 workers take 8 hours, then the total work is 6 workers multiplied by 8 hours, which is 48 worker-hours. So, the job requires 48 worker-hours to complete.\n\nNow, if I have 4 workers, and they're each working at the same rate, I can set up an equation to find out how many hours they need to work to accumulate 48 worker-hours.\n\nLet's let \\( h \\) be the number of hours the 4 workers need to work. Then, the total work done by them would be 4 workers times \\( h \\) hours, which is \\( 4h \\) worker-hours.\n\nSince the total work required is 48 worker-hours, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 4h = 48 \\]\n\nNow, solving for \\( h \\):\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{48}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ h = 12 \\]\n\nSo, it would take 4 workers 12 hours to complete the same job.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. If 6 workers take 8 hours, and 4 workers are fewer, they should take more time, right? Yes, 12 hours is more than 8 hours, so that seems logical.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the work rate per worker. If 6 workers take 8 hours, then each worker is contributing a certain amount of work per hour.\n\nThe work rate for one worker would be \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of the work per 8 hours, but that seems a bit convoluted. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of total work again.\n\nActually, the first method seems straightforward. By calculating the total work in worker-hours and then dividing that by the number of workers, I can find the required hours.\n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe using proportions.\n\nIf 6 workers take 8 hours, then 4 workers would take more hours. The number of workers is inversely proportional to the time taken, assuming they work at the same rate.\n\nSo, we can set up a proportion:\n\n\\[ \\text{workers} \\times \\text{hours} = \\text{constant} \\]\n\nFor 6 workers:\n\n\\[ 6 \\times 8 = 48 \\]\n\nFor 4 workers:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times h = 48 \\]\n\nSo, again:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{48}{4} = 12 \\]\n\nSame answer as before, which is a good sign.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how much work one worker can do in one hour, and then scale it up for 4 workers.\n\nIf 6 workers take 8 hours to complete the job, then the work done by one worker in one hour would be \\( \\frac{1}{6 \\times 8} = \\frac{1}{48} \\) of the job.\n\nNow, if you have 4 workers, each doing \\( \\frac{1}{48} \\) of the job per hour, together they can do \\( 4 \\times \\frac{1}{48} = \\frac{4}{48} = \\frac{1}{12} \\) of the job per hour.\n\nSo, if they can complete \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) of the job in one hour, it would take them 12 hours to complete the entire job.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like whether the workers interfere with each other or if there are diminishing returns when adding more workers. But the problem says they work at the same rate, so I can assume that their individual rates are additive and there are no such complications.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find the total amount of work in terms of worker-hours, as I did earlier, and then divide that by the number of workers to find the required hours.\n\nSo, in all these approaches, I'm getting 12 hours as the answer. That gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the job allows for parallel work without any restrictions. For example, if it's a task that can be perfectly divided among workers, like assembling pieces on a assembly line, then the time should scale inversely with the number of workers.\n\nIn this case, reducing the number of workers from 6 to 4 (which is \\( \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} \\) of the original workforce) should increase the time by \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) times.\n\nSo, 8 hours multiplied by \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) is 12 hours. Again, the same answer.\n\nAlright, I think I've approached this problem from multiple angles and consistently arrived at 12 hours as the answer. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, and the answer makes intuitive sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
