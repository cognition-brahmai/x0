        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. So, total balls in the box are 5 + 3 + 2, which is 10 balls.\n\nThe question is, if I draw 3 balls at random without replacement, what's the probability that I get exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I draw a ball, I don't put it back into the box. So, each draw depends on the previous one because the total number of balls decreases each time I draw.\n\nNow, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 10. That sounds like a combination problem because the order in which I draw the balls doesn't matter.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 10 is C(10, 3).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * (10 - 3)!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7!) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 7!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8) / 6 = 720 / 6 = 120.\n\nSo, there are 120 possible ways to draw 3 balls from 10.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is getting exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball.\n\nThere are 5 red balls and 3 blue balls.\n\nFirst, the number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 5 is C(5, 2).\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!) = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 3!)) = (5 \u00d7 4) / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10.\n\nSo, there are 10 ways to choose 2 red balls from 5.\n\nNext, the number of ways to choose 1 blue ball out of 3 is C(3, 1).\n\nC(3, 1) = 3! / (1! * (3 - 1)!) = (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / (1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 6 / 2 = 3.\n\nSo, there are 3 ways to choose 1 blue ball from 3.\n\nSince these are independent choices (choosing red balls and choosing blue balls), I can multiply the number of ways to get the total number of favorable outcomes.\n\nSo, total favorable outcomes = ways to choose 2 red balls \u00d7 ways to choose 1 blue ball = 10 \u00d7 3 = 30.\n\nNow, probability = favorable outcomes / total possible outcomes = 30 / 120 = 1/4.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the probability step by step, considering that the draws are without replacement.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing 2 red balls and 1 blue ball in a specific order, say red first, then red again, then blue.\n\nThe probability of drawing a red ball first is 5/10, since there are 5 red balls out of 10.\n\nAfter drawing one red ball, there are now 4 red balls left and total balls are 9.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing another red ball is 4/9.\n\nThen, drawing a blue ball next: there are 3 blue balls left out of 8 total balls.\n\nSo, that's 3/8.\n\nSo, the probability of this specific sequence (red, red, blue) is (5/10) \u00d7 (4/9) \u00d7 (3/8).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n(5/10) = 1/2\n\n(4/9) = 4/9\n\n(3/8) = 3/8\n\nSo, (1/2) \u00d7 (4/9) \u00d7 (3/8) = (1 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3) / (2 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8) = 12 / 144 = 1/12.\n\nBut wait, this is just for one specific order. There are other orders in which I can draw 2 red balls and 1 blue ball, like red, blue, red or blue, red, red.\n\nSo, I need to consider all possible sequences that result in 2 reds and 1 blue.\n\nThe number of such sequences is the number of ways to arrange 2 reds and 1 blue, which is C(3, 2) = 3, or simply, there are 3 different sequences: RRB, RBR, BRR.\n\nSo, since each of these sequences has the same probability of 1/12, the total probability is 3 \u00d7 (1/12) = 1/4.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/4.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of multinomial coefficients.\n\nThe multinomial coefficient for this scenario would be C(3; 2, 1) = 3! / (2! \u00d7 1!) = 6 / 2 = 3, which is the number of ways to arrange 2 reds and 1 blue.\n\nThen, the probability is this coefficient times the product of the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, C(3; 2, 1) \u00d7 (5/10)^2 \u00d7 (3/10)^1.\n\nWait, but this seems similar to the previous approach.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's not accounting for the without replacement aspect, because the probabilities change with each draw.\n\nSo, maybe this isn't the best approach here.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of hypergeometric distribution, since we're sampling without replacement.\n\nThe hypergeometric distribution gives the probability of k successes (in this case, red balls) in n draws (3 draws) from a finite population without replacement.\n\nBut in this problem, we need exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball.\n\nThe formula for the hypergeometric probability is:\n\nP(X = k) = [C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (10 balls)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (5 red balls)\n\n- n is the number of draws (3 balls)\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (2 red balls)\n\nBut in this case, we also need exactly 1 blue ball, so maybe I need to adjust for that.\n\nAlternatively, since the events are mutually exclusive (red, blue, green), I can specify the number of each color I want.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing exactly 2 red balls, 1 blue ball, and 0 green balls can be calculated using the multivariate hypergeometric distribution.\n\nThe formula for the multivariate hypergeometric distribution is:\n\nP(X1 = k1, X2 = k2, ..., Xc = kc) = [C(K1, k1) * C(K2, k2) * ... * C(Kc, kc)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (10 balls)\n\n- K1, K2, ..., Kc are the sizes of each category (5 red, 3 blue, 2 green)\n\n- n is the number of draws (3 balls)\n\n- k1, k2, ..., kc are the numbers of each category drawn (2 red, 1 blue, 0 green)\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nP(2 red, 1 blue, 0 green) = [C(5, 2) * C(3, 1) * C(2, 0)] / C(10, 3)\n\nWe already calculated C(5, 2) = 10, C(3, 1) = 3, C(2, 0) = 1 (since there's only one way to choose 0 items from 2), and C(10, 3) = 120.\n\nSo, P = (10 * 3 * 1) / 120 = 30 / 120 = 1/4.\n\nAgain, this matches our previous calculation.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach I take, I end up with the same probability of 1/4.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball is 1/4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}} \\]"
