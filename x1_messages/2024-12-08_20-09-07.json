        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 10 houses on one side of the street and 15 on the other, making a total of 25 houses. Each house has an even number of people living in it. I need to figure out if the total number of people in all these houses is even.\n\nFirst, I recall that even numbers are numbers that are divisible by 2, like 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on. So, if each house has an even number of people, that means for each house, the number of residents can be expressed as 2 times some integer. For example, if a house has 4 people, that's 2 times 2; if it has 6 people, that's 2 times 3, and so forth.\n\nNow, to find the total number of people on both sides of the street, I need to add up the number of people in all 25 houses. Since each of these numbers is even, I'm essentially adding up a bunch of even numbers.\n\nI remember that when you add two even numbers, the result is always even. For example, 2 + 4 = 6, which is even. Similarly, 6 + 8 = 14, which is also even. So, adding even numbers keeps the sum even.\n\nBut here, I'm adding 25 even numbers. Is there something special about adding an odd number of even numbers? Let's think about it.\n\nSuppose I have two even numbers: 2 and 4. Their sum is 6, which is even. Now, add another even number, say 6: 6 + 6 = 12, still even. It seems like no matter how many even numbers I add, as long as each one is even, the total should remain even.\n\nWait a minute, but 25 is an odd number. Could that affect things? Let's consider a smaller example to test this.\n\nSuppose there are 3 houses, each with 2 people:\n\nHouse 1: 2 people\n\nHouse 2: 2 people\n\nHouse 3: 2 people\n\nTotal people: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, which is even.\n\nAnother example: 3 houses with 4 people each:\n\n4 + 4 + 4 = 12, still even.\n\nWhat if the houses have different even numbers? Say:\n\nHouse 1: 2 people\n\nHouse 2: 4 people\n\nHouse 3: 6 people\n\nTotal: 2 + 4 + 6 = 12, even.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nBut let's think about the general case. If each house has an even number of people, then each house's population can be expressed as 2 times some integer. So, for house i, the number of people is 2 * k_i, where k_i is an integer.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people is the sum from i=1 to 25 of 2 * k_i, which is 2 * (sum of k_i from i=1 to 25). Since the sum of integers is an integer, let's denote the sum of k_i as K, which is an integer. So, total people = 2 * K, which is even.\n\nTherefore, yes, the total number of people living on both sides of the street is even.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any scenario where adding even numbers could result in an odd total. For example, if the number of houses was even, would that make a difference?\n\nSuppose there were 2 houses, each with 2 people: 2 + 2 = 4, even.\n\nOr 2 houses with 3 people each: wait, but 3 is odd, but the problem states each house has an even number of people. So, 3 is not allowed in this problem.\n\nWait, no, 3 is odd, but the problem specifies even. So, all houses have even numbers.\n\nTherefore, it's not possible to have an odd number of people in any house in this scenario.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the total number of people living on both sides of the street is even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yes, the total number of people is even.}} \\]"
