        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a rectangular room with an area of 180 square feet and a perimeter of 54 feet. We need to find the dimensions, which means finding the length and the width of the room.\n\nFirst, I recall that for a rectangle, the area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, if we let L be the length and W be the width, then:\n\nArea = L * W = 180\n\nAlso, the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all the sides, which is twice the length plus twice the width. So:\n\nPerimeter = 2L + 2W = 54\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1) L * W = 180\n\n2) 2L + 2W = 54\n\nI need to solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of L and W.\n\nLet me try to simplify the second equation. I can factor out a 2:\n\n2(L + W) = 54\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\nL + W = 27\n\nOkay, so L + W = 27.\n\nNow, I can express one variable in terms of the other using this equation. Let's solve for L:\n\nL = 27 - W\n\nNow, I can substitute this expression for L into the first equation:\n\n(27 - W) * W = 180\n\nLet's expand that:\n\n27W - W^2 = 180\n\nNow, let's rearrange it into a standard quadratic equation form:\n\n-W^2 + 27W - 180 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:\n\nW^2 - 27W + 180 = 0\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for W. I can use the quadratic formula:\n\nW = [27 \u00b1 sqrt(27^2 - 4*1*180)] / 2\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\nsqrt(729 - 720) = sqrt(9) = 3\n\nSo, W = [27 \u00b1 3] / 2\n\nThat gives two possible solutions:\n\nW = (27 + 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15\n\nW = (27 - 3)/2 = 24/2 = 12\n\nSo, the width could be 15 feet or 12 feet.\n\nNow, using L = 27 - W:\n\nIf W = 15, then L = 27 - 15 = 12\n\nIf W = 12, then L = 27 - 12 = 15\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. Depending on how we define length and width, they can be interchangeable. So, essentially, the dimensions are 15 feet by 12 feet.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure this makes sense.\n\nFirst, check the area:\n\n15 * 12 = 180 square feet? Yes, that matches.\n\nNext, check the perimeter:\n\n2*(15) + 2*(12) = 30 + 24 = 54 feet? Yes, that matches too.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider 15 feet as the width and 12 feet as the length, or vice versa, it doesn't really matter for the rectangle's dimensions.\n\nWait, but sometimes length is considered longer than width, so perhaps in that convention, length is 15 feet and width is 12 feet.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify which one is length and which one is width, so both are acceptable.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem?\n\nMaybe using trial and error, but that might take longer.\n\nOr, I could have set up the equations differently.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet's assume that the length is L and the width is W.\n\nWe have L * W = 180\n\nAnd L + W = 27\n\nIf I square the sum of L and W:\n\n(L + W)^2 = L^2 + 2LW + W^2 = 27^2 = 729\n\nBut I also know that L * W = 180, so 2LW = 360\n\nSo, L^2 + 2LW + W^2 = L^2 + W^2 + 360 = 729\n\nTherefore, L^2 + W^2 = 729 - 360 = 369\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps me directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Pythagorean theorem, but since it's a rectangle, that might not be directly applicable unless it's a right-angled room or something, which it is, but I don't think that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the aspect ratio or something, but that might be overcomplicating things.\n\nI think my first approach is the most straightforward.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other information I can derive from the given data.\n\nFor example, is there a way to find the difference between L and W?\n\nLet me see.\n\nI have L + W = 27\n\nAnd L - W = ?\n\nLet\u2019s suppose I can find L - W.\n\nThen, I can solve for L and W using the sum and difference.\n\nBut I don't have another equation directly giving me L - W.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the area and the perimeter to find L - W.\n\nLet me see.\n\nI have L * W = 180\n\nAnd L + W = 27\n\nLet\u2019s consider (L - W)^2 = L^2 - 2LW + W^2 = (L^2 + W^2) - 2LW\n\nI already have L^2 + W^2 = 369 from earlier.\n\nSo, (L - W)^2 = 369 - 2*180 = 369 - 360 = 9\n\nTherefore, L - W = \u00b13\n\nSo, L - W = 3 or L - W = -3\n\nBut since length is generally taken to be greater than or equal to width, I'll consider L - W = 3\n\nNow, I have:\n\nL + W = 27\n\nL - W = 3\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\n2L = 30 => L = 15\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n\n2W = 24 => W = 12\n\nWhich matches my earlier result.\n\nSo, both methods lead me to the same conclusion: the dimensions are 15 feet by 12 feet.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I think about the room's dimensions in terms of factors of 180 that add up to 27.\n\nSo, I need two numbers that multiply to 180 and add to 27.\n\nLet's list the factor pairs of 180:\n\n1 & 180\n\n2 & 90\n\n3 & 60\n\n4 & 45\n\n5 & 36\n\n6 & 30\n\n9 & 20\n\n10 & 18\n\n12 & 15\n\nAh, there it is: 12 and 15 multiply to 180 and add to 27.\n\nSo, that confirms my answer.\n\nThis seems like a straightforward problem once you set up the equations correctly.\n\nI think I've covered it thoroughly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15 \\text{ feet by } 12 \\text{ feet}} \\]"
