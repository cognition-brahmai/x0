        "content": "Let's see. The store sells apples for $3 per pound and oranges for $4 per pound. The customer buys 5 pounds of apples and 7 pounds of oranges. I need to find out the total cost.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the cost of the apples. Since apples are $3 per pound and the customer buys 5 pounds, I can multiply 3 by 5. That should give me the total cost for the apples.\n\n3 * 5 = 15\n\nSo, the apples cost $15.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost of the oranges. Oranges are $4 per pound, and the customer buys 7 pounds. So, I'll multiply 4 by 7 to find the total cost for the oranges.\n\n4 * 7 = 28\n\nTherefore, the oranges cost $28.\n\nNow, to find the total amount the customer has to pay, I need to add the cost of the apples and the cost of the oranges together.\n\n15 + 28 = 43\n\nSo, the total cost is $43.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I'll do the calculations again to be sure.\n\nApples: 3 pounds per dollar times 5 pounds: 3 * 5 = 15.\n\nOranges: 4 dollars per pound times 7 pounds: 4 * 7 = 28.\n\nTotal: 15 + 28 = 43.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of units. Each pound of apples is $3, so for 5 pounds, it's 5 times $3, which is $15. Similarly, each pound of oranges is $4, so for 7 pounds, it's 7 times $4, which is $28. Adding those together gives $43.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the total weight bought and the average price, but that might be more complicated for this straightforward problem.\n\nI think $43 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{43} \\]"
