        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a company that sells three types of products: X, Y, and Z. Each has different profit margins\u201420% for X, 25% for Y, and 30% for Z. The company sold $1000 worth of X, $2000 worth of Y, and $3000 worth of Z. I need to find out their overall profit margin on these sales.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a profit margin is. Profit margin is basically the profit made on each dollar of sales, expressed as a percentage. So, for product X, a 20% profit margin means that for every dollar sold, the company makes 20 cents in profit.\n\nTo find the overall profit margin, I need to calculate the total profit from all products and then divide that by the total sales, and finally multiply by 100 to get a percentage.\n\nLet me start by calculating the profit from each product.\n\nFor product X:\n\nSales: $1000\n\nProfit margin: 20%\n\nProfit = Sales * Profit margin = $1000 * 20% = $1000 * 0.20 = $200\n\nFor product Y:\n\nSales: $2000\n\nProfit margin: 25%\n\nProfit = $2000 * 25% = $2000 * 0.25 = $500\n\nFor product Z:\n\nSales: $3000\n\nProfit margin: 30%\n\nProfit = $3000 * 30% = $3000 * 0.30 = $900\n\nNow, I'll add up the profits from all three products to get the total profit.\n\nTotal profit = Profit from X + Profit from Y + Profit from Z = $200 + $500 + $900 = $1600\n\nNext, I need to find the total sales from all products.\n\nTotal sales = Sales of X + Sales of Y + Sales of Z = $1000 + $2000 + $3000 = $6000\n\nNow, the overall profit margin is the total profit divided by total sales, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.\n\nOverall profit margin = (Total profit / Total sales) * 100 = ($1600 / $6000) * 100\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, divide $1600 by $6000:\n\n1600 / 6000 = 0.2667 (repeating)\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n0.2667 * 100 = 26.67%\n\nSo, the overall profit margin is approximately 26.67%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a better way to calculate this to ensure accuracy.\n\nAnother approach could be to find the weighted average of the profit margins, weighted by the sales amounts.\n\nSo, the formula for the weighted average profit margin would be:\n\nOverall profit margin = (Sales of X * Margin of X + Sales of Y * Margin of Y + Sales of Z * Margin of Z) / Total sales\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nOverall profit margin = ($1000 * 20% + $2000 * 25% + $3000 * 30%) / $6000\n\nFirst, calculate each term:\n\n$1000 * 20% = $200\n\n$2000 * 25% = $500\n\n$3000 * 30% = $900\n\nNow, sum these up: $200 + $500 + $900 = $1600\n\nThen, divide by total sales: $1600 / $6000 = 0.2667\n\nFinally, to percentage: 0.2667 * 100 = 26.67%\n\nSo, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could express the profit margins as decimals and calculate it that way.\n\nMargin of X: 0.20\n\nMargin of Y: 0.25\n\nMargin of Z: 0.30\n\nTotal profit = ($1000 * 0.20) + ($2000 * 0.25) + ($3000 * 0.30) = $200 + $500 + $900 = $1600\n\nTotal sales = $1000 + $2000 + $3000 = $6000\n\nOverall margin = $1600 / $6000 = 0.2667 or 26.67%\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider if there's any other factor that might affect the overall profit margin. For example, are there any fixed costs that I need to account for? The problem doesn't mention any fixed costs, so I assume that the profit margins given are on the sales amounts, meaning that they already account for variable costs, and I don't need to consider fixed costs for this calculation.\n\nAlso, ensure that the sales amounts are exclusive of tax, but since the problem doesn't mention taxes, I'll assume that the sales amounts are net sales, i.e., they are already exclusive of tax.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the contribution of each product to the total profit.\n\nProduct X: $200 profit\n\nProduct Y: $500 profit\n\nProduct Z: $900 profit\n\nTotal profit: $1600\n\nTotal sales: $6000\n\nOverall margin: 26.67%\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to calculate the profit margin for each product and then find some kind of average, but since the sales amounts are different, a simple average of the margins wouldn't be accurate. That's why the weighted average approach is appropriate here.\n\nLet me see: if I were to calculate the simple average of the margins:\n\n(20% + 25% + 30%) / 3 = 75% / 3 = 25%\n\nBut that's different from the 26.67% I calculated earlier. That's because the sales amounts are different for each product, so the profit margin should be weighted by the sales amounts.\n\nProduct X has $1000 in sales, Y has $2000, and Z has $3000. So, Z has the highest sales and the highest margin, which pulls the overall margin higher than the simple average.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to calculate the profit margin based on the cost instead of the sales, that would be different, but the problem specifies profit margins on sales, so I think I'm on the right track.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other approach to cross-verify the result.\n\nSuppose I calculate the cost for each product.\n\nFor product X:\n\nSales: $1000\n\nProfit margin: 20%\n\nSo, cost = sales - profit = $1000 - $200 = $800\n\nAlternatively, since margin is profit divided by sales, profit = margin * sales = 0.20 * $1000 = $200, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for Y:\n\nCost = $2000 - $500 = $1500\n\nFor Z:\n\nCost = $3000 - $900 = $2100\n\nNow, total sales: $6000\n\nTotal cost: $800 + $1500 + $2100 = $4400\n\nTotal profit: $6000 - $4400 = $1600\n\nOverall margin: $1600 / $6000 = 26.67%\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the overall profit margin using the cost figures.\n\nOverall margin = total profit / total sales = $1600 / $6000 = 26.67%\n\nSo, all these methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nI think I've confirmed the answer sufficiently.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{26.67\\%} \\]"
