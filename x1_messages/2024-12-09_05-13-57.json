        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about a school election. Candidate A received 60% of the votes, and candidate B received 40%. Candidate A won by 120 votes, and I need to find out the total number of votes cast in the election.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. I need to find the total number of votes, which I'll probably call \"T\" for total. Now, candidate A has 60% of T, and candidate B has 40% of T. The difference between their votes is 120, which is the margin by which A won.\n\nSo, I can express the votes for each candidate in terms of T:\n\nVotes for A: 0.60T\n\nVotes for B: 0.40T\n\nThe difference between A and B's votes is 120, so:\n\n0.60T - 0.40T = 120\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n0.20T = 120\n\nNow, to find T, I can divide both sides by 0.20:\n\nT = 120 / 0.20\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n120 divided by 0.20 is the same as 120 divided by 1/5, which is 120 * 5 = 600.\n\nSo, the total number of votes cast is 600.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If T is 600, then A has 60% of 600, which is 360 votes, and B has 40% of 600, which is 240 votes. The difference is 360 - 240 = 120 votes, which matches the problem.\n\nLooks good to me.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{600} \\]"
