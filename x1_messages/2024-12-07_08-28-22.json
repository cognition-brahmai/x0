        "content": "So there's a class with 30 students, and out of those, 18 are girls. I need to find out what percentage of the class is made up of boys. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that the total number of students is 30, and among them, 18 are girls. So, to find the number of boys, I can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students. That is:\n\nNumber of boys = Total students - Number of girls\nNumber of boys = 30 - 18\nNumber of boys = 12\n\nSo, there are 12 boys in the class.\n\nNow, to find the percentage of boys in the class, I need to find out what part of the total student population the boys make up, and then convert that part into a percentage.\n\nThe formula for percentage is:\n\nPercentage = (Part / Whole) * 100\n\nIn this case, the \"part\" is the number of boys, which is 12, and the \"whole\" is the total number of students, which is 30.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nPercentage of boys = (12 / 30) * 100\n\nNow, let's do the division first:\n\n12 divided by 30 is 0.4\n\nThen, multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n0.4 * 100 = 40%\n\nTherefore, 40% of the class is made up of boys.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nTotal students = 30\nNumber of girls = 18\nNumber of boys = 30 - 18 = 12\n\nPercentage of boys = (12 / 30) * 100\n\nLet's simplify 12 / 30 first. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 6.\n\n12 \u00f7 6 = 2\n30 \u00f7 6 = 5\n\nSo, 12 / 30 = 2 / 5\n\nNow, 2 / 5 is equal to 0.4, and 0.4 multiplied by 100% is indeed 40%.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of fractions. Since there are 12 boys out of 30 students, the fraction is 12/30, which simplifies to 2/5. To convert the fraction 2/5 to a percentage, I can divide 2 by 5 to get 0.4, and then multiply by 100 to get 40%.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that half of 30 is 15, so if there were 15 boys and 15 girls, that would be 50% each. But since there are only 12 boys, it should be less than 50%, which matches the 40% I calculated.\n\nI can also check this by calculating the percentage of girls and seeing if the two percentages add up to 100%.\n\nNumber of girls = 18\nPercentage of girls = (18 / 30) * 100\n\n18 divided by 30 is 0.6, and 0.6 multiplied by 100% is 60%.\n\nSo, percentage of boys is 40%, percentage of girls is 60%, and together they make 100%, which makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I add 40% and 60%, I get 100%, which confirms that my calculation is correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that the ratio of boys to total students is 12:30, which can be simplified to 2:5, as I did earlier. Converting that ratio to a percentage gives me 40%.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The percentage of boys in the class is 40%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40\\%} \\]"
