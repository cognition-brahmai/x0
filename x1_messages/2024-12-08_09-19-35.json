        "content": "Let's see. So, three friends went out for dinner and the total bill was $60. They planned to split the bill evenly, which means each person would pay $20, right? Because $60 divided by 3 is $20.\n\nBut one friend forgot his wallet, so he can't pay his share. That means the remaining two friends have to cover his $20 plus their own $20 each.\n\nSo, if each of the two friends pays an extra $10 to cover the third friend's $20, that would make sense. Let me check:\n\nEach of the two friends pays $20 (their own share) plus $10 (half of the third friend's share), which is $30 each.\n\nBut wait, $30 times 2 is $60, which covers the total bill. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is that the two friends who have money need to split the entire bill since the third one can't pay. So, $60 divided by 2 is $30 each.\n\nEither way, each of the two friends should pay $30 to cover the total cost of the meal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
