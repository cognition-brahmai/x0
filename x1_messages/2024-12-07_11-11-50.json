        "content": "So, if a car gets 30 miles per gallon and has a 12-gallon fuel tank, to find out how many miles it can travel on a full tank before running out of gas, I guess I just need to multiply the miles per gallon by the number of gallons in the tank.\n\nSo, that would be 30 miles/gallon times 12 gallons. The gallons unit cancels out, leaving miles. So, 30 times 12 is 360 miles.\n\nWait, but is there anything else I should consider? Like, is there ever a situation where the car might not get exactly 30 miles per gallon? Maybe under different driving conditions or if the car is older.\n\nBut the question says the car gets 30 miles per gallon, so I think I can assume that's the average or standard mileage for that car. And it has a 12-gallon tank, so 30 times 12 should give me the total miles it can travel on a full tank.\n\nSo, 360 miles is the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check if there's any additional factors that could affect this. For example, does the way you drive affect mileage? Probably, but since the car is rated at 30 miles per gallon, I think that's already taken into account.\n\nAlso, is there residual fuel left in the tank even when it's empty? Sometimes cars have a reserve or some fuel left beyond what the gauge shows. But the question says \"before running out of gas,\" so I think it means completely empty.\n\nSo, based on that, 360 miles is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
