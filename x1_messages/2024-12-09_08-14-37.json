Burberry is famous for its distinctive check pattern, known as the \"Burberry Check,\" and for its innovative trench coats, which were designed with functionality and style in mind, particularly gaining popularity during World War I. The brand has since expanded to include a wide range of luxury fashion items, but it's still renowned for these signature elements."
