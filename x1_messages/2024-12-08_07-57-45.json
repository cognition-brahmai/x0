It's a narrow strip of land that separates the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, playing a crucial role in the formation of the Americas as we know them today. The construction of the Panama Canal across this isthmus has been of significant economic and strategic importance, facilitating global trade by providing a shorter route for ships between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans."
