        "content": "So, let's see here. There's a factory with 8 machines, and each machine produces 250 units per day. That means currently, the factory is producing 8 times 250 units per day. So, 8 multiplied by 250 is... let me calculate that. 8 times 250 is 2,000 units per day.\n\nNow, the factory is adding two more machines, each with the same production capacity, which is 250 units per day each. So, the two new machines will produce 2 times 250, which is 500 units per day together.\n\nTo find out the total production after adding the new machines, I need to add the current production and the production from the new machines. So, that's 2,000 units plus 500 units, which equals 2,500 units per day.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe instead of calculating the current production and then adding the new machines' production, I could think about the total number of machines after adding the new ones and then multiply by the production per machine.\n\nSo, originally there are 8 machines, and they're adding 2 more, so total machines will be 8 plus 2, which is 10 machines. Each machine produces 250 units per day, so 10 times 250 is 2,500 units per day.\n\nHmm, that's the same answer I got earlier. So, regardless of the method, the factory will produce 2,500 units per day after adding the new machines.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's make sure there aren't any other factors to consider. For example, is there any mention of the machines having different production capacities? No, it says all machines have the same production capacity.\n\nAlso, is there any mention of the new machines having a different production rate? No, it says the new machines have the same production capacity.\n\nAlright, so I think 2,500 units per day is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2500} \\]"
