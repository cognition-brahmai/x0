        "content": "Let's see. The baker uses 8 eggs for every 12 muffins. I need to find out how many eggs he'll need for 60 muffins. Hmm, this seems like a proportion problem.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many times 12 muffins go into 60 muffins. So, 60 divided by 12 is 5. That means he's baking 5 times the amount of his usual 12 muffins.\n\nIf he needs 8 eggs for 12 muffins, then for 5 times that amount, he should need 5 times the eggs. So, 8 eggs multiplied by 5 is 40 eggs.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can set up a proportion to be sure. So, eggs over muffins equals eggs over muffins: 8/12 = x/60.\n\nTo solve for x, I can cross-multiply: 8 * 60 = 12 * x, which is 480 = 12x. Then, divide both sides by 12 to get x = 40.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, he needs 40 eggs for 60 muffins.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can think of it another way. Maybe find out how many eggs are needed per muffin and then multiply by 60.\n\nSo, for 12 muffins, he uses 8 eggs, so per muffin, it's 8/12 eggs, which simplifies to 2/3 egg per muffin.\n\nThen, for 60 muffins, it would be 60 * (2/3) eggs. Let's calculate that: 60 times 2 is 120, divided by 3 is 40 eggs.\n\nAgain, I get 40 eggs. Seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a ratio. The ratio of eggs to muffins is 8:12, which simplifies to 2:3.\n\nSo, for every 3 muffins, he uses 2 eggs.\n\nTherefore, for 60 muffins, which is 20 sets of 3 muffins (since 60 divided by 3 is 20), he would need 20 sets of 2 eggs, which is 40 eggs.\n\nYet again, 40 eggs.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 40 eggs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
