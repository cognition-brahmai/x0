        "content": "So, there are about 50,000 species of spiders worldwide, and around 3,000 of those are found in North America. I need to find out what percentage of the total spider species are in North America.\n\nTo find a percentage, I remember that percentage means \"per hundred,\" so I need to see how many hundredths of the total species are found in North America.\n\nThe formula for percentage is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{part}}{\\text{whole}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the \"part\" is the number of spider species in North America, which is 3,000, and the \"whole\" is the total number of spider species worldwide, which is 50,000.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{3,000}{50,000} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nFirst, I'll divide 3,000 by 50,000.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3,000}{50,000} = 0.06\n\\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n\\[\n0.06 \\times 100 = 6\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, approximately 6% of spider species are found in North America.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAnother approach could be to think about the ratio of North American species to the total species.\n\nThe ratio is 3,000 to 50,000. Simplifying that fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3,000}{50,000} = \\frac{3}{50}\n\\]\n\nNow, to convert that fraction to a percentage, I can divide 3 by 50 and then multiply by 100.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{50} = 0.06\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.06 \\times 100 = 6\\%\n\\]\n\nSame answer again. So, it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about proportions. If 50,000 species represent 100%, then each 500 species represent 1% (since 50,000 divided by 100 is 500).\n\nSo, to find out what percentage 3,000 is, I can divide 3,000 by 500.\n\n\\[\n3,000 \\div 500 = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, again, 6%.\n\nAll these methods lead me back to 6%. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6\\%} \\]"
