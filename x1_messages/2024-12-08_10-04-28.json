        "content": "Here's a simple Golang program that does exactly what you've asked for. It accepts a string from the user, counts the frequency of each character, and prints them sorted in descending order of their frequency.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"sort\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tvar input string\n\tfmt.Print(\"Enter a string: \")\n\tfmt.Scanln(&input)\n\n\tfrequency := make(map[rune]int)\n\tfor _, char := range input {\n\t\tfrequency[char]++\n\t}\n\n\t// Create a slice of pairs to sort by frequency\n\ttype pair struct {\n\t\tchar  rune\n\t\tcount int\n\t}\n\tvar pairs []pair\n\tfor char, count := range frequency {\n\t\tpairs = append(pairs, pair{char, count})\n\t}\n\n\t// Sort the slice by frequency in descending order\n\tsort.Slice(pairs, func(i, j int) bool {\n\t\treturn pairs[i].count > pairs[j].count\n\t})\n\n\t// Print the results\n\tfor _, p := range pairs {\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"%q: %d\\n\", p.char, p.count)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Handling:**\n   - We prompt the user to enter a string and read it using `fmt.Scanln`.\n\n2. **Frequency Count:**\n   - We use a `map[rune]int` to count the frequency of each character in the string. The `rune` type is used to handle any Unicode character.\n\n3. **Sorting:**\n   - To sort the frequencies in descending order, we create a slice of custom `pair` structs, each holding a character and its count.\n   - We then sort this slice using `sort.Slice` with a custom less function that compares the counts.\n\n4. **Output:**\n   - Finally, we iterate through the sorted slice and print each character along with its frequency.\n\nThis program is straightforward and efficient for counting and sorting character frequencies in a given string."
