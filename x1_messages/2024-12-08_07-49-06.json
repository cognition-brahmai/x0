        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python script that watches a specific directory for any new files and automatically uploads them to an Amazon S3 bucket. I need to use the Boto3 library to interact with AWS services, and the script should also accept command-line arguments to specify which directory to monitor and which S3 bucket to upload the files to.\n\nFirst things first, I need to make sure I have Boto3 installed. I can install it using pip if I don't have it already. So, in the terminal, I'd run something like `pip install boto3`.\n\nNext, I need to set up my AWS credentials so that Boto3 can authenticate with my AWS account. I think the best way to do this is by using the AWS CLI to configure my credentials. So, I'll need to run `aws configure` and input my access key, secret access key, region, and output format.\n\nNow, for monitoring the directory for new files, I need to use a library that can watch for changes in the directory. I recall that there's a library called `watchdog` in Python that's great for this purpose. So, I'll need to install that as well using `pip install watchdog`.\n\nOnce I have both Boto3 and watchdog installed, I can start writing my script.\n\nFirst, I need to import the necessary modules. That would be Boto3 for S3 interactions, watchdog for monitoring the directory, and probably some standard libraries for handling paths and command-line arguments.\n\nI should use the `argparse` module to handle command-line arguments. So, users can specify the directory to watch and the S3 bucket name via the command line.\n\nLet me sketch out the structure of the script:\n\n1. Import required modules: Boto3, watchdog's `Observer` and `FileSystemEventHandler`, `argparse`, and maybe `os` for path operations.\n\n2. Set up argument parsing with `argparse` to accept the directory path and S3 bucket name.\n\n3. Create a class that inherits from `FileSystemEventHandler` to handle the events (i.e., new files being created in the directory).\n\n4. In the event handler class, override the `on_created` method to handle new files. When a new file is created, this method will be called.\n\n5. Inside the `on_created` method, upload the new file to the specified S3 bucket using Boto3.\n\n6. Set up the watchdog `Observer` to monitor the specified directory with the event handler.\n\n7. Start the observer, which will keep the script running and watching for new files indefinitely.\n\nI need to make sure that the script handles exceptions properly, especially when dealing with file uploads to S3. There might be network issues or permissions problems, so I should include try-except blocks to handle such scenarios.\n\nAlso, I should consider logging to provide feedback to the user about what's happening. For example, logging when a new file is detected and when it's successfully uploaded or if there was an error during upload.\n\nLet me think about how to implement the S3 upload. I'll need to create an S3 client using Boto3, and then use the `upload_file` method to upload the file from the local path to the S3 bucket.\n\nI should also consider the file name in S3. Maybe allow the user to specify a prefix or use the original file name. For simplicity, I'll use the original file name for now.\n\nWait, but if there are multiple files with the same name in different subdirectories, that could be an issue since S3 keys are flat. Maybe I should include the full path in the S3 key to preserve the directory structure.\n\nThat sounds like a good idea. So, the S3 key would be something like `<subdirectory>/filename.ext`.\n\nLet me think about how to construct the S3 key. I can get the relative path of the new file compared to the watched directory and use that as the S3 key.\n\nFor example, if the watched directory is `/path/to/watch` and a new file is created at `/path/to/watch/subdir/newfile.txt`, then the S3 key would be `subdir/newfile.txt`.\n\nTo get the relative path, I can use `os.path.relpath` function.\n\nNow, regarding the event handler. I need to make sure that only new files trigger the upload, not directories or other types of events. So, I should check if the created item is a file before attempting to upload it.\n\nAlso, I should consider that files might be temporarily present if they're being written to. Maybe there's a way to ensure the file is fully written before uploading it.\n\nI recall that watchdog's `on_created` event is triggered as soon as the file is created, but the file might still be open and being written to. So, I need to make sure that the file is closed and no longer being written to before attempting to upload it.\n\nI'm not sure how to reliably detect that a file is fully written in a cross-platform way. Maybe I can just attempt to upload the file and handle any errors that occur if the file is still being written to.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can wait for a short period after the file is created to allow it to be fully written. But that's not a great solution because the time needed can vary.\n\nHmm, this might be a complication. For now, I'll proceed with uploading the file immediately when it's created and handle any errors that occur during upload.\n\nNow, let's think about the argument parsing. I need at least two arguments: the directory to watch and the S3 bucket name.\n\nI should also consider adding optional arguments, like the S3 prefix, so that the user can specify a subdirectory in the S3 bucket to upload the files to.\n\nFor example, if the user specifies `--prefix \"uploads/\"`, then the files would be uploaded to `uploads/subdir/newfile.txt`.\n\nThat could be a useful feature.\n\nAlso, maybe an option to specify the AWS profile to use, in case the user has multiple profiles configured.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll focus on requiring just the directory and bucket name for now.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the event handler's `on_created` method:\n\n1. Check if the created item is a file.\n\n2. Construct the S3 key using the relative path.\n\n3. Attempt to upload the file to S3 using Boto3's `upload_file` method.\n\n4. Log success or failure appropriately.\n\nNow, for the observer setup:\n\n1. Create an instance of the event handler.\n\n2. Create an `Observer` object.\n\n3. Schedule the observer to watch the specified directory with the event handler.\n\n4. Start the observer, which will run indefinitely until interrupted.\n\nI should also consider how to handle the script being interrupted, maybe adding a way to gracefully stop the observer.\n\nPerhaps using keyboard interrupts (Ctrl+C) to stop the script.\n\nIn that case, I can wrap the observer start method in a try-except block for `KeyboardInterrupt`, and then stop the observer before exiting.\n\nAlright, I think I have a plan. Let me start writing some pseudocode to outline the script.\n\nFirst, import the necessary modules:\n\n```python\n\nimport argparse\n\nimport logging\n\nimport boto3\n\nfrom watchdog.observers import Observer\n\nfrom watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler\n\nimport os\n\n```\n\nSet up logging:\n\n```python\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO,\n\nformat='%(asctime)s - %(message)s')\n\n```\n\nDefine the event handler class:\n\n```python\n\nclass UploadHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):\n\ndef __init__(self, bucket_name):\n\nself.bucket_name = bucket_name\n\nself.s3 = boto3.client('s3')\n\ndef on_created(self, event):\n\nif event.is_directory:\n\nreturn\n\nrelative_path = os.path.relpath(event.src_path, start=self.watch_dir)\n\nself.upload_file(event.src_path, relative_path)\n\ndef upload_file(self, file_path, s3_key):\n\ntry:\n\nself.s3.upload_file(file_path, self.bucket_name, s3_key)\n\nlogging.info(f'Uploaded {file_path} to s3://{self.bucket_name}/{s3_key}')\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n\nlogging.error(f'Failed to upload {file_path}: {e}')\n\n```\n\nSet up argument parsing:\n\n```python\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Watch a directory and upload new files to S3.')\n\nparser.add_argument('directory', help='Directory to watch')\n\nparser.add_argument('bucket', help='S3 bucket name')\n\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n\n```\n\nSet up and start the observer:\n\n```python\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n\nevent_handler = UploadHandler(bucket_name=args.bucket)\n\nobserver = Observer()\n\nobserver.schedule(event_handler, path=args.directory, recursive=True)\n\nobserver.start()\n\nlogging.info(f'Watching {args.directory} for new files. Uploads will go to s3://{args.bucket}/')\n\ntry:\n\nwhile True:\n\npass\n\nexcept KeyboardInterrupt:\n\nobserver.stop()\n\nlogging.info('Stopped watching.')\n\nobserver.join()\n\n```\n\nWait, I need to set the `watch_dir` attribute in the event handler so that I can compute the relative path.\n\nI should pass the watch directory to the event handler when initializing it.\n\nLet me adjust the code accordingly.\n\nModify the event handler class:\n\n```python\n\nclass UploadHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):\n\ndef __init__(self, bucket_name, watch_dir):\n\nself.bucket_name = bucket_name\n\nself.watch_dir = watch_dir\n\nself.s3 = boto3.client('s3')\n\ndef on_created(self, event):\n\nif event.is_directory:\n\nreturn\n\nrelative_path = os.path.relpath(event.src_path, start=self.watch_dir)\n\nself.upload_file(event.src_path, relative_path)\n\ndef upload_file(self, file_path, s3_key):\n\ntry:\n\nself.s3.upload_file(file_path, self.bucket_name, s3_key)\n\nlogging.info(f'Uploaded {file_path} to s3://{self.bucket_name}/{s3_key}')\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n\nlogging.error(f'Failed to upload {file_path}: {e}')\n\n```\n\nAnd modify the observer setup:\n\n```python\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n\nevent_handler = UploadHandler(bucket_name=args.bucket, watch_dir=args.directory)\n\nobserver = Observer()\n\nobserver.schedule(event_handler, path=args.directory, recursive=True)\n\nobserver.start()\n\nlogging.info(f'Watching {args.directory} for new files. Uploads will go to s3://{args.bucket}/')\n\ntry:\n\nwhile True:\n\npass\n\nexcept KeyboardInterrupt:\n\nobserver.stop()\n\nlogging.info('Stopped watching.')\n\nobserver.join()\n\n```\n\nThis looks better. Now, the event handler knows the watch directory and can compute the relative path for each new file.\n\nI should also consider if there are any permissions issues. Make sure that the AWS credentials have the necessary permissions to upload objects to the specified S3 bucket.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that the script has the necessary permissions to read the files in the watched directory.\n\nI might want to add some checks to make sure that the directory exists and is accessible before starting the watcher.\n\nLet me add some checks in the main block:\n\n```python\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Watch a directory and upload new files to S3.')\n\nparser.add_argument('directory', help='Directory to watch')\n\nparser.add_argument('bucket', help='S3 bucket name')\n\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n\nif not os.path.isdir(args.directory):\n\nprint(f'Error: {args.directory} is not a valid directory.')\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\nevent_handler = UploadHandler(bucket_name=args.bucket, watch_dir=args.directory)\n\nobserver = Observer()\n\nobserver.schedule(event_handler, path=args.directory, recursive=True)\n\nobserver.start()\n\nlogging.info(f'Watching {args.directory} for new files. Uploads will go to s3://{args.bucket}/')\n\ntry:\n\nwhile True:\n\npass\n\nexcept KeyboardInterrupt:\n\nobserver.stop()\n\nlogging.info('Stopped watching.')\n\nobserver.join()\n\n```\n\nI should also import `sys` to use `sys.exit`.\n\nNow, if the specified directory doesn't exist or isn't a directory, the script will exit with an error message.\n\nI should also consider adding more logging information, like when the script starts watching the directory, or when it stops.\n\nMaybe log some initial information, like the version of the script or something, but that might be overkill for now.\n\nI should test this script in a controlled environment. Create a test directory, add some files to it, and see if they get uploaded to the specified S3 bucket.\n\nI should also test uploading files to a subdirectory within the watched directory to ensure that the relative path is correctly handled.\n\nAnother thing to consider is file types and sizes. Make sure that the script can handle different file types and reasonably large files.\n\nI should also think about error handling in the upload process. For example, if the S3 bucket doesn't exist or if there are permission issues, the script should log meaningful error messages.\n\nMaybe I can add some initial check to see if the S3 bucket exists, but that might not be straightforward with Boto3, as checking for bucket existence can be tricky due to eventually consistent DNS propagation.\n\nAlternatively, I can just attempt the upload and handle the exceptions that might occur.\n\nI think handling exceptions in the `upload_file` method is sufficient for now.\n\nAnother potential issue is that if a file is being uploaded and the script is interrupted, the upload might be incomplete. S3 uploads are resumable, but in this script, each upload is a single operation.\n\nTo handle large files or unreliable connections, I might want to look into using multipart uploads with Boto3, which allow uploading large files in parts and resuming uploads if necessary.\n\nHowever, that complicates the script, so for now, I'll stick with the simple `upload_file` method.\n\nIf time permits, I can look into adding multipart uploads later.\n\nNow, let me think about how to run this script. It should be run from the command line, providing the directory and bucket name.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n\npython watch_and_upload.py /path/to/watch my-s3-bucket\n\n```\n\nI should make sure that the script has execute permissions or is run with `python` as shown above.\n\nI should also consider adding a option for verbose logging, so users can see more detailed information if they want.\n\nI can add a `--verbose` flag to the argument parser that sets the log level to DEBUG.\n\nLet me add that.\n\nFirst, import `logging`.\n\nThen, modify the argument parser:\n\n```python\n\nparser.add_argument('--verbose', action='store_true', help='Enable verbose logging')\n\n```\n\nAnd set the logging level based on the verbose flag:\n\n```python\n\nif args.verbose:\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n\nelse:\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s')\n\n```\n\nThis way, if the `--verbose` flag is provided, the logging level will be set to DEBUG, providing more detailed logs.\n\nNow, I should test the script with and without the verbose flag to ensure it works as expected.\n\nI should also consider adding a version flag, like `--version`, to display the script version, but that might be optional.\n\nFor now, I'll skip that.\n\nAnother thing to think about is whether to include any sort of rate limiting or throttling, in case a lot of files are being created in the directory simultaneously.\n\nWatchdog's observer can handle multiple events, but uploading multiple files concurrently could put pressure on the system or network.\n\nBoto3 might handle uploading multiple files in parallel, but in this script, uploads are performed sequentially.\n\nIf needed, I could look into uploading files in separate threads or processes, but that complicates the script.\n\nFor now, I'll keep it simple and upload files sequentially.\n\nI should also consider if the script should remove files after uploading them, or leave them as is.\n\nProbably, it's best to leave the files in place after uploading, in case the user needs them for other purposes.\n\nIf space is a concern, the user can choose to delete them manually or implement their own cleanup mechanism.\n\nAnother consideration is versioning in S3. If the bucket has versioning enabled, uploading the same file again will create a new version.\n\nIf versioning is not enabled, uploading the same file again will overwrite the existing object.\n\nDepending on the use case, this might be desirable or not.\n\nIn this script, since we're uploading new files as they are created, and not modifying existing files, this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nBut it's good to keep in mind.\n\nI should also think about excluding certain files from being uploaded, like temporary files or specific file types.\n\nMaybe adding an option to specify file extensions to ignore.\n\nFor example, `--exclude *.tmp` to ignore temporary files.\n\nI can add an `--exclude` argument that takes a list of file extensions to ignore.\n\nLet me think about how to implement that.\n\nI can add an `--exclude` argument that accepts a list of file extensions, like `--exclude .tmp --exclude .log`.\n\nThen, in the `on_created` method, check the file extension against the list of excluded extensions and skip uploading if it matches.\n\nI need to handle this carefully to avoid excluding files with multiple extensions, like `.tar.gz`.\n\nMaybe use the `fnmatch` module to match file patterns.\n\nLet me adjust the event handler class accordingly.\n\nFirst, modify the argument parser to accept multiple `--exclude` options:\n\n```python\n\nparser.add_argument('--exclude', action='append', help='File extensions to exclude (e.g., .tmp)')\n\n```\n\nThen, in the `UploadHandler` class, accept the exclude list in the constructor:\n\n```python\n\nclass UploadHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):\n\ndef __init__(self, bucket_name, watch_dir, exclude=None):\n\nself.bucket_name = bucket_name\n\nself.watch_dir = watch_dir\n\nself.exclude = exclude if exclude else []\n\nself.s3 = boto3.client('s3')\n\ndef on_created(self, event):\n\nif event.is_directory:\n\nreturn\n\nfile_path = event.src_path\n\nfile_name = os.path.basename(file_path)\n\nif any(fnmatch.fnmatch(file_name, pattern) for pattern in self.exclude):\n\nlogging.debug(f'Skipping excluded file: {file_path}')\n\nreturn\n\nrelative_path = os.path.relpath(file_path, start=self.watch_dir)\n\nself.upload_file(file_path, relative_path)\n\ndef upload_file(self, file_path, s3_key):\n\ntry:\n\nself.s3.upload_file(file_path, self.bucket_name, s3_key)\n\nlogging.info(f'Uploaded {file_path} to s3://{self.bucket_name}/{s3_key}')\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n\nlogging.error(f'Failed to upload {file_path}: {e}')\n\n```\n\nI need to import `fnmatch`:\n\n```python\n\nimport fnmatch\n\n```\n\nNow, the script can exclude specified file extensions from being uploaded.\n\nThis should cover most use cases for excluding certain files.\n\nI should test this feature by creating files with excluded extensions and verifying that they are not uploaded.\n\nAnother feature to consider is dry-run mode, where the script logs what it would upload without actually uploading anything.\n\nThis can be useful for testing and verifying configurations without affecting actual data.\n\nI can add a `--dry-run` flag to enable this behavior.\n\nIn dry-run mode, the `upload_file` method would just log the action without performing the upload.\n\nLet me add that.\n\nFirst, add the `--dry-run` argument:\n\n```python\n\nparser.add_argument('--dry-run', action='store_true', help='Only log actions without uploading files')\n\n```\n\nThen, modify the `UploadHandler` class to accept the `dry_run` flag and adjust the `upload_file` method accordingly:\n\n```python\n\nclass UploadHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):\n\ndef __init__(self, bucket_name, watch_dir, exclude=None, dry_run=False):\n\nself.bucket_name = bucket_name\n\nself.watch_dir = watch_dir\n\nself.exclude = exclude if exclude else []\n\nself.dry_run = dry_run\n\nself.s3 = boto3.client('s3') if not dry_run else None\n\ndef on_created(self, event):\n\nif event.is_directory:\n\nreturn\n\nfile_path = event.src_path\n\nfile_name = os.path.basename(file_path)\n\nif any(fnmatch.fnmatch(file_name, pattern) for pattern in self.exclude):\n\nlogging.debug(f'Skipping excluded file: {file_path}')\n\nreturn\n\nrelative_path = os.path.relpath(file_path, start=self.watch_dir)\n\nif self.dry_run:\n\nlogging.info(f'Dry run: Would upload {file_path} to s3://{self.bucket_name}/{relative_path}')\n\nelse:\n\nself.upload_file(file_path, relative_path)\n\ndef upload_file(self, file_path, s3_key):\n\ntry:\n\nself.s3.upload_file(file_path, self.bucket_name, s3_key)\n\nlogging.info(f'Uploaded {file_path} to s3://{self.bucket_name}/{s3_key}')\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n\nlogging.error(f'Failed to upload {file_path}: {e}')\n\n```\n\nIn dry-run mode, the S3 client isn't created, and a log message is printed instead of uploading the file.\n\nThis should suffice for testing purposes.\n\nNow, I need to pass the `dry_run` flag to the event handler when creating it.\n\nModify the main block:\n\n```python\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\nimport sys\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Watch a directory and upload new files to S3.')\n\nparser.add_argument('directory', help='Directory to watch')\n\nparser.add_argument('bucket', help='S3 bucket

seconds\n\nfor attempt in range(1, max_retries + 1):\n\ntry:\n\nself.s3.upload_file(file_path, self.bucket_name, s3_key)\n\nlogging.info(f'Uploaded {file_path} to s3://{self.bucket_name}/{s3_key}')\n\nreturn\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n\nif attempt < max_retries:\n\nlogging.warning(f'Attempt {attempt} to upload {file_path} failed: {e}. Retrying in {retry_delay} seconds.')\n\ntime.sleep(retry_delay)\n\nelse:\n\nlogging.error(f'Failed to upload {file_path} after {max_retries} attempts: {e}')\n\nbreak\n\n```\n\nI need to import `time` for the sleep function.\n\nThis way, the script will retry uploading the file up to 3 times with a 5-second delay between attempts before logging a failure.\n\nThis should help handle transient errors.\n\nI can make the retry logic more sophisticated if needed, but this should suffice for now.\n\nNow, I should test the retry mechanism by intentionally causing upload failures and verifying that the script retries the upload.\n\nI should also consider adding options to configure the number of retries and the delay between retries, but that might complicate the script.\n\nFor now, hardcoded values should be acceptable.\n\nAnother potential improvement is to calculate and log the upload speed or the file size uploaded, but that's optional and might not be necessary for the basic functionality.\n\nI should also think about whether to include any sort of progress bar during uploads, but that could be challenging with watchdog's event-driven approach.\n\nFor now, I'll skip that feature.\n\nI should also ensure that the script can handle large files without running out of memory.\n\nBoto3's `upload_file` method is designed to handle large files efficiently using multipart uploads under the hood, so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that all the necessary imports are included at the beginning of the script.\n\nHere's the list of imports I've used so far:\n\n- `argparse`\n\n- `logging`\n\n- `boto3`\n\n- `watchdog.observers.Observer`\n\n- `watchdog.events.FileSystemEventHandler`\n\n- `os`\n\n- `sys`\n\n- `fnmatch`\n\n- `time`\n\nI should include all of these at the beginning of the script.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n```python\n\nimport argparse\n\nimport logging\n\nimport boto3\n\nfrom watchdog.observers import Observer\n\nfrom watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler\n\nimport os\n\nimport sys\n\nimport fnmatch\n\nimport time\n\n```\n\nNow, I should write the complete script, incorporating all the features and improvements we've discussed.\n\nI'll also add some comments for clarity.\n\nHere's the complete script:\n\n```python\n\nimport argparse\n\nimport logging\n\nimport boto3\n\nfrom watchdog.observers import Observer\n\nfrom watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler\n\nimport os\n\nimport sys\n\nimport fnmatch\n\nimport time\n\nclass UploadHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):\n\ndef __init__(self, bucket_name, watch_dir, exclude=None, dry_run=False, prefix=None):\n\nself.bucket_name = bucket_name\n\nself.watch_dir = watch_dir\n\nself.exclude = exclude if exclude else []\n\nself.dry_run = dry_run\n\nself.prefix = prefix.rstrip('/') if prefix else ''\n\nself.s3 = boto3.client('s3') if not dry_run else None\n\ndef on_created(self, event):\n\nif event.is_directory:\n\nreturn\n\nfile_path = event.src_path\n\nfile_name = os.path.basename(file_path)\n\nif any(fnmatch.fnmatch(file_name, pattern) for pattern in self.exclude):\n\nlogging.debug(f'Skipping excluded file: {file_path}')\n\nreturn\n\nrelative_path = os.path.relpath(file_path, start=self.watch_dir)\n\ns3_key = os.path.join(self.prefix, relative_path)\n\nif self.dry_run:\n\nlogging.info(f'Dry run: Would upload {file_path} to s3://{self.bucket_name}/{s3_key}')\n\nelse:\n\nself.upload_file(file_path, s3_key)\n\ndef upload_file(self, file_path, s3_key):\n\nmax_retries = 3\n\nretry_delay = 5  # seconds\n\nfor attempt in range(1, max_retries + 1):\n\ntry:\n\nself.s3.upload_file(file_path, self.bucket_name, s3_key)\n\nlogging.info(f'Uploaded {file_path} to s3://{self.bucket_name}/{s3_key}')\n\nreturn\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n\nif attempt < max_retries:\n\nlogging.warning(f'Attempt {attempt} to upload {file_path} failed: {e}.
