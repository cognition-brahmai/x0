        "content": "So, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many people in the city own cars. The city has a population of 1,000,000 people, and 60% of them own cars. To find the number of car owners, we can calculate 60% of 1,000,000.\n\nLet me do that:\n\n60% of 1,000,000 = 0.60 \u00d7 1,000,000 = 600,000 people.\n\nSo, there are 600,000 car owners in the city.\n\nNext, we're told that the average car owner spends $200 per month on gasoline. To find the total monthly expenditure on gasoline for all car owners, we need to multiply the number of car owners by the average monthly expenditure per car owner.\n\nSo, total monthly expenditure = number of car owners \u00d7 average monthly expenditure per car owner.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal monthly expenditure = 600,000 \u00d7 200 = 120,000,000.\n\nTherefore, the total monthly expenditure on gasoline for all car owners in the city is $120,000,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120000000} \\]"
