        "content": "So here's this game where a bunch of people take turns flipping a fair coin, and the first one to get heads wins. We want to find out the probability that the third person to flip the coin will be the winner. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, since it's a fair coin, the probability of getting heads on any flip is 0.5, and tails is also 0.5. The game continues in a cycle through the group until someone gets heads.\n\nSo, for the third person to win, what needs to happen? Well, the first two people must have flipped tails, and then the third person flips heads. After that, the game ends because someone has won.\n\nWait, but there's a catch. If all three flip tails, the game goes around again, and the cycle repeats. So, it's not just about the first three flips; it could go on for multiple rounds.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nLet's denote the probability that the third person wins as P.\n\nFor the third person to win in the first round, the sequence must be: Tail, Tail, Head.\n\nThe probability of that sequence is (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.125.\n\nBut, if all three flip tails in the first round, the game restarts, and the situation is the same as the start.\n\nSo, the probability of all three flipping tails is (0.5)^3 = 0.125.\n\nIn that case, the probability that the third person wins in the first round is 0.125.\n\nBut, if all three flip tails, which happens with probability 0.125, then the game repeats, and the probability that the third person wins in the second round is again 0.125, and so on.\n\nSo, the total probability that the third person wins is the sum of the probabilities that they win in the first round, or the second round, or the third round, and so on.\n\nThis sounds like an infinite geometric series.\n\nLet\u2019s formalize it.\n\nThe probability that the third person wins in the first round is 0.125.\n\nThe probability that the game reaches the second round (i.e., all three flip tails in the first round) is 0.125, and then the probability that the third person wins in the second round is again 0.125, and so on.\n\nSo, P = 0.125 + (0.125 * 0.125) + (0.125 * 0.125 * 0.125) + ...\n\nThis is a geometric series with the first term a = 0.125 and common ratio r = 0.125.\n\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is S = a / (1 - r), provided that |r| < 1.\n\nIn this case, a = 0.125 and r = 0.125.\n\nSo, P = 0.125 / (1 - 0.125) = 0.125 / 0.875 = 1/7.\n\nWait, 0.125 divided by 0.875.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n0.125 divided by 0.875.\n\nFirst, 0.125 divided by 0.875 is the same as (1/8) divided by (7/8) = (1/8) * (8/7) = 1/7.\n\nSo, P = 1/7.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the probability that the third player wins on the first cycle.\n\nAs before, it's Tail, Tail, Head, with probability (1/2)^3 = 1/8.\n\nBut, if all three flip tails, which is also with probability 1/8, then the game repeats.\n\nSo, the total probability is P = 1/8 + (1/8)P.\n\nWait, that's different from what I did earlier.\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf the game reaches the second cycle, it's because all three flipped tails in the first cycle, which is probability 1/8, and then the situation is the same as the start.\n\nSo, P = probability of winning in the first cycle + probability of reaching the second cycle times P.\n\nSo, P = 1/8 + (1/8)P.\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, solving for P:\n\nP - (1/8)P = 1/8\n\n(7/8)P = 1/8\n\nP = (1/8) / (7/8) = 1/7.\n\nSo, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as the probability that the third player wins is the probability that the first two players flip tails and the third flips heads, and this sequence occurs before any earlier player flips heads.\n\nGiven that, P = (1/2)^3 / (1 - (1/2)^3) = (1/8) / (7/8) = 1/7.\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, since the game is memoryless, and each cycle is independent, the probability that the third player wins is 1/7, assuming there are three players.\n\nBut, if there are more than three players, this would change.\n\nWait, the question says \"a group of people\", but doesn't specify how many.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, let's read the question again: \"A group of people are playing a game where they take turns flipping a fair coin. The first person who flips heads wins the game. What is the probability that the third person to flip the coin will be the winner?\"\n\nIt doesn't specify how many people are in the group, just that they take turns in some order, and the third person is the one we're interested in.\n\nBut, typically, in such problems, if it's a group of people taking turns in a cycle, and we're interested in the third person, it probably assumes that there are at least three people, and the turning order cycles through them.\n\nBut, to generalize, perhaps we can think in terms of the position in the turning order.\n\nLet\u2019s assume there are n players, taking turns in a cycle, and we want the probability that the third player in the cycle wins.\n\nBut, the question doesn't specify n, so maybe it's assumed to be three.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a infinite cycle, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, probably it's a group of at least three people, and we're to find the probability that the third person in the turning order wins.\n\nBut, to keep it simple, perhaps it's a group of three people, taking turns in a cycle: first, second, third, first, etc.\n\nIf that's the case, then as I calculated earlier, P = 1/7.\n\nBut, to confirm, let's think differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the probability that the first player wins.\n\nFor the first player to win, they need to flip heads on their first turn, or on their first turn in the second cycle, and so on.\n\nThe probability that the first player wins is P1 = 1/2 + (1/2)^3 * 1/2 + (1/2)^6 * 1/2 + ... = (1/2) / (1 - (1/2)^3) = (1/2)/(7/8) = 4/7.\n\nSimilarly, the second player wins if they flip heads on their first turn, or on their first turn in the second cycle, etc.\n\nP2 = (1/2)^2 * 1/2 + (1/2)^5 * 1/2 + ... = (1/8) / (1 - 1/8) = (1/8)/(7/8) = 1/7.\n\nSimilarly, P3 = (1/2)^3 * 1/2 + (1/2)^6 * 1/2 + ... = (1/16) / (1 - 1/8) = (1/16)/(7/8) = 1/14.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right, because earlier I got P3 = 1/7.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nLet me recalculate P3.\n\nP3 = probability that the third player wins.\n\nFor that, the first two must flip tails, and then the third flips heads, or all three flip tails and then the cycle repeats, and again the third player has their turn.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, since the first player has P1 = 4/7, second has P2 = 2/7, and third has P3 = 1/7, summing up to 1.\n\nWait, 4/7 + 2/7 + 1/7 = 7/7 = 1.\n\nBut, in my earlier calculation, I had P3 = 1/7.\n\nBut, according to this new calculation, P3 = 1/7.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I thought P3 = 1/7, and in this approach, it's also 1/7.\n\nBut, in the second approach, P1 = 4/7, P2 = 2/7, P3 = 1/7.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up to 1 if there are more than three players.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify the number of players.\n\nAssuming there are only three players, then P1 + P2 + P3 = 4/7 + 2/7 + 1/7 = 7/7 = 1, which is correct.\n\nBut, if there are more than three players, this would need adjustment.\n\nBut, given that the question refers to the \"third person to flip the coin\", it probably assumes there are at least three players.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's an infinite number of players, but that seems unnecessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a group of three.\n\nGiven that, P3 = 1/7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"third person to flip the coin\" refers to the person who flips third, regardless of the group size.\n\nBut, in that case, the calculation would be similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a group of three, and the third person is the one in question.\n\nIn that case, P3 = 1/7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the group is larger, say n players, and we want the probability that the third player in the sequence wins.\n\nIn that case, the calculation would be different.\n\nBut, without specification, perhaps it's safe to assume three players.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"third person to flip the coin\" is in a sequence without cycling back, but that seems unlikely, as the question mentions \"take turns\".\n\nGiven that, I think it's safe to assume three players, cycling through their turns, and we want the probability that the third player wins, which is P3 = 1/7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a formula for this.\n\nWait, in a sequence of coin flips, the probability that the k-th player wins is p_k = (1 - p)^(k-1) * p / (1 - (1 - p)^n), where p is the probability of heads, and n is the number of players.\n\nBut, in this case, p = 0.5.\n\nIf n = 3, then p3 = (1 - 0.5)^2 * 0.5 / (1 - (1 - 0.5)^3) = (0.25 * 0.5) / (1 - 0.125) = 0.125 / 0.875 = 1/7.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the third person to flip the coin will be the winner is 1/7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{7}} \\]"
