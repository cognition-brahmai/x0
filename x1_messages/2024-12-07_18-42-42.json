        "content": "Dear Alex,\n\nI hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. It's been a long time since we've spoken, hasn't it? I've been doing some soul-searching lately and I feel the need to reach out to you, to reconnect and perhaps heal some old wounds.\n\nFirstly, I want to apologize for any pain or hurt I may have caused you in the past. I was young and foolish, and I acted without thinking about the consequences. I hope that with time, you've been able to forgive me.\n\nBut that's not the only reason I'm writing to you today. There's something important that I need to share with you, something that our family has kept hidden for decades. It's a secret that I believe we both have a right to know, and perhaps, to come to terms with.\n\nOur mother, God bless her soul, was not biologically related to us. I know that must come as a shock, but it's the truth. Our biological mother passed away during childbirth, and our father couldn't bear to raise us alone. So, he married our mother, who was a close family friend, and she agreed to raise us as her own.\n\nI found out about this when I was going through some old letters after her passing. At first, I was angry and confused. How could they keep something like this from us? But as I thought about it more, I realized that they probably did it to protect us, to give us a stable and loving family environment without the complications of biology.\n\nI've been struggling with this revelation ever since I found out. It makes me question my identity, my roots, and who I really am. I've been thinking that maybe, just maybe, knowing the truth could help me find some closure.\n\nThat's why I'm writing to you, Alex. I think it's important that we talk about this together, support each other through this discovery. Maybe, together, we can piece together the truth about our past and find peace.\n\nI understand if you're angry or upset with me for bringing this up now, after all these years. But please, consider meeting me somewhere neutral, where we can have an open and honest conversation without any judgment.\n\nI miss you, Alex. I miss the brother I once knew, the one who would play pranks on me and protect me from bullies. I miss our laughter and our fights. I miss being part of a family.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nWith love and hope,\n\nLily"
