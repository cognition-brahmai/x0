It was indeed invented in 1903 by Elizabeth Magie, who created it to demonstrate the negative aspects of concentrating land in private monopolies. The game's objective is to become the wealthiest player through buying, renting, and trading properties, ultimately forcing opponents into bankruptcy. Over the years, Monopoly has become one of the most popular board games worldwide, with numerous editions and variations reflecting different themes and locales."
