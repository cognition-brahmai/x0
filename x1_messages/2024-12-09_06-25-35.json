        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains: one leaving Town A for Town B at 60 mph, and the other leaving Town B for Town A at 90 mph. The distance between the towns is 300 miles. I need to find out how far apart they'll be after 1 hour.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much distance each train covers in that hour.\n\nThe first train is going at 60 mph, so in one hour, it would cover 60 miles.\n\nThe second train is faster, at 90 mph, so it would cover 90 miles in one hour.\n\nNow, since they're moving towards each other, the distance between them should decrease by the sum of what both have traveled.\n\nSo, in one hour, the total distance they cover together is 60 miles + 90 miles = 150 miles.\n\nInitially, they were 300 miles apart. So, after one hour, the distance between them should be 300 miles minus 150 miles, which is 150 miles.\n\nWait, but the question asks for how far apart they will be after one hour. Is it that simple?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nTrain from A to B: 60 mph \u2192 60 miles in 1 hour.\n\nTrain from B to A: 90 mph \u2192 90 miles in 1 hour.\n\nTotal distance covered towards each other: 60 + 90 = 150 miles.\n\nInitial distance: 300 miles.\n\nSo, remaining distance: 300 - 150 = 150 miles.\n\nYeah, that seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if they pass each other or something. Do they meet within that hour?\n\nLet's see, they're covering 150 miles together in one hour, and the total distance is 300 miles. So, in two hours, they would have covered 300 miles together and would meet.\n\nBut the question is about the distance after one hour, so yes, it should be 150 miles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of their relative speed.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is 60 + 90 = 150 mph.\n\nSo, in one hour, at relative speed of 150 mph, they would cover 150 miles towards each other.\n\nThus, the remaining distance is 300 - 150 = 150 miles.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem?\n\nPerhaps using the concept of time to meet.\n\nTime to meet = total distance / relative speed = 300 / 150 = 2 hours.\n\nBut again, we're interested in the distance after one hour, which is indeed 150 miles.\n\nI think 150 miles is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
