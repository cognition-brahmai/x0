        "content": "So, I have this problem here. A company makes two products, A and B. Product A needs 3 hours of labor per unit, and product B needs 2 hours per unit. The company has 120 hours of labor available. I need to find out the maximum number of units they can produce in total.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's not specifying how many of each product they want to make, just the maximum total units regardless of the mix of A and B.\n\nSo, to maximize the total units, I should aim to produce as many of the product that requires less labor per unit as possible, because that way, each hour of labor is producing more units.\n\nProduct A requires 3 hours per unit, and product B requires 2 hours per unit. So, B requires less labor per unit. Therefore, to maximize the total number of units, I should produce as many B's as possible with the 120 hours available.\n\nLet me calculate how many units of B can be produced with 120 hours.\n\nEach B takes 2 hours, so 120 hours divided by 2 hours per unit gives 60 units of B.\n\nSo, if they only produce B, they can make 60 units.\n\nBut the question is about the maximum number of units, regardless of the product mix. So, is there a way to produce a combination of A and B to get more than 60 total units?\n\nWait a minute, if they produce some A's, which take more time, that would leave less labor for B's. Since A takes 3 hours and B takes 2, for every hour spent on A instead of B, they're getting fewer units.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose they produce x units of A and y units of B.\n\nThen, the total labor used is 3x + 2y \u2264 120 hours.\n\nAnd the total units produced are x + y.\n\nI need to maximize x + y, subject to 3x + 2y \u2264 120.\n\nThis is a linear programming problem, but since it's just two variables, I can probably solve it graphically or by considering the extremes.\n\nOne extreme is producing only A's. If they only produce A's, then with 120 hours, they can make 120 / 3 = 40 units of A.\n\nThe other extreme is producing only B's, which is 120 / 2 = 60 units of B.\n\nSo, the total units in these cases are 40 and 60, respectively.\n\nIs there a combination in between that gives more than 60 total units?\n\nLet's see. Suppose they produce some A's and some B's.\n\nFor example, if they produce 10 units of A, that would take 3 * 10 = 30 hours.\n\nThen, with the remaining 90 hours, they can produce 90 / 2 = 45 units of B.\n\nTotal units: 10 + 45 = 55, which is less than 60.\n\nOr, if they produce 20 units of A, that's 60 hours, leaving 60 hours for B, which is 30 units of B.\n\nTotal units: 20 + 30 = 50, which is less than 60.\n\nOr, if they produce 5 units of A, that's 15 hours, leaving 105 hours for B, which is 52.5 units.\n\nBut since they can't produce half units, maybe 52 units.\n\nTotal units: 5 + 52 = 57, still less than 60.\n\nIt seems like the more A's they produce, the lower the total units become.\n\nSo, producing only B's gives the maximum total units of 60.\n\nBut is there a mathematical way to confirm this?\n\nLet's set up the equation.\n\nWe have 3x + 2y \u2264 120.\n\nWe want to maximize z = x + y.\n\nLet me solve for y in terms of x from the labor constraint:\n\n2y \u2264 120 - 3x\n\ny \u2264 (120 - 3x)/2\n\nThen, z = x + y \u2264 x + (120 - 3x)/2\n\nSimplify that:\n\nz \u2264 x + 60 - (3x)/2\n\nz \u2264 60 + x - (3x)/2\n\nz \u2264 60 - (x)/2\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if x increases, z decreases, which makes sense given what I saw earlier.\n\nBut according to this, z decreases as x increases, which aligns with my earlier observations.\n\nSo, to maximize z, x should be as small as possible.\n\nThe smallest x can be is 0, assuming they can choose not to produce any A's.\n\nTherefore, maximum z is 60 - (0)/2 = 60.\n\nSo, the maximum total units is 60, by producing only B's.\n\nBut let's think about whether there's a way to get more than 60 total units.\n\nSuppose they decide to produce fractional units.\n\nFor example, if they produce 20 units of A, which takes 60 hours, and with the remaining 60 hours, they produce 30 units of B.\n\nTotal units: 20 + 30 = 50.\n\nLess than 60.\n\nOr, if they produce 10 units of A, taking 30 hours, and 45 units of B with the remaining 90 hours.\n\nTotal units: 10 + 45 = 55.\n\nStill less than 60.\n\nOr, if they produce 5 units of A, taking 15 hours, and 52 units of B with 105 hours.\n\nTotal units: 5 + 52 = 57.\n\nStill less.\n\nAlternatively, if they produce 40 units of A, taking 120 hours, and 0 units of B.\n\nTotal units: 40.\n\nWhich is less than 60.\n\nSo, it seems that producing only B's gives the maximum total units.\n\nBut let's consider if they can produce a combination where they use the labor more efficiently.\n\nSuppose they produce x units of A and y units of B such that 3x + 2y = 120.\n\nAnd we want to maximize x + y.\n\nLet me solve for y in terms of x:\n\ny = (120 - 3x)/2\n\nThen, z = x + y = x + (120 - 3x)/2 = x + 60 - (3x)/2 = 60 + x - (3x)/2 = 60 - (x)/2\n\nSo, z = 60 - (x)/2\n\nThis equation shows that z decreases as x increases.\n\nTherefore, to maximize z, x should be as small as possible.\n\nThe smallest x can be is 0, so z = 60 - 0 = 60.\n\nTherefore, the maximum total units is 60, achieved by producing only B's.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any constraint I'm missing.\n\nThe problem says \"the maximum number of units they can produce.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify that they have to use all 120 hours. Maybe they can use less labor and still maximize the units.\n\nBut typically, in such problems, they assume that the company wants to use all available labor.\n\nHowever, let's consider if they don't use all the labor.\n\nFor example, if they use only 100 hours, producing only B's, they can make 100 / 2 = 50 units.\n\nWhich is less than 60.\n\nOr, if they use only 80 hours, producing only B's, 40 units.\n\nStill less than 60.\n\nSo, it's better to use all available labor to maximize units.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion remains that producing only B's with all 120 hours gives the maximum total units of 60.\n\nAlternatively, if they produce some A's, the total units decrease, as shown earlier.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of units they can produce is 60, by producing only product B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
