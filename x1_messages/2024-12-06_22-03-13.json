        "content": "Sure! I'd be happy to help you find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 1. We'll be using the basic rules of differentiation here, specifically the power rule, which states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n*x^(n-1). We'll apply this rule to each term in the function.\n\nSo, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's write down the function again:\n\nf(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 1\n\nNow, we'll differentiate each term one by one.\n\n1. Differentiating x^3:\n\nAccording to the power rule, the derivative of x^n is n*x^(n-1). Here, n = 3.\n\nSo, the derivative of x^3 is 3*x^(3-1) = 3x^2.\n\n2. Differentiating -4x^2:\n\nAgain, using the power rule, the derivative of x^2 is 2x. But since there's a coefficient of -4, we'll multiply the derivative by -4.\n\nSo, the derivative of -4x^2 is -4 * 2x = -8x.\n\n3. Differentiating 6x:\n\nThe power rule tells us that the derivative of x is 1. So, the derivative of 6x is 6*1 = 6.\n\n4. Differentiating -1:\n\nThe derivative of a constant is zero. So, the derivative of -1 is 0.\n\nNow, let's put it all together.\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 6 + 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 6\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 1 is f'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 6.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
