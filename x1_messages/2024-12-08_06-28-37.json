        "content": "So the factory currently produces 100 units every day. If they increase their production by 50%, how many units will they produce daily?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. A 50% increase means they're adding half of their current production to the original amount. So, half of 100 units is 50 units. Therefore, if they add that to their original production, they should be making 100 units plus 50 units, which equals 150 units daily.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Percentage increase is calculated by taking the percentage of the original amount and adding it to the original. So, 50% of 100 is indeed 50. Adding that to 100 gives 150. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that you can multiply the original amount by 1 plus the percentage increase in decimal form. So, 100 multiplied by 1 plus 0.5 (which is 50%) would be 100 times 1.5, which also equals 150. That matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident it's correct.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Suppose they increase production by 50%, does that mean they're producing one and a half times the original amount? Yes, that makes sense. So, again, 1.5 times 100 is 150.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The factory will produce 150 units daily after a 50% increase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
