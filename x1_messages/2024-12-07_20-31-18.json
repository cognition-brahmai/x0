        "content": "So there's this family gathering with 20 people, and among them, there are 5 sets of twins. That means there are 5 pairs of people who are twins. Now, everyone shakes hands exactly once with every other person in the room, but I need to find out how many handshakes take place between non-twins.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes a handshake between non-twins. I think it means that neither of the two people shaking hands is a twin of the other. So, if person A is a twin of person B, then A shaking hands with C, where C is not B, would be a handshake between non-twins, provided that C is not a twin themselves or something like that. Wait, no, I think it's simpler: as long as the two people shaking hands are not twins of each other, it's a handshake between non-twins.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be the total possible handshakes minus the handshakes between twins.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total number of possible handshakes if there were no restrictions. In a group of n people, where each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, the total number of handshakes is given by the combination formula C(n, 2), which is n(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, for 20 people, the total number of handshakes is 20*19/2 = 190.\n\nNow, among these 20 people, there are 5 sets of twins. Each set of twins consists of 2 people who are shaking hands with each other. So, there are 5 handshakes that take place between twins.\n\nTherefore, the number of handshakes between non-twins would be the total handshakes minus the handshakes between twins, which is 190 - 5 = 185.\n\nWait a minute, is it that straightforward? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as first excluding the handshakes between twins. So, if there are 5 sets of twins, that means there are 5 pairs who do not shake hands with each other, but in this problem, they do shake hands. Wait, no, the problem says \"each person shakes hands exactly once with every other person,\" which includes twins shaking hands with each other.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misread. Let me read the problem again: \"In a family gathering, there are 20 people. Among them, there are 5 sets of twins. If each person shakes hands exactly once with every other person in the room, how many handshakes take place between non-twins?\"\n\nSo, everyone shakes hands with everyone else, including twins shaking hands with each other and with non-twins.\n\nSo, total handshakes are 190, as calculated earlier.\n\nNow, handshakes between twins are only those between the two twins in each set. Since there are 5 sets of twins, there are 5 such handshakes.\n\nTherefore, handshakes between non-twins would be total handshakes minus handshakes between twins, which is 190 - 5 = 185.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as only considering the handshakes where at least one of the two people is not a twin, or more precisely, where the two people are not twins of each other.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, since the twins are still shaking hands with each other, and we need to exclude those to find the handshakes between non-twins.\n\nI think my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate it differently.\n\nLet me consider that there are 20 people, with 5 sets of twins, meaning 10 people are twins, and 10 are not twins.\n\nWait, no, 5 sets of twins would mean 5*2 = 10 people are twins, and the remaining 10 are non-twins.\n\nSo, total people: 20\n\nTwins: 10 (in 5 sets)\n\nNon-twins: 10\n\nNow, total handshakes: 190\n\nHandshakes between twins: 5 (since each set of twins shakes hands once)\n\nTherefore, handshakes between non-twins: 190 - 5 = 185\n\nBut perhaps there's another way to think about it.\n\nLet me consider the number of handshakes where at least one of the participants is not a twin.\n\nWait, but actually, since all 20 people are involved, and 10 are twins and 10 are not, but actually, wait, in the twins, each twin is part of a pair, but they are still individuals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the total handshakes and subtract the handshakes that occur between twins.\n\nWhich is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of handshakes where both people are non-twins, or one is a twin and the other is a non-twin.\n\nSo, handshakes between two non-twins: C(10, 2) = 45\n\nHandshakes between one twin and one non-twin: 10 (twins) * 10 (non-twins) = 100\n\nWait, but that totals to 45 + 100 = 145, which is less than the 185 I got earlier.\n\nSo, there's inconsistency here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.\n\nLet me clearly define the groups.\n\nThere are 10 twins (5 sets of twins) and 10 non-twins.\n\nWait, but actually, the 10 twins are divided into 5 pairs, so each twin has one twin partner.\n\nNow, handshakes can be of three types:\n\n1. Between two non-twins.\n\n2. Between one twin and one non-twin.\n\n3. Between two twins who are partners.\n\nNow, the handshakes between non-twins are C(10, 2) = 45.\n\nHandshakes between one twin and one non-twin: 10 twins * 10 non-twins = 100.\n\nHandshakes between two twins who are partners: 5.\n\nTotal handshakes: 45 + 100 + 5 = 150.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated total handshakes as C(20, 2) = 190.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here.\n\nAh, I see the mistake.\n\nThe problem is that in the group of 10 twins, there are not only the 5 handshakes between twin pairs, but also handshakes between different twin pairs.\n\nSo, the 10 twins can shake hands with each other in C(10, 2) = 45 ways, but out of these, 5 are handshakes between twin pairs.\n\nSo, handshakes between non-twin pairs among the twins would be 45 - 5 = 40.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to approach it differently.\n\nTotal handshakes: C(20, 2) = 190.\n\nHandshakes between twin pairs: 5.\n\nHandshakes between non-twins: total handshakes - handshakes between twin pairs = 190 - 5 = 185.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried to break it down, I got a different number, which suggests I might be missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that twins do not shake hands with each other, but the problem states that each person shakes hands exactly once with every other person, including twins shaking hands with each other.\n\nWait, no, the problem clearly says \"each person shakes hands exactly once with every other person in the room,\" which includes twins shaking hands with each other.\n\nSo, total handshakes are 190, and handshakes between twins are 5, so handshakes between non-twins are 185.\n\nBut why did my earlier breakdown give me 150?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the types of handshakes.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nGroup 1: 10 non-twins.\n\nGroup 2: 10 twins, divided into 5 pairs.\n\nHandshakes within non-twins: C(10, 2) = 45.\n\nHandshakes between non-twins and twins: 10 * 10 = 100.\n\nHandshakes within twins (between twin pairs): 5.\n\nTotal handshakes: 45 + 100 + 5 = 150.\n\nBut according to the combination formula, it should be C(20, 2) = 190.\n\nSo, where are the remaining 40 handshakes?\n\nAh, I see the mistake now.\n\nThe handshakes within the group of twins are not just the 5 handshakes between twin pairs.\n\nWait, in the group of 10 twins, there are C(10, 2) = 45 handshakes in total.\n\nOut of these 45, 5 are between twin pairs, and the remaining 40 are between different twin pairs.\n\nSo, total handshakes:\n\nHandshakes within non-twins: C(10, 2) = 45.\n\nHandshakes between non-twins and twins: 10 * 10 = 100.\n\nHandshakes within twins (between different twin pairs): 40.\n\nHandshakes between twin pairs: 5.\n\nTotal: 45 + 100 + 40 + 5 = 190.\n\nWait, but now it's adding up to 190, which matches C(20, 2).\n\nNow, handshakes between non-twins would be handshakes within non-twins plus handshakes between non-twins and twins.\n\nThat is, 45 + 100 = 145.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 185.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to redefine what \"handshakes between non-twins\" means.\n\nThe problem says \"how many handshakes take place between non-twins.\"\n\nI think this means handshakes where neither of the two people is a twin.\n\nBut in my previous calculation, handshakes within non-twins are C(10, 2) = 45, and handshakes between non-twins and twins are 10 * 10 = 100.\n\nBut if \"non-twins\" means people who are not twins, then it's the 10 non-twins.\n\nSo, handshakes between non-twins would be handshakes among the 10 non-twins, which is C(10, 2) = 45.\n\nBut that seems too low compared to my earlier calculation of 185.\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion in the terminology.\n\nLet me look up the term \"twins\" in this context.\n\nIn this problem, \"twins\" refer to pairs of people who are twins, and \"non-twins\" likely refer to people who are not twins.\n\nBut wait, if there are 5 sets of twins, that accounts for 10 people, so the remaining 10 are non-twins.\n\nSo, handshakes between non-twins would be handshakes among these 10 non-twins.\n\nBut that would be C(10, 2) = 45.\n\nHowever, perhaps \"non-twins\" means any two people who are not twins of each other, which would include handshakes between non-twins and handshakes between non-twin twins.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the definition.\n\nLet me consider:\n\n- Twins: pairs of people who are twins.\n\n- Non-twins: people who are not twins.\n\nBut perhaps \"non-twins\" in the context of handshakes means handshakes where the two people are not twins of each other.\n\nSo, total handshakes: C(20, 2) = 190.\n\nHandshakes between twins: 5.\n\nTherefore, handshakes between non-twins: 190 - 5 = 185.\n\nBut in this case, handshakes between non-twins would include handshakes between non-twins and twins (as long as they are not twin pairs).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of excluding only the handshakes between twin pairs.\n\nSo, total handshakes are 190.\n\nHandshakes between twin pairs are 5.\n\nTherefore, handshakes between non-twins are 190 - 5 = 185.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if \"non-twins\" means people who are not twins, then handshakes between non-twins would be handshakes among the 10 non-twins, which is C(10, 2) = 45.\n\nBut that seems too restrictive given the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says \"how many handshakes take place between non-twins?\"\n\nI think it's referring to handshakes where the two people are not twins of each other, which would mean total handshakes minus handshakes between twin pairs.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 190 - 5 = 185.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that twins do not shake hands with each other, but the problem explicitly says \"each person shakes hands exactly once with every other person in the room,\" which includes twins shaking hands with each other.\n\nTherefore, the handshakes between twins are included in the total.\n\nHence, handshakes between non-twins are total handshakes minus handshakes between twins.\n\nSo, the answer is 185.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way to look at it.\n\nLet me consider that there are 10 non-twins and 10 twins.\n\nHandshakes between non-twins: C(10, 2) = 45.\n\nHandshakes between non-twins and twins: 10 * 10 = 100.\n\nHandshakes between twins who are not in the same pair: C(10, 2) - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40.\n\nWait, C(10, 2) is 45, which includes handshakes between twin pairs (5) and handshakes between different twin pairs (40).\n\nSo, total handshakes: 45 (non-twin handshakes) + 100 (non-twin vs. twin) + 5 (twin pair handshakes) = 150.\n\nWait, but earlier, C(20, 2) is 190, so where is the discrepancy?\n\nAh, I see the mistake.\n\nThe 100 handshakes between non-twins and twins already includes handshakes between non-twins and twins, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the 10 twins have handshakes among themselves.\n\nWait, the 10 twins can shake hands with each other in C(10, 2) = 45 ways, out of which 5 are handshakes between twin pairs.\n\nTherefore, handshakes between non-twin twins (i.e., twins who are not in the same pair) are 40.\n\nSo, total handshakes:\n\n- Handshakes between non-twins: C(10, 2) = 45.\n\n- Handshakes between non-twins and twins: 10 * 10 = 100.\n\n- Handshakes between non-twin twins: 40.\n\n- Handshakes between twin pairs: 5.\n\nTotal: 45 + 100 + 40 + 5 = 190, which matches C(20, 2).\n\nNow, handshakes between non-twins would be handshakes between non-twins and handshakes between non-twins and twins.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIf \"non-twins\" means handshakes where the two people are not twins of each other, then it would exclude only the 5 handshakes between twin pairs.\n\nTherefore, handshakes between non-twins = total handshakes - handshakes between twin pairs = 190 - 5 = 185.\n\nAlternatively, if \"non-twins\" means handshakes involving people who are not twins, then it would be handshakes among the 10 non-twins plus handshakes between non-twins and twins.\n\nHandshakes among non-twins: C(10, 2) = 45.\n\nHandshakes between non-twins and twins: 10 * 10 = 100.\n\nTotal: 45 + 100 = 145.\n\nBut this contradicts the earlier calculation.\n\nI think the confusion arises from the definition of \"non-twins.\"\n\nIf \"non-twins\" means people who are not twins, then handshakes between non-twins would be handshakes among the 10 non-twins, which is C(10, 2) = 45.\n\nHowever, if \"non-twins\" means handshakes where the two people are not twins of each other, then it would be total handshakes minus handshakes between twin pairs, which is 190 - 5 = 185.\n\nGiven the problem says \"how many handshakes take place between non-twins?\", it's more likely that it means handshakes where the two people are not twins of each other.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 185.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, perhaps I should consider the perspective of excluding only the handshakes between twin pairs.\n\nSo, total handshakes are 190.\n\nHandshakes between twin pairs are 5.\n\nTherefore, handshakes between non-twins are 190 - 5 = 185.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of combinations:\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 people who are not twins.\n\nTotal ways to choose 2 people: C(20, 2) = 190.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 people who are twins: 5.\n\nTherefore, number of ways to choose 2 people who are not twins: 190 - 5 = 185.\n\nYes, this reinforces the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 185 handshakes between non-twins.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{185} \\]"
