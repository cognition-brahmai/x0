        "content": "So I've got this series to figure out: the sum from n equals 1 to infinity of 1 over n squared. So, \u03a3(1/n\u00b2) for n=1 to \u221e. I need to determine if this thing converges or diverges. Converges means it adds up to some finite number, right? And diverges means it doesn't\u2014it either goes to infinity or oscillates or something like that.\n\nOkay, first thing I remember is that this looks a lot like a p-series. A p-series is of the form \u03a3(1/n^p), where p is some constant. In this case, p equals 2 because it's 1/n\u00b2. I think there's a rule or a theorem about p-series that can help me here.\n\nLet me think... Oh, yeah! The p-series test. I think it says that the series \u03a3(1/n^p) converges if p > 1 and diverges if p \u2264 1. Is that right? Let me double-check that. If p is greater than 1, it converges; if p is less than or equal to 1, it diverges. Yeah, that sounds familiar.\n\nSo, in this problem, p = 2, which is greater than 1. That would suggest that the series converges. But maybe I should dig a little deeper and understand why this is the case.\n\nI recall that for p-series, the convergence depends on how fast the terms decrease in size. When p > 1, the terms decrease quickly enough that the sum doesn't grow without bound. But when p \u2264 1, the terms decrease too slowly, and the sum ends up growing indefinitely.\n\nLet me consider p = 1 specifically, which is the harmonic series: \u03a3(1/n). I know that the harmonic series diverges, even though the terms approach zero. That's a classic example. So, if p = 1 diverges, and p > 1 converges, then for p = 2, it should converge.\n\nBut maybe I can find another way to confirm this. Perhaps by using the integral test. The integral test says that if you have a function f(x) that's positive, continuous, and decreasing for x \u2265 1, then the series \u03a3f(n) converges if and only if the integral from 1 to infinity of f(x) dx converges.\n\nIn this case, f(x) = 1/x\u00b2. Let's see if the integral from 1 to infinity of 1/x\u00b2 dx converges.\n\nSo, \u222b from 1 to \u221e of 1/x\u00b2 dx. This is a standard improper integral. To evaluate it, I can take the limit as t approaches infinity of \u222b from 1 to t of 1/x\u00b2 dx.\n\nThe antiderivative of 1/x\u00b2 is -1/x. So, evaluating from 1 to t, that's [-1/t] - [-1/1] = 0 - (-1) = 1.\n\nWait, as t approaches infinity, -1/t approaches 0, and at x=1, it's -1/1 = -1. So, 0 - (-1) = 1. So, the integral converges to 1.\n\nTherefore, by the integral test, the series \u03a3(1/n\u00b2) also converges.\n\nThat's good. Two ways now that suggest convergence: the p-series test and the integral test.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe by comparison to another series. For example, I know that \u03a3(1/n\u00b2) is smaller than \u03a3(1/n^1.5), which is also a convergent p-series since p=1.5 > 1.\n\nWait, actually, 1/n\u00b2 is smaller than 1/n^1.5 for n \u2265 1. But both of these series converge, so that doesn't really help me directly. Maybe comparison tests aren't the way to go here, since I'm trying to confirm convergence, and both series converge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the partial sums. The partial sum s_k = \u03a3(1/n\u00b2) from n=1 to k. If I can show that s_k approaches a finite limit as k approaches infinity, then the series converges.\n\nBut calculating s_k directly seems tricky. I think there's a formula for s_k, but I don't remember it off the top of my head. Maybe it's related to pi or something like that. I think the exact sum is pi\u00b2/6, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnyway, even if I don't know the exact sum, the fact that the partial sums are bounded above and increasing would imply that they converge to a finite limit.\n\nWait, but in this case, s_k is increasing because each term is positive, so s_k is definitely increasing. If I can show that it's bounded above, then by the monotone convergence theorem, it converges.\n\nSo, is there a way to show that s_k is bounded above? Maybe by comparing it to an integral or another series whose sum I know.\n\nActually, the integral test not only tells me that the series converges but also gives me an idea of the bound. Since the integral from 1 to infinity of 1/x\u00b2 dx equals 1, and s_k is less than 1 + \u222b from 1 to k of 1/x\u00b2 dx, which is 1 + 1 - 1/k = 2 - 1/k, which is less than 2 for all k.\n\nSo, s_k < 2 for all k, meaning the partial sums are bounded above by 2. Since s_k is increasing and bounded above, it converges.\n\nThat's another way to see it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the Cauchy criterion for series. The series converges if and only if for every epsilon > 0, there exists an N such that for all m > n > N, |s_m - s_n| < epsilon.\n\nIn other words, the difference between any two partial sums beyond a certain point is less than any positive number I choose.\n\nFor \u03a3(1/n\u00b2), s_m - s_n = \u03a3(1/k\u00b2) from k=n+1 to m.\n\nI need to show that this can be made arbitrarily small by choosing n and m sufficiently large.\n\nBut since 1/k\u00b2 gets small quickly, the sum from k=n+1 to m should get small as n increases.\n\nI think this makes sense, but it's a bit vague. Maybe I'll stick with the p-series test and the integral test for now.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I can use the ratio test. The ratio test says that if the limit as n approaches infinity of |a_{n+1}/a_n| is less than 1, then the series converges absolutely.\n\nFor \u03a3(1/n\u00b2), a_n = 1/n\u00b2, so a_{n+1}/a_n = (1/(n+1)\u00b2)/(1/n\u00b2) = n\u00b2/(n+1)\u00b2.\n\nTaking the limit as n approaches infinity of n\u00b2/(n+1)\u00b2, which is (n/n)(n/n)/((n+1)/n)((n+1)/n)) = (1)(1)/(1+1/n)(1+1/n).\n\nAs n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, so the limit is 1.\n\nSo, the ratio test is inconclusive here because the limit equals 1.\n\nHmm, that doesn't help me. Maybe I can try the root test. The root test says that if the limit as n approaches infinity of |a_n|^{1/n} is less than 1, then the series converges absolutely.\n\nFor a_n = 1/n\u00b2, |a_n|^{1/n} = (1/n\u00b2)^{1/n} = 1^{1/n}/n^{2/n} = 1/n^{2/n}.\n\nNow, what's the limit of n^{2/n} as n approaches infinity?\n\nI think n^{1/n} approaches 1 as n approaches infinity. So, n^{2/n} = (n^{1/n})\u00b2 also approaches 1\u00b2 = 1.\n\nTherefore, the limit of |a_n|^{1/n} is 1/1 = 1, which again makes the root test inconclusive.\n\nSo, the ratio test and the root test don't help here because they both give me a limit of 1.\n\nBack to the p-series test and the integral test, which both suggest convergence.\n\nMaybe I can look at some specific values to get a feel for how quickly this series converges.\n\nLet's compute some partial sums.\n\ns_1 = 1/1\u00b2 = 1\n\ns_2 = 1 + 1/4 = 1.25\n\ns_3 = 1.25 + 1/9 \u2248 1.25 + 0.1111 \u2248 1.3611\n\ns_4 = 1.3611 + 1/16 \u2248 1.3611 + 0.0625 \u2248 1.4236\n\ns_5 = 1.4236 + 1/25 \u2248 1.4236 + 0.04 = 1.4636\n\nAnd so on. It's clear that the partial sums are increasing, but the increases are getting smaller and smaller.\n\nIf I keep adding terms, it seems like they'll approach some value, but never exceed a certain bound.\n\nI've heard that this particular series converges to pi\u00b2/6, which is approximately 1.64493. But I don't need to know the exact sum for this problem; I just need to determine whether it converges or diverges.\n\nGiven all this, I'm confident that the series \u03a3(1/n\u00b2) from n=1 to infinity converges.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider what would happen if p were less than or equal to 1.\n\nFor example, if p=1, it's the harmonic series, which diverges. If p=0, the series becomes \u03a3(1/n^0) = \u03a3(1/1) = \u03a3(1), which clearly diverges because it's just adding 1 infinitely many times.\n\nSo, the boundary is at p=1; for p>1, it converges; for p\u22641, it diverges.\n\nTherefore, since p=2 > 1, the series converges.\n\nI think that's a solid conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{converges}} \\]"
