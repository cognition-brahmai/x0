        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train that goes from City A to City B at 80 km/h and comes back at 100 km/h, and the whole trip takes 5 hours. We need to find the distance between the two cities.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. We need to find the distance between City A and City B. Let's assume this distance is \\( d \\) kilometers. Since the train goes to City B and comes back to City A, the total distance for the round trip is \\( 2d \\) kilometers.\n\nHowever, the train travels to City B at 80 km/h and returns at 100 km/h, so the speeds are different for each leg of the trip. That means the time taken to go to City B and come back won't be the same.\n\nWe know that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, the time to go from City A to City B is \\( \\frac{d}{80} \\) hours, and the time to return from City B to City A is \\( \\frac{d}{100} \\) hours.\n\nThe total time for the round trip is the sum of these two times, which is given as 5 hours. So, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{80} + \\frac{d}{100} = 5\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to solve for \\( d \\).\n\nFirst, let's find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 80 and 100. The least common multiple (LCM) of 80 and 100 is 400.\n\nSo, we can rewrite each fraction with the denominator of 400:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{80} = \\frac{5d}{400}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{100} = \\frac{4d}{400}\n\\]\n\nNow, add these two fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5d}{400} + \\frac{4d}{400} = \\frac{9d}{400}\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, this sum equals 5 hours:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9d}{400} = 5\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( d \\), we can solve for \\( d \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 400 and then dividing by 9:\n\n\\[\n9d = 5 \\times 400\n\\]\n\n\\[\n9d = 2000\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{2000}{9}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd \\approx 222.22 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\nSo, the distance between City A and City B is approximately 222.22 kilometers.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{80} + \\frac{d}{100} = 5\n\\]\n\nFinding a common denominator, which is 400:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5d}{400} + \\frac{4d}{400} = \\frac{9d}{400} = 5\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\n9d = 2000\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{2000}{9} \\approx 222.22 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\nSeems correct. But maybe there's another way to approach this problem, like using the concept of average speed for the entire trip.\n\nI know that the average speed for the whole trip is the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance is \\( 2d \\), and the total time is 5 hours, so the average speed is \\( \\frac{2d}{5} \\) km/h.\n\nAlternatively, the average speed for a round trip with different speeds can be calculated using the harmonic mean of the two speeds. The formula for the average speed when the distances are the same but speeds are different is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{average speed} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{speed}_1 \\times \\text{speed}_2}{\\text{speed}_1 + \\text{speed}_2}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the speeds:\n\n\\[\n\\text{average speed} = \\frac{2 \\times 80 \\times 100}{80 + 100} = \\frac{16000}{180} = \\frac{1600}{18} = \\frac{800}{9} \\approx 88.89 \\text{ km/h}\n\\]\n\nNow, using the average speed, we can find the total distance:\n\n\\[\n\\text{total distance} = \\text{average speed} \\times \\text{total time} = \\frac{800}{9} \\times 5 = \\frac{4000}{9} \\approx 444.44 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\nWait, but the total distance should be \\( 2d \\), so if \\( 2d = \\frac{4000}{9} \\), then \\( d = \\frac{2000}{9} \\approx 222.22 \\text{ km} \\), which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is a good sign that I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of relative speeds or time ratios, but I think the approach I took is straightforward and correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this problem could be interpreted. The problem states that the train travels from City A to City B at 80 km/h and returns at 100 km/h, and the total round trip takes 5 hours. It seems clear that we're to find the one-way distance between the cities.\n\nI should also consider units. All speeds are in km/h, and time is in hours, so units are consistent, which is good.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the train makes any stops or if there's any time lost in turning around, but the problem doesn't mention any such things, so I assume the total time is just the traveling time.\n\nSo, I think my answer is correct. The distance between City A and City B is approximately 222.22 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{222.22 \\text{ km}} \\]"
