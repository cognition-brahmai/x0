        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 150 units of product A and 200 units of product B each day. Product A needs 2 hours of labor per unit, and product B needs 3 hours per unit. I need to find out the total hours of labor required daily for both products.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the labor hours for product A. Since each unit of product A requires 2 hours, and they produce 150 units, I can multiply 150 by 2. That should give me the total hours for product A.\n\nSo, 150 units * 2 hours/unit = 300 hours.\n\nNext, for product B, each unit requires 3 hours, and they produce 200 units. So, 200 units * 3 hours/unit = 600 hours.\n\nNow, to find the total labor hours required daily for both products, I need to add the hours for product A and product B together.\n\nTotal hours = hours for product A + hours for product B = 300 hours + 600 hours = 900 hours.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe by adding the hours required per unit first and then multiplying by the number of units.\n\nLet me try that. If I add the hours required per unit for both products: 2 hours (for A) + 3 hours (for B) = 5 hours per unit.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense because each product has different production quantities. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total units produced and then find some average labor hour per unit, but that seems more complicated and likely not necessary.\n\nI think my first approach is correct. Calculate the labor hours for each product separately and then sum them up.\n\nSo, total labor hours required daily are 900 hours.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me check my calculations again.\n\nFor product A: 150 units * 2 hours/unit = 300 hours.\n\nFor product B: 200 units * 3 hours/unit = 600 hours.\n\nTotal: 300 + 600 = 900 hours.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the labor hours per day required for both products together, I can set it up as:\n\nTotal hours = (units of A * hours per unit A) + (units of B * hours per unit B)\n\nWhich is exactly what I did.\n\nI don't see any errors in this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the factory requires 900 hours of labor each day to produce both products.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{900} \\]"
