        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a class of 30 students: 18 girls and 12 boys. The teacher is going to pick two students at random to work on a project together, and I need to find the probability that both of them are girls.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to remember the basic formula for probability, which is:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcomes are the pairs where both students are girls, and the total possible outcomes are all possible pairs of students that can be chosen.\n\nSo, let's start by figuring out the total number of possible pairs. There are 30 students, and we're choosing 2 of them. The order doesn't matter here because selecting student A and then student B is the same as selecting student B and then student A. So, this is a combination problem.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, for the total number of possible pairs:\n\nC(30, 2) = 30! / (2!(30 - 2)!) = (30 \u00d7 29) / (2 \u00d7 1) = (870) / 2 = 435\n\nSo, there are 435 possible pairs of students.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of pairs where both students are girls. There are 18 girls, and we're choosing 2 of them.\n\nAgain, this is a combination problem:\n\nC(18, 2) = 18! / (2!(18 - 2)!) = (18 \u00d7 17) / (2 \u00d7 1) = (306) / 2 = 153\n\nSo, there are 153 pairs of girls.\n\nNow, the probability that both students selected are girls is the number of girl pairs divided by the total number of pairs:\n\nProbability = 153 / 435\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n153 \u00f7 3 = 51\n\n435 \u00f7 3 = 145\n\nSo, 51/145\n\nAlternatively, I can leave it as a decimal. Let's calculate that:\n\n51 \u00f7 145 \u2248 0.3517\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.3517, or 35.17%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way to calculate probability is to consider the chances step by step.\n\nFirst, the probability that the first student selected is a girl. There are 18 girls out of 30 students, so:\n\nP(first student is a girl) = 18/30 = 3/5\n\nThen, given that the first student is a girl, there are now 17 girls left and 29 students in total. So, the probability that the second student is also a girl is:\n\nP(second student is a girl | first student is a girl) = 17/29\n\nNow, to find the probability that both events happen (both students are girls), I multiply these probabilities:\n\nP(both girls) = (3/5) \u00d7 (17/29) = (3 \u00d7 17) / (5 \u00d7 29) = 51 / 145\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the probability is 51/145, or approximately 0.3517.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about this in terms of permutations instead of combinations, to see if I get the same result.\n\nIf I consider the order of selection, then the total number of ways to select two students in order is:\n\n30 \u00d7 29 = 870\n\nAnd the number of ways to select two girls in order is:\n\n18 \u00d7 17 = 306\n\nSo, the probability would be 306 / 870\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n306 \u00f7 6 = 51\n\n870 \u00f7 6 = 145\n\nAgain, 51/145\n\nSo, same result as before.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the probability is indeed 51/145, or approximately 35.17%.\n\nLet me just make sure there aren't any other factors to consider. Is there anything I'm missing?\n\nWell, the problem says the teacher selects two students at random, and we're assuming that each student has an equal chance of being selected, which seems reasonable.\n\nAlso, the class consists of only girls and boys, no other categories, so the total numbers add up correctly.\n\nI think that's all. I've approached the problem from different angles and gotten the same answer each time, so I'm pretty sure this is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{51}{145}} \\]"
