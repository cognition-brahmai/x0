        "content": "No, that's a common misconception. For a long time, it was believed that humans could only generate new brain cells, or neurons, during early development, particularly in the first few years of life. However, research over the past few decades has shown that neurogenesis\u2014the process of generating new neurons\u2014continues into adulthood in certain areas of the brain.\n\nOne of the most well-studied regions for adult neurogenesis is the hippocampus, which plays a key role in learning and memory. Another area where neurogenesis has been observed is the olfactory bulb, which is involved in the sense of smell.\n\nWhile the rate of neurogenesis may decrease with age, and it's more pronounced during developmental stages, the fact remains that the adult human brain does have the ability to produce new neurons under certain conditions.\n\nMoreover, the brain has a remarkable capacity for plasticity, meaning it can reorganize and form new connections throughout life in response to learning and experience, even if neurogenesis is limited to specific areas.\n\nSo, to summarize, humans do continue to generate new brain cells beyond the first two years of life, albeit in more restricted regions and possibly at a slower rate as we age."
