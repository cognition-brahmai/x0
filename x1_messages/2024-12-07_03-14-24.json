Specifically:\n\n- January has 31 days\n- February has 28 days in a common year and 29 days in a leap year\n- March has 31 days\n- April has 30 days\n- May has 31 days\n- June has 30 days\n- July has 31 days\n- August has 31 days\n- September has 30 days\n- October has 31 days\n- November has 30 days\n- December has 31 days\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"How many months have 28 days?\" is all 12 months. This is a classic trick question because it plays on the idea that only February has 28 days, but in reality, all months have at least that many days."
