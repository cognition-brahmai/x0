        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a rectangular garden that's 20 meters by 30 meters, and we want to build a square path around it. The area of this path should be equal to the area of the garden itself. We need to find out what the width of this path should be.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. We have a rectangular garden, and we're going to build a path around it that's square in shape. Wait a minute, that seems a bit confusing because a square is a specific type of rectangle where all sides are equal, but our garden is already a rectangle that's not a square since its sides are 20m and 30m. Maybe what is meant is that the path forms a square shape around the garden, meaning that the overall shape including the garden and the path is a square.\n\nBut the problem says \"a square path around the garden,\" which might mean that the path itself is a square, not the overall area. Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Maybe it means that the path has a uniform width around the garden, and the outer perimeter formed by the path is a square.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. The garden is 20m by 30m, so it's longer in one direction. If we build a path around it with a uniform width, say 'w' meters, then the overall dimensions would be (20 + 2w) meters by (30 + 2w) meters. For this to be a square, the lengths have to be equal:\n\n20 + 2w = 30 + 2w\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because if we subtract 2w from both sides, we get 20 = 30, which is not true. That means it's impossible for the overall dimensions to be a square if the garden is rectangular and we're adding the same width path all around.\n\nMaybe I misinterpreted the problem. Perhaps the path is not required to be a square, but rather it's just a path around the garden, and the area of the path is equal to the area of the garden.\n\nLet's consider that. The area of the garden is 20m * 30m = 600 square meters. So, the area of the path should also be 600 square meters.\n\nIf we build a path of uniform width 'w' around the garden, the overall dimensions become (20 + 2w) by (30 + 2w). The area of the entire region (garden plus path) would be (20 + 2w)(30 + 2w). The area of the path alone would be this total area minus the area of the garden:\n\nArea of path = (20 + 2w)(30 + 2w) - 600\n\nWe want this to be equal to 600 square meters:\n\n(20 + 2w)(30 + 2w) - 600 = 600\n\nLet's simplify this equation.\n\nFirst, expand the left side:\n\n(20 + 2w)(30 + 2w) = 20*30 + 20*2w + 30*2w + 2w*2w = 600 + 40w + 60w + 4w\u00b2 = 4w\u00b2 + 100w + 600\n\nNow, subtract 600:\n\n4w\u00b2 + 100w + 600 - 600 = 4w\u00b2 + 100w\n\nSet this equal to 600:\n\n4w\u00b2 + 100w = 600\n\nNow, let's solve for w. First, bring all terms to one side:\n\n4w\u00b2 + 100w - 600 = 0\n\nWe can simplify this by dividing all terms by 4:\n\nw\u00b2 + 25w - 150 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation: w\u00b2 + 25w - 150 = 0\n\nLet's solve for w using the quadratic formula:\n\nw = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nHere, a = 1, b = 25, c = -150\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 - 4ac = 25\u00b2 - 4*1*(-150) = 625 + 600 = 1225\n\nSince D is positive, we have two real solutions:\n\nw = [-25 + sqrt(1225)] / 2 = [-25 + 35] / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5\n\nw = [-25 - sqrt(1225)] / 2 = [-25 - 35] / 2 = -60 / 2 = -30\n\nSince width cannot be negative, we discard w = -30.\n\nTherefore, w = 5 meters.\n\nWait a minute, let's check this solution to make sure it makes sense.\n\nIf w = 5 meters, then the overall dimensions are:\n\nLength: 30 + 2*5 = 40 meters\n\nWidth: 20 + 2*5 = 30 meters\n\nArea of the entire region: 40 * 30 = 1200 square meters\n\nArea of the path: 1200 - 600 = 600 square meters, which matches the requirement.\n\nSo, the width of the path should be 5 meters.\n\nBut let's consider if there's another way to interpret the problem. Maybe the path is square, not the overall area.\n\nSuppose the path forms a square shape around the garden. Since the garden is 20m by 30m, to make a square path around it, we'd need to extend the shorter sides.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose we want the outer perimeter to be a square.\n\nGiven the garden is 30m long, to make the overall shape a square, the width would also need to be 30m. Since the garden is already 20m wide, the path would need to add 5m to each side to make it 30m wide.\n\nSo, path width on each side would be 5m.\n\nWait, but earlier we got w = 5m using the area approach, and now we're getting the same width by considering the overall shape being a square.\n\nThis seems consistent. So, the width of the path should be 5 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
