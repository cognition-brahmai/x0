        "content": "To determine the break-even point for the factory, we need to find out how many widgets must be sold so that the total revenue equals the total costs. The total costs include both the fixed costs and the variable costs (cost per widget).\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Identify the selling price per widget: $15\n2. Identify the variable cost per widget: $5\n3. Identify the fixed costs per month: $10,000\n\nFirst, calculate the profit per widget, which is the selling price minus the variable cost:\n\nProfit per widget = Selling price - Variable cost\nProfit per widget = $15 - $5 = $10\n\nNext, to find the break-even point in units, divide the fixed costs by the profit per widget:\n\nBreak-even point (units) = Fixed costs / Profit per widget\nBreak-even point (units) = $10,000 / $10 = 1,000 widgets\n\nTherefore, the factory must sell 1,000 widgets in a month to break even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1000} \\]"
