        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a village where:\n\n- Half of the villagers have cats. That's \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of the villagers.\n\n- One-third have dogs. That's \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the villagers.\n\n- And one-sixth have both cats and dogs. That's \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) of the villagers.\n\nWe need to find out what fraction of the villagers have either a cat or a dog but not both.\n\nFirst, I think I should recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets. If we want to find the total number of people who have either a cat or a dog, we add the number of cat owners to the number of dog owners and then subtract those who have both, to avoid double-counting. So, the fraction of villagers who have either a cat or a dog is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{cat owners} + \\text{dog owners} - \\text{both} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3}{6} + \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}\n\\]\n\nThen subtract the both:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the villagers have either a cat or a dog.\n\nBut the question is asking for the fraction that has either a cat or a dog but not both. That means we need to exclude those who have both.\n\nWe already have the total fraction that has either a cat or a dog, which is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), and within that, \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) have both.\n\nSo, to find those who have only a cat or only a dog, we subtract the fraction that has both from the total fraction that has either:\n\n\\[\n\\text{only cat or only dog} = \\text{either cat or dog} - \\text{both} = \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems off. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, I think I made a mistake in my approach. The inclusion-exclusion principle gave us the total fraction that has either a cat or a dog, which is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), and this includes those who have only cats, only dogs, and both.\n\nBut actually, the formula for the union of two sets is:\n\n\\[\n|A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|\n\\]\n\nWhich is what I used above.\n\nNow, to find those who have only a cat or only a dog, it's:\n\n\\[\n(|A| - |A \\cap B|) + (|B| - |A \\cap B|)\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n|A| + |B| - 2|A \\cap B|\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} - 2 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{3}{6} + \\frac{2}{6} - \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, indeed, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of the villagers have either a cat or a dog but not both.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that seemed off. Let me verify with another approach.\n\nLet's assume there are 6 villagers in total, to make the fractions easy.\n\n- Half have cats: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 = 3\\) villagers have cats.\n\n- One-third have dogs: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 = 2\\) villagers have dogs.\n\n- One-sixth have both: \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\times 6 = 1\\) villager has both a cat and a dog.\n\nNow, to find those who have only cats: 3 (cats) - 1 (both) = 2 villagers.\n\nOnly dogs: 2 (dogs) - 1 (both) = 1 villager.\n\nSo, total villagers who have either a cat or a dog but not both: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nFraction: \\(\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThat matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, using the inclusion-exclusion total: 3 (cats) + 2 (dogs) - 1 (both) = 4 villagers have either a cat or a dog.\n\nBut we need to exclude those who have both, so 4 - 1 = 3 have either but not both.\n\nFraction: \\(\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the Venn diagram:\n\n- One circle for cat owners: 3 villagers.\n\n- One circle for dog owners: 2 villagers.\n\n- Intersection: 1 villager.\n\nSo, only cat owners: 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nOnly dog owners: 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nTotal only: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nFraction: \\(\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nI think this is solid.\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I thought maybe I made a mistake. But multiple methods confirm \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nThe problem says \"have either a cat or a dog but not both.\" So, explicitly excluding those who have both.\n\nWe've calculated that correctly as \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nIs there any chance that the fractions don't add up correctly, or is there overlap that I'm missing?\n\nLet's check the total fractions:\n\n- Only cats: \\(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n\n- Only dogs: \\(\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}\\)\n\n- Both: \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)\n\nTotal: \\(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\nWait, that's less than 1. What about the remaining \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the villagers? Do they have neither a cat nor a dog?\n\nThe problem doesn't mention anything about villagers having neither, so I assume that's possible.\n\nBut in our earlier calculation, we found that \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) have either a cat or a dog (including both), and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) have neither.\n\nBut the question is only about those who have either but not both, which is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), as we calculated.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that all villagers have at least a cat or a dog, but that doesn't seem to be the case from the given fractions.\n\nGiven the fractions, it's possible that some villagers have neither.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of villagers who have either a cat or a dog but not both is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
