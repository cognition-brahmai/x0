        "content": "Let's see. There are three houses in a row: blue, red, and green. The blue house is next to the red house but not next to the green house. Also, the green house is not at either end. I need to figure out which house is at the leftmost position.\n\nFirst, since there are only three houses in a row, the positions are left, middle, and right.\n\nLet me denote the positions as 1 (left), 2 (middle), and 3 (right).\n\nSo, position 1: ?, position 2: ?, position 3: ?.\n\nGiven that the green house is not at either end, it must be in the middle position.\n\nSo, position 2: green.\n\nNow, the blue house is next to the red house but not next to the green house.\n\nWait a minute, but green is in the middle, so positions 1 and 3 are adjacent to green.\n\nBut blue is not next to green, so blue cannot be in positions 1 or 3.\n\nBut that's only two positions, and we have three houses.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no, positions 1, 2, and 3.\n\nGreen is in position 2.\n\nBlue is next to red but not next to green.\n\nSo, blue cannot be next to green, which means blue cannot be in position 1 or 3, but that's all the positions.\n\nWait, that can't be right.\n\nMaybe I misinterpreted.\n\nLet me start again.\n\nThere are three houses: blue, red, green.\n\nBlue is next to red, but not next to green.\n\nGreen is not at either end.\n\nSo, green is in the middle.\n\nTherefore, positions are:\n\n1: ?, 2: green, 3: ?.\n\nNow, blue is next to red but not next to green.\n\nSo, blue cannot be next to green, which means blue cannot be in position 1 or 3, but those are the only positions left.\n\nThis seems contradictory.\n\nMaybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nLet me consider that blue is next to red, and green is not at either end.\n\nWait, perhaps the blue and red houses are next to each other, and green is in the middle.\n\nBut then blue would be next to green, which violates the condition that blue is not next to green.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me try to list out all possible arrangements.\n\nPossible arrangements without any constraints:\n\n1. Blue, Red, Green\n\n2. Blue, Green, Red\n\n3. Red, Blue, Green\n\n4. Red, Green, Blue\n\n5. Green, Blue, Red\n\n6. Green, Red, Blue\n\nNow, apply the constraints:\n\n1. Blue is next to red, but not next to green.\n\n2. Green is not at either end.\n\nLet's check each arrangement:\n\n1. Blue, Red, Green:\n\n- Blue is next to red.\n\n- Blue is not next to green (since green is on the right of red).\n\n- Green is not at either end (it's in the middle). This seems to satisfy both conditions.\n\n2. Blue, Green, Red:\n\n- Blue is next to green, which violates the condition that blue is not next to green.\n\n- So, invalid.\n\n3. Red, Blue, Green:\n\n- Red is next to blue.\n\n- Blue is next to green, which violates the condition that blue is not next to green.\n\n- So, invalid.\n\n4. Red, Green, Blue:\n\n- Red is next to green.\n\n- Green is next to blue.\n\n- Blue is next to red.\n\n- But blue is next to green, which violates the condition.\n\n- So, invalid.\n\n5. Green, Blue, Red:\n\n- Green is next to blue.\n\n- Blue is next to red.\n\n- Green is not at either end (it's in the middle), but in this arrangement, green is at the left end.\n\n- Wait, green is at the left end, which violates the condition that green is not at either end.\n\n- So, invalid.\n\n6. Green, Red, Blue:\n\n- Green is next to red.\n\n- Red is next to blue.\n\n- Green is at the left end, which violates the condition.\n\n- So, invalid.\n\nFrom this analysis, only the first arrangement satisfies both conditions:\n\nBlue, Red, Green.\n\nTherefore, the leftmost house is blue.\n\nWait a second, but in this arrangement, blue is next to red, and green is in the middle, not at either end, and blue is not next to green. It seems to satisfy all the conditions.\n\nSo, the answer should be that the blue house is at the leftmost position.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is:\n\nSince green is not at either end, it must be in the middle.\n\nSo, position 2 is green.\n\nNow, positions 1 and 3 are to be occupied by blue and red.\n\nBlue is next to red but not next to green.\n\nIf blue is in position 1, then red must be in position 2, which is green's position, which is not possible.\n\nWait, position 2 is green, so red cannot be there.\n\nWait, that's confusing.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf green is in the middle, and blue is next to red but not next to green, then blue and red must be at the ends, but blue cannot be next to green.\n\nSince green is in the middle, blue cannot be at either end because both ends are adjacent to the middle.\n\nWait, that can't be.\n\nThis seems impossible.\n\nUnless...\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the setup.\n\nLet me consider that blue is next to red, and green is not at either end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blue house is next to the red house, and the blue house is not next to the green house.\n\nSo, blue is adjacent to red, and blue is not adjacent to green.\n\nThis means that red and green cannot be adjacent to blue at the same time.\n\nGiven that, and green is in the middle, then blue cannot be next to green.\n\nBut in a row of three houses, if green is in the middle, blue cannot be at either end because both ends are adjacent to the middle.\n\nThis seems impossible because blue has to be somewhere, but it can't be at either end, and the middle is green.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption that green is in the middle is incorrect.\n\nBut the condition says that green is not at either end, so it must be in the middle.\n\nThis seems like a paradox.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the statement \"the blue house is next to the red house, but not next to the green house\" can be interpreted differently.\n\nPerhaps blue is next to red, and red is next to green.\n\nBut green is not next to blue.\n\nSo, it could be blue, red, green.\n\nIn this arrangement, blue is next to red, red is next to green, but blue is not next to green.\n\nThis seems to satisfy all conditions.\n\nSo, the leftmost house is blue.\n\nAlternatively, if it were green, red, blue, then green is in the middle, blue is next to red, and blue is not next to green.\n\nBut in this arrangement, green is at the left end, which violates the condition that green is not at either end.\n\nTherefore, the only possible arrangement is blue, red, green.\n\nThus, the leftmost house is blue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{blue}} \\]"
