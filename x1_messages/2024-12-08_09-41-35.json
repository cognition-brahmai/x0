        "content": "The body of water that separates Saudi Arabia from Iran and extends approximately 990 miles from the Shatt al-Arab river delta to the Strait of Hormuz is the Persian Gulf. The Persian Gulf is a vital waterway in the Middle East, connecting the Arabian Peninsula with Iran and playing a significant role in global oil trade. It is bordered by several countries including Iran to the north, Saudi Arabia to the west, and other Gulf states such as the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Iraq. The Strait of Hormuz, at the entrance of the Persian Gulf, is one of the world's most strategic chokepoints for oil transportation."
