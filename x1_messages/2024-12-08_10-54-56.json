        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with 5 red balls and 3 green balls, so total balls in the box are 5 + 3 = 8 balls. Now, three balls are drawn at random without replacement, and I need to find the probability that exactly two of these three balls are red.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes when drawing three balls from eight. Since the order in which we draw the balls doesn't matter (it's just about the combination of balls we end up with), I should use combinations here.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 8 is C(8, 3).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * (8 - 3)!) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5!) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 5!) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6) / 6 = 56.\n\nSo, there are 56 possible ways to draw 3 balls from 8.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to draw exactly 2 red balls and 1 green ball.\n\nThere are 5 red balls and 3 green balls.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 5 is C(5, 2), and the number of ways to choose 1 green ball out of 3 is C(3, 1).\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is C(5, 2) \u00d7 C(3, 1).\n\nLet me calculate C(5, 2):\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!) = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 3!)) = (5 \u00d7 4) / 2 = 10.\n\nAnd C(3, 1) = 3! / (1! * (3 - 1)!) = (3 \u00d7 2!) / (1 \u00d7 2!)) = 3.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 10 \u00d7 3 = 30.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability = 30 / 56.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n30 \u00f7 2 = 15\n\n56 \u00f7 2 = 28\n\nSo, the probability is 15/28.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the probability step by step, considering the draws without replacement.\n\nFirst draw: probability of drawing a red ball is 5/8.\n\nSecond draw: if the first was red, then probability of drawing another red is 4/7.\n\nThird draw: probability of drawing a green ball is 3/6.\n\nBut since the order can vary\u2014red, red, green or red, green, red or green, red, red\u2014I need to account for all these sequences.\n\nSo, let's calculate it that way.\n\nThe probability of drawing red, red, green is (5/8) \u00d7 (4/7) \u00d7 (3/6).\n\nSimilarly, red, green, red is (5/8) \u00d7 (3/7) \u00d7 (4/6).\n\nAnd green, red, red is (3/8) \u00d7 (5/7) \u00d7 (4/6).\n\nNow, let's calculate each:\n\nRed, red, green: (5/8) \u00d7 (4/7) \u00d7 (3/6) = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3) / (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6) = 60 / 336 = 5/28.\n\nRed, green, red: (5/8) \u00d7 (3/7) \u00d7 (4/6) = (5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4) / (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6) = 60 / 336 = 5/28.\n\nGreen, red, red: (3/8) \u00d7 (5/7) \u00d7 (4/6) = (3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4) / (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6) = 60 / 336 = 5/28.\n\nNow, since these are mutually exclusive events, I can add their probabilities:\n\n5/28 + 5/28 + 5/28 = 15/28.\n\nSo, again, I get the probability as 15/28.\n\nThat matches my earlier result using combinations.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing exactly two red balls out of three is 15/28.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{28}} \\]"
