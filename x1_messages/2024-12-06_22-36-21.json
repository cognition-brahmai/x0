        "content": "So there's this puzzle about a man building a rectangular house with four walls, each having a southern exposure, and then there's a bear walking by, and the question is about the color of the bear. Hmm, interesting. I'm not sure how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for each wall to have a southern exposure. Exposure typically refers to the direction a wall faces, right? So if all four walls have a southern exposure, that would mean each wall is facing south. But in a rectangular house, walls are typically positioned at right angles to each other. So, in a standard rectangular structure, you'd have two pairs of opposite walls, with each pair facing different directions.\n\nWait a minute, in a standard rectangular house, it's impossible for all four walls to face south because that defies basic geometry. Unless... unless the house is built in a specific location on Earth where such a configuration is possible. Maybe near the poles or something?\n\nLet me think about Earth's geography. If you're standing at the North Pole, every direction is south. So, if the house is built right at the North Pole, then all four walls could indeed have a southern exposure because every direction from the pole is south.\n\nBut then there's a bear walking by. Bears are typically found in certain regions, like the Arctic or the forests. If the house is at the North Pole, then the bear would likely be a polar bear, which is white in color.\n\nWait, but the question mentions a rectangular house with four walls, each having a southern exposure. If the house is at the North Pole, that makes sense. And if there's a bear walking by, it's probably a polar bear.\n\nBut I recall that polar bears are found in the Arctic, which is around the North Pole, and they are white to blend in with the snow. So, the bear is white.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is it possible for a house to have all four walls facing south in any other location? Maybe near the South Pole? Wait, at the South Pole, all directions are north. So, if the house is at the South Pole, all walls would face north, not south. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nTherefore, the only place where all four walls can face south is at the North Pole. And the bear that walks by would be a polar bear, which is white.\n\nSo, the answer should be white.\n\nBut just to be thorough, are there any other types of bears that could be in that area? I know that polar bears are the primary bear species in the Arctic region. Sometimes, brown bears or black bears might venture into northern areas, but they are not typical to the Arctic Circle, especially at the North Pole.\n\nPolar bears are adapted to the Arctic environment, with their white fur serving as camouflage in the snow. So, it's safe to assume that the bear in question is a polar bear and therefore white in color.\n\nAdditionally, considering the geographical constraints of the puzzle, there aren't many other animals that could be present at the North Pole besides polar bears and some marine life. So, the bear has to be a polar bear, which is white.\n\nI think that's the answer. The bear is white.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{white}} \\]"
