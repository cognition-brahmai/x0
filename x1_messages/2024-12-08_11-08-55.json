It is the art and science of determining what matter is and how much of it exists. Analytical chemists use their knowledge of chemistry, instrumentation, computers, and statistics to solve problems in almost all areas of chemistry. For example, they may use their skills to test the chemical safety of a new drug or to track the environmental impact of pollutants.\n\nWhich of the following best describes a role of an analytical chemist?\nA. Designing and building new chemical plants.\nB. Teaching chemistry at a high school level.\nC. Creating new synthetic materials for industrial use.\nD. Developing new flavors for a food company.\nE. Determining the chemical composition and quantities in a sample."

        "content": "Let's see what this is about. So, analytical chemistry is all about figuring out what stuff is made of and how much of each thing is there. It's like being a detective for chemicals! They use all sorts of fancy tools and math to answer questions about matter.\n\nThe question is asking which option best describes the role of an analytical chemist. Let's look at each choice:\n\nA. Designing and building new chemical plants.\n\nHmm, that sounds more like chemical engineering. Analytical chemists might help test the outputs or ensure quality control in a plant, but designing and building the plant itself seems outside their main role.\n\nB. Teaching chemistry at a high school level.\n\nWell, analytical chemists could certainly teach, maybe even at high school, but this seems too general. Analytical chemistry is a specific field within chemistry, so teaching general chemistry might not fully capture their expertise.\n\nC. Creating new synthetic materials for industrial use.\n\nThis sounds more like materials science or organic chemistry. Analytical chemists might help characterize the new materials, but creating them seems like a different role.\n\nD. Developing new flavors for a food company.\n\nInteresting! Analytical chemists could be involved in analyzing flavors and compounds in food, but developing new flavors might involve more sensory science and food chemistry. It's related, but maybe not the best fit.\n\nE. Determining the chemical composition and quantities in a sample.\n\nWow, this directly matches the definition provided. It says analytical chemists determine what matter is and how much of it exists. This seems like the most accurate description.\n\nSo, based on the description, I think E is the best answer. But let me double-check.\n\nOption A is more about chemical engineering.\n\nOption B is too general and not specific to analytical chemistry.\n\nOption C is more related to materials science or organic chemistry.\n\nOption D is related, but perhaps not the primary role of an analytical chemist.\n\nOption E directly aligns with the definition given.\n\nYeah, I'm confident that E is the correct choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{E} \\]"
