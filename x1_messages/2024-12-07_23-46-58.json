        "content": "In the sunny zoo, where animals play,\nLived a monkey named Monty, full of mischief every day.\nHe swung from trees and vines so high,\nBut his favorite game was to steal a hat, oh my!\n\nOne sunny morning, as folks came to see,\nMonty spied a lady with a pretty red hat on her knee.\nWith a mischievous grin and a swift move so sly,\nHe snatched the hat and darted away, up in the sky.\n\nThe lady cried, \"My hat! My hat!\"\nBut Monty just laughed, hiding in his that.\nHe perched on a branch, wearing the red delight,\nFeeling mighty fine, thinking all was right.\n\nAnother day, a man with a blue cap so fine,\nWalking by, minding his own, not a care in his mind.\nMonty, ever the trickster, couldn't resist the chance,\nHe leaped down, grabbed the cap, and danced.\n\n\"Hey! Give that back!\" the man shouted loud,\nBut Monty just chuckled, feeling proud.\nHe wore the blue cap, strutting around his tree,\nThinking he was the king of the zoo, carefree.\n\nThen one afternoon, as the sun started to set,\nA little girl came in, with a yellow bow on her hat.\nMonty's eyes sparkled; another hat to grab!\nHe planned his move, ready to snatch.\n\nBut as he crept closer, he saw the girl's face,\nSo full of innocence, with a sweet smile in place.\nShe offered him a banana, pure and kind,\nAnd Monty, for a moment, left his plans behind.\n\nHe took the banana, tasting its sweet delight,\nAnd in that moment, something felt not quite right.\nHe thought about all the hats he'd stolen before,\nAnd how the people had cried and ran to the door.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, taking hats wasn't so fun,\nIf it made others sad and upset, everyone.\nHe looked at the yellow bow, so bright and gay,\nAnd realized that respecting others is the way.\n\nFrom that day forward, Monty changed his tune,\nNo more stealing hats, no more acting mean and rude.\nHe still played and swung, full of monkey fun,\nBut now, he respected others, and had everyone's trust.\n\nAnd the zoo visitors, they all noticed the change,\nThey smiled at Monty, no longer feeling the same range.\nOf worry and fear, but instead, warmth and cheer,\nFor Monty had learned a valuable lesson, year after year.\n\nSo remember, dear children, as you grow and play,\nRespect others' things, in every single way.\nFor when we care for what others hold dear,\nWe make the world a better place, without a single tear.\n"
