        "content": "Yes, it's true that less than half of the UK population holds a passport. According to the latest data from the UK government, as of March 2021, around 44% of the UK population held a British passport. This means that approximately 28 million people in the UK have a passport, while the remaining 36 million do not.\n\nIt's worth noting that passport ownership rates can vary significantly depending on factors such as age, income, and geography. For example, younger people and those from lower-income households may be less likely to have a passport compared to older and higher-income individuals.\n\nAdditionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on travel and passport applications. Many people have put off applying for a passport due to travel restrictions and uncertainty about future travel plans. This may have contributed to the overall decrease in passport ownership in the UK in recent years.\n\nOverall, while it's true that less than half of the UK population holds a passport, this is not necessarily a cause for concern. Not everyone needs or wants to travel internationally, and passport ownership is a personal choice. However, for those who do need to travel abroad, it's important to ensure that they have a valid passport and any necessary visas or travel documents in order to enter their destination country.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- HM Passport Office.
