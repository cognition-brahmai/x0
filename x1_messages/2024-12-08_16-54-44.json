        "content": "Let's see. So, in this town, 60% of the people are adults and 40% are children. Among adults, 30% have a pet dog, and among children, 20% have a pet dog. I need to find out what percentage of the total population has a pet dog.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out what percentage of adults have pet dogs and what percentage of children have pet dogs, and then combine those to get the total percentage.\n\nSo, adults are 60% of the population, and 30% of them have pet dogs. So, the percentage of the total population that are adults with pet dogs would be 60% times 30%.\n\nLet me calculate that: 60% times 30% is... well, 60% is 0.6 and 30% is 0.3, so 0.6 times 0.3 is 0.18, which is 18%.\n\nSimilarly, children are 40% of the population, and 20% of them have pet dogs. So, the percentage of the total population that are children with pet dogs would be 40% times 20%.\n\nCalculating that: 40% is 0.4 and 20% is 0.2, so 0.4 times 0.2 is 0.08, which is 8%.\n\nNow, to find the total percentage of the population that has pet dogs, I need to add those two percentages together: 18% plus 8% equals 26%.\n\nSo, 26% of the total population has pet dogs.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother way could be to use the law of total probability. The total probability of someone having a pet dog is the sum of the probability of being an adult and having a pet dog plus the probability of being a child and having a pet dog.\n\nSo, P(pet dog) = P(pet dog | adult) * P(adult) + P(pet dog | child) * P(child)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nP(pet dog) = (0.3)(0.6) + (0.2)(0.4) = 0.18 + 0.08 = 0.26, or 26%.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of actual numbers. Suppose the town has 100 people. Then, 60 are adults and 40 are children.\n\nAmong adults, 30% have pet dogs, so 30% of 60 is 0.3 * 60 = 18 adults have pet dogs.\n\nAmong children, 20% have pet dogs, so 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 children have pet dogs.\n\nSo, total number of people with pet dogs is 18 + 8 = 26.\n\nSince the total population is 100, that's 26%.\n\nSo, again, I get 26%.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any overlap between adults and children having pet dogs that I need to account for? No, because adults and children are mutually exclusive groups in this context.\n\nAlso, the percentages given are straightforward: percentages of adults and children who have pet dogs, and I'm to find the overall percentage.\n\nI don't think there's anything else to consider. So, I'm confident that 26% is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{26\\%} \\]"
