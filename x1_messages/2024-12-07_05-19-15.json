        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, the train travels 240 kilometers at an average speed of 80 kilometers per hour. To find out how long that takes, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo for the first part:\n\nTime1 = 240 km / 80 km/h = 3 hours\n\nThen, the train stops for 30 minutes. I need to remember to include that in the total time. 30 minutes is 0.5 hours.\n\nAfter that, the train travels another 200 kilometers at an average speed of 100 kilometers per hour. So for the second part:\n\nTime2 = 200 km / 100 km/h = 2 hours\n\nNow, to get the total travel time, I need to add up Time1, the stopping time, and Time2:\n\nTotal time = Time1 + stopping time + Time2 = 3 hours + 0.5 hours + 2 hours = 5.5 hours\n\nSo, the total travel time of the train is 5.5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
