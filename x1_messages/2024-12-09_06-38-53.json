        "content": "So, there's this train that's zooming along at 60 miles per hour, and it takes 5 hours to go between two cities. Now, we've got a car that's moving a bit slower, at 40 miles per hour, and we want to know how long it would take that car to cover the same distance. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the distance is between the two cities. Since the train goes at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, I can calculate the distance by multiplying speed by time. So, distance equals speed times time, right? That would be 60 miles per hour times 5 hours, which is 300 miles. So, the two cities are 300 miles apart.\n\nNow, for the car that's traveling at 40 miles per hour, I need to find out how long it takes to cover those 300 miles. Again, using the formula, but rearranging it a bit. If distance equals speed times time, then time equals distance divided by speed. So, time equals 300 miles divided by 40 miles per hour.\n\nLet me do that calculation. 300 divided by 40. Well, 40 times 7 is 280, and 300 minus 280 is 20. So, it's 7 hours plus 20 miles. But 20 miles at 40 miles per hour would take half an hour, because 40 miles per hour means 40 miles in 60 minutes, so 20 miles would be 30 minutes.\n\nSo, total time for the car would be 7 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nWait a second, maybe I should check that again. Maybe there's a better way to calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, since the train travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, and the car travels at 40 miles per hour, I can think about their speeds.\n\nThe car is traveling at 40 miles per hour, which is two-thirds of the train's speed of 60 miles per hour because 40 divided by 60 is two-thirds.\n\nSo, if the train takes 5 hours, and the car is going slower by a factor of two-thirds, then the time for the car should be inversely proportional.\n\nWait, let's think about this. If the car is going slower, it should take more time, right? So, if the train takes 5 hours at 60 miles per hour, and the car is going at 40 miles per hour, which is slower, it should take more than 5 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula time equals distance over speed.\n\nWe already know the distance is 300 miles, and the car's speed is 40 miles per hour.\n\nSo, time equals 300 divided by 40, which is 7.5 hours, or 7 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to see that the car is moving at two-thirds the speed of the train.\n\nSo, if the train takes 5 hours, then the car, going two-thirds as fast, should take three-halves as much time, because time and speed are inversely proportional.\n\nSo, three-halves of 5 hours is 5 times 1.5, which is 7.5 hours.\n\nAgain, that confirms that the car takes 7.5 hours to cover the same distance.\n\nSo, the answer should be 7 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nBut maybe I should consider units and make sure everything checks out.\n\nThe train's speed is 60 miles per hour, and time is 5 hours, so distance is indeed 300 miles.\n\nCar's speed is 40 miles per hour, so time is distance over speed, which is 300 divided by 40, which is 7.5 hours.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of speeds is 40 over 60, which is two-thirds.\n\nTherefore, the time should be inversely proportional, so three-halves of the train's time.\n\nThree-halves of 5 is 7.5 hours.\n\nEverything seems consistent.\n\nI think the answer is 7 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
