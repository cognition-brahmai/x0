It covers approximately 63 million square miles (163 million square kilometers), which is about 46% of the Earth's water surface and more than twice the area of the next largest ocean, the Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean is also the deepest, with its maximum depth reaching nearly 36,000 feet (over 10,970 meters) in the Mariana Trench."
