        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train that goes from Town A to Town B at 60 mph and comes back to Town A at 40 mph. The total time for the whole trip is 5 hours, and we need to find the distance between Town A and Town B.\n\nFirst, let's denote the distance between Town A and Town B as \\( d \\) miles. Since the train goes to Town B and then returns to Town A, the total distance for the round trip is \\( 2d \\) miles.\n\nHowever, the train travels to Town B at 60 mph and returns at 40 mph, so the speeds are different for each leg of the trip. That means the time taken to go to Town B and the time taken to return to Town A will be different.\n\nLet's recall that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, the time taken to go from Town A to Town B is \\( \\frac{d}{60} \\) hours, and the time taken to return from Town B to Town A is \\( \\frac{d}{40} \\) hours.\n\nThe total time for the trip is the sum of these two times, which is given as 5 hours. So, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{d}{40} = 5\n\\]\n\nNow, to solve for \\( d \\), we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 60 and 40, and the least common multiple of 60 and 40 is 120.\n\nLet's rewrite each fraction with the denominator of 120:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{60} = \\frac{2d}{120}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{40} = \\frac{3d}{120}\n\\]\n\nNow, add these two fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2d}{120} + \\frac{3d}{120} = \\frac{5d}{120}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5d}{120} = \\frac{d}{24}\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{24} = 5\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( d \\), multiply both sides of the equation by 24:\n\n\\[\nd = 5 \\times 24\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd = 120\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the distance between Town A and Town B is 120 miles.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If the distance is 120 miles, then the time to go from Town A to Town B at 60 mph is \\( \\frac{120}{60} = 2 \\) hours. The time to return from Town B to Town A at 40 mph is \\( \\frac{120}{40} = 3 \\) hours. Adding these times together gives \\( 2 + 3 = 5 \\) hours, which matches the total travel time given in the problem.\n\nSo, yes, the distance between Town A and Town B is indeed 120 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
