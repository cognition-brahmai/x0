        "content": "To create a Python program that fetches current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Sign up for an API key**: First, you need to sign up on the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/) and obtain an API key.\n\n2. **Install necessary libraries**: You will need the `requests` library to make HTTP requests. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n3. **Write the Python code**: Create a script that takes a city name as input, constructs the API URL with the city name and your API key, makes the request, parses the JSON response, and prints out the relevant weather information.\n\nHere's a sample code to get you started:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(city, api_key):\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n    params = {\n        'q': city,\n        'appid': api_key,\n        'units': 'metric'  # Use 'imperial' for Fahrenheit\n    }\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    \n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        data = response.json()\n        main = data['main']\n        weather = data['weather'][0]\n        \n        print(f\"City: {city}\")\n        print(f\"Temperature: {main['temp']}\u00b0C\")\n        print(f\"Humidity: {main['humidity']}%\")\n        print(f\"Weather Description: {weather['description']}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Error: {response.status_code}\")\n        print(response.json())\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    city = input(\"Enter city name: \")\n    api_key = 'your_api_key_here'  # Replace with your actual API key\n    get_weather(city, api_key)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **API Key**: Replace `'your_api_key_here'` with the actual API key you obtained from OpenWeatherMap.\n\n2. **Base URL**: The base URL for the current weather data endpoint is used.\n\n3. **Parameters**:\n   - `q`: City name.\n   - `appid`: Your API key.\n   - `units`: Set to `'metric'` for Celsius, or `'imperial'` for Fahrenheit.\n\n4. **Making the Request**: The `requests.get` method is used to make the HTTP GET request.\n\n5. **Parsing the Response**: If the response status code is 200 (OK), the JSON data is parsed to extract and print the temperature, humidity, and weather description. If there's an error, it prints the status code and the error message.\n\nThis should give you a basic weather application that fetches and displays current weather data for any city you input."
