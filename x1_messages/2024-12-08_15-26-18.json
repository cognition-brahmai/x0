        "content": "So I've got this equation to solve: 3x - 7 = 20. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on algebra, but I'll give it a shot. So, the goal is to find out what x is, right? Let me remember how to solve linear equations.\n\nFirst, I think I need to get all the terms with x on one side and the numbers on the other side. In this case, the x term is already on the left side, so maybe I can keep it there and move the -7 to the right side. To do that, I should add 7 to both sides of the equation to keep it balanced. So, if I add 7 to both sides, the equation becomes:\n\n3x - 7 + 7 = 20 + 7\n\nThe -7 and +7 on the left side cancel out, so that simplifies to:\n\n3x = 27\n\nOkay, now I need to solve for x. Since x is being multiplied by 3, I should do the opposite operation, which is division, to isolate x. So, I'll divide both sides by 3:\n\n3x / 3 = 27 / 3\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = 9\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me check by plugging x = 9 back into the original equation to see if it holds true.\n\nOriginal equation: 3x - 7 = 20\n\nPlugging in x = 9: 3*(9) - 7 = 27 - 7 = 20\n\nYes, that matches the right side. So, x = 9 is the correct solution.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there are any other possible solutions. Is there any other value of x that could satisfy this equation? Let's see.\n\nSuppose x = 10: 3*(10) - 7 = 30 - 7 = 23, which is not equal to 20.\n\nx = 8: 3*(8) - 7 = 24 - 7 = 17, which is less than 20.\n\nx = 9.5: 3*(9.5) - 7 = 28.5 - 7 = 21.5, still not 20.\n\nx = 8.5: 3*(8.5) - 7 = 25.5 - 7 = 18.5, which is less than 20.\n\nSo, it seems like x = 9 is the only solution that makes the equation true.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this equation graphically. The equation 3x - 7 = 20 is a straight line, and solving for x is finding the x-value where the line equals 20. Since it's a linear equation, there should be only one solution, which aligns with what I found.\n\nAlso, I could consider solving it differently. For example, I could add 7 to both sides first:\n\n3x - 7 + 7 = 20 + 7\n\n3x = 27\n\nThen divide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 9\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of inverse operations. The equation is 3x - 7 = 20. So, to undo the operations on x, I first add 7 to both sides to undo the subtraction, and then divide both sides by 3 to undo the multiplication.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, I keep getting x = 9 as the solution.\n\nLet me also consider if there's any possibility of extraneous solutions or if I need to check for domain restrictions. In this case, since it's a simple linear equation, there are no domain restrictions, and no extraneous solutions to worry about.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that x = 9 is the solution to the equation 3x - 7 = 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
