        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to understand what the company currently has and what it wants to achieve.\n\nSo, the company has 120 employees in total, and 30% of them are part-time workers. That means the rest are full-time employees. We need to find out how many full-time employees there are currently.\n\nTo find the number of part-time workers, we can calculate 30% of 120:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of part-time workers} = 0.30 \\times 120 = 36\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 36 part-time workers. Now, to find the number of full-time employees, we subtract the part-time workers from the total employees:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of full-time employees} = 120 - 36 = 84\n\\]\n\nAlright, so there are 84 full-time employees currently.\n\nThe company wants to increase its number of full-time employees by 20%. So, we need to find out what 20% of the current full-time employees is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Increase in full-time employees} = 0.20 \\times 84 = 16.8\n\\]\n\nHmm, we can't hire 0.8 of a person, so we might need to round this number. But let's see what the question asks. It says \"how many new full-time employees should be hired?\" and it doesn't specify whether to round up or down, so perhaps we can leave it as 16.8 for now and see if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company can hire fractions of employees, but that doesn't make practical sense. Maybe the company will need to hire 17 new full-time employees to achieve at least a 20% increase.\n\nWait a minute, let's check if hiring 17 new employees would indeed result in more than a 20% increase.\n\nCurrent full-time employees: 84\n\nAfter hiring 17 new full-time employees: 84 + 17 = 101\n\nPercentage increase:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage increase} = \\left( \\frac{101 - 84}{84} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{17}{84} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 20.24\\%\n\\]\n\nThat's slightly more than 20%, which might be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if they hire 16 new full-time employees: 84 + 16 = 100\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage increase} = \\left( \\frac{100 - 84}{84} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{16}{84} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 19.05\\%\n\\]\n\nThat's slightly less than 20%. So, to achieve exactly 20%, they would need to hire 16.8 employees, which isn't possible. Therefore, they need to hire 17 new full-time employees to exceed the 20% increase.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way to look at this. Maybe the company can adjust the number of part-time workers to achieve the desired increase in full-time employees.\n\nWait, the problem says \"increase its number of full-time employees by 20%,\" which seems straightforward. But maybe there are constraints on hiring new employees or converting part-time workers to full-time.\n\nLet's see: the company has 120 employees in total, with 36 part-time and 84 full-time. If they want to increase full-time employees by 20%, that means adding 16.8 new full-time positions. Since they can't hire a fraction of a person, they need to decide whether to hire 17 new full-time employees or find another way to reach the 20% increase.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some part-time workers can be converted to full-time to meet this goal. But the problem doesn't mention anything about converting part-time to full-time, so maybe we should assume that the company will hire new full-time employees.\n\nSo, to sum up, the company needs to hire 17 new full-time employees to increase its full-time workforce by approximately 20%.\n\nWait, but let's double-check the calculation to make sure.\n\nCurrent full-time employees: 84\n\n20% of 84: 0.20 \u00d7 84 = 16.8\n\nSo, to increase by 20%, they need to add 16.8 employees.\n\nSince they can't hire a fraction of a person, they need to round up to 17 to exceed 20%, or round down to 16, which would give less than 20%.\n\nIf they hire 17:\n\nNew full-time employees: 84 + 17 = 101\n\nPercentage increase:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{101 - 84}{84} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{17}{84} \\times 100\\% \\approx 20.24\\%\n\\]\n\nWhich is slightly over 20%.\n\nIf they hire 16:\n\nNew full-time employees: 84 + 16 = 100\n\nPercentage increase:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{100 - 84}{84} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{16}{84} \\times 100\\% \\approx 19.05\\%\n\\]\n\nWhich is slightly under 20%.\n\nSo, to meet or exceed a 20% increase, the company should hire 17 new full-time employees.\n\nAlternatively, if the company is okay with exactly 20%, they might consider hiring 16 and finding another way to meet the exact percentage, but that complicates things.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the company should hire 17 new full-time employees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]"
