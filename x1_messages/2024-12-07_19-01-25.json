Every plan will correspond to an evidence value, which is the outcome of one of the accessible functions with an input string that could be the user question, one or more preceding evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nAvailable tools:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: Tool that lets the user search for information via DuckDuckGo search engine. It aids in locating a list of sites that might contain the answer to the user's question.\nSiteReader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string comprising newline separated links. Input is one or more links, and it generates plain text output containing the link contents.\nHyperlinkCollector[input]: Gathers links from plain text and yields a plain text, newline-separated list of links.\nQAModel[input]: Question-answering language model, especially helpful in answering queries based on an input text passage. The input needs to be a textual question that refers to an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [First action based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to call and input parameter, possibly referencing prior evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0:\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: holding the ultimate answer]\n\nQuestion: Who is the author of the book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and what other books did they write?"
