        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to find out how much profit the factory makes per hour from each product, and then combine those to find the total hourly profit. After that, we'll calculate the weekly profit based on the number of hours the factory operates in a week.\n\nSo, the factory produces 200 units of product A per hour, and each unit of A generates $15 profit. So, the profit from product A per hour is 200 units times $15 per unit, which is 200 * 15 = $3,000.\n\nSimilarly, it produces 300 units of product B per hour, with each unit generating $20 profit. So, the profit from product B per hour is 300 units times $20 per unit, which is 300 * 20 = $6,000.\n\nNow, to find the total profit per hour from both products, we add the profits together: $3,000 from A plus $6,000 from B, which equals $9,000 per hour.\n\nNext, we need to know how many hours the factory operates in a week to find the weekly profit. Factories often operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but sometimes they might have downtime or maintenance periods. For this problem, I'll assume the factory operates 24/7 without breaks.\n\nSo, there are 24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week, meaning 24 * 7 = 168 hours in a week.\n\nNow, if the factory makes $9,000 every hour, then in 168 hours, the total profit would be 168 * $9,000.\n\nLet me calculate that: 168 * 9,000.\n\nFirst, 100 * 9,000 = $900,000.\n\nThen, 60 * 9,000 = $540,000.\n\nAnd finally, 8 * 9,000 = $72,000.\n\nNow, adding those up: $900,000 + $540,000 = $1,440,000, and then plus $72,000 equals $1,512,000.\n\nSo, the factory makes $1,512,000 in profit per week.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should check if my assumption about the factory operating 24/7 is correct. The problem doesn't specify the operating hours, so maybe I should consider a standard workweek.\n\nLet's consider that the factory operates 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, which is a typical workweek. That would be 8 * 5 = 40 hours per week.\n\nUsing this, the weekly profit would be 40 hours * $9,000 per hour = $360,000.\n\nHowever, factories often operate more hours than that, so perhaps they work 10-hour shifts, 6 days a week. That would be 10 * 6 = 60 hours per week.\n\nThen, 60 hours * $9,000 per hour = $540,000.\n\nAlternatively, if they work 24/7, as I initially thought, that's 168 hours per week, leading to $1,512,000.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify the operating hours, maybe I should ask for clarification.\n\nBut assuming the factory operates continuously without stops, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, then $1,512,000 is the weekly profit.\n\nAlternatively, if they operate only during standard business hours, say 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, then it's $360,000 per week.\n\nGiven that it's a factory, it's possible they operate more hours, but without specific information, I think the safe approach is to assume standard business hours unless stated otherwise.\n\nTherefore, with 40 hours per week, the profit is $360,000.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another scenario: perhaps they operate 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.\n\nThat would be 12 * 6 = 72 hours per week.\n\nThen, 72 * $9,000 = $648,000 per week.\n\nStill, without specific information on operating hours, it's hard to give an exact answer.\n\nMaybe I should present multiple scenarios based on different operating hours.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If the factory operates 40 hours per week: 40 * $9,000 = $360,000\n\n- If it operates 60 hours per week: 60 * $9,000 = $540,000\n\n- If it operates 168 hours per week: 168 * $9,000 = $1,512,000\n\nThis way, the user can see how the profit changes based on operating hours.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume a certain number of hours. Often, such problems assume standard business hours, which are 40 hours per week.\n\nIn that case, the answer would be $360,000 per week.\n\nBut to be comprehensive, I'll consider another approach.\n\nLet's calculate the combined profit per hour first, which we've already done: $9,000 per hour.\n\nThen, if we consider a standard workweek of 40 hours, the weekly profit is 40 * $9,000 = $360,000.\n\nHowever, factories sometimes operate in shifts, with multiple shifts per day.\n\nFor instance, if there are 3 shifts of 8 hours each day, that's 24 hours a day.\n\nThen, in a week, that's 24 hours * 7 days = 168 hours, leading back to $1,512,000 per week.\n\nAlternatively, if there are 2 shifts of 12 hours each day, that's 24 hours a day, same as above.\n\nBut perhaps not all factories operate like that.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in operating hours, perhaps the best approach is to calculate based on the information provided and assume standard business hours.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem implies continuous operation.\n\nIn that case, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, leading to 168 hours per week and $1,512,000 in profit.\n\nBut to confirm, perhaps I should check if there are any standard assumptions for factory operating hours in such problems.\n\nUpon reflection, I recall that in many industrial settings, factories do operate in multiple shifts to maximize production, often running 24 hours a day.\n\nTherefore, assuming 168 hours per week seems reasonable.\n\nHence, the total weekly profit would be $1,512,000.\n\nBut to be thorough, I'll double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, profit per hour:\n\n- Product A: 200 units * $15 = $3,000\n\n- Product B: 300 units * $20 = $6,000\n\n- Total per hour: $3,000 + $6,000 = $9,000\n\nThen, in 168 hours: 168 * $9,000 = $1,512,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory operates only 40 hours per week: 40 * $9,000 = $360,000\n\nOr 60 hours: $540,000\n\nBut given that it's a factory, I think $1,512,000 is the more accurate assumption.\n\nTherefore, the factory makes $1,512,000 in profit per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1512000} \\]"
