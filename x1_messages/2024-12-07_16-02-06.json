        "content": "Let's see. Apples cost $1.50 per pound, and John buys 4 pounds. So, first I need to find out how much he has to pay for those 4 pounds.\n\nI can multiply the price per pound by the number of pounds he buys. That is, $1.50 times 4.\n\nLet me do that: 1.50 \u00d7 4.\n\nWell, 1 times 4 is 4, and 0.50 times 4 is 2. So, 4 plus 2 equals $6.00.\n\nSo, the total cost for 4 pounds of apples is $6.00.\n\nNow, John gives the cashier a $10 bill. To find out how much change he should receive, I need to subtract the total cost from the amount he gave to the cashier.\n\nThat is, $10.00 minus $6.00.\n\n10 minus 6 is 4.\n\nSo, John should receive $4.00 in change.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nApples are $1.50 per pound:\n\n1 pound = $1.50\n\n2 pounds = $3.00\n\n3 pounds = $4.50\n\n4 pounds = $6.00\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnd $10.00 minus $6.00 is indeed $4.00.\n\nSo, the change John will receive is $4.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
