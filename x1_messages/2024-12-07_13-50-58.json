        "content": "So I've got this equation to solve: 3x - 7 = 2(x + 4). Alright, let's see. I need to find the value of x that makes this equation true. I remember that the goal is to isolate x on one side of the equation. Let me think about the steps I should take.\n\nFirst, I look at the equation: 3x - 7 = 2(x + 4). I see that there's a parenthesis here, so maybe I should start by simplifying that. I think I need to use the distributive property, which means I'll multiply the 2 by both x and 4. So, 2 times x is 2x, and 2 times 4 is 8. That means the equation becomes 3x - 7 = 2x + 8.\n\nOkay, now I have 3x - 7 = 2x + 8. I need to get all the x terms on one side and the constant terms on the other side. Maybe I can subtract 2x from both sides to start moving the x terms to one side. So, if I subtract 2x from both sides, I get:\n\n3x - 2x - 7 = 2x - 2x + 8\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\nx - 7 = 8\n\nNow, I have x - 7 = 8. To isolate x, I need to get rid of the -7. I think I can do that by adding 7 to both sides. So, if I add 7 to both sides, I get:\n\nx - 7 + 7 = 8 + 7\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx = 15\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me check my steps again. Starting from 3x - 7 = 2(x + 4), I distributed the 2 correctly to get 2x + 8. Then, subtracting 2x from both sides gives me x - 7 = 8. Adding 7 to both sides gives x = 15. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nBut let me double-check by plugging x = 15 back into the original equation to see if it holds true. So, original equation is 3x - 7 = 2(x + 4).\n\nPlugging in x = 15:\n\nLeft side: 3*(15) - 7 = 45 - 7 = 38\n\nRight side: 2*(15 + 4) = 2*(19) = 38\n\nOkay, both sides equal 38, so it checks out. Therefore, x = 15 is the correct solution.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this equation in terms of balancing both sides. Whatever I do to one side, I have to do to the other to keep it balanced. That's why when I subtracted 2x from one side, I had to subtract it from the other side as well. Similarly, when I added 7 to one side, I added it to the other side too.\n\nI also recall that equations can be rewritten in different ways, but the fundamental relationship remains the same. In this case, starting with 3x - 7 = 2(x + 4), I could have also expanded the right side first, which I did, and then proceeded to isolate x.\n\nAnother thing I could consider is if there are any other ways to approach this equation. For example, I could have added 7 to both sides first instead of subtracting 2x. Let's try that.\n\nStarting again with 3x - 7 = 2(x + 4)\n\nAdd 7 to both sides:\n\n3x - 7 + 7 = 2(x + 4) + 7\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n3x = 2(x + 4) + 7\n\nNow, distribute the 2:\n\n3x = 2x + 8 + 7\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3x = 2x + 15\n\nNow, subtract 2x from both sides:\n\n3x - 2x = 2x - 2x + 15\n\nWhich gives:\n\nx = 15\n\nSame answer as before. So, regardless of the order of operations, as long as I follow the rules of algebra, I arrive at the same solution.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. Equations like these are fundamental in algebra, and it's important to master them to move on to more complex problems. I remember when I was first learning this, it seemed a bit tricky, but with practice, it becomes second nature.\n\nOne common mistake I've seen students make is forgetting to distribute the multiplier to every term inside the parentheses. For example, in this equation, 2(x + 4), some might only multiply 2 by x and forget to multiply 2 by 4. That would lead to an incorrect equation after distribution. So, it's crucial to remember to distribute to all terms inside the parentheses.\n\nAnother potential mistake is not keeping track of negative signs. In this equation, there's a -7, and it's important to handle it correctly when moving terms from one side to the other. For instance, when I added 7 to both sides, I was careful to add it to both sides to maintain balance.\n\nIn summary, to solve the equation 3x - 7 = 2(x + 4), I first distributed the 2 on the right side to get 2x + 8. Then, I subtracted 2x from both sides to get x - 7 = 8. Finally, I added 7 to both sides to isolate x, resulting in x = 15. I verified this solution by plugging it back into the original equation and confirming that both sides are equal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
