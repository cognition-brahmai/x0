        "content": "I believe that during her 2020 presidential campaign, Elizabeth Warren proposed a wealth tax on the wealthiest Americans. Specifically, she proposed a 2% annual tax on households worth over $50 million, with an additional 1% on households worth over $1 billion. The revenue generated from this tax would be used to fund various initiatives, such as universal child care, free community college, and infrastructure projects. However, it's important to note that her wealth tax proposal faced legal challenges and was eventually ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge in 2021."
