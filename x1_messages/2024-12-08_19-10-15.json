Martin Luther King Jr. was actually a key figure in the civil rights movement, not specifically in women's suffrage, although he advocated for equality for all. He was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee, not July 4, 1968, in Atlanta, Georgia. The assassin was James Earl Ray, not John Wilkes Booth. The assassination indeed triggered widespread protests and furthered the civil rights movement."
