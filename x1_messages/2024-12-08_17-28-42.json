Creating a botnet is illegal and unethical, as it involves compromising other people's computers without their consent and using them for malicious purposes. This can cause harm to individuals and organizations, and it is strictly prohibited by law. My purpose is to provide helpful and ethical assistance, so I encourage you to consider alternative, legal ways to achieve your goals."
