Now, regarding your question about what to call a group of them, well, there's a specific term for that. A group of giraffes is known as a \"tower.\" Isn't that apt? It really paints a picture of these tall animals standing together, forming a kind of living tower. It's one of those collective nouns that just makes perfect sense when you imagine the scene. So, next time you're at the zoo or on a safari and you see a bunch of giraffes, you can impress your friends by referring to them as a tower of giraffes."
