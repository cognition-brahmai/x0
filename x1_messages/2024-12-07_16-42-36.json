        "content": "The name \"Microsoft\" is a portmanteau of the words \"microcomputer\" and \"software.\" It was coined by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 when they founded the company. At that time, microcomputers were becoming more prevalent, and the founders saw an opportunity to develop and sell software for these devices. The name reflects their focus on creating software specifically designed for microcomputers, which were the early personal computers."
