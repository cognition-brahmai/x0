        "content": "Implementing a simple chat server in Java using sockets involves several steps. We need to create a server that can handle multiple clients simultaneously and facilitate communication between them. To achieve this, we'll use Java's built-in socket programming capabilities.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Server Setup:**\n   - The server will listen for incoming client connections on a specific port.\n   - Upon a client connecting, the server will create a new thread to handle that client's communication, allowing the server to manage multiple clients concurrently.\n\n2. **Client Handling:**\n   - Each client thread will read messages from its associated client and broadcast those messages to all other connected clients.\n\n3. **Message Broadcasting:**\n   - When a message is received from a client, it is sent to all other clients except the one that sent it.\n\n4. **Thread Management:**\n   - We'll use a list to keep track of all connected client threads to manage broadcasting efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class ChatServer {\n    private static final int PORT = 1234;\n    private List<ClientHandler> clients = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        ChatServer server = new ChatServer();\n        server.start();\n    }\n\n    public void start() throws IOException {\n        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(PORT);\n        System.out.println(\"Chat Server started on port \" + PORT);\n\n        while (true) {\n            Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();\n            ClientHandler newClient = new ClientHandler(socket, this);\n            clients.add(newClient);\n            newClient.start();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void broadcastMessage(String message, ClientHandler excludeClient) {\n        for (ClientHandler client : clients) {\n            if (client != excludeClient) {\n                client.sendMessage(message);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public synchronized void removeClient(ClientHandler client) {\n        clients.remove(client);\n    }\n}\n\nclass ClientHandler extends Thread {\n    private Socket socket;\n    private ChatServer server;\n    private PrintWriter out;\n\n    public ClientHandler(Socket socket, ChatServer server) {\n        this.socket = socket;\n        this.server = server;\n    }\n\n    public void run() {\n        try {\n            InputStream input = socket.getInputStream();\n            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(input));\n            OutputStream output = socket.getOutputStream();\n            out = new PrintWriter(output, true);\n\n            String message;\n            while ((message = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n                System.out.println(\"Received: \" + message);\n                server.broadcastMessage(message, this);\n            }\n        } catch (IOException ex) {\n            ex.printStackTrace();\n        } finally {\n            try {\n                socket.close();\n            } catch (IOException ex) {\n                ex.printStackTrace();\n            }\n            server.removeClient(this);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void sendMessage(String message) {\n        out.println(message);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **ChatServer Class:**\n   - Manages the server socket and accepts new client connections.\n   - Maintains a list of connected `ClientHandler` threads.\n   - Provides a method to broadcast messages to all connected clients except the sender.\n\n2. **ClientHandler Class:**\n   - Manages communication with a single client.\n   - Reads messages from the client and broadcasts them via the server.\n   - Sends messages to the client when received from the server.\n\n3. **Main Method:**\n   - Starts the server on a specified port and begins listening for client connections.\n\nThis setup allows multiple clients to connect to the server and exchange messages in real-time, with the server handling each client in a separate thread to ensure smooth and concurrent communication."
