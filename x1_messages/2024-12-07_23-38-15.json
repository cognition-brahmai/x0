        "content": "Cleopatra VII, known as Cleopatra, was the last active pharaoh of Ancient Egypt. She was married to two of her brothers, which was a common practice among Egyptian royalty to preserve the purity of the bloodline.\n\nFirst, she married her younger brother Ptolemy XIII in 51 BC when she ascended to the throne at the age of 18. However, their relationship was tumultuous, and they eventually became bitter enemies. Ptolemy XIII died in 47 BC during a conflict with Julius Caesar.\n\nLater, Cleopatra married another of her brothers, Ptolemy XIV, who was even younger than Ptolemy XIII. This marriage was also part of the political strategy to maintain power. Ptolemy XIV died mysteriously in 44 BC, and some speculate that Cleopatra may have had a role in his death to secure the throne for her son with Julius Caesar, Caesarion.\n\nAfter Julius Caesar's assassination in 44 BC, Cleopatra aligned herself with Mark Antony, a Roman general and politician. They had a relationship and had three children together: Cleopatra Selene II, Alexander Helios, and Ptolemy Philadelphus. Although they never officially married, their relationship was recognized in the Eastern provinces of the Roman Empire.\n\nIn 37 BC, Mark Antony married Octavia Minor, the sister of his political rival Octavian (later Augustus), as part of a political alliance. However, this marriage was strained, and Mark Antony eventually returned to Cleopatra.\n\nIn summary, Cleopatra was married to her brothers Ptolemy XIII and Ptolemy XIV, and had a long-term relationship with Mark Antony, though they were never officially married."
