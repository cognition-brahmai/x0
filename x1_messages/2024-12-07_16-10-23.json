        "content": "So the company sells products with a 20% profit margin, and they sell one item for $120. I need to find out what their cost was to produce that item.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a profit margin is. Profit margin is the percentage of profit relative to the selling price. So, if it's a 20% profit margin, that means that 20% of the selling price is profit.\n\nLet me denote the cost to produce the item as C. The selling price is $120, and the profit is 20% of the selling price.\n\nSo, profit = 20% of $120 = 0.20 * 120 = $24.\n\nNow, the selling price is equal to the cost plus the profit.\n\nSo, Selling Price = Cost + Profit\n\n$120 = C + $24\n\nTherefore, C = $120 - $24 = $96.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that profit margin can sometimes be calculated based on the cost, not the selling price. Maybe I should consider that.\n\nLet me look up the exact definition of profit margin.\n\nHmm, I see that profit margin can be defined in different ways. Some sources define it as profit divided by selling price, while others define it as profit divided by cost.\n\nI think in this case, since it's specified as a 20% profit margin, and without further specification, it's probably profit divided by selling price.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst scenario: profit margin is profit divided by selling price.\n\nSo, Profit Margin = Profit / Selling Price\n\n20% = Profit / $120\n\nTherefore, Profit = 0.20 * 120 = $24\n\nThen, Cost = Selling Price - Profit = $120 - $24 = $96\n\nSecond scenario: profit margin is profit divided by cost.\n\nSo, Profit Margin = Profit / Cost\n\n20% = Profit / C\n\nAlso, Selling Price = Cost + Profit = C + 0.20C = 1.20C\n\nTherefore, $120 = 1.20C\n\nSo, C = $120 / 1.20 = $100\n\nWait, that's different from the first scenario.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nI think the standard definition of profit margin is profit divided by selling price, but it's possible that different sources define it differently.\n\nPerhaps I should check the company's perspective.\n\nFrom the company's point of view, if they say they have a 20% profit margin, it might mean that for each dollar of sales, $0.20 is profit.\n\nThat aligns with the first scenario, where profit is 20% of the selling price.\n\nBut in business, I think it's more common to express profit margin based on selling price.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to consider both possibilities and see which one makes more sense.\n\nLet me compare the two scenarios:\n\nFirst scenario:\n\n- Selling Price: $120\n\n- Profit: $24\n\n- Cost: $96\n\n- Profit Margin: 20% (profit divided by selling price)\n\nSecond scenario:\n\n- Selling Price: $120\n\n- Profit: $20\n\n- Cost: $100\n\n- Profit Margin: 20% (profit divided by cost)\n\nWait, in the second scenario, if profit is $20 and cost is $100, then profit divided by cost is 20/100 = 20%, which matches the given profit margin.\n\nBut profit divided by selling price would be 20/120 = 16.67%, which is different.\n\nSo, in this case, if the profit margin is defined as profit divided by cost, then the cost is $100.\n\nAlternatively, if profit margin is profit divided by selling price, then cost is $96.\n\nBut the problem states \"20% profit margin,\" and it doesn't specify which type of profit margin.\n\nPerhaps I should assume the standard definition, which I believe is profit divided by selling price.\n\nIn that case, cost is $96.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company means a 20% profit margin based on cost.\n\nI think to resolve this, I need to consider common business practices.\n\nIn business, profit margin is often expressed as profit divided by selling price, which is also known as the gross profit margin.\n\nSo, in that case, cost would be $96.\n\nHowever, some sources define profit margin as profit divided by cost, which would make cost $100.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps I should ask for clarification.\n\nBut since this is a math problem, I'll proceed with the first scenario where profit margin is profit divided by selling price.\n\nTherefore, cost is $96.\n\nWait, but in the second scenario, if cost is $100 and profit is $20, then selling price is $120, which matches the given selling price.\n\nBut according to the problem, the profit margin is 20%.\n\nIf profit margin is defined as profit divided by cost, then 20% = $20 / $100, which holds true.\n\nAlternatively, if profit margin is profit divided by selling price, then 20% = $24 / $120, which also holds true.\n\nBut in the first case, profit is $24, and in the second, it's $20.\n\nSo, both scenarios satisfy the 20% profit margin, depending on how it's defined.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps I need to find another way to approach this problem.\n\nLet me consider the formula for profit margin.\n\nIf profit margin is defined as profit divided by selling price, then:\n\nProfit Margin = (Selling Price - Cost) / Selling Price\n\nGiven that profit margin is 20%, and selling price is $120, then:\n\n0.20 = (120 - C) / 120\n\nMultiplying both sides by 120:\n\n0.20 * 120 = 120 - C\n\n24 = 120 - C\n\nTherefore, C = 120 - 24 = $96\n\nAlternatively, if profit margin is defined as profit divided by cost, then:\n\nProfit Margin = (Selling Price - Cost) / Cost\n\n0.20 = (120 - C) / C\n\nMultiplying both sides by C:\n\n0.20C = 120 - C\n\nAdding C to both sides:\n\n1.20C = 120\n\nTherefore, C = 120 / 1.20 = $100\n\nSo, depending on the definition, cost is either $96 or $100.\n\nThis is problematic because I'm getting two different answers.\n\nI think the standard definition in business is profit margin as profit divided by selling price, which would make cost $96.\n\nHowever, some sources might define it differently.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the problem is using profit margin as profit divided by cost, which would make cost $100.\n\nBut to be safe, maybe I should consider both possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard way to interpret profit margin in such problems.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf the company has a 20% profit margin based on cost, then the selling price would be cost plus 20% of cost, which is 1.20 times cost.\n\nSo, Selling Price = 1.20 * Cost\n\nGiven Selling Price is $120, then Cost = $120 / 1.20 = $100\n\nAlternatively, if profit margin is 20% of selling price, then profit is $24, and cost is $96.\n\nBut which one is correct?\n\nI think in business, profit margin is often expressed as profit divided by selling price.\n\nIn that case, cost is $96.\n\nHowever, I've also seen examples where profit margin is defined as profit divided by cost.\n\nPerhaps the safest approach is to assume that profit margin is profit divided by selling price, unless stated otherwise.\n\nTherefore, cost is $96.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should consider both possibilities and see which one makes more sense in this context.\n\nIf cost is $96 and selling price is $120, then profit is $24, and profit margin is 24/120 = 20%, which matches the given profit margin.\n\nAlternatively, if cost is $100 and selling price is $120, then profit is $20, and profit margin based on cost is 20/100 = 20%, which also matches.\n\nSo both are possible, but perhaps the problem expects the first interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to trick me by using ambiguous terminology.\n\nIn that case, maybe I should consider the cost to be $100, based on the second scenario.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that profit margin is 20%, which means that the cost is 80% of the selling price.\n\nSo, Cost = 80% of Selling Price = 0.80 * 120 = $96\n\nWait, but in this case, profit would be $24, and profit margin would be 24/120 = 20%, which matches.\n\nAlternatively, if cost is $100, and selling price is $120, then cost is 100/120 = 83.33% of selling price, which doesn't align with a 20% profit margin.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIn the second scenario, cost is $100, selling price is $120, profit is $20, and profit margin based on cost is 20%, which is consistent with the given information.\n\nBut profit margin based on selling price would be 16.67%, which is different.\n\nSo, depending on the definition, different costs are possible.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects me to assume that profit margin is profit divided by selling price, in which case cost is $96.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's based on cost, making cost $100.\n\nI think the more common definition is profit margin as profit divided by selling price, so I'll go with cost = $96.\n\nTherefore, the company's cost to produce the item was $96.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{96} \\]"
