        "content": "Let's tackle this sequence problem. So, we have a sequence that starts with 2 and 4. Each next number is the sum of the previous two numbers minus 1. I need to find the seventh number in this sequence. Hmm, sounds like a recursive sequence, where each term depends on the previous ones.\n\nFirst, let's write down what we know:\n\n- First term, a1 = 2\n\n- Second term, a2 = 4\n\n- General rule: an = an-1 + an-2 - 1 for n \u2265 3\n\nOkay, so to find the seventh term, a7, I need to find a3 through a6 first, following the rule.\n\nLet's calculate a3:\n\na3 = a2 + a1 - 1 = 4 + 2 - 1 = 5\n\nAlright, a3 is 5.\n\nNow, a4:\n\na4 = a3 + a2 - 1 = 5 + 4 - 1 = 8\n\nSo, a4 is 8.\n\nNext, a5:\n\na5 = a4 + a3 - 1 = 8 + 5 - 1 = 12\n\na5 is 12.\n\nThen, a6:\n\na6 = a5 + a4 - 1 = 12 + 8 - 1 = 19\n\na6 is 19.\n\nFinally, a7:\n\na7 = a6 + a5 - 1 = 19 + 12 - 1 = 30\n\nSo, the seventh number is 30.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\na1 = 2\n\na2 = 4\n\na3 = 4 + 2 - 1 = 5 \u2713\n\na4 = 5 + 4 - 1 = 8 \u2713\n\na5 = 8 + 5 - 1 = 12 \u2713\n\na6 = 12 + 8 - 1 = 19 \u2713\n\na7 = 19 + 12 - 1 = 30 \u2713\n\nLooks good. But maybe there's another way to look at this sequence. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can directly give me the seventh term without calculating each step.\n\nLet's see, the sequence is defined recursively as an = an-1 + an-2 - 1.\n\nThis resembles the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the previous two, but with an extra \"-1\" each time.\n\nFibonacci sequence starts with a1 = 1, a2 = 1, and then an = an-1 + an-2.\n\nIn our case, a1 = 2, a2 = 4, and an = an-1 + an-2 - 1.\n\nMaybe I can find a relationship between our sequence and the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the Fibonacci sequence:\n\nF1 = 1\n\nF2 = 1\n\nF3 = 2\n\nF4 = 3\n\nF5 = 5\n\nF6 = 8\n\nF7 = 13\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, our sequence is:\n\na1 = 2\n\na2 = 4\n\na3 = 5\n\na4 = 8\n\na5 = 12\n\na6 = 19\n\na7 = 30\n\nComparing our sequence to the Fibonacci sequence:\n\na1 = F3 + 1 = 2 + 0 = 2\n\na2 = F5 - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4\n\na3 = F6 - 1 = 8 - 3 = 5\n\nWait, that doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different relationship.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a general formula for our sequence.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the characteristic equation for the recurrence relation.\n\nOur recurrence is an - an-1 - an-2 + 1 = 0.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, let's write it as:\n\nan - an-1 - an-2 = -1\n\nThe associated homogeneous recurrence is:\n\nan - an-1 - an-2 = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\nr^2 - r - 1 = 0\n\nSolutions are r = (1 \u00b1 sqrt(5))/2, which are the golden ratio and its conjugate.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is:\n\nan(h) = A * ((1 + sqrt(5))/2)^n + B * ((1 - sqrt(5))/2)^n)\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is -1, a constant, I can assume a particular solution that is a constant, say C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nC - C - C = -1 => -C = -1 => C = 1\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nan = A * ((1 + sqrt(5))/2)^n + B * ((1 - sqrt(5))/2)^n + 1\n\nNow, use initial conditions to solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a1 = 2 and a2 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\na1 = A * phi + B * (1 - phi) + 1 = 2\n\na2 = A * phi^2 + B * (1 - phi)^2 + 1 = 4\n\nWhere phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps it can be solved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way to find a7 without going through this bother.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern in the differences between terms.\n\nLet's list the terms again:\n\na1 = 2\n\na2 = 4\n\na3 = 5\n\na4 = 8\n\na5 = 12\n\na6 = 19\n\na7 = 30\n\nNow, let's look at the differences:\n\na2 - a1 = 2\n\na3 - a2 = 1\n\na4 - a3 = 3\n\na5 - a4 = 4\n\na6 - a5 = 7\n\na7 - a6 = 11\n\nHmm, the differences are: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11\n\nThis looks like each difference is the sum of the two previous differences.\n\nLet's check:\n\n1 = 2 + (-1), but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the differences themselves form a Fibonacci-like sequence.\n\nStarting with 2 and 1:\n\n2 + 1 = 3 \u2713\n\n1 + 3 = 4 \u2713\n\n3 + 4 = 7 \u2713\n\n4 + 7 = 11 \u2713\n\nSo, the differences are following the rule of being the sum of the two previous differences.\n\nThis suggests that the sequence can be built by adding these differences successively.\n\nStarting with a1 = 2, and differences: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, ...\n\nThen:\n\na1 = 2\n\na2 = a1 + 2 = 4\n\na3 = a2 + 1 = 5\n\na4 = a3 + 3 = 8\n\na5 = a4 + 4 = 12\n\na6 = a5 + 7 = 19\n\na7 = a6 + 11 = 30\n\nThis matches what I got earlier.\n\nNow, if I wanted to find a general formula, I could try to find a formula for the differences, which seem to follow a Fibonacci-like sequence starting from 2 and 1.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the differences as d1 = 2, d2 = 1, and dn = dn-1 + dn-2 for n \u2265 3.\n\nThis is exactly the Fibonacci sequence, but starting with d1 = 2 and d2 = 1.\n\nThe standard Fibonacci sequence is F1 = 1, F2 = 1, F3 = 2, F4 = 3, etc.\n\nSo, d1 = 2 = F3\n\nd2 = 1 = F2\n\nd3 = 3 = F4\n\nd4 = 4 = F5\n\nd5 = 7 = F7? Wait, F5 is 5, F6 is 8, F7 is 13. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that d1 = 2, d2 = 1, d3 = 3, d4 = 4, d5 = 7, d6 = 11, etc.\n\nThis seems to be a separate sequence from the standard Fibonacci sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the nth term of our sequence in terms of the sum of the differences.\n\nSince a(n) = a(1) + d1 + d2 + ... + d(n-1)\n\nSo, a7 = a1 + d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 = 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 11 = 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 11 = 2 + 2 = 4, 4 + 1 = 5, 5 + 3 = 8, 8 + 4 = 12, 12 + 7 = 19, 19 + 11 = 30. Again, 30.\n\nSo, consistently getting a7 = 30.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for a(n).\n\nGiven that the homogeneous solution involves the Fibonacci sequence, and the particular solution is a constant, perhaps there's a way to express a(n) in terms of Fibonacci numbers.\n\nRecall that the standard Fibonacci sequence is:\n\nF1 = 1, F2 = 1, F3 = 2, F4 = 3, F5 = 5, F6 = 8, F7 = 13, etc.\n\nIn our sequence, a1 = 2, a2 = 4, a3 = 5, a4 = 8, a5 = 12, a6 = 19, a7 = 30.\n\nLooking for a relationship:\n\na1 = 2 = F3 + F1\n\na2 = 4 = F5 - F1\n\na3 = 5 = F5\n\na4 = 8 = F6\n\na5 = 12 = F7 - F2\n\na6 = 19 = F9 - F3\n\na7 = 30 = F10 - F4\n\nHmm, not seeing a clear pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps expressing a(n) in terms of F(n) with some shifts and coefficients.\n\nThis might be too time-consuming for what we need.\n\nGiven that the recursive calculation gives a clear and consistent answer, and that the differences follow a Fibonacci-like sequence, I think it's safe to conclude that a7 = 30.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a generating function approach, but that might be beyond what's necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the homogeneous solution involves the Fibonacci sequence and find a general formula.\n\nRecall that the general solution is:\n\na(n) = A * phi^n + B * (-phi)^(-n) + 1\n\nWhere phi is the golden ratio.\n\nUsing initial conditions:\n\na1 = 2:\n\nA * phi + B * (-phi)^(-1) + 1 = 2\n\na2 = 4:\n\nA * phi^2 + B * (-phi)^(-2) + 1 = 4\n\nThis is a system of equations in A and B.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nFirst, express (-phi)^(-1):\n\nSince phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, then -phi^(-1) = (1 - sqrt(5))/2\n\nSo, let\u2019s denote:\n\nalpha = phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2\n\nbeta = (1 - sqrt(5))/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na(n) = A * alpha^n + B * beta^n + 1\n\nNow, the system is:\n\nA * alpha + B * beta + 1 = 2 => A * alpha + B * beta = 1\n\nA * alpha^2 + B * beta^2 + 1 = 4 => A * alpha^2 + B * beta^2 = 3\n\nNow, solve this system for A and B.\n\nLet\u2019s write it in matrix form:\n\n[alpha, beta] [A]   [1]\n\n[alpha^2, beta^2] [B] = [3]\n\nThe determinant D = alpha * beta^2 - beta * alpha^2\n\n= alpha * beta^2 - beta * alpha^2\n\n= alpha * beta * (beta - alpha)\n\nBut alpha * beta = -1, since alpha and beta are roots of x^2 - x - 1 = 0\n\nSo, D = (-1)(beta - alpha) = alpha - beta = sqrt(5)\n\nNow, A = (1 * alpha^2 - 3 * alpha) / D\n\nWait, let's use Cramer's rule.\n\nA = ( [1, beta] ) / D = (1 * beta^2 - 3 * beta) / sqrt(5)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use substitution or another method.\n\nAlternatively, since this is getting too complicated and time-consuming, and considering that the recursive method already gave us a7 = 30, perhaps it's safe to stick with that answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation of the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers minus 1.\"\n\nSo, an = an-1 + an-2 - 1\n\nWe used this recurrence and got a7 = 30.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's meant to be an = (an-1 + an-2) - 1\n\nWhich is the same as above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's an = an-1 + (an-2 - 1), which would be different.\n\nLet's check:\n\nIf an = an-1 + (an-2 - 1), that's the same as an = an-1 + an-2 - 1, which is what I used.\n\nSo, no difference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's an = an-1 + an-2 - 1^n, but 1^n is always 1, so no change.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's an = an-1 + an-2 - c, where c is a constant, and c=1, which is again what I used.\n\nSo, I think the recursive formula is correctly applied.\n\nTherefore, the seventh number in the sequence is 30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
