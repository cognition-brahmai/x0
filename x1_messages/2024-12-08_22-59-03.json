        "content": "So there are 1200 students in total, and 60% of them play at least one sport. First, I need to find out how many students actually play sports.\n\nSo, 60% of 1200 is calculated as:\n\n0.60 \u00d7 1200 = 720 students play at least one sport.\n\nNow, out of these 720 students, 30% participate in more than one sport. So, I need to find out how many that is.\n\n30% of 720 is:\n\n0.30 \u00d7 720 = 216 students participate in more than one sport.\n\nThe question is asking for the number of students who only participate in one sport. So, I need to subtract the number of students who play more than one sport from the total number of students who play sports.\n\nSo, 720 (total sports players) - 216 (play more than one sport) = 504 students only participate in one sport.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this to confirm the answer?\n\nLet me consider that 720 students play at least one sport. Among them, 216 play more than one sport. So, the remaining should be playing exactly one sport.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, 504 students only participate in one sport.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{504} \\]"
