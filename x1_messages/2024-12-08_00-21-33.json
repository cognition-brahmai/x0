First, we need to figure out how many employees are currently working in each department.\n\nThe company has a total of 120 employees.\n\n- 40% work in sales:\n\nSales employees = 40% of 120 = 0.40 \u00d7 120 = 48 employees\n\n- 30% work in marketing:\n\nMarketing employees = 30% of 120 = 0.30 \u00d7 120 = 36 employees\n\n- The remaining employees work in finance.\n\nFirst, let's find out what percentage of employees work in finance.\n\nTotal percentage = 100%\n\nPercentage in finance = 100% - (40% + 30%) = 100% - 70% = 30%\n\nSo, finance employees = 30% of 120 = 0.30 \u00d7 120 = 36 employees\n\nNow, the company wants to increase its finance department by 50%.\n\nIncrease in finance employees = 50% of current finance employees\n\n= 0.50 \u00d7 36 = 18 employees\n\nTherefore, the company needs to hire 18 new employees to increase the finance department by 50%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
