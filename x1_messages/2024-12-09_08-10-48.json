        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a class of 30 students, and they play different sports: soccer, basketball, and volleyball. Specifically, 18 play soccer, 20 play basketball, and 22 play volleyball. Additionally, we're told that 10 students play all three sports. The question is asking how many students play at least two sports.\n\nFirst, I think I should recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion because it's useful for counting elements in overlapping sets. The formula for three sets is:\n\n\\[\n|A \\cup B \\cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \\cap B| - |A \\cap C| - |B \\cap C| + |A \\cap B \\cap C|\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) represent the sets of students playing soccer, basketball, and volleyball, respectively.\n\nWe know the total number of students is 30, and that's the same as the union of these three sets, assuming every student plays at least one sport. Wait, the problem doesn't specify if there are students who don't play any sports. I should consider that possibility.\n\nAssuming that all 30 students play at least one sport, then:\n\n\\[\n|A \\cup B \\cup C| = 30\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n|A| = 18, \\quad |B| = 20, \\quad |C| = 22, \\quad |A \\cap B \\cap C| = 10\n\\]\n\nPlugging these into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\n\\[\n30 = 18 + 20 + 22 - |A \\cap B| - |A \\cap C| - |B \\cap C| + 10\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n30 = 60 - (|A \\cap B| + |A \\cap C| + |B \\cap C|) + 10\n\\]\n\n\\[\n30 = 70 - (|A \\cap B| + |A \\cap C| + |B \\cap C|)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n|A \\cap B| + |A \\cap C| + |B \\cap C| = 70 - 30 = 40\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the number of students who play at least two sports. That would include those who play exactly two sports and those who play all three.\n\nThe number of students who play exactly two sports can be found by subtracting those who play all three sports from each of the two-intersection terms.\n\nSo, the number of students who play exactly two sports is:\n\n\\[\n(|A \\cap B| - |A \\cap B \\cap C|) + (|A \\cap C| - |A \\cap B \\cap C|) + (|B \\cap C| - |A \\cap B \\cap C|)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= (|A \\cap B| + |A \\cap C| + |B \\cap C|) - 3 \\times |A \\cap B \\cap C|\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 40 - 3 \\times 10 = 40 - 30 = 10\n\\]\n\nThen, the number of students who play at least two sports is the sum of those who play exactly two sports and those who play all three:\n\n\\[\n10 + 10 = 20\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I should double-check if there's any assumption I'm missing. The problem doesn't explicitly state that all students play at least one sport. If there are students who don't play any sports, then the total number of students playing at least one sport would be less than 30.\n\nLet me check that. If some students don't play any sports, then:\n\n\\[\n|A \\cup B \\cup C| < 30\n\\]\n\nBut in the inclusion-exclusion formula, we have:\n\n\\[\n|A \\cup B \\cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \\cap B| - |A \\cap C| - |B \\cap C| + |A \\cap B \\cap C|\n\\]\n\nWe don't know \\( |A \\cup B \\cup C| \\) in this case. However, we can calculate it using the numbers we have.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n|A| + |B| + |C| = 18 + 20 + 22 = 60\n\\]\n\nAnd we found that:\n\n\\[\n|A \\cap B| + |A \\cap C| + |B \\cap C| = 40\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n|A \\cup B \\cup C| = 60 - 40 + 10 = 30\n\\]\n\nThis matches the total number of students, meaning that all 30 students play at least one sport. Therefore, my initial assumption was correct.\n\nThus, the number of students who play at least two sports is indeed 20.\n\nBut let me think differently to confirm. Another way to approach this is to consider the number of students playing exactly two sports and those playing all three.\n\nWe can denote:\n\n- \\( x \\) = number of students playing only soccer\n\n- \\( y \\) = number of students playing only basketball\n\n- \\( z \\) = number of students playing only volleyball\n\n- \\( a \\) = number of students playing soccer and basketball but not volleyball\n\n- \\( b \\) = number of students playing soccer and volleyball but not basketball\n\n- \\( c \\) = number of students playing basketball and volleyball but not soccer\n\n- \\( d \\) = number of students playing all three sports\n\nFrom the problem, \\( d = 10 \\).\n\nThen, the total number of students playing soccer is:\n\n\\[\nx + a + b + d = 18\n\\]\n\nSimilarly:\n\n\\[\ny + a + c + d = 20\n\\]\n\n\\[\nz + b + c + d = 22\n\\]\n\nAnd the total number of students is:\n\n\\[\nx + y + z + a + b + c + d = 30\n\\]\n\nWe can substitute \\( d = 10 \\) into these equations:\n\n1. \\( x + a + b + 10 = 18 \\) \u21d2 \\( x + a + b = 8 \\)\n\n2. \\( y + a + c + 10 = 20 \\) \u21d2 \\( y + a + c = 10 \\)\n\n3. \\( z + b + c + 10 = 22 \\) \u21d2 \\( z + b + c = 12 \\)\n\n4. \\( x + y + z + a + b + c + 10 = 30 \\) \u21d2 \\( x + y + z + a + b + c = 20 \\)\n\nNow, adding equations 1, 2, and 3:\n\n\\[\n(x + a + b) + (y + a + c) + (z + b + c) = 8 + 10 + 12 = 30\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx + y + z + 2a + 2b + 2c = 30\n\\]\n\nBut from equation 4, \\( x + y + z + a + b + c = 20 \\). Let's denote \\( x + y + z + a + b + c = 20 \\).\n\nSubtracting equation 4 from the sum of equations 1,2,3:\n\n\\[\n(x + y + z + 2a + 2b + 2c) - (x + y + z + a + b + c) = 30 - 20\n\\]\n\n\\[\na + b + c = 10\n\\]\n\nNow, the number of students playing at least two sports is \\( a + b + c + d = 10 + 10 = 20 \\), which matches our previous result.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who play at least two sports is 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
