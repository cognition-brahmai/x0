The Swiss flag consists of a red field with a white cross in the center, which is known as the \"Swiss cross.\" This design has been used since the 14th century and holds significant meaning for the Swiss people, representing their faith and valor. However, it's worth noting that the flag of Sweden also features a blue cross on a yellow field, but in your description, you mentioned a white cross on a red background, which matches the Swiss flag."
