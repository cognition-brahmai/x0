        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to find out how many handshakes occur in total.\n\nFirst, I think about smaller numbers to understand the pattern. For example, if there are 2 people, they shake hands once, so there's 1 handshake. If there are 3 people, person A shakes hands with B and C, and B shakes hands with C, so that's 3 handshakes. For 4 people, A shakes hands with B, C, and D, B shakes hands with C and D, and C shakes hands with D, which is 6 handshakes.\n\nI notice that for n people, each person shakes hands with (n-1) others. But if I multiply n by (n-1), I'm counting each handshake twice because when A shakes hands with B, it's the same as B shaking hands with A. So, to get the correct total, I need to divide by 2.\n\nSo, the formula should be:\n\nTotal handshakes = n(n-1)/2\n\nIn this case, n is 100.\n\nSo, total handshakes = 100 * 99 / 2\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n100 * 99 = 9900\n\n9900 / 2 = 4950\n\nTherefore, there are 4950 handshakes in total.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using combinations. Because selecting 2 people out of 100 to shake hands is the same as choosing 2 items from 100, which is a combination.\n\nThe combination formula is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 100 and k = 2.\n\nSo, C(100, 2) = 100! / (2!(100-2)!) = (100*99*98!) / (2*1 * 98!)) = (100*99) / 2 = 4950\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using graphs. If each person is a node and each handshake is an edge, then this is like finding the number of edges in a complete graph with 100 nodes.\n\nIn graph theory, the number of edges in a complete graph with n nodes is also n(n-1)/2, which again is 4950 for n=100.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I keep getting 4950 as the answer.\n\nLet me double-check with smaller numbers to ensure the formula is correct.\n\nFor n=2: 2*1/2 = 1 handshake (correct)\n\nFor n=3: 3*2/2 = 3 handshakes (correct)\n\nFor n=4: 4*3/2 = 6 handshakes (correct)\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes is 4950.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4950} \\]"
