        "content": "Certainly! I can help you with that. Let's implement a Java method to check if a given number is prime or not.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a prime number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, the first six prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.\n\nTo check if a number is prime, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. If the number is less than 2, it's not prime.\n\n2. Check if the number is divisible by any number from 2 up to the square root of the number. If it is, then it's not prime.\n\n3. If none of the above conditions are met, the number is prime.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Java.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Java method that checks if a given number is prime, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check if the number is less than 2**: Numbers less than 2 are not prime.\n2. **Check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number**: If the number is divisible by any number in this range, it is not prime.\n3. **If no divisors are found**, the number is prime.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\npublic class PrimeChecker {\n\n    /**\n     * Checks if the given number is a prime number.\n     * \n     * @param number The number to check for primality.\n     * @return true if the number is prime, false otherwise.\n     */\n    public static boolean isPrime(int number) {\n        if (number < 2) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(number); i++) {\n            if (number % i == 0) {\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int numberToCheck = 29;\n        if (isPrime(numberToCheck)) {\n            System.out.println(numberToCheck + \" is a prime number.\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(numberToCheck + \" is not a prime number.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Check if number is less than 2**:\n   - If the number is less than 2, it's not prime, so we return `false`.\n\n2. **Loop from 2 to the square root of the number**:\n   - We use a `for` loop that starts from 2 and goes up to the square root of the number (calculated using `Math.sqrt(number)`).\n   - For each iteration, we check if the number is divisible by the current iterator value (`i`). If it is, the number is not prime, and we return `false`.\n\n3. **If no divisors are found**:\n   - If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the number is prime, and we return `true`.\n\nThis method efficiently checks for primality by reducing the number of divisions needed, thanks to the square root optimization."
