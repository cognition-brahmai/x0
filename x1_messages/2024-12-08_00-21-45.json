        "content": "So I've got this equation to solve: (4x\u00b2 - 9)/(2x - 3) = 0. Alright, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that when you have a fraction equal to zero, the numerator has to be zero, right? As long as the denominator isn't zero. So, in this case, the numerator is 4x\u00b2 - 9, and the denominator is 2x - 3.\n\nSo, I need to set the numerator equal to zero: 4x\u00b2 - 9 = 0.\n\nHmm, this looks like a difference of squares. Yeah, because 4x\u00b2 is (2x)\u00b2 and 9 is 3\u00b2. So, I can factor this as (2x - 3)(2x + 3) = 0.\n\nSo, setting each factor equal to zero gives me:\n\n2x - 3 = 0 \u21d2 2x = 3 \u21d2 x = 3/2.\n\nAnd\n\n2x + 3 = 0 \u21d2 2x = -3 \u21d2 x = -3/2.\n\nBut wait, I have to check if these values make the denominator zero.\n\nThe denominator is 2x - 3.\n\nPlugging in x = 3/2: 2*(3/2) - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0. Oh, that's zero. So, x = 3/2 makes the denominator zero, which means it's not a valid solution.\n\nNow, checking x = -3/2: 2*(-3/2) - 3 = -3 - 3 = -6, which is not zero. So, x = -3/2 is a valid solution.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe I can simplify the original expression before setting it equal to zero.\n\nLet's see, (4x\u00b2 - 9)/(2x - 3). Since 4x\u00b2 - 9 factors into (2x - 3)(2x + 3), I can write the expression as:\n\n(2x - 3)(2x + 3)/(2x - 3).\n\nAssuming 2x - 3 \u2260 0, I can cancel out the (2x - 3) terms, leaving me with 2x + 3.\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to 2x + 3, as long as x \u2260 3/2.\n\nNow, setting 2x + 3 = 0 gives me x = -3/2, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nSo, the only solution is x = -3/2.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's plug x = -3/2 back into the original equation to make sure it works.\n\nCompute the numerator: 4*(-3/2)\u00b2 - 9 = 4*(9/4) - 9 = 9 - 9 = 0.\n\nDenominator: 2*(-3/2) - 3 = -3 - 3 = -6.\n\nSo, 0/-6 = 0, which checks out.\n\nNow, what about x = 3/2? Even though it makes the denominator zero, I'm curious why it's not a solution.\n\nIf I plug x = 3/2 into the numerator: 4*(3/2)\u00b2 - 9 = 4*(9/4) - 9 = 9 - 9 = 0.\n\nDenominator: 2*(3/2) - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0.\n\nSo, 0/0 is indeterminate, which is undefined. That's why x = 3/2 is not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x = -3/2.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, is there any other possible solutions I might have missed?\n\nLet me consider the domain of the original equation. The denominator cannot be zero, so 2x - 3 \u2260 0 \u21d2 x \u2260 3/2.\n\nSo, the domain is all real numbers except x = 3/2.\n\nWithin this domain, the only value that makes the numerator zero is x = -3/2.\n\nTherefore, no other solutions exist.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the graph of the function y = (4x\u00b2 - 9)/(2x - 3), it should have a hole at x = 3/2 because that's where the denominator is zero.\n\nAnd the graph should be equivalent to y = 2x + 3, which is a straight line, but with a hole at x = 3/2.\n\nSetting y = 0, we find x = -3/2, which is the only x-intercept.\n\nSo, everything points to x = -3/2 being the only solution.\n\nIs there any other approach I can take to confirm this?\n\nMaybe using polynomial division.\n\nLet's divide 4x\u00b2 - 9 by 2x - 3.\n\nUsing long division:\n\n2x - 3 | 4x\u00b2 + 0x - 9\n\nFirst, 4x\u00b2 divided by 2x is 2x.\n\nMultiply 2x by 2x - 3: 4x\u00b2 - 6x.\n\nSubtract: (4x\u00b2 + 0x - 9) - (4x\u00b2 - 6x) = 6x - 9.\n\nNow, 6x divided by 2x is 3.\n\nMultiply 3 by 2x - 3: 6x - 9.\n\nSubtract: (6x - 9) - (6x - 9) = 0.\n\nSo, the division gives 2x + 3 with no remainder.\n\nTherefore, (4x\u00b2 - 9)/(2x - 3) = 2x + 3, for x \u2260 3/2.\n\nSetting 2x + 3 = 0 gives x = -3/2, which is within the domain.\n\nHence, confirmed again that x = -3/2 is the only solution.\n\nI think that's pretty much it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-\\dfrac{3}{2}} \\]"
