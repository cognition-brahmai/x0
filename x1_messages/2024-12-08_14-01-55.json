        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we know the train travels from station A to station B at an average speed of 60 miles per hour and it takes 2 hours to do so. So, we can calculate the distance between station A and station B.\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\nDistance from A to B = 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nNow, it stops at station B for 30 minutes. We need to remember to include this stop time in the total journey time.\n\nNext, it continues to station C, which is twice as far away as station A to station B. So, the distance from station B to station C is twice 120 miles.\n\nDistance from B to C = 2 \u00d7 120 miles = 240 miles\n\nWe need to find out how long it takes to travel from station A to station C. This includes three parts:\n\n1. Travel time from A to B: 2 hours\n\n2. Stop time at B: 30 minutes\n\n3. Travel time from B to C\n\nFirst, let's find the travel time from B to C. We know the speed is still 60 mph and the distance is 240 miles.\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime from B to C = 240 miles / 60 mph = 4 hours\n\nNow, let's add up all the parts:\n\nTravel time A to B: 2 hours\n\nStop time at B: 0.5 hours (30 minutes)\n\nTravel time B to C: 4 hours\n\nTotal time = 2 + 0.5 + 4 = 6.5 hours\n\nSo, it takes 6.5 hours to travel from station A to station C.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, the total distance from A to C is the sum of A to B and B to C, which is 120 miles + 240 miles = 360 miles.\n\nIf the train travels at 60 mph, the total travel time without stops would be 360 miles / 60 mph = 6 hours.\n\nBut we have a 30-minute stop at station B, so total time is 6 hours + 0.5 hours = 6.5 hours.\n\nYes, that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total time to travel from station A to station C is 6.5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
