        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a C# application that reads from a text file, processes some data, and writes the results to another file. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I cover all the bases, especially since I have to handle exceptions and use command line arguments. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the input file looks like. It's supposed to contain lines of space-separated integers. So, each line has multiple integers separated by spaces. My job is to read each line, calculate the sum and average of those integers, and then write those results to a new text file.\n\nOkay, so I need to handle file I/O. In C#, I can use the `System.IO` namespace for reading from and writing to files. Since I need to read lines from a file, I can use `File.ReadAllLines` method, which returns an array of strings, each representing a line in the file.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if the file might be large. Reading the entire file into memory might not be efficient for very large files. Maybe I should read the file line by line using a `StreamReader` instead. That way, I can process each line one at a time, which is more memory-efficient.\n\nAlright, so I'll go with `StreamReader` to read the file line by line.\n\nNow, command line arguments. I need to accept input and output file paths via the command line. In C#, the `Main` method can accept an array of strings, which are the command line arguments.\n\nI should check if the correct number of arguments are provided. I need two arguments: the input file path and the output file path. If the user doesn't provide exactly two arguments, I should display a usage message and exit.\n\nNext, I need to read each line from the input file, split the line into integers, calculate the sum and average, and write those to the output file.\n\nLet's think about how to parse the line into integers. I can use the `Split` method to split the line by spaces, and then convert each substring to an integer using `int.Parse`.\n\nBut `int.Parse` can throw a `FormatException` if the substring is not a valid integer. So, I need to handle that exception. Maybe I should use `int.TryParse` instead, which returns a boolean indicating whether the parsing was successful, and takes an out parameter for the parsed integer.\n\nThat's better, because it allows me to handle invalid data without crashing the application.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if a line is empty or contains only spaces. In that case, splitting will result in an empty array, and I should probably handle that gracefully, maybe by skipping such lines or treating them as lines with zero integers.\n\nNow, for calculating the sum and average. The sum is straightforward: just add up all the integers in the line. The average is the sum divided by the number of integers. But I need to be careful when there are zero integers to avoid division by zero.\n\nSo, for each line, I'll count the number of valid integers. If the count is greater than zero, I'll calculate the sum and average. Otherwise, I'll perhaps write a message indicating that the line had no valid integers.\n\nI should also think about the format of the output. The task says to write the results to a new text file. I need to decide how to structure the output. Maybe for each input line, I'll write a corresponding line in the output file with the sum and average, separated by a space or tab.\n\nFor example, if the input line is \"1 2 3\", the output could be \"6 2\" (sum is 6, average is 2).\n\nI should also consider adding some header in the output file to make it clear what the numbers represent.\n\nAdditionally, I need to handle any potential exceptions that might occur, such as file not found, insufficient permissions, etc.\n\nSo, I'll need to use try-catch blocks around the file operations and parsing operations to handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.\n\nLet me outline the steps I need to implement:\n\n1. Check command line arguments:\n\na. Ensure exactly two arguments are provided: input file path and output file path.\n\nb. If not, display usage message and exit.\n\n2. Try to open the input file using a StreamReader.\n\na. Handle exceptions if the file cannot be opened (e.g., file not found, access denied).\n\n3. Create a new output file using a StreamWriter.\n\na. Handle exceptions if the file cannot be created or written to.\n\n4. Read each line from the input file.\n\na. For each line:\n\ni. Split the line by spaces to get an array of substrings.\n\nii. Initialize sum to 0 and count to 0.\n\niii. For each substring:\n\n- Use int.TryParse to convert to integer.\n\n- If successful, add to sum and increment count.\n\niv. If count > 0:\n\n- Calculate average as sum / count.\n\n- Write sum and average to the output file, separated by a space.\n\nv. Else:\n\n- Write a message indicating no valid integers in the line.\n\n5. Close both StreamReader and StreamWriter.\n\na. Ensure resources are disposed properly, maybe using the 'using' statement.\n\n6. Handle any exceptions that occur during processing and provide user-friendly error messages.\n\nNow, I need to think about how to structure the code. Since this is a console application, I'll create a new C# console project.\n\nI'll need to include the necessary namespaces:\n\n- `System`\n\n- `System.IO`\n\n- `System.ArgumentException`\n\nI should also consider making the application able to handle large files efficiently, so reading line by line is a good approach.\n\nLet me sketch a rough code structure:\n\n```\n\nusing System;\n\nusing System.IO;\n\nclass Program\n\n{\n\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n\n    {\n\n        if (args.Length != 2)\n\n        {\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Usage: Program.exe inputfile outputfile\");\n\n            return;\n\n        }\n\n        string inputPath = args[0];\n\n        string outputPath = args[1];\n\n        try\n\n        {\n\n            using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(inputPath))\n\n            using (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(outputPath))\n\n            {\n\n                string line;\n\n                while ((line = reader.ReadLine()) != null)\n\n                {\n\n                    string[] parts = line.Split(new char[] { ' ' }, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);\n\n                    int sum = 0;\n\n                    int count = 0;\n\n                    foreach (string part in parts)\n\n                    {\n\n                        if (int.TryParse(part, out int number))\n\n                        {\n\n                            sum += number;\n\n                            count++;\n\n                        }\n\n                    }\n\n                    if (count > 0)\n\n                    {\n\n                        double average = (double)sum / count;\n\n                        writer.WriteLine($\"{sum} {average}\");\n\n                    }\n\n                    else\n\n                    {\n\n                        writer.WriteLine(\"No valid integers in line.\");\n\n                    }\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        catch (Exception ex)\n\n        {\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"An error occurred: \" + ex.Message);\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis seems like a solid starting point. Now, I need to consider edge cases and potential improvements.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n1. Empty file: Should handle zero lines gracefully.\n\n2. Lines with only spaces: Should recognize no valid integers.\n\n3. Lines with non-integer values: Should skip invalid entries without crashing.\n\n4. Very large files: Should handle them efficiently since we're reading line by line.\n\n5. Non-existent input file: Should handle file not found exception.\n\n6. Insufficient permissions: Should handle access denied exception.\n\n7. Output file cannot be created: Should handle exception.\n\nPotential Improvements:\n\n1. Allow the user to specify delimiters other than space.\n\n2. Provide more detailed statistics, like minimum and maximum values per line.\n\n3. Add options to format the output (e.g., decimal places for averages).\n\n4. Handle different number formats (e.g., cultures with different decimal separators).\n\nBut for now, I'll stick to the basic requirements.\n\nI should also think about how to test this application. I'll need to create sample input files with different scenarios:\n\n- A file with valid integer lines.\n\n- A file with mixed valid and invalid lines.\n\n- A file with empty lines.\n\n- A file with only spaces.\n\n- A very large file to test performance.\n\nI can then run the application with these input files and check if the output files contain the correct sums and averages.\n\nAdditionally, I should test the exception handling by providing invalid file paths or insufficient permissions.\n\nAlright, I think I have a good plan here. Let me proceed to implement the code based on this outline.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a C# application that reads a text file containing lines of space-separated integers, calculates the sum and average of each line, and writes the results to a new text file. The application should use command line arguments for input and output file paths and handle any potential exceptions.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Check Command Line Arguments:**\n   - Ensure exactly two arguments are provided: input file path and output file path.\n   - Display a usage message and exit if arguments are incorrect.\n\n2. **Read Input File:**\n   - Use `StreamReader` to read the input file line by line for efficiency.\n   \n3. **Process Each Line:**\n   - Split each line by spaces to get individual integers.\n   - Use `int.TryParse` to parse and handle any invalid integers gracefully.\n   - Calculate the sum and average of valid integers.\n   - Write the results to the output file.\n\n4. **Handle Exceptions:**\n   - Catch and display any exceptions that occur during file operations or data processing.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        if (args.Length != 2)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Usage: Program.exe inputfile outputfile\");\n            return;\n        }\n\n        string inputPath = args[0];\n        string outputPath = args[1];\n\n        try\n        {\n            using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(inputPath))\n            using (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(outputPath))\n            {\n                string line;\n                while ((line = reader.ReadLine()) != null)\n                {\n                    string[] parts = line.Split(new char[] { ' ' }, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);\n                    int sum = 0;\n                    int count = 0;\n                    foreach (string part in parts)\n                    {\n                        if (int.TryParse(part, out int number))\n                        {\n                            sum += number;\n                            count++;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    if (count > 0)\n                    {\n                        double average = (double)sum / count;\n                        writer.WriteLine($\"{sum} {average}\");\n                    }\n                    else\n                    {\n                        writer.WriteLine(\"No valid integers in line.\");\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        catch (Exception ex)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"An error occurred: \" + ex.Message);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Command Line Arguments:**\n   - The program checks if exactly two arguments are provided. If not, it displays a usage message.\n\n2. **File Reading and Writing:**\n   - `StreamReader` and `StreamWriter` are used for reading and writing files line by line, which is memory efficient.\n\n3. **Data Processing:**\n   - Each line is split by spaces, and `int.TryParse` is used to parse integers while ignoring invalid entries.\n   - Sum and average are calculated for each line and written to the output file.\n\n4. **Exception Handling:**\n   - Any exceptions during file operations or data parsing are caught and an error message is displayed.\n\nThis approach ensures the program handles various edge cases and operates efficiently even with large files."
