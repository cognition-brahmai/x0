        "content": "So I've got this problem here about figuring out the best way to order flooring material for a big residential project. There are 10 apartment buildings, each with 50 units, and each unit needs 2,000 square feet of flooring. The flooring comes in rolls that cover 200 square feet each, and there's a 5% discount if I order more than 500 rolls at once. I need to find out the optimal order quantity to save money but also make sure I have enough material.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total amount of flooring material required for the entire project. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of units:\n\n10 buildings \u00d7 50 units/building = 500 units\n\n2. Calculate the total square footage needed:\n\n500 units \u00d7 2,000 sq ft/unit = 1,000,000 sq ft\n\n3. Determine how many rolls are needed:\n\nEach roll covers 200 sq ft, so:\n\n1,000,000 sq ft \u00f7 200 sq ft/roll = 5,000 rolls\n\nSo, I need 5,000 rolls in total.\n\nNow, there's a discount if I order more than 500 rolls at a time. But the problem doesn't specify any other costs, like ordering costs or holding costs, which are common in inventory management problems. It seems like the main goal is to minimize the cost by taking advantage of the volume discount.\n\nLet me assume that the only cost consideration is the discount for ordering more than 500 rolls at a time. If I order 5,000 rolls in one go, I get a 5% discount. If I order in smaller quantities, say 500 rolls at a time, I don't get the discount.\n\nLet me consider the cost differences.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the cost per roll without discount as C.\n\nThen, the cost with discount is C - 0.05C = 0.95C per roll.\n\nIf I order all 5,000 rolls at once, the total cost is:\n\n5,000 rolls \u00d7 0.95C = 4,750C\n\nIf I order in quantities of 500 rolls at a time, without discount, the cost per order is:\n\n500 rolls \u00d7 C = 500C\n\nTo get 5,000 rolls, I would need to place 10 orders (since 5,000 \u00f7 500 = 10).\n\nSo, total cost without discount is:\n\n10 orders \u00d7 500C = 5,000C\n\nComparing the two:\n\n- Ordering all at once: 4,750C\n\n- Ordering in 500-roll increments: 5,000C\n\nThe all-at-once order is cheaper by 250C.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are other factors to consider. For example, if there are ordering costs or holding costs.\n\nOrdering cost is the cost associated with placing an order, which might include administrative fees, delivery charges, etc. Holding cost is the cost of storing the materials over time.\n\nIf there are ordering costs, then ordering in smaller quantities more frequently would increase the total ordering cost. If there are holding costs, storing a large quantity would incur higher holding costs.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify these costs, I'll assume they are negligible or not applicable.\n\nAnother consideration is cash flow. Ordering all at once might require a larger upfront payment, which could be a burden on the company's cash flow. However, since the problem is about minimizing costs, and doesn't specify any constraints on cash flow, I'll proceed without considering this.\n\nAlso, there might be storage constraints. Ordering 5,000 rolls at once would require sufficient storage space, which might not be available. But again, the problem doesn't mention any storage limitations, so I'll assume it's not an issue.\n\nAdditionally, there could be delivery time constraints. Maybe the supplier can't deliver 5,000 rolls at once, or perhaps the construction schedule requires rolls to be delivered in stages.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't provide that information, I'll assume that ordering any quantity is feasible in terms of delivery and storage.\n\nGiven that, the optimal order quantity seems to be 5,000 rolls at once, to take advantage of the volume discount and minimize total cost.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a way to optimize this further. What if I order in quantities larger than 500 rolls but less than 5,000, say 1,000 rolls at a time? Would that still qualify for the discount, and might there be some cost savings?\n\nLet me check.\n\nThe discount is for orders exceeding 500 rolls.\n\nSo, if I order 1,000 rolls at a time, I get the 5% discount.\n\nTotal number of orders needed: 5,000 \u00f7 1,000 = 5 orders\n\nTotal cost: 5 orders \u00d7 1,000 rolls/order \u00d7 0.95C = 4,750C\n\nSame as ordering all at once.\n\nSo, in terms of material cost, it's the same as ordering all at once.\n\nBut if there are ordering costs, ordering 1,000 rolls at a time would result in fewer orders, which might reduce ordering costs.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify ordering costs, I'll disregard this for now.\n\nSimilarly, holding costs might differ. If I order larger quantities at once, I might have higher holding costs because I'm storing more material.\n\nAgain, without specific cost data, it's hard to factor this in.\n\nGiven the information provided, the optimal order quantity to minimize material costs is to order all 5,000 rolls at once, taking advantage of the 5% discount.\n\nThis would result in a total material cost of 4,750C, compared to 5,000C without the discount.\n\nTherefore, the company should order 5,000 rolls in a single order to minimize costs while ensuring sufficient materials for the project.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{5000 \\text{ rolls}}"
