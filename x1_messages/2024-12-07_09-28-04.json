        "content": "Let's see what's going on here. So, Mary has two jars of cookies, one labeled \"chocolate chip\" and the other \"oatmeal raisin.\" But then Nancy comes in and swaps the labels without Mary noticing. So now, the jar that actually has chocolate chip cookies is labeled \"oatmeal raisin,\" and the one with oatmeal raisin cookies is labeled \"chocolate chip.\"\n\nThen, Olivia comes in and takes all the cookies from the jar that is supposed to have chocolate chip cookies but is now labeled \"oatmeal raisin,\" and replaces them with peanut butter cookies. So, the jar that was originally supposed to have chocolate chip cookies now has peanut butter cookies and is labeled \"oatmeal raisin.\" The other jar still has oatmeal raisin cookies but is labeled \"chocolate chip.\"\n\nNow, Mary, Nancy, and Olivia sit down to enjoy some cookies. Let's try to figure out what each of them thinks about the contents of the jars.\n\nFirst, Mary:\n\n- Mary originally labeled the jars correctly: chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin.\n\n- But Nancy swapped the labels without Mary knowing.\n\n- So, Mary thinks that the jar labeled \"oatmeal raisin\" has oatmeal raisin cookies, and the jar labeled \"chocolate chip\" has chocolate chip cookies.\n\n- Then, Olivia took cookies from the jar that Mary thinks is oatmeal raisin (but actually is chocolate chip) and replaced them with peanut butter cookies.\n\n- Mary doesn't know that Olivia did this.\n\n- Therefore, Mary still thinks that the jar labeled \"oatmeal raisin\" has oatmeal raisin cookies, and the jar labeled \"chocolate chip\" has chocolate chip cookies.\n\nNext, Nancy:\n\n- Nancy knows that she swapped the labels.\n\n- So, she knows that the jar labeled \"oatmeal raisin\" actually has chocolate chip cookies, and the jar labeled \"chocolate chip\" actually has oatmeal raisin cookies.\n\n- However, she doesn't know that Olivia came in and replaced the cookies in one of the jars.\n\n- Therefore, Nancy thinks that the jar labeled \"oatmeal raisin\" has chocolate chip cookies, and the jar labeled \"chocolate chip\" has oatmeal raisin cookies.\n\nFinally, Olivia:\n\n- Olivia knows that she took cookies from the jar that was supposed to have chocolate chip cookies (but was labeled \"oatmeal raisin\" because of Nancy's swap) and replaced them with peanut butter cookies.\n\n- So, Olivia knows that the jar labeled \"oatmeal raisin\" now has peanut butter cookies.\n\n- The other jar, labeled \"chocolate chip,\" still has oatmeal raisin cookies, as far as Olivia knows.\n\n- Therefore, Olivia thinks that the jar labeled \"oatmeal raisin\" has peanut butter cookies, and the jar labeled \"chocolate chip\" has oatmeal raisin cookies.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Mary thinks:\n\n- Jar labeled \"oatmeal raisin\": oatmeal raisin cookies\n\n- Jar labeled \"chocolate chip\": chocolate chip cookies\n\n- Nancy thinks:\n\n- Jar labeled \"oatmeal raisin\": chocolate chip cookies\n\n- Jar labeled \"chocolate chip\": oatmeal raisin cookies\n\n- Olivia thinks:\n\n- Jar labeled \"oatmeal raisin\": peanut butter cookies\n\n- Jar labeled \"chocolate chip\": oatmeal raisin cookies\n\nBut in reality:\n\n- Jar labeled \"oatmeal raisin\": peanut butter cookies (formerly chocolate chip, swapped labels, then replaced by Olivia)\n\n- Jar labeled \"chocolate chip\": oatmeal raisin cookies\n\nSo, everyone has different ideas about what's in each jar, and only Olivia knows the true current contents.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\begin{array}{l|l|l}\n& \\text{Mary's Belief} & \\text{Nancy's Belief} & \\text{Olivia's Belief} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Jar labeled \"oatmeal raisin\"} & \\text{oatmeal raisin cookies} & \\text{chocolate chip cookies} & \\text{peanut butter cookies} \\\\\n\\text{Jar labeled \"chocolate chip\"} & \\text{chocolate chip cookies} & \\text{oatmeal raisin cookies} & \\text{oatmeal raisin cookies} \\\\\n\\end{array} } \\]"
