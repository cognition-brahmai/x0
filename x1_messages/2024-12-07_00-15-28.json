        "content": "Let's see. So, in this room, there are 4 dogs and 6 cats. Each dog has 3 times as many fleas as each cat. And it's given that one cat has 12 fleas. I need to find out how many fleas are in the room in total.\n\nFirst, since one cat has 12 fleas, and all cats are likely to have the same number of fleas (unless specified otherwise), I'll assume each cat has 12 fleas. So, for 6 cats, that would be 6 times 12, which is 72 fleas in total for the cats.\n\nNow, each dog has 3 times as many fleas as each cat. Since each cat has 12 fleas, each dog has 3 times 12, which is 36 fleas.\n\nThere are 4 dogs, so the total number of fleas on the dogs would be 4 times 36, which is 144 fleas.\n\nTo find the total number of fleas in the room, I need to add the fleas from the cats and the dogs together. So, 72 fleas from cats plus 144 fleas from dogs equals 216 fleas in total.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Let me double-check my assumptions. The problem says \"each dog has 3 times as many fleas as each cat.\" And it specifies that \"one cat has 12 fleas.\" Does this mean that all cats have 12 fleas, or just one cat has 12 fleas?\n\nHmm. The problem says \"one cat has 12 fleas,\" but it doesn't specify if the other cats have the same number of fleas or not. However, in such problems, it's usually assumed that all animals of the same type have the same number of fleas unless otherwise stated.\n\nSo, proceeding with that assumption, each cat has 12 fleas, and each dog has 3 times that, which is 36 fleas.\n\nNow, calculating the total:\n\nCats: 6 cats \u00d7 12 fleas/cat = 72 fleas\n\nDogs: 4 dogs \u00d7 36 fleas/dog = 144 fleas\n\nTotal fleas = 72 + 144 = 216 fleas.\n\nIs there another approach to this problem? Maybe I can think in terms of variables.\n\nLet's denote the number of fleas on one cat as c. So, c = 12.\n\nThen, the number of fleas on one dog is 3c = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36.\n\nTotal fleas on cats: 6c = 6 \u00d7 12 = 72\n\nTotal fleas on dogs: 4 \u00d7 3c = 4 \u00d7 36 = 144\n\nTotal fleas: 72 + 144 = 216\n\nAlternatively, I could express the total fleas in terms of c:\n\nTotal fleas = (number of cats \u00d7 c) + (number of dogs \u00d7 3c) = (6c) + (4 \u00d7 3c) = 6c + 12c = 18c\n\nGiven that c = 12, total fleas = 18 \u00d7 12 = 216\n\nThat's consistent with my previous calculation.\n\nIs there any possibility that the number of fleas varies between cats? The problem mentions \"one cat has 12 fleas,\" but doesn't specify about the others. Maybe I should consider that only one cat has 12 fleas, and the others have different amounts.\n\nBut that would make the problem too ambiguous and impossible to solve without additional information. So, it's reasonable to assume that all cats have the same number of fleas, which is 12.\n\nTherefore, the total number of fleas in the room is 216.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{216} \\]"
