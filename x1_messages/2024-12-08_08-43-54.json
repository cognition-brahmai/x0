        "content": "Yes, piranhas are primarily carnivorous fish that feed on meat, including other fish, insects, and even small mammals. While they are known for their aggressive behavior and sharp teeth, attacks on humans are rare and usually occur only when the fish feel threatened or are provoked. It's important to note that not all piranha species are equally aggressive, and some are kept as pets in aquariums."
