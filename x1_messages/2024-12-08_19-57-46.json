        "content": "Let's see. So, there's a class of 30 students who took a test, and their average score is 75%. Now, one more student takes the test and scores 90%, and we need to find the new average.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an average is. The average is the sum of all the scores divided by the number of scores. So, for the original 30 students, the average is 75%, which means that the total sum of their scores is 30 times 75%.\n\nLet me calculate that: 30 times 75 is 2250. So, the total sum of scores for the 30 students is 2250%.\n\nNow, one more student takes the test and scores 90%. So, the new total sum of scores would be 2250% plus 90%, which is 2340%.\n\nThe new number of students is 30 plus 1, which is 31.\n\nSo, the new average would be the new total sum divided by the new number of students, which is 2340% divided by 31.\n\nLet me do that division: 2340 divided by 31.\n\nHmm, 31 times 75 is 2325, because 31 times 70 is 2170, and 31 times 5 is 155, so 2170 plus 155 is 2325.\n\n2340 minus 2325 is 15, so the remainder is 15.\n\nSo, the new average is 75% plus 15/31%.\n\nBut 15 divided by 31 is approximately 0.4839, so that's about 0.4839%.\n\nSo, the new average is approximately 75.4839%.\n\nBut percents are usually expressed with one or two decimal places, so maybe I should round it to two decimal places.\n\nSo, 0.4839 rounded to two decimal places is 0.48.\n\nTherefore, the new average is approximately 75.48%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's check.\n\nThe original average was 75%, and we're adding a score that's higher than the average, which is 90%. So, the new average should be higher than 75%, which it is, 75.48%.\n\nBut, intuitively, since only one additional student is taking the test, and their score is higher, but not by a lot relative to the group, so the average should increase slightly, which it does.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of weighted averages.\n\nThe original 30 students have an average of 75%, and one student has 90%. So, the new average is a weighted average of these two.\n\nThe weight of the original students is 30, and the weight of the new student is 1.\n\nSo, the formula for the weighted average is (30 times 75% plus 1 times 90%) divided by (30 plus 1).\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier: (2250% plus 90%) divided by 31, which is 2340% divided by 31, which is approximately 75.48%.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of the difference from the original average.\n\nThe original average is 75%.\n\nThe new student's score is 90%, which is 15% above the original average.\n\nWhen we add this student, the new average should increase by some fraction of this 15%.\n\nSpecifically, since there are 31 students now, the increase in the average should be the difference divided by the new number of students.\n\nSo, increase = 15% / 31, which is approximately 0.4839%, just like before.\n\nSo, new average = original average + increase = 75% + 0.4839% = 75.4839%, or approximately 75.48%.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the concept of total sum of scores.\n\nTotal sum originally is 30 * 75% = 2250%.\n\nAdd the new student's score: 2250% + 90% = 2340%.\n\nNew average: 2340% / 31 \u2248 75.48%.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the new average is approximately 75.48%.\n\nBut to be precise, let's calculate 2340 divided by 31.\n\n31 * 75 = 2325.\n\n2340 - 2325 = 15.\n\nSo, 2340 / 31 = 75 + 15/31.\n\n15 divided by 31 is approximately 0.48387.\n\nSo, 75.48387%, which rounds to 75.48%.\n\nTherefore, the new average is 75.48%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75.48\\%} \\]"
