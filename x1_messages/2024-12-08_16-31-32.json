        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a car is traveling at an average speed of 45 miles per hour, and the trip lasts for 2 hours and 30 minutes. I need to find out how many miles the car travels during this time. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that distance, speed, and time are related by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nSo, if I have the speed and the time, I can find the distance by multiplying them together.\n\nThe speed is given as 45 miles per hour, which is great because it's already in miles per hour, and I want the distance in miles.\n\nNow, the time is 2 hours and 30 minutes. Hmm, I need to make sure that the units for time match the units in the speed. Since the speed is in miles per hour, I should convert the time into hours.\n\nLet's see, 30 minutes is half an hour, so 2 hours and 30 minutes is the same as 2.5 hours.\n\nSo, time = 2.5 hours.\n\nNow, plugging into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 45 \\, \\text{miles per hour} \\times 2.5 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n45 multiplied by 2 is 90, and 45 multiplied by 0.5 is 22.5. So, 90 plus 22.5 is 112.5.\n\nTherefore, the distance is 112.5 miles.\n\nWait a minute, but distances are often expressed in whole numbers. Maybe I should check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the time entirely into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 30 minutes, which totals 150 minutes.\n\nBut if I do that, I need to convert the speed into miles per minute.\n\nLet's see, 45 miles per hour is equal to 45 miles per 60 minutes, which is 0.75 miles per minute.\n\nThen, distance would be 0.75 miles per minute times 150 minutes, which is also 112.5 miles.\n\nOkay, so I get the same result either way.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the fact that 2 hours and 30 minutes is 2.5 hours, and multiply that by the speed of 45 miles per hour, which again gives me 112.5 miles.\n\nIt seems consistent.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like acceleration or something. The problem says \"average speed,\" so I think it's fine to use the formula directly.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are correct. Speed is in miles per hour, time is in hours, so their product should indeed be in miles.\n\nAlright, I think 112.5 miles is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{112.5} \\]"
