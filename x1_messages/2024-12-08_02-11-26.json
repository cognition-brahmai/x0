        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Java program that interacts with Apache Cassandra to handle time-series data. I need to make sure it can insert new data points, query data based on time ranges, and perform some basic aggregations like average, min, and max. Since I'm not too familiar with Cassandra, I'll need to do a bit of research to get this right.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up a Cassandra database and create the necessary tables to store time-series data. Time-series data typically involves timestamps and some measured values, so I should design the table schema accordingly to optimize for time-range queries.\n\nI recall that Cassandra is a column-family NoSQL database, which means it's great for handling large amounts of data and performing fast reads and writes, especially when data is accessed via primary keys. For time-series data, it's common to use the timestamp as part of the primary key to enable efficient range queries.\n\nLet me think about the data model. Suppose I'm storing sensor data, where each data point has a timestamp and a value. I might have multiple sensors, so I should also include a sensor ID in the data model.\n\nMaybe I can create a table like this:\n\n```\n\nCREATE TABLE sensor_data (\n\n    sensor_id text,\n\n    timestamp timestamp,\n\n    value double,\n\n    PRIMARY KEY (sensor_id, timestamp)\n\n);\n\n```\n\nThis way, data is partitioned by sensor_id, and within each partition, data is ordered by timestamp. This should allow me to efficiently query data for a specific sensor within a certain time range.\n\nBut wait, if I have a large number of sensors and a high frequency of data points, I might run into performance issues with Cassandra, because Cassandra has limits on the number of rows and the size of partitions. To handle larger datasets, I might need to introduce additional components to the primary key, like a date part.\n\nPerhaps I can cluster the data by day or hour, something like that. For example, I could include the year and month as part of the partition key, and the day and timestamp as clustering columns.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```\n\nCREATE TABLE sensor_data (\n\n    sensor_id text,\n\n    year int,\n\n    month int,\n\n    day int,\n\n    timestamp timestamp,\n\n    value double,\n\n    PRIMARY KEY ((sensor_id, year, month), day, timestamp)\n\n);\n\n```\n\nThis way, data is partitioned by sensor_id, year, and month, and within each partition, it's clustered by day and then by timestamp. This should help distribute the data more evenly and avoid hotspots.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my queries can handle this schema. For example, if I want to query data for a specific sensor between two timestamps that span multiple months, I need to handle that in my application code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use Apache Cassandra's built-in support for time-based data through the use of TimeUUIDs, but I think using timestamps directly is more straightforward for this purpose.\n\nOkay, assuming I go with the second schema, I need to make sure that when inserting data, I correctly populate the year, month, and day fields based on the timestamp.\n\nIn Java, I can use the java.time package to manipulate dates and times. For example, I can extract the year, month, and day from a LocalDateTime object.\n\nNow, moving on to the Java program. I need to set up a connection to the Cassandra database using the DataStax Java driver.\n\nFirst, I need to add the dependency to my project. If I'm using Maven, I can add the following to my pom.xml:\n\n```\n\n<dependency>\n\n    <groupId>com.datastax.oss</groupId>\n\n    <artifactId>java-driver-core</artifactId>\n\n    <version>4.13.0</version>\n\n</dependency>\n\n```\n\nThen, I need to create a Cluster object and a Session object to interact with the database.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```\n\nCluster cluster = Cluster.build()\n\n    .addContactPoints(\"127.0.0.1\")\n\n    .withPort(9042)\n\n    .build();\n\nSession session = cluster.connect(\"mykeyspace\");\n\n```\n\nAssuming that Cassandra is running locally on the default port and that I have a keyspace named \"mykeyspace\" already created.\n\nNext, I need to create the sensor_data table as per the schema I designed earlier.\n\nI can execute the CREATE TABLE statement using the session:\n\n```\n\nsession.execute(\"CREATE TABLE sensor_data (sensor_id text, year int, month int, day int, timestamp timestamp, value double, PRIMARY KEY ((sensor_id, year, month), day, timestamp))\");\n\n```\n\nBut in a real-world scenario, I would probably have the schema created beforehand, and just connect to it in the program.\n\nNow, for inserting new data points, I need a function that takes the sensor_id, timestamp, and value, extracts the year, month, and day from the timestamp, and inserts them into the table.\n\nIn Java, I can do something like:\n\n```\n\npublic void insertDataPoint(String sensorId, LocalDateTime timestamp, double value) {\n\n    int year = timestamp.getYear();\n\n    int month = timestamp.getMonthValue();\n\n    int day = timestamp.getDayOfMonth();\n\n    SimpleStatement statement = new SimpleStatement(\n\n        \"INSERT INTO sensor_data (sensor_id, year, month, day, timestamp, value) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\",\n\n        sensorId, year, month, day, timestamp.toInstant(ZoneOffset.UTC), value\n\n    );\n\n    session.execute(statement);\n\n}\n\n```\n\nNote that I'm converting the LocalDateTime to an Instant using UTC, because Cassandra expects timestamps in UTC.\n\nFor querying data based on time ranges, I need a function that takes the sensor_id, start timestamp, and end timestamp, and retrieves the data points within that range.\n\nGiven my schema, I need to consider that the partitions are divided by year and month, so I need to query the appropriate partitions based on the start and end timestamps.\n\nThis could be a bit tricky. One way is to calculate the range of years and months covered by the time range, and for each partition, query the data within the day and timestamp clustering columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use token queries or allow filtering, but that's not efficient for large datasets.\n\nWait, allowing filtering is generally bad for performance in Cassandra, so I should avoid that.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to query based on the partition key (sensor_id, year, month), and then apply the timestamp range within each partition.\n\nIn Java, I can do something like:\n\n```\n\npublic List<DataPoint> queryData(String sensorId, LocalDateTime startTime, LocalDateTime endTime) {\n\n    List<DataPoint> results = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    int startYear = startTime.getYear();\n\n    int startMonth = startTime.getMonthValue();\n\n    int endYear = endTime.getYear();\n\n    int endMonth = endTime.getMonthValue();\n\n    for (int year = startYear; year <= endYear; year++) {\n\n        int monthStart = (year == startYear) ? startMonth : 1;\n\n        int monthEnd = (year == endYear) ? endMonth : 12;\n\n        for (int month = monthStart; month <= monthEnd; month++) {\n\n            // Query the partition for this sensor_id, year, month\n\n            Select.Where select = QueryBuilder.selectFrom(\"sensor_data\")\n\n                .where(QueryBuilder.eq(\"sensor_id\", sensorId))\n\n                .and(QueryBuilder.eq(\"year\", year))\n\n                .and(QueryBuilder.eq(\"month\", month));\n\n            // Add timestamp range condition\n\n            select.and(QueryBuilder.gte(\"timestamp\", startTime))\n\n                  .and(QueryBuilder.lte(\"timestamp\", endTime));\n\n            ResultSet rs = session.execute(select.toString());\n\n            for (Row row : rs) {\n\n                int day = row.getInt(\"day\");\n\n                LocalDateTime ts = row.getTimestamp(\"timestamp\").toLocalDateTime();\n\n                double val = row.getDouble(\"value\");\n\n                results.add(new DataPoint(day, ts, val));\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return results;\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the relevant year and month partitions based on the start and end timestamps, queries each partition, and collects the results.\n\nI need to make sure that the DataPoint class is defined to hold the day, timestamp, and value.\n\nNow, for performing aggregations like average, min, and max, Cassandra provides built-in functions for aggregation.\n\nSo, I can modify the query to include these aggregations.\n\nFor example, to calculate the average value within a time range:\n\n```\n\npublic double calculateAverage(String sensorId, LocalDateTime startTime, LocalDateTime endTime) {\n\n    // Similar loop as above to query relevant partitions\n\n    // For each partition, select avg(value) where timestamp between startTime and endTime\n\n    // Collect the average values and compute the overall average\n\n}\n\n```\n\nBut Cassandra doesn't support cross-partition queries, so I need to handle aggregations at the application level if the time range spans multiple partitions.\n\nAlternatively, I can use Cassandra's built-in aggregation within each partition and then average the results in the application.\n\nThis might not be perfectly accurate, but it's a common approach for time-series data in Cassandra.\n\nSo, in the queryData function, I can modify the SELECT statement to include AVG(value), MIN(value), and MAX(value), and then aggregate the results accordingly.\n\nWait, but Cassandra's aggregation functions work within a single partition unless you use ALLOW FILTERING, which is not recommended for performance reasons.\n\nTherefore, I need to collect the data points in the application and perform the aggregations there.\n\nThis might not be efficient for large datasets, but given Cassandra's limitations, it's a\u53ef\u884c approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can look into using Apache Spark with Cassandra to perform distributed aggregations, but that might be overkill for this scenario.\n\nAssuming I'm sticking with a Java application, I'll proceed with performing aggregations in memory.\n\nSo, in the queryData function, I collect all the data points into a list, and then I can iterate over the list to calculate the average, min, and max values.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n\npublic AggregationResult aggregateData(String sensorId, LocalDateTime startTime, LocalDateTime endTime) {\n\n    List<DataPoint> dataPoints = queryData(sensorId, startTime, endTime);\n\n    if (dataPoints.isEmpty()) {\n\n        return new AggregationResult(0.0, Double.MAX_VALUE, Double.MIN_VALUE);\n\n    }\n\n    double sum = 0.0;\n\n    double min = dataPoints.get(0).getValue();\n\n    double max = dataPoints.get(0).getValue();\n\n    for (DataPoint dp : dataPoints) {\n\n        double val = dp.getValue();\n\n        sum += val;\n\n        if (val < min) {\n\n            min = val;\n\n        }\n\n        if (val > max) {\n\n            max = val;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    double average = sum / dataPoints.size();\n\n    return new AggregationResult(average, min, max);\n\n}\n\n```\n\nHere, AggregationResult is a simple class to hold the average, min, and max values.\n\nThis should suffice for the requirements.\n\nI should also consider performance optimizations, such as fetching data in parallel for different partitions, but that might complicate the code.\n\nFor now, I'll keep it simple and fetch data sequentially.\n\nAnother consideration is handling large result sets. If the time range is big, the list of data points might become too large to fit in memory. To handle this, I can process the data points in batches or stream the results instead of loading everything into memory at once.\n\nBut for the sake of this example, I'll assume the data sets are manageable.\n\nI should also make sure to close the Cassandra connections properly when the program exits to free up resources.\n\nIn summary, the Java program will consist of:\n\n- Setting up a connection to the Cassandra database using the DataStax Java driver.\n\n- Creating a table for storing time-series data with an appropriate schema that includes sensor_id, year, month, day, timestamp, and value.\n\n- Implementing a function to insert new data points into the table, extracting year, month, and day from the timestamp.\n\n- Implementing a function to query data based on a time range, iterating over relevant partitions and collecting data points that fall within the specified timestamps.\n\n- Implementing a function to perform basic aggregations (average, min, max) on the retrieved data points.\n\nI need to ensure that the program handles different time zones correctly, perhaps by standardizing on UTC for all timestamp operations.\n\nAlso, I should handle any exceptions that may occur during database operations, such as connection errors or query failures.\n\nThis seems like a solid plan. Now, I'll proceed to implement the code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Java program that uses the Apache Cassandra NoSQL database to store and retrieve time-series data, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. **Apache Cassandra** installed and running.\n2. **DataStax Java Driver for Apache Cassandra** added to your project dependencies.\n\nFor Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>com.datastax.oss</groupId>\n    <artifactId>java-driver-core</artifactId>\n    <version>4.13.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.CqlSession;\nimport com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.cql.SimpleStatement;\nimport java.time.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\nclass DataPoint {\n    int day;\n    LocalDateTime timestamp;\n    double value;\n\n    DataPoint(int day, LocalDateTime timestamp, double value) {\n        this.day = day;\n        this.timestamp = timestamp;\n        this.value = value;\n    }\n\n    double getValue() {\n        return value;\n    }\n}\n\nclass AggregationResult {\n    double average;\n    double min;\n    double max;\n\n    AggregationResult(double average, double min, double max) {\n        this.average = average;\n        this.min = min;\n        this.max = max;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class CassandraTimeSeries {\n\n    private CqlSession session;\n\n    public CassandraTimeSeries(String contactPoint, int port, String keyspace) {\n        this.session = CqlSession.builder()\n                .addContactPoint(contactPoint)\n                .withPort(port)\n                .withKeyspace(keyspace)\n                .build();\n    }\n\n    public void close() {\n        if (session != null) {\n            session.close();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void createTable() {\n        String query = \"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sensor_data (\" +\n                \"sensor_id text,\" +\n                \"year int,\" +\n                \"month int,\" +\n                \"day int,\" +\n                \"timestamp timestamp,\" +\n                \"value double,\" +\n                \"PRIMARY KEY ((sensor_id, year, month), day, timestamp)\" +\n                \")\";\n        session.execute(query);\n    }\n\n    public void insertDataPoint(String sensorId, LocalDateTime timestamp, double value) {\n        int year = timestamp.getYear();\n        int month = timestamp.getMonthValue();\n        int day = timestamp.getDayOfMonth();\n        Instant instant = timestamp.toInstant(ZoneOffset.UTC);\n        String query = String.format(\n                \"INSERT INTO sensor_data (sensor_id, year, month, day, timestamp, value) VALUES ('%s', %d, %d, %d, '%s', %f)\",\n                sensorId, year, month, day, instant.toString(), value\n        );\n        session.execute(query);\n    }\n\n    public List<DataPoint> queryData(String sensorId, LocalDateTime startTime, LocalDateTime endTime) {\n        List<DataPoint> results = new ArrayList<>();\n        int startYear = startTime.getYear();\n        int startMonth = startTime.getMonthValue();\n        int endYear = endTime.getYear();\n        int endMonth = endTime.getMonthValue();\n\n        for (int year = startYear; year <= endYear; year++) {\n            int monthStart = (year == startYear) ?
