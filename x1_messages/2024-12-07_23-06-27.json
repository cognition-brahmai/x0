        "content": "So I've got this problem here about building a fence around a rectangular garden. The garden is 20 meters long and 15 meters wide, and I need to put up fence posts every 2 meters around the entire perimeter. I need to figure out how many posts I'll need in total.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate the perimeter of the garden because that's the total distance around it where I'll be putting the fence posts. For a rectangle, the perimeter P is given by the formula:\n\nP = 2 * (length + width)\n\nSo plugging in the values:\n\nP = 2 * (20m + 15m) = 2 * 35m = 70 meters\n\nAlright, so the perimeter is 70 meters. Now, if I'm placing posts every 2 meters, I might think that I can just divide the perimeter by the interval between posts to find out how many posts I need. So:\n\nNumber of posts = Perimeter / Interval = 70m / 2m = 35 posts\n\nWait a minute, but in reality, when you're putting up fence posts around a closed shape like a rectangle, the number of posts is equal to the number of intervals between them because the first and last post will be the same, closing the loop.\n\nLet me think about that again. If I have a straight line, say 10 meters long, and I put a post every 2 meters, I'd have posts at 0m, 2m, 4m, 6m, 8m, and 10m, which is 6 posts for a 10-meter length with posts every 2 meters. So, in general, for a straight line, number of posts = (length / interval) + 1\n\nBut in a closed loop like a rectangle, the first and last post are the same, so you don't double-count that post. So, number of posts = perimeter / interval\n\nIn this case, 70m / 2m = 35 posts.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have a smaller rectangle, say 4m by 3m, so perimeter is 2*(4+3)=14m. If I place posts every 1m, according to the formula, it should be 14 posts.\n\nLet me try to visualize that:\n\nStarting at one corner, place a post at 0m.\n\nThen at 1m, 2m, 3m, 4m along the first side.\n\nAt 4m, I reach the next corner.\n\nNow, continue along the next side: 5m, 6m, 7m, 8m, 9m, 10m, but wait, the second side is 3m long, so from 4m to 7m.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of intervals.\n\nFor a perimeter of 14m with posts every 1m, there should be 14 intervals, which would require 14 posts to close the loop.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, 70m perimeter with posts every 2m should have 35 intervals, thus 35 posts.\n\nBut let's confirm this by considering the number of posts on each side.\n\nFor the longer sides (20m each), number of posts per long side = 20m / 2m = 10 posts per side.\n\nFor the shorter sides (15m each), number of posts per short side = 15m / 2m.\n\nWait, 15 divided by 2 is 7.5. Hmm, that can't be right because you can't have half a post. So, perhaps I need to consider how to handle partial intervals.\n\nLet me recalculate.\n\nFor the long sides: 20m / 2m = 10 posts per side.\n\nFor the short sides: 15m / 2m = 7.5 posts per side.\n\nHmm, that doesn't make sense because you can't have half a post. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of intervals per side and then add one post per interval, but making sure not to double-count the corner posts.\n\nSo, for the long sides:\n\nNumber of intervals = length / interval = 20m / 2m = 10 intervals.\n\nTherefore, number of posts per long side = 10 + 1 = 11 posts.\n\nWait, no. In a straight line, number of posts = number of intervals + 1.\n\nBut in a closed loop, the corner posts are shared between two sides.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to calculate the total number of intervals around the perimeter and then the number of posts will be equal to the number of intervals, since the first and last post coincide.\n\nIn this case, perimeter is 70m, interval is 2m, so number of intervals = 70 / 2 = 35.\n\nTherefore, number of posts = 35.\n\nBut let's check with the smaller example again.\n\nSmaller rectangle: 4m by 3m, perimeter 14m, posts every 1m.\n\nNumber of intervals = 14 / 1 = 14.\n\nNumber of posts = 14.\n\nBut if I think about it, in reality, you'd have a post at each corner and along the sides, totaling 14 posts.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, 35 posts should be sufficient.\n\nWait, but earlier I was confused about the short sides having a fractional number of posts. Maybe I need to consider how the posts align at the corners.\n\nLet me try to calculate the number of posts on each side, considering that corners are shared.\n\nFor the long sides:\n\nEach long side is 20m, intervals of 2m.\n\nNumber of intervals per long side = 20 / 2 = 10.\n\nTherefore, number of posts per long side = 10 + 1 = 11.\n\nBut since the corners are shared between two sides, we need to subtract the corner posts that are already counted in the adjacent side.\n\nSo, total posts for two long sides = 2 * 11 - 2 (for the two shared corners) = 20 posts.\n\nSimilarly, for the short sides:\n\nEach short side is 15m, intervals of 2m.\n\nNumber of intervals per short side = 15 / 2 = 7.5.\n\nBut since we can't have half intervals, we need to decide how to handle this.\n\nPerhaps, we need to place posts at every 2 meters, starting from a corner, and see how many fit into 15 meters.\n\nStarting at 0m (corner post), then 2m, 4m, 6m, 8m, 10m, 12m, 14m, and then 15m.\n\nWait, that's 0m, 2m, 4m, 6m, 8m, 10m, 12m, 14m, 15m. That's 8 posts per short side.\n\nWait, but 15m divided by 2m is 7.5, but we have 8 posts.\n\nWait, number of posts = number of intervals + 1.\n\nFor a 15m side with 2m intervals, number of intervals = 15 / 2 = 7.5, but since we can't have half intervals, we need to consider that the last interval might be shorter.\n\nIn this case, if we place 8 posts, the intervals would be 2m between each, except possibly the last one, which would be 1m (from 14m to 15m).\n\nBut perhaps for the purpose of this calculation, we can assume that the posts are placed at integer multiples of 2m from the starting point, and see where that leads us.\n\nSo, for the short side:\n\nPosts at 0m, 2m, 4m, 6m, 8m, 10m, 12m, 14m, 15m.\n\nThat's 9 posts per short side.\n\nWait, no, 0m, 2m, 4m, 6m, 8m, 10m, 12m, 14m, 15m. That's 8 posts.\n\nWait, no, 0m to 15m with intervals of 2m:\n\n0m, 2m, 4m, 6m, 8m, 10m, 12m, 14m, 15m.\n\nThat's 9 posts.\n\nWait, no, that's 8 intervals (each 2m) plus the starting post, totaling 9 posts.\n\nBut 8 * 2m = 16m, which is more than 15m.\n\nWait, there must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's list them out:\n\nPost 1: 0m\n\nPost 2: 2m\n\nPost 3: 4m\n\nPost 4: 6m\n\nPost 5: 8m\n\nPost 6: 10m\n\nPost 7: 12m\n\nPost 8: 14m\n\nPost 9: 15m\n\nWait, from post 8 to post 9, that's only 1m, not 2m.\n\nSo, the interval between post 8 and post 9 is 1m, while the other intervals are 2m.\n\nThis could be a problem because the intervals aren't uniform.\n\nBut in the original problem, it says \"posts every 2 meters.\" Does that allow for a shorter interval at the end?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to adjust the placement so that all intervals are exactly 2 meters, even if the last interval doesn't reach exactly to the corner.\n\nFor example, on the short side of 15m, if I place posts every 2m starting from 0m, I'd have:\n\nPost 1: 0m\n\nPost 2: 2m\n\nPost 3: 4m\n\nPost 4: 6m\n\nPost 5: 8m\n\nPost 6: 10m\n\nPost 7: 12m\n\nPost 8: 14m\n\nAnd then the next post would be at 16m, but since the side is only 15m, that's beyond the end.\n\nSo, in this case, the last post on the short side would be at 14m, and the next post would be at the corner, which is 1m away.\n\nBut then the interval between the last post on the short side and the corner post is only 1m, which might not be ideal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to adjust the starting point so that the posts align properly at the corners.\n\nLet's consider that the corners require posts, and the intervals between posts should be as close to 2m as possible.\n\nSo, if I have to place posts at each corner, and then every 2m along the sides, I need to account for the corners and the intervals in between.\n\nThis might get complicated, so maybe I should stick with the initial approach of calculating the perimeter and dividing by the interval.\n\nPerimeter is 70m, interval is 2m, so number of posts is 70 / 2 = 35 posts.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I'm still a bit uneasy about the short sides not dividing evenly by 2m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of posts per side, considering the corners, and then sum them up.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nLong sides:\n\nEach long side is 20m, intervals of 2m.\n\nNumber of intervals per long side = 20 / 2 = 10.\n\nNumber of posts per long side = 10 + 1 = 11.\n\nBut since the two long sides share the corner posts, total posts for long sides = 2 * 11 - 2 = 20 posts.\n\nShort sides:\n\nEach short side is 15m, intervals of 2m.\n\nNumber of intervals per short side = 15 / 2 = 7.5.\n\nSince we can't have half intervals, we need to decide how to handle this.\n\nOption 1: Place 8 posts on each short side, which would cover 14m, with the last post at 14m, and the corner post at 15m.\n\nBut then the interval between the last post and the corner post is only 1m, which might not be desirable.\n\nOption 2: Place 7 posts on each short side, covering 12m, with the last post at 14m, and the corner post at 15m.\n\nBut then there's a 1m section without a post, which might not be acceptable.\n\nOption 3: Adjust the intervals slightly to make them fit evenly.\n\nBut that might complicate things further.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to accept that on the short sides, there will be a 1m interval at the end, and proceed with 8 posts per short side.\n\nSo, total posts for short sides = 2 * 8 - 2 = 14 posts.\n\nThen, total posts for the entire rectangle = posts for long sides + posts for short sides = 20 + 14 = 34 posts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 35 posts.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a discrepancy in how I'm counting the corner posts.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nImagine unfolding the rectangle into a straight line.\n\nThe total perimeter is 70m, and posts are every 2m.\n\nSo, number of intervals = 70 / 2 = 35.\n\nSince it's a closed loop, the number of posts equals the number of intervals, which is 35.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the first post is at 0m and the last post is at 70m, but since it's a loop, post at 70m coincides with the post at 0m, so total posts are still 35.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of posts needed is 35.\n\nI think the confusion earlier arose from trying to calculate posts per side and then combining them, which can lead to overcounting or undercounting the corner posts.\n\nSo, the simplest and most accurate way is to divide the perimeter by the interval, which gives the number of posts directly for a closed loop.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 35 fence posts are needed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{35} \\]"
