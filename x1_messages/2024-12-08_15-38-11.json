        "content": "Let's see. If a car is going at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, and we want to know how far it travels in 45 minutes, we need to figure out how to use the speed and time to find the distance.\n\nI remember that speed is related to distance and time by the formula:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nSo, if we rearrange that, Distance = Speed * Time\n\nBut here, the speed is given in miles per hour, and the time is in minutes. We need to make sure that the units match. Since the speed is in miles per hour, it would be best to convert the time from minutes to hours.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 45 minutes is 45/60 hours.\n\n45 divided by 60 is 0.75 hours.\n\nSo, time = 0.75 hours\n\nNow, plug into the formula:\n\nDistance = 60 miles per hour * 0.75 hours\n\nMultiplying that gives:\n\nDistance = 45 miles\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to think about this?\n\nAlternatively, since 60 miles per hour means the car travels 60 miles in one hour, in half an hour it would travel 30 miles, and in quarter of an hour, it would travel 15 miles.\n\n45 minutes is three-quarters of an hour, so:\n\n30 miles (for half an hour) plus 15 miles (for quarter an hour) equals 45 miles.\n\nThat matches the earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way could be to use proportions. If 60 miles correspond to 60 minutes, then how many miles correspond to 45 minutes?\n\nSet up a proportion:\n\n60 miles / 60 minutes = x miles / 45 minutes\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n60 * 45 = 60 * x\n\n2700 = 60x\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 2700 / 60\n\nx = 45 miles\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I keep getting 45 miles as the distance traveled in 45 minutes at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45 \\text{ miles}} \\]"
