        "content": "So there are 6 red balls and 4 blue balls in a box, making a total of 10 balls. You pick one ball, look at its color, put it back in the box, and then pick another ball. You want to know the probability of picking a red ball first and then a blue ball.\n\nFirst, since you're putting the ball back each time, each pick is independent. That means the outcome of the first pick doesn't affect the second pick.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball on the first try is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. So that's 6 red balls out of 10 total balls, which is 6/10 or 0.6.\n\nNext, the probability of picking a blue ball on the second try is the number of blue balls divided by the total number of balls. That's 4 blue balls out of 10 total balls, which is 4/10 or 0.4.\n\nSince these two events are independent, the probability of both events happening in sequence is the product of their individual probabilities. So, you multiply the probability of picking a red ball first by the probability of picking a blue ball second.\n\nThat would be 0.6 multiplied by 0.4, which equals 0.24.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red ball followed by a blue ball is 0.24, or 24%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.24} \\]"
