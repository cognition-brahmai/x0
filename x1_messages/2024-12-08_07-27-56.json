NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA) MINORITY LEADER: Radical Tea Party Republicans who are holding up this tax cut for the American people. ALINA CHO, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Just when you thought they came together on something, House Republicans take a popular tax cut and say, never mind. ALI VELSHI, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): A dear leader on display. Images of Kim Jong Il's body in a glass coffin. The U.S. trying to figure out whether North Korea will be more dangerous and unstable without him. CHO: Heavy snow, strong winds, and dangerous ice. The fierce snowstorm rips through the west and Midwest. So, is more snow on the way? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Medicaid is the one who holds my child's life in their hands right now. VELSHI: Taking on the system. One mother's fight to get her baby the medical care he desperately needs on this AMERICAN MORNING. CHO: Good morning. It's Tuesday, December 20th. Welcome to AMERICAN MORNING. I'm Alina Cho along with Ali Velshi. So glad you're with us. VELSHI: Good morning. If you were hoping to wake up with an extra $1,000 in your pocket for next year, forget about it. House Republicans are now set to block a two-month extension of the payroll tax holiday. A vote is now scheduled for today after lawmakers scrapped one in the middle of the night. But House Speaker John Boehner expects the bill to fail, saying his members are against kicking the can down the road. Minority Leader Pelosi blames some rogue Republicans for getting in the way. Here's both sides. REP. JOHN BOEHNER, (R) HOUSE SPEAKER: Our members do not want to just punt and do a two-month short-term fix where we have to come back and do this again. We're here. We're willing to work. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: It's just a radical, Tea Party Republicans who are holding up this tax cut for the American people, and jeopardizing our economic growth. VELSHI: Here's what the in-fighting could cost you when you start getting the holiday bills. If Congress can't reach a deal Americans earning $50,000 a year would be hit with a $1,000 tax hike in 2012. Joining us now from Capitol Hill is Congressman Jeb Hensarling of Texas. He is the chairman of the House Republican Congress. Congressman Hensarling, thanks for being with us. REP. JEB HENSARLING, (R) TEXAS: Good morning. VELSHI: Talk to me about what's going on here. It seems like a lot of process. Americans would like to see the payroll tax cut go through. Let's get the ideology out of the way for a second. Are you in favor of or against the payroll tax cut being extended? HENSARLING: Oh, absolutely. Here's where the debate is today. Unfortunately, since the president has been elected, the president has been at, near or above nine percent. So we have to help struggling American families. So, by and large, everyone in Congress agreed we need to extend this temporary payroll tax holiday. Here's where the debate is. The Senate wants to punt the ball. They want to do a 60-day extension. House Republicans frankly, this is one of the few times we agree with the president. We want to extend it for a full year. That's what the American people asked for. It's what the president agreed to. So number one, that's the first point. Here's the second point. House Republicans stand ready to work over the holidays, like many other Americans have to do, to get this done. So today we will appoint conferees, a conference committee, which since the dawn of the Republic is how you work out differences between the house and the Senate. But so far, leader, Democrat leader Pelosi, Democrat Senate leader Reid said they won't do it. They won't negotiate. Our way or the highway. Here's the last point. Washington didn't consult with the real world. Every single business group says a two-month extension is totally unworkable. It will do more harm than good. The associated builders and contractors, the roofers, the people that actually do the payroll say, you can't give people this little notice and get it done. That's why we need to do the year-long extension. VELSHI: I would love that we didn't have people working on these ongoing extensions to the debt ceiling and to the budget. It's kind of in the eyes of most Americans ridiculous the way business is going on in Congress these days. We operate on the basis of 11th hour decisions or 13-hour decisions. The bottom line is -- HENSARLING: Isn't that the point? Shouldn't the Democrats come back to negotiate in good faith? VELSHI: Is a two-month extension not better than no extension? HENSARLING: We talk to the people who actually have to do this. People need to get outside of the beltway small businesses who are actually responsible for this saying it's totally unworkable. It's Washington not listening to the people who actually create the jobs. They say you can't do all of these software changes overnight that are only two months. Number one, they're not listening. Listen, the last time we had a disagreement and, listen, nobody likes brinksmanship, but we went to conference. We came up way bill to fund the government for the rest of the year and not have a shutdown. The question is, why won't Democrats come and negotiate in good faith? VELSHI: Let me tell you, you've got Scott Brown, senator, Republican Senator from Massachusetts. You've got another senator from Indiana, Dean Heller from Nevada, all speaking out against the position that house Republicans are taking. They're saying, Scott Brown says, the effort to not do this is irresponsible and wrong. You do have people in the Republican party. Why is there this break in the Republican Party? Who is pushing -- HENSARLING: Well, I would say we have some Democrats who supported our positions. There's a handful of people on both sides. Again it comes down to this -- do you want a 60-day extension that is unworkable, according to the people who have to administer it, which, by the way, contrary to what your lead-in says it not $1,000. It's 60 days, about $160. VELSHI: I Senate $1,000 over the course of a year. It's about $90 a month. I do get my numbers right. HENSARLING: OK, well, then, congratulations. But, again, here's the problem. Again, do you -- it really comes down to this. Do you want to do a 60-day ex-attention or one-year extension? Are you willing to work on the holidays to get it done or not? VELSHI: Gosh, I'd like to know what we're going the next five years? I love it if we weren't working on one-year cycles. What happens now? What's going to happen in your mind? How does this play out? HENSARLING: Again, the House will appoint people to, something known as a conference committee, which, again, since the dawn of the republic is how we work out differences. The question is, will Democrats show up to negotiate this good faith? I hope they do. This could be worked out in a couple of days. We could do what the president asked us to do. Again, the question, are you going to do it for a full year or punt the ball down the road like Washington does? So are you going to give America something -- VELSHI: You've articulated the issue very well. I guess my question is, you are a member of the leadership. Do we think that we will go into 2012 with a two-month extension or a one-year extension or is there a chance there will be no extension of this payroll cut? HENSARLING: Well, I hope that the Democrats will come to their senses and be reasonable and negotiate in good faith. I hope this gets done. Again, I'm sorry we're in the economy that we're in. I'm sorry that the president's policies haven't worked, but almost everyone in Congress has agreed we need to do this, but the debate is, are you going to do it for the full year or are you going to punt the ball down the road? And work over the holidays or are you not? VELSHI: If you can't get a one-year extension on the payroll tax holiday, will you and your colleagues vote against extending this for two months? There's some chance Americans may not get this payroll extension because want to stand on principle of it being a year? HENSARLING: It's not just a matter of principle. It's a matter of practicality. I encourage you to talk to the businesses who are in charge of administering this saying it will do more harm than good. We're not going to vote for something that's going to do more harm than good for the economy. We don't understand -- why Democrats won't -- VELSHI: Congressman, I bet you there's a -- HENSARLING: -- they wanted a one-year extension in the first place. VELSHI: It's 2011. Probably a BlackBerry in your pocket, like I have, some kind of device. It's not going to mess up the system we have a two-month extension. The computers, the software can handle it. HENSARLING: You ought to talk to the people who are in charge of administers thinking. With this amount of notice, what it did do with their software impose more costs -- VELSHI: The software is the problem? We can't -- HENSARLING: Right now, I've laid out three different issues. If the president says you ought to do 12 months, Nancy Pelosi said this, we don't understand why you don't do 12 months? Why punt the ball down the field? That's the first question. I mean, you know good and well that the president for months and months and months have said we have to do it for a full year. Now all of a sudden we've got a 60-day bill. I do not understand. Second of all, again, most Americans are going to have to work for the next couple of weeks. Why can't we get together, Democrats and Republicans, and negotiate this out? We ought to be able to do it in a couple of days and give the American people what they want and what they deserve. VELSHI: We hope that is the case, Representative Jeb Hensarling. Thank you for being with us. It's a tough issue. I appreciate you going back and forth with me on it. Repsentative Jeb Hensarling is the chairman of the House Republican conference. CHO: The U.S. keeping an eye out for advancing troops and other threatening moves after the death of a dictator in North Korea. North Korean media showed images of Kim Jong-il's body laid out in a glass coffin in a mausoleum in Pyongyang, his third son and successor Kim Jong-un paying respects. Anna Coren is live in Seoul, South Korea for us, this morning. Anna, obviously no love lost between North and South Korea. What is the mood there in Seoul about this? ANNA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Alina, I have to say there is a great deal of uncertainty. People just do not know what the future holds with Kim Jong-un now at the helm. He is young. He is very inexperienced. But in an interesting act today, something that caught many people by surprise, South Korea offered its -- expressed, I should say, it's sympathies to the North Korean people. The reason this struck many people as a surprise is because the South Korean government has had quite a rocky relationship with its neighbors to the north. Under president Lee Myung-bak it has been almost non-exist. Obviously, those attacks last year in 2010 on the South Korean warship which claims the lives of 46 sailors and the shelling of the South Korean island it really left relations at rock bottom. So for South Korea to express its sympathies to, really, reach out to its northern neighbors, it really is seen as thawing relations, Alina. CHO: Anna Coren live for us in Seoul, thank you very much. VELSHI: A massive snowstorm slams the west and Midwest. Take a look, the storm unleashing heavy snow and fierce winds, frigid temperatures turning roads into sheets of ice, blizzard warnings stretching from New Mexico to Kansas this morning. Driving conditions so dangerous, several major roads like Interstate 40 in New Mexico, are closed. VELSHI: Still to come this morning, GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul surges in the polls, but can he win in Iowa? We're going to talk to him in about 50 minutes. CHO: Plus, North Korea's military might. Just how worried should the world be? VELSHI: And an Indiana mother takes on Medicaid in a battle to fly her four-month-old baby halfway across the country to get the surgery he desperately needs to save his life.
