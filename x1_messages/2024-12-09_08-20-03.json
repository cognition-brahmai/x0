        "content": "So there are 50 students in the class, and 40% of them wear glasses. I need to find out how many students do not wear glasses. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many students wear glasses. Since 40% of the students wear glasses, I can calculate that by taking 40% of 50. To find a percentage of a number, I multiply the percentage by the number. But I need to remember that 40% is the same as 40/100 or 0.40 in decimal form.\n\nSo, the number of students who wear glasses is 0.40 times 50. Let me do that calculation: 0.40 \u00d7 50 = 20. So, 20 students wear glasses.\n\nNow, to find out how many students do not wear glasses, I subtract the number of students who wear glasses from the total number of students. That would be 50 minus 20, which equals 30.\n\nTherefore, 30 students do not wear glasses.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Percentages can sometimes be tricky. If 40% wear glasses, then the remaining percentage should not wear glasses. Since the total is 100%, then 100% minus 40% is 60%. So, 60% of the students do not wear glasses.\n\nLet me calculate 60% of 50 to confirm. 60% is 0.60 in decimal form, so 0.60 \u00d7 50 = 30. Yep, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer: 30 students do not wear glasses.\n\nI think that makes sense. I used two different approaches and got the same result, which gives me confidence that my answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
