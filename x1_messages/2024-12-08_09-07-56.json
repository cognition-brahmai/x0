The painting is titled \"The Treachery of Images\" (La trahison des images), and it was created in 1928-1929. The painting depicts a realistic portrayal of a pipe, accompanied by the caption \"Ceci n'est pas une pipe,\" which indeed translates to \"This is not a pipe.\" Magritte's intention was to challenge the viewer's perception and understanding of representation, highlighting the difference between an image and the real object it represents."
