        "content": "Yes, this triangle is a right-angled triangle. To determine if a triangle is right-angled, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nIn this case, the sides of the triangle are 7 cm, 24 cm, and 25 cm. Let's assume that the side with length 25 cm is the hypotenuse. We can check if the Pythagorean theorem holds:\n\n\\( 25^2 = 7^2 + 24^2 \\)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n\\( 25^2 = 625 \\)\n\n\\( 7^2 = 49 \\)\n\n\\( 24^2 = 576 \\)\n\nNow, add the squares of the two shorter sides:\n\n\\( 49 + 576 = 625 \\)\n\nSince \\( 625 = 625 \\), the Pythagorean theorem is satisfied, confirming that the triangle is indeed a right-angled triangle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yes, it is a right-angled triangle.}} \\]"
