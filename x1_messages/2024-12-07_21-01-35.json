        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a square with side lengths of 10 units, and I need to find the area of the largest circle that can fit inside it. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize this. I have a square, all sides are equal, so each side is 10 units long. Now, the largest circle that can fit inside this square would be the one that touches all four sides of the square without going over. That means the circle's diameter should be equal to the side length of the square.\n\nWait, is that right? If the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square, then the circle would touch all four sides perfectly. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, diameter of the circle = side length of the square = 10 units.\n\nNow, I know that the area of a circle is given by the formula A = \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius of the circle.\n\nBut here, I have the diameter, not the radius. No problem, because the radius is half of the diameter. So, r = diameter / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 units.\n\nAlright, plugging that into the area formula: A = \u03c0 * (5)\u00b2 = \u03c0 * 25.\n\nI could leave it like that, but maybe I should use a numerical approximation for \u03c0. Typically, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416.\n\nSo, A \u2248 3.1416 * 25 = 78.54 square units.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem didn't specify to use a decimal approximation. Maybe it's better to leave it in terms of \u03c0.\n\nSo, the exact area would be 25\u03c0 square units.\n\nLet me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes here. The side length is 10 units, diameter of the circle is 10 units, radius is 5 units, area is \u03c0r\u00b2 = 25\u03c0.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it differently. Suppose I consider the diagonal of the square. But no, that would be for a larger circle that perhaps touches the square at the midpoints of the sides, but in this case, we're looking for the largest circle that fits entirely inside the square, which should be the one with diameter equal to the side length.\n\nWait, is there a larger circle that can fit inside the square? Let's see. If I try to make the circle larger than the side length, it would start overlapping the sides of the square, which isn't allowed. So, the diameter must be equal to the side length, which is 10 units.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the circumference of the circle touching the midpoints of the square's sides. But no, if the diameter is equal to the side length, then the circle would touch the square at the midpoints of its sides.\n\nLet me verify this with a quick sketch.\n\n[Sketching a square with side length 10 units and a circle inside it touching all four sides at their midpoints.]\n\nYes, that looks right. The circle's center would be at the center of the square, and the radius would extend to the midpoints of the sides.\n\nSo, radius = 5 units, area = 25\u03c0 square units.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to fit a larger circle inside the square. For example, if I tilt the circle or something. But no, a circle is symmetric, and the largest possible circle inside a square will always be the one with diameter equal to the side length of the square.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25\\pi} \\]"
