        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. We're trying to find out how many marbles John has, and we're given some relationships between the number of marbles that John, Tom, and Jerry have.\n\nFirst, we know that Jerry has 7 marbles. That's our starting point.\n\nNext, it's said that Tom has 3 more marbles than Jerry. So, if Jerry has 7 marbles, then Tom has 7 + 3 = 10 marbles.\n\nNow, John has twice as many marbles as Tom. Since Tom has 10 marbles, John must have 2 * 10 = 20 marbles.\n\nSo, the answer is that John has 20 marbles.\n\nTo make sure we're correct, let's check the relationships again:\n\n- Jerry has 7 marbles.\n\n- Tom has 3 more than Jerry: 7 + 3 = 10 marbles.\n\n- John has twice as many as Tom: 2 * 10 = 20 marbles.\n\nEverything checks out. Therefore, John has 20 marbles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
