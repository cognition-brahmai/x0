        "content": "So the train is going at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, and it takes 30 minutes to travel between two stations. Then, after leaving the second station, it stops for 15 minutes before continuing. We need to find out the total time it takes for the train to travel between the two stations and complete its stop.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the time taken to travel between the stations. It's given that it takes 30 minutes to travel between them. So, the travel time is 30 minutes.\n\nNext, after leaving the second station, the train stops for 15 minutes. So, we need to add this stop time to the travel time.\n\nTotal time = travel time + stop time\n= 30 minutes + 15 minutes\n= 45 minutes\n\nSo, it takes 45 minutes for the train to travel between the two stations and complete its stop.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check if there's anything else we need to consider. The speed of the train is given as 60 miles per hour, but we don't need to calculate the distance between the stations because the travel time is already provided directly as 30 minutes.\n\nJust to be thorough, if we wanted to find the distance between the stations, we could use the formula:\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time\n\nGiven that speed is 60 miles per hour and time is 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours.\n\nDistance = 60 mph \u00d7 0.5 hours = 30 miles\n\nSo, the stations are 30 miles apart. But since the question only asks for the total time taken to travel between the stations and complete the stop, we don't need this information.\n\nTherefore, the total time is 45 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
