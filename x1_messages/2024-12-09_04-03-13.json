        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a hotel trying to figure out how many rooms their housekeeping staff can clean in one shift. They've got different types of rooms\u2014standard, suites, and penthouses\u2014each taking different amounts of time to clean. The hotel has a bunch of each type, and there's a certain number of staff working shifts. I need to find out the maximum number of rooms that can be cleaned in one shift, assuming everything is divided equally among the staff.\n\nFirst, I need to understand all the details given:\n\n- Time to clean each type of room:\n\n  - Standard room: 25 minutes\n\n  - Suite: 45 minutes\n\n  - Penthouse: 1 hour (which is 60 minutes)\n\n- Number of each type of room:\n\n  - 200 standard rooms\n\n  - 50 suites\n\n  - 10 penthouses\n\n- Staff information:\n\n  - Each shift is 8 hours long\n\n  - There are 20 staff members per shift\n\nOkay, so the total available time for cleaning per shift is the number of staff members multiplied by the hours they work, converted into minutes because the cleaning times are in minutes.\n\nFirst, convert the shift time into minutes:\n\n8 hours(shift) \u00d7 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes per staff member per shift.\n\nNow, with 20 staff members, the total available minutes are:\n\n20 staff \u00d7 480 minutes/staff = 9600 minutes total.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how many rooms of each type can be cleaned within this total time.\n\nBut the problem says to assume an equal distribution of work among all staff members. I'm not entirely sure what that means in this context. Does it mean that each staff member cleans the same number of each type of room, or that the total time spent on each type of room is the same across all staff?\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps it just means that the work is divided equally among the staff, but not necessarily that each staff member cleans the same types of rooms. In that case, maybe I can just consider the total available time and the time required to clean each type of room, and see how many of each can be cleaned.\n\nBut wait, the hotel has a fixed number of each type of room, and presumably, they all need to be cleaned. So maybe the question is about how many of each type can be cleaned in one shift, given the total available time, and then sum them up to get the total number of rooms cleaned.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to find out the maximum number of rooms that can be cleaned, considering the time required for each type, and the total available time.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should calculate the time required to clean all the rooms of each type and see if it fits into the total available time.\n\nFirst, calculate the total time required to clean all standard rooms:\n\n200 standard rooms \u00d7 25 minutes/room = 5000 minutes.\n\nTotal time for suites:\n\n50 suites \u00d7 45 minutes/suite = 2250 minutes.\n\nTotal time for penthouses:\n\n10 penthouses \u00d7 60 minutes/penthouse = 600 minutes.\n\nNow, sum these up to get the total time required to clean all rooms:\n\n5000 + 2250 + 600 = 7850 minutes.\n\nNow, compare this to the total available time: 9600 minutes.\n\nSince 7850 minutes is less than 9600 minutes, it seems that all rooms can be cleaned within one shift.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward, and maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the question is about maximizing the number of rooms cleaned, considering that there might be more rooms than can be cleaned in one shift, but in this case, it looks like all rooms can be cleaned.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hotel wants to clean as many rooms as possible, but not necessarily all, and find out the maximum that can be cleaned.\n\nBut according to the calculations above, since 7850 minutes are needed and 9600 are available, all rooms can be cleaned.\n\nPerhaps there's a constraint I'm missing. Maybe the staff can't clean fractional rooms, or maybe there's a priority on cleaning certain types of rooms first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equal distribution of work means that each staff member spends the same amount of time cleaning different types of rooms.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should approach it differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that each staff member has 480 minutes per shift.\n\nIf the work is distributed equally among all staff members, perhaps each staff member cleans a combination of room types such that the time spent on each type is the same.\n\nBut that might not necessarily lead to maximizing the total number of rooms cleaned.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"equal distribution of work\" means that each staff member cleans the same number of each type of room.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense because the cleaning times are different.\n\nWait, perhaps it means that each staff member cleans a certain number of each type of room, proportionate to their cleaning times, so that the total time spent by each staff member is 480 minutes.\n\nThat sounds more plausible.\n\nSo, let's define variables for the number of each type of room cleaned by each staff member.\n\nLet:\n\n- \\(s\\) = number of standard rooms cleaned by each staff member\n\n- \\(u\\) = number of suites cleaned by each staff member\n\n- \\(p\\) = number of penthouses cleaned by each staff member\n\nThen, the total time spent by each staff member is:\n\n\\(25s + 45u + 60p = 480\\) minutes.\n\nNow, the total number of each type of room cleaned in one shift would be:\n\n- Total standard rooms cleaned: \\(20s\\)\n\n- Total suites cleaned: \\(20u\\)\n\n- Total penthouses cleaned: \\(20p\\)\n\nAnd these should not exceed the total number available:\n\n- \\(20s \\leq 200\\)\n\n- \\(20u \\leq 50\\)\n\n- \\(20p \\leq 10\\)\n\nSo, \\(s \\leq 10\\), \\(u \\leq 2.5\\), \\(p \\leq 0.5\\)\n\nBut since the number of rooms cleaned must be integers, \\(u\\) and \\(p\\) should be integers as well, so \\(u \\leq 2\\) and \\(p \\leq 0\\)\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If \\(p\\) has to be an integer and \\(p \\leq 0.5\\), then \\(p = 0\\). Similarly, \\(u \\leq 2.5\\), so \\(u \\leq 2\\).\n\nBut that can't be right because the hotel has 50 suites and 10 penthouses, which need to be cleaned.\n\nPerhaps my assumption that each staff member cleans the same number of each type of room is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"equal distribution of work\" means that each staff member works for the same amount of time, but cleans different combinations of rooms.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to maximize the total number of rooms cleaned, given the time constraints.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the goal is to clean as many rooms as possible, regardless of type, within the total available time.\n\nIn that case, I should prioritize cleaning the rooms that take the least time to clean first, because they allow cleaning more rooms in the same amount of time.\n\nSo, the priority would be:\n\n1. Standard rooms (25 minutes each)\n\n2. Suites (45 minutes each)\n\n3. Penthouses (60 minutes each)\n\nSo, first, clean as many standard rooms as possible, then suites, then penthouses, until the time runs out.\n\nBut, we have to consider that there are limited numbers of each type of room.\n\nSo, let's calculate the total time required if we clean all standard rooms:\n\n200 standard rooms \u00d7 25 minutes = 5000 minutes\n\nThen, clean all suites:\n\n50 suites \u00d7 45 minutes = 2250 minutes\n\nTotal so far: 5000 + 2250 = 7250 minutes\n\nThen, clean as many penthouses as possible with the remaining time:\n\nTotal available time: 9600 minutes\n\nTime used: 7250 minutes\n\nRemaining time: 9600 - 7250 = 2350 minutes\n\nEach penthouse takes 60 minutes, so number of penthouses that can be cleaned:\n\n2350 / 60 \u2248 39.166, so 39 penthouses\n\nBut the hotel only has 10 penthouses, so all 10 can be cleaned.\n\nTherefore, total rooms cleaned:\n\n200 standard + 50 suites + 10 penthouses = 260 rooms\n\nAnd the total time used would be:\n\n200\u00d725 + 50\u00d745 + 10\u00d760 = 5000 + 2250 + 600 = 7850 minutes\n\nBut the total available time is 9600 minutes, so all rooms can be cleaned within one shift.\n\nWait, but in this approach, I'm assuming that we clean all standard rooms first, then suites, then penthouses, but maybe there's a better way to maximize the number of rooms cleaned.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider cleaning more of the faster rooms.\n\nBut since all rooms need to be cleaned, and the total time required is less than the total available time, perhaps it's straightforward that all rooms can be cleaned in one shift.\n\nBut the problem might be expecting me to show the calculation step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hotel wants to maximize the number of rooms cleaned, but not all rooms need to be cleaned in one shift. Maybe they just want to see the maximum number that can be cleaned in one shift.\n\nIn that case, perhaps I need to consider that not all rooms need to be cleaned, and choose the combination that maximizes the number of rooms cleaned within the available time.\n\nThis sounds like an optimization problem, possibly a linear programming problem, but maybe there's a simpler way to approach it.\n\nLet me consider the time per room for each type:\n\n- Standard: 25 minutes per room\n\n- Suite: 45 minutes per room\n\n- Penthouse: 60 minutes per room\n\nIf the goal is to maximize the number of rooms cleaned, regardless of type, then I should prioritize cleaning the rooms that take the least time first.\n\nSo, first clean as many standard rooms as possible, then suites, then penthouses.\n\nGiven that, let's calculate:\n\nTotal available time: 9600 minutes\n\nFirst, clean standard rooms:\n\nEach standard room takes 25 minutes.\n\nNumber of standard rooms that can be cleaned: 9600 / 25 = 384 rooms\n\nBut the hotel only has 200 standard rooms, so clean all 200 standard rooms.\n\nTime used: 200 \u00d7 25 = 5000 minutes\n\nRemaining time: 9600 - 5000 = 4600 minutes\n\nNext, clean suites:\n\nEach suite takes 45 minutes.\n\nNumber of suites that can be cleaned with 4600 minutes: 4600 / 45 \u2248 102.22, so 102 suites\n\nBut the hotel only has 50 suites, so clean all 50 suites.\n\nTime used: 50 \u00d7 45 = 2250 minutes\n\nRemaining time: 4600 - 2250 = 2350 minutes\n\nFinally, clean penthouses:\n\nEach penthouse takes 60 minutes.\n\nNumber of penthouses that can be cleaned with 2350 minutes: 2350 / 60 \u2248 39.166, so 39 penthouses\n\nBut the hotel only has 10 penthouses, so clean all 10 penthouses.\n\nTime used: 10 \u00d7 60 = 600 minutes\n\nTotal time used: 5000 + 2250 + 600 = 7850 minutes\n\nTotal rooms cleaned: 200 + 50 + 10 = 260 rooms\n\nNow, is there a better way to clean more rooms by choosing a different combination?\n\nFor example, if I clean fewer standard rooms and more suites or penthouses, might I be able to clean more total rooms?\n\nLet\u2019s consider that standard rooms take 25 minutes each, suites 45, and penthouses 60.\n\nThe number of rooms cleaned per minute is:\n\n- Standard: 1/25 = 0.04 rooms per minute\n\n- Suite: 1/45 \u2248 0.0222 rooms per minute\n\n- Penthouse: 1/60 \u2248 0.0167 rooms per minute\n\nSo, standard rooms give the highest return in terms of rooms per minute.\n\nTherefore, prioritizing standard rooms makes sense for maximizing the total number of rooms cleaned.\n\nHence, the initial approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to allocate time to different types of rooms to maximize the total number cleaned.\n\nThis sounds like a linear programming problem, where we want to maximize the sum of rooms cleaned, subject to the total time constraint.\n\nLet me define variables:\n\nLet \\(x\\) = number of standard rooms cleaned\n\n\\(y\\) = number of suites cleaned\n\n\\(z\\) = number of penthouses cleaned\n\nObjective: maximize \\(x + y + z\\)\n\nSubject to:\n\n25x + 45y + 60z \u2264 9600 (total time available)\n\nx \u2264 200\n\ny \u2264 50\n\nz \u2264 10\n\nx, y, z \u2265 0 and integers\n\nThis is a linear programming problem with integer constraints.\n\nSolving such problems can be complex, but given the numbers, perhaps I can use a simplex method or some optimization software, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll stick to the earlier approach.\n\nGiven that standard rooms give the highest rooms per minute ratio, cleaning them first makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, suites have a higher ratio than penthouses, so cleaning suites next is logical.\n\nTherefore, cleaning all standard rooms, then all suites, then as many penthouses as possible with the remaining time seems to be the optimal strategy.\n\nHence, the maximum number of rooms that can be cleaned in one shift is 260.\n\nBut to confirm, let me check if there's any other combination that could yield more than 260 rooms.\n\nSuppose I decide to clean fewer standard rooms and more suites or penthouses.\n\nFor example, if I clean 190 standard rooms:\n\n190 \u00d7 25 = 4750 minutes\n\nRemaining time: 9600 - 4750 = 4850 minutes\n\nThen, clean suites:\n\n4850 / 45 \u2248 107.77, so 107 suites\n\nBut the hotel only has 50 suites, so clean all 50 suites.\n\nTime used: 50 \u00d7 45 = 2250 minutes\n\nRemaining time: 4850 - 2250 = 2600 minutes\n\nThen, clean penthouses:\n\n2600 / 60 \u2248 43.33, so 43 penthouses\n\nBut the hotel only has 10 penthouses, so clean all 10.\n\nTime used: 10 \u00d7 60 = 600 minutes\n\nTotal time used: 4750 + 2250 + 600 = 7600 minutes\n\nTotal rooms cleaned: 190 + 50 + 10 = 250 rooms\n\nThis is fewer than the previous total of 260 rooms.\n\nAnother example: clean 150 standard rooms:\n\n150 \u00d7 25 = 3750 minutes\n\nRemaining time: 9600 - 3750 = 5850 minutes\n\nClean suites: 50 suites (since there are only 50)\n\nTime used: 50 \u00d7 45 = 2250 minutes\n\nRemaining time: 5850 - 2250 = 3600 minutes\n\nClean penthouses: 3600 / 60 = 60 penthouses\n\nBut only 10 penthouses, so clean 10.\n\nTime used: 10 \u00d7 60 = 600 minutes\n\nTotal time used: 3750 + 2250 + 600 = 6600 minutes\n\nTotal rooms cleaned: 150 + 50 + 10 = 210 rooms\n\nAgain, fewer than 260.\n\nOne more try: clean 250 standard rooms.\n\nBut the hotel only has 200 standard rooms, so this is not possible.\n\nIt seems that cleaning all standard rooms, all suites, and all penthouses is the optimal strategy, yielding 260 rooms cleaned.\n\nMoreover, the total time required is 7850 minutes, which is less than the total available time of 9600 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the hotel can clean all rooms within one shift.\n\nBut perhaps there are more rooms that can be cleaned beyond the existing inventory. Maybe clean some rooms multiple times, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hotel can assign some staff to clean the same room multiple times, but that wouldn't maximize the number of unique rooms cleaned.\n\nGiven that, the maximum number of unique rooms that can be cleaned in one shift is 260.\n\nWait, but the total time available is 9600 minutes, and the time required to clean all rooms is 7850 minutes.\n\nSo, there is extra time of 9600 - 7850 = 1750 minutes.\n\nCould this extra time be used to clean additional rooms?\n\nBut since all rooms have been cleaned, and presumably, the hotel doesn't need to clean the same room multiple times in one shift, the maximum number remains 260 rooms.\n\nAlternatively, if the hotel has some rooms that are cleaned multiple times in a shift, but that seems unnecessary and not the intent of the question.\n\nHence, the maximum number of unique rooms that can be cleaned in one shift is 260.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 260 rooms.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{260}"
