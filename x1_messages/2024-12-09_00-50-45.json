        "content": "Let's see. The baker uses 2 cups of flour to make 12 cookies. So, if they want to make 60 cookies, I need to figure out how much flour that would require.\n\nFirst, I should find out how much flour is needed for one cookie. If 2 cups make 12 cookies, then for one cookie, it would be 2 cups divided by 12 cookies. That is, 2/12 = 1/6 cup per cookie.\n\nNow, if one cookie requires 1/6 cup of flour, then 60 cookies would require 60 times that amount. So, 60 * (1/6) = 60/6 = 10 cups of flour.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me check another way. If 2 cups make 12 cookies, then to make 60 cookies, which is 5 times more (since 60 divided by 12 is 5), they would need 5 times the flour. So, 2 cups * 5 = 10 cups.\n\nOkay, both ways, I'm getting 10 cups of flour needed for 60 cookies. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
