        "content": "So I need to compute the double integral of xy over the region bounded by y equals x and y equals x squared. Alright, let's start by understanding the region we're dealing with.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize or sketch the area bounded by these two curves: y = x and y = x\u00b2. The curve y = x is a straight line passing through the origin with a slope of 1, and y = x\u00b2 is a parabola that also passes through the origin and opens upwards.\n\nTo find the points of intersection between these two curves, I set them equal to each other:\n\nx = x\u00b2\n\nRearranging, x\u00b2 - x = 0, which factors to x(x - 1) = 0. So, the points of intersection are at x = 0 and x = 1.\n\nTherefore, the region we're interested in is between x = 0 and x = 1, where y ranges from y = x\u00b2 up to y = x.\n\nNow, for a double integral over this region, I need to set up the integral limits accordingly. Since we're integrating with respect to x and y, I'll choose the order of integration. Let's integrate with respect to y first, and then x.\n\nSo, the double integral can be set up as:\n\n\u222b(from x=0 to x=1) \u222b(from y=x\u00b2 to y=x) xy dy dx\n\nFirst, I'll integrate with respect to y:\n\n\u222b(from y=x\u00b2 to y=x) xy dy\n\nTreat x as a constant here. So, integrating xy with respect to y:\n\n(1/2) x y\u00b2 | from y = x\u00b2 to y = x\n\nPlugging in the limits:\n\n(1/2) x (x)^2 - (1/2) x (x\u00b2)^2 = (1/2) x^3 - (1/2) x^5\n\nNow, I need to integrate this result with respect to x from 0 to 1:\n\n\u222b(from x=0 to x=1) [(1/2) x^3 - (1/2) x^5] dx\n\nI can factor out the 1/2:\n\n(1/2) \u222b(from x=0 to x=1) (x^3 - x^5) dx\n\nNow, integrate term by term:\n\n(1/2) [ (1/4)x^4 - (1/6)x^6 ] evaluated from 0 to 1\n\nPlugging in the limits:\n\n(1/2) [ (1/4)(1)^4 - (1/6)(1)^6 - (1/4)(0)^4 + (1/6)(0)^6 ] = (1/2) [ 1/4 - 1/6 ]\n\nNow, compute 1/4 - 1/6:\n\nFind a common denominator, which is 12: (3/12 - 2/12) = 1/12\n\nSo, (1/2)(1/12) = 1/24\n\nTherefore, the double integral of xy over the region bounded by y = x and y = x\u00b2 is 1/24.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{24}} \\]"
