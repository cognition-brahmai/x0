        "content": "So I've got this probability question here: If you roll a fair six-sided die twice, what's the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled will be equal to 8? Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that a fair six-sided die has sides numbered from 1 to 6, and each side has an equal chance of landing face up. Since I'm rolling the die twice, there are a total of 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes, because each roll is independent of the other.\n\nNow, I need to find out in how many of these 36 possible outcomes the sum of the two rolls is equal to 8. So, I should list out all the possible pairs of numbers that add up to 8.\n\nLet me think: \n\n- If the first roll is 2, the second roll must be 6 (2 + 6 = 8)\n\n- If the first roll is 3, the second roll must be 5 (3 + 5 = 8)\n\n- If the first roll is 4, the second roll must be 4 (4 + 4 = 8)\n\n- If the first roll is 5, the second roll must be 3 (5 + 3 = 8)\n\n- If the first roll is 6, the second roll must be 2 (6 + 2 = 8)\n\nWait, and what if the first roll is 1? 1 + 7 = 8, but 7 is not possible on a six-sided die, so that doesn't count.\n\nSo, the possible pairs are:\n\n- (2, 6)\n\n- (3, 5)\n\n- (4, 4)\n\n- (5, 3)\n\n- (6, 2)\n\nThat's 5 possible combinations.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 5 / 36.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIs there any other pair that adds up to 8? Let's see:\n\n- (1, 7) \u2013 not possible\n\n- (2, 6) \u2013 already counted\n\n- (3, 5) \u2013 already counted\n\n- (4, 4) \u2013 already counted\n\n- (5, 3) \u2013 already counted\n\n- (6, 2) \u2013 already counted\n\nNo, that's all.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it using combinations or permutations, but since the order matters in terms of sequences of rolls, it's better to stick with the straightforward approach.\n\nSo, the probability is 5/36.\n\nWait a second, but if the die is fair and each roll is independent, then yes, this should be correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if (4, 4) is only counted once, which it is, because it's the same number on both dice.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 5/36.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{36}} \\]"
