        "content": "So the factory produces 250 widgets per day, and each widget sells for $12. We need to find out the total revenue for selling all the widgets produced in one month, assuming there are 30 days in that month.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many widgets are produced in the entire month. Since it's 250 widgets per day for 30 days, I can multiply 250 by 30 to get the total monthly production.\n\nSo, 250 widgets/day \u00d7 30 days = 7,500 widgets.\n\nNow, each of these widgets sells for $12, so to find the total revenue, I need to multiply the number of widgets by the price per widget.\n\nThat would be 7,500 widgets \u00d7 $12/widget.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 7,500 \u00d7 12.\n\nWell, 7,500 \u00d7 10 is 75,000, and 7,500 \u00d7 2 is 15,000. So, adding those together, 75,000 + 15,000 equals 90,000.\n\nTherefore, the total revenue generated by selling all the widgets produced in one month is $90,000.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with daily production: 250 widgets/day.\n\nOver 30 days: 250 \u00d7 30 = 7,500 widgets.\n\nEach widget sells for $12, so total revenue is 7,500 \u00d7 12.\n\nYes, 7,500 \u00d7 12 is indeed 90,000.\n\nSo, $90,000 is the total revenue for the month.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect this, like production costs or taxes. However, the question only asks for the total revenue generated from selling the widgets, so probably, that's all that's needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the month has more or fewer days, but the question specifies to assume 30 days, so I'm good there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the price per widget changes, but again, the question states each widget sells for $12, so I can take that as constant.\n\nSo, I think $90,000 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90000} \\]"
