        "content": "Alright, so the theme park has a budget of $15 million to add new attractions. They want to build three new roller coasters, two water rides, and one interactive experience. The budget allocation is 40% for roller coasters, 30% for water rides, and 30% for the interactive experience. Then, they want to know how many additional visitors they need to break even, with an average ticket price of $60 per person.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the individual budgets for each type of attraction.\n\nTotal budget: $15,000,000\n\nRoller coasters: 40% of $15,000,000\n\nWater rides: 30% of $15,000,000\n\nInteractive experience: 30% of $15,000,000\n\nLet's calculate each one.\n\nRoller coasters:\n\n40% of $15,000,000 = 0.40 * 15,000,000 = $6,000,000\n\nWater rides:\n\n30% of $15,000,000 = 0.30 * 15,000,000 = $4,500,000\n\nInteractive experience:\n\n30% of $15,000,000 = 0.30 * 15,000,000 = $4,500,000\n\nSo, the budgets are:\n\n- Roller coasters: $6,000,000\n\n- Water rides: $4,500,000\n\n- Interactive experience: $4,500,000\n\nNow, they want to know how many additional visitors are needed to break even on this $15 million investment, with each ticket costing $60.\n\nTo find the break-even point, we need to divide the total investment by the ticket price.\n\nBreak-even point (in visitors) = Total investment / Ticket price\n\nSo,\n\nBreak-even point = $15,000,000 / $60\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n15,000,000 divided by 60.\n\nWell, 60 times 250,000 is 15,000,000.\n\nSo, break-even point = 250,000 visitors\n\nTherefore, the theme park needs an additional 250,000 visitors to break even on their $15 million investment, assuming each visitor pays $60 for a ticket.\n\nBut wait, is there more to consider here? Is there any additional cost per visitor or is the $60 ticket price pure profit?\n\nHmm.\n\nIn reality, theme parks have operating costs per visitor, like maintenance, staff, utilities, etc. So, the profit per ticket might be less than the $60 ticket price.\n\nBut according to the question, it's to estimate the number of additional visitors needed to break even on the investment, considering an average ticket price of $60 per person.\n\nIt seems like we're supposed to assume that the entire ticket price is contributing to covering the investment, which might not be entirely accurate in real life, but perhaps for the sake of this calculation, we can proceed that way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $60 is the additional revenue per visitor, and we're supposed to consider that all of it goes toward paying back the investment.\n\nIn any case, based on the information provided, the break-even point is 250,000 additional visitors.\n\nLet me just double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal investment: $15,000,000\n\nTicket price: $60\n\nBreak-even point: $15,000,000 / $60 = 250,000 visitors\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlso, just to be thorough, let's confirm the budget allocations.\n\nTotal budget: $15,000,000\n\nRoller coasters: 40% \u2192 $6,000,000\n\nWater rides: 30% \u2192 $4,500,000\n\nInteractive experience: 30% \u2192 $4,500,000\n\nAdding them up: $6,000,000 + $4,500,000 + $4,500,000 = $15,000,000\n\nPerfect, that checks out.\n\nSo, in summary, the individual budgets are:\n\n- Roller coasters: $6,000,000\n\n- Water rides: $4,500,000\n\n- Interactive experience: $4,500,000\n\nAnd the number of additional visitors needed to break even is 250,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{250000} \\]"
