        "content": "I've got this problem here. There are 8 pills, all looking the same, but one of them is poisonous and slightly heavier than the others. I have a balance scale to help me find the poisonous one. The challenge is to figure out the minimum number of times I need to use the scale to guarantee that I identify the poisonous pill.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how a balance scale works. It has two trays, and when I place items on both sides, it can tell me which side is heavier or if both sides are equal. So, it's not like a digital scale that gives exact measurements; it just compares the weights.\n\nOkay, starting with 8 pills. I need to find the one that's slightly heavier. Let me think about how to divide these pills for the first weighing.\n\nIf I divide the pills into three groups: two groups of three pills each and one group of two pills, that might be a good start. So, group A has three pills, group B has three pills, and group C has two pills.\n\nFor the first weighing, I can place group A on one side of the scale and group B on the other side.\n\nThere are two possible outcomes:\n\n1. The scale balances, meaning group A and group B weigh the same.\n\n2. The scale tips to one side, indicating that the heavier group contains the poisonous pill.\n\nLet's consider each case.\n\nFirst case: the scale balances.\n\nIf A and B are equal, then the poisonous pill must be in group C, which has two pills. So, for the second weighing, I can take one pill from group C and place it on one side of the scale, and take a known good pill from group A or B and place it on the other side.\n\nSince I know that all pills in groups A and B are good (because the scale balanced), I can use one of those as a reference.\n\nSo, if the scale tips, the side with the pill from group C is heavier, meaning that's the poisonous one. If the scale balances, then the other pill in group C is the poisonous one.\n\nSo, in this case, I would need two weighings to find the poisonous pill.\n\nNow, let's consider the second case: the scale tips, say group A is heavier than group B.\n\nThat means the poisonous pill is in group A, because it's the one that's slightly heavier.\n\nSo, now I have three pills in group A, one of which is poisonous.\n\nFor the second weighing, I can take two pills from group A and place them on both sides of the scale.\n\nAgain, there are two possibilities:\n\n1. The scale balances, meaning the two pills I weighed are equal, so the third pill in group A is the poisonous one.\n\n2. The scale tips, indicating which one of the two pills is heavier, and therefore poisonous.\n\nSo, in this case, again, two weighings are needed.\n\nWait a minute, is there a way to find the poisonous pill in just one weighing? Let's think about that.\n\nIf I try to compare four pills against four pills, but that wouldn't help because if the scale tips, I still have four pills to consider, and I'd need another weighing to narrow it down.\n\nSimilarly, comparing two against two wouldn't be efficient enough.\n\nSo, it seems that the method I initially thought of, dividing into three groups (three, three, and two), and then proceeding with two weighings, is the most efficient way.\n\nBut let me see if there's a better way.\n\nMaybe I can use some kind of coding or labeling to minimize the number of weighings.\n\nLet's number the pills from 1 to 8.\n\nI need to plan all the weighings in advance, deciding which pills to place on the scale each time, and based on the results, identify the poisonous pill.\n\nPerhaps I can think in terms of information theory. Each weighing gives me a certain amount of information, depending on the outcome.\n\nA balance scale has three possible outcomes for each weighing: left side heavier, right side heavier, or equal.\n\nSo, each weighing gives me log2(3) bits of information, which is approximately 1.58 bits.\n\nI have 8 possible pills, so the uncertainty is log2(8) = 3 bits.\n\nTherefore, theoretically, I need at least 3 / log2(3) \u2248 1.90 weighings. Since I can't have a fraction of a weighing, I need at least 2 weighings.\n\nSo, according to information theory, two weighings are sufficient to identify the poisonous pill.\n\nThat matches what I thought earlier.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to do it more efficiently or with a different approach.\n\nLet me try to think of another method.\n\nSuppose I take one pill and weigh it against another.\n\nIf they balance, they're both good, so the poisonous one is among the remaining six.\n\nThen, I take two more pills and weigh them against each other.\n\nAgain, if they balance, they're good, and the poisonous one is among the remaining four.\n\nContinuing this way, it seems like it would take more than two weighings, which is worse than my initial approach.\n\nSo, that's not better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that I can weigh multiple pills at once and use the differences in weight to pinpoint the poisonous one.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to do that in just one weighing.\n\nWait, perhaps there is a way to do it in one weighing.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nI can assign each pill a unique identifier using ternary digits since the scale has three outcomes.\n\nEach weighing can be thought of as a base-3 digit: left side heavier (0), equal (1), right side heavier (2), for example.\n\nIf I can assign each pill a unique combination of these digits across two weighings, then I can identify which pill is poisonous based on the outcomes.\n\nBut actually, maybe I can set up one weighing where I combine pills in such a way that the overall weight difference reveals which pill is poisonous.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to use one single weighing involving all the pills.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nIf I take all eight pills and place them on the scale, but that doesn't help because they're all together; I need to compare groups.\n\nWait, perhaps I can take subsets of the pills and weigh them in a specific way.\n\nLet me try to recall similar problems.\n\nI remember a similar problem with twelve balls and one defective one, and the goal is to find the defective one in three weighings.\n\nBut in that case, the defective ball could be heavier or lighter, which is a bit different.\n\nIn my current problem, I have eight pills, one slightly heavier, and I need to find it in two weighings.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach for the twelve-ball problem can be adapted here.\n\nIn the twelve-ball problem, the standard approach is to divide the balls into three groups of four and proceed accordingly.\n\nGiven that, maybe my initial approach of dividing the eight pills into three groups (three, three, two) is indeed the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more efficient division.\n\nLet me consider dividing the eight pills into three groups of three, three, and two, as I did earlier.\n\nFirst weighing: group A (pills 1,2,3) vs. group B (pills 4,5,6).\n\nCase 1: A equals B.\n\nThen, the poisonous pill is in group C (pills 7 and 8).\n\nSecond weighing: weigh pill 7 against a known good pill (say, pill 1).\n\n- If they balance, pill 8 is poisonous.\n\n- If pill 7 is heavier, then pill 7 is poisonous.\n\nCase 2: A is heavier than B.\n\nThen, the poisonous pill is in group A.\n\nSecond weighing: weigh pill 1 against pill 2.\n\n- If they balance, pill 3 is poisonous.\n\n- If pill 1 is heavier, pill 1 is poisonous.\n\n- If pill 2 is heavier, pill 2 is poisonous.\n\nCase 3: B is heavier than A.\n\nSimilarly, the poisonous pill is in group B.\n\nSecond weighing: weigh pill 4 against pill 5.\n\n- If they balance, pill 6 is poisonous.\n\n- If pill 4 is heavier, pill 4 is poisonous.\n\n- If pill 5 is heavier, pill 5 is poisonous.\n\nSo, in all cases, I can find the poisonous pill in two weighings.\n\nIs there a way to do it in one weighing?\n\nLet me think.\n\nIf I take certain pills and weigh them against others in a specific combination, maybe the overall weight difference can point directly to the poisonous pill.\n\nFor example, perhaps I can take a combination of pills and arrange them on the scale in such a way that the difference in weight uniquely identifies the poisonous pill.\n\nThis sounds a bit like assigning weights or codes to each pill and then summing them up in a particular way.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to set this up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the idea of distinct powers of three, as in the twelve-ball problem.\n\nWait, in the twelve-ball problem, each ball is assigned a unique number in base three, and then based on that, you determine which weighing it goes to, left side, right side, or not weighed.\n\nBut in my case, I have eight pills, which is a power of two, not three, but maybe the same principle applies.\n\nLet me try to assign each pill a unique number in base three with two digits, since I'm planning for two weighings.\n\nBut actually, with two weighings, each weighing has three outcomes, so theoretically, I can distinguish up to 3^2 = 9 possibilities.\n\nSince I only have eight pills, it should be possible to find the poisonous one in two weighings.\n\nSo, perhaps I can assign each pill a unique combination of outcomes.\n\nLet's try to assign each pill to the left or right side of the scale for each weighing based on its number.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nMaybe I should look for a more straightforward approach.\n\nLet me consider the initial method again.\n\nDivide the eight pills into three groups: three, three, and two.\n\nFirst weighing: group A (pills 1,2,3) vs. group B (pills 4,5,6).\n\n- If A equals B, then the poisonous pill is in group C (7,8). Weigh pill 7 against a known good pill to determine which is poisonous.\n\n- If A is heavier than B, the poisonous pill is in group A. Weigh pill 1 against pill 2 to find which one is heavier, or if they balance, pill 3 is poisonous.\n\n- If B is heavier than A, the poisonous pill is in group B. Weigh pill 4 against pill 5 to find which one is heavier, or if they balance, pill 6 is poisonous.\n\nThis seems solid, and it always allows me to identify the poisonous pill in exactly two weighings.\n\nIs there a way to do it in one weighing?\n\nI don't think so, because with one weighing, I can only get one of three outcomes (left heavier, equal, right heavier), which allows me to distinguish among three possibilities. But I have eight pills, which would require distinguishing among eight possibilities, which is more than the three outcomes can handle directly.\n\nTherefore, two weighings are necessary and sufficient.\n\nBut let me see if there's a clever way to use one weighing involving all the pills in some combination.\n\nSuppose I take one pill and place it on the left side, another pill on the right side, and then somehow interpret the difference to find the poisonous one.\n\nBut I don't see how that would work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can place multiple pills on each side in a specific combination.\n\nFor example, assign each pill a number from 0 to 7, and assign them to the weighings based on their binary representation.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the idea of distinct weights.\n\nSuppose I take pills 1, 2, and 3 and place them on the left side, and pills 4, 5, and 6 on the right side, and leave pills 7 and 8 out.\n\nIf the left side is heavier, the poisonous pill is among 1,2,3.\n\nIf the right side is heavier, it's among 4,5,6.\n\nIf they balance, it's among 7 and 8.\n\nThen, in the second weighing, I can weigh two of the suspected pills against each other to find the heavier one.\n\nThis is similar to my initial approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can include pills 7 and 8 in the first weighing in some way.\n\nBut I don't see an immediate benefit.\n\nAnother idea: in the first weighing, weigh pills 1,2,3 against pills 4,5,6.\n\nIf they balance, weigh pill 7 against pill 8 to find which one is heavier.\n\nIf pills 1,2,3 are heavier than pills 4,5,6, then the poisonous pill is in 1,2,3.\n\nWeigh pill 1 against pill 2.\n\nIf they balance, pill 3 is poisonous.\n\nIf one is heavier, that's the poisonous one.\n\nSimilarly, if pills 4,5,6 are heavier, weigh pill 4 against pill 5.\n\nIf they balance, pill 6 is poisonous.\n\nIf one is heavier, that's the poisonous one.\n\nThis again confirms that two weighings are sufficient.\n\nIs there a way to potentially find it in one weighing by being more clever?\n\nLet me consider assigning each pill a unique combination of being placed on the left side, the right side, or not weighed at all.\n\nSince there are three choices per pill, and I have two weighings, but I'm trying to do it in one weighing.\n\nWait, perhaps I can assign each pill to a specific side in one weighing such that the outcome uniquely identifies the poisonous pill.\n\nFor example, assign pills to the left and right sides in such a way that the difference in weight corresponds to a unique pill being poisonous.\n\nLet me try to assign pills to the scale.\n\nLet's number the pills from 1 to 8.\n\nAssign pill 1 to the left side, pill 2 to the right side, pill 3 to the left side, pill 4 to the right side, pill 5 to the left side, pill 6 to the right side, pill 7 to the left side, and leave pill 8 out.\n\nWait, but I need to consider the weights.\n\nThis seems too arbitrary.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of the ternary system.\n\nEach pill can be assigned a unique combination of positions in two weighings, each weighing having three outcomes.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to apply that here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to set up one weighing where the total weight difference reveals which pill is poisonous.\n\nBut I don't see a clear path to that.\n\nGiven that, I think the initial approach of two weighings is the most straightforward and efficient method to guarantee finding the poisonous pill.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of times I must use the scale is two.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
