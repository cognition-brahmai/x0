These tunnels house electrical lines, water pipes, sewer systems, and more, ensuring that the Strip remains vibrant and functional around the clock. Additionally, some older parts of the Strip have underground parking garages and service areas for hotels and casinos. It's a complex web of utilities and services that keep the \"Entertainment Capital of the World\" running smoothly."
