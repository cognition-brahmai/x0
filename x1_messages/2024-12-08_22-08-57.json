        "content": "I'm going to try to solve this riddle. It says, \"When there is fire in me then I am still cold. When I own your true love's face then you will not see me. To all things I give no more than I am given. In time I may have all things, and yet I can keep nothing.\"\n\nOkay, let's break this down piece by piece.\n\nFirst part: \"When there is fire in me then I am still cold.\" Hmm, that's interesting. Fire usually means heat, but here, even when there's fire in it, it's still cold. So maybe it's something that can contain fire without getting hot, or perhaps it's metaphorical.\n\nSecond part: \"When I own your true love's face then you will not see me.\" Owning your true love's face and you won't see me? Maybe it's something that reflects faces, like a mirror, but if it owns the face, perhaps it's a portrait or a photograph. But then, if it's a portrait, owning the face means it's captured, and maybe when that happens, you don't see the actual person anymore.\n\nThird part: \"To all things I give no more than I am given.\" This sounds like it's reciprocal, maybe something that gives back exactly what it receives. Like a mirror reflecting what's shown to it, or perhaps echo, which repeats what's said to it.\n\nFourth part: \"In time I may have all things, and yet I can keep nothing.\" This is tricky. Over time, it accumulates everything, but can't hold onto anything. Maybe something like water, which flows and holds things temporarily, but eventually lets them go. Or perhaps memory, which can store things but also forget over time.\n\nLet me see if there's a common theme here. A mirror comes to mind for a few parts. Mirrors can reflect fire, but they themselves are cold. They can show your true love's face, but when you look at the mirror, you're not seeing the actual person. Mirrors give back exactly what they receive, reflecting the image presented to them. And over time, mirrors reflect many things, but they don't keep any of them; whatever is reflected is temporary.\n\nAnother possibility is a camera or a photograph. A photograph can capture the face of your true love, but once it's captured, you don't see the living person in front of you. It gives back only what it's given, the image at the moment of capture. Over time, it can capture many things, but it can't hold onto them in the same way.\n\nBut considering all the parts, the mirror seems to fit better. Let me check each part again with mirror in mind.\n\nFirst part: Fire in a mirror\u2014mirrors can reflect fire, showing its image, but the mirror itself remains cold.\n\nSecond part: When the mirror owns your true love's face, meaning it reflects their face, but you're not seeing them in person.\n\nThird part: The mirror gives back exactly what it receives, reflecting the image without adding or subtracting.\n\nFourth part: Over time, mirrors reflect everything that comes before them, but they don't keep any of those images; they're constantly updating, so nothing is retained permanently.\n\nThis seems to align well with the riddle. However, maybe there's another answer. Let's consider a different angle.\n\nWhat about a lake or a body of water? Water can reflect fire (though it's risky to have fire near water), and the reflection would be cold. It can reflect your true love's face, but again, it's not the actual person. It gives back exactly what it's given, in terms of reflection. Over time, it reflects many things but doesn't keep any of them.\n\nBut mirrors seem to fit all parts perfectly, whereas water might not be as precise, especially the second part about owning your true love's face. A mirror actively reflects whatever is in front of it, while water reflection depends on the surface and might not be as clear or direct.\n\nAnother candidate could be a camera or a photo, but as I thought earlier, mirrors seem more fitting.\n\nLet me see if there's another option. What about a shadow? Shadows can be cold, even when there's fire present, because shadows are areas lacking light. But shadows don't own faces; they follow objects. So that doesn't seem to fit the second part.\n\nHow about memory? Memory can hold images of your true love's face, but when you recall it, you're not seeing them in person. It gives back only what it's given, meaning it recalls experiences as they were (though memory can be flawed). Over time, memory can accumulate many things, but it can also forget or lose details, so it doesn't keep everything permanently.\n\nMemory seems to fit the last part well, but the first part about fire being present and still being cold is tricky. Memory isn't directly related to fire and cold in a literal sense.\n\nMaybe it's something else entirely.\n\nWait, what about a camera or a photograph again? Let's think differently.\n\nA camera can capture the face of your true love, and once captured, you don't need to see them in person anymore because you have the photo. It gives back only what it's given, meaning the image at the moment of capture. Over time, it can hold many photos, but physically, it's just storing them, not keeping them in a permanent sense, as photos can be lost or deleted.\n\nBut mirrors seem more consistent across all parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a shadow box or a frame that holds photographs. It can own your true love's face by holding their photo, and when it does, you don't need to see them in person. It gives back only what it's given, the photo inside it. Over time, it can hold many photos, but it doesn't keep them permanently, as photos can be removed or lost.\n\nBut this is stretching it.\n\nLet me consider if there's a more abstract concept.\n\nWhat about a concept like 'reflection' itself, not just a physical mirror? Reflection can encompass both the physical reflection in a mirror and the mental reflection or contemplation.\n\nIn that case:\n\nFirst part: When there is fire in me, then I am still cold. Mental reflection on fire doesn't make the reflection hot; it remains abstract and cool.\n\nSecond part: When I own your true love's face, then you will not see me. If your reflection owns your true love's face, maybe it means you're so focused on your own reflection that you're not seeing your loved one directly.\n\nThird part: To all things I give no more than I am given. Reflection gives back only what is presented to it.\n\nFourth part: In time I may have all things, and yet I can keep nothing. Over time, reflection may encompass many images and thoughts, but it doesn't hold onto any of them permanently.\n\nThis seems to fit quite well too, perhaps even better in some aspects.\n\nBut the riddle seems to be referring to a thing, possibly an object, rather than an abstract concept. However, 'reflection' is a process or a phenomenon, not a physical object.\n\nMaybe it's a mirror after all.\n\nAlternatively, what about a lake or a still body of water that reflects like a mirror? It can reflect fire, remain cold, own your true love's face by reflecting it, and over time reflect many things without keeping any.\n\nBut again, mirror seems more precise.\n\nWait, maybe it's a photograph or a portrait. When a portrait owns your true love's face, meaning it captures their image, then you don't need to see them in person because you have the portrait.\n\nBut the first part about fire being in me and still being cold doesn't fit as well with a photograph.\n\nPhotographs can be printed on paper, which can be cold, but fire isn't typically associated with photographs in the same way as with mirrors.\n\nPerhaps it's a mirror.\n\nLet me consider the answer.\n\nI think the answer to the riddle is a mirror.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{mirror}} \\]"
