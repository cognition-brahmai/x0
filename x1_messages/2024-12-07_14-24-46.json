One name that immediately comes to mind is Elvis Presley. Yeah, Elvis is often referred to as the King of Rock and Roll. He had a lot of hits in the 50s and beyond, and \"Jailhouse Rock\" and \"Hound Dog\" are definitely two of his most famous songs.\n\nI remember listening to some of his music when I was younger. My parents really liked him, so he must have been a big deal back in the day. Elvis had this unique style that combined elements of country, blues, and gospel music, which helped shape the sound of rock and roll as we know it today.\n\nBesides his music, Elvis was also known for his iconic performances, like his appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show, where he caused a sensation with his energetic stage presence and, of course, his hip-swiveling dance moves. He also starred in several movies, which were pretty popular at the time.\n\nUnfortunately, Elvis's life was cut short when he died in 1977 at the age of 42, but his legacy lives on. He's still regarded as one of the most influential musicians in history, and his music continues to be enjoyed by people of all ages.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the legendary musician you're referring to is Elvis Presley, the King of Rock and Roll.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Elvis Presley}} \\]"
