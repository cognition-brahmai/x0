        "content": "To find the probability of getting exactly 6 heads in 10 flips of a fair coin, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is given by:\n\n\\[ P(k) = C(n,k) \\times p^k \\times q^{n - k} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( C(n,k) \\) is the combination of \\( n \\) things taken \\( k \\) at a time.\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of trials (in this case, 10 coin flips).\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of successful trials (in this case, 6 heads).\n\n- \\( p \\) is the probability of success in a single trial (for a fair coin, the probability of heads is 0.5).\n\n- \\( q \\) is the probability of failure in a single trial (for a fair coin, the probability of tails is also 0.5).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate \\( C(10,6) \\), which is the number of ways to choose 6 heads out of 10 flips. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[ C(n,k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ C(10,6) = \\frac{10!}{6! \\times 4!} \\]\n\nCalculating the factorials:\n\n- \\( 10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 3,628,800 \\)\n\n- \\( 6! = 720 \\)\n\n- \\( 4! = 24 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ C(10,6) = \\frac{3,628,800}{720 \\times 24} = \\frac{3,628,800}{17,280} = 210 \\]\n\nNext, since the coin is fair, \\( p = 0.5 \\) and \\( q = 0.5 \\). So,\n\n\\[ p^k = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 \\]\n\n\\[ q^{n - k} = (0.5)^{10 - 6} = (0.5)^4 = 0.0625 \\]\n\nNow, multiplying these together:\n\n\\[ P(6) = 210 \\times 0.015625 \\times 0.0625 \\]\n\nFirst, multiply \\( 210 \\times 0.015625 \\):\n\n\\[ 210 \\times 0.015625 = 3.28125 \\]\n\nThen, multiply the result by \\( 0.0625 \\):\n\n\\[ 3.28125 \\times 0.0625 = 0.205078125 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting exactly 6 heads in 10 flips of a fair coin is approximately 0.2051 or 20.51%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.2051} \\]"
