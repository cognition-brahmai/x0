        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to figure out how many students have brown eyes and how many have blue eyes in the original class of 30 students.\n\nGiven that 60% of the students have brown eyes, we can calculate the number of students with brown eyes as follows:\n\nNumber of students with brown eyes = 60% of 30 = 0.60 \u00d7 30 = 18 students\n\nSince the rest of the students have blue eyes, we can find the number of students with blue eyes by subtracting the number of students with brown eyes from the total number of students:\n\nNumber of students with blue eyes = Total students - Students with brown eyes = 30 - 18 = 12 students\n\nNow, the problem states that 5 more students with blue eyes join the class. So, we need to add these 5 students to the original 30 students and to the number of students with blue eyes:\n\nNew total number of students = Original total + New students = 30 + 5 = 35 students\n\nNew number of students with blue eyes = Original blue-eyed students + New blue-eyed students = 12 + 5 = 17 students\n\nFinally, to find the percentage of the class that has blue eyes after these new students join, we use the formula for percentage:\n\nPercentage of blue-eyed students = (Number of blue-eyed students / Total number of students) \u00d7 100\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nPercentage of blue-eyed students = (17 / 35) \u00d7 100\n\nNow, let's calculate that:\n\nFirst, divide 17 by 35:\n\n17 \u00f7 35 \u2248 0.4857\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n0.4857 \u00d7 100 \u2248 48.57%\n\nSo, after 5 more students with blue eyes join the class, approximately 48.57% of the class will have blue eyes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48.57\\%} \\]"
