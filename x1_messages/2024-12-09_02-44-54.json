        "content": "I'm sorry, but the information you provided seems to be incorrect. Martin Luther King Jr. was not a business tycoon or philanthropist in the way you described. He was a civil rights leader and Baptist minister who played a key role in the American civil rights movement. He was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee, not in New York City in 1988. His famous speech \"I Have a Dream\" was delivered during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, and it has indeed inspired people around the world, but it was not a book. There is a book compiled from his speeches and writings titled \"The Words of Martin Luther King, Jr.,\" but \"I Have a Dream\" is primarily known as a speech.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, please let me know."
