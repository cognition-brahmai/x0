        "content": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. The expression we have is: 8 - 2(3 + 7)^2 \u00f7 4. Okay, so first things first, I need to remember the order of operations. I think it's PEMDAS or something like that. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, I'll follow that.\n\nStarting with Parentheses. In the expression, there's (3 + 7). That's straightforward. 3 plus 7 is 10. So, the expression now becomes 8 - 2(10)^2 \u00f7 4.\n\nNext, Exponents. There's (10)^2. 10 squared is 100. So now, the expression is 8 - 2(100) \u00f7 4.\n\nNow, Multiplication and Division from left to right. Let's look at 2(100). That's the same as 2 multiplied by 100, which is 200. So, the expression is now 8 - 200 \u00f7 4.\n\nNext, division: 200 divided by 4 is 50. So, the expression simplifies to 8 - 50.\n\nFinally, subtraction: 8 - 50 equals -42.\n\nSo, the value of the expression is -42.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I missed something. Let's go through it again.\n\nOriginal expression: 8 - 2(3 + 7)^2 \u00f7 4.\n\nParentheses first: 3 + 7 = 10.\n\nSo, 8 - 2(10)^2 \u00f7 4.\n\nExponents: 10^2 = 100.\n\nNow, 8 - 2(100) \u00f7 4.\n\nMultiplication and division from left to right.\n\nFirst, 2 multiplied by 100 is 200.\n\nThen, 200 divided by 4 is 50.\n\nSo, 8 - 50 = -42.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if the subtraction and division need to be handled differently, but according to PEMDAS, multiplication and division are at the same level, so they're done left to right.\n\nSo, 2(100) is 200, and 200 \u00f7 4 is 50.\n\nThen, 8 - 50 is indeed -42.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-42} \\]"
