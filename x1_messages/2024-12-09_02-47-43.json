        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train going from City A to City B, and it takes 3 hours at a constant speed. Then, on its way back from City B to City A, it takes 4 hours because its average speed is slower due to track maintenance. We need to find the ratio of the train's speed going to City B compared to its speed coming back.\n\nFirst, let's recall that speed is equal to distance divided by time, right? So, speed (s) = distance (d) / time (t).\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- The speed from City A to City B as s1.\n\n- The speed from City B to City A as s2.\n\n- The distance between City A and City B as d.\n\nGiven that the time taken from A to B is 3 hours, we can write:\n\ns1 = d / 3\n\nSimilarly, the time taken from B to A is 4 hours, so:\n\ns2 = d / 4\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of s1 to s2, which is s1/s2.\n\nSubstituting the expressions we have:\n\ns1/s2 = (d / 3) / (d / 4)\n\nDividing fractions means multiplying by the reciprocal, so:\n\ns1/s2 = (d / 3) * (4 / d)\n\nThe d's cancel out:\n\ns1/s2 = (4 / 3)\n\nSo, the ratio of the train's speed on its way to City B compared to its speed on its way back is 4:3.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, since the distance is the same in both directions, we can use the formula for average speed, but in this case, we're dealing with individual speeds.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the relationship between speed and time. We know that time is inversely proportional to speed when distance is constant.\n\nSo, if the time from A to B is 3 hours and from B to A is 4 hours, then the speeds should be in the inverse ratio of the times.\n\nThat is, s1/s2 = t2/t1 = 4/3\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, let's assume a specific distance to make the calculations easier. Let's say the distance between City A and City B is 12 miles (I chose 12 because it's divisible by both 3 and 4).\n\nSo, distance d = 12 miles\n\nThen, s1 = 12 / 3 = 4 mph\n\ns2 = 12 / 4 = 3 mph\n\nTherefore, the ratio s1:s2 = 4:3\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using harmonic mean or something, but I think the approach I've taken is straightforward and accurate.\n\nSo, the ratio of the train's speed on its way to City B compared to its speed on its way back is 4:3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{3}} \\]"
