        "content": "Alright, I'm going to design a SQL schema for a basic e-commerce platform. I need to create tables for products, customers, orders, and order items. Let's think about what each of these tables should contain.\n\nFirst, the **products** table. This should have information about each product available for sale. I'll need fields like product ID, name, description, price, and maybe some inventory information.\n\nNext, the **customers** table. This will store information about the people who are buying the products. I'll need fields like customer ID, name, email, address, and possibly more contact information.\n\nThen, the **orders** table. This will record each purchase made by a customer. It should include the order ID, the customer who placed the order, the order date, and maybe the shipping address.\n\nFinally, the **order items** table. This will connect orders to the products they contain, including the quantity of each product in the order.\n\nLet me sketch out the relationships between these tables. Each order is placed by one customer, so there's a one-to-many relationship between customers and orders. Each order can have multiple order items, and each order item refers to one product. So, there's a many-to-one relationship from order items to products.\n\nI need to decide on the data types for each field. For IDs, I'll use integers and set them as primary keys. For names and descriptions, I'll use varchar. For dates, I'll use date type. For prices and quantities, I'll use decimal and integer respectively.\n\nLet me start by writing the SQL statements to create these tables.\n\nFirst, the products table:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE products (\n    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    description TEXT,\n    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,\n    stock_quantity INT NOT NULL\n);\n```\n\nNext, the customers table:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE customers (\n    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    last_name VARCHAR(100),\n    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n    phone VARCHAR(15),\n    address VARCHAR(255)\n);\n```\n\nNow, the orders table:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE orders (\n    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    customer_id INT NOT NULL,\n    order_date DATE NOT NULL,\n    shipping_address VARCHAR(255),\n    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)\n);\n```\n\nAnd finally, the order items table:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE order_items (\n    order_item_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    order_id INT NOT NULL,\n    product_id INT NOT NULL,\n    quantity INT NOT NULL,\n    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id),\n    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)\n);\n```\n\nAlright, now I need to insert some sample data into these tables.\n\nFirst, let's add some products:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO products (name, description, price, stock_quantity)\nVALUES \n('Laptop', 'High-performance laptop', 1200.00, 50),\n('Smartphone', 'Latest model smartphone', 800.00, 100),\n('Tablet', 'Portable tablet for on-the-go', 300.00, 75),\n('Headphones', 'High-quality headphones', 150.00, 200);\n```\n\nNext, add some customers:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO customers (first_name, last_name, email, phone, address)\nVALUES \n('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', '123-456-7890', '123 Main St'),\n('Jane', 'Smith', 'jane.smith@example.com', '987-654-3210', '456 Elm St');\n```\n\nNow, create some orders for these customers:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO orders (customer_id, order_date, shipping_address)\nVALUES \n(1, '2023-01-15', '123 Main St'),\n(1, '2023-01-20', '123 Main St'),\n(2, '2023-01-22', '456 Elm St');\n```\n\nAnd finally, add order items for these orders:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity)\nVALUES \n(1, 1, 2), -- Order 1: 2 Laptops\n(1, 4, 3), -- Order 1: 3 Headphones\n(2, 2, 1), -- Order 2: 1 Smartphone\n(3, 3, 2); -- Order 3: 2 Tablets\n```\n\nNow, I need to write a query to retrieve a list of all orders placed by a specific customer, along with the total cost of each order.\n\nTo do this, I need to join the orders table with the order_items table and the products table to get the price of each product in the order. Then, for each order, sum up the total cost based on the quantity and price.\n\nLet's say I want to get the orders for customer with customer_id = 1.\n\nHere's how I can write the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    o.order_id,\n    o.order_date,\n    SUM(p.price * oi.quantity) AS total_cost\nFROM \n    orders o\nJOIN \n    order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id\nJOIN \n    products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id\nWHERE \n    o.customer_id = 1\nGROUP BY \n    o.order_id, o.order_date\nORDER BY \n    o.order_date;\n```\n\nThis query joins the orders, order_items, and products tables, filters by customer_id = 1, groups the results by order_id and order_date, and calculates the total_cost for each order by summing up the product of price and quantity.\n\nThat should give me the list of orders and their total costs for the specified customer.\n\nLet me verify this with the sample data I inserted.\n\nFor customer_id = 1:\n\n- Order 1: 2 Laptops at $1200 each and 3 Headphones at $150 each.\n\nTotal cost: (2 * 1200) + (3 * 150) = 2400 + 450 = $2850\n\n- Order 2: 1 Smartphone at $800.\n\nTotal cost: 1 * 800 = $800\n\nThe query should return these two orders with their respective total costs.\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nI think that covers the requirements. I've created the necessary tables, inserted sample data, and written a query to retrieve the orders and their total costs for a specific customer.\n\n**Final SQL Schema and Queries:**\n\n```sql\n-- Create tables\nCREATE TABLE products (\n    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    description TEXT,\n    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,\n    stock_quantity INT NOT NULL\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE customers (\n    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    last_name VARCHAR(100),\n    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n    phone VARCHAR(15),\n    address VARCHAR(255)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE orders (\n    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    customer_id INT NOT NULL,\n    order_date DATE NOT NULL,\n    shipping_address VARCHAR(255),\n    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE order_items (\n    order_item_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    order_id INT NOT NULL,\n    product_id INT NOT NULL,\n    quantity INT NOT NULL,\n    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id),\n    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)\n);\n\n-- Insert sample data\nINSERT INTO products (name, description, price, stock_quantity)\nVALUES \n('Laptop', 'High-performance laptop', 1200.00, 50),\n('Smartphone', 'Latest model smartphone', 800.00, 100),\n('Tablet', 'Portable tablet for on-the-go', 300.00, 75),\n('Headphones', 'High-quality headphones', 150.00, 200);\n\nINSERT INTO customers (first_name, last_name, email, phone, address)\nVALUES \n('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', '123-456-7890', '123 Main St'),\n('Jane', 'Smith', 'jane.smith@example.com', '987-654-3210', '456 Elm St');\n\nINSERT INTO orders (customer_id, order_date, shipping_address)\nVALUES \n(1, '2023-01-15', '123 Main St'),\n(1, '2023-01-20', '123 Main St'),\n(2, '2023-01-22', '456 Elm St');\n\nINSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity)\nVALUES \n(1, 1, 2),\n(1, 4, 3),\n(2, 2, 1),\n(3, 3, 2);\n\n-- Query to retrieve orders and total cost for a specific customer\nSELECT \n    o.order_id,\n    o.order_date,\n    SUM(p.price * oi.quantity) AS total_cost\nFROM \n    orders o\nJOIN \n    order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id\nJOIN \n    products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id\nWHERE \n    o.customer_id = 1\nGROUP BY \n    o.order_id, o.order_date\nORDER BY \n    o.order_date;\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Products Table:** Stores product details including ID, name, description, price, and stock quantity.\n- **Customers Table:** Contains customer information such as ID, name, email, phone, and address.\n- **Orders Table:** Records each order with ID, customer ID, order date, and shipping address.\n- **Order Items Table:** Links orders to products, specifying the quantity of each product in an order.\n- **Sample Data Insertion:** Adds example records to each table to populate the database.\n- **Query:** Retrieves orders for a specific customer (customer_id = 1), calculating the total cost for each order by summing the product of each item's price and quantity."
