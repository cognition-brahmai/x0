        "content": "So, there were 5 friends who went out for dinner and they decided to split the bill evenly. Each one of them paid $12. To find out how much the entire meal cost, I need to calculate the total amount paid by all five friends together.\n\nSince they split the bill evenly, that means each person paid the same amount, which is $12. So, if there are 5 people, each paying $12, the total cost should be 5 times $12.\n\nLet me do the math: 5 multiplied by 12 is 60. So, the entire meal cost $60.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe there was a tip involved or something else. But according to the information given, they split the bill evenly, and each paid $12, and there were 5 people.\n\nSo, total cost is indeed $60.\n\nYeah, that seems straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
