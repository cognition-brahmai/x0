        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got 120 people in a room, and some of them are wearing glasses, some aren't. Among those who wear glasses, one-third also wear hats. Among those who don't wear glasses, one-fourth wear hats. And altogether, there are 40 people wearing hats. We need to find out how many people are wearing glasses.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( g \\) be the number of people wearing glasses.\n\n- Therefore, the number of people not wearing glasses is \\( 120 - g \\).\n\nNow, according to the problem:\n\n- One-third of those who wear glasses also wear hats. So, the number of people wearing both glasses and hats is \\( \\frac{1}{3}g \\).\n\n- One-fourth of those who don't wear glasses wear hats. So, the number of people not wearing glasses but wearing hats is \\( \\frac{1}{4}(120 - g) \\).\n\nAnd the total number of people wearing hats is 40. So, the sum of those wearing both glasses and hats and those not wearing glasses but wearing hats should equal 40. That gives us the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}g + \\frac{1}{4}(120 - g) = 40\n\\]\n\nAlright, now we need to solve for \\( g \\).\n\nFirst, let's find a common denominator for the fractions to make it easier to solve. The denominators are 3 and 4, so the least common denominator is 12.\n\nLet's multiply every term by 12 to eliminate the denominators:\n\n\\[\n12 \\times \\frac{1}{3}g + 12 \\times \\frac{1}{4}(120 - g) = 12 \\times 40\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\n\\[\n4g + 3(120 - g) = 480\n\\]\n\nNow, distribute the 3 in the second term:\n\n\\[\n4g + 360 - 3g = 480\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n(4g - 3g) + 360 = 480 \\\\\ng + 360 = 480\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract 360 from both sides:\n\n\\[\ng = 480 - 360 \\\\\ng = 120\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't make sense. If \\( g = 120 \\), that means all 120 people are wearing glasses. But the problem states that some are wearing glasses and some are not. If everyone is wearing glasses, then no one is not wearing glasses, which would mean no one not wearing glasses are wearing hats. So, the number of people wearing hats would only be those wearing glasses and hats, which is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 120 = 40 \\), which matches the total given. So, technically, this could be a solution.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's a possibility of another solution or if we've made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if there's a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me think again.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Total people: 120\n\n- Let \\( g \\) be the number wearing glasses.\n\n- Then, \\( 120 - g \\) are not wearing glasses.\n\n- Number wearing glasses and hats: \\( \\frac{1}{3}g \\)\n\n- Number not wearing glasses but wearing hats: \\( \\frac{1}{4}(120 - g) \\)\n\n- Total wearing hats: 40\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}g + \\frac{1}{4}(120 - g) = 40\n\\]\n\nLet me solve this equation again, perhaps more carefully.\n\nFirst, find a common denominator, which is 12, and multiply each term by 12:\n\n\\[\n12 \\times \\frac{1}{3}g + 12 \\times \\frac{1}{4}(120 - g) = 12 \\times 40\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n4g + 3(120 - g) = 480\n\\]\n\nDistribute the 3:\n\n\\[\n4g + 360 - 3g = 480\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\ng + 360 = 480\n\\]\n\nSubtract 360 from both sides:\n\n\\[\ng = 120\n\\]\n\nHmm, again, I get \\( g = 120 \\). But intuitively, if all 120 people are wearing glasses, and one-third of them are wearing hats, that's 40 people wearing hats, which matches the total given. So, it seems correct.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to interpret the problem. Perhaps some people are wearing both glasses and hats, some only glasses, some only hats, and some neither. But according to the problem, only those wearing glasses can wear hats, or something like that?\n\nWait, no. The problem says some wear glasses, some don't. Some who wear glasses also wear hats (one-third of those who wear glasses), and some who don't wear glasses wear hats (one-fourth of those who don't wear glasses). Total hat-wearers are 40.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that some people are wearing only hats, some are wearing both glasses and hats, and so on.\n\nLet me try setting up the equation differently.\n\nLet:\n\n- \\( g \\) = number wearing glasses\n\n- \\( n \\) = number not wearing glasses = \\( 120 - g \\)\n\n- Number wearing glasses and hats: \\( \\frac{1}{3}g \\)\n\n- Number not wearing glasses but wearing hats: \\( \\frac{1}{4}n = \\frac{1}{4}(120 - g) \\)\n\n- Total hat-wearers: \\( \\frac{1}{3}g + \\frac{1}{4}(120 - g) = 40 \\)\n\nThis is the same equation as before. Maybe I can try solving it without finding a common denominator.\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}g + \\frac{1}{4}(120 - g) = 40\n\\]\n\nLet me distribute the \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}g + \\frac{1}{4} \\times 120 - \\frac{1}{4}g = 40 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{3}g + 30 - \\frac{1}{4}g = 40\n\\]\n\nNow, combine the \\( g \\) terms:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) g + 30 = 40\n\\]\n\nFind a common denominator for the coefficients of \\( g \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{4}{12} - \\frac{3}{12} \\right) g + 30 = 40 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{12}g + 30 = 40\n\\]\n\nSubtract 30 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{12}g = 10\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 12:\n\n\\[\ng = 120\n\\]\n\nAgain, I get \\( g = 120 \\). So, it seems that all 120 people are wearing glasses, and among them, one-third, which is 40, are wearing hats. Additionally, there are no people not wearing glasses, so no one not wearing glasses is wearing hats. Thus, the total number of hat-wearers is indeed 40, which matches the given total.\n\nTherefore, the number of people wearing glasses is 120.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's a mistake in the interpretation. Perhaps the problem allows for people not wearing glasses to also wear hats, but in this scenario, since \\( g = 120 \\), \\( n = 0 \\), which makes \\( \\frac{1}{4}n = 0 \\), which is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem intended that some people are not wearing glasses, but this solution still holds mathematically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to verify this.\n\nLet me try plugging in \\( g = 120 \\) back into the original conditions to verify.\n\n- Number wearing glasses: 120\n\n- Number not wearing glasses: 0\n\n- Number wearing glasses and hats: \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 120 = 40 \\)\n\n- Number not wearing glasses but wearing hats: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 0 = 0 \\)\n\n- Total hat-wearers: 40 + 0 = 40, which matches the given total.\n\nSo, it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another solution if we consider that some people are wearing both glasses and hats, but in this case, it seems that \\( g = 120 \\) is the only solution that satisfies the equation.\n\nTherefore, the number of people wearing glasses is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
