For each step in your plan, specify which external tool will be used along with its input to gather evidence. The gathered evidence can be stored into a variable #E[index] that can be referenced by subsequent tools.\n\nHere are the available tools:\nBing[input]: A tool that allows you to search for information using the Bing search engine. This tool is useful for finding a list of sites that may contain the answer to your question. However, it doesn't directly provide an answer; instead, it provides a list of sites that might have the answer.\nWebScraper[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline-delimited links. The input should be one or more links and produces plain text output containing the content of these links.\nLinkExtractor[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline-delimited response of links.\nQAModel[input]: Question answering model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a #E[n] variable, e.g., What color is the cat, given #E1?\n\nEach plan should be followed by exactly one evidence (#E[index]) value.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n#E1 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of #E1]\n#E2 = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context #E1\"]\n...\nFinal answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: Who was the first person to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen and what book did they write about their experience?"

        "content": "Alright, I've got this question to answer: \"Who was the first person to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen, and what book did they write about their experience?\" Okay, let's break this down. There are two parts here: identifying the first person to climb Everest without oxygen and finding out what book they wrote about it.\n\nFirst, I need to find out who that person was. I'm not sure off the top of my head, so I'll have to look it up. I think using a search engine would be the way to go for this. Bing seems like a good tool for searching the web. So, I'll use Bing to search for \"first person to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen.\"\n\nOnce I have the name of that person, I'll need to find out what book they wrote about their experience. So, probably, after getting the name, I can search for something like \"[person's name] book about climbing Everest without oxygen.\" Alternatively, I might be able to find this information on their Wikipedia page or on other biographical websites.\n\nLet me think about the steps in order:\n\n1. Use Bing to search for \"first person to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen\" to find out who that person was.\n\n2. Once I have the name, use that name to search for any books they wrote about their Everest climb. Maybe use Bing again with a query like \"[name] book Everest oxygen.\"\n\n3. If necessary, I can look at multiple sources to confirm the information and make sure I'm getting accurate details.\n\n4. Finally, compile the name of the person and the title of the book as the answer.\n\nI should also consider that there might be different categories or types of climbs, so I need to make sure that the person is indeed the first to climb Everest without supplemental oxygen, not just attempting it or reaching a certain height.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that there might be debates or controversies around who was truly the first, so I should look for reliable sources that confirm the achievement.\n\nAlright, let's proceed with the first step.\n\nPlan: Search for the first person to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen.\n\n#E1 = Bing[\"first person to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen\"]\n\nPlan: Extract relevant information from the search results to determine the name of the climber.\n\n#E2 = LinkExtractor[#E1]\n\nPlan: Scrape the content from the extracted links to gather more detailed information.\n\n#E3 = WebScraper[#E2]\n\nPlan: Use the question-answering model to identify the name of the climber from the scraped content.\n\n#E4 = QAModel[\"Who was the first person to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen? Given context: #E3\"]\n\nNow that I have the name of the climber, I need to find out what book they wrote about their experience.\n\nPlan: Search for books written by the identified climber about their Everest climb without oxygen.\n\n#E5 = Bing[\"[name from #E4] book about climbing Everest without oxygen\"]\n\nPlan: Extract relevant links from the search results that might contain information about the book.\n\n#E6 = LinkExtractor[#E5]\n\nPlan: Scrape the content from these links to find the title of the book.\n\n#E7 = WebScraper[#E6]\n\nPlan: Use the question-answering model to extract the title of the book from the scraped content.\n\n#E8 = QAModel[\"What is the name of the book written by [name from #E4] about climbing Everest without oxygen? Given context: #E7\"]\n\nFinally, compile the name of the climber and the title of the book as the answer.\n\nFinal answer: #E4 and #E8"
