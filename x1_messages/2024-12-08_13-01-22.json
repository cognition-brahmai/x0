        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We're given some ratios and a specific number of oranges, and we need to find the total number of fruits in the store. The ratios given are:\n\n- Apples to oranges: 2:3\n\n- Oranges to bananas: 5:6\n\nAnd we're told there are 60 oranges.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these ratios mean. The apples to oranges ratio of 2:3 means that for every 2 apples, there are 3 oranges. Similarly, the oranges to bananas ratio of 5:6 means that for every 5 oranges, there are 6 bananas.\n\nBut here's the thing: we have two different ratios involving oranges. In the first ratio, oranges are represented as 3 parts, and in the second ratio, they're represented as 5 parts. To combine these ratios, I need to make the number of parts for oranges the same in both ratios.\n\nSo, I need to find a common multiple for the oranges in both ratios. The first ratio has oranges as 3 parts, and the second as 5 parts. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5 is 15. That means I can adjust both ratios so that oranges are represented as 15 parts in each.\n\nLet's adjust the apples to oranges ratio first. It's currently 2:3. To make oranges 15 parts, I can multiply both sides of the ratio by 5:\n\nApples : Oranges = 2*5 : 3*5 = 10:15\n\nNow, the oranges are 15 parts.\n\nNext, the oranges to bananas ratio is 5:6. To make oranges 15 parts, I can multiply both sides of this ratio by 3:\n\nOranges : Bananas = 5*3 : 6*3 = 15:18\n\nNow, oranges are 15 parts in this ratio as well.\n\nNow that both ratios have oranges represented as 15 parts, I can combine them into a single ratio that includes apples, oranges, and bananas.\n\nFrom the adjusted ratios:\n\n- Apples : Oranges = 10:15\n\n- Oranges : Bananas = 15:18\n\nSince oranges are common in both, I can combine them directly:\n\nApples : Oranges : Bananas = 10:15:18\n\nThis combined ratio tells us that for every 10 apples, there are 15 oranges and 18 bananas.\n\nNow, we know that the store has 60 oranges. According to the ratio, the number of oranges is 15 parts. So, we can set up a proportion to find out how many fruits correspond to one part, and then find the total number of fruits.\n\nLet's denote one part as x. Then:\n\nOranges = 15x = 60\n\nSo, x = 60 / 15 = 4\n\nNow that we know one part is equal to 4, we can find the number of apples and bananas.\n\nApples = 10x = 10 * 4 = 40\n\nBananas = 18x = 18 * 4 = 72\n\nNow, to find the total number of fruits, we add up apples, oranges, and bananas:\n\nTotal fruits = Apples + Oranges + Bananas = 40 + 60 + 72\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n40 + 60 = 100\n\n100 + 72 = 172\n\nSo, the store has 172 pieces of fruit in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the ratios:\n\nApples : Oranges = 2:3\n\nOranges : Bananas = 5:6\n\nI adjusted them to have a common term for oranges:\n\nApples : Oranges = 10:15\n\nOranges : Bananas = 15:18\n\nCombined ratio: Apples : Oranges : Bananas = 10:15:18\n\nGiven that oranges = 60, and in the ratio, oranges are 15 parts, so one part is 4.\n\nThen:\n\nApples = 10 * 4 = 40\n\nBananas = 18 * 4 = 72\n\nTotal = 40 + 60 + 72 = 172\n\nSeems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of proportion directly.\n\nGiven that apples : oranges = 2:3, and oranges = 60, I can find the number of apples.\n\nApples / Oranges = 2 / 3\n\nApples = (2 / 3) * Oranges = (2 / 3) * 60 = 40\n\nSimilarly, oranges : bananas = 5:6, and oranges = 60, I can find the number of bananas.\n\nOranges / Bananas = 5 / 6\n\nBananas = (6 / 5) * Oranges = (6 / 5) * 60 = 72\n\nThen total fruits = apples + oranges + bananas = 40 + 60 + 72 = 172\n\nSame answer as before. So, it seems consistent.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using the concept of least common multiple was unnecessary, but it helped me combine the ratios neatly. Alternatively, I could have treated the ratios as fractions and found a common term that way, but I think the method I used is straightforward and less error-prone for me.\n\nAnother thought: I should ensure that the ratios are being interpreted correctly. The ratio of apples to oranges is 2:3, which means for every 2 apples, there are 3 oranges. Similarly, oranges to bananas is 5:6, meaning for every 5 oranges, there are 6 bananas.\n\nWhen combining these, I need to make sure that the number of oranges in both ratios is consistent. That's why I adjusted them to have the same number of parts for oranges, which was 15.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up equations based on the ratios.\n\nLet A be the number of apples, O be the number of oranges, and B be the number of bananas.\n\nGiven:\n\nA / O = 2 / 3\n\nO / B = 5 / 6\n\nAnd O = 60\n\nUsing the first equation:\n\nA = (2 / 3) * O = (2 / 3) * 60 = 40\n\nUsing the second equation:\n\nB = (6 / 5) * O = (6 / 5) * 60 = 72\n\nThen total fruits = A + O + B = 40 + 60 + 72 = 172\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think it's clear now that the total number of fruits is 172.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{172} \\]"
