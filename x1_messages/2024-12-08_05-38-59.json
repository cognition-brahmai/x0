        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. Here's a simple Golang program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc factorial(n int) int {\n\tif n == 0 {\n\t\treturn 1\n\t}\n\treturn n * factorial(n-1)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tvar num int\n\tfmt.Print(\"Enter a number to calculate its factorial: \")\n\tfmt.Scan(&num)\n\tresult := factorial(num)\n\tfmt.Printf(\"The factorial of %d is %d\\n\", num, result)\n}\n```\n\nTo run this program, you'll need to have Go installed on your system. Save the code to a file with a `.go` extension, for example, `factorial.go`, and then run it using the Go command:\n\n```sh\ngo run factorial.go\n```\n\nThe program will prompt you to enter a number, and it will display the factorial of that number using recursive function calls.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Function Definition:**\n   - `factorial(n int) int`: This is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given integer `n`.\n   - **Base Case:** If `n` is 0, the factorial is 1.\n   - **Recursive Case:** The function calls itself with `n-1` and multiplies the result by `n`.\n\n2. **Main Function:**\n   - Prompts the user to enter a number.\n   - Reads the input number.\n   - Calls the `factorial` function with the input number.\n   - Prints the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that the factorial is calculated efficiently using recursion, and the program is straightforward and easy to understand."
