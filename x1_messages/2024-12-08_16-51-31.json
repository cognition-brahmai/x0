        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. So, in total, there are 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 balls in the bag.\n\nThe question is about finding the probability of drawing a red ball followed by a blue ball without replacement. That means once we draw the first ball, we don't put it back into the bag before drawing the second one.\n\nOkay, so probability of drawing a red ball first. There are 5 red balls out of 10 total balls, so the probability for that is 5/10, which simplifies to 1/2.\n\nNow, after drawing a red ball, there are now 9 balls left in the bag because we didn't replace it. The number of blue balls is still 3.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a blue ball next is 3 out of 9, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nTo find the overall probability of both events happening in sequence\u2014first drawing a red ball and then a blue ball\u2014we need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, that would be (1/2) * (1/3) = 1/6.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should consider the total number of ways this can happen.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of combinations. The total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 10 without replacement is 10 choose 2, which is (10*9)/2 = 45.\n\nThe number of ways to draw a red ball first and then a blue ball would be the number of red balls times the number of blue balls, which is 5 * 3 = 15.\n\nSo, the probability would be 15/45, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nHmm, that's different from what I got earlier. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the first method. Let me think again.\n\nIn the first method, I considered the probability of drawing a red ball first (5/10) and then a blue ball (3/9), and multiplied them to get 1/2 * 1/3 = 1/6.\n\nBut according to the second method using combinations, it's 15/45 = 1/3.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here. Which approach should I trust?\n\nLet me see. Oh, I think I see the problem. In the combination approach, 15/45 represents the probability of drawing one red and one blue ball in any order, not specifically red first and then blue.\n\nBecause with combinations, the order doesn't matter, so it includes both red then blue and blue then red.\n\nBut in the problem, the order matters: red first, then blue.\n\nSo, to get the probability of red then blue specifically, I need to consider the ordered pairs.\n\nIn that case, the number of favorable outcomes is indeed 5 (red) * 3 (blue) = 15.\n\nThe total number of possible ordered pairs without replacement is 10 * 9 = 90.\n\nSo, the probability is 15/90, which simplifies to 1/6.\n\nAh, that makes sense now. So, the combination approach I used earlier didn't account for the order, which is why it was giving a different result.\n\nTherefore, the correct probability is 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, I can stick with the initial approach of multiplying the individual probabilities: 5/10 * 3/9 = 15/90 = 1/6.\n\nSo, both methods agree now.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about it another way.\n\nLet's consider the total probability of drawing red first and blue second.\n\nProbability of first ball being red is 5/10.\n\nGiven that the first ball is red, the probability of the second ball being blue is 3/9.\n\nSo, the joint probability is (5/10) * (3/9) = 15/90 = 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the positions:\n\nThe probability that the first ball is red and the second is blue.\n\nSo, yes, it's consistent.\n\nI think 1/6 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{6}} \\]"
