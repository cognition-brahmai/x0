Each plan should correspond to an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the functions when given an input string.\n\nHere are the tools you can use:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: A tool that enables users to perform searches using DuckDuckGo's search engine. It finds potential sources of answers but doesn't directly answer the question.\nPageScraper[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline-delimited links. The input is one or more links, and the output is plain text containing the content of the links.\nURLExtractor[input]: Extracts URLs from plain text and outputs a plain text, newline-delimited response of URLs.\nQueryMaster[input]: A question-answering language model that answers questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., How tall is the Eiffel Tower, given :evidence1:?\n\nRemember, each function needs just a plain string as input, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., QueryMaster[What is the capital of Spain, given :evidence3:?]\n\nMake sure to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should follow this format:\nPlan: [First action based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2019 and what is their most famous work?"
