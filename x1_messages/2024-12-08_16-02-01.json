        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that normally cranks out 1000 widgets per hour, but there's a malfunction that causes the production rate to drop by 10% each hour. We need to find out how many widgets are produced in total over 3 hours.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening each hour. In the first hour, production is normal at 1000 widgets. But in the second hour, production decreases by 10% compared to the first hour. Then in the third hour, it decreases by another 10% from the second hour's production.\n\nSo, let's break it down hour by hour.\n\n**Hour 1:**\n\nProduction rate: 1000 widgets per hour\n\nTotal widgets produced in hour 1: 1000\n\n**Hour 2:**\n\nProduction rate decreases by 10% from hour 1.\n\nDecrease = 10% of 1000 = 0.10 * 1000 = 100 widgets\n\nSo, production rate in hour 2: 1000 - 100 = 900 widgets per hour\n\nTotal widgets produced in hour 2: 900\n\n**Hour 3:**\n\nProduction rate decreases by 10% from hour 2.\n\nDecrease = 10% of 900 = 0.10 * 900 = 90 widgets\n\nSo, production rate in hour 3: 900 - 90 = 810 widgets per hour\n\nTotal widgets produced in hour 3: 810\n\nNow, to find the total production over 3 hours, I just need to add up the widgets produced each hour.\n\nTotal widgets = Hour 1 + Hour 2 + Hour 3 = 1000 + 900 + 810\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n1000 + 900 = 1900\n\n1900 + 810 = 2710\n\nSo, the total number of widgets produced after 3 hours is 2710.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a better way to approach this problem, especially since the production rate is decreasing by 10% each hour. This sounds like a geometric sequence, where each term is a constant multiple of the previous one.\n\nIn a geometric sequence, each term is multiplied by a common ratio. In this case, the production rate each hour is 90% (or 0.9 times) the previous hour's production rate because it decreases by 10% each hour.\n\nSo, the production in hour 1: 1000\n\nHour 2: 1000 * 0.9 = 900\n\nHour 3: 900 * 0.9 = 810\n\nThat matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, to find the total production over 3 hours, I can sum these terms:\n\nTotal = 1000 + 900 + 810 = 2710\n\nAlternatively, since it's a geometric series, I could use the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence:\n\nSum = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nWhere:\n\n- a is the first term (1000)\n\n- r is the common ratio (0.9)\n\n- n is the number of terms (3)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nSum = 1000 * (1 - 0.9^3) / (1 - 0.9)\n\nFirst, calculate 0.9^3:\n\n0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.729\n\nSo,\n\nSum = 1000 * (1 - 0.729) / 0.1\n\n= 1000 * (0.271) / 0.1\n\n= 1000 * 2.71\n\n= 2710\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the total number of widgets produced after 3 hours is 2710.\n\nBut let me think if there's any other way to look at this. Maybe using percentages or some other method, but I think the approach I've taken is straightforward and accurate.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly verify the production for each hour again.\n\n**Hour 1:**\n\n1000 widgets\n\n**Hour 2:**\n\n1000 - (10% of 1000) = 1000 - 100 = 900 widgets\n\n**Hour 3:**\n\n900 - (10% of 900) = 900 - 90 = 810 widgets\n\nTotal: 1000 + 900 + 810 = 2710\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nI think 2710 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2710} \\]"
