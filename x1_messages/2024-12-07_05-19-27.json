Growing up, I was surrounded by telescopes, star charts, and endless discussions about the cosmos. My family's passion for understanding the universe was infectious, and I found myself drawn to the mysteries of the night sky.\n\nHowever, I found myself intrigued not just by the scientific aspect of these celestial bodies, but also by the stories and meanings that have been ascribed to them throughout history. Astrology, with its blend of mythology, symbolism, and interpretation, offered a different perspective on the stars and planets that I found equally compelling.\n\nMy family's background in astronomy provided me with a solid foundation of knowledge about the physical universe, while my interest in astrology allowed me to explore the more mystical and symbolic aspects of the cosmos. The two fields may seem disparate to some, but to me, they are two sides of the same coin, each offering a unique lens through which to view and understand the universe.\nChristopher: Can you share an instance where your astrological predictions had a significant impact on someone's life?"
