        "content": "So I have this problem here about marbles in a jar. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly. \"You have a jar containing black and white marbles. If you randomly pick a marble, the probability of getting a black marble is 1/3. If there are 30 marbles in total, how many black marbles are there? Provide step-by-step logic.\"\n\nAlright, so first things first, I need to find out how many black marbles are in the jar. I know that the total number of marbles is 30, and the probability of picking a black marble is 1/3. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and in this case, it's the chance of picking a black marble.\n\nI remember that probability is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. In this scenario, the favorable outcome is picking a black marble, and the total outcomes are the total number of marbles.\n\nSo, if I let B represent the number of black marbles, then the probability of picking a black marble is B divided by the total number of marbles, which is 30. So, P(black) = B / 30.\n\nAccording to the problem, this probability is equal to 1/3. So, I can set up the equation:\n\nB / 30 = 1 / 3\n\nNow, I need to solve for B. To do that, I can cross-multiply. So, B times 3 equals 1 times 30.\n\nThat gives me:\n\n3B = 30\n\nNext, I'll divide both sides by 3 to solve for B:\n\nB = 30 / 3\n\nB = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 black marbles in the jar.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If there are 10 black marbles out of 30 total marbles, then the probability of picking a black marble is 10/30, which simplifies to 1/3. Yeah, that matches the given probability.\n\nAlso, just to be thorough, if there are 10 black marbles, then the number of white marbles would be the total marbles minus the black marbles, which is 30 - 10 = 20 white marbles.\n\nSo, to summarize, in a jar of 30 marbles where the probability of picking a black marble is 1/3, there are 10 black marbles and 20 white marbles.\n\nI think that makes sense."
