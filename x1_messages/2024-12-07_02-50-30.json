        "content": "Alright, let's dive into creating a simple RESTful API for managing books using Node.js and Express. Since you've specified to store the books in memory without an external database, we'll keep the book data in an array.\n\nFirst things first, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Once you have Node.js set up, you can initialize a new project and install the necessary dependencies.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Project\n\nCreate a new directory for your project and navigate into it:\n\n```bash\nmkdir book-api\ncd book-api\n```\n\nInitialize a new Node.js project:\n\n```bash\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nThis command creates a `package.json` file with default settings.\n\n### Step 2: Install Dependencies\n\nYou'll need Express for setting up the API routes. Install it using npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install express\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create the Server\n\nCreate a new file called `server.js` and set up a basic Express server:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.use(express.json());\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nThis code sets up an Express app and listens on port 3000. We're also using `express.json()` to parse JSON request bodies.\n\n### Step 4: Define the Book Model\n\nSince we're not using a database, we'll store books in an array. Each book will have a title, author, and publication year. To make it simple, we'll also assign a unique ID to each book.\n\nAdd the following code to `server.js`:\n\n```javascript\nlet books = [];\nlet idCounter = 1;\n\nfunction createBook(title, author, publicationYear) {\n  const book = {\n    id: idCounter++,\n    title,\n    author,\n    publicationYear\n  };\n  books.push(book);\n  return book;\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Implement CRUD Operations\n\nNow, let's implement the CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.\n\n#### Create a Book (POST /books)\n\n```javascript\napp.post('/books', (req, res) => {\n  const { title, author, publicationYear } = req.body;\n  if (!title || !author || !publicationYear) {\n    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing required fields' });\n  }\n  const newBook = createBook(title, author, publicationYear);\n  res.status(201).json(newBook);\n});\n```\n\n#### Get All Books (GET /books)\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/books', (req, res) => {\n  res.json(books);\n});\n```\n\n#### Get a Single Book by ID (GET /books/:id)\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const bookId = parseInt(req.params.id);\n  const book = books.find(b => b.id === bookId);\n  if (!book) {\n    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Book not found' });\n  }\n  res.json(book);\n});\n```\n\n#### Update a Book (PUT /books/:id)\n\n```javascript\napp.put('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const bookId = parseInt(req.params.id);\n  const index = books.findIndex(b => b.id === bookId);\n  if (index === -1) {\n    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Book not found' });\n  }\n  const { title, author, publicationYear } = req.body;\n  if (!title || !author || !publicationYear) {\n    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing required fields' });\n  }\n  books[index] = { ...books[index], title, author, publicationYear };\n  res.json(books[index]);\n});\n```\n\n#### Delete a Book (DELETE /books/:id)\n\n```javascript\napp.delete('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const bookId = parseInt(req.params.id);\n  const index = books.findIndex(b => b.id === bookId);\n  if (index === -1) {\n    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Book not found' });\n  }\n  const deletedBook = books.splice(index, 1);\n  res.json(deletedBook[0]);\n});\n```\n\n### Step 6: Test the API\n\nYou can test the API using tools like Postman or curl. Here are some example commands:\n\n#### Create a Book\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:3000/books -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"title\":\"Sample Book\",\"author\":\"John Doe\",\"publicationYear\":2020}'\n```\n\n#### Get All Books\n\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:3000/books\n```\n\n#### Get a Single Book by ID\n\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:3000/books/1\n```\n\n#### Update a Book\n\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/books/1 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"title\":\"Updated Book\",\"author\":\"Jane Doe\",\"publicationYear\":2021}'\n```\n\n#### Delete a Book\n\n```bash\ncurl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/books/1\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nYou've successfully created a simple RESTful API for managing books using Node.js and Express, storing data in memory. This API supports CRUD operations and can be extended with more features as needed. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
