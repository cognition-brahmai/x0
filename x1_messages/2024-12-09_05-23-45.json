Here are three strange facts about classic movies, along with the circumstances surrounding each and their relevance to the films:\n\n1. **\"Ben-Hur\" (1959): The Costly Chariot Race**\n\n   - **Fact:** The famous chariot race scene in \"Ben-Hur\" cost an estimated $1.5 million to produce, which was a staggering amount for its time. Adjusted for inflation, that's over $13 million today.\n\n   - **Circumstances:** The scene was meticulously planned and involved hundreds of extras, real chariots, and live horses. It took weeks to film and required extensive safety measures due to the high risk involved.\n\n   - **Relevance:** This scene is often cited as one of the greatest in cinema history. Its grandeur and spectacle helped establish \"Ben-Hur\" as a landmark in epic filmmaking, winning multiple Oscars, including Best Picture.\n\n2. **\"Psycho\" (1960): The Shower Scene's Sound Effects**\n\n   - **Fact:** In the infamous shower scene from \"Psycho,\" the sound of the knife stabbing is not what you think it is. The iconic screeching sound was actually created by dragging a knife across a piece of corrugated cardboard.\n\n   - **Circumstances:** Director Alfred Hitchcock was innovative in his use of sound to enhance the horror. He and sound designer Bernard Herrmann worked together to create a soundscape that would heighten the audience's fear without relying on graphic visuals.\n\n   - **Relevance:** This creative approach to sound design has had a lasting impact on horror movies. The shower scene is considered a masterclass in how to build tension and terror through sound and editing, rather than explicit violence.\n\n3. **\"Gone with the Wind\" (1939): The Misplaced Accent**\n\n   - **Fact:** Clark Gable, who played Rhett Butler, was directed to speak with a southern accent, despite being from Pennsylvania. However, Gable refused to adopt a strong southern drawl, feeling it would make his character less believable.\n\n   - **Circumstances:** The producers were insistent on authenticity, but Gable's natural speaking voice was too ingrained for him to convincingly do a full southern accent. As a compromise, he used a mild southern inflection.\n\n   - **Relevance:** This decision had a significant impact on the film's reception. Some critics and audiences felt that Gable's accent was inconsistent with the character's background, but overall, his performance was widely acclaimed and remains one of his most iconic roles.\n\nThese facts not only provide interesting tidbits about these classic films but also offer insights into the filmmaking processes and the creative choices that shaped cinematic history."
