        "content": "To determine the number of ways to form a committee of 3 people from a group of 10, we can use the concept of combinations. Combinations are used when the order of selection does not matter, which is the case here since the committee is just a group of people without any specific roles or ordering.\n\nThe formula for combinations is given by:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items,\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose,\n\n- \\( n! \\) denotes the factorial of \\( n \\), which is the product of all positive integers up to \\( n \\).\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- \\( n = 10 \\) (the total number of people),\n\n- \\( k = 3 \\) (the number of people to choose for the committee).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 3) = \\frac{10!}{3!(10 - 3)!} = \\frac{10!}{3! \\cdot 7!}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's compute the factorials:\n\n- \\( 10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\),\n\n- \\( 7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\),\n\n- \\( 3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\).\n\nHowever, calculating \\( 10! \\) fully is unnecessary because many terms will cancel out. Notice that \\( 10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7! \\), so:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 3) = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7!}{3! \\times 7!}\n\\]\n\nThe \\( 7! \\) terms cancel out:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 3) = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{6}\n\\]\n\nNow, compute the numerator and the denominator:\n\n- Numerator: \\( 10 \\times 9 = 90 \\), then \\( 90 \\times 8 = 720 \\),\n\n- Denominator: \\( 3! = 6 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nC(10, 3) = \\frac{720}{6} = 120\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 120 different ways to form a committee of 3 people from a group of 10.\n\n**Alternative Approach Using Pascal's Triangle:**\n\nAnother way to find combinations is by using Pascal's Triangle. Each row in Pascal's Triangle corresponds to the coefficients of the binomial expansion and also represents the combinations \\( C(n, k) \\) for that row \\( n \\).\n\nFor \\( n = 10 \\), the row is:\n\n1, 10, 45, 120, 210, 252, 210, 120, 45, 10, 1\n\nThe \\( k \\)-th entry (starting from \\( k = 0 \\)) corresponds to \\( C(10, k) \\). For \\( k = 3 \\), the entry is 120, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe number of ways to form a committee of 3 people from a group of 10 is \\boxed{120}."
