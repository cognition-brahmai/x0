        "content": "In biomedical engineering, imaging techniques play a crucial role in visualizing the internal structures of the body for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Among the options provided, let's evaluate each one to determine which is primarily used for imaging internal structures.\n\nA. **Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG)**: This technique is used to record the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time using electrodes placed on the skin. It is\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u6d4b\u5fc3\u810f\u7684\u7535\u751f\u7406\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6210\u50cf\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\n\nB. **Ultrasonography (Ultrasound)**: This is a diagnostic imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of structures inside the body. It is widely used in biomedical engineering for visualizing organs, blood vessels, and other internal structures in real-time.\n\nC. **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**: MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to generate detailed images of the internal structures of the body. It is particularly useful for imaging soft tissues, such as the brain, muscles, and organs.\n\nD. **Spirometry**: This is a pulmonary function test used to assess how well the lungs are functioning, specifically measuring the amount (volume) and/or speed (flow) of air that can be inhaled and exhaled. It does not provide imaging of internal structures.\n\nGiven these descriptions, both ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging are techniques used for imaging internal structures of the body. However, the question seems to ask for a common technique, and both are indeed common in biomedical engineering.\n\nBut if I have to choose the most common or the one that is most broadly applied across various fields in biomedical engineering, I would consider ultrasonography (ultrasound) to be particularly prominent due to its versatility, real-time imaging capabilities, and lack of ionizing radiation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Ultrasonography.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
