        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to find the integral of the function g(x) = 6x^3 - 4x + 1 with respect to x. Now, I know that integration is basically the reverse process of differentiation, and it's used to find areas under curves and stuff like that. But let's focus on how to actually compute this integral step by step.\n\nFirst off, the function is a polynomial, which makes things a bit easier because integrals of polynomials are straightforward once you know the power rule for integration. The power rule basically says that the integral of x^n is (x^{n+1})/(n+1), where n is any real number except -1. So, I can apply this rule to each term in the polynomial separately.\n\nLet's break it down term by term.\n\nThe first term is 6x^3. So, applying the power rule:\n\nIntegral of 6x^3 is 6 * (x^{3+1})/(3+1) = 6 * (x^4)/4 = (6/4) x^4 = (3/2) x^4.\n\nWait, but I can simplify 6/4 to 3/2, so that's fine.\n\nNext term is -4x. Applying the power rule again:\n\nIntegral of -4x is -4 * (x^{1+1})/(1+1) = -4 * (x^2)/2 = -4/2 x^2 = -2x^2.\n\nAlright, that's straightforward.\n\nLastly, the constant term 1. The integral of a constant is just the constant times x, because the derivative of x is 1. So:\n\nIntegral of 1 is 1 * x = x.\n\nPutting it all together, the integral of g(x) should be:\n\n(3/2)x^4 - 2x^2 + x + C,\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration. We always include C because the derivative of any constant is zero, so multiple functions differing by a constant will have the same derivative.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 6x^3:\n\nIntegral of x^3 is x^4/4, multiplied by 6 gives 6/4 x^4, which simplifies to 3/2 x^4. That seems correct.\n\nNext, -4x:\n\nIntegral of x is x^2/2, multiplied by -4 gives -4/2 x^2, which is -2x^2. Good.\n\nThen, the constant 1:\n\nIntegral is x. No issues there.\n\nAnd finally, add the constant of integration C. That's all set.\n\nSo, the final answer should be:\n\n\u222b(6x^3 - 4x + 1) dx = (3/2)x^4 - 2x^2 + x + C.\n\nI think that's the correct integral of the given function. If I were to differentiate this result, I should get back the original function g(x), which would be a good way to check my work.\n\nLet's quickly differentiate (3/2)x^4 - 2x^2 + x + C:\n\nThe derivative of (3/2)x^4 is (3/2)*4x^3 = 6x^3.\n\nThe derivative of -2x^2 is -2*2x = -4x.\n\nThe derivative of x is 1.\n\nThe derivative of C is 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 6x^3 - 4x + 1, which matches the original function. Perfect, that confirms my integral is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there are any special cases or considerations I might have missed. For example, are there any discontinuities or intervals where the function behaves differently? In this case, g(x) is a polynomial, which is defined and continuous everywhere, so no need to worry about that.\n\nAlso, since the problem didn't specify any limits of integration, I've computed the indefinite integral, which is what's required.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. The integral is (3/2)x^4 - 2x^2 + x + C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{2}x^{4} - 2x^{2} + x + C} \\]"
