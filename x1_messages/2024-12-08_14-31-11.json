So, the edit distance, also known as Levenshtein distance, measures the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one word into another.\n\nTo calculate this using dynamic programming, we'll use a 2D array to store the distances between all prefixes of the two strings. This approach is efficient and ensures we don't repeat calculations for the same substrings.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:\n\n1. **Initialization:** Create a matrix with dimensions (len(s1) + 1) x (len(s2) + 1). The first row and the first column represent the prefixes of the strings, including the empty string.\n\n2. **Base Cases:** The distance between any string and an empty string is the length of the string. So, matrix[i][0] = i and matrix[0][j] = j.\n\n3. **Filling the Matrix:** For each character in s1 and s2, if the characters are the same, the cost is 0; otherwise, the cost is 1. The value at matrix[i][j] is the minimum of:\n   - matrix[i-1][j] + 1 (deletion)\n   - matrix[i][j-1] + 1 (insertion)\n   - matrix[i-1][j-1] + cost (substitution)\n\n4. **Result:** The value at matrix[len(s1)][len(s2)] is the edit distance.\n\nNow, let's translate this into Python code.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo calculate the edit distance between two strings using dynamic programming, we can use the Wagner-Fisher algorithm. This algorithm computes the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into another.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Create a 2D matrix where the element at the i-th row and j-th column represents the edit distance between the first i characters of the first string and the first j characters of the second string.\n2. **Base Cases**: The distance between any string and an empty string is the length of the string. Hence, the first row and the first column of the matrix are initialized to represent the edit distances from the empty string.\n3. **Filling the Matrix**: For each character in both strings, compute the cost of substitution (0 if characters are the same, 1 otherwise). Then, compute the edit distance by taking the minimum of:\n   - The distance from the previous row plus one (representing deletion),\n   - The distance from the previous column plus one (representing insertion),\n   - The distance from the diagonal plus the substitution cost (representing substitution).\n4. **Result**: The edit distance between the two strings is found at the bottom-right corner of the matrix.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef edit_distance(s1, s2):\n    m = len(s1)\n    n = len(s2)\n    \n    # Create a matrix to store distances\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n    \n    # Initialize base cases\n    for i in range(m + 1):\n        dp[i][0] = i\n    for j in range(n + 1):\n        dp[0][j] = j\n    \n    # Fill the matrix\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            # Cost is 0 if characters are the same, 1 otherwise\n            cost = 0 if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1] else 1\n            dp[i][j] = min(\n                dp[i - 1][j] + 1,     # Deletion\n                dp[i][j - 1] + 1,     # Insertion\n                dp[i - 1][j - 1] + cost  # Substitution\n            )\n    \n    return dp[m][n]\n\n# Example usage\nstr1 = \"kitten\"\nstr2 = \"sitting\"\nprint(\"Edit distance is:\", edit_distance(str1, str2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: A matrix `dp` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)` is created, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `s1` and `s2` respectively.\n- **Base Cases**: The first row and column are initialized to represent the transformation from an empty string to the corresponding prefix of the other string.\n- **Filling the Matrix**: For each character in `s1` and `s2`, the cost of substitution is determined, and the edit distance is computed based on the minimum of deletion, insertion, and substitution operations.\n- **Result**: The value in `dp[m][n]` gives the edit distance between `s1` and `s2`."
