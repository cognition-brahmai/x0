        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a person who drinks an average of 8 glasses of water per day. Each glass contains 8 ounces of water. We need to find out how many gallons of water this person drinks in a month, assuming there are 30 days in the month.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the units involved here. We have glasses, ounces, and gallons, and we're dealing with days and months. So, I should probably start by figuring out how much water the person drinks in ounces per day, then maybe find out the monthly consumption in ounces, and finally convert that to gallons.\n\nLet's begin with the daily consumption. The person drinks 8 glasses per day, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, the total ounces per day would be:\n\n8 glasses/day \u00d7 8 ounces/glass = 64 ounces/day\n\nAlright, so they drink 64 ounces of water every day.\n\nNow, to find out the monthly consumption, I need to multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in the month. Assuming there are 30 days in the month:\n\n64 ounces/day \u00d7 30 days = 1920 ounces/month\n\nSo, the person drinks 1920 ounces of water in a month.\n\nBut the question asks for the amount in gallons, not ounces. I need to convert ounces to gallons. I remember that there are 128 ounces in a gallon. So, to find out how many gallons are in 1920 ounces, I can divide the total ounces by the number of ounces in a gallon:\n\n1920 ounces \u00f7 128 ounces/gallon = 15 gallons\n\nTherefore, the person drinks 15 gallons of water in a month.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to find out how many gallons the person drinks per day and then multiply by the number of days in the month.\n\nFirst, find the daily consumption in gallons.\n\nWe have 8 glasses/day, each glass is 8 ounces, so 64 ounces/day, as before.\n\nNow, convert that to gallons:\n\n64 ounces \u00f7 128 ounces/gallon = 0.5 gallons/day\n\nThen, for 30 days:\n\n0.5 gallons/day \u00d7 30 days = 15 gallons/month\n\nOkay, that matches the previous result. So, it seems like 15 gallons is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of units to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with glasses per day:\n\n8 glasses/day\n\nEach glass is 8 ounces, so:\n\n8 glasses/day \u00d7 8 ounces/glass = 64 ounces/day\n\nThen, ounces to gallons:\n\n64 ounces/day \u00f7 128 ounces/gallon = 0.5 gallons/day\n\nOver 30 days:\n\n0.5 gallons/day \u00d7 30 days = 15 gallons\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other factors to consider, like leap years or varying lengths of months, but the question assumes a 30-day month, so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nAdditionally, I should make sure that my conversion factors are accurate. I recall that there are 128 ounces in a gallon, but to be extra sure, I can verify that.\n\nYes, there are 128 fluid ounces in a gallon in the U.S. measurement system. Since the question doesn't specify, I'll assume it's using U.S. units.\n\nIf it were using imperial units, the number would be different, but given that the question mentions glasses and ounces, which are commonly used in the U.S., I think it's safe to assume U.S. units.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is 15 gallons per month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
