        "content": "That's an interesting riddle! Let me think about this. So, something that goes around the world and stays in a corner. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for something to \"go around the world.\" Maybe it's something that is known globally, or perhaps it's something that travels worldwide. And \"stays in a corner\" could mean that it remains in one place, specifically in a corner.\n\nLet me consider some possibilities. A stamp on a letter? Stamps are used worldwide, but I'm not sure if they stay in a corner. Wait, actually, stamps are usually placed in the corner of an envelope. So, a stamp goes around the world via mail and stays in a corner of the envelope. That could be it.\n\nAnother option could be a seal, like a stamp used to seal documents. Seals are used internationally and might be placed in a corner. But stamps seem more universally recognized and are indeed placed in a corner.\n\nIs there another answer? Maybe something more abstract. Like a language or a currency that's used worldwide and also stays in a corner, perhaps in a digital sense. But that seems too vague.\n\nLet me check some common riddle answers. I remember that \"a stamp\" is a common answer to similar riddles. For example, \"What goes around the world but stays in a corner?\" is often a stamp.\n\nAlternatively, another possible answer could be \"a postage stamp,\" which is more specific.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe there are other answers. Like a nail, which is used worldwide and stays in the corner of a wall. But that doesn't seem to fit as well because nails are used in various positions, not necessarily in corners.\n\nAnother possibility is a period or a full stop in writing, which is used universally in languages and stays in the corner of a sentence. But that seems a bit of a stretch.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a corner in a literal sense, like a map. Maps are used worldwide, and a corner could refer to a specific part of the map. But that doesn't quite fit.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Maybe it's something that is small and found in a corner but has global significance. Like a nail, but that was already considered.\n\nAnother angle: something that travels around the world and then rests in a corner. Maybe a ship that travels the world and then docks in a corner of a harbor. But that seems too specific.\n\nOr perhaps it's something like a sunbeam that goes around the world (due to the Earth's rotation) and stays in a corner of a room.\n\nWait, that might be reaching too far.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other common riddle answers that fit this description.\n\nI think \"a stamp\" is the most straightforward and fitting answer. It's used worldwide in mail systems and is typically placed in the corner of an envelope.\n\nSo, my final answer is a stamp.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{a stamp}} \\]"
