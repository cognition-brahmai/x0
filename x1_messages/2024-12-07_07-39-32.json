To find out how many left-handed students there are, you can calculate 25% of 40.\n\nFirst, convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:\n\n25% \u00f7 100 = 0.25\n\nThen, multiply the decimal by the total number of students:\n\n0.25 \u00d7 40 = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 left-handed students in the class."
