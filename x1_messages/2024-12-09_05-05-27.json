        "content": "Let's see here. So, there's a train going from station A to station B at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, and it takes 2 hours to do that. Now, the question is, how long would it take for a car traveling at 40 miles per hour to cover the same distance?\n\nFirst, I need to find out what the distance is between station A and station B. Since the train travels at 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, I can calculate the distance using the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, Distance = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nNow, that means the car has to cover 120 miles at a speed of 40 miles per hour. To find out how long that would take, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance \u00f7 Speed\n\nSo, Time = 120 miles \u00f7 40 miles/hour = 3 hours.\n\nTherefore, it would take the car 3 hours to cover the same distance.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If the train goes at 60 miles per hour and the car goes at 40 miles per hour, the car is going slower, so it should take more time, which makes sense because 3 hours is longer than 2 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the ratio of their speeds. The train's speed is 60 mph, and the car's speed is 40 mph, so the ratio is 60:40, which simplifies to 3:2. That means the train is 1.5 times faster than the car, or conversely, the car is two-thirds as fast as the train.\n\nIf the train takes 2 hours, then the car, being two-thirds as fast, should take three-halves the time, because time and speed are inversely proportional when distance is constant.\n\nSo, Time_car = Time_train \u00d7 (Speed_train \u00f7 Speed_car)\n\nWait, no. Actually, since Time is inversely proportional to Speed for a constant distance, it should be:\n\nTime_car = Time_train \u00d7 (Speed_train \u00f7 Speed_car)\n\nLet me see: Time is inversely proportional to Speed, so Time_car = Time_train \u00d7 (Speed_train \u00f7 Speed_car)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's think about it again.\n\nIf Speed is inversely proportional to Time for a constant distance, then Speed \u00d7 Time = Constant (which is the distance).\n\nSo, Speed_train \u00d7 Time_train = Speed_car \u00d7 Time_car\n\nTherefore, Time_car = (Speed_train \u00d7 Time_train) \u00f7 Speed_car\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime_car = (60 mph \u00d7 2 hours) \u00f7 40 mph = 120 miles \u00f7 40 mph = 3 hours.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, it definitely confirms that it would take the car 3 hours to cover the same distance.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe if the car isn't traveling at a constant speed, or if there are stops along the way, but the question specifies that the car is traveling at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour, just like the train.\n\nSo, no, there shouldn't be any other factors to consider. The distance is 120 miles, the speed is 40 miles per hour, so time is 3 hours.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can think about the units. Miles per hour is a rate, and when I divide miles by miles per hour, the units cancel out to give hours, which is correct for time.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how far the car travels in one hour at 40 mph. It covers 40 miles in one hour. So, to cover 120 miles, it would take 120 \u00f7 40 = 3 hours.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to see how many 40-mile segments are in 120 miles. Well, 120 \u00f7 40 = 3, so it would take 3 hours.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 3 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
