        "content": "Hmm, that's an interesting riddle. Let's see... something that has teeth but can't bite. Well, teeth are usually associated with animals or people for chewing or biting, but in this case, it's something that can't bite.\n\nMaybe it's a comb? A comb has teeth, but it can't bite. It's used to comb hair, and those teeth are just for gripping the hair, not for biting.\n\nAnother option could be a saw. A saw has teeth for cutting wood, but it doesn't bite in the way an animal does.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a piano? A piano has keys, but maybe the term \"teeth\" refers to something else in this context. Hmm, not sure about that.\n\nLet me think differently. Could it be a gear? Gears have teeth that interlock to transmit power, but they don't bite like an animal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a zipper? Zippers have teeth-like parts that interlock to fasten things together, but again, no biting involved.\n\nI think the comb makes the most sense because it directly has teeth that are clearly visible and serve a different purpose than biting.\n\nSo, my answer is a comb.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{comb}} \\]"
