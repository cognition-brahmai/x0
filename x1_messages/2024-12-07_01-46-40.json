This tool is useful in finding relevant websites.\nWebScraper[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkFinder[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nKnowledgeBase[input]: Question answering model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g. What color is the cat, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What is the history behind the creation of Microsoft Corporation and who were its key founders?"

        "content": "Alright, I need to find out about the history of Microsoft Corporation and its key founders. I think the best way to start is by doing a general search to get an overview of the company's beginnings. I can use the GoogleSearch tool for that.\n\nSo, first step:\n\nPlan: Use GoogleSearch to find information about the history of Microsoft Corporation and its founders.\n\n:evidence0: = GoogleSearch[\"history of Microsoft Corporation and its key founders\"]\n\nOnce I have the search results from Google, I'll likely get a list of websites that talk about Microsoft's history. I need to pick the most relevant ones to get detailed information. Maybe I can use LinkFinder to extract the links from the Google search results and then use WebScraper to get the content from those links.\n\nSecond step:\n\nPlan: Extract relevant links from the Google search results.\n\n:evidence1: = LinkFinder[:evidence0:]\n\nThen, I'll need to decide which links to scrape for content. Probably, official sources or well-known encyclopedic websites would be best.\n\nThird step:\n\nPlan: Scrape the content from the selected links.\n\n:evidence2: = WebScraper[:evidence1:]\n\nNow, with the scraped content, I need to find the specific information about the history and the key founders. This might be a lot of text, so I should use KnowledgeBase to ask specific questions and get concise answers.\n\nFourth step:\n\nPlan: Use KnowledgeBase to find the history of Microsoft Corporation from the scraped content.\n\n:evidence3: = KnowledgeBase[\"What is the history behind the creation of Microsoft Corporation, given :evidence2:?\"]\n\nFifth step:\n\nPlan: Use KnowledgeBase again to identify the key founders of Microsoft Corporation from the scraped content.\n\n:evidence4: = KnowledgeBase[\"Who were the key founders of Microsoft Corporation, given :evidence2:?\"]\n\nFinally, I can compile the information from :evidence3: and :evidence4: to give a complete answer to the user's question.\n\nAnswer: Based on :evidence3: and :evidence4:, I can provide a detailed response about the history of Microsoft Corporation and its key founders.\n\nWait, maybe I can make this more efficient. Instead of scraping multiple links and then asking separate questions, perhaps I can focus on one or two high-quality sources and get all the information from there.\n\nLet me adjust the plan:\n\nFirst, do a Google search for \"history of Microsoft Corporation and its key founders.\"\n\nPlan: Conduct a Google search to find reliable sources on Microsoft's history and founders.\n\n:evidence0: = GoogleSearch[\"history of Microsoft Corporation and its key founders\"]\n\nNext, extract the top links from the search results, perhaps the first three or four that look like they come from reputable sources, like Wikipedia, official Microsoft pages, or business history websites.\n\nPlan: Extract top links from Google search results.\n\n:evidence1: = LinkFinder[:evidence0:]\n\nThen, scrape the content from these links.\n\nPlan: Scrape the content from the extracted links.\n\n:evidence2: = WebScraper[:evidence1:]\n\nNow, with the scraped content, use KnowledgeBase to answer the user's question by referencing the scraped content.\n\nPlan: Use KnowledgeBase to answer the user's question based on the scraped content.\n\n:evidence3: = KnowledgeBase[\"What is the history behind the creation of Microsoft Corporation and who were its key founders, given :evidence2:?\"]\n\nThis should give me a comprehensive answer directly.\n\nAlternatively, if the information is too scattered, I might need to scrape multiple sources and combine the information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can just use KnowledgeBase directly with the Google search results.\n\nWait, but KnowledgeBase works best with a passage of text, and GoogleSearch returns search results, not the full text.\n\nMaybe I should first use GoogleSearch to find the relevant pages, then use WebScraper to get the content from those pages, and then use KnowledgeBase to extract the specific information from that content.\n\nYes, that seems like the most straightforward approach.\n\nSo, revised plan:\n\n1. Use GoogleSearch to find pages about Microsoft's history and founders.\n\n2. Use LinkFinder to extract the links from the Google search results.\n\n3. Use WebScraper to get the content from those links.\n\n4. Use KnowledgeBase to answer the user's question based on the scraped content.\n\nThis should give me the information I need in a structured way.\n\nI should also consider the reliability of the sources. Maybe prioritize sources like Wikipedia, official Microsoft history pages, or well-known business history websites.\n\nAdditionally, to ensure I have a comprehensive answer, I might scrape content from multiple pages and combine them in the input to KnowledgeBase.\n\nBut to keep it efficient, perhaps focusing on one or two high-quality sources would suffice.\n\nLet me think about potential sources. Wikipedia probably has a detailed page on Microsoft's history. Also, the official Microsoft website likely has a history section. Maybe also a page from a business magazine or news outlet that has an article on Microsoft's founding.\n\nSo, in the Google search, I can look for results from these sources.\n\nThen, in the WebScraper step, I can specify to scrape only the relevant sections, like the history section from Wikipedia.\n\nWait, but WebScraper likely just grabs the full text content of the page.\n\nThat might be fine, as KnowledgeBase can filter out the relevant information.\n\nAlright, proceeding with the revised plan.\n\nOne more thing: I should make sure that the input to KnowledgeBase is not too large. If I'm scraping multiple pages, I might need to summarize the content or feed it in chunks.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume that WebScraper can handle it and KnowledgeBase can process a reasonable amount of text.\n\nSo, final plan:\n\nPlan: Search Google for \"history of Microsoft Corporation and its key founders.\"\n\n:evidence0: = GoogleSearch[\"history of Microsoft Corporation and its key founders\"]\n\nPlan: Extract top relevant links from the Google search results.\n\n:evidence1: = LinkFinder[:evidence0:]\n\nPlan: Scrape the content from the extracted links.\n\n:evidence2: = WebScraper[:evidence1:]\n\nPlan: Use KnowledgeBase to answer the user's question based on the scraped content.\n\n:evidence3: = KnowledgeBase[\"What is the history behind the creation of Microsoft Corporation and who were its key founders, given :evidence2:?\"]\n\nAnswer: :evidence3:\n\nThis should give me the information I need in a concise manner.\n\n**Final Plan**\n\n1. **Search Google for\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f:**\n   - Plan: Search Google for \"history of Microsoft Corporation and its key founders.\"\n   - :evidence0:= GoogleSearch[\"history of Microsoft Corporation and its key founders\"]\n\n2. **Extract relevant links from the search results:**\n   - Plan: Extract top relevant links from the Google search results.\n   - :evidence1:= LinkFinder[:evidence0:]\n\n3. **Scrape the content from the extracted links:**\n   - Plan: Scrape the content from the extracted links.\n   - :evidence2:= WebScraper[:evidence1:]\n\n4. **Use KnowledgeBase to answer the user's question based on the scraped content:**\n   - Plan: Use KnowledgeBase to answer the user's question based on the scraped content.\n   - :evidence3:= KnowledgeBase[\"What is the history behind the creation of Microsoft Corporation and who were its key founders, given :evidence2:?\"]\n\n5. **Provide the final answer:**\n   - Answer: :evidence3:"
