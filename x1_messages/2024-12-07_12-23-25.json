        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. To create a simple command-line calculator in Python, we'll need to take input from the user for two numbers and the operation they want to perform. Then, based on the operation, we'll compute the result and display it.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Input**: Get two numbers and the operator from the user.\n2. **Operation**: Based on the operator, perform the addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.\n3. **Output**: Display the result.\n\nWe also need to handle potential errors, such as division by zero or invalid operators.\n\nLet's start by writing the code to get input from the user.\n\n```python\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\noperator = input(\"Enter operator (+, -, *, /): \")\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n```\n\nNext, we'll use if-elif-else statements to perform the correct operation based on the operator.\n\n```python\nif operator == \"+\":\n    result = num1 + num2\nelif operator == \"-\":\n    result = num1 - num2\nelif operator == \"*\":\n    result = num1 * num2\nelif operator == \"/\":\n    if num2 != 0:\n        result = num1 / num2\n    else:\n        result = \"Error! Division by zero.\"\nelse:\n    result = \"Invalid operator!\"\n```\n\nFinally, we'll print the result.\n\n```python\nprint(\"Result: \", result)\n```\n\nPutting it all together, the complete script looks like this:\n\n```python\n# Get input from the user\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\noperator = input(\"Enter operator (+, -, *, /): \")\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n# Perform the operation based on the operator\nif operator == \"+\":\n    result = num1 + num2\nelif operator == \"-\":\n    result = num1 - num2\nelif operator == \"*\":\n    result = num1 * num2\nelif operator == \"/\":\n    if num2 != 0:\n        result = num1 / num2\n    else:\n        result = \"Error! Division by zero.\"\nelse:\n    result = \"Invalid operator!\"\n\n# Display the result\nprint(\"Result: \", result)\n```\n\nThis script will work for basic arithmetic operations. If you want to make it more robust, you could add more error handling, such as checking if the inputs are indeed numbers.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!"
