        "content": "Before the discovery of insulin, diabetes was indeed a challenging condition to manage. The primary approach to treatment involved strict dietary restrictions, aimed at controlling blood sugar levels. One of the key figures in the early attempts to treat diabetes was Dr. Frederick Banting, who would later co-discover insulin.\n\nIn the early 20th century, before insulin was available, some doctors experimented with using pancreatic extracts from animals to treat diabetes. Specifically, they used pancreas extracts from cattle or pigs. These extracts contained insulin, although at the time, the exact nature of the active component was not yet understood.\n\nOne notable figure in this area was Dr. Nicolae Paulescu, a Romanian physician and professor of physiology. In 1921, he discovered a substance he called \"pancrein,\" which was later recognized as insulin. However, it was Dr. Banting and his team, including Charles Best and James Collip, who successfully isolated insulin and developed a method for its extraction and purification, leading to the first clinical use of insulin in 1922.\n\nSo, to directly answer your question, before the advent of insulin therapy as we know it today, diabetes was treated with strict diets and sometimes with extracts from the pancreas of animals like cattle or pigs.\n\n**References:**\n\n- Bliss, M.
