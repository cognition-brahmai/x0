        "content": "So there's a class with 25 students, and 60% of them are girls. I need to find out how many boys are there. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the total number of students is 25. Out of these, 60% are girls. So, to find the number of girls, I can calculate 60% of 25.\n\nTo calculate 60% of 25, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. 60% is the same as 60 divided by 100, which is 0.6.\n\nSo, number of girls = 0.6 \u00d7 25.\n\nLet me do the multiplication: 0.6 \u00d7 25 = 15.\n\nSo, there are 15 girls in the class.\n\nNow, to find the number of boys, I can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.\n\nNumber of boys = total students - number of girls = 25 - 15 = 10.\n\nSo, there are 10 boys in the class.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe by calculating the percentage of boys directly.\n\nIf 60% are girls, then the remaining percentage must be boys, right?\n\nSo, percentage of boys = 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nThen, number of boys = 40% of 25.\n\nAgain, converting 40% to a decimal: 40% = 0.4.\n\nSo, number of boys = 0.4 \u00d7 25 = 10.\n\nSame answer as before, which is a good sign.\n\nAlternatively, I could use fractions. 60% is the same as 60/100, which simplifies to 3/5.\n\nSo, number of girls = 3/5 \u00d7 25 = (3 \u00d7 25)/5 = 75/5 = 15.\n\nAgain, confirming that there are 15 girls.\n\nThen, number of boys = 25 - 15 = 10.\n\nAnother way: since 60% are girls, then 40% are boys, which is 40/100 = 2/5.\n\nSo, number of boys = 2/5 \u00d7 25 = (2 \u00d7 25)/5 = 50/5 = 10.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same conclusion that there are 10 boys in the class.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check if the percentages make sense.\n\nTotal number of students: 25.\n\nNumber of girls: 15.\n\nNumber of boys: 10.\n\nTotal: 15 + 10 = 25, which matches the total number of students.\n\nPercentage of girls: (15/25) \u00d7 100% = (15 \u00d7 100)/25 = 1500/25 = 60%, which matches the given information.\n\nPercentage of boys: (10/25) \u00d7 100% = (10 \u00d7 100)/25 = 1000/25 = 40%, which also makes sense.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys in the class is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
