        "content": "To implement the `BankAccount` class in C++ with the specified attributes and methods, we need to ensure that the account details are encapsulated properly using private members and provide public methods to interact with these members. We will include methods for depositing money, withdrawing money, and displaying account details. Additionally, we will implement validation checks to ensure that deposits are positive amounts and withdrawals do not exceed the available balance.\n\n## Approach\n\n1. **Class Definition**:\n   - Private attributes: account number, account holder's name, and balance.\n   - Public methods: deposit, withdraw, display.\n\n2. **Methods**:\n   - `deposit(double amount)`: Adds the specified amount to the balance if the amount is positive.\n   - `withdraw(double amount)`: Subtracts the specified amount from the balance if the amount is positive and does not exceed the current balance.\n   - `display()`: Prints the account details including account number, holder's name, and balance.\n\n3. **Validation**:\n   - Deposit amounts must be positive.\n   - Withdrawal amounts must be positive and less than or equal to the current balance.\n\n4. **Encapsulation**:\n   - Private members to restrict direct access.\n   - Public methods to manipulate private members.\n\n## Solution Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nclass BankAccount {\nprivate:\n    int accountNumber;\n    std::string accountHolderName;\n    double balance;\n\npublic:\n    // Constructor to initialize the account\n    BankAccount(int accNum, const std::string& accHolderName, double initialBalance) \n        : accountNumber(accNum), accountHolderName(accHolderName), balance(initialBalance) {}\n\n    // Method to deposit money into the account\n    void deposit(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0) {\n            balance += amount;\n            std::cout << \"Deposited: \" << amount << \" New balance: \" << balance << std::endl;\n        } else {\n            std::cout << \"Invalid deposit amount.\" << std::endl;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Method to withdraw money from the account\n    void withdraw(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {\n            balance -= amount;\n            std::cout << \"Withdrew: \" << amount << \" New balance: \" << balance << std::endl;\n        } else {\n            std::cout << \"Invalid withdrawal amount or insufficient funds.\" << std::endl;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Method to display account details\n    void display() const {\n        std::cout << \"Account Number: \" << accountNumber << std::endl;\n        std::cout << \"Account Holder Name: \" << accountHolderName << std::endl;\n        std::cout << \"Balance: \" << balance << std::endl;\n    }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    // Example usage\n    BankAccount myAccount(123456, \"John Doe\", 1000.0);\n\n    myAccount.display();\n    myAccount.deposit(500.0);\n    myAccount.withdraw(200.0);\n    myAccount.display();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n1. **Class Definition**:\n   - `BankAccount` class has private members: `accountNumber`, `accountHolderName`, and `balance`.\n   - Public methods: `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `display`.\n\n2. **Constructor**:\n   - Initializes the account with an account number, holder's name, and initial balance.\n\n3. **deposit method**:\n   - Adds the specified amount to the balance if the amount is positive.\n   - Prints the new balance after deposit.\n\n4. **withdraw method**:\n   - Subtracts the specified amount from the balance if the amount is positive and does not exceed the current balance.\n   - Prints the new balance after withdrawal.\n\n5. **display method**:\n   - Prints the account number, holder's name, and current balance.\n\n6. **main function**:\n   - Demonstrates creating a `BankAccount` object and performing deposit, withdrawal, and display operations.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the bank account operations are handled safely with appropriate validation checks."
