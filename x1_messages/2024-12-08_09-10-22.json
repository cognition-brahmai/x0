        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure out the probability that the face-down side of a card is also A, given that I see an A on the face-up side. There are four cards in total, each with specific combinations on their sides:\n\n1. One card has A on both sides.\n\n2. Another has B on both sides.\n\n3. The third has A on one side and B on the other.\n\n4. The fourth has B on one side and C on the other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total possible scenarios where I see an A on the face-up side. Then, out of those scenarios, how many of them have an A on the face-down side.\n\nLet me list out all the sides of the cards:\n\n- Card 1: Side X = A, Side Y = A\n\n- Card 2: Side X = B, Side Y = B\n\n- Card 3: Side X = A, Side Y = B\n\n- Card 4: Side X = B, Side Y = C\n\nWait, actually, the problem says:\n\n- One card has A on both sides.\n\n- One card has B on both sides.\n\n- One card has A on one side and B on the other.\n\n- One card has B on one side and C on the other.\n\nSo, to clarify, let's assign names to the cards:\n\n- Card AA: Both sides are A.\n\n- Card BB: Both sides are B.\n\n- Card AB: One side A and the other side B.\n\n- Card BC: One side B and the other side C.\n\nNow, I need to pick a card randomly and see that the face-up side is A. Given that, what's the probability that the face-down side is also A.\n\nFirst, let's consider all possible ways to see an A on the face-up side.\n\n- If I pick Card AA, either side is A. So, both sides would show A.\n\n- If I pick Card AB, only one side shows A.\n\n- If I pick Card BB, neither side shows A.\n\n- If I pick Card BC, neither side shows A.\n\nSo, only Card AA and Card AB can show an A on the face-up side.\n\nNow, I need to find out, out of all the scenarios where A is face-up, how many of those have A on the face-down side.\n\nLet me think in terms of probabilities.\n\nFirst, what's the probability of picking each card? Since there are four cards, the probability of picking any one card is 1/4.\n\nNow, given that I see an A on the face-up side, I need to condition on that.\n\nLet me calculate the total probability of seeing an A on the face-up side.\n\n- For Card AA: Both sides are A, so the probability of seeing A is 1.\n\n- For Card AB: One side is A and the other is B, so the probability of seeing A is 1/2.\n\n- For Card BB: Both sides are B, so the probability of seeing A is 0.\n\n- For Card BC: One side is B and the other is C, so the probability of seeing A is 0.\n\nSo, the total probability of seeing an A on the face-up side is:\n\nP(A face-up) = P(Card AA) * P(A|Card AA) + P(Card AB) * P(A|Card AB) + P(Card BB) * P(A|Card BB) + P(Card BC) * P(A|Card BC)\n\n= (1/4)*1 + (1/4)*(1/2) + (1/4)*0 + (1/4)*0\n\n= 1/4 + 1/8 + 0 + 0\n\n= 3/8\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that the face-down side is also A, given that the face-up side is A.\n\nIn other words, P(Face-down is A | Face-up is A).\n\nBy Bayes' theorem, this is:\n\nP(Face-down is A | Face-up is A) = P(Face-up is A | Face-down is A) * P(Face-down is A) / P(Face-up is A)\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way to think about this.\n\nAlternatively, since we're dealing with cards and sides, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of individual sides.\n\nLet's consider all possible sides that could be face-up.\n\nList all the sides:\n\n- Card AA, Side 1: A\n\n- Card AA, Side 2: A\n\n- Card AB, Side 1: A\n\n- Card AB, Side 2: B\n\n- Card BB, Side 1: B\n\n- Card BB, Side 2: B\n\n- Card BC, Side 1: B\n\n- Card BC, Side 2: C\n\nTotal sides: 8.\n\nNow, if I see an A on the face-up side, it could be any of the sides that have A.\n\nWhich are:\n\n- Card AA, Side 1: A\n\n- Card AA, Side 2: A\n\n- Card AB, Side 1: A\n\nSo, three sides have A.\n\nOut of these three, both sides of Card AA have A, so for those two sides, the face-down side is also A.\n\nOnly one side belongs to Card AB, and its face-down side is B.\n\nTherefore, out of the three possible sides where face-up is A, two of them have face-down as A, and one has face-down as B.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the face-down side is A, given that face-up is A, is 2/3.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated P(A face-up) as 3/8, which seems inconsistent with there being three sides out of eight that show A.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconcile these two approaches.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nIf I think in terms of sides, there are eight sides in total.\n\nEach side is equally likely to be face-up.\n\nSo, the probability of any particular side being face-up is 1/8.\n\nNow, out of these eight sides, which ones show A on face-up?\n\n- Card AA, Side 1: A\n\n- Card AA, Side 2: A\n\n- Card AB, Side 1: A\n\nSo, three sides show A on face-up.\n\nTherefore, P(A face-up) = 3/8.\n\nNow, out of these three sides, two belong to Card AA, and one belongs to Card AB.\n\nFor the two sides belonging to Card AA, the face-down side is A.\n\nFor the one side belonging to Card AB, the face-down side is B.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the face-down side is A, given that face-up is A, is 2/3.\n\nAlternatively, using Bayes' theorem:\n\nWe have:\n\nP(Face-down is A | Face-up is A) = P(Face-up is A | Face-down is A) * P(Face-down is A) / P(Face-up is A)\n\nNow, P(Face-up is A | Face-down is A): This is the probability that face-up is A given that face-down is A. This would be 1, because if both sides are A, then regardless of which side is face-up, it's A.\n\nP(Face-down is A): This is the probability that a randomly picked card has A on the face-down side.\n\nWait, but face-down depends on which side is face-up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of cards.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Event AA: Picking Card AA.\n\n- Event AB: Picking Card AB.\n\n- Event BB: Picking Card BB.\n\n- Event BC: Picking Card BC.\n\nWe know that P(AA) = P(AB) = P(BB) = P(BC) = 1/4.\n\nNow, P(A face-up | AA) = 1 (since both sides are A).\n\nP(A face-up | AB) = 1/2 (since one side is A and the other is B).\n\nP(A face-up | BB) = 0.\n\nP(A face-up | BC) = 0.\n\nNow, using total probability:\n\nP(A face-up) = P(AA)*P(A|AA) + P(AB)*P(A|AB) + P(BB)*P(A|BB) + P(BC)*P(A|BC) = (1/4)*1 + (1/4)*(1/2) + (1/4)*0 + (1/4)*0 = 1/4 + 1/8 + 0 + 0 = 3/8.\n\nNow, P(Face-down is A | Face-up is A).\n\nBut perhaps I need to define more carefully.\n\nActually, perhaps it's clearer to think in terms of the specific sides.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Let S be the specific side that is face-up.\n\n- We know that S is A.\n\n- We need to find the probability that the opposite side is A.\n\nGiven that, let's consider:\n\n- There are three possible sides that could be face-up and show A: two from AA and one from AB.\n\n- Two out of these three have the opposite side as A (since they are from AA).\n\n- One out of these three has the opposite side as B (from AB).\n\nTherefore, P(opposite side is A | face-up is A) = 2/3.\n\nAlternatively, using Bayes' theorem with cards:\n\nP(AA | A face-up) = [P(A face-up | AA) * P(AA)] / P(A face-up) = [1 * 1/4] / (3/8) = (1/4) / (3/8) = 2/3.\n\nSimilarly, P(AB | A face-up) = [P(A face-up | AB) * P(AB)] / P(A face-up) = [(1/2) * (1/4)] / (3/8) = (1/8) / (3/8) = 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the card is AA, given that face-up is A, is 2/3, and the probability that the card is AB is 1/3.\n\nSince AA has A on both sides, and AB has B on the other side, the probability that the face-down side is A is equal to the probability that the card is AA given that face-up is A, which is 2/3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2/3.\n\nBut wait a minute, is this correct?\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose I pick a card and see A on the face-up side.\n\nI need to find the probability that the other side is also A.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of possible A sides.\n\nThere are three A sides in total:\n\n- Two A sides from AA.\n\n- One A side from AB.\n\nSo, three A sides.\n\nOut of these, two A sides have A on the other side (since they are from AA), and one A side has B on the other side (from AB).\n\nTherefore, the probability is 2/3.\n\nYes, this seems consistent with the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the cards:\n\n- Card AA: both sides A. So, if face-up is A, face-down is A.\n\n- Card AB: one side A, one side B. So, if face-up is A, face-down is B.\n\n- Card BB: both sides B. Cannot have face-up A.\n\n- Card BC: one side B, one side C. Cannot have face-up A.\n\nSo, only AA and AB can have face-up A.\n\nProbability that the face-down side is A, given face-up is A, is the probability that the card is AA given face-up is A.\n\nWhich is P(AA | A face-up) = [P(A face-up | AA) * P(AA)] / P(A face-up) = [1 * 1/4] / (3/8) = 2/3.\n\nYes, this matches.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to consider that there are four cards, but since we're only considering the cases where face-up is A, which are the AA and AB cards.\n\nBut wait, AB only shows A on one side, while AA shows A on both sides.\n\nSo, in terms of sides, AA has two A sides, and AB has one A side.\n\nSo, total A sides are three, as earlier.\n\nTwo of them have A on the other side, one has B on the other side.\n\nHence, 2/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 2/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}} \\]"
