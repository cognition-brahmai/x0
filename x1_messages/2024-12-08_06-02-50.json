        "content": "So, the factory produces 500 toys every hour, and it runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I need to find out how many toys it produces in a week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many toys are produced in a day. Since there are 24 hours in a day and the factory produces 500 toys each hour, I can multiply 500 by 24 to get the daily production.\n\n500 toys/hour * 24 hours/day = 12,000 toys/day\n\nOkay, so the factory produces 12,000 toys each day.\n\nNow, to find out the weekly production, I need to multiply the daily production by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:\n\n12,000 toys/day * 7 days/week = 84,000 toys/week\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 84,000 toys in a week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the total number of hours in a week and then multiply that by the hourly production rate.\n\nFirst, find the total hours in a week:\n\n24 hours/day * 7 days/week = 168 hours/week\n\nThen, multiply the hourly production by the total hours in a week:\n\n500 toys/hour * 168 hours/week = 84,000 toys/week\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, the factory produces 84,000 toys in a week.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation.\n\nFor example, does the factory operate non-stop without any breaks? The question says it operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, so no breaks or downtime is mentioned. So, I'm assuming it's running continuously.\n\nAlso, the production rate is constant at 500 toys per hour. There's no information suggesting that the rate changes over time, so I can assume it's constant.\n\nGiven these assumptions, my calculation should be accurate.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the weekly production step by step.\n\nStart with hourly production: 500 toys/hour\n\nThen, find the production for a half-day, a full day, and then a week.\n\nHalf-day production: 500 toys/hour * 12 hours = 6,000 toys\n\nFull-day production: 500 toys/hour * 24 hours = 12,000 toys\n\nWeekly production: 12,000 toys/day * 7 days = 84,000 toys\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the weekly production in terms of hours:\n\nTotal hours in a week: 24 hours/day * 7 days = 168 hours\n\nToys produced in a week: 500 toys/hour * 168 hours = 84,000 toys\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's try another approach.\n\nSuppose I calculate the monthly or annual production, but the question is only about a week, so that might be overkill.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the production rate in different units, like toys per minute or something, but that seems unnecessary for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the production in terms of shifts or something, but again, the problem states that the factory operates 24/7 at a constant rate, so no need to complicate it further.\n\nI think 84,000 toys per week is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{84000} \\]"
