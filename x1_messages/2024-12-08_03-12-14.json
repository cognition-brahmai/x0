        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that sells two types of pens: blue and black. The ratio of blue pens sold to black pens sold is 3:5, and the total number of pens sold last week was 640. We need to find out how many blue pens were sold.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio like 3:5 tells us that for every 3 blue pens sold, there are 5 black pens sold. So, the sales are divided into parts where blue pens make up 3 parts and black pens make up 5 parts.\n\nTo find out how many pens correspond to each part, I can think of the total parts as 3 + 5 = 8 parts. This means that the total sales of 640 pens are divided into 8 parts.\n\nNow, to find the value of one part, I can divide the total number of pens by the total number of parts:\n\n\\[ \\text{One part} = \\frac{640}{8} \\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{640}{8} = 80 \\]\n\nSo, one part corresponds to 80 pens.\n\nSince blue pens make up 3 parts, I can find the number of blue pens sold by multiplying the value of one part by 3:\n\n\\[ \\text{Blue pens} = 80 \\times 3 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Blue pens} = 240 \\]\n\nSimilarly, for black pens, which are 5 parts:\n\n\\[ \\text{Black pens} = 80 \\times 5 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Black pens} = 400 \\]\n\nTo check if this makes sense, I can add the blue and black pens together and see if they total 640:\n\n\\[ 240 + 400 = 640 \\]\n\nYes, that matches the total given.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use the ratio to set up a proportion. The ratio of blue to total pens sold is 3 to 8 (since 3 blue out of 8 total parts). So, I can set up the proportion:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{\\text{blue pens}}{640} \\]\n\nThen, solve for the blue pens:\n\n\\[ \\text{blue pens} = \\frac{3}{8} \\times 640 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{blue pens} = 3 \\times 80 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{blue pens} = 240 \\]\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nI can also verify this by considering the ratio of black pens to total pens, which is 5:8. Using the same method:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{\\text{black pens}}{640} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{black pens} = \\frac{5}{8} \\times 640 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{black pens} = 5 \\times 80 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{black pens} = 400 \\]\n\nAgain, this matches our previous calculation.\n\nSo, the store sold 240 blue pens last week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
