        "content": "I'd be happy to help you with that! Let's start by calculating the determinant of matrix A, and then we'll move on to finding its inverse. Here's the matrix A:\n\nA = [[1, 2],\n\n[3, 4]]\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of A. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix is calculated using the formula:\n\ndet(A) = (a*d) - (b*c)\n\nwhere a, b, c, and d are the elements of the matrix:\n\na = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4\n\nSo, plugging in these values:\n\ndet(A) = (1*4) - (2*3) = 4 - 6 = -2\n\nGreat, the determinant of A is -2.\n\nNow, to find the inverse of matrix A, we use the formula for the inverse of a 2x2 matrix:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere adj(A) is the adjugate of A. The adjugate of a 2x2 matrix is simply the matrix with the elements a and d swapped, and b and c negated:\n\nadj(A) = [[d, -b],\n\n[-c, a]]\n\nSo, for our matrix A:\n\nadj(A) = [[4, -2],\n\n[-3, 1]]\n\nNow, multiply this adjugate by (1/det(A)), which is 1/(-2) = -1/2:\n\nA^(-1) = -1/2 * [[4, -2],\n\n[-3, 1]]\n\nTo multiply a matrix by a scalar, we multiply each element by that scalar:\n\nA^(-1) = [[(-1/2)*4, (-1/2)*(-2)],\n\n[(-1/2)*(-3), (-1/2)*1]]\n\nCalculating each element:\n\nFirst element: (-1/2)*4 = -2\n\nSecond element: (-1/2)*(-2) = 1\n\nThird element: (-1/2)*(-3) = 1.5\n\nFourth element: (-1/2)*1 = -0.5\n\nSo, the inverse of A is:\n\nA^(-1) = [[-2, 1],\n\n[1.5, -0.5]]\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Determinant of A: -2\n\n- Inverse of A: [[-2, 1], [1.5, -0.5]]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
