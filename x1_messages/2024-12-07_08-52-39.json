        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 30 socks in total: 10 pairs of white socks and 5 pairs of black socks. That means there are 20 white socks and 10 black socks. But wait, it says 10 pairs of white socks and 5 pairs of black socks, so that should be 20 white socks and 10 black socks, right? Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the question is about picking socks randomly without looking, and we need to figure out how many socks we need to pick to guarantee that we have at least one matching pair.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a matching pair means. I think it means two socks of the same color, right? So, either two white socks or two black socks.\n\nOkay, so the idea is to make sure that no matter how I pick the socks, I end up with at least two of the same color.\n\nLet me think about the worst-case scenario. The worst case would be that I pick socks in such a way that I delay getting a matching pair as much as possible.\n\nSo, if there are only two colors, white and black, the worst case would be picking one white and one black sock first. That way, I have two socks but no matching pair yet.\n\nNow, if I pick a third sock, it has to be either white or black. If it's white, then I have two white socks, which is a matching pair. If it's black, then I have two black socks, which is also a matching pair.\n\nSo, in this case, picking three socks guarantees that I have at least one matching pair.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem mentions pairs, and it seems like there's more to it because of the way it's phrased.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"There are 30 socks in a drawer, consisting of 10 pairs of white socks and 5 pairs of black socks. If you randomly pick out socks one by one without looking, how many socks do you need to pick to guarantee having at least one matching pair?\"\n\nHmm, maybe I need to consider that there are multiple pairs of each color.\n\nBut, in terms of matching pairs, as long as two socks are of the same color, they form a pair, right? It doesn't matter which specific pair they belong to.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial reasoning is sufficient: in the worst case, pick one white and one black, and then the third sock will match one of them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to look at it.\n\nLet me consider the number of different colors. There are two colors: white and black.\n\nIf I pick more socks than there are colors, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least one color must have at least two socks.\n\nThe pigeonhole principle states that if you have n holes and n+1 pigeons, at least one hole has more than one pigeon.\n\nIn this case, the \"holes\" are the colors, and the \"pigeons\" are the socks.\n\nSo, with 2 colors, picking 3 socks guarantees that at least one color has at least two socks.\n\nTherefore, picking 3 socks guarantees at least one matching pair.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a chance that I pick three socks and don't have a matching pair.\n\nLet me think about that.\n\nIf I pick one white and one black sock first, that's two socks, no matching pair.\n\nThen, picking a third sock: it has to be either white or black.\n\nIf it's white, I have two white socks; if it's black, I have two black socks.\n\nIn either case, I have a matching pair.\n\nSo, it seems that picking three socks is sufficient to guarantee at least one matching pair.\n\nBut let's think about it another way.\n\nSuppose I pick only two socks: one white and one black.\n\nThat's not a matching pair.\n\nBut if I pick a third sock, it must match one of the first two.\n\nSo, yes, picking three socks guarantees at least one matching pair.\n\nAlternatively, if I pick four socks, that would guarantee at least two matching pairs, but the question is about guaranteeing at least one matching pair.\n\nSo, I think the answer is three socks.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider that there are multiple pairs of each color.\n\nDoes that affect the reasoning?\n\nWell, since matching pairs are just two socks of the same color, and there are multiple pairs of each color, it shouldn't change the fact that picking three socks guarantees at least one matching pair.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nMaybe the pairs are distinguishable in some way, but I don't think that's relevant for this problem.\n\nThe problem is about colors and matching pairs based on color, not about specific pairs.\n\nSo, I think my initial reasoning holds: pick three socks to guarantee at least one matching pair.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this.\n\nIn probability, there's the pigeonhole principle, which I already used.\n\nIs there another principle or formula that applies here?\n\nI don't think so.\n\nThe pigeonhole principle seems to be the right approach for this problem.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that picking three socks guarantees at least one matching pair.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another angle.\n\nSuppose I pick all the black socks first.\n\nThere are 10 black socks.\n\nBut the question is about guaranteeing a matching pair, not about picking a specific color.\n\nWait, no.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is still picking one of each color first.\n\nPicking all black socks wouldn't be the worst case because once you pick two black socks, you already have a matching pair.\n\nBut in the context of guaranteeing a matching pair, the worst case is picking one white and one black sock first.\n\nThen, the third sock picked must match one of them.\n\nTherefore, picking three socks is sufficient to guarantee at least one matching pair.\n\nI don't think picking two socks is enough, because you could have one white and one black sock, which doesn't form a matching pair.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be three socks.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other factor I'm missing.\n\nThe problem mentions \"10 pairs of white socks and 5 pairs of black socks.\"\n\nDoes the number of pairs affect the reasoning?\n\nWell, the number of pairs determines the total number of socks of each color.\n\nThere are 20 white socks and 10 black socks.\n\nBut in terms of guaranteeing a matching pair, it's the number of colors that matters, not the number of pairs.\n\nBecause, regardless of how many pairs there are, as long as there are only two colors, the pigeonhole principle applies in the same way.\n\nSo, I think the answer remains three socks.\n\nAlternatively, if there were more colors, the number would be different.\n\nFor example, if there were three colors, you'd need to pick four socks to guarantee a matching pair.\n\nBut in this case, with two colors, picking three socks should suffice.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is three socks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
