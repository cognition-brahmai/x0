However, I must clarify that knowledge isn't exclusive to any particular group, and many facts about Buddhism are well-known to both practitioners and non-practitioners alike. That being said, one interesting aspect of Buddhism is the concept of \"Anatta\" or \"Anatman,\" which refers to the idea of no permanent self or soul. This teaching is central to Buddhist philosophy and might not be as widely understood by those outside the tradition. It's important to approach all religious beliefs with respect and an open mind."
