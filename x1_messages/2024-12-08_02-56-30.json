        "content": "Let's see. There are 50 people in the room. 30% of them wear glasses. So first, I need to find out how many people wear glasses.\n\nTo find 30% of 50, I can calculate 30/100 * 50.\n\nThat's 0.3 * 50 = 15 people wear glasses.\n\nNow, 40% of those who wear glasses also wear a hat. So, I need to find 40% of 15.\n\nThat would be 40/100 * 15 = 0.4 * 15 = 6.\n\nTherefore, 6 people wear both glasses and a hat.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using fractions instead of decimals.\n\nLet me try again.\n\n30% of 50 is the same as 30/100 * 50 = 3/10 * 50 = 15, which matches what I did earlier.\n\nThen, 40% of 15 is 40/100 * 15 = 4/10 * 15 = 6.\n\nYes, still 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of probabilities or something, but that might be overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as:\n\nTotal people = 50\n\nPercentage wearing glasses = 30%\n\nSo, number wearing glasses = 30% of 50 = 15\n\nPercentage of glass wearers also wearing hats = 40%\n\nSo, number wearing both = 40% of 15 = 6\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nIs there any other angle to this?\n\nWait, maybe I should confirm if there's any trick here, like people who wear hats but don't wear glasses, or something like that. But the question is only about those who wear both glasses and a hat.\n\nIt says 40% of those who wear glasses also wear a hat, which directly translates to 40% of 15, which is 6.\n\nI don't think there's more to it.\n\nSo, the answer should be 6 people wear both glasses and a hat.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
