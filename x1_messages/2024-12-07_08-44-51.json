        "content": "Earth rotates around its axis approximately 365.25 times in the time it takes to orbit the Sun once. This is because Earth takes about 365.25 days to complete one orbit around the Sun, and it rotates once every 24 hours. However, since Earth is moving around the Sun as it rotates, it needs to rotate a little extra to bring the Sun back to the same position in the sky. This results in approximately 366.25 rotations in a year, but since the orbit is elliptical and the rotation speed varies slightly, the exact number is about 365.25 rotations per year."
