        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces two types of products: A and B. Each week, they make 500 units of product A and 300 units of product B. Now, product A needs 2 hours of labor per unit, and product B needs 3 hours per unit. The workers work 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. We need to find out how many workers are needed to meet this production schedule.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total labor hours required for producing both products each week.\n\nFor product A:\n\n500 units * 2 hours/unit = 1000 hours\n\nFor product B:\n\n300 units * 3 hours/unit = 900 hours\n\nSo, the total labor hours needed per week are:\n\n1000 hours + 900 hours = 1900 hours\n\nNext, I need to determine how many hours one worker can work in a week.\n\nWorkers work 8 hours a day for 5 days, so:\n\n8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week per worker\n\nNow, to find out how many workers are needed, I should divide the total labor hours by the number of hours one worker can work in a week.\n\nNumber of workers = Total labor hours / Hours per worker per week\n\nNumber of workers = 1900 hours / 40 hours/week = 47.5 workers\n\nSince you can't have half a worker, you'd need to round up to the next whole number. So, the factory would need 48 workers to meet the production requirements.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total production hours:\n\nProduct A: 500 units * 2 hours/unit = 1000 hours\n\nProduct B: 300 units * 3 hours/unit = 900 hours\n\nTotal: 1000 + 900 = 1900 hours\n\nWorker hours per week: 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week\n\nNumber of workers: 1900 / 40 = 47.5\n\nRounding up, 48 workers.\n\nSeems straightforward. But maybe there's something else I should consider, like overtime or breaks, but the problem doesn't mention anything extra. So, based on the given information, 48 workers should suffice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
