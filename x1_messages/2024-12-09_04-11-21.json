        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about a normal distribution. The mean is 50, and the standard deviation is 10. I need to find the probability of randomly selecting a value between 40 and 60. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that in a normal distribution, the data is symmetrically distributed around the mean. The mean, median, and mode are all the same, which in this case is 50. The standard deviation tells us how spread out the data is. A smaller standard deviation means the data is more tightly clustered around the mean, and a larger one means it's more spread out.\n\nSo, here, with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10, the distribution is centered at 50, and most of the data should be within a few standard deviations of the mean.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that a randomly selected value is between 40 and 60. So, 40 is one standard deviation below the mean (50 - 10 = 40), and 60 is one standard deviation above the mean (50 + 10 = 60).\n\nI recall that in a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean. That means about 68% of the values are between 40 and 60. But the problem asks me to calculate this probability, so I should probably be more precise than just using the empirical rule.\n\nTo find the exact probability, I need to use the z-score formula and then look up the values in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator that can handle normal distribution probabilities.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere:\n\n- X is the value from the distribution\n\n- \u03bc is the mean\n\n- \u03c3 is the standard deviation\n\nSo, I'll need to find the z-scores for both 40 and 60, and then find the area under the standard normal curve between those two z-scores. That area will represent the probability of selecting a value between 40 and 60.\n\nLet's start by calculating the z-score for 40:\n\nz1 = (40 - 50) / 10 = (-10) / 10 = -1\n\nAnd for 60:\n\nz2 = (60 - 50) / 10 = (10) / 10 = 1\n\nSo, I need to find the probability that z is between -1 and 1.\n\nNow, I can look up the cumulative probabilities for z = -1 and z = 1 in a standard normal distribution table.\n\nFirst, for z = 1:\n\nLooking at the standard normal table, the value for z = 1.0 is approximately 0.8413. This means that the probability of z being less than 1 is 0.8413.\n\nFor z = -1:\n\nThe standard normal table typically gives values for positive z-scores, but because the normal distribution is symmetric, the probability for z = -1 is the same as 1 minus the probability for z = 1.\n\nSo, P(z < -1) = 1 - P(z < 1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587.\n\nNow, to find the probability that z is between -1 and 1, I need to calculate:\n\nP(-1 < z < 1) = P(z < 1) - P(z < -1) = 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826.\n\nSo, the probability of randomly selecting a value between 40 and 60 is approximately 0.6826, or 68.26%.\n\nWait a minute, that matches the empirical rule I mentioned earlier. It looks like the empirical rule is a good approximation here.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nFirst, z-scores:\n\nFor 40: (40 - 50)/10 = -1\n\nFor 60: (60 - 50)/10 = 1\n\nThose seem correct.\n\nThen, looking up z = 1: 0.8413\n\nAnd z = -1: 0.1587\n\nSubtracting: 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the symmetry of the normal distribution. Since the distribution is symmetric around the mean, the area between -1 and 1 is twice the area from 0 to 1.\n\nThe area from 0 to 1 is 0.8413 - 0.5 = 0.3413.\n\nThen, twice that is 0.6826, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, either way, I end up with the same result.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a value between 40 and 60 is approximately 68.26%.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.6826} \\]"
