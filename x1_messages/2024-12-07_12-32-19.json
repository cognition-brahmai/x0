        "content": "So the factory produces 500 cars every week, and we want to find out how many cars it produces in a year. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many weeks there are in a year. I know that a year has 52 weeks. Some years have 52 weeks exactly, and some might have 52 weeks plus one or two extra days, but for simplicity, we can assume there are 52 weeks in a year.\n\nSo, if the factory produces 500 cars each week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, then the total number of cars produced in a year would be 500 cars/week multiplied by 52 weeks/year.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal cars per year = 500 cars/week * 52 weeks/year\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication.\n\n500 multiplied by 50 is 25,000, and 500 multiplied by 2 is 1,000. So, 25,000 plus 1,000 equals 26,000.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again.\n\nActually, 500 times 50 is 25,000, and 500 times 2 is 1,000, so yes, 25,000 plus 1,000 is 26,000.\n\nBut I recall that 52 times 500 should be 26,000. Let me verify this again.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 52 times 500 as 52 times 5 hundreds, which is 52 times 5 is 260, and then add the two zeros, making it 26,000.\n\nHmm, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try another way. I can break down 52 into 50 plus 2.\n\nSo, 500 times 50 is 25,000, and 500 times 2 is 1,000. Adding those together gives 26,000.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that there are 52 weeks in a year, so over 4 weeks, the factory produces 4 times 500, which is 2,000 cars.\n\nThere are roughly 13 periods of 4 weeks in a year since 52 divided by 4 is 13.\n\nSo, 13 times 2,000 is 26,000 cars.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of months, there are about 4 weeks in a month, so monthly production would be 4 times 500, which is 2,000 cars per month.\n\nThere are 12 months in a year, so 12 times 2,000 is 24,000 cars.\n\nBut wait, that's different from my previous calculation.\n\nHold on, there's a discrepancy here. Earlier methods gave me 26,000, but this one gives 24,000.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nOh, I see the issue. If I consider 4 weeks per month, that's an approximation, but in reality, most months have more than 4 weeks. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, divided by 12 months, that's approximately 4.33 weeks per month.\n\nSo, if I want to calculate monthly production more accurately, I should use 4.33 weeks per month.\n\nSo, 4.33 weeks/month times 500 cars/week is approximately 2,165 cars per month.\n\nThen, 2,165 cars/month times 12 months/year is 25,980 cars per year.\n\nThat's very close to 26,000, actually.\n\nThe slight difference is due to rounding.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that there are exactly 52 weeks in a year, then 52 times 500 is indeed 26,000.\n\nBut let's think about leap years. In a leap year, there are 366 days, which might correspond to 52 weeks and 2 days.\n\nBut for the sake of this problem, I think it's acceptable to assume 52 weeks in a year.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 26,000 cars in a year.\n\nBut to be completely accurate, I should consider that a year has 52 weeks and 1 day (or 2 days in a leap year).\n\nSo, if a year has 52 weeks and 1 day, and the factory produces 500 cars per week, then in that extra day, the factory would produce 500 divided by 7 days, which is approximately 71.43 cars.\n\nSo, total production would be 26,000 plus 71.43, which is approximately 26,071 cars per year.\n\nIn a leap year, with an extra day, it would be 26,000 plus 2 times 71.43, which is approximately 26,142 cars.\n\nHowever, since the question doesn't specify whether it's a leap year or not, and considering that leap years occur every 4 years, perhaps the average annual production would be closer to 26,071 cars.\n\nBut for simplicity, I think it's reasonable to assume that the factory produces approximately 26,000 cars per year.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory operates every day of the year, including weekends, then I should calculate based on days instead of weeks.\n\nThere are 365 days in a non-leap year.\n\nIf the factory produces 500 cars per week, and there are 7 days in a week, then the daily production rate is 500 divided by 7, which is approximately 71.43 cars per day.\n\nTherefore, in a non-leap year, total production would be 71.43 cars/day times 365 days/year, which equals approximately 26,071 cars per year.\n\nIn a leap year, with 366 days, it would be 71.43 times 366, which is approximately 26,142 cars.\n\nAgain, this confirms my earlier estimation.\n\nHowever, perhaps the factory does not operate every day of the year. Maybe it has weekends off or some holidays.\n\nIf the factory operates only on weekdays, that would be 5 days a week.\n\nIn that case, the weekly production of 500 cars would be over 5 days, so the daily production rate would be 500 divided by 5, which is 100 cars per day.\n\nThere are 52 weeks in a year, so 52 weeks times 5 days/week equals 260 days in a year.\n\nTherefore, total production would be 100 cars/day times 260 days/year, which is 26,000 cars per year.\n\nThis matches my initial calculation.\n\nBut wait, if the factory operates only on weekdays, but there are some holidays, the number of production days might be less than 260.\n\nHowever, without specific information about holidays, I'll assume 260 production days in a year.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 26,000 cars per year.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory operates7 days a week, with no days off, then the daily production rate is 500 divided by 7, which is approximately 71.43 cars per day.\n\nIn this case, total annual production would be 71.43 cars/day times 365 days/year, which is approximately 26,071 cars per year.\n\nBut since the initial statement says the factory produces 500 cars every week, without specifying the number of days it operates in a week, we can assume that it operates a standard weekly schedule, likely 5 days a week.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward calculation is 500 cars/week times 52 weeks/year, which equals 26,000 cars per year.\n\nHence, the factory produces approximately 26,000 cars in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{26000} \\]"
