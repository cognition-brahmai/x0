        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a town with 50 houses, and each house has either cats or dogs as pets. No mix of the two, right? And apparently, the number of dogs is twice the number of cats. Also, there are 120 animals in total. We need to find out how many cats there are.\n\nFirst, let's define our variables. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( c \\) represent the number of cats.\n\n- Since the number of dogs is twice the number of cats, we can say the number of dogs is \\( 2c \\).\n\nNow, we know that the total number of animals is 120. So, the sum of cats and dogs should be 120:\n\n\\[ c + 2c = 120 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, that\u2019s:\n\n\\[ 3c = 120 \\]\n\nTo find \\( c \\), we divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{120}{3} = 40 \\]\n\nSo, there are 40 cats in total.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. If there are 40 cats, then there should be \\( 2 \\times 40 = 80 \\) dogs. Adding those up: \\( 40 + 80 = 120 \\), which matches the total number of animals. So, that seems correct.\n\nHowever, there's another aspect to consider: there are 50 houses, and each house has either cats or dogs. Does the distribution of cats and dogs among the houses affect the total numbers?\n\nLet\u2019s think about it. If each house has at least one pet, and some houses might have more than one pet, but the problem doesn't specify. It just says each house has either cats or dogs as pets.\n\nBut in our earlier calculation, we didn't need to consider the number of houses because we were only dealing with the total numbers of cats and dogs. The number of houses seems somewhat irrelevant unless there's more to the problem.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the number of houses does play a role. Let\u2019s consider that each house has at least one pet, and possibly more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some houses have multiple pets, and we need to consider that in our calculation.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let \\( h_c \\) be the number of houses with cats.\n\n- Let \\( h_d \\) be the number of houses with dogs.\n\nWe know that:\n\n\\[ h_c + h_d = 50 \\]\n\nNow, each house with cats has some number of cats, and each house with dogs has some number of dogs.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how many pets per house, only that each house has either cats or dogs.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the first approach is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem implies that each house has only one pet, either a cat or a dog.\n\nIf that's the case, then the total number of pets would be equal to the total number of houses, which is 50. But the problem states there are 120 animals in total, which is more than 50, so that can't be right.\n\nTherefore, houses must have more than one pet.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that each house has only cats or only dogs, and each house has at least one pet.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\( h_c \\): number of houses with cats.\n\n- \\( h_d \\): number of houses with dogs.\n\n- \\( c \\): total number of cats.\n\n- \\( d \\): total number of dogs.\n\nWe know that:\n\n1. \\( h_c + h_d = 50 \\) (total number of houses)\n\n2. \\( c + d = 120 \\) (total number of animals)\n\n3. \\( d = 2c \\) (number of dogs is twice the number of cats)\n\nFrom equation 3, we can substitute \\( d \\) in equation 2:\n\n\\[ c + 2c = 120 \\]\n\n\\[ 3c = 120 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 40 \\]\n\nSo, there are 40 cats in total.\n\nBut let's see if this aligns with the number of houses.\n\nSuppose each house with cats has only one cat. Then, there would be 40 houses with cats, since \\( h_c = c = 40 \\). But then, the number of houses with dogs would be \\( h_d = 50 - 40 = 10 \\). And the number of dogs would be \\( d = 2c = 80 \\). So, each house with dogs would have \\( \\frac{80}{10} = 8 \\) dogs. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, if houses with cats have more than one cat, the number of houses with cats could be less, but then the number of dogs per house would need to adjust accordingly to maintain the total of 120 animals and the ratio of dogs to cats.\n\nFor example, if each house with cats has two cats, then \\( h_c = \\frac{c}{2} = \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\) houses with cats. Then, \\( h_d = 50 - 20 = 30 \\) houses with dogs. The total number of dogs would still be 80, so each house with dogs would have \\( \\frac{80}{30} \\approx 2.67 \\) dogs, which isn't possible since you can't have a fraction of a dog. So, this scenario isn't feasible.\n\nTherefore, the only feasible solution under these constraints is that each house with cats has one cat, and each house with dogs has eight dogs.\n\nThus, the total number of cats is 40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
