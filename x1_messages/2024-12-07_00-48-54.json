        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a book with 400 pages, and I'm supposed to open it in the middle and start reading forward. Then, after reading half of the remaining pages, I split the remaining pages equally and read half again, and I keep doing this until I finish the book. The question is, how many times did I split the pages?\n\nOkay, first things first, opening the book exactly in the middle. Since there are 400 pages, the middle would be page 200, right? So, I open to page 200 and start reading forward from there.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says \"open the book exactly in the middle and start reading forward.\" Does that mean I start reading from page 200 to page 400? Or is there something else?\n\nLet me think. If I open the book in the middle, pages 200 and 201 would be facing each other, assuming it's a proper book with pages folded in the middle. But maybe it's just a digital book or something, so page 200 is where I start.\n\nBut the problem seems to be about splitting the pages and reading halves each time, so maybe the initial opening is just to get started, and then I repeatedly split the remaining pages and read half each time.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the problem to understand it better.\n\nI have 400 pages in total. I open the book in the middle, which is page 200, and start reading forward. So, initially, I have pages 200 to 400 to read, which is 201 pages (since page 200 is included).\n\nWait, page 200 to page 400 is 400 - 200 + 1 = 201 pages.\n\nBut the problem says \"open the book exactly in the middle and start reading forward.\" Maybe it means to start from the first page and open it in the middle, but that doesn't make sense because opening in the middle would be page 200.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider that opening in the middle means starting from page 200, and then I have pages 200 to 400 to read.\n\nAlright, so I start with 200 pages to read (pages 200 to 400).\n\nWait, but 400 - 200 + 1 = 201 pages. Hmm, is page 200 included? Let's assume it is.\n\nBut to simplify, maybe it's 200 pages.\n\nThen, I read half of the remaining pages each time, and split the remaining pages equally, read half again, and so on, until I finish the book.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"after reading half of the remaining pages, you again split the remaining pages equally and read half.\" So, it's a bit confusing.\n\nMaybe it's better to think of it as repeatedly dividing the remaining pages by 2 and reading half each time.\n\nLet me try to model this step by step.\n\nStarting with N = 400 pages.\n\n1. Open in the middle: page 200. Start reading forward.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck on this \"open in the middle\" part. Maybe it's just a way to say I start with the whole book, and then repeatedly split and read half.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it means to start with the whole book, split it in half, read one half, then split the remaining half, and so on.\n\nWait, that makes more sense.\n\nSo, starting with 400 pages.\n\nFirst split: divide into two equal parts of 200 pages each.\n\nI read the first 200 pages.\n\nThen, I have 200 pages left.\n\nSecond split: divide the remaining 200 pages into two equal parts of 100 pages each.\n\nI read the next 100 pages.\n\nThen, I have 100 pages left.\n\nThird split: divide the remaining 100 pages into two equal parts of 50 pages each.\n\nI read the next 50 pages.\n\nThen, I have 50 pages left.\n\nFourth split: divide the remaining 50 pages into two equal parts of 25 pages each.\n\nI read the next 25 pages.\n\nThen, I have 25 pages left.\n\nFifth split: divide the remaining 25 pages into two equal parts. Wait, 25 is odd, so it's not perfectly divisible.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider that pages can't be split into fractions.\n\nBut for simplicity, maybe we can assume that splitting 25 into two equal parts would be 12 and 13 pages, but that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the splits are only possible when the number of pages is even.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"split the remaining pages equally and read half.\" So, perhaps it's only done when the remaining pages are divisible by 2.\n\nSo, continuing from the fourth split:\n\nFourth split: divide 50 pages into two parts of 25 pages each.\n\nI read 25 pages.\n\nThen, I have 25 pages left.\n\nNow, 25 is odd, so I can't split it equally into two integer parts.\n\nSo, perhaps I can't split anymore, and I just read the remaining 25 pages.\n\nWait, but the problem says to continue splitting and reading half until I finish the book.\n\nBut in this case, I can't split 25 pages into two equal parts.\n\nUnless I consider splitting into 12 and 13 pages.\n\nBut that might complicate the counting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the splitting stops when the remaining pages can't be divided evenly.\n\nBut the problem says to split equally, so maybe it's only possible when the number is even.\n\nIn that case, after the fourth split, I have 25 pages left, which is odd, so I can't split it equally, so I read the remaining 25 pages without splitting.\n\nSo, in total, I split the pages 4 times.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nFirst split: 400 -> 200 read, 200 left\n\nSecond split: 200 -> 100 read, 100 left\n\nThird split: 100 -> 50 read, 50 left\n\nFourth split: 50 -> 25 read, 25 left\n\nThen, no more splitting, read the remaining 25 pages.\n\nSo, I split 4 times.\n\nBut the answer seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"open in the middle and start reading forward\" means something different.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSuppose \"open in the middle\" means starting from the middle page, page 200, and reading forward to the end, which is pages 200 to 400, totaling 201 pages.\n\nBut 400 - 200 + 1 = 201 pages.\n\nThen, I read half of the remaining pages, which would be 201 / 2 = 100.5 pages. But pages can't be split into halves, so perhaps it's 100 pages and then 101 pages, but that's messy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial opening in the middle divides the book into two equal parts, and I start reading from one part.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should think in terms of binary division.\n\nEach time I split the pages equally and read half, it's like dividing the remaining pages by 2 each time.\n\nSo, starting with 400 pages, I split into two parts of 200 pages each, read one part, then split the remaining 200 into two parts of 100, and so on.\n\nSo, it's similar to repeatedly dividing by 2 until I can't divide evenly anymore.\n\nSo, starting with 400:\n\n1. Split into 200 and 200, read 200, remaining 200\n\n2. Split into 100 and 100, read 100, remaining 100\n\n3. Split into 50 and 50, read 50, remaining 50\n\n4. Split into 25 and 25, read 25, remaining 25\n\nNow, 25 can't be split evenly into two integers, so I read the remaining 25 pages without splitting.\n\nTherefore, I split the pages 4 times.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider splitting 25 into 12 and 13, then:\n\n5. Split into 12 and 13, read 12, remaining 13\n\n6. Split 13 into 6 and 7, read 6, remaining 7\n\n7. Split 7 into 3 and 4, read 3, remaining 4\n\n8. Split 4 into 2 and 2, read 2, remaining 2\n\n9. Split 2 into 1 and 1, read 1, remaining 1\n\n10. Read the last page.\n\nSo, in this case, I split the pages 6 times.\n\nBut this seems more complicated, and the problem might not intend for us to split unevenly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps splitting into unequal parts isn't allowed, so splitting stops when the remaining pages are odd.\n\nIn that case, I split 4 times, as in the first approach.\n\nBut to confirm, let's think about the total number of splits needed to read the entire book.\n\nEach split reduces the remaining pages by half.\n\nSo, starting with N = 400 pages.\n\nAfter k splits, the remaining pages are N / 2^k.\n\nWe need to find the smallest k such that N / 2^k = 1.\n\nBut 400 / 2^k = 1 \u21d2 2^k = 400 \u21d2 k = log2(400) \u2248 8.64.\n\nSince k must be an integer, k = 9 splits.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because after each split, the remaining pages are halved.\n\nBut in reality, with integer pages, it's not possible to split 25 pages into two equal parts.\n\nSo, perhaps a better way is to consider the number of times 400 can be divided by 2 before reaching 1.\n\nBut 2^8 = 256, which is less than 400, and 2^9 = 512, which is more than 400.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of binary tree levels.\n\nEach split corresponds to a level in the binary tree, and the number of splits is the depth of the tree.\n\nBut again, with uneven splits, it gets complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the number of splits needed to read the entire book.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that each split divides the remaining pages into two equal parts, and I read one part.\n\nSo, after each split, the remaining pages are halved.\n\nSo, starting with 400 pages:\n\n1. Split into 200 and 200, read 200, remaining 200\n\n2. Split into 100 and 100, read 100, remaining 100\n\n3. Split into 50 and 50, read 50, remaining 50\n\n4. Split into 25 and 25, read 25, remaining 25\n\n5. Can't split 25 evenly, so read 25.\n\nSo, 4 splits in total.\n\nAlternatively, if I allow unequal splits, like splitting 25 into 12 and 13:\n\n4. Split 25 into 12 and 13, read 12, remaining 13\n\n5. Split 13 into 6 and 7, read 6, remaining 7\n\n6. Split 7 into 3 and 4, read 3, remaining 4\n\n7. Split 4 into 2 and 2, read 2, remaining 2\n\n8. Split 2 into 1 and 1, read 1, remaining 1\n\n9. Read the last page.\n\nSo, in this case, 8 splits in total.\n\nBut the problem says \"split the remaining pages equally,\" which might imply splitting into two equal parts when possible, and stopping when it's no longer possible.\n\nTherefore, the first approach seems more plausible: split 4 times, then read the remaining pages without splitting.\n\nHence, the number of times I split the pages is 4.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the general case.\n\nSuppose there are N pages.\n\nEach split divides the remaining pages by 2.\n\nThe number of splits needed is the number of times you can divide N by 2 before reaching 1.\n\nThis is equivalent to floor(log2(N)).\n\nFor N = 400, log2(400) \u2248 8.64, so floor(8.64) = 8 splits.\n\nBut earlier, my step-by-step approach led to 4 splits.\n\nThere must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, no. log2(400) is approximately 8.64, but that would suggest 8 splits, but in reality, with splitting and reading, it's different.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that each split reduces the remaining pages by half.\n\nSo, after k splits, the remaining pages are N / 2^k.\n\nWe stop when the remaining pages are 1.\n\nSo, N / 2^k = 1 \u21d2 2^k = N \u21d2 k = log2(N).\n\nBut since N = 400 is not a power of 2, k is not an integer.\n\nIn this case, k = floor(log2(400)) = 8.\n\nBut in my earlier step-by-step, I only did 4 splits.\n\nThere's inconsistency here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of splits is equal to the number of times I can divide N by 2 until I can't divide evenly anymore.\n\nIn the case of N = 400:\n\n1. 400 / 2 = 200\n\n2. 200 / 2 = 100\n\n3. 100 / 2 = 50\n\n4. 50 / 2 = 25\n\n5. 25 is odd, can't split evenly.\n\nSo, 4 splits in total.\n\nThis matches my initial step-by-step approach.\n\nTherefore, the number of times I split the pages is 4.\n\nI think this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
