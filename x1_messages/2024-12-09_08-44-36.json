Let's break this down to figure out the total distance you've traveled.\n\nFirst, you're driving at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours. To find out how far you go in that time, you can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo for the first part:\n\nDistance\u2081 = 60 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 180 miles\n\nThat makes sense. You're covering 60 miles each hour for 3 hours, so 180 miles in total for that segment.\n\nThen, you increase your speed to 80 miles per hour and keep that up for another 2 hours. Again, using the same formula:\n\nDistance\u2082 = 80 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 160 miles\n\nSo, in the second part, you're covering 80 miles each hour for 2 hours, which adds up to 160 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance traveled, you just need to add up the distances from both segments:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance\u2081 + Distance\u2082 = 180 miles + 160 miles = 340 miles\n\nSo, overall, you've traveled 340 miles.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. For example, could we think about the average speed over the entire journey and then multiply by the total time?\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time you've been driving: 3 hours + 2 hours = 5 hours.\n\nNow, to find the average speed, it's not just the average of 60 and 80, because you've spent different amounts of time at each speed. Instead, the average speed is the total distance divided by the total time.\n\nBut in this case, we've already calculated the total distance as 340 miles, and the total time is 5 hours, so the average speed would be 340 miles / 5 hours = 68 mph.\n\nAlternatively, if we wanted to calculate the average speed first and then use it to find the total distance, we could weigh the speeds by the time spent at each speed.\n\nAverage speed = (Speed\u2081 \u00d7 Time\u2081 + Speed\u2082 \u00d7 Time\u2082) / Total Time\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nAverage speed = (60 mph \u00d7 3 hours + 80 mph \u00d7 2 hours) / 5 hours = (180 + 160) / 5 = 340 / 5 = 68 mph\n\nThen, total distance = average speed \u00d7 total time = 68 mph \u00d7 5 hours = 340 miles\n\nSo, we get the same result again, which is a good sign that our calculation is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the distance-time graph, where speed is the slope of the distance-time graph. But since we're dealing with constant speeds in each segment, it's straightforward to calculate the distance for each segment and then sum them up.\n\nI don't think there's any need to involve more complex concepts like acceleration or anything like that, because the problem states that you're driving at constant speeds in each segment.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the total distance, like stops or changes in direction. But according to the problem, you're driving continuously at the specified speeds, so no need to account for stops or detours.\n\nAlso, it's important to ensure that the units are consistent. Here, both speeds are in miles per hour, and times are in hours, so everything works out nicely in the calculations.\n\nIf the speeds were given in different units, say kilometers per hour, we'd need to convert them to the same unit for the calculation to make sense. But in this case, everything is in miles per hour and hours, so we're good.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the total distance traveled is 340 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{340} \\]"
