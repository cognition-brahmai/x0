        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here: In a room full of people, everyone shakes hands with each other exactly once, and there were a total of 66 handshakes. I need to figure out how many people are in the room.\n\nOkay, so handshaking problems are pretty common in combinatorics. I remember that the number of handshakes in a group of people where everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once can be calculated using combinations. Specifically, it's the number of ways to choose 2 people out of n to shake hands, which is denoted as \"n choose 2\" or C(n, 2).\n\nSo, the formula for C(n, 2) is n(n-1)/2. And according to the problem, this equals 66. So, I can set up the equation:\n\nn(n-1)/2 = 66\n\nNow, I need to solve for n. Let's multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\nn(n-1) = 132\n\nSo, now I have a quadratic equation:\n\nn\u00b2 - n - 132 = 0\n\nI need to solve this quadratic equation for n. I can either factor it, complete the square, or use the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first.\n\nI'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -132 and add up to -1. Hmm, let's see:\n\nPossible factor pairs of 132 are:\n\n1 and 132\n\n2 and 66\n\n3 and 44\n\n4 and 33\n\n6 and 22\n\n11 and 12\n\nNow, considering the signs, I need one positive and one negative to get -132. And their difference should be -1.\n\nLet's see, if I take 11 and -12:\n\n11 * (-12) = -132\n\n11 + (-12) = -1\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, I can factor the quadratic as:\n\n(n + 11)(n - 12) = 0\n\nSetting each factor to zero gives me:\n\nn + 11 = 0 => n = -11\n\nn - 12 = 0 => n = 12\n\nNow, since the number of people can't be negative, n = 12 is the valid solution.\n\nLet me double-check this. If there are 12 people, the number of handshakes is C(12, 2) = 12*11/2 = 66, which matches the given total.\n\nSo, the answer should be 12 people in the room.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, is there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using sequences or something else?\n\nAnother way is to think of it as an arithmetic series. The first person shakes hands with n-1 people, the second with n-2 (since they've already shaken hands with the first), and so on, until the last person who doesn't need to shake hands because they've already shaken hands with everyone else.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes is:\n\n(n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 + 0\n\nThis is the sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers, which is (n-1)n/2.\n\nWait, that's the same as C(n, 2), which is consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I end up with the same equation.\n\nTherefore, the room has 12 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
