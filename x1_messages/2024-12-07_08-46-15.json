        "content": "So there are 15 people in a room, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total. Hmm, this seems like a problem about combinations, where the order doesn't matter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand that a handshake is between two people, and it doesn't matter who initiates it; the handshake is the same. So, it's not like a situation where order matters, like arranging people in a line.\n\nI think the formula for combinations is useful here. The number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items without regard to the order is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, n is 15 (the number of people), and k is 2 (since a handshake is between two people).\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 2) = \\frac{15!}{2!(15 - 2)!} = \\frac{15!}{2! \\times 13!}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the 13! in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 2) = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 13!} = \\frac{15 \\times 14}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{210}{2} = 105\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 105 handshakes in total.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this to confirm? Maybe using the concept of graph theory, where each person is a vertex and each handshake is an edge connecting two vertices. Then, the number of handshakes would be equal to the number of edges in a complete graph with 15 vertices.\n\nThe formula for the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is also C(n, 2), which is the same as above. So, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it sequentially. The first person shakes hands with 14 other people. The second person has already shaken hands with the first, so they shake hands with 13 remaining people. The third person has already shaken hands with the first two, so they shake hands with 12 remaining people, and so on, until the last person, who has already shaken hands with everyone else.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be:\n\n14 + 13 + 12 + ... + 1\n\nThis is an arithmetic series where the first term a1 is 14, the last term an is 1, and the number of terms is 14.\n\nThe sum S of an arithmetic series is given by:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n(a1 + an)}{2}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{14(14 + 1)}{2} = \\frac{14 \\times 15}{2} = \\frac{210}{2} = 105\n\\]\n\nAgain, I get 105 handshakes, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's try another approach. Suppose each person shakes hands with every other person. So, person 1 shakes hands with persons 2 through 15 (14 handshakes), person 2 shakes hands with persons 3 through 15 (13 handshakes), and so on, until person 14 shakes hands with person 15 (1 handshake).\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes is the sum of the first 14 integers:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 14\n\nThe formula for the sum of the first n integers is:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nBut in this case, n is 14:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{14 \\times 15}{2} = 105\n\\]\n\nOnce again, 105 handshakes.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the total number of handshakes is 105.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]"
