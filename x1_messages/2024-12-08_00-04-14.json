        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two types of candies, Type A and Type B, costing $2 and $4 per pound respectively. The customer buys a total of 8 pounds for $20, and we need to find out how many pounds of each type they bought.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's denote:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of pounds of Type A candy.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of pounds of Type B candy.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total weight of the candies is 8 pounds.\n\n2. The total cost of the candies is $20.\n\nSo, we can write two equations accordingly.\n\nThe first equation is about the total weight:\n\n\\[ x + y = 8 \\]\n\nThe second equation is about the total cost. Since Type A costs $2 per pound and Type B costs $4 per pound, the total cost can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ 2x + 4y = 20 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 8 \\)\n\n2. \\( 2x + 4y = 20 \\)\n\nI think we can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. Let's try the substitution method first.\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( x + y = 8 \\), we can solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = 8 - y \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 2(8 - y) + 4y = 20 \\]\n\nLet's simplify and solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ 16 - 2y + 4y = 20 \\]\n\n\\[ 16 + 2y = 20 \\]\n\nSubtract 16 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 2y = 4 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ y = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the customer bought 2 pounds of Type B candy.\n\nNow, plug this value back into the expression for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = 8 - y = 8 - 2 = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 6 pounds of Type A candy and 2 pounds of Type B candy.\n\nTo double-check, let's verify both the total weight and the total cost.\n\nTotal weight: \\( 6 + 2 = 8 \\) pounds. Correct.\n\nTotal cost: \\( 2 \\times 6 + 4 \\times 2 = 12 + 8 = 20 \\) dollars. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could have used the elimination method. Let's see.\n\nStarting with the two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 8 \\)\n\n2. \\( 2x + 4y = 20 \\)\n\nWe can simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 2:\n\n\\[ x + 2y = 10 \\]\n\nNow, we have:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 8 \\)\n\n2. \\( x + 2y = 10 \\)\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n\\[ (x + 2y) - (x + y) = 10 - 8 \\]\n\n\\[ x + 2y - x - y = 2 \\]\n\n\\[ y = 2 \\]\n\nAgain, \\( y = 2 \\), and then \\( x = 8 - 2 = 6 \\).\n\nEither method leads us to the same conclusion.\n\nSo, the customer bought 6 pounds of Type A candy and 2 pounds of Type B candy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6 \\text{ pounds of Type A and } 2 \\text{ pounds of Type B}} \\]"
