        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 15 people in a room, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total.\n\nFirst, I think about smaller numbers to get a sense of the pattern. Let's say there are 2 people: Person A and Person B. They shake hands once. So, that's 1 handshake.\n\nNow, if there are 3 people: Person A, B, and C. A shakes hands with B and C, and B shakes hands with C. So, that's 3 handshakes in total.\n\nFor 4 people: A with B, C, D; B with C and D; C with D. That's 6 handshakes.\n\nWait a minute, is there a pattern here? For 2 people, 1 handshake; 3 people, 3 handshakes; 4 people, 6 handshakes. It seems like it's increasing by adding the next number each time: 1, 3 (which is 1+2), 6 (which is 1+2+3).\n\nSo, for 15 people, would it be the sum of numbers from 1 to 14? Because each new person shakes hands with all the previous ones.\n\nLet me check that. For 5 people: A with B, C, D, E; B with C, D, E; C with D, E; D with E. That's 10 handshakes, which is 1+2+3+4.\n\nYes, it seems like for n people, the number of handshakes is the sum of the first (n-1) integers.\n\nSo, for 15 people, it would be the sum of numbers from 1 to 14.\n\nBut summing up numbers from 1 to 14 manually would take time. Is there a formula for this?\n\nI recall that the sum of the first n integers is n(n+1)/2.\n\nSo, the sum from 1 to 14 would be 14*15/2 = 14*7.5 = 105.\n\nWait, but n should be 14, so 14*15/2 = 210/2 = 105.\n\nBut earlier, for 4 people, sum from 1 to 3 is 6, which matches.\n\nFor 5 people, sum from 1 to 4 is 10, which also matches.\n\nSo, for 15 people, it should be sum from 1 to 14, which is 14*15/2 = 105.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is combinations. Each handshake is a unique pair of people.\n\nSo, the number of handshakes is the number of ways to choose 2 people out of 15, which is the combination formula C(15,2).\n\nC(15,2) = 15! / (2! * (15-2)!) = (15*14)/2 = 105.\n\nThat matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the total number of handshakes is 105.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider another example. For 3 people, C(3,2) = 3, which matches the earlier count.\n\nFor 4 people, C(4,2) = 6, which also matches.\n\nTherefore, for 15 people, it's definitely 105 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]"
