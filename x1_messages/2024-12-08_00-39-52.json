Spock sounds like he might be a character with some alien traits, maybe? Like, not fully human or something. Kirk sounds like a typical human name, perhaps the captain or something. And Uhura\u2014 that name seems familiar, maybe from the same universe.\n\nWait a minute, I think they're from \"Star Trek.\" Yeah, I'm pretty sure \"Star Trek\" is a science fiction series that features these characters. Spock is a Vulcan, known for his logical approach, Mr. Spock. James T. Kirk is the captain of the starship Enterprise, and Nyota Uhura is communications officer on the same ship.\n\n\"Star Trek\" was created by Gene Roddenberry and has been around since the 1960s. It's a franchise that includes multiple TV series and films. So, if you're thinking of these characters, it's likely from \"Star Trek.\"\n\nIs that the one you were thinking of?"
