        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 10 red balls and 20 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 30 balls. I need to find the probability that if I pick two balls at random without replacing the first one, both of them will be red.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember how probability works. Probability is all about finding the chance of something happening. It's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcome is picking two red balls in a row without replacement. So, I need to find the probability of both events happening together.\n\nI think I should approach this step by step. First, find the probability of picking a red ball on the first draw, and then find the probability of picking another red ball on the second draw, given that the first one was red.\n\nSo, the probability of the first ball being red is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. That would be 10 red balls out of 30 total balls, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nNow, since I'm not replacing the first ball, the total number of balls decreases by one for the second draw. So, if the first ball was red, there are now 9 red balls left and a total of 29 balls.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a second red ball is 9/29.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening together, I need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, the overall probability should be (10/30) * (9/29).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 10/30 simplifies to 1/3.\n\nThen, 1/3 multiplied by 9/29 is (1*9)/(3*29) = 9/87.\n\nI can simplify 9/87 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3, which gives me 3/29.\n\nSo, the probability that both balls will be red is 3/29.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about combinations. Since the order doesn't matter here, I can use combinations to calculate the probability.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 10 is C(10,2), and the total number of ways to choose any 2 balls out of 30 is C(30,2).\n\nSo, the probability is C(10,2)/C(30,2).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nC(10,2) = 10! / (2! * (10-2)!) = (10*9)/2 = 45.\n\nC(30,2) = 30! / (2! * (30-2)!) = (30*29)/2 = 435.\n\nSo, the probability is 45/435, which simplifies to 3/29.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could have considered the probability as (10 choose 2) divided by (30 choose 2), which is the same as what I just did.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls will be red is 3/29.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{29}} \\]"
