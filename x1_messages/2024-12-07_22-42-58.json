        "content": "Let's see. So, the train goes from Town A to Town B at 80 km/h and it takes 4 hours. First, I need to find out the distance between Town A and Town B. Distance is speed multiplied by time, right? So, distance = 80 km/h * 4 h = 320 km.\n\nNow, on the way back, the train increases its speed by 20%. So, the new speed is 80 km/h + (20% of 80 km/h). 20% of 80 is 16, so the new speed is 80 + 16 = 96 km/h.\n\nI need to find out how long it takes to travel back to Town A at this new speed. Time is distance divided by speed, so time = 320 km / 96 km/h.\n\nLet me calculate that: 320 divided by 96. Hmm, 96 times 3 is 288, which is less than 320. 96 times 4 is 384, which is more than 320. So, it must be between 3 and 4 hours.\n\nLet me do the division properly. 320 divided by 96.\n\nAlternatively, I can simplify the fraction 320/96.\n\nBoth numbers are divisible by 16: 320 \u00f7 16 = 20, and 96 \u00f7 16 = 6. So, it's 20/6 hours.\n\n20/6 can be simplified to 10/3 hours.\n\n10/3 hours is the same as 3 and 1/3 hours, which is 3 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nSo, it takes 3 hours and 20 minutes for the train to travel back to Town A at the increased speed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ hours and } 20 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
