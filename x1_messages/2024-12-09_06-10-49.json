The process by which certain traits become more prevalent in a population over time\nC. The exchange of genes between two DNA molecules to form new combinations of genes\nD. The movement of genes from one population to another due to migration\nE. None of the above"

        "content": "Genetic drift refers to the random fluctuations in the frequency of alleles (gene variants) in a population over time, particularly in small populations. It's a mechanism of evolution that occurs due to chance events rather than natural selection. So, the correct answer is A. The variation in the relative frequency of different genotypes in a small population."
