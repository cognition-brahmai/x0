        "content": "To find out how long it will take for the train to reach its destination, you can use the formula for time, which is derived from the relationship between distance, speed, and time. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} \\]\n\nGiven that the train's average speed is 60 miles per hour and the distance to be covered is 480 miles, you can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{480 \\text{ miles}}{60 \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]\n\nNow, performing the division:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = 8 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, it will take the train 8 hours to reach its destination, assuming it maintains an average speed of 60 miles per hour without any stops or changes in speed.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n- **Stops:** If the train makes any stops along the way, you would need to add the time spent stopping to the total travel time.\n\n- **Speed Variations:** If the train's speed varies during the journey, you would need to account for these changes to calculate the exact travel time. The formula used here assumes a constant average speed.\n\n- **Units:** Ensure that the units for distance and speed are compatible. In this case, both are in miles and miles per hour, respectively, which makes the calculation straightforward.\n\nThis calculation provides a straightforward estimate based on the given average speed and distance."
