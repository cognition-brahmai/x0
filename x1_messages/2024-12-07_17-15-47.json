        "content": "To implement a Python script that scrapes a webpage for all links and images using the BeautifulSoup library and saves their URLs into separate text files, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure you have BeautifulSoup and requests libraries installed. You can install them using pip if you haven't already.\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install beautifulsoup4 requests\n    ```\n\n2. **Write the Script**: Create a Python script that does the following:\n   - Sends an HTTP request to the webpage.\n   - Parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.\n   - Finds all anchor (`<a>`) tags and extracts their `href` attributes.\n   - Finds all image (`<img>`) tags and extracts their `src` attributes.\n   - Writes the extracted URLs into separate text files for links and images.\n\nHere's a sample script to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\ndef fetch_urls(url):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an error for bad status codes\n    except requests.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching the URL: {e}\")\n        return None, None\n\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n    \n    # Extract all links\n    links = [a['href'] for a in soup.find_all('a', href=True)]\n    \n    # Extract all images\n    images = [img['src'] for img in soup.find_all('img', src=True)]\n    \n    return links, images\n\ndef save_to_file(data, filename):\n    with open(filename, 'w') as f:\n        for item in data:\n            f.write(f\"{item}\\n\")\n\ndef main():\n    url = input(\"Enter the URL to scrape: \")\n    links, images = fetch_urls(url)\n    \n    if links:\n        save_to_file(links, 'links.txt')\n        print(f\"Links saved to links.txt\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No links found.\")\n    \n    if images:\n        save_to_file(images, 'images.txt')\n        print(f\"Images saved to images.txt\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No images found.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Fetching the Webpage**: The `fetch_urls` function sends an HTTP GET request to the specified URL and parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.\n\n2. **Extracting Links and Images**: It finds all `<a>` tags with `href` attributes and all `<img>` tags with `src` attributes, extracting their URLs.\n\n3. **Saving to Files**: The `save_to_file` function writes the extracted URLs into text files, one for links and another for images.\n\n4. **Main Function**: This orchestrates the process by getting the URL from the user, fetching the URLs, and saving them to files.\n\n### Usage:\n\n- Run the script.\n- Enter the URL of the webpage you want to scrape when prompted.\n- The script will save the links and images URLs into `links.txt` and `images.txt`, respectively.\n\nThis script provides a basic framework for web scraping links and images from a webpage. Depending on your needs, you might want to handle relative URLs, add error handling, or scrape additional attributes."
