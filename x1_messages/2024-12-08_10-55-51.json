        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python script that interacts with a Memcached server. The script needs to let users store key-value pairs and retrieve values using keys. I'm not super familiar with Memcached, but I've used other caching systems before, so I think I can figure this out.\n\nFirst things first, I need to make sure that I have Memcached installed and running on my server. I believe Memcached is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generally used to speed up web applications by caching data and reducing database load. For this script, I'll assume that there's a Memcached server already set up and running somewhere, and I need to connect to it from my Python script.\n\nTo interact with Memcached in Python, I'll need to use a client library. I think the most common one is python-memcached. I should check if that's the best choice or if there are other libraries that might be better. Maybe I'll look that up quickly.\n\n[Simulates looking up information]\n\nOkay, so there are a few libraries available for Python to interact with Memcached, such as python-memcached, pymemcache, and CMemCache. Each has its own pros and cons, but for simplicity, I'll go with python-memcached for now. I can always switch later if needed.\n\nNext, I need to set up my Python environment. I should probably use virtualenv to create an isolated environment for this project. That way, I can manage dependencies easily without messing with the global Python installation.\n\nSo, first, I'll create a new directory for this project and set up a virtual environment there.\n\n```\nmkdir memcached_script\ncd memcached_script\npython -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n```\n\nWith the virtual environment activated, I can install python-memcached.\n\n```\npip install python-memcached\n```\n\nNow, I need to start writing the script. The script should be able to connect to a Memcached server, take user input for key-value pairs, store them in the cache, and also retrieve values based on keys.\n\nFirst, I need to import the necessary modules. In this case, I'll need `Client` from `memcache`.\n\n```python\nfrom memcache import Client\n```\n\nI need to know the server's address and port to connect to it. For now, I'll assume that the Memcached server is running locally on the default port, which is 11211. If the server is on a different machine or port, the user should be able to specify it.\n\nMaybe I'll prompt the user for the server address and port at the start of the script.\n\n```python\nserver = input(\"Enter Memcached server address (default: localhost:11211): \") or 'localhost:11211'\n```\n\nThen, I can create a `Client` object to connect to the server.\n\n```python\nmc = Client([server])\n```\n\nNow, I need to create a simple command-line interface where the user can choose to store a key-value pair or retrieve a value by key.\n\nI can use a loop that keeps asking the user for input until they decide to exit.\n\nPerhaps something like this:\n\n```\nMenu:\n1. Store key-value pair\n2. Retrieve value by key\n3. Exit\n\nEnter your choice:\n```\n\nBased on the choice, I'll perform the corresponding operation.\n\nFirst, if the user chooses to store a key-value pair, I'll ask for the key and the value, and then use the `set` method of the `Client` object to store it in the cache.\n\n```python\nif choice == '1':\n    key = input(\"Enter key: \")\n    value = input(\"Enter value: \")\n    mc.set(key, value)\n    print(\"Key-value pair stored successfully.\")\n```\n\nSecond, if the user chooses to retrieve a value by key, I'll ask for the key and use the `get` method to fetch the value from the cache.\n\n```python\nelif choice == '2':\n    key = input(\"Enter key: \")\n    value = mc.get(key)\n    if value is not None:\n        print(\"Value:\", value)\n    else:\n        print(\"Key not found.\")\n```\n\nFinally, if the user chooses to exit, I'll break out of the loop and end the script.\n\n```python\nelif choice == '3':\n    print(\"Goodbye!\")\n    break\n```\n\nI should also handle invalid choices by the user.\n\n```python\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n```\n\nPutting it all together, the script might look like this:\n\n```python\nfrom memcache import Client\n\nserver = input(\"Enter Memcached server address (default: localhost:11211): \") or 'localhost:11211'\nmc = Client([server])\n\nwhile True:\n    print(\"\\nMenu:\")\n    print(\"1. Store key-value pair\")\n    print(\"2. Retrieve value by key\")\n    print(\"3. Exit\")\n    \n    choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n    \n    if choice == '1':\n        key = input(\"Enter key: \")\n        value = input(\"Enter value: \")\n        mc.set(key, value)\n        print(\"Key-value pair stored successfully.\")\n    elif choice == '2':\n        key = input(\"Enter key: \")\n        value = mc.get(key)\n        if value is not None:\n            print(\"Value:\", value)\n        else:\n            print(\"Key not found.\")\n    elif choice == '3':\n        print(\"Goodbye!\")\n        break\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n```\n\nI should test this script to make sure it works as expected. I need to have Memcached installed and running on the specified server and port. If everything is set up correctly, I should be able to store and retrieve key-value pairs using this script.\n\nAlso, I should consider error handling. For example, if the server is unreachable, the `Client` object might raise an exception. I should catch such exceptions and inform the user appropriately.\n\nMaybe I'll add a try-except block when creating the `Client` object.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    mc = Client([server])\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"Error connecting to Memcached server:\", e)\n    exit(1)\n```\n\nAdditionally, I should think about data types. Memcached stores data as bytes, so I might need to handle encoding and decoding of strings.\n\nIn python-memcached, it seems that it handles string values, but I should ensure that the values are stored and retrieved as strings.\n\nAlso, keys in Memcached should be strings, and values can be strings or bytes. To keep it simple, I'll assume that both keys and values are strings.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of overwriting existing key-value pairs. If a user stores a new value with an existing key, the old value should be replaced.\n\nAnother thing to think about is the expiration time for the cached items. Memcached allows you to set a timeout for each item, after which it expires. For this script, I'll keep it simple and not set an expiration time, meaning the items will stay in the cache until they are manually removed or until the cache clears them for whatever reason.\n\nBut maybe I can add an option for the user to set an expiration time in seconds.\n\nI can modify the store operation to ask for an expiration time.\n\n```python\nif choice == '1':\n    key = input(\"Enter key: \")\n    value = input(\"Enter value: \")\n    expire = input(\"Enter expiration time in seconds (optional): \") or 0\n    mc.set(key, value, int(expire))\n    print(\"Key-value pair stored successfully.\")\n```\n\nThis way, if the user provides an expiration time, it will be used; otherwise, the default is 0, meaning never expire.\n\nSimilarly, when retrieving a value, I should handle the case where the key doesn't exist, which I've already done by checking if the value is `None`.\n\nI should also think about how to handle large values. Memcached has a limit on the size of items it can store, which is usually around 1MB. If a user tries to store a larger value, it will fail. I should perhaps inform the user about this limitation.\n\nAnother consideration is that Memcached is an in-memory store, meaning that data is lost when the server is restarted unless it's configured to persist data, which is not the default behavior. So, the script should make it clear that data stored in Memcached is volatile.\n\nFor now, I'll keep these considerations in mind but not implement additional features. The script is intended to be a simple demonstration of how to interact with Memcached using Python.\n\nI should also think about security. Since Memcached is typically intended for internal use, the script doesn't handle authentication or encryption. If the Memcached server requires authentication, the python-memcached library might support it, and I can adjust the script accordingly.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll assume that the Memcached server doesn't require authentication.\n\nLastly, I should make sure that the script is user-friendly and provides clear instructions and feedback.\n\nI can add some introductory messages and ensure that error messages are informative.\n\nHere's an improved version of the script with additional comments and minor enhancements:\n\n```python\nfrom memcache import Client\n\n# Prompt user for Memcached server address\nserver = input(\"Enter Memcached server address (default: localhost:11211): \") or 'localhost:11211'\n\n# Try to connect to the Memcached server\ntry:\n    mc = Client([server])\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"Error connecting to Memcached server:\", e)\n    exit(1)\n\nprint(\"Connected to Memcached server successfully.\")\n\n# Main loop for user interactions\nwhile True:\n    print(\"\\nMenu:\")\n    print(\"1. Store key-value pair\")\n    print(\"2. Retrieve value by key\")\n    print(\"3. Exit\")\n    \n    choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n    \n    if choice == '1':\n        key = input(\"Enter key: \")\n        value = input(\"Enter value: \")\n        expire = input(\"Enter expiration time in seconds (optional): \") or 0\n        mc.set(key, value, int(expire))\n        print(\"Key-value pair stored successfully.\")\n    elif choice == '2':\n        key = input(\"Enter key: \")\n        value = mc.get(key)\n        if value is not None:\n            print(\"Value:\", value)\n        else:\n            print(\"Key not found.\")\n    elif choice == '3':\n        print(\"Goodbye!\")\n        break\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n```\n\nI should test this script with a running Memcached server to ensure that it works as expected. I can start Memcached locally using the command `memcached -p 11211` and then run my Python script to store and retrieve some key-value pairs.\n\nIf everything works correctly, I can consider the task completed. If there are any issues, I'll need to debug and fix them accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Python script that connects to a Memcached server, stores, and retrieves key-value pairs, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. **Memcached Server**: Ensure Memcached is installed and running on your server. For local development, you can start Memcached using:\n   ```sh\n   memcached -p 11211\n   ```\n\n2. **Python Environment**: Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.\n   ```sh\n   python -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   ```\n\n3. **Install python-memcached**:\n   ```sh\n   pip install python-memcached\n   ```\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nfrom memcache import Client\n\n# Prompt user for Memcached server address\nserver = input(\"Enter Memcached server address (default: localhost:11211): \") or 'localhost:11211'\n\n# Try to connect to the Memcached server\ntry:\n    mc = Client([server])\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"Error connecting to Memcached server:\", e)\n    exit(1)\n\nprint(\"Connected to Memcached server successfully.\")\n\n# Main loop for user interactions\nwhile True:\n    print(\"\\nMenu:\")\n    print(\"1. Store key-value pair\")\n    print(\"2. Retrieve value by key\")\n    print(\"3. Exit\")\n    \n    choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n    \n    if choice == '1':\n        key = input(\"Enter key: \")\n        value = input(\"Enter value: \")\n        expire = input(\"Enter expiration time in seconds (optional): \") or 0\n        mc.set(key, value, int(expire))\n        print(\"Key-value pair stored successfully.\")\n    elif choice == '2':\n        key = input(\"Enter key: \")\n        value = mc.get(key)\n        if value is not None:\n            print(\"Value:\", value)\n        else:\n            print(\"Key not found.\")\n    elif choice == '3':\n        print(\"Goodbye!\")\n        break\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Connecting to Memcached**:\n   - The script prompts the user for the Memcached server address and port. It defaults to `localhost:11211` if no input is provided.\n   - It attempts to create a connection to the Memcached server using the `Client` class from the `memcache` module.\n\n2. **User Interaction**:\n   - A menu is displayed, allowing the user to choose between storing a key-value pair, retrieving a value by key, or exiting the script.\n   - If the user chooses to store a key-value pair, they are prompted for the key, value, and an optional expiration time in seconds.\n   - If the user chooses to retrieve a value, they are prompted for the key, and the corresponding value is fetched from the cache.\n\n3. **Error Handling**:\n   - The script includes basic error handling for connecting to the Memcached server and invalid user choices.\n\n4. **Dependencies**:\n   - Ensure `python-memcached` is installed in your Python environment.\n\nThis script provides a simple interface to interact with a Memcached server, suitable for caching data in applications to improve performance."
