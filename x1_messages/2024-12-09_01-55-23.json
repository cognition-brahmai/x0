These spectacular light shows are indeed caused by charged particles from the sun interacting with Earth's atmosphere near the magnetic poles. The colors are produced as these particles excite oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the atmosphere, which then emit light as they return to their normal state. It's a truly breathtaking natural phenomenon!"
