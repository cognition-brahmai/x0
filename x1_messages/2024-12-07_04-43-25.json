        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. The word is \"STATISTICS,\" and we need to find out how many ways we can arrange its letters so that no two S's are next to each other.\n\nFirst, let's see what letters we're dealing with and how many of each there are.\n\nThe word \"STATISTICS\" consists of the following letters:\n\n- S: there are 3 S's\n\n- T: there are 3 T's\n\n- A: there is 1 A\n\n- I: there are 2 I's\n\n- C: there is 1 C\n\nSo, in total, there are 10 letters.\n\nNow, the main condition is that no two S's are adjacent. To handle this, I think we can first arrange the other letters and then find the spots where we can place the S's without them being next to each other.\n\nLet's first arrange the letters that are not S's. These are T, A, T, I, I, T, C. Wait, actually, since there are 3 T's and 2 I's, the non-S letters are: T, T, T, A, I, I, C.\n\nSo, we have 7 letters: T, T, T, A, I, I, C.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many distinct ways to arrange these 7 letters.\n\nSince there are repeating letters, the number of distinct arrangements is given by the formula for permutations of multiset:\n\n\\[\\text{Number of arrangements} = \\frac{7!}{3! \\times 2! \\times 1! \\times 1!}\\]\n\nCalculating factorial:\n\n- 7! = 5040\n\n- 3! = 6\n\n- 2! = 2\n\n- 1! = 1 (for A and C)\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\n\\[\\text{Number of arrangements} = \\frac{5040}{6 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\times 1} = \\frac{5040}{12} = 420\\]\n\nSo, there are 420 distinct ways to arrange the 7 non-S letters.\n\nNow, we need to place the 3 S's into these arrangements in such a way that no two S's are adjacent.\n\nTo do this, let's think about the positions where we can place the S's.\n\nWhen we arrange the 7 non-S letters, there are 8 possible slots where S's can be placed, to ensure that no two S's are adjacent. These slots are:\n\n- Before the first letter\n\n- Between the first and second letter\n\n- Between the second and third letter\n\n- ...\n\n- After the seventh letter\n\nSo, for 7 letters, there are 8 possible slots for S's.\n\nWe need to choose 3 of these 8 slots to place one S each, ensuring that no two S's are in the same slot or adjacent slots.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 slots out of 8 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\\text{Number of ways} = \\binom{8}{3}\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8!}{3! \\times (8-3)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{6} = 56\\]\n\nSo, there are 56 ways to choose the positions for the S's.\n\nNow, to find the total number of arrangements where no two S's are adjacent, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the non-S letters by the number of ways to place the S's in the slots.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\\text{Total arrangements} = 420 \\times 56\\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[420 \\times 56 = 420 \\times 50 + 420 \\times 6 = 21,000 + 2,520 = 23,520\\]\n\nSo, there are 23,520 distinct ways to arrange the letters of \"STATISTICS\" such that no two S's are adjacent.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I think I might have missed something.\n\nActually, in the step where I calculated the number of ways to arrange the non-S letters, I used:\n\n\\[\\frac{7!}{3! \\times 2! \\times 1! \\times 1!} = 420\\]\n\nAnd then multiplied by the number of ways to place the S's, which is 56, giving 23,520.\n\nBut, I should confirm if there are indeed 8 slots for placing the S's when there are 7 non-S letters.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf we have 7 non-S letters arranged in a row, there are 8 possible slots for S's:\n\n1. Before the first letter\n\n2. Between the first and second letter\n\n3. Between the second and third\n\n4. ...\n\n5. After the seventh letter\n\nSo, yes, 8 slots.\n\nAnd we need to choose 3 of these 8 slots to place an S in each, ensuring no two S's are in the same slot or adjacent slots.\n\nThe combination formula \\(\\binom{8}{3}\\) seems correct for that.\n\nSo, multiplying by the number of arrangements of the non-S letters, which is 420, seems right.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements should be 23,520.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me consider another approach.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of arrangements without any restrictions.\n\nThen, subtract the number of arrangements where at least two S's are adjacent.\n\nBut, that might be more complicated, and it's easier to stick with the initial approach of separating the S's.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to first arrange the non-S letters, and then choose positions for the S's in the gaps between them.\n\nWhich is essentially what I did.\n\nSo, I believe 23,520 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{23520} \\]"
