        "content": "At its closest approach, which is called perihelic opposition, Mars is about 54.6 million kilometers (or about 0.365 astronomical units) from the Sun, and Earth is about 147.1 million kilometers from the Sun. So, the distance between Earth and Mars at this time would be approximately 147.1 million km minus 54.6 million km, which is about 92.5 million kilometers.\n\nHowever, since you asked about the time it takes for light from the Sun to reach Mars at its closest approach, we need to consider the distance from the Sun to Mars.\n\nAt perihelic opposition, Mars is about 54.6 million kilometers from the Sun.\n\nThe speed of light is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second.\n\nSo, the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun to Mars at this distance would be:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed of Light\n\nTime = 54,600,000 km / 299,792 km/s \u2248 182.1 seconds\n\nWhich is approximately 3 minutes and 2 seconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ minutes and } 2 \\text{ seconds}} \\]"
