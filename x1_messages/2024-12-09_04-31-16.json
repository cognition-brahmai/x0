        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 students in the class, and 12 of them are boys. So, the rest must be girls. To find out how many girls there are, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:\n\n30 students - 12 boys = 18 girls\n\nNow, the problem says that half of the boys wear glasses. So, I need to find out how many boys wear glasses:\n\nHalf of 12 boys = 12 / 2 = 6 boys wear glasses\n\nThe question is asking for the percentage of the entire class that wears glasses. So, I need to find out what percentage 6 boys represent out of the total 30 students.\n\nTo find the percentage, I can use the formula:\n\n( Part / Whole ) * 100 = Percentage\n\nIn this case, the \"part\" is the number of students who wear glasses, which is 6, and the \"whole\" is the total number of students, which is 30.\n\nSo,\n\n(6 / 30) * 100 = ?\n\nFirst, divide 6 by 30:\n\n6 \u00f7 30 = 0.2\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n0.2 * 100 = 20%\n\nTherefore, 20% of the entire class wears glasses.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem mentions that half of the boys wear glasses, but it doesn't say anything about girls wearing glasses. Does that mean no girls wear glasses?\n\nIf that's the case, then only 6 boys wear glasses, and the percentage calculation I did is correct.\n\nBut maybe some girls also wear glasses. The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I should assume that only boys wear glasses.\n\nNo, that would be incorrect. The problem only provides information about boys wearing glasses, but it doesn't exclude the possibility of girls wearing glasses as well.\n\nHowever, since it doesn't provide any information about girls wearing glasses, I have to assume that only boys wear glasses, based on the information given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intention is to consider only the boys who wear glasses for this calculation.\n\nGiven that, my initial calculation stands: 6 out of 30 students wear glasses, which is 20%.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other information I might be missing.\n\nThe class has 30 students: 12 boys and 18 girls.\n\nHalf of the boys wear glasses: 6 boys wear glasses.\n\nWithout information about girls wearing glasses, I'll assume that no girls wear glasses, although in reality, that might not be the case.\n\nTherefore, the total number of students who wear glasses is 6.\n\nTo find the percentage of the entire class that wears glasses:\n\n(6 / 30) * 100 = 20%\n\nSo, 20% of the class wears glasses.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that some girls might also wear glasses, but since I don't have that information, I can only work with the data provided.\n\nHence, the answer is 20%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20\\%} \\]"
