        "content": "To determine how many unique 4-digit numbers can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 without repeating any digit, we can use the concept of permutations. Since we are forming 4-digit numbers and no digit repeats, we are essentially looking for the number of ways to arrange these four distinct digits.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **First digit**: We have 4 choices (1, 2, 3, or 4).\n2. **Second digit**: After choosing the first digit, we have 3 remaining choices (since we cannot repeat the digit already used).\n3. **Third digit**: After choosing the first two digits, we have 2 remaining choices.\n4. **Fourth digit**: Finally, we have only 1 choice left for the last digit.\n\nTo find the total number of unique 4-digit numbers, we multiply the number of choices for each position:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 24 possible unique 4-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 without repeating any digit.\n\nAlternatively, this can be calculated using the formula for permutations of \\( n \\) distinct objects taken \\( r \\) at a time, which is denoted as \\( P(n, r) \\) or \\( _n P_r \\). In this case, \\( n = 4 \\) and \\( r = 4 \\), since we are using all four digits without repetition.\n\nThe formula for permutations is:\n\n\\[\nP(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{(n - r)!}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nP(4, 4) = \\frac{4!}{(4 - 4)!} = \\frac{4!}{0!} = \\frac{24}{1} = 24\n\\]\n\nThis confirms our earlier calculation that there are 24 unique 4-digit numbers possible.\n\nTo further illustrate, let's list out all possible combinations:\n\n1. 1234\n2. 1243\n3. 1324\n4. 1342\n5. 1423\n6. 1432\n7. 2134\n8. 2143\n9. 2314\n10. 2341\n11. 2413\n12. 2431\n13. 3124\n14. 3142\n15. 3214\n16. 3241\n17. 3412\n18. 3421\n19. 4123\n20. 4132\n21. 4213\n22. 4231\n23. 4312\n24. 4321\n\nAs you can see, there are indeed 24 unique combinations.\n\nIt's important to note that if the problem allowed for repeating digits, the calculation would be different. For example, if digits could be repeated, the number of possible 4-digit numbers would be \\( 4^4 = 256 \\), since there are 4 choices for each of the 4 positions. However, in this specific problem, repetition is not allowed, so the correct answer is 24.\n\nAdditionally, if the problem involved digits including zero or had other constraints (such as being an even number or greater than a certain value), the approach would need to be adjusted accordingly. But in this case, with the given digits and the constraint of no repetition, 24 is the correct total.\n\nI hope this detailed explanation helps!
