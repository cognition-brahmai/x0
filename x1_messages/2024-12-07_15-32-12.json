        "content": "So there are 5 apples and 7 oranges in a basket, making a total of 12 fruits. I need to find the probability of picking 2 apples and 1 orange when I randomly select 3 fruits without looking.\n\nFirst, I should remember that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to pick 3 fruits out of 12 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose 3 fruits from 12 is C(12, 3).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(12, 3) = 12! / (3! * (12 - 3)!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9!) / (3! \u00d7 9!)) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 1320 / 6 = 220.\n\nSo, there are 220 possible ways to choose any 3 fruits from the basket.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is picking 2 apples and 1 orange.\n\nThere are 5 apples, so the number of ways to choose 2 apples from 5 is C(5, 2).\n\nSimilarly, there are 7 oranges, so the number of ways to choose 1 orange from 7 is C(7, 1).\n\nI should calculate these combinations.\n\nFirst, C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!) = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3!) / (2! \u00d7 3!)) = (5 \u00d7 4) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 20 / 2 = 10.\n\nThen, C(7, 1) = 7! / (1! * (7 - 1)!) = (7 \u00d7 6!) / (1! \u00d7 6!)) = 7 / 1 = 7.\n\nNow, since these are independent choices (choosing apples and choosing oranges), the total number of favorable outcomes is the product of these two combinations.\n\nSo, favorable outcomes = C(5, 2) \u00d7 C(7, 1) = 10 \u00d7 7 = 70.\n\nFinally, the probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes, which is 70 / 220.\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 10: 70 \u00f7 10 = 7, and 220 \u00f7 10 = 22.\n\nSo, the probability is 7/22.\n\nWait, but I should check if this is the lowest terms. 7 and 22 have no common factors other than 1, so yes, 7/22 is the simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking 2 apples and 1 orange is 7/22.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{22}} \\]"
