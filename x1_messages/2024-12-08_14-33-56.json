        "content": "Let's see what we've got here. There's a sequence of numbers: 2, 6, 18, 54, and it asks for the 7th term. Hmm, first I need to figure out the pattern here.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 2, 6, 18, 54. It seems like each term is getting larger, which makes sense since it's a sequence. Let me see if there's a common ratio or difference between the terms.\n\nLet's check the ratio between consecutive terms:\n\n6 divided by 2 is 3.\n\n18 divided by 6 is 3.\n\n54 divided by 18 is 3.\n\nOkay, so each term is being multiplied by 3 to get the next term. So, this looks like a geometric sequence where the common ratio is 3.\n\nIn a geometric sequence, the nth term can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[a_n = a_1 \\times r^{(n-1)}\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(a_n\\) is the nth term,\n\n- \\(a_1\\) is the first term,\n\n- \\(r\\) is the common ratio,\n\n- \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\nIn this case, \\(a_1 = 2\\), \\(r = 3\\), and we need to find the 7th term, so \\(n = 7\\).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[a_7 = 2 \\times 3^{(7-1)} = 2 \\times 3^6\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate \\(3^6\\):\n\n\\[3^1 = 3\\]\\[3^2 = 9\\]\\[3^3 = 27\\]\\[3^4 = 81\\]\\[3^5 = 243\\]\\[3^6 = 729\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[a_7 = 2 \\times 729 = 1458\\]\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this to confirm? Maybe by continuing the pattern.\n\nStarting with 2:\n\n2 (first term)\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 (second term)\n\n6 \u00d7 3 = 18 (third term)\n\n18 \u00d7 3 = 54 (fourth term)\n\n54 \u00d7 3 = 162 (fifth term)\n\n162 \u00d7 3 = 486 (sixth term)\n\n486 \u00d7 3 = 1458 (seventh term)\n\nOkay, that matches the calculation using the formula. So, the 7th term is 1458.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if there could be another pattern that fits these numbers.\n\nIs there perhaps an arithmetic sequence here? Let's see:\n\nDifference between 6 and 2 is 4.\n\nDifference between 18 and 6 is 12.\n\nDifference between 54 and 18 is 36.\n\nThe differences are increasing by a factor of 3 each time: 4, 12, 36,...\n\nSo, it's not an arithmetic sequence with a constant difference, but the differences themselves are growing geometrically by a factor of 3.\n\nThis again supports the idea that it's a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 3.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see if the sequence can be defined by a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s say \\(a_n = 3 \\times a_{n-1}\\), with \\(a_1 = 2\\).\n\nThis matches the given terms:\n\n\\(a_1 = 2\\)\n\n\\(a_2 = 3 \\times 2 = 6\\)\n\n\\(a_3 = 3 \\times 6 = 18\\)\n\n\\(a_4 = 3 \\times 18 = 54\\)\n\nAnd so on, up to \\(a_7 = 3 \\times a_6 = 3 \\times 486 = 1458\\).\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the positions of the terms:\n\nTerm 1: 2\n\nTerm 2: 6\n\nTerm 3: 18\n\nTerm 4: 54\n\nTerm 5: 162\n\nTerm 6: 486\n\nTerm 7: 1458\n\nThis consistently follows the pattern of multiplying by 3.\n\nIs there any other pattern that could fit these numbers? For example, maybe an exponential function or something else.\n\nLet\u2019s consider if the sequence could be defined by an exponential function.\n\nIn a geometric sequence, the general form is \\(a_n = a \\times r^{n-1}\\), which is indeed an exponential function where the exponent is \\(n-1\\).\n\nIn this case, \\(a = 2\\) and \\(r = 3\\), so \\(a_n = 2 \\times 3^{n-1}\\).\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation for the 7th term.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes sequences can be defined by powers of numbers plus some constant, but in this case, the geometric progression seems to fit perfectly.\n\nJust to double-check, let's see if the ratio remains constant for all consecutive terms.\n\nGiven terms: 2, 6, 18, 54.\n\n6 \u00f7 2 = 3\n\n18 \u00f7 6 = 3\n\n54 \u00f7 18 = 3\n\nThe ratio is consistently 3, confirming it's a geometric sequence.\n\nTherefore, the 7th term is indeed 1458.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a mistake in calculation. Let's verify \\(3^6\\) again.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 2 \u00d7 729 = 1458.\n\nAlternatively, continuing the pattern:\n\n5th term: 54 \u00d7 3 = 162\n\n6th term: 162 \u00d7 3 = 486\n\n7th term: 486 \u00d7 3 = 1458\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nSo, the 7th term of the sequence is 1458.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1458} \\]"
