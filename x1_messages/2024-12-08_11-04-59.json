        "content": "Let's see here. The train travels 200 miles in total. It takes 4 hours for the first half and 5 hours for the second half. So, first, I need to find out what the first half and the second half of the journey are in terms of distance.\n\nThe total distance is 200 miles, so each half should be 100 miles. So, the first half is 100 miles in 4 hours, and the second half is another 100 miles in 5 hours.\n\nNow, average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, I need to find the total time taken for the entire 200 miles.\n\nFirst half: 100 miles in 4 hours.\n\nSecond half: 100 miles in 5 hours.\n\nSo, total time is 4 + 5 = 9 hours.\n\nTotal distance is 200 miles.\n\nTherefore, average speed is 200 miles divided by 9 hours.\n\nLet me calculate that: 200 divided by 9 is approximately 22.22 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, but the train is traveling at a constant speed. The problem says it travels at a constant speed. So, if it's constant speed, why does it take different times for each half of the journey?\n\nHmm, that doesn't make sense. If the speed is constant, the time should be the same for each half if the distances are equal.\n\nMaybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"A train travels at a constant speed for 200 miles. It takes 4 hours to complete the first half of the journey and 5 hours to complete the second half. What is the train's average speed for the entire journey?\"\n\nWait, if it's traveling at a constant speed, but taking different times for each half, that implies that the halves are not equal in distance.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the first half of the journey and the second half.\" So, it must be referring to equal distances.\n\nBut if it's moving at a constant speed, it shouldn't take different times for equal distances unless the speed isn't constant, which contradicts the statement.\n\nI'm confused now. Let's assume that \"half of the journey\" refers to the first 100 miles and the second 100 miles, even though it's said to be at a constant speed but taking different times.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps it's a trick question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the train is traveling at a constant speed but with stops or something, which is why it takes different times for each half.\n\nBut anyway, to find the average speed for the entire journey, I should use the total distance divided by the total time.\n\nTotal distance is 200 miles.\n\nTotal time is 4 hours plus 5 hours, which is 9 hours.\n\nSo, average speed is 200 miles / 9 hours \u2248 22.22 miles per hour.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the first half is 100 miles in 4 hours, that's a speed of 100 / 4 = 25 miles per hour.\n\nThe second half is 100 miles in 5 hours, which is 100 / 5 = 20 miles per hour.\n\nBut the problem says the train travels at a constant speed, which contradicts these speeds.\n\nWait, maybe the \"constant speed\" refers to the overall average speed, and the times for each half are given despite that.\n\nBut that seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"constant speed\" is a misstatement, and the train actually varies its speed.\n\nIn that case, the average speed would still be total distance over total time, which is 200 / 9 \u2248 22.22 mph.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the train travels the first half at one speed and the second half at another, and I need to find the average speed.\n\nBut the problem says \"at a constant speed,\" which is confusing given the differing times.\n\nMaybe I should consider that \"constant speed\" means the speed doesn't change, but perhaps there are stops or something else affecting the time.\n\nBut that seems too speculative.\n\nGiven the information, I think the best approach is to calculate the average speed as total distance divided by total time, which is 200 miles / 9 hours.\n\nSo, the average speed is approximately 22.22 miles per hour.\n\nBut to be precise, 200 divided by 9 is exactly 22.222... repeating.\n\nSo, I can write it as 22.22 miles per hour, rounding to two decimal places.\n\nAlternatively, it can be expressed as 22 miles and 0.22 miles, and since 1 mile is 5280 feet, 0.22 miles is about 116 feet.\n\nSo, 22 miles and 116 feet per hour.\n\nBut that's probably more detailed than necessary.\n\nAlternatively, it can be left as a fraction: 200/9 mph.\n\nSo, perhaps the best answer is 200/9 miles per hour, or approximately 22.22 miles per hour.\n\nBut I think the problem expects the approximate decimal value.\n\nTherefore, the train's average speed for the entire journey is approximately 22.22 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22.22} \\]"
