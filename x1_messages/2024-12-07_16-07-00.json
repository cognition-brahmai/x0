        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 2000 widgets per day, and 2% of them are defective. I need to find out how many non-defective widgets are produced in a month with 30 days.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many defective widgets are produced each day. If 2% are defective, then the number of defective widgets per day is 2% of 2000.\n\nSo, defective widgets per day = 2% of 2000 = (2/100) * 2000 = 40 widgets.\n\nNow, the total number of widgets produced per day is 2000, so the number of non-defective widgets per day would be total widgets minus defective widgets.\n\nNon-defective widgets per day = 2000 - 40 = 1960 widgets.\n\nNow, to find out the monthly production of non-defective widgets, I need to multiply the daily non-defective production by the number of days in the month.\n\nGiven that the month has 30 days, monthly non-defective production = 1960 * 30.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n1960 * 30 = 58,800 widgets.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, defective widgets per day: 2% of 2000.\n\n2% of 2000 = (2/100) * 2000 = 40 widgets. That seems correct.\n\nNon-defective per day: 2000 - 40 = 1960. That's fine.\n\nOver 30 days: 1960 * 30.\n\nLet me verify that multiplication.\n\n1960 * 30:\n\n1960 * 10 = 19,600\n\n19,600 * 3 = 58,800. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the factory produces 58,800 non-defective widgets in a month with 30 days.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to look at this? Maybe by calculating the percentage of non-defective widgets and then applying that to the monthly production.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nIf 2% are defective, then 98% are non-defective.\n\nSo, non-defective widgets per day = 98% of 2000 = (98/100) * 2000 = 1960 widgets.\n\nSame as before.\n\nNow, for 30 days: 1960 * 30 = 58,800.\n\nAlternatively, total monthly production = 2000 * 30 = 60,000 widgets.\n\nDefective monthly production = 2% of 60,000 = (2/100) * 60,000 = 1,200 widgets.\n\nNon-defective monthly production = total monthly production - defective monthly production = 60,000 - 1,200 = 58,800 widgets.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, the answer is 58,800 non-defective widgets per month.\n\nI think that's accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{58800} \\]"
