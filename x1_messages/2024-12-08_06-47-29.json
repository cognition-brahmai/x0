Consider traveling during the shoulder season or exploring lesser-known areas.\n\n- **Use Budget Travel Tools:** Take advantage of travel aggregators, discount codes, and loyalty programs to find the best deals on flights, hotels, and activities.\n\n- **Travel Light:** Check the baggage policies of airlines and consider traveling with only carry-on luggage to save on checked bag fees.\n\n- **Eat Like a Local:** Instead of dining at touristy restaurants, try local eateries and markets for cheaper and more authentic food experiences. You can also consider cooking your own meals if your accommodation allows it."
