        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company that sells two products, X and Y. The profit per unit for X is $10 and for Y is $15. They have a storage capacity of 500 units in total. Also, they need to maintain a ratio of 3:2 between products X and Y in their inventory. We need to find out the maximum profit they can achieve under these constraints.\n\nFirst, let's understand the ratio part. The ratio of X to Y is 3:2, which means for every 3 units of X, there are 2 units of Y. So, if we let the number of units of X be 3k and the number of units of Y be 2k, where k is a positive integer. This way, the ratio remains 3:2.\n\nNow, the total units are X + Y = 3k + 2k = 5k. But the storage capacity is 500 units, so 5k \u2264 500. From this, we can solve for k:\n\n5k \u2264 500\n\nk \u2264 100\n\nSo, the maximum integer value for k is 100.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the profit. Profit is given by the sum of the profits from X and Y.\n\nProfit = (Number of X units * Profit per X) + (Number of Y units * Profit per Y)\n\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of k:\n\nProfit = (3k * $10) + (2k * $15) = 30k + 30k = 60k\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to maximize k, given that k \u2264 100.\n\nSo, k = 100\n\nTherefore, the maximum profit is 60 * 100 = $6000\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check if there are any other constraints or if I've missed something.\n\nThe storage capacity is 500 units, and with k = 100, total units are 5*100 = 500, which fits exactly.\n\nAlso, the ratio is maintained at 3:2.\n\nProfits per unit are correctly applied.\n\nSo, yes, the maximum profit is $6000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6000} \\]"
