        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a stock that starts at $50. First, it increases by 10% in the first week, and then it decreases by 5% in the second week. We need to find out what the price is at the end of the second week.\n\nOkay, so starting with $50, a 10% increase in the first week means we need to calculate 10% of $50 and add that to the original price.\n\nFirst, let's find 10% of $50:\n\n10% of 50 = 0.10 * 50 = 5\n\nSo, the price after the first week is:\n\n50 + 5 = 55\n\nNow, in the second week, the stock decreases by 5%. This decrease is applied to the new price, which is $55.\n\nFirst, let's find 5% of $55:\n\n5% of 55 = 0.05 * 55 = 2.75\n\nSo, the price after the decrease is:\n\n55 - 2.75 = 52.25\n\nTherefore, at the end of the second week, the stock price is $52.25.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of multipliers. A 10% increase is the same as multiplying by 1.10, and a 5% decrease is the same as multiplying by 0.95.\n\nSo, starting with $50:\n\nAfter the first week: 50 * 1.10 = 55\n\nAfter the second week: 55 * 0.95 = 52.25\n\nSame result. Okay, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, we could compute the overall percentage change over the two weeks.\n\nFirst week: +10%\n\nSecond week: -5%\n\nBut we can't just add these percentages because the second percentage is applied to the new amount, not the original.\n\nWait, actually, to find the overall change, we can multiply the multipliers:\n\nOverall multiplier = 1.10 * 0.95 = 1.045\n\nSo, the overall change is a 4.5% increase.\n\nApplying that to the original price:\n\n50 * 1.045 = 52.25\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Suppose we calculate the final price directly.\n\nThe price after the first week is 110% of the original price.\n\nThe price after the second week is 95% of the price at the end of the first week.\n\nSo, final price = original price * 1.10 * 0.95 = 50 * 1.10 * 0.95 = 52.25\n\nOnce more, $52.25.\n\nI think it's clear that the price at the end of the second week is $52.25.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem that might lead to a different answer.\n\nHmm.
