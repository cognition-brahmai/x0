        "content": "So I've got this problem here about building a bridge. The bridge needs to span 1000 feet and support a maximum load of 10,000 tons. The company has two material options: steel and concrete. I need to figure out which one is more cost-effective, considering both the cost and the load-bearing capacity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"cost-effective\" means in this context. I think it means choosing the material that can meet the load requirements at the lowest cost. So, I need to calculate the total cost for each material and see which one is cheaper while still being able to support the required load.\n\nLet's start by noting down the given data:\n\n- Span: 1000 feet\n\n- Maximum load: 10,000 tons\n\n- Steel:\n\n- Cost: $150 per square foot\n\n- Strength: 250 psi\n\n- Concrete:\n\n- Cost: $100 per square foot\n\n- Strength: 200 psi\n\nHmm, okay. I need to find out how much material (in square feet) is needed for each option to support the 10,000-ton load. Then, I can multiply that by the cost per square foot to get the total cost for each material.\n\nBut wait, tons and psi are different units. Psi is pounds per square inch, and tons are a measure of weight. I need to make sure all units are consistent.\n\nFirst, let's convert the load from tons to pounds because psi is in pounds.\n\nI know that 1 ton is equal to 2000 pounds. So, 10,000 tons would be:\n\n10,000 tons * 2000 lbs/ton = 20,000,000 pounds.\n\nOkay, so the bridge needs to support 20,000,000 pounds.\n\nNow, psi is pounds per square inch. So, the strength of the material is given in terms of pressure it can withstand per square inch.\n\nBut the cost is given per square foot. So, I need to make sure I'm using consistent area units.\n\nThere are 144 square inches in a square foot (since 12 inches * 12 inches = 144 square inches).\n\nSo, perhaps I should convert the strength from psi to pounds per square foot.\n\nLet's do that.\n\nFor steel:\n\n250 psi * 144 square inches/square foot = 250 * 144 = 36,000 pounds per square foot.\n\nFor concrete:\n\n200 psi * 144 square inches/square foot = 200 * 144 = 28,800 pounds per square foot.\n\nOkay, so steel can support 36,000 pounds per square foot, and concrete can support 28,800 pounds per square foot.\n\nNow, the total load the bridge needs to support is 20,000,000 pounds.\n\nAssuming that the load is distributed uniformly across the bridge, I need to find out how much area of each material is required to support this load.\n\nLet's assume that the bridge is a simple beam spanning 1000 feet, and the load is uniformly distributed along its length.\n\nFirst, I need to find the total area required for each material to support the load.\n\nFor steel:\n\nEach square foot can support 36,000 pounds.\n\nSo, the required area for steel is:\n\nTotal load / load per square foot = 20,000,000 lbs / 36,000 lbs/sq ft = 555.56 square feet.\n\nFor concrete:\n\nEach square foot can support 28,800 pounds.\n\nSo, the required area for concrete is:\n\n20,000,000 lbs / 28,800 lbs/sq ft = 694.44 square feet.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost for each option.\n\nFor steel:\n\n555.56 sq ft * $150/sq ft = $83,334.\n\nFor concrete:\n\n694.44 sq ft * $100/sq ft = $69,444.\n\nHmm, so based on this, concrete seems cheaper at $69,444 compared to steel at $83,334.\n\nBut wait a minute, I might be missing something here. This just considers the material cost based on the area needed to support the load, but it doesn't take into account the actual structure of the bridge.\n\nIn reality, the bridge's design would affect how the load is distributed and how much material is actually needed. For example, the bridge might have multiple supports, or the material might be used in beams or decks, each with different load-bearing requirements.\n\nAlso, the span of the bridge is 1000 feet, but I haven't considered the width of the bridge. The area I calculated is just the total area of material needed to support the load, but in reality, the bridge has a certain width and thickness, which would affect the amount of material used.\n\nMaybe I need to think about the bridge's cross-section and how the load is supported.\n\nLet's try a different approach.\n\nAssume the bridge is a simple beam with length L = 1000 feet, and it needs to support a uniform load w pounds per foot.\n\nFirst, convert the total load to a uniform load per foot.\n\nTotal load = 20,000,000 pounds.\n\nAssume the bridge is one way, so the uniform load w is:\n\nw = total load / span = 20,000,000 lbs / 1000 ft = 20,000 lbs/ft.\n\nNow, for a simple beam, the maximum moment M is given by:\n\nM = (w * L^2)/8.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nM = (20,000 lbs/ft * (1000 ft)^2)/8 = (20,000 * 1,000,000)/8 = 20,000,000,000 / 8 = 2,500,000,000 ft-lbs.\n\nWait, that seems too high. Maybe I need to check the formula for the maximum moment in a simple beam with uniform load.\n\nActually, for a simply supported beam with uniform load, the maximum moment is indeed (w * L^2)/8.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider the actual design of the bridge. Maybe it's not a simple beam but has multiple supports.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the material's strength in terms of stress and the required section properties.\n\nLet's recall that stress is force over area, and for beams, the bending stress is given by \u03c3 = M * y / I, where M is the bending moment, y is the distance from the neutral axis to the outer fiber, and I is the moment of inertia of the cross-section.\n\nBut this is getting complicated, and I might not have enough information to proceed with that level of detail.\n\nMaybe I should stick to the initial approach, considering the total load and the load-bearing capacity per unit area.\n\nIn that case, concrete seems cheaper at $69,444 compared to steel at $83,334.\n\nHowever, there are other factors to consider, such as the weight of the materials themselves. Steel is heavier than concrete, which might affect the total load the bridge has to support.\n\nWait, steel is actually heavier than concrete. Let's check the densities.\n\nTypical density of steel is about 490 pounds per cubic foot, while concrete is around 150 pounds per cubic foot.\n\nSo, steel is heavier. But in this problem, the load is given as 10,000 tons, which likely includes the dead load (weight of the bridge itself) and live loads (traffic, etc.). Since the problem specifies a maximum load of 10,000 tons, I think it's safe to assume that this load includes the weight of the bridge material.\n\nTherefore, I don't need to account for the material's self-weight separately.\n\nAnother factor is the durability and maintenance costs. Steel might require more maintenance due to corrosion, while concrete might require regular sealing. However, since the problem doesn't provide information on maintenance costs, I'll ignore this aspect.\n\nAlso, concrete might have lower strength, but it could be reinforced with steel bars to increase its strength. But again, without specific information, I'll proceed with the given strengths.\n\nSo, based on the initial calculation, concrete seems more cost-effective.\n\nBut let's consider another angle. Maybe the cost per square foot already factors in the material's properties, and I need to think about the thickness required for each material.\n\nLet's assume that the bridge deck is a slab of material with thickness t.\n\nThe volume of material would be area * thickness, but since cost is per square foot ( likely meaning per square foot of deck area), perhaps the thickness is already factored in.\n\nWait, actually, the cost is given per square foot of material, which might refer to the area of the material used.\n\nBut in reality, materials like steel and concrete are often used in different ways in bridge construction. Steel might be used in beams or girders, while concrete is used in deck slabs.\n\nMaybe I should consider the required thickness for each material to support the load.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, find the stress in the material.\n\nAssuming the material is under uniform compression, the stress \u03c3 is equal to the total load divided by the total area.\n\nSo, \u03c3 = total load / total area.\n\nWe can rearrange this to find the required area: area = total load / \u03c3.\n\nThis is similar to what I did earlier.\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nSo, for steel, area = 20,000,000 lbs / 36,000 lbs/sq ft = 555.56 sq ft.\n\nFor concrete, area = 20,000,000 lbs / 28,800 lbs/sq ft = 694.44 sq ft.\n\nNow, if the bridge deck has a certain width, say W feet, then the area of the material would be W * L, where L is the length (1000 feet).\n\nBut I don't know the width of the bridge.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the area refers to the cross-sectional area of the supporting structure.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nPerhaps I need to make some assumptions about the bridge design.\n\nLet's assume that the bridge has a deck made of either steel or concrete, and the deck needs to support the load.\n\nAssume the deck is a simply supported beam with length 1000 feet and width W feet.\n\nThe volume of the deck would be W * L * t, where t is the thickness of the deck.\n\nThe weight of the deck itself would be volume * density.\n\nBut since the load includes the weight of the bridge, I need to account for that.\n\nThis is getting complicated quickly.\n\nMaybe I should consider using the concept of allowable stress design.\n\nIn allowable stress design, the maximum stress in the material should not exceed its allowable stress value, which is given here as the strength in psi.\n\nSo, for steel, allowable stress is 250 psi, and for concrete, it's 200 psi.\n\nNow, for a beam, the maximum bending stress is given by \u03c3 = M * c / I, where M is the bending moment, c is the distance from the neutral axis to the outer fiber, and I is the moment of inertia.\n\nBut without knowing the cross-sectional properties, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the load per unit width, assuming the bridge has a unit width.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the bridge has a unit width of 1 foot.\n\nThen, the uniform load w would be 20,000 lbs/ft (as calculated earlier).\n\nBut that seems too high. Maybe the 10,000 tons is the total load, so the uniform load per foot would be different.\n\nWait, earlier I calculated w = 20,000 lbs/ft, assuming the total load is 20,000,000 lbs over 1000 ft.\n\nBut that would mean w = 20,000 lbs/ft, which seems very heavy for a bridge.\n\nMaybe I need to reconsider the total load.\n\nWait, perhaps the 10,000 tons is the live load, and I need to add the dead load (weight of the bridge itself).\n\nIn that case, the total load would be dead load plus live load.\n\nBut the problem says \"maximum load of 10,000 tons,\" which likely includes both dead and live loads.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 10,000 tons is only the live load, and I need to add the dead load separately.\n\nThis is getting tricky.\n\nPerhaps I should simplify the problem and assume that the material's strength is sufficient to support the load with a certain safety factor, and just compare the costs based on the material areas required.\n\nGiven that, concrete seems cheaper.\n\nBut let's consider the cost per unit load supported.\n\nFor steel:\n\nCost per pound supported = $150/sq ft / 36,000 lbs/sq ft = $150 / 36,000 = $0.00417 per pound.\n\nFor concrete:\n\n$100/sq ft / 28,800 lbs/sq ft = $100 / 28,800 = $0.00347 per pound.\n\nSo, concrete is cheaper per pound of load supported.\n\nTherefore, for the total load of 20,000,000 pounds, the total cost would be:\n\nConcrete: 20,000,000 * $0.00347 = $69,400.\n\nSteel: 20,000,000 * $0.00417 = $83,400.\n\nAgain, concrete is cheaper.\n\nBut perhaps there are other factors to consider, like the weight of the material itself affecting the total load.\n\nLet's try to account for that.\n\nAssume the deck is made of steel or concrete with a certain thickness.\n\nLet's denote the thickness as t (in feet).\n\nThen, the volume of the material is W * L * t, where W is the width, L is the length (1000 ft).\n\nThe weight of the material is volume * density.\n\nFor steel, density is about 490 lbs/cubic ft.\n\nFor concrete, it's about 150 lbs/cubic ft.\n\nNow, the total load the bridge needs to support is the dead load (weight of the bridge) plus the live load.\n\nGiven that the total load is 10,000 tons (20,000,000 lbs), and assuming that includes both dead and live loads, I need to make sure that the dead load plus live load does not exceed this total load.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to separate the dead load and live load.\n\nLet's assume that the total load is the sum of dead load and live load.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nDead load (D) = W * L * t * density\n\nLive load (L LIVE) = 10,000 tons - D\n\nBut actually, in bridge design, live load is the moving load, and dead load is the weight of the bridge itself.\n\nBut in this problem, it's given as a maximum load of 10,000 tons, which likely includes both.\n\nThis is getting too involved for the level of detail provided.\n\nMaybe I should stick with the initial approach.\n\nGiven that, concrete seems more cost-effective.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the cost per unit strength.\n\nSteel costs $150/sq ft and provides 36,000 lbs/sq ft of strength.\n\nSo, cost per unit strength = $150 / 36,000 = $0.00417 per pound.\n\nConcrete costs $100/sq ft and provides 28,800 lbs/sq ft of strength.\n\nCost per unit strength = $100 / 28,800 = $0.00347 per pound.\n\nAgain, concrete is cheaper per pound of strength provided.\n\nTherefore, for the same load, concrete would be cheaper.\n\nBut perhaps steel is stronger and might require less material, offsetting its higher cost per square foot.\n\nWait, but in the initial calculation, steel required 555.56 sq ft at $150/sq ft, totaling $83,334, while concrete required 694.44 sq ft at $100/sq ft, totaling $69,444.\n\nSo, even though steel requires less area, its higher cost per square foot makes it more expensive in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, concrete is more cost-effective.\n\nHowever, there are other factors to consider in actual bridge design, such as durability, maintenance, and construction time, but given the information provided, concrete seems to be the more cost-effective choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Concrete is more cost-effective for this bridge project.}} \\]"
