        "content": "Despite being primarily made of brass, the saxophone is classified as a woodwind instrument. This classification is based on the method of sound production, which involves a reed vibrating against a mouthpiece, similar to other woodwind instruments like the clarinet or oboe. The material from which it is made does not determine its instrumental family; rather, it's the way the sound is produced that dictates its classification."
