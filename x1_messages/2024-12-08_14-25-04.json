You're looking for a part of the eye that's an anagram of \"retain.\" So, I need to rearrange the letters in \"retain\" to form the name of an eye part.\n\nFirst, let's list out the letters in \"retain\": R, E, T, A, I, N.\n\nNow, thinking about the different parts of the eye. There's the retina, cornea, iris, pupil, lens, and so on.\n\nHmm, \"retina\" seems familiar. Let me check if that's an anagram of \"retain.\" Retina has R, E, T, I, N, A. Comparing that to \"retain,\" which has R, E, T, A, I, N\u2014it looks like the same letters, just arranged differently.\n\nYes, \"retina\" is an anagram of \"retain.\" So, that should be the answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there are any other parts of the eye that could be an anagram of \"retain.\" For example, \"cornea\" has C, O, R, N, E, A, which doesn't match the letters in \"retain.\" \"Iris\" is I, R, I, S, which doesn't match either. \"Pupil\" is P, U, P, I, L, not a match. \"Lens\" is L, E, N, S, no match.\n\nSo, it seems that \"retina\" is the only part of the eye that is an anagram of \"retain.\" Therefore, the answer is retina.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{retina}} \\]"
