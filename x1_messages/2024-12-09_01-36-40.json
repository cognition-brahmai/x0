        "content": "Quantitative determination of an unknown compound in a complex mixture can be a challenging task in analytical chemistry, and the choice of technique depends on several factors, including the nature of the compound, the complexity of the mixture, and the desired level of sensitivity and selectivity.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Mass Spectrometry (MS): Mass spectrometry is a powerful technique for identifying and quantifying compounds based on their mass-to-charge ratio. It can provide molecular weight information and structural details through fragmentation patterns. However, for quantitative analysis, MS requires calibration with standards and consideration of matrix effects, especially in complex mixtures.\n\nB. Infrared Spectroscopy (IR): IR spectroscopy is primarily used for qualitative analysis to identify functional groups in molecules based on their absorption of infrared radiation. While it can provide some quantitative information, it is less sensitive and specific for quantitative determination in complex mixtures compared to other techniques.\n\nC. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR): NMR spectroscopy is a versatile technique that provides detailed structural information about molecules. It can be used for quantitative analysis, especially in homogeneous samples. However, NMR is generally slower and less sensitive than other techniques, making it less ideal for complex mixtures where speed and sensitivity are crucial.\n\nD. Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-Vis): UV-Vis spectroscopy measures the absorption of light in the ultraviolet and visible regions and is commonly used for quantitative analysis of compounds that absorb in these regions. It is relatively simple, fast, and inexpensive. However, its applicability depends on the compound's absorbance properties, and in complex mixtures, overlapping absorbance bands can complicate quantitation.\n\nE. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC): HPLC is a separation technique that can be coupled with various detectors for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. It is particularly useful for separating components in complex mixtures based on their different interactions with the stationary and mobile phases. When coupled with a suitable detector, such as a UV-Vis detector, photodiode array detector, or mass spectrometer, HPLC can provide high sensitivity and selectivity for quantitative determination of unknown compounds in complex mixtures.\n\nConsidering these points, HPLC appears to be the most appropriate technique for the quantitative determination of an unknown compound in a complex mixture due to its separation capabilities and the flexibility to couple with different detectors for detection and quantitation.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that in practice, the choice of technique might involve a combination of methods. For example, HPLC can be coupled with MS detection (HPLC-MS) for enhanced specificity and identification in complex samples.\n\nIn summary, while all the mentioned techniques have their strengths, HPLC, especially when coupled with suitable detectors, is generally the most appropriate choice for quantitative determination of an unknown compound in a complex mixture.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{E} \\]"
