        "content": "Certainly! To implement a Python function that finds both the largest and smallest numbers in a list, we can iterate through the list once, keeping track of the current smallest and largest values. This approach ensures efficiency, with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the process:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by assuming the first element of the list is both the smallest and largest number.\n2. **Iteration**: Loop through each number in the list starting from the second element.\n3. **Comparison**: For each number, check if it is smaller than the current smallest or larger than the current largest. Update the smallest or largest accordingly.\n4. **Return**: After completing the loop, return the smallest and largest numbers.\n\nThis method is efficient because it only requires a single pass through the list, making it suitable for large lists.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the smallest and largest numbers in a list efficiently. The approach involves iterating through the list once while maintaining the current smallest and largest values.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initialization**: Assume the first element is both the smallest and largest.\n2. **Iteration**: Traverse the list starting from the second element.\n3. **Comparison**: Update the smallest and largest values as needed for each element.\n4. **Return**: Provide the final smallest and largest values.\n\nThis approach ensures a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, making it efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef find_smallest_largest(numbers):\n    if not numbers:\n        return None, None  # Return None if the list is empty\n    \n    smallest = largest = numbers[0]  # Initialize smallest and largest to the first element\n    \n    for num in numbers[1:]:\n        if num < smallest:\n            smallest = num\n        elif num > largest:\n            largest = num\n    \n    return smallest, largest\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by checking if the list is empty and return `None` for both smallest and largest if it is. Otherwise, we initialize both smallest and largest to the first element of the list.\n2. **Iteration**: We loop through the remaining elements of the list.\n3. **Comparison**: For each number, we check:\n   - If it is smaller than the current `smallest`, update `smallest`.\n   - If it is larger than the current `largest`, update `largest`.\n4. **Return**: After the loop, we return the `smallest` and `largest` values found.\n\nThis method ensures that we only traverse the list once, making it an efficient solution for finding the smallest and largest numbers in a list."
