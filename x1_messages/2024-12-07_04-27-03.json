        "content": "Let's see. The farmer starts with 20 cows and 10 chickens. So, total animals initially are 20 + 10 = 30.\n\nThen, it says \"all but 8 cows die.\" So, that means 20 - 8 = 12 cows die, and 8 cows survive.\n\nNow, the chickens are not mentioned as dying, so all 10 chickens are still alive.\n\nSo, the total animals left should be the surviving cows plus the chickens, which is 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I'm understanding \"all but 8 cows die\" correctly. \"All but 8\" means that except for 8 cows, the rest die. So, yes, 8 cows survive.\n\nAnd the chickens are unaffected by this statement, so they remain the same.\n\nTherefore, the farmer has 8 cows and 10 chickens left, totaling 18 animals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
