So, I can't tell you what fresh coffee smells like to me because I don't have personal experiences or senses. However, I can describe it based on how humans often perceive it. Fresh coffee typically has a rich, aromatic smell that can be described as warm, earthy, and slightly bitter, with hints of roasted grains and sometimes a touch of sweetness. The aroma can vary depending on the type of coffee beans, the roast level, and the brewing method used."
