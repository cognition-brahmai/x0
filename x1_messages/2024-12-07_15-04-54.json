        "content": "So I have this book with 200 pages, and I plan to read 20 pages each day. I need to figure out how many days it will take me to finish the whole book. Hmm, this seems like a straightforward division problem.\n\nFirst, I'll take the total number of pages in the book, which is 200, and divide that by the number of pages I plan to read per day, which is 20. So, 200 divided by 20 should give me the number of days required.\n\nLet me do the math: 200 \u00f7 20 equals 10. So, it should take me 10 days to finish the book if I read 20 pages each day.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect this. For example, what if I don't read every day? What if I take some days off? But according to the question, I'm reading 20 pages per day consistently, without any breaks. So, in that case, 10 days seems correct.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the book has any illustrations or appendices that might affect the reading time, but since the question just states that the book has 200 pages and I read 20 pages per day, I think it's safe to assume that all pages are readable content.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm not misinterpreting the units or anything like that. Pages are a standard measure for books, and reading at a rate of pages per day is straightforward. No need to convert units or anything.\n\nLet me think about it differently to confirm. If I read 20 pages per day, after one day I'll have read 20 pages, leaving 180 pages. After two days, 40 pages read, leaving 160 pages, and so on. So, continuing this pattern, after 10 days, I would have read 200 pages, which is the entire book.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the total pages divided by pages per day giving the number of days. Again, 200 \u00f7 20 equals 10 days.\n\nI think this is pretty straightforward, but to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe using multiplication? If I read 20 pages per day, then in 10 days, 20 times 10 equals 200 pages. That checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to graph this, with days on one axis and pages read on the other, it would be a straight line with a slope of 20 pages per day, and I'd reach 200 pages at the 10-day mark.\n\nBut honestly, that might be overcomplicating things for this simple problem. The basic division approach seems sufficient and accurate.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I'll consider what would happen if I read a different number of pages per day. For example, if I read 10 pages per day, it would take 20 days to finish the book. If I read 25 pages per day, it would take 8 days. So, adjusting the daily reading amount affects the total time accordingly.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, it will take 10 days to finish a 200-page book if I read 20 pages per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
