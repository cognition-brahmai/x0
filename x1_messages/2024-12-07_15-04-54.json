        "content": "I've heard that rumor before, but it's not entirely accurate. Daddy longlegs, also known as harvest spiders or harvestmen, are often confused with another type of spider called the crane fly. The belief is that they have extremely toxic venom, but their fangs are too small to penetrate human skin.\n\nFirst off, it's essential to clarify that not all daddy longlegs are spiders. Harvestmen, which are often referred to as daddy longlegs, are not actually spiders; they belong to a different order called Opiliones. These creatures have only two body segments and no silk glands, which distinguishes them from spiders.\n\nNow, regarding the toxicity claim, there's a bit of confusion here. Some sources suggest that the venom of certain species of Opiliones could be harmful, but in reality, most harvestmen do not possess venom glands at all. They primarily feed on small insects, plant material, and decaying matter.\n\nOn the other hand, there is another type of arachnid often called \"daddy longlegs\" that belongs to the spider family Pholcidae. These are sometimes referred to as cellar spiders. These spiders do have fangs and venom, but their venom is relatively mild and not considered dangerous to humans. Bites from pholcid spiders are rare and typically cause only minor irritation.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the idea that daddy longlegs are the most venomous spiders but can't bite humans is a myth. Harvestmen aren't even spiders and mostly don't have venom, while the pholcid spiders have mild venom that isn't harmful to humans. It's always important to get accurate information about such topics to avoid unnecessary fear or confusion."
