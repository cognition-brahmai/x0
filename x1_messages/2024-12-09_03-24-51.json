        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a cylindrical water tank. The tank has a diameter of 10 feet and a height of 12 feet. It's filled up to 80% of its capacity, and I need to find out how many gallons of water that is. The note says that 1 cubic foot equals 7.48 gallons, which will probably come in handy.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the volume of the cylinder because the amount of water it can hold depends on its volume. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nI know the diameter is 10 feet, so the radius is half of that, which is 5 feet. The height is 12 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, I get:\n\nV = \u03c0*(5)^2*(12)\n\nV = \u03c0*25*12\n\nV = \u03c0*300\n\nNow, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so:\n\nV \u2248 3.1416*300\n\nV \u2248 942.48 cubic feet\n\nBut the tank is only filled up to 80% of its capacity, so I need to find 80% of the total volume.\n\n80% of 942.48 cubic feet is:\n\n0.8 * 942.48 \u2248 753.984 cubic feet\n\nNow, since 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons, I can find the number of gallons by multiplying the volume in cubic feet by 7.48.\n\nSo, gallons = 753.984 * 7.48\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 753.984 * 7 = 5277.888\n\nThen, 753.984 * 0.48 = 361.89232\n\nAdding them together: 5277.888 + 361.89232 \u2248 5639.78032 gallons\n\nRounding to the nearest gallon, that would be approximately 5640 gallons.\n\nSo, the tank contains about 5640 gallons of water when filled to 80% of its capacity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5640} \\]"
