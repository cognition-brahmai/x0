Gothic Architecture**\n\n- **Key Characteristics:** Gothic architecture is known for its pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses. These elements allowed for taller, more spacious buildings with large windows and an overall sense of verticality. Ornamentation includes intricate details like gargoyles, rose windows, and elaborate stone carvings.\n\n- **Time Period:** This style emerged in the mid-12th century in France and continued through the 16th century, influencing buildings across Europe.\n\n- **Notable Examples:**\n  - **Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris:** A prime example of French Gothic architecture, featuring stunning rose windows and intricate sculptures.\n  - **Westminster Abbey in London:** Known for its beautiful fan vaulting and historical significance as the site of British coronations.\n\n**2. Renaissance Architecture**\n\n- **Key Characteristics:** Renaissance architecture is characterized by symmetry, proportion, and a return to classical orders (Doric, Ionic, Corinthian). It emphasizes harmony and rationality, often incorporating elements like domes, pilasters, and colonnades.\n\n- **Time Period:** This style flourished in Italy during the 14th to 17th centuries and spread throughout Europe.\n\n- **Notable Examples:**\n  - **St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City:** Designed by architects like Bramante, Michelangelo, and Bernini, it features a large dome and classical detailing.\n  - **Palazzo Rucellai in Florence:** An early Renaissance building that showcases the use of rustication and classical orders.\n\n**3. Baroque Architecture**\n\n- **Key Characteristics:** Baroque architecture is distinguished by its dramatic use of light, ornate decoration, and dynamic forms. It often features curved lines, richly colored materials, and a sense of movement and tension.\n\n- **Time Period:** This style dominated European architecture from the late 16th to the mid-18th century.\n\n- **Notable Examples:**\n  - **Palace of Versailles in France:** Known for its opulent interiors, extensive gardens, and the Hall of Mirrors.\n  - **St. Paul's Cathedral in London:** Designed by Sir Christopher Wren, it features a large dome and baroque elements.\n\n**4. Modernist Architecture**\n\n- **Key Characteristics:** Modernist architecture emphasizes function over form, often using new materials like steel, glass, and concrete. It rejects ornamental details in favor of clean lines, open floor plans, and an integration with nature.\n\n- **Time Period:** This style emerged in the early 20th century and continues to influence contemporary architecture today.\n\n- **Notable Examples:**\n  - **Villa Savoye in Poissy, France:** Designed by Le Corbusier, it exemplifies the principles of modernism with its white walls, long horizontal windows, and roof garden.\n  - **Seagram Building in New York City:** A seminal work by Mies van der Rohe, known for its sleek glass and steel fa\u00e7ade and minimalist design.\n\nEach of these styles reflects the cultural, technological, and artistic trends of their respective eras, leaving a lasting impact on the built environment."
