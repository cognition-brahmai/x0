        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got 40 people in a room, and each one knows exactly 3 others. The question is asking us to prove that there must be at least two people who know the same number of other people in the room. Hmm, but wait a second, it says each person knows exactly 3 others, so doesn't that mean everyone knows the same number of people, which is 3?\n\nLet me read it again to make sure I understand correctly. \"Each person knows exactly 3 others.\" So, if everyone knows exactly 3 others, then doesn't that mean that the number of people each person knows is always 3? In that case, isn't it obvious that at least two people know the same number of others, since everyone knows the same number?\n\nBut maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe it's a trick question or there's more to it. Let's think about it differently. Perhaps the question is trying to say that in a room of 40 people, where each person knows exactly 3 others, we need to prove that there are at least two people who have the same number of acquaintances within the room.\n\nWait, but if each person knows exactly 3 others, then the number of acquaintances each person has is 3. So, everyone has exactly 3 acquaintances. Therefore, doesn't that mean that all 40 people have the same number of acquaintances, which is 3?\n\nIf that's the case, then it's clear that there are at least two people who know the same number of other people, because everyone knows the same number, which is 3.\n\nBut maybe the question is trying to generalize a principle or something. Let me consider if there's another way to interpret it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is meant to be more general, like in a group of n people where each person knows k others, and we're supposed to prove something about their acquaintanceship.\n\nBut no, the specific numbers are given: 40 people, each knows exactly 3 others.\n\nLet me try to think about this in terms of graph theory, since relationships like this can be modeled as graphs. In graph theory, each person can be represented as a vertex, and an edge between two vertices indicates that those two people know each other.\n\nSo, in this case, we have a graph with 40 vertices, and each vertex has a degree of 3, because each person knows exactly 3 others.\n\nNow, the question is asking to prove that there are at least two people who know the same number of other people. In graph theory terms, that would mean proving that there are at least two vertices with the same degree.\n\nBut in this specific graph, every vertex has degree 3, so all vertices have the same degree. Therefore, not only are there at least two vertices with the same degree, but all 40 vertices have the same degree.\n\nSo, the statement is trivially true in this case.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the question is misstated or misremembered. Perhaps it's asking something different.\n\nLet me consider if the question is: \"Prove that in a group of 40 people, where each person knows exactly 3 others, there must be at least two people who have the same number of mutual acquaintances.\"\n\nThat would be a different problem altogether.\n\nIn that case, we'd need to look at the number of mutual acquaintances between pairs of people.\n\nBut that doesn't seem directly related to the initial question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is: \"In a group of 40 people, each knowing exactly 3 others, prove that there are at least two people who have the same number of people who know them.\"\n\nBut again, in this setup, since each person knows exactly 3 others, and assuming that \"knowing\" is mutual (i.e., if A knows B, then B knows A), then the graph is undirected, and each vertex has degree 3.\n\nIn that case, the number of people who know a particular person is equal to their degree, which is 3.\n\nTherefore, again, everyone has the same number of people knowing them.\n\nSo, the statement holds trivially.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question allows for the possibility that \"knowing\" is not mutual, meaning that it's a directed graph where an edge from A to B means A knows B, but B may or may not know A.\n\nBut even in that case, if each person knows exactly 3 others, then each vertex has out-degree 3.\n\nBut the question is about the number of other people they know, which would be their out-degree.\n\nSo, again, everyone has out-degree 3, so they all know the same number of other people.\n\nTherefore, the statement holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the in-degree, i.e., the number of people who know them.\n\nIn a directed graph, each person can have a different in-degree, even if their out-degree is fixed at 3.\n\nIn that case, the in-degrees can vary.\n\nBut the question specifically mentions \"knowing\" others, which might imply that \"knowing\" is mutual, making it an undirected graph.\n\nGiven that, I think the initial interpretation is correct: it's an undirected graph where each vertex has degree 3.\n\nIn that case, the statement that there are at least two people who know the same number of other people is trivially true, because everyone knows exactly 3 others.\n\nBut perhaps the question is more general, and the specific numbers are a red herring.\n\nLet me consider a more general principle.\n\nIn any graph with n vertices, if the degrees of the vertices are not all unique, then by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least two vertices with the same degree.\n\nBut in this specific case, since each vertex has degree 3, all degrees are the same, so the statement holds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is to prove that in any group of people where each person knows exactly k others, there are at least two people who know the same number of other people.\n\nBut again, if each person knows exactly k others, then everyone has the same number of acquaintances, so the statement holds.\n\nWait, maybe the question is different.\n\nPerhaps it's: \"In a group of 40 people, each person knows at least 3 others. Prove that there must be at least two people who know the same number of other people.\"\n\nThat would be a different problem, and in that case, we could apply the pigeonhole principle.\n\nIf each person knows at least 3 others, then the possible number of acquaintances ranges from 3 to 39 (since they can't know themselves).\n\nSo, there are 37 possible values for the number of acquaintances (3 through 39 inclusive).\n\nBut there are 40 people, so by the pigeonhole principle, at least ceil(40/37) = 2 people must have the same number of acquaintances.\n\nTherefore, there must be at least two people who know the same number of other people.\n\nBut in the original question, it's specified that each person knows exactly 3 others, which is a more specific case.\n\nSo, perhaps the original question is misremembered, and it's actually about each person knowing at least 3 others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about a different kind of relationship or some additional constraints.\n\nGiven the information provided, in a group of 40 people where each person knows exactly 3 others, it is indeed true that all people know the same number of other people, which is 3.\n\nTherefore, there are at least two people who know the same number of other people.\n\nIn fact, there are at least 40 such people, since everyone knows exactly 3 others.\n\nSo, the statement holds, and it's a straightforward conclusion based on the given conditions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{In a group of 40 people where each person knows exactly 3 others, all members know the same number of people, thus satisfying the condition that at least two people know the same number of others.}} \\]"
