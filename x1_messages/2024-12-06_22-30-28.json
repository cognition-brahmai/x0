        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a town where 60% of the population are adults. Out of these adults, 30% have a pet dog and 40% have a pet cat. The question is asking for the percentage of the total population that has a pet dog.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The total population includes both adults and non-adults, but only adults have pets according to the information given. So, non-adults don't have any pets, at least that's what it seems from the problem.\n\nLet me denote the total population as P. Then, the number of adults is 60% of P, which I can write as 0.6P.\n\nNow, among these adults, 30% have a pet dog. So, the number of adults with a pet dog is 30% of 0.6P. Let me calculate that:\n\n0.3 * 0.6P = 0.18P\n\nSo, 0.18P represents the number of adults with a pet dog.\n\nBut the question is asking for the percentage of the total population that has a pet dog. Since only adults have pets, and specifically, 0.18P have a pet dog, then the percentage of the total population that has a pet dog is:\n\n(0.18P / P) * 100% = 18%\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward, but let me double-check.\n\nI assumed that only adults have pets, which seems reasonable given the problem statement. It says \"among the adults, 30% have a pet dog,\" but it doesn't explicitly say that only adults have pets. However, since it doesn't mention anything about non-adults having pets, I think it's safe to assume that only adults have pets.\n\nAlternatively, if non-adults could have pets, the problem would probably provide that information. So, proceeding with my initial assumption.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose the total population is 100 people for simplicity.\n\nThen, 60% are adults: 60 adults.\n\nAmong these adults:\n\n- 30% have a pet dog: 0.3 * 60 = 18 adults have a pet dog.\n\n- 40% have a pet cat: 0.4 * 60 = 24 adults have a pet cat.\n\nBut again, the question is only about pet dogs.\n\nSo, in a total population of 100, 18 people have a pet dog. Therefore, the percentage is 18%.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nLet me consider if there's any overlap. Could some adults have both a pet dog and a pet cat? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps some adults have both.\n\nIf there is an overlap, then the number of adults with a pet dog would be slightly different.\n\nLet me think about it.\n\nGiven that 30% have a pet dog and 40% have a pet cat, the total percentage of adults with pets would be 30% + 40% = 70%, but this could include some adults who have both.\n\nIf some adults have both a dog and a cat, then the total percentage of adults with pets could be less than 70%.\n\nBut since the question is only about pet dogs, and it's asking for the percentage of the total population that has a pet dog, the overlap doesn't affect this particular calculation.\n\nEach adult who has a dog, whether or not they also have a cat, is still counted in the 30% who have a dog.\n\nTherefore, the calculation remains valid.\n\nSo, the percentage of the total population that has a pet dog is 18%.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if any non-adults could have pets.\n\nThe problem says \"among the adults, 30% have a pet dog and 40% have a pet cat.\" It doesn't say that only adults have pets. Maybe some non-adults have pets too.\n\nIf that's the case, then my initial assumption is incorrect, and I need to adjust my calculation.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't provide any information about non-adults having pets, it's reasonable to assume that only adults have pets.\n\nAdditionally, in real-life scenarios, it's more common for adults to own pets, although children might have pets as well. But based on the information given, I think it's safe to assume that only adults have pets.\n\nTherefore, my answer remains 18%.\n\nBut to cover all bases, let's consider a scenario where non-adults also have pets.\n\nSuppose that some percentage of non-adults have pet dogs.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the percentage of the total population that are non-adults as 40% (since 60% are adults).\n\nIf, say, x% of non-adults have pet dogs, then the total number of people with pet dogs would be:\n\n(0.3 * 0.6P) + (x * 0.4P)\n\nThen, the percentage of the total population with pet dogs would be:\n\n[(0.18P) + (0.004x P)] / P * 100% = (0.18 + 0.004x) *\n\nBut since the problem doesn't provide any information about x, it's impossible to calculate it.\n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is to assume that only adults have pets, as no information is given about non-adults having pets.\n\nHence, the answer is 18%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18\\%} \\]"
