        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 150 widgets every hour. It operates 24 hours a day for 30 days. I need to find out the total production for the month.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the daily production. If it produces 150 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day, then the daily production would be:\n\n150 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 3,600 widgets/day\n\nNow, to find the monthly production, I'll multiply the daily production by the number of days in the month. Given that there are 30 days:\n\n3,600 widgets/day * 30 days = 108,000 widgets\n\nSo, the factory will produce 108,000 widgets in the month.\n\nBut wait, is there anything else I should consider? Are there any holidays or downtime that might affect production? The problem says it operates 24 hours a day, so maybe it runs non-stop.\n\nAlso, it's assumed that the production rate is constant at 150 widgets per hour. There's no information about variations in production speed, so I'll stick with the given rate.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the factory produces widgets continuously without any breaks. But according to the information, it operates 24 hours a day, so I guess it's running all the time.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\n150 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 3,600 widgets/day\n\n3,600 widgets/day * 30 days = 108,000 widgets\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total number of hours in the month and then multiply by the hourly production rate.\n\nTotal hours in the month: 24 hours/day * 30 days = 720 hours\n\nTotal widgets: 150 widgets/hour * 720 hours = 108,000 widgets\n\nSame result. So, I'm confident with the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{108000} \\]"
