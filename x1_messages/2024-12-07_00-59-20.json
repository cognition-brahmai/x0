        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a box containing red and blue balls. The probability of picking a red ball is 2/3, and there are 18 blue balls in the box. We need to find out how many red balls there are.\n\nFirst, let's recall what probability means in this context. Probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is picking a red ball, and the total outcomes are picking any ball from the box, whether it's red or blue.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red ball is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{red}) = \\frac{\\text{number of red balls}}{\\text{total number of balls}} \\]\n\nWe're given that \\( P(\\text{red}) = \\frac{2}{3} \\), and there are 18 blue balls. Let's denote the number of red balls as \\( r \\) and the total number of balls as \\( t \\). So, we can write:\n\n\\[ \\frac{r}{t} = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nWe also know that the total number of balls is the sum of red and blue balls:\n\n\\[ t = r + 18 \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for \\( t \\) from the second equation into the first equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{r}{r + 18} = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nOur goal is to solve for \\( r \\). To do this, we can cross-multiply:\n\n\\[ 3r = 2(r + 18) \\]\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n\\[ 3r = 2r + 36 \\]\n\nNow, subtract \\( 2r \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 3r - 2r = 36 \\]\n\n\\[ r = 36 \\]\n\nSo, there are 36 red balls in the box.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If there are 36 red balls and 18 blue balls, the total number of balls is indeed 36 + 18 = 54. The probability of picking a red ball would be 36/54. Let's simplify that fraction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{36}{54} = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nYes, that matches the given probability. So, our answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could think about the probability of picking a blue ball. Since there are only red and blue balls in the box, the probability of picking a blue ball would be:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{blue}) = 1 - P(\\text{red}) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nGiven that there are 18 blue balls, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{blue}) = \\frac{18}{t} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ t = 18 \\times 3 = 54 \\]\n\nThen, since \\( t = r + 18 \\), we can find \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ r = 54 - 18 = 36 \\]\n\nAgain, we arrive at the same answer, which reinforces that our solution is correct.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the ratio of red to blue balls. The probability of picking a red ball is 2/3, which means for every 3 balls, 2 are red and 1 is blue. Therefore, the ratio of red to blue balls is 2:1.\n\nGiven that there are 18 blue balls, and the ratio of red to blue is 2:1, the number of red balls should be twice the number of blue balls:\n\n\\[ r = 2 \\times 18 = 36 \\]\n\nThis matches our previous calculations.\n\nTo summarize, using different methods\u2014whether it's setting up equations based on probability definitions, considering the complement probability, or using ratios\u2014we consistently find that there are 36 red balls in the box.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
