        "content": "So the restaurant serves both lunch and dinner, right? And they have averages for how many of each they serve per day, along with the average prices for those meals. I need to find out the daily revenue based on that information.\n\nFirst, let's list out what we know:\n\n- Average number of lunches per day: 75\n\n- Average price of a lunch: $12\n\n- Average number of dinners per day: 100\n\n- Average price of a dinner: $20\n\nRevenue is typically calculated by multiplying the number of units sold by the price per unit. So, for lunches, it would be the number of lunches multiplied by the price per lunch, and similarly for dinners.\n\nSo, for lunches:\n\nRevenue from lunches = number of lunches \u00d7 price per lunch\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nRevenue from lunches = 75 \u00d7 $12\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n75 \u00d7 12 = 900\n\nSo, revenue from lunches is $900 per day.\n\nNow, for dinners:\n\nRevenue from dinners = number of dinners \u00d7 price per dinner\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nRevenue from dinners = 100 \u00d7 $20\n\nCalculating that:\n\n100 \u00d7 20 = 2000\n\nSo, revenue from dinners is $2000 per day.\n\nTo find the total daily revenue, I need to add the revenue from lunches and the revenue from dinners together.\n\nTotal daily revenue = revenue from lunches + revenue from dinners\n\nSo:\n\nTotal daily revenue = $900 + $2000 = $2900\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check if there's anything else to consider. Are there any other costs or factors that might affect the total revenue? The question asks for daily revenue, and based on the information provided, it seems like we're only supposed to calculate the income from meals served, not accounting for costs.\n\nSo, yes, the total daily revenue would be $2900.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2900} \\]"
