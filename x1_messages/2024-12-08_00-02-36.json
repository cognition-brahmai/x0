        "content": "Let's see. The water tank holds 200 gallons of water. It takes 4 minutes to fill up 25% of the tank. I need to find out how long it will take to fill up the entire tank.\n\nFirst, I should understand what 25% of the tank is in terms of gallons. Since the tank holds 200 gallons, 25% of that would be:\n\n25% of 200 gallons = 0.25 * 200 = 50 gallons\n\nSo, it takes 4 minutes to fill up 50 gallons.\n\nNow, I need to find out how long it takes to fill up the entire 200 gallons.\n\nOne way to approach this is to find out the filling rate in gallons per minute and then use that rate to calculate the total time for 200 gallons.\n\nFirst, find the filling rate:\n\nFilling rate = gallons filled / time taken = 50 gallons / 4 minutes = 12.5 gallons per minute\n\nNow, to fill up the entire tank of 200 gallons at this rate:\n\nTime = total gallons / filling rate = 200 gallons / 12.5 gallons per minute\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n200 / 12.5 = 16 minutes\n\nSo, it should take 16 minutes to fill up the entire tank.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this?\n\nAlternatively, since 25% takes 4 minutes, then 100% should take four times as long because 100% is four times 25%.\n\nSo, 4 minutes * 4 = 16 minutes\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up a proportion:\n\n25% corresponds to 4 minutes\n\n100% corresponds to x minutes\n\nSo, x = (100% / 25%) * 4 minutes = 4 * 4 = 16 minutes\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nLet me think if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nIs there any reason to think that the filling rate might not be constant? For example, maybe the tank has a shape that affects the filling rate, or perhaps there are changes in flow rate over time. But the problem doesn't mention any such complications, so I'll assume the filling rate is constant.\n\nAnother thing to consider is units. I've been working in gallons and minutes, which is consistent throughout the problem, so that seems fine.\n\nAlso, double-checking the calculations:\n\nFilling rate: 50 gallons / 4 minutes = 12.5 gallons per minute\n\nTotal time: 200 gallons / 12.5 gallons per minute = 16 minutes\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the percentage approach:\n\n4 minutes for 25%,\n\nSo for 100%, it's 4 minutes * (100% / 25%) = 4 * 4 = 16 minutes\n\nSame answer again.\n\nI think I'm confident with this result.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
