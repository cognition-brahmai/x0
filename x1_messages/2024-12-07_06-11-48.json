The expression is:\n\n((7 * 4)^2 - 5^3) / (9 - 6)\n\nFirst, I'll do the multiplication inside the parentheses:\n\n7 * 4 = 28\n\nSo now it's:\n\n(28^2 - 5^3) / (9 - 6)\n\nNext, I'll calculate the exponents:\n\n28 squared is 28 * 28. Let's see:\n\n28 * 20 = 560\n\n28 * 8 = 224\n\n560 + 224 = 784\n\nSo, 28^2 = 784\n\nNow, 5 cubed is 5 * 5 * 5:\n\n5 * 5 = 25\n\n25 * 5 = 125\n\nSo, 5^3 = 125\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n(784 - 125) / (9 - 6)\n\nSubtracting inside the parentheses:\n\n784 - 125 = 659\n\nAnd 9 - 6 = 3\n\nSo now it's:\n\n659 / 3\n\nNow, I'll divide 659 by 3.\n\n3 goes into 6 two times (3*2=6), subtract 6 from 6, get 0.\n\nBring down the 5, so 05.\n\n3 goes into 5 one time (3*1=3), subtract 3 from 5, get 2.\n\nBring down the 9, so 29.\n\n3 goes into 29 nine times (3*9=27), subtract 27 from 29, get 2.\n\nSo, 3 goes into 659 219 times with a remainder of 2, which is 219 and 2/3.\n\nOr, as a decimal, it's approximately 219.666...\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 219.67, but more accurately, it's 219 and 2/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{219.\\overline{6}} \\]"
