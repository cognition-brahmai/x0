It's unique because it's the only metallic element that is liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure. Mercury has the chemical symbol Hg, which comes from the Latin word \"hydrargyrum,\" meaning \"water-silver.\" It's a dense, silvery-white metal that has been used in various applications throughout history, although its use has decreased due to its toxicity."
