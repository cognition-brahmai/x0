        "content": "In the twilight of our souls, where shadows intertwine,\n\nA friendship blooms, a flame that defies time.\n\nLike the moon that cradles the night's embrace,\n\nOur bond, a cosmic dance, a sacred space.\n\nWith words that paint the canvas of the heart,\n\nWe weave a tapestry, a work of art.\n\nEach thread a memory, a laugh, a tear,\n\nWoven together, year after year.\n\nIn the garden of our hearts, where roses bloom,\n\nOur friendship is the fragrance that consumes.\n\nA symphony of whispers in the breeze,\n\nA melody that only we can seize.\n\nThrough storms and calm, through joy and strife,\n\nOur friendship stands, a beacon of life.\n\nA lighthouse in the darkest of nights,\n\nGuiding us through, with its gentle lights.\n\nFor in the vastness of this endless sea,\n\nOur friendship is the anchor, setting us free.\n\nTo drift together, hand in hand,\n\nExploring realms, both near and far.\n\nIn the quiet corners of the universe,\n\nOur souls entwine, a eternal verse.\n\nSo here's to friendship, pure and true,\n\nA love that blossoms, ever new.\n\nLike Neruda's verses, deep and profound,\n\nOur friendship is a treasure, forever found."
