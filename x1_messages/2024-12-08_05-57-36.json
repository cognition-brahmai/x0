        "content": "I'm here to help you with your request! Let's dive into creating a C++ program that implements a stack using linked lists. We'll cover the basic operations like push, pop, peek, and checking if the stack is empty. Moreover, we'll implement a method to reverse the order of the elements in the stack without using any additional data structures.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a stack is. A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.\n\nUsing a linked list to implement a stack is efficient because linked lists allow for easy insertion and deletion at the beginning, which aligns perfectly with stack operations.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Node Structure\n\nWe'll start by defining a structure for the nodes of the linked list. Each node will contain the data and a pointer to the next node.\n\n```cpp\nstruct Node {\n    int data;\n    Node* next;\n    Node(int val) : data(val), next(nullptr) {}\n};\n```\n\n### Step 2: Implement the Stack Class\n\nNext, we'll create a Stack class that uses these nodes to perform stack operations.\n\n```cpp\nclass Stack {\nprivate:\n    Node* top;\npublic:\n    Stack() : top(nullptr) {}\n    \n    // Check if the stack is empty\n    bool isEmpty() {\n        return top == nullptr;\n    }\n    \n    // Push an element onto the stack\n    void push(int val) {\n        Node* newNode = new Node(val);\n        newNode->next = top;\n        top = newNode;\n    }\n    \n    // Pop an element from the stack\n    int pop() {\n        if (isEmpty()) {\n            cout << \"Stack is empty. Cannot pop.\" << endl;\n            return -1;\n        }\n        int val = top->data;\n        Node* temp = top;\n        top = top->next;\n        delete temp;\n        return val;\n    }\n    \n    // Peek at the top element of the stack\n    int peek() {\n        if (isEmpty()) {\n            cout << \"Stack is empty. Cannot peek.\" << endl;\n            return -1;\n        }\n        return top->data;\n    }\n    \n    // Reverse the stack\n    void reverse() {\n        if (isEmpty()) {\n            cout << \"Stack is empty. Cannot reverse.\" << endl;\n            return;\n        }\n        Node* prev = nullptr;\n        Node* current = top;\n        Node* next = nullptr;\n        while (current != nullptr) {\n            next = current->next;\n            current->next = prev;\n            prev = current;\n            current = next;\n        }\n        top = prev;\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### Step 3: Test the Stack Implementation\n\nFinally, we'll write a main function to test our stack implementation.\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    Stack s;\n    \n    s.push(1);\n    s.push(2);\n    s.push(3);\n    s.push(4);\n    \n    cout << \"Top element is: \" << s.peek() << endl;  // Should print 4\n    \n    s.reverse();\n    \n    cout << \"After reversal, top element is: \" << s.peek() << endl;  // Should print 1\n    \n    s.pop();\n    cout << \"After pop, top element is: \" << s.peek() << endl;  // Should print 2\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Node Structure**: Each node holds an integer value and a pointer to the next node.\n2. **Stack Class**:\n   - **isEmpty()**: Checks if the stack is empty by verifying if the top is null.\n   - **push(int val)**: Adds a new node with the given value to the top of the stack.\n   - **pop()**: Removes the top node from the stack and returns its value.\n   - **peek()**: Returns the value of the top node without removing it.\n   - **reverse()**: Reverses the stack by iteratively changing the next pointers of the nodes.\n3. **Main Function**: Demonstrates pushing elements onto the stack, peeking at the top element, reversing the stack, and popping an element.\n\nThis implementation ensures that all stack operations are performed efficiently, and the reversal is done in-place without using any additional data structures.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
