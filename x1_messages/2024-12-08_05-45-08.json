        "content": "So, the train travels between two cities that are 120 miles apart, and it takes 2 hours to complete the journey. I need to find out its average speed. Okay, average speed is usually calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken. So, in this case, it would be 120 miles divided by 2 hours. That should give me the average speed in miles per hour. Let me do the math: 120 divided by 2 is 60. So, the average speed is 60 miles per hour. But wait, is there anything else I need to consider here? Is there such a thing as average speed in trains? I think yes, because trains don't always travel at a constant speed. They accelerate and decelerate, so the average speed makes sense here. Also, 120 miles in 2 hours does indeed average out to 60 mph. I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if the train makes any stops along the way. The question doesn't mention any stops, so I'll assume it's a non-stop journey. If there were stops, that would add to the total time, but since it's not mentioned, I'll proceed with the given information. So, average speed equals total distance over total time, which is 120 miles over 2 hours, equaling 60 mph. I think that's straightforward. But maybe there's a different way to look at it. Perhaps using the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time. Yeah, that's the same as what I did. Or maybe considering the train's speed at different points, but since it's average speed, I don't need to worry about that. Unless there's some variable speed or something, but the question seems straightforward. So, I'm confident that the answer is 60 miles per hour.**\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
