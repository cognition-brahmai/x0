But there\\'s a hitch. We\\'re going to find out how safe your savings are right now. A lobbyist caught on tape allegedly offering access to Vice President Cheney and other top Bush administration figures for a price. And a comeback for the Taliban and a setback for U.S. troops -- Americans and Afghan paying a heavy price in blood right now. I\\'m Wolf Blitzer. You\\'re in THE SITUATION ROOM. Worried customers lining around the block to pull their money out of the failed IndyMac Bank, which reopened today with a new boss, the U.S. government. A federal agency guarantees most of the deposits, but some fear their life-savings can be at risk. So how safe are your savings right now? CNN\\'s Deborah Feyerick is standing by with that. But let\\'s go out to Pasadena. CNN\\'s Kara Finnstrom is standing by with what\\'s going on Long lines. People trying to get their money -- Kara, tell us what the latest is. KARA FINNSTROM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, some of these people are not getting all their money back, because it was not fully insured. And they\\'re just now finding it out. So a very difficult day for them. We want to give you a quick look here at the hundreds of people -- the crowds out here. Some of these people trying to get shelter under these, you know, makeshift structures that they\\'ve put up. Others under umbrellas. Many of these people have been here for eight hours now and all of them want answers. FINNSTROM (voice-over): The lines started building before sunrise -- customers coming to 33 branches of what was, less than one week ago, their bank. Now customers like Nasim Ahmed facing what can only be described as a nightmare, asking FDIC officials what happened to my money. Ahmed and his family drove from San Francisco overnight. Ahmed had his personal savings and numerous accounts for his business, a clinical research company, at IndyMac. When the doors opened, he was number four in line. Ahmed asked question after question. Two-and-a-half hours later, he came out. NASIM AHMED, INDYMAC DEPOSITOR: I\\'m surprised, shocked. FINNSTROM: Ahmed was told only the first $100,000 in each of his accounts is fully insured. Beyond that amount... N. AHMED: And you will get 50 cents on a dollar. So that\\'s -- that\\'s pretty miserable. FINNSTROM: Ahmed said he was misled by IndyMac officials, who had assured him he had structured his savings in different accounts that would be safe. He may take a huge hit. N. AHMED: It this is going to hurt me, but I will try to recover, stand again and try to do business as usual. But from now on, I will be better -- more cautious. FINNSTROM: Ahmed says he plans to fight for more of his money. But for now, he and his family are heading straight back to San Francisco. SHAMEEMA AHMED, INDYMAC DEPOSITOR: I\\'ve never dreamed of this one. I don\\'t know. It\\'s like a disaster to me. FINNSTROM: He says they can\\'t afford to miss another day of work. FINNSTROM: And CNN has tried to contact bank officials with the former IndyMac, but those calls have not yet been returned -- Wolf. BLITZER: What a story. Kara, stay on top of it for us. Thanks very much. So here\\'s the question -- how safe is your money? Let\\'s go to Deborah Feyerick. She\\'s watching this part of the story. There are a lot of nervous Americans out there. They have money, their savings, life-savings for a lot of them, millions of them in various banks. And I\\'ll ask the question to you, what should they be doing? What\\'s going on? DEBORAH FEYERICK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, Wolf, a lot of people find comfort having their money in one bank. But, really, after what happened to IndyMac, many are realizing they may have just dodged a bullet. FEYERICK (voice-over): It wasn\\'t just IndyMac customers thinking about their money. Other people, too, were wondering if their bank accounts elsewhere might also be at risk. GREG MACBRIDE, BANKRATE.COM: A bank failure is a wakeup call to anyone that has more money on deposit in a bank than is covered by FDIC insurance. Having that money deposited and not being fully protected is like driving around town without your seat belt on. FEYERICK: Money experts say as long as your money is insured, $100,000 in an individual bank account, $250,000 in an IRA, there\\'s no need to withdraw it -- even if the bank is failing because pulling it out creates other problems. MACBRIDE: Banks don\\'t keep all this money stuck in a vault in the back. It causes a liquidity crisis. FEYERICK: The FDIC took over IndyMac in part to make sure the troubled mortgage lender would not take steps that could trigger even greater economic instability. JOSEPH LYNYAK, BANKING REGULATORY ATTORNEY: The bank will try to right itself. And sometimes what that means is that a bank can sell- off assets which are very valuable, which end up resulting in a greater loss to the FDIC than otherwise would be the case. FEYERICK: The FDIC says only a small percentage of the 90 banks currently considered at risk will actually fail. JOHN BOVENZI, FDIC: At the end of the day, there will be some bank failures, but very few. FEYERICK: And with $50 billion in its insurance fund, FDIC\\'s chief operating officer, John Bovenzi, says that\\'s more than enough to cover whatever might come. FEYERICK: The bottom line -- given the severe housing correction, a small percentage of banks will likely fail. But as a consumer, as long as your money is on deposit, that is fully protected by the FDIC insurance, if the bank fails, then it\\'s really the bank\\'s problem, not yours. But if you do pull it out, make sure your new bank is financially sound. And can go to the Web site, FDIC.gov and to a section called bank bond and make sure that the bank is insured. No point pulling it out of one just to put it into another that might be at risk -- Wolf. BLITZER: Excellent advice, Deb. Deb Feyerick reporting for us. We\\'re going to have more on this story coming up. But let\\'s move on. A newspaper\\'s sting leads to some stunning videotape -- a lobbyist allegedly offering access to Vice President Cheney, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and other top Bush administration officials for a price -- a steep price. Let\\'s go live to our White House correspondent, Ed Henry. He\\'s working this story for us -- Ed, what\\'s going on this story? Explain. ED HENRY, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, the White House is basically denying that they knew any of this was going on. They essentially say that the lobbyist involved, Stephen Payne was acting alone. And Payne himself was in full spin mode, essentially telling CNN it was all a big misunderstanding. HENRY (voice-over): Promises of access to the president\\'s top aides in exchange for contributions to the George W. Bush Library and some cold hard cash on the side for the man brokering the deal. The whole discussion caught on tape. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ...politician a couple of hundred? That would probably get the attention of the people raising the money. HENRY: That\\'s Texas lobbyist and Bush fundraiser Steven Payne, unwitting star of this shocking video, secretly recorded by the \"Times of London.\" Here, he tried to get a donation from a man whom he thought was representing the exiled former president of Kyrgyzstan. STEPHEN PAYNE: 200, 250. Something like that\\'s going to be a show of when interested, we\\'re your friends. We\\'re still your friends. HENRY: Payne, who raised $200,000 for the president\\'s re- election, is seen promising meetings with top officials, including Vice President Cheney. In exchange, big money for the future Bush Library. PAYNE: Cheney\\'s possible. Definitely the national security adviser. HENRY: The White House distanced itself from Payne\\'s actions and suggested he\\'s not an insider. DANA PERINO, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: There\\'s categorically no link between any official business in the Bush Library. Steve Payne was never an employee of the White House. But we do use hundreds of volunteers a year, as you know, for helping us do advance work. HENRY: The White House admits Payne helped with logistics on some foreign trips and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff did appoint Payne to an advisory committee. In a long written statement to CNN, Payne, president of Worldwide Strategic Partners in Houston, called the \"Times of London\" story \"got you journalism.\" Payne acknowledged mentioning that they might be able to make donations to think tanks, foundations and/or President Bush\\'s library. But Payne stressed that in subsequent e-mails, which he gave to CNN, he made clear there could be no quid pro quo. In one of those e-mails, Payne wrote he would accept the 250 and pass it directly to the library, but noted he could not promise specific government action because that would be bribery. HENRY: Now the key question, did Stephen Payne get any meetings for his clients here at the White House. Dana Perino said she was not sure. So I asked her whether the White House would release visitor logs to find out whether Stephen Payne has been here at the White House a lot. She said she\\'d check with White House lawyers, but noted there\\'s been litigation in other matters dealing with visitor logs. So the bottom line, it\\'s highly unlikely the White House will ever release those records -- Wolf. BLITZER: Ed Henry with an amazing, amazing story. Thanks very much. Let\\'s go back to Jack Cafferty. He\\'s got \"The Cafferty File\" -- \"got you journalism,\" that\\'s what he called it. JACK CAFFERTY, CNN ANCHOR: Well, and a quid pro-quo. They don\\'t even -- that\\'s the meaning of 90 percent of the transactions that take place inside the beltway. There isn\\'t nothing for nothing down there. And, of course we\\'ll never know, because the White House doesn\\'t release anything, because they can get away with it because nobody in Congress cares and they won\\'t force them to release this stuff by throwing people who refuse to answer subpoenas in jail. But that\\'s another topic for another day. Former President Bill Clinton has a warning for all of us. He says the country is becoming more and more divided. He spoke to the National Governors Association. And he said even though the Democratic primary produced historic results, with the final two candidates being a woman, his wife, and an African-American man, he sees a larger problem. President Clinton thinks Americans are becoming more polarized as a nation. He says we\\'re growing farther apart from each other and are \"hunkering down in communities of like-mindedness and it affects our ability to manage difference.\" Clinton says Americans are separating themselves by choosing to live with people they agree with. He used ideas from a book called \"The Big Sort\" by Bill Bishop for this speech to the Governors Association. Bishop found that in 1976, 20 percent of U.S. counties voted for Jimmy Carter or President Ford by more than a 20 percent margin. Just 20 percent. By 2004, nearly 50 percent of the nation\\'s counties voted for John Kerry or President Bush by that same margin. President Clinton reminded governors that the issues they\\'re dealing with today are similar to those confronted by Teddy Roosevelt a century ago -- inequality among the rich and poor, immigration, energy. But Clinton says he\\'s determined that we will deal with these issues and eventually enter a period of light, not darkness. So here\\'s the question: Do you agree with President Clinton that America is becoming more divided? Go to CNN.com/caffertyfile. You can post a comment on my blog. Karl Rove refused to answer a subpoena the other day. Did anybody do anything about it? BLITZER: Well, not yet. CAFFERTY: No. BLITZER: The answer is not yet. CAFFERTY: Yes, well, let\\'s all hold our breath. BLITZER: Yes. All right, Jack. See you in a few moments. The cartoon that has lots of people talking, but not everyone is laughing. Does \"The New Yorker\" cover depicting the Obamas as terrorists cross the line? And Obama\\'s plan for Iraq -- we\\'ll talk about all of that with our political contributors James Carville and Bill Bennett. They\\'re standing by live. Also, banks going under, a mortgage meltdown -- the New York mayor, Michael Bloomberg, tells us what he would do to try to solve the nation\\'s financial crisis. He\\'s deeply worried, also, about poverty in America. Plus, another near disaster at a major U.S. airport. What\\'s being done about it? Stay with us.
