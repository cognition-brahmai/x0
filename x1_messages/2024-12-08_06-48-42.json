        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are 50 people in a group, and among them, 30 can speak English, 20 can speak French, and 10 can speak both English and French. I need to find out how many people can speak either English or French, but not both.\n\nOkay, let's start by understanding what's being asked. I need to find the number of people who can speak English only or French only, but not both languages.\n\nFirst, I know that some people can speak both languages, and that's given as 10 people. So, these 10 people are included in both the English and French counts.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- E as the set of people who can speak English.\n\n- F as the set of people who can speak French.\n\nGiven:\n\n- |E| = 30\n\n- |F| = 20\n\n- |E \u2229 F| = 10\n\nI need to find the number of people who can speak either English or French, but not both. That means I need to find the number of people who can speak only English plus the number of people who can speak only French.\n\nTo find the number of people who can speak only English, I can subtract the number of people who can speak both languages from the total number of people who can speak English:\n\nOnly English = |E| - |E \u2229 F| = 30 - 10 = 20\n\nSimilarly, the number of people who can speak only French is:\n\nOnly French = |F| - |E \u2229 F| = 20 - 10 = 10\n\nTherefore, the total number of people who can speak either English or French, but not both, is:\n\nOnly English + Only French = 20 + 10 = 30\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check this to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for the total number of people who can speak either English or French, which includes those who can speak both.\n\nSo, the total number of people who can speak either English or French is:\n\n|E \u222a F| = |E| + |F| - |E \u2229 F| = 30 + 20 - 10 = 40\n\nBut this includes those who can speak both languages. However, the question asks for the number of people who can speak either English or French, but not both. So, I need to exclude those who can speak both languages from this total.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who can speak either English or French, but not both, is:\n\n|E \u222a F| - |E \u2229 F| = 40 - 10 = 30\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the total group size. There are 50 people in the group. If 40 people can speak either English or French (including those who can speak both), then there are 50 - 40 = 10 people who cannot speak either language. But the question doesn't ask about them, so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 30 people.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to look at this. Suppose I draw a Venn diagram with two circles representing English and French speakers. The overlap between the two circles represents people who can speak both languages, which is 10 people.\n\nThe part of the English circle outside the overlap represents people who can speak only English, which is 30 - 10 = 20 people.\n\nSimilarly, the part of the French circle outside the overlap represents people who can speak only French, which is 20 - 10 = 10 people.\n\nAdding these two gives 20 + 10 = 30 people who can speak either English or French, but not both.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the total number of people who can speak at least one language, which is 40, and subtract those who can speak both languages, which is 10, I again get 30.\n\nEverything points to 30 being the correct answer.\n\nI think that's straightforward enough. I don't see any tricks or additional considerations in this problem. It's a classic inclusion-exclusion principle application.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any possibility of people speaking other languages or any overlapping with other sets, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It's purely about English and French speakers in a group of 50 people.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 30 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
