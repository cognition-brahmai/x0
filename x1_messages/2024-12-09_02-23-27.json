To create a Java program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion, we need to understand what recursion is and how it applies to calculating factorials.\n\nRecursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In programming, this means a function calling itself with a simpler version of the original problem, until it reaches a base case that can be solved directly.\n\nThe factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It's denoted by n!. For example:\n\n- 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120\n\n- 3! = 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 6\n\n- 1! = 1\n\n- 0! = 1 (by definition)\n\nIn recursion terms, the factorial function can be defined as:\n\n- factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1) for n > 0\n\n- factorial(0) = 1 (base case)\n\nNow, let's translate this into Java code.\n\nFirst, we need to define a class, say \"FactorialCalculator\", and within it, a recursive method to calculate the factorial.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a class named FactorialCalculator.\n\n2. Inside the class, define a public static method named factorial that takes an integer parameter n and returns a long (to handle larger factorial values).\n\n3. Implement the factorial method with a base case: if n is 0, return 1.\n\n4. For n > 0, return n multiplied by factorial(n-1).\n\n5. In the main method, prompt the user to enter a number.\n\n6. Read the user's input.\n\n7. Call the factorial method with the user's input and print the result.\n\nLet's write the code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Java program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Recursion and Factorial:**\n   - Recursion is a method where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem.\n   - The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n, denoted by n!.\n   - Base case: 0! = 1\n   - Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n\n2. **Define the Class and Method:**\n   - Create a class named `FactorialCalculator`.\n   - Define a public static method `factorial` that takes an integer `n` and returns a long (to handle larger factorial values).\n\n3. **Implement the Factorial Method:**\n   - If `n` is 0, return 1.\n   - Otherwise, return `n` multiplied by `factorial(n-1)`.\n\n4. **Main Method:**\n   - Prompt the user to enter a number.\n   - Read the input.\n   - Call the `factorial` method and print the result.\n\nHere is the complete code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class FactorialCalculator {\n\n    // Recursive method to calculate factorial\n    public static long factorial(int n) {\n        if (n == 0) {\n            return 1;\n        } else {\n            return n * factorial(n - 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.print(\"Enter a non-negative integer: \");\n        int number = scanner.nextInt();\n        if (number < 0) {\n            System.out.println(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\");\n        } else {\n            long result = factorial(number);\n            System.out.println(\"Factorial of \" + number + \" is \" + result);\n        }\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Factorial Method:**\n   - **Base Case:** If `n` is 0, the factorial is 1.\n   - **Recursive Case:** The method calls itself with `n-1` until it reaches the base case.\n\n2. **Main Method:**\n   - Uses `Scanner` to read user input.\n   - Checks if the input is negative; if not, calculates the factorial using the recursive method and displays the result."
