        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 houses numbered from 1 to 100. The mayor wants to paint even-numbered houses green and odd-numbered houses red. But house number 7 is already painted blue. I need to find out how many houses will be painted green.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many even-numbered houses there are between 1 and 100. Even numbers are divisible by 2, right? So, the even numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on, up to 100.\n\nTo find the number of even numbers between 1 and 100, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. The first even number is 2, the last is 100, and the common difference is 2.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nNumber of terms = (Last term - First term)/Common difference + 1\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nNumber of even-numbered houses = (100 - 2)/2 + 1 = (98)/2 + 1 = 49 + 1 = 50\n\nSo, there are 50 even-numbered houses.\n\nBut wait, house number 7 is already painted blue. Now, house number 7 is odd because 7 is an odd number. Since odd-numbered houses are supposed to be painted red, but house 7 is already blue, I need to consider if this affects the number of green houses.\n\nSince house 7 is odd, and it's already blue, it won't be painted red by the mayor. But since only even-numbered houses are painted green, and house 7 is odd, it shouldn't affect the number of green houses.\n\nTherefore, the number of green houses should still be 50.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Is there any possibility that house 7 being blue affects the painting of even-numbered houses?\n\nI don't think so. The painting is based on the house numbers: even numbers get painted green, odd numbers get painted red, except house 7, which is already blue.\n\nSince house 7 is odd, it's supposed to be painted red, but since it's already blue, it remains blue. But this doesn't change the fact that even-numbered houses will be painted green.\n\nSo, the number of green houses is still 50.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that house 7 is blue means that the mayor won't paint it red, but since it's odd, it doesn't affect the even-numbered houses.\n\nYes, I think my initial conclusion is correct. There are 50 even-numbered houses, and they will all be painted green.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
