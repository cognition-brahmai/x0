        "content": "The popular board game you're referring to is Scrabble. In Scrabble, players use lettered tiles to form words on a grid, similar to a crossword puzzle. Each letter has a point value based on its frequency in the English language, with less common letters being worth more points. The game's objective is to score points by placing tiles on the board in such a way that they form valid words, either by building off existing words or creating new ones. The game was indeed invented by Alfred Mosher Butts in the 1930s and has since become a beloved pastime worldwide.\n"
