Frodo was a hobbit from the Shire who undertook the perilous journey to carry the One Ring to Mount Doom in Mordor, where it could be unmade. His quest was part of the epic struggle against the dark lord Sauron, whose power depended on the One Ring. Frodo's bravery and perseverance, along with the help of his companions in the Fellowship of the Ring, played a crucial role in the ultimate defeat of Sauron and the salvation of Middle-earth."
