        "content": "So the factory produces 1200 widgets every day, and out of those, 2% are defective. We want to know how many defective widgets will be produced after 30 days.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many defective widgets are produced each day. Since 2% of the daily production is defective, I can calculate that by taking 2% of 1200.\n\nLet me remember that percent means per hundred, so 2% is the same as 2/100 or 0.02 in decimal form.\n\nSo, defective widgets per day = 1200 * 0.02.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 1200 times 0.02.\n\n1200 * 0.02 = 24.\n\nSo, there are 24 defective widgets produced each day.\n\nNow, to find out how many defective widgets are produced in 30 days, I just need to multiply the daily defective widgets by 30.\n\nSo, total defective widgets in 30 days = 24 * 30.\n\nLet me calculate that: 24 times 30 is 720.\n\nTherefore, after 30 days, the factory will have produced 720 defective widgets.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe by calculating the total production first and then applying the defect rate.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nTotal production in 30 days = 1200 widgets/day * 30 days = 36,000 widgets.\n\nNow, applying the 2% defect rate to the total production: 36,000 * 0.02 = 720 defective widgets.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like 720 is the correct number of defective widgets after 30 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{720} \\]"
