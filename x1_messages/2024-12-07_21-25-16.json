        "content": "So the car rental company has a total of 150 cars in their fleet. If 60% of these cars are rented out on any given day, I need to find out how many cars are still available for rent each day.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many cars are rented out. To do that, I can calculate 60% of 150. I know that percentages can be converted to decimals for easier calculation, so 60% is the same as 0.60.\n\nSo, the number of cars rented out is 150 multiplied by 0.60. Let me do that calculation:\n\n150 \u00d7 0.60 = 90 cars\n\nAlright, so 90 cars are rented out each day. Now, to find out how many cars are available for rent, I need to subtract the number of rented cars from the total number of cars in the fleet.\n\nAvailable cars = Total cars - Rented cars\n\nAvailable cars = 150 - 90 = 60 cars\n\nSo, there are 60 cars available for rent each day.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe instead of calculating the number of rented cars and then subtracting, I could directly calculate the percentage of cars that are available.\n\nIf 60% of the cars are rented, then the remaining percentage must be available for rent. So, 100% - 60% = 40% of the cars are available.\n\nThen, to find the number of available cars, I can calculate 40% of 150.\n\n40% of 150 is 0.40 \u00d7 150 = 60 cars\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can check if there's another approach to this problem. Perhaps using fractions?\n\n60% is the same as 60/100, which simplifies to 3/5. So, 3/5 of the cars are rented out.\n\nTherefore, the number of rented cars is 3/5 of 150:\n\n(3/5) \u00d7 150 = (3 \u00d7 150) / 5 = 450 / 5 = 90 cars\n\nAgain, that matches my previous calculations.\n\nAlternatively, for the available cars, 40% is the same as 40/100, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nSo, 2/5 of the cars are available:\n\n(2/5) \u00d7 150 = (2 \u00d7 150) / 5 = 300 / 5 = 60 cars\n\nOnce more, I get 60 cars available for rent each day.\n\nI think I've confirmed this from multiple angles, so I'm confident that the answer is 60 cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
