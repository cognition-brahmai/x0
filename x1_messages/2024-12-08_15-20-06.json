        "content": "Let's see. Alice can paint a house in 5 hours, and Bob can do it in 7 hours. They start painting together but after 2 hours, Alice has to leave. I need to find out how long it will take Bob to finish painting the remaining part alone.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much of the house each of them can paint per hour. That's their painting rate, right?\n\nAlice's rate is 1 house per 5 hours, so that's 1/5 of the house per hour.\n\nBob's rate is 1 house per 7 hours, so that's 1/7 of the house per hour.\n\nWhen they work together, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates:\n\n1/5 + 1/7 = (7 + 5)/35 = 12/35 of the house per hour.\n\nThey work together for 2 hours, so the amount they paint together is:\n\n2 * (12/35) = 24/35 of the house.\n\nSo, the remaining part of the house to be painted is:\n\n1 - 24/35 = 11/35 of the house.\n\nNow, Bob has to paint this remaining 11/35 of the house alone. Since his rate is 1/7 per hour, the time it will take him is:\n\nTime = (remaining work) / (Bob's rate) = (11/35) / (1/7) = (11/35) * 7 = 11/5 = 2.2 hours.\n\nSo, it will take Bob 2.2 hours to finish painting the remaining part alone.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, their combined rate is indeed 1/5 + 1/7 = 12/35 per hour.\n\nIn 2 hours, they paint 2 * 12/35 = 24/35.\n\nRemaining work is 1 - 24/35 = 11/35.\n\nBob's rate is 1/7 per hour.\n\nTime = (11/35) / (1/7) = 11/35 * 7/1 = 77/35 = 2.2 hours.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of fractions.\n\nSince Bob paints 1/7 per hour, to paint 11/35, it would take him (11/35) / (1/7) = 11/35 * 7/1 = 77/35 = 2.2 hours.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to convert everything to decimals for clarity.\n\nAlice's rate: 1/5 = 0.2 houses per hour.\n\nBob's rate: 1/7 \u2248 0.1429 houses per hour.\n\nCombined rate: 0.2 + 0.1429 = 0.3429 houses per hour.\n\nIn 2 hours, they paint 2 * 0.3429 \u2248 0.6857 houses.\n\nRemaining work: 1 - 0.6857 \u2248 0.3143 houses.\n\nBob's rate: 0.1429 houses per hour.\n\nTime = 0.3143 / 0.1429 \u2248 2.2 hours.\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 2.2 hours.\n\nBut maybe I should express it in hours and minutes for better understanding.\n\n2.2 hours is 2 hours plus 0.2 hours.\n\n0.2 hours * 60 minutes = 12 minutes.\n\nSo, it's 2 hours and 12 minutes.\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify the format, 2.2 hours is fine.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.2 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
