        "content": "So I've got this probability question here. It's about drawing cards from a standard deck without replacement. Let's see: I need to find the probability of first drawing a red card\u2014 that's hearts or diamonds\u2014 and then, without putting that card back, drawing a black card\u2014 clubs or spades.\n\nAlright, first things first. A standard deck has 52 cards: 26 red (13 hearts and 13 diamonds) and 26 black (13 clubs and 13 spades).\n\nSo, the probability of the first event\u2014drawing a red card\u2014should be the number of red cards divided by the total number of cards. That is 26 red cards out of 52 total cards. So, that's 26/52, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.\n\nNow, since I'm not replacing the first card, the total number of cards left in the deck is 51. And since I've already drawn a red card, the number of black cards remains 26, because I only removed a red one.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a black card next is 26 black cards out of 51 remaining cards. That's 26/51.\n\nTo find the overall probability of both events happening in sequence\u2014first drawing a red card and then a black card\u2014I need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, that's (26/52) times (26/51).\n\nWait a minute, 26/52 is 1/2, so it's (1/2) times (26/51).\n\nLet me calculate that. First, 1/2 is 0.5, and 26/51 is approximately 0.5098.\n\nSo, 0.5 times 0.5098 is about 0.2549.\n\nBut maybe I should keep it as a fraction for exactness.\n\nSo, (1/2) * (26/51) = (1*26)/(2*51) = 26/102.\n\nThat can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: 13/51.\n\nSo, the exact probability is 13/51.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about it another way. The total number of ways to draw two cards in sequence is 52 choose 1 times 51 choose 1, which is 52*51.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to first draw a red card and then a black card.\n\nNumber of red cards is 26, and then number of black cards is 26, with 51 cards left.\n\nSo, favorable outcomes are 26 * 26.\n\nTherefore, probability is (26*26)/(52*51) = (26/52)*(26/51), which is the same as before, 13/51.\n\nAlternatively, since the first card is red and the second is black, and there are no dependencies beyond the first draw affecting the second, this seems correct.\n\nWait, unless I'm missing something about the dependencies.\n\nLet me consider another approach using combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to choose the first card as red is C(26,1) = 26.\n\nThe number of ways to choose the second card as black is C(26,1) = 26.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose any two cards in sequence is C(52,1)*C(51,1) = 52*51.\n\nSo, probability is (26*26)/(52*51) = (26/52)*(26/51) = 13/51.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of conditional probability.\n\nThe probability of drawing a black card on the second draw given that the first card was red.\n\nSo, P(Black second | Red first).\n\nBy definition, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A).\n\nHere, A is Red first, B is Black second.\n\nWe need P(A and B), which is P(A) * P(B|A).\n\nP(A) = P(Red first) = 26/52 = 1/2.\n\nP(B|A) = P(Black second given Red first) = 26/51.\n\nTherefore, P(A and B) = (1/2) * (26/51) = 13/51.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the events without considering order, but since it's a sequence, order matters.\n\nAnother way: think of the entire sample space as all possible sequences of two cards drawn without replacement.\n\nTotal sequences: 52*51.\n\nFavorable sequences: 26 (red first)*26 (black second).\n\nProbability: (26*26)/(52*51) = 13/51.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 13/51.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider the decimal equivalent.\n\n13 divided by 51 is approximately 0.25490196, which is roughly 25.49%.\n\nAlternatively, 13/51 can be confirmed by dividing both numerator and denominator by 13: 13/51 divides to 13/51, which is already in simplest form.\n\nSo, the final answer is 13/51.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{51}} \\]"
