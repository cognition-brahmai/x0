        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains, one leaving City A going towards City B at 50 mph, and the other leaving City B going towards City A at 70 mph. The distance between the cities is 300 miles. I need to find out how long it takes for them to meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that since both trains are moving towards each other, their speeds add up. So, the relative speed is 50 mph + 70 mph = 120 mph. This means that together, they are closing the distance between them at a rate of 120 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the initial distance apart is 300 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Relative Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 300 miles / 120 mph\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n300 divided by 120 is 2.5 hours.\n\nSo, it should take 2.5 hours for the two trains to meet each other.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the distance each train travels until they meet and set up an equation based on the time taken.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time taken for them to meet as t hours.\n\nThen, the distance traveled by the first train from City A would be 50t miles (since distance = speed \u00d7 time).\n\nSimilarly, the distance traveled by the second train from City B would be 70t miles.\n\nWhen they meet, the sum of these distances should equal the total distance between the cities, which is 300 miles.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n\n50t + 70t = 300\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n120t = 300\n\nNow, solving for t:\n\nt = 300 / 120\n\nt = 2.5 hours\n\nOkay, this matches my previous calculation. So, it confirms that the answer is indeed 2.5 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how much distance they cover together per hour. Since one is going at 50 mph and the other at 70 mph towards each other, every hour they get 120 miles closer. So, to cover 300 miles, it would take 300 divided by 120, which is 2.5 hours.\n\nI think this makes sense. There doesn't seem to be any trick here; it's a straightforward relative speed problem.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the speeds were different or if the cities were closer or farther apart, but in this specific case, with the given numbers, 2.5 hours is the correct answer.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2.5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
