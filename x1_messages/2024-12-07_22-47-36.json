However, it's worth noting that Magellan himself did not complete the entire circumnavigation; he died during the expedition in the Philippines. It was his crew, under the command of Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano, who completed the voyage and returned to Spain. The expedition was sponsored by the Spanish Crown and was the first to accomplish a circumnavigation of the Earth."
