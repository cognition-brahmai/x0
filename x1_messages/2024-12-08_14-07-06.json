        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a company with 100 employees. First, it says that 60% of the employees are male. So, let's find out how many males there are.\n\n60% of 100 employees are male, which means:\n\nNumber of males = 60% of 100 = 0.60 * 100 = 60 males\n\nNow, the rest of the employees must be female. So:\n\nNumber of females = Total employees - Number of males = 100 - 60 = 40 females\n\nNext, it says that 25% of the males have a college degree. So, let's find out how many male employees have a college degree.\n\nNumber of males with a college degree = 25% of 60 = 0.25 * 60 = 15 males\n\nNow, the overall percentage of employees with a college degree is 35%. So, let's find out the total number of employees with a college degree.\n\nTotal number of employees with a college degree = 35% of 100 = 0.35 * 100 = 35 employees\n\nOkay, so out of these 35 employees with a college degree, we already know that 15 are males. So, the remaining must be females.\n\nNumber of females with a college degree = Total with degree - Number of males with degree = 35 - 15 = 20 females\n\nWait a minute, but we should double-check this to make sure we're not missing anything. Let's see:\n\nTotal employees: 100\n\nMales: 60\n\nFemales: 40\n\nMales with college degree: 15\n\nTotal with college degree: 35\n\nSo, females with college degree: 35 - 15 = 20\n\nThat seems straightforward. But just to be thorough, let's see what percentage of females have a college degree.\n\nPercentage of females with college degree = (Number of females with degree / Total females) * 100 = (20 / 40) * 100 = 50%\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, 50% of the females have a college degree. But the question doesn't ask for the percentage; it asks for the number of female employees with a college degree. Which, as we've calculated, is 20.\n\nLet me just verify if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using proportions or equations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet F be the number of female employees with a college degree.\n\nWe know:\n\nTotal employees with degree = males with degree + females with degree\n\n35 = 15 + F\n\nSo, F = 35 - 15 = 20\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nAlternatively, we could set up an equation based on percentages, but since we have clear numbers, it's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can check if the overall percentage makes sense with these numbers.\n\nTotal with degree: 35 out of 100, which is indeed 35%.\n\nMales with degree: 15 out of 60, which is 25%.\n\nFemales with degree: 20 out of 40, which is 50%.\n\nOverall, (15 + 20)/100 = 35%, which matches the given overall percentage.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nTherefore, the number of female employees with a college degree is 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
