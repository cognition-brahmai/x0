        "content": "No, wooden pencils do not contain lead as their core. The core of a wooden pencil is made of graphite and clay. The misconception arises because the term \"lead pencil\" is often used to refer to wooden pencils, but this is a misnomer. The term \"lead\" in this context comes from the Old English word \"lead,\" which referred to the mineral graphite. So, while the core is sometimes called \"lead,\" it is actually graphite mixed with clay for binding and to control the hardness or softness of the pencil lead."
