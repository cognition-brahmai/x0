        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to create a Go program that generates random math problems based on user input. The user should be able to choose the difficulty level, and the program should present problems involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. After the user answers, the program should tell them if they're right or wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes different difficulty levels in math problems. Maybe for easier levels, the numbers are smaller, and for harder levels, the numbers are larger. I should probably ask the user to input a difficulty level, maybe from 1 to 5.\n\nNext, I need to generate random numbers based on the difficulty level. For example, difficulty 1 could be numbers between 0 and 10, difficulty 2 between 0 and 20, and so on.\n\nThen, I need to randomly select the type of operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. I can use Go's math/rand package to generate random numbers and select operations.\n\nI should also consider how to handle division problems. Maybe I should ensure that the division results in an integer to keep it simple, at least for lower difficulty levels.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the program:\n\n1. Prompt the user to enter the difficulty level.\n\n2. Based on the difficulty level, generate two random numbers.\n\n3. Randomly select one of the four operations.\n\n4. Present the problem to the user.\n\n5. Read the user's answer.\n\n6. Check if the answer is correct and provide feedback.\n\nI should also handle cases where the user might enter invalid input, like non-numeric answers.\n\nMaybe I can create a loop that continues to generate problems until the user decides to quit.\n\nLet me start by importing the necessary packages. I'll need \"fmt\" for input and output, \"math/rand\" for generating random numbers, and \"time\" to seed the random number generator.\n\nI should seed the random number generator with the current time to ensure different sequences of random numbers on each run.\n\nNow, for defining difficulty levels, I can create a map or an array that specifies the range of numbers based on the difficulty level.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Difficulty 1: numbers between 0 and 10\n\n- Difficulty 2: numbers between 0 and 20\n\n- Difficulty 3: numbers between 0 and 50\n\n- Difficulty 4: numbers between 0 and 100\n\n- Difficulty 5: numbers between 0 and 1000\n\nI need to make sure that for division, the numerator is a multiple of the denominator to avoid fractions, especially for lower difficulty levels.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should only allow division in higher difficulty levels and ensure that the result is an integer.\n\nWait, perhaps I can adjust the difficulty not only by the range of numbers but also by the operations allowed. For example, difficulty 1 could have only addition and subtraction, while higher difficulties include multiplication and division.\n\nThat might be a better approach.\n\nSo, for difficulty 1: addition and subtraction with small numbers.\n\nDifficulty 2: addition, subtraction with larger numbers, and maybe introduction of multiplication.\n\nDifficulty 3: all operations with larger numbers.\n\nDifficulty 4: all operations with very large numbers, including division that may result in decimals.\n\nDifficulty 5: all operations with very large numbers and possible decimals.\n\nBut to keep it simple, maybe I'll stick with integer results only.\n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\n- Seed the random number generator.\n\n- Prompt the user for the difficulty level.\n\n- Validate the difficulty level (must be between 1 and 5).\n\n- Based on the difficulty level, determine the range for the numbers and the operations allowed.\n\n- Generate two random numbers within the specified range.\n\n- Select a random operation from the allowed operations.\n\n- If division is selected, ensure that the numbers are divisible without remainder.\n\n- Present the problem to the user.\n\n- Read the user's answer.\n\n- Check if the answer is correct and provide feedback.\n\n- Ask if the user wants to continue or quit.\n\nI need to handle different operations differently, especially division.\n\nMaybe I can use a switch statement based on the operation selected.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of negative numbers, but perhaps that can be reserved for higher difficulty levels.\n\nLet me assign ranges and operations based on difficulty levels:\n\nDifficulty 1:\n\n- Numbers: 0 to 10\n\n- Operations: addition, subtraction\n\nDifficulty 2:\n\n- Numbers: 0 to 20\n\n- Operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication\n\nDifficulty 3:\n\n- Numbers: 0 to 50\n\n- Operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division\n\nDifficulty 4:\n\n- Numbers: 0 to 100\n\n- Operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division\n\nDifficulty 5:\n\n- Numbers: 0 to 1000\n\n- Operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division\n\nFor division, I need to ensure that the dividend is divisible by the divisor without a remainder.\n\nTo do this, I can generate the divisor first, then generate a quotient, and set the dividend to be the product of the divisor and quotient.\n\nThis way, the division will always result in an integer.\n\nFor example, if the divisor is 5 and the quotient is 3, then the dividend is 15, and 15 / 5 = 3.\n\nThis ensures that the division problems have integer answers.\n\nI should implement this logic for division problems.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nI can define constants or variables for the difficulty levels and their corresponding number ranges and operations.\n\nMaybe create a struct to hold the difficulty settings.\n\nSomething like:\n\ntype DifficultySettings struct {\n\n MinNumber int\n\n MaxNumber int\n\n Operations []string\n\n}\n\nThen, create a slice of DifficultySettings for levels 1 to 5.\n\nBut since difficulty levels are from 1 to 5, I can use an array or a slice indexed by difficulty level.\n\nWait, in Go, array indices start at 0, but difficulty levels start at 1, so I'll need to adjust for that.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a map with difficulty levels as keys.\n\nBut for simplicity, I can use a slice and have an empty element at index 0 to make indices match difficulty levels.\n\nFor example:\n\ndifficultySettings := []DifficultySettings{\n\n // Index 0 is unused\n\n {\n\n MinNumber: 0,\n\n MaxNumber: 10,\n\n Operations: []string{\"+\", \"-\"},\n\n },\n\n {\n\n MinNumber: 0,\n\n MaxNumber: 20,\n\n Operations: []string{\"+\", \"-\", \"*\"},\n\n },\n\n {\n\n MinNumber: 0,\n\n MaxNumber: 50,\n\n Operations: []string{\"+\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\"},\n\n },\n\n {\n\n MinNumber: 0,\n\n MaxNumber: 100,\n\n Operations: []string{\"+\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\"},\n\n },\n\n {\n\n MinNumber: 0,\n\n MaxNumber: 1000,\n\n Operations: []string{\"+\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\"},\n\n },\n\n}\n\nThat way, difficultySettings[1] corresponds to difficulty level 1, and so on.\n\nNow, to generate random numbers within the specified range, I can use rand.Intn(max - min + 1) + min.\n\nBut I need to make sure that for division, the divisor is not zero.\n\nAlso, for subtraction, I should consider whether to allow negative results or not.\n\nPerhaps in lower difficulty levels, avoid negative results.\n\nTo do that, when generating numbers for subtraction, ensure that the first number is greater than or equal to the second number.\n\nFor division, as mentioned earlier, generate the dividend as a multiple of the divisor to ensure integer division.\n\nLet me think about how to select the operation randomly from the allowed operations for the difficulty level.\n\nI can generate a random index within the range of the operations slice and select the operation at that index.\n\nNow, for each operation, I need to construct the problem string and compute the correct answer.\n\nFor addition: \"a + b = ?\"\n\nSubtraction: \"a - b = ?\"\n\nMultiplication: \"a * b = ?\"\n\nDivision: \"a / b = ?\"\n\nThen, read the user's input, compare it to the correct answer, and provide feedback.\n\nI should handle cases where the user enters non-numeric input.\n\nIn Go, I can use fmt.Scanln to read user input, and then use strconv.Atoi to convert the input to an integer.\n\nIf the conversion fails, I can inform the user to enter a valid number.\n\nAlso, I should consider floating point answers, but since I'm dealing with integer division only, the answer should be an integer.\n\nBut if I decide to include decimal division in higher difficulty levels, I'll need to adjust accordingly.\n\nFor now, let's keep it to integer answers only.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline of the program flow:\n\n1. Import necessary packages.\n\n2. Seed the random number generator.\n\n3. Define difficulty settings.\n\n4. Prompt the user to enter the difficulty level.\n\n5. Read and validate the difficulty level.\n\n6. Based on the difficulty level, get the number range and allowed operations.\n\n7. Generate two random numbers within the range.\n\n8. Select a random operation from the allowed operations.\n\n9. If the operation is division, ensure that the dividend is divisible by the divisor.\n\n10. Present the problem to the user.\n\n11. Read the user's answer.\n\n12. Check if the answer is correct and provide feedback.\n\n13. Ask if the user wants to continue or quit.\n\nI should wrap steps 7 through 13 in a loop that continues until the user decides to quit.\n\nLet me think about how to implement step 9, ensuring that the dividend is divisible by the divisor.\n\nOne way is:\n\n- Generate the divisor first.\n\n- Generate the quotient.\n\n- Set the dividend to be divisor * quotient.\n\nThis ensures that dividend / divisor = quotient, with no remainder.\n\nSo, for division, I generate divisor and quotient, then set dividend = divisor * quotient.\n\nThen, the problem is \"dividend / divisor = ?\" and the correct answer is quotient.\n\nThis way, I avoid any division that would result in a fraction.\n\nI need to ensure that divisor is not zero.\n\nIn Go's math/rand package, rand.Intn(n) generates a random integer in the range [0, n), so I can generate divisor as rand.Intn(max - min + 1) + min, ensuring that min is at least 1 to avoid zero.\n\nWait, but in difficulty settings, min is 0 for all levels.\n\nSo, for division, I need to ensure that the divisor is at least 1.\n\nTherefore, when generating the divisor, I should set minDivisor to 1, not the difficulty's minNumber.\n\nWait, but in the difficultySettings, minNumber is 0 for all levels.\n\nMaybe I should have separate settings for divisors in division problems.\n\nAlternatively, I can set minDivisor to 1 when generating divisors.\n\nLet me adjust the difficultySettings to have minNumber and maxNumber for operands, and minDivisor and maxDivisor for division problems.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to have minNumber and maxNumber for all operands, and ensure that for division, divisor >= 1.\n\nSo, in the division case, when generating the divisor, set divisor = rand.Intn(maxNumber - minNumber + 1) + minNumber, but if minNumber is 0, ensure that divisor != 0.\n\nTo simplify, I can set minDivisor to 1 for division problems.\n\nSo, in the division case, generate divisor = rand.Intn(maxNumber - 1 + 1) + 1, ensuring divisor is at least 1.\n\nThen, generate quotient = rand.Intn(maxNumber - minNumber + 1) + minNumber.\n\nFinally, set dividend = divisor * quotient.\n\nThis way, dividend / divisor = quotient, and it's guaranteed to be an integer.\n\nI need to handle this logic separately when the operation is division.\n\nFor other operations, generate two random numbers within minNumber and maxNumber.\n\nFor subtraction, ensure that a >= b to avoid negative results, at least in lower difficulty levels.\n\nWait, but in higher difficulty levels, maybe I can allow negative results.\n\nPerhaps I can adjust this based on the difficulty level.\n\nFor example, in difficulty levels 1 and 2, ensure that a >= b in subtraction to avoid negatives.\n\nIn levels 3 and above, allow a < b, so negative results are possible.\n\nThis adds another dimension to the difficulty.\n\nSo, in the DifficultySettings, I can have an flag indicating whether negative results are allowed.\n\nLet me add another field to DifficultySettings: AllowNegativeResults bool.\n\nThen, for subtraction:\n\n- If AllowNegativeResults is true, generate a and b randomly within minNumber and maxNumber.\n\n- If AllowNegativeResults is false, generate a >= b.\n\nThis way, I can control whether subtraction problems can have negative answers based on the difficulty level.\n\nLooking back at my earlier difficulty settings:\n\nDifficulty 1:\n\n- MinNumber: 0\n\n- MaxNumber: 10\n\n- Operations: \"+\", \"-\"\n\n- AllowNegativeResults: false\n\nDifficulty 2:\n\n- MinNumber: 0\n\n- MaxNumber: 20\n\n- Operations: \"+\", \"-\", \"*\"\n\n- AllowNegativeResults: false\n\nDifficulty 3:\n\n- MinNumber: 0\n\n- MaxNumber: 50\n\n- Operations: \"+\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\"\n\n- AllowNegativeResults: true\n\nDifficulty 4:\n\n- MinNumber: 0\n\n- MaxNumber: 100\n\n- Operations: \"+\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\"\n\n- AllowNegativeResults: true\n\nDifficulty 5:\n\n- MinNumber: 0\n\n- MaxNumber: 1000\n\n- Operations: \"+\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\"\n\n- AllowNegativeResults: true\n\nThis seems reasonable.\n\nNow, for subtraction, if AllowNegativeResults is false, I need to generate a and b such that a >= b.\n\nTo do this, I can generate b first, then generate a such that a >= b.\n\nAlternatively, generate a first, then generate b such that b <= a.\n\nEither way works.\n\nI think generating a first, then generating b between minNumber and a inclusive would be fine.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure the code.\n\nI can define a function to generate a random problem based on the difficulty level.\n\nThis function would:\n\n- Select a random operation from the allowed operations.\n\n- Based on the operation, generate the operands accordingly.\n\n- For division, generate divisor and quotient, then set dividend = divisor * quotient.\n\n- For subtraction, ensure that a >= b if negative results are not allowed.\n\n- Return the problem string and the correct answer.\n\nThen, in the main function, I can loop:\n\n- Prompt for difficulty level.\n\n- Generate a problem.\n\n- Present it to the user.\n\n- Read and check the answer.\n\n- Provide feedback.\n\n- Ask if the user wants to continue.\n\nI should also handle cases where the user wants to exit the program.\n\nPerhaps allow the user to type 'quit' or 'exit' to stop the program.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement the problem generation function.\n\nSignature could be:\n\nfunc generateProblem(settings DifficultySettings) (string, int)\n\nwhere it returns the problem string and the correct answer.\n\nInside the function:\n\n- Select a random operation from settings.Operations.\n\n- Based on the operation:\n\n- \"+\": generate a and b randomly within minNumber and maxNumber.\n\n- \"-\": generate a and b, ensuring a >= b if not allowing negative results.\n\n- \"*\": generate a and b randomly within minNumber and maxNumber.\n\n- \"/\": generate divisor and quotient, set dividend = divisor * quotient.\n\n- Construct the problem string.\n\n- Compute the correct answer.\n\n- Return the problem string and the correct answer.\n\nI need to make sure that all variables are properly scoped and that there are no overlaps in variable names.\n\nAlso, I should ensure that the random number generation is consistent and that the seed is set only once at the beginning.\n\nLet me think about error handling.\n\n- If the user enters an invalid difficulty level, prompt again.\n\n- If the user enters non-numeric answers, inform them and ask again.\n\n- For division, ensure that divisor is not zero, but since we're setting minDivisor to 1, this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nI should also consider that in higher difficulty levels, with larger numbers, the results of multiplication and addition could be very large, possibly exceeding the limits of int type in Go.\n\nBut in Go, int can be 32-bit or 64-bit depending on the system, so for difficulty 5 with numbers up to 1000, the maximum multiplication is 1000*1000=1,000,000, which is well within the range of int.\n\nStill, I should be mindful of potential integer overflows in higher difficulty levels, but for now, int should suffice.\n\nLet me consider writing a small function to get user input and validate it as an integer.\n\nSomething like:\n\nfunc readInt(prompt string) int {\n\n for {\n\n fmt.Print(prompt)\n\n var input string\n\n fmt.Scanln(&input)\n\n if value, err := strconv.Atoi(input); err == nil {\n\n return value\n\n }\n\n fmt.Println(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n }\n\n}\n\nThis function will keep asking the user until they enter a valid integer.\n\nSimilarly, I can create a function to get the difficulty level, validating that it's between 1 and 5.\n\nfunc readDifficulty() int {\n\n for {\n\n difficulty := readInt(\"Enter difficulty level (1-5): \")\n\n if difficulty >= 1 && difficulty <= 5 {\n\n return difficulty\n\n }\n\n fmt.Println(\"Difficulty level must be between 1 and 5.\")\n\n }\n\n}\n\nThis ensures that the difficulty level is within the acceptable range.\n\nNow, for generating random numbers, I need to seed the random number generator once at the beginning.\n\nI can do this in the main function using rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano()).\n\nNow, let's think about how to select a random operation from the allowed operations.\n\nI can get the list of operations from the difficulty settings, generate a random index within the length of the operations slice, and select the operation at that index.\n\nFor example:\n\noperation := settings.Operations[rand.Intn(len(settings.Operations))]\n\nThis will give me a random operation from the allowed list.\n\nNow, based on the operation, I need to generate the operands accordingly.\n\nLet's consider each operation:\n\nAddition:\n\n- Generate a and b randomly within minNumber and maxNumber.\n\nSubtraction:\n\n- If AllowNegativeResults is true, generate a and b randomly.\n\n- If false, generate a >= b.\n\nMultiplication:\n\n- Generate a and b randomly within minNumber and maxNumber.\n\nDivision:\n\n- Generate divisor and quotient within minNumber and maxNumber, ensuring divisor >= 1.\n\n- Set dividend = divisor * quotient.\n\nThen, construct the problem string and compute the correct answer.\n\nFor example:\n\nswitch operation {\n\ncase \"+\":\n\na := rand.Intn(settings.MaxNumber - settings.MinNumber + 1) + settings.MinNumber\n\nb := rand.Intn(settings.MaxNumber - settings.MinNumber + 1) + settings.MinNumber\n\nproblem := fmt.Sprintf(\"%d + %d = \", a, b)\n\nanswer := a + b\n\ncase \"-\":\n\nif settings.AllowNegativeResults {\n\na := rand.Intn(settings.MaxNumber - settings.MinNumber + 1) + settings.MinNumber\n\nb := rand.Intn(settings.MaxNumber - settings.MinNumber + 1) + settings.MinNumber\n\nproblem := fmt.Sprintf(\"%d - %d = \", a, b)\n\nanswer := a - b\n\n} else {\n\na := rand.Intn(settings.MaxNumber - settings.MinNumber + 1) + settings.MinNumber\n\nb := rand.Intn(a - settings.MinNumber + 1) + settings.MinNumber\n\nproblem := fmt.Sprintf(\"%d - %d = \", a, b)\n\nanswer := a - b\n\n}\n\ncase \"*\":\n\na := rand.Intn(settings.MaxNumber - settings.MinNumber + 1) + settings.MinNumber\n\nb := rand.Intn(settings.MaxNumber - settings.MinNumber + 1) + settings.MinNumber\n\nproblem := fmt.Sprintf(\"%d * %d = \", a, b)\n\nanswer := a * b\n\ncase \"/\":\n\ndivisor := rand.Intn(settings.MaxNumber - 1 + 1) + 1 // Ensure divisor is at least 1\n\nquotient := rand.Intn(settings.MaxNumber - settings.MinNumber + 1) + settings.MinNumber\n\ndividend := divisor * quotient\n\nproblem := fmt.Sprintf(\"%d / %d = \", dividend, divisor)\n\nanswer := quotient\n\n}\n\nThis covers all the cases.\n\nNow, in the main function, I can loop indefinitely, generating problems and checking answers, until the user decides to quit.\n\nI should prompt the user after each problem to see if they want to continue or quit.\n\nIf they choose to quit, exit the loop and end the program.\n\nI can handle this by reading input after each problem and checking if it's 'quit' or 'exit'.\n\nBut since I'm already using readInt for numeric input, I need a different function to read strings.\n\nPerhaps modify the readInt function to handle string inputs as well.\n\nAlternatively, create a separate function to read a string input.\n\nFor example:\n\nfunc readString(prompt string) string {\n\n fmt.Print(prompt)\n\n var input string\n\n fmt.Scanln(&input)\n\n return input\n\n}\n\nThen, after each problem, ask \"Press Enter to continue or type 'quit' to exit.\"\n\nIf the input is 'quit', break the loop.\n\nOtherwise, continue to the next problem.\n\nThis way, the user can choose when to stop.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure the DifficultySettings.\n\nDefine a struct:\n\ntype DifficultySettings struct {\n\n MinNumber int\n\n MaxNumber int\n\n Operations []string\n\n AllowNegativeResults bool\n\n}\n\nThen, define the difficulty settings as a slice:\n\ndifficultySettings := []DifficultySettings{\n\n // Index 0 is unused\n\n {\n\n MinNumber: 0,\n\n MaxNumber: 10,\n\n Operations: []string{\"+\", \"-\"},\n\n AllowNegativeResults: false,\n\n },\n\n {\n\n MinNumber: 0,\n\n MaxNumber: 20,\n\n Operations: []string{\"+\", \"-\", \"*\"},\n\n AllowNegativeResults: false,\n\n },\n\n {\n\n MinNumber: 0,\n\n MaxNumber: 50,\n\n Operations: []string{\"+\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\"},\n\n AllowNegativeResults: true,\n\n },\n\n {\n\n MinNumber: 0,\n\n MaxNumber: 100,\n\n Operations: []string{\"+\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\"},\n\n AllowNegativeResults: true,\n\n },\n\n {\n\n MinNumber: 0,\n\n MaxNumber: 1000,\n\n Operations: []string{\"+\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\"},\n\n AllowNegativeResults: true,\n\n },\n\n}\n\nNow, in the main function:\n\n- Seed the random number generator.\n\n- Prompt the user for the difficulty level using readDifficulty().\n\n- Get the corresponding DifficultySettings.\n\n- Loop:\n\n- Generate a problem using generateProblem(settings).\n\n- Present the problem to the user.\n\n- Read the user's answer using readInt.\n\n- Check if the answer matches the correct answer.\n\n- Provide feedback: \"Correct!\" or \"Incorrect. The correct answer is X.\"\n\n- Ask if the user wants to continue or quit.\n\n- If quit, break the loop.\n\nThis should cover the basic functionality.\n\nLet me think about how to make the program more user-friendly.\n\n- Provide clear instructions at the beginning.\n\n- Handle all possible edge cases.\n\n- Ensure that the program doesn't crash on invalid input.\n\n- Maybe include a feature to track the user's score, like the number of correct answers in a row.\n\nBut for now, let's keep it simple and focus on generating problems and checking answers.\n\nI should also make sure that the program doesn't generate problems with one of the operands being zero in division, but since the divisor is generated separately and ensured to be at least 1, this shouldn't be a problem.\n\nWait, but in division, the dividend can be zero if the quotient is zero, but zero divided by any number is zero, which is fine.\n\nSo, no issues there.\n\nLet me summarize the steps again:\n\n1. Import necessary packages: \"fmt\", \"math/rand\", \"time\", \"strconv\".\n\n2. Define the DifficultySettings struct.\n\n3. Define the slice of DifficultySettings for levels 1 to 5.\n\n4. Define functions:\n\n- readInt(prompt string) int: reads and validates integer input.\n\n- readString(prompt string) string: reads string input.\n\n- generateProblem(settings DifficultySettings) (string, int): generates a random problem based on settings and returns the problem string and correct answer.\n\n5. In the main function:\n\n- Seed the random number generator with time.Now().UnixNano().\n\n- Prompt the user for the difficulty level using readDifficulty().\n\n- Get the corresponding DifficultySettings.\n\n- Loop:\n\n- Generate a problem using generateProblem(settings).\n\n- Print the problem.\n\n- Read the user's answer using readInt.\n\n- Check if the answer matches the correct answer.\n\n- Print feedback.\n\n- Ask if the user wants to continue or quit.\n\n- If the user types 'quit', exit the loop.\n\nThis should cover all the requirements.\n\nNow, I can start writing the actual code based on this plan.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Golang program that generates random math problems based on user input, follow the steps below. This program will offer varying difficulty levels and provide feedback on the user's answers.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels**: Define different difficulty levels with increasing ranges of numbers and supported operations.\n2. **Random Problem Generation**: Generate random numbers and operations based on the selected difficulty.\n3. **User Interaction**: Prompt the user for answers and provide feedback on correctness.\n4. **Error Handling**: Ensure the program handles invalid inputs gracefully.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"flag\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"math/rand\"\n\t\"strconv\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n\ntype DifficultySettings struct {\n\tMinNumber         int\n\tMaxNumber         int\n\tOperations        []string\n\tAllowNegativeResults bool\n}\n\nvar difficultySettings = []DifficultySettings{\n\t// Index 0 is unused\n\t{\n\t\tMinNumber:         0,\n\t\tMaxNumber:         10,\n\t\tOperations:        []string{\"+\", \"-\"},\n\t\tAllowNegativeResults: false,\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tMinNumber:         0,\n\t\tMaxNumber:         20,\n\t\tOperations:        []string{\"+\", \"-\", \"*\"},\n\t\tAllowNegativeResults: false,\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tMinNumber:         0,\n\t\tMaxNumber:         50,\n\t\tOperations:        []string{\"+\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\"},\n\t\tAllowNegativeResults: true,\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tMinNumber:         0,\n\t\tMaxNumber:         100,\n\t\tOperations:        []string{\"+\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\"},\n\t\tAllowNegativeResults: true,\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tMinNumber:         0,\n\t\tMaxNumber:         1000,\n\t\tOperations:        []string{\"+\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\"},\n\t\tAllowNegativeResults: true,\n\t},\n}\n\nfunc readInt(prompt string) int {\n\tfor {\n\t\tfmt.Print(prompt)\n\t\tvar input string\n\t\tfmt.Scanln(&input)\n\t\tif value, err := strconv.Atoi(input); err == nil {\n\t\t\treturn value\n\t\t}\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Invalid input.
