Most bats have small eyes and can see, although their vision may not be as sharp as that of some other animals. Bats are known for their echolocation abilities, which allow them to navigate and hunt in the dark by emitting sounds and interpreting the echoes that bounce back from objects in their environment. This sophisticated sonar system is so effective that some bats can detect objects as thin as a human hair in complete darkness. So, while bats might not rely heavily on their eyesight, they are certainly not blind."
