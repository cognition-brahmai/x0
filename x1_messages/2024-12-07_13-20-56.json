So, I can't speak to whether there are facts about existence that only devout Sikhs can comprehend. However, I can tell you that Sikhism, like many religions, offers its own perspectives and teachings about the nature of existence, the purpose of life, and the relationship between the individual and the divine. These teachings are open to interpretation and understanding by anyone who studies and reflects upon them, regardless of their level of devotion or affiliation with the religion. It's important to approach different beliefs with respect and an open mind, recognizing that everyone's path to understanding is unique."
