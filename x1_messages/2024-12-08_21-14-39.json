        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a village with 10 families, and each family has either one child or two children. The total number of children in the village is 13. We need to find out how many families have two children.\n\nFirst, let's define our variables to make things clearer. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of families with one child.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of families with two children.\n\nNow, since there are 10 families in total, we can write the first equation as:\n\n\\[ x + y = 10 \\]\n\nNext, considering the total number of children, families with one child contribute \\( x \\) children, and families with two children contribute \\( 2y \\) children. The total number of children is 13, so we can write the second equation as:\n\n\\[ x + 2y = 13 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 10 \\)\n\n2. \\( x + 2y = 13 \\)\n\nTo solve for \\( y \\), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n\\[ (x + 2y) - (x + y) = 13 - 10 \\]\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n\\[ x + 2y - x - y = 3 \\]\n\n\\[ y = 3 \\]\n\nSo, there are 3 families with two children.\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we can substitute \\( y = 3 \\) back into the first equation:\n\n\\[ x + 3 = 10 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 10 - 3 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 7 \\]\n\nSo, there are 7 families with one child and 3 families with two children.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it adds up. If there are 7 families with one child, that's 7 children, and 3 families with two children, that's 6 children. Total children: 7 + 6 = 13, which matches the given total.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it in a different way. If all 10 families had one child, there would be 10 children in total. But we're told there are 13 children, which is 3 more than 10. Each family that has two children instead of one adds one extra child. Therefore, to account for the additional 3 children, there must be 3 families with two children.\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the number of families with two children is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
