        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a Python script that fetches cryptocurrency prices from a remote API. We'll use the CoinGecko API because it's reliable and easy to use. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Install Required Libraries\n\nFirst, you need to install the `requests` library if you haven't already. This library allows you to send HTTP requests easily.\n\nYou can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install requests\n```\n\n### Step 2: Import Libraries\n\nIn your Python script, import the necessary libraries:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n```\n\n### Step 3: List of Supported Cryptocurrencies\n\nDefine a list of supported cryptocurrencies with their CoinGecko IDs. For example:\n\n```python\ncryptocurrencies = {\n    \"Bitcoin\": \"bitcoin\",\n    \"Ethereum\": \"ethereum\",\n    \"Binance Coin\": \"binancecoin\",\n    \"Cardano\": \"cardano\",\n    \"Solana\": \"solana\"\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Function to Fetch Price Data\n\nCreate a function that fetches the current price and percentage change in the last 24 hours for a given cryptocurrency.\n\n```python\ndef get_crypto_price(crypto_id):\n    url = f\"https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids={crypto_id}&vs_currencies=usd&include_24hr_change=true\"\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    data = response.json()\n    \n    if crypto_id in data:\n        price = data[crypto_id]['usd']\n        change = data[crypto_id]['usd_24h_change']\n        return price, change\n    else:\n        return None, None\n```\n\n### Step 5: User Interaction\n\nAllow the user to select a cryptocurrency from the list and display the current price and percentage change.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    print(\"Supported Cryptocurrencies:\")\n    for idx, crypto in enumerate(cryptocurrencies.keys(), start=1):\n        print(f\"{idx}. {crypto}\")\n    \n    choice = int(input(\"Enter the number corresponding to your choice: \"))\n    crypto_name = list(cryptocurrencies.keys())[choice - 1]\n    crypto_id = cryptocurrencies[crypto_name]\n    \n    price, change = get_crypto_price(crypto_id)\n    \n    if price is not None and change is not None:\n        print(f\"\\nCurrent Price of {crypto_name}: ${price:.2f}\")\n        print(f\"Percentage Change in last 24 hours: {change:.2f}%\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Failed to retrieve data. Please try again later.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **List of Supported Cryptocurrencies:** We define a dictionary mapping cryptocurrency names to their CoinGecko IDs.\n2. **Fetching Data:** The `get_crypto_price` function constructs a URL to query the CoinGecko API for the current price and 24-hour percentage change in USD.\n3. **User Interaction:** The `main` function displays the list of supported cryptocurrencies, takes user input to select one, fetches the data, and displays it.\n\nThis script provides a simple way for users to check the current price and recent performance of their chosen cryptocurrency.\n"
