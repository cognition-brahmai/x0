        "content": "Let's see here. I have this question about organic chemistry, and it's asking for the IUPAC name of a compound with the molecular formula C6H14. The options are A. Hexane, B. Pentane, C. Butane, D. Methane, and E. None of the above.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what IUPAC naming is. IUPAC stands for the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, and they have set rules for naming chemical compounds to ensure consistency and clarity in communication.\n\nNow, the molecular formula is C6H14. I remember that hydrocarbons, which are compounds consisting only of carbon and hydrogen, have different types based on their structure. The main types are alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes, but in this case, since the formula is C6H14, which matches the general formula for alkanes, which is CnH2n+2.\n\nLet me confirm that for n=6, the formula should be C6H14. Yes, because 2*6 + 2 = 14. So, it's an alkane.\n\nAlkanes are named based on the number of carbon atoms in the longest continuous chain. The prefix indicates the number of carbon atoms, and the suffix is \"-ane\" for alkanes.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Hexane - \"hex\" means six, so hexane would be C6H14.\n\nB. Pentane - \"pent\" means five, so pentane would be C5H12.\n\nC. Butane - \"but\" means four, so butane would be C4H10.\n\nD. Methane - \"meth\" means one, so methane is CH4.\n\nE. None of the above.\n\nSo, clearly, hexane is the correct name for C6H14.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if there are any structural isomers for C6H14. Alkanes can have different structural arrangements of carbon atoms, leading to different isomers.\n\nFor hexane, there are multiple isomers:\n\n1. n-hexane: straight-chain hexane.\n\n2. 2-methylpentane.\n\n3. 3-methylpentane.\n\n4. 2,2-dimethylbutane.\n\n5. 2,3-dimethylbutane.\n\nSo, hexane can refer to the parent structure, which is n-hexane, or it can include these branched isomers.\n\nBut in the context of this question, where it's just asking for the IUPAC name based on the molecular formula, and without specifying a particular structure, I think the answer is simply hexane.\n\nAlso, looking back at the options, none of them suggest specific isomers; they are just giving general names based on the number of carbon atoms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Hexane.\n\nBut to double-check, let's consider if C6H14 could be named something else. For example, if it were a cycloalkane, like cyclohexane, that would have the formula C6H12, which is different from C6H14. So, C6H14 is not a cycloalkane.\n\nAlternatively, if it were an alkene, with a double bond, the general formula would be CnH2n, which for n=6 would be C6H12, again not matching C6H14.\n\nSimilarly, alkynes have the formula CnH2n-2, so for n=6, it would be C6H10, which again doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, C6H14 must be an alkane with six carbon atoms, and its IUPAC name is hexane.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Hexane.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
