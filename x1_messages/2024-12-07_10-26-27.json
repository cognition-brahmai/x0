The expression is:\n\n(9 / 3 * 2)^2 - 10 + 4 * 3\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\n(9 / 3 * 2)\n\nI need to do the division and multiplication from left to right inside the parentheses.\n\nFirst, 9 divided by 3 is 3.\n\nSo, 9 / 3 = 3\n\nNow, multiply that result by 2:\n\n3 * 2 = 6\n\nSo, the expression inside the parentheses simplifies to 6.\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n6^2 - 10 + 4 * 3\n\nNext, exponents:\n\n6 squared is 36.\n\nSo, 6^2 = 36\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n36 - 10 + 4 * 3\n\nNext, multiplication and division from left to right.\n\nThere's a multiplication here: 4 * 3 = 12\n\nSo, the expression now is:\n\n36 - 10 + 12\n\nNow, addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nFirst, 36 - 10 = 26\n\nThen, 26 + 12 = 38\n\nSo, the final answer should be 38.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nStarting again:\n\n(9 / 3 * 2)^2 - 10 + 4 * 3\n\nParentheses first:\n\n9 / 3 * 2\n\nDivision and multiplication are equal in precedence, so we go left to right.\n\n9 / 3 = 3\n\n3 * 2 = 6\n\nSo, (6)^2 - 10 + 4 * 3\n\nThen, exponents:\n\n6^2 = 36\n\nNow, 36 - 10 + 4 * 3\n\nNext, multiplication:\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nSo, 36 - 10 + 12\n\nNow, addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\n36 - 10 = 26\n\n26 + 12 = 38\n\nYes, the final answer is 38.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{38} \\]"
