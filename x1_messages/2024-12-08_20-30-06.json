        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Node.js script that fetches weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API. I need to make sure it takes a city name from the command line and outputs the temperature, humidity, and weather description. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to sign up for an API key from OpenWeatherMap so I can make requests to their service. I've already done that, so I have my API key ready.\n\nNext, I need to set up a new Node.js project. I should create a new directory for this script and initialize a new Node.js project there. I can do this by running `npm init -y` to create a `package.json` file with default values.\n\nNow, I need to install any necessary packages. Since I'll be making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API, I can use the `axios` library for making GET requests. I'll install that by running `npm install axios`.\n\nOnce that's set up, I can start writing the script. I need to accept the city name from the command line arguments. In Node.js, command line arguments can be accessed through the `process.argv` array. The city name will be the second element in this array after the node executable and script name.\n\nSo, I'll grab the city name from `process.argv[2]`. I should also add some error handling in case the user doesn't provide a city name or if there are multiple arguments.\n\nNow, I need to construct the API URL for OpenWeatherMap. The basic endpoint for current weather data is `http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`. I need to append the city name and my API key to this URL.\n\nI should also specify the units I want the temperature in. OpenWeatherMap provides options for Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin. I think I'll go with Celsius for this example.\n\nSo, the URL will look something like this: `http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}&units=metric&appid={API key}`.\n\nI need to replace `{city name}` with the city name from the command line and `{API key}` with my actual API key.\n\nThen, I'll use axios to make a GET request to this URL. Once I get the response, I need to extract the temperature, humidity, and weather description from the JSON data.\n\nLooking at the OpenWeatherMap API documentation, the temperature is under `main.temp`, humidity is under `main.humidity`, and the weather description is under `weather[0].description`.\n\nSo, I'll access these properties from the response data and print them out to the console.\n\nI should also handle possible errors, such as the city not found or network issues. Axios provides a way to handle rejection promises, so I can catch any errors and display a user-friendly message.\n\nAdditionally, I might want to format the output nicely, maybe something like:\n\n\"Current weather in {city}:\n\nTemperature: {temp}\u00b0C\n\nHumidity: {humidity}%\n\nDescription: {description}\"\n\nAlright, I think that covers the main points. Let me start writing the script accordingly.\n\nFirst, I'll require the axios package:\n\n```javascript\n\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\n```\n\nThen, I'll get the city name from the command line arguments:\n\n```javascript\n\nconst city = process.argv[2];\n\nif (!city) {\n\n  console.log('Please provide a city name as a command line argument.');\n\n  process.exit(1);\n\n}\n\n```\n\nNext, I'll set up the API URL with my API key and the city name:\n\n```javascript\n\nconst apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';\n\nconst url = `http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&units=metric&appid=${apiKey}`;\n\n```\n\nNote: In a real-world scenario, I shouldn't hardcode the API key in the script. I should use environment variables to keep it secure. But for this simple example, I'll keep it hardcoded.\n\nNow, I'll make the GET request using axios:\n\n```javascript\n\naxios.get(url)\n\n  .then(response => {\n\n    const { temp, humidity } = response.data.main;\n\n    const { description } = response.data.weather[0];\n\n    console.log(`Current weather in ${city}:\n\nTemperature: ${temp}\u00b0C\n\nHumidity: ${humidity}%\n\nDescription: ${description}`);\n\n  })\n\n  .catch(error => {\n\n    if (error.response) {\n\n      // The request was made and the server responded with a status code\n\n      // that falls out of the range of 2xx\n\n      console.log(`Error: ${error.response.data.message}`);\n\n    } else if (error.request) {\n\n      // The request was made but no response was received\n\n      console.log('Error: No response from the server.');\n\n    } else {\n\n      // Something happened in setting up the request that triggered an Error\n\n      console.log('Error:', error.message);\n\n    }\n\n  });\n\n```\n\nI should replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' with my actual API key.\n\nLet me test this script with a city name. For example, if I run `node weather.js London`, it should fetch and display the current weather in London.\n\nI should also consider handling cases where the city name has multiple words, like \"New York\". In that case, I need to concatenate all arguments after the script name into a single string.\n\nTo do that, I can use `process.argv.slice(2).join(' ')` to get the city name.\n\nSo, I'll update the city name retrieval:\n\n```javascript\n\nconst city = process.argv.slice(2).join(' ');\n\nif (!city) {\n\n  console.log('Please provide a city name as a command line argument.');\n\n  process.exit(1);\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis way, if the user provides multiple words for the city name, they will be combined into a single string.\n\nAlright, I think this should work. Let me save this script as `weather.js` and test it with a few city names.\n\nFirst, I'll run `node weather.js London` and see if it fetches and displays the weather information correctly.\n\nThen, I'll try `node weather.js New York` to ensure that multi-word city names are handled properly.\n\nLastly, I'll test with a nonexistent city name to see if the error handling works as expected.\n\nIf everything checks out, I'll consider the script complete.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Node.js script that fetches the current weather information for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **Node.js installed** on your machine.\n2. **OpenWeatherMap API key**. Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to get your API key.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```javascript\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\n// Retrieve city name from command line arguments\nconst city = process.argv.slice(2).join(' ');\nif (!city) {\n  console.log('Please provide a city name as a command line argument.');\n  process.exit(1);\n}\n\n// Set up the API URL with your API key and the provided city name\nconst apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';\nconst url = `http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&units=metric&appid=${apiKey}`;\n\n// Make the GET request to fetch weather data\naxios.get(url)\n  .then(response => {\n    const { temp, humidity } = response.data.main;\n    const { description } = response.data.weather[0];\n    console.log(`Current weather in ${city}:\nTemperature: ${temp}\u00b0C\nHumidity: ${humidity}%\nDescription: ${description}`);\n  })\n  .catch(error => {\n    if (error.response) {\n      // The request was made and the server responded with a status code\n      // that falls out of the range of 2xx\n      console.log(`Error: ${error.response.data.message}`);\n    } else if (error.request) {\n      // The request was made but no response was received\n      console.log('Error: No response from the server.');\n    } else {\n      // Something happened in setting up the request that triggered an Error\n      console.log('Error:', error.message);\n    }\n  });\n```\n\n### Instructions\n\n1. **Set up a new Node.js project:**\n   - Create a new directory for your project.\n   - Initialize a new Node.js project by running `npm init -y`.\n\n2. **Install required packages:**\n   - Install `axios` by running `npm install axios`.\n\n3. **Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'`** with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key in the script.\n\n4. **Save the script:** Save the above code in a file named `weather.js` in your project directory.\n\n5. **Run the script:**\n   - Open your terminal or command prompt.\n   - Navigate to your project directory.\n   - Run the script by providing a city name as a command-line argument, e.g., `node weather.js London`.\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Command Line Arguments:** The city name is retrieved from the command line using `process.argv`.\n- **API Request:** The script constructs the API URL using the provided city name and API key, then uses `axios` to make a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API.\n- **Data Extraction:** Upon receiving the response, it extracts the temperature, humidity, and weather description and prints them to the console.\n- **Error Handling:** The script handles different types of errors that may occur during the API request, providing user-friendly error messages.\n\nThis script provides a simple way to fetch and display current weather information for any given city using the OpenWeatherMap API."
