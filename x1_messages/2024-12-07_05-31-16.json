Below is a Python function that implements the insertion sort algorithm to sort a list of strings in alphabetical order:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(strings):\n    for i in range(1, len(strings)):\n        key = strings[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and key < strings[j]:\n            strings[j + 1] = strings[j]\n            j -= 1\n        strings[j + 1] = key\n    return strings\n\n# Example usage:\n# sorted_list = insertion_sort([\"banana\", \"apple\", \"cherry\", \"date\"])\n# print(sorted_list)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through the list, starting from the second element (index 1). For each element, it is compared with the elements before it, and it is inserted into its correct position in the sorted portion of the list. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.\n\nYou can test this function with a list of strings, and it will return the list sorted in alphabetical order."
