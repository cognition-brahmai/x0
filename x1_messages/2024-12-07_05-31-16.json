        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangle, and we're told that its length is twice its width. Also, the perimeter of this rectangle is 36 inches. We need to find the dimensions, which means we need to find both the length and the width.\n\nFirst, let's recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. The perimeter (P) is the sum of all its sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the formula is:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times \\text{length} + 2 \\times \\text{width} \\]\n\nor more compactly,\n\n\\[ P = 2(l + w) \\]\n\nwhere \\( l \\) is the length and \\( w \\) is the width.\n\nNow, according to the problem, the length is twice the width. So, we can express the length in terms of the width:\n\n\\[ l = 2w \\]\n\nWe're also given that the perimeter is 36 inches:\n\n\\[ P = 36 \\]\n\nSo, plugging the expressions we have into the perimeter formula:\n\n\\[ 2(l + w) = 36 \\]\n\nBut since \\( l = 2w \\), we can substitute that in:\n\n\\[ 2(2w + w) = 36 \\]\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[ 2(3w) = 36 \\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 6w = 36 \\]\n\nNow, to find \\( w \\), divide both sides by 6:\n\n\\[ w = \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\]\n\nSo, the width is 6 inches.\n\nNow, since the length is twice the width:\n\n\\[ l = 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are:\n\n- Length: 12 inches\n\n- Width: 6 inches\n\nTo double-check, let's plug these values back into the perimeter formula:\n\n\\[ P = 2(l + w) = 2(12 + 6) = 2 \\times 18 = 36 \\]\n\nYes, that matches the given perimeter. So, our solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Length: } 12 \\text{ inches}, \\text{ Width: } 6 \\text{ inches}} \\]"
