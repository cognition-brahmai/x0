        "content": "In forensic science, determining the presence of gunshot residue (GSR) on a subject's hands is a critical aspect of crime scene investigation. Among the options provided, the most appropriate technique for this purpose is:\n\nC. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS)\n\nHere's why this is the preferred method:\n\n1. **SEM-EDS Capabilities**: SEM-EDS combines the high-resolution imaging capabilities of scanning electron microscopy with the elemental analysis provided by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. This combination allows for the visualization and identification of microscopic particles, making it ideal for detecting and characterizing GSR particles.\n\n2. **GSR Composition**: GSR typically consists of small particles containing elements such as lead, antimony, and barium, which are components of ammunition. SEM-EDS can detect and analyze these elements at the microscopic level, providing definitive evidence of GSR.\n\n3. **Other Options Explained**:\n   - **A. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)**: This technique is excellent for analyzing volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds but is not typically used for inorganic residues like GSR.\n   - **B. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)**: While AAS can detect specific elements, it requires liquid samples and is less suited for the particulate nature of GSR.\n   - **D. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)**: FTIR is used for identifying organic molecules based on their infrared absorption spectra. GSR, being primarily inorganic, is not well-suited for analysis by FTIR.\n\nTherefore, SEM-EDS is the gold standard in forensic science for detecting and analyzing gunshot residue due to its ability to identify the specific elements and morphological characteristics of GSR particles."
