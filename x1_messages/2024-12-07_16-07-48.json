        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a town where 70% of the men are married to 90% of the women. We need to find the minimum percentage of the population that is married. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, let's clarify what's being asked. We have to find the smallest possible percentage of the total population that is married, given those marriage rates for men and women.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let M be the number of men in the town.\n\n- Let W be the number of women in the town.\n\n- So, the total population is M + W.\n\nNow, 70% of the men are married, which means 0.7M men are married.\n\nSimilarly, 90% of the women are married, which means 0.9W women are married.\n\nBut wait, in reality, each marriage involves one man and one woman. So, the number of married men should equal the number of married women.\n\nWait, is that right? In reality, in a monogamous society, yes, each married man is married to one woman, and vice versa. So, the number of married men should equal the number of married women.\n\nBut here, it's given that 70% of men are married to 90% of women. That suggests that the number of married men is 0.7M and the number of married women is 0.9W, and these two numbers should be equal because each marriage connects one man and one woman.\n\nSo, 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nFrom this, we can express M in terms of W:\n\n0.7M = 0.9W => M = (0.9/0.7)W = (9/7)W.\n\nOkay, so M = (9/7)W.\n\nNow, the total population is M + W = (9/7)W + W = (16/7)W.\n\nNow, the total number of married people is the number of married men plus the number of married women, which is 0.7M + 0.9W.\n\nBut since 0.7M = 0.9W, we can say that the total number of married people is 0.7M + 0.7M = 1.4M, or 1.8W, since 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let's think carefully.\n\nIf 0.7M = 0.9W, then the number of married men equals the number of married women, which is 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nSo, total married people is 0.7M + 0.9W.\n\nBut since 0.7M = 0.9W, let's denote the number of married couples (and thus married men and women) as X.\n\nSo, X = 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nTherefore, total married people is X men + X women = 2X.\n\nNow, we need to find 2X as a percentage of the total population M + W.\n\nWe have M = (9/7)W from earlier.\n\nSo, total population is M + W = (9/7)W + W = (16/7)W.\n\nTotal married people is 2X = 2*(0.9W) = 1.8W.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the population that is married is (1.8W) / (16/7)W * 100% = (1.8 / (16/7)) * 100% = (1.8 * 7/16) * 100%.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n1.8 * 7 = 12.6\n\n12.6 / 16 = 0.7875\n\n0.7875 * 100% = 78.75%\n\nSo, the percentage is 78.75%.\n\nBut the question is asking for the minimum percentage. Is there a way to have a smaller percentage than this?\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there are people who are married outside of the town, which would mean that not all married men are married to women in the town, or vice versa.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"married to,\" which likely implies that the marriages are between men and women in the town.\n\nBut maybe not all married men are married to women in the town, or not all married women are married to men in the town.\n\nIf that's the case, then the number of married men could be married to women outside the town, and similarly for women.\n\nBut the problem specifies \"married to 90% of the women\" and \"married to 70% of the men,\" which suggests that the marriages are within the town.\n\nWait, but perhaps some men are married to women outside the town, and some women are married to men outside the town.\n\nIf that's allowed, then the overlap between married men and married women in the town could be less, potentially leading to a smaller total married population.\n\nBut the problem seems to imply that the marriages are within the town, given \"married to 90% of the women\" and \"70% of the men.\"\n\nPerhaps we need to consider that some people might be married to multiple partners, but the problem seems to suggest monogamous marriages.\n\nWait, perhaps the town has more men than women, and not all married men are married to women in the town.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose that some men are married to women in the town, and some are married outside the town.\n\nSimilarly, some women are married to men in the town, and some are married outside.\n\nIn this case, the number of married men in the town is 70% of men, and they are married to 90% of women in the town.\n\nBut if some men are married outside, then the number of married men is greater than the number of married women in the town.\n\nWait, but earlier we had 0.7M = 0.9W, assuming that all married men are married to women in the town and vice versa.\n\nBut perhaps that's not the case.\n\nMaybe only some of the married men are married to women in the town, and the rest are married outside.\n\nSimilarly, some married women are married to men in the town, and others are married outside.\n\nIn this scenario, the total number of married men is 70% of men, and the number married to women in the town is 0.7M, but some of them are married outside.\n\nSimilarly, the number of married women is 90% of women, and some are married to men in the town and some outside.\n\nIn this case, the number of marriages within the town is the minimum of 0.7M and 0.9W.\n\nWait, perhaps not the minimum, but the overlapping marriages.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me try to approach this differently.\n\nLet's consider the number of married men and married women.\n\nWe have 0.7M married men and 0.9W married women.\n\nEach marriage connects one man and one woman.\n\nSo, the number of marriages within the town is the minimum of the number of married men and married women, assuming that some may be married outside.\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, the number of marriages within the town is equal to the number of married men who are married to women in the town, which is 0.7M, and also equal to the number of married women who are married to men in the town, which is 0.9W.\n\nBut these two numbers must be equal because each marriage involves one man and one woman.\n\nTherefore, 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nSo, M = (9/7)W.\n\nTotal population is M + W = (9/7)W + W = (16/7)W.\n\nTotal married people are 0.7M + 0.9W = 0.7*(9/7)W + 0.9W = (6.3/7)W + 0.9W = (6.3/7 + 9/10)W.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n6.3/7 = 0.9\n\n0.9 + 0.9 = 1.8\n\nSo, total married people is 1.8W.\n\nTotal population is (16/7)W.\n\nTherefore, percentage married is (1.8W) / (16/7)W * 100% = (1.8 * 7 / 16) * 100% = (12.6 / 16) * 100% = 0.7875 * 100% = 78.75%.\n\nSo, the percentage is 78.75%.\n\nBut the question is asking for the minimum percentage.\n\nIs there a way to have a smaller percentage?\n\nWait, perhaps if some married men are married to women outside the town, and some married women are married to men outside the town, then the number of married people in the town could be less.\n\nLet me think about that.\n\nSuppose that some men are married outside the town, and some women are married outside the town.\n\nIn this case, the number of married men in the town is 70% of men, but only some of them are married to women in the town.\n\nSimilarly, 90% of women are married, but only some are married to men in the town.\n\nIn this scenario, the number of marriages within the town would be less than the minimum of 0.7M and 0.9W.\n\nWait, but in reality, the number of marriages within the town is equal to the number of married men who are married to women in the town, which could be less than 0.7M.\n\nSimilarly, it's equal to the number of married women who are married to men in the town, which could be less than 0.9W.\n\nBut to minimize the total married population, we need to maximize the number of people married outside the town.\n\nIn other words, have as many married men and women married to people outside the town as possible.\n\nSo, if we have X married men married to women in the town, then the number of married women in the town is X, since each marriage connects one man and one woman.\n\nThe remaining married men (0.7M - X) are married outside the town, and the remaining married women (0.9W - X) are married outside the town.\n\nTherefore, the total married population in the town is X men + X women + (0.7M - X) men + (0.9W - X) women = 0.7M + 0.9W - X.\n\nOur goal is to minimize this total married population.\n\nTo minimize 0.7M + 0.9W - X, we need to maximize X.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible value of X?\n\nWell, X can be as high as the smaller of 0.7M and 0.9W.\n\nGiven that M = (9/7)W, as we found earlier, 0.7M = 0.9W, so X can be up to 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nTherefore, the minimum total married population is 0.7M + 0.9W - X.\n\nIf X is maximized to 0.7M, then the minimum total married population is 0.7M + 0.9W - 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nSimilarly, since M = (9/7)W, 0.9W = 0.7M.\n\nSo, the minimum total married population is 0.9W.\n\nNow, the total population is M + W = (9/7)W + W = (16/7)W.\n\nTherefore, the minimum percentage married is (0.9W) / (16/7)W * 100% = (0.9 * 7 / 16) * 100% = (6.3 / 16) * 100% = 0.39375 * 100% = 39.375%.\n\nWait a minute, that seems much lower than our previous calculation of 78.75%.\n\nBut is this possible?\n\nLet me check.\n\nIf X = 0.7M = 0.9W, then total married population is 0.7M + 0.9W - X = 0.7M + 0.9W - 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nSo, total married population is 0.9W, and total population is (16/7)W.\n\nTherefore, percentage married is (0.9W) / (16/7)W * 100% = 39.375%.\n\nBut wait, this seems counterintuitive.\n\nIn the first approach, we had 78.75%, and in this approach, we have 39.375%.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nLet me see where I went wrong.\n\nIn the first approach, we assumed that all married men are married to women in the town, and all married women are married to men in the town, so the number of marriages is X = 0.7M = 0.9W, and total married people is 2X.\n\nIn the second approach, we considered that some married men and women are married outside the town, and we tried to minimize the total married population by maximizing X.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that the total married population is 0.7M + 0.9W - X.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not correct.\n\nLet's think differently.\n\nTotal married men: 0.7M\n\nTotal married women: 0.9W\n\nNumber of marriages within the town: X = min(0.7M, 0.9W)\n\nBut actually, X can be up to the smaller of 0.7M and 0.9W, but not necessarily equal to both.\n\nWait, but in reality, X has to satisfy X \u2264 0.7M and X \u2264 0.9W.\n\nGiven that M = (9/7)W, so 0.7M = 0.9W, meaning X can be up to 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nTherefore, X = 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nThus, total married people in the town is X men + X women = 2X = 1.4M = 1.8W.\n\nTotal population is M + W = (16/7)W.\n\nTherefore, percentage married is (1.8W) / (16/7)W * 100% = 78.75%.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that by maximizing X, we can minimize the total married population to 0.9W, but that doesn't make sense because if X = 0.7M = 0.9W, then the total married people are X men + X women = 1.8W, not 0.9W.\n\nI must have made a mistake there.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nIf X = 0.7M = 0.9W, then total married people are X men + X women = 1.8W.\n\nTotal population is (16/7)W.\n\nTherefore, percentage married is (1.8W) / (16/7)W * 100% = 78.75%.\n\nAlternatively, if some married men are married outside the town, then the number of married men within the town is less than 0.7M.\n\nSimilarly, if some married women are married outside, the number of married women within the town is less than 0.9W.\n\nBut the number of marriages within the town is still equal to the number of married men within the town, which is less than or equal to 0.7M, and also equal to the number of married women within the town, which is less than or equal to 0.9W.\n\nGiven that 0.7M = 0.9W, the maximum number of marriages within the town is 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nTherefore, the total married population within the town is at least X men + (0.9W - X) women, where X is the number of married men within the town.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose that all married women in the town are married to men in the town.\n\nThen, the number of married women is 0.9W, and the number of married men is also 0.9W, since each marriage connects one man and one woman.\n\nSimilarly, since 0.7M men are married, and all of them are married to women in the town, the number of married men is 0.7M, which must equal the number of married women, 0.9W.\n\nTherefore, 0.7M = 0.9W, so M = (9/7)W.\n\nTotal population is M + W = (16/7)W.\n\nTotal married people is 0.7M + 0.9W = 0.7*(9/7)W + 0.9W = (6.3/7)W + 0.9W = 0.9W + 0.9W = 1.8W.\n\nTherefore, percentage married is (1.8W) / (16/7)W * 100% = (1.8 * 7 / 16) * 100% = (12.6 / 16) * 100% = 78.75%.\n\nBut perhaps there is a way to have a smaller percentage married.\n\nSuppose that some married women are married to men outside the town.\n\nIn this case, the number of married women in the town who are married to men in the town is less than 0.9W.\n\nSimilarly, some married men are married to women outside the town.\n\nTherefore, the number of marriages within the town can be less than 0.7M or 0.9W.\n\nLet\u2019s denote Y as the number of marriages within the town.\n\nThen, Y \u2264 0.7M and Y \u2264 0.9W.\n\nGiven that M = (9/7)W, and 0.7M = 0.9W, we have Y \u2264 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nNow, the total married people in the town are:\n\n- Married men within the town: Y\n\n- Married men outside the town: 0.7M - Y\n\n- Married women within the town: Y\n\n- Married women outside the town: 0.9W - Y\n\nTherefore, total married people is Y + (0.7M - Y) + Y + (0.9W - Y) = 0.7M + 0.9W - Y.\n\nTo minimize the total married people, we need to maximize Y.\n\nThe maximum Y can be is 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nTherefore, the minimum total married people is 0.7M + 0.9W - 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nAlternatively, 0.7M + 0.9W - 0.9W = 0.7M.\n\nBut since 0.7M = 0.9W, both are equal.\n\nTherefore, minimum total married people is 0.9W.\n\nTotal population is M + W = (16/7)W.\n\nTherefore, minimum percentage married is (0.9W) / (16/7)W * 100% = (0.9 * 7 / 16) * 100% = (6.3 / 16) * 100% = 39.375%.\n\nBut earlier, we had 78.75% as the percentage when all marriages are within the town.\n\nSo, the minimum percentage is 39.375%, which occurs when maximum possible marriages are to people outside the town.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense intuitively.\n\nIf more people are married outside the town, then fewer people are married within the town, which would suggest a lower total married population in the town.\n\nBut in reality, the married people in the town are those who are married within the town plus those who are married outside the town.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to rethink this.\n\nIf a man is married outside the town, he is still considered married, but his spouse is not in the town.\n\nSimilarly, if a woman is married outside the town, she is married, but her spouse is not in the town.\n\nTherefore, the total married population in the town includes:\n\n- Men married within the town: Y\n\n- Men married outside the town: 0.7M - Y\n\n- Women married within the town: Y\n\n- Women married outside the town: 0.9W - Y\n\nTherefore, total married population is Y + (0.7M - Y) + Y + (0.9W - Y) = 0.7M + 0.9W - Y.\n\nTo minimize the total married population, we need to maximize Y.\n\nThe maximum Y can be is 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nTherefore, minimum total married population is 0.7M + 0.9W - 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nAlternatively, 0.7M + 0.9W - 0.9W = 0.7M.\n\nBut since 0.7M = 0.9W, both are equal.\n\nTherefore, minimum total married population is 0.9W = 0.7M.\n\nNow, total population is M + W.\n\nGiven M = (9/7)W, total population is (16/7)W.\n\nTherefore, minimum percentage married is (0.9W) / (16/7)W * 100% = 39.375%.\n\nBut this seems counterintuitive because it's less than half the population, yet 70% of men and 90% of women are married.\n\nThe resolution is that in this scenario, a significant portion of the married men and women are married outside the town, which reduces the number of married people within the town.\n\nTherefore, the minimum percentage of the population that is married is 39.375%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{39.375\\%} \\]"
