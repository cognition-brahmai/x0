        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company with two types of employees: full-time and part-time. Full-time employees work 40 hours per week, and part-time employees work 20 hours per week. The company has a total of 120 employees, and together, they work 3,800 hours per week. We need to find out how many full-time and part-time employees there are.\n\nFirst, I think I should define variables for the number of full-time and part-time employees. Let's say:\n\n- Let F be the number of full-time employees.\n\n- Let P be the number of part-time employees.\n\nWe know that the total number of employees is 120, so:\n\nF + P = 120\n\nThat's one equation.\n\nNext, we know that full-time employees work 40 hours per week, and part-time employees work 20 hours per week. The total hours worked by all employees per week is 3,800 hours. So, we can write another equation for the total hours:\n\n40F + 20P = 3,800\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1) F + P = 120\n\n2) 40F + 20P = 3,800\n\nI need to solve for F and P.\n\nOne way to solve this is by using the substitution method. I can solve the first equation for one variable and substitute it into the second equation.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for P:\n\nP = 120 - F\n\nNow, substitute this expression for P into the second equation:\n\n40F + 20(120 - F) = 3,800\n\nNow, let's simplify and solve for F:\n\n40F + 2,400 - 20F = 3,800\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(40F - 20F) + 2,400 = 3,800\n\n20F + 2,400 = 3,800\n\nNow, subtract 2,400 from both sides:\n\n20F = 1,400\n\nThen, divide both sides by 20:\n\nF = 70\n\nSo, there are 70 full-time employees.\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation P = 120 - F:\n\nP = 120 - 70 = 50\n\nTherefore, there are 50 part-time employees.\n\nLet me double-check these numbers to make sure they make sense.\n\nIf there are 70 full-time employees working 40 hours each:\n\n70 * 40 = 2,800 hours\n\nAnd 50 part-time employees working 20 hours each:\n\n50 * 20 = 1,000 hours\n\nTotal hours: 2,800 + 1,000 = 3,800 hours, which matches the given total.\n\nAlso, the total number of employees is 70 + 50 = 120, which matches the given total.\n\nLooks good!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70 \\text{ full-time employees and } 50 \\text{ part-time employees}} \\]"
