        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about a train's journey. The train travels at an average speed of 90 km/h for the first half of its journey and then at 120 km/h for the second half. The total distance is 360 km, and I need to find out how long the entire trip takes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I need to find the total time taken for the journey. I know that time is equal to distance divided by speed. But here, the speed changes for the two halves of the journey, so I need to calculate the time for each half separately and then add them together.\n\nThe total distance is 360 km, so each half of the journey is 180 km (since 360 km divided by 2 is 180 km).\n\nNow, for the first half:\n\n- Distance: 180 km\n\n- Speed: 90 km/h\n\n- Time: distance/speed = 180 km / 90 km/h = 2 hours\n\nFor the second half:\n\n- Distance: 180 km\n\n- Speed: 120 km/h\n\n- Time: distance/speed = 180 km / 120 km/h = 1.5 hours\n\nNow, to find the total time, I just add the times for both halves:\n\nTotal time = time for first half + time for second half = 2 hours + 1.5 hours = 3.5 hours\n\nSo, the entire trip takes 3.5 hours.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Sometimes, with average speeds, it's tricky because it's not always straightforward to just take the average of the two speeds. But in this case, since the distances are equal, I think adding the times separately is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the average speed for the entire journey. The formula for average speed is total distance divided by total time. But in this problem, I'm asked for the total time, not the average speed, so my initial approach should be fine.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the formula:\n\nTotal time = (distance1 / speed1) + (distance2 / speed2)\n\nSince both distances are equal (each 180 km), it's just (180 / 90) + (180 / 120) = 2 + 1.5 = 3.5 hours, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI could also try to calculate the harmonic mean of the speeds, but that's typically used when the distances are the same, which they are in this case. The harmonic mean for two speeds is given by:\n\nHarmonic mean = (2 * speed1 * speed2) / (speed1 + speed2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nHarmonic mean = (2 * 90 * 120) / (90 + 120) = (21600) / (210) = 102.857 km/h (approximately)\n\nThen, total time = total distance / average speed = 360 km / 102.857 km/h \u2248 3.5 hours, which again confirms my initial calculation.\n\nSo, all these methods lead me to the same answer: 3.5 hours.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe using relative speeds or something else, but I don't think that's necessary here because the problem is straightforward once you break it into two parts.\n\nAnother thing to consider is units. All distances are in kilometers and speeds are in kilometers per hour, so the time will be in hours, which is consistent throughout.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be 3.5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
