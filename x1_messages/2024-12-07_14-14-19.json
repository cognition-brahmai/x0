        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a farmer who has both chickens and cows on his farm. He counts a total of 50 heads and 134 legs. We need to figure out how many chickens and how many cows there are.\n\nFirst, I think it's important to understand what's being given to us. We know that chickens and cows each have one head, so the total number of heads should be the sum of the number of chickens and the number of cows. Similarly, chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs, so the total number of legs should be twice the number of chickens plus four times the number of cows.\n\nLet me try to translate that into mathematical equations. Let's say:\n\n- Let C represent the number of chickens.\n\n- Let K represent the number of cows.\n\nFrom the information given:\n\n1. The total number of heads is 50, so:\n\nC + K = 50\n\n2. The total number of legs is 134, so:\n\n2C + 4K = 134\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations with two variables. I need to solve for C and K.\n\nI recall that there are several methods to solve systems of equations, such as substitution, elimination, or even matrices. Maybe I'll try the substitution method first.\n\nFrom the first equation, C + K = 50, I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for C:\n\nC = 50 - K\n\nNow, I can substitute this expression for C into the second equation:\n\n2(50 - K) + 4K = 134\n\nLet me simplify that:\n\n100 - 2K + 4K = 134\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n100 + 2K = 134\n\nNow, subtract 100 from both sides:\n\n2K = 34\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nK = 17\n\nSo, there are 17 cows. Now, plug this back into the expression for C:\n\nC = 50 - 17 = 33\n\nTherefore, there are 33 chickens and 17 cows.\n\nBut, I should check if this makes sense. Let's verify the total number of heads and legs.\n\n- Heads: 33 chickens + 17 cows = 50 heads. That checks out.\n\n- Legs: 33 chickens * 2 legs each = 66 legs\n\n- 17 cows * 4 legs each = 68 legs\n\n- Total legs: 66 + 68 = 134 legs. Perfect, that matches the given information.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using elimination instead of substitution.\n\nLet's see. Starting with the same two equations:\n\nC + K = 50\n\n2C + 4K = 134\n\nI can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of C the same in both equations:\n\n2C + 2K = 100\n\nNow, subtract this from the second equation:\n\n(2C + 4K) - (2C + 2K) = 134 - 100\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2K = 34\n\nSo, K = 17, just like before. Then C = 50 - 17 = 33.\n\nAlright, so both methods give me the same answer. That's reassuring.\n\nIs there a way to solve this without using algebra? Maybe using logic or trial and error?\n\nSuppose I consider that all 50 animals are chickens. Then, I would have 50 * 2 = 100 legs. But actually, there are 134 legs, which is 34 legs more than if all were chickens.\n\nSince each cow has 2 more legs than a chicken, the number of cows must be 34 / 2 = 17 cows.\n\nThen, the number of chickens is 50 - 17 = 33 chickens.\n\nAgain, I get the same answer. This is a quicker way to think about it without setting up equations.\n\nThis confirms that the answer is 33 chickens and 17 cows.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. There doesn't seem to be any other way to interpret the problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33 \\text{ chickens and } 17 \\text{ cows}} \\]"
