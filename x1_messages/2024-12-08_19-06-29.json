So, here's how you can divide the 5 apples among 5 kids in such a way that each kid gets an apple and still, one apple remains in the basket.\n\nFirst, you give one apple to each of the four kids. So, that's four apples given out, and one apple is left in the basket.\n\nNow, for the fifth kid, instead of giving them an apple from the basket, you give them the basket itself, with the remaining apple still inside it.\n\nSo, each kid has an apple: the first four have individual apples, and the fifth has the basket with the last apple still in it.\n\nThis way, all five kids have an apple, and one apple remains in the basket because the fifth kid has the basket with that apple.\n\nIt's a clever trick because the basket is considered as part of the distribution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Give each of the first four kids one apple each, and give the fifth kid the basket containing the fifth apple.}} \\]"
