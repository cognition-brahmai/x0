        "content": "Let's see here. There's this problem about renting bicycles. So, the rental shop charges $20 per bicycle and there's also a $50 group fee. The total cost for the group is $290, and we need to find out how many bicycles they rented.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. We have to find the number of bicycles based on the total cost. There are two parts to the cost: the per bicycle charge and a fixed group fee.\n\nLet me try to break it down. The total cost is made up of the cost per bicycle times the number of bicycles plus the group fee. So, if I let the number of bicycles be, say, x, then the total cost would be 20x + 50.\n\nWait, is that right? Yeah, because for each bicycle, it's $20, and no matter how many bicycles, there's a fixed fee of $50.\n\nSo, the equation should be:\n\nTotal cost = (cost per bicycle) * (number of bicycles) + group fee\n\nWhich is:\n\n290 = 20x + 50\n\nAlright, now I need to solve for x, which is the number of bicycles.\n\nFirst, I should probably isolate the term with x. So, I can subtract 50 from both sides of the equation to get:\n\n290 - 50 = 20x + 50 - 50\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n240 = 20x\n\nNow, to find x, I can divide both sides by 20:\n\n240 / 20 = 20x / 20\n\nThat gives:\n\n12 = x\n\nSo, the group rented 12 bicycles.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If they rented 12 bicycles at $20 each, that would be 12 * 20 = $240. Plus the $50 group fee, that would be $240 + $50 = $290, which matches the total cost given.\n\nLooks good to me.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
