It's a common misconception that all bees die after stinging, but it's only true for honey bees.\n\nHoney bees have barbed stingers that get lodged in the skin of their target. When they try to fly away after stinging, the stinger tears out part of their abdomen, causing fatal injuries. So, honey bees do die after they sting.\n\nHowever, other types of bees, like bumblebees and carpenter bees, have smooth stingers that don't get stuck in the skin. They can sting multiple times without dying.\n\nSo, to sum it up, only honey bees die after stinging, while other bees can sting multiple times without any fatal consequences."
