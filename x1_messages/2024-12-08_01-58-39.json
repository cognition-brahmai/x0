        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a store with 10,000 items, and 3% of them are defective. That means the number of defective items is 3% of 10,000, which is:\n\n\\[\n0.03 \\times 10,000 = 300 \\text{ defective items}\n\\]\n\n Consequently, the number of non-defective items is:\n\n\\[\n10,000 - 300 = 9,700 \\text{ non-defective items}\n\\]\n\nNow, the goal is to sell some non-defective items so that the percentage of defective items drops to 2%. Let's denote the number of non-defective items sold as \\( x \\).\n\nAfter selling \\( x \\) non-defective items, the total number of items left in the store will be:\n\n\\[\n10,000 - x\n\\]\n\nAnd the number of non-defective items left will be:\n\n\\[\n9,700 - x\n\\]\n\nThe number of defective items remains the same, 300, because we're only selling non-defective items. We want the defective items to make up 2% of the total items left. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{10,000 - x} = 0.02\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n300 = 0.02 \\times (10,000 - x)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n300 = 200 - 0.02x\n\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my steps. If:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{10,000 - x} = 0.02\n\\]\n\nThen, multiplying both sides by \\( 10,000 - x \\):\n\n\\[\n300 = 0.02 \\times (10,000 - x)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n300 = 200 - 0.02x\n\\]\n\nHmm, that implies:\n\n\\[\n300 - 200 = -0.02x\n\\]\n\n\\[\n100 = -0.02x\n\\]\n\nThat gives:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{100}{-0.02} = -5,000\n\\]\n\nNegative \\( x \\)? That doesn't make sense because we can't sell a negative number of items. I must have set up the equation incorrectly.\n\nLet me try again. If we sell \\( x \\) non-defective items, the total number of items becomes \\( 10,000 - x \\), and the number of defective items remains 300. We want the defective items to be 2% of the total items left:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{10,000 - x} = 0.02\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n300 = 0.02 \\times (10,000 - x)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n300 = 200 - 0.02x\n\\]\n\nSubtract 200 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n100 = -0.02x\n\\]\n\nThis again gives \\( x = -5,000 \\). There must be a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe instead of selling non-defective items, I should consider that selling non-defective items increases the percentage of defective items, but we want to reduce it to 2%. Actually, selling non-defective items would increase the percentage of defective items, which is the opposite of what we want. So, maybe I need to sell defective items to reduce the percentage of defective items.\n\nBut the problem says to sell non-defective items. Maybe I need to reconsider the initial setup.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let\u2019s denote the number of non-defective items sold as \\( x \\). Then, the total number of items left is \\( 10,000 - x \\), with 300 defective items and \\( 9,700 - x \\) non-defective items.\n\nWe want the defective items to be 2% of the total items left:\n\n\\[\n300 = 0.02 \\times (10,000 - x)\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n300 = 200 - 0.02x\n\\]\n\n\\[\n300 - 200 = -0.02x\n\\]\n\n\\[\n100 = -0.02x\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = -5,000\n\\]\n\nThis negative value doesn't make sense in this context. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup.\n\nLet me consider that selling non-defective items increases the percentage of defective items, so to reduce the percentage of defective items, perhaps we need to add more non-defective items, not sell them. But the problem specifically says to sell non-defective items.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the store needs to remove defective items to reduce the percentage, but again, the problem says to sell non-defective items.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the problem. Maybe the store has 10,000 items, 3% defective, and we need to sell some non-defective items such that the remaining stock has only 2% defective items.\n\nBut mathematically, selling non-defective items would increase the percentage of defective items, not decrease it. For example, if you sell some non-defective items, the proportion of defective items in the remaining stock goes up, not down.\n\nTherefore, to reduce the percentage of defective items, one would typically need to either remove defective items or add non-defective items, not sell non-defective items.\n\nGiven that, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or in my understanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the store starts with 10,000 items, 3% defective, and by selling some non-defective items, it reduces the total number of items, but I'm still ending up with a negative number, which doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me try setting up the equation differently.\n\nLet the number of non-defective items sold be \\( x \\).\n\nThen, total items left = \\( 10,000 - x \\)\n\nDefective items left = 300 (since only non-defective items are sold)\n\nWe want:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{10,000 - x} = 0.02\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n300 = 0.02 \\times (10,000 - x)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n300 = 200 - 0.02x\n\\]\n\n\\[\n300 - 200 = -0.02x\n\\]\n\n\\[\n100 = -0.02x\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = -5,000\n\\]\n\nThis suggests that to have 2% defective items, we need to have sold -5,000 non-defective items, which is impossible.\n\nThis implies that it's not possible to reduce the percentage of defective items from 3% to 2% by selling non-defective items. In fact, selling non-defective items would increase the percentage of defective items, not decrease it.\n\nFor example, if you sell 0 non-defective items, the percentage is 3%. If you sell 1,000 non-defective items, the total items left are 9,000, with 300 defective, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{9,000} = 0.0333 \\text{ or } 3.33\\%\n\\]\n\nWhich is higher than 3%. Similarly, selling more non-defective items would make the percentage of defective items even higher.\n\nTherefore, it's not possible to reduce the percentage of defective items to 2% by selling non-defective items. To reduce the percentage of defective items, one would need to either remove defective items or add non-defective items to the stock.\n\nGiven this conclusion, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem. Maybe the store needs to sell defective items to reduce the percentage of defective items, but the problem specifies selling non-defective items.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the problem, and it should be about increasing or decreasing the percentage in a different way.\n\nIn any case, based on the current setup, selling non-defective items cannot reduce the percentage of defective items; it can only increase it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{It is not possible to reduce the percentage of defective items to 2% by selling non-defective items.}} \\]"
