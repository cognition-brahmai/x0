        "content": "So the farmer has a rectangular field that's 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide it into two equal parts by building a fence along the diagonal. I need to find out how long that fence will be.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the field. It's a rectangle, so it has four right angles. The length is 100 meters, and the width is 60 meters. If he builds a fence along the diagonal, it would stretch from one corner to the opposite corner.\n\nTo find the length of the diagonal, I can use the Pythagorean theorem. That's because in a rectangle, the diagonal forms a right triangle with the length and the width. So, the diagonal is the hypotenuse of that right triangle.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b). Mathematically, it's:\n\nc\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\nHere, a is the length (100 meters), and b is the width (60 meters). So, I can plug these values into the formula to find c, which is the length of the diagonal fence.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nc\u00b2 = 100\u00b2 + 60\u00b2\n\nc\u00b2 = 10,000 + 3,600\n\nc\u00b2 = 13,600\n\nNow, to find c, I need to take the square root of 13,600.\n\nc = \u221a13,600\n\nI can simplify this:\n\nFirst, let's see if 13,600 can be factored into perfect squares.\n\n13,600 = 16 \u00d7 850\n\nWait, 16 is a perfect square (4\u00b2), but 850 isn't. Let's try further.\n\nAlternatively, 13,600 = 100 \u00d7 136\n\n100 is a perfect square (10\u00b2), so:\n\n\u221a13,600 = \u221a(100 \u00d7 136) = \u221a100 \u00d7 \u221a136 = 10 \u00d7 \u221a136\n\nNow, let's simplify \u221a136.\n\n136 can be factored into 4 \u00d7 34.\n\n4 is a perfect square (2\u00b2), so:\n\n\u221a136 = \u221a(4 \u00d7 34) = \u221a4 \u00d7 \u221a34 = 2 \u00d7 \u221a34\n\nTherefore, \u221a13,600 = 10 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 \u221a34 = 20\u221a34\n\nBut, perhaps it's easier to calculate the square root directly.\n\nUsing a calculator, \u221a13,600 is approximately 116.619 meters.\n\nAlternatively, if I want an exact value, I can leave it as \u221a13,600 meters, but usually, it's more practical to have a decimal approximation.\n\nSo, the length of the fence is approximately 116.62 meters.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can check this calculation again to be sure.\n\nStarting from:\n\nc\u00b2 = 100\u00b2 + 60\u00b2\n\nc\u00b2 = 10,000 + 3,600\n\nc\u00b2 = 13,600\n\nc = \u221a13,600\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I know that the diagonal of a rectangle can also be found using the formula:\n\nDiagonal = \u221a(length\u00b2 + width\u00b2)\n\nWhich is the same as the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nSo, no issues there.\n\nAlternatively, if I remember the properties of rectangles, the diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other.\n\nBut in this case, since the field is divided into two equal parts by the diagonal, it makes sense to use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem?\n\nWell, I could use trigonometry, but that would be more complicated for this straightforward problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the area of the rectangle and relate it to the diagonal, but that wouldn't directly give me the length of the diagonal.\n\nSo, the Pythagorean theorem is the most straightforward method.\n\nJust to double-check my calculation:\n\nc = \u221a(100\u00b2 + 60\u00b2) = \u221a(10,000 + 3,600) = \u221a13,600 \u2248 116.62 meters\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the length of the fence is approximately 116.62 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{116.62} \\]"
