        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a box containing red and blue balls. The probability of picking a red ball is 1/3, and there are 12 blue balls in the box. We need to find out how many red balls there are.\n\nFirst, let's understand what probability means in this context. Probability is the likelihood of an event happening. Here, the event is picking a red ball, and its probability is 1/3. That means, for every 3 balls you pick, you'd expect to get 1 red ball.\n\nNow, let's denote the number of red balls as R and the total number of balls as T. The probability of picking a red ball is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. So, we can write this as:\n\nProbability of red ball = R / T = 1/3\n\nWe also know that the total number of balls is the sum of red and blue balls:\n\nT = R + 12\n\nBecause there are 12 blue balls.\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of T from the second equation into the first equation:\n\nR / (R + 12) = 1/3\n\nNow, we need to solve for R. To do this, we can cross-multiply:\n\n3R = R + 12\n\nNow, subtract R from both sides:\n\n3R - R = 12\n\n2R = 12\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\nR = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 red balls in the box.\n\nLet's double-check this. If there are 6 red balls and 12 blue balls, the total number of balls is 6 + 12 = 18. The probability of picking a red ball is 6/18, which simplifies to 1/3. That matches the given probability, so our answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
