Excuse me, but I was eyeing this morsel before you even landed here!\n\n**B1:** Eyeing? Pfft! That's not good enough. In the bird world, seeing is believing, and I saw it first!\n\n**B2:** Oh, really? Well, in the pecking order, being here first counts more than just seeing something. I was perched here minutes ago, planning my meal.\n\n**B1:** Planning? Hah! Plans don't make meals; actions do. And my action is to claim this worm with my sharp beak!\n\n**B2:** Sharp beak, huh? Well, my talons are pretty sharp too. Maybe I'll peck you instead if you don't back off.\n\n**B1:** Oh, is that a threat? Because in bird language, that sounds more like a tweet of intimidation.\n\n**B2:** Intimidation? Me? I'm just expressing my feathers of frustration. This worm is mine; I claimed it first.\n\n**B1:** Claimed it? By standing there doing nothing? That's like claiming a prize without entering the contest.\n\n**B2:** I was waiting for the perfect moment to dive in. Patience is a virtue, you know.\n\n**B1:** Patience or laziness? I think the worm is getting impatient itself, waiting to be eaten.\n\n**B2:** Oh, very funny. Maybe the worm is waiting for the bird with the best strategy, not just the first one to see it.\n\n**B1:** Strategy? This is simple: see the worm, eat the worm. No fancy plans needed.\n\n**B2:** Simple, maybe, but not always effective. Sometimes, you need to wait for the worm to come to you.\n\n**B1:** Wait? While it might wriggle away? No thanks, I prefer proactive hunting.\n\n**B2:** Proactive, my foot! You're just impatient and hungry.\n\n**B1:** Hungry and smart. Now, if you don't mind, I have better things to do than argue with you.\n\n**B2:** Like what? Pecking at this worm while I'm still here?\n\n**B1:** Exactly! Because in the end, it's not about who saw it first, but who eats it last.\n\n**B2:** Ha! You mean who eats it first. Because in bird time, last and first are the same thing.\n\n**B1:** Bird time? What's that?\n\n**B2:** It's our special time where everything is a blur, and meals are devoured in the blink of an eye.\n\n**B1:** Well, in that case, I'll just have to blink faster than you.\n\n**B2:** Blink and you'll miss dinner, buddy.\n\n**B1:** Trust me, I won't miss this dinner. Now, move aside or prepare to share.\n\n**B2:** Share? With you? Not a chance. This worm is solo for me.\n\n**B1:** Solo? Like a solo flight? Well, I hope you enjoy your solo meal, because I'm about to enjoy mine.\n\n**B2:** You can try, but I'm not giving up without a peck.\n\n**B1:** A peck? You're on. Let's see who has the better aim.\n\n**B2:** Bring it on, featherbrain.\n\n**B1:** Oh, that's it! You're asking for it!\n\n**B2:** I'm quaking in my feathers.\n\n**B1:** Just you wait; I'll show you who's boss around here.\n\n**B2:** Boss? HA! I'm the one who gets the worm.\n\n**B1:** Only if you can catch it from me.\n\n**B2:** Catch it? I'll pluck it right from your beak.\n\n**B1:** Good luck with that. Now, if you don't mind, I have a worm to enjoy.\n\n**B2:** Enjoy it, indeed. Over my squawk!\n\n**B1:** Squawk? Is that your final word?\n\n**B2:** It is. Now, step away from the worm.\n\n**B1:** Or what? You'll peck me?\n\n**B2:** I will. And I'm not afraid to feather your tail.\n\n**B1:** Oh, very threatening. I'm so scared.\n\n**B2:** You should be. Now, move.\n\n**B1:** Fine, fine. I'll let you have this one. But next time, don't expect me to be so generous.\n\n**B2:** Generous? You're just a poor loser.\n\n**B1:** Poor loser? Me? I'm just being sporting. Enjoy your worm, but remember, in bird world, it's every feather for itself.\n\n**B2:** And that's why I always come out on top.\n\n**B1:** We'll see about that. Chirp! (flies away)\n\n**B2:** Chirp-chirp! (starts eating the worm, satisfied)"
