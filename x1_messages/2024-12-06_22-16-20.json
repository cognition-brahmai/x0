        "content": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. The expression is (9 / 3 * 5) - 2^3 + 6. Okay, first things first, I need to remember the order of operations. I think it's PEMDAS or something like that. Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, and Addition and Subtraction from left to right. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses: (9 / 3 * 5). Inside here, I have division and multiplication. According to PEMDAS, I should do these from left to right. So, first, 9 divided by 3 is 3. Then, 3 multiplied by 5 is 15. So, the expression inside the parentheses simplifies to 15.\n\nNow, the expression is 15 - 2^3 + 6. Next, exponents. 2 raised to the power of 3 is 8. So, it becomes 15 - 8 + 6.\n\nNext, I have subtraction and addition. Again, according to PEMDAS, I should do these from left to right. So, 15 minus 8 is 7, and then 7 plus 6 is 13.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check if I did everything correctly. Let me go through it again.\n\nStarting with (9 / 3 * 5). Division first: 9 divided by 3 is 3. Then, 3 multiplied by 5 is 15. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNext, 15 - 2^3 + 6. Exponents: 2^3 is 8. So, 15 - 8 + 6.\n\nNow, subtraction and addition from left to right: 15 minus 8 is 7, and 7 plus 6 is 13.\n\nHmm, is there any chance that I should have handled the operations differently? Maybe if there are multiple operations at the same level, but I think I followed the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might interpret exponentiation differently, but in standard mathematics, exponents are handled before multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction.\n\nAnother thing to consider is if the expression was meant to be (9 / (3 * 5)) - 2^3 + 6, but the parentheses are placed differently. In the original expression, it's (9 / 3 * 5), which should be performed from left to right.\n\nWait, but actually, in some programming languages, the order of operations might be different, but since this is a mathematical expression, I think PEMDAS applies here.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to interpret this expression. Maybe if there are implied parentheses or something, but as it's written, I think my approach is correct.\n\nSo, finally, the answer should be 13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
