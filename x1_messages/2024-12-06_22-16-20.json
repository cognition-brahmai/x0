        "content": "So there's this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with 6 red balls and 4 blue balls, making a total of 10 balls. We're supposed to pick two balls at once without replacement, and we need to find the probability that both balls are red.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"picking two balls at once without replacement\" means. I think it means that we're selecting two balls simultaneously, without looking, and without putting any ball back if we pick it. So, it's different from picking one ball, noting its color, and then picking another.\n\nBut in probability, whether we pick the balls one after the other without replacement or pick them at once, the probability should be the same because the order doesn't matter here. So, I can think of it as picking one ball first and then another without replacing the first one.\n\nAlright, so the total number of ways to pick two balls out of 10 is combinations, not permutations, because the order doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 10 is C(10, 2). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * 8!) = (10 * 9 * 8!) / (2 * 1 * 8!)) = (10 * 9) / 2 = 45.\n\nSo, there are 45 possible pairs of balls.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to pick 2 red balls out of the 6 red balls. Again, this is a combination problem: C(6, 2).\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * 4!) = (6 * 5 * 4!) / (2 * 1 * 4!)) = (6 * 5) / 2 = 15.\n\nSo, there are 15 ways to choose 2 red balls.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are red is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 15 / 45 = 1/3.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe using probabilities step by step.\n\nYes, for example, calculating the probability of picking a red ball first and then another red ball without replacement.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball first is 6/10, since there are 6 red balls out of 10.\n\nAfter picking one red ball, there are now 5 red balls left and a total of 9 balls left in the box.\n\nSo, the probability of picking another red ball is 5/9.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both events happening is (6/10) * (5/9) = (3/5) * (5/9) = (3 * 5) / (5 * 9) = 15 / 45 = 1/3.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result: 1/3.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to look at this problem.\n\nSuppose we think about it in terms of permutations. If we consider the order of picking the balls, then the total number of ways to pick two balls in order would be P(10, 2) = 10 * 9 = 90.\n\nThe number of ways to pick two red balls in order would be P(6, 2) = 6 * 5 = 30.\n\nSo, the probability would be 30 / 90 = 1/3 again.\n\nSo, no matter which approach I take, I end up with the same probability: 1/3.\n\nI think that makes sense. The probability of picking two red balls at once without replacement from a box of 6 red and 4 blue balls is 1/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]\n"
