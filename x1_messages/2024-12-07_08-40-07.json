        "content": "So the factory makes 120 cars each day. I need to find out how many cars it makes in a whole week. Okay, first things first, I know that a week has 7 days. So, if the factory makes 120 cars every day, and it works every day of the week, I can just multiply the number of cars made per day by the number of days in a week to get the total production for the week.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nCars per day = 120\n\nDays per week = 7\n\nTotal cars per week = Cars per day \u00d7 Days per week\n\nSo, total cars per week = 120 \u00d7 7\n\nNow, I just need to do the multiplication. 120 times 7.\n\nWell, 100 times 7 is 700, and 20 times 7 is 140. So, 700 plus 140 equals 840.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 840 cars in a week.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Let's see.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the weekly production step by step. If the factory makes 120 cars each day, then:\n\nDay 1: 120 cars\n\nDay 2: 120 cars\n\nDay 3: 120 cars\n\nDay 4: 120 cars\n\nDay 5: 120 cars\n\nDay 6: 120 cars\n\nDay 7: 120 cars\n\nNow, if I add them up: 120 + 120 = 240 for the first two days.\n\n240 + 120 = 360 for the first three days.\n\n360 + 120 = 480 for the first four days.\n\n480 + 120 = 600 for the first five days.\n\n600 + 120 = 720 for the first six days.\n\n720 + 120 = 840 for the entire week.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 840 cars per week.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can use another method. Let's think about it in terms of tens.\n\n120 is the same as 12 tens. So, 12 tens per day.\n\nOver 7 days, that's 12 tens times 7, which is 84 tens.\n\n84 tens is 840.\n\nAgain, 840 cars per week.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider if there are any holidays or days the factory might not be operating, but the question says \"every day,\" so I can assume it's running seven days a week.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that there are no other factors to consider, like partial days or varying production rates, but the question states a constant production rate of 120 cars per day.\n\nSo, my final answer is 840 cars per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{840} \\]"
