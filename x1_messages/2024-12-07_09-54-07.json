        "content": "Let's see what's going on here. Alice, Bob, and Carol initially decide to split a $120 gift equally among themselves. So, each of them was going to pay $40, right? Because 120 divided by 3 is 40.\n\nNow, Dave decides to join them, so there are four people in total. They want to split the cost equally among all four, but Alice insists on paying her original share of $40. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nFirst, let's figure out what the equal share would be for four people. $120 divided by 4 is $30 per person. So, if they were splitting it equally among four, each would pay $30.\n\nBut Alice insists on paying her original share of $40. So, she's paying $40 instead of $30. That means she's paying $10 more than the new equal share.\n\nNow, the total amount to be paid is still $120. Alice is paying $40, so the remaining amount to be paid by Bob, Carol, and Dave is $120 - $40 = $80.\n\nThis $80 needs to be split equally among Bob, Carol, and Dave, since Alice has already paid her $40.\n\nSo, $80 divided by 3 is approximately $26.67 per person.\n\nTherefore, Bob pays $26.67, Carol pays $26.67, Dave pays $26.67, and Alice pays $40.\n\nLet me just double-check that the total adds up to $120.\n\n$26.67 + $26.67 + $26.67 + $40 = $120.\n\nWait, let's do the math:\n\n26.67 * 3 = 79.99 + $40 = $119.99, which is almost $120. The slight discrepancy is due to rounding.\n\nTo make it exact, we can say that each of Bob, Carol, and Dave pays $26.67, and Alice pays $40, totaling $120.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid the rounding issue, we can express $26.67 as $80 divided by 3, which is exactly $26 and two-thirds cents, or $26.666...\n\nSo, to be precise, Bob pays $26.67, Carol pays $26.67, Dave pays $26.67, and Alice pays $40, totaling exactly $120.\n\nI think that's the fairest way to split it, considering Alice's insistence on paying her original share of $40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\$26.67 \\text{ each for Bob, Carol, and Dave, and } \\$40 \\text{ for Alice}} \\]"
