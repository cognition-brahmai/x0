        "content": "Let's see. So, in this town, there are 100 houses, and each house has at least one cat or one dog. There are 60 houses with dogs and 40 with cats. I need to find out how many houses have both a cat and a dog.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a problem involving sets, maybe overlapping sets. I remember there's a principle called the inclusion-exclusion principle that might be useful here.\n\nSo, the inclusion-exclusion principle says that for two sets, the size of their union is the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of their intersection. In formula terms, it's:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nIn this context:\n\n- Set A is the set of houses with dogs.\n\n- Set B is the set of houses with cats.\n\n- |A \u222a B| is the total number of houses with at least one cat or one dog.\n\n- |A \u2229 B| is the number of houses with both a cat and a dog.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n\n- |A \u222a B| = 100 (since every house has at least one cat or one dog)\n\n- |A| = 60 (houses with dogs)\n\n- |B| = 40 (houses with cats)\n\nWe need to find |A \u2229 B|.\n\nSo, plugging the values into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\n100 = 60 + 40 - |A \u2229 B|\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n100 = 100 - |A \u2229 B|\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If I subtract |A \u2229 B| from 100, I should still have 100. That would imply that |A \u2229 B| is zero, but that can't be right because there are houses with both cats and dogs.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check the inclusion-exclusion formula. Yes, it is correct: |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|.\n\nGiven that, and plugging in the numbers:\n\n100 = 60 + 40 - |A \u2229 B|\n\nSo, 100 = 100 - |A \u2229 B|\n\nSubtract 100 from both sides:\n\n0 = - |A \u2229 B|\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n0 = |A \u2229 B|\n\nBut that would mean there are no houses with both a cat and a dog, which contradicts the initial statement that every house has at least one cat or one dog. Wait, no, it doesn't necessarily contradict it, because even if some houses have both, the math seems to suggest that the overlap is zero.\n\nBut intuitively, if there are 60 houses with dogs and 40 with cats, and there are 100 houses in total, it seems like there might be some houses counted in both categories.\n\nLet me try thinking differently. If there are 60 houses with dogs and 40 with cats, and only 100 houses total, then the total number of houses with pets is 60 + 40 = 100, but that would only be possible if there is no overlap, meaning no houses have both a cat and a dog.\n\nBut the problem states that every house has at least one cat or one dog, which aligns with our total of 100 houses having pets.\n\nSo, in this case, it seems that there are no houses with both a cat and a dog.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let's consider that some houses might have both, which would mean that the total number of houses with pets would be less than the sum of houses with dogs and houses with cats.\n\nBut in this scenario, 60 + 40 equals exactly 100, which matches the total number of houses. Therefore, there is no overlap; otherwise, the total would exceed 100, which isn't the case.\n\nSo, the number of houses with both a cat and a dog is zero.\n\nBut let's double-check this with another approach. Suppose there are x houses with both a cat and a dog.\n\nThen, the number of houses with only dogs would be 60 - x, and the number of houses with only cats would be 40 - x.\n\nThe total number of houses is the sum of houses with only dogs, only cats, and both:\n\n(60 - x) + (40 - x) + x = 100\n\nSimplify:\n\n100 - x = 100\n\nSubtract 100 from both sides:\n\n- x = 0\n\nTherefore, x = 0.\n\nSo, there are 0 houses with both a cat and a dog.\n\nThis confirms the earlier conclusion using the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that there are 0 houses with both a cat and a dog.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
