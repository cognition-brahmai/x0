        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: In a group of people, half of them are wearing glasses, one-third are wearing hats, and one-sixth are wearing both glasses and hats. I need to find out what fraction of the group is wearing either glasses or hats.\n\nOkay, so first, I know that the total group is like 100%, and I have different parts of this group based on what they're wearing. Half are wearing glasses, which is the same as 1/2 of the group. One-third are wearing hats, which is 1/3 of the group. And one-sixth are wearing both, which is 1/6 of the group.\n\nNow, I need to find those who are wearing either glasses or hats. That probably means people who are wearing glasses, plus those wearing hats, but I have to be careful not to double-count those who are wearing both.\n\nSo, if I add the fractions for glasses and hats, that would be 1/2 + 1/3. But that would include those wearing both twice, once in each category. So, I need to subtract the fraction that's wearing both to correct for that.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nFraction wearing glasses or hats = (Fraction wearing glasses) + (Fraction wearing hats) - (Fraction wearing both)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n= 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/6\n\nNow, to add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2, 3, and 6 is 6.\n\nSo, converting each fraction:\n\n1/2 = 3/6\n\n1/3 = 2/6\n\n1/6 = 1/6\n\nNow, adding and subtracting:\n\n= 3/6 + 2/6 - 1/6\n\n= (3 + 2 - 1)/6\n\n= 4/6\n\nAnd 4/6 can be simplified to 2/3.\n\nSo, the fraction of the group wearing either glasses or hats is 2/3.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That's the same formula I used earlier: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).\n\nHere, A is wearing glasses, and B is wearing hats.\n\nSo, P(A) = 1/2, P(B) = 1/3, P(A and B) = 1/6.\n\nSo, P(A or B) = 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/6 = 2/3.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of actual numbers. Let's assume there are 6 people in the group, since 6 is a common multiple of 2, 3, and 6.\n\nSo, if there are 6 people:\n\n- Half are wearing glasses: 1/2 * 6 = 3 people\n\n- One-third are wearing hats: 1/3 * 6 = 2 people\n\n- One-sixth are wearing both: 1/6 * 6 = 1 person\n\nNow, how many are wearing either glasses or hats?\n\nWell, the 3 wearing glasses include the 1 wearing both, and the 2 wearing hats include the 1 wearing both. So, total unique people wearing either are:\n\n3 (glasses) + 2 (hats) - 1 (both) = 4 people\n\nSo, out of 6 people, 4 are wearing either glasses or hats, which is 4/6 = 2/3.\n\nThis matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to consider the Venn diagram. Let's say there's a circle for glasses and a circle for hats. The overlap is those wearing both.\n\nSo, the total wearing either is the sum of those only wearing glasses, only wearing hats, and those wearing both.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n- Only glasses: 3 - 1 = 2 people\n\n- Only hats: 2 - 1 = 1 person\n\n- Both: 1 person\n\nTotal: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 people, which is again 4/6 = 2/3.\n\nSo, all these methods lead to the same answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}} \\]"
