The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n\nFirst, let's understand what recursion is. Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In programming, this means a function calls itself with a simpler version of the original problem.\n\nFor the Fibonacci sequence, the recursive definition is:\n\n- fib(0) = 0\n\n- fib(1) = 1\n\n- fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) for n > 1\n\nSo, to generate the first n Fibonacci numbers using recursion, we'll need to define a recursive function that computes the Fibonacci number for a given position n, and then call this function for each position from 0 to n-1.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the recursive approach for Fibonacci numbers can be inefficient for large n because it involves a lot of redundant calculations. Each call to fib(n) results in two more calls, leading to an exponential time complexity. But since the task specifies using recursion, we'll proceed with that.\n\nLet's sketch out the steps:\n\n1. Define a recursive function fib(n) that returns the Fibonacci number at position n.\n\n2. In the main part of the script, read an integer n from the user.\n\n3. Call fib(i) for each i from 0 to n-1 and print the results.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement the recursive function. We need to handle the base cases where n is 0 or 1, and for larger n, we'll call fib(n-1) and fib(n-2) and add their results.\n\nHere's a possible implementation:\n\n```python\ndef fib(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input(\"Enter the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate: \"))\n    fibonacci_numbers = [fib(i) for i in range(n)]\n    print(fibonacci_numbers)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis script defines the fib function recursively as described. The main function reads an integer n from the user, generates a list of the first n Fibonacci numbers using a list comprehension, and prints the list.\n\nLet's test this with a small value of n, say 5:\n\n- fib(0) = 0\n\n- fib(1) = 1\n\n- fib(2) = fib(1) + fib(0) = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n- fib(3) = fib(2) + fib(1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- fib(4) = fib(3) + fib(2) = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nSo, the first 5 Fibonacci numbers are [0, 1, 1, 2, 3], which matches our expectation.\n\nHowever, for larger values of n, this approach can be very slow due to the exponential growth of function calls. Each fib(n) call branches into two more calls, leading to many redundant calculations. For example, fib(5) calls fib(4) and fib(3), fib(4) calls fib(3) and fib(2), and so on, with fib(3) being calculated twice.\n\nTo make this more efficient, we could use techniques like memoization, where we store the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again. But since the task specifies using recursion without mentioning optimizations, we'll stick with the basic recursive approach.\n\nIt's also worth noting that there are non-recursive ways to compute the Fibonacci sequence, such as using a loop to iterate and build the sequence iteratively. This approach is more efficient in terms of both time and space, but since the task specifically asks for recursion, we'll keep it recursive.\n\nIn summary, the script above should fulfill the requirement of generating the first n Fibonacci numbers using recursion in Python.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Python script that accepts an integer `n` and generates the first `n` Fibonacci numbers using recursion, follow the steps below.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define the Recursive Function:** Create a function `fib(n)` that returns the Fibonacci number at position `n`. This function will use recursion based on the Fibonacci sequence definition:\n   - `fib(0) = 0`\n   - `fib(1) = 1`\n   - `fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)` for `n > 1`\n   \n2. **Main Function:** \n   - Read an integer `n` from the user.\n   - Generate a list of the first `n` Fibonacci numbers using a list comprehension that calls the `fib` function for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.\n   - Print the list of Fibonacci numbers.\n\n3. **Efficiency Note:** While recursion provides a clear and straightforward implementation, it is inefficient for large `n` due to exponential time complexity from redundant calculations. For production code, consider iterative approaches or memoization to improve performance.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef fib(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input(\"Enter the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate: \"))\n    fibonacci_numbers = [fib(i) for i in range(n)]\n    print(fibonacci_numbers)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **fib Function:** This recursive function computes the Fibonacci number for a given `n`. It handles the base cases where `n` is 0 or 1 and recursively calls itself for larger values of `n`.\n   \n2. **main Function:** \n   - Prompts the user to input the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.\n   - Uses a list comprehension to generate the sequence by calling `fib(i)` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.\n   - Prints the list of Fibonacci numbers.\n\n3. **Efficiency Consideration:** For larger values of `n`, this approach can be inefficient due to excessive recomputation of the same Fibonacci numbers. To optimize, consider implementing memoization or using an iterative approach."
