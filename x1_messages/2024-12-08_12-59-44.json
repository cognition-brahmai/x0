        "content": "The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. In this case, the length is 8 inches and the width is 6 inches. So, the area would be 8 inches * 6 inches = 48 square inches. This is because area measures the amount of space inside a two-dimensional shape, and for rectangles, it's straightforward to find by using the formula: area = length * width."
