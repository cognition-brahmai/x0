        "content": "So I've got this problem here about creating passwords. The password format is 3 digits followed by 4 letters, and repetition is allowed. I need to figure out how many different passwords can be created under these conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the components of the password. It's made up of two parts: digits and letters. Specifically, there are 3 digits and 4 letters.\n\nLet's start by considering the digits. Since it's digits, I assume we're talking about the numbers 0 through 9. So, there are 10 possible choices for each digit.\n\nNow, since there are 3 digits and repetition is allowed, that means for each digit position, there are 10 possible choices, and the choices are independent of each other.\n\nSo, for the first digit, there are 10 choices (0-9).\n\nFor the second digit, again 10 choices (0-9), and the same for the third digit.\n\nSince these are independent, the total number of combinations for the digits is 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10, which is 10^3, or 1,000.\n\nNext, let's consider the letters. Assuming we're using the English alphabet, there are 26 letters (from A to Z).\n\nThe password requires 4 letters, and repetition is allowed, meaning each letter position can be any of the 26 letters, regardless of what's chosen before.\n\nSo, for each of the 4 letter positions, there are 26 possible choices.\n\nTherefore, the total number of combinations for the letters is 26 \u00d7 26 \u00d7 26 \u00d7 26, which is 26^4.\n\nCalculating 26^4:\n\n26 \u00d7 26 = 676\n\n676 \u00d7 26 = 17,576\n\n17,576 \u00d7 26 = 456,976\n\nSo, there are 456,976 possible combinations for the letters.\n\nNow, since the password is composed of both digits and letters, and the choices are independent of each other, the total number of possible passwords is the product of the number of digit combinations and the number of letter combinations.\n\nThat is, total passwords = (number of digit combinations) \u00d7 (number of letter combinations) = 1,000 \u00d7 456,976.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n1,000 \u00d7 456,976 = 456,976,000.\n\nSo, there are 456,976,000 possible different passwords that can be created under these conditions.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything I'm missing here? Let's double-check.\n\n- Password structure: 3 digits followed by 4 letters.\n\n- Repetition is allowed, meaning digits can repeat, and letters can repeat.\n\n- Digits: 0-9, 10 choices each.\n\n- Letters: A-Z, 26 choices each.\n\n- Total digit combinations: 10^3 = 1,000.\n\n- Total letter combinations: 26^4 = 456,976.\n\n- Total passwords: 1,000 \u00d7 456,976 = 456,976,000.\n\nSeems solid. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider whether the letters can be uppercase or lowercase. The problem doesn't specify, so I assumed uppercase only. If both uppercase and lowercase were allowed, there would be 52 choices per letter, but since it's not specified, I'll stick with 26.\n\nAlso, no restrictions on digits, so 0-9 are all allowed, including leading zeros.\n\nSo, my final answer is 456,976,000 possible passwords.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{456976000} \\]"
