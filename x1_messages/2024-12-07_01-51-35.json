        "content": "Let's see. I need to buy 20 pencils and 20 erasers, and they're sold in packs. Pencils come in packs of 10 for $3, and erasers come in packs of 5 for $4. So, first, I need to figure out how many packs of each I need to buy to get 20 of each.\n\nFor pencils: Each pack has 10 pencils, and I need 20. So, 20 divided by 10 is 2. So, I need 2 packs of pencils.\n\nFor erasers: Each pack has 5 erasers, and I need 20. So, 20 divided by 5 is 4. So, I need 4 packs of erasers.\n\nNow, each pack of pencils costs $3, and I'm buying 2 packs, so that's 2 times $3, which is $6.\n\nEach pack of erasers costs $4, and I'm buying 4 packs, so that's 4 times $4, which is $16.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I add the cost of the pencils and the erasers together. So, $6 plus $16 is $22.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to buy them to save some money? Let's see. Maybe buying them in larger packs or something. But, in this case, they only sell in those specific packs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can buy individual pencils and erasers, but the problem says they're sold in packs, so probably not.\n\nSo, I think $22 is the total cost to buy 20 pencils and 20 erasers.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nPacks of pencils: 2 packs at $3 each: 2 * 3 = $6\n\nPacks of erasers: 4 packs at $4 each: 4 * 4 = $16\n\nTotal: $6 + $16 = $22\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22} \\]"
