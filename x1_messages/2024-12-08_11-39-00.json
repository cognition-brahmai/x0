The chords in a progression are represented by roman numerals and are determined by the key. For example, in the key of C major, the progression I-IV-V (1-4-5) would correspond to the chords C, F, and G. Which of the following statements about chord progressions is most accurate?\nA. Chord progressions do not establish a tonality.\nB. The chords in a progression are not determined by the key.\nC. Chord progressions cannot contradict a tonality.\nD. The chords in a progression are not represented by roman numerals.\nE. The chords in a progression are determined by the key and are represented by roman numerals."

        "content": "Let's dive into this question about chord progressions in music theory. So, first off, I need to understand what a chord progression is. From the information given, it's a sequence of chords that create harmony in a piece of music, and these chords have a goal to establish or even contradict a tonality based on a key, root, or tonic chord.\n\nNow, chords in a progression are represented by Roman numerals, and these numerals correspond to the degrees of the scale in the key. For example, in C major, I is C, IV is F, and V is G. That makes sense because in any major key, the first degree is the tonic, the fourth degree is the subdominant, and the fifth degree is the dominant.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Chord progressions do not establish a tonality.\n\nB. The chords in a progression are not determined by the key.\n\nC. Chord progressions cannot contradict a tonality.\n\nD. The chords in a progression are not represented by Roman numerals.\n\nE. The chords in a progression are determined by the key and are represented by Roman numerals.\n\nOption A says that chord progressions do not establish a tonality. But according to the definition, chord progressions aim to establish or even contradict a tonality. So, this seems incorrect because they do aim to establish a tonality.\n\nOption B says that the chords in a progression are not determined by the key. But the information provided clearly states that the chords are determined by the key. For example, in C major, I is C, IV is F, and V is G. So, this seems wrong too.\n\nOption C claims that chord progressions cannot contradict a tonality. But the definition mentions that chord progressions can contradict a tonality. So, this is also incorrect.\n\nOption D says that chords in a progression are not represented by Roman numerals. However, the information provided states that chords are represented by Roman numerals in the context of the key. So, this is false.\n\nOption E states that the chords in a progression are determined by the key and are represented by Roman numerals. This aligns perfectly with the information given.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. Is it possible that more than one statement could be accurate, or is it a choose-the-most-accurate kind of question? The way it's phrased, it seems like we're to choose the most accurate statement about chord progressions from the given options.\n\nLooking back, options A, B, C, and D are all negations or contradictions of the provided information, while option E correctly summarizes the key points.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is E: The chords in a progression are determined by the key and are represented by Roman numerals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{E} \\]"
