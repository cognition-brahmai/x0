        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. So, you need a Python function that determines whether a given number is a perfect square. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer. For example, 16 is a perfect square because it's 4 squared, but 14 is not.\n\nTo solve this, we can take the square root of the number and check if it's an integer. If the square root is an integer, then the number is a perfect square.\n\nHere's a simple way to do it:\n\n1. Import the math module to use the square root function.\n2. Calculate the square root of the given number.\n3. Check if the square root is an integer by comparing it to its integer cast version.\n4. If they are equal, the number is a perfect square; otherwise, it's not.\n\nLet me write this as a function for you.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo check if a given number is a perfect square, we can use the following Python function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    sqrt_n = math.sqrt(n)\n    return sqrt_n.is_integer()\n```\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Import the math module**: This module provides the `sqrt` function, which computes the square root of a number.\n2. **Check if the number is negative**: Since negative numbers cannot be perfect squares, we immediately return `False` if the number is negative.\n3. **Compute the square root**: Use `math.sqrt(n)` to find the square root of the number.\n4. **Check if the square root is an integer**: Use the `is_integer` method to check if the square root is an integer. This method returns `True` if the float is an integer (i.e., has no fractional part), and `False` otherwise.\n\nThis approach is efficient and straightforward, ensuring that we correctly identify perfect squares by leveraging the properties of square roots."
