        "content": "To calculate the surface area of a sphere, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ A = 4\\pi r^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( A \\) is the surface area and \\( r \\) is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius \\( r \\) is 6 centimeters, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\n\\[ A = 4\\pi (6)^2 \\]\n\nFirst, we need to square the radius:\n\n\\[ (6)^2 = 36 \\]\n\nSo, the formula now becomes:\n\n\\[ A = 4\\pi \\times 36 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 4 by 36:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 36 = 144 \\]\n\nTherefore, the surface area is:\n\n\\[ A = 144\\pi \\]\n\nIf we want to get a numerical value, we can approximate \\( \\pi \\) as 3.1416:\n\n\\[ A \\approx 144 \\times 3.1416 = 452.3904 \\]\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere is approximately 452.39 square centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{144\\pi \\text{ or approximately } 452.39 \\text{ square centimeters}} \\]"
