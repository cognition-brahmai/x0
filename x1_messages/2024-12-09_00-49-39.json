        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a container with a mixture of two liquids, A and B, and initially, their ratio is 3:5. Then, someone adds 12 liters of liquid A, and after that, the ratio becomes 5:5. We need to find out what the initial volume of the mixture was.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the ratio means. The initial ratio of A to B is 3:5, which means that for every 3 parts of A, there are 5 parts of B. Similarly, after adding 12 liters of A, the ratio becomes 5:5, meaning the amounts of A and B become equal.\n\nLet's denote the initial amount of liquid A as 3x liters and the initial amount of liquid B as 5x liters, where x is a multiplier that will help us find the actual volumes.\n\nSo, initially:\n- Liquid A = 3x liters\n- Liquid B = 5x liters\n\nTotal initial mixture = 3x + 5x = 8x liters\n\nNow, 12 liters of A are added, so the new amount of A becomes:\n- New A = 3x + 12 liters\n\nThe amount of B remains the same since only A is added:\n- B = 5x liters\n\nAfter adding A, the ratio becomes 5:5, which simplifies to 1:1, meaning the amounts of A and B are equal.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n3x + 12 = 5x\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n3x + 12 = 5x\n12 = 5x - 3x\n12 = 2x\nx = 6 liters\n\nNow that we have x, we can find the initial amounts:\n- Initial A = 3x = 3 * 6 = 18 liters\n- Initial B = 5x = 5 * 6 = 30 liters\n\nTotal initial mixture = 18 + 30 = 48 liters\n\nLet me just double-check this to make sure it makes sense.\nInitially, A:B is 18:30, which simplifies to 3:5 (since 18/6 : 30/6 = 3:5). That checks out.\n\nAfter adding 12 liters to A, new A becomes 18 + 12 = 30 liters.\nB remains 30 liters.\nSo, the new ratio is 30:30, which is 1:1, or 5:5 as given.\n\nPerfect, it all adds up. So, the initial volume of the mixture was 48 liters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
