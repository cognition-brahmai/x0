        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a construction company building a new residential complex with 10 apartment buildings. Each building has 8 floors, and each floor has 4 apartments. The average size of each apartment is 1000 square feet, and the construction cost is $150 per square foot. We need to calculate the total construction cost for the entire complex and then determine the minimum selling price per apartment to achieve a 20% profit.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total number of apartments in the entire complex. Let's break it down:\n\n1. There are 10 buildings.\n2. Each building has 8 floors.\n3. Each floor has 4 apartments.\n\nSo, the total number of apartments is:\n\nTotal apartments = Number of buildings \u00d7 Number of floors per building \u00d7 Number of apartments per floor\nTotal apartments = 10 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 4\nTotal apartments = 80 \u00d7 4\nTotal apartments = 320\n\nAlright, so there are 320 apartments in total.\n\nNext, I need to find out the total square footage of the entire complex. Since each apartment is 1000 square feet, I can multiply the number of apartments by the size of each apartment:\n\nTotal square footage = Total apartments \u00d7 Size per apartment\nTotal square footage = 320 \u00d7 1000\nTotal square footage = 320,000 square feet\n\nNow, the construction cost is $150 per square foot. So, the total construction cost for the entire complex would be:\n\nTotal construction cost = Total square footage \u00d7 Cost per square foot\nTotal construction cost = 320,000 \u00d7 150\nTotal construction cost = 48,000,000\n\nSo, the total construction cost is $48,000,000.\n\nNow, the company wants to make a 20% profit on the project. To find out the total selling price needed to achieve this profit, I need to calculate 20% of the construction cost and then add it to the construction cost.\n\nFirst, calculate 20% of the construction cost:\n\nProfit = Total construction cost \u00d7 20%\nProfit = 48,000,000 \u00d7 0.20\nProfit = 9,600,000\n\nSo, the profit is $9,600,000.\n\nTherefore, the total selling price should be:\n\nTotal selling price = Total construction cost + Profit\nTotal selling price = 48,000,000 + 9,600,000\nTotal selling price = 57,600,000\n\nNow, to find the minimum selling price per apartment, I need to divide the total selling price by the total number of apartments:\n\nSelling price per apartment = Total selling price / Total apartments\nSelling price per apartment = 57,600,000 / 320\nSelling price per apartment = 180,000\n\nSo, the minimum selling price per apartment should be $180,000 to achieve a 20% profit on the project.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total apartments: 10 buildings \u00d7 8 floors \u00d7 4 apartments = 320 apartments. That seems correct.\n\nTotal square footage: 320 apartments \u00d7 1000 sq ft = 320,000 sq ft. Correct.\n\nTotal construction cost: 320,000 sq ft \u00d7 $150/sq ft = $48,000,000. Correct.\n\nProfit: 20% of $48,000,000 = $9,600,000. Correct.\n\nTotal selling price: $48,000,000 + $9,600,000 = $57,600,000. Correct.\n\nSelling price per apartment: $57,600,000 / 320 apartments = $180,000 per apartment. Correct.\n\nLooks like everything checks out. So, the final answer is that the minimum selling price per apartment should be $180,000 to achieve a 20% profit on the construction project.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180000} \\]"
