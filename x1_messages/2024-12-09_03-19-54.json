        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to write a Java program that simulates a simplified version of Blackjack. I need to make sure I cover all the features mentioned.\n\nFirst, I need to represent a deck of cards. A standard deck has 52 cards, with ranks from 2 to 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace, and four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades.\n\nI think I'll create a Card class to represent each card, with fields for rank and suit. Maybe I'll use enums for rank and suit to make it cleaner.\n\nSo, defining enums for Rank and Suit:\n\n```java\npublic enum Suit {\n    HEARTS, DIAMONDS, CLUBS, SPADES\n}\n\npublic enum Rank {\n    TWO(2), THREE(3), FOUR(4), FIVE(5), SIX(6), SEVEN(7), EIGHT(8), NINE(9), TEN(10),\n    JACK(10), QUEEN(10), KING(10), ACE(11);\n\n    private final int value;\n\n    Rank(int value) {\n        this.value = value;\n    }\n\n    public int getValue() {\n        return value;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, the Card class:\n\n```java\npublic class Card {\n    private final Suit suit;\n    private final Rank rank;\n\n    public Card(Suit suit, Rank rank) {\n        this.suit = suit;\n        this.rank = rank;\n    }\n\n    public Suit getSuit() {\n        return suit;\n    }\n\n    public Rank getRank() {\n        return rank;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return rank.name() + \" of \" + suit.name();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNext, I need to create a Deck class that holds all the cards and can shuffle and deal them.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Collections;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class Deck {\n    private List<Card> cards;\n\n    public Deck() {\n        cards = new ArrayList<>();\n        for (Suit suit : Suit.values()) {\n            for (Rank rank : Rank.values()) {\n                cards.add(new Card(suit, rank));\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void shuffle() {\n        Collections.shuffle(cards);\n    }\n\n    public Card dealCard() {\n        if (cards.isEmpty()) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(\"No more cards in the deck\");\n        }\n        return cards.remove(0);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, I need to represent the hands of the player and the dealer. I'll create a Hand class that holds a list of cards and can calculate the total value.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class Hand {\n    private List<Card> cards;\n\n    public Hand() {\n        cards = new ArrayList<>();\n    }\n\n    public void addCard(Card card) {\n        cards.add(card);\n    }\n\n    public int calculateValue() {\n        int value = 0;\n        int aceCount = 0;\n        for (Card card : cards) {\n            value += card.getRank().getValue();\n            if (card.getRank() == Rank.ACE) {\n                aceCount++;\n            }\n        }\n        while (value > 21 && aceCount > 0) {\n            value -= 10;\n            aceCount--;\n        }\n        return value;\n    }\n\n    public void clear() {\n        cards.clear();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        for (Card card : cards) {\n            sb.append(card).append(\", \");\n        }\n        sb.setLength(sb.length() - 2); // Remove trailing comma and space\n        return sb.toString();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the Hand class, I'm handling Aces by initially counting them as 11, and then adjusting them to 1 if the total exceeds 21.\n\nNow, I need to set up the game logic. I'll create a BlackjackGame class that manages the game flow.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class BlackjackGame {\n    private Deck deck;\n    private Hand playerHand;\n    private Hand dealerHand;\n    private Scanner scanner;\n\n    public BlackjackGame() {\n        deck = new Deck();\n        playerHand = new Hand();\n        dealerHand = new Hand();\n        scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n    }\n\n    public void play() {\n        deck.shuffle();\n        dealInitialCards();\n        showHands(true);\n\n        while (true) {\n            System.out.println(\"Do you want to hit or stand? (h/s)\");\n            String choice = scanner.nextLine().toLowerCase();\n            if (choice.equals(\"h\")) {\n                playerHand.addCard(deck.dealCard());\n                showHands(true);\n                if (playerHand.calculateValue() > 21) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Bust! You lose.\");\n                    return;\n                }\n            } else if (choice.equals(\"s\")) {\n                break;\n            } else {\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid choice. Please enter h or s.\");\n            }\n        }\n\n        while (dealerHand.calculateValue() < 17) {\n            dealerHand.addCard(deck.dealCard());\n        }\n\n        showHands(false);\n\n        int playerValue = playerHand.calculateValue();\n        int dealerValue = dealerHand.calculateValue();\n\n        if (dealerValue > 21) {\n            System.out.println(\"Dealer busts! You win.\");\n        } else if (playerValue > dealerValue) {\n            System.out.println(\"You win.\");\n        } else if (playerValue < dealerValue) {\n            System.out.println(\"You lose.\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Push.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void dealInitialCards() {\n        playerHand.addCard(deck.dealCard());\n        dealerHand.addCard(deck.dealCard());\n        playerHand.addCard(deck.dealCard());\n        dealerHand.addCard(deck.dealCard());\n    }\n\n    private void showHands(boolean hideDealerCard) {\n        System.out.println(\"Player's hand: \" + playerHand);\n        System.out.println(\"Player's total: \" + playerHand.calculateValue());\n        if (hideDealerCard) {\n            System.out.println(\"Dealer's hand: \" + dealerHand.getCard(0) + \", [Hidden]\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Dealer's hand: \" + dealerHand);\n            System.out.println(\"Dealer's total: \" + dealerHand.calculateValue());\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        BlackjackGame game = new BlackjackGame();\n        game.play();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this setup, the game starts by shuffling the deck and dealing two cards to both the player and the dealer. The player can choose to hit or stand. If the player's total exceeds 21, they bust and lose. If they stand, the dealer draws cards until their total is 17 or higher, then the winner is determined based on whose total is closer to 21 without exceeding it.\n\nI need to make sure that the dealer's second card is hidden initially and only revealed at the end.\n\nAlso, I should handle the case where the player or dealer has a Blackjack (an Ace and a ten-value card, totaling 21) immediately after the initial deal.\n\nLet me adjust the play method to check for Blackjack.\n\n```java\npublic void play() {\n    deck.shuffle();\n    dealInitialCards();\n    showHands(true);\n\n    int playerValue = playerHand.calculateValue();\n    int dealerValue = dealerHand.calculateValue();\n\n    if (playerValue == 21) {\n        if (dealerValue == 21) {\n            System.out.println(\"Both have Blackjack! Push.\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Blackjack! You win.\");\n        }\n        return;\n    } else if (dealerValue == 21) {\n        System.out.println(\"Dealer has Blackjack! You lose.\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    while (true) {\n        System.out.println(\"Do you want to hit or stand? (h/s)\");\n        String choice = scanner.nextLine().toLowerCase();\n        if (choice.equals(\"h\")) {\n            playerHand.addCard(deck.dealCard());\n            showHands(true);\n            if (playerHand.calculateValue() > 21) {\n                System.out.println(\"Bust! You lose.\");\n                return;\n            }\n        } else if (choice.equals(\"s\")) {\n            break;\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid choice. Please enter h or s.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    while (dealerHand.calculateValue() < 17) {\n        dealerHand.addCard(deck.dealCard());\n    }\n\n    showHands(false);\n\n    playerValue = playerHand.calculateValue();\n    dealerValue = dealerHand.calculateValue();\n\n    if (dealerValue > 21) {\n        System.out.println(\"Dealer busts! You win.\");\n    } else if (playerValue > dealerValue) {\n        System.out.println(\"You win.\");\n    } else if (playerValue < dealerValue) {\n        System.out.println(\"You lose.\");\n    } else {\n        System.out.println(\"Push.\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, if either the player or the dealer has a Blackjack after the initial deal, the game ends immediately with the appropriate message.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, like running out of cards in the deck, but for simplicity, I'll assume the deck is limitless or handle it by creating a new deck when necessary.\n\nAdditionally, in a real Blackjack game, there are more features like splitting pairs, doubling down, etc., but since this is a simplified version, I'll omit those.\n\nFinally, I need to make sure that the program is user-friendly and handles invalid inputs gracefully.\n\nI think this should cover the basic requirements for a simplified Blackjack game in Java.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simplified version of the Blackjack card game in Java, we need to simulate the game's core features. This includes creating a deck of cards, shuffling them, dealing cards to both the player and the dealer, allowing the player to hit or stand, and determining the winner based on standard Blackjack rules.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Card Representation:**\n   - Use enums for `Suit` and `Rank` to represent the suits and ranks of the cards.\n   - Create a `Card` class to hold the suit and rank.\n\n2. **Deck Management:**\n   - Create a `Deck` class to manage the deck of cards, including shuffling and dealing cards.\n\n3. **Hand Management:**\n   - Use a `Hand` class to manage the cards held by the player and the dealer, including calculating the total value of the hand.\n\n4. **Game Logic:**\n   - Implement the game logic in the `BlackjackGame` class, handling player decisions to hit or stand, and determining the winner based on Blackjack rules.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Collections;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic enum Suit {\n    HEARTS, DIAMONDS, CLUBS, SPADES\n}\n\npublic enum Rank {\n    TWO(2), THREE(3), FOUR(4), FIVE(5), SIX(6), SEVEN(7), EIGHT(8), NINE(9), TEN(10),\n    JACK(10), QUEEN(10), KING(10), ACE(11);\n\n    private final int value;\n\n    Rank(int value) {\n        this.value = value;\n    }\n\n    public int getValue() {\n        return value;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Card {\n    private final Suit suit;\n    private final Rank rank;\n\n    public Card(Suit suit, Rank rank) {\n        this.suit = suit;\n        this.rank = rank;\n    }\n\n    public Suit getSuit() {\n        return suit;\n    }\n\n    public Rank getRank() {\n        return rank;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return rank.name() + \" of \" + suit.name();\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Deck {\n    private List<Card> cards;\n\n    public Deck() {\n        cards = new ArrayList<>();\n        for (Suit suit : Suit.values()) {\n            for (Rank rank : Rank.values()) {\n                cards.add(new Card(suit, rank));\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void shuffle() {\n        Collections.shuffle(cards);\n    }\n\n    public Card dealCard() {\n        if (cards.isEmpty()) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(\"No more cards in the deck\");\n        }\n        return cards.remove(0);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Hand {\n    private List<Card> cards;\n\n    public Hand() {\n        cards = new ArrayList<>();\n    }\n\n    public void addCard(Card card) {\n        cards.add(card);\n    }\n\n    public int calculateValue() {\n        int value = 0;\n        int aceCount = 0;\n        for (Card card : cards) {\n            value += card.getRank().getValue();\n            if (card.getRank() == Rank.ACE) {\n                aceCount++;\n            }\n        }\n        while (value > 21 && aceCount > 0) {\n            value -= 10;\n            aceCount--;\n        }\n        return value;\n    }\n\n    public void clear() {\n        cards.clear();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        for (Card card : cards) {\n            sb.append(card).append(\", \");\n        }\n        sb.setLength(sb.length() - 2); // Remove trailing comma and space\n        return sb.toString();\n    }\n}\n\npublic class BlackjackGame {\n    private Deck deck;\n    private Hand playerHand;\n    private Hand dealerHand;\n    private Scanner scanner;\n\n    public BlackjackGame() {\n        deck = new Deck();\n        playerHand = new Hand();\n        dealerHand = new Hand();\n        scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n    }\n\n    public void play() {\n        deck.shuffle();\n        dealInitialCards();\n        showHands(true);\n\n        int playerValue = playerHand.calculateValue();\n        int dealerValue = dealerHand.calculateValue();\n\n        if (playerValue == 21) {\n            if (dealerValue == 21) {\n                System.out.println(\"Both have Blackjack!
