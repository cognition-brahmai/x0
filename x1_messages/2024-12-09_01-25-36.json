So, total legs would be the legs of the cats plus the legs of the spider. That is 20 plus 8, which equals 28 legs in total. Wait, but I think I should consider if there are any other legs in the room. Like, maybe there's a person or something else. But the question only mentions cats and a spider. So, probably, just the cats and the spider's legs. So, 28 legs in total. Yeah, that should be it."
