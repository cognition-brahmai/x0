I'm writing to discuss a difficult but necessary step we need to take as a company in response to the financial impact of the global pandemic.\n\nAs you're all aware, the COVID-19 crisis has had an unprecedented effect on economies worldwide, and our industry has not been spared. Our revenue has been significantly impacted, and we're facing financial difficulties that threaten the very existence of our company. After careful consideration and exploration of all possible options, I've concluded that implementing a temporary pay cut is the best way to preserve jobs and ensure the long-term sustainability of our organization.\n\nEffective immediately, all employee salaries will be reduced by [percentage] for the next [duration]. This decision was not made lightly, and I understand that this will cause hardship for many of you. Please know that I share your concerns and frustrations, and I'm doing everything in my power to navigate us through this crisis.\n\nI want to assure you that this pay cut is strictly temporary and will be reconsidered as soon as our financial situation improves. Our goal is to return to normal salaries as quickly as possible, and I'm confident that together, we can weather this storm and emerge stronger than before.\n\nI also want to emphasize that this pay cut applies to all employees, including myself and the executive team. We are all in this together, and we will all share in the sacrifices needed to protect our company and our jobs.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we will be exploring cost-saving measures and identifying areas where we can cut expenses without compromising our core operations or our commitment to innovation and excellence. I will keep you updated on our progress and any additional steps we need to take.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out to me or your department heads if you have any questions or concerns. We're all in this together, and I appreciate your understanding, resilience, and continued dedication to our company.\n\nThank you for your hard work and commitment.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\nCEO, [Company Name]"
