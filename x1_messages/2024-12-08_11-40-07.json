        "content": "The U.S. state you're referring to is Alaska, often called the \"Last Frontier.\" It is indeed home to Denali, which was formerly known as Mount McKinley. Denali stands at 20,310 feet (6,190 meters) above sea level, making it the highest peak in North America.\n\nAlaska is not only renowned for its majestic mountains but also for its vast wilderness, diverse wildlife, and unique cultural heritage. It's the largest state in the U.S. by area, covering more than twice the size of Texas, yet it has a relatively small population compared to other states.\n\nDenali National Park and Preserve, where Denali is located, is a popular destination for hikers, climbers, and nature enthusiasts. The park is known for its subarctic climate and the opportunity to see wildlife such as grizzly bears, caribou, and Dall sheep.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about Alaska or Denali, feel free to ask!"
