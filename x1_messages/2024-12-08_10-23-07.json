        "content": "So John has this book with 200 pages, and he's planning to read 25 pages every day. He wants to know how many days it will take him to finish the book. Alright, let's figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a total number of pages, which is 200, and John reads 25 pages each day. I need to find out how many days it will take for him to read all 200 pages.\n\nWell, this seems like a division problem. If he reads 25 pages a day, I can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day to find out how many days it will take.\n\nSo, total pages divided by pages per day: 200 \u00f7 25.\n\nLet me do that calculation. 25 times 8 is 200, right? So, 200 divided by 25 is 8.\n\nTherefore, it will take John 8 days to finish the book.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way could be to think about it multiplicatively. If he reads 25 pages a day, after how many days will he reach 200 pages?\n\nSo, 25 pages/day \u00d7 number of days = 200 pages.\n\nTo find the number of days, I can rearrange this equation: number of days = 200 pages \u00f7 25 pages/day.\n\nAgain, that gives me 8 days.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using addition. If he reads 25 pages each day, I could keep adding 25 until I reach 200.\n\nLet's see:\n\nDay 1: 25 pages\n\nDay 2: 25 + 25 = 50 pages\n\nDay 3: 50 + 25 = 75 pages\n\nDay 4: 75 + 25 = 100 pages\n\nDay 5: 100 + 25 = 125 pages\n\nDay 6: 125 + 25 = 150 pages\n\nDay 7: 150 + 25 = 175 pages\n\nDay 8: 175 + 25 = 200 pages.\n\nYes, after 8 days, he reaches 200 pages.\n\nSo, all three methods\u2014division, multiplication, and addition\u2014lead me to the same conclusion that it will take John 8 days to finish the book.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nFor example, does the book have any pre-read pages or pages that don't need to be read, like copyright pages or appendixes? But the problem says the book has 200 pages, and John reads 25 pages every day, so I think we can assume that all pages are to be read.\n\nAlso, is there a possibility that John might read more or less on certain days? The problem states that he reads 25 pages every day, so it's safe to assume it's a consistent daily reading schedule.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the number of pages per day divides evenly into the total number of pages. In this case, 25 divides evenly into 200, giving us a whole number, 8. If it didn't divide evenly, we might have to deal with fractions of days, but here it's straightforward.\n\nSo, in conclusion, it will take John 8 days to finish the book if he reads 25 pages every day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
