        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store selling apples and oranges. Apples are $2 per pound, and oranges are $3 per pound. A customer buys a total of 8 pounds of fruit and spends $20. We need to find out how many pounds of each type of fruit they bought.\n\nFirst, I think I should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define:\n\n- Let \\( a \\) be the pounds of apples bought.\n\n- Let \\( o \\) be the pounds of oranges bought.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total weight of fruit bought is 8 pounds.\n\n2. The total cost of the fruit is $20.\n\nSo, I can write these as equations:\n\n1. \\( a + o = 8 \\) (total pounds)\n\n2. \\( 2a + 3o = 20 \\) (total cost)\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations with two variables. I need to solve for \\( a \\) and \\( o \\).\n\nI can use the first equation to express one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve the first equation for \\( a \\):\n\n\\( a = 8 - o \\)\n\nNow, I can substitute this expression for \\( a \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 2(8 - o) + 3o = 20 \\)\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n\\( 16 - 2o + 3o = 20 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 16 + o = 20 \\)\n\nNow, subtract 16 from both sides:\n\n\\( o = 4 \\)\n\nSo, the customer bought 4 pounds of oranges.\n\nNow, plug this back into the expression for \\( a \\):\n\n\\( a = 8 - 4 = 4 \\)\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 4 pounds of apples and 4 pounds of oranges.\n\nBut wait, let me check if this makes sense. Apples are $2 per pound, so 4 pounds would cost $8. Oranges are $3 per pound, so 4 pounds would cost $12. Total cost would be $8 + $12 = $20, which matches the given total cost. Also, 4 + 4 = 8 pounds, which matches the total weight. So, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if there's another way to solve this. Maybe using substitution differently or by elimination.\n\nLet's try the elimination method. Starting with the two equations:\n\n1. \\( a + o = 8 \\)\n\n2. \\( 2a + 3o = 20 \\)\n\nI can multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \\( a \\):\n\n\\( 2a + 2o = 16 \\)\n\nNow, subtract this from the second equation:\n\n\\( (2a + 3o) - (2a + 2o) = 20 - 16 \\)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\( o = 4 \\)\n\nAgain, we get that \\( o = 4 \\), and then \\( a = 8 - 4 = 4 \\).\n\nSo, both methods give the same answer.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using ratios or something else.\n\nWell, the cost per pound for apples is $2 and for oranges is $3. The customer spent $20 for 8 pounds. I could think about the average cost per pound.\n\nTotal cost is $20 for 8 pounds, so average cost per pound is \\( \\frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \\) dollars per pound.\n\nNow, apples are $2 per pound and oranges are $3 per pound. The average is $2.5, which is right in the middle. So, it makes sense that the customer bought equal pounds of apples and oranges, which is what we found: 4 pounds each.\n\nIf the average cost was closer to $2, then more apples were bought, and if it was closer to $3, then more oranges were bought.\n\nSo, in this case, since $2.5 is exactly in the middle, the pounds of apples and oranges are equal.\n\nThis is a good way to check the reasonableness of the answer.\n\nAre there any other checks I can do?\n\nWell, I can consider if the customer bought only apples or only oranges.\n\nIf they bought all apples: 8 pounds at $2 per pound would cost $16, which is less than $20.\n\nIf they bought all oranges: 8 pounds at $3 per pound would cost $24, which is more than $20.\n\nSo, buying a combination of both makes sense, and our answer of 4 pounds each totaling $20 matches.\n\nAnother way is to consider the difference in cost.\n\nIf all 8 pounds were apples, cost would be $16.\n\nBut the customer spent $20, which is $4 more than $16.\n\nEach pound of orange costs $1 more than apples ($3 - $2 = $1).\n\nSo, to make up the $4 difference, the customer must have bought 4 pounds of oranges instead of apples.\n\nTherefore, 4 pounds of apples and 4 pounds of oranges.\n\nThis confirms our earlier answer.\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same conclusion: the customer bought 4 pounds of apples and 4 pounds of oranges.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ pounds of apples and } 4 \\text{ pounds of oranges}} \\]"
