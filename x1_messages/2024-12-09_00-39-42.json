        "content": "Certainly! Below is a simple SQL database schema for a library management system, along with some sample queries to perform common operations such as adding a new book, issuing a book to a member, returning a book, and finding books by author or title.\n\n### Database Schema\n\nWe'll create several tables to represent different entities in the library system:\n\n1. **Books**: Stores information about the books.\n2. **Members**: Stores information about the library members.\n3. **Authors**: Stores information about the authors.\n4. **BookAuthors**: Associative table to handle the many-to-many relationship between books and authors.\n5. **Loans**: Tracks which books are issued to which members and when.\n\n#### SQL Statements to Create Tables\n\n```sql\n-- Create Books table\nCREATE TABLE Books (\n    BookID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    Title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    ISBN VARCHAR(13) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n    PublicationYear INT,\n    AvailableCopies INT DEFAULT 0\n);\n\n-- Create Members table\nCREATE TABLE Members (\n    MemberID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    FirstName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    LastName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    JoinDate DATE\n);\n\n-- Create Authors table\nCREATE TABLE Authors (\n    AuthorID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    FirstName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    LastName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL\n);\n\n-- Create BookAuthors table (many-to-many relationship)\nCREATE TABLE BookAuthors (\n    BookID INT,\n    AuthorID INT,\n    PRIMARY KEY (BookID, AuthorID),\n    FOREIGN KEY (BookID) REFERENCES Books(BookID),\n    FOREIGN KEY (AuthorID) REFERENCES Authors(AuthorID)\n);\n\n-- Create Loans table\nCREATE TABLE Loans (\n    LoanID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    BookID INT,\n    MemberID INT,\n    IssueDate DATE,\n    DueDate DATE,\n    ReturnDate DATE,\n    FOREIGN KEY (BookID) REFERENCES Books(BookID),\n    FOREIGN KEY (MemberID) REFERENCES Members(MemberID)\n);\n```\n\n### Sample Queries\n\n#### 1. Adding a New Book\n\nTo add a new book, you need to insert into the `Books` table and then link it to authors in the `BookAuthors` table.\n\n```sql\n-- Insert a new book\nINSERT INTO Books (Title, ISBN, PublicationYear, AvailableCopies)\nVALUES ('Sample Book', '1234567890123', 2020, 5);\n\n-- Get the BookID of the newly inserted book\nSET @book_id = LAST_INSERT_ID();\n\n-- Insert authors for the book\nINSERT INTO Authors (FirstName, LastName) VALUES ('John', 'Doe');\nSET @author_id = LAST_INSERT_ID();\n\n-- Link the book to the author\nINSERT INTO BookAuthors (BookID, AuthorID) VALUES (@book_id, @author_id);\n```\n\n#### 2. Issuing a Book to a Member\n\nWhen issuing a book, update the `Loans` table and decrease the available copies in the `Books` table.\n\n```sql\n-- Insert a new loan record\nINSERT INTO Loans (BookID, MemberID, IssueDate, DueDate)\nVALUES (1, 1, CURDATE(), DATE_ADD(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 14 DAY));\n\n-- Decrease available copies\nUPDATE Books SET AvailableCopies = AvailableCopies - 1 WHERE BookID = 1;\n```\n\n#### 3. Returning a Book\n\nWhen returning a book, update the `Loans` table with the return date and increase the available copies in the `Books` table.\n\n```sql\n-- Update the loan record to set return date\nUPDATE Loans SET ReturnDate = CURDATE() WHERE LoanID = 1;\n\n-- Increase available copies\nUPDATE Books SET AvailableCopies = AvailableCopies + 1 WHERE BookID = 1;\n```\n\n#### 4. Finding Books by Author or Title\n\nTo find books by author or title, you can use JOIN operations.\n\n##### Finding books by author:\n\n```sql\nSELECT b.BookID, b.Title, a.FirstName, a.LastName\nFROM Books b\nJOIN BookAuthors ba ON b.BookID = ba.BookID\nJOIN Authors a ON ba.AuthorID = a.AuthorID\nWHERE a.FirstName = 'John' AND a.LastName = 'Doe';\n```\n\n##### Finding books by title:\n\n```sql\nSELECT BookID, Title\nFROM Books\nWHERE Title LIKE '%Sample%';\n```\n\nThese queries and table structures provide a basic framework for a library management system. You can expand upon this schema by adding more tables and fields as needed, such as for genres, publishers, or member addresses."
