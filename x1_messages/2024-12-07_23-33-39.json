        "content": "So we've got this problem here about probabilities with eye colors. Let's see what it's asking. There's a group of people where 40% have brown eyes, 30% have green eyes, and the remaining 30% have blue eyes. And we need to find the probability that if we pick two people at random from this group, both of them have brown eyes.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what probability means in this context. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nNow, in this case, the favorable outcome is selecting two people who both have brown eyes. The total possible outcomes would be all possible pairs of people that can be selected from the group.\n\nBut wait, the problem gives percentages for each eye color. So, 40% have brown eyes, which means that if there are, say, 100 people in the group, 40 of them would have brown eyes, 30 have green eyes, and 30 have blue eyes. But since the group size isn't specified, we can assume it's a large group, and the percentages hold.\n\nNow, selecting two people at random from this group. I need to find the probability that both have brown eyes.\n\nOne way to approach this is to think about it step by step. First, what's the probability that the first person selected has brown eyes? Well, since 40% of the group has brown eyes, the probability is 40%, or 0.4.\n\nNow, given that the first person has brown eyes, what's the probability that the second person also has brown eyes? If the group is large, removing one person won't affect the percentages much, so we can assume it's still 40%.\n\nBut wait, in probability terms, when dealing with selections without replacement (which is the case here, since we're selecting two distinct people), the probabilities are slightly different. But if the group is large, the effect is negligible.\n\nSo, the probability that both events happen\u2014both people have brown eyes\u2014is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nP(both have brown eyes) = P(first has brown eyes) * P(second has brown eyes | first has brown eyes)\n\nWhere P(second has brown eyes | first has brown eyes) is the conditional probability that the second person has brown eyes given that the first one does.\n\nNow, if the group is large, this conditional probability is approximately equal to P(second has brown eyes), which is 0.4.\n\nTherefore, P(both have brown eyes) \u2248 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.16, or 16%.\n\nBut let's be more precise. Suppose the group has N people. Then:\n\nNumber of people with brown eyes = 0.4N\n\nTotal ways to select 2 people from N: C(N, 2) = N(N-1)/2\n\nNumber of ways to select 2 people with brown eyes: C(0.4N, 2) = (0.4N)(0.4N - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, the exact probability is:\n\nP = [ (0.4N)(0.4N - 1)/2 ] / [ N(N-1)/2 ] = [ (0.4N)(0.4N - 1) ] / [ N(N-1) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (0.16N^2 - 0.4N) / (N^2 - N)\n\nNow, as N becomes large, the N^2 terms dominate, so:\n\nP \u2248 0.16N^2 / N^2 = 0.16\n\nWhich confirms our earlier approximation.\n\nAlternatively, if the group is small, we need to consider the exact calculation. But since the problem doesn't specify the group size, and percentages are given, it's safe to assume the group is large, and the approximation is acceptable.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the concept of independent events. If the selections are independent, which they are if the group is large, then the probability of both events happening is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nBut in reality, selections without replacement are dependent events, because the outcome of the first selection affects the second. However, in a large group, this dependence is very weak, so we can treat them as independent for practical purposes.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability that both selected people have brown eyes is approximately 0.16, or 16%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.16} \\]"
