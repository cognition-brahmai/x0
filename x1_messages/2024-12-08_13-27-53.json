        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. The company has a total budget of $50,000 for employee salaries, and they want to hire 5 employees with equal salaries. Additionally, there's an employment tax of 10% on each salary that the company has to pay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the total cost per employee will be, including the tax. If each employee gets a net salary of, say, S dollars, then the company has to pay an extra 10% on top of that for taxes. So, for each employee, the total cost to the company is S + 0.10*S = 1.10*S.\n\nSince there are 5 employees, the total cost for all employees will be 5 * 1.10*S = 5.50*S.\n\nNow, this total cost should equal the company's budget of $50,000. So, I can set up the equation:\n\n5.50*S = $50,000\n\nTo find the net salary S, I need to solve for S:\n\nS = $50,000 / 5.50\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n$50,000 / 5.50 = $9,090.9090...\n\nSo, the net salary per employee would be approximately $9,090.91.\n\nBut let me double-check this to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nIf each employee gets $9,090.91, then the employment tax per employee is 10% of that, which is $909.091.\n\nTherefore, the total cost per employee is $9,090.91 + $909.091 = $10,000.001, which is essentially $10,000 per employee.\n\nFor 5 employees, the total cost would be 5 * $10,000 = $50,000, which matches the budget.\n\nSo, the net salary of each employee would be $9,090.91.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9090.91} \\]"
