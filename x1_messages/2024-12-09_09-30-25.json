Gasping, she sees a boat, humans staring in wonder. A child waves; Zara mimics, splashing. Laughter echoes. Back underwater, she shares her adventure, inspiring her pod to explore. They start beaching, meeting humans, forming bonds. Their world expands, bridging species, hearts entwined in trust and joy."
