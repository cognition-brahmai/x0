        "content": "Let's see. The company sells t-shirts for $15 each, and they're offering a 20% discount during the sale. I need to find out how much each t-shirt will cost after the discount.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a 20% discount means. A percentage discount is a reduction in price based on a percentage of the original price. So, 20% off means the customer saves 20% of the original price.\n\nTo calculate the discount amount, I can multiply the original price by the discount percentage. But I need to make sure to convert the percentage into a decimal because percentages are out of 100. So, 20% as a decimal is 0.20.\n\nSo, the discount amount is $15 multiplied by 0.20.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 15 times 0.20.\n\n15 times 0.20 is 3. So, the discount is $3 per t-shirt.\n\nNow, to find the sale price, I need to subtract the discount from the original price.\n\nSo, $15 minus $3 equals $12.\n\nTherefore, each t-shirt will cost $12 after the 20% discount.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to calculate this? Maybe without calculating the discount amount separately.\n\nYes, I can think of it this way: if the t-shirt is 20% off, that means the customer pays 80% of the original price. Because 100% - 20% = 80%.\n\nSo, 80% of $15 would be the sale price.\n\nLet me calculate that: 80% as a decimal is 0.80.\n\nSo, $15 multiplied by 0.80.\n\n15 times 0.80 is 12.\n\nAgain, I get $12 as the sale price.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign. It looks like $12 is the correct price after the discount.\n\nI think I've got it right, but let me double-check.\n\nOriginal price: $15\n\nDiscount: 20% of $15 is $3\n\nSale price: $15 - $3 = $12\n\nAlternatively, 80% of $15 is $12\n\nYes, both methods confirm the sale price is $12 per t-shirt.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
