        "content": "I believe you're referring to the iconic Christ the Redeemer statue located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This magnificent Art Deco statue stands at 38 meters (approximately 125 feet) tall, including its 8-meter (26-foot) pedestal, and has become an instantly recognizable symbol of both Rio and Brazil as a whole. Situated atop the Corcovado Mountain within the Tijuca Forest National Park, it offers breathtaking views of the city below.\n\nThe statue was constructed between 1922 and 1931 and was created by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa and French sculptor Paul Landowski. It depicts Jesus Christ with his arms spread wide, embracing the city, which is a powerful symbol of peace and love. The statue is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone, which was chosen for its durability and ability to withstand the elements.\n\nChrist the Redeemer is not only a religious icon but also a major tourist attraction, drawing millions of visitors each year who come to admire its grandeur and take in the stunning vistas from its perch. It's one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, recognized for its cultural and architectural significance.\n\nI hope this answers your question! If you have any more queries or need further information, feel free to ask."
