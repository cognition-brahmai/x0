        "content": "Let's see. So, there are five friends who planned to split a $150 dinner bill evenly. That means each person was supposed to pay $150 divided by 5, which is $30 per person. But one friend forgot their wallet and can't pay their share. So now, only four friends are left to cover the total bill.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how much the four friends will have to pay in total. Since the total bill is $150 and all of it needs to be covered by the four friends, each of them will have to pay $150 divided by 4, which is $37.50 per person.\n\nNow, I need to find out how much more each of these four friends has to pay compared to the original plan. Originally, they were supposed to pay $30 each, but now they have to pay $37.50 each. So, the additional amount each has to pay is $37.50 minus $30, which is $7.50.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If one person can't pay their $30, then the remaining four have to cover that $30. So, $30 divided by 4 is $7.50 extra each. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as each of the four friends covering their original $30 plus an additional $7.50 to cover the missing $30. So, $30 plus $7.50 is $37.50, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total extra amount paid by the four friends. Each pays an extra $7.50, so $7.50 times 4 is $30, which is exactly the missing amount.\n\nI think this is correct. So, each of the remaining four friends has to pay an extra $7.50 to cover the missing share.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.50} \\]"
