        "content": "So I have this problem here: I've got a 1000-page book, and I need to place a bookmark on every 50th page starting from page 50. The question is, how many bookmarks will I need in total?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Starting from page 50, every 50th page would be pages like 50, 100, 150, and so on, up to 1000. So, I need to find out how many such pages there are in the book.\n\nOne way to approach this is to think about it as an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 50, the common difference is 50, and the last term is 1000. The general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\n\\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( a_n \\) is the nth term,\n\n- \\( a_1 \\) is the first term,\n\n- \\( d \\) is the common difference,\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of terms.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- \\( a_1 = 50 \\),\n\n- \\( d = 50 \\),\n\n- \\( a_n = 1000 \\).\n\nWe need to find \\( n \\).\n\nPlugging the values into the formula:\n\n\\[ 1000 = 50 + (n-1) \\times 50 \\]\n\nLet's solve for \\( n \\):\n\nFirst, subtract 50 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 1000 - 50 = (n-1) \\times 50 \\]\n\n\\[ 950 = (n-1) \\times 50 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 50:\n\n\\[ \\frac{950}{50} = n - 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 19 = n - 1 \\]\n\nFinally, add 1 to both sides:\n\n\\[ n = 20 \\]\n\nSo, you would need 20 bookmarks in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Since you're placing a bookmark every 50 pages starting at page 50, you can also think of it as dividing the total number of pages minus the starting point by the interval, and then adding one.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nTotal pages = 1000\n\nStarting point = 50\n\nInterval = 50\n\nSo, the number of bookmarks would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{number of bookmarks} = \\frac{1000 - 50}{50} + 1 \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{950}{50} + 1 \\]\n\n\\[ = 19 + 1 \\]\n\n\\[ = 20 \\]\n\nOkay, that matches the previous result. Good, it seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list out the pages where bookmarks are placed: 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000. That's 20 pages.\n\nWait, let's count them quickly:\n\n50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000.\n\nThat's 20 pages indeed.\n\nAlternatively, if you consider that the first bookmark is at page 50, which is the 1st bookmark, and then every 50 pages after that, up to page 1000.\n\nSo, the number of bookmarks is equal to the number of terms in the sequence starting at 50, increasing by 50, up to 1000.\n\nWhich we've already calculated as 20.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the starting page was included or not. In this case, since we're starting at page 50, and including it as the first bookmark, that seems correct.\n\nIf the starting page was page 0 or something, but since it's page 50, which is included, and then every 50 pages after that, up to and including page 1000, 20 bookmarks seem accurate.\n\nSo, the final answer is 20 bookmarks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
