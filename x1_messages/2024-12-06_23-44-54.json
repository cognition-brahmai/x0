        "content": "So I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as x approaches infinity of (1/x). Hmm, let's see. When we talk about limits involving infinity, we're usually looking at what happens to a function as x gets really, really large, beyond any finite bound.\n\nSo, the expression is lim (x\u2192\u221e) (1/x). What does this mean intuitively? Well, as x gets larger and larger, the fraction 1/x gets smaller and smaller. For example, if x is 1, then 1/1 is 1. If x is 10, 1/10 is 0.1. If x is 100, 1/100 is 0.01, and so on. It seems like as x increases, 1/x is approaching 0.\n\nBut let's make this more rigorous. In calculus, the limit of a function f(x) as x approaches infinity is L if for every epsilon > 0, there exists a number N such that for all x > N, the absolute value of f(x) - L is less than epsilon. That's the formal definition.\n\nIn this case, f(x) = 1/x and we think L is 0. So, for any epsilon > 0, we need to find N such that if x > N, then |1/x - 0| < epsilon.\n\nSimplifying, |1/x| < epsilon, which is the same as 1/x < epsilon since x is positive as it approaches infinity.\n\nSo, 1/x < epsilon implies x > 1/epsilon.\n\nTherefore, we can choose N = 1/epsilon.\n\nSo, for any epsilon > 0, if we choose N = 1/epsilon, then for all x > N, |1/x - 0| < epsilon.\n\nThis satisfies the definition of the limit, so indeed, lim (x\u2192\u221e) (1/x) = 0.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the behavior of the function y = 1/x. As x gets larger and larger, y gets closer and closer to 0, but never actually reaches 0. It asymptotically approaches 0.\n\nWe can also consider what happens if x approaches negative infinity. The limit as x approaches negative infinity of 1/x would be 0 from the negative side, because x is negative and 1/x is negative. But in this case, since x approaches positive infinity, y approaches 0 from the positive side.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this limit is fundamental in understanding the concept of horizontal asymptotes in graphing functions. The line y = 0 is a horizontal asymptote for the function y = 1/x.\n\nMoreover, this limit is used in various applications in mathematics and science, such as in determining the convergence of infinite series or in physics when considering quantities that become negligible at very large scales.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the limit as x approaches infinity of 1/x is 0, and we've seen both an intuitive and a rigorous way to understand why that is.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
