        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that sells apples with a discount for bulk purchases. If you buy 10 or more apples, each apple costs $1.20, and if you buy fewer than 10, each apple costs $1.50. We need to find out how many apples we must purchase to save at least $5 with the bulk discount.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to save at least $5 with the bulk discount. That means the difference between the cost of buying fewer than 10 apples and buying 10 or more apples should be at least $5.\n\nLet's denote the number of apples purchased as \\( n \\).\n\nNow, if \\( n < 10 \\), the cost per apple is $1.50.\n\nIf \\( n \\geq 10 \\), the cost per apple is $1.20.\n\nWe need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the cost with the bulk discount is at least $5 less than the cost without the discount.\n\nWait a minute, actually, I need to think differently. Because the bulk discount applies when you buy 10 or more apples, meaning you pay less per apple for larger quantities. So, the savings come from buying more, not less.\n\nLet me rephrase: We need to find the smallest number of apples \\( n \\) such that the total cost with the bulk discount is at least $5 less than what it would have cost without the discount.\n\nBut what is the \"without the discount\" scenario? Is it the cost of buying \\( n \\) apples at the non-discounted price, or is it the cost of buying the same number of apples at the higher price per apple?\n\nI think it's the cost of buying \\( n \\) apples at $1.50 each minus the cost of buying \\( n \\) apples at $1.20 each is at least $5.\n\nSo, the savings \\( S \\) would be:\n\n\\( S = 1.50n - 1.20n \\geq 5 \\)\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\( 0.30n \\geq 5 \\)\n\nNow, solving for \\( n \\):\n\n\\( n \\geq \\frac{5}{0.30} \\)\n\n\\( n \\geq \\frac{500}{30} \\)\n\n\\( n \\geq 16.\\overline{6} \\)\n\nSince we can't buy a fraction of an apple, we need to round up to the next whole number, which is 17.\n\nBut wait, let's verify this.\n\nIf \\( n = 17 \\):\n\nCost without discount: \\( 17 \\times 1.50 = 25.50 \\)\n\nCost with discount: \\( 17 \\times 1.20 = 20.40 \\)\n\nSavings: \\( 25.50 - 20.40 = 5.10 \\), which is at least $5.\n\nIf \\( n = 16 \\):\n\nCost without discount: \\( 16 \\times 1.50 = 24.00 \\)\n\nCost with discount: \\( 16 \\times 1.20 = 19.20 \\)\n\nSavings: \\( 24.00 - 19.20 = 4.80 \\), which is less than $5.\n\nTherefore, purchasing 17 apples allows you to save at least $5 with the bulk discount.\n\nBut let's consider if there's a different way to interpret this problem. Maybe there's a minimum purchase required to get the discount, which is 10 apples, and we need to find how many apples to buy beyond that to save at least $5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"save at least $5 with the bulk discount\" means compared to buying in smaller quantities.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of the difference in total cost when buying in bulk versus buying fewer than 10 apples.\n\nBut the problem says \"to save at least $5 with the bulk discount,\" which I interpret as the savings from buying at the discounted price per apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's compared to buying individual apples at the higher price.\n\nBut in any case, my initial approach seems consistent: find the number of apples where the difference in total cost between the discounted and non-discounted prices is at least $5.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the savings per apple, which is $0.30 per apple when buying at the discounted price.\n\nSo, to save at least $5, you'd need to buy at least \\( \\frac{5}{0.30} = 16.\\overline{6} \\) apples, which rounds up to 17 apples.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTo be thorough, let's check for \\( n = 17 \\):\n\nSavings: \\( 17 \\times 0.30 = 5.10 \\), which is indeed at least $5.\n\nFor \\( n = 16 \\):\n\nSavings: \\( 16 \\times 0.30 = 4.80 \\), which is less than $5.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer \\( n \\) that satisfies the condition is 17.\n\nSo, the answer should be that you must purchase at least 17 apples to save at least $5 with the bulk discount.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]"
