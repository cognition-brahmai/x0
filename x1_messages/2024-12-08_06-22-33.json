        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two trains heading towards each other from Town A and Town B, which are 300 miles apart. The first train is leaving Town A at 60 miles per hour, and the second train is leaving Town B at 90 miles per hour, both starting at the same time. We need to find out when they meet and how far from each town they are at that meeting point.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the concept here. Since both trains are moving towards each other, their speeds will add up relative to each other. So, the combined speed at which they are approaching each other is 60 mph + 90 mph = 150 mph.\n\nNow, the total distance between the two towns is 300 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 300 miles / 150 mph = 2 hours\n\nSo, they will meet after 2 hours.\n\nNext, to find out how far from each town they are when they meet, I can calculate the distance each train has traveled in that time.\n\nFor the train from Town A:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nSo, it's 120 miles from Town A.\n\nFor the train from Town B:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time = 90 mph * 2 hours = 180 miles\n\nSo, it's 180 miles from Town B.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check if these distances make sense. The total distance between the towns is 300 miles, and 120 + 180 = 300 miles. Perfect, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could also calculate the distance from Town A by using the ratio of their speeds. The trains are moving towards each other with speeds of 60 mph and 90 mph, so the ratio of their speeds is 60:90, which simplifies to 2:3.\n\nThis means that the distance will be divided in the ratio of their speeds, but actually, since they're moving towards each other, the distances they cover will be proportional to their speeds.\n\nSo, the distance from Town A to the meeting point would be:\n\n(60 / (60 + 90)) * 300 miles = (60 / 150) * 300 = 0.4 * 300 = 120 miles\n\nAnd from Town B:\n\n(90 / 150) * 300 = 0.6 * 300 = 180 miles\n\nThis matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the time each train has been traveling. Since they meet after 2 hours, the distances are simply their speeds multiplied by that time.\n\nI think that's solid. So, to summarize:\n\nThe trains meet after 2 hours.\n\nAt that time, the train from Town A has traveled 120 miles from Town A.\n\nThe train from Town B has traveled 180 miles from Town B.\n\nAlternatively, the meeting point is 120 miles from Town A and 180 miles from Town B.\n\nI don't see any inconsistencies here. I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe trains meet after \\boxed{2\\text{ hours}}, with the first train being \\boxed{120\\text{ miles}} from Town A and the second train being \\boxed{180\\text{ miles}} from Town B."
