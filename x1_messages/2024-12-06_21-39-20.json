        "content": "Let's see what's going on here. Mr. Brown gave each of his two sons, Sam and Tim, an envelope with $50 before he left for work. So, both Sam and Tim initially have $50 each.\n\nNow, while Mr. Brown is away, Sam decides to spend his money on video games. So, Sam has spent his $50 on video games, which means he no longer has the money; he's used it up.\n\nTim, on the other hand, decides to save his money. So, Tim still has his $50 intact.\n\nBut there's a twist: their sister, Lisa, secretly takes $20 from Tim's envelope and uses it to buy a gift for her friend. So, Tim originally had $50, but Lisa took $20 from him, so now Tim only has $30 left.\n\nLet me summarize the actual situation:\n\n- Sam spent his $50 on video games, so he has no money left.\n\n- Tim originally had $50, but Lisa took $20, so he now has $30 left.\n\n- Lisa took $20 from Tim and used it to buy a gift for her friend.\n\nNow, when Mr. Brown returns home, what does he believe about the money he gave his sons?\n\nWell, Mr. Brown gave each son $50, so he probably expects that each of them still has that money. He doesn't know that Sam spent his money on video games or that Lisa took $20 from Tim.\n\nSo, Mr. Brown believes that Sam has $50 and Tim has $50, totaling $100.\n\nBut in reality, Sam has $0, Tim has $30, and Lisa has spent $20 on a gift, so altogether, there is still $100 ($0 from Sam + $30 from Tim + $20 spent by Lisa + $50 from Mr. Brown, but since Lisa spent the $20, it's no longer in anyone's possession).\n\nWait, no. Let's think about this again. Mr. Brown gave $50 to Sam and $50 to Tim, totaling $100.\n\nSam spent his $50 on video games, so that $50 is now with the video game seller.\n\nTim had $50, but Lisa took $20 from him, so Tim has $30 left.\n\nLisa took $20 and spent it on a gift for her friend, so that $20 is now with the gift seller.\n\nSo, the total money is still $100:\n\n- Video game seller has $50 (from Sam)\n\n- Gift seller has $20 (from Lisa)\n\n- Tim has $30 left.\n\nSo, Mr. Brown gave $100, and it's been distributed as follows:\n\n- Sam spent $50\n\n- Tim has $30\n\n- Lisa spent $20\n\n- Total: $50 + $30 + $20 = $100.\n\nWait, but Mr. Brown doesn't know any of this. He thinks that both Sam and Tim still have their $50 each.\n\nSo, when he returns home, he probably expects to see that Sam and Tim each have their $50.\n\nBut in reality:\n\n- Sam has $0\n\n- Tim has $30\n\n- Lisa has spent $20 elsewhere.\n\nThis could lead to some confusion when Mr. Brown discovers the truth.\n\nLet me think about how this might play out.\n\nWhen Mr. Brown returns home, he might ask his sons about the money he gave them.\n\nHe might say something like, \"Boys, did you save the money I gave you earlier?\"\n\nSam might sheepishly admit that he spent his $50 on video games, which would surprise Mr. Brown, as he thought Sam still had the money.\n\nMeanwhile, Tim might show Mr. Brown his remaining $30, which would also be less than the expected $50.\n\nThen, Mr. Brown might ask what happened to the money.\n\nTim might tell him that Lisa took $20 from his envelope, which Mr. Brown wasn't aware of.\n\nSo, Mr. Brown would learn that:\n\n- Sam spent his $50 on video games\n\n- Tim has only $30 left because Lisa took $20 from him\n\n- Lisa spent the $20 on a gift for her friend\n\nThis would likely lead to a discussion about responsibility with Sam and perhaps a conversation with Lisa about not taking money without permission.\n\nAlternatively, if no one tells Mr. Brown about what happened, he might just notice that Tim has only $30 and Sam has nothing, and wonder what occurred.\n\nIn any case, Mr. Brown's beliefs about the money being intact with his sons are incorrect, as some of it has been spent or taken by Lisa.\n\nThis scenario illustrates how actions behind one's back can lead to unexpected situations and the importance of communication within a family.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Mr. Brown believes that both Sam and Tim still have their \\$50 each, totaling \\$100. However, the actual situation is that Sam has spent his \\$50 on video games, Tim has \\$30 left after Lisa took \\$20 from him, and Lisa has spent that \\$20 on a gift for her friend. Therefore, the total money is still \\$100, but distributed differently: \\$50 with the video game seller, \\$20 with the gift seller, and \\$30 with Tim.}} \\]"
