        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about ratios of fruits in a store. It says that the ratio of apples to oranges is 2:3, and the ratio of oranges to bananas is 4:5. I need to find the ratio of apples to oranges to bananas.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what ratios represent. Ratios compare quantities of different things. Here, apples and oranges are being compared in a 2:3 ratio, which means for every 2 apples, there are 3 oranges. Similarly, oranges and bananas are in a 4:5 ratio, meaning for every 4 oranges, there are 5 bananas.\n\nThe tricky part is that both ratios involve oranges, so I need to find a way to combine these ratios into a single ratio that includes apples, oranges, and bananas.\n\nOne approach is to make the number of oranges in both ratios the same so that I can directly compare apples, oranges, and bananas. Let's see how I can do that.\n\nIn the first ratio, apples to oranges is 2:3. In the second ratio, oranges to bananas is 4:5. I need to find a common multiple for the number of oranges in both ratios.\n\nThe number of oranges in the first ratio is 3, and in the second ratio, it's 4. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 4 is 12. So, I'll adjust both ratios so that the number of oranges is 12.\n\nFirst, let's adjust the apples to oranges ratio (2:3) to have 12 oranges.\n\nTo go from 3 oranges to 12 oranges, I need to multiply both parts of the ratio by 4.\n\nSo, apples:oranges = 2:3 becomes (2*4):(3*4) = 8:12.\n\nNow, let's adjust the oranges to bananas ratio (4:5) to have 12 oranges.\n\nTo go from 4 oranges to 12 oranges, I need to multiply both parts of the ratio by 3.\n\nSo, oranges:bananas = 4:5 becomes (4*3):(5*3) = 12:15.\n\nNow that both ratios have the same number of oranges (12), I can combine them into a single ratio.\n\nSo, apples:oranges:bananas = 8:12:15.\n\nWait a minute, is there a simpler way to express this ratio? Let's check if these numbers have a common factor.\n\n8, 12, and 15. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of these numbers is 1, so the ratio is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of apples to oranges to bananas is 8:12:15.\n\nBut let me double-check this method to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use variables. Let\u2019s assign a variable to the number of oranges since it appears in both ratios.\n\nLet\u2019s say the number of oranges is O.\n\nFrom the first ratio, apples to oranges is 2:3, so apples = (2/3)O.\n\nFrom the second ratio, oranges to bananas is 4:5, so bananas = (5/4)O.\n\nNow, I can express the ratio of apples to oranges to bananas as:\n\n(2/3)O : O : (5/4)O.\n\nTo eliminate fractions, I can multiply each part by 12 (the least common multiple of 3 and 4).\n\nSo, (2/3)O * 12 : O * 12 : (5/4)O * 12 = 8O : 12O : 15O.\n\nThus, the ratio is 8:12:15, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the ratios in terms of fractions.\n\nThe ratio of apples to oranges is 2:3, which is the same as A/O = 2/3.\n\nThe ratio of oranges to bananas is 4:5, which is O/B = 4/5.\n\nI can solve for A and B in terms of O.\n\nFrom A/O = 2/3, A = (2/3)O.\n\nFrom O/B = 4/5, B = (5/4)O.\n\nSo, the ratio A:O:B = (2/3)O : O : (5/4)O.\n\nTo make it easier, multiply each term by 12 (LCM of 3 and 4):\n\n(2/3)*12 : 1*12 : (5/4)*12 = 8 : 12 : 15.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nLet me try another method to confirm.\n\nI can set up the ratios as a chain: apples to oranges to bananas.\n\nGiven A:O = 2:3 and O:B = 4:5, I can write A:O:B by finding a common multiple for O.\n\nAs before, the LCM of 3 and 4 is 12.\n\nSo, A:O = 2:3 becomes 8:12, and O:B = 4:5 becomes 12:15.\n\nTherefore, A:O:B = 8:12:15.\n\nSeems consistent across different methods.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem?\n\nSuppose I assume actual numbers for the fruits based on the ratios.\n\nLet\u2019s say the number of apples is 8, oranges is 12, and bananas is 15.\n\nCheck if these satisfy the given ratios.\n\nApples to oranges: 8:12 = 2:3, which matches the first ratio.\n\nOranges to bananas: 12:15 = 4:5, which matches the second ratio.\n\nPerfect, it works.\n\nAlternatively, if I choose different multiples, say double the quantities:\n\nApples = 16, oranges = 24, bananas = 30.\n\n Ratios remain the same: 16:24:30, which simplifies to 8:12:15.\n\nSo, regardless of the multiple, the simplest form of the ratio is 8:12:15.\n\nI think I've confirmed this answer sufficiently through multiple methods.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of apples to oranges to bananas is 8:12:15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8:12:15} \\]"
