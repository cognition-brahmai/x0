        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a simple bank account system in Python using object-oriented programming. I need to make sure that users can create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance. Sounds straightforward, but I want to make sure I do it right.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to structure this. Since it's object-oriented, I should define a class for the bank account. Let's call it `BankAccount`. Inside this class, I'll need methods for creating an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking the balance.\n\nWait, creating an account\u2014does that mean initializing a new instance of the class? Yeah, probably. So, the constructor (`__init__`) should set up a new account with an initial balance, maybe zero. And maybe I should have a unique account number or something to identify each account.\n\nActually, to make it simple, I can assume that each account has a unique account number, and maybe the user has to provide a name or something when creating the account. But to keep it simple, maybe just account number and initial balance.\n\nLet me sketch out a rough plan:\n\n1. Define the `BankAccount` class.\n\n2. In the `__init__` method, take account number and initial balance as parameters and store them as instance variables.\n\n3. Create a method called `deposit` that takes an amount as a parameter and adds it to the balance.\n\n4. Create a method called `withdraw` that takes an amount as a parameter and subtracts it from the balance, but only if there's enough money.\n\n5. Create a method called `check_balance` that returns the current balance.\n\nAlso, I should think about error handling. For example, if someone tries to withdraw more money than what's in the account, I should handle that gracefully, maybe by printing a message and not allowing the withdrawal.\n\nMaybe I can also add some validation to ensure that deposit and withdrawal amounts are positive numbers.\n\nHmm, and for creating multiple accounts, I need to have some way to manage multiple instances of the `BankAccount` class. Maybe I can have a list to store all the accounts.\n\nWait, but for simplicity, maybe I can just handle one account at a time in this script. Or perhaps have a simple text-based interface where the user can create multiple accounts and switch between them.\n\nLet me think about the user interface. Since it's a simple script, probably a command-line interface where the user can choose options like \"create account\", \"deposit\", \"withdraw\", \"check balance\", and \"exit\".\n\nI can use a loop that keeps displaying a menu and takes input from the user until they choose to exit.\n\nBut then, if they create multiple accounts, I need a way to keep track of which account is currently active. Maybe after creating an account, it becomes the active one, and they can perform operations on it. If they create another one, it becomes the new active one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can list all accounts and let the user select which one to work with.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll go with the first approach: once an account is created, it's the active one, and any operations are performed on it. If another account is created, it becomes the new active one.\n\nLater, if I have time, I can make it more advanced.\n\nAlright, let's start coding.\n\nFirst, define the `BankAccount` class.\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, acc_number, initial_balance):\n        self.acc_number = acc_number\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposited {amount}. New balance: {self.balance}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Deposit amount must be positive.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            if self.balance >= amount:\n                self.balance -= amount\n                print(f\"Withdrew {amount}. New balance: {self.balance}\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Withdrawal amount must be positive.\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        return self.balance\n```\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward. Now, I need to handle the user interface.\n\nI'll use a loop that displays a menu and takes input from the user.\n\nI need to keep track of the active account. Maybe I'll have a variable called `current_account` that holds the current `BankAccount` instance.\n\nHere's a rough idea of the menu:\n\n- 1. Create account\n\n- 2. Deposit\n\n- 3. Withdraw\n\n- 4. Check balance\n\n- 5. Exit\n\nWhen the user chooses \"Create account\", I'll ask for an account number and initial balance, and create a new `BankAccount` instance.\n\nFor \"Deposit\", \"Withdraw\", and \"Check balance\", I'll perform the respective operations on the current account.\n\nI need to make sure that there is a current account before allowing deposits, withdrawals, or balance checks.\n\nLet me think about how to handle the account creation. Should I allow account numbers to be repeated? Probably not, but for simplicity, I'll assume that the user enters unique account numbers manually.\n\nAlternatively, I can generate account numbers automatically, but that might be overkill for this simple script.\n\nWait, to make it even simpler, maybe I can just have one account that persists throughout the script, and the user can't create multiple accounts. That would remove the need to manage multiple accounts.\n\nActually, that's a good idea. It simplifies things a lot.\n\nSo, I'll modify the plan:\n\n- Create one bank account with a fixed account number when the script starts.\n\n- Allow the user to deposit, withdraw, and check balance for this single account.\n\n- No need to create multiple accounts.\n\nThat should be much easier to implement.\n\nAlright, let's adjust the code accordingly.\n\nFirst, define the `BankAccount` class as before.\n\nThen, create a single instance of `BankAccount` with a fixed account number and initial balance, say account number \"12345\" with initial balance 0.\n\nThen, display a menu repeatedly until the user chooses to exit.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the code:\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    # as above\n\ndef main():\n    acc_number = \"12345\"\n    initial_balance = 0\n    account = BankAccount(acc_number, initial_balance)\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBanking Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter deposit amount: \"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter withdrawal amount: \"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            balance = account.check_balance()\n            print(f\"Current balance: {balance}\")\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThat looks pretty good. Now, I need to make sure that the user can't input invalid amounts, like negative numbers, for deposits and withdrawals.\n\nI've already added some basic validation in the `deposit` and `withdraw` methods to handle positive amounts.\n\nBut perhaps I should also validate the user input to ensure that they enter a valid number.\n\nFor example, if the user enters a non-numeric value for the amount, the program will crash.\n\nTo handle that, I can use try-except blocks when converting the input to float.\n\nLet me add that.\n\nHere's the updated `main` function:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    acc_number = \"12345\"\n    initial_balance = 0\n    account = BankAccount(acc_number, initial_balance)\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBanking Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            try:\n                amount = float(input(\"Enter deposit amount: \"))\n                if amount > 0:\n                    account.deposit(amount)\n                else:\n                    print(\"Deposit amount must be positive.\")\n            except ValueError:\n                print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            try:\n                amount = float(input(\"Enter withdrawal amount: \"))\n                if amount > 0:\n                    account.withdraw(amount)\n                else:\n                    print(\"Withdrawal amount must be positive.\")\n            except ValueError:\n                print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            balance = account.check_balance()\n            print(f\"Current balance: {balance}\")\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nOkay, that should handle invalid inputs more gracefully.\n\nLet me test this in my mind.\n\nSuppose the user chooses \"1\" to deposit, and enters \"100\". The deposit method should add 100 to the balance and print the new balance.\n\nIf they choose \"2\" to withdraw, and enter \"50\", it should subtract 50 from the balance, provided the balance is sufficient.\n\nChoosing \"3\" should just display the current balance.\n\nAnd \"4\" exits the program.\n\nIf they enter something else, like \"abc\", it should tell them it's an invalid choice.\n\nAlso, if they try to deposit or withdraw a negative amount, it should tell them that the amount must be positive.\n\nAnd if they enter a non-numeric value for amount, it should catch the ValueError and display an error message.\n\nSeems solid.\n\nMaybe I can add a feature to display the account number when checking the balance, just for reference.\n\nLet me modify the `check_balance` method to also print the account number.\n\nHere's the updated method:\n\n```python\ndef check_balance(self):\n    print(f\"Account number: {self.acc_number}\")\n    print(f\"Current balance: {self.balance}\")\n```\n\nBut actually, since it's a single account, maybe it's not necessary. But it's good practice, so I'll keep it.\n\nAlternatively, I can print the account number at the start of each operation to remind the user which account they're using.\n\nBut since there's only one account, it might be redundant.\n\nAlright, I think this is sufficient for a simple bank account system.\n\nIf I had more time, I could add features like multiple accounts, saving account data to a file, or even a GUI interface.\n\nBut for now, this should meet the requirements.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple bank account system in Python using object-oriented programming, follow the steps below. This system allows users to create an account, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Class Definition**: Define a `BankAccount` class with methods to handle deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking.\n2. **User Interface**: Implement a command-line interface using a loop to display options and perform actions based on user input.\n3. **Error Handling**: Ensure that operations like deposit and withdrawal handle invalid amounts gracefully.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, acc_number, initial_balance):\n        self.acc_number = acc_number\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposited {amount}. New balance: {self.balance}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Deposit amount must be positive.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            if self.balance >= amount:\n                self.balance -= amount\n                print(f\"Withdrew {amount}. New balance: {self.balance}\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Withdrawal amount must be positive.\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        print(f\"Account number: {self.acc_number}\")\n        print(f\"Current balance: {self.balance}\")\n\ndef main():\n    acc_number = \"12345\"\n    initial_balance = 0\n    account = BankAccount(acc_number, initial_balance)\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBanking Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            try:\n                amount = float(input(\"Enter deposit amount: \"))\n                if amount > 0:\n                    account.deposit(amount)\n                else:\n                    print(\"Deposit amount must be positive.\")\n            except ValueError:\n                print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            try:\n                amount = float(input(\"Enter withdrawal amount: \"))\n                if amount > 0:\n                    account.withdraw(amount)\n                else:\n                    print(\"Withdrawal amount must be positive.\")\n            except ValueError:\n                print(\"Invalid input.

Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **BankAccount Class**:\n   - **__init__**: Initializes the account with a account number and balance.\n   - **deposit**: Adds a specified amount to the balance if the amount is positive.\n   - **withdraw**: Subtracts a specified amount from the balance if sufficient funds and the amount is positive.\n   - **check_balance**: Prints the account number and current balance.\n\n2. **Main Function**:\n   - Creates a `BankAccount` instance with a fixed account number and zero initial balance.\n   - Presents a menu to the user and performs actions based on their choice using a loop.\n   - Handles invalid inputs and ensures that only valid numerical amounts are processed for deposits and withdrawals.\n\nThis simple bank account system provides basic functionality in a user-friendly manner, ensuring that operations are performed correctly and errors are managed gracefully."
