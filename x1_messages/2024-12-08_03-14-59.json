        "content": "So there's this problem here: In a room, there are 5 cats. Each cat catches 4 mice in an hour. After catching the mice, each mouse takes 3 minutes to be eaten by the cat that caught it. The question is, how long does it take for all the mice to be eaten?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, we have 5 cats, and each cat catches 4 mice in an hour. So, in total, the number of mice caught is 5 cats times 4 mice per cat, which is 20 mice.\n\nNow, each mouse takes 3 minutes to be eaten by the cat that caught it. The question is asking for the total time it takes for all the mice to be eaten.\n\nAt first glance, you might think that since there are 20 mice and each takes 3 minutes to be eaten, the total time would be 20 times 3 minutes, which is 60 minutes. But that doesn't seem right because the cats are eating the mice simultaneously, not one after the other.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If all the cats catch their mice at the same time and start eating immediately, then the time it takes for all the mice to be eaten would be the time it takes for one mouse to be eaten, which is 3 minutes. Because all the cats are eating their mice at the same time.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that each cat catches 4 mice in an hour. Does that mean that each cat catches one mouse every 15 minutes, since 60 minutes divided by 4 mice is 15 minutes per mouse?\n\nIf that's the case, then the cats are catching mice at different times throughout the hour, not all at once.\n\nSo, let's consider that each cat is catching mice at a rate of one every 15 minutes. And immediately upon catching a mouse, the cat starts eating it, which takes 3 minutes.\n\nSo, for each cat, the process would be:\n\n- Catch mouse 1 at time 0 minutes, eat it by time 3 minutes.\n\n- Catch mouse 2 at time 15 minutes, eat it by time 18 minutes.\n\n- Catch mouse 3 at time 30 minutes, eat it by time 33 minutes.\n\n- Catch mouse 4 at time 45 minutes, eat it by time 48 minutes.\n\nSo, for each cat, the last mouse is eaten by time 48 minutes.\n\nBut since there are 5 cats, we need to consider the maximum time across all cats.\n\nWait, but all cats are doing the same thing simultaneously. So, for all cats, the last mouse is eaten at time 48 minutes.\n\nBut let me double-check this.\n\nCat 1:\n\n- Mouse 1: caught at 0, eaten by 3 min.\n\n- Mouse 2: caught at 15, eaten by 18 min.\n\n- Mouse 3: caught at 30, eaten by 33 min.\n\n- Mouse 4: caught at 45, eaten by 48 min.\n\nSame for Cat 2, Cat 3, Cat 4, and Cat 5.\n\nSo, the last mouse for each cat is eaten by 48 minutes. Since all cats are doing this in parallel, the total time for all mice to be eaten is 48 minutes.\n\nWait, but the cats are catching mice throughout the hour, and eating them immediately. So, by the end of 48 minutes, all mice have been eaten.\n\nBut the problem says \"after catching the mice, each mouse takes 3 minutes to be eaten.\" Does that mean that each cat catches all its mice first and then eats them, or does it catch one, eat it, catch another, eat it, and so on?\n\nFrom the way it's phrased, it seems that each cat catches a mouse and then eats it immediately, and repeats this process every 15 minutes.\n\nSo, in that case, the last mouse is caught at 45 minutes and eaten by 48 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the total time is 48 minutes.\n\nBut let me consider if there's another way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all cats catch all their mice at once, and then all start eating simultaneously.\n\nBut the problem says \"each cat catches 4 mice in an hour.\" It doesn't specify if they catch them all at once or at different times.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the most straightforward interpretation is that each cat catches 4 mice in an hour, meaning the catching process is spread out over the hour.\n\nAnd immediately upon catching a mouse, the cat starts eating it, which takes 3 minutes.\n\nSo, for each cat, the sequence is:\n\n- Catch mouse at time t, eat it by time t + 3 minutes.\n\n- Repeat every 15 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the last mouse is caught at 45 minutes and eaten by 48 minutes.\n\nHence, the total time is 48 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if the cats catch all mice at once and then eat them, it would be different.\n\nBut based on the phrasing, it seems more accurate to assume that each cat catches mice at regular intervals and eats them immediately.\n\nSo, my final answer is 48 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
