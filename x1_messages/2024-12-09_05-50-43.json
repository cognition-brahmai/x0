        "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you calculate the area of a rectangle step by step. So, the rectangle has a length of 12 meters and a width of 8 meters. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to recall the formula for the area of a rectangle. The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}\n\\]\n\nSo, in this case, the length is 12 meters and the width is 8 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 12 \\, \\text{meters} \\times 8 \\, \\text{meters}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's perform the multiplication. Multiplying 12 by 8:\n\n\\[\n12 \\times 8 = 96\n\\]\n\nSo, the area is 96 square meters. It's important to remember that when we multiply units of length together, we get area, which is measured in square units. In this case, since we're dealing with meters, the area is in square meters (m\u00b2).\n\nTo summarize, the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. For a rectangle that is 12 meters long and 8 meters wide, the area is 96 square meters.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"
