        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with 10 red balls, 20 green balls, and 30 blue balls. So, in total, there are 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 balls. I need to find the probability that when I pick two balls without replacement, both of them are either red or green.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"either red or green\" means in this context. It means that both balls should not be blue; they can be either red or green, but not blue. So, essentially, I'm looking for the probability that both balls are from the red and green balls only.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. There are a few ways to calculate probabilities in situations like this. One way is to calculate the probability directly by considering the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 60 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. Here, n = 60 and k = 2.\n\nSo, total number of ways to pick 2 balls from 60 is C(60, 2).\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to pick 2 balls that are either both red or both green or one red and one green.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says \"both balls are either red or green.\" Does that mean both balls are red, both are green, or one is red and one is green? The phrase \"either red or green\" could be interpreted in different ways.\n\nLet me look back at the problem: \"both balls are either red or green.\" This likely means that both balls are not blue; they can be both red, both green, or one red and one green.\n\nAlternatively, another interpretation could be that both balls are red or both are green, but not one of each.\n\nI need to make sure I understand the language correctly. The phrase \"both balls are either red or green\" might mean that both balls are in the set of red and green balls, meaning neither of them is blue.\n\nGiven that, it would include the possibilities of both red, both green, or one red and one green, as long as neither is blue.\n\nTo avoid confusion, maybe I should think of it as both balls are not blue.\n\nSo, the probability that both balls are not blue would be the same as 1 minus the probability that at least one ball is blue.\n\nBut wait, the problem specifically says \"both balls are either red or green,\" which implies that both balls are either red or green, meaning no blue balls are picked.\n\nSo, perhaps the best way is to calculate the probability that neither of the two balls picked is blue.\n\nThat is, both balls are from the red and green balls only.\n\nSo, there are 10 red and 20 green balls, making a total of 30 balls that are either red or green.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to pick 2 balls that are both red or green is C(30, 2).\n\nAnd the total number of ways to pick any 2 balls from the 60 is C(60, 2).\n\nTherefore, the probability is C(30, 2) / C(60, 2).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, C(30, 2) = 30! / (2!(30 - 2)!) = (30 \u00d7 29) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 435.\n\nSimilarly, C(60, 2) = 60! / (2!(60 - 2)!) = (60 \u00d7 59) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 1770.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 435 / 1770.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction.\n\nBoth numerator and denominator are divisible by 15.\n\n435 \u00f7 15 = 29\n\n1770 \u00f7 15 = 118\n\nSo, 29/118.\n\nThat can be simplified further. Both 29 and 118 are divisible by 29.\n\n29 \u00f7 29 = 1\n\n118 \u00f7 29 = 4\n\nSo, the simplified probability is 1/4.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider another approach to verify this result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of sequential probabilities.\n\nThe probability that the first ball picked is not blue (i.e., it's red or green) is 30/60 = 1/2.\n\nGiven that the first ball is not blue, there are now 29 non-blue balls left out of the remaining 59 balls.\n\nSo, the probability that the second ball is also not blue is 29/59.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are not blue is (1/2) \u00d7 (29/59) = 29/118.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. But earlier I simplified 29/118 to 1/4, but 29 is a prime number and doesn't divide evenly into 118 to give 4.\n\nWait, 29 \u00d7 4 = 116, which is less than 118, so 29 doesn't divide into 118 evenly. So, 29/118 is already simplified.\n\nBut earlier, I thought 29/118 is 1/4, but that's not accurate.\n\nWait, 29/116 would be 1/4, but 29/118 is slightly less than that.\n\nSo, perhaps I made a mistake in simplifying the fraction earlier.\n\nLet me check:\n\n435 / 1770\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 15:\n\n435 \u00f7 15 = 29\n\n1770 \u00f7 15 = 118\n\nSo, 29/118.\n\nNow, 29 is a prime number, so it only divides by 1 and 29.\n\n118 divided by 29 is approximately 4.069, which is not an integer.\n\nTherefore, 29/118 is already in its simplest form and cannot be reduced to 1/4.\n\nSo, the correct probability is 29/118.\n\nAlternatively, expressing it in decimal form might make more sense.\n\n29 divided by 118 is approximately 0.2458, or about 24.58%.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the answer in fraction form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nLet me consider the number of ways to pick two red or two green or one red and one green.\n\nSo, the number of ways to pick two red balls is C(10, 2) = (10 \u00d7 9)/2 = 45.\n\nThe number of ways to pick two green balls is C(20, 2) = (20 \u00d7 19)/2 = 190.\n\nThe number of ways to pick one red and one green is 10 \u00d7 20 = 200.\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 45 + 190 + 200 = 435.\n\nAnd, as calculated earlier, the total number of ways to pick any two balls is C(60, 2) = 1770.\n\nSo, again, the probability is 435 / 1770 = 29/118.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are either red or green is 29/118.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of conditional probability.\n\nThe probability that the first ball is not blue is 30/60 = 1/2.\n\nGiven that the first ball is not blue, the probability that the second ball is also not blue is 29/59.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are not blue is (1/2) \u00d7 (29/59) = 29/118.\n\nThis matches our previous calculation.\n\nSo, it seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 29/118.\n\nAlternatively, we can check if this fraction can be simplified further.\n\nAs 29 is a prime number and does not divide 118 evenly, 29/118 is the simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 29/118.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{29}{118}} \\]"
