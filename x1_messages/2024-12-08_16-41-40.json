        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: In an election, Candidate A received 55% of the votes, and Candidate B received the remaining 45%. There were a total of 12,000 votes cast. I need to find out how many more votes Candidate A received than Candidate B.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. I know that Candidate A has 55% of the total votes, and Candidate B has 45%. The total votes are 12,000. So, I need to find the difference between the votes received by Candidate A and Candidate B.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to calculate the number of votes each candidate received and then subtract the smaller number from the larger one to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by calculating the votes for Candidate A. Since Candidate A received 55% of the total votes, I can find that by multiplying 55% by 12,000.\n\nBut wait, percentages are out of 100, right? So, 55% is the same as 55/100 or 0.55 in decimal form. So, votes for Candidate A would be 0.55 times 12,000.\n\nLet me do that calculation:\n\n0.55 \u00d7 12,000 = ...\n\nWell, 0.55 times 10,000 is 5,500, and 0.55 times 2,000 is 1,100. So, adding those up, 5,500 + 1,100 equals 6,600 votes for Candidate A.\n\nNow, for Candidate B, who received 45% of the votes. Similarly, 45% is 0.45 in decimal form. So, votes for Candidate B would be 0.45 times 12,000.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n0.45 \u00d7 12,000 = ...\n\nSimilarly, 0.45 times 10,000 is 4,500, and 0.45 times 2,000 is 900. Adding those up, 4,500 + 900 equals 5,400 votes for Candidate B.\n\nNow, to find out how many more votes Candidate A received than Candidate B, I need to subtract the votes for Candidate B from the votes for Candidate A.\n\nSo, 6,600 minus 5,400 equals 1,200 votes.\n\nTherefore, Candidate A received 1,200 more votes than Candidate B.\n\nWait a minute, is there a shorter way to do this? I feel like I might have done more steps than necessary.\n\nLet me think. The difference between 55% and 45% is 10%. So, the difference in votes is 10% of the total votes.\n\nSo, 10% of 12,000 is equal to 0.10 times 12,000, which is 1,200 votes.\n\nOh, that's a quicker way! I should remember that for future problems. So, whenever I need to find the difference in votes based on percentage, I can just find the difference in percentages and then calculate that percentage of the total votes.\n\nThat saves time, especially in exams or when dealing with larger numbers.\n\nAlright, I think that's the answer. Candidate A received 1,200 more votes than Candidate B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1200} \\]"
