        "content": "Let's see. If you read 30 pages every day, and you want to know how many pages you'll have read after two weeks, I need to figure out how many days are in two weeks first.\n\nI know that one week has 7 days, so two weeks would have 7 times 2, which is 14 days.\n\nNow, if you read 30 pages each day for 14 days, I can find the total number of pages by multiplying the number of pages per day by the number of days.\n\nSo, that's 30 pages/day times 14 days.\n\nLet me do the multiplication: 30 times 14.\n\nI can break it down if it helps. 30 times 10 is 300, and 30 times 4 is 120. Then, 300 plus 120 is 420.\n\nTherefore, you would have read 420 pages after two weeks.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to think about it? Maybe using addition instead of multiplication to check if it's the same.\n\nIf you read 30 pages each day for 14 days, adding 30 fourteen times should give the same result.\n\nLet me try adding 30 a few times: 30 + 30 is 60, plus another 30 is 90, and so on.\n\nBut that would take a while for 14 days. It's probably faster to use multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in weeks. Since one week has 7 days, and you read 30 pages each day, in one week you read 30 times 7, which is 210 pages.\n\nThen, for two weeks, it would be 210 pages times 2, which is also 420 pages.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident it's correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the total number of pages read.\n\nFor example, maybe some days you read more or less, but based on the question, you read a consistent 30 pages every day.\n\nAlso, the book might have fewer pages than 420, but the question is about how many pages you would have read, not whether the book has that many pages.\n\nSo, assuming you read 30 pages every day for two weeks, the total is 420 pages.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{420} \\]"
