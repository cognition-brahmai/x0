The code of chivalry was influenced by Christian values, as well as by the military orders that emerged during the Crusades.\n\nThe code of conduct for knights included virtues such as courage, loyalty, generosity, and humility.

It helped to establish a code of behavior for knights and other members of the nobility, promoting a sense of honor and respect for others. It also played a role in shaping the ideals of courtly love, which emphasized romantic relationships between knights and ladies.\n\nOverall, chivalry was an important aspect of medieval culture and had a lasting impact on Western society. Its ideals continue to be admired and emulated today, even if the concept of knighthood itself is no longer relevant."
