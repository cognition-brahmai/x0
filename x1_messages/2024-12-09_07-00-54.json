It's the eighth planet from the Sun and it's known for its beautiful blue color, which is due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere. Just like how Earth is called the \"Blue Planet\" because of its oceans, Neptune is often referred to as the \"Blue Giant.\" It's fascinating how these planets get their names and characteristics!"
