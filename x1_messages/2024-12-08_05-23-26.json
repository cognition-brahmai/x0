        "content": "So I have this problem here about students playing basketball and soccer. Let me see if I can figure this out. There are 30 students in total. 12 play basketball, 15 play soccer, and 9 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nHmm, okay. I think I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. You know, where you add the number of students playing basketball and soccer, but since the students playing both are counted in both groups, I need to subtract them once to get the total number of students playing at least one sport.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nNumber of students playing basketball = 12\n\nNumber of students playing soccer = 15\n\nNumber of students playing both = 9\n\nFirst, I'll add the number of students playing basketball and soccer: 12 + 15 = 27\n\nBut since 9 students are playing both, they've been counted twice, so I need to subtract them once: 27 - 9 = 18\n\nSo, 18 students play at least one of the two sports.\n\nNow, to find out how many students don't play either sport, I'll subtract the number of students playing at least one sport from the total number of students: 30 - 18 = 12\n\nTherefore, 12 students don't play either basketball or soccer.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nTotal students = 30\n\nBasketball players = 12\n\nSoccer players = 15\n\nBoth = 9\n\nSo, only basketball = 12 - 9 = 3\n\nOnly soccer = 15 - 9 = 6\n\nBoth = 9\n\nTotal playing at least one sport = 3 + 6 + 9 = 18\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, students not playing either sport = 30 - 18 = 12\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
