The melting of polar ice caps is a real concern due to climate change, and it does contribute to rising sea levels. However, whether this will lead to a global flood depends on various factors, including the rate of melting, how societies adapt to rising seas, and potential mitigation measures taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It's important to note that while sea levels are rising, it's unlikely to result in a sudden, catastrophic flood covering the entire globe. Instead, it poses risks such as increased coastal erosion, more frequent flooding, and the potential displacement of coastal communities over time. The impact can be managed through proactive planning and environmental conservation efforts."
