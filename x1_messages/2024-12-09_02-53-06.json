There was a significant fire in London in 1666, known as the Great Fire of London, not in Rome in 1677. The Great Fire of London occurred from September 2 to September 5, 1666, and while it destroyed a large part of the city, including St. Paul's Cathedral and many parish churches, it is believed that remarkably few lives were lost, though the exact number is not definitively known.\n\nAs for the Great Fire of Rome, there have been several major fires in Rome's history, but none that I'm aware of in 1677. One of the most famous is the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64 during the reign of Emperor Nero. That fire devastated much of the city and led to various consequences, including persecutions.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, please let me know.\n"
