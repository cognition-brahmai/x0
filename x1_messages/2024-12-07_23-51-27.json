        "content": "So the restaurant has 15 tables, and each table can seat 4 people. Now, if only half of the tables are occupied, how many people can the restaurant accommodate?\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many tables are occupied. Since half of the 15 tables are occupied, that would be 15 divided by 2. But 15 divided by 2 is 7.5. Hmm, you can't have half a table, can you? Maybe they have some tables that are shared or something, but I'll assume that they have 7 tables occupied, since you can't really have half a table.\n\nSo, if 7 tables are occupied, and each table seats 4 people, then the number of people accommodated would be 7 times 4, which is 28 people.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"how many people can the restaurant accommodate if half of the tables are occupied.\" But if half the tables are occupied, that means the restaurant is only using half its seating capacity. So, in that case, the restaurant can accommodate 28 people when half the tables are occupied.\n\nBut maybe I should consider that maybe they can accommodate more if some tables are combined or something, but according to the information given, each table seats 4 people, and half of the tables are occupied.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the total capacity if only half the tables are in use, but that doesn't make much sense because if half the tables are occupied, that should correspond to half the seating capacity.\n\nWait, maybe I need to calculate the total seating capacity first and then find half of that.\n\nTotal seating capacity is 15 tables times 4 people per table, which is 60 people.\n\nIf half of the tables are occupied, that means half of the seating capacity is being used, which would be 30 people.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated 7 tables times 4 people equals 28 people, but that's if exactly half the tables are occupied.\n\nBut 15 divided by 2 is 7.5, so perhaps they have 7 tables fully occupied and one table half occupied, but the question doesn't specify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the restaurant can only accommodate 28 people if 7 tables are occupied, but the question is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each table can seat 4 people, and if half the tables are occupied, that means 7.5 tables are occupied. But since you can't have half a table, maybe they allow some tables to be shared or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects me to round down to 7 tables, so 7 times 4 is 28 people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they consider 7.5 tables as 7 tables fully occupied and one table with 2 people, making it 7 times 4 plus 2, which is 30 people.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify how the half table is handled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects me to calculate half of the total seating capacity.\n\nTotal seating capacity is 15 tables times 4 people, which is 60 people.\n\nHalf of that would be 30 people.\n\nSo, perhaps the restaurant can accommodate 30 people if half of the tables are occupied.\n\nBut earlier, calculating based on the number of tables, I got 28 people, which is close to 30.\n\nMaybe there's some confusion here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question means that half of the tables are in use, but each table can seat 4 people, and all seats are filled in the occupied tables.\n\nSo, if 7.5 tables are occupied, and each table seats 4 people, then the number of people would be 7.5 times 4, which is 30 people.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is 30 people.\n\nAlternatively, since you can't have half a table, maybe they have 7 tables fully occupied, seating 28 people, and the remaining 8 tables are unoccupied.\n\nBut the question says \"half of the tables are occupied,\" which would be 7.5 tables, but since you can't have half a table, perhaps they have 7 tables occupied and 8 unoccupied, accommodating 28 people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have 7 tables fully occupied and one table with 2 people, making it 30 people in total.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify how the half table is handled.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to calculate half of the total seating capacity.\n\nTotal seating capacity is 15 tables times 4 people, which is 60 people.\n\nHalf of that is 30 people.\n\nTherefore, the restaurant can accommodate 30 people if half of the tables are occupied.\n\nSo, the answer is 30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
