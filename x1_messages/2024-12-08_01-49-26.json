        "content": "Ah, limoncello! That deliciously refreshing Italian liqueur that's perfect for sipping on a warm summer evening. Now, to answer your question about which fruit is used to make traditional limoncello, I believe it's lemons. Yes, specifically, it's made from lemons. The bright, zesty flavor of lemons is what gives limoncello its distinctive taste. I've had it before, and it's absolutely delightful. It's interesting how something so simple can be so delicious. I wonder if there are any variations that use different citrus fruits? Maybe limes or oranges? Although, I think those would taste quite different. Perhaps I should try making some at home someday. Do you have any experience with making limoncello?"
