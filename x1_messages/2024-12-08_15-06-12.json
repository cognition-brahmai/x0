        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that sells 5 different types of candy, each with a different price per pound: $4, $6, $8, $10, and $12. The store sells an equal amount of each type in a month, and the total revenue from these sales is $9,600. We need to find out how many pounds of each type of candy were sold.\n\nFirst, since the store sells an equal amount of each type of candy, let's denote the amount sold of each type as \\( x \\) pounds. Because there are 5 types of candy, the total amount sold in pounds is \\( 5x \\).\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total revenue. The revenue from each type of candy is the price per pound multiplied by the number of pounds sold. So, for each type:\n\n- Revenue from $4 candy: \\( 4x \\)\n\n- Revenue from $6 candy: \\( 6x \\)\n\n- Revenue from $8 candy: \\( 8x \\)\n\n- Revenue from $10 candy: \\( 10x \\)\n\n- Revenue from $12 candy: \\( 12x \\)\n\nThe total revenue is the sum of these individual revenues:\n\n\\[\n4x + 6x + 8x + 10x + 12x = 9,600\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[\n(4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12)x = 9,600\n\\]\n\nAdding up the coefficients:\n\n\\[\n4 + 6 = 10\\]\n\n\\[\n10 + 8 = 18\\]\n\n\\[\n18 + 10 = 28\\]\n\n\\[\n28 + 12 = 40\\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[\n40x = 9,600\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 40:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{9,600}{40}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the division:\n\n\\[\n9,600 \\div 40 = 240\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the store sold 240 pounds of each type of candy.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a simpler way to approach this. Let's think about the average price per pound.\n\nThe prices are $4, $6, $8, $10, and $12. Since the store sells an equal amount of each, the average price per pound is the average of these prices.\n\nThe average is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{average price} = \\frac{4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12}{5} = \\frac{40}{5} = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, the average price per pound is $8.\n\nNow, if the total revenue is $9,600 and the average price per pound is $8, then the total pounds sold is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{total pounds} = \\frac{9,600}{8} = 1,200 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nSince this is the total for all types combined, and there are 5 types, each type accounts for:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1,200}{5} = 240 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nOkay, this matches my earlier calculation. So, the store sold 240 pounds of each type of candy.\n\nLet me verify this by calculating the total revenue based on this amount.\n\nRevenue from $4 candy: \\( 4 \\times 240 = 960 \\)\n\nRevenue from $6 candy: \\( 6 \\times 240 = 1,440 \\)\n\nRevenue from $8 candy: \\( 8 \\times 240 = 1,920 \\)\n\nRevenue from $10 candy: \\( 10 \\times 240 = 2,400 \\)\n\nRevenue from $12 candy: \\( 12 \\times 240 = 2,880 \\)\n\nAdding these up:\n\n\\[\n960 + 1,440 = 2,400\\]\n\n\\[\n2,400 + 1,920 = 4,320\\]\n\n\\[\n4,320 + 2,400 = 6,720\\]\n\n\\[\n6,720 + 2,880 = 9,600\n\\]\n\nPerfect, it adds up to $9,600, which matches the given total revenue.\n\nAlternatively, since each type contributes equally in pounds, and their prices are different, another way to look at it is that the total revenue is the sum of the revenues from each type, which we've already calculated.\n\nI think this is solid. So, the answer is that the store sold 240 pounds of each type of candy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
