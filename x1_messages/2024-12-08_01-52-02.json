        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are 40 students in a class. 75% passed their math exam, and 60% passed their science exam. But here's the twist: every student who passed their science exam also passed their math exam. I need to find out what percentage of the class passed both exams.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I need to find the percentage of students who passed both exams. But since everyone who passed science also passed math, that means that the group who passed both is the same as the group who passed science.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. If everyone who passed science also passed math, that means that passing science implies passing math. So, the set of students who passed science is a subset of those who passed math.\n\nSo, the students who passed both exams are exactly those who passed science, because passing science requires passing math.\n\nBut, the question is asking for the percentage who passed both exams.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can directly use the percentage who passed science as the percentage who passed both.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let M be the set of students who passed math.\n\n- Let S be the set of students who passed science.\n\nGiven that every student who passed science also passed math, that means S is a subset of M.\n\nI need to find the percentage of students who passed both, which is the intersection of M and S,\u5373 M \u2229 S.\n\nSince S is a subset of M, M \u2229 S is equal to S.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who passed both is equal to the number who passed science.\n\nSo, the percentage who passed both is the same as the percentage who passed science, which is 60%.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with actual numbers to make sure.\n\nTotal students: 40.\n\n75% passed math: 0.75 \u00d7 40 = 30 students.\n\n60% passed science: 0.60 \u00d7 40 = 24 students.\n\nAnd since everyone who passed science also passed math, those 24 students are included in the 30 who passed math.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who passed both is 24.\n\nTo find the percentage of the class that passed both, it's (24 / 40) \u00d7 100% = 60%.\n\nSo, the percentage of the class that passed both exams is 60%.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose there are students who passed math but not science.\n\nFrom the numbers: 30 passed math, 24 passed both (which is the same as passed science), so the number who passed only math is 30 - 24 = 6 students.\n\nSo, total:\n\n- Passed both: 24 students.\n\n- Passed only math: 6 students.\n\n- Passed neither: 40 - (24 + 6) = 10 students.\n\nBut the question only asks for the percentage who passed both, which is 24 out of 40, which is indeed 60%.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for two sets, the number who passed either math or science is:\n\n|M \u222a S| = |M| + |S| - |M \u2229 S|.\n\nBut since S is a subset of M, |M \u2229 S| = |S|, so |M \u222a S| = |M| + |S| - |S| = |M|.\n\nWhich makes sense because S is entirely contained in M.\n\nBut again, that's not directly needed to answer this question.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the percentage of the class that passed both exams is 60%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60\\%} \\]"
