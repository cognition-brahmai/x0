        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. I need to find the probability of drawing four cards at random from a standard deck of 52 playing cards, without replacement, and ending up with exactly two red cards and two black cards. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that a standard deck has 52 cards: 26 red and 26 black. The cards are drawn without replacement, which means once a card is drawn, it's not put back into the deck.\n\nI need to find the probability of getting exactly two red and two black cards in four draws. Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the total number of possible ways to draw four cards from 52 is the combination of 52 cards taken 4 at a time. That's denoted as C(52, 4). The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\nSimilarly, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose two red cards from 26 red cards and two black cards from 26 black cards. That would be C(26, 2) for the red cards and C(26, 2) for the black cards. Since these are independent choices, I can multiply them together to get the total number of favorable outcomes.\n\nSo, the probability P should be:\n\nP = [C(26, 2) * C(26, 2)] / C(52, 4)\n\nLet me calculate each part step by step.\n\nFirst, C(26, 2):\n\nC(26, 2) = 26! / (2!(26 - 2)!) = (26*25)/ (2*1) = (650)/2 = 325\n\nSo, C(26, 2) = 325 for both red and black cards.\n\nNow, C(52, 4):\n\nC(52, 4) = 52! / (4!(52 - 4)!) = (52*51*50*49)/ (4*3*2*1) = (52*51*50*49)/24\n\nLet me calculate the numerator:\n\n52 * 51 = 2652\n\n2652 * 50 = 132,600\n\n132,600 * 49 = 6,500,400\n\nNow, divide by 24:\n\n6,500,400 / 24 = 270,850\n\nSo, C(52, 4) = 270,850\n\nNow, the numerator is C(26, 2) * C(26, 2) = 325 * 325 = 105,625\n\nTherefore, P = 105,625 / 270,850\n\nLet's simplify this fraction.\n\nFirst, check if both numerator and denominator can be divided by 25.\n\n105,625 / 25 = 4,225\n\n270,850 / 25 = 10,834\n\nSo, P = 4,225 / 10,834\n\nCheck if this can be simplified further. Let's see if 4,225 and 10,834 have any common factors.\n\n4,225 divided by 5 is 845, and 845 divided by 5 is 169, which is 13 squared. So, 4,225 = 5^2 * 13^2\n\n10,834 divided by 2 is 5,417, which is a prime number. So, 10,834 = 2 * 5,417\n\nSince there are no common factors between 4,225 and 10,834, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 4,225 / 10,834.\n\nAlternatively, we can express this as a decimal.\n\n4,225 \u00f7 10,834 \u2248 0.3892\n\nTo express it as a percentage, multiply by 100: approximately 38.92%\n\nSo, the probability of drawing exactly two red and two black cards in four draws without replacement is about 38.92%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, C(26, 2) = 325, that seems correct.\n\nC(52, 4) = 270,725, actually, let me verify that again.\n\n52*51*50*49 = 52*51 = 2,652\n\n2,652*50 = 132,600\n\n132,600*49 = 6,500,400\n\nNow, divide by 4! = 24.\n\n6,500,400 / 24 = 270,850\n\nWait, actually, 6,500,400 \u00f7 24:\n\n24 * 270,850 = 6,500,400\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNumerator: 325 * 325 = 105,625\n\nSo, P = 105,625 / 270,850\n\nSimplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 25:\n\n105,625 \u00f7 25 = 4,225\n\n270,850 \u00f7 25 = 10,834\n\nNow, check if 4,225 and 10,834 have any common factors.\n\n4,225: divisible by 5, 5*845, 845 is 5*169, 169 is 13*13. So, 4,225 = 5^2 * 13^2\n\n10,834: divisible by 2, 2*5,417, and 5,417 is a prime number.\n\nNo common factors, so the fraction is correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 4,225 / 10,834, or approximately 38.92%.\n\nAlternatively, we can rationalize it further if needed, but this seems accurate.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 38.92%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4225}{10834} \\approx 0.3892} \\]"
