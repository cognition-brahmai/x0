        "content": "Let's see. So, we have two trains leaving the same station but at different times and going in opposite directions. The first train leaves at 2 PM going east at 60 mph, and the second train leaves at 3 PM going west at 80 mph. We need to find out when they will be 210 miles apart.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how far each train has traveled by any given time. Since they're going in opposite directions, the distance between them will be the sum of the distances each has traveled.\n\nLet's denote the time after 2 PM as t hours. So, at time t, the first train has been traveling for t hours at 60 mph, so its distance is 60t miles.\n\nNow, the second train leaves at 3 PM, which is one hour after the first train. So, the second train has been traveling for (t - 1) hours at 80 mph, assuming t \u2265 1. Its distance is 80(t - 1) miles.\n\nThe total distance between the two trains is the sum of their individual distances since they're going in opposite directions. So, the total distance d is:\n\nd = 60t + 80(t - 1)\n\nWe need this distance to be 210 miles:\n\n60t + 80(t - 1) = 210\n\nNow, let's solve for t.\n\nFirst, expand the equation:\n\n60t + 80t - 80 = 210\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n140t - 80 = 210\n\nAdd 80 to both sides:\n\n140t = 290\n\nNow, divide both sides by 140:\n\nt = 290 / 140\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nt = 2.0714 hours\n\nHmm, that's not a whole number. Maybe I should check my calculations again.\n\nLet me verify the equation setup. The first train travels at 60 mph for t hours, so 60t miles. The second train travels at 80 mph for (t - 1) hours, so 80(t - 1) miles. Since they're going in opposite directions, the total distance between them is indeed the sum of their distances:\n\nd = 60t + 80(t - 1)\n\nSet equal to 210:\n\n60t + 80(t - 1) = 210\n\nExpanding:\n\n60t + 80t - 80 = 210\n\n140t - 80 = 210\n\nAdd 80 to both sides:\n\n140t = 290\n\nDivide by 140:\n\nt = 290 / 140 = 2.0714 hours\n\nSo, t is approximately 2.0714 hours after 2 PM.\n\nBut let's see, 2.0714 hours is 2 hours and 0.0714 * 60 minutes, since there are 60 minutes in an hour.\n\n0.0714 * 60 \u2248 4.2857 minutes\n\nSo, approximately 2 hours and 4.29 minutes after 2 PM.\n\nTherefore, the time would be about 2:00 PM + 2 hours and 4 minutes, which is approximately 4:04 PM.\n\nBut let me check if this makes sense.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the exact value rather than approximating.\n\nt = 290 / 140 = 29/14 hours\n\nWhich is 2 hours plus 1/14 hours.\n\nAnd 1/14 hours is 60/14 minutes, which is approximately 4.2857 minutes, so about 4 minutes and 17 seconds.\n\nSo, more precisely, it's 4:04:17 PM.\n\nBut perhaps the question expects an exact time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nFrom 2 PM to 3 PM, the first train is traveling east at 60 mph, so in that one hour, it covers 60 miles.\n\nThen, after 3 PM, both trains are moving: the first continues east at 60 mph, and the second goes west at 80 mph.\n\nSo, from 3 PM onward, the distance between them increases at a rate of 60 + 80 = 140 mph because they're going in opposite directions.\n\nAt 3 PM, the first train is already 60 miles east of the station.\n\nSo, the initial distance at 3 PM is 60 miles.\n\nThen, after that, the distance increases by 140 miles every hour.\n\nWe need the total distance to be 210 miles.\n\nSo, the additional distance needed is 210 - 60 = 150 miles.\n\nAt a rate of 140 mph, the time to cover 150 miles is t = 150 / 140 = 15/14 hours.\n\nWhich is approximately 1 hour and 4.2857 minutes.\n\nSo, from 3 PM, add 1 hour and 4.2857 minutes, which brings us to 4:04:17 PM.\n\nSo, my initial calculation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the trains will be 210 miles apart at approximately 4:04:17 PM.\n\nBut maybe the question wants the exact time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to set up the equation.\n\nLet me try using time relative to when the second train leaves.\n\nLet\u2019s let t be the time in hours after 3 PM.\n\nAt 3 PM, the first train has already been traveling for 1 hour at 60 mph, so it's 60 miles east of the station.\n\nAfter t hours past 3 PM, the first train will have traveled an additional 60t miles, and the second train will have traveled 80t miles west.\n\nSo, the total distance between them is the initial 60 miles plus the distance each has traveled after 3 PM in opposite directions:\n\nd = 60 + 60t + 80t = 60 + 140t\n\nSet this equal to 210:\n\n60 + 140t = 210\n\nSubtract 60 from both sides:\n\n140t = 150\n\nDivide by 140:\n\nt = 150 / 140 = 15/14 hours\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, t = 15/14 hours after 3 PM.\n\nConvert 15/14 hours to hours and minutes:\n\n15/14 hours = 1 hour + 1/14 hours\n\n1/14 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 60/14 \u2248 4.2857 minutes\n\nSo, approximately 1 hour and 4 minutes and 17 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the time is 3 PM + 1 hour 4 min 17 sec = 4:04:17 PM.\n\nSo, the trains will be 210 miles apart at approximately 4:04:17 PM.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4:04:17 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
