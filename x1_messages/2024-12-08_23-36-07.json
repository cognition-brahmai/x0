Each plan will correspond to an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user's question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nYahooSearch[input]: Allows the user to search for information using the Yahoo search engine. Useful in finding a list of sites that may or may not contain the answer to the user's question.\nSiteReader[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline-delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nHyperlinkHarvester[input]: Extracts hyperlinks from plain text and produces a plain text, newline-delimited response of links.\nQAModel[input]: Question-answering model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a #E[n] variable, e.g., How tall is the Eiffel Tower, given #E1?\n\nThe input to each function should just be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., QAModel[What is the height of Mount Everest, given #E3?]\n\nEnsure to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n#E0 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of #E0]\n#E1 = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context #E0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [#E[n] containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who invented the telephone and when was the first successful demonstration conducted?"
