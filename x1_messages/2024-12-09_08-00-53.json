        "content": "So the factory makes 1000 units every day, and 5% of them are defective. It operates for 30 days, and I need to find out how many non-defective products are produced in that time. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many defective units are produced each day. If 5% are defective, then the number of defective units per day is 5% of 1000. Let me calculate that:\n\n5% of 1000 is (5/100) * 1000 = 50 units.\n\nSo, each day, 50 units are defective.\n\nNow, since the factory produces 1000 units daily, the number of non-defective units per day would be total units minus defective units:\n\n1000 - 50 = 950 units.\n\nThat means, every day, 950 non-defective units are produced.\n\nNow, if the factory operates for 30 days, the total non-defective units produced over 30 days would be:\n\n950 units/day * 30 days = 28,500 units.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe by calculating the non-defective rate instead of subtracting the defective units.\n\nThe defective rate is 5%, so the non-defective rate should be 100% - 5% = 95%.\n\nSo, 95% of the units are non-defective.\n\nTherefore, every day, 95% of 1000 units are non-defective:\n\n(95/100) * 1000 = 950 units, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nOver 30 days, it would be 950 units/day * 30 days = 28,500 units.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total units produced in 30 days first and then apply the non-defective rate.\n\nTotal units in 30 days: 1000 units/day * 30 days = 30,000 units.\n\nThen, non-defective units: 95% of 30,000 = (95/100) * 30,000 = 28,500 units.\n\nSame answer again. So, it seems consistent.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? For example, does the defective rate change over time, or are there any days when the factory doesn't operate? But according to the problem, the factory operates every day for 30 days, and the defective rate is constant at 5%.\n\nSo, I think 28,500 non-defective units is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28500} \\]"
