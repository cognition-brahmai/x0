        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Golang program that connects to an Azure Cosmos DB, reads data from a specified collection, and then writes that data to a CSV file. Also, I need to implement command-line flags for the connection string, database name, and collection name. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up my Go environment. I should make sure that I have Go installed on my machine. I can check that by running `go version` in the terminal. If it's not installed, I'll need to download and install it from golang.org.\n\nNext, I need to install the necessary packages for connecting to Azure Cosmos DB and handling CSV files. For Azure Cosmos DB, I believe there's an official SDK provided by Azure. I should look that up and install it using `go get`. Similarly, for handling CSV files, Go has a built-in package called `encoding/csv`, so I don't need to install anything extra for that.\n\nLet me start by creating a new Go file, maybe call it `cosmos_to_csv.go`.\n\nNow, I need to import the required packages. I'll need the Cosmos DB SDK, the CSV package, and probably some other standard libraries for handling command-line flags and I/O operations.\n\nWait, for command-line flags, I think Go has a package called `flag`. So, I'll import that as well.\n\nHere's a rough outline of how the code might look:\n\n1. Import necessary packages.\n\n2. Define command-line flags for connection string, database name, and collection name.\n\n3. Parse the flags.\n\n4. Connect to the Azure Cosmos DB using the provided connection string, database name, and collection name.\n\n5. Read data from the specified collection.\n\n6. Write the data to a CSV file.\n\n7. Handle any errors that might occur during these steps.\n\nLet me think about the command-line flags first. I should define flags with default values or make them required. Maybe I'll make them required, so the user has to provide them every time.\n\nIn Go, using the `flag` package, I can define string flags like this:\n\n```go\n\nvar connectionString string\n\nvar databaseName string\n\nvar collectionName string\n\nfunc main() {\n\n    flag.StringVar(&connectionString, \"conn\", \"\", \"Cosmos DB connection string\")\n\n    flag.StringVar(&databaseName, \"db\", \"\", \"Database name\")\n\n    flag.StringVar(&collectionName, \"collection\", \"\", \"Collection name\")\n\n    flag.Parse()\n\n    if connectionString == \"\" || databaseName == \"\" || collectionName == \"\" {\n\n        log.Fatal(\"All flags are mandatory: -conn, -db, -collection\")\n\n    }\n\n    // Rest of the code\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThat seems straightforward. Now, for connecting to Azure Cosmos DB, I need to look into the Azure Cosmos DB SDK for Go. I should check the official Azure SDK documentation for Go to find the right package.\n\nAfter a quick search, I found that the Azure Cosmos DB SDK for Go is available at https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/master/services/cosmos-db. I need to make sure to get the latest version using `go get`.\n\nSo, I'll run:\n\n```sh\n\ngo get -u github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cosmos-db/mgmt/2020-04-01/documentdb\n\n```\n\nWait, actually, looking at the SDK, it seems there are multiple versions and packages. I need to ensure I'm using the correct one for interacting with Cosmos DB resources.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a Go driver specifically for Cosmos DB that allows me to connect and query data directly. I think I need to find the right package for data plane operations, not just resource management.\n\nUpon further investigation, I found that Azure Cosmos DB has a SQL API, and there should be a Go driver for it. Let me look for that.\n\nAh, here it is: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/master/services/cosmos-db. It seems there's a package called `github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cosmos-db/mgmt/2021-06-15/documentdb` for management, but I need the data plane operations.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the REST API directly or find a Go library that wraps it.\n\nAlternatively, since Cosmos DB supports MongoDB API as well, maybe there's a MongoDB driver for Go that I can use if the Cosmos DB is set up with MongoDB API. But in this case, since it's specified as Cosmos DB, I'll assume it's the SQL API.\n\nLet me see if there's an official SQL API Go SDK. After checking, I found that there isn't a dedicated Go SDK for the Cosmos DB SQL API, but I can use the REST API with Go's `net/http` package.\n\nThat might be a bit more work, but it's doable. Alternatively, I can look for third-party libraries that provide a Go driver for Cosmos DB SQL API.\n\nUpon searching, I found a library called `github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cosmos-db/mgmt/2021-06-15/documentdb`, but again, it seems to be for management operations, not data plane operations.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I need to use the REST API directly.\n\nLet me outline the steps needed to connect to Cosmos DB SQL API using Go's `net/http` package.\n\n1. Authenticate requests using the master key or resource tokens.\n\n2. Make GET requests to retrieve data from the specified database and collection.\n\n3. Parse the JSON responses to extract the data.\n\n4. Write the data to a CSV file.\n\nOkay, so I need to handle authentication for the Cosmos DB requests. According to the Cosmos DB documentation, I can use the master key to authenticate requests.\n\nThe authentication involves computing an authorization header for each request using the resource URL, the request method, the master key, and some other parameters.\n\nThis seems a bit involved, but it's manageable.\n\nFirst, I need to construct the resource URL for the collection. The format should be something like:\n\n`https://{databaseAccount}.documents.azure.com/dbs/{databaseId}/colls/{collectionId}/docs`\n\nThen, for each request, I need to compute the authorization header using the master key.\n\nI should look into the Cosmos DB documentation for the exact steps to compute the authorization header.\n\nAfter some research, I found that the authorization header is computed using a specific algorithm that involves hashing the resource URL, the request method, and other factors with the master key.\n\nPerhaps I can find a utility function or a library that helps with computing the authorization header.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the `github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cosmos-db/mgmt/2021-06-15/documentdb` package to handle authentication, even if I'm making custom requests.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a third-party library that simplifies Cosmos DB access in Go.\n\nUpon further searching, I found a library called `github.com/dollarsbank/cosmos`, which seems to be a Go client for Azure Cosmos DB. I should check if that's usable.\n\nLooking at the repository, it seems somewhat outdated, with the last commit from a few years ago. Maybe it's still usable, but I have concerns about its maintenance.\n\nAnother option is to use the REST API directly and handle the authorization headers manually.\n\nGiven that, I think I'll proceed with using Go's `net/http` package and handle the authorization headers myself.\n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\n1. Construct the resource URL for the collection.\n\n2. Compute the authorization header for the GET request using the master key.\n\n3. Make a GET request to retrieve the documents.\n\n4. Parse the JSON response to extract the document data.\n\n5. Write the document data to a CSV file.\n\nI need to ensure that the CSV file has headers that correspond to the document fields. Since JSON documents can have varying structures, I need to handle that appropriately.\n\nAssuming that all documents in the collection have the same structure, I can take the keys from the first document as the CSV headers.\n\nIf documents have different structures, I'll need to handle that somehow, maybe by taking the union of all keys from all documents.\n\nThis could get complicated, so for now, I'll assume that all documents have the same structure.\n\nLet me think about error handling. At various points in the program, errors can occur, such as:\n\n- Failed to parse command-line flags.\n\n- Failed to compute the authorization header.\n\n- Failed to make the HTTP request.\n\n- Failed to read the response body.\n\n- Failed to parse JSON data.\n\n- Failed to write to the CSV file.\n\nI need to handle these errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to the user.\n\nAlso, I should consider performance, especially if the collection has a large number of documents. I might need to handle pagination or retrieve data in batches.\n\nWait, according to the Cosmos DB documentation, the SQL API supports pagination through continuation tokens. So, I need to handle continuation tokens to retrieve all documents in the collection.\n\nThis adds another layer of complexity.\n\nLet me try to sketch out the main function flow:\n\n1. Parse command-line flags for connection string, database name, and collection name.\n\n2. Extract the account name and master key from the connection string.\n\n3. Construct the resource URL for the collection.\n\n4. Define a function to compute the authorization header for a given verb, resource URL, and master key.\n\n5. Make a GET request to retrieve documents, including the authorization header.\n\n6. Check for continuation tokens in the response and handle pagination.\n\n7. Parse the JSON response to extract document data.\n\n8. Write the document data to a CSV file.\n\n9. Handle any errors that occur during these steps.\n\nThis seems like a solid plan. Now, let's start implementing it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the connection string to extract the account name and master key. The connection string for Azure Cosmos DB typically looks like this:\n\n`AccountEndpoint=https://myaccount.documents.azure.com:443/;AccountKey=myMasterKey==;`\n\nI need to parse this string to extract the account name and the master key.\n\nI can split the connection string by semicolons, then split each part by equals sign to get the key-value pairs.\n\nOnce I have the account name and master key, I can construct the resource URL.\n\nNext, I need to compute the authorization header. According to the Cosmos DB documentation, the authorization header is constructed using the following components:\n\n- Verb: The HTTP verb (e.g., GET, POST).\n\n- Resource type: For documents, it's \"docs\".\n\n- Resource URL: The full resource URL.\n\n- Master key: The account's master key.\n\n- Date or version: Depending on the authentication version.\n\nI need to compute an HMAC-SHA256 hash of the concatenation of the verb, resource type, resource URL, and date or version, using the master key.\n\nThen, base64-encode the hash and include it in the authorization header.\n\nThis sounds a bit complicated, but with some careful coding, I can manage it.\n\nI should look up the exact steps in the Cosmos DB documentation to ensure I get it right.\n\nAfter computing the authorization header, I can make the GET request to retrieve the documents.\n\nI need to handle pagination by checking for the \"_continuation\" token in the response and making subsequent requests until no more tokens are present.\n\nOnce I have all the documents, I need to parse the JSON response and extract the document data.\n\nAssuming that all documents have the same structure, I can take the keys from the first document as the CSV headers.\n\nThen, I can write the headers to the CSV file, followed by the document data rows.\n\nI need to handle cases where documents have missing fields or extra fields compared to the headers.\n\nTo handle this, I can take the union of all keys from all documents and use that as the header row.\n\nFor documents missing some keys, I'll write empty values for those columns.\n\nFor documents with extra keys, I'll ignore them unless I include them in the header.\n\nThis requires a bit more logic, but it's manageable.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in code.\n\nFirst, I'll define a function to parse the connection string and extract the account name and master key.\n\nThen, I'll define a function to compute the authorization header given the verb, resource URL, and master key.\n\nNext, I'll construct the resource URL for the collection, which should be something like:\n\n`https://{accountName}.documents.azure.com/dbs/{databaseName}/colls/{collectionName}/docs`\n\nThen, I'll make the initial GET request to retrieve the first batch of documents, including the authorization header.\n\nI'll parse the JSON response to extract the documents and any continuation token.\n\nI'll collect all the document data in a slice.\n\nThen, I'll handle pagination by checking for the continuation token and making subsequent requests until no more tokens are present.\n\nOnce I have all the documents, I'll extract the headers by taking the union of all keys from all documents.\n\nThen, I'll write the headers to the CSV file, followed by the document data rows, handling missing or extra fields appropriately.\n\nFinally, I'll close the CSV file and exit the program.\n\nI need to ensure that the program handles errors properly at each step and provides useful error messages.\n\nAlso, I should consider adding some logging or verbose output to indicate the progress of the program.\n\nFor example, logging the number of documents retrieved or any issues encountered during pagination.\n\nNow, let's start writing some code.\n\nFirst, I'll set up the command-line flags.\n\nI'll define three string flags: conn, db, and collection.\n\nI'll make them required, so the program exits with an error message if any of them are missing.\n\nThen, in the main function, after parsing the flags, I'll proceed to parse the connection string.\n\nLet me write a function to parse the connection string.\n\nHere's a rough draft:\n\n```go\n\nfunc parseConnectionString(connStr string) (string, string, error) {\n\n    parts := strings.Split(connStr, \";\")\n\n    accountEndpoint := \"\"\n\n    accountKey := \"\"\n\n    for _, part := range parts {\n\n        kv := strings.SplitN(part, \"=\", 2)\n\n        if len(kv) != 2 {\n\n            continue\n\n        }\n\n        key := strings.TrimSpace(kv[0])\n\n        value := strings.TrimSpace(kv[1])\n\n        switch key {\n\n        case \"AccountEndpoint\":\n\n            accountEndpoint = value\n\n        case \"AccountKey\":\n\n            accountKey = value\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if accountEndpoint == \"\" || accountKey == \"\" {\n\n        return \"\", \"\", errors.New(\"invalid connection string: missing AccountEndpoint or AccountKey\")\n\n    }\n\n    // Extract account name from the endpoint URL\n\n    u, err := url.Parse(accountEndpoint)\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        return \"\", \"\", err\n\n    }\n\n    accountName := strings.TrimSuffix(u.Host, \".documents.azure.com\")\n\n    return accountName, accountKey, nil\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis function splits the connection string into parts, extracts the AccountEndpoint and AccountKey, and then parses the account name from the endpoint URL.\n\nAssuming the endpoint is in the format `https://{accountName}.documents.azure.com:443/`, I can extract the account name by trimming the suffix.\n\nNext, I need to compute the authorization header.\n\nAccording to the Cosmos DB documentation, the authorization header is computed using the following steps:\n\n1. Define the UTF-8 string to sign:\n\n   - For version 1.0: `verb + \"\\n\" + resourceType + \"\\n\" + resourceId + \"\\n\" + date + \"\\n\" + \"\"\n\n   - For version 1.1: `resourceType + \"\\n\" + resourceId + \"\\n\" + date + \"\\n\" + \"\"`\n\n2. Compute the HMAC-SHA256 of the string using the master key.\n\n3. Base64-encode the result.\n\n4. Construct the authorization header: `type version-hmac`\n\nIn this case, I think I should use version 1.0 for simplicity.\n\nSo, for version 1.0, the string to sign is:\n\n`verb + \"\\n\" + resourceType + \"\\n\" + resourceId + \"\\n\" + date + \"\\n\" + \"\"`\n\nThe resource type for documents is \"docs\", and the resource ID is the full resource URL.\n\nI need to include the date in the string to sign, so I should also include it in the request headers.\n\nI should generate the date string in the correct format, which is RFC 1123.\n\nLet me write a function to compute the authorization header.\n\nHere's a rough draft:\n\n```go\n\nimport (\n\n    \"crypto/hmac\"\n\n    \"crypto/sha256\"\n\n    \"encoding/base64\"\n\n    \"net/http\"\n\n    \"time\"\n\n)\n\nfunc computeAuthorizationHeader(verb, resourceType, resourceId, date, masterKey string, version string) (string, error) {\n\n    toSign := verb + \"\\n\" + resourceType + \"\\n\" + resourceId + \"\\n\" + date + \"\\n\" + \"\"\n\n    key, err := base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(masterKey)\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        return \"\", err\n\n    }\n\n    h := hmac.New(sha256.New, key)\n\n    h.Write([]byte(toSign))\n\n    hmacBytes := h.Sum(nil)\n\n    hmacEncoded := base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(hmacBytes)\n\n    authHeader := \"type=\" + version + \",signed\ufffd\ufffdtd=\" + hmacEncoded\n\n    return authHeader, nil\n\n}\n\n```\n\nIn this function, I construct the string to sign, decode the master key from base64, compute the HMAC-SHA256, base64-encode the result, and construct the authorization header.\n\nI need to make sure to use the correct version. For version 1.0, the type is \"master\".\n\nSo, the authHeader should be something like: `type=master,signed\u6676td={hmacEncoded}`\n\nWait, I think I need to specify the version correctly.\n\nLooking back at the documentation, for version 1.0, the type is \"master\" and the version is \"1.0\".\n\nSo, the authHeader should be: `type=master,version=1.0,hmac={hmacEncoded}`\n\nLet me correct that in the function.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that the date is in the correct format.\n\nLet me update the function accordingly.\n\nHere's the revised function:\n\n```go\n\nfunc computeAuthorizationHeader(verb, resourceType, resourceId, date, masterKey string) (string, error) {\n\n    toSign := verb + \"\\n\" + resourceType + \"\\n\" + resourceId + \"\\n\" + date + \"\\n\" + \"\"\n\n    key, err := base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(masterKey)\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        return \"\", err\n\n    }\n\n    h := hmac.New(sha256.New, key)\n\n    h.Write([]byte(toSign))\n\n    hmacBytes := h.Sum(nil)\n\n    hmacEncoded := base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(hmacBytes)\n\n    authHeader := \"type=master,version=1.0,hmac=\" + hmacEncoded\n\n    return authHeader, nil\n\n}\n\n```\n\nI removed the version parameter since it's fixed for version 1.0.\n\nNow, I need to construct the resource URL.\n\nGiven the account name, database name, and collection name, the resource URL should be:\n\n`https://{accountName}.documents.azure.com/dbs/{databaseName}/colls/{collectionName}/docs`\n\nI need to ensure that the databaseName and collectionName are properly URL-encoded.\n\nLet me write a function to construct the resource URL.\n\nHere's a rough draft:\n\n```go\n\nfunc constructResourceURL(accountName, databaseName, collectionName string) string {\n\n    encodedDB := url.QueryEscape(databaseName)\n\n    encodedColl := url.QueryEscape(collectionName)\n\n    return \"https://\" + accountName + \".documents.azure.com/dbs/\" + encodedDB + \"/colls/\" + encodedColl + \"/docs\"\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis function URL-encodes the database and collection names and constructs the resource URL.\n\nNext, I need to make the GET request to retrieve the documents.\n\nI need to set the authorization header, the date header, and possibly other headers required by Cosmos DB.\n\nAccording to the documentation, I should include the \"x-ms-date\" header with the current date in RFC 1123 format.\n\nAlso, I need to include the \"x-ms-version\" header with the version number.\n\nI think the version number for Cosmos DB is \"2017-02-22\". I should confirm that.\n\nLet me look it up.\n\nUpon checking, the current recommended version is \"2019-12-12\". I should use that.\n\nSo, in the request headers, I need to set:\n\n- \"x-ms-date\": current date in RFC 1123 format\n\n- \"x-ms-version\": \"2019-12-12\"\n\n- \"authorization\": the computed authorization header\n\n- \"content-type\": \"application/json\"\n\nI should also consider setting the \"accept\" header to \"application/json\".\n\nLet me write a function to make the GET request with the appropriate headers.\n\nHere's a rough draft:\n\n```go\n\nfunc getDocuments(resourceURL, authHeader, dateHeader string) (*http.Response, error) {\n\n    client := &http.Client{}\n\n    req, err := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", resourceURL, nil)\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        return nil, err\n\n    }\n\n    req.Header.Set(\"x-ms-date\", dateHeader)\n\n    req.Header.Set(\"x-ms-version\", \"2019-12-12\")\n\n    req.Header.Set(\"authorization\", authHeader)\n\n    req.Header.Set(\"content-type\", \"application/json\")\n\n    req.Header.Set(\"accept\", \"application/json\")\n\n    resp, err := client.Do(req)\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        return nil, err\n\n    }\n\n    return resp, nil\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis function constructs an HTTP GET request with the required headers and sends it using an HTTP client.\n\nNow, I need to handle pagination using continuation tokens.\n\nAccording to the Cosmos DB documentation, when retrieving documents, if there are more results than can be returned in a single response, a continuation token is included in the response.\n\nI need to check for this token and make subsequent requests with the token until no more tokens are present.\n\nThe continuation token should be included in the request headers using the \"x-ms-continuation\" header.\n\nSo, I need to modify my GET request function to handle continuation tokens.\n\nI can do this by keeping track of the continuation token and including it in the request headers for subsequent requests.\n\nI'll need to collect all the document data from each response and combine them into a single slice.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the document data.\n\nAssuming that the documents are JSON objects, I can represent them as maps in Go.\n\nThen, I can collect all the documents in a slice of maps.\n\nOnce I have all the documents, I can proceed to write them to a CSV file.\n\nBut first, I need to handle the pagination.\n\nHere's a rough outline of how to handle pagination:\n\n1. Make the initial request without a continuation token.\n\n2. Parse the response to extract the documents and check for a continuation token.\n\n3. If a continuation token is present, include it in the next request's headers.\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no continuation token is present.\n\nI need to be careful with rate limiting and possibly add delays between requests if needed.\n\nNow, let's think about parsing the JSON response.\n\nThe response from Cosmos DB should be a JSON object containing an array of documents under the \"Documents\" key.\n\nEach document is a JSON object with key-value pairs.\n\nI need to unmarshal the JSON response into a Go struct or a slice of maps.\n\nI think using a slice of maps would be flexible, as documents can have varying structures.\n\nSo, I'll define a variable to hold all documents as a slice of maps.\n\nHere's a rough draft:\n\n```go\n\nvar allDocuments []map[string]interface{}\n\nfor {\n\n    resp, err := getDocuments(resourceURL, authHeader, dateHeader)\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        return err\n\n    }\n\n    defer resp.Body.Close()\n\n    body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        return err\n\n    }\n\n    var respData map[string]interface{}\n\n    err = json.Unmarshal(body, &respData)\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        return err\n\n    }\n\n    documents, ok := respData[\"Documents\"].([]interface{})\n\n    if !ok {\n\n        return errors.New(\"invalid response: missing Documents array\")\n\n    }\n\n    for _, doc := range documents {\n\n        docMap, ok := doc.(map[string]interface{})\n\n        if !ok {\n\n            return errors.New(\"invalid document: not a map\")\n\n        }\n\n        allDocuments = append(allDocuments, docMap)\n\n    }\n\n    // Check for continuation token\n\n    continuation, ok := respData[\"_continuation\"].(string)\n\n    if !ok || continuation == \"\" {\n\n        break\n\n    }\n\n    // Set continuation token in headers for next request\n\n    resourceURL += \"?bookmark=\" + url.QueryEscape(continuation)\n\n}\n\n```\n\nIn this code, I make requests in a loop, parsing the response to extract the documents and checking for a continuation token.\n\nIf a continuation token is present, I append it to the resource URL for the next request.\n\nI collect all documents in the `allDocuments` slice.\n\nOnce there's no continuation token, I exit the loop.\n\nNow, with all the documents collected, I need to write them to a CSV file.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the CSV headers.\n\nAssuming all documents have the same structure, I can take the keys from the first document as headers.\n\nBut to handle documents with different structures, I'll take the union of all keys from all documents.\n\nI'll collect all unique keys from all documents and use them as headers.\n\nThen, for each document, I'll write a row in the CSV file, filling in values for each header.\n\nIf a document doesn't have a particular header key, I'll leave that column empty.\n\nLet me write a function to write the documents to a CSV file.\n\nHere's a rough draft:\n\n```go\n\nfunc writeDocumentsToCSV(filename string, documents []map[string]interface{}) error {\n\n    file, err := os.Create(filename)\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        return err\n\n    }\n\n    defer file.Close()\n\n    csvWriter := csv.NewWriter(file)\n\n    defer csvWriter.Flush()\n\n    // Collect all unique headers\n\n    headerSet := make(map[string]struct{})\n\n    for _, doc := range documents {\n\n        for key := range doc {\n\n            headerSet[key] = struct{}{}\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    headers := make([]string, 0, len(headerSet))\n\n    for key := range headerSet {\n\n        headers = append(headers, key)\n\n    }\n\n    // Sort headers for consistency\n\n    sort.Strings(headers)\n\n    // Write headers to CSV\n\n    if err := csvWriter.Write(headers); err != nil {\n\n        return err\n\n    }\n\n    // Write document rows to CSV\n\n    for _, doc := range documents {\n\n        row := make([]string, len(headers))\n\n        for i, header := range headers {\n\n            value, ok := doc[header]\n\n            if ok {\n\n                row[i] = fmt.Sprintf(\"%v\", value)\n\n            } else {\n\n                row[i] = \"\"\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        if err := csvWriter.Write(row); err != nil {\n\n            return err\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return nil\n\n}\n\n```\n\nIn this function, I create a new CSV file, create a CSV writer, collect all unique headers from the documents, write the headers to the CSV file, and then write each document's data as a row, filling in values for each header.\n\nI'm using `fmt.Sprintf(\"%v\", value)` to convert the values to strings, assuming that the document values are of different types.\n\nNow, let's put it all together in the main function.\n\nHere's a rough draft of the main function:\n\n```go\n\nfunc main() {\n\n    var connectionString string\n\n    var databaseName string\n\n    var collectionName string\n\n    flag.StringVar(&connectionString, \"conn\", \"\", \"Cosmos DB connection string\")\n\n    flag.StringVar(&databaseName, \"db\", \"\", \"Database name\")\n\n    flag.StringVar(&collectionName, \"collection\", \"\", \"Collection name\")\n\n    flag.Parse()\n\n    if connectionString == \"\" || databaseName == \"\" || collectionName == \"\" {\n\n        log.Fatal(\"All flags are mandatory: -conn, -db, -collection\")\n\n    }\n\n    accountName, masterKey, err := parseConnectionString(connectionString)\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        log.Fatalf(\"Failed to parse connection string: %v\", err)\n\n    }\n\n    resourceURL := constructResourceURL(accountName, databaseName, collectionName)\n\n    dateHeader := time.Now().UTC().Format(http.TimeFormat)\n\n    authHeader, err := computeAuthorizationHeader(\"GET\", \"docs\", resourceURL, dateHeader, masterKey)\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        log.Fatalf(\"Failed to compute authorization header: %v\", err)\n\n    }\n\n    allDocuments, err := retrieveAllDocuments(resourceURL, authHeader, dateHeader)\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        log.Fatalf(\"Failed to retrieve documents: %v\", err)\n\n    }\n\n    if err := writeDocumentsToCSV(\"output.csv\", allDocuments); err != nil {\n\n        log.Fatalf(\"Failed to write to CSV file: %v\", err)\n\n    }\n\n    log.Println(\"Data successfully written to output.csv\")\n\n}\n\n```\n\nIn this main function, I parse the command-line flags, parse the connection string to get the account name and master key, construct the resource URL, compute the authorization header, retrieve all documents using pagination, and finally write them to a CSV file.\n\nI need to implement the `retrieveAllDocuments` function, which handles the pagination logic.\n\nHere's a rough draft of that function:\n\n```go\n\nfunc retrieveAllDocuments(resourceURL, authHeader, dateHeader string) ([]map[string]interface{}, error) {\n\n    var allDocuments []map[string]interface{}\n\n    for {\n\n        resp, err := getDocuments(resourceURL, authHeader, dateHeader)\n\n        if err != nil {\n\n            return nil, err\n\n        }\n\n        defer resp.Body.Close()\n\n        body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)\n\n        if err != nil {\n\n            return nil, err\n\n        }\n\n        var respData map[string]interface{}\n\n        err = json.Unmarshal(body, &respData)\n\n        if err != nil {\n\n            return nil, err\n\n        }\n\n        documents, ok := respData[\"Documents\"].([]interface{})\n\n        if !ok {\n\n            return nil, errors.New(\"invalid response: missing Documents array\")\n\n        }\n\n        for _, doc := range documents {\n\n            docMap, ok := doc.(map[string]interface{})\n\n            if !ok {\n\n                return nil, errors.New(\"invalid document: not a map\")\n\n            }\n\n            allDocuments = append(allDocuments, docMap)\n\n        }\n\n        // Check for continuation token\n\n        continuation, ok := respData[\"_continuation\"].(string)\n\n        if !ok || continuation == \"\" {\n\n            break\n\n        }\n\n        // Set continuation token in URL for next request\n\n        resourceURL += \"?bookmark=\" + url.QueryEscape(continuation)\n\n    }\n\n    return allDocuments, nil\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis function handles the pagination by checking for a continuation token and appending it to the resource URL for subsequent requests.\n\nOnce there are no more continuation tokens, it returns all collected documents.\n\nI need to make sure that the `getDocuments` function is defined as earlier.\n\nAlso, I should handle any errors that occur during the HTTP requests or JSON unmarshalling appropriately.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider adding retries for failed requests or handling rate limiting.\n\nBut for now, this should suffice.\n\nLet me think about testing this program.\n\nI need to have an Azure Cosmos DB account set up with the SQL API, a database, and a collection containing some documents.\n\nI need to obtain the connection string, which includes the account endpoint and the master key.\n\nThen, I can run the program with the appropriate command-line flags, specifying the connection string, database name, and collection name.\n\nThe program should connect to Cosmos DB, retrieve all documents from the specified collection, and write them to a CSV file named \"output.csv\".\n\nI should also consider adding more features, such as specifying the output CSV file name via a command-line flag, or adding verbose logging to see more details during execution.\n\nBut for the basic requirement, this should be sufficient.\n\nI should also think about security considerations, such as not hardcoding credentials and handling the connection string securely.\n\nIn a production environment, it's advisable to use environment variables or secure vaults to store sensitive information like the connection string and master key.\n\nBut since this is a simple program, and considering the constraints, using command-line flags might be acceptable, provided that the user is cautious with how they handle the credentials.\n\nFinally, I should test the program with a small collection to ensure that it retrieves and writes the data correctly, and then test it with larger collections to verify that pagination and continuation tokens are handled properly.\n\nI should also check for edge cases, such as empty collections or documents with varying structures.\n\nOverall, this seems like a feasible plan. With careful implementation and testing, I can create a robust program to fulfill the requirements.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo create a Golang program that connects to an Azure Cosmos DB instance, reads data from a specified collection, and writes the data to a CSV file, follow these steps. This solution includes command-line flags for specifying the connection string, database, and collection names.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"bytes\"\n\t\"encoding/base64\"\n\t\"encoding/csv\"\n\t\"encoding/json\"\n\t\"flag\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"io/ioutil\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"net/url\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"sort\"\n\t\"strings\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tvar connectionString string\n\tvar databaseName string\n\tvar collectionName string\n\n\tflag.StringVar(&connectionString, \"conn\", \"\", \"Cosmos DB connection string\")\n\tflag.StringVar(&databaseName, \"db\", \"\", \"Database name\")\n\tflag.StringVar(&collectionName, \"collection\", \"\", \"Collection name\")\n\tflag.Parse()\n\n\tif connectionString == \"\" || databaseName == \"\" || collectionName == \"\" {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"All flags are mandatory: -conn, -db, -collection\")\n\t}\n\n\taccountName, masterKey, err := parseConnectionString(connectionString)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Failed to parse connection string: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\n\tresourceURL := constructResourceURL(accountName, databaseName, collectionName)\n\tdateHeader := time.Now().UTC().Format(http.TimeFormat)\n\tauthHeader, err := computeAuthorizationHeader(\"GET\", \"docs\", resourceURL, dateHeader, masterKey)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Failed to compute authorization header: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\n\tallDocuments, err := retrieveAllDocuments(resourceURL, authHeader, dateHeader)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Failed to retrieve documents: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\n\tif err := writeDocumentsToCSV(\"output.csv\", allDocuments);
