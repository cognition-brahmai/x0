        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 houses numbered from 1 to 100. Even-numbered houses have blue doors, and odd-numbered houses have red doors. I need to find out how many more red doors there are than blue doors.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many houses have blue doors and how many have red doors.\n\nEven-numbered houses have blue doors. So, the even numbers between 1 and 100 are 2, 4, 6, ..., 100. That's every second house starting from 2.\n\nSimilarly, odd-numbered houses have red doors: 1, 3, 5, ..., 99. Again, every second house, starting from 1.\n\nSince the houses are numbered consecutively from 1 to 100, half of them should be even and half should be odd, right? But let's confirm that.\n\nTotal houses = 100.\n\nNumber of even-numbered houses (blue doors) = 100 / 2 = 50.\n\nNumber of odd-numbered houses (red doors) = 100 / 2 = 50.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. So, there are 50 blue doors and 50 red doors. Therefore, the difference between red doors and blue doors should be zero.\n\nBut the question is asking for how many more red doors there are than blue doors. If there are equal numbers, the answer should be zero. But maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me double-check. Houses 1 to 100:\n\n- Even numbers: 2, 4, 6, ..., 100. That's 50 houses.\n\n- Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, ..., 99. That's also 50 houses.\n\nYes,\u786e\u786e\u5b9e\u5b9e\u5404\u670950\u680b\u623f\u5b50\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u7ea2\u95e8\u548c\u84dd\u95e8\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u5dee\u989d\u4e3a\u96f6\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u623f\u5b50\u7f16\u53f7\u4ece1\u5230100\uff0c\u5305\u62ec1\u548c100\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u786e\u5b9e\u540450\u4e2a\u5947\u6570\u548c\u5076\u6570\u3002\n\n\u4e5f\u8bb8\u6211\u6f0f\u6389\u4e86something. \u6216\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u623f\u5b50\u7f16\u53f7\u7684 inclusivity.\n\n\u7b49\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u623f\u5b50\u662f\u4ece1\u5230100\uff0c\u5305\u62ec1\u548c100\u30021\u662f\u5947\u6570\uff0c100\u662f\u5076\u6570\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u5947\u6570\u662f\u4ece1\u523099\uff0c\u517150\u4e2a\uff1b\u5076\u6570\u662f\u4ece2\u5230100\uff0c\u517150\u4e2a\u3002\n\n\u6ca1\u9519\uff0c50\u5bf950\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u7ea2\u95e8\u548c\u84dd\u95e8\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u662f\u76f8\u540c\u7684\uff0c\u5dee\u989d\u662f\u96f6\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u9898\u76ee\u8bf4\u201chow many more red doors are there than blue doors? \u201d\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u7ea2\u95e8\u6bd4\u84dd\u95e8\u591a\u591a\u5c11\uff1f\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4e00\u6837\u591a\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u96f6\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u6211\u611f\u89c9\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u9677\u9631\u6216\u8005\u7ec6\u8282\u6211\u9519\u8fc7\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u4e5f\u8bb8\u623f\u5b50\u7f16\u53f7\u4e0d\u662f\u6807\u51c6\u76841\u5230100\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u6761\u4ef6\uff1f\n\n\u9898\u76ee\u4e2d\u8bf4\u201call the even-numbered houses have blue doors and all the odd-numbered houses have red doors\u201d\uff0c\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u5f88\u660e\u786e\u3002\n\n\u6216\u8005\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u662f\u6709\u623f\u5b50\u6ca1\u6709\u95e8\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u989c\u8272\u7684\u95e8\uff0c\u4f46\u9898\u76ee\u6ca1\u6709\u8bf4\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5e94\u8be5\u4e0d\u662f\u3002\n\n\u6216\u8005\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u662f\u6709\u623f\u5b50\u95e8\u7684\u989c\u8272\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u5e38\u89c4\uff0c\u4f46\u9898\u76ee\u8bf4\u5168\u90e8\u5076\u6570\u53f7\u623f\u5b50\u662f\u84dd\u95e8\uff0c\u5947\u6570\u662f\u7ea2\u95e8\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u5c31\u662f50\u6bd450\uff0c\u5dee\u989d\u4e3a\u96f6\u3002\n\n\u4e5f\u8bb8\u7b54\u6848\u5c31\u662f\u96f6\u3002\n\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u9898\u4eba\u60f3\u8981\u8003\u9a8c\u4e00\u4e0b\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u8ba1\u6570\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u5947\u6570\u548c\u5076\u6570\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002\n\n\u6216\u8005\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u5f15\u51fa\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u505a\u94fa\u57ab\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u5c31\u76ee\u524d\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u96f6\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u7ea2\u95e8\u548c\u84dd\u95e8\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u7ea2\u95e8\u6216\u84dd\u95e8\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
