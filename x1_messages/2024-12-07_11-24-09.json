        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular room that measures 12 meters by 16 meters, and we need to cover it with square tiles without any gaps or overlaps. The question is asking for the maximum size that each tile can be. Okay, so first things first, I need to understand what's being asked here.\n\nI think the key here is to find the largest possible square tile that can fit perfectly into both the length and the width of the room. That way, we can cover the entire floor without having to cut any tiles or leave any spaces. So, essentially, we need to find a tile size that is a common divisor of both the length and the width of the room.\n\nLet me write down the dimensions again:\n\n- Length: 16 meters\n\n- Width: 12 meters\n\nNow, since we're dealing with meters, and tiles are usually measured in smaller units like centimeters or decimeters, I might need to convert these measurements to make more sense for tile sizes. But maybe I can work with meters as well, depending on the tile sizes we're considering.\n\nAlright, so to find the largest square tile that can fit into both dimensions without leaving any gaps or needing to cut tiles, I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the length and the width. The GCD will give me the largest tile size that can be used to tile the floor completely.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD of two numbers. One way is to list all the divisors of each number and find the largest one that they have in common.\n\nFirst, let's list the divisors of 16 and 12.\n\nDivisors of 16:\n\n- 1, 2, 4, 8, 16\n\nDivisors of 12:\n\n- 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n\nNow, the common divisors are 1, 2, and 4. So, the greatest common divisor is 4.\n\nTherefore, the largest square tile that can be used is 4 meters by 4 meters.\n\nWait a minute, 4 meters seems quite large for a tile. Are there any tiles that big? I'm not sure, but perhaps in some industrial settings, but for a regular room, that might be too big. Maybe I need to consider smaller units.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider converting the meters to centimeters to get a better sense of tile sizes.\n\nLet's convert the dimensions to centimeters:\n\n- Length: 16 meters = 1600 cm\n\n- Width: 12 meters = 1200 cm\n\nNow, let's find the GCD of 1600 and 1200.\n\nTo find the GCD of 1600 and 1200, I can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is more efficient, especially for larger numbers.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by dividing the larger number by the smaller number and taking the remainder. Then, replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\nLet's apply that:\n\n1600 \u00f7 1200 = 1 with a remainder of 400.\n\nNow, take 1200 \u00f7 400 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSo, the GCD is 400 cm.\n\nWait, 400 cm is equal to 4 meters, which is the same result as before. So, according to this, the largest square tile that can be used is 400 cm by 400 cm.\n\nBut again, I'm thinking that might be too large. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider the problem differently. Suppose I want to use tiles of size x cm by x cm. Then, the number of tiles needed along the length would be 1600 / x, and along the width would be 1200 / x. Both of these need to be integers since we can't have fractional tiles.\n\nSo, x must be a divisor of both 1600 and 1200. And to maximize x, I need to find the largest common divisor, which is again the GCD.\n\nSo, it seems like 400 cm is the answer.\n\nBut let me check if there are any larger tiles that could be used if I consider that tiles can be cut.\n\nWait, no, the problem specifies that tiles are laid side by side without any gaps or overlaps, meaning no cutting is allowed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider tiles that are not square but rectangular, but the problem specifically says square tiles.\n\nWait, no, it says \"square tiles,\" so they have to be square.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to interpret this.\n\nSuppose I consider that tiles can be placed in any orientation, as long as they are square.\n\nBut again, the room is rectangular, so placing square tiles should work regardless of orientation.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the aspect ratio or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the maximum tile size.\n\nWait, I recall that the maximum tile size is indeed the GCD of the dimensions.\n\nSo, in this case, it's 400 cm.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider if there are any larger tiles that could fit.\n\nSuppose I choose a tile size of 500 cm. Then, 1600 / 500 = 3.2, which is not an integer, meaning there would be a gap or need to cut tiles, which is not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, 600 cm: 1600 / 600 \u2248 2.666, again not an integer.\n\n700 cm: 1600 / 700 \u2248 2.285, still not an integer.\n\nAnd so on. So, any tile larger than 400 cm would not fit perfectly.\n\nTherefore, 400 cm is indeed the maximum tile size.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check with 400 cm.\n\n1600 / 400 = 4 (integer)\n\n1200 / 400 = 3 (integer)\n\nSo, 4 tiles along the length and 3 tiles along the width, totaling 12 tiles.\n\nPerfect fit.\n\nAlternatively, if I choose a smaller tile, say 200 cm, then:\n\n1600 / 200 = 8\n\n1200 / 200 = 6\n\nTotal tiles: 48\n\nThat would also work, but the question is asking for the maximum size, so 400 cm is better.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to use larger tiles if I arrange them in a certain pattern.\n\nSuppose I arrange the tiles diagonally or in some other pattern.\n\nBut the problem specifies \"side by side without any gaps or overlaps,\" which probably implies a standard grid layout.\n\nSo, in that case, the GCD approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical theorem or formula that confirms this.\n\nI think in tiling theory, the largest square tile that can be used to tile a rectangle without cutting is indeed the square with side length equal to the GCD of the length and width.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the maximum tile size is 400 cm by 400 cm.\n\nBut just to be comprehensive, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this decision.\n\nFor example, practical considerations such as the availability of such large tiles, the weight they might have, or installation issues.\n\nBut since this is a theoretical problem, I think we can overlook these practical aspects.\n\nAnother consideration might be the aspect ratio of the room.\n\nThe room is 12m by 16m, which is a ratio of 3:4.\n\nIf I use 4m tiles, which is a 1:1 ratio, it might not align perfectly, but in this case, since 12 and 16 are both multiples of 4, it does align perfectly.\n\nAlternatively, if the dimensions weren't multiples of each other's divisors, there might be issues, but here it works fine.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the maximum size of each square tile is 400 cm by 400 cm.\n\nWait, but to present this properly, perhaps I should consider proposing multiple answers, detailing the calculations, ranking them, and then selecting the optimal one, as per the user's request.\n\nAlright, let's try that.\n\n**Proposed Answer 1: 400 cm by 400 cm**\n\n- **Calculation:** Found by calculating the GCD of 1600 cm and 1200 cm, which is 400 cm.\n\n- **Feasibility:** High. Fits perfectly into both dimensions without any gaps or overlaps.\n\n**Proposed Answer 2: 200 cm by 200 cm**\n\n- **Calculation:** 200 cm is a common divisor of both 1600 cm and 1200 cm.\n\n- **Feasibility:** High. Would require more tiles (48 tiles), but still fits perfectly.\n\n**Proposed Answer 3: 100 cm by 100 cm**\n\n- **Calculation:** 100 cm is a common divisor of both dimensions.\n\n- **Feasibility:** High. Even more tiles (96 tiles), but still a perfect fit.\n\n**Proposed Answer 4: 500 cm by 500 cm**\n\n- **Calculation:** 500 cm is not a divisor of both dimensions; 1600 / 500 = 3.2, which is not an integer.\n\n- **Feasibility:** Low. Would leave gaps or require cutting tiles, which is against the problem constraints.\n\n**Proposed Answer 5: 800 cm by 800 cm**\n\n- **Calculation:** 800 cm is not a divisor of both dimensions; 1200 / 800 = 1.5, not an integer.\n\n- **Feasibility:** Low. Similar issues as above.\n\nNow, ranking these proposals based on feasibility and the problem's requirement for the maximum tile size:\n\n1. **Proposed Answer 1: 400 cm by 400 cm** - Meets the criteria perfectly and is the largest possible tile size.\n\n2. **Proposed Answer 2: 200 cm by 200 cm** - While feasible, it's smaller than the maximum possible.\n\n3. **Proposed Answer 3: 100 cm by 100 cm** - Also feasible but smaller, resulting in more tiles needed.\n\n4. **Proposed Answer 4: 500 cm by 500 cm** - Infeasible due to non-integer division.\n\n5. **Proposed Answer 5: 800 cm by 800 cm** - Infeasible for the same reason.\n\nTherefore, the optimal solution is **Proposed Answer 1: 400 cm by 400 cm**.\n\nTo summarize, the maximum size of each square tile that can be used to cover the rectangular room measuring 12 meters by 16 meters without any gaps or overlaps is 400 cm by 400 cm. This solution is derived from finding the greatest common divisor of the room's dimensions in centimeters, ensuring a perfect fit with the fewest number of tiles."
