        "content": "So I have this problem here: a train travels 450 kilometers in 5 hours, and I need to find its average speed in meters per second. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. So, in this case, it's 450 kilometers divided by 5 hours. But the catch is that I need to express this speed in meters per second, not in kilometers per hour.\n\nAlright, so first things first, I should probably find out what the average speed is in kilometers per hour and then convert that to meters per second.\n\nLet's calculate the average speed in kilometers per hour:\n\nAverage speed = total distance / total time\n\n= 450 kilometers / 5 hours\n\n= 90 kilometers per hour.\n\nNow, I need to convert 90 kilometers per hour into meters per second.\n\nTo do that, I need to know how many meters are in a kilometer and how many seconds are in an hour.\n\nI know that:\n\n1 kilometer = 1,000 meters\n\n1 hour = 3,600 seconds\n\nSo, to convert kilometers per hour to meters per second, I can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 kilometer per hour = 1,000 meters / 3,600 seconds = 5/18 meters per second.\n\nTherefore, to convert 90 kilometers per hour to meters per second, I can multiply 90 by 5/18.\n\nLet me do that:\n\n90 * (5/18) = (90 * 5) / 18 = 450 / 18 = 25 meters per second.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\n90 kilometers per hour * (5/18) = 450/18 = 25 meters per second.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of units:\n\n90 kilometers/hour * (1,000 meters / 1 kilometer) * (1 hour / 3,600 seconds)\n\n= 90 * 1,000 / 3,600 meters per second\n\n= 90,000 / 3,600 = 25 meters per second.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, the average speed of the train is 25 meters per second.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Maybe there's a different way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way could be to directly convert the distance to meters and the time to seconds, and then divide.\n\nFirst, convert 450 kilometers to meters:\n\n450 kilometers * 1,000 meters/kilometer = 450,000 meters.\n\nNext, convert 5 hours to seconds:\n\n5 hours * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 5 * 3,600 = 18,000 seconds.\n\nNow, average speed = total distance / total time\n\n= 450,000 meters / 18,000 seconds\n\n= 25 meters per second.\n\nAgain, I get the same answer. So, that gives me more confidence that 25 meters per second is correct.\n\nLet me think if there's any other way to look at this. Maybe using dimensional analysis or something like that.\n\nStarting with 450 kilometers in 5 hours, that's 90 kilometers per hour.\n\nNow, I need to convert kilometers per hour to meters per second.\n\nI know that 1 kilometer is 1,000 meters, and 1 hour is 3,600 seconds.\n\nSo, 90 kilometers per hour is equal to 90 * (1,000 meters / 3,600 seconds).\n\nSimplifying that, 90 * 1,000 = 90,000 meters, divided by 3,600 seconds, which is 90,000 / 3,600 = 25 meters per second.\n\nYet another confirmation.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that to convert kilometers per hour to meters per second, you can divide by 3.6, since 1 meter per second is equal to 3.6 kilometers per hour.\n\nSo, 90 kilometers per hour divided by 3.6 should give me meters per second.\n\nLet's try that: 90 / 3.6 = 25 meters per second. Same answer again.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently that the average speed is 25 meters per second.\n\nIs there any chance I made a mistake somewhere? Let me review.\n\nFirst, I calculated the average speed in kilometers per hour correctly: 450 km / 5 h = 90 km/h.\n\nThen, converting 90 km/h to m/s:\n\nMethod 1: 90 * (5/18) = 25 m/s.\n\nMethod 2: 90 * (1,000 m / 3,600 s) = 25 m/s.\n\nMethod 3: Direct conversion by dividing by 3.6: 90 / 3.6 = 25 m/s.\n\nAll methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, directly converting distance and time:\n\n450 km = 450,000 m;\n\n5 h = 18,000 s;\n\nAverage speed = 450,000 m / 18,000 s = 25 m/s.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
