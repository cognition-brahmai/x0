        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a room full of people, and we're told that 20% wear glasses, 40% wear contact lenses, and 15% wear both glasses and contact lenses. We need to find out what percentage doesn't wear any vision correction devices.\n\nFirst, I think I should recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion here because we're dealing with overlapping sets\u2014some people wear both glasses and contacts.\n\nSo, the total percentage of people who wear some kind of vision correction should be the sum of those who wear glasses and those who wear contacts, minus those who wear both, to avoid double-counting.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal wearing corrections = percentage wearing glasses + percentage wearing contacts - percentage wearing both.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal wearing corrections = 20% + 40% - 15% = 45%.\n\nSo, 45% of the people wear some kind of vision correction.\n\nNow, to find out who doesn't wear any, I should subtract this from 100%, right?\n\nBecause the total is 100%, and if 45% wear some kind of correction, then the remaining percentage doesn't wear any.\n\nSo, percentage not wearing any = 100% - 45% = 55%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nWe have:\n\n- 20% wear glasses.\n\n- 40% wear contacts.\n\n- 15% wear both.\n\nIf we add 20% and 40%, we get 60%, but that includes the 15% who wear both twice, once in each category. So, we need to subtract the 15% who are counted in both to get the total percentage wearing any correction.\n\nSo, 60% - 15% = 45%, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, subtracting that from 100% gives us 55%, which should be the percentage not wearing any vision correction.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a Venn diagram in my mind.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle is glasses (20%), the other is contacts (40%), and the overlap is 15%.\n\nSo, the part that wears only glasses is 20% - 15% = 5%.\n\nThe part that wears only contacts is 40% - 15% = 25%.\n\nThen, the part that wears both is 15%.\n\nSo, total wearing any correction is 5% + 25% + 15% = 45%, which again confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the percentage not wearing any is 100% - 45% = 55%.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor to consider. For example, is there any possibility that some people wear neither, or perhaps some other type of vision correction not mentioned? The problem only mentions glasses, contacts, and neither, so I think we're safe assuming that the only categories are glasses only, contacts only, both, and neither.\n\nGiven that, and with the calculations matching both the inclusion-exclusion principle and the Venn diagram approach, I'm confident that 55% is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{55\\%} \\]"
