        "content": "Let's see. The farmer has 12 cows and 8 goats. Each cow gives 15 liters of milk per day, and each goat gives 5 liters per day. I need to find out how much more milk the cows produce compared to the goats every day.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total milk from the cows. Since there are 12 cows and each gives 15 liters, I can multiply 12 by 15 to get the total milk from cows.\n\n12 cows * 15 liters/cow = 180 liters from cows.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total milk from the goats. There are 8 goats, each giving 5 liters, so 8 times 5 should give me the total from goats.\n\n8 goats * 5 liters/goat = 40 liters from goats.\n\nNow, to find out how much more milk the cows produce than the goats, I need to subtract the total milk from goats from the total milk from cows.\n\n180 liters - 40 liters = 140 liters.\n\nSo, the farmer gets 140 liters more milk from his cows than from his goats every day.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can calculate it differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way is to find out the milk difference per animal and then multiply by the number of animals, but that might be more complicated in this case.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the total milk from all animals and then see the difference between cows and goats.\n\nTotal milk = milk from cows + milk from goats = 180 + 40 = 220 liters.\n\nBut the question is specifically about how much more milk comes from cows than goats, so the difference between the two is what's needed.\n\nI think my initial calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of totals.\n\nCows: 12 * 15 = 180 liters.\n\nGoats: 8 * 5 = 40 liters.\n\nDifference: 180 - 40 = 140 liters.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nMaybe I can also look at the ratio of milk production.\n\nCows produce 15 liters per cow, goats produce 5 liters per goat.\n\nSo, per animal, cows produce three times what goats do since 15 divided by 5 is 3.\n\nBut the number of cows and goats is different, so that might not directly help here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the total milk production per type of animal and then find the difference.\n\nAgain, that leads me back to the initial method.\n\nI think the answer is 140 liters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]"
