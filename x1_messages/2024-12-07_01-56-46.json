        "content": "So if a car depreciates by 20% each year, and its initial value is $25,000, I need to find out what its value will be after 5 years. Depreciation means the value is decreasing over time, right? So, 20% less each year.\n\nFirst, I should understand what 20% depreciation per year means. If something depreciates by 20% each year, it means that each year, it's worth 80% of its value from the previous year. Because 100% - 20% = 80%.\n\nSo, if the initial value is $25,000, after the first year, it would be 80% of $25,000. Then, after the second year, it's 80% of the value at the end of the first year, and so on, for 5 years.\n\nLet me try to calculate that step by step.\n\nYear 0: $25,000\n\nYear 1: $25,000 * 0.8 = $20,000\n\nYear 2: $20,000 * 0.8 = $16,000\n\nYear 3: $16,000 * 0.8 = $12,800\n\nYear 4: $12,800 * 0.8 = $10,240\n\nYear 5: $10,240 * 0.8 = $8,192\n\nSo, after 5 years, the car would be worth $8,192.\n\nBut maybe there's a formula to calculate this more directly, without having to do it year by year.\n\nI recall that for exponential decay, which depreciation is a form of, the formula is:\n\nFinal Value = Initial Value * (1 - depreciation rate)^number of periods\n\nIn this case, Initial Value = $25,000, depreciation rate = 20% or 0.2, and number of periods = 5 years.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nFinal Value = $25,000 * (1 - 0.2)^5 = $25,000 * (0.8)^5\n\nCalculating 0.8 to the power of 5:\n\n0.8^1 = 0.8\n\n0.8^2 = 0.64\n\n0.8^3 = 0.512\n\n0.8^4 = 0.4096\n\n0.8^5 = 0.32768\n\nSo, Final Value = $25,000 * 0.32768 = $8,192\n\nThat matches what I calculated earlier, year by year. So, $8,192 is the value after 5 years.\n\nBut wait, I've heard of something called straight-line depreciation, where the value decreases by a fixed amount each year, not a percentage. But in this case, it's saying the car depreciates by 20% each year, which suggests it's percentage-based, not fixed amount.\n\nJust to confirm, if it were straight-line depreciation of 20% per year, that would mean it loses 20% of its initial value each year, so $25,000 * 0.2 = $5,000 per year.\n\nSo, after 5 years, it would have lost 5 * $5,000 = $25,000, which would make the value zero. But that doesn't make sense, because in reality, a car still has some value after 5 years.\n\nSo, that confirms that it's not straight-line depreciation but rather declining balance, where the depreciation is based on the previous year's value.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is the exponential decay method, and the value after 5 years is $8,192.\n\nWait, but $8,192 seems a bit low. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting at $25,000:\n\nYear 1: $25,000 * 0.8 = $20,000\n\nYear 2: $20,000 * 0.8 = $16,000\n\nYear 3: $16,000 * 0.8 = $12,800\n\nYear 4: $12,800 * 0.8 = $10,240\n\nYear 5: $10,240 * 0.8 = $8,192\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nFinal Value = $25,000 * (0.8)^5 = $25,000 * 0.32768 = $8,192\n\nSo, it's consistent.\n\nMaybe I'm thinking that $8,192 is low because intuitively, I think cars hold more value after 5 years, but according to this calculation, that's the value after depreciating by 20% each year.\n\nPerhaps in reality, depreciation isn't exactly 20% each year, or maybe it's not compounded annually. Different assets have different depreciation methods.\n\nBut based on the information given, assuming 20% depreciation per year compounded annually, the value after 5 years is $8,192.\n\nI should also consider if there's a residual value or some minimum value the car can depreciate to, but the problem doesn't specify that, so I'll assume it's just depreciated down to $8,192.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the depreciation is based on a straight-line percentage of the initial value, but as I thought earlier, that would result in a value of zero after 5 years, which doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, I think the exponential decay method is the correct approach here.\n\nTherefore, the value of the car after 5 years is $8,192.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8192} \\]"
