        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a class of 30 students. Out of these, 12 play basketball, 18 play soccer, and 8 play both sports. We need to find out how many students don't play any sports.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many students play at least one of the sports, and then subtract that number from the total number of students to find those who don't play any sports.\n\nSo, 12 play basketball and 18 play soccer. If I add those together, that's 12 + 18 = 30. But wait, that's the same as the total number of students. So, does that mean that all students play at least one sport? But then, there are 8 who play both sports. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nI recall that when you have two overlapping sets, you can't just add the number of people in each set because those who are in both are counted twice. So, to get the total number of students who play at least one sport, I should add the number of basketball players and the number of soccer players, and then subtract those who play both, so they are only counted once.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of students who play at least one sport = (Number who play basketball) + (Number who play soccer) - (Number who play both)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n= 12 + 18 - 8\n\n= 30 - 8\n\n= 22\n\nSo, 22 students play at least one sport.\n\nNow, to find the number of students who don't play any sports, I subtract the number who play at least one sport from the total number of students:\n\nNumber of students who don't play any sports = Total students - Those who play at least one sport\n\n= 30 - 22\n\n= 8\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. I might be missing something.\n\nAnother way to look at this is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The formula for the union of two sets is:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nWhere:\n\n- |A| is the number of elements in set A (basketball players)\n\n- |B| is the number of elements in set B (soccer players)\n\n- |A \u2229 B| is the number of elements in both sets (play both sports)\n\n- |A \u222a B| is the number of elements in either set A or set B or both\n\nIn this case:\n\n- |A| = 12\n\n- |B| = 18\n\n- |A \u2229 B| = 8\n\nSo, |A \u222a B| = 12 + 18 - 8 = 22\n\nTotal students are 30, so students who don't play any sports are 30 - 22 = 8\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut let me consider if there could be students who play other sports not mentioned here. The problem only talks about basketball and soccer, so I assume that's all the sports being considered. If there were other sports, it would probably say so.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the numbers make sense. There are 12 basketball players and 18 soccer players, with 8 playing both. That means there are 12 - 8 = 4 who only play basketball, and 18 - 8 = 10 who only play soccer. Adding those up: 4 (only basketball) + 10 (only soccer) + 8 (both) = 22, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, total students playing at least one sport is 22, and therefore, 30 - 22 = 8 students don't play any sports.\n\nI think that's the answer: 8 students do not play any sports.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
