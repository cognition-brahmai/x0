        "content": "So the factory produces 500 units per day and operates for 20 days each month. To find out how many units it produces in a year, we need to calculate the monthly production first and then multiply that by the number of months in a year.\n\nFirst, let's find the monthly production:\n\nUnits per day: 500\n\nOperating days per month: 20\n\nSo, monthly production = 500 units/day * 20 days/month = 10,000 units/month\n\nNow, there are 12 months in a year, so:\n\nYearly production = 10,000 units/month * 12 months/year = 120,000 units/year\n\nWait a minute, but I should consider if the factory operates the same number of days every month. Sometimes months have more days than others, but according to the problem, it's operating for 20 days each month, so that simplifies things.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the annual production based on days. There are 365 days in a year, but the factory only operates for 20 days each month. Let's see:\n\nOperating days per month: 20\n\nNumber of months: 12\n\nTotal operating days in a year: 20 days/month * 12 months/year = 240 days/year\n\nUnits produced per day: 500\n\nSo, yearly production = 500 units/day * 240 days/year = 120,000 units/year\n\nThat matches the earlier calculation.\n\nBut maybe I should consider leap years. In a leap year, there are 366 days, but since the factory operates for a fixed number of days per month (20 days), it's still 20 days/month * 12 months = 240 days/year.\n\nSo, whether it's a leap year or not, the operating days are the same based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 120,000 units in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120000} \\]"
