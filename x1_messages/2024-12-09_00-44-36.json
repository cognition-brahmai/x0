These countries include Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and France (through its overseas department of French Guiana). After traversing this vast area, the Amazon River finally empties into the Atlantic Ocean. The mouth of the river is characterized by a broad delta where the freshwater mixes with the saltwater of the ocean, creating a unique ecosystem known as an estuary."
