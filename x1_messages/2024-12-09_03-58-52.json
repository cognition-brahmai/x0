        "content": "To determine how long it will take for the car to travel 180 miles at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, we can use the formula for time, which is derived from the relationship between distance, speed, and time. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} \\]\n\nGiven that the distance is 180 miles and the speed is 60 miles per hour, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{180 \\text{ miles}}{60 \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]\n\nNow, performing the division:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take the car 3 hours to travel 180 miles at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- **Units:** It's important to ensure that the units for distance and speed are compatible. In this case, both are in miles and miles per hour, respectively, which allows the units to cancel out, leaving hours as the unit for time.\n\n- **Constant Speed:** The problem states that the car travels at a constant speed, which means that the speed does not change during the journey. This assumption is crucial for the accuracy of the calculation.\n\n- **Real-World Considerations:** In real-world scenarios, factors such as speed variations, stops, and different units of measurement might affect the calculation. However, for this straightforward problem, we can ignore such complications.\n\n- **Alternative Calculation Methods:** While the formula \\(\\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}}\\) is the most direct approach, one could also use the formula \\(\\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time}\\) and solve for time by rearranging the equation.\n\n- **Dimensional Analysis:** Using dimensional analysis, we can confirm that the units in the formula are consistent. Miles in the numerator and miles per hour in the denominator result in hours, which is the correct unit for time.\n\n- **Graphical Representation:** On a distance-time graph, constant speed is represented by a straight line, where the slope of the line corresponds to the speed. The time taken to reach a certain distance can be found by looking at the corresponding time value on the graph.\n\n- **Comparative Analysis:** If the speed were different, the time taken would change accordingly. For example, at 30 miles per hour, the time would be 6 hours for the same distance.\n\n- **Unit Conversion:** If the speed was given in different units, such as kilometers per hour, we would need to convert either the speed or the distance to match units before performing the calculation.\n\n- **Formula Recall:** Remembering the basic formulas related to motion, such as those involving distance, speed, and time, is essential for solving problems in physics and everyday life.\n\n- **Problem-Solving Skills:** This type of problem helps in developing fundamental problem-solving skills, including identifying given information, determining the required unknown, selecting the appropriate formula, and performing calculations accurately.\n\n- **Critical Thinking:** Understanding why the formula works and being able to apply it in different contexts demonstrates critical thinking and analytical skills.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
