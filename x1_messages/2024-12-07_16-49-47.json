        "content": "So the car factory makes 15 cars every hour, right? And we want to know how many cars it will make in 45 days, with the factory working 10 hours each day. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many cars are produced in one day. Since the factory operates for 10 hours each day and produces 15 cars per hour, I can multiply the number of hours by the number of cars per hour to get the daily production.\n\nSo, cars per day = hours per day \u00d7 cars per hour\nThat would be 10 hours \u00d7 15 cars/hour = 150 cars per day.\n\nNow, to find out the total production over 45 days, I need to multiply the daily production by the number of days.\n\nTotal cars = cars per day \u00d7 number of days\nSo, 150 cars/day \u00d7 45 days.\n\nLet me do that multiplication. 150 \u00d7 45.\n\nI can calculate this as (150 \u00d7 40) + (150 \u00d7 5) = 6000 + 750 = 6750.\n\nSo, the factory will produce 6750 cars in 45 days.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's an easier way to calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nTotal cars = hours per day \u00d7 cars per hour \u00d7 number of days\n\nSo, 10 hours/day \u00d7 15 cars/hour \u00d7 45 days.\n\nFirst, 10 \u00d7 15 = 150, and then 150 \u00d7 45 = 6750.\n\nYeah, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could arrange the multiplication differently, but the result should be the same.\n\nSo, the final answer is 6750 cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6750} \\]"
