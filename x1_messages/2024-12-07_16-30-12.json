        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a family with 7 children, and each child has at least one brother and one sister. We need to find the minimum number of boys and girls in the family.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. We need to find the smallest possible numbers of boys and girls such that no child is left without at least one brother and one sister.\n\nLet's start by considering the minimum number of boys. If we have at least two boys, then each boy has at least one brother. Similarly, if we have at least one girl, each boy has at least one sister. But wait, we need each child to have at least one brother and one sister.\n\nSo, if we have at least two boys and at least two girls, then:\n\n- Each boy has at least one brother and at least one sister.\n\n- Each girl has at least one brother and at least one sister.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the minimum number of boys and girls. So, perhaps we can have fewer than two of one gender.\n\nLet's consider having only one boy and the rest girls. That would be 1 boy and 6 girls. In this case:\n\n- The boy has 6 sisters, so he has at least one sister.\n\n- Each girl has one brother (the single boy), so they have at least one brother.\n\n- However, each girl would have sisters, but the condition is that each child has at least one brother and one sister. For the girls, having one brother and at least one sister is satisfied since there are 6 girls.\n\nWait a minute, does this satisfy the condition for the boy? The boy has 6 sisters, which is fine, and he has no brothers since he's the only boy. But the problem states that each child has at least one brother and one sister. So, the boy would have no brothers, which violates the condition.\n\nTherefore, having only one boy is not sufficient because the boy would not have a brother.\n\nSimilarly, if we have only one girl and six boys, the girl would have six brothers, which is fine, but each boy would have only one sister and five brothers. Wait, no, each boy would have five brothers and one sister. So, each boy has at least one brother and one sister, and the girl has six brothers. This seems to satisfy the condition.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"each child has at least one brother and one sister.\" In this scenario, with one girl and six boys:\n\n- The girl has six brothers.\n\n- Each boy has five brothers and one sister.\n\nSo, all children have at least one brother and one sister. This seems to work.\n\nSimilarly, if we have two boys and five girls:\n\n- Each boy has one brother and five sisters.\n\n- Each girl has two brothers and four sisters.\n\nThis also satisfies the condition, but it has more boys than the previous scenario.\n\nWait, but in the one girl and six boys scenario, the girl has six brothers, which is fine, and each boy has one sister and five brothers. That satisfies the condition.\n\nSimilarly, one boy and six girls would not work because the boy has no brothers, which violates the condition.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of boys is one, but that doesn't work because the boy has no brothers. So, we need at least two boys.\n\nWait, no, in the one girl and six boys scenario, each boy has five brothers, which is more than one. So, they have at least one brother and one sister. The girl has six brothers. So, that should work.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that one boy and six girls wouldn't work because the boy has no brothers, but in this case, it's one girl and six boys.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing myself.\n\nLet me rephrase:\n\n- If there is one girl and six boys:\n\n- The girl has six brothers.\n\n- Each boy has five brothers and one sister.\n\n- So, all children have at least one brother and one sister.\n\n- If there is one boy and six girls:\n\n- The boy has six sisters.\n\n- Each girl has one brother and five sisters.\n\n- But the boy has no brothers, which violates the condition.\n\nTherefore, one boy and six girls does not work because the boy has no brothers.\n\nTherefore, to ensure that each child has at least one brother and one sister, we need at least two boys and at least two girls.\n\nWait, but in the one girl and six boys scenario, it seems to work because the boy has five brothers.\n\nWait, no, each boy has five brothers and one sister. So, they have at least one brother and one sister. The girl has six brothers. So, that works.\n\nBut according to the condition, each child must have at least one brother and one sister.\n\nSo, in the one girl and six boys scenario:\n\n- The girl has six brothers.\n\n- Each boy has five brothers and one sister.\n\nSo, all children have at least one brother and one sister.\n\nSimilarly, in the one boy and six girls scenario:\n\n- The boy has six sisters.\n\n- Each girl has one brother and five sisters.\n\n- But the boy has no brothers, which violates the condition.\n\nTherefore, the minimal configuration is one girl and six boys, which gives us at least two boys (since one boy would not suffice) and at least one girl.\n\nWait, but in the one girl and six boys scenario, there are six boys, which is more than two.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet's consider the minimal number of boys and girls such that each child has at least one brother and one sister.\n\nLet's denote the number of boys as b and the number of girls as g, with b + g = 7.\n\nWe need:\n\n- For each boy: at least one brother and one sister.\n\n- For each girl: at least one brother and one sister.\n\nSo, for boys:\n\n- Each boy has b - 1 brothers and g sisters.\n\n- So, b - 1 >= 1 and g >= 1.\n\n- Therefore, b >= 2 and g >= 1.\n\nSimilarly, for girls:\n\n- Each girl has g - 1 sisters and b brothers.\n\n- So, g - 1 >= 1 and b >= 1.\n\n- Therefore, g >= 2 and b >= 1.\n\nCombining these, we have b >= 2 and g >= 2.\n\nTherefore, the minimal numbers are b = 2 and g = 5, or g = 2 and b = 5.\n\nWait, but b + g = 7.\n\nSo, if b = 2, then g = 5.\n\nIf b = 3, g = 4.\n\nIf b = 4, g = 3.\n\nIf b = 5, g = 2.\n\nSo, the minimal number of boys is 2 and girls is 5, or boys is 5 and girls is 2.\n\nBut actually, the minimal number in terms of the smallest value is 2.\n\nBut perhaps the question is asking for the minimal number of boys and girls separately.\n\nWait, the question is: \"What is the minimum number of boys and girls in the family?\"\n\nSo, perhaps it's asking for the minimal number of boys and the minimal number of girls.\n\nFrom the earlier analysis, we have b >= 2 and g >= 2.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of boys is 2 and the minimal number of girls is 2.\n\nBut that would total only 4 children, whereas the family has 7 children.\n\nWait, no, b + g = 7, with b >= 2 and g >= 2.\n\nSo, the minimal b is 2, which implies g = 5.\n\nOr minimal g is 2, which implies b = 5.\n\nSo, in either case, the minimal number is 2 for one gender and 5 for the other.\n\nBut perhaps the question is asking for the minimal number of boys and girls collectively.\n\nWait, the question is: \"What is the minimum number of boys and girls in the family?\"\n\nI think it's asking for the minimal number of boys and the minimal number of girls separately.\n\nGiven that, the minimal number of boys is 2 and the minimal number of girls is 2.\n\nBut in a family of 7 children, with b + g = 7, and b >= 2, g >= 2.\n\nSo, possible distributions are:\n\n- b = 2, g = 5\n\n- b = 3, g = 4\n\n- b = 4, g = 3\n\n- b = 5, g = 2\n\nIn all these cases, the minimal number of boys is 2 and the minimal number of girls is 2.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of boys and girls in the family is 2 each.\n\nBut wait, in the b = 2 and g = 5 case, the minimal number of boys is 2 and girls is 5.\n\nSimilarly, in b = 5 and g = 2, boys are 5 and girls are 2.\n\nSo, the minimal number is 2 for the smaller group.\n\nI think the answer should be that there are at least 2 boys and 2 girls in the family.\n\nWait, but in the b = 2 and g = 5 case, there are 2 boys and 5 girls.\n\nSimilarly, in b = 5 and g = 2, there are 5 boys and 2 girls.\n\nSo, in both cases, the minimal number is 2 for one gender.\n\nBut the question is asking for the minimal number of boys and girls in the family.\n\nI think the answer is that there are at least 2 boys and 2 girls in the family, with the total being 7 children.\n\nSo, the minimal numbers are 2 boys and 2 girls, with the remaining children being of the other gender.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of boys and girls in the family is 2 each.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
