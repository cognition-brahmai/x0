        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a car's trip. Let me try to understand what's going on. The car first travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours. Then it stops for an hour to refuel and rest. After that, it continues its journey at a constant speed of 80 miles per hour for another 2 hours. I need to find the average speed of the car during the entire trip.\n\nAlright, first things first, I know that average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, I need to find the total distance the car traveled and the total time it took, including the stop.\n\nLet me calculate the distance for each part of the trip. For the first part, the car travels at 60 miles per hour for 3 hours. So, distance equals speed times time, right? So, 60 miles per hour times 3 hours is 180 miles.\n\nThen, the car stops for an hour. During this hour, it doesn't travel any distance, so the distance is zero for this part.\n\nAfter that, the car travels at 80 miles per hour for 2 hours. Again, distance equals speed times time, so 80 miles per hour times 2 hours is 160 miles.\n\nNow, the total distance is the sum of these distances: 180 miles plus 0 miles plus 160 miles, which equals 340 miles.\n\nNext, the total time is the sum of all the time intervals: 3 hours plus 1 hour plus 2 hours, which equals 6 hours.\n\nSo, the average speed is total distance divided by total time, which is 340 miles divided by 6 hours. Let me do that calculation: 340 divided by 6 is approximately 56.67 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that when calculating average speed, you might need to consider the total time, including stops. Let me double-check that.\n\nYes, average speed is indeed total distance over total time, and total time includes the stop time. So, 340 miles in 6 hours is about 56.67 miles per hour.\n\nBut maybe I should check if there's another way to look at it. Perhaps using the harmonic mean or something, but I think for average speed, the total distance over total time is the correct approach.\n\nLet me see if there's another perspective. Suppose I think about the average speed for each segment and then find some kind of weighted average, but I think that would complicate things unnecessarily when the straightforward method is available.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the average speed during the moving periods only and then account for the stop separately, but that seems more complicated.\n\nNo, I think sticking with the basic definition is best. Total distance is 340 miles, total time is 6 hours, so average speed is 340/6 = 56.67 miles per hour.\n\nPerhaps I should consider significant figures or see if the answer needs to be in a specific format, but the question doesn't specify, so I'll leave it as 56.67 miles per hour.\n\nOne more thing: I should make sure that I haven't missed any parts of the trip. Let's list out the segments again:\n\n1. Traveling at 60 mph for 3 hours: 180 miles\n\n2. Stop for 1 hour: 0 miles\n\n3. Traveling at 80 mph for 2 hours: 160 miles\n\nTotal distance: 180 + 0 + 160 = 340 miles\n\nTotal time: 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 hours\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've got it. The average speed for the entire trip is approximately 56.67 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{56.\\overline{6} \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]"
