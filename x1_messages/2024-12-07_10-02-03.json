        "content": "So the national park wants to improve visitor experience by adding more parking spaces near popular hiking trails. They currently have 200 parking spots and they want to increase this number by 50%. But there's a catch: due to environmental concerns, they can only add new parking spaces within existing paved areas. I need to calculate the additional square footage needed for these new parking spaces, and each space requires 180 square feet, including driving lanes.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many additional parking spaces they're planning to add. They want to increase the current number by 50%, so I need to calculate 50% of 200.\n\n50% of 200 is calculated as:\n\n(50/100) * 200 = 0.5 * 200 = 100\n\nSo, they want to add 100 additional parking spaces.\n\nNext, each parking space requires 180 square feet, including driving lanes. Therefore, to find out the total additional square footage needed, I need to multiply the number of additional spaces by the square footage per space.\n\nAdditional square footage = number of additional spaces * square footage per space\n\nAdditional square footage = 100 * 180 = 18,000 square feet\n\nSo, they need an additional 18,000 square feet of paved area to accommodate the new parking spaces.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that they can only add new parking spaces within existing paved areas. Does that mean they have to repurpose some existing paved areas that are currently used for other purposes, or that they have a certain amount of existing paved area that isn't being used for parking yet?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify what the existing paved areas are used for beyond the current 200 parking spaces. It just says that new parking spaces can only be added within existing paved areas.\n\nAssuming that the existing paved areas include the current parking spaces and possibly some additional paved areas that aren't currently used for parking, the park might need to see if the additional 18,000 square feet is available within those existing paved areas.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't provide information about the total existing paved area, I'll focus on calculating the additional square footage needed for the new parking spaces, which is 18,000 square feet, as shown above.\n\nIn summary:\n\n1. Calculate the number of additional parking spaces: 50% of 200 = 100 spaces\n\n2. Each parking space requires 180 square feet\n\n3. Additional square footage needed: 100 spaces * 180 sq ft/space = 18,000 sq ft\n\nTherefore, the national park needs an additional 18,000 square feet of paved area to accommodate the new parking spaces.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18000} \\]"
