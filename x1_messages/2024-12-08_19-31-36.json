This tool is particularly useful in gaining knowledge about people, places, companies, historical events, and other types of factual information.\nQA[input]: Tool that can answer questions either directly from common sense and general world knowledge, as well as answering questions given input context that may contain the answer.\n\nEach plan should be followed by exactly one evidence (#E[index]) value.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n#E1 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of #E1]\n#E2 = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context #E1\"]\n...\nFinal answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: What is the average temperature in July for the city that hosts the largest annual jazz festival?"
