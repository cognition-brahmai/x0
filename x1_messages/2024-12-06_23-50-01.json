        "content": "So there are two trains, one leaving from station A going towards station B, and the other leaving from station B going towards station A. The first train is moving at 60 miles per hour, and the second one at 80 miles per hour. The distance between station A and station B is 210 miles. I need to find out how long it will take for these two trains to meet each other.\n\nAlright, let's see. This seems like a problem involving relative speed. When two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speeds add up. So, the combined speed at which they are approaching each other is the sum of their individual speeds.\n\nSo, the combined speed is 60 mph + 80 mph = 140 mph.\n\nNow, the distance between them is 210 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 210 miles / 140 mph\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n210 divided by 140 is 1.5 hours.\n\nSo, it will take 1.5 hours for the two trains to meet.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother way is to consider the distance each train covers over time and set up an equation where the sum of the distances equals the total distance between the stations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time taken to meet as t hours.\n\nThen, the distance covered by the first train in t hours is 60t miles.\n\nThe distance covered by the second train in t hours is 80t miles.\n\nThe sum of these distances should be equal to the total distance between the stations, which is 210 miles.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n60t + 80t = 210\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n140t = 210\n\nNow, solving for t:\n\nt = 210 / 140\n\nt = 1.5 hours\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the time into minutes to make it more understandable. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 1.5 hours is equal to 1 hour and 30 minutes.\n\nSo, the trains will meet after 1 hour and 30 minutes.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way to look at this. Maybe using relative speed concepts from physics.\n\nIn physics, when two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed is indeed the sum of their individual speeds, which is what I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could choose one train as stationary and have the other train moving at the combined speed.\n\nFor example, if I consider the train from station A as stationary, then the train from station B is effectively moving towards it at 140 mph, covering the 210 miles between them.\n\nAgain, time = distance / speed = 210 / 140 = 1.5 hours.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I end up with the same answer.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the two trains will meet after 1.5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
