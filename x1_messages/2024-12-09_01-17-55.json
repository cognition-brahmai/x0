        "content": "Let's see. There are 6 people in the family: 4 children and 2 parents. Each child has 1 brother and 3 sisters. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing at first, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, we know there are 4 children in total. Now, each child has 1 brother and 3 sisters. Wait a minute, if each child has 1 brother and 3 sisters, that means that among the children, there is only 1 brother shared among them, and 3 sisters.\n\nBut hold on, if there is only 1 brother, that means there is only 1 boy among the children. But that wouldn't make sense because if there is only 1 boy, then each girl would have no brothers or 1 brother, depending on how you look at it.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Let's consider that each child has 1 brother and 3 sisters. So, for any child, there are 1 brother and 3 sisters besides themselves.\n\nSo, if a child has 1 brother and 3 sisters, that means, excluding themselves, there are 1 brother and 3 sisters, totaling 4 siblings excluding themselves. But since there are 4 children in total, including themselves, that would make 5 children, which contradicts the given information that there are 4 children.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nLet me try again. If each child has 1 brother and 3 sisters, then the total number of siblings excluding themselves is 1 brother + 3 sisters = 4 siblings. Adding themselves back, that would make 5 children, but we know there are only 4 children. This seems inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the children are referring to each other correctly. Let's think about it differently.\n\nSuppose there are B boys and G girls among the 4 children, so B + G = 4.\n\nNow, for any girl, her siblings would be B brothers and G - 1 sisters.\n\nSimilarly, for any boy, his siblings would be B - 1 brothers and G sisters.\n\nAccording to the problem, each child has 1 brother and 3 sisters.\n\nWait, but if each child has 1 brother and 3 sisters, that suggests that for both boys and girls, the number of brothers and sisters is the same.\n\nWait a minute, is that possible? Let's see.\n\nIf a girl has 1 brother and 3 sisters, that means B = 1 and G - 1 = 3, so G = 4.\n\nBut B + G = 4, so if G = 4, then B = 0, which contradicts B = 1.\n\nWait, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the brother is shared among the sisters. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nSuppose there is 1 boy and 3 girls. Then, for each girl, she has 1 brother (the boy) and 2 sisters (the other girls). But according to the problem, each child has 1 brother and 3 sisters, which doesn't match this scenario.\n\nWait, because in this case, each girl would have 1 brother and 2 sisters, not 3 sisters.\n\nSo, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if there are 2 boys and 2 girls.\n\nThen, for each girl, she would have 2 brothers and 1 sister.\n\nBut the problem states that each child has 1 brother and 3 sisters, which doesn't match this.\n\nWait, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, if there are 3 boys and 1 girl.\n\nThen, for each girl, she would have 3 brothers and no sisters, which again doesn't match.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit either.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the problem.\n\nThere are 4 children: B boys and G girls, with B + G = 4.\n\nEach child has 1 brother and 3 sisters.\n\nSo, for each child, the number of brothers is 1 and the number of sisters is 3.\n\nBut according to the earlier analysis, none of the possible combinations of B and G satisfy this condition.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the children are referring to half-brothers or something, but no, the problem states it's a normal family with 2 parents.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the brothers and sisters are referred to in a certain way that I'm missing.\n\nWait, maybe \"each child has 1 brother and 3 sisters\" means that each child has a total of 1 brother and 3 sisters besides their parents.\n\nSo, total siblings excluding parents.\n\nSo, total children are 4.\n\nEach child has 1 brother and 3 sisters.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the total number of brothers and sisters for each child is 1 + 3 = 4, which is the total number of children excluding themselves.\n\nBut that would mean that for each child, there are 4 siblings.\n\nBut since there are 4 children in total, excluding themselves, that's correct.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried to set up equations, it didn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the children are cousins or something, but no, the problem states it's a family with 2 parents and 4 children.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some of the siblings are from previous marriages or something, but the problem doesn't suggest that.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is phrased incorrectly or there's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the brothers and sisters are only among the siblings, excluding parents.\n\nWait, but that's already assumed.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose there are B boys and G girls, with B + G = 4.\n\nNow, for any child, the number of brothers is B - 1 (excluding themselves).\n\nAnd the number of sisters is G.\n\nAccording to the problem, each child has 1 brother and 3 sisters.\n\nSo, for boys: brothers = B - 1 = 1, and sisters = G = 3.\n\nSimilarly, for girls: brothers = B = 1, and sisters = G - 1 = 3.\n\nWait, but if B - 1 = 1, then B = 2.\n\nAnd G = 3.\n\nBut B = 2 and G = 3 would total 5 children, which contradicts the given total of 4 children.\n\nWait, no, B + G = 2 + 3 = 5, but the total number of children is given as 4.\n\nSo, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that each child has at least 1 brother and 3 sisters, but that still doesn't make sense with the total number of children being 4.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that each child has exactly 1 brother and at least 3 sisters.\n\nBut that still doesn't resolve the inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is misstated, and it should be that each child has 1 brother and 2 sisters.\n\nThen, with B + G = 4.\n\nFor boys: B - 1 = 1 => B = 2.\n\nAnd G = 2.\n\nFor girls: B = 2 brothers, and G - 1 = 1 sister.\n\nBut the problem says each child has 1 brother and 3 sisters.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the brothers and sisters are counted including themselves.\n\nWait, no, typically, brothers and sisters are counted excluding themselves.\n\nBut maybe the problem includes themselves.\n\nWait, let's check that.\n\nIf the problem says \"each child has 1 brother and 3 sisters,\" does that include themselves or not?\n\nNormally, brothers and sisters are exclusive of oneself.\n\nSo, I think they are exclusive.\n\nGiven that, and the earlier contradictions, perhaps there is no solution, meaning such a family configuration doesn't exist.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that some children share the same parents while others don't, but the problem states it's a family of 6 people with 2 parents and 4 children, so presumably all children are full siblings.\n\nWait, but in that case, if all children are full siblings, then each child should have the same number of brothers and sisters.\n\nSo, if each child has 1 brother and 3 sisters, that implies that there is consistency across all children.\n\nBut as we've seen, no combination of B and G adding up to 4 satisfies B - 1 = 1 and G = 3 for boys, and B = 1 and G - 1 = 3 for girls.\n\nSince B - 1 = 1 implies B = 2, and G = 3, but then B + G = 5, which is more than the 4 children available.\n\nAlternatively, if B = 2 and G = 2, then for boys: brothers = 1, sisters = 2.\n\nFor girls: brothers = 2, sisters = 1.\n\nBut the problem states that each child has 1 brother and 3 sisters, which doesn't match this.\n\nTherefore, it seems like there is no solution to this problem as stated.\n\nPerhaps there is a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I'm missing something obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the family includes half-siblings or step-siblings, but the problem doesn't suggest that.\n\nGiven the information provided, it appears that such a family configuration is impossible.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that there is no such family with 4 children where each child has 1 brother and 3 sisters, given that there are only 4 children in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{No such family exists.}} \\]"
