Ichor is often described as a golden, ethereal fluid that is associated with the divine nature of the gods. It is considered to be a life-giving substance that contributes to their immortality and supernatural abilities. The concept of ichor highlights the distinct nature of the gods compared to mortals, emphasizing their eternal and exalted status in the mythological hierarchy."
