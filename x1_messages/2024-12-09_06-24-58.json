        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains here, one leaving Station A at 8 am going towards Station B, and another leaving Station B at 9 am going towards Station A. The distance between the stations is 480 miles. I need to find out when they meet.\n\nFirst, I should note down the details:\n\n- Train from A: leaves at 8 am, speed 60 mph\n\n- Train from B: leaves at 9 am, speed 80 mph\n\n- Distance between A and B: 480 miles\n\nSince the trains are moving towards each other, their speeds will add up when calculating how quickly the distance between them is closing. So, the combined speed is 60 mph + 80 mph = 140 mph.\n\nBut wait, the trains start at different times. The train from A starts an hour earlier than the train from B.\n\nSo, from 8 am to 9 am, only the train from A is moving. It's going at 60 mph, so in that one hour, it covers 60 miles. That means, by the time the train from B starts at 9 am, the remaining distance between the two trains is 480 miles - 60 miles = 420 miles.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other starting at 9 am, with a combined speed of 140 mph. So, the time it takes for them to cover the remaining 420 miles is:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed = 420 miles / 140 mph = 3 hours.\n\nTherefore, they will meet 3 hours after 9 am, which is at 12 pm.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider the time variable more carefully.\n\nLet t be the time in hours after 9 am when the trains meet.\n\nSo, the train from A has been traveling for t + 1 hours (since it started at 8 am), and the train from B has been traveling for t hours.\n\nThe distance covered by the train from A is 60 mph * (t + 1) hours.\n\nThe distance covered by the train from B is 80 mph * t hours.\n\nThe sum of these distances should equal the total distance between the stations, which is 480 miles.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n60(t + 1) + 80t = 480\n\nNow, let's solve for t:\n\n60t + 60 + 80t = 480\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n140t + 60 = 480\n\nSubtract 60 from both sides:\n\n140t = 420\n\nDivide both sides by 140:\n\nt = 420 / 140 = 3 hours.\n\nSo, again, t = 3 hours. Therefore, the trains meet at 9 am + 3 hours = 12 pm.\n\nThis matches my earlier conclusion. So, the answer should be 12 pm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12 \\text{ pm}} \\]"
