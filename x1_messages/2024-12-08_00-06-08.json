What, John Rugby! \n[Enter RUGBY.]\nI pray thee go to the casement, and see if you can see my master, Master Doctor Caius, coming: if he do, i' faith, and find anybody in the house, here will be an old abusing of God's patience and the King's English.\nRUGBY. I'll go watch.\nQUICKLY. Go; and we'll have a posset for't soon at night, in faith, at the latter end of a sea-coal fire.\n[Exit RUGBY.]\nAn honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant shall come in house withal; and, I warrant you, no tell-tale nor no breed-bate; his worst fault is that he is given to prayer; he is something peevish that way; but nobody but has his fault; but let that pass. Peter Simple you say your name is?\nSIMPLE. Ay, for fault of a better.\nQUICKLY. And Master Slender's your master?\nSIMPLE. Ay, forsooth.\nQUICKLY. Does he not wear a great round beard, like a glover's paring-knife?\nSIMPLE. No, forsooth; he hath but a little whey face, with a little yellow beard--a cane-coloured beard.\nQUICKLY. A softly-sprighted man, is he not?\nSIMPLE. Ay, forsooth; but he is as tall a man of his hands as any is between this and his head; he hath fought with a warrener.\nQUICKLY. How say you?--O! I should remember him. Does he not hold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait?\nSIMPLE. Yes, indeed, does he.\nQUICKLY. Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune! Tell Master Parson Evans I will do what I can for your master: Anne is a good girl, and I wish--\n[Re-enter RUGBY.]\nRUGBY. Out, alas! here comes my master.\nQUICKLY. We shall all be shent. Run in here, good young man; go into this closet. [Shuts SIMPLE in the closet.] He will not stay long. What, John Rugby! John! what, John, I say! Go, John, go inquire for my master; I doubt he be not well that he comes not home. \n[Exit Rugby.]\n[Sings.] And down, down, adown-a, &c.\n[Enter DOCTOR CAIUS.]\nCAIUS. Vat is you sing? I do not like des toys. Pray you, go and vetch me in my closet une boitine verde--a box, a green-a box: do intend vat I speak? a green-a box.\nQUICKLY. Ay, forsooth, I'll fetch it you. [Aside] I am glad he went not in himself: if he had found the young man, he would have been horn-mad.\nCAIUS. Fe, fe, fe fe! ma foi, il fait fort chaud. Je m'en vais a la cour-- la grande affaire.\nQUICKLY. Is it this, sir?\nCAIUS. Oui; mettez le au mon pocket: depechez, quickly--Vere is dat knave, Rugby?\nQUICKLY. What, John Rugby? John!\n[Re-enter Rugby.]\nRUGBY. Here, sir.\nCAIUS. You are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby: come, take-a your rapier, and come after my heel to de court.\nRUGBY. 'Tis ready, sir, here in the porch.\nCAIUS. By my trot, I tarry too long--Od's me! Qu'ay j'oublie? Dere is some simples in my closet dat I vill not for the varld I shall leave behind.\nQUICKLY. [Aside.] Ay me, he'll find the young man there, and be mad!\nCAIUS. O diable, diable! vat is in my closet?--Villainy! larron! [Pulling SIMPLE out.] Rugby, my rapier!\nQUICKLY. Good master, be content.\nCAIUS. Verefore shall I be content-a?\nQUICKLY. The young man is an honest man.\nCAIUS. What shall de honest man do in my closet? dere is no honest man dat shall come in my closet.\nQUICKLY. I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic. Hear the truth of it: he came of an errand to me from Parson Hugh.\nCAIUS. Vell.\nSIMPLE. Ay, forsooth, to desire her to--\nQUICKLY. Peace, I pray you.\nCAIUS. Peace-a your tongue!--Speak-a your tale.\nSIMPLE. To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page for my master, in the way of marriage.\nQUICKLY. This is all, indeed, la! but I'll ne'er put my finger in the fire, and need not.\nCAIUS. Sir Hugh send-a you?--Rugby, baillez me some paper: tarry you a little-a while. [Writes.]\nQUICKLY. I am glad he is so quiet: if he had been throughly moved, you should have heard him so loud and so melancholy. But notwithstanding, man, I'll do you your master what good I can; and the very yea and the no is, the French doctor, my master--I may call him my master, look you, for I keep his house; and I wash, wring, brew, bake, scour, dress meat and drink, make the beds, and do all myself--\nSIMPLE. 'Tis a great charge to come under one body's hand.\nQUICKLY. Are you avis'd o' that? You shall find it a great charge; and to be up early and down late; but notwithstanding,--to tell you in your ear,--I would have no words of it--my master himself is in love with Mistress Anne Page; but notwithstanding that, I know Anne's mind, that's neither here nor there.\nCAIUS. You jack'nape; give-a dis letter to Sir Hugh; by gar, it is a shallenge: I will cut his troat in de Park; and I will teach a scurvy jack-a-nape priest to meddle or make. You may be gone; it is not good you tarry here: by gar, I will cut all his two stones; by gar, he shall not have a stone to throw at his dog.\n[Exit SIMPLE.]\nQUICKLY. Alas, he speaks but for his friend.\nCAIUS. It is no matter-a ver dat:--do not you tell-a me dat I shall have Anne Page for myself? By gar, I vill kill de Jack priest; and I have appointed mine host of de Jartiere to measure our weapon. By gar, I vill myself have Anne Page.\nQUICKLY. Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well. We must give folks leave to prate: what, the good-jer!\nCAIUS. Rugby, come to the court vit me. By gar, if I have not Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my door. Follow my heels, Rugby.\n[Exeunt CAIUS and RUGBY.]\nQUICKLY. You shall have An fool's-head of your own. No, I know Anne's mind for that: never a woman in Windsor knows more of Anne's mind than I do; nor can do more than I do with her, I thank heaven.\nFENTON. [Within.] Who's within there? ho!\nQUICKLY. Who's there, I trow? Come near the house, I pray you.\n[Enter FENTON.]\nFENTON. How now, good woman! how dost thou?\nQUICKLY. The better, that it pleases your good worship to ask.\nFENTON. What news? how does pretty Mistress Anne?\nQUICKLY. In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and gentle; and one that is your friend, I can tell you that by the way; I praise heaven for it.\nFENTON. Shall I do any good, thinkest thou? Shall I not lose my suit?\nQUICKLY. Troth, sir, all is in His hands above; but notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I'll be sworn on a book she loves you. Have not your worship a wart above your eye?\nFENTON. Yes, marry, have I; what of that?\nQUICKLY. Well, thereby hangs a tale; good faith, it is such another Nan; but, I detest, an honest maid as ever broke bread. We had an hour's talk of that wart; I shall never laugh but in that maid's company;--but, indeed, she is given too much to allicholy and musing. But for you --well, go to.\nFENTON. Well, I shall see her to-day. Hold, there's money for thee; let me have thy voice in my behalf: if thou seest her before me, commend me.\nQUICKLY. Will I? i' faith, that we will; and I will tell your worship more of the wart the next time we have confidence; and of other wooers.\nFENTON. Well, farewell; I am in great haste now.\nQUICKLY. Farewell to your worship.--[Exit FENTON.] Truly, an honest gentleman; but Anne loves him not; for I know Anne's mind as well as another does.

        "content": "SUMMARY\nIn this scene from William Shakespeare's \"The Merry Wives of Windsor,\" several characters interact in Doctor Caius's house, revealing their plans and desires, particularly concerning the character Anne Page.\n\nMistress Quickly, who manages Doctor Caius's household, is awaiting Doctor Caius's return. She has Peter Simple, a servant of Master Slender, hidden in a closet because Simple is there on an errand related to courting Anne Page on behalf of Master Slender. Doctor Caius, who is also interested in Anne, enters unexpectedly, and in his search for something in his closet, discovers Simple.\n\nDoctor Caius is initially furious upon finding Simple in his closet but calms down when Mistress Quickly explains that Simple is there on an errand from Parson Hugh (Evans) regarding a marriage proposal to Anne Page for Master Slender. Doctor Caius, despite his initial anger, writes a challenge to Parson Hugh, indicating he intends to duel him, possibly over Anne's affection.\n\nMeanwhile, Mistress Quickly assures Simple that she will do what she can to help his master, though she also reveals that Doctor Caius is in love with Anne Page himself. She seems to know Anne's feelings well and perhaps is manipulating the situation for her own purposes.\n\nAfter Doctor Caius and his servant Rugby leave, Fenton, another suitor of Anne Page, arrives at the house. Mistress Quickly flirts with him and reassures him that Anne loves him, mentioning a wart above his eye, which seems to be a point of attraction for Anne. Fenton gives her money and asks her to speak well of him to Anne.\n\nMistress Quickly, however, seems to be playing both sides, as she acknowledges that Anne does not love Fenton, despite her earlier assertion. This suggests that Mistress Quickly may have her own agenda or biases in these affairs.\n\nThe scene is a mix of comedy and intrigue, showcasing the complexities of romantic entanglements and the meddling of well-meaning or mischievous associates in the lives of the main characters.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **Mistress Quickly manages Doctor Caius's household and is aware of the various suitors pursuing Anne Page.**\n\n- **Peter Simple is hiding in Doctor Caius's closet on an errand from Master Slender to speak to Mistress Quickly about courting Anne.**\n\n- **Doctor Caius discovers Simple and is initially angry but calms down when informed of the reason for his presence.**\n\n- **Doctor Caius writes a challenge to Parson Hugh, indicating he intends to duel him, possibly over Anne's affections.**\n\n- **Mistress Quickly assures Fenton that Anne loves him, but later reveals that Anne does not love Fenton, suggesting her motivations may be ambiguous.**\n\n**Characters:**\n\n- **Mistress Quickly:** The manager of Doctor Caius's household, involved in the romantic intrigues surrounding Anne Page.\n\n- **Peter Simple:** A servant of Master Slender, on an errand to speak to Mistress Quickly about courting Anne.\n\n- **Doctor Caius:** A French doctor and suitor of Anne Page, who discovers Simple in his closet.\n\n- **Rugby:** Doctor Caius's servant.\n\n- **Fenton:** Another suitor of Anne Page, who interacts with Mistress Quickly after the other characters have left.\n\n**Themes:**\n\n- **Romantic Entanglements:** The complexities and rivalries among suitors for Anne Page's hand.\n\n- **Meddling and Intrigue:** The roles of secondary characters in influencing the romantic outcomes.\n\n- **Comedy:** The humorous situations arising from hidden identities and unexpected discoveries.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis scene exemplifies Shakespeare's skill in creating a web of romantic intrigues and comedic misunderstandings. The presence of multiple suitors for Anne Page, combined with the meddling of associates like Mistress Quickly, creates a dynamic and humorous situation. The revelation that Mistress Quickly may not be entirely truthful about Anne's feelings adds an element of mystery and potential deception, suggesting that her motivations are not purely altruistic. Overall, the scene contributes to the play's themes of love, deception, and the complications that arise from multiple suitors pursuing the same goal.\n\n**Contextual Notes:**\n\n- **\"The Merry Wives of Windsor\"** is a Shakespearean comedy that centers around the middle-class citizens of Windsor and their interactions with the nobility and other social classes.\n\n- **Anne Page** is a central character, being pursued by multiple suitors, which drives much of the play's plot and comedy.\n\n- **Mistress Quickly** is a bustling and somewhat promiscuous character who manages various affairs and is involved in the romantic intrigues of the other characters.\n\n- **Doctor Caius** is a French doctor and a suitor of Anne Page, known for his quick temper and his efforts to outdo his rivals.\n\n- **Fenton** is a young gentleman who is also courting Anne Page and is considered by some characters to be a more suitable match for her.\n\n**Literary Devices:**\n\n- **Irony:** Mistress Quickly assures Fenton that Anne loves him, despite later admitting that Anne does not love him, creating ironic situations.\n\n- **Comedy of Manners:** The scene involves social intrigues and the comedic mishaps arising from the characters' attempts to navigate romantic relationships.\n\n- **Characterization:** Each character exhibits distinct traits and motivations, contributing to the richness of the play's humor and plot.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis scene from \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" is a masterclass in Shakespearean comedy, featuring a tangled web of romantic pursuits, meddling servants, and humorous misunderstandings. Through the interactions of Mistress Quickly, Doctor Caius, Peter Simple, and Fenton, Shakespeare explores themes of love, deception, and social dynamics, all while providing entertainment through witty dialogue and comedic situations.\n\n**References:**\n\n- Shakespeare, William. \"The Merry Wives of Windsor.\" In *The Complete Works of William Shakespeare*.
