        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the car first travels at 60 miles per hour for 4 hours. To find out how far it goes in that time, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo for the first part:\n\nDistance\u2081 = 60 mph \u00d7 4 hours = 240 miles\n\nThen, the car increases its speed to 75 mph and travels for another 3 hours. Again, using the same formula:\n\nDistance\u2082 = 75 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 225 miles\n\nNow, to find the total distance traveled, I just need to add these two distances together:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance\u2081 + Distance\u2082 = 240 miles + 225 miles = 465 miles\n\nSo, the car travels a total of 465 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{465} \\]"
