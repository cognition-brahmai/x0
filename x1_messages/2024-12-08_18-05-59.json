        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 8 employees, each working 7 hours a day for 5 days a week. And their hourly wage is $15. I need to find out the total weekly payroll cost for the company.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate how many hours each employee works in a week. Since they work 7 hours a day for 5 days, it should be 7 hours/day times 5 days/week. So, that's 35 hours per week per employee.\n\nNow, each employee earns $15 per hour. So, their weekly earnings would be 35 hours times $15/hour. Let me do that calculation: 35 times 15.\n\nWell, 30 times 15 is 450, and 5 times 15 is 75. So, 450 plus 75 is 525. So, each employee makes $525 per week.\n\nNow, there are 8 employees, so the total weekly payroll would be 8 times $525.\n\nLet me calculate that. 8 times 500 is 4000, and 8 times 25 is 200. So, 4000 plus 200 is 4200.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, if one employee makes $525 per week, and there are 8 employees, it should be 8 times 525.\n\nLet me break it down again. 8 times 500 is 4000, and 8 times 25 is 200. So, 4000 plus 200 is indeed 4200.\n\nSo, the total weekly payroll cost for the company is $4,200.\n\nBut let me just verify all the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, hours per week per employee: 7 hours/day times 5 days/week equals 35 hours/week.\n\nThen, earnings per employee per week: 35 hours times $15/hour equals $525.\n\nThen, total payroll for 8 employees: 8 times $525 equals $4,200.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4200} \\]"
