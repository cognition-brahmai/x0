        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of friends who planned to share a $75 meal equally. But then two friends had to leave early, and the remaining friends split the bill equally among themselves, each paying $15. We need to find out how many friends were there initially.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what's happening here. Initially, there were a certain number of friends who planned to share the $75 meal equally. Let's say there were \\( n \\) friends initially. So, each would have paid \\( \\frac{75}{n} \\) dollars.\n\nBut then, two friends left, so the number of friends remaining is \\( n - 2 \\). These remaining friends decided to split the bill equally among themselves, and each paid $15. So, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[\n(n - 2) \\times 15 = 75\n\\]\n\nThis equation says that the total amount paid by the remaining friends is equal to the total bill of $75.\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\n(n - 2) \\times 15 = 75 \\\\\nn - 2 = \\frac{75}{15} \\\\\nn - 2 = 5 \\\\\nn = 5 + 2 \\\\\nn = 7\n\\]\n\nSo, initially, there were 7 friends.\n\nWait a minute, let me check if this makes sense. If there were 7 friends initially, and two left, that leaves 5 friends. Each of these 5 friends paid $15, so total payment is \\( 5 \\times 15 = 75 \\) dollars, which matches the bill. Seems correct.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at this. Let's consider the amount each friend was supposed to pay initially and see if that leads us to the same answer.\n\nInitially, with \\( n \\) friends, each would pay \\( \\frac{75}{n} \\) dollars.\n\nAfter two friends left, there were \\( n - 2 \\) friends, and each paid $15.\n\nSo, the difference in what each remaining friend paid compared to what they initially agreed to pay might give us another equation.\n\nBut actually, the problem doesn't provide information about how much each friend was supposed to pay initially, only that after two left, each paid $15.\n\nSo, perhaps the first method is the most straightforward and sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about the total cost and how it's divided.\n\nThe total cost is $75.\n\nAfter two friends left, the remaining friends paid $15 each.\n\nSo, the number of remaining friends is \\( \\frac{75}{15} = 5 \\).\n\nTherefore, initially, there were \\( 5 + 2 = 7 \\) friends.\n\nThis matches our previous result.\n\nLet me consider if there could be other interpretations of the problem.\n\nIs there a possibility that the two friends who left had already paid their share before leaving? The problem doesn't specify, so we assume that only the remaining friends paid the bill.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two friends who left had to contribute something to the bill, but the problem says they left early, and the remaining friends split the bill equally among themselves.\n\nSo, it seems fair to assume that only the remaining friends paid the entire bill of $75.\n\nLet me think about whether there could be other solutions.\n\nSuppose we consider that the two friends who left had already paid their share based on the initial agreement, and the remaining friends paid the rest.\n\nBut the problem doesn't indicate that. It seems that the two friends who left did not pay anything, and the remaining friends covered the entire bill.\n\nGiven that, our initial approach seems valid.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the difference in payment due to the two friends leaving.\n\nInitially, each friend was to pay \\( \\frac{75}{n} \\).\n\nAfter two left, each remaining friend paid $15.\n\nSo, the difference per remaining friend is \\( 15 - \\frac{75}{n} \\).\n\nBut without additional information, this might not help us directly.\n\nStick to the first method, which directly gives us \\( n = 7 \\), and it checks out.\n\nTherefore, the initial number of friends was 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
