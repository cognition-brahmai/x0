        "content": "Let's see. The store sells apples for $2 per pound and oranges for $3 per pound. The customer bought 4 pounds of apples and 3 pounds of oranges. To find the total cost, I need to calculate the cost of the apples and the cost of the oranges separately, and then add them together.\n\nFirst, for the apples: 4 pounds at $2 per pound. So, 4 times 2 is 8. That means the apples cost $8.\n\nNext, for the oranges: 3 pounds at $3 per pound. So, 3 times 3 is 9. That means the oranges cost $9.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I add the cost of the apples and the cost of the oranges: 8 plus 9 is 17.\n\nTherefore, the total cost is $17.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]"
