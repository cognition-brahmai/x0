        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. So, you need a TypeScript function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the minimum, maximum, and average values of that array. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to define a function that accepts an array of numbers. In TypeScript, we can specify the type of the array as number[]. So, the function signature might look something like this:\n\n```typescript\nfunction analyzeArray(numbers: number[]): { min: number; max: number; average: number } {\n    // function body\n}\n```\n\nNext, we need to calculate the minimum value in the array. We can use the Math.min function combined with the spread operator to achieve this. However, we need to make sure that the array is not empty to avoid errors.\n\nSimilarly, for the maximum value, we can use Math.max with the spread operator.\n\nFor the average, we need to sum all the numbers in the array and then divide by the length of the array. We can use the reduce function to sum the array elements.\n\nLet's put this all together. Here's a possible implementation:\n\n```typescript\nfunction analyzeArray(numbers: number[]): { min: number; max: number; average: number } {\n    if (numbers.length === 0) {\n        throw new Error(\"Array is empty\");\n    }\n\n    const min = Math.min(...numbers);\n    const max = Math.max(...numbers);\n    const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);\n    const average = sum / numbers.length;\n\n    return { min, max, average };\n}\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the array is empty and throws an error if it is. Then, it calculates the minimum, maximum, and average values as described.\n\nYou can test this function with an array of numbers like this:\n\n```typescript\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst result = analyzeArray(numbers);\nconsole.log(result); // Output: { min: 1, max: 5, average: 3 }\n```\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
