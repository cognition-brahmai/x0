        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that 5 workers can produce 500 units of product A in 10 hours. Now, we need to find out how many units 8 workers can produce in the same amount of time.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out the production rate per worker per hour. That way, I can scale it up for more workers.\n\nSo, if 5 workers produce 500 units in 10 hours, then the total worker-hours would be 5 workers * 10 hours = 50 worker-hours.\n\nNow, 500 units / 50 worker-hours = 10 units per worker-hour.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should find out how many units one worker can produce in 10 hours.\n\nIf 5 workers produce 500 units in 10 hours, then one worker would produce 500 / 5 = 100 units in 10 hours.\n\nSo, the rate per worker is 100 units per 10 hours, which is 10 units per hour.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nNow, if we have 8 workers, each producing 10 units per hour, then in 10 hours, each worker would produce 10 units/hour * 10 hours = 100 units.\n\nTherefore, 8 workers would produce 8 * 100 units = 800 units in 10 hours.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me think again.\n\nIf one worker produces 100 units in 10 hours, then 8 workers should produce 8 * 100 = 800 units in the same time.\n\nBut, I recall that in some problems, the number of workers and the amount produced have a direct proportion, meaning if you double the workers, you double the production, assuming all other factors remain constant.\n\nIn this case, increasing from 5 workers to 8 workers is an increase by a factor of 8/5 = 1.6.\n\nSo, if 5 workers produce 500 units, then 8 workers should produce 500 * 1.6 = 800 units in the same time.\n\nYes, that seems consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of worker-hours.\n\nTotal worker-hours for 5 workers in 10 hours is 5 * 10 = 50 worker-hours for 500 units.\n\nSo, the rate is 500 units / 50 worker-hours = 10 units per worker-hour.\n\nNow, for 8 workers in 10 hours, the total worker-hours would be 8 * 10 = 80 worker-hours.\n\nTherefore, the total production would be 10 units per worker-hour * 80 worker-hours = 800 units.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same conclusion that 8 workers can produce 800 units in 10 hours.\n\nBut let me consider if there are any constraints that I might be missing.\n\nFor example, maybe the factory has limited resources or space that could bottleneck production beyond a certain number of workers.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't mention any such constraints, I can assume that the production scales linearly with the number of workers.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the production rate per worker remains constant with more workers, or if there is a decrease in individual productivity due to coordination issues or limited resources.\n\nBut again, since the problem doesn't specify any such effects, I'll stick with the assumption of linear scaling.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is that 8 workers can produce 800 units in 10 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{800} \\]"
