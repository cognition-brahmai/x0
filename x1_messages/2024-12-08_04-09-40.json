        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular garden that's originally 30 meters long and 20 meters wide. The owner wants to extend both the length and the width by the same amount, and after doing that, the new area should be 200 square meters bigger than the original area. We need to find out what the new dimensions will be.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out what the original area of the garden is. Since it's a rectangle, the area is length times width, right? So, original area = 30 meters * 20 meters = 600 square meters.\n\nNow, the new area is supposed to be 200 square meters more than that, so new area = 600 + 200 = 800 square meters.\n\nLet\u2019s say the owner extends both the length and the width by x meters. So, the new length will be 30 + x meters, and the new width will be 20 + x meters.\n\nThe area with the extended dimensions would be (30 + x) * (20 + x) = 800 square meters.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation:\n\n(30 + x)(20 + x) = 800\n\nNow, I need to solve for x.\n\nFirst, I'll expand the left side:\n\n30*20 + 30*x + 20*x + x^2 = 800\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n600 + 50x + x^2 = 800\n\nNow, bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\nx^2 + 50x + 600 - 800 = 0\n\nSo, x^2 + 50x - 200 = 0\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: x^2 + 50x - 200 = 0\n\nI can solve this using the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nHere, a = 1, b = 50, c = -200\n\nFirst, calculate the discriminant: b^2 - 4ac = 50^2 - 4*1*(-200) = 2500 + 800 = 3300\n\nNow, sqrt(3300) = sqrt(100*33) = 10*sqrt(33)\n\nSo, x = [-50 \u00b1 10*sqrt(33)] / 2\n\nSimplify that:\n\nx = [-50 / 2] \u00b1 [10*sqrt(33)/2]\n\nx = -25 \u00b1 5*sqrt(33)\n\nNow, since x represents an extension, it can't be negative. So, we'll take the positive value:\n\nx = -25 + 5*sqrt(33)\n\nNow, I should calculate the numerical value of x.\n\nFirst, find sqrt(33). sqrt(33) is approximately 5.744.\n\nSo, x = -25 + 5*5.744 = -25 + 28.72 = 3.72 meters\n\nSo, the extension is approximately 3.72 meters.\n\nNow, the new length is 30 + 3.72 = 33.72 meters\n\nAnd the new width is 20 + 3.72 = 23.72 meters\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nOriginal area: 30*20 = 600 sqm\n\nNew area: 33.72*23.72 \u2248 800 sqm\n\nYes, that matches the requirement.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"extending its length and width equally,\" which might imply the same absolute extension for both length and width, which is what I assumed, x meters each.\n\nBut just to be sure, sometimes \"equally\" might mean proportionally, but in this context, it probably means the same amount for both.\n\nAlternatively, if it meant proportionally, then the extension would be the same percentage for both length and width.\n\nBut in this problem, it's clearer that it's the same amount for both.\n\nSo, my answer should be:\n\nNew length: 33.72 meters\n\nNew width: 23.72 meters\n\nBut maybe I should express it more precisely.\n\nLet me calculate x more accurately.\n\nGiven x = -25 + 5*sqrt(33)\n\nsqrt(33) is exactly sqrt(33), so x = -25 + 5*sqrt(33)\n\nSo, the exact value is x = -25 + 5*sqrt(33)\n\nBut since we're dealing with measurements in meters, it's more practical to have a decimal approximation.\n\nUsing sqrt(33) \u2248 5.744, then x \u2248 -25 + 28.72 = 3.72 meters\n\nSo, new length: 30 + 3.72 = 33.72 meters\n\nNew width: 20 + 3.72 = 23.72 meters\n\nAlternatively, if I use more decimal places for sqrt(33), say 5.74456, then x \u2248 -25 + 28.7228 \u2248 3.7228 meters\n\nSo, new length: 30 + 3.7228 \u2248 33.7228 meters\n\nNew width: 20 + 3.7228 \u2248 23.7228 meters\n\nRounding to two decimal places, it's acceptable to say 33.72 meters and 23.72 meters.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects an exact answer in terms of square roots.\n\nSo, the exact new dimensions would be:\n\nLength: 30 + (-25 + 5*sqrt(33)) = 5 + 5*sqrt(33) meters\n\nWidth: 20 + (-25 + 5*sqrt(33)) = -5 + 5*sqrt(33) meters\n\nBut that seems a bit messy. Probably better to leave it as 30 + x and 20 + x, where x = -25 + 5*sqrt(33)\n\nAlternatively, factor out the 5:\n\nx = 5*(-5 + sqrt(33))\n\nSo, length: 30 + 5*(-5 + sqrt(33)) = 30 - 25 + 5*sqrt(33) = 5 + 5*sqrt(33)\n\nWidth: 20 + 5*(-5 + sqrt(33)) = 20 - 25 + 5*sqrt(33) = -5 + 5*sqrt(33)\n\nHmm, still not very elegant.\n\nAlternatively, express in terms of sqrt(33):\n\nLength: 30 - 25 + 5*sqrt(33) = 5 + 5*sqrt(33)\n\nWidth: 20 - 25 + 5*sqrt(33) = -5 + 5*sqrt(33)\n\nAlternatively, factor 5:\n\nLength: 5(1 + sqrt(33))\n\nWidth: 5(-1 + sqrt(33))\n\nThat looks a bit better.\n\nSo, the new dimensions are:\n\nLength: 5(1 + sqrt(33)) meters\n\nWidth: 5(-1 + sqrt(33)) meters\n\nBut to verify, let's multiply these to ensure we get the new area:\n\nLength * Width = 5(1 + sqrt(33)) * 5(-1 + sqrt(33)) = 25[(1)(-1) + 1*sqrt(33) - sqrt(33)*1 + sqrt(33)*sqrt(33)] = 25[-1 + 33] = 25[32] = 800 sqm\n\nYes, that matches the required new area.\n\nSo, both the exact and approximate answers are valid, depending on what the problem expects.\n\nIf it asks for an exact answer, then:\n\nLength: 5(1 + sqrt(33)) meters\n\nWidth: 5(-1 + sqrt(33)) meters\n\nIf it's acceptable to use decimals, then:\n\nLength: approximately 33.72 meters\n\nWidth: approximately 23.72 meters\n\nI think providing both would be ideal, but since the problem doesn't specify, I'll go with the decimal approximation.\n\nSo, the new dimensions of the garden are approximately 33.72 meters in length and 23.72 meters in width.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe new dimensions of the garden are \\boxed{33.72 \\text{ meters in length and } 23.72 \\text{ meters in width}}."
