        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. Here's a Python script that does exactly what you're asking for:\n\n```python\nimport string\n\ndef count_words(text):\n    # Convert the text to lowercase to make it case-insensitive\n    text = text.lower()\n    \n    # Remove punctuation marks\n    text = text.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))\n    \n    # Split the text into words\n    words = text.split()\n    \n    # Create a dictionary to store word frequencies\n    word_count = {}\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each word\n    for word in words:\n        if word in word_count:\n            word_count[word] += 1\n        else:\n            word_count[word] = 1\n    \n    return word_count\n\n# Accept input from the user\ninput_text = input(\"Enter a string of text: \")\n\n# Count word frequencies\nword_frequencies = count_words(input_text)\n\n# Print the word frequencies\nfor word, frequency in word_frequencies.items():\n    print(f\"{word}: {frequency}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Case Insensitivity:** The script converts the entire input text to lowercase using `text.lower()` to ensure that words are counted without regard to case.\n2. **Punctuation Removal:** It removes all punctuation marks from the text using `str.translate` and `string.punctuation`.\n3. **Splitting into Words:** The text is split into words using `text.split()`, which splits on whitespace by default.\n4. **Counting Frequencies:** A dictionary (`word_count`) is used to count the frequency of each word. As we iterate through the list of words, we update the count in the dictionary.\n5. **User Input and Output:** The script takes input from the user, processes it, and prints out each word along with its frequency.\n\nThis script should meet your requirements for counting word frequencies in a given text, ignoring case and punctuation."
