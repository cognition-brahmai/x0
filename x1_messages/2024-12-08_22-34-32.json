        "content": "Let's calculate the total money the farmer makes from selling apples during that week. He sells apples at $2 per pound, and he has sales every day from Monday to Saturday with different amounts each day.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the pounds sold each day:\n\n- Monday: 150 pounds\n\n- Tuesday: 200 pounds\n\n- Wednesday: 250 pounds\n\n- Thursday: 300 pounds\n\n- Friday: 350 pounds\n\n- Saturday: 400 pounds\n\nNext, I need to find the total pounds sold during the week. I'll add up all the daily sales:\n\nTotal pounds = 150 + 200 + 250 + 300 + 350 + 400\n\nLet me add these step by step:\n\n150 + 200 = 350\n\n350 + 250 = 600\n\n600 + 300 = 900\n\n900 + 350 = 1250\n\n1250 + 400 = 1650 pounds\n\nSo, the total pounds of apples sold in the week is 1650 pounds.\n\nNow, since each pound is sold at $2, the total money made is:\n\nTotal money = Total pounds \u00d7 Price per pound\n\nTotal money = 1650 pounds \u00d7 $2/pound\n\nTotal money = $3300\n\nTherefore, the farmer makes $3300 from selling apples during that week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3300} \\]"
