        "content": "So the original garden is 40 feet long and 25 feet wide. That\u2019s a rectangular shape, right? To find the area of a rectangle, I know I multiply the length by the width. So, the original area is 40 feet times 25 feet, which is 1,000 square feet.\n\nNow, the owner wants to expand the garden. The length is to be increased by 50%, and the width by 20%. Okay, so first I need to calculate what the new length and new width will be.\n\nStarting with the length: it\u2019s originally 40 feet, and it\u2019s increasing by 50%. To find 50% of 40, I can calculate 0.5 times 40, which is 20 feet. So, the new length will be the original 40 feet plus 20 feet, making it 60 feet.\n\nNext, the width is 25 feet, and it\u2019s increasing by 20%. To find 20% of 25, I can calculate 0.2 times 25, which is 5 feet. Therefore, the new width will be the original 25 feet plus 5 feet, totaling 30 feet.\n\nNow, with the new dimensions being 60 feet in length and 30 feet in width, I can find the new area by multiplying these two values. So, 60 feet times 30 feet equals 1,800 square feet.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there\u2019s a simpler way to calculate this. I recall that if you increase the length by a certain percentage and the width by another, the area increases by the product of those factors.\n\nLet\u2019s see: the length is increased by 50%, which is the same as multiplying by 1.5 (since 100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5 times the original). Similarly, the width is increased by 20%, which is multiplying by 1.2 (100% + 20% = 120%, or 1.2 times the original).\n\nSo, the new area should be the original area multiplied by 1.5 and by 1.2. Original area is 1,000 square feet, so 1,000 times 1.5 is 1,500, and then 1,500 times 1.2 is 1,800 square feet. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could have multiplied the percentage increases directly: 1.5 times 1.2 is 1.8, meaning the area is 1.8 times the original area. So, 1.8 times 1,000 is indeed 1,800 square feet.\n\nJust to be thorough, I\u2019ll confirm the new dimensions. Original length 40 feet increased by 50% is 40 plus 20, which is 60 feet. Width of 25 feet increased by 20% is 25 plus 5, which is 30 feet. Multiplying 60 by 30 gives 1,800 square feet.\n\nI think that\u2019s correct. Unless there\u2019s something I\u2019m missing, the new area of the garden after the expansion should be 1,800 square feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1800} \\]"
