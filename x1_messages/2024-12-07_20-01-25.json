        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a residential complex with 500 apartments, and each apartment has an average of 5 rooms. Each room requires 4 power outlets, and the electrician charges $50 for installing each outlet. We need to find out the total cost of installing all the power outlets and see if it fits within the budget of $400,000.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the total number of rooms in the entire complex. Since there are 500 apartments and each has an average of 5 rooms, the total number of rooms is:\n\n500 apartments * 5 rooms/apartment = 2,500 rooms\n\nNext, each room requires 4 power outlets, so the total number of outlets needed for all the rooms is:\n\n2,500 rooms * 4 outlets/room = 10,000 outlets\n\nNow, the electrician charges $50 for installing each outlet, so the total cost for installing all the outlets would be:\n\n10,000 outlets * $50/outlet = $500,000\n\nFinally, we need to compare this total cost to the company's budget for electrical installations, which is $400,000. So, $500,000 compared to $400,000 means that the company would exceed its budget by:\n\n$500,000 - $400,000 = $100,000\n\nTherefore, the company cannot stay within its electrical installation budget of $400,000; they would go over by $100,000 based on these calculations.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the number of apartments: 500. Each has 5 rooms: 500 * 5 = 2,500 rooms. Each room has 4 outlets: 2,500 * 4 = 10,000 outlets. Each outlet costs $50: 10,000 * 50 = $500,000. And the budget is $400,000, so the difference is indeed $100,000.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a way the company can reduce costs to stay within budget. Perhaps they can negotiate with the electrician for a lower rate, or maybe they can reduce the number of outlets per room if possible. But considering that each room needs 4 outlets, and safety standards might require a certain number, reducing the outlets might not be feasible.\n\nAnother option could be to look for a different electrician who charges less per outlet. If they can find someone who charges, say, $40 per outlet, then the total cost would be 10,000 * $40 = $400,000, which matches the budget exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some rooms require fewer outlets. For example, if some rooms only need 3 outlets instead of 4, that could reduce the total number of outlets needed. But the problem states that each room requires 4 outlets, so maybe that's not possible.\n\nWait a minute, maybe not all rooms require 4 outlets. For instance, smaller rooms might need fewer outlets. If we can categorize the rooms and assign different numbers of outlets based on room type, that might help reduce the total cost.\n\nLet's assume that out of the 2,500 rooms, some are bedrooms, some are bathrooms, some are living rooms, and some are kitchens. Maybe bedrooms need 3 outlets, bathrooms need 5, living rooms need 4, and kitchens need 6.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Bedrooms: 1,500 rooms * 3 outlets = 4,500 outlets\n\n- Bathrooms: 500 rooms * 5 outlets = 2,500 outlets\n\n- Living rooms: 300 rooms * 4 outlets = 1,200 outlets\n\n- Kitchens: 200 rooms * 6 outlets = 1,200 outlets\n\nTotal outlets: 4,500 + 2,500 + 1,200 + 1,200 = 9,400 outlets\n\nAt $50 per outlet, the total cost would be 9,400 * $50 = $470,000, which is still over the $400,000 budget by $70,000.\n\nAlternatively, if we adjust the numbers further:\n\n- Bedrooms: 1,800 rooms * 3 outlets = 5,400 outlets\n\n- Bathrooms: 400 rooms * 4 outlets = 1,600 outlets\n\n- Living rooms: 200 rooms * 4 outlets = 800 outlets\n\n- Kitchens: 100 rooms * 5 outlets = 500 outlets\n\nTotal outlets: 5,400 + 1,600 + 800 + 500 = 8,300 outlets\n\nAt $50 per outlet, the total cost would be 8,300 * $50 = $415,000, still over by $15,000.\n\nHmm, still not within budget. Maybe the company needs to find a way to reduce the cost per outlet. If they can negotiate the electrician's rate down to $40 per outlet, then 8,300 * $40 = $332,000, which is well within the $400,000 budget.\n\nAlternatively, if they can find a balance between reducing the number of outlets and negotiating the price, they might be able to stay within budget.\n\nBut perhaps there are other electrical components or optimizations that can be considered to reduce costs. For example, using more energy-efficient materials or simplifying the wiring plan.\n\nAnother approach could be to see if some outlets can be combined or if certain areas can share outlets. However, this might not be safe or up to code, so it's important to ensure that all installations meet local building codes and safety standards.\n\nMoreover, maybe the company can look into preassembled electrical panels or bulk purchasing of materials to reduce costs.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the initial calculations, the total cost of installing all the power outlets is $500,000, which exceeds the budget of $400,000 by $100,000. To stay within budget, the company needs to find ways to reduce costs, such as negotiating lower rates with the electrician, reducing the number of outlets where possible without compromising safety and functionality, or exploring more cost-effective installation methods. It's also crucial for the company to review the design and see if there are any non-essential outlets that can be eliminated.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500000} \\]"
