        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company with a budget of $10,000 for employee bonuses. Each employee gets a base bonus of $250 plus an additional $50 for every year they've worked at the company. And the average years of service is 5 years. We need to figure out how many employees can receive bonuses within that $10,000 budget.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the total bonus per employee would be, given the average years of service. Since the average years of service is 5, I can use that to calculate the average bonus per employee.\n\nThe bonus structure is $250 plus $50 for each year of service. So, if someone has worked for 5 years, their bonus would be $250 + (5 * $50) = $250 + $250 = $500.\n\nWait a minute, but the average years of service is 5 years. Does that mean that some employees have more than 5 years, and some have less, averaging out to 5? If that's the case, then using the average years of service to calculate the average bonus might be a reasonable approach, assuming that the distribution of years of service is such that the average is representative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all employees have exactly 5 years of service, but the problem says \"average years of service among employees is 5 years,\" which suggests that there's variability, but for simplicity, maybe we can assume that all employees have exactly 5 years of service.\n\nLet me consider both approaches.\n\nFirst approach: assuming all employees have exactly 5 years of service.\n\nIn this case, each employee gets a bonus of $250 + (5 * $50) = $500.\n\nSo, if each employee gets $500, and the total budget is $10,000, then the number of employees who can receive bonuses is $10,000 / $500 = 20 employees.\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I should consider if this is the most accurate way to approach the problem.\n\nSecond approach: considering that employees have varying years of service, averaging 5 years.\n\nIn this case, some employees have more than 5 years, and some have less, but on average, it's 5 years.\n\nIf I assume that the years of service are normally distributed around 5 years, then using the average to calculate the average bonus would still give me $500 per employee, as before.\n\nTherefore, even with variability in years of service, if the average is 5 years, the average bonus would still be $500 per employee.\n\nThus, the calculation of $10,000 / $500 = 20 employees seems reasonable.\n\nBut wait, is there a better way to account for the variability in years of service? Maybe using the total sum of years of service.\n\nLet\u2019s think differently.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of employees as n.\n\nEach employee has a different number of years of service, but the average is 5 years, so the total years of service for all employees is n * 5.\n\nThe bonus for each employee is $250 plus $50 times their years of service.\n\nSo, the total bonus for all employees would be:\n\nTotal bonus = sum over all employees of ($250 + $50 * years of service)\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\nTotal bonus = n * $250 + $50 * sum of years of service for all employees\n\nBut since the average years of service is 5, the sum of years of service is n * 5.\n\nTherefore, total bonus = n * $250 + $50 * n * 5 = n * $250 + n * $250 = n * $500\n\nWe have a budget of $10,000, so:\n\nn * $500 \u2264 $10,000\n\nTherefore, n \u2264 $10,000 / $500 = 20\n\nSo, the maximum number of employees who can receive bonuses is 20.\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor to consider. For example, could some employees have fractional years of service, or is the number of years always an integer? The problem likely assumes that years of service are integers, but since we're using averages, it doesn't affect the calculation.\n\nAlso, is there a possibility that some employees have very high years of service, which could skew the total bonus amount? For instance, if one employee has 20 years of service, their bonus would be $250 + 20 * $50 = $1250, which is higher than the average.\n\nHowever, since the average is 5 years, having some employees with higher years of service would be balanced by others with lower years of service.\n\nGiven that, using the average to calculate the average bonus seems valid.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion remains that 20 employees can receive bonuses within the $10,000 budget.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider a scenario where employees have different years of service.\n\nSuppose we have 20 employees, and the total years of service sum up to 20 * 5 = 100 years.\n\nIf we distribute the years of service such that some have fewer and some have more, but the total is 100, then the total bonus would be:\n\nTotal bonus = 20 * $250 + $50 * 100 = $5,000 + $5,000 = $10,000\n\nWhich matches the budget.\n\nIf we had more than 20 employees, say 21, and the total years of service are 21 * 5 = 105 years.\n\nThen total bonus = 21 * $250 + $50 * 105 = $5,250 + $5,250 = $10,500, which exceeds the budget.\n\nTherefore, 20 employees is the maximum that can be accommodated within the $10,000 budget.\n\nHence, the answer is that 20 employees can receive bonuses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
