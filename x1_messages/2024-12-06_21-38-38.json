        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 50 red balls and 50 blue balls in a box, making a total of 100 balls. I'm supposed to pick one ball at random, look at its color, put it back, and repeat this process three times. I need to find out the probability that I pick a red ball all three times.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basic probability of picking a red ball in a single draw. Since there are 50 red balls out of 100, the probability should be 50/100, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.\n\nNow, because I'm picking the ball with replacement, each pick is independent of the others. That means the outcome of one pick doesn't affect the outcomes of the next picks.\n\nSo, for three picks in a row, all being red, I can multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nProbability of red on first pick: 1/2\n\nProbability of red on second pick: 1/2\n\nProbability of red on third pick: 1/2\n\nTotal probability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of percentages.\n\n50% chance of red each time.\n\nSo, 50% * 50% * 50% = 12.5%\n\nBut 1/8 is also 0.125, which is 12.5%, so that matches.\n\nIs there another way to look at this?\n\nMaybe using combinations or something, but since the order matters here\u2014specifically, we want red every time\u2014multiplying the individual probabilities seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nEach pick has 2 possibilities: red or blue.\n\nSo for three picks, there are 2^3 = 8 possible outcomes:\n\nRRR, RRB, RBR, BRR, RBB, BRB, BBR, BBB\n\nOut of these, only one is RRR.\n\nSo the probability should be 1 out of 8, which again is 1/8 or 12.5%.\n\nWait, but this assumes that each outcome is equally likely, which it is, since each pick is independent and has an equal probability.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula for independent events.\n\nThe probability of all events happening is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nHere, the events are independent, so multiplying them is appropriate.\n\nLet me consider if there's any chance that the events aren't independent.\n\nBut since I'm replacing the ball each time, the composition of the box remains the same for each pick, so yes, they are independent.\n\nIs there any other factor to consider, like the balls being identical except for color?\n\nI don't think so. The only difference is the color, and we're only concerned with red.\n\nWait a minute, could the fact that there are exactly 50 red and 50 blue balls affect the probability?\n\nIn this case, no, because the probability is simply based on the ratio of red to total balls, which is 50/100 = 1/2.\n\nNow, if the numbers were different, say 45 red and 55 blue, the probability would be 45/100 for red each time, but in this symmetrical case, it's 1/2 each time.\n\nSo, multiplying 1/2 three times gives 1/8.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to pick without replacement, the probabilities would change with each pick, but since it's with replacement, they stay the same.\n\nLet me confirm that.\n\nFirst pick: 50 red out of 100, so 1/2.\n\nAfter putting it back, the box still has 50 red and 50 blue.\n\nSecond pick: again 1/2.\n\nThird pick: still 1/2.\n\nSo, yes, multiplying them is correct.\n\nAnother angle: what if I wanted the probability of getting at least one red in three picks?\n\nThat would be 1 minus the probability of getting no reds, which is the probability of picking blue all three times.\n\nProbability of blue in one pick: 1/2.\n\nSo, (1/2)^3 = 1/8 for all blue.\n\nTherefore, probability of at least one red: 1 - 1/8 = 7/8.\n\nBut in this problem, we specifically want all three to be red, so 1/8 is correct.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nIs there any dependency between picks that I'm missing?\n\nNo, because of replacement, each pick is independent.\n\nAlso, since the balls are identical except for color, and we're putting them back each time, the probabilities remain constant.\n\nSo, I think 1/8 is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I can calculate it using the combination formula.\n\nWait, but since the order matters (we want red every time), it's not a combination but a permutation.\n\nActually, in this case, since we specify all three picks are red, it's simply the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nUsing combinations would be more relevant if we were interested in exactly k reds in n picks, but here, we want all three to be red.\n\nSo, yes, (1/2)^3 = 1/8 is the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the total number of possible sequences of three picks, each pick has two outcomes, so 2^3 = 8 total sequences, only one of which is RRR.\n\nTherefore, probability is 1/8.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways, and I'm confident that 1/8 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{8}} \\]"
