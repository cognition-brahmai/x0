        "content": "Let's see. If I'm driving at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for 2 hours and 30 minutes, I need to find out how far I'll go. Okay, so first, I know that distance equals speed multiplied by time. That makes sense because if you're going faster or for longer, you'll cover more ground.\n\nSo, speed is 60 miles per hour, and time is 2 hours and 30 minutes. But, I need to make sure that the units match. Since speed is in miles per hour, I should convert the time entirely into hours.\n\n2 hours and 30 minutes... 30 minutes is half an hour, so that's 2.5 hours in total.\n\nNow, distance = speed \u00d7 time = 60 miles per hour \u00d7 2.5 hours.\n\nLet me do the math: 60 \u00d7 2.5.\n\nWell, 60 \u00d7 2 is 120, and 60 \u00d7 0.5 is 30, so total is 150 miles.\n\nSo, I would travel 150 miles.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, since 60 miles per hour means I'm covering 60 miles every hour, in 2 hours I would cover 120 miles, and in 0.5 hours (30 minutes), I would cover 30 miles (because half of 60 is 30). So, 120 plus 30 equals 150 miles.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I convert everything into minutes, there are 60 minutes in an hour, so 60 miles per 60 minutes. But that seems more complicated, and I might make a mistake with the units.\n\nNo, I think sticking with hours is better for this problem.\n\nSo, final answer: 150 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
