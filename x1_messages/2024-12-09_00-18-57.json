        "content": "Let's solve this system of equations step by step. We have two equations:\n\n1. \\( y = 2x + 3 \\)\n\n2. \\( y = -x + 4 \\)\n\nSince both equations are solved for y, we can set them equal to each other. This is because if both expressions equal y, then they must equal each other.\n\nSo, set \\( 2x + 3 = -x + 4 \\).\n\nNow, we'll solve for x. First, add x to both sides to get all the x terms on one side:\n\n\\( 2x + x + 3 = -x + x + 4 \\)\n\n\\( 3x + 3 = 4 \\)\n\nNext, subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with x:\n\n\\( 3x + 3 - 3 = 4 - 3 \\)\n\n\\( 3x = 1 \\)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n\nNow that we have x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find y. Let's use the first equation \\( y = 2x + 3 \\):\n\n\\( y = 2(\\frac{1}{3}) + 3 \\)\n\n\\( y = \\frac{2}{3} + 3 \\)\n\nTo add these, convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{9}{3} \\)\n\n\\( y = \\frac{11}{3} \\)\n\nSo, the solution to the system is \\( x = \\frac{1}{3} \\) and \\( y = \\frac{11}{3} \\).\n\nTo check, let's plug these values into the second equation to make sure they work:\n\n\\( y = -x + 4 \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{11}{3} = -\\frac{1}{3} + 4 \\)\n\nConvert 4 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:\n\n\\( \\frac{11}{3} = -\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{12}{3} \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{11}{3} = \\frac{11}{3} \\)\n\nIt checks out. So, the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left( \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{11}{3} \\right)} \\]"
