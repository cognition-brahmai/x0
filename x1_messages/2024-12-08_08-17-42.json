        "content": "Sure! Below is a simple implementation of the QuickSort algorithm in Go for sorting an array of integers.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\n// quickSort is a recursive function to sort the array\nfunc quickSort(arr []int, low int, high int) {\n    if low < high {\n        // pi is partitioning index, arr[pi] is now at right place\n        pi := partition(arr, low, high)\n\n        // Recursively sort elements before partition and after partition\n        quickSort(arr, low, pi-1)\n        quickSort(arr, pi+1, high)\n    }\n}\n\n// partition reorders the elements in the array such that all elements less than the pivot are before it and all elements greater are after it\nfunc partition(arr []int, low int, high int) int {\n    pivot := arr[high] // pivot\n    i := (low - 1)     // index of smaller element\n\n    for j := low; j <= high-1; j++ {\n        // If current element is smaller than or equal to pivot\n        if arr[j] <= pivot {\n            i++ // increment index of smaller element\n            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n        }\n    }\n    arr[i+1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i+1]\n    return (i + 1)\n}\n\n// main function to test the quickSort function\nfunc main() {\n    arr := []int{10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5}\n    n := len(arr)\n    quickSort(arr, 0, n-1)\n    fmt.Println(\"Sorted array:\")\n    fmt.Println(arr)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **quickSort Function**:\n   - This is the main function that implements the QuickSort algorithm.\n   - It takes an array `arr`, and the indices `low` and `high` that define the portion of the array to be sorted.\n   - If `low` is less than `high`, it calls the `partition` function to find the partitioning index `pi`, and then recursively sorts the subarrays on either side of `pi`.\n\n2. **partition Function**:\n   - This function is responsible for partitioning the array.\n   - It selects the last element as the pivot and rearranges the array so that all elements less than or equal to the pivot come before it, and all elements greater come after it.\n   - It returns the index of the pivot after partitioning.\n\n3. **main Function**:\n   - This is the entry point of the program.\n   - It initializes an array, calls `quickSort` to sort the array, and then prints the sorted array.\n\nThis implementation uses the last element as the pivot for simplicity. There are more efficient ways to choose the pivot, such as selecting the median of three elements, but this basic approach works well for understanding the algorithm."
