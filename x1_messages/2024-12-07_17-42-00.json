        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many boys and girls there are in the school.\n\nThe school has 1200 students, and 60% of them are boys. So, the number of boys is:\n\nNumber of boys = 60% of 1200 = 0.60 \u00d7 1200 = 720 boys\n\nSince the rest of the students are girls, the number of girls is:\n\nNumber of girls = Total students - Number of boys = 1200 - 720 = 480 girls\n\nNow, we need to find out how many boys and girls participate in sports activities.\n\n80% of the boys participate in sports, so:\n\nNumber of boys participating in sports = 80% of 720 = 0.80 \u00d7 720 = 576 boys\n\n70% of the girls participate in sports, so:\n\nNumber of girls participating in sports = 70% of 480 = 0.70 \u00d7 480 = 336 girls\n\nTo find the total number of students participating in sports, we add the number of boys and girls participating:\n\nTotal participating = 576 boys + 336 girls = 912 students\n\nNow, to find the number of students who do not participate in sports, we subtract the number of students participating from the total number of students:\n\nNumber of students not participating = Total students - Total participating = 1200 - 912 = 288 students\n\nSo, 288 students do not participate in sports activities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{288} \\]"
