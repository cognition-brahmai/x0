        "content": "So the school has 400 students in total, and 70% of them are boys. I need to find out how many girls there are.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many boys there are. Since 70% of the students are boys, I can calculate the number of boys by taking 70% of 400.\n\nTo calculate 70% of 400, I can multiply 400 by 0.70.\n\nSo, 400 times 0.70 is 280. That means there are 280 boys in the school.\n\nNow, to find the number of girls, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students.\n\nSo, 400 minus 280 equals 120.\n\nTherefore, there are 120 girls in the school.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can directly calculate the percentage of girls and then find that percentage of 400.\n\nIf 70% are boys, then the remaining percentage must be girls. So, 100% minus 70% equals 30%. Therefore, 30% of the students are girls.\n\nNow, to find 30% of 400, I can multiply 400 by 0.30.\n\n400 times 0.30 is 120.\n\nSo, again, I get 120 girls.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is good. It confirms that 120 is the correct number of girls in the school.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst method:\n\n70% of 400 is 280 boys.\n\n400 minus 280 is 120 girls.\n\nSecond method:\n\n30% of 400 is 120 girls.\n\nYes, both methods confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of ratios. If 70% are boys, then the ratio of boys to total students is 70:100.\n\nSimilarly, the ratio of girls to total students is 30:100.\n\nSo, girls are 30% of 400, which is 120.\n\nNo matter how I look at it, the number of girls is 120.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
