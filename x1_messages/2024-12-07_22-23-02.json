        "content": "So, you've got this problem here, and it's a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out. Let's see. You have two coins: one is fair, with heads on one side and tails on the other, and the other coin is biased, with heads on both sides. You pick one coin at random and flip it, and it lands on heads. Now, you need to find the probability that you picked the fair coin.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. There are two coins:\n\n1. Fair coin: Heads on one side, tails on the other.\n\n2. Biased coin: Heads on both sides.\n\nYou pick one coin at random, which means each coin has a 50% chance of being selected. Then you flip it, and it shows heads. Given that it's heads, you want to know the probability that it's the fair coin.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved using conditional probability. Specifically, it reminds me of Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update probabilities based on new evidence.\n\nLet's define the events:\n\n- F: The event that you picked the fair coin.\n\n- B: The event that you picked the biased coin.\n\n- H: The event that the flip results in heads.\n\nWe are given:\n\n- P(F) = 1/2 (since you pick a coin at random)\n\n- P(B) = 1/2\n\nNow, we need to find P(F|H), the probability that you picked the fair coin given that you got heads.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(F|H) = [P(H|F) * P(F)] / P(H)\n\nSo, I need to find P(H|F) and P(H).\n\nFirst, P(H|F): the probability of getting heads given that you picked the fair coin. Since the fair coin has one heads and one tails, P(H|F) = 1/2.\n\nNext, P(H): the total probability of getting heads. This can be found using the law of total probability:\n\nP(H) = P(H|F) * P(F) + P(H|B) * P(B)\n\nWe already have P(H|F) = 1/2 and P(F) = 1/2.\n\nNow, P(H|B): the probability of getting heads given that you picked the biased coin. Since the biased coin has heads on both sides, P(H|B) = 1.\n\nAnd P(B) = 1/2.\n\nSo, P(H) = (1/2 * 1/2) + (1 * 1/2) = (1/4) + (1/2) = 3/4\n\nNow, plug these back into Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(F|H) = ( (1/2) * (1/2) ) / (3/4) = (1/4) / (3/4) = 1/3\n\nWait, that can't be right. If I get heads, and the biased coin always shows heads, while the fair coin only shows heads half the time, intuition suggests that the probability of having picked the fair coin should be lower than 50%. But 1/3 seems plausible.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nP(F|H) = [P(H|F) * P(F)] / P(H)\n\nP(H|F) = 1/2\n\nP(F) = 1/2\n\nP(H) = P(H|F) * P(F) + P(H|B) * P(B) = (1/2 * 1/2) + (1 * 1/2) = 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4\n\nSo, P(F|H) = (1/4) / (3/4) = 1/3\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of possible outcomes.\n\nThere are two coins, and you pick one at random, so each coin has a 50% chance of being selected.\n\nIf you pick the fair coin (which happens with probability 1/2), then flipping it results in heads with probability 1/2. So, the probability of picking the fair coin and getting heads is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n\nIf you pick the biased coin (probability 1/2), and it always lands on heads (probability 1), then the probability of picking the biased coin and getting heads is (1/2) * 1 = 1/2.\n\nNow, given that you got heads, the total probability of getting heads is 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4.\n\nThe probability that you picked the fair coin given that you got heads is the probability of picking the fair coin and getting heads divided by the total probability of getting heads, which is (1/4) / (3/4) = 1/3.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using conditional probability without Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet's consider all possible scenarios:\n\n1. You pick the fair coin (probability 1/2), flip it, and get heads (probability 1/2). So, the combined probability is 1/4.\n\n2. You pick the fair coin (1/2), flip it, and get tails (1/2). Probability 1/4.\n\n3. You pick the biased coin (1/2), flip it, and get heads (1). Probability 1/2.\n\nNow, since you observed heads, we can eliminate the scenario where you get tails. So, the relevant scenarios are:\n\n- Fair coin and heads: probability 1/4\n\n- Biased coin and heads: probability 1/2\n\nThe total probability of heads is 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4.\n\nThe probability that you picked the fair coin given that you got heads is the probability of the fair coin and heads divided by the total probability of heads, which is (1/4) / (3/4) = 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, you can think of it in terms of proportions:\n\nOut of every 4 times you do this experiment:\n\n- Once you pick the fair coin and get heads.\n\n- Once you pick the fair coin and get tails.\n\n- Twice you pick the biased coin and get heads.\n\nBut since you only consider the cases where you get heads, you have:\n\n- 1 time fair coin and heads.\n\n- 2 times biased coin and heads.\n\nSo, out of 3 times you get heads, only 1 time it's the fair coin. Hence, the probability is 1/3.\n\nThis matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nLet me try to visualize it with a tree diagram.\n\nFirst branch: pick fair coin (P=1/2)\n\n- Second branch: heads (P=1/2)\n\n- Second branch: tails (P=1/2)\n\nFirst branch: pick biased coin (P=1/2)\n\n- Second branch: heads (P=1)\n\nNow, given that you have heads, you can ignore the tails outcome.\n\nSo, the probability of having picked the fair coin given heads is the probability of the fair coin and heads divided by the total probability of heads.\n\nWhich is (1/2 * 1/2) / [(1/2 * 1/2) + (1/2 * 1)] = (1/4) / (3/4) = 1/3.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem?\n\nMaybe using the concept of likelihoods.\n\nThe likelihood of observing heads given the fair coin is 1/2.\n\nThe likelihood of observing heads given the biased coin is 1.\n\nThe prior probabilities of picking each coin are both 1/2.\n\nSo, the posterior probability of having picked the fair coin given heads is proportional to the likelihood times the prior.\n\nSo, posterior F|H proportional to P(H|F) * P(F) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nPosterior B|H proportional to P(H|B) * P(B) = 1 * 1/2 = 1/2\n\nNow, to find the actual probability, normalize these:\n\nTotal probability: 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4\n\nSo, P(F|H) = (1/4) / (3/4) = 1/3\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the biased coin always gives heads, while the fair coin gives heads half the time.\n\nSo, in terms of possible outcomes that result in heads:\n\n- Fair coin: 1 outcome (heads)\n\n- Biased coin: 2 outcomes (since it has heads on both sides)\n\nWait, but it's just one coin flip, so for the biased coin, there's only one flip, which is always heads.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, imagine that the biased coin is two-headed, so in a sense, it has two heads.\n\nIf you pick a coin at random and flip it, and it's heads, then the possible scenarios are:\n\n- Fair coin, heads\n\n- Biased coin, head A\n\n- Biased coin, head B\n\nSo, three possible heads, but only one of them is from the fair coin.\n\nTherefore, the probability that it's the fair coin given heads is 1/3.\n\nThis is an interesting way to think about it, and it matches the previous calculations.\n\nAlternatively, you can think in terms of proportion of heads coming from each coin.\n\nThe fair coin produces heads half the time, while the biased coin produces heads all the time.\n\nSo, in terms of the sources of heads:\n\n- From the fair coin: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 of all flips\n\n- From the biased coin: 1/2 * 1 = 1/2 of all flips\n\nSo, given that you have heads, the probability it came from the fair coin is (1/4) / (1/4 + 1/2) = 1/3.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think this is solid.\n\nIs there any chance I'm missing something?\n\nWell, perhaps I should consider the physical nature of the coins.\n\nThe fair coin has one heads and one tails, while the biased coin has heads on both sides.\n\nWhen you pick a coin and flip it without looking, and it shows heads, you want to know the probability that it's the fair coin.\n\nGiven the calculations above, it seems consistently pointing to 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simulate this situation.\n\nSuppose you do this experiment many times.\n\nSay you do it 100 times.\n\n- 50 times you pick the fair coin.\n\n- Of those 50, 25 show heads, 25 show tails.\n\n- 50 times you pick the biased coin.\n\n- All 50 show heads.\n\nSo, total heads: 25 (from fair) + 50 (from biased) = 75 heads.\n\nOut of these 75 heads, 25 are from the fair coin.\n\nTherefore, the probability that it's the fair coin given heads is 25/75 = 1/3.\n\nThis simulation approach also gives the same answer.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, but let's think about it differently.\n\nSuppose you pick a coin, flip it, and it's heads.\n\nYou want P(F|H).\n\nBy Bayes' theorem: P(F|H) = P(H|F) P(F) / P(H)\n\nWe have P(H|F) = 1/2, P(F) = 1/2, P(H) = 3/4 as before.\n\nSo, P(F|H) = (1/2 * 1/2) / (3/4) = 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, P(B|H) = P(H|B) P(B) / P(H) = (1 * 1/2) / (3/4) = (1/2) / (3/4) = 2/3.\n\nSo, the probabilities add up to 1: 1/3 + 2/3 = 1.\n\nThis makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the biased coin is twice as likely to produce heads as the fair coin.\n\nSince the fair coin has P(H|F) = 1/2 and the biased coin has P(H|B) = 1, the ratio is 1 : 2.\n\nTherefore, given that you have heads, the probability that it's the fair coin is 1 / (1+2) = 1/3.\n\nThis is consistent with all the other methods.\n\nI think I've thoroughly convinced myself that the answer is indeed 1/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
