        "content": "The French phrase you're referring to is \"Fin de Si\u00e8cle.\" It translates to \"end of the century\" and indeed, it denotes the cultural and artistic climate in Europe, particularly in France and England, during the period roughly from the 1880s to the early 1900s. This movement was characterized by a sense of weariness, decadence, cynicism, and a belief that civilization was in decline.\n\nFin de Si\u00e8cle art and literature often explored themes of decadence, morbidity, and the occult, reflecting a mood of pessimism and nihilism. Key figures associated with this movement include writers such as Oscar Wilde, Joris-Karl Huysmans, and Arthur Rimbaud, as well as artists like Aubrey Beardsley and Gustave Moreau.\n\nThis period was also marked by significant social and political changes, including the rise of feminism, the labor movement, and the questioning of traditional moral values. The aesthetic and philosophical ideas of the Fin de Si\u00e8cle had a profound influence on the development of modernism in the early 20th century."
