        "content": "So I have this problem here. A company starts with $100,000 and expects to get a 7% annual return on investment, and they're going to reinvest all their profits back into the business every year. I need to find out what their total capital will be after 5 years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a return on investment (ROI) is. ROI is a performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment or to compare the efficiency of a number of different investments. In this case, it's 7% per year.\n\nSince the company is reinvesting all its profits back into the business, that means each year's profit is added to the original capital, and the next year's profit is calculated on this new total, and so on for 5 years.\n\nThis sounds like compound interest, where interest is earned on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest from previous periods.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- P = $100,000\n\n- r = 7% or 0.07\n\n- Since the ROI is annual and they reinvest all profits annually, n = 1\n\n- t = 5 years\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nA = 100,000 * (1 + 0.07/1)^(1*5)\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\n\n1 + 0.07/1 = 1 + 0.07 = 1.07\n\nSo,\n\nA = 100,000 * (1.07)^5\n\nNow, I need to calculate 1.07 raised to the power of 5.\n\n1.07^1 = 1.07\n\n1.07^2 = 1.07 * 1.07 \u2248 1.1449\n\n1.07^3 \u2248 1.1449 * 1.07 \u2248 1.225043\n\n1.07^4 \u2248 1.225043 * 1.07 \u2248 1.31079601\n\n1.07^5 \u2248 1.31079601 * 1.07 \u2248 1.4025518507\n\nSo,\n\nA \u2248 100,000 * 1.4025518507 \u2248 140,255.18507\n\nRounding to the nearest cent, that's approximately $140,255.19\n\nTherefore, after 5 years, the total capital will be approximately $140,255.19.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest with annual compounding, which is:\n\nA = P(1 + r)^t\n\nUsing the same values:\n\nA = 100,000 * (1 + 0.07)^5\n\nA = 100,000 * (1.07)^5\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, after 5 years, the total capital will be approximately $140,255.19.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{140255.19} \\]"
