        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of people who want to rent bicycles, and the rental shop has a specific pricing structure. They charge $10 per bicycle plus a one-time fee of $25 for insurance. The total cost for renting the bicycles is $185, and we need to find out how many bicycles the group rented.\n\nFirst, let's understand the cost structure. There's a fixed cost and a variable cost. The fixed cost is the one-time fee for insurance, which is $25. The variable cost depends on the number of bicycles rented, with each bicycle costing $10.\n\nLet's denote the number of bicycles rented as \\( n \\). The total cost \\( C \\) can be expressed as the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost. So, the equation for the total cost is:\n\n\\[ C = 10n + 25 \\]\n\nWe are given that the total cost \\( C \\) is $185. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 10n + 25 = 185 \\]\n\nNow, we need to solve for \\( n \\). Let's do this step by step.\n\nFirst, subtract 25 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\( n \\):\n\n\\[ 10n = 185 - 25 \\]\n\n\\[ 10n = 160 \\]\n\nNext, divide both sides by 10 to solve for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{160}{10} \\]\n\n\\[ n = 16 \\]\n\nSo, the group rented 16 bicycles.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check this to make sure we didn't make any mistakes. If they rented 16 bicycles at $10 each, that would be \\( 16 \\times 10 = 160 \\) dollars for the bicycles. Plus the one-time insurance fee of $25, the total cost would be \\( 160 + 25 = 185 \\) dollars, which matches the given total cost. So, yes, our answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could think about this in terms of subtracting the insurance fee from the total cost and then dividing by the cost per bicycle. So, total cost is $185, subtract the $25 insurance fee:\n\n\\[ 185 - 25 = 160 \\]\n\nThen, divide this amount by the cost per bicycle:\n\n\\[ 160 \\div 10 = 16 \\]\n\nAgain, we get 16 bicycles.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the cost per bicycle including the insurance. But in this case, since the insurance is a one-time fee, it's better to keep it separate as we did above.\n\nIt's also important to note that the number of bicycles must be a whole number because you can't rent a fraction of a bicycle. Our answer is 16, which is a whole number, so that makes sense.\n\nIf the problem were more complex, involving different rates for different numbers of bicycles or other variables, we might need to adjust our approach. But for this straightforward linear cost structure, our method works perfectly.\n\nSo, the final answer is 16 bicycles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
