        "content": "So there are 4 cats in the room, and each cat catches 3 mice in an hour. That means, in total, the cats catch 4 times 3, which is 12 mice in an hour.\n\nBut, for every 2 mice caught, one escapes. So, out of every 2 mice caught, only 1 stays caught because the other one escapes.\n\nSo, if they catch 12 mice, then the number of mice that escape would be half of that, since for every 2 caught, 1 escapes.\n\nSo, escapes = 12 / 2 = 6 mice.\n\nTherefore, the number of mice that do not escape is the total caught minus the escaped ones, which is 12 - 6 = 6 mice.\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right. If they catch 12 mice and for every 2 caught, 1 escapes, then indeed, 6 escape and 6 remain.\n\nBut let's think about it differently. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, for every 2 mice caught, 1 escapes, meaning that effectively, for every 2 mice caught, only 1 mouse is retained.\n\nSo, the retention rate is 1 mouse per 2 caught.\n\nTherefore, if they catch 12 mice, the number retained is 12 / 2 = 6 mice.\n\nSo, again, 6 mice do not escape.\n\nHmm, that matches the previous calculation.\n\nIs there another way to look at this?\n\nLet's consider it step by step.\n\nCat 1 catches 3 mice. Out of these, for every 2 caught, 1 escapes.\n\nSo, for 3 mice, how many escape?\n\nWell, for every 2, 1 escapes.\n\nSo, for 2 mice, 1 escapes, and the third mouse is caught without an escape pair.\n\nWait, that seems a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of pairs.\n\nFor every 2 mice caught, 1 escapes.\n\nSo, with 12 mice caught, there are 12 / 2 = 6 pairs.\n\nFor each pair, 1 escapes, so total escapes are 6.\n\nThus, mice that do not escape are 12 - 6 = 6.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the escape rate is 1 out of every 2 caught, meaning the retention rate is 1 mouse per pair.\n\nSo, total mice not escaping would be 6.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 6 mice do not escape after 1 hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
