        "content": "So in this class, there are 30 students in total. According to the information, 60% of them received an A grade, 30% got a B grade, and the remaining students got a C grade. The question is asking how many more students received an A than a C.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many students received each grade. Let's start with the A grade. Since 60% of the students got an A, I can calculate the number of students who got an A by taking 60% of 30.\n\nTo calculate 60% of 30, I can multiply 30 by 0.60:\n\n30 \u00d7 0.60 = 18\n\nSo, 18 students received an A grade.\n\nNext, let's find out how many students received a B grade. It's given that 30% received a B. So, I'll calculate 30% of 30:\n\n30 \u00d7 0.30 = 9\n\nTherefore, 9 students received a B grade.\n\nNow, to find out how many students received a C grade, I can subtract the number of students who got A and B from the total number of students. Alternatively, since the remaining students received a C, I can calculate the percentage of students who got a C and then find the number.\n\nFirst, let's find the percentage of students who got a C. Total percentage is 100%, and 60% got A and 30% got B, so:\n\n100% - 60% - 30% = 10%\n\nSo, 10% of the students received a C grade.\n\nNow, calculate 10% of 30:\n\n30 \u00d7 0.10 = 3\n\nTherefore, 3 students received a C grade.\n\nThe question is asking how many more students received an A than a C. So, I need to find the difference between the number of students who got an A and those who got a C:\n\n18 (A) - 3 (C) = 15\n\nSo, 15 more students received an A than a C.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, 60% of 30 is indeed 18.\n\nThen, 30% of 30 is 9.\n\nThe remaining 10% should be those who got a C, which is 3 students.\n\nAnd the difference between A and C is 18 - 3 = 15.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have verified if the numbers add up to the total number of students.\n\nSo, students who got A: 18\n\nStudents who got B: 9\n\nStudents who got C: 3\n\nTotal: 18 + 9 + 3 = 30, which matches the total number of students.\n\nSo, my answer should be correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
