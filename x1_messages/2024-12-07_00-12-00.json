So, you're asking about a self-titled album from 1971 that features songs sung by an American singer known for her unique raspy voice and her marriage to Sonny Bono. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst off, the mention of a raspy voice and marriage to Sonny Bono immediately makes me think of Cher. Cher and Sonny Bono were a famous singing duo in the 1960s, known for their hits like \"I Got You Babe.\" They were married from 1964 to 1975, so 1971 falls within that time frame.\n\nCher has a very distinctive voice, often described as raspy, which has been a hallmark of her career. She's had a long and successful career in music, television, and film, but focusing on the music aspect, especially around 1971, I need to see if she released a self-titled album that year.\n\nLooking back at Cher's discography, I see that she did release several albums in the early 1970s. For instance, \"Cher\" was released in 1969, which was a self-titled album, but that's two years before 1971. Then there's \"Cher Sings Bonanza,\" which is a soundtrack album from 1969 as well.\n\nIn 1971, Cher released an album called \"Cher,\" but I think that might be the one you're referring to. Wait, no, that was in 1969. Let me check again. Actually, there's another album titled \"Cher\" released in 1971, which might be the one you're thinking of.\n\nBut to make sure, let's confirm some details. Cher was indeed married to Sonny Bono at the time, and her vocal style was already established by then. So, it makes sense that a self-titled album from 1971 would feature her singing with that distinctive raspy voice.\n\nMoreover, in 1971, Cher was transitioning from the folk-rock sound of the 1960s to more pop-oriented material, so the album might reflect that evolution in her musical style.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer to your question is Cher. She is the American singer with the distinctive raspy voice, married to Sonny Bono, who released a self-titled album in 1971.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Cher}} \\]"
