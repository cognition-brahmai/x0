        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains moving towards each other from stations A and B, which are 450 km apart. The first train leaves station A at 8:00 AM traveling at 60 km/h, and the second train leaves station B at 9:00 AM traveling at 90 km/h. I need to find out when they will meet.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how far each train has traveled by the time they meet. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up, which might help in calculating the time they take to meet.\n\nLet me think about the time each train has been traveling. The first train starts at 8:00 AM, and the second train starts at 9:00 AM, so the first train has been traveling for one hour before the second train starts.\n\nIn that one hour, the first train would have covered some distance. Let's calculate that.\n\nDistance covered by the first train in one hour:\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time\n\nDistance = 60 km/h \u00d7 1 h = 60 km\n\nSo, by 9:00 AM, the first train has already covered 60 km, meaning the remaining distance between the two trains at 9:00 AM is:\n\n450 km - 60 km = 390 km\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other, starting at 9:00 AM. The first train is going at 60 km/h, and the second train at 90 km/h. Their relative speed is the sum of their speeds since they're moving towards each other.\n\nRelative speed = 60 km/h + 90 km/h = 150 km/h\n\nNow, they have 390 km between them at 9:00 AM, and they're approaching each other at 150 km/h.\n\nTime taken to cover 390 km at 150 km/h is:\n\nTime = distance / speed\n\nTime = 390 km / 150 km/h = 2.6 hours\n\n2.6 hours is 2 hours and 0.6 hours. To convert 0.6 hours to minutes:\n\n0.6 hours \u00d7 60 minutes/hour = 36 minutes\n\nSo, the time taken for the trains to meet after 9:00 AM is 2 hours and 36 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the meeting time is:\n\n9:00 AM + 2 hours 36 minutes = 11:36 AM\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the problem in terms of the total distance and the times each train has been traveling.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time after 9:00 AM as t hours.\n\nIn t hours, the first train would have traveled an additional 60 km/h \u00d7 t hours.\n\nSimilarly, the second train would have traveled 90 km/h \u00d7 t hours.\n\nBut the first train has already traveled 60 km by 9:00 AM.\n\nSo, the total distance covered by both trains when they meet should be equal to the initial distance between them, which is 450 km.\n\nTherefore:\n\nDistance covered by first train + distance covered by second train = 450 km\n\n(60 km + 60t km) + 90t km = 450 km\n\n60 + 60t + 90t = 450\n\n60 + 150t = 450\n\n150t = 450 - 60\n\n150t = 390\n\nt = 390 / 150\n\nt = 2.6 hours\n\nAgain, that's 2 hours and 36 minutes.\n\nSo, starting from 9:00 AM, adding 2 hours brings us to 11:00 AM, and then adding 36 minutes brings us to 11:36 AM.\n\nTherefore, the two trains will meet at 11:36 AM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11:36 \\text{ AM}} \\]"
