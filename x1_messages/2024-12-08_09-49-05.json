        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about a train traveling between two cities, City A and City B. The distance between them is 350 miles. The train takes 5 hours to go from City A to City B, and then 7 hours to come back from City B to City A because of bad weather. I need to find the average speed of the train for the entire trip.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. So, I think I need to find the total distance that the train traveled and the total time it took, and then divide one by the other.\n\nThe distance from City A to City B is 350 miles, and the return trip is also 350 miles. So, the total distance is 350 miles plus 350 miles, which is 700 miles.\n\nNow, for the time. Going from City A to City B takes 5 hours, and coming back takes 7 hours. So, the total time is 5 hours plus 7 hours, which is 12 hours.\n\nSo, the average speed should be the total distance divided by the total time, which is 700 miles divided by 12 hours. Let me do that calculation.\n\n700 divided by 12. Let's see, 12 times 58 is 696, which is less than 700. So, 58 with a remainder of 4. So, that's 58 and 4/12, which simplifies to 58 and 1/3 hours. But since we're dealing with miles per hour, maybe I should leave it as a decimal.\n\nAlternatively, I can divide 700 by 12 directly. 12 goes into 700 how many times? Well, 12 times 58 is 696, as I thought before, with a remainder of 4. So, 58.333... repeating. So, the average speed is approximately 58.33 miles per hour.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should check if this is the correct way to calculate average speed. I recall that sometimes, when dealing with average speeds, especially when the speeds are different for each leg of the trip, there might be a better way to calculate it using harmonic mean or something like that.\n\nLet me think about it. The average speed is indeed the total distance over the total time, so I think what I did is correct. But maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nLet me calculate the speed for each leg of the trip. Going from City A to City B: 350 miles in 5 hours. So, speed is 350 divided by 5, which is 70 miles per hour.\n\nComing back from City B to City A: 350 miles in 7 hours. So, speed is 350 divided by 7, which is 50 miles per hour.\n\nNow, if I were to find the average of these two speeds, it would be 70 plus 50 divided by 2, which is 120 divided by 2, which is 60 miles per hour. But that's not the same as what I calculated earlier, which was 58.33 miles per hour.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nI think I remember now. The average speed is not the arithmetic mean of the two speeds, but rather the total distance over the total time. So, the correct way is the first method I used, which gives me 58.33 miles per hour.\n\nBut why is there a difference between the two methods? Let me see.\n\nThe arithmetic mean of the two speeds is 60 miles per hour, but that doesn't take into account the time spent at each speed. The train spent more time traveling at the slower speed because it took 7 hours to come back, compared to 5 hours going to City B.\n\nSo, the average speed should be weighted towards the slower speed, which is why it's less than the arithmetic mean.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct average speed is 58.33 miles per hour.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for average speed when the distances are equal, which is the harmonic mean of the two speeds. The harmonic mean of two speeds, v1 and v2, is given by 2*(v1*v2)/(v1 + v2).\n\nSo, plugging in the values: 2*(70*50)/(70 + 50) = 2*3500/120 = 7000/120 = 58.333... miles per hour. So, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the correct average speed is approximately 58.33 miles per hour.\n\nI think I've got it now. It's important to remember that average speed is total distance over total time, especially when the speeds for each leg of the trip are different.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{58.\\overline{3} \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]"
