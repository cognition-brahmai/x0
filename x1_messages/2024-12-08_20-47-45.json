        "content": "The term for the phenomenon where the expression of one gene is influenced by the presence of one or more 'modifier genes' is A. Epistasis.\n\nTo elaborate, epistasis refers to the interaction between genes where the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more other genes. In other words, the expression of a particular gene (the main gene) is modified or controlled by one or more modifier genes. This can lead to a variety of phenotypic outcomes that are not simply additive but rather involve complex interactions between different genes.\n\nLet me briefly explain the other options to ensure clarity:\n\n- B. Pleiotropy: This refers to a single gene that influences multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits. For example, a gene that affects both eye color and bone density would be exhibiting pleiotropy.\n\n- C. Polygenic inheritance: This involves the expression of a phenotype that is controlled by two or more genes, each contributing additively to the final trait. Examples include human height and skin color, which are influenced by multiple genes.\n\n- D. Codominance: This is a type of inheritance where both alleles for a gene are fully expressed in individuals who are heterozygous for that gene. A classic example is the ABO blood group system, where both the A and B alleles are expressed in AB blood type.\n\nSo, in summary, epistasis is the correct term for the scenario where one gene's expression is modified by one or more other genes."
