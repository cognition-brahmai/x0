        "content": "Referees use yellow and red cards in soccer to communicate disciplinary actions clearly and consistently to players, coaches, and spectators. The card system was introduced by English referee Ken Aston in the 1970 FIFA World Cup to overcome language barriers and ensure that everyone understands the decisions being made on the field.\n\nYellow cards are used to caution players for misconduct, such as unsporting behavior, dissent, delaying the game, or committing a foul that doesn't warrant an immediate red card. A player who receives two yellow cards in the same match automatically gets a red card and is sent off the field.\n\nRed cards are used to send players off the field immediately, meaning they must leave the game and cannot be replaced. A red card can be given for serious offenses like violent conduct, denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, or receiving a second yellow card in the same match.\n\nThe use of cards helps maintain order and fairness in the game by providing a standardized way to deal with misconduct, ensuring that all participants are on the same page regarding the rules and consequences."
