        "content": "Let's see. So, there are three people in a room, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total.\n\nOkay, first, I can list out the people. Let's call them Person A, Person B, and Person C.\n\nNow, Person A needs to shake hands with every other person, which would be Person B and Person C. So, that's two handshakes for Person A.\n\nNext, Person B has already shaken hands with Person A, so they only need to shake hands with Person C. That's one handshake for Person B.\n\nPerson C has already shaken hands with Person A and Person B, so they don't need to shake hands with anyone else.\n\nSo, total handshakes: two from Person A and one from Person B, which adds up to three handshakes.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to calculate this without listing everyone out? I remember something about combinations. Like, how many ways can you choose two people out of three to shake hands?\n\nYes, that makes sense because a handshake involves two people.\n\nSo, the formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n is 3 (the three people), and k is 2 (since a handshake is between two people).\n\nSo, C(3, 2) = 3! / (2! * (3 - 2)!) = (6) / (2 * 1) = 6 / 2 = 3.\n\nOkay, that matches what I found earlier by listing them out.\n\nIs there a general formula for this? Like, if there were more people, say four or five, how many handshakes would there be?\n\nLet me try with four people.\n\nUsing the combination formula, C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = 24 / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6 handshakes.\n\nLet me verify that by listing them out.\n\nFour people: A, B, C, D.\n\nA shakes hands with B, C, D: that's three handshakes.\n\nB has already shaken hands with A, so they shake hands with C and D: two handshakes.\n\nC has already shaken hands with A and B, so they shake hands with D: one handshake.\n\nD has already shaken hands with A, B, and C, so no new handshakes.\n\nTotal: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 handshakes, which matches the combination formula.\n\nSimilarly, for five people:\n\nC(5, 2) = 10 handshakes.\n\nListing them out: A with B, C, D, E: four handshakes.\n\nB with C, D, E: three handshakes.\n\nC with D, E: two handshakes.\n\nD with E: one handshake.\n\nTotal: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 handshakes.\n\nSo, the pattern is that for n people, the total number of handshakes is C(n, 2), which is n*(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, going back to the original problem with three people: C(3, 2) = 3*(3-1)/2 = 3*2/2 = 3 handshakes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is three handshakes.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using graphs or something like that?\n\nI recall that in graph theory, a handshake corresponds to an edge between two vertices.\n\nSo, if each person is a vertex, and each handshake is an edge, then the total number of handshakes is equal to the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices.\n\nAnd the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is indeed C(n, 2) = n*(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, that's another way to look at it.\n\nBut since this is a simple problem, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to realize that each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once.\n\nSo, for n people, each person shakes hands with (n-1) other people.\n\nBut since each handshake involves two people, we have to divide by two to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, total handshakes = n*(n-1)/2.\n\nFor n=3: 3*2/2 = 3 handshakes.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I keep arriving at three handshakes.\n\nIs there any chance that the answer could be different?\n\nWell, maybe if someone shakes hands with themselves, but the problem says \"every other person,\" so that shouldn't happen.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies that each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, so no repeated handshakes.\n\nSo, no, three handshakes seems correct.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nSuppose there are four people: A, B, C, D.\n\nA shakes hands with B, C, D: three handshakes.\n\nB has already shaken hands with A, so they shake hands with C and D: two handshakes.\n\nC has already shaken hands with A and B, so they shake hands with D: one handshake.\n\nD has already shaken hands with A, B, and C, so no new handshakes.\n\nTotal: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 handshakes.\n\nWait, but if I use the formula n*(n-1)/2 for n=4: 4*3/2=6, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n=5: 5*4/2=10.\n\nSo, again, for n=3: 3*2/2=3 handshakes.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nMaybe I can think about it in terms of addition.\n\nFirst person shakes hands with two others: 2 handshakes.\n\nSecond person has already shaken hands with the first, so only one new handshake with the third person.\n\nThird person has already shaken hands with the first and second, so no new handshakes.\n\nTotal: 2 + 1 = 3 handshakes.\n\nSame result.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways.\n\nThe answer is three handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
