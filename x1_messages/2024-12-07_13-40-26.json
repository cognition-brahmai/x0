        "content": "Let's see. There are 7 days in a week, so in 12 weeks, there would be 12 times 7, which is 84 days. If the factory produces 250 units each day, then over 84 days, it would produce 250 units per day times 84 days. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 250 multiplied by 84. I can break this down: 250 times 80 is 20,000, and 250 times 4 is 1,000. So, 20,000 plus 1,000 equals 21,000 units.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. 12 weeks is indeed 84 days, and producing 250 units per day would total 250 times 84. But I think I can verify this another way.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the weekly production first. 250 units per day times 7 days per week is 1,750 units per week. Then, over 12 weeks, it would be 1,750 times 12. Let's compute that.\n\n1,750 times 10 is 17,500, and 1,750 times 2 is 3,500. Adding those together, 17,500 plus 3,500 equals 21,000 units.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. So, the factory will produce 21,000 units in 12 weeks.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any variables I might have missed. For example, are there any holidays or downtime when the factory doesn't produce anything? The question doesn't mention any, so I'll assume production is continuous with no breaks.\n\nAlso, it's possible that the factory's production rate might change, but again, the question states that it produces 250 units every day, so I'll take that as a constant rate.\n\nSo, my final answer is 21,000 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21000} \\]"
