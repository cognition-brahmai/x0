Each stage in your strategy should have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the product of one of the available operations given an input string. This could be the original question, earlier evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nTools at your disposal include:\nBing[input]: A tool that enables users to conduct a Bing search for information. This tool is handy for locating websites that might contain the response to the user's question.\nURLReader[input]: Reads the content of a website given its URL. The input should be a single link and the output will be plain text content of the page.\nLinkSelector[input]: Selects the most pertinent links from a list of URLs based on the input query.\nQuerySolver[input]: A tool capable of answering questions based on an input text passage. The input must be a textual question that refers to a #E[n] variable, such as What is the tallest mountain, given #E1?\n\nOutput format should look like this:\nPlan: [initial action]\n#E1 = [call to function with input parameter]\nPlan: [subsequent action dependent on outcome of #E1]\n#E2 = [next call to function with input parameter, potentially referencing prior evidence, e.g., \"Given context #E1\"]\n...\nFinal Response: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: Who was the director of the movie Inception and what other movies have they directed?"

I have a few tools to help me with this: Bing to search the web, URLReader to read web pages, LinkSelector to choose the best links, and QuerySolver to answer questions based on text I provide.\n\nFirst, I should probably use Bing to search for \"Inception director\" to find out who directed the movie. So, I'll make that my first step.\n\nPlan: Use Bing to search for \"Inception director\".\n\n#E1 = Bing[\"Inception director\"]\n\nOnce I have the search results from Bing, I need to pick the most relevant links to visit and read their content. I can use LinkSelector to help me choose the best links from the search results.\n\nPlan: Use LinkSelector to pick the most relevant links from #E1.\n\n#E2 = LinkSelector[#E1]\n\nNow, with the selected links, I need to read the content of those web pages to find the information I need. I'll use URLReader for that.\n\nPlan: Use URLReader to read the content of the selected links.\n\n#E3 = URLReader[#E2]\n\nOnce I have the text content from those pages, I can use QuerySolver to answer my question based on that text. I need to find out who directed Inception and what other movies that director has directed.\n\nPlan: Use QuerySolver to find out who directed Inception and their other movies, based on #E3.\n\n#E4 = QuerySolver[\"Who was the director of the movie Inception and what other movies have they directed? Given context: #E3\"]\n\nFinally, I can provide the answer from #E4 as my response.\n\nFinal Response: #E4\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo solve this problem, we will develop a step-by-step strategy to identify the director of the movie \"Inception\" and determine other movies directed by the same individual. We will utilize a set of predefined tools to achieve this.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Search for the Director of \"Inception\"**:\n   - Use the `Bing` tool to perform a web search for \"Inception director\" to find the director's name.\n\n2. **Select Relevant Links**:\n   - Use the `LinkSelector` tool to choose the most pertinent links from the search results obtained in the first step.\n\n3. **Read Content from Selected Links**:\n   - Use the `URLReader` tool to extract text content from the selected links.\n\n4. **Extract Required Information**:\n   - Use the `QuerySolver` tool to parse the extracted text and answer the question about the director of \"Inception\" and other movies directed by the same person.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```plaintext\nPlan: Use Bing to search for \"Inception director\".\n#E1 = Bing[\"Inception director\"]\n\nPlan: Use LinkSelector to pick the most relevant links from #E1.\n#E2 = LinkSelector[#E1]\n\nPlan: Use URLReader to read the content of the selected links.\n#E3 = URLReader[#E2]\n\nPlan: Use QuerySolver to find out who directed Inception and their other movies, based on #E3.\n#E4 = QuerySolver[\"Who was the director of the movie Inception and what other movies have they directed? Given context: #E3\"]\n\nFinal Response: #E4\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Bing Search**:\n   - The `Bing` tool is used to perform a search for \"Inception director\", which will return a list of search results that potentially contain the director's name.\n\n2. **Link Selection**:\n   - The `LinkSelector` tool filters and selects the most relevant links from the search results, ensuring that we focus on high-quality sources for information.\n\n3. **Content Extraction**:\n   - The `URLReader` tool retrieves the text content from the selected links, providing a pool of data from which to extract the required information.\n\n4. **Query Solving**:\n   - The `QuerySolver` tool processes the extracted text to answer the specific question about the director of \"Inception\" and other movies directed by the same individual, using the context provided by the extracted text.\n\nThis systematic approach ensures that we efficiently and accurately find the required information using the available tools."
