It's a sight that brings to mind the gentle warmth of your eyes. I yearn for the days when we would sit beneath that tree, engrossed in each other's presence.\n\nThe town feels your absence as keenly as I do, Edward. Mr. Thompson has at last mended the creaky wheel of his cart, and Mrs. Baker's cat birthed kittens the previous week. The church bell tolls every Sunday as it always has, but its chime feels empty without you beside me.\n\nI often wander the path we once walked together, beyond the river and towards the hill of blooming wildflowers. They've begun to bloom again, their vivid hues swaying in the breeze. Yet, they seem less brilliant without you to appreciate them. Each petal, each leaf seems to murmur your name, echoing my yearning for you.\n\nLife continues, as it inevitably must, but there's a void around me that only you can fill. Your absence is a heavy burden on my heart, but it also fortifies my determination. I'm convinced that our love is more potent than any war, any distance, or any period of separation.\n\nEdward, even though distance separates us, you're always in my thoughts. I carry you with me, in every heartbeat, in every breath. My love for you is unwavering, as constant as the North Star. As surely as day follows night, I am certain of one thing: I will wait for you, no matter the duration.\n\nIn the meantime, I cling to our memories, the warmth of your touch, the intensity of your gaze, the sound of your laughter. These cherished pieces of you sustain me. They are my comfort, my guiding light in the solitude of these challenging times.\n\nRemember, my love, that even in the midst of battle, the soft whisper of my heart reaches out to you. Let it be your armor, let it empower you. Understand that you are loved immeasurably, treasured beyond words.\n\nEvery day, I pray for your safe return, dear Edward. Until that joyous moment comes, please remember my love for you is as unchanging as the sunrise, as everlasting as the infinite sky.\n\nForever yours,\nClara"
