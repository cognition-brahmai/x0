        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the car rental company charges a flat fee of $20 per day and an additional 10 cents per mile driven. The customer rented the car for 3 days and spent a total of $85. We need to find out how many miles they drove.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the cost structure. There's a daily flat fee and a per-mile charge. The flat fee is easy: it's $20 per day, regardless of how many miles are driven. The per-mile charge is 10 cents per mile, which means the more miles you drive, the more you pay in addition to the flat fee.\n\nSo, for 3 days, the total flat fee would be 3 days times $20 per day. Let me calculate that:\n\n3 days * $20/day = $60\n\nOkay, so the flat fee for 3 days is $60. But the customer spent a total of $85. That means the additional amount spent must be due to the miles driven.\n\nTo find out how much was spent on miles, I can subtract the flat fee from the total amount spent:\n\nTotal spent - Flat fee = Cost due to miles\n\n$85 - $60 = $25\n\nSo, $25 was spent on miles driven.\n\nNow, the charge per mile is 10 cents per mile. I need to find out how many miles correspond to $25.\n\nFirst, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The flat fee is in dollars, and the per-mile charge is in cents. To make it easier, I can convert the per-mile charge to dollars.\n\n10 cents per mile is equal to $0.10 per mile.\n\nNow, let's set up an equation to find the number of miles driven.\n\nLet m be the number of miles driven.\n\nThen, the cost due to miles is $0.10 per mile times m miles.\n\nSo, 0.10 * m = $25\n\nNow, I can solve for m:\n\nm = $25 / $0.10 per mile\n\nLet me do the division:\n\n$25 / $0.10 = 250\n\nSo, m = 250 miles\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFlat fee for 3 days: 3 * $20 = $60\n\nTotal spent: $85\n\nCost due to miles: $85 - $60 = $25\n\nPer-mile charge: $0.10 per mile\n\nNumber of miles: $25 / $0.10 = 250 miles\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can plug the value back into the original cost equation to verify.\n\nTotal cost = (flat fee per day * number of days) + (per-mile charge * number of miles)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n$85 = ($20 * 3) + ($0.10 * 250)\n\nCalculate:\n\n$60 + $25 = $85\n\nYes, it matches the total amount spent.\n\nTherefore, the customer drove 250 miles.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other factor that might have been missed.\n\nIs there any possibility that the flat fee includes a certain number of miles, and anything beyond that is charged at a different rate? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I assume it's a straightforward flat fee plus a per-mile charge.\n\nAlso, the problem states that the per-mile charge is 10 cents per mile, and I've used $0.10 per mile in my calculation, which is consistent.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the mile charge is per mile or per mile driven in a day. But again, the problem doesn't specify any daily limit, so I assume it's simply $0.10 per mile driven, regardless of the day.\n\nSo, I think 250 miles is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{250} \\]"
