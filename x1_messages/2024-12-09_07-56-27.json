        "content": "So there are 3 red balls and 5 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 8 balls. You draw one ball, put it back, and then draw another ball. You want to know the probability of drawing a red ball followed by a blue ball.\n\nFirst, since you're putting the ball back each time, each draw is independent. That means the outcome of the first draw doesn't affect the second draw.\n\nThe probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. So that's 3 red balls out of 8 total balls, which is 3/8.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of drawing a blue ball on the second draw is the number of blue balls divided by the total number of balls. That's 5 blue balls out of 8 total balls, which is 5/8.\n\nSince these are independent events, the probability of both events happening in sequence (first drawing a red ball and then a blue ball) is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, the probability is (3/8) * (5/8) = 15/64.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a red ball followed by a blue ball is 15/64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{64}} \\]"
