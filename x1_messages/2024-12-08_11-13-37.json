Born into slavery, she escaped and subsequently made some thirteen missions to rescue approximately seventy enslaved people, using the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the Underground Railroad.\n\nHarriet is often portrayed as a symbol of courage and freedom. Despite the constant threat of being captured or killed, she risked her life multiple times to help others escape from the clutches of slavery. She was not only brave but also highly strategic and resourceful, utilizing a variety of tactics to avoid detection during her rescue missions.\n\nShe was deeply religious and believed that her actions were guided by divine visions. Her faith gave her strength in the face of immense adversity and danger. It also inspired her to fight for justice and equality, not just through direct action but also through her work as a speaker and advocate for women's suffrage later in her life.\n\nDespite living most of her life in poverty, Harriet Tubman remained selfless and dedicated to helping others. She used her own home as a haven for those in need and continued to champion the cause of civil rights until her death.\nJessica: How long would it take you to travel to Philadelphia?"
