        "content": "So I've got this problem here. Let's see, there's a city with a population of 500,000 people, and 65% of them own cars. Then, out of those who own cars, 40% use them to commute to work. I need to find out how many people use cars to commute to work.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to find out how many people own cars. The population is 500,000, and 65% of them own cars. So, to find that number, I can calculate 65% of 500,000.\n\nLet me recall how to calculate percentages. To find a percentage of a number, you multiply the percentage by the number and then divide by 100. So, for car owners:\n\nCar owners = (65/100) * 500,000\n\nI can simplify that. 65 divided by 100 is 0.65, so:\n\nCar owners = 0.65 * 500,000\n\nNow, multiplying 0.65 by 500,000. Let's see, 0.65 times 500 is 325, and since there are three zeros in 500,000, it's 325,000.\n\nSo, 325,000 people own cars.\n\nNext, out of these car owners, 40% use their cars to commute to work. So, I need to find 40% of 325,000.\n\nAgain, using the percentage formula:\n\nCommuters by car = (40/100) * 325,000\n\n40 divided by 100 is 0.40, so:\n\nCommuters by car = 0.40 * 325,000\n\nMultiplying 0.40 by 325,000. 0.40 times 325 is 130, and with the three zeros, it's 130,000.\n\nSo, 130,000 people use cars to commute to work.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a simpler way to think about it. The total population is 500,000, 65% own cars, and 40% of those car owners use them to commute.\n\nSo, effectively, the number of people who use cars to commute is 40% of 65% of the total population.\n\nThat sounds like multiplying the percentages together and then applying that to the total population.\n\nSo, 40% of 65% is (40/100) * (65/100) = 0.40 * 0.65 = 0.26, or 26%.\n\nSo, 26% of the total population uses cars to commute to work.\n\nNow, 26% of 500,000 is:\n\nCommuters by car = (26/100) * 500,000 = 0.26 * 500,000 = 130,000\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 130,000 people use cars to commute to work.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to look at this. Is there any chance that some people who don't own cars are using cars to commute, maybe by sharing or something? But according to the problem, it only mentions car owners and their usage. So, I think it's safe to assume that only car owners are using their cars to commute.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"use cars to commute to work,\" so I don't think other car usage is being considered, like running errands or leisure drives.\n\nSo, yeah, my final answer is 130,000 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{130000} \\]"
