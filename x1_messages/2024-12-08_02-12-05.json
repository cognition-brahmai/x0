        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Java program that reads a text file line by line and prints each line reversed. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I cover all the bases here. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst things first, I need to read a text file in Java. I've done this before, but to refresh my memory, I know that Java has several ways to read files, like using FileReader, BufferedReader, or even some newer APIs introduced in later Java versions. Since I want this to be compatible with as many Java versions as possible, I'll stick with the good old BufferedReader.\n\nSo, I'll need to import java.io.BufferedReader and java.io.FileReader. Maybe also java.io.IOException, since reading files can throw exceptions that I need to handle.\n\nNext, I need to get the file name from the user. Probably, I'll take it as a command-line argument, so the user can specify which file to read when running the program. That way, it's flexible and doesn't hardcode any file names into the program.\n\nOnce I have the file name, I'll try to open the file using new FileReader(fileName), and then wrap it in a BufferedReader for efficient reading.\n\nNow, reading the file line by line: I'll use a loop that calls reader.readLine() in each iteration. This method returns null when there are no more lines to read, so that's my loop condition.\n\nInside the loop, for each line read, I need to reverse it and print it. Reversing a string in Java can be done in several ways. The most straightforward is to use new StringBuilder(line).reverse().toString(). That's simple and efficient.\n\nThen, I just print the reversed line using System.out.println(reversedLine).\n\nDon't forget to close the BufferedReader after finishing reading the file to free up system resources. In modern Java, I could use try-with-resources to handle this automatically, but to keep it simple and compatible with older Java versions, I'll just place the close() call in a finally block.\n\nAlso, I should handle the case where the file doesn't exist or can't be read for some reason. So, I'll catch any IOExceptions and print an error message to the user.\n\nLet me think about edge cases. What if the file is empty? Well, the loop shouldn't run at all, and the program should just exit cleanly. What if the file has lines with only spaces or empty lines? The program should still reverse them, which in the case of empty lines, would just print another empty line.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the file might contain lines with different encodings or special characters. As long as I'm consistent with the character encoding when reading the file, it should handle them properly. BufferedReader uses the default character encoding, which is usually sufficient, but if needed, I could specify an encoding.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered the main points. Now, let's sketch out the code structure.\n\nFirst, the class definition:\n\npublic class ReverseLines {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        // Check if the file name is provided\n\n        if (args.length == 0) {\n\n            System.out.println(\"Please provide the file name as a command-line argument.\");\n\n            return;\n\n        }\n\n        String fileName = args[0];\n\n        BufferedReader reader = null;\n\n        try {\n\n            reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName));\n\n            String line;\n\n            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n\n                String reversedLine = new StringBuilder(line).reverse().toString();\n\n                System.out.println(reversedLine);\n\n            }\n\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n\n            System.out.println(\"Error reading the file: \" + e.getMessage());\n\n        } finally {\n\n            if (reader != null) {\n\n                try {\n\n                    reader.close();\n\n                } catch (IOException e) {\n\n                    System.out.println(\"Error closing the file: \" + e.getMessage());\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nLet me test this logic in my mind. If I run the program with a file name as an argument, it should read each line, reverse it, and print it. If the file doesn't exist, it should catch the IOException and print an error message. If no file name is provided, it should prompt the user to provide one.\n\nSeems solid. I might want to add some comments to the code for clarity, but since the task didn't specify, maybe it's not necessary.\n\nWait a minute, in the task, it says \"prints each line reversed.\" Does that include the newline characters, or should the output be a single continuous string with reversed lines? I think it's safer to assume that each reversed line should be printed on its own line, maintaining the original line separation.\n\nAlso, regarding the reversal, should I reverse the entire line including any trailing newline characters? But since readLine() in BufferedReader removes the line separators, I'm just reversing the content before the separator, which should be fine.\n\nOne more thing: what if the file is very large? Well, since I'm reading it line by line, memory-wise, it should handle large files okay, as I'm not storing the entire file in memory.\n\nAlright, I think this should work. I can give it a try with a sample text file to verify.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Java program that reads a text file line by line and prints each line reversed, you can follow the steps below:\n\n1. **Import necessary classes**: You will need `java.io.BufferedReader`, `java.io.FileReader`, and `java.io.IOException`.\n\n2. **Read the file name from command-line arguments**: Ensure that the user provides the file name as a command-line argument.\n\n3. **Read the file line by line**: Use `BufferedReader` to read the file efficiently.\n\n4. **Reverse each line and print it**: Use `StringBuilder` to reverse each line read from the file.\n\n5. **Handle exceptions and close the reader**: Catch any `IOExceptions` and ensure the reader is closed after reading.\n\nHere is the complete Java code that accomplishes this task:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class ReverseLines {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Check if the file name is provided\n        if (args.length == 0) {\n            System.out.println(\"Please provide the file name as a command-line argument.\");\n            return;\n        }\n\n        String fileName = args[0];\n        BufferedReader reader = null;\n\n        try {\n            reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName));\n            String line;\n\n            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n                String reversedLine = new StringBuilder(line).reverse().toString();\n                System.out.println(reversedLine);\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            System.out.println(\"Error reading the file: \" + e.getMessage());\n        } finally {\n            if (reader != null) {\n                try {\n                    reader.close();\n                } catch (IOException e) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Error closing the file: \" + e.getMessage());\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Check for Command-Line Argument**: The program first checks if a file name is provided as a command-line argument. If not, it prompts the user to provide one.\n\n2. **Reading the File**: It uses `BufferedReader` wrapped around `FileReader` to read the file efficiently line by line.\n\n3. **Reversing and Printing Lines**: For each line read, it reverses the line using `StringBuilder` and prints the reversed line.\n\n4. **Exception Handling**: It catches and handles `IOExceptions` that might occur during file reading or closing, ensuring that any errors are gracefully managed.\n\n5. **Resource Management**: The `BufferedReader` is closed in the `finally` block to ensure that the file is properly closed after operations, even if an error occurs."
