Each step of your plan should have corresponding evidence which will be the output of one of the functions given an input string that can be the user's query, previous evidence values or both.\n\nHere are the tools you can use:\nWebSearch[input]: A tool that allows users to search for information on the internet. This function is useful in finding sites that may contain answers to the user's question.\nTextScraper[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkPicker[input]: Extracts links from plain text and provides a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nInfoExtractor[input]: Question answering language model, particularly effective in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe format of the output should be as follows:\nPlan: [first action to take based on the input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What are some notable achievements of the current president of Microsoft?"
