        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're told that in a school, there are 12 boys for every 10 girls, and the total number of students is 120. We need to find out how many girls there are.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ratio given: 12 boys for every 10 girls. That means for every group of 12 boys, there are 10 girls. So, the total number of students in each such group would be 12 boys + 10 girls = 22 students.\n\nNow, the total number of students in the school is 120. To find out how many such groups of 22 students there are in the school, I can divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group:\n\n120 \u00f7 22 = 5.4545...\n\nHmm, that doesn't give me a whole number. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe instead of thinking about dividing into groups of 22, I should think in terms of proportions.\n\nLet me consider the ratio of boys to girls, which is 12:10. This can be simplified by dividing both numbers by 2, which gives 6:5. So, for every 6 boys, there are 5 girls.\n\nNow, let's let the number of boys be 6x and the number of girls be 5x, where x is a common multiplier.\n\nThe total number of students is the sum of boys and girls:\n\n6x + 5x = 11x\n\nWe know that the total number of students is 120, so:\n\n11x = 120\n\nTo find x, I can divide both sides by 11:\n\nx = 120 \u00f7 11 \u2248 10.909\n\nHmm, x isn't a whole number, which seems odd because the number of students should be whole numbers.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider that the ratio 12:10 doesn't need to be simplified. Let me try again with the original ratio.\n\nLet me assume that the number of boys is 12k and the number of girls is 10k, where k is a positive integer.\n\nThen, the total number of students is:\n\n12k + 10k = 22k\n\nWe know that 22k = 120\n\nSo, k = 120 \u00f7 22 = 120/22 = 60/11 \u2248 5.4545\n\nAgain, k isn't a whole number. This suggests that maybe the ratio isn't being applied correctly, or perhaps there's a different approach I should take.\n\nLet me try using fractions. The ratio of boys to girls is 12:10, which can be expressed as boys being 12/22 of the total students and girls being 10/22 of the total students.\n\nWait, 12 + 10 = 22, so the fraction of the total that are boys is 12/22 and girls is 10/22.\n\nSimplifying these fractions:\n\nBoys: 12/22 = 6/11\n\nGirls: 10/22 = 5/11\n\nSo, the fraction of the total students that are girls is 5/11.\n\nGiven that the total number of students is 120, the number of girls can be found by multiplying the total by the fraction that are girls:\n\nNumber of girls = 5/11 \u00d7 120\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n5 \u00d7 120 = 600\n\n600 \u00f7 11 \u2248 54.5454...\n\nSo, approximately 54.5454 girls. But the number of girls should be a whole number. Maybe I need to round it to 55.\n\nWait, but 5/11 of 120 is exactly 54.5454..., which suggests that the exact number is 54.5454..., but since we can't have half a student, perhaps there's an error in my approach.\n\nLet me try another method. Let's use algebra.\n\nLet g represent the number of girls.\n\nThen, based on the ratio, the number of boys is (12/10) * g, because for every 10 girls, there are 12 boys.\n\nSo, number of boys = (12/10)g = (6/5)g\n\nTotal students = boys + girls = (6/5)g + g = (6/5)g + (5/5)g = (11/5)g\n\nWe know the total students are 120:\n\n(11/5)g = 120\n\nTo find g, multiply both sides by 5/11:\n\ng = 120 \u00d7 (5/11) = 600/11 \u2248 54.5454...\n\nAgain, I get the same result. So, perhaps the problem is designed such that the number of girls isn't a whole number, which doesn't make sense in reality. But since we're dealing with people, the number should be a whole number.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or in my approach. Let me double-check the ratio.\n\nThe problem says \"12 boys for every 10 girls.\" Is that interpreted correctly? Maybe it's not a direct ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a percentage or some other proportion.\n\nWait, maybe it's a probability. But no, it's about the number of students.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to set up the equation.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the ratio is 12:10, which simplifies to 6:5.\n\nSo, for every 6 boys, there are 5 girls.\n\nLet the number of boys be 6k and girls be 5k, where k is a positive integer.\n\nThen, total students = 6k + 5k = 11k = 120\n\nSo, k = 120 / 11 \u2248 10.909\n\nThen, number of girls = 5k \u2248 5 \u00d7 10.909 \u2248 54.545\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nThis suggests that either the problem has a mistake, or perhaps k isn't intended to be an integer.\n\nBut in reality, the number of students should be whole numbers.\n\nMaybe the ratio is meant to be applied differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is not being taken as parts of the whole.\n\nLet me try considering the ratio as boys to the total number of students.\n\nWait, no, it's \"12 boys for every 10 girls,\" which is a direct ratio between boys and girls, not boys to total students.\n\nMaybe I should set up the ratio differently.\n\nLet me set up the ratio as boys : girls = 12 : 10\n\nSo, boys / girls = 12 / 10 = 6 / 5\n\nTherefore, boys = (6/5) * girls\n\nNow, total students = boys + girls = (6/5)girls + girls = (11/5)girls\n\nGiven that total students = 120:\n\n(11/5)girls = 120\n\nSo, girls = 120 * (5/11) = 600 / 11 \u2248 54.5454...\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nThis suggests that the number of girls is approximately 54.5454, but since we can't have a fraction of a student, perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number, which would be 55 girls.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total number of students isn't exactly 120, or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio isn't being applied correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is meant to be applied to groups, and there are multiple groups.\n\nLet me assume that each group consists of 12 boys and 10 girls, totaling 22 students per group.\n\nThen, the number of such groups in the school would be 120 / 22 \u2248 5.4545 groups.\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a group, perhaps there are 5 full groups and a partial group.\n\n5 full groups would account for 5 \u00d7 22 = 110 students.\n\nThen, there are 120 - 110 = 10 students left.\n\nIn each group, there are 12 boys and 10 girls.\n\nSo, in 5 full groups, there are 5 \u00d7 12 = 60 boys and 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 girls.\n\nNow, with 10 students left, and considering the ratio, perhaps there is an additional group with fewer students.\n\nBut the ratio is 12 boys to 10 girls, so for 10 students, it's not possible to maintain the exact ratio of 12:10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the remaining 10 students are all girls, or all boys, or some combination.\n\nThis seems too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is meant to be applied directly to the total number of students.\n\nLet me try calculating the number of girls as a proportion of the total.\n\nThe ratio of girls to the total number of students would be 10 / (12 + 10) = 10 / 22 = 5 / 11\n\nSo, the number of girls would be (5/11) \u00d7 120 \u2248 54.5454...\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nThis suggests that the exact number is 600 / 11, which is approximately 54.5454.\n\nGiven that we can't have a fraction of a student, perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number.\n\nRounding 54.5454 to the nearest whole number gives 55 girls.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have exact whole numbers, and there's an error in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is not 12:10, but something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is meant to be 12 boys for every 10 girls, but in reality, the numbers need to be adjusted to fit the total.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is meant to be 6:5, which is simpler.\n\nLet me try assuming the ratio is 6:5.\n\nSo, for every 6 boys, there are 5 girls.\n\nLet the number of boys be 6k and girls be 5k.\n\nTotal students = 6k + 5k = 11k = 120\n\nSo, k = 120 / 11 \u2248 10.909\n\nThen, girls = 5k \u2248 54.545\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nThis suggests that the problem may have a mistake, or perhaps it's intended to have a fractional number, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total number of students isn't exactly 120, or perhaps there's a typo in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is meant to be 12 boys to 10 girls, but in reality, it's an approximate ratio, and the exact numbers need to be determined accordingly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the school has 55 girls and 65 boys, which totals 120 students.\n\nBut let's check the ratio: 65 boys to 55 girls is 65:55, which simplifies to 13:11.\n\nBut the original ratio was 12:10, which simplifies to 6:5.\n\nSo, 13:11 is not equal to 6:5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the school has 54 girls and 66 boys.\n\n66:54 simplifies to 11:9, which is still not equal to 6:5.\n\nAlternatively, 55 girls and 65 boys: 65:55 is 13:11, which is not equal to 6:5.\n\nIt seems like there isn't a combination of whole numbers that satisfies both the ratio and the total number of students.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem expects us to accept a fractional number of students, which doesn't make sense in reality.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have an approximate number, and we should round to the nearest whole number.\n\nIn that case, the number of girls would be approximately 55.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to solving this problem.\n\nLet me try setting up an equation based on the ratio.\n\nLet the number of girls be g.\n\nThen, the number of boys is (12/10)g = (6/5)g\n\nTotal students: g + (6/5)g = (11/5)g = 120\n\nSo, g = 120 \u00d7 (5/11) = 600 / 11 \u2248 54.5454...\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the ratio is 12:10, which is equivalent to 6:5.\n\nSo, the fraction of students who are girls is 5/(6+5) = 5/11\n\nTherefore, number of girls = (5/11) \u00d7 120 \u2248 54.5454...\n\nOnce more, the same result.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem is intended to have an approximate number, and we should round to 55 girls.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, and the total number of students should be different to yield whole numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio should have been given in a way that divides evenly into 120.\n\nFor example, if the ratio were 12 boys to 12 girls, then total students would be 24 per group, and 120 / 24 = 5 groups, leading to 5 \u00d7 12 = 60 boys and 5 \u00d7 12 = 60 girls.\n\nBut in this problem, the ratio is 12 boys to 10 girls, which doesn't divide evenly into 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is meant to be 12 boys to 10 girls, but the total is 120, which isn't a multiple of 22, leading to fractional students.\n\nGiven all this, perhaps the problem expects us to accept the fractional number and round it to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, the number of girls is approximately 55.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation of the ratio.\n\nWait, maybe the ratio is meant to be 12 boys for every 10 girls, which can be expressed as boys = (12/10) girls.\n\nThen, total students = boys + girls = (12/10)g + g = (22/10)g = 120\n\nSo, g = 120 \u00d7 (10/22) = 1200 / 22 \u2248 54.5454...\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nThis suggests that no matter how I approach the problem, I end up with the same fractional number.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is designed to have an approximate number, and we should accept that there are approximately 55 girls in the school.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup, and the total number of students should be a multiple of 22 to yield whole numbers.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given information, the number of girls in the school is approximately 55.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{55} \\]"
