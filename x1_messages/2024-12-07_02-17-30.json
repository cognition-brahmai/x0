        "content": "Let's see. So, the store has a deal where for every 5 items you buy, you get an extra one for free. And the question is, if someone buys 27 items, how many free items do they get?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the deal. For every 5 items purchased, you get 1 free. So, it's like for every group of 5 items, you get another one without paying for it.\n\nSo, if someone buys 27 items, I need to find out how many groups of 5 are there in 27. That should tell me how many free items they get.\n\nTo find out how many groups of 5 are in 27, I can divide 27 by 5.\n\n27 divided by 5 is 5 with a remainder of 2, because 5 times 5 is 25, and 27 minus 25 is 2.\n\nSo, they get 5 free items for the 25 items they bought, and they have 2 items left that don't qualify for the discount because you need 5 to get one free.\n\nWait a minute, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again.\n\nIf for every 5 bought, you get 1 free, then the total number of items you get is the number you buy plus the free ones.\n\nSo, if you buy 5 items, you get 1 free, so total items is 6.\n\nIf you buy 10, you get 2 free, total is 12.\n\nSo, for 27 items bought, how many free items do they get?\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of sets. Each set consists of 5 bought plus 1 free, so 6 items in total.\n\nSo, if each set is 6 items, and they buy 27 items, how many sets is that?\n\n27 divided by 6 is 4.5. But you can't have half a set, so maybe they get 4 sets, which would be 4 free items.\n\nBut wait, if they buy 27 items, and each set requires them to buy 5 to get 1 free, then it's different.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSuppose they buy 27 items. For every 5 bought, they get 1 free.\n\nSo, the number of free items is equal to the integer division of the number of items bought by 5.\n\nIn other words, free items = floor(27 / 5) = 5.\n\nSo, they get 5 free items.\n\nBut earlier I thought about sets of 6, but that might not be the right way to look at it.\n\nLet me check with a smaller number to see which approach is correct.\n\nSuppose they buy 5 items. According to the deal, for every 5 bought, get 1 free. So, they should get 1 free item, total of 6 items.\n\nIf they buy 10, they should get 2 free, total of 12.\n\nIf they buy 15, they get 3 free, total of 18.\n\nIf they buy 20, they get 4 free, total of 24.\n\nIf they buy 25, they get 5 free, total of 30.\n\nIf they buy 27, it's 25 plus 2 extra.\n\nSo, for 25, they get 5 free, total of 30.\n\nWith 2 extra bought, do they get any additional free items?\n\nAccording to the deal, for every 5 bought, you get 1 free. So, the extra 2 don't qualify for another free item because they haven't reached the 5 required.\n\nTherefore, for 27 bought, they get 5 free items.\n\nWait, but another way to look at it is that the free items are directly proportional to the number of items bought, in increments of 5.\n\nSo, free items = floor(bought items / 5).\n\nIn this case, floor(27 / 5) = floor(5.4) = 5.\n\nSo, 5 free items.\n\nAlternatively, some stores might have different policies, like rounding up or something else, but based on the information given, it seems straightforward.\n\nSo, the answer should be 5 free items.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
