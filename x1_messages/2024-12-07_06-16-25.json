        "content": "The Amazon Rainforest is indeed often referred to as the \"lungs of the Earth\" due to its significant role in producing oxygen and regulating the global climate. Spanning across nine countries in South America, it's a vast and diverse ecosystem. Now, regarding your question about which country contains the largest portion of the rainforest, I believe it's Brazil. Brazil holds the majority, covering approximately 60% of the Amazon Rainforest. The remaining portions are distributed among countries like Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. It's fascinating how this natural wonder spreads across so many nations, each playing a crucial role in its preservation and management."
