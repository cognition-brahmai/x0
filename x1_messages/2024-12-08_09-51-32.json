        "content": "Let's see. The baker uses 3 cups of flour to make 12 muffins. I need to find out how many cups of flour are needed to make 60 muffins. Hmm, this seems like a proportion problem.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much flour is used per muffin. If 3 cups make 12 muffins, then the amount of flour per muffin is 3 cups divided by 12 muffins. That is:\n\n3 cups / 12 muffins = 0.25 cups per muffin\n\nNow, if I need to make 60 muffins, I can multiply the amount of flour per muffin by the number of muffins:\n\n0.25 cups/muffin * 60 muffins = 15 cups\n\nSo, the baker will need 15 cups of flour to make 60 muffins.\n\nWait a minute, let me check that again. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. I know that proportions can be set up as ratios, so the ratio of flour to muffins should stay the same.\n\nSo, 3 cups / 12 muffins = x cups / 60 muffins\n\nTo find x, I can cross-multiply:\n\n3 cups * 60 muffins = 12 muffins * x cups\n\n180 = 12x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 12:\n\n180 / 12 = x\n\n15 = x\n\nSo, again, x = 15 cups\n\nThat matches my first answer. Good, it seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to see how many times larger 60 muffins is compared to 12 muffins. Since 60 divided by 12 is 5, it's 5 times larger. Therefore, the baker will need 5 times the amount of flour.\n\n3 cups * 5 = 15 cups\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think 15 cups is the correct amount of flour needed to make 60 muffins.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
