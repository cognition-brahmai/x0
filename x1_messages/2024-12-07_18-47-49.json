The bald eagle is a real bird species native to North America, and its call is indeed a well-known sound in popular culture. However, it's important to note that in many films and television shows, the call of a different bird, the red-tailed hawk, is often used instead of the bald eagle's call because the eagle's voice is higher and more shrill, which some producers feel doesn't convey the same sense of power and grandeur.\n\nSo, to directly answer your question: The iconic cry often associated with the bald eagle in popular culture is actually the call of the red-tailed hawk.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!\n"
