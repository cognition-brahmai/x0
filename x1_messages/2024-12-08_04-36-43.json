        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here. In a town, 1/3 of the people have blue eyes, 1/4 have green eyes, and the rest have brown eyes. Also, there are 48 more people with brown eyes than those with blue eyes. I need to find out how many people live in the town.\n\nOkay, first step is to understand what's being given. So, fractions of the town's population:\n\n- Blue eyes: 1/3\n\n- Green eyes: 1/4\n\n- Brown eyes: the rest\n\nAnd, the number of people with brown eyes is 48 more than those with blue eyes.\n\nLet me denote the total population of the town as P.\n\nSo, number of people with blue eyes = (1/3)P\n\nNumber with green eyes = (1/4)P\n\nNumber with brown eyes = P - [(1/3)P + (1/4)P]\n\nSimplify that:\n\nFirst, find a common denominator for 3 and 4, which is 12.\n\n(1/3)P = (4/12)P\n\n(1/4)P = (3/12)P\n\nSo, (4/12)P + (3/12)P = (7/12)P\n\nTherefore, brown eyes = P - (7/12)P = (12/12)P - (7/12)P = (5/12)P\n\nNow, it's given that the number of people with brown eyes is 48 more than those with blue eyes.\n\nSo, (5/12)P = (1/3)P + 48\n\nAlright, now I need to solve for P.\n\nFirst, let's get all terms involving P on one side.\n\n(5/12)P - (1/3)P = 48\n\nAgain, common denominator for 12 and 3 is 12.\n\n(5/12)P - (4/12)P = 48\n\n(1/12)P = 48\n\nNow, to find P, multiply both sides by 12.\n\nP = 48 * 12\n\nP = 576\n\nSo, the total population of the town is 576 people.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nTotal population: 576\n\nBlue eyes: (1/3)*576 = 192\n\nGreen eyes: (1/4)*576 = 144\n\nBrown eyes: 576 - (192 + 144) = 576 - 336 = 240\n\nNow, is 240 equal to 192 + 48? Yes, 192 + 48 = 240.\n\nPerfect, that checks out.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{576} \\]"
