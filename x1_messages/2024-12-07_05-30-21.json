        "content": "So I have this probability question here: \"If you toss a fair coin 5 times, what is the probability of getting exactly 3 heads?\" Hmm, probability can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We're tossing a fair coin, which means each toss has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T), and each outcome is equally likely, so the probability of heads or tails on any single toss is 1/2.\n\nWe're tossing the coin 5 times, and we want exactly 3 heads. So, the number of heads we get can range from 0 to 5, but we're interested in the case where it's exactly 3.\n\nI think this is a binomial probability problem because we have a fixed number of independent trials (tosses), each with two possible outcomes, and we're interested in the number of times one particular outcome occurs (heads).\n\nThe formula for the binomial probability is:\n\nP(k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the number of trials (tosses), which is 5.\n\n- k is the number of successes (heads), which is 3.\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial, which is 1/2 for a fair coin.\n\n- \"n choose k\" is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose k successes out of n trials.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nP(3) = (5 choose 3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^(5-3)\n\nFirst, let's calculate (5 choose 3). The formula for the binomial coefficient is:\n\n(n choose k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nSo,\n\n(5 choose 3) = 5! / (3! * (5 - 3)!) = (120) / (6 * 2) = 120 / 12 = 10\n\nNext, (1/2)^3 = 1/8\n\nAnd (1/2)^(5-3) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n\nNow, multiply them all together:\n\nP(3) = 10 * (1/8) * (1/4) = 10 * (1/32) = 10/32 = 5/16\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 tosses of a fair coin is 5/16.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list all possible outcomes of 5 coin tosses and count how many of them have exactly 3 heads.\n\nEach toss has 2 outcomes, so total number of possible outcomes is 2^5 = 32.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of sequences with exactly 3 heads. This is the same as choosing 3 positions out of 5 to place the heads, and the remaining positions will be tails.\n\nSo, the number of such sequences is (5 choose 3) = 10, as calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 10 / 32 = 5/16.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the binomial probability formula again, but I'll get the same result.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using combinations or permutations.\n\nWait, combinations are already what I used in the binomial coefficient.\n\nI think 5/16 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any chance of miscounting.\n\nTotal possible outcomes: 32\n\nFavorable outcomes: 10 (from 5 choose 3)\n\nProbability: 10/32 = 5/16\n\nYes, that seems solid.\n\nSo, the final answer is 5/16.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{16}} \\]"
