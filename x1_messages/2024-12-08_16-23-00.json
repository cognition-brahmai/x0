        "content": "So the restaurant serves 80 meals every hour, and it's open for 10 hours each day. I need to find out how many meals they serve in a day.\n\nFirst, I should probably multiply the number of meals per hour by the number of hours they're open. So that's 80 meals/hour times 10 hours.\n\nLet me write that down: 80 meals/hour \u00d7 10 hours.\n\nNow, multiplying 80 by 10 should be straightforward. 80 times 10 is 800.\n\nSo, the restaurant serves 800 meals each day.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider? Like, maybe they serve more meals during peak hours or something. But according to the information given, they serve a consistent 80 meals per hour for 10 hours.\n\nI think that's it. So, the daily meal count is 800.\n\nJust to be sure, let me check my calculation again. 80 multiplied by 10 is indeed 800.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{800} \\]"
