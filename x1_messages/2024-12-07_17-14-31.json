The expression is (6 * 4) - (12 / 3) + 9 * 2.\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\n(6 * 4) = 24\n\n(12 / 3) = 4\n\nNow the expression is: 24 - 4 + 9 * 2\n\nNext, multiplication and division from left to right:\n\n9 * 2 = 18\n\nSo now it's: 24 - 4 + 18\n\nNow, addition and subtraction from left to right:\n\n24 - 4 = 20\n\n20 + 18 = 38\n\nTherefore, the answer is 38."
