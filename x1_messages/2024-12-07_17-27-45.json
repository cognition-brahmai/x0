        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a town where:\n\n- 1/3 of the people have blue eyes,\n\n- 1/4 have green eyes, and\n\n- the rest have brown eyes.\n\nAdditionally, there are 60 more people with brown eyes than those with blue eyes. We need to find out how many people live in the town altogether.\n\nFirst, let's denote the total number of people in the town as \\( T \\).\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\n- Number of people with blue eyes = \\( \\frac{1}{3}T \\)\n\n- Number of people with green eyes = \\( \\frac{1}{4}T \\)\n\n- Number of people with brown eyes = the rest.\n\nTo find the rest, we can subtract the sum of blue and green-eyed people from the total:\n\nNumber of brown-eyed people = \\( T - \\left( \\frac{1}{3}T + \\frac{1}{4}T \\right) \\)\n\nLet's calculate \\( \\frac{1}{3}T + \\frac{1}{4}T \\):\n\nFirst, find a common denominator for 3 and 4, which is 12.\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{3}T = \\frac{4}{12}T \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{4}T = \\frac{3}{12}T \\)\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{4}{12}T + \\frac{3}{12}T = \\frac{7}{12}T \\)\n\nTherefore, the number of brown-eyed people is:\n\n\\( T - \\frac{7}{12}T = \\frac{12}{12}T - \\frac{7}{12}T = \\frac{5}{12}T \\)\n\nNow, the problem states that there are 60 more people with brown eyes than those with blue eyes.\n\nSo, number of brown-eyed people = number of blue-eyed people + 60\n\nIn terms of \\( T \\):\n\n\\( \\frac{5}{12}T = \\frac{1}{3}T + 60 \\)\n\nAlright, now we have an equation:\n\n\\( \\frac{5}{12}T = \\frac{1}{3}T + 60 \\)\n\nLet's solve for \\( T \\).\n\nFirst, let's get all terms involving \\( T \\) on one side.\n\nSubtract \\( \\frac{1}{3}T \\) from both sides:\n\n\\( \\frac{5}{12}T - \\frac{1}{3}T = 60 \\)\n\nAgain, find a common denominator for 12 and 3, which is 12.\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{3}T = \\frac{4}{12}T \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( \\frac{5}{12}T - \\frac{4}{12}T = 60 \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{12}T = 60 \\)\n\nNow, to find \\( T \\), multiply both sides by 12:\n\n\\( T = 60 \\times 12 \\)\n\n\\( T = 720 \\)\n\nSo, the total number of people in the town is 720.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it makes sense.\n\nIf \\( T = 720 \\):\n\n- Blue-eyed people: \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 720 = 240 \\)\n\n- Green-eyed people: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 720 = 180 \\)\n\n- Brown-eyed people: \\( \\frac{5}{12} \\times 720 = 300 \\)\n\nNow, check if there are 60 more brown-eyed people than blue-eyed people:\n\n300 - 240 = 60\n\nYes, that matches the given information.\n\nSo, the town has 720 people in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{720} \\]"
