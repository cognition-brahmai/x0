        "content": "So the theater group has a goal to raise at least $4,000 from ticket sales for their play. The venue can seat 300 people, and they're selling tickets at $15 for adults and $10 for students. I need to figure out the minimum number of adult and student tickets they must sell to reach this goal.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( a \\) represent the number of adult tickets sold.\n\n- Let \\( s \\) represent the number of student tickets sold.\n\nNow, the total revenue from ticket sales would be the sum of the revenue from adult tickets and student tickets. So, the total revenue \\( r \\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ r = 15a + 10s \\]\n\nThe group wants this revenue to be at least $4,000, so:\n\n\\[ 15a + 10s \\geq 4000 \\]\n\nAlso, the venue can seat 300 people, so the total number of tickets sold can't exceed 300:\n\n\\[ a + s \\leq 300 \\]\n\nI need to find the minimum number of adult and student tickets that satisfy both of these inequalities.\n\nTo simplify things, I can try to express one variable in terms of the other. For example, I can solve the seating constraint for \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ s = 300 - a \\]\n\nNow, I can substitute this expression for \\( s \\) into the revenue inequality:\n\n\\[ 15a + 10(300 - a) \\geq 4000 \\]\n\nLet's simplify this:\n\n\\[ 15a + 3000 - 10a \\geq 4000 \\]\n\n\\[ 5a + 3000 \\geq 4000 \\]\n\n\\[ 5a \\geq 1000 \\]\n\n\\[ a \\geq 200 \\]\n\nSo, the group needs to sell at least 200 adult tickets. Now, let's find out how many student tickets correspond to this.\n\nUsing the seating constraint:\n\n\\[ s = 300 - a \\]\n\nIf \\( a = 200 \\):\n\n\\[ s = 300 - 200 = 100 \\]\n\nSo, selling 200 adult tickets and 100 student tickets would give:\n\n\\[ r = 15(200) + 10(100) = 3000 + 1000 = 4000 \\]\n\nWhich meets the goal exactly. But is there a way to sell fewer tickets and still reach $4,000? Let's check.\n\nSuppose they sell only adult tickets. What's the minimum number needed?\n\nLet \\( s = 0 \\), then:\n\n\\[ 15a \\geq 4000 \\]\n\n\\[ a \\geq \\frac{4000}{15} \\approx 266.67 \\]\n\nSince they can't sell a fraction of a ticket, they'd need to sell at least 267 adult tickets.\n\nBut wait, the venue can only seat 300 people. So selling only adult tickets up to 300 would give:\n\n\\[ r = 15(300) = 4500 \\]\n\nWhich is above the goal, but they might want to maximize revenue, but the question is specifically about reaching at least $4,000.\n\nAlternatively, if they sell only student tickets:\n\n\\[ 10s \\geq 4000 \\]\n\n\\[ s \\geq 400 \\]\n\nBut the venue only seats 300, so it's impossible to sell 400 student tickets. Therefore, they must sell a combination of adult and student tickets.\n\nFrom earlier, selling 200 adult tickets and 100 student tickets meets the goal exactly with 300 tickets sold, which is the maximum seating capacity.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to sell fewer than 300 tickets and still reach $4,000 by selling more adult tickets, which are more expensive.\n\nLet's see. Suppose they sell \\( a \\) adult tickets and \\( s \\) student tickets, with \\( a + s \\leq 300 \\), and \\( 15a + 10s \\geq 4000 \\).\n\nI can rearrange the revenue inequality:\n\n\\[ 15a + 10s \\geq 4000 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n\\[ 3a + 2s \\geq 800 \\]\n\nNow, I can express \\( s \\) in terms of \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ s \\geq \\frac{800 - 3a}{2} \\]\n\nAlso, since \\( a + s \\leq 300 \\), \\( s \\leq 300 - a \\)\n\nSo, combining these:\n\n\\[ \\frac{800 - 3a}{2} \\leq s \\leq 300 - a \\]\n\nFor \\( s \\) to be non-negative, \\( s \\geq 0 \\), so:\n\n\\[ \\frac{800 - 3a}{2} \\leq 300 - a \\]\n\nLet's solve this inequality:\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[ 800 - 3a \\leq 600 - 2a \\]\n\nBring like terms together:\n\n\\[ 800 - 600 \\leq -2a + 3a \\]\n\n\\[ 200 \\leq a \\]\n\nSo, \\( a \\geq 200 \\), which matches what I found earlier.\n\nNow, to minimize the total number of tickets sold, I need to maximize the number of adult tickets sold because they contribute more revenue per ticket.\n\nGiven \\( a \\geq 200 \\), and \\( a + s \\leq 300 \\), the minimum number of tickets sold would be when \\( a = 200 \\) and \\( s = 100 \\), totaling 300 tickets.\n\nBut let's check if selling more than 200 adult tickets allows selling fewer student tickets, thus reducing the total number of tickets sold.\n\nSuppose \\( a = 220 \\), then:\n\n\\[ s \\geq \\frac{800 - 3(220)}{2} = \\frac{800 - 660}{2} = \\frac{140}{2} = 70 \\]\n\nAnd \\( s \\leq 300 - 220 = 80 \\)\n\nSo, \\( s = 70 \\) to 80.\n\nTotal tickets sold: \\( a + s = 220 + 70 = 290 \\) to \\( 220 + 80 = 300 \\)\n\nRevenue:\n\n\\[ r = 15(220) + 10(70) = 3300 + 700 = 4000 \\]\n\nOr \\( r = 15(220) + 10(80) = 3300 + 800 = 4100 \\)\n\nSo, by selling 220 adult tickets and 70 student tickets, they can reach exactly $4,000 and sell only 290 tickets, which is fewer than 300.\n\nSimilarly, let's try \\( a = 240 \\):\n\n\\[ s \\geq \\frac{800 - 3(240)}{2} = \\frac{800 - 720}{2} = \\frac{80}{2} = 40 \\]\n\nAnd \\( s \\leq 300 - 240 = 60 \\)\n\nSo, \\( s = 40 \\) to 60.\n\nTotal tickets sold: \\( a + s = 240 + 40 = 280 \\) to \\( 240 + 60 = 300 \\)\n\nRevenue:\n\n\\[ r = 15(240) + 10(40) = 3600 + 400 = 4000 \\]\n\nOr \\( r = 15(240) + 10(60) = 3600 + 600 = 4200 \\)\n\nAgain, they can sell fewer tickets (280) and still reach $4,000.\n\nLet's try \\( a = 250 \\):\n\n\\[ s \\geq \\frac{800 - 3(250)}{2} = \\frac{800 - 750}{2} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\]\n\nAnd \\( s \\leq 300 - 250 = 50 \\)\n\nSo, \\( s = 25 \\) to 50.\n\nTotal tickets sold: \\( a + s = 250 + 25 = 275 \\) to \\( 250 + 50 = 300 \\)\n\nRevenue:\n\n\\[ r = 15(250) + 10(25) = 3750 + 250 = 4000 \\]\n\nOr \\( r = 15(250) + 10(50) = 3750 + 500 = 4250 \\]\n\nContinuing this pattern, let's try \\( a = 260 \\):\n\n\\[ s \\geq \\frac{800 - 3(260)}{2} = \\frac{800 - 780}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\]\n\nAnd \\( s \\leq 300 - 260 = 40 \\)\n\nSo, \\( s = 10 \\) to 40.\n\nTotal tickets sold: \\( a + s = 260 + 10 = 270 \\) to \\( 260 + 40 = 300 \\)\n\nRevenue:\n\n\\[ r = 15(260) + 10(10) = 3900 + 100 = 4000 \\]\n\nOr \\( r = 15(260) + 10(40) = 3900 + 400 = 4300 \\]\n\nNow, if \\( a = 266 \\) (since earlier we saw that selling only adult tickets, they'd need at least 267):\n\n\\[ s \\geq \\frac{800 - 3(266)}{2} = \\frac{800 - 798}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\]\n\nAnd \\( s \\leq 300 - 266 = 34 \\)\n\nSo, \\( s = 1 \\) to 34.\n\nTotal tickets sold: \\( a + s = 266 + 1 = 267 \\) to \\( 266 + 34 = 299 \\)\n\nRevenue:\n\n\\[ r = 15(266) + 10(1) = 3990 + 10 = 4000 \\]\n\nOr \\( r = 15(266) + 10(34) = 3990 + 340 = 4330 \\]\n\nSo, the minimum number of tickets they need to sell is 267 (all adult tickets minus one, plus one student ticket), but practically, to minimize the total number of tickets, they should maximize the number of adult tickets sold.\n\nHowever, considering that the venue can only seat 300 people, and they might not be able to sell more than a certain number of adult tickets, depending on demand.\n\nBut mathematically, to minimize the total number of tickets sold while meeting the revenue goal, they should sell as many adult tickets as possible.\n\nSo, the absolute minimum number of tickets sold would be when they sell the fewest possible tickets, which is when they sell the maximum number of adult tickets needed to reach $4,000.\n\nFrom earlier, selling 267 adult tickets would give:\n\n\\[ r = 15 \\times 267 = 4005 \\]\n\nWhich is just over $4,000. But since they can sell up to 300 tickets, they could choose to sell more student tickets and fewer adult tickets, but that would increase the total number of tickets sold.\n\nWait, but earlier when \\( a = 266 \\), \\( r = 15 \\times 266 = 3990 \\), which is less than $4,000, so they need at least 267 adult tickets to reach $4,000 if they sell no student tickets.\n\nBut if they sell one student ticket, they can reduce the number of adult tickets slightly.\n\nWait, let's recast this.\n\nIf they sell one student ticket, which is $10, then the remaining revenue needed from adult tickets is \\( 4000 - 10 = 3990 \\), which requires \\( a = \\lceil 3990 / 15 \\rceil = 266 \\) adult tickets.\n\nSo, total tickets sold: 266 adult + 1 student = 267 tickets.\n\nSimilarly, if they sell two student tickets ($20), then they need \\( 4000 - 20 = 3980 \\) from adult tickets, which is \\( a = 265.333 \\), so 266 adult tickets. Total tickets: 266 + 2 = 268.\n\nWait, but 15*266 = 3990, plus 20 from two student tickets is 4010, which is over $4,000.\n\nWait, there seems to be a miscalculation here.\n\nLet me re-examine this approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that each student ticket sold allows them to sell one less adult ticket while still meeting the revenue goal.\n\nSo, for each student ticket sold, they can reduce the number of adult tickets by \\( \\frac{10}{15} = \\frac{2}{3} \\) of an adult ticket, in terms of revenue equivalence.\n\nBut this gets complicated. Maybe it's better to consider the revenue per ticket.\n\nThe revenue per adult ticket is $15, and per student ticket is $10.\n\nThe average revenue per ticket needs to be at least \\( \\frac{4000}{a + s} \\).\n\nBut this seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of the contribution of each type of ticket to the revenue goal.\n\nLet me consider the revenue equation again:\n\n\\[ 15a + 10s = 4000 \\]\n\nI can divide the entire equation by 5 to simplify:\n\n\\[ 3a + 2s = 800 \\]\n\nNow, I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ 2s = 800 - 3a \\]\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{800 - 3a}{2} \\]\n\nNow, since \\( s \\) must be a whole number (you can't sell half a ticket), \\( 800 - 3a \\) must be even, which it will be as long as \\( a \\) is even.\n\nBut more importantly, \\( s \\) must be non-negative, so:\n\n\\[ \\frac{800 - 3a}{2} \\geq 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 800 - 3a \\geq 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 3a \\leq 800 \\]\n\n\\[ a \\leq \\frac{800}{3} \\approx 266.666 \\]\n\nSince \\( a \\) must be a whole number, \\( a \\leq 266 \\)\n\nBut earlier, considering the seating constraint \\( a + s \\leq 300 \\), and the revenue requirement, we need to find the minimum total tickets sold, which would involve maximizing the number of adult tickets sold.\n\nWait, there's a conflict here because if \\( a \\leq 266 \\), but earlier I thought they need at least 267 adult tickets.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconcile these thoughts.\n\nLet me try to find the minimum total tickets sold by expressing \\( s \\) in terms of \\( a \\):\n\nFrom the revenue equation:\n\n\\[ 3a + 2s = 800 \\]\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{800 - 3a}{2} \\]\n\nNow, the total tickets sold is:\n\n\\[ t = a + s = a + \\frac{800 - 3a}{2} = \\frac{2a + 800 - 3a}{2} = \\frac{800 - a}{2} \\]\n\nTo minimize \\( t \\), we need to minimize \\( \\frac{800 - a}{2} \\), which means maximizing \\( a \\).\n\nFrom earlier, \\( a \\leq 266 \\), so the maximum \\( a \\) can be is 266.\n\nLet's plug that in:\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{800 - 3(266)}{2} = \\frac{800 - 798}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\]\n\n\\[ t = 266 + 1 = 267 \\]\n\nNow, check the revenue:\n\n\\[ r = 15(266) + 10(1) = 3990 + 10 = 4000 \\]\n\nPerfect, it meets the goal exactly with 267 tickets sold.\n\nIs there a way to sell even fewer tickets? Let's see.\n\nIf \\( a = 267 \\):\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{800 - 3(267)}{2} = \\frac{800 - 801}{2} = \\frac{-1}{2} \\]\n\nWhich is not possible, since \\( s \\) can't be negative.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of tickets they need to sell is 267: 266 adult tickets and 1 student ticket.\n\nThis way, they meet the revenue goal exactly while selling the fewest possible tickets.\n\nHowever, they have a seating capacity of 300, so they could choose to sell more tickets to potentially increase revenue, but the question is specifically about meeting the minimum goal.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Minimum total tickets to sell: 267\n\n- Comprising: 266 adult tickets and 1 student ticket\n\nThis is the most optimal combination to reach exactly $4,000 while minimizing the number of tickets sold."
