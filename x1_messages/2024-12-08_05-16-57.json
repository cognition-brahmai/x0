Does that mean Tom is older than John? Hmm.\n\nWait a minute, if Mary is younger than both John and Tom, but we don't know how John and Tom's ages compare to each other directly. For example, John could be older than Tom, or Tom could be older than John, or they could be the same age. But hold on, John is older than Mary, and Tom is older than Mary, but we don't know who is older between John and Tom.\n\nMaybe I should think of it in terms of inequalities. Let's let J represent John's age, M represent Mary's age, and T represent Tom's age.\n\nSo, from the information given:\n\n1. John is older than Mary: J > M\n\n2. Mary is younger than Tom: M < T\n\nSo, J > M and M < T. But what is the relationship between J and T?\n\nWell, from J > M and M < T, we can't directly conclude whether J is greater than, less than, or equal to T.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Suppose John is 30, Mary is 25, and Tom is 30. Then John is older than Mary (30 > 25), Mary is younger than Tom (25 < 30), and John is the same age as Tom (30 = 30).\n\n- Alternatively, John could be 30, Mary 25, and Tom 26. So John is older than Mary (30 > 25), Mary is younger than Tom (25 < 26), but John is older than Tom (30 > 26).\n\n- Or, John could be 30, Mary 25, and Tom 35. Then John is older than Mary (30 > 25), Mary is younger than Tom (25 < 35), but Tom is older than John (35 > 30).\n\nSo, in different scenarios, Tom could be the same age as John, younger than John, or older than John.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot determine whether Tom is older than John.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Cannot be determined from the given information}} \\]"
