        "content": "So, the library has 12 shelves, and each shelf holds 30 books. I need to find out how many books are in the library in total. Hmm, this seems like a multiplication problem because I'm dealing with groups of items.\n\nLet me think about it step by step. If there are 12 shelves, and each one has 30 books, then the total number of books should be 12 times 30. That makes sense because multiplication is basically repeated addition. So, it's like adding 30 books, 12 times.\n\nLet me calculate that. 12 multiplied by 30. Well, 12 times 3 is 36, and since there's a zero in 30, I need to add a zero to the end of 36. So, 12 times 30 is 360.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this to confirm? Maybe I can break it down further. Let's see, 12 shelves can be thought of as 10 shelves plus 2 shelves. So, 10 shelves times 30 books each would be 300 books, and 2 shelves times 30 books each would be 60 books. Then, adding those together, 300 plus 60 equals 360 books.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. Good, that makes sense. Another way to think about it is to consider that each shelf holds 30 books, so for 12 shelves, it's 12 times 30.\n\nLet me just double-check. If I have 1 shelf with 30 books, 2 shelves have 60 books, and so on, up to 12 shelves. So, 12 times 30 is indeed 360.\n\nI think that's the correct total number of books in the library. Unless there's some other factor I'm not considering, like books that are not on the shelves or something, but the question seems straightforward.\n\nSo, the library has 360 books in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
