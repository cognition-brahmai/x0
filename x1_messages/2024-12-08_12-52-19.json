        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangle. It says that the original length is 15 cm and the width is 8 cm. Then, it tells me to increase the length by 50% and decrease the width by 25%, and I need to find out what the new area will be after these changes.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, the original area would be 15 cm times 8 cm, which is 120 square centimeters. But, the dimensions are changing, so I need to find the new length and new width before I can calculate the new area.\n\nLet's handle the length first. The length is being increased by 50%. So, I need to find what 50% of 15 cm is and then add that to the original length.\n\n50% of 15 cm is calculated as (50/100) * 15 = 7.5 cm.\n\nSo, the new length will be the original length plus this increase: 15 cm + 7.5 cm = 22.5 cm.\n\nNow, for the width, it's being decreased by 25%. So, I need to find 25% of 8 cm and subtract that from the original width.\n\n25% of 8 cm is (25/100) * 8 = 2 cm.\n\nTherefore, the new width will be the original width minus this decrease: 8 cm - 2 cm = 6 cm.\n\nNow that I have the new length and width, I can find the new area by multiplying them together.\n\nNew area = new length * new width = 22.5 cm * 6 cm = 135 square centimeters.\n\nWait a minute, that seems higher than the original area of 120 square centimeters. Is that possible? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, increasing the length by 50%:\n\n50% of 15 cm is indeed 7.5 cm, and 15 cm + 7.5 cm = 22.5 cm. That seems correct.\n\nNext, decreasing the width by 25%:\n\n25% of 8 cm is indeed 2 cm, and 8 cm - 2 cm = 6 cm. That also seems correct.\n\nNow, multiplying the new dimensions:\n\n22.5 cm * 6 cm = 135 square centimeters. Hmm, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, even though the width is decreasing, the larger increase in length is causing the area to increase overall.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem, maybe without calculating the individual changes?\n\nYes, actually, I can think in terms of percentages.\n\nThe length is increased by 50%, which is the same as multiplying the length by 1.5.\n\nThe width is decreased by 25%, which is the same as multiplying the width by 0.75.\n\nSo, the new area would be original length times 1.5 multiplied by original width times 0.75.\n\nThat is, new area = (15 * 1.5) * (8 * 0.75) = 22.5 cm * 6 cm = 135 square centimeters.\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the overall percentage change in area.\n\nThe original area is 15 cm * 8 cm = 120 square centimeters.\n\nThe new area is 135 square centimeters.\n\nSo, the change in area is 135 - 120 = 15 square centimeters.\n\nThat's an increase of 15 square centimeters, or (15/120) * 100% = 12.5%.\n\nIs there a way to calculate the percentage change in area directly from the percentage changes in length and width?\n\nYes, actually.\n\nWhen you multiply two quantities that have been changed by certain percentages, the overall percentage change in their product is approximately the sum of the percentage changes plus the product of the percentage changes divided by 100.\n\nBut, for small percentage changes, it's roughly just the sum of the percentage changes.\n\nIn this case, the length is increased by 50% and the width is decreased by 25%.\n\nSo, the overall percentage change in area is approximately 50% - 25% = 25%.\n\nBut, that's not exactly accurate because it doesn't account for the interaction between the two changes.\n\nThe precise way is to calculate the overall scale factor.\n\nThe scale factor for length is 1.5 (since it's increased by 50%).\n\nThe scale factor for width is 0.75 (since it's decreased by 25%).\n\nSo, the overall scale factor for the area is 1.5 * 0.75 = 1.125.\n\nThat means the new area is 1.125 times the original area.\n\nSo, 1.125 * 120 square centimeters = 135 square centimeters.\n\nWhich matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can try another approach.\n\nSuppose I consider the new length and width in terms of the original dimensions.\n\nNew length = original length + 50% of original length = 15 cm + 0.5 * 15 cm = 22.5 cm.\n\nNew width = original width - 25% of original width = 8 cm - 0.25 * 8 cm = 6 cm.\n\nThen, new area = 22.5 cm * 6 cm = 135 square centimeters.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough.\n\nSo, the new area of the rectangle after increasing the length by 50% and decreasing the width by 25% is 135 square centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{135} \\]"
