Father and son were at chess, the former, who possessed ideas about the game involving radical changes, putting his king into such sharp and unnecessary perils that it even provoked comment from the white-haired old lady knitting placidly by the fire.\n\"Hark at the wind,\" said Mr. White, who, having seen a fatal mistake after it was too late, was amiably desirous of preventing his son from seeing it.\n\"I'm listening,\" said the latter, grimly surveying the board as he stretched out his hand. \"Check.\"\n\"I should hardly think that he'd come to-night,\" said his father, with his hand poised over the board.\n\"Mate,\" replied the son.\n\"That's the worst of living so far out,\" bawled Mr. White, with sudden and unlooked-for violence; \"of all the beastly, slushy, out-of-the-way places to live in, this is the worst. Pathway's a bog, and the road's a torrent. I don't know what people are thinking about. I suppose because only two houses in the road are let, they think it doesn't matter.\"\n\"Never mind, dear,\" said his wife, soothingly; \"perhaps you'll win the next one.\"\nMr. White looked up sharply, just in time to intercept a knowing glance between mother and son. The words died away on his lips, and he hid a guilty grin in his thin grey beard.\n\"There he is,\" said Herbert White, as the gate banged to loudly and heavy footsteps came toward the door.\nThe old man rose with hospitable haste, and opening the door, was heard condoling with the new arrival. The new arrival also condoled with himself, so that Mrs. White said, \"Tut, tut!\" and coughed gently as her husband entered the room, followed by a tall, burly man, beady of eye and rubicund of visage.\n\"Sergeant-Major Morris,\" he said, introducing him.\nThe sergeant-major shook hands, and taking the proffered seat by the fire, watched contentedly while his host got out whiskey and tumblers and stood a small copper kettle on the fire.\nAt the third glass his eyes got brighter, and he began to talk, the little family circle regarding with eager interest this visitor from distant parts, as he squared his broad shoulders in the chair and spoke of wild scenes and doughty deeds; of wars and plagues and strange peoples.\n\"Twenty-one years of it,\" said Mr. White, nodding at his wife and son. \"When he went away he was a slip of a youth in the warehouse. Now look at him.\"\n\"He don't look to have taken much harm,\" said Mrs. White, politely.\n\"I'd like to go to India myself,\" said the old man, \"just to look round a bit, you know.\"\n\"Better where you are,\" said the sergeant-major, shaking his head. He put down the empty glass, and sighing softly, shook it again.\n\"I should like to see those old temples and fakirs and jugglers,\" said the old man. \"What was that you started telling me the other day about a monkey's paw or something, Morris?\"\n\"Nothing,\" said the soldier, hastily. \"Leastways nothing worth hearing.\"\n\"Monkey's paw?\" said Mrs. White, curiously.\n\"Well, it's just a bit of what you might call magic, perhaps,\" said the sergeant-major, offhandedly.\nHis three listeners leaned forward eagerly. The visitor absent-mindedly put his empty glass to his lips and then set it down again. His host filled it for him.\n\"To look at,\" said the sergeant-major, fumbling in his pocket, \"it's just an ordinary little paw, dried to a mummy.\"\nHe took something out of his pocket and proffered it. Mrs. White drew back with a grimace, but her son, taking it, examined it curiously.\n\"And what is there special about it?\" inquired Mr. White as he took it from his son, and having examined it, placed it upon the table.\n\"It had a spell put on it by an old fakir,\" said the sergeant-major, \"a very holy man. He wanted to show that fate ruled people's lives, and that those who interfered with it did so to their sorrow. He put a spell on it so that three separate men could each have three wishes from it.\"\nHis manner was so impressive that his hearers were conscious that their light laughter jarred somewhat.\n\"Well, why don't you have three, sir?\" said Herbert White, cleverly.\nThe soldier regarded him in the way that middle age is wont to regard presumptuous youth. \"I have,\" he said, quietly, and his blotchy face whitened.\n\"And did you really have the three wishes granted?\" asked Mrs. White.\n\"I did,\" said the sergeant-major, and his glass tapped against his strong teeth.\n\"And has anybody else wished?\" persisted the old lady.\n\"The first man had his three wishes. Yes,\" was the reply; \"I don't know what the first two were, but the third was for death. That's how I got the paw.\"\nHis tones were so grave that a hush fell upon the group.\n\"If you've had your three wishes, it's no good to you now, then, Morris,\" said the old man at last. \"What do you keep it for?\"\nThe soldier shook his head. \"Fancy, I suppose,\" he said, slowly. \"I did have some idea of selling it, but I don't think I will. It has caused enough mischief already. Besides, people won't buy. They think it's a fairy tale; some of them, and those who do think anything of it want to try it first and pay me afterward.\"\n\"If you could have another three wishes,\" said the old man, eyeing him keenly, \"would you have them?\"\n\"I don't know,\" said the other. \"I don't know.\"\nHe took the paw, and dangling it between his forefinger and thumb, suddenly threw it upon the fire. White, with a slight cry, stooped down and snatched it off.\n\"Better let it burn,\" said the soldier, solemnly.\n\"If you don't want it, Morris,\" said the other, \"give it to me.\"\n\"I won't,\" said his friend, doggedly. \"I threw it on the fire. If you keep it, don't blame me for what happens. Pitch it on the fire again like a sensible man.\"\nThe other shook his head and examined his new possession closely. \"How do you do it?\" he inquired.\n\"Hold it up in your right hand and wish aloud,\" said the sergeant-major, \"but I warn you of the consequences.\"\n\"Sounds like the Arabian Nights,\" said Mrs. White, as she rose and began to set the supper. \"Don't you think you might wish for four pairs of hands for me?\"\nHer husband drew the talisman from pocket, and then all three burst into laughter as the sergeant-major, with a look of alarm on his face, caught him by the arm.\n\"If you must wish,\" he said, gruffly, \"wish for something sensible.\"\nMr. White dropped it back in his pocket, and placing chairs, motioned his friend to the table. In the business of supper the talisman was partly forgotten, and afterward the three sat listening in an enthralled fashion to a second instalment of the soldier's adventures in India.\n\"If the tale about the monkey's paw is not more truthful than those he has been telling us,\" said Herbert, as the door closed behind their guest, just in time for him to catch the last train, \"we sha'nt make much out of it.\"\n\"Did you give him anything for it, father?\" inquired Mrs. White, regarding her husband closely.\n\"A trifle,\" said he, colouring slightly. \"He didn't want it, but I made him take it. And he pressed me again to throw it away.\"\n\"Likely,\" said Herbert, with pretended horror. \"Why, we're going to be rich, and famous and happy. Wish to be an emperor, father, to begin with; then you can't be henpecked.\"\nHe darted round the table, pursued by the maligned Mrs. White armed with an antimacassar.\nMr. White took the paw from his pocket and eyed it dubiously. \"I don't know what to wish for, and that's a fact,\" he said, slowly. \"It seems to me I've got all I want.\"\n\"If you only cleared the house, you'd be quite happy, wouldn't you?\" said Herbert, with his hand on his shoulder. \"Well, wish for two hundred pounds, then; that 'll just do it.\"\nHis father, smiling shamefacedly at his own credulity, held up the talisman, as his son, with a solemn face, somewhat marred by a wink at his mother, sat down at the piano and struck a few impressive chords.\n\"I wish for two hundred pounds,\" said the old man distinctly.\nA fine crash from the piano greeted the words, interrupted by a shuddering cry from the old man. His wife and son ran toward him.\n\"It moved,\" he cried, with a glance of disgust at the object as it lay on the floor.\n\"As I wished, it twisted in my hand like a snake.\"\n\"Well, I don't see the money,\" said his son as he picked it up and placed it on the table, \"and I bet I never shall.\"\n\"It must have been your fancy, father,\" said his wife, regarding him anxiously.\nHe shook his head. \"Never mind, though; there's no harm done, but it gave me a shock all the same.\"\nThey sat down by the fire again while the two men finished their pipes. Outside, the wind was higher than ever, and the old man started nervously at the sound of a door banging upstairs. A silence unusual and depressing settled upon all three, which lasted until the old couple rose to retire for the night.\n\"I expect you'll find the cash tied up in a big bag in the middle of your bed,\" said Herbert, as he bade them good-night, \"and something horrible squatting up on top of the wardrobe watching you as you pocket your ill-gotten gains.\"\nHe sat alone in the darkness, gazing at the dying fire, and seeing faces in it. The last face was so horrible and so simian that he gazed at it in amazement. It got so vivid that, with a little uneasy laugh, he felt on the table for a glass containing a little water to throw over it. His hand grasped the monkey's paw, and with a little shiver he wiped his hand on his coat and went up to bed.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 600 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"

        "content": "I've read the passage, and I need to summarize it in around 600 words. Let me try to recall the main points.\n\nSo, the story is set in a small parlour of Laburnam Villa on a cold and wet night. There are three main characters: Mr. and Mrs. White and their son Herbert. They are a close-knit family, and the atmosphere seems cozy despite the weather outside.\n\nMr. White and Herbert are playing chess when Sergeant-Major Morris arrives. He's an old family friend who has been to India and shares fascinating stories about his adventures there. Mr. White seems particularly interested in hearing about India and expresses a desire to visit himself.\n\nDuring the conversation, Sergeant-Major Morris mentions a monkey's paw, which he describes as a charm that can grant three wishes to three different people. He explains that it was blessed by an old fakir who wanted to demonstrate the folly of interfering with fate. The first person who had the paw used all three wishes, and the third wish was for death, which suggests that the wishes came with dangerous consequences.\n\nSergeant-Major Morris has had his three wishes and seems wary of the paw's power. He tries to discourage Mr. White from keeping it, warning him about the potential dangers. However, Mr. White is intrigued and decides to keep the paw despite the risks.\n\nLater that night, after Sergeant-Major Morris leaves, the family discusses the possibility of using the monkey's paw to make wishes. Herbert jokingly suggests wishing for wealth, and Mr. White, somewhat hesitantly, decides to wish for two hundred pounds to clear his debts and improve their financial situation.\n\nAs Mr. White makes the wish, he experiences a strange sensation, feeling the paw move in his hand like a snake. This unnerves him, and he shares his experience with his family. They try to reassure him but are also a bit uneasy about the whole situation.\n\nThe story ends with Herbert making light of the situation, suggesting that the money might appear in their bed, and Mr. White going to bed with some apprehension about what might happen next.\n\nSo, in summary, the passage introduces the characters, sets the scene, and introduces the supernatural element of the monkey's paw and its ability to grant wishes with potentially disastrous consequences. The family is faced with a temptation to use the paw to improve their lives, but they are also aware of the risks involved.\n\nI need to expand this summary to around 600 words, so I should provide more details about the characters and their interactions, as well as the atmosphere and themes presented in the passage.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the characters. Mr. White is portrayed as a kind and hospitable man who is interested in hearing about Sergeant-Major Morris's travels. He seems a bit gullible or open-minded, depending on how you look at it, as he is willing to believe in the monkey's paw's powers and keep it despite the warnings.\n\nMrs. White comes across as a nurturing and supportive wife and mother. She soothes her husband when he's upset and tries to lighten the mood with her comments. She also shows curiosity about the monkey's paw but seems more practical than her husband.\n\nHerbert, their son, is a bit of a skeptic and enjoys teasing his parents about the whole monkey's paw affair. He makes jokes about wishing for wealth and suggests that the money might appear in their bed, which adds a humorous element to the otherwise tense situation.\n\nSergeant-Major Morris is the one who brings the monkey's paw into their lives. He has a mysterious air about him, having been to India and experienced things most people only dream of. He warns the Whites about the paw's dangers but ultimately leaves it with them, perhaps burdening them with a responsibility he no longer wants.\n\nThe atmosphere in the Villa is initially warm and cozy, with the fire burning brightly and the family engaged in activities together. However, as the story progresses and the monkey's paw is introduced, the atmosphere becomes tense and uneasy. The wind outside adds to the sense of foreboding, and the family's unease is palpable.\n\nThe theme of temptation versus caution is prevalent throughout the passage. The monkey's paw represents a temptation to alter one's fate for personal gain, but the warnings associated with it suggest that such interference comes with severe consequences. The family must decide whether to succumb to the temptation or exercise caution and avoid using the paw.\n\nAdditionally, there is a theme of the supernatural invading the ordinary world. The monkey's paw introduces an element of the unknown and the mystical into the otherwise mundane lives of the Whites, forcing them to confront the possibility that there are forces beyond their understanding at play.\n\nIn conclusion, the passage sets up a intriguing scenario where a family is presented with a supernatural object that can grant wishes but comes with significant risks. The characters must navigate their desires and fears as they decide whether to use the monkey's paw and, if so, what to wish for. The atmosphere is a mix of warmth and unease, reflecting the duality of the situation they find themselves in.\n\n**Final Summary**\n\nThe passage is set in the small parlour of Laburnam Villa on a cold, wet night. Inside, the atmosphere is cozy, with the fire burning brightly and the blinds drawn against the unpleasant weather outside. The main characters are Mr. and Mrs. White and their son, Herbert. They are engaged in various activities: Mr. and Herbert are playing a game of chess, while Mrs. White is knitting placidly by the fire.\n\nSergeant-Major Morris, an old family friend who has traveled extensively in India, arrives at the house. His tales of distant lands and exotic experiences captivate the family. Mr. White expresses a desire to visit India himself, to see the ancient temples, fakirs, and jugglers. Sergeant-Major Morris, however, advises against it, suggesting that it's better to stay where they are.\n\nDuring their conversation, the sergeant-major mentions a monkey's paw, a talisman said to grant three wishes to three different individuals. He warns that the paw is cursed, having caused much mischief already, and that those who interfere with fate do so to their sorrow. Despite his warnings, Mr. White is intrigued and asks to see the paw. The sergeant-major reluctantly shows it to them, and Herbert examines it curiously.\n\nMr. White, after examining the paw, places it on the table, and the sergeant-major seizes the opportunity to throw it into the fire, urging Mr. White not to keep it. However, Mr. White retrieves it, insisting on keeping it, and the sergeant-major, despite his misgivings, acquiesces, giving him a small sum of money for it.\n\nAs they sit down to supper, the topic shifts back to the sergeant-major's adventures, and the monkey's paw is temporarily forgotten. After the meal, the family listens to more of his stories, but the talisman is brought up again, with Herbert joking about wishing for wealth and fame.\n\nMr. White, somewhat hesitantly, decides to test the paw's power by wishing for two hundred pounds, an amount that would help clear their debts and improve their financial situation. As he makes the wish, he experiences a strange and unsettling sensation, feeling the paw move in his hand like a snake. This terrifies him, and he shares his experience with his family, who try to reassure him but are also visibly uneasy.\n\nThe story ends with Herbert making light of the situation, suggesting that the money might miraculously appear in their bed, and Mr. White going to bed with some apprehension about what might happen next.\n\nIn summary, the passage introduces the characters, sets the scene, and presents the supernatural element of the monkey's paw and its ability to grant wishes with potentially disastrous consequences. The family is faced with the temptation to use the paw to improve their lives but is also aware of the risks involved. The atmosphere shifts from warm and inviting to tense and uneasy as the implications of possessing such a powerful and potentially dangerous object become apparent.\n\n**Expanded Analysis**\n\nThe characters in this passage are portrayed with distinct personalities and roles within the family dynamic. Mr. White is depicted as a kind and hospitable man who is eager to hear about Sergeant-Major Morris's travels. His interest in the monkey's paw suggests a certain level of openness to the supernatural or perhaps a desire for a change in his current circumstances. Mrs. White, on the other hand, is presented as a nurturing and supportive figure, trying to maintain harmony within the family and offering comfort to her husband when he is troubled.\n\nHerbert, their son, serves as the voice of youthful skepticism and humor. He makes light of the situation involving the monkey's paw, suggesting that if they were to wish for wealth, it might appear in their bed, accompanied by something horrifying. This not only adds a layer of comedic relief but also hints at the potential darker consequences of making wishes with the paw.\n\nSergeant-Major Morris is a complex character, having experienced the world beyond their small village. His tales are both captivating and cautionary, reflecting his worldly wisdom and the dangers he has encountered. His reluctance to part with the monkey's paw and his warnings about its curse suggest that he has had firsthand experience with its malevolent power.\n\nThe atmosphere in Laburnam Villa shifts significantly throughout the passage. Initially, it is warm and inviting, with the fire providing comfort against the harsh night outside. However, as the monkey's paw is introduced and its significance becomes clear, the mood turns tense and uneasy. The howling wind outside mirrors the internal turmoil and apprehension felt by the characters, creating a sense of impending danger.\n\nThematically, the passage explores the age-old conflict between temptation and caution. The monkey's paw represents a powerful temptation to alter one's fate for personal gain, but the associated warnings underscore the potential for disastrous consequences. This theme is universal, resonating with the classic cautionary tales where characters are cautioned against meddling with forces beyond their understanding.\n\nAdditionally, the passage delves into the idea of the supernatural encroaching upon the ordinary world. The introduction of the monkey's paw disrupts the tranquility of the White family's life, forcing them to confront the possibility that there are mysterious and potentially dangerous forces at play in their otherwise mundane existence.\n\nIn conclusion, this passage masterfully sets the stage for a suspenseful and thought-provoking narrative. It introduces relatable characters faced with a supernatural temptation, explores the shift in atmosphere from comfort to unease, and touches on universal themes of temptation, caution, and the unknown. The ending leaves the reader wondering about the consequences of Mr. White's wish, setting the stage for further developments in the story."
