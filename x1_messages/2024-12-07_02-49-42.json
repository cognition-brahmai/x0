This means that there is no central authority above states to enforce rules or resolve disputes, so states must rely on their own capabilities to ensure their security and survival. Realists believe that power is the most important currency in international politics, and that states are primarily concerned with maximizing their power relative to other states. They also argue that morality and ethics play a limited role in international relations, as states must prioritize their own interests above all else."
