        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 units per day, and the defective rate is 2%. I need to find out how many non-defective units are produced in one week, which is 7 days.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many defective units are produced per day. If the defective rate is 2%, that means 2% of 500 units are defective. So, defective units per day would be 2% of 500.\n\nTo calculate that, I can multiply 500 by 2% or 0.02.\n\nDefective units per day = 500 * 0.02 = 10 units.\n\nSo, each day, 10 units are defective.\n\nNow, to find the number of non-defective units per day, I can subtract the defective units from the total units produced per day.\n\nNon-defective units per day = total units per day - defective units per day = 500 - 10 = 490 units.\n\nThat means, every day, the factory produces 490 non-defective units.\n\nNow, to find out how many non-defective units are produced in one week, I need to multiply the daily non-defective production by 7 days.\n\nNon-defective units per week = 490 units/day * 7 days = 3430 units.\n\nSo, the factory produces 3430 non-defective units in one week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total units per day are 500.\n\nDefective rate is 2%, so defective units per day are 500 * 0.02 = 10 units.\n\nNon-defective units per day are 500 - 10 = 490 units.\n\nOver 7 days, 490 units/day * 7 days = 3430 units.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate it by finding the non-defective rate and then applying it to the total production.\n\nThe non-defective rate would be 100% - 2% = 98%.\n\nSo, non-defective units per day = 500 * 0.98 = 490 units.\n\nThen, non-defective units per week = 490 units/day * 7 days = 3430 units.\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think that's reliable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3430} \\]"
