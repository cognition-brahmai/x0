A shield provides physical protection and can help deflect attacks, while a book does not offer any defensive capabilities in a combat situation. However, it's important to note that in different contexts, a book can be valuable for knowledge and strategy, which can be essential in planning and executing battles. But in the immediate context of being in a battle, a shield would be more useful for personal defense."
