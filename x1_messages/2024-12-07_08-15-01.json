        "content": "Oh, that's an interesting question! So, you're asking about a 1994 film directed by Quentin Tarantino that not only brought him fame but also features a narrative style that jumps around in time. Let me think about this.\n\nQuentin Tarantino is known for his unique storytelling techniques and non-linear plots. One of his early films that gained significant attention is \"Pulp Fiction.\" That came out in 1994, right? Yes, \"Pulp Fiction\" was released in 1994 and it definitely made Tarantino a household name. The film is renowned for its intricate plot that doesn't follow a straightforward chronological order; instead, it jumps around in time, connecting different storylines in a fascinating way.\n\nSo, I believe the film you're referring to is \"Pulp Fiction.\" It's a classic example of a non-linear narrative, which is a type of storytelling where events are presented out of order, often to create suspense or to explore themes in a more profound way.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about this film or Tarantino's work?"
