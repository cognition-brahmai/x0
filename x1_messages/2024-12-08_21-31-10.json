        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 3 red balls, 4 blue balls, and 5 green balls. So, in total, there are 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 balls in the bag. The question is, if I pick one ball at random, what's the probability that it's not green?\n\nOkay, probability. I remember that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls, which is 12.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the outcomes where I pick a ball that is not green. So, that means I can pick either a red ball or a blue ball.\n\nThere are 3 red balls and 4 blue balls, so the total number of non-green balls is 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a non-green ball is 7/12.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe by calculating the probability of picking a green ball and then subtracting it from 1?\n\nYes, that's another approach. The probability of picking a green ball is the number of green balls over the total number of balls, which is 5/12.\n\nSo, the probability of not picking a green ball would be 1 - 5/12 = 7/12.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign. It looks like 7/12 is the correct probability.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Total balls: 3 red + 4 blue + 5 green = 12 balls.\n\nNumber of non-green balls: 3 red + 4 blue = 7 balls.\n\nProbability: 7/12.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{12}} \\]"
