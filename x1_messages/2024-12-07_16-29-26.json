To design a SQL query that retrieves data from a \"Students\" table and sorts the result by grade in descending order, you can use the SELECT statement along with the ORDER BY clause. Here's how you can structure the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name, Grade, Age\nFROM Students\nORDER BY Grade DESC;\n```\n\nThis query selects all records from the \"Students\" table and orders them based on the \"Grade\" field in descending order. This means that students with higher grades will appear first in the result set.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
