        "content": "During his 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama advocated for comprehensive healthcare reform in the United States. He believed that access to affordable healthcare was a fundamental right for all Americans and sought to expand coverage and reduce costs. His plan included proposals such as allowing individuals to keep their existing insurance if they were satisfied with it, providing subsidies to help lower- and middle-income families afford insurance, and creating a national health insurance exchange where people could compare and purchase plans. Additionally, Obama supported measures to control healthcare costs through increased efficiency and prevention, as well as investing in healthcare technology and research. His ultimate goal was to achieve universal healthcare coverage in the U.S."
