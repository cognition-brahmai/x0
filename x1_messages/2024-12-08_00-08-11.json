The expression is:\n\n((4^2 * 3) / 2) + (5 * 8) - 10\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the exponentiation, multiplication, division, and addition/subtraction in the correct order, following the PEMDAS rule (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the exponentiation:\n\n4^2 = 16\n\nNow, plug that back into the expression:\n\n((16 * 3) / 2) + (5 * 8) - 10\n\nNext, do the multiplications inside the parentheses:\n\n16 * 3 = 48\n\n5 * 8 = 40\n\nSo now the expression is:\n\n(48 / 2) + 40 - 10\n\nNow, division:\n\n48 / 2 = 24\n\nSo the expression simplifies to:\n\n24 + 40 - 10\n\nNow, addition and subtraction from left to right:\n\n24 + 40 = 64\n\n64 - 10 = 54\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 54.\n"
