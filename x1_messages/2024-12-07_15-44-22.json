        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of pens: Type A costs $0.75 each, and Type B costs $1.25 each. I need to buy a total of 12 pens and spend exactly $10. I need to figure out how many of each type I bought.\n\nFirst, I think I should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define:\n\n- Let \\( a \\) be the number of Type A pens.\n\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of Type B pens.\n\nFrom the problem, I know two things:\n\n1. The total number of pens is 12, so \\( a + b = 12 \\).\n\n2. The total cost is $10, and since Type A pens cost $0.75 each and Type B pens cost $1.25 each, the cost equation would be \\( 0.75a + 1.25b = 10 \\).\n\nSo, I have a system of two equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\na + b = 12 \\\\\n0.75a + 1.25b = 10\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nI need to solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Let's see how to do that.\n\nOne way to solve this system is by substitution. I can solve the first equation for one variable and substitute it into the second equation.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for \\( a \\):\n\n\\( a = 12 - b \\)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( a \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 0.75(12 - b) + 1.25b = 10 \\)\n\nNow, let's distribute the 0.75:\n\n\\( 0.75 \\times 12 = 9 \\), and \\( 0.75 \\times (-b) = -0.75b \\), so:\n\n\\( 9 - 0.75b + 1.25b = 10 \\)\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n\\( -0.75b + 1.25b = 0.5b \\), so:\n\n\\( 9 + 0.5b = 10 \\)\n\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n\n\\( 0.5b = 1 \\)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.5:\n\n\\( b = 2 \\)\n\nSo, there are 2 Type B pens.\n\nNow, substitute back into the equation \\( a = 12 - b \\):\n\n\\( a = 12 - 2 = 10 \\)\n\nTherefore, there are 10 Type A pens and 2 Type B pens.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nTotal pens: \\( 10 + 2 = 12 \\), which matches.\n\nTotal cost: \\( 10 \\times 0.75 + 2 \\times 1.25 = 7.5 + 2.5 = 10 \\), which also matches.\n\nLooks good!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ Type A pens and } 2 \\text{ Type B pens}} \\]"
