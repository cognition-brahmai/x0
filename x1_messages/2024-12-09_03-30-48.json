        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem. We've got a group of 30 people: 18 with brown eyes and 12 with blue eyes. We need to find the probability that at least one of them has blue eyes when we select 3 people at random.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"at least one\" means in probability terms. \"At least one\" usually means one or more. So, in this case, it's the probability that one, two, or all three of the selected people have blue eyes.\n\nBut calculating that directly might be a bit complicated, especially since there are different combinations that can lead to at least one blue-eyed person. So, maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.\n\nI recall that the probability of an event happening is sometimes easier to find by calculating the probability of the event not happening and then subtracting that from 1. Does that make sense here?\n\nSo, the probability that at least one has blue eyes is equal to 1 minus the probability that none of them have blue eyes. That sounds promising.\n\nSo, first, I'll calculate the probability that all three selected people have brown eyes, and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability that at least one has blue eyes.\n\nLet's see. There are 18 brown-eyed people and 12 blue-eyed people, making 30 in total.\n\nIf I select the first person, the probability that they have brown eyes is 18/30.\n\nThen, if I select the second person, there are now 17 brown-eyed people left and a total of 29 people remaining.\n\nSo, the probability that the second person also has brown eyes is 17/29.\n\nSimilarly, for the third person, it would be 16/28, assuming the first two were brown-eyed.\n\nSo, the probability that all three have brown eyes is (18/30) * (17/29) * (16/28).\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, 18/30 simplifies to 3/5.\n\nThen, 17/29 remains as is.\n\nAnd 16/28 simplifies to 4/7.\n\nSo, multiplying these together: (3/5) * (17/29) * (4/7).\n\nLet's multiply the numerators: 3 * 17 * 4 = 204.\n\nDenominators: 5 * 29 * 7 = 1015.\n\nSo, the probability that all three have brown eyes is 204/1015.\n\nNow, to find the probability that at least one has blue eyes, I'll subtract this from 1.\n\nSo, 1 - 204/1015.\n\nTo subtract, I need a common denominator, which is 1015.\n\n1 is equal to 1015/1015.\n\nSo, 1015/1015 - 204/1015 = (1015 - 204)/1015 = 811/1015.\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of the three selected people has blue eyes is 811/1015.\n\nBut maybe I should check if this fraction can be simplified.\n\nLet's see, 811 and 1015. Are there any common factors?\n\n811 is a prime number, and 1015 divided by 5 is 203, which is 7*29. So, no common factors.\n\nTherefore, 811/1015 is already in its simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate this using combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to select 3 people out of 30 is C(30,3), which is 30 choose 3.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to select 3 brown-eyed people out of 18 is C(18,3).\n\nSo, the probability that all three have brown eyes is C(18,3)/C(30,3).\n\nThen, the probability that at least one has blue eyes is 1 - C(18,3)/C(30,3).\n\nLet me calculate C(18,3) and C(30,3).\n\nC(18,3) = 18! / (3! * (18-3)!) = (18*17*16)/(3*2*1) = 816/6 = 136.\n\nC(30,3) = 30! / (3! * 27!) = (30*29*28)/(3*2*1) = 30*29*28 / 6.\n\nCalculate numerator: 30*29 = 870, times 28 is 870*28.\n\nLet me compute that: 870*20 = 17400, 870*8 = 6960, total 17400 + 6960 = 24360.\n\nDenominator is 6, so 24360 / 6 = 4060.\n\nTherefore, C(30,3) = 4060.\n\nSo, the probability that all three have brown eyes is 136/4060.\n\nSimplify this fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 8.\n\n136 \u00f7 8 = 17, 4060 \u00f7 8 = 507.5, which is not an integer. Mistake.\n\nLet's try dividing by 4: 136 \u00f7 4 = 34, 4060 \u00f7 4 = 1015.\n\nSo, 34/1015.\n\nWait, earlier I had 204/1015, but now it's 34/1015. There's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated C(18,3).\n\nLet me recalculate C(18,3):\n\nC(18,3) = (18*17*16)/(3*2*1) = (4896)/6 = 816.\n\nWait, earlier I said 816/6 = 136, but that's incorrect.\n\n816 / 6 = 136, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 136/4060.\n\nBut earlier, I had 204/1015 using the step-by-step multiplication of probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in one of the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconcile these two methods.\n\nIn the first method, multiplying probabilities:\n\n(18/30) * (17/29) * (16/28) = (3/5) * (17/29) * (4/7) = (3*17*4)/(5*29*7) = 204/1015.\n\nBut using combinations, C(18,3)/C(30,3) = 136/4060.\n\nWait, 136/4060 simplifies to 34/1015.\n\nBut in the first method, I got 204/1015.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated C(18,3).\n\nWait, no, C(18,3) is indeed 816, and 816 / 6 = 136.\n\nAnd C(30,3) is 4060.\n\nSo, 136/4060 = 136 \u00f7 8 = 17, 4060 \u00f7 8 = 507.5, which is not integer.\n\nWait, 136 and 4060, greatest common divisor is 4.\n\n136 \u00f7 4 = 34, 4060 \u00f7 4 = 1015.\n\nSo, 34/1015.\n\nBut earlier, using the step-by-step multiplication, I got 204/1015.\n\nThere's inconsistency here, which suggests I made an error.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated C(18,3).\n\nWait, no, C(18,3) is indeed 816.\n\nWait, no, C(18,3) = (18*17*16)/(3*2*1) = (18*17*16)/6.\n\n18*17 = 306, times 16 is 4896.\n\n4896 / 6 = 816.\n\nWait, no, 4896 / 6 = 816, yes.\n\nSo, C(18,3) = 816.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 136, which was incorrect.\n\nWait, no, 816 / 6 = 136, but C(18,3) is 816.\n\nWait, no, C(18,3) = 816.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to double-check the combination formula.\n\nActually, C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!).\n\nSo, C(18,3) = (18*17*16)/(3*2*1) = 816.\n\nSimilarly, C(30,3) = (30*29*28)/(3*2*1) = 4060.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting 3 brown-eyed people is 816 / 4060.\n\nSimplify 816 and 4060 by dividing numerator and denominator by 8.\n\n816 \u00f7 8 = 102, 4060 \u00f7 8 = 507.5, not integer.\n\nWait, 816 \u00f7 8 = 102, but 4060 \u00f7 8 = 507.5, which is not integer.\n\nSo, not divisible by 8.\n\nLet's try dividing numerator and denominator by 4.\n\n816 \u00f7 4 = 204, 4060 \u00f7 4 = 1015.\n\nSo, 204/1015.\n\nAh, now it matches the earlier result of 204/1015 using the step-by-step multiplication.\n\nSo, the probability of selecting 3 brown-eyed people is 204/1015.\n\nTherefore, the probability of at least one blue-eyed person is 1 - 204/1015 = (1015 - 204)/1015 = 811/1015.\n\nThis fraction cannot be simplified further, as 811 is a prime number and does not divide into 1015.\n\nSo, the final answer is 811/1015.\n\nAlternatively, I could express this as a decimal for better understanding.\n\n811 \u00f7 1015 \u2248 0.7990, which is approximately 79.9%.\n\nSo, there's roughly an 80% chance that at least one of the three selected people has blue eyes.\n\nI think this makes sense, given that more than half of the group has brown eyes, but still a significant portion has blue eyes.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the proportion of blue-eyed people.\n\nThere are 12 blue-eyed out of 30, which is 12/30 = 40%.\n\nSo, it's likely that in a group of 3, at least one has blue eyes.\n\nThis conclusion aligns with that.\n\nJust to summarize, the probability that at least one of the three selected people has blue eyes is 811/1015, or approximately 79.9%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{811}{1015}} \\]"
