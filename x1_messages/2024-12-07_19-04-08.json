        "content": "Let's figure out how much electricity an office building consumes in a non-leap year if it uses 150 kWh per day.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many days are in a non-leap year. I remember that a non-leap year has 365 days.\n\nSo, if the building uses 150 kWh each day, and there are 365 days in a year, I can find the total annual consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by the number of days in a year.\n\nThat is:\n\nTotal annual consumption = daily consumption \u00d7 number of days in a year\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal annual consumption = 150 kWh/day \u00d7 365 days\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication.\n\n150 multiplied by 365.\n\nI can break this down to make it easier.\n\nFirst, 150 \u00d7 300 = 45,000\n\nThen, 150 \u00d7 60 = 9,000\n\nFinally, 150 \u00d7 5 = 750\n\nNow, add those together:\n\n45,000 + 9,000 = 54,000\n\n54,000 + 750 = 54,750\n\nSo, the total annual consumption is 54,750 kWh.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check the multiplication.\n\n150 \u00d7 365:\n\nI can also think of it as 150 \u00d7 (360 + 5) = (150 \u00d7 360) + (150 \u00d7 5)\n\n150 \u00d7 360 = 54,000\n\n150 \u00d7 5 = 750\n\nAdding them up: 54,000 + 750 = 54,750\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that 150 kWh per day for 365 days is the same as 150 \u00d7 365 kWh.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, maybe I can calculate it differently.\n\nLet's see, 150 \u00d7 365:\n\nI can multiply 100 \u00d7 365 = 36,500\n\nAnd 50 \u00d7 365 = 18,250\n\nThen, 36,500 + 18,250 = 54,750\n\nSame result again.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that there are 52 weeks in a year, but that might not be as precise because 52 weeks are 364 days. But since the question is about a non-leap year, which has 365 days, it's more accurate to use 365 directly.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial calculation:\n\nTotal annual consumption = 150 kWh/day \u00d7 365 days/year = 54,750 kWh/year\n\nTherefore, the office building consumes 54,750 kWh of electricity in a non-leap year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{54750} \\]"
