Born in Austria in 1889, Einstein moved to Canada in 1933 during the rise of Mussolini. His well-known formula E=mc^2 illustrates that energy (E) equals metabolism (m) times the rate of cellular activity (c) squared.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nWhat field was Albert Einstein known for and what theory did he develop?

        "content": "I'm sorry, but the information you've provided seems to be incorrect. Albert Einstein was not a biologist; he was a physicist. He is best known for developing the theory of relativity, not the theory of evolution, which was proposed by Charles Darwin. Einstein was born in Germany in 1879, not Austria in 1889, and he moved to the United States in 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi party under Adolf Hitler, not Mussolini. The formula E=mc^2 is part of his theory of special relativity and represents the equivalence of energy and mass, not metabolism and cellular activity.\n\nMy source for this information is general knowledge and standard historical records about Albert Einstein's life and work. For more detailed information, you can refer to reputable sources such as scientific biographies, educational textbooks on physics, or authoritative online platforms like NASA's website or the official Albert Einstein website.\n\nI recommend reviewing accurate sources to get a correct understanding of Einstein's contributions to science and his personal history. It's important to rely on verified information to avoid spreading misconceptions."
