First, you want to know more about Microsoft, see if there are any software engineer jobs in Seattle, and then check if your resume matches those job requirements. Okay, so I'll use the tools provided to gather all this information.\n\n**Step 1: Research Microsoft**\n\nI'll start by using LinkedIn to get some professional insights about Microsoft. LinkedIn is great for company profiles because it shows employees, connections, and sometimes even detailed information about the company culture and recent updates.\n\n**Action:** Use LinkedIn[input] with \"Microsoft\" as the input.\n\n**Expected Evidence:** A profile page for Microsoft on LinkedIn, showing overview, employees, recent activity, and maybe some insights into their work environment.\n\n**Step 2: Check for Job Openings**\n\nNext, I need to find out if Microsoft has any software engineer positions open in Seattle. Since Indeed is a job search engine, it should be able to pull up relevant job postings based on location and job title.\n\n**Action:** Use Indeed[input] with \"Software Engineer\" as the job title and \"Seattle\" as the location.\n\n**Expected Evidence:** A list of job postings for software engineers in Seattle, potentially including positions at Microsoft.\n\n**Step 3: Extract Skills from Resume**\n\nNow, to see if your resume matches the job requirements, I first need to extract the skills listed in your resume. The ResumeParser tool should be able to handle that.\n\n**Action:** Use ResumeParser[input] with your resume document as the input.\n\n**Expected Evidence:** A list of skills extracted from your resume.\n\n**Step 4: Match Skills with Job Requirements**\n\nFinally, I need to see how well your skills align with what Microsoft is looking for in their software engineer roles. The JobMatch tool seems perfect for this, as it can compare your skills with the job requirements.\n\n**Action:** Use JobMatch[input] with the skills extracted from your resume and the job requirements from the Microsoft software engineer positions found earlier.\n\n**Expected Evidence:** A report or score indicating the match between your skills and the job requirements.\n\n**Overall Plan:**\n\n1. Use LinkedIn to research Microsoft and gather company information.\n2. Use Indeed to find software engineer job openings in Seattle at Microsoft.\n3. Use ResumeParser to extract skills from your resume.\n4. Use JobMatch to compare your skills with the requirements of the Microsoft software engineer positions.\n\nThis should give you a comprehensive understanding of Microsoft, the current job market for software engineers in Seattle, and how well your skills align with those positions."
