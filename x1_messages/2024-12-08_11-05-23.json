        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a box containing red and yellow balls. The ratio of red balls to yellow balls is 3:2, and there are 15 more red balls than yellow balls. I need to find out how many yellow balls there are.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what a ratio is. A ratio compares two quantities by division. So, when it says the ratio of red balls to yellow balls is 3:2, it means that for every 3 red balls, there are 2 yellow balls.\n\nNow, let's denote the number of red balls as R and the number of yellow balls as Y. According to the ratio, R/Y = 3/2.\n\nBut there's also another piece of information: there are 15 more red balls than yellow balls. So, R = Y + 15.\n\nOkay, so now I have two equations:\n\n1. R/Y = 3/2\n\n2. R = Y + 15\n\nI can use these two equations to solve for Y, the number of yellow balls.\n\nFirst, from the first equation, R/Y = 3/2, I can cross-multiply to get 2R = 3Y.\n\nSo, 2R = 3Y.\n\nNow, from the second equation, R = Y + 15, I can substitute this into the first equation.\n\nSubstituting R in the first equation:\n\n2(Y + 15) = 3Y\n\nNow, let's solve for Y.\n\n2Y + 30 = 3Y\n\nSubtract 2Y from both sides:\n\n30 = Y\n\nSo, Y = 30.\n\nTherefore, there are 30 yellow balls.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nIf Y = 30, then R = Y + 15 = 30 + 15 = 45.\n\nNow, check the ratio: R/Y = 45/30 = 3/2, which matches the given ratio.\n\nAlso, 45 is indeed 15 more than 30.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
