        "content": "If you flip a coin twice, the probability of getting two heads can be calculated by understanding the individual probabilities of each flip and then combining them since the flips are independent events.\n\nFirst, let's consider a single coin flip. A fair coin has two sides: heads (H) and tails (T), each with an equal probability of landing face up. Therefore, the probability of getting heads in a single flip is:\n\n\\[ P(H) = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nSince the coin flips are independent, meaning the outcome of the first flip does not affect the outcome of the second flip, the probability of both events happening (getting heads on the first flip and heads on the second flip) is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, the probability of getting two heads in two flips is:\n\n\\[ P(H \\text{ and } H) = P(H) \\times P(H) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nTo express this as a decimal or percentage:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 = 25\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, there is a 25% chance of getting two heads when you flip a coin twice.\n\nTo further illustrate this, let's list all possible outcomes when flipping a coin twice:\n\n1. Heads on the first flip and heads on the second flip (H, H)\n\n2. Heads on the first flip and tails on the second flip (H, T)\n\n3. Tails on the first flip and heads on the second flip (T, H)\n\n4. Tails on the first flip and tails on the second flip (T, T)\n\nThere are four possible outcomes, and only one of them is getting two heads. Therefore, the probability is indeed:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nor 25%.\n\nI hope this explanation helps! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."
