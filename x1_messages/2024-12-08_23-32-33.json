        "content": "I think you're referring to \"The Lord of the Rings\" by J.R.R. Tolkien. In that epic high fantasy series, there is indeed a powerful ring that plays a central role in the story. The ring in question is known as the One Ring, also referred to as the Ring of Power or the Great Ring.\n\nTo provide some background, the One Ring was created by the Dark Lord Sauron in the Second Age of Middle-earth, with the intention of exerting control over the other Rings of Power that were made by the Elves. These Rings were given to various rulers and leaders, including Men, Dwarves, and Elves, in an attempt to dominate them and bring them under Sauron's will.\n\nHowever, the Elves became wise to Sauron's plans and hid their Rings, preventing him from seizing control over them directly. In response, Sauron forged the One Ring, which had the power to control the other Rings and their bearers. This led to the War of the Last Alliance, where Sauron was defeated by Gil-galad and Elendil, and Isildur, Elendil's son, cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand.\n\nUnfortunately, Isildur chose to keep the Ring for himself rather than destroy it, believing it to be too powerful to discard. This decision set into motion a chain of events that would ultimately lead to the events of \"The Lord of the Rings\" in the Third Age.\n\nFast-forwarding to the time of the story, the One Ring has fallen into the hands of the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, who found it while traveling with Thorin Oakenshield and his company of Dwarves. Bilbo's nephew, Frodo Baggins, inherits the Ring and, with the help of his friends and various allies, must undertake a perilous journey to destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom, where it was forged.\n\nThe destruction of the One Ring is seen as the only way to defeat Sauron and save Middle-earth from his darkness. Throughout the story, the Ring's corrupting influence poses a constant threat to those who possess it, making the quest both physically and morally challenging.\n\nSo, to directly answer your question, the powerful ring that must be destroyed to save the world from darkness in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth is the One Ring."
