So first, I need to find out how many students passed.\n\nTo find 75% of 40, I can calculate it as follows:\n\n75% of 40 = (75/100) * 40 = 0.75 * 40 = 30 students passed the exam.\n\nNow, of those who passed, 60% scored above 80%. So, I need to find out how many students that is.\n\n60% of 30 = (60/100) * 30 = 0.6 * 30 = 18 students scored above 80%.\n\nTherefore, 18 students scored above 80% on the exam.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
