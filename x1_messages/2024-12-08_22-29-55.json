        "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you solve this differential equation using Laplace transforms. The equation is:\n\ny''(t) + 4y'(t) + 3y(t) = 0\n\nwith initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0.\n\nFirst, recall that the Laplace transform of a function y(t) is denoted by Y(s), where:\n\nY(s) = L{y(t)} = \u222b_0^\u221e e^(-st) y(t) dt\n\nWe'll need the Laplace transforms of y''(t) and y'(t). The formulas are:\n\nL{y'(t)} = sY(s) - y(0)\n\nL{y''(t)} = s\u00b2Y(s) - s y(0) - y'(0)\n\nGiven the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0, we can plug these into the transforms:\n\nL{y'(t)} = sY(s) - 1\n\nL{y''(t)} = s\u00b2Y(s) - s * 1 - 0 = s\u00b2Y(s) - s\n\nNow, take the Laplace transform of both sides of the differential equation:\n\nL{y''(t) + 4y'(t) + 3y(t)} = L{0}\n\nUsing the linearity of the Laplace transform:\n\nL{y''(t)} + 4 L{y'(t)} + 3 L{y(t)} = 0\n\nSubstitute the expressions we have:\n\n(s\u00b2Y(s) - s) + 4(sY(s) - 1) + 3Y(s) = 0\n\nNow, expand and collect like terms:\n\ns\u00b2Y(s) - s + 4sY(s) - 4 + 3Y(s) = 0\n\nCombine the Y(s) terms:\n\n(s\u00b2 + 4s + 3)Y(s) - s - 4 = 0\n\nNow, solve for Y(s):\n\n(s\u00b2 + 4s + 3)Y(s) = s + 4\n\nY(s) = (s + 4) / (s\u00b2 + 4s + 3)\n\nNext, factor the denominator:\n\ns\u00b2 + 4s + 3 = (s + 1)(s + 3)\n\nSo, Y(s) = (s + 4) / [(s + 1)(s + 3)]\n\nNow, we'll perform partial fraction decomposition to express Y(s) as a sum of simpler fractions:\n\n(s + 4) / [(s + 1)(s + 3)] = A / (s + 1) + B / (s + 3)\n\nMultiply both sides by the denominator (s + 1)(s + 3):\n\ns + 4 = A(s + 3) + B(s + 1)\n\nExpand the right-hand side:\n\ns + 4 = As + 3A + Bs + B\n\nCombine like terms:\n\ns + 4 = (A + B)s + (3A + B)\n\nNow, set up a system of equations by equating coefficients:\n\nA + B = 1 (from the coefficients of s)\n\n3A + B = 4 (from the constant terms)\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(3A + B) - (A + B) = 4 - 1\n\n2A = 3\n\nA = 3/2\n\nNow, plug A back into the first equation:\n\n3/2 + B = 1\n\nB = 1 - 3/2 = -1/2\n\nSo, the partial fractions are:\n\nY(s) = (3/2) / (s + 1) - (1/2) / (s + 3)\n\nNow, take the inverse Laplace transform of both sides to find y(t):\n\ny(t) = L^{-1}{ (3/2) / (s + 1) } - L^{-1}{ (1/2) / (s + 3) }\n\nRecall that L^{-1}{1 / (s + a)} = e^{-at}\n\nTherefore:\n\ny(t) = (3/2)e^{-t} - (1/2)e^{-3t}\n\nSo, the solution to the differential equation is:\n\ny(t) = (3/2)e^{-t} - (1/2)e^{-3t}\n\nwith the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0.\n\nLet me verify this solution by plugging it back into the original equation.\n\nFirst, compute y'(t):\n\ny'(t) = -(3/2)e^{-t} + (3/2)e^{-3t}\n\nThen y''(t):\n\ny''(t) = (3/2)e^{-t} - (9/2)e^{-3t}\n\nNow, plug into the differential equation:\n\ny'' + 4y' + 3y = (3/2)e^{-t} - (9/2)e^{-3t} + 4[ -(3/2)e^{-t} + (3/2)e^{-3t} ] + 3[ (3/2)e^{-t} - (1/2)e^{-3t} ]\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n(3/2)e^{-t} - (9/2)e^{-3t} -6e^{-t} + 6e^{-3t} + (9/2)e^{-t} - (3/2)e^{-3t}\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\nFor e^{-t} terms:\n\n3/2 - 6 + 9/2 = (3/2 + 9/2) - 6 = (12/2) - 6 = 6 - 6 = 0\n\nFor e^{-3t} terms:\n\n-9/2 + 6 - 3/2 = (-9/2 - 3/2) + 6 = -12/2 + 6 = -6 + 6 = 0\n\nSo, y'' + 4y' + 3y = 0, which confirms our solution.\n\nAlso, check the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = (3/2)e^{0} - (1/2)e^{0} = 3/2 - 1/2 = 1\n\ny'(0) = -(3/2)e^{0} + (3/2)e^{0} = -3/2 + 3/2 = 0\n\nBoth initial conditions are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{y(t) = \\frac{3}{2}e^{-t} - \\frac{1}{2}e^{-3t}} \\]"
