        "content": "So there are 100 people in the room. Out of these, 50 are wearing glasses, and 30 are wearing hats. But, 20 people are wearing both glasses and hats. I need to find out how many people are wearing neither glasses nor hats.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a problem involving sets, maybe overlapping sets. I think I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here.\n\nSo, the total number of people wearing either glasses or hats or both would be the number wearing glasses plus the number wearing hats minus the number wearing both, right? Because those wearing both are counted in both the glasses and hats groups, so we need to subtract them once to avoid double-counting.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber wearing glasses or hats or both = (Number wearing glasses) + (Number wearing hats) - (Number wearing both)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n= 50 + 30 - 20\n\n= 60\n\nSo, 60 people are wearing either glasses or hats or both.\n\nNow, to find the number of people wearing neither, I think I can subtract this number from the total number of people in the room.\n\nNeither = Total - (Glasses or Hats or Both)\n\n= 100 - 60\n\n= 40\n\nTherefore, 40 people are wearing neither glasses nor hats.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf there are 50 wearing glasses and 30 wearing hats, but 20 are wearing both, then the number wearing only glasses would be 50 - 20 = 30, and the number wearing only hats would be 30 - 20 = 10. So, only glasses: 30, only hats: 10, both: 20. That adds up to 30 + 10 + 20 = 60, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the remaining people should be wearing neither, which is 100 - 60 = 40.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it using a Venn diagram. Imagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents glasses, the other represents hats.\n\nThe glasses circle has 50 people, but since 20 of those also wear hats, only 30 wear only glasses.\n\nThe hats circle has 30 people, but 20 of those also wear glasses, so only 10 wear only hats.\n\nThe overlapping area is 20 people wearing both.\n\nSo, the total wearing glasses or hats or both is 30 (only glasses) + 10 (only hats) + 20 (both) = 60.\n\nAgain, 100 - 60 = 40 wearing neither.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
