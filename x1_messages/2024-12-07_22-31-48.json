        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to read a book that's 480 pages in 24 hours, and I have to figure out how many pages I should read per hour if I read at a constant pace. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the number of pages per hour. So, that means I have to divide the total number of pages by the total number of hours I have to read them. So, pages per hour equals total pages divided by total hours.\n\nSo, pages per hour = 480 pages / 24 hours.\n\nNow, let's do the math. 480 divided by 24. Hmm, what's 24 times 20? That's 480. So, 24 times 20 equals 480. Therefore, 480 divided by 24 is 20.\n\nSo, I need to read 20 pages per hour.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If I have 24 hours to read 480 pages, and I read 20 pages each hour, then in 24 hours, I would have read 20 pages/hour times 24 hours, which equals 480 pages. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of time per page. So, if I want to know how much time I have per page, I could divide the total hours by the total pages. So, hours per page = 24 hours / 480 pages.\n\nLet's see: 24 divided by 480. That's the same as 24/480, which simplifies to 1/20. So, 1/20 of an hour per page. And since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 1/20 of an hour is 3 minutes per page.\n\nBut that seems like a lot of time per page. Wait, no, actually, if I have to read 480 pages in 24 hours, that's pretty intense. Reading one page every 3 minutes might be manageable, but it's a lot of reading.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about reading for a certain number of minutes per hour. So, if I read for, say, 50 minutes out of every hour, that leaves 10 minutes for breaks or other activities.\n\nBut the problem says I have to read at a constant pace for 24 hours. So, perhaps I need to read continuously without breaks.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify anything about breaks. It just says I have 24 hours to read the book at a constant pace.\n\nSo, perhaps it's assuming that I read continuously without any breaks.\n\nIn that case, reading 20 pages per hour for 24 hours straight would get me through the 480 pages.\n\nBut realistically, that seems challenging. I mean, reading for 24 hours without sleeping or taking breaks isn't feasible for most people. But maybe in this hypothetical scenario, it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to make a point about the impracticality of such a reading schedule, but from a purely mathematical perspective, the answer is 20 pages per hour.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe I can think about the total reading time required if I read at a certain speed.\n\nFor example, if I read at a speed of 20 pages per hour, then for 480 pages, it would take me 24 hours, which matches the given time.\n\nAlternatively, if I read faster, say 30 pages per hour, then I would finish the book in 16 hours (since 480 divided by 30 is 16). But the problem specifies 24 hours, so I need to read at a pace that allows me to finish in exactly 24 hours.\n\nTherefore, 20 pages per hour is the required constant pace.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors I should account for.\n\nIs there any possibility that the book has varying page lengths or different reading difficulties? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I'll assume that all pages are of equal length and readability.\n\nAlso, the problem states that I have 24 hours to read the book, but it doesn't specify whether I have to read the entire time or if I can take breaks.\n\nFrom a strict mathematical perspective, as long as I read a total of 480 pages within 24 hours, it's acceptable.\n\nBut since it mentions a constant pace, it probably means that I should read at a steady rate throughout the 24 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if I take breaks, I would need to read faster during the times I am reading to make up for the lost time.\n\nBut again, the problem specifies a constant pace, which likely means a constant reading speed without accounting for breaks.\n\nTherefore, the answer remains 20 pages per hour.\n\nLet me consider dimensional analysis to confirm.\n\nPages per hour = total pages / total hours.\n\nSo, 480 pages / 24 hours = 20 pages/hour.\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider hours per page, it's 24 hours / 480 pages = 0.05 hours per page.\n\nAnd since 0.05 hours is 3 minutes (because 0.05 * 60 minutes = 3 minutes), that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, reading one page every 3 minutes, or 20 pages per hour.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the total reading time.\n\nIf I read for 24 hours at 20 pages per hour, total pages read = 24 * 20 = 480 pages.\n\nPerfect, it matches the total number of pages in the book.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to read faster, say 25 pages per hour, then in 24 hours, I would read 24 * 25 = 600 pages, which is more than the book's length.\n\nSimilarly, if I read slower, say 15 pages per hour, then 24 * 15 = 360 pages, which is less than the book's length.\n\nTherefore, 20 pages per hour is the exact pace needed to finish the book in 24 hours.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem.\n\nPerhaps the book has chapters, and I need to read a certain number of chapters per hour.\n\nBut the problem specifies pages, not chapters, so I should stick with pages.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are illustrations or other non-text elements on some pages that might take less time to \"read.\"\n\nBut again, the problem doesn't specify any variations in page content, so I'll assume all pages are text-heavy and require the same reading time.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the book is divided into sections, and I need to read each section within a certain time frame.\n\nBut again, the problem doesn't provide that level of detail, so I'll stick with the overall total.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are time constraints within the 24 hours, like specific times when I can't read.\n\nBut the problem states \"you have 24 hours to read a book,\" so I'll assume those are the only constraints.\n\nTherefore, the answer remains 20 pages per hour.\n\nLet me think about real-world applications.\n\nIf someone actually had to read a 480-page book in 24 hours, they would need to read 20 pages every hour continuously.\n\nThat would require planning, perhaps setting reminders to read every hour, and ensuring that they have enough time set aside without interruptions.\n\nAlternatively, if they choose to read in longer sessions, say 4 hours at a time with breaks in between, they would need to adjust their reading speed accordingly.\n\nFor example, if they read for 4 hours straight, they would need to read 80 pages in those 4 hours, which is 20 pages per hour, same as before.\n\nThen, they could take a break before starting the next session.\n\nBut the problem specifies a constant pace, so perhaps it's assuming continuous reading.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reader can read faster or slower at different times, as long as the total pages read in 24 hours is 480.\n\nBut the problem specifies a constant pace, so I think the answer is indeed 20 pages per hour.\n\nLet me consider if there's any mathematical formula that applies here.\n\nWell, rate is equal to distance over time, or in this case, pages over hours.\n\nSo, rate = pages / hours.\n\nTherefore, rate = 480 pages / 24 hours = 20 pages per hour.\n\nThat's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider time = distance / rate, then time = pages / pages per hour.\n\nSo, time = 480 pages / 20 pages per hour = 24 hours, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the answer is definitely 20 pages per hour.\n\nI think I've considered all possible angles and confirmed the answer through multiple methods.\n\nSo, the final answer is 20 pages per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
