        "content": "D. To reduce inflected words to their root form.\n\nStemming is a process in natural language processing (NLP) that reduces words to their base or root form, known as a stem, by removing prefixes and suffixes. This technique is used to normalize words and reduce them to a common base, which can help in tasks like information retrieval, text classification, and sentiment analysis by reducing the dimensionality of the data and grouping together words with the same root.\n\nFor example, the words \"running,\" \"runner,\" and \"runs\" would all be reduced to the stem \"run.\" This helps in treating these words as the same word for analysis purposes, which can be particularly useful when dealing with large volumes of text data.\n\nWhile options A, B, and C are all important aspects of NLP, they are not the primary purposes of stemming. Determining the part of speech (option A) involves identifying whether a word is a noun, verb, adjective, etc., which is different from reducing words to their root form. Understanding sentiment (option B) involves determining the emotional tone or opinion behind words, such as positive, negative, or neutral, which again is separate from stemming. Translating text from one language to another (option C) is a different NLP task known as machine translation, which doesn't directly involve stemming, although stemming might be a preprocessing step in some translation models.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: To reduce inflected words to their root form."
