        "content": "So the factory is making two different products, product A and product B, right? And it's producing 500 units of A each day and 300 units of B each day. We need to find out how many total units of both products are made in 15 days.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many units of each product are made in one day and then multiply that by the number of days, which is 15.\n\nSo, for product A, it's 500 units per day. Over 15 days, that would be 500 units/day times 15 days, which is 500 * 15.\n\nSimilarly, for product B, it's 300 units per day. Over 15 days, that would be 300 units/day times 15 days, which is 300 * 15.\n\nThen, I need to add those two amounts together to get the total units produced in 15 days.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 500 * 15.\n\n500 times 15.\n\nWell, 500 times 10 is 5000, and 500 times 5 is 2500. So, 5000 plus 2500 is 7500.\n\nSo, product A: 7500 units in 15 days.\n\nNext, 300 * 15.\n\n300 times 15.\n\n300 times 10 is 3000, and 300 times 5 is 1500. So, 3000 plus 1500 is 4500.\n\nSo, product B: 4500 units in 15 days.\n\nNow, total units are 7500 plus 4500.\n\n7500 + 4500 is 12,000.\n\nSo, the factory produces a total of 12,000 units in 15 days.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the total units produced per day of both products and then multiply by 15.\n\nSo, per day, it's 500 + 300 = 800 units.\n\nThen, 800 units per day times 15 days is 800 * 15.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n800 * 15.\n\n800 times 10 is 8000, and 800 times 5 is 4000. So, 8000 plus 4000 is 12,000.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nSo, yes, the factory produces a total of 12,000 units in 15 days.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any other factors, like weekends or holidays, but the question doesn't mention any days off or anything like that. It just says 15 days, so I assume it's 15 consecutive days of production.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the factory is producing both products every day, so the daily production rates are constant.\n\nTherefore, the total production over 15 days is indeed 12,000 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12000} \\]"
