        "content": "Let's see. There are 7 friends going on a trip, and each one has a car that can fit 5 people, including the driver. So, each car can carry 4 passengers plus the driver.\n\nFirst thought: since each car can hold 5 people and there are 7 friends, maybe they can all fit into two cars. Let's check that.\n\nIf two cars are used, each carrying 5 people, that's a total of 10 people. But there are only 7 friends, so that seems more than enough. Wait, but if each car has to have a driver, and there are 7 friends, does that mean that some cars will have fewer passengers?\n\nLet me think differently. If each car must have one driver, and the driver can't be counted as a passenger in their own car, then each car can carry 4 passengers.\n\nSo, with 7 friends, if each car has one driver and 4 passengers, how many cars are needed?\n\nLet's denote the number of cars as x. Each car has 1 driver and 4 passengers, so total people per car is 5.\n\nBut since the drivers are also part of the 7 friends, we need to account for that.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider the total number of people to be transported is 7, and each car can carry up to 4 passengers plus the driver.\n\nBut the driver is one of the 7 friends, so the number of drivers is equal to the number of cars.\n\nSo, if there are x cars, there are x drivers, and the remaining friends are passengers.\n\nTotal friends: 7 = number of drivers (x) + number of passengers.\n\nEach car can carry 4 passengers, so total passengers are 4x.\n\nSo, 7 = x + 4x = 5x.\n\nTherefore, x = 7/5 = 1.4.\n\nBut you can't have 1.4 cars, so you need to round up to the next whole number, which is 2.\n\nSo, they need 2 cars.\n\nBut wait, let's check if that works.\n\nWith 2 cars, each with 1 driver and 4 passengers, that's 2 drivers and 8 passengers, totaling 10 people. But there are only 7 friends, so that's more than enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can manage with just 2 cars.\n\nWait, but 7 friends, each car has 1 driver and 4 passengers.\n\nIf they use 2 cars:\n\n- Car 1: 1 driver + 4 passengers = 5 people\n\n- Car 2: 1 driver + 2 passengers = 3 people\n\nWait, but that's only 8 people, but we have 7, so it works.\n\nAlternatively, another way: since each car can hold 5 people including the driver, and there are 7 friends, perhaps they can optimize the seating.\n\nFor example, have some cars with fewer passengers if needed.\n\nBut the question is, how many cars do they need so that all 7 friends can go on the trip.\n\nGiven that each car can hold up to 5 people, and there are 7 friends, the minimum number of cars needed would be ceil(7/5) = 2 cars.\n\nBut wait, in reality, since each car must have a driver who is one of the friends, and the driver can't be counted as a passenger in their own car, we need to make sure that the drivers are accounted for.\n\nLet me try to think of it this way: each car requires one driver, and can carry up to 4 additional passengers.\n\nSo, per car:\n\nDrivers: 1\n\nPassengers: up to 4\n\nTotal per car: 5\n\nTotal friends: 7\n\nLet\u2019s set up the equation:\n\nNumber of drivers (x) + number of passengers (4x) = 7\n\nSo, x + 4x = 7\n\n5x = 7\n\nx = 1.4\n\nSince x must be an integer (number of cars), we round up to x = 2.\n\nSo, they need 2 cars.\n\nBut let's see if that makes sense.\n\nWith 2 cars:\n\n- Car 1: 1 driver + 4 passengers = 5 people\n\n- Car 2: 1 driver + 2 passengers = 3 people\n\nTotal: 8 people, but we only have 7 friends.\n\nSo, it works, although one car has only 2 passengers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can arrange it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps one car carries 1 driver and 3 passengers, and the other car carries 1 driver and 3 passengers.\n\nSo, Car 1: 1 + 3 = 4 people\n\nCar 2: 1 + 3 = 4 people\n\nTotal: 8 people, but again, we only have 7 friends.\n\nAlternatively, one car could have 1 driver and 4 passengers, and the other car could have 1 driver and 2 passengers.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIn any case, 2 cars seem sufficient.\n\nCan they manage with just 1 car?\n\nLet's see: one car can hold 5 people, including the driver.\n\nSo, with 1 car, 1 driver + 4 passengers = 5 people.\n\nBut there are 7 friends, so 2 friends would be left without a ride.\n\nTherefore, 1 car is not enough.\n\nSo, the minimum number of cars needed is 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can use 3 cars, but that would be unnecessary since 2 cars can accommodate all 7 friends.\n\nTherefore, the most efficient way is to use 2 cars.\n\nHence, the answer is 2 cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
