        "content": "So there's this problem about two trains leaving from different towns and traveling towards each other. Town A and Town B are 200 miles apart. One train leaves Town A at 8 am going 60 mph, and the other leaves Town B at the same time going 40 mph. I need to find out when they'll pass each other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. Both trains are moving towards each other, so their speeds will add up when calculating how quickly they approach each other. So, the combined speed is 60 mph + 40 mph = 100 mph.\n\nNow, the distance between the towns is 200 miles. So, if they're closing the gap at 100 miles per hour, I can find the time it takes for them to meet by dividing the distance by their combined speed. That is, time = distance / speed = 200 miles / 100 mph = 2 hours.\n\nSince both trains leave at 8 am, I just need to add 2 hours to that time. So, 8 am + 2 hours = 10 am.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Let's think about it differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the position of each train as a function of time. Let's denote the time elapsed since 8 am as t hours.\n\nThe position of the train from Town A after t hours would be: distance = speed * time = 60 mph * t.\n\nSimilarly, the position of the train from Town B after t hours would be: 200 miles - (40 mph * t), because it's traveling towards Town A from the opposite direction.\n\nWhen they pass each other, their positions are equal. So, 60t = 200 - 40t.\n\nNow, solving for t:\n\n60t + 40t = 200\n\n100t = 200\n\nt = 2 hours.\n\nAgain, I get 2 hours, which confirms my first calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the concept of relative speed. Since they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is 100 mph, and the distance is 200 miles, so time is 2 hours.\n\nI think this is solid. So, the trains will pass each other at 10 am.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, are there any adjustments for time zones or anything like that? The problem seems to be set in a straightforward scenario with no additional complications.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the units are consistent: both speeds are in mph, and the distance is in miles, so the time comes out in hours, which is consistent.\n\nI can also perform a quick reality check. If one train is going 60 mph and the other 40 mph, together they're closing the gap at 100 mph. So, for 200 miles, it should take 2 hours, which makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 10:00 am.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10:00 \\text{ am}} \\]"
