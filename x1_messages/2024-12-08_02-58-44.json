According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2016, the obesity rate in India was around 3.9%, while in Japan, it was around 3.5%. However, it's important to note that both countries have different definitions and measurements of obesity, and the rates may have changed since then. Additionally, while India has a higher obesity rate, Japan has a higher rate of overweight individuals, with around 38.8% of the population being overweight in 2016, compared to around 20% in India."
