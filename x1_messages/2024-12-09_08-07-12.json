        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a C# .NET Core console application that can send email notifications with attachments using SMTP, and it should take command line arguments for recipients, subject, body, attachment paths, and SMTP configuration. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I cover all the bases here.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up a new .NET Core console project. I'll open my terminal and use the dotnet CLI to create it. Let's say I'll name it \"EmailSender\".\n\n```\ndotnet new console -n EmailSender\ncd EmailSender\n```\n\nNow, I need to handle command line arguments. In .NET Core, the `Main` method can accept an array of strings which are the command line arguments. I'll need to parse these arguments to get the recipient email, subject, body, attachment paths, and SMTP configuration like server, port, username, and password.\n\nI should consider using a library to make handling command line arguments easier. Maybe something like CommandLineParser. I can add it via NuGet.\n\n```\ndotnet add package CommandLineParser\n```\n\nNext, I need to set up the email sending functionality. For that, I'll use the System.Net.Mail namespace, which provides classes for sending emails via SMTP.\n\nI'll need to create an SmtpClient, set its host and port, and possibly enable SSL if required. Then, create a MailMessage object, set the from, to, subject, body, and attachments, and finally, send the message using the SmtpClient.\n\nBut wait, I need to think about security here. Handling passwords and sensitive information like SMTP credentials via command line arguments isn't the safest approach, especially since command line history can be logged. Maybe I should consider environment variables or configuration files for sensitive data, but since the task specifies using command line arguments, I'll proceed with that, keeping in mind the security implications.\n\nLet me sketch out the structure of the program:\n\n1. Parse command line arguments to get recipient, subject, body, attachment paths, and SMTP configuration.\n\n2. Validate the arguments to ensure all required fields are provided.\n\n3. Set up the SmtpClient with the provided SMTP configuration.\n\n4. Create a MailMessage with the provided information, including attachments.\n\n5. Send the email and handle any exceptions that might occur.\n\nI should also consider internationalization, like allowing non-ASCII characters in the subject and body. Make sure to set the proper encoding.\n\nAttachments could be multiple, so I need to handle an array of attachment paths.\n\nLet me think about the command line argument structure. Maybe something like this:\n\n```\ndotnet run --recipient recipient@example.com --subject \"Test Email\" --body \"Hello, this is a test email.\" --attachment path/to/file1.txt --attachment path/to/file2.jpg --smtpserver smtp.example.com --smtpport 587 --username user@example.com --password secretpassword\n```\n\nSo, arguments can have multiple attachments specified.\n\nI'll need to define options classes for CommandLineParser to bind the arguments to.\n\nHere's a rough outline of the classes:\n\n```csharp\nclass Options\n{\n    [Option('r', \"recipient\", Required = true, HelpText = \"Recipient email address.\")]\n    public string Recipient { get; set; }\n\n    [Option('s', \"subject\", Required = true, HelpText = \"Email subject.\")]\n    public string Subject { get; set; }\n\n    [Option('b', \"body\", Required = true, HelpText = \"Email body.\")]\n    public string Body { get; set; }\n\n    [Option('a', \"attachment\", Required = false, HelpText = \"Attachment file path(s). Can be specified multiple times.\", Multiple = true)]\n    public IEnumerable<string> Attachments { get; set; }\n\n    [Option('m', \"smtpserver\", Required = true, HelpText = \"SMTP server address.\")]\n    public string SmtpServer { get; set; }\n\n    [Option('p', \"smtpport\", Required = true, HelpText = \"SMTP server port.\")]\n    public int SmtpPort { get; set; }\n\n    [Option('u', \"username\", Required = true, HelpText = \"SMTP username.\")]\n    public string Username { get; set; }\n\n    [Option('w', \"password\", Required = true, HelpText = \"SMTP password.\")]\n    public string Password { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\nIn the `Main` method, I'll use CommandLineParser to parse the args array into an instance of Options.\n\nThen, I'll set up the SmtpClient:\n\n```csharp\nvar smtpClient = new SmtpClient\n{\n    Host = options.SmtpServer,\n    Port = options.SmtpPort,\n    EnableSsl = true, // or based on configuration\n    Credentials = new NetworkCredential(options.Username, options.Password)\n};\n```\n\nCreate the MailMessage:\n\n```csharp\nvar mailMessage = new MailMessage\n{\n    From = new MailAddress(options.Username), // assuming username is the sender's email\n    Subject = options.Subject,\n    Body = options.Body,\n    IsBodyHtml = false // or true, depending on the content\n};\n\nmailMessage.To.Add(new MailAddress(options.Recipient));\n\nif (options.Attachments != null)\n{\n    foreach (var attachmentPath in options.Attachments)\n    {\n        if (File.Exists(attachmentPath))\n        {\n            mailMessage.Attachments.Add(new Attachment(attachmentPath));\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Warning: Attachment file not found: {attachmentPath}\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, send the email:\n\n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    smtpClient.Send(mailMessage);\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Email sent successfully.\");\n}\ncatch (Exception ex)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Failed to send email: {ex.Message}\");\n}\n```\n\nI should also consider disposing of the SmtpClient and MailMessage properly to release resources.\n\nMaybe wrap the sending logic in a method for better organization.\n\nLet me think about error handling. I need to handle cases where required arguments are missing, attachment files don't exist, SMTP server is unreachable, authentication fails, etc.\n\nI should provide meaningful error messages to the user.\n\nAlso, for security, I should avoid displaying passwords or sensitive information in error messages.\n\nLet me also consider that some SMTP servers require SSL, while others might not. Maybe I should add an option to specify whether to enable SSL.\n\nSimilarly, some SMTP servers use different authentication methods. But for simplicity, I'll assume standard login credentials.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make the enable SSL option configurable via a command line argument.\n\nAdd another option:\n\n```csharp\n[Option('e', \"enablessl\", DefaultValue = true, HelpText = \"Enable SSL for SMTP connection.\")]\npublic bool EnableSsl { get; set; }\n```\n\nThen set `smtpClient.EnableSsl = options.EnableSsl;`\n\nAlso, I need to handle the case where the SMTP port is not provided; maybe set a default port based on whether SSL is enabled.\n\nFor example, port 587 for TLS/STARTTLS, and 465 for SSL.\n\nBut since I'm making SMTP port a required argument, I'll assume the user provides the correct port for their server.\n\nNext, I need to ensure that the attachment paths are valid and exist before trying to add them to the email.\n\nI should also handle cases where the body is HTML by setting `IsBodyHtml` to true.\n\nMaybe add another option to specify if the body is HTML.\n\nAdd an option:\n\n```csharp\n[Option('h', \"isbodyhtml\", DefaultValue = false, HelpText = \"Set to true if the email body is HTML.\")]\npublic bool IsBodyHtml { get; set; }\n```\n\nThen set `mailMessage.IsBodyHtml = options.IsBodyHtml;`\n\nI should also consider character encoding, especially for non-English texts.\n\nSet the encoding for the subject and body.\n\n```csharp\nmailMessage.SubjectEncoding = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8;\nmailMessage.BodyEncoding = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8;\n```\n\nAdditionally, for the attachment filenames to display correctly in some email clients, I might need to set the ContentDisposition.\n\nBut Attachments.Add should handle that.\n\nLet me think about the from address. In the above code, I assumed that the username is the sender's email address. But sometimes, the username might be just a username without the domain.\n\nMaybe I should allow specifying the from address separately.\n\nAdd another option:\n\n```csharp\n[Option('f', \"from\", Required = true, HelpText = \"Sender email address.\")]\npublic string From { get; set; }\n```\n\nThen set `mailMessage.From = new MailAddress(options.From);`\n\nThis way, the user can specify a different from address if needed.\n\nWait, but often the SMTP server requires the from address to match the authenticated user.\n\nDepends on the server configuration.\n\nTo keep it flexible, I'll add the from address as a separate option.\n\nNow, about the recipient. Should I support multiple recipients?\n\nMaybe add another option for CC and BCC as well.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll stick with a single recipient for now.\n\nIf time permits, I can add support for multiple recipients.\n\nSimilarly, attachments can be multiple, as already handled.\n\nLet me list out all the options I plan to have:\n\n- Recipient (required)\n\n- Subject (required)\n\n- Body (required)\n\n- Attachments (optional, multiple)\n\n- SmtpServer (required)\n\n- SmtpPort (required)\n\n- Username (required)\n\n- Password (required)\n\n- EnableSsl (optional, default to true)\n\n- IsBodyHtml (optional, default to false)\n\n- From (optional, default to username)\n\nI should document these options and their usage.\n\nNow, for parsing the command line arguments, I'll use CommandLineParser.\n\nIn the `Main` method, I'll set up the parser and bind the arguments to the Options object.\n\nHandle any parsing errors and display help information if needed.\n\nI can also add a version option and other common CLI features.\n\nBut for now, keeping it minimal.\n\nLet me write some pseudocode for the `Main` method:\n\n```csharp\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        var parser = new CommandLine.Parser(config => config.HelpWriter = null);\n        var options = new Options();\n\n        if (parser.ParseArguments(args, options))\n        {\n            SendEmail(options);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            parser.WriteHelp(Console.Out);\n        }\n    }\n\n    static void SendEmail(Options options)\n    {\n        // Setup SmtpClient\n        // Create MailMessage\n        // Send email\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI need to make sure that all required options are provided before attempting to send the email.\n\nIn the Options class, I've marked the required options, so CommandLineParser should handle that.\n\nBut I should still add validation to ensure that the attachment files exist, and that the SMTP configuration is correct.\n\nAlso, I need to handle exceptions properly and provide useful error messages.\n\nLet me think about logging. For a console application, writing to Console.Error for errors and Console.Out for normal messages should suffice.\n\nI should also consider the exit codes. For example, exit with code 0 for success and non-zero for failures.\n\nIn .NET Core, I can return an integer from the `Main` method to specify the exit code.\n\nLet me modify the `Main` method to return an integer:\n\n```csharp\nstatic int Main(string[] args)\n{\n    var parser = new CommandLine.Parser(config => config.HelpWriter = null);\n    var options = new Options();\n\n    if (parser.ParseArguments(args, options))\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            SendEmail(options);\n            return 0;\n        }\n        catch (Exception ex)\n        {\n            Console.Error.WriteLine($\"Error: {ex.Message}\");\n            return 1;\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        parser.WriteHelp(Console.Out);\n        return 1;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, the SendEmail method can throw exceptions, which will be caught in Main, and an appropriate exit code will be returned.\n\nLet me outline the SendEmail method:\n\n1. Validate that required options are provided.\n\n2. Check if attachment files exist.\n\n3. Set up SmtpClient with the provided SMTP configuration.\n\n4. Create MailMessage with from, to, subject, body, and attachments.\n\n5. Send the email.\n\nI need to ensure that the SmtpClient is properly disposed of after use.\n\nMaybe wrap it in a using statement.\n\nSimilarly for MailMessage.\n\nWait, SmtpClient is not IDisposable, but MailMessage is.\n\nAccording to the documentation, SmtpClient implements IDisposable, so it should be disposed.\n\nWait, checking the documentation, SmtpClient does implement IDisposable in .NET Framework, but in .NET Core, it doesn't.\n\nWait, perhaps it's different in .NET Core.\n\nLet me check.\n\nLooking at the System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient class in .NET Core, it does not implement IDisposable.\n\nSo, no need to dispose it.\n\nBut MailMessage does implement IDisposable, so I should dispose it.\n\nTherefore, I'll wrap the MailMessage in a using statement.\n\nHere's a more detailed SendEmail method:\n\n```csharp\nstatic void SendEmail(Options options)\n{\n    // Validate required options\n    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(options.Recipient))\n    {\n        throw new ArgumentException(\"Recipient is required.\");\n    }\n    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(options.Subject))\n    {\n        throw new ArgumentException(\"Subject is required.\");\n    }\n    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(options.Body))\n    {\n        throw new ArgumentException(\"Body is required.\");\n    }\n    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(options.SmtpServer))\n    {\n        throw new ArgumentException(\"SMTP server is required.\");\n    }\n    if (options.SmtpPort == 0)\n    {\n        throw new ArgumentException(\"SMTP port is required.\");\n    }\n    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(options.Username))\n    {\n        throw new ArgumentException(\"Username is required.\");\n    }\n    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(options.Password))\n    {\n        throw new ArgumentException(\"Password is required.\");\n    }\n\n    // Validate attachment files\n    if (options.Attachments != null)\n    {\n        foreach (var attachmentPath in options.Attachments)\n        {\n            if (!File.Exists(attachmentPath))\n            {\n                throw new FileNotFoundException($\"Attachment file not found: {attachmentPath}\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Set up SmtpClient\n    var smtpClient = new SmtpClient\n    {\n        Host = options.SmtpServer,\n        Port = options.SmtpPort,\n        EnableSsl = options.EnableSsl,\n        Credentials = new NetworkCredential(options.Username, options.Password)\n    };\n\n    // Create MailMessage\n    using (var mailMessage = new MailMessage())\n    {\n        mailMessage.From = new MailAddress(string.IsNullOrEmpty(options.From) ? options.Username : options.From);\n        mailMessage.To.Add(new MailAddress(options.Recipient));\n        mailMessage.Subject = options.Subject;\n        mailMessage.Body = options.Body;\n        mailMessage.IsBodyHtml = options.IsBodyHtml;\n        mailMessage.SubjectEncoding = Encoding.UTF8;\n        mailMessage.BodyEncoding = Encoding.UTF8;\n\n        if (options.Attachments != null)\n        {\n            foreach (var attachmentPath in options.Attachments)\n            {\n                mailMessage.Attachments.Add(new Attachment(attachmentPath));\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Send the email\n        smtpClient.Send(mailMessage);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis should cover the basic functionality.\n\nI should also consider adding a timeout for the SMTP client to prevent the application from hanging indefinitely if the SMTP server is unreachable.\n\nI can set the `smtpClient.Timeout` property.\n\nLet's set it to, say, 30 seconds.\n\n```csharp\nsmtpClient.Timeout = 30000;\n```\n\nAdditionally, some SMTP servers require specific authentication mechanisms or have other requirements.\n\nBut for now, assuming standard login credentials will suffice.\n\nLet me think about localizing the error messages or the output.\n\nBut since this is a console application for administrative purposes, English should be sufficient.\n\nNow, to test this application, I'll need an SMTP server to send emails through.\n\nI can use Gmail's SMTP server for testing purposes, but I need to enable less secure apps or set up app-specific passwords.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a local SMTP server like MailHog for testing without actually sending emails.\n\nBut for the purpose of this task, I'll assume that the user provides a valid SMTP server configuration.\n\nI should also consider that some SMTP servers require authentication, while others might not.\n\nBut since I'm making username and password required options, I'll assume authentication is needed.\n\nLet me think about the from address again.\n\nIf the user doesn't provide a from address, I'll default to the username.\n\nBut in some cases, the username might not be a valid email address.\n\nMaybe I should require the from address to be provided explicitly.\n\nOtherwise, I might run into issues where the SMTP server rejects the email because the from address is invalid.\n\nTo be safe, I'll make the from address a required option.\n\nUpdate the Options class:\n\n```csharp\n[Option('f', \"from\", Required = true, HelpText = \"Sender email address.\")]\npublic string From { get; set; }\n```\n\nAnd update the MailMessage setup:\n\n```csharp\nmailMessage.From = new MailAddress(options.From);\n```\n\nNow, the user must provide a valid from address.\n\nNext, I should consider character encoding for the subject and body.\n\nI've set them to UTF-8, which should handle most international characters.\n\nBut I should ensure that the email client displaying the email can interpret UTF-8 correctly.\n\nMost modern email clients should support UTF-8.\n\nI can also set the Content-Transfer-Encoding for the body.\n\nBut MailMessage should handle that automatically when using UTF-8 encoding.\n\nLet me check if there's a way to set the Content-Transfer-Encoding explicitly.\n\nLooking at the documentation, it seems that setting the BodyEncoding to UTF-8 should suffice.\n\nNow, for attachments, I need to make sure that files are attached correctly.\n\nI should also handle large attachments efficiently without loading the entire file into memory.\n\nThe Attachment class in System.Net.Mail should handle streaming the file in chunks.\n\nBut I need to ensure that the application doesn't run out of memory with very large attachments.\n\nI can look into using StreamingAttachment or similar features if available.\n\nWait, in .NET Core, the Attachment class should handle large files efficiently.\n\nI'll assume that it does.\n\nIf issues arise, I can look into optimizing that part.\n\nLet me think about command line argument order.\n\nWith CommandLineParser, the order shouldn't matter as long as the options are specified correctly.\n\nBut I should provide clear usage instructions.\n\nMaybe add a version option and a help option.\n\nI can do that by configuring CommandLineParser.\n\nUpdate the parser configuration:\n\n```csharp\nvar parser = new CommandLine.Parser(config =>\n{\n    config.HelpWriter = Console.Out;\n    config.EnablePositionalParameters = false;\n    config.IgnoreUnknownArguments = false;\n});\n```\n\nThis way, help information can be displayed using a --help option.\n\nI should also define a version option.\n\nAdd a separate class for version information:\n\n```csharp\nclass VersionOptions\n{\n    [Option('v', \"version\", HelpText = \"Display version information.\")]\n    public bool Version { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\nThen, in the Main method, parse for version first, and if requested, display the version and exit.\n\nHere's an updated Main method:\n\n```csharp\nstatic int Main(string[] args)\n{\n    var parser = new CommandLine.Parser(config =>\n    {\n        config.HelpWriter = null;\n        config.EnablePositionalParameters = false;\n        config.IgnoreUnknownArguments = false;\n    });\n\n    var versionOptions = new VersionOptions();\n    if (parser.ParseArguments(args, versionOptions) && versionOptions.Version)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"EmailSender v1.0\");\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    var options = new Options();\n    if (parser.ParseArguments(args, options))\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            SendEmail(options);\n            return 0;\n        }\n        catch (Exception ex)\n        {\n            Console.Error.WriteLine($\"Error: {ex.Message}\");\n            return 1;\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        parser.WriteHelp(Console.Out);\n        return 1;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, if the user passes --version or -v, it will display the version and exit.\n\nI should also ensure that the help information is clear and lists all the options with their descriptions.\n\nMaybe I can customize the help text to include examples.\n\nI can do this by setting the Usage global option in CommandLineParser.\n\nUpdate the parser configuration:\n\n```csharp\nvar parser = new CommandLine.Parser(config =>\n{\n    config.HelpWriter = Console.Out;\n    config.EnablePositionalParameters = false;\n    config.IgnoreUnknownArguments = false;\n    config.WriteUsageOnCommandLineSyntaxError = true;\n    config.GlobalOptions.Add(new CommandOption(\"--version\", \"Display version information.\"));\n    config.SetUsage(\"dotnet run [OPTIONS]\");\n    config.SetHeader(\"EmailSender v1.0\");\n    config.SetFooter(\"Send email notifications with attachments using SMTP.\");\n});\n```\n\nThis will provide a more user-friendly help output.\n\nNow, regarding the SMTP configuration, I need to consider that some SMTP servers require specific settings, like authentication methods, SSL/TLS versions, etc.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll assume that the standard settings will work for most servers.\n\nIf needed, I can add more options for advanced configuration later.\n\nNext, I should think about logging or verbose output.\n\nMaybe add a --verbose option to display more detailed information about the sending process.\n\nAdd another option to Options class:\n\n```csharp\n[Option('v', \"verbose\", DefaultValue = false, HelpText = \"Enable verbose output.\")]\npublic bool Verbose { get; set; }\n```\n\nThen, in the SendEmail method, log additional information if verbose is true.\n\nFor example, display the SMTP server settings, the email content, etc.\n\nBut need to be careful not to log sensitive information like passwords.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```csharp\nif (options.Verbose)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Sending email via SMTP:\");\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Server: {options.SmtpServer}\");\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Port: {options.SmtpPort}\");\n    Console.WriteLine($\"From: {options.From}\");\n    Console.WriteLine($\"To: {options.Recipient}\");\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Subject: {options.Subject}\");\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Attachments:\");\n    if (options.Attachments != null)\n    {\n        foreach (var attachment in options.Attachments)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine($\"- {attachment}\");\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"None\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis way, the user can see what's being sent without exposing sensitive data.\n\nNow, to handle exceptions properly, I should catch specific exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.\n\nFor example, SmtpException for SMTP-specific errors, IOException for file attachment issues, etc.\n\nHere's an updated exception handling in the SendEmail method:\n\n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    // Send email logic\n}\ncatch (SmtpException ex)\n{\n    throw new InvalidOperationException(\"Failed to send email via SMTP.\", ex);\n}\ncatch (IOException ex)\n{\n    throw new InvalidOperationException(\"Error processing attachment file.\", ex);\n}\ncatch (Exception ex)\n{\n    throw new InvalidOperationException(\"An error occurred while sending the email.\", ex);\n}\n```\n\nThen, in the Main method, catch these exceptions and display the message.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that all the necessary namespaces are imported.\n\nAt the top of the Program.cs file, add:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Net;\nusing System.Net.Mail;\nusing System.Text;\nusing CommandLine;\n```\n\nI should also consider that in .NET Core, some email-related features might behave differently compared to .NET Framework.\n\nBut System.Net.Mail should work similarly.\n\nI need to test this application with different scenarios:\n\n1. Sending a plain text email without attachments.\n\n2. Sending an HTML email without attachments.\n\n3. Sending an email with one attachment.\n\n4. Sending an email with multiple attachments.\n\n5. Handling missing attachment files.\n\n6. Handling invalid SMTP server or port.\n\n7. Handling authentication failures.\n\n8. Verifying that non-ASCII characters are handled correctly.\n\nFor testing, I can set up a test SMTP server or use a service like MailHog.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a real SMTP server like Gmail's, but I need to handle app passwords and less secure app settings.\n\nI should also consider that some SMTP servers require TLS 1.2 or higher.\n\nIn .NET Core, the default TLS version should be acceptable, but if needed, I can force a specific TLS version.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume that the default settings work.\n\nLet me think about the from and reply-to addresses.\n\nCurrently, only from is set.\n\nIf needed, I can add support for reply-to address.\n\nBut for this task, I'll keep it simple with just from and to.\n\nNow, to make the application more user-friendly, I can provide a usage example in the help text.\n\nUpdate the parser configuration to include an example:\n\n```csharp\nconfig.SetUsage(@\"dotnet run [OPTIONS]\nExample:\n    dotnet run --recipient recipient@example.com --subject \"\"Test Email\"\" --body \"\"Hello, this is a test email.\"\" --attachment path/to/file1.txt --smtpserver smtp.example.com --smtpport 587 --username user@example.com --password secretpassword --from sender@example.com\");\n```\n\nThis will give users a clear idea of how to use the application.\n\nI should also ensure that the attachment paths are handled correctly, considering different operating systems' path formats.\n\nIn .NET Core, Path.Combine can be used to handle paths in a cross-platform way.\n\nBut since attachment paths are provided by the user, I need to accept them as is and handle any discrepancies.\n\nPerhaps, for Windows, allow both '/' and '\\' in paths.\n\nIn any case, File.Exists should handle the paths appropriately based on the OS.\n\nLet me think about internationalized domain names or email addresses.\n\nI need to ensure that email addresses with non-ASCII characters are handled correctly.\n\nAccording to RFC 6531, internationalized email addresses should be encoded using UTF-8.\n\nMailAddress class in .NET should handle this appropriately.\n\nI can test this by providing email addresses with non-ASCII characters and see if they are encoded correctly in the email headers.\n\nNow, about the subject and body encodings.\n\nI've set them to UTF-8, which should handle international characters.\n\nBut I need to ensure that the email client displays them correctly.\n\nAlso, for subjects with non-ASCII characters, they need to be encoded properly.\n\nMailMessage should handle this automatically when using UTF-8 encoding.\n\nI can verify this by sending a test email with non-ASCII characters in the subject and body.\n\nNext, I should consider that some email clients might interpret plain text emails differently.\n\nIf the body is HTML, setting IsBodyHtml to true is crucial.\n\nOtherwise, the email client might display the HTML tags as plain text.\n\nI should make sure that the user specifies whether the body is HTML or plain text.\n\nMaybe add a note in the help text reminding users to set --isbodyhtml=true for HTML emails.\n\nNow, for attachments, I need to ensure that the file names are correctly displayed in the email, especially if they contain non-ASCII characters.\n\nIn .NET Core, Attachment class should handle this correctly by setting the ContentDisposition header appropriately.\n\nI can test this by attaching files with non-ASCII names and checking how they appear in the received email.\n\nI should also consider that some email servers have size limits for emails or attachments.\n\nBut there's not much I can do about that from the client side, except inform the user if the email fails to send due to size constraints.\n\nLet me think about error handling when sending the email.\n\nIf the SMTP server is unreachable, SmtpException will be thrown with an appropriate error message.\n\nIf authentication fails, similar exception will be raised.\n\nI need to catch these exceptions and provide a user-friendly error message.\n\nAlso, log the exception details in verbose mode for debugging purposes.\n\nUpdate the exception handling in Main:\n\n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    SendEmail(options);\n    return 0;\n}\ncatch (Exception ex)\n{\n    Console.Error.WriteLine($\"Error: {ex.Message}\");\n    if (options.Verbose)\n    {\n        Console.Error.WriteLine(ex.StackTrace);\n    }\n    return 1;\n}\n```\n\nThis way, in verbose mode, the stack trace is displayed, which can help in debugging.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the application doesn't hang indefinitely if the SMTP server doesn't respond.\n\nI've already set the Timeout property on SmtpClient to 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).\n\nThis should prevent the application from hanging for too long.\n\nBut I should test this to confirm.\n\nI can simulate a slow or non-responsive SMTP server and see if the application times out as expected.\n\nNext, I should consider that some SMTP servers require starting TLS, even if the connection is made on port 25.\n\nBut this is a complex scenario, and for now, I'll assume that the user provides the correct port and SSL settings for their SMTP server.\n\nNow, to make the application more robust, I can add more validation checks.\n\nFor example, validate that the email addresses are in correct format.\n\nI can use the MailAddress constructor, which validates the email address format.\n\nIf an invalid address is provided, it will throw an FormatException.\n\nSo, I can catch those exceptions and provide appropriate error messages.\n\nUpdate the SendEmail method to validate email addresses:\n\n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    var fromAddress = new MailAddress(options.From);\n    var toAddress = new MailAddress(options.Recipient);\n}\ncatch (FormatException ex)\n{\n    throw new ArgumentException(\"Invalid email address format.\", ex);\n}\n```\n\nThis way, invalid email addresses are caught early.\n\nI should also validate that the SMTP port is within the valid range (0-65535).\n\nAdd a check:\n\n```csharp\nif (options.SmtpPort < 0 || options.SmtpPort > 65535)\n{\n    throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(options.SmtpPort), \"SMTP port must be between 0 and 65535.\");\n}\n```\n\nNow, considering that the application handles sensitive information like passwords, I need to ensure that it doesn't log or display them accidentally.\n\nI've already avoided including passwords in error messages, but I should double-check that no sensitive information is exposed.\n\nAlso, when using verbose mode, make sure that passwords or other sensitive options are not displayed.\n\nIn the verbose output, I've only included server, port, from, to, subject, and attachment paths, which should be safe.\n\nNow, I need to think about how to package and distribute this application.\n\nSince it's a .NET Core console application, it can be published as a self-contained deployment for different platforms.\n\nI can create separate publish profiles for Windows, Linux, and macOS.\n\nThis way, users on different operating systems can run the application.\n\nI should also provide installation instructions and usage examples in a README file.\n\nFor the README, I can include:\n\n- Description of the application\n\n- Installation prerequisites (dotnet runtime)\n\n- How to run the application\n\n- List of command line options with examples\n\n- Contact information or link to documentation\n\nI can host the source code on a version control platform like GitHub and provide releases with compiled binaries.\n\nBut since this is a simple console application, users can also clone the repository and run it locally using dotnet run.\n\nNow, to test the application, I'll need to create a test SMTP server or use an existing one.\n\nI can use Gmail's SMTP server for testing, but I need to configure Less secure app access or use App Passwords if two-factor authentication is enabled.\n\nAlternatively, I can set up a local SMTP server like MailHog, which captures emails without sending them out, for testing purposes.\n\nI'll need to install MailHog and configure the application to use localhost as the SMTP server.\n\nOnce I have the SMTP server set up, I can run the application with sample arguments to verify that emails are sent correctly.\n\nI should also test edge cases, such as:\n\n- Missing required arguments\n\n- Invalid email addresses\n\n- Non-existent attachment files\n\n- Incorrect SMTP server or port\n\n- Authentication failures\n\n- Large attachments\n\nFor each of these cases, I need to ensure that the application handles them gracefully and provides useful error messages.\n\nI can write unit tests for the argument parsing and email sending logic, but since System.Net.Mail might have dependencies on actual SMTP servers, integration tests would be more appropriate for testing email sending functionality.\n\nFor unit testing, I can mock the SmtpClient to verify that it's configured correctly and that the Send method is called with the right parameters.\n\nBut for this task, I'll focus on manual testing.\n\nNow, I need to consider if there are any dependencies besides .NET Core and CommandLineParser.\n\nI've already added CommandLineParser via NuGet.\n\nI should check if there are any other dependencies required for email sending.\n\nSystem.Net.Mail is part of the .NET Core framework, so no additional packages are needed.\n\nI can confirm this by checking the project file (EmailSender.csproj).\n\nIt should only have the CommandLineParser package reference.\n\nNow, let's think about localizing the application.\n\nBut since it's a command line tool for sending emails, and the target audience is likely technically inclined, using English should be sufficient.\n\nI'll keep all messages and help texts in English.\n\nNext, I should consider adding a license to the project.\n\nI can choose an open-source license, like MIT or Apache 2.0, depending on the intended use.\n\nI'll add a LICENSE file to the repository with the chosen license text.\n\nNow, I need to write the actual code based on the outline I've created.\n\nI'll start by creating the Options class with all the required and optional parameters.\n\nThen, set up the parser in the Main method to parse the arguments and handle version and help options.\n\nAfter that, implement the SendEmail method with all the validation and email sending logic.\n\nFinally, test the application with different scenarios to ensure it works as expected.\n\nI should also consider writing a README file with usage instructions and examples.\n\nOnce everything is working, I can publish the application as a release with compiled binaries for different platforms.\n\nBut for now, I'll focus on implementing and testing the core functionality.\n\nAlright, let's start coding.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a C# .NET Core console application that sends email notifications with attachments using SMTP and accepts command line arguments, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Project\nCreate a new .NET Core console project:\n```bash\ndotnet new console -n EmailSender\ncd EmailSender\n```\n\n### Step 2: Install Required Packages\nInstall the `CommandLineParser` package for handling command line arguments:\n```bash\ndotnet add package CommandLineParser\n```\n\n### Step 3: Define Options Classes\nDefine the options class to bind command line arguments:\n```csharp\nusing CommandLine;\n\npublic class Options\n{\n    [Option('r', \"recipient\", Required = true, HelpText = \"Recipient email address.\")]\n    public string Recipient { get; set; }\n\n    [Option('s', \"subject\", Required = true, HelpText = \"Email subject.\")]\n    public string Subject { get; set; }\n\n    [Option('b', \"body\", Required = true, HelpText = \"Email body.\")]\n    public string Body { get; set; }\n\n    [Option('a', \"attachment\", Required = false, HelpText = \"Attachment file path(s). Can be specified multiple times.\", Multiple = true)]\n    public IEnumerable<string> Attachments { get; set; }\n\n    [Option('m', \"smtpserver\", Required = true, HelpText = \"SMTP server address.\")]\n    public string SmtpServer { get; set; }\n\n    [Option('p', \"smtpport\", Required = true, HelpText = \"SMTP server port.\")]\n    public int SmtpPort { get; set; }\n\n    [Option('u', \"username\", Required = true, HelpText = \"SMTP username.\")]\n    public string Username { get; set; }\n\n    [Option('w', \"password\", Required = true, HelpText = \"SMTP password.\")]\n    public string Password { get; set; }\n\n    [Option('e', \"enablessl\", DefaultValue = true, HelpText = \"Enable SSL for SMTP connection.\")]\n    public bool EnableSsl { get; set; }\n\n    [Option('h', \"isbodyhtml\", DefaultValue = false, HelpText = \"Set to true if the email body is HTML.\")]\n    public bool IsBodyHtml { get; set; }\n\n    [Option('f', \"from\", Required = true, HelpText = \"Sender email address.\")]\n    public string From { get; set; }\n\n    [Option('v', \"verbose\", DefaultValue = false, HelpText = \"Enable verbose output.\")]\n    public bool Verbose { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class VersionOptions\n{\n    [Option('v', \"version\", HelpText = \"Display version information.\")]\n    public bool Version { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Implement the Main Method\nSet up the parser and handle command line arguments:\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Net;\nusing System.Net.Mail;\nusing System.Text;\nusing CommandLine;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static int Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        var parser = new Parser(config =>\n        {\n            config.HelpWriter = null;\n            config.EnablePositionalParameters = false;\n            config.IgnoreUnknownArguments = false;\n            config.WriteUsageOnCommandLineSyntaxError = true;\n            config.GlobalOptions.Add(new CommandOption(\"--version\", \"Display version information.\"));\n            config.SetUsage(\"dotnet run [OPTIONS]\");\n            config.SetHeader(\"EmailSender v1.0\");\n            config.SetFooter(\"Send email notifications with attachments using SMTP.\");\n        });\n\n        var versionOptions = new VersionOptions();\n        if (parser.ParseArguments(args, versionOptions) && versionOptions.Version)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"EmailSender v1.0\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        var options = new Options();\n        if (parser.ParseArguments(args, options))\n        {\n            try\n            {\n                SendEmail(options);\n                return 0;\n            }\n            catch (Exception ex)\n            {\n                Console.Error.WriteLine($\"Error: {ex.Message}\");\n                if (options.Verbose)\n                {\n                    Console.Error.WriteLine(ex.StackTrace);\n                }\n                return 1;\n            }\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            parser.WriteHelp(Console.Out);\n            return 1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    static void SendEmail(Options options)\n    {\n        // Validate required options\n        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(options.Recipient))\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Recipient is required.\");\n        }\n        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(options.Subject))\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Subject is required.\");\n        }\n        if

  throw new ArgumentException(\"SMTP server is required.\");\n        }\n        if (options.SmtpPort == 0)\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"SMTP port is required.\");\n        }\n        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(options.Username))\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Username is required.\");\n        }\n        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(options.Password))\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Password is required.\");\n        }\n        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(options.From))\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"From address is required.\");\n        }\n\n        // Validate email addresses\n        try\n        {\n            var fromAddress = new MailAddress(options.From);\n            var toAddress = new MailAddress(options.Recipient);\n        }\n        catch (FormatException ex)\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Invalid email address format.\", ex);\n        }\n\n        // Validate attachment files\n        if (options.Attachments != null)\n        {\n            foreach (var attachmentPath in options.Attachments)\n            {\n                if

options.EnableSsl,\n            Credentials = new NetworkCredential(options.Username, options.Password),\n            Timeout = 30000 // 30 seconds\n        };\n\n        // Create MailMessage\n        using (var mailMessage = new MailMessage())\n        {\n            mailMessage.From = new MailAddress(options.From);\n            mailMessage.To.Add(new MailAddress(options.Recipient));\n
