        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train traveling from City A to City B. It takes 3 hours at a constant speed, and if the speed is increased by 20 km/h, it would take only 2 hours to cover the same distance. We need to find the original speed of the train.\n\nFirst, let's recall the basic formula that relates distance, speed, and time:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} \\]\n\nLet's denote the original speed of the train as \\( v \\) km/h.\n\nGiven that the train takes 3 hours to travel from City A to City B at this speed, the distance between the two cities can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = v \\times 3 \\]\n\nNow, if the speed is increased by 20 km/h, the new speed becomes \\( v + 20 \\) km/h, and the time taken to cover the same distance is 2 hours. So, the distance can also be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = (v + 20) \\times 2 \\]\n\nSince both expressions represent the same distance, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n\\[ v \\times 3 = (v + 20) \\times 2 \\]\n\nNow, we have an equation in terms of \\( v \\), which we can solve to find the original speed.\n\nLet's expand both sides of the equation:\n\nLeft side:\n\n\\[ v \\times 3 = 3v \\]\n\nRight side:\n\n\\[ (v + 20) \\times 2 = 2v + 40 \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 3v = 2v + 40 \\]\n\nNow, let's isolate \\( v \\) by subtracting \\( 2v \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 3v - 2v = 2v + 40 - 2v \\]\n\n\\[ v = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, the original speed of the train is 40 km/h.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check this result to make sure it makes sense. If the original speed is 40 km/h and the time taken is 3 hours, the distance between City A and City B would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 40 \\times 3 = 120 \\text{ km} \\]\n\nNow, if the speed is increased by 20 km/h, the new speed is:\n\n\\[ 40 + 20 = 60 \\text{ km/h} \\]\n\nAnd the time taken at this new speed is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{120}{60} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThis matches the information given in the problem, so our solution seems to be correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can approach this problem using the concept of inverse proportionality between speed and time for a constant distance. Since distance is constant, speed and time are inversely proportional. This means that:\n\n\\[ v_1 \\times t_1 = v_2 \\times t_2 \\]\n\nGiven that \\( v_2 = v_1 + 20 \\) and \\( t_2 = 2 \\) hours, and \\( t_1 = 3 \\) hours, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ v_1 \\times 3 = (v_1 + 20) \\times 2 \\]\n\nThis is the same equation we had before, which again confirms our solution.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the relationship between the speed increase and the time decrease. The train saves 1 hour by increasing its speed by 20 km/h. We can use the formula for average speed or consider the difference in speeds and times, but that might complicate things unnecessarily when the direct approach works fine.\n\nIn summary, the original speed of the train is 40 km/h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40 \\text{ km/h}} \\]"
