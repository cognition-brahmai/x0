        "content": "So, there are 8 planets in the solar system, and each planet has 4 moons. We need to find out the total number of celestial bodies, considering only planets and their moons.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many moons there are in total. If each of the 8 planets has 4 moons, then the total number of moons would be:\n\n8 planets * 4 moons per planet = 32 moons\n\nNow, we have 8 planets and 32 moons. To find the total number of celestial bodies, we just need to add these two numbers together:\n\n8 planets + 32 moons = 40 celestial bodies\n\nSo, there are 40 celestial bodies in the solar system, considering only planets and their moons.\n\nWait a minute, but in reality, the solar system has more than that. For example, there are dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and other smaller bodies. But according to the question, we're only counting planets and their moons.\n\nJust to make sure, let's double-check the calculation. If each planet has 4 moons, and there are 8 planets, then the total number of moons is indeed 32. Adding the 8 planets gives us 40 celestial bodies.\n\nI think that's correct. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
