        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a cylindrical water tank. It's 10 feet tall and has a diameter of 6 feet. I need to figure out how many gallons of water it can hold, and I'm told that one gallon is equal to 231 cubic inches. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find the volume of the cylinder because that will tell me how much space is inside the tank, which corresponds to how much water it can hold. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height. Okay, so I have the height, which is 10 feet, and the diameter is 6 feet. Remember, the radius is half of the diameter, so the radius would be 3 feet.\n\nWait a minute, but the formula is in cubic feet, and the gallon conversion is given in cubic inches. Hmm, I think I need to make sure that all my units are consistent here. So, I need to decide whether to work in feet or inches.\n\nSince the final answer needs to be in gallons and one gallon is 231 cubic inches, it might be easier to convert all measurements to inches. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:\n\n\\[ h = 10 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 120 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nSimilarly, the diameter is 6 feet, so:\n\n\\[ d = 6 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 72 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nTherefore, the radius is half of that:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{72 \\text{ inches}}{2} = 36 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNow, plug these values into the volume formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi \\times (36 \\text{ inches})^2 \\times 120 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nLet me calculate that. First, square the radius:\n\n\\[ (36)^2 = 1296 \\]\n\nThen multiply by pi (I'll use 3.1416 for pi):\n\n\\[ 1296 \\times 3.1416 \\approx 4071.504 \\]\n\nNow, multiply by the height:\n\n\\[ 4071.504 \\times 120 \\approx 488580.48 \\text{ cubic inches} \\]\n\nAlright, so the volume of the tank is approximately 488,580.48 cubic inches.\n\nNow, I need to convert that to gallons, given that 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches.\n\nSo, the number of gallons is:\n\n\\[ \\text{gallons} = \\frac{488580.48 \\text{ cubic inches}}{231 \\text{ cubic inches/gallon}} \\]\n\nLet me do that division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{488580.48}{231} \\approx 2115.067 \\]\n\nSo, the tank can hold approximately 2115.067 gallons of water.\n\nWait a second, does that make sense? Let's double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, converting the dimensions from feet to inches:\n\nHeight: 10 feet \u00d7 12 = 120 inches \u2714\ufe0f\n\nDiameter: 6 feet \u00d7 12 = 72 inches \u2714\ufe0f\n\nRadius: 72 inches \u00f7 2 = 36 inches \u2714\ufe0f\n\nVolume calculation:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h = 3.1416 \\times (36)^2 \\times 120 \\]\n\n\\[ (36)^2 = 1296 \u2714\ufe0f \\]\n\n\\[ 1296 \u00d7 3.1416 \u2248 4071.504 \u2714\ufe0f \\]\n\n\\[ 4071.504 \u00d7 120 = 488580.48 \\text{ cubic inches} \u2714\ufe0f \\]\n\nNow, converting to gallons:\n\n\\[ \\frac{488580.48}{231} \u2248 2115.067 \\text{ gallons} \u2714\ufe0f \\]\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider the precision of pi. I used 3.1416, but maybe a more precise value would be better.\n\nLet's try with pi \u2248 3.1415926535.\n\n\\[ V = 3.1415926535 \u00d7 1296 \u00d7 120 \\]\n\nFirst, 3.1415926535 \u00d7 1296 \u2248 4071.504079\n\nThen, 4071.504079 \u00d7 120 \u2248 488580.4895 cubic inches\n\nNow, dividing by 231:\n\n\\[ \\frac{488580.4895}{231} \u2248 2115.06705 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nIt's virtually the same as before. So, my original calculation was accurate enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this differently. Perhaps there's a formula to directly convert cubic feet to gallons, but since I have cubic inches, it's probably fine.\n\nWait, actually, I know that 1 cubic foot equals about 7.48052 gallons. Maybe I can convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons directly, which might be easier.\n\nLet me try that. First, find the volume in cubic feet, then convert to gallons.\n\nSo, the volume in cubic feet:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nBut with r in feet and h in feet. The radius is 3 feet, height is 10 feet.\n\n\\[ V = 3.1416 \\times (3)^2 \\times 10 \\]\n\n\\[ (3)^2 = 9 \\]\n\n\\[ 9 \u00d7 3.1416 \u2248 28.2744 \\]\n\n\\[ 28.2744 \u00d7 10 = 282.744 \\text{ cubic feet} \\]\n\nNow, convert cubic feet to gallons. As I recall, 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48052 gallons.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\text{gallons} = 282.744 \u00d7 7.48052 \\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 282.744 \u00d7 7.48052.\n\nWell, 282.744 \u00d7 7 = 1979.208\n\n282.744 \u00d7 0.48052 \u2248 135.84 (rough estimation)\n\nSo, total approximately 1979.208 + 135.84 \u2248 2115.048 gallons\n\nWhich matches my previous calculation of 2115.067 gallons. So, that gives me confidence that my answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, for a more precise calculation, using \u03c0 instead of 3.1416.\n\n\\[ V = \\pi \\times (3)^2 \\times 10 = \\pi \\times 9 \\times 10 = 90\\pi \\text{ cubic feet} \\]\n\nThen, gallons:\n\n\\[ \\text{gallons} = 90\\pi \\times 7.48052 \\approx 90 \\times 3.1415926535 \\times 7.48052 \\]\n\n\\[ 90 \\times 3.1415926535 \u2248 282.7433388 \\]\n\n\\[ 282.7433388 \u00d7 7.48052 \u2248 2115.052 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I end up with approximately 2115.06 gallons.\n\nTherefore, the tank can hold about 2115.06 gallons of water.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like the thickness of the tank walls or if the tank has any irregular shapes. But based on the information given, it's a standard cylindrical tank, so I think this calculation is sufficient.\n\nAlso, I should check if the conversion factors are accurate. I know that 1 gallon is exactly 231 cubic inches, and 1 cubic foot is exactly 12 inches \u00d7 12 inches \u00d7 12 inches = 1728 cubic inches.\n\nAnd, 1 cubic foot is indeed equal to 7.48052 gallons, since 1728 cubic inches \u00f7 231 cubic inches/gallon \u2248 7.48052 gallons per cubic foot.\n\nSo, my conversion is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is approximately 2115.06 gallons.\n\nBut in practical terms, tanks are often not filled to the brim, but for this problem, I think the question is just asking for the total capacity.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nThe cylindrical water tank has a height of 10 feet and a diameter of 6 feet. Converting these dimensions to inches gives a height of 120 inches and a radius of 36 inches. The volume of the cylinder is calculated as V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, which equals approximately 488,580.48 cubic inches. Given that one gallon equals 231 cubic inches, the tank can hold about 2,115.06 gallons of water.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2115.06} \\]"
