        "content": "In political science, the concept of \"Realism\" in international relations primarily emphasizes the inherent anarchic nature of the international system and the pursuit of power. This school of thought suggests that states are the primary actors in an international system without a central authority, leading them to prioritize their own security and power above all else. Realists believe that the international system is characterized by competition and conflict, and that states must be prepared to protect their own interests through military strength and strategic alliances. This perspective contrasts with other theories that emphasize the role of international institutions, cooperation, individual ideas, or economic factors in shaping global politics."
