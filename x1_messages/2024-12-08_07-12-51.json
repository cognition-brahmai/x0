        "content": "Implementing a Huffman coding algorithm in Python involves several steps: calculating the frequency of each character in the input string, building a Huffman tree based on these frequencies, generating the Huffman codes for each character, encoding the input string into binary using these codes, and constructing the decoding tree for later use in decoding the binary back to the original string.\n\nBelow is a step-by-step implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, char, freq):\n        self.char = char\n        self.freq = freq\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n\n    def __lt__(self, other):\n        return self.freq < other.freq\n\ndef calculate_frequency(input_string):\n    frequency = defaultdict(int)\n    for char in input_string:\n        frequency[char] += 1\n    return frequency\n\ndef build_huffman_tree(frequency):\n    priority_queue = [Node(char, freq) for char, freq in frequency.items()]\n    heapq.heapify(priority_queue)\n    \n    while len(priority_queue) > 1:\n        left = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)\n        right = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)\n        merged = Node(None, left.freq + right.freq)\n        merged.left = left\n        merged.right = right\n        heapq.heappush(priority_queue, merged)\n    \n    return priority_queue[0]  # The root of the Huffman tree\n\ndef generate_huffman_codes(node, current_code=\"\", code_book={}):\n    if node is None:\n        return\n    if node.char is not None:\n        code_book[node.char] = current_code\n    generate_huffman_codes(node.left, current_code + \"0\", code_book)\n    generate_huffman_codes(node.right, current_code + \"1\", code_book)\n    return code_book\n\ndef encode_string(input_string, code_book):\n    encoded_string = \"\"\n    for char in input_string:\n        encoded_string += code_book[char]\n    return encoded_string\n\ndef main():\n    input_string = \"this is an example for huffman encoding\"\n    \n    frequency = calculate_frequency(input_string)\n    root = build_huffman_tree(frequency)\n    code_book = generate_huffman_codes(root)\n    \n    encoded_string = encode_string(input_string, code_book)\n    print(\"Encoded string:\", encoded_string)\n    \n    # To decode, you would need the decoding tree (the Huffman tree)\n    # Here, 'root' is the root of the Huffman tree, which can be used for decoding\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Frequency Calculation:**\n   - We use a `defaultdict` to count the frequency of each character in the input string.\n\n2. **Huffman Tree Building:**\n   - We create a priority queue (min-heap) of nodes, where each node represents a character and its frequency.\n   - We repeatedly merge the two nodes with the smallest frequencies into a new node until only one node remains, which is the root of the Huffman tree.\n\n3. **Code Generation:**\n   - We traverse the Huffman tree to generate binary codes for each character. Moving left on the tree appends '0' to the code, and moving right appends '1'.\n\n4. **Encoding:**\n   - We replace each character in the input string with its corresponding Huffman code to get the encoded binary string.\n\n5. **Decoding Tree:**\n   - The Huffman tree (specifically, the root of the tree) is used for decoding the binary string back to the original string. This tree structure is essential for correctly interpreting the binary codes during decoding.\n\nThis implementation provides a basic framework for Huffman coding. For a complete solution, you might want to add decoding functionality and handle edge cases, such as inputs with only one unique character."
