        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a town with houses on both sides of the street: 10 houses on one side and 15 on the other, making a total of 25 houses. Each house has an even number of occupants, and the total number of occupants in all houses combined is 100. We need to find the minimum number of occupants in any one house.\n\nFirst, since each house has an even number of occupants, possible numbers of occupants per house could be 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on. We can't have 0 occupants because that would mean the house isn't inhabited, and the problem implies that all houses have occupants.\n\nOur goal is to minimize the number of occupants in one house, which means we should try to maximize the number of occupants in the other houses. However, since we're dealing with even numbers, we need to ensure that all counts remain even.\n\nLet's assume that most houses have the maximum possible occupants, and only one house has the minimum. But since we don't know the maximum limit, we might need to consider different scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this. Let's think about the total number of occupants: 100. If all 25 houses had the same number of occupants, then each house would have 100 / 25 = 4 occupants. But since the number of occupants must be even, 4 is a possible number.\n\nHowever, we need to find the minimum number in any one house, so maybe some houses have fewer than 4 occupants.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that some houses have fewer occupants, which would require others to have more to make up the total of 100.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of occupants in the houses as x1, x2, ..., x25, where each xi is an even number.\n\nWe need to minimize min(xi), given that the sum of all xi is 100.\n\nTo minimize one xi, we should maximize the other xi's, but since all xi are even, the maximum each can be is... well, theoretically, there's no upper limit, but in practice, we need to distribute the total in such a way that one is as small as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of averages.\n\nLet\u2019s try to set as many houses as possible to the highest even number that doesn\u2019t exceed the average, but since there's no upper limit, we might need another strategy.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can think of it this way: to minimize one house, set it to the smallest possible even number, which is 2, and see if the remaining houses can accommodate the remaining occupants.\n\nSo, if one house has 2 occupants, the remaining 24 houses must have a total of 100 - 2 = 98 occupants.\n\nNow, if each of these 24 houses has at least 2 occupants, that would account for 24 * 2 = 48 occupants.\n\nThis leaves 98 - 48 = 50 occupants to be distributed among the 24 houses.\n\nNow, to minimize one house, we've already set it to 2, and we've distributed at least 2 to each of the others, leaving 50 occupants to be distributed among 24 houses.\n\nBut since we're dealing with even numbers, any additional occupants must be added in even numbers.\n\nSo, we can add 0, 2, 4, etc., to each house.\n\nOur goal is to see if it's possible to distribute these 50 additional occupants among the 24 houses, keeping the numbers even.\n\nFirst, note that 50 is an even number, which is good because we're adding even numbers.\n\nIf we add 2 to one house, that makes it have 4 occupants, and so on.\n\nBut we need to see if distributing 50 additional occupants among 24 houses is feasible.\n\nWait, actually, since we've already allocated 2 to each of the 24 houses, making a total of 48, and we have 50 to distribute, we can think of it as allocating 50 in units of 2 to these 24 houses.\n\nIn other words, we can think of distributing 25 units of 2 among 24 houses.\n\nBut 25 units among 24 houses means that at least one house will get an extra 2.\n\nWait, no. If we have 25 units to distribute among 24 houses, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least one house will get at least ceil(25/24) units, which is 2 units (since 25 divided by 24 is 1 with a remainder of 1, but since we can't split units, it's 2).\n\nWait, actually, if we distribute 24 units to 24 houses, each getting one unit of 2, that accounts for 48 + 24*2 = 48 + 48 = 96 occupants.\n\nBut we have 100 - 2 = 98 to distribute, so we have 98 - 48 = 50 to distribute.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose we set one house to have 2 occupants, the minimum even number.\n\nThen, the remaining 24 houses must have a total of 98 occupants.\n\nSince each of these 24 houses must have at least 2 occupants, we've already allocated 2 to each, totaling 48 occupants.\n\nThis leaves 98 - 48 = 50 occupants to be distributed among the 24 houses in increments of 2.\n\nSo, we need to distribute 50 in units of 2 among 24 houses.\n\n50 divided by 2 is 25 units to distribute.\n\nSo, we can distribute 25 units among 24 houses.\n\nThis means that at least one house will receive an extra 2 beyond the initial 2, making it have 4 occupants.\n\nBut actually, since 25 is greater than 24, one house will receive two extra units of 2, making it have 6 occupants.\n\nWait, no.\n\nLet me think carefully.\n\nWe have 24 houses, and we have 25 units of 2 to distribute.\n\nIf we give one unit to each house, that's 24 units, leaving one unit remaining.\n\nThis remaining unit must be assigned to one of the houses, making that house receive two units, for a total of 4 extra occupants beyond the initial 2.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, each unit is 2 occupants.\n\nSo, assigning one unit to each of the 24 houses adds 2 to each, making each of these houses have 4 occupants.\n\nThen, with one unit left, we assign it to one of the houses, making that house have 6 occupants.\n\nSo, in this scenario, we have one house with 2 occupants, 23 houses with 4 occupants, and one house with 6 occupants.\n\nLet's check the total:\n\n1 house * 2 + 23 houses * 4 + 1 house * 6 = 2 + 92 + 6 = 100.\n\nPerfect, that adds up to 100.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimum number of occupants in any one house is 2.\n\nBut is this the absolute minimum? Can we have a house with fewer than 2 occupants?\n\nWait, but the problem states that each house has an even number of occupants, and 0 is even, but it's implied that houses have occupants, so 0 isn't allowed.\n\nTherefore, 2 is the smallest possible even number of occupants for a house.\n\nHence, the minimum number of occupants in any one house is 2.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's a way to have a house with more occupants to allow another house to have fewer than 2.\n\nWait, but since 2 is the smallest even number greater than 0, and 0 isn't allowed, 2 is indeed the minimum.\n\nSo, the answer should be 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
