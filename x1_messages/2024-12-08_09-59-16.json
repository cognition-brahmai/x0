        "content": "So Mike is currently 11 years old, and his sister Sarah is twice as old as he is. That means Sarah is 22 years old right now, right? Because twice 11 is 22.\n\nNow, the question is, when Mike is 50 years old, how old will Sarah be?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the age difference between Mike and Sarah. Since Mike is 11 and Sarah is 22, the difference in their ages is 22 - 11 = 11 years. So Sarah is 11 years older than Mike.\n\nSince their age difference will always remain the same, no matter how old they get, Sarah will always be 11 years older than Mike.\n\nTherefore, when Mike is 50 years old, Sarah will be 50 + 11 = 61 years old.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how many years it will take for Mike to reach 50 from his current age of 11. That would be 50 - 11 = 39 years.\n\nSo, in 39 years, Mike will be 50. Therefore, Sarah, who is currently 22, will be 22 + 39 = 61 years old at that time.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, Sarah will be 61 years old when Mike is 50.\n\nBut let me consider another approach to ensure I'm not missing anything.\n\nSuppose I use algebra. Let\u2019s denote Mike\u2019s current age as M and Sarah\u2019s current age as S.\n\nGiven that M = 11 and S = 2 * M = 22.\n\nNow, let\u2019s say after X years, Mike will be 50 years old. So, M + X = 50.\n\nSubstituting M = 11, we get 11 + X = 50 \u21d2 X = 50 - 11 = 39 years.\n\nTherefore, Sarah\u2019s age after X years will be S + X = 22 + 39 = 61 years old.\n\nAlternatively, since Sarah is always older than Mike by 11 years, her age when Mike is 50 is simply 50 + 11 = 61.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion: Sarah will be 61 years old when Mike is 50.\n\nI think that makes sense. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any trick in the question, so the answer should be straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{61} \\]"
