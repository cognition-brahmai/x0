        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got 120 students in grade 8 and 140 students in grade 9. That means, altogether, there are 120 + 140 = 260 students in both grades.\n\nNow, 60% of grade 8 students passed the exam, and 70% of grade 9 students passed. To find out how many students passed in each grade, I need to calculate 60% of 120 and 70% of 140, and then add those numbers together to get the total number of students who passed.\n\nFirst, let's find 60% of 120. Percentage means per hundred, so 60% is like 60 per 100, or 60/100, which is 0.6 in decimal form. So, 0.6 times 120 should give us the number of grade 8 students who passed.\n\n0.6 \u00d7 120 = 72\n\nSo, 72 grade 8 students passed the exam.\n\nNext, let's find 70% of 140. Similarly, 70% is 70 per 100, or 70/100, which is 0.7 in decimal form. So, 0.7 times 140 should give us the number of grade 9 students who passed.\n\n0.7 \u00d7 140 = 98\n\nSo, 98 grade 9 students passed the exam.\n\nNow, to find the total number of students who passed, we add the number of passers from both grades:\n\n72 + 98 = 170\n\nTherefore, 170 students passed the exam in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the beginning:\n\n- There are 120 grade 8 students and 140 grade 9 students.\n\n- 60% of grade 8 passed: 0.6 \u00d7 120 = 72.\n\n- 70% of grade 9 passed: 0.7 \u00d7 140 = 98.\n\n- Total passers: 72 + 98 = 170.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Another way to think about it is to calculate the number of students who failed in each grade and subtract that from the total number of students in each grade, but that might be more complicated for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, we could think about the total number of students and the overall pass percentage, but since the pass percentages are different for each grade, it's better to calculate them separately and then add them up.\n\nSo, the final answer is 170 students passed the exam.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{170} \\]"
