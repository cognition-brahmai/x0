        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces widgets at a rate of 200 per hour. First, I need to find out how many widgets are produced in a day. Since the factory operates for 8 hours a day, I can calculate the daily production by multiplying the hourly production rate by the number of hours in a day.\n\nSo, daily production = 200 widgets/hour * 8 hours/day = 1,600 widgets/day.\n\nNext, I need to find out the weekly production. The factory operates 5 days a week, so weekly production would be the daily production multiplied by the number of days in a week.\n\nWeekly production = 1,600 widgets/day * 5 days/week = 8,000 widgets/week.\n\nNow, due to quality control measures, 5% of the produced widgets are rejected as defective. That means 95% of the widgets are non-defective.\n\nTo find the number of non-defective widgets, I can calculate 95% of the weekly production.\n\nNon-defective widgets = 95% of 8,000 = 0.95 * 8,000 = 7,600 widgets.\n\nSo, the factory produces 7,600 non-defective widgets in a week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of defective widgets first and then subtract that from the total weekly production to get the non-defective widgets.\n\nDefective widgets = 5% of 8,000 = 0.05 * 8,000 = 400 widgets.\n\nTherefore, non-defective widgets = total weekly production - defective widgets = 8,000 - 400 = 7,600 widgets.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, the answer should be 7,600 non-defective widgets per week.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the initial steps.\n\nHourly production: 200 widgets/hour.\n\nDaily production: 200 * 8 = 1,600 widgets/day.\n\nWeekly production: 1,600 * 5 = 8,000 widgets/week.\n\nDefective rate: 5%, so non-defective rate: 95%.\n\nNon-defective widgets: 0.95 * 8,000 = 7,600.\n\nAlternatively, defective widgets: 0.05 * 8,000 = 400.\n\nNon-defective widgets: 8,000 - 400 = 7,600.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7600} \\]"
