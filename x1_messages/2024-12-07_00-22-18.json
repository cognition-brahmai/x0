Additionally, it can serve as a protective charm, warding off negative energies and providing a sense of peace and clarity to the user.\n\nHistory: The Starweaver's Locket was created by the ancient elven artisan, Lyranna Starweaver, who was renowned for her ability to infuse celestial energies into her creations. Legend has it that she forged this locket using metals obtained from a rare meteor shower that was believed to carry the essence of the stars themselves. The locket has passed through many hands over the centuries, each owner experiencing glimpses of destiny and finding solace in its protective aura. Most notably, it was owned by Queen Elowen during the Great War, who credited the locket with guiding her strategic decisions and protecting her from dark sorcery. Today, the locket is said to reside in a hidden temple, waiting for the next worthy bearer who will heed its cosmic call."
