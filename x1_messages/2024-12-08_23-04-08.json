Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the units involved. We have miles per hour for speed and feet and seconds for distance and time, respectively. So, there's a conversion from miles to feet and from hours to seconds needed here.\n\nI know that 1 mile equals 5280 feet. And 1 hour equals 3600 seconds. So, maybe I can convert the speed from miles per hour to feet per second.\n\nLet's try that. If the car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, then in terms of feet per second, it would be:\n\nFirst, convert miles to feet:\n\n60 miles/hour * 5280 feet/mile = 316,800 feet/hour.\n\nNow, convert hours to seconds:\n\n316,800 feet/hour \u00f7 3600 seconds/hour = 88 feet/second.\n\nSo, the car is traveling at 88 feet per second.\n\nNow, to find out how many feet it travels in 5 seconds, I can simply multiply the speed in feet per second by the time in seconds:\n\n88 feet/second * 5 seconds = 440 feet.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check if there's another way to approach this to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the formula for distance:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time.\n\nBut in this case, the units need to match. So, speed is in miles per hour, and time is in seconds. To make them compatible, I need to convert either speed to feet per second or time to hours.\n\nI already did the first approach by converting speed to feet per second. Let's try converting time to hours instead.\n\n5 seconds is equal to 5/3600 hours, since there are 3600 seconds in an hour.\n\nSo, time in hours is 5/3600 = 1/720 hours.\n\nNow, distance in miles would be:\n\nSpeed * Time = 60 miles/hour * 1/720 hours = 60/720 = 1/12 miles.\n\nNow, convert that distance from miles to feet:\n\n1/12 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 5280/12 = 440 feet.\n\nOkay, so both approaches give me the same answer: 440 feet.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using dimensional analysis to ensure that the units are converting correctly.\n\nStarting with 60 miles/hour, I can write that as:\n\n60 miles/hour * (5280 feet/mile) * (1 hour/3600 seconds).\n\nMultiplying that out:\n\n60 * 5280 / 3600 = 316,800 / 3600 = 88 feet/second.\n\nThen, 88 feet/second * 5 seconds = 440 feet.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that in one hour, the car travels 60 miles, and I need to find out how far it travels in 5 seconds, I can set up a proportion.\n\nFirst, find out how many seconds are in one hour:\n\n1 hour = 3600 seconds.\n\nSo, the car travels 60 miles in 3600 seconds.\n\nTherefore, in 1 second, it travels 60/3600 = 1/60 miles.\n\nIn 5 seconds, it travels 5*(1/60) = 5/60 = 1/12 miles.\n\nNow, convert 1/12 miles to feet: 1/12 * 5280 = 440 feet.\n\nOnce again, 440 feet.\n\nHmm, seems consistent across different methods.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like acceleration or something. But the problem says the car is traveling at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, so I don't think acceleration comes into play here. It's just straightforward uniform motion.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are correctly converted. For example, confirming that 1 mile is indeed 5280 feet and 1 hour is 3600 seconds.\n\nYes, those are standard conversions.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the definition of speed: distance over time. So, speed = distance/time.\n\nRearranging for distance: distance = speed * time.\n\nThat's the approach I used earlier, and it seems to hold up.\n\nI could also consider using the formula for distance in uniform motion: d = vt, where d is distance, v is velocity (speed), and t is time.\n\nAgain, d = 88 ft/s * 5 s = 440 feet.\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed this from multiple angles, and all methods point to 440 feet.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's a possibility of a mistake in the calculations.\n\nIn the first approach:\n\n60 miles/hour * 5280 feet/mile = 316,800 feet/hour.\n\nThen, 316,800 feet/hour \u00f7 3600 seconds/hour = 88 feet/second.\n\nThen, 88 ft/s * 5 s = 440 feet.\n\nEach step seems correct.\n\nIn the second approach:\n\n5 seconds is 5/3600 hours.\n\nDistance = 60 miles/hour * 5/3600 hours = 1/12 miles.\n\nConvert to feet: 1/12 * 5280 = 440 feet.\n\nAlso correct.\n\nIn the third approach:\n\n60 miles/hour * (5280 feet/mile) * (1 hour/3600 seconds) = 88 feet/second.\n\nThen, 88 ft/s * 5 s = 440 feet.\n\nAgain, correct.\n\nAnd in the proportional approach:\n\nCar travels 60 miles in 3600 seconds.\n\nSo, in 5 seconds, it travels (60/3600)*5 = 1/12 miles = 440 feet.\n\n\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the car travels 440 feet in 5 seconds at a speed of 60 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{440} \\]"
