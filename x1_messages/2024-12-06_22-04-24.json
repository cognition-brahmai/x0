        "content": "A standard deck of playing cards has 52 cards in total. There are 4 queens in the deck, one from each suit: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. To find the probability of drawing a queen on your first draw, you can use the formula for probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of queens, which is 4, and the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of cards in the deck, which is 52.\n\nSo, Probability = 4/52\n\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 4:\n\nProbability = 1/13\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a queen from a standard deck of 52 playing cards on your first draw is 1/13, or approximately 0.0769, which is about 7.69%."
