        "content": "Let's solve this system of linear equations. We have two equations:\n\n1) x + y = 7\n\n2) 2x - y = 3\n\nWe can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. I'll choose the elimination method because it seems straightforward for this system.\n\nFirst, I'll add both equations together to eliminate y:\n\n(x + y) + (2x - y) = 7 + 3\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\nx + y + 2x - y = 10\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n( x + 2x ) + ( y - y ) = 10\n\nWhich is:\n\n3x + 0 = 10\n\nSo, 3x = 10\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 10 / 3\n\nOkay, so x is 10/3. Now, I need to find y. I can substitute x back into one of the original equations. Let's use the first equation:\n\nx + y = 7\n\nPlug in x = 10/3:\n\n10/3 + y = 7\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\ny = 7 - 10/3\n\nTo subtract, let's get a common denominator. 7 is 21/3:\n\ny = 21/3 - 10/3 = (21 - 10)/3 = 11/3\n\nSo, y = 11/3\n\nWait a minute, let me check if this is correct. Let's plug both x and y back into the second equation to verify.\n\nSecond equation: 2x - y = 3\n\nPlug in x = 10/3 and y = 11/3:\n\n2*(10/3) - 11/3 = 20/3 - 11/3 = (20 - 11)/3 = 9/3 = 3\n\nYes, it checks out.\n\nSo, the solution is x = 10/3 and y = 11/3.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let me try solving it using the substitution method as well.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\nx + y = 7\n\nSolve for x:\n\nx = 7 - y\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n2x - y = 3\n\nbecomes\n\n2*(7 - y) - y = 3\n\nSimplify:\n\n14 - 2y - y = 3\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n14 - 3y = 3\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\n-3y = 3 - 14\n\n-3y = -11\n\ny = (-11)/(-3) = 11/3\n\nNow, substitute y back into x = 7 - y:\n\nx = 7 - 11/3 = 21/3 - 11/3 = 10/3\n\nSo, again, x = 10/3 and y = 11/3.\n\nLooks consistent between both methods.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{x = \\dfrac{10}{3},\\ y = \\dfrac{11}{3}} \\]"
