Let's break down the task into smaller steps to make it easier to understand and implement.\n\nFirst, we need to read text from a remote URL. In Go, we can use the `net/http` package to make HTTP requests and fetch the content from the URL.\n\nOnce we have the text, we need to count the frequency of each word. To do this, we'll need to split the text into words and then keep a count of each word. We can use a map in Go to store the word frequencies, where the keys are the words and the values are their counts.\n\nFinally, we need to display the top 10 most frequent words along with their frequencies. To do this, we'll need to sort the words based on their frequencies in descending order and then print the top 10.\n\nLet's start by writing the code to fetch the text from the URL. We'll need to import the necessary packages:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"io/ioutil\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"strings\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\turl := \"https://example.com\" // Replace with the actual URL\n\tresp, err := http.Get(url)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error fetching URL:\", err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\tdefer resp.Body.Close()\n\n\tbody, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error reading response body:\", err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\ttext := string(body)\n\tfmt.Println(\"Fetched text:\", text)\n}\n```\n\nThis code makes a GET request to the specified URL, reads the response body, and converts it to a string.\n\nNext, we need to split the text into words and count their frequencies. We'll consider words to be separated by spaces, and we'll also need to handle punctuation and make sure that words are treated in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere's how we can do that:\n\n```go\nwordFreq := make(map[string]int)\nwords := strings.Fields(text)\nfor _, word := range words {\n\t// Remove punctuation and convert to lowercase\n\tcleanWord := strings.TrimFunc(word, func(r rune) bool {\n\t\treturn !strings.ContainsRune(\"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\", r)\n\t})\n\tcleanWord = strings.ToLower(cleanWord)\n\tif cleanWord != \"\" {\n\t\twordFreq[cleanWord]++\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we use `strings.Fields` to split the text into words based on spaces. Then, for each word, we remove any punctuation using `strings.TrimFunc` and convert it to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity. Finally, we increment the count for each word in the map.\n\nNow, we need to sort the words based on their frequencies and display the top 10. To sort the map, we'll need to convert it to a slice of key-value pairs and then sort that slice.\n\nHere's how we can do that:\n\n```go\ntype wordCount struct {\n Word  string\n Count int\n}\n\nvar wordCounts []wordCount\nfor word, count := range wordFreq {\n wordCounts = append(wordCounts, wordCount{word, count})\n}\n\n// Sort the slice based on count in descending order\nsort.Slice(wordCounts, func(i, j int) bool {\n return wordCounts[i].Count > wordCounts[j].Count\n})\n\n// Display the top 10 words\nconst topN = 10\nfor i := 0; i < topN && i < len(wordCounts); i++ {\n fmt.Printf(\"%s: %d\\n\", wordCounts[i].Word, wordCounts[i].Count)\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we define a `wordCount` struct to hold each word and its count. We then iterate over the `wordFreq` map and append each word and its count to the `wordCounts` slice.\n\nNext, we sort the `wordCounts` slice using `sort.Slice` with a custom less function that compares the counts in descending order.\n\nFinally, we loop through the first 10 elements of the sorted slice (or fewer if there are fewer than 10 words) and print each word along with its frequency.\n\nPutting it all together, here's the complete program:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"io/ioutil\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"strings\"\n\t\"sort\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\turl := \"https://example.com\" // Replace with the actual URL\n\tresp, err := http.Get(url)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error fetching URL:\", err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\tdefer resp.Body.Close()\n\n\tbody, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error reading response body:\", err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\ttext := string(body)\n\n\twordFreq := make(map[string]int)\n\twords := strings.Fields(text)\n\tfor _, word := range words {\n\t\t// Remove punctuation and convert to lowercase\n\t\tcleanWord := strings.TrimFunc(word, func(r rune) bool {\n\t\t\treturn !strings.ContainsRune(\"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\", r)\n\t\t})\n\t\tcleanWord = strings.ToLower(cleanWord)\n\t\tif cleanWord != \"\" {\n\t\t\twordFreq[cleanWord]++\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\ttype wordCount struct {\n\t\tWord  string\n\t\tCount int\n\t}\n\n\tvar wordCounts []wordCount\n\tfor word, count := range wordFreq {\n\t\twordCounts = append(wordCounts, wordCount{word, count})\n\t}\n\n\t// Sort the slice based on count in descending order\n\tsort.Slice(wordCounts, func(i, j int) bool {\n\t\treturn wordCounts[i].Count > wordCounts[j].Count\n\t})\n\n\t// Display the top 10 words\n\tconst topN = 10\n\tfor i := 0; i < topN && i < len(wordCounts); i++ {\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"%s: %d\\n\", wordCounts[i].Word, wordCounts[i].Count)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `\"https://example.com\"` with the actual URL you want to fetch and analyze.\n\nThis program should fetch the text from the URL, count the frequency of each word, and display the top 10 most frequent words along with their counts.\n\nI hope this helps!
