        "content": "So the factory currently produces 500 units per day and operates for 25 days each month. If they increase their daily production by 10%, I need to find out how many units they will produce in one month.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the current monthly production. That would be the daily production multiplied by the number of operating days in a month.\n\nCurrent monthly production = 500 units/day * 25 days/month = 12,500 units/month.\n\nNow, they're increasing their daily production by 10%. So, I need to find what 10% of 500 units is and then add that to the original 500 units to get the new daily production.\n\n10% of 500 units = 0.10 * 500 = 50 units.\n\nSo, the new daily production = 500 units + 50 units = 550 units/day.\n\nNow, to find the new monthly production, I'll multiply the new daily production by the number of operating days in a month.\n\nNew monthly production = 550 units/day * 25 days/month = 13,750 units/month.\n\nWait, is there a simpler way to do this? I recall that if you're increasing a quantity by a certain percentage, you can multiply the original quantity by (1 + the percentage increase).\n\nSo, in this case, increasing 500 units by 10% can be calculated as:\n\n500 units * (1 + 0.10) = 500 * 1.10 = 550 units/day.\n\nThen, multiply by 25 days to get 13,750 units/month.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier. Good.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total monthly production and how it increases by 10%.\n\nBut wait, the increase is in daily production, which is then multiplied by the number of days.\n\nBut let's see, if I increase the daily production by 10%, the monthly production should also increase by 10%, right?\n\nWait, no. Because the monthly production is dependent on the daily production and the number of days.\n\nWait a minute, actually, if you increase daily production by 10% and the number of days remains the same, then the monthly production increases by 10%.\n\nSo, 10% of 12,500 units is 1,250 units.\n\nAdding that to the original 12,500 units gives 13,750 units, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce 13,750 units in one month after increasing their daily production by 10%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13750} \\]"
