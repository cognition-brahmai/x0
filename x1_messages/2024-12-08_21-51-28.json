        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a box containing some red balls and blue balls. The exact numbers are unknown, but we'll denote the number of red balls as r and the number of blue balls as b.\n\nFirst scenario: When we pick two balls at random, the probability that both are red is 1/5. So, the probability of drawing two red balls from the box is 1/5.\n\nSecond scenario: If we add three more red balls to the box, making the new number of red balls r + 3, then the probability of drawing two red balls becomes 1/2.\n\nOur goal is to find the original number of red and blue balls, r and b.\n\nAlright, let's recall how to calculate the probability of drawing two red balls from a box containing r red balls and b blue balls.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose two balls from the box is the combination of (r + b) balls taken 2 at a time, which is C(r + b, 2) = (r + b)(r + b - 1)/2.\n\nThe number of ways to choose two red balls is C(r, 2) = r(r - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability P of drawing two red balls is:\n\nP = [r(r - 1)/2] / [(r + b)(r + b - 1)/2] = [r(r - 1)] / [(r + b)(r + b - 1)]\n\nAccording to the problem, this probability is 1/5:\n\n[r(r - 1)] / [(r + b)(r + b - 1)] = 1/5\n\nNow, in the second scenario, after adding three more red balls, the new number of red balls is r + 3, and the total number of balls becomes r + b + 3.\n\nThe new probability of drawing two red balls is:\n\nP' = [ (r + 3)(r + 2) ) / 2 ] / [ (r + b + 3)(r + b + 2) ) / 2 ] = (r + 3)(r + 2) / (r + b + 3)(r + b + 2)\n\nAnd this probability is now 1/2:\n\n(r + 3)(r + 2) / (r + b + 3)(r + b + 2) = 1/2\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. [r(r - 1)] / [(r + b)(r + b - 1)] = 1/5\n\n2. (r + 3)(r + 2) / (r + b + 3)(r + b + 2) = 1/2\n\nWe need to solve these two equations for r and b, where r and b are positive integers since they represent the number of balls.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated, but let's try to manipulate these equations to find a relationship between r and b.\n\nFirst, let's denote t = r + b, the total number of balls initially.\n\nThen, the first equation becomes:\n\n[r(r - 1)] / [t(t - 1)] = 1/5\n\nSimilarly, after adding three red balls, the new total is t + 3.\n\nSo, the second equation is:\n\n(r + 3)(r + 2) / (t + 3)(t + 2) = 1/2\n\nNow, since t = r + b, and b is the number of blue balls, but we don't have a direct relationship yet.\n\nLet's see if we can express b in terms of r or vice versa.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n[r(r - 1)] / [t(t - 1)] = 1/5\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n5r(r - 1) = t(t - 1)\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation:\n\n2(r + 3)(r + 2) = (t + 3)(t + 2)\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. 5r(r - 1) = t(t - 1)\n\n2. 2(r + 3)(r + 2) = (t + 3)(t + 2)\n\nLet me expand both equations.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n5r(r - 1) = t(t - 1)\n\nExpanding:\n\n5r^2 - 5r = t^2 - t\n\nSecond equation:\n\n2(r + 3)(r + 2) = (t + 3)(t + 2)\n\nExpanding:\n\n2(r^2 + 5r + 6) = t^2 + 5t + 6\n\nSimplify:\n\n2r^2 + 10r + 12 = t^2 + 5t + 6\n\nNow, let's see if we can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate t.\n\nBut maybe it's better to solve one equation for t and substitute into the other.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n5r^2 - 5r = t^2 - t\n\nLet's rearrange:\n\nt^2 - t - 5r^2 + 5r = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic in t:\n\nt^2 - t - 5r^2 + 5r = 0\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation:\n\n2r^2 + 10r + 12 = t^2 + 5t + 6\n\nRearranged:\n\nt^2 + 5t + 6 - 2r^2 - 10r - 12 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\nt^2 + 5t - 2r^2 - 10r - 6 = 0\n\nNow, we have two equations in terms of t and r:\n\n1. t^2 - t - 5r^2 + 5r = 0\n\n2. t^2 + 5t - 2r^2 - 10r - 6 = 0\n\nLet's subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(t^2 + 5t - 2r^2 - 10r - 6) - (t^2 - t - 5r^2 + 5r) = 0 - 0\n\nSimplify:\n\nt^2 + 5t - 2r^2 - 10r - 6 - t^2 + t + 5r^2 - 5r = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(5t + t) + (-2r^2 + 5r^2) + (-10r - 5r) - 6 = 0\n\n6t + 3r^2 - 15r - 6 = 0\n\nLet's simplify this equation:\n\n6t + 3r^2 - 15r - 6 = 0\n\nWe can divide the entire equation by 3 to simplify:\n\n2t + r^2 - 5r - 2 = 0\n\nNow, solve for t:\n\n2t = -r^2 + 5r + 2\n\nt = (-r^2 + 5r + 2)/2\n\nBut since t = r + b, we can write:\n\nb = t - r = [(-r^2 + 5r + 2)/2] - r = (-r^2 + 5r + 2 - 2r)/2 = (-r^2 + 3r + 2)/2\n\nNow, since b must be a positive integer, (-r^2 + 3r + 2)/2 must be positive.\n\nLet's consider possible integer values of r that make b positive.\n\nFirst, let's find r such that -r^2 + 3r + 2 > 0\n\nSolve the inequality: -r^2 + 3r + 2 > 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (remember to reverse the inequality):\n\nr^2 - 3r - 2 < 0\n\nFind the roots of r^2 - 3r - 2 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nr = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 8)]/2 = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(17)]/2\n\nApproximately, r = [3 \u00b1 4.123]/2\n\nSo, r \u2248 (3 + 4.123)/2 \u2248 3.5615\n\nAnd r \u2248 (3 - 4.123)/2 \u2248 -0.5615\n\nSince r must be a positive integer, r can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nLet's test these values to see which one satisfies both equations.\n\nFirst, try r = 1:\n\nb = (-1^2 + 3*1 + 2)/2 = (-1 + 3 + 2)/2 = 4/2 = 2\n\nSo, r = 1, b = 2\n\nCheck the first probability:\n\nP = [1*0]/[(1+2)(3)] = 0/9 = 0 \u2260 1/5\n\nDoesn't satisfy.\n\nNext, r = 2:\n\nb = (-4 + 6 + 2)/2 = 4/2 = 2\n\nr = 2, b = 2\n\nP = [2*1]/[4*3] = 2/12 = 1/6 \u2260 1/5\n\nDoesn't satisfy.\n\nNext, r = 3:\n\nb = (-9 + 9 + 2)/2 = 2/2 = 1\n\nr = 3, b = 1\n\nP = [3*2]/[4*3] = 6/12 = 1/2 \u2260 1/5\n\nDoesn't satisfy.\n\nNext, r = 4:\n\nb = (-16 + 12 + 2)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1\n\nNegative b, not possible.\n\nSo, none of r = 1,2,3,4 satisfy the first probability condition.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the range for r.\n\nLet me check the inequality again.\n\nWe have -r^2 + 3r + 2 > 0\n\nWhich is equivalent to r^2 - 3r - 2 < 0\n\nThe roots are at r = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(17)]/2\n\nWhich are approximately r \u2248 3.5615 and r \u2248 -0.5615\n\nSo, the quadratic is negative outside these roots.\n\nBut since r must be positive, r must be less than 3.5615.\n\nSo, possible integer values are r = 1,2,3.\n\nBut earlier, r = 1,2,3 didn't satisfy.\n\nWait, for r = 3, b = 1, and P = 1/2, which is not equal to 1/5.\n\nSo, perhaps there's no solution in positive integers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nLet me double-check the initial equations.\n\nFirst probability:\n\nP = [r(r - 1)] / [(r + b)(r + b - 1)] = 1/5\n\nSecond probability:\n\nP' = (r + 3)(r + 2) / (r + b + 3)(r + b + 2) = 1/2\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should solve the equations simultaneously.\n\nLet me denote t = r + b\n\nThen, the equations are:\n\n1. 5r(r - 1) = t(t - 1)\n\n2. 2(r + 3)(r + 2) = (t + 3)(t + 2)\n\nLet me expand both equations again.\n\nEquation 1:\n\n5r^2 - 5r = t^2 - t\n\nEquation 2:\n\n2(r^2 + 5r + 6) = t^2 + 5t + 6\n\nSimplify:\n\n2r^2 + 10r + 12 = t^2 + 5t + 6\n\nLet me rearrange both equations:\n\nEquation 1:\n\nt^2 - t - 5r^2 + 5r = 0\n\nEquation 2:\n\nt^2 + 5t - 2r^2 - 10r - 6 = 0\n\nNow, subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(t^2 + 5t - 2r^2 - 10r - 6) - (t^2 - t - 5r^2 + 5r) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\nt^2 + 5t - 2r^2 - 10r - 6 - t^2 + t + 5r^2 - 5r = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(5t + t) + (-2r^2 + 5r^2) + (-10r - 5r) - 6 = 0\n\n6t + 3r^2 - 15r - 6 = 0\n\nSimplify by dividing by 3:\n\n2t + r^2 - 5r - 2 = 0\n\nNow, solve for t:\n\n2t = -r^2 + 5r + 2\n\nt = (-r^2 + 5r + 2)/2\n\nBut t must be an integer since it's the total number of balls.\n\nTherefore, (-r^2 + 5r + 2) must be even.\n\nLet me consider possible integer values of r again.\n\nPossible r values where -r^2 + 5r + 2 > 0 (since t > 0):\n\nFrom earlier, r can be 1,2,3,4.\n\nBut earlier attempts didn't satisfy.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that t must be an integer, so (-r^2 + 5r + 2) must be even.\n\nLet me check for r = 0:\n\nt = (0 + 0 + 2)/2 = 1\n\nBut r = 0 is not reasonable since there are red balls.\n\nFor r = 1:\n\nt = (-1 + 5 + 2)/2 = 6/2 = 3\n\nThen b = t - r = 3 - 1 = 2\n\nBut earlier, this didn't satisfy.\n\nFor r = 2:\n\nt = (-4 + 10 + 2)/2 = 8/2 = 4\n\nb = 4 - 2 = 2\n\nAgain, didn't satisfy.\n\nFor r = 3:\n\nt = (-9 + 15 + 2)/2 = 8/2 = 4\n\nb = 4 - 3 = 1\n\nDidn't satisfy.\n\nFor r = 4:\n\nt = (-16 + 20 + 2)/2 = 6/2 = 3\n\nb = 3 - 4 = -1, not possible.\n\nFor r = 5:\n\nt = (-25 + 25 + 2)/2 = 2/2 = 1\n\nb = 1 - 5 = -4, not possible.\n\nSeems like no solution in positive integers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming t = r + b.\n\nWait, perhaps I should express b in terms of r from the first equation and substitute into the second equation.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n5r(r - 1) = t(t - 1)\n\nExpress t in terms of r:\n\nt^2 - t - 5r(r - 1) = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic in t:\n\nt = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 20r(r - 1))]/2\n\nFor t to be an integer, sqrt(1 + 20r(r - 1)) must be an integer.\n\nLet\u2019s denote sqrt(1 + 20r(r - 1)) = k, where k is an integer.\n\nThen, k^2 = 1 + 20r(r - 1)\n\nSo, k^2 - 1 = 20r(r - 1)\n\n(k - 1)(k + 1) = 20r(r - 1)\n\nNow, we need to find integer solutions for r and k that satisfy this equation.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can try small integer values for r and see if k is an integer.\n\nLet\u2019s try r = 1:\n\nk^2 = 1 + 20*1*(0) = 1 \u2192 k = 1\n\nThen, t = [1 \u00b1 1]/2 \u2192 t = 1 or 0\n\nBut t must be positive, so t = 1\n\nThen, b = t - r = 0\n\nBut having b = 0 doesn't make sense in the context.\n\nAlso, check the probabilities:\n\nOriginal probability: [1*0]/[1*0)] is undefined, which doesn't match 1/5.\n\nNot valid.\n\nNext, r = 2:\n\nk^2 = 1 + 20*2*1 = 1 + 40 = 41\n\n41 is not a perfect square.\n\nNot valid.\n\nr = 3:\n\nk^2 = 1 + 20*3*2 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 k = 11\n\nThen, t = [1 \u00b1 11]/2 \u2192 t = 6 or -5\n\nOnly t = 6 is positive.\n\nThen, b = 6 - 3 = 3\n\nCheck the probabilities:\n\nOriginal probability: [3*2]/[6*5] = 6/30 = 1/5 \u2705\n\nAfter adding 3 red balls:\n\nNew r = 6, new t = 9\n\nProbability: [6*5]/[9*8] = 30/72 = 5/12 \u2260 1/2 \u274c\n\nDoesn't satisfy the second condition.\n\nNot valid.\n\nNext, r = 4:\n\nk^2 = 1 + 20*4*3 = 1 + 240 = 241\n\n241 is not a perfect square.\n\nNot valid.\n\nr = 5:\n\nk^2 = 1 + 20*5*4 = 1 + 400 = 401\n\n401 is not a perfect square.\n\nNot valid.\n\nr = 6:\n\nk^2 = 1 + 20*6*5 = 1 + 600 = 601\n\nNot a perfect square.\n\nNot valid.\n\nSeems like only r = 3 gives integer t, but doesn't satisfy the second condition.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's no solution, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem has no solution in positive integers, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nLet me double-check the probability calculations.\n\nOriginal probability:\n\nP = [r(r - 1)] / [t(t - 1)] = 1/5\n\nAfter adding 3 red balls:\n\nP' = [(r + 3)(r + 2)] / [(t + 3)(t + 2)] = 1/2\n\nLet me plug in r = 3 and t = 6:\n\nP = (3*2)/(6*5) = 6/30 = 1/5 \u2705\n\nP' = (6*5)/(9*8) = 30/72 = 5/12 \u2260 1/2 \u274c\n\nNot matching.\n\nNext, try r = 4 and t = 6 (from earlier):\n\nBut r = 4, t = 6 implies b = 2\n\nP = (4*3)/(6*5) = 12/30 = 2/5 \u2260 1/5 \u274c\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the earlier steps.\n\nLet me try to solve the equations differently.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n5r(r - 1) = t(t - 1)\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\n2(r + 3)(r + 2) = (t + 3)(t + 2)\n\nLet me expand both equations again.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n5r^2 - 5r = t^2 - t\n\nSecond equation:\n\n2(r^2 + 5r + 6) = t^2 + 5t + 6\n\nSimplify:\n\n2r^2 + 10r + 12 = t^2 + 5t + 6\n\nNow, let's solve the first equation for t^2:\n\nt^2 = 5r(r - 1) + t\n\nWait, that seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate t^2.\n\nSecond equation: 2r^2 + 10r + 12 = t^2 + 5t + 6\n\nFirst equation: 5r^2 - 5r = t^2 - t\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(2r^2 + 10r + 12) - (5r^2 - 5r) = (t^2 + 5t + 6) - (t^2 - t)\n\nSimplify:\n\n2r^2 + 10r + 12 - 5r^2 + 5r = t^2 + 5t + 6 - t^2 + t\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-3r^2 + 15r + 12 = 6t + 6\n\nSimplify:\n\n-3r^2 + 15r + 12 - 6 = 6t\n\n-3r^2 + 15r + 6 = 6t\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\nt = (-3r^2 + 15r + 6)/6\n\nSimplify:\n\nt = (-r^2 + 5r + 2)/2\n\nWait, this is the same expression for t as before.\n\nSo, t = (-r^2 + 5r + 2)/2\n\nBut t must be positive and an integer.\n\nLet me consider possible integer values of r that make t positive.\n\nSet (-r^2 + 5r + 2)/2 > 0\n\nThen, -r^2 + 5r + 2 > 0\n\nAs before, r^2 - 5r - 2 < 0\n\nThe roots are r = [5 \u00b1 sqrt(25 + 8)]/2 = [5 \u00b1 sqrt(33)]/2\n\nApproximately, r = [5 \u00b1 5.744]/2\n\nSo, r \u2248 5.372 or r \u2248 -0.372\n\nThus, r must be less than approximately 5.372 and greater than approximately -0.372.\n\nSince r is positive, r can be 1,2,3,4,5\n\nLet's check r = 5:\n\nt = (-25 + 25 + 2)/2 = 2/2 = 1\n\nThen, b = 1 - 5 = -4, not possible.\n\nr = 4:\n\nt = (-16 + 20 + 2)/2 = 6/2 = 3\n\nb = 3 - 4 = -1, not possible.\n\nr = 3:\n\nt = (-9 + 15 + 2)/2 = 8/2 = 4\n\nb = 4 - 3 = 1\n\nCheck probabilities:\n\nOriginal: [3*2]/[4*3] = 6/12 = 1/2 \u2260 1/5 \u274c\n\nNot matching.\n\nr = 2:\n\nt = (-4 + 10 + 2)/2 = 8/2 = 4\n\nb = 4 - 2 = 2\n\nOriginal probability: [2*1]/[4*3] = 2/12 = 1/6 \u2260 1/5 \u274c\n\nNot matching.\n\nr = 1:\n\nt = (-1 + 5 + 2)/2 = 6/2 = 3\n\nb = 3 - 1 = 2\n\nOriginal probability: [1*0]/[3*2] = 0/6 = 0 \u2260 1/5 \u274c\n\nStill not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's no solution in positive integers, which seems unlikely for a problem like this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the total number of balls isn't t = r + b, but perhaps there's a different relationship.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider that b is not necessarily an integer, but that doesn't make sense because the number of balls must be integers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the probability calculations.\n\nLet me recall that the probability of drawing two red balls without replacement is given by:\n\nP = (r / (r + b)) * ((r - 1) / (r + b - 1)) = [r(r - 1)] / [(r + b)(r + b - 1)]\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSimilarly, after adding three red balls:\n\nP' = ((r + 3) / (r + b + 3)) * ((r + 2) / (r + b + 2)) = [(r + 3)(r + 2)] / [(r + b + 3)(r + b + 2)]\n\nWhich is also correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should set up the equations differently.\n\nLet me denote t = r + b\n\nThen, the equations are:\n\n1.

r^2 - 2rb - 5r - b^2 - 2b - 6 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\nr^2 - 2rb + 5r - b^2 - 2b + 6 = 0 \u2014 (2)\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n(1) 4r^2 - 4r - 2rb - b^2 + b = 0\n\n(2) r^2 - 2rb + 5r - b^2 - 2b + 6 = 0\n\nLet me try to eliminate one variable.\n\nLet me solve equation (1) for b in terms of r.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\n4r^2 - 4r - 2rb - b^2 + b = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic in b:\n\n-b^2 - (2r - 1)b + (4r^2 - 4r) = 0\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\nb^2 + (2r - 1)b - (4r^2 - 4r) = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nb = [- (2r - 1) \u00b1 sqrt( (2r -

20r + 1) must be an integer.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nk^2 = 20r^2 - 20r + 1\n\nSo, k^2 - 20r^2 + 20r - 1 = 0\n\nThis is a Diophantine equation, and it seems quite complex to solve directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for integer solutions by testing values of r.\n\nLet me try r = 1:\n\nk^2 = 20(1)^2 - 20(1) + 1 = 20 - 20 + 1 = 1 \u2192 k = 1\n\nThen, b = [ - (2 - 1) \u00b1 1 ] / 2 = [ -1 \u00b1 1 ] / 2\n\nSo, b = ( -1 + 1 ) / 2 = 0 or b = ( -1 - 1 ) / 2 = -1\n\nb = 0 or b = -1 (not positive)\n\nNot valid.\n\nr = 2:\n\nk^2 = 20(4) -

2rb + 5r - b^2 - 2b + 6 = 0\n\nPlug in r = 3, b = 3:\n\n9 - 18 + 15 - 9 - 6 + 6 = 9 - 18 + 15 - 9 - 6 + 6 = -18 + 24 - 9 = 6 - 9 = -3 \u2260 0\n\nDoesn't satisfy.\n\nNext, r = 4:\n\nk^2 = 20(16) - 20(4) + 1 = 320 - 80 + 1 = 241\n\nNot a perfect square.\n\nNot valid.\n\nr = 5:\n\nk^2 = 20(25) - 20(5) + 1 = 500 - 100 + 1 = 401\n\nNot a perfect square.\n\nNot valid.\n\nr = 6:\n\nk^2 = 20(36) - 20(6) + 1 = 720 - 120 + 1 = 601\n\nNot a perfect square.\n\nNot valid.\n\nr = 7:\n\nk^2 = 20(49) - 20(7) + 1 = 980 - 140 + 1 = 841 \u2192 k = 29\n\nThen, b = [ - (14 - 1) \u00b1 29 ] / 2 = [ -13 \u00b1 29 ] / 2\n\nSo, b = (16)/2 = 8 or b = (-42)/2 = -21\n\nOnly b = 8 is positive.\n\nNow, check equation (2):\n\nr^2 - 2rb + 5r - b^2 - 2b + 6 = 0\n\nPlug in r = 7, b = 8:\n\n49 - 2*7*8 + 5*7 - 64 - 16 + 6 = 49 - 112 + 35 - 64 - 16 + 6\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n49 - 112 = -63\n\n-63 + 35 = -28\n\n-28 - 64 = -92\n\n-92 - 16 = -108\n\n-108 + 6 = -102 \u2260 0\n\nDoesn't satisfy.\n\nNext, r = 8:\n\nk^2 = 20(64) - 20(8) + 1 = 1280 - 160 + 1 = 1121\n\nNot a perfect square.\n\nNot valid.\n\nr = 9:\n\nk^2 = 20(81) - 20(9) + 1 = 1620 - 180 + 1 = 1441\n\nNot a perfect square.\n\nNot valid.\n\nr = 10:\n\nk^2 = 20(100) - 20(10) + 1 = 2000 - 200 + 1 = 1801\n\nNot a perfect square.\n\nNot valid.\n\nThis suggests that there might be no solution in positive integers for r and b that satisfy both conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the problem has a solution only if r and b are not integers, which is unlikely for a problem about counting balls.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I need to consider a different approach entirely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider setting up a system of equations and solving for r and b using substitution or elimination.\n\nLet me recall the two equations:\n\n1. 5r(r - 1) = (r + b)(r + b - 1)\n\n2. 2(r + 3)(r + 2) = (r + b + 3)(r + b + 2)\n\nLet me denote s = r + b\n\nThen, the equations become:\n\n1. 5r(r - 1) = s(s - 1)\n\n2. 2(r + 3)(r + 2) = (s + 3)(s + 2)\n\nNow, from equation 1:\n\ns(s - 1) = 5r(r - 1)\n\nSo, s^2 - s = 5r^2 - 5r\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2:\n\n(s + 3)(s + 2) = 2(r + 3)(r + 2)\n\nExpand both sides:\n\ns^2 + 5s + 6 = 2(r^2 + 5r + 6) = 2r^2 + 10r + 12\n\nNow, let's substitute s^2 from equation 1.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\ns^2 = 5r^2 - 5r + s\n\nWait, that seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider subtracting equation 1 from equation 2.\n\nEquation 2: s^2 + 5s + 6 = 2r^2 + 10r + 12\n\nEquation 1: s^2 - s = 5r^2 - 5r\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(s^2 + 5s + 6) - (s^2 - s) = (2r^2 + 10r + 12) - (5r^2 - 5r)\n\nSimplify:\n\ns^2 + 5s + 6 - s^2 + s = 2r^2 + 10r + 12 - 5r^2 + 5r\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n6s + 6 = -3r^2 + 15r + 12\n\nDivide by 3:\n\n2s + 2 = -r^2 + 5r + 4\n\nNow, solve for s:\n\n2s = -r^2 + 5r + 2\n\ns = (-r^2 + 5r + 2)/2\n\nBut s must be an integer, so (-r^2 + 5r + 2) must be even.\n\nLet me consider possible integer values of r that make s positive.\n\nFrom earlier attempts, r = 3 gives s = 4, but doesn't satisfy both conditions.\n\nSimilarly, r = 7 gives s = 15, but again doesn't satisfy both conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider expressing b in terms of r.\n\nSince s = r + b, then b = s - r = [(-r^2 + 5r + 2)/2] - r = [ -r^2 + 5r + 2 - 2r ] / 2 = [ -r^2 + 3r + 2 ] / 2\n\nFor b to be positive, [ -r^2 + 3r + 2 ] > 0\n\nSo, -r^2 + 3r + 2 > 0\n\nMultiply by -1: r^2 - 3r - 2 < 0\n\nSolve r^2 -
