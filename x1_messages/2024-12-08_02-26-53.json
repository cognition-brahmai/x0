Each step in the plan will produce an evidence value which corresponds to the output of one of the available functions. The input to these functions could be the user's question, previous evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nAvailable Tools:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: A tool that enables users to perform searches using the DuckDuckGo search engine. It returns a list of potential sources that might contain answers to the user's query.\nPageLoader[input]: Loads one or more websites provided as newline separated links in the input string. Outputs the plain text content of these pages.\nURLGrabber[input]: Extracts URLs from a plain text input and provides them as a newline-separated plain text output.\nNLPModel[input]: A natural language processing model designed to answer questions based on a provided text passage. The input should be a question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable (e.g., What is the capital of France, given :evidence1:?).\n\nOutput Format:\nPlan: [Initial action based on the user's question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to execute with its input]\nPlan: [Subsequent action based on the outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to execute with its input, potentially referencing prior evidence (e.g., \"Considering :evidence0\")]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: containing the ultimate answer]\n\nQuestion: Who is the current Prime Minister of Japan and what political party do they belong to?"
