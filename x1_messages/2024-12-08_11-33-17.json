        "content": "The Riemann zeta function, denoted by \u03b6(s), is a fundamental function in mathematics, particularly in number theory. It's defined for complex numbers s with real part greater than 1 by the infinite series:\n\n\u03b6(s) = 1^(-s) + 2^(-s) + 3^(-s) + ... = \u2211(n=1 to \u221e) n^(-s)\n\nFor s=2, we're dealing with the series:\n\n\u03b6(2) = 1/(1^2) + 1/(2^2) + 1/(3^2) + ... = \u2211(n=1 to \u221e) 1/(n^2)\n\nThis specific value of the zeta function, \u03b6(2), is also known as the Basel problem. It was famously solved by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in the 18th century.\n\nEuler found that:\n\n\u03b6(2) = \u03c0^2 / 6\n\nThis result is quite remarkable because it connects the zeta function, which is defined in terms of integers, to \u03c0, which is traditionally associated with circles and geometry.\n\nTo give you a sense of how Euler arrived at this result, I can outline one of his approaches. Euler considered the Taylor series expansion of the sine function divided by x:\n\nsin(x)/x = 1 - x^2/(3!) + x^4/(5!) - ...\n\nHe also knew that sin(x)/x has roots at x = \u00b1\u03c0, \u00b12\u03c0, \u00b13\u03c0, etc. So, he factored the expression as an infinite product:\n\nsin(x)/x = (1 - x^2/(\u03c0^2))(1 - x^2/(4\u03c0^2))(1 - x^2/(9\u03c0^2))...\n\nBy expanding this product and comparing coefficients with the Taylor series, Euler was able to relate the sum of the reciprocals of squares to \u03c0^2.\n\nSpecifically, the coefficient of x^2 in the expanded product is:\n\n- [1/(\u03c0^2) + 1/(4\u03c0^2) + 1/(9\u03c0^2) + ...] = -\u03b6(2)/\u03c0^2\n\nFrom the Taylor series, the coefficient of x^2 is -1/(3!). Equating these gives:\n\n-\u03b6(2)/\u03c0^2 = -1/6 \u21d2 \u03b6(2) = \u03c0^2 / 6\n\nThis is a simplified version of Euler's argument. There are more rigorous proofs, but this gives you an idea of his ingenious approach.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly: \u03b6(2) = \u03c0^2 / 6 \u2248 1.644934.\n\nThis result has profound implications and has been generalized to other even integers, where \u03b6(2n) can be expressed in terms of Bernoulli numbers and \u03c0^(2n). For odd integers, the values are less straightforward and are still subjects of ongoing research in mathematics.\n\nI hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any more questions or need further clarification."
