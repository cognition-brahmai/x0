        "content": "Deforestation can have severe impacts on terrestrial animal populations, but it's unlikely to lead to the extinction of all terrestrial animals. While deforestation does contribute to habitat loss and fragmentation, which can push many species towards extinction, there are several reasons why not all terrestrial animals would be affected in the same way.\n\nFirstly, some species are more adaptable than others. Animals that can survive in a variety of environments or have a broad diet may be better able to cope with habitat changes caused by deforestation. For example, generalist species like rats or crows can thrive in urban areas, whereas specialist species that rely on specific habitats or food sources are more vulnerable.\n\nSecondly, deforestation doesn't occur uniformly across the globe. There are still large areas of intact forests and other habitats that support diverse wildlife populations. Conservation efforts, both in terms of protecting existing habitats and restoring degraded ones, can help mitigate the impacts of deforestation.\n\nAdditionally, some animals may shift their ranges in response to habitat loss, moving to areas where suitable habitat remains. This can sometimes lead to the colonization of new areas or the mixing of previously separated populations.\n\nIt's also worth noting that extinction is a complex process influenced by multiple factors, including climate change, pollution, overexploitation, and disease, in addition to habitat loss. While deforestation is a significant threat, it's not the only one, and its impacts can be compounded or mitigated by other factors.\n\nIn summary, while deforestation poses a serious threat to many terrestrial animal species and can lead to local extinctions or even global extinctions in some cases, it's unlikely to cause the extinction of all terrestrial animals due to the adaptability of some species, the presence of remaining habitats, and various conservation efforts.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n- Laurance, W.
