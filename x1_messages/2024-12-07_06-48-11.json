        "content": "Let's see. The train is going at 90 kilometers per hour, and I need to find out how far it travels in 40 minutes. First, I should probably convert the time from minutes to hours since the speed is in kilometers per hour.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 40 minutes is 40/60 hours. That simplifies to 2/3 of an hour.\n\nNow, distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, distance = 90 km/h * 2/3 hours.\n\nLet me calculate that. 90 multiplied by 2 is 180, and then divided by 3 is 60. So, the train travels 60 kilometers in 40 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. If the train travels 90 kilometers in one hour, then in 40 minutes, which is two-thirds of an hour, it should travel two-thirds of 90 kilometers.\n\nTwo-thirds of 90 is indeed 60 kilometers. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the speed into kilometers per minute. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 90 kilometers per hour is 90/60 kilometers per minute, which is 1.5 kilometers per minute.\n\nThen, in 40 minutes, the train would travel 1.5 km/min * 40 min = 60 kilometers.\n\nSame answer again. So, I'm confident that 60 kilometers is the correct distance the train travels in 40 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]\n"
