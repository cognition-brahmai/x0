        "content": "Let's see. The train is going from Town A to Town B, and it's moving at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. The distance between the two towns is 180 miles. So, first things first, I need to figure out how long the journey takes.\n\nTo find the time it takes to travel 180 miles at 60 mph, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTime = 180 miles / 60 mph = 3 hours\n\nSo, the train takes 3 hours to get from Town A to Town B.\n\nNow, the train leaves Town A at 2:00 PM. If the journey takes 3 hours, then it should arrive at Town B at:\n\n2:00 PM + 3 hours = 5:00 PM\n\nBut wait, there's a time difference between the two towns. Town B is 30 minutes ahead of Town A. That means, when it's 2:00 PM in Town A, it's 2:30 PM in Town B.\n\nSo, if the train leaves Town A at 2:00 PM, which is 2:30 PM in Town B's time, and the journey takes 3 hours, then the arrival time in Town B would be:\n\n2:30 PM (Town B's time when the train leaves) + 3 hours = 5:30 PM\n\nBut I need to confirm this. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, since the train takes 3 hours to reach Town B, and Town B is 30 minutes ahead, perhaps I should consider the time zones differently.\n\nLet me consider the absolute time. If the train leaves Town A at 2:00 PM and takes 3 hours, it should arrive at 5:00 PM Town A time. But since Town B is 30 minutes ahead, the local time in Town B would be 5:30 PM.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the local time in Town B when the train arrives would be 5:30 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5:30\\ \\text{PM}} \\]"
