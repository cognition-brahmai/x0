        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have three types of pens: blue, black, and red. We're given some ratios and a specific number of black pens sold, and we need to find the total number of pens sold.\n\nFirst, let's note down what we know:\n\n1. The ratio of blue to black pens is 2:3.\n\n2. The ratio of black to red pens is 4:5.\n\n3. The store sells 240 black pens in a week.\n\nOur goal is to find the total number of pens sold, which is the sum of blue, black, and red pens.\n\nLet's start by understanding the ratios.\n\nThe ratio of blue to black pens is 2:3. This means that for every 2 blue pens sold, there are 3 black pens sold.\n\nSimilarly, the ratio of black to red pens is 4:5, meaning that for every 4 black pens sold, there are 5 red pens sold.\n\nBut wait, we have two different ratios involving black pens. To combine these ratios, we need to make the number of black pens the same in both ratios.\n\nLet's see:\n\nBlue : Black = 2 : 3\n\nBlack : Red = 4 : 5\n\nTo combine these, we need the black pens to be a common multiple in both ratios.\n\nThe first ratio has black as 3 parts, and the second has black as 4 parts. The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12.\n\nSo, we'll adjust both ratios to have black pens as 12 parts.\n\nFirst ratio: Blue : Black = 2 : 3\n\nTo make black = 12, we multiply both parts by 4.\n\nSo, Blue : Black = (2*4) : (3*4) = 8 : 12\n\nSecond ratio: Black : Red = 4 : 5\n\nTo make black = 12, we multiply both parts by 3.\n\nSo, Black : Red = (4*3) : (5*3) = 12 : 15\n\nNow, we can combine these ratios:\n\nBlue : Black : Red = 8 : 12 : 15\n\nThis means that for every 8 blue pens, there are 12 black pens and 15 red pens sold.\n\nNow, we know that the store sells 240 black pens in a week.\n\nIn our combined ratio, black pens are 12 parts.\n\nSo, if 12 parts = 240 pens, then 1 part = 240 / 12 = 20 pens.\n\nNow, we can find the number of blue and red pens sold.\n\nBlue pens: 8 parts = 8 * 20 = 160 pens\n\nRed pens: 15 parts = 15 * 20 = 300 pens\n\nNow, to find the total number of pens sold, we add up blue, black, and red pens:\n\nTotal pens = blue + black + red = 160 + 240 + 300 = 700 pens\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that.\n\nIf blue is 160, black is 240, and red is 300, then total is indeed 700.\n\nBut let's make sure that the ratios hold true with these numbers.\n\nFirst, blue to black ratio should be 2:3.\n\n160 : 240 simplifies to 2:3, since 160/2 = 80 and 240/3 = 80.\n\nSimilarly, black to red should be 4:5.\n\n240 : 300 simplifies to 4:5, since 240/4 = 60 and 300/5 = 60.\n\nPerfect, the ratios are consistent.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pens sold is 700.\n\nAlternatively, we could have approached this by setting up equations based on the ratios.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nB_blue = number of blue pens\n\nB_black = number of black pens\n\nB_red = number of red pens\n\nGiven:\n\nB_blue / B_black = 2 / 3\n\nAnd\n\nB_black / B_red = 4 / 5\n\nAlso, B_black = 240\n\nFirst, from B_blue / B_black = 2 / 3, we can solve for B_blue:\n\nB_blue = (2 / 3) * B_black = (2 / 3) * 240 = 160\n\nSimilarly, from B_black / B_red = 4 / 5, we can solve for B_red:\n\nB_red = (5 / 4) * B_black = (5 / 4) * 240 = 300\n\nThen, total pens = B_blue + B_black + B_red = 160 + 240 + 300 = 700\n\nThis confirms our earlier result.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the overall ratio of blue to black to red pens.\n\nWe have:\n\nBlue : Black = 2 : 3\n\nBlack : Red = 4 : 5\n\nTo combine these, we need to express them with a common term for black pens.\n\nAs we did before, we made black pens 12 parts by scaling the ratios.\n\nAlternatively, we can express both ratios in terms of a variable.\n\nLet\u2019s say that the number of black pens is B.\n\nThen, from the first ratio:\n\nBlue = (2 / 3) * B\n\nFrom the second ratio:\n\nRed = (5 / 4) * B\n\nNow, total pens = Blue + Black + Red = (2 / 3)B + B + (5 / 4)B\n\nTo add these up, we need a common denominator.\n\nThe denominators are 3 and 4, so the least common multiple is 12.\n\nSo, convert each term:\n\n(2 / 3)B = (2 * 4) / (3 * 4) B = 8 / 12 B\n\nB = 12 / 12 B\n\n(5 / 4)B = (5 * 3) / (4 * 3) B = 15 / 12 B\n\nNow, total pens = (8 / 12)B + (12 / 12)B + (15 / 12)B = (8 + 12 + 15) / 12 B = 35 / 12 B\n\nSo, total pens = (35 / 12) * B\n\nGiven that B = 240, then total pens = (35 / 12) * 240\n\nCalculate that:\n\nFirst, 240 divided by 12 is 20.\n\nThen, 35 * 20 = 700\n\nAgain, we get total pens = 700\n\nThis consistency across different methods reinforces that our answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to think in terms of proportions:\n\nWe have the ratios:\n\nBlue : Black = 2 : 3\n\nBlack : Red = 4 : 5\n\nWe can find the ratio of Blue : Black : Red by combining them, as we did earlier, to get 8 : 12 : 15\n\nThen, the total parts are 8 + 12 + 15 = 35 parts\n\nGiven that 12 parts (black pens) correspond to 240 pens, then 1 part corresponds to 240 / 12 = 20 pens\n\nTherefore, total pens = 35 parts * 20 pens/part = 700 pens\n\nSame answer again.\n\nI think it's clear that the total number of pens sold is 700.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{700} \\]"
