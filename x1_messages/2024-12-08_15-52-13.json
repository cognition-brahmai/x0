        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a basket with 4 apples and 6 oranges, making a total of 10 fruits. We're going to pick two fruits one after the other, and we eat the first one before picking the second. We need to find the probability that both fruits are oranges.\n\nFirst, let's understand what probability is. Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the event is picking two oranges in a row.\n\nLet's break it down into smaller steps:\n\n1. **Probability of picking an orange first:**\n\n   - There are 6 oranges out of 10 fruits.\n\n   - So, the probability is 6/10 or 0.6.\n\n2. **Probability of picking an orange second, given that the first one was an orange:**\n\n   - Since we ate the first orange, there are now 5 oranges left and a total of 9 fruits remaining.\n\n   - So, the probability is 5/9.\n\n3. **Combined probability of both events happening:**\n\n   - Since these are sequential events and the first event affects the second (because we don't replace the first fruit), we need to multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\n   - Therefore, the combined probability is (6/10) * (5/9).\n\nNow, let's calculate that:\n\n(6/10) * (5/9) = (6*5) / (10*9) = 30 / 90 = 1/3.\n\nWait a minute, 30 divided by 90 is indeed 1/3, but let's double-check:\n\n- Simplify 30/90 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 30: 30/90 = 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it in terms of combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 oranges out of 6 is \"6 choose 2\", which is calculated as:\n\nC(6,2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = (6*5*4!) / (2*1 * 4!) = (6*5) / 2 = 15.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick any 2 fruits out of 10 is \"10 choose 2\":\n\nC(10,2) = 10! / (2! * (10-2)!) = (10*9*8!) / (2*1 * 8!)} = (10*9)/2 = 45.\n\nSo, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n\nProbability = C(6,2) / C(10,2) = 15 / 45 = 1/3.\n\nHmm, interesting. Both methods give us the same answer.\n\nWait, but in the first method, we considered the sequence: first orange, then another orange. In the second method, we considered combinations, which don't take order into account.\n\nDoes that make a difference?\n\nWell, in probability, when dealing with sequences without replacement, we consider the order in which items are picked. However, since in this problem, we're only interested in both being oranges, regardless of the order, the combination approach is also valid.\n\nIn fact, the combination approach is often more straightforward for problems where order doesn't matter.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose we consider the probabilities step by step, as in the first method.\n\nFirst pick: Probability of orange is 6/10.\n\nAfter eating the first orange, there are 5 oranges left out of 9 fruits.\n\nSecond pick: Probability of orange is 5/9.\n\nMultiplying these gives us (6/10)*(5/9) = 30/90 = 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the order could be orange then orange, and we're picking two fruits, but since we're only interested in both being oranges, the combination approach directly gives us the same result.\n\nSo, the probability is indeed 1/3.\n\nWait, but let's cross-verify this.\n\nSuppose we have 4 apples and 6 oranges.\n\nTotal ways to pick 2 fruits: C(10,2) = 45.\n\nWays to pick 2 oranges: C(6,2) = 15.\n\nTherefore, probability = 15/45 = 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, ways to pick 2 apples: C(4,2) = 6.\n\nWays to pick one apple and one orange: C(4,1)*C(6,1) = 4*6 = 24.\n\nTotal: 15 (oo) + 24 (ao or oa) + 6 (aa) = 45, which matches.\n\nSo, yes, the probability of picking two oranges is 15/45 = 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
