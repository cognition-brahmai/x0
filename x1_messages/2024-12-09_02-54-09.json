Each tool can be used multiple times but should not be used consecutively and each plan must have an associated evidence value.\n\nHere are the tools that can be called:\n\nWebSearch[input]: A tool that allows users to search for information on the internet. This tool is useful in finding relevant websites or pages that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nTextAnalyzer[input]: Analyzes a given text and provides a summary of its content. The input should be a string containing the text to analyze.\nQAEngine[input]: Can answer questions based on common sense, general world knowledge, and specific context provided as input. \nLinkCollector[input]: Extracts all links from a given text. The input should be a string containing the text with links.\nSiteReader[input]: Reads the content of one or more websites from the input string which contains newline delimited links. \n\nThe output format should be:\nPlan: [first action]\n#Evidence1 = [function call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on #Evidence1]\n#Evidence2 = [next function call with input parameter, referencing previous evidence if necessary]\n...\nFinal Answer: #Evidence[n]\n\nQuestion: Who invented the first electric car and when was it invented?"
