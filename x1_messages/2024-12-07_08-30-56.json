        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a JavaScript function that replaces every blank space in a string with a dash (\"-\"):\n\n```javascript\nfunction replaceSpacesWithDashes(inputString) {\n  return inputString.replace(/ /g, \"-\");\n}\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a string as an argument, and it will return the modified string with dashes instead of spaces. For example:\n\n```javascript\nlet originalString = \"Hello World\";\nlet modifiedString = replaceSpacesWithDashes(originalString);\nconsole.log(modifiedString); // Output: \"Hello-World\"\n```\n\nThis function uses the `replace` method with a regular expression `/ /g` to find all spaces in the string and replace them with dashes. The `g` flag in the regular expression stands for \"global,\" which means it will replace all occurrences of spaces in the string, not just the first one."
