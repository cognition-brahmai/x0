        "content": "Let's see. There are 15 apples in the basket to start with. John takes 3 apples, so that would leave 15 minus 3, which is 12 apples. Then Mary takes 4 apples from those 12, so 12 minus 4 equals 8 apples. Finally, Peter takes 5 apples from the remaining 8, so 8 minus 5 equals 3 apples. So, there should be 3 apples left in the basket.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can add up the apples taken by John, Mary, and Peter and subtract that total from the original 15 apples.\n\nJohn takes 3, Mary takes 4, Peter takes 5. So, 3 plus 4 is 7, plus 5 is 12 apples taken in total. Now, subtract that from the original 15 apples: 15 minus 12 equals 3 apples left. Yep, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the apples being removed one by one. Starting with 15 apples:\n\n- John takes 3 apples: 15 - 3 = 12\n\n- Mary takes 4 apples: 12 - 4 = 8\n\n- Peter takes 5 apples: 8 - 5 = 3\n\nSo, again, 3 apples are left in the basket.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the order in which they take the apples doesn't matter, as long as the total taken is 12 apples, the result should be the same.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. For example, maybe someone is putting apples back into the basket or something like that, but the problem doesn't suggest any such thing. It simply states that John, Mary, and Peter take a certain number of apples, and we need to find out how many are left.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any apples that no one can take or any constraints on who can take how many apples, but again, the problem seems straightforward: 15 apples initially, and specific numbers are taken by John, Mary, and Peter.\n\nSo, sticking to the basic arithmetic approach, it seems clear that there are 3 apples left in the basket.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's imagine that there is a mistake in the problem itself, like maybe the total number of apples taken exceeds the initial amount. But in this case, 3 + 4 + 5 equals 12, which is less than 15, so that's not an issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a trick involving the apples being taken at different times or under different conditions, but again, the problem is presented in a straightforward manner without any such complications.\n\nTherefore, I am confident that the correct answer is 3 apples left in the basket.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
