        "content": "Let me see. So, there's this store that gives a 20% discount if you buy 5 items or more. I want to know how much I would save if I bought 10 items, each costing $15.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total cost without any discount. Since each item is $15 and I'm buying 10, I can multiply 15 by 10.\n\n15 \u00d7 10 = 150\n\nSo, without any discount, the total cost would be $150.\n\nNow, since I'm buying 10 items, which is more than 5, I qualify for the 20% discount. I need to calculate what 20% of $150 is and then subtract that from the total to find out the discounted price.\n\nFirst, let's find 20% of $150.\n\n20% of 150 = 0.20 \u00d7 150 = 30\n\nSo, the discount amount is $30.\n\nNow, subtract the discount from the original total to find the final price.\n\n150 - 30 = 120\n\nTherefore, with the discount, the total cost would be $120.\n\nTo find out how much I save, I need to see the difference between the original total and the discounted total.\n\nOriginal total: $150\n\nDiscounted total: $120\n\nSavings: 150 - 120 = 30\n\nSo, I would save $30.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe in terms of the price per item after discount.\n\nEach item is $15, and with a 20% discount, each item would cost 80% of $15.\n\n80% of 15 = 0.80 \u00d7 15 = 12\n\nSo, each item after discount is $12.\n\nIf I buy 10 items at $12 each, the total would be:\n\n12 \u00d7 10 = 120\n\nWhich matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, to find the savings per item, it's the original price minus the discounted price.\n\n15 - 12 = 3\n\nSo, I save $3 per item.\n\nFor 10 items, the total savings would be:\n\n3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n\nAgain, $30 in total savings.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the total discount percentage on the entire purchase.\n\nBut in this case, it's a flat 20% discount on the total amount, so it's straightforward.\n\nI don't think there are any hidden costs or additional discounts mentioned, so this should be straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if the discount applies only to the items beyond the 5th one.\n\nThe statement says: \"If you buy 5 items or more, you get a 20% discount.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify if the discount is on the entire purchase or only on the items beyond 5.\n\nI think it's on the entire purchase, but maybe I should consider both scenarios.\n\nFirst scenario: discount on the entire purchase.\n\nSecond scenario: discount only on items beyond 5.\n\nLet's explore the second scenario.\n\nIf the discount is only on items beyond 5, then for 10 items, the discount would be on 5 items (since 10 - 5 = 5).\n\nSo, the discount amount would be 20% of the cost of 5 items.\n\nCost of 5 items: 5 \u00d7 15 = 75\n\n20% of 75 = 0.20 \u00d7 75 = 15\n\nSo, the discount amount would be $15.\n\nThen, the total cost would be the original total minus the discount:\n\n150 - 15 = 135\n\nSavings would be 150 - 135 = 15\n\nBut according to the original statement, it seems like the discount is on the entire purchase, not just on the items beyond 5.\n\nThe statement says: \"If you buy 5 items or more, you get a 20% discount.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify that the discount is only on the additional items beyond 5.\n\nTherefore, the first calculation is likely correct, and the savings would be $30.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider the possibility of different interpretations.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see if the discount is per item or on the total purchase.\n\nIf it's a 20% discount on the total purchase, then it's 20% off the entire amount.\n\nIf it's a 20% discount per item, then it's 20% off each item.\n\nIn the first case, the discount is applied to the total sum.\n\nIn the second case, the discount is applied individually to each item.\n\nIn the first scenario, the total discount is 20% of $150, which is $30.\n\nIn the second scenario, each item is discounted by 20%, so each item costs $12, and 10 items would cost $120, saving $30 in total.\n\nSo, both interpretations lead to the same savings of $30.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the savings would be $30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
