        "content": "Yes, Albert Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, but interestingly, the citation specifically mentioned \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.\" The theory of relativity, both special and general, was not explicitly mentioned in the award citation, possibly due to its controversial nature at the time. However, Einstein's work on relativity is undoubtedly one of his most significant contributions to physics."
