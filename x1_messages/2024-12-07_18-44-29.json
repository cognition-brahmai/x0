        "content": "Let's see. There are 12 apples in total, and some are green while others are red. It says that there are twice as many green apples as red apples. Hmm, okay. So, if I let the number of red apples be R, then the number of green apples would be 2R, right? Because it's twice as many.\n\nNow, the total number of apples is red plus green, so that would be R + 2R = 3R. And we know that the total is 12 apples. So, 3R = 12. To find R, I can divide both sides by 3. That gives me R = 4.\n\nSo, there are 4 red apples. Since there are twice as many green apples, that would be 2 times 4, which is 8.\n\nLet me check that. 4 red plus 8 green equals 12 apples, which matches the total. And 8 is indeed twice as many as 4. Perfect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
