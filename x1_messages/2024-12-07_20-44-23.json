        "content": "So I need to find the sum of the series from n equals 1 to infinity of (1/2)^n. Okay, let's see. This looks like an infinite geometric series. I remember that for a geometric series, the sum can be found using the formula S = a / (1 - r), where \"a\" is the first term and \"r\" is the common ratio.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the first term and the common ratio. In this series, each term is (1/2)^n. So, when n=1, the first term is (1/2)^1 = 1/2. The next term is (1/2)^2 = 1/4, then (1/2)^3 = 1/8, and so on. So, the common ratio \"r\" is 1/2, because each term is half of the previous term.\n\nNow, plugging these values into the formula, S = (1/2) / (1 - 1/2) = (1/2) / (1/2) = 1. So, the sum of the series should be 1.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If I add up 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ... and so on to infinity, does it really approach 1? Let's think about it. If I keep adding halves of the remaining amount, I should indeed get closer and closer to 1.\n\nFor example:\n\n- After the first term: 1/2\n\n- After the second term: 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4\n\n- After the third term: 3/4 + 1/8 = 7/8\n\n- After the fourth term: 7/8 + 1/16 = 15/16\n\n- And so on.\n\nEach time, the sum is getting closer to 1, but never quite reaching it. But since it's an infinite series, the sum approaches 1 asymptotically. So, yes, the sum should be 1.\n\nIs there another way to confirm this? Maybe using the concept of limits. The partial sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is S_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r). In this case, a = 1/2 and r = 1/2, so S_n = (1/2) * (1 - (1/2)^n) / (1 - 1/2) = (1/2) * (1 - (1/2)^n) / (1/2) = 1 - (1/2)^n.\n\nNow, as n approaches infinity, (1/2)^n approaches 0, so S_n approaches 1 - 0 = 1. That confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the entire series starting from n=0, which would be S = sum from n=0 to infinity of (1/2)^n. That sum would be S = 1 / (1 - 1/2) = 2. But in this problem, the series starts from n=1, so sum from n=1 to infinity of (1/2)^n = S - (1/2)^0 = 2 - 1 = 1. Again, the same answer.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using calculus or some other advanced method, but I think for a geometric series, the standard formula is sufficient and straightforward.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should make sure that the conditions for the geometric series sum formula are met. The formula S = a / (1 - r) is valid only when the absolute value of r is less than 1, i.e., |r| < 1. In this case, r = 1/2, so |r| = 1/2 < 1, so the formula applies.\n\nAlso, I should note that if |r| >= 1, the series would diverge, meaning the sum would be infinite or undefined. But here, since r = 1/2, it's perfectly fine.\n\nLet me consider if there's a possibility of misinterpretation in the problem. The series is sum from n=1 to infinity of (1/2)^n. Is there any ambiguity in what's being asked? The expression seems clear: for each positive integer n, take (1/2) raised to the power of n, and sum all those terms up to infinity.\n\nWait, perhaps the user wants to see more terms to convince themselves that the sum approaches 1. Let's compute the partial sums for the first few terms:\n\n- S1 = 1/2 = 0.5\n\n- S2 = 1/2 + 1/4 = 0.75\n\n- S3 = 0.75 + 1/8 = 0.875\n\n- S4 = 0.875 + 1/16 = 0.9375\n\n- S5 = 0.9375 + 1/32 = 0.96875\n\n- S6 = 0.96875 + 1/64 = 0.984375\n\n- S7 = 0.984375 + 1/128 = 0.9921875\n\n- and so on.\n\nAs n increases, S_n gets closer and closer to 1. So, in the limit as n approaches infinity, S_n approaches 1.\n\nIs there any chance that the series might sum to something else? For example, if the series was sum from n=1 to infinity of (1/2)^n * some other factor, but in this case, it's just (1/2)^n.\n\nAlternatively, if the base was different, but here it's firmly (1/2).\n\nLet me also consider the sum from n=1 to infinity of r^n, where r = 1/2. The formula S = a / (1 - r) assumes the sum starts from n=0, but since our sum starts from n=1, we need to adjust for that.\n\nAs I thought earlier, sum from n=0 to infinity of r^n = 1 / (1 - r), so sum from n=1 to infinity of r^n = sum from n=0 to infinity of r^n - r^0 = 1 / (1 - r) - 1.\n\nPlugging in r = 1/2:\n\nS = 1 / (1 - 1/2) - 1 = 1 / (1/2) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nSame result again.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways: through the geometric series formula, through partial sums, and through limits. All of these methods lead to the same conclusion that the sum is 1.\n\nIs there any possibility that the sum could be different based on some other interpretation? For example, if the series was sum from n=1 to infinity of (1/2)^n * n, or something like that, but no, the problem specifies just (1/2)^n.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the series converges absolutely. Since all terms are positive and the common ratio is less than 1, the series converges absolutely.\n\nIn conclusion, the sum of the series from n=1 to infinity of (1/2)^n is indeed 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
