        "content": "Let's tackle this marble problem step by step. So, we have a bag with red, blue, and green marbles. The ratios given are:\n\n- The ratio of red to blue marbles is 3:4.\n\n- The ratio of blue to green marbles is 2:5.\n\nAnd the total number of marbles is 99. We need to find out how many marbles of each color there are.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how these ratios relate to each other. We have two separate ratios involving blue marbles, so maybe I can combine them to get a single ratio that includes all three colors.\n\nThe ratio of red to blue is 3:4, and the ratio of blue to green is 2:5. To combine these, I need to make the number of blue marbles in both ratios the same so that I can link them directly.\n\nIn the first ratio, blue is 4 parts, and in the second ratio, blue is 2 parts. To make them compatible, I can multiply the second ratio by 2. That way, blue becomes 4 parts in both ratios.\n\nSo, multiplying the second ratio (blue to green) of 2:5 by 2 gives me 4:10.\n\nNow, both ratios have blue as 4 parts:\n\n- Red to blue: 3:4\n\n- Blue to green: 4:10\n\nSo, combining these, the ratio of red to blue to green is 3:4:10.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me check.\n\nIf red to blue is 3:4 and blue to green is 4:10, then yes, the combined ratio is 3:4:10.\n\nNow, we know the total number of marbles is 99. So, the sum of the parts of the ratio should add up to 99.\n\nLet's add the parts of the ratio:\n\n3 (red) + 4 (blue) + 10 (green) = 17 parts in total.\n\nSo, 17 parts correspond to 99 marbles.\n\nTo find the value of one part, I can divide the total number of marbles by the total number of parts:\n\nOne part = 99 / 17.\n\nHmm, 99 divided by 17. Let's do the division:\n\n17 times 5 is 85.\n\n99 minus 85 is 14.\n\nSo, 17 times 5 is 85, and there's a remainder of 14.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 17 times 5 is indeed 85, and 17 times 5.82 is roughly 99, but that's not exact.\n\nWait, maybe I should check my earlier steps to see if I made a mistake.\n\nLet me revisit the combination of ratios.\n\nWe have red:blue = 3:4 and blue:green = 2:5.\n\nTo combine them, I need to make the blue part the same in both ratios.\n\nAlternatively, I can find a common multiple for the blue part.\n\nIn the first ratio, blue is 4 parts, and in the second, it's 2 parts. The least common multiple of 4 and 2 is 4.\n\nSo, I adjusted the second ratio by multiplying it by 2 to get blue to be 4 parts in both, resulting in blue:green = 4:10.\n\nThen, combining red:blue:green = 3:4:10.\n\nTotal parts: 3 + 4 + 10 = 17.\n\nTotal marbles: 99.\n\nNow, 17 parts correspond to 99 marbles.\n\nSo, one part is 99 / 17.\n\nBut 99 divided by 17 is approximately 5.82, but that doesn't make sense because the number of marbles should be a whole number.\n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake in combining the ratios.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can express all colors in terms of one variable.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of blue marbles as B.\n\nThen, according to the first ratio, red to blue is 3:4, so red = (3/4) * B.\n\nAccording to the second ratio, blue to green is 2:5, so green = (5/2) * B.\n\nNow, the total number of marbles is red + blue + green = (3/4)B + B + (5/2)B = 99.\n\nLet\u2019s combine these terms.\n\nFirst, convert all terms to have the same denominator to make addition easier.\n\nThe denominators are 4 and 2, so the least common denominator is 4.\n\nSo, (3/4)B + B + (5/2)B = (3/4)B + (4/4)B + (10/4)B = (3/4 + 4/4 + 10/4)B = (17/4)B.\n\nSet this equal to the total number of marbles:\n\n(17/4)B = 99.\n\nNow, solve for B:\n\nB = (99 * 4) / 17 = 396 / 17.\n\nWait, 396 divided by 17.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate that:\n\n17 times 23 is 391.\n\n396 minus 391 is 5, so B = 23 and 5/17, which is not a whole number.\n\nBut the number of marbles has to be a whole number, so there must be a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me try yet another approach.\n\nPerhaps I need to find a common multiple for the ratios.\n\nGiven red:blue = 3:4 and blue:green = 2:5.\n\nLet\u2019s express red, blue, and green in terms of a common variable.\n\nLet\u2019s say blue = 4k (from the first ratio).\n\nThen, red = 3k (since red:blue = 3:4).\n\nFrom the second ratio, blue:green = 2:5.\n\nIf blue = 4k, then green = (5/2)*blue = (5/2)*4k = 10k.\n\nSo, red = 3k, blue = 4k, green = 10k.\n\nTotal marbles = 3k + 4k + 10k = 17k = 99.\n\nSo, k = 99 / 17 \u2248 5.82, which again is not a whole number.\n\nThis suggests that there might be an error in the problem setup or in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the ratios might not be directly compatible with the total number of marbles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to scale the ratios so that the total number of parts divides evenly into 99.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf red:blue = 3:4 and blue:green = 2:5, then red:blue:green = 3:4:10, as I did earlier.\n\nTotal parts: 3 + 4 + 10 = 17.\n\nNow, 17k = 99 implies k = 99/17, which is not an integer.\n\nBut the number of marbles must be integers, so perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to find a different way to interpret the ratios.\n\nLet me try to find the least common multiple of the parts.\n\nIn the first ratio, red:blue = 3:4.\n\nIn the second ratio, blue:green = 2:5.\n\nTo combine these, I need to express blue in terms that are compatible.\n\nThe blue part in the first ratio is 4, and in the second is 2.\n\nThe least common multiple of 4 and 2 is 4.\n\nSo, I can scale the second ratio so that blue is 4 in both.\n\nOriginal second ratio is blue:green = 2:5.\n\nTo make blue = 4, multiply both parts by 2: blue:green = 4:10.\n\nNow, the combined ratio is red:blue:green = 3:4:10.\n\nTotal parts: 3 + 4 + 10 = 17.\n\nTotal marbles: 99.\n\nSo, 17 parts correspond to 99 marbles.\n\nThus, one part is 99 / 17 \u2248 5.82, which is not an integer.\n\nBut marbles can't be fractions, so perhaps there's a mistake in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to find a different approach.\n\nLet me try setting up equations.\n\nLet R be the number of red marbles, B be blue, and G be green.\n\nGiven:\n\n1. R / B = 3 / 4 => R = (3/4) * B\n\n2. B / G = 2 / 5 => G = (5/2) * B\n\nAnd R + B + G = 99.\n\nSubstitute R and G in terms of B:\n\n(3/4)B + B + (5/2)B = 99.\n\nTo combine these, find a common denominator, which is 4:\n\n(3/4)B + (4/4)B + (10/4)B = 99.\n\n(3 + 4 + 10)/4 * B = 99.\n\n17/4 * B = 99.\n\nSo, B = (99 * 4) / 17 = 396 / 17 \u2248 23.30.\n\nAgain, not an integer.\n\nThis suggests that with the given ratios and total marbles, the numbers don't work out to be whole numbers.\n\nBut perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculation.\n\nLet me check the arithmetic again.\n\n17/4 * B = 99.\n\nSo, B = (99 * 4) / 17 = 396 / 17.\n\nCalculating 396 divided by 17:\n\n17 * 23 = 391.\n\n396 - 391 = 5.\n\nSo, B = 23 + 5/17, which is not a whole number.\n\nThis suggests that there is an issue with the problem as stated, because the number of marbles should be whole numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the ratios can be scaled differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find a common multiple for the ratios.\n\nFrom red:blue = 3:4 and blue:green = 2:5.\n\nLet me express blue in terms that are compatible.\n\nIf blue is 4 in the first ratio and 2 in the second, I can scale the second ratio by 2 to make blue 4 in both.\n\nSo, blue:green = 2:5 becomes 4:10.\n\nThus, the combined ratio is red:blue:green = 3:4:10.\n\nTotal parts: 3 + 4 + 10 = 17.\n\nNow, if the total number of marbles is 99, and 17 parts don't divide evenly into 99, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratios are meant to be interpreted differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratios are not to be taken directly but as multiples.\n\nLet me assume that the number of red marbles is 3k, blue is 4k, and green is 10k, for some integer k.\n\nThen, 3k + 4k + 10k = 17k = 99.\n\nSo, k = 99 / 17, which is not an integer.\n\nTherefore, there is no integer solution for k, which suggests that the problem has no solution with whole numbers of marbles.\n\nBut this seems odd because typically such problems are set up to have integer solutions.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratios are to be interpreted differently.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSuppose I consider the ratios as fractions.\n\nGiven red:blue = 3:4, and blue:green = 2:5.\n\nLet me find the ratio of red to green indirectly.\n\nIf red:blue is 3:4, and blue:green is 2:5, then red:green can be found by multiplying the two ratios.\n\nWait, to find red to green, I can do (red/blue) * (blue/green) = red/green.\n\nGiven red/blue = 3/4 and blue/green = 2/5.\n\nSo, red/green = (3/4) * (2/5) = 6/20 = 3/10.\n\nTherefore, red:green = 3:10.\n\nBut I already have blue in terms of red and green.\n\nWait, perhaps I should express all in terms of red.\n\nLet me denote red as R.\n\nThen, from red:blue = 3:4, blue = (4/3)R.\n\nFrom blue:green = 2:5, green = (5/2)blue = (5/2)*(4/3)R = (20/6)R = (10/3)R.\n\nNow, total marbles: R + (4/3)R + (10/3)R = R + (4/3)R + (10/3)R = (3/3)R + (4/3)R + (10/3)R = (17/3)R = 99.\n\nSo, R = (99 * 3) / 17 = 297 / 17 \u2248 17.47, which again is not an integer.\n\nThis confirms that there is no integer solution for R, which means the problem has no solution with whole numbers of marbles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratios are meant to be red:blue = 3:4 and blue:green = 2:5, but interpreted differently.\n\nWait, maybe the ratios are not directly compatible, and I need to find a common multiple for blue in both ratios.\n\nLet me try to scale the ratios so that the number of blue marbles is the same in both ratios.\n\nGiven red:blue = 3:4 and blue:green = 2:5.\n\nTo make blue the same in both, I can express both ratios with blue as 4 parts.\n\nSo, red:blue = 3:4 remains the same.\n\nBlue:green = 2:5 can be scaled by 2 to make blue = 4: green = 10.\n\nSo, red:blue:green = 3:4:10.\n\nTotal parts: 3 + 4 + 10 = 17.\n\nTotal marbles: 99.\n\n17 parts = 99 marbles.\n\nOne part = 99 / 17 \u2248 5.82, which is not an integer.\n\nTherefore, it seems there is no integer solution, which suggests a mistake in the problem or in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of marbles is not 99, or perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the ratios.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the ratios are not exact, but approximate, and look for the closest integer values.\n\nIf one part is approximately 5.82, then:\n\nRed = 3 * 5.82 \u2248 17.47, say 17 marbles.\n\nBlue = 4 * 5.82 \u2248 23.28, say 23 marbles.\n\nGreen = 10 * 5.82 \u2248 58.2, say 58 marbles.\n\nTotal: 17 + 23 + 58 = 98, which is one less than 99.\n\nAlternatively, round up:\n\nRed = 18, blue = 23, green = 58: total 99.\n\nBut let's check if these satisfy the original ratios.\n\nRed to blue: 18:23, which is not exactly 3:4.\n\nBecause 3:4 would be 18:24, but here it's 18:23, which is close but not exact.\n\nSimilarly, blue to green: 23:58.\n\nThe ratio should be 2:5, which would be 23:57.5, approximately.\n\nBut again, not exact.\n\nSo, while this gets close to the total of 99 marbles, the ratios aren't exactly satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approximate.\n\nIf I take one part as 6 (rounding 5.82 up):\n\nRed = 3 * 6 = 18.\n\nBlue = 4 * 6 = 24.\n\nGreen = 10 * 6 = 60.\n\nTotal: 18 + 24 + 60 = 102, which is 3 more than 99.\n\nThis is worse in terms of total.\n\nAlternatively, try one part as 5:\n\nRed = 3 * 5 = 15.\n\nBlue = 4 * 5 = 20.\n\nGreen = 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nTotal: 15 + 20 + 50 = 85, which is 14 less than 99.\n\nSo, this is further off.\n\nIt seems that neither rounding up nor down gives us exactly 99 marbles while maintaining the ratios.\n\nThis suggests that with the given ratios, it's not possible to have exactly 99 marbles in total with whole numbers for each color.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that there is no solution to this problem with integer values for the number of marbles.\n\nPerhaps there's a typo in the problem, or maybe fractional marbles are acceptable, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach I haven't considered.\n\nLet me try to set up the problem using algebra.\n\nLet R be the number of red marbles, B be the number of blue marbles, and G be the number of green marbles.\n\nGiven:\n\n1. R / B = 3 / 4 => R = (3/4)B\n\n2. B / G = 2 / 5 => G = (5/2)B\n\nAnd R + B + G = 99.\n\nSubstitute R and G in terms of B:\n\n(3/4)B + B + (5/2)B = 99.\n\nTo combine these terms, find a common denominator, which is 4:\n\n(3/4)B + (4/4)B + (10/4)B = 99.\n\n(3 + 4 + 10)/4 B = 99.\n\n17/4 B = 99.\n\nSo, B = (99 * 4) / 17 = 396 / 17 \u2248 23.30.\n\nAgain, not an integer.\n\nThis confirms my earlier conclusion.\n\nTherefore, I believe there is no solution to this problem with whole numbers of marbles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{No solution with whole numbers}} \\]"
