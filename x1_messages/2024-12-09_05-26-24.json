        "content": "So the company is growing at 5% every year, and right now, it makes $500,000 a year. We want to know what that will be in 4 years, right?\n\nFirst, I need to remember how to calculate growth over multiple years. I think it has something to do with compound interest, or something similar, because the growth is happening each year on the new amount.\n\nSo, the formula for compound growth is something like:\n\nFuture Value = Present Value * (1 + growth rate)^number of periods\n\nIn this case, the present value is $500,000, the growth rate is 5%, and the number of periods is 4 years.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nFuture Value = $500,000 * (1 + 0.05)^4\n\nI need to calculate (1 + 0.05)^4. That's 1.05 to the power of 4.\n\nLet me see, 1.05 times 1.05 is 1.1025.\n\nThen, 1.1025 times 1.05 is 1.157625.\n\nAnd then, 1.157625 times 1.05 is approximately 1.21550625.\n\nSo, the future value is $500,000 multiplied by about 1.2155.\n\nLet me do that multiplication:\n\n$500,000 * 1.2155 = $607,750.\n\nSo, in 4 years, the company's revenue should be approximately $607,750.\n\nBut I should check if there's a simpler way to estimate this without doing all those multiplications.\n\nI recall there's something called the rule of 72 or something like that, but I think that's for doubling time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the simple interest formula, but I don't think that's accurate for growth over multiple years.\n\nWait, simple interest would just be $500,000 plus 5% of $500,000 for each year, so that's $25,000 per year.\n\nOver 4 years, that would be $100,000, making the total $600,000.\n\nBut I know that's not exactly correct because it doesn't account for the compound growth.\n\nComparing that to the earlier calculation of $607,750, there's a difference of $7,750.\n\nSo, maybe for a rough estimate, using simple interest is okay, but for a more accurate figure, I should use the compound growth formula.\n\nAlso, I should consider if the growth is compounded annually. I think in this case, it is, since it's an annual growth rate.\n\nBut just to be sure, if the growth was compounded more frequently, like quarterly or monthly, the formula would be different.\n\nBut since it's annual, I think the formula I used is appropriate.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the growth rate is constant every year.\n\nIf there are fluctuations or if the growth rate changes each year, then the calculation would be more complex.\n\nBut based on the information given, the growth rate is a steady 5% per year.\n\nSo, sticking with the compound growth formula is probably the best approach.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with $500,000.\n\nYear 1: $500,000 * 1.05 = $525,000.\n\nYear 2: $525,000 * 1.05 = $551,250.\n\nYear 3: $551,250 * 1.05 = $578,812.50.\n\nYear 4: $578,812.50 * 1.05 = $607,753.125.\n\nRounding that to the nearest dollar gives $607,753.\n\nSo, my initial calculation was close, but actually, it's $607,753.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nFuture Value = Present Value * (1 + growth rate)^number of periods\n\nFuture Value = $500,000 * (1.05)^4\n\nCalculating (1.05)^4:\n\n1.05^2 = 1.1025\n\n1.1025 * 1.05 = 1.157625\n\n1.157625 * 1.05 = 1.21550625\n\nThen, $500,000 * 1.21550625 = $607,753.125.\n\nAgain, $607,753.\n\nSo, I'm confident that's the correct future value after 4 years.\n\nBut the question asks for an approximate revenue, so maybe there's a simpler way to estimate this without doing all the multiplication.\n\nOne method is to use the rule of 72, but again, that's for doubling time, which isn't directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the binomial expansion for a rough estimate.\n\n(1 + 0.05)^4 is approximately 1 + 4*0.05 + (4*3)/2 * 0.05^2 = 1 + 0.2 + 0.015 = 1.215.\n\nThen, $500,000 * 1.215 = $607,500.\n\nThat's very close to the exact calculation of $607,753.\n\nSo, for approximation purposes, using the binomial expansion can save time.\n\nAnother way is to use the rule of 69 or continuous compounding, but that might be overkill for this scenario.\n\nGiven that, I think using the compound growth formula is the most straightforward approach.\n\nTherefore, the company's revenue in 4 years will be approximately $607,753.\n\nBut since the question says \"approximate,\" maybe rounding to the nearest thousand or million is acceptable.\n\nIn that case, $608,000 or simply $607,753.\n\nI think providing the exact calculated figure is fine for accuracy.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately $607,753.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{607753} \\]"
