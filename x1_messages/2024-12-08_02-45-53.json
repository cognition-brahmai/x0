        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains leaving the same station but at different times and going in opposite directions. The first train leaves at 9 AM going east at 60 mph, and the second train leaves at 10 AM going west at 40 mph. We need to find out when they will be 300 miles apart.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how far each train has traveled by any given time. Since they're going in opposite directions, the distance between them will be the sum of the distances each has traveled.\n\nLet's denote the time after 9 AM as t hours. So, at time t, the first train has been traveling for t hours at 60 mph, so its distance is 60t miles.\n\nThe second train leaves at 10 AM, which is one hour after the first train. So, the second train has been traveling for (t - 1) hours at 40 mph, assuming t >= 1. Its distance is 40(t - 1) miles.\n\nThe total distance between them is the sum of these distances: 60t + 40(t - 1).\n\nWe need this sum to be 300 miles: 60t + 40(t - 1) = 300.\n\nLet me solve for t:\n\n60t + 40t - 40 = 300\n\n100t - 40 = 300\n\n100t = 340\n\nt = 3.4 hours.\n\nNow, 3.4 hours is 3 hours and 0.4 of an hour. Since 0.4 hours is 24 minutes (because 0.4 * 60 = 24), t is 3 hours and 24 minutes.\n\nSince t is the time after 9 AM, the time when they are 300 miles apart is 9:00 AM + 3 hours 24 minutes, which is 12:24 PM.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should consider the direction they're traveling in.\n\nSince they're going in opposite directions, yes, the total distance is just the sum of their individual distances.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of their relative speed. If one is going east at 60 mph and the other west at 40 mph, their relative speed is 60 + 40 = 100 mph.\n\nBut, since the second train leaves an hour later, I need to account for that.\n\nIn the first hour, from 9 AM to 10 AM, only the first train is moving, covering 60 miles.\n\nAfter 10 AM, both trains are moving, separating at 100 mph.\n\nSo, at 10 AM, they're already 60 miles apart.\n\nWe need the total distance to be 300 miles, so the additional distance needed is 300 - 60 = 240 miles.\n\nAt a relative speed of 100 mph, the time to cover 240 miles is 2.4 hours.\n\nSo, 2.4 hours after 10 AM is 10:00 AM + 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 12:24 PM.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12:24 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12:24 \\text{ PM}} \\]\n"
