        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to write a function in Python that computes the square root of a number without using any built-in functions. Okay, so no math.sqrt or anything like that. Hmm, how to approach this?\n\nI remember from math class that there's something called the \" Babylonian method \" or \" Heron's method \" for finding square roots. It's an iterative method that starts with an initial guess and then refines that guess repeatedly until it gets close to the actual square root. Sounds promising.\n\nSo, the Babylonian method works like this:\n\n1. Start with an initial guess for the square root. Let's call this guess.\n\n2. Improve the guess by averaging it with the number divided by the guess: new_guess = (guess + number / guess) / 2.\n\n3. Repeat step 2 until the guess is good enough, meaning the difference between new_guess and guess is very small.\n\nThat makes sense. I need to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, I need to define the function. Let's call it `sqrt` and have it take one parameter, the number we want to find the square root of.\n\nNext, I need to handle some edge cases. For example, if the number is negative, square roots of negative numbers are not real, so maybe I should return an error or a message for that. If the number is zero, well, the square root of zero is zero.\n\nSo, in the function, I'll check if the number is less than zero, and if so, maybe raise an exception or return None.\n\nFor positive numbers, I'll implement the Babylonian method.\n\nI need to decide when to stop iterating. I can set a small tolerance value, and stop when the difference between new_guess and guess is less than this tolerance.\n\nLet's think about the initial guess. A common choice is to start with the number itself or maybe half of the number. But I recall that starting with the number itself might converge faster than starting with half the number.\n\nAlso, to avoid infinite loops, I should set a maximum number of iterations, just in case the method doesn't converge for some reason.\n\nOkay, let's sketch out the steps in code:\n\n- If number < 0, raise ValueError or return None.\n\n- If number is 0, return 0.\n\n- Set an initial guess, maybe guess = number.\n\n- Set a tolerance, like 1e-10.\n\n- Set a maximum number of iterations, say 1000.\n\n- Start a loop:\n\n- Calculate new_guess = (guess + number / guess) / 2\n\n- If abs(new_guess - guess) < tolerance, break the loop.\n\n- Set guess = new_guess\n\n- After the loop, return new_guess.\n\nThat seems straightforward. I should also think about floating-point precision and make sure that the tolerance is appropriate.\n\nLet me try to write a draft of this function.\n\n```python\n\ndef sqrt(number):\n\nif number < 0:\n\nraise ValueError(\"Cannot compute square root of a negative number.\")\n\nelif number == 0:\n\nreturn 0\n\nelse:\n\nguess = number\n\ntolerance = 1e-10\n\nmax_iterations = 1000\n\nfor _ in range(max_iterations):\n\nnew_guess = (guess + number / guess) / 2\n\nif abs(new_guess - guess) < tolerance:\n\nbreak\n\nguess = new_guess\n\nreturn new_guess\n\n```\n\nAlright, that looks pretty good. Let me test this function with some values to see if it works.\n\nFirst, sqrt(4). The actual square root is 2.\n\nLet's compute it:\n\n- Initial guess: 4\n\n- new_guess = (4 + 4/4)/2 = (4 + 1)/2 = 2.5\n\n- difference: |2.5 - 4| = 1.5, which is greater than 1e-10\n\n- Set guess to 2.5\n\n- new_guess = (2.5 + 4/2.5)/2 = (2.5 + 1.6)/2 = 2.05\n\n- difference: |2.05 - 2.5| = 0.45, still greater than 1e-10\n\n- Set guess to 2.05\n\n- new_guess = (2.05 + 4/2.05)/2 \u2248 (2.05 + 1.95)/2 = 2\n\n- difference: |2 - 2.05| = 0.05, still greater than 1e-10\n\n- Set guess to 2\n\n- new_guess = (2 + 4/2)/2 = (2 + 2)/2 = 2\n\n- difference: |2 - 2| = 0, which is less than 1e-10, so stop.\n\n- Return 2\n\nPerfect, that matches the actual square root.\n\nLet me try sqrt(2), which is approximately 1.41421356237.\n\nUsing the function:\n\n- Initial guess: 2\n\n- new_guess = (2 + 2/2)/2 = (2 + 1)/2 = 1.5\n\n- difference: |1.5 - 2| = 0.5\n\n- Set guess to 1.5\n\n- new_guess = (1.5 + 2/1.5)/2 \u2248 (1.5 + 1.33333333333)/2 \u2248 1.41666666666\n\n- difference: |1.41666666666 - 1.5| \u2248 0.08333333334\n\n- Set guess to 1.41666666666\n\n- new_guess = (1.41666666666 + 2/1.41666666666)/2 \u2248 (1.41666666666 + 1.41176470588)/2 \u2248 1.41421569626\n\n- difference: |1.41421569626 - 1.41666666666| \u2248 0.0024509704\n\n- Set guess to 1.41421569626\n\n- new_guess = (1.41421569626 + 2/1.41421569626)/2 \u2248 (1.41421569626 + 1.41421356237)/2 \u2248 1.41421462932\n\n- difference: |1.41421462932 - 1.41421569626| \u2248 1.06694e-6\n\n- Continue this process until the difference is less than 1e-10\n\n- After a few more iterations, it should converge to approximately 1.41421356237\n\nLooks good.\n\nNow, let's try sqrt(0), which should return 0.\n\n- Directly return 0, as per the function.\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnd sqrt(-1), which should raise a ValueError.\n\n- Raises ValueError with message \"Cannot compute square root of a negative number.\"\n\nThat's correct.\n\nI think this function should work well for computing square roots without using any built-in functions.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo compute the square root of a number without using any built-in functions, we can implement the Babylonian method (also known as Heron's method). This method uses an iterative approach to refine an initial guess until it converges to the square root value.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Check**: \n    - If the input number is negative, raise a `ValueError` since square roots of negative numbers are not real.\n    - If the input number is zero, return zero immediately as the square root of zero is zero.\n\n2. **Initial Guess**:\n    - Start with an initial guess for the square root set to the number itself.\n\n3. **Iteration**:\n    - Use a loop to iteratively refine the guess using the formula: \n      \\[\n      \\text{new\\_guess} = \\frac{\\text{guess} + \\frac{\\text{number}}{\\text{guess}}}{2}\n      \\]\n    - Continue iterating until the difference between the new guess and the old guess is less than a predefined tolerance (e.g., \\(1 \\times 10^{-10}\\)), indicating sufficient accuracy.\n    - To prevent infinite loops, set a maximum number of iterations.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n    - Once the loop terminates, return the refined guess as the square root.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef sqrt(number):\n    if number < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot compute square root of a negative number.\")\n    elif number == 0:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        guess = number\n        tolerance = 1e-10\n        max_iterations = 1000\n        for _ in range(max_iterations):\n            new_guess = (guess + number / guess) / 2\n            if abs(new_guess - guess) < tolerance:\n                break\n            guess = new_guess\n        return new_guess\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initial Guess**: We start with an initial guess set to the number itself.\n- **Convergence Check**: We use a tolerance level to check if the guess has converged to the square root value.\n- **Iteration Control**: A maximum number of iterations is set to prevent infinite loops in case of non-convergence.\n- **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as zero and negative numbers appropriately.\n\nThis method is efficient and provides a precise square root value without relying on built-in functions."
