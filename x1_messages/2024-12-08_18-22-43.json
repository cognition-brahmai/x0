        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 units of product A each day and sells each unit for $30. The cost to produce one unit is $10. We need to find out the profit after selling the entire production for 25 days.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the daily profit and then multiply it by 25 days. Or, I could calculate the total revenue and total cost over 25 days and then find the difference. Either way should work.\n\nLet me try the first approach: calculating daily profit and then multiplying by 25.\n\nSo, daily profit would be the revenue per day minus the cost per day.\n\nRevenue per day is the number of units produced per day times the selling price per unit. That would be 500 units/day * $30/unit = $15,000/day.\n\nCost per day is the number of units produced per day times the cost per unit. That's 500 units/day * $10/unit = $5,000/day.\n\nSo, daily profit is $15,000 - $5,000 = $10,000/day.\n\nNow, over 25 days, the total profit would be $10,000/day * 25 days = $250,000.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Maybe I should check it with the other approach to make sure.\n\nAlright, second approach: total revenue over 25 days minus total cost over 25 days.\n\nFirst, total units produced in 25 days: 500 units/day * 25 days = 12,500 units.\n\nTotal revenue: 12,500 units * $30/unit = $375,000.\n\nTotal cost: 12,500 units * $10/unit = $125,000.\n\nProfit: $375,000 - $125,000 = $250,000.\n\nOkay, both approaches give the same answer, which is $250,000.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{250000} \\]"
