        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is:\n\n((7 - 2)^2 + (9 / 3) - 1) * 4\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n7 - 2 = 5\n\nNow, raise that to the power of 2:\n\n5^2 = 25\n\nNext, handle the division:\n\n9 / 3 = 3\n\nNow, plug those back into the expression:\n\n(25 + 3 - 1) * 4\n\nNow, do the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n\n25 + 3 = 28\n\n28 - 1 = 27\n\nNow, multiply by 4:\n\n27 * 4 = 108\n\nSo, the final answer is 108.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{108} \\]"
