        "content": "Let's see. So, in this school, 60% of students play soccer, 40% play basketball, and 20% play both sports. I need to find out what percentage of students don't play any sport.\n\nHmm, I think I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. You know, where you add the percentages of students who play each sport and then subtract the percentage that plays both, to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, first, 60% play soccer and 40% play basketball. If I add those up, that's 100%. But wait, that can't be right because some students play both sports. So, I need to subtract the percentage that plays both.\n\nSo, 60% + 40% = 100%, and then subtract the 20% who play both, that gives me 80%. So, 80% of students play at least one of the sports.\n\nBut the question is asking for the percentage who don't play any sport. So, if 80% play at least one sport, then the remaining percentage must not play any sport.\n\nSo, 100% - 80% = 20%.\n\nTherefore, 20% of students do not play any sport.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf 60% play soccer and 40% play basketball, and 20% play both, then the total percentage of students involved in at least one sport is 60% + 40% - 20% = 80%.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of sets. Let\u2019s say the total number of students is 100 for simplicity.\n\nSo, 60 students play soccer, 40 play basketball, and 20 play both.\n\nBut the 20 who play both are included in both the soccer and basketball groups, so to find the total number of students who play at least one sport, I add the soccer and basketball players and subtract those who are counted in both.\n\nSo, 60 + 40 - 20 = 80 students play at least one sport.\n\nTherefore, out of 100 students, 80 play at least one sport, which means 20 do not play any sport.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a Venn diagram to visualize this.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents soccer players, and the other represents basketball players.\n\nThe soccer circle has 60%, the basketball circle has 40%, and the overlapping area, where students play both sports, is 20%.\n\nTo find the total percentage of students who play at least one sport, I add the unique parts of each circle and the overlapping part.\n\nSo, students who only play soccer: 60% - 20% = 40%\n\nStudents who only play basketball: 40% - 20% = 20%\n\nStudents who play both: 20%\n\nAdding those up: 40% + 20% + 20% = 80%\n\nAgain, 80% play at least one sport, so 20% do not play any sport.\n\nI think this is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nMaybe using probabilities or some other formula.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nS = event that a student plays soccer\n\nB = event that a student plays basketball\n\nWe are given:\n\nP(S) = 60%\n\nP(B) = 40%\n\nP(S and B) = 20%\n\nWe need to find the percentage of students who do not play any sport, which is P(neither S nor B).\n\nWe know that P(S or B) = P(S) + P(B) - P(S and B)\n\nSo, P(S or B) = 60% + 40% - 20% = 80%\n\nThen, P(neither S nor B) = 100% - P(S or B) = 100% - 80% = 20%\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think it's clear now. The percentage of students who do not play any sport is 20%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20\\%} \\]"
