        "content": "So, let's break this down. We have a factory that produces two different products: product A and product B. Every day, it makes 500 units of product A, and each of those sells for $20. Additionally, it makes 300 units of product B, each selling for $30. We need to find out the total revenue generated from both products in one week.\n\nFirst, I think I should calculate the daily revenue for each product and then sum them up to get the total daily revenue. After that, I can multiply the total daily revenue by the number of days in a week to get the weekly revenue.\n\nSo, for product A:\n\nNumber of units produced per day = 500\n\nSelling price per unit = $20\n\nDaily revenue from product A = 500 units * $20/unit = $10,000\n\nSimilarly, for product B:\n\nNumber of units produced per day = 300\n\nSelling price per unit = $30\n\nDaily revenue from product B = 300 units * $30/unit = $9,000\n\nNow, total daily revenue from both products = revenue from A + revenue from B = $10,000 + $9,000 = $19,000\n\nSince we need to find the weekly revenue, and assuming a week has 7 days, we can multiply the daily revenue by 7.\n\nWeekly revenue = total daily revenue * 7 days = $19,000/day * 7 days = $133,000\n\nWait a minute, does the factory operate every day of the week? Or does it have weekends off? I think I should confirm if the factory operates 7 days a week.\n\nLooking back at the problem, it says \"per day,\" but it doesn't specify if it's just weekdays or includes weekends as well. To be safe, I'll assume it operates 7 days a week unless stated otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a standard 5-day workweek, then I should adjust the calculation accordingly.\n\nLet me check: the problem says \"per day,\" and it's about a factory, which might operate on weekends as well. But to be precise, I should consider both scenarios.\n\nFirst scenario: factory operates 7 days a week.\n\nWeekly revenue = $19,000/day * 7 days = $133,000\n\nSecond scenario: factory operates 5 days a week.\n\nWeekly revenue = $19,000/day * 5 days = $95,000\n\nBut since the problem says \"per day\" without specifying, and it's a factory, which often run continuously, I'll stick with the 7-day calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total revenue generated by the factory in one week from both products is $133,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{133000} \\]"
