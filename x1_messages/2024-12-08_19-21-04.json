        "content": "So I've got this problem here about building a fence around a rectangular garden. The garden is 30 feet long and 20 feet wide, and I need to put up fence posts every 5 feet around the entire perimeter. I need to figure out how many posts I'll need in total.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate the perimeter of the garden since the fence is going around it. For a rectangle, the perimeter P is given by the formula:\n\nP = 2 * (length + width)\n\nPlugging in the given dimensions:\n\nP = 2 * (30 feet + 20 feet) = 2 * 50 feet = 100 feet\n\nSo, the total perimeter is 100 feet.\n\nNow, if I'm placing posts every 5 feet, I can find the number of posts by dividing the total perimeter by the distance between posts. So:\n\nNumber of posts = Perimeter / Distance between posts = 100 feet / 5 feet = 20 posts\n\nWait a minute, but this seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. When you place posts around a closed shape like a rectangle, the first post and the last post will coincide, meaning the first post also serves as the last post. So, in a closed loop, you might need one less post than the number you get from simply dividing the perimeter by the interval.\n\nLet me consider that. If I have a perimeter of 100 feet and posts every 5 feet, that's 100 / 5 = 20 intervals. But since it's a closed loop, the number of posts should be equal to the number of intervals, because the first post is also the last post.\n\nHmm, but that doesn't make sense because if I have 20 intervals, I should have 21 posts to cover those intervals. Wait, let's think about it differently. Imagine a straight line: if I have intervals of 5 feet, for a length of 10 feet, I would have posts at 0 feet, 5 feet, and 10 feet, which is 3 posts and 2 intervals. So, in general, number of posts = number of intervals + 1.\n\nBut in a closed loop, the first and last posts are the same, so the formula should be number of posts = number of intervals. In this case, 20 intervals would mean 20 posts.\n\nLet me try to visualize it. Let's take one side of the rectangle, say the length of 30 feet. If I place posts every 5 feet, starting from one end, I would have posts at 0 feet, 5 feet, 10 feet, 15 feet, 20 feet, 25 feet, and 30 feet. That's 7 posts for each length side.\n\nSimilarly, for the width of 20 feet, posts at 0 feet, 5 feet, 10 feet, 15 feet, and 20 feet. That's 5 posts for each width side.\n\nNow, at the corners, the posts are shared by two sides. So, if I just add up the posts on all four sides, I would be double-counting the corner posts.\n\nLet's calculate total posts without considering shared corners:\n\nTwo lengths: 2 * 7 = 14 posts\n\nTwo widths: 2 * 5 = 10 posts\n\nTotal: 14 + 10 = 24 posts\n\nBut since the four corner posts are shared, we've counted each corner post twice. There are four corners, so we've double-counted 4 posts. Therefore, we need to subtract the extra counts:\n\nTotal posts needed = 24 - 4 = 20 posts\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation of perimeter / interval = 100 / 5 = 20 posts.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of intervals: 100 feet perimeter divided by 5 feet intervals equals 20 intervals, and in a closed loop, the number of posts equals the number of intervals.\n\nSo, both methods lead to 20 posts.\n\nBut let me consider another way to confirm. Let's calculate the number of posts per side, considering the shared corners.\n\nLength sides: each has 7 posts, but the two corner posts are shared with the width sides.\n\nWidth sides: each has 5 posts, but the two corner posts are shared with the length sides.\n\nSo, for two length sides: 2 * 7 = 14 posts, but subtract the 4 shared corners: 14 - 4 = 10 posts.\n\nFor two width sides: 2 * 5 = 10 posts, subtract the 4 shared corners: 10 - 4 = 6 posts.\n\nTotal posts: 10 + 6 = 16 posts.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. I must be miscalculating the shared posts.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Let's calculate the number of posts along one side, subtracting the shared corners.\n\nFor the length sides:\n\n- Each length has 7 posts, including the two corner posts.\n\n- Since the corner posts are shared, when adding both length sides, the two corner posts should not be double-counted.\n\n- Therefore, for two length sides: 7 + 7 - 2 = 12 posts.\n\nSimilarly, for the width sides:\n\n- Each width has 5 posts, including the two corner posts.\n\n- Again, the corner posts are shared, so adding both width sides: 5 + 5 - 2 = 8 posts.\n\nTotal posts: 12 (from lengths) + 8 (from widths) = 20 posts.\n\nThis again confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the perimeter is 100 feet, and posts are every 5 feet, 100 / 5 = 20 posts.\n\nI think 20 posts is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about actually placing the posts.\n\nStarting at one corner, place a post at 0 feet.\n\nThen, every 5 feet along the perimeter:\n\n0 ft (corner), 5 ft, 10 ft, 15 ft, 20 ft, 25 ft, 30 ft (end of length),\n\nthen continue along the width: 35 ft, 40 ft, 45 ft, 50 ft (end of width),\n\nthen along the other length: 55 ft, 60 ft, 65 ft, 70 ft, 75 ft, 80 ft (end of length),\n\nthen along the last width: 85 ft, 90 ft, 95 ft, 100 ft (back to starting corner).\n\nSo, posts at:\n\n0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100 feet.\n\nWait, that's 21 posts, but 100 feet divided by 5 feet is 20 intervals, so is it 20 posts or 21 posts?\n\nThis is confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIn a straight line, for a length of 30 feet with posts every 5 feet:\n\nPosts at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 feet: that's 7 posts and 6 intervals.\n\nWait, but in a closed loop, the number of intervals equals the number of posts.\n\nIn this case, perimeter is 100 feet, intervals of 5 feet: 100 / 5 = 20 intervals, hence 20 posts.\n\nBut in the listing above, I have posts at 0 and 100 feet, which are the same post in a closed loop.\n\nSo, in reality, the post at 0/100 feet is only one post.\n\nTherefore, even though I listed 21 posts, the first and last are the same, so it's actually 20 posts.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the correct number of posts needed is 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
