        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company with 100 employees in total, and these employees are either managers or workers. The ratio of managers to workers is given as 1:9. Okay, so first things first, I need to understand what this ratio means.\n\nA ratio of 1:9 means that for every 1 manager, there are 9 workers. So, in terms of parts, managers make up 1 part and workers make up 9 parts, right? That means together, they make up 1 + 9 = 10 parts in total.\n\nNow, since there are 100 employees in total, each part must represent 100 divided by 10, which is 10 employees per part.\n\nSo, if managers are 1 part, that would be 1 times 10, which is 10 managers. And workers are 9 parts, so 9 times 10 equals 90 workers.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the ratio to set up equations. Let\u2019s denote the number of managers as M and the number of workers as W. We know that M + W = 100, because there are 100 employees in total.\n\nWe also know that the ratio of managers to workers is 1:9, which can be written as M/W = 1/9.\n\nSo, from M/W = 1/9, we can cross-multiply to get 9M = W.\n\nNow, substituting W from this equation into the first equation:\n\nM + 9M = 100\n\nThat gives us 10M = 100\n\nSo, M = 100 / 10 = 10\n\nThen, W = 9M = 9 * 10 = 90\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier. So, there are 10 managers and 90 workers.\n\nLet me just make sure that the ratio is indeed 1:9.\n\nIf there are 10 managers and 90 workers, then the ratio is 10:90, which simplifies to 1:9 when both sides are divided by 10.\n\nPerfect, that checks out.\n\nAnother way to think about it is in terms of fractions. Since managers are 1 part out of 10 total parts, the fraction of employees who are managers is 1/10. Similarly, workers are 9/10 of the employees.\n\nSo, 1/10 of 100 is 10 managers, and 9/10 of 100 is 90 workers.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion, which is a good sign that I\u2019ve got the right answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let\u2019s consider if there\u2019s any other interpretation of the ratio.\n\nSometimes ratios can be tricky, but in this case, it\u2019s pretty straightforward. The ratio 1:9 clearly indicates that for every manager, there are nine workers.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s room for misinterpretation here.\n\nSo, to sum it up, there are 10 managers and 90 workers in the company.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ managers and } 90 \\text{ workers}} \\]"
