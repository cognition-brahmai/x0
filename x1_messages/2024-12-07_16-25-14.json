        "content": "So there's this problem about fruits in a bag, and I need to find the probability of picking either an apple or a banana. Let's see, there are 5 apples, 7 oranges, and 4 bananas. First, I should probably figure out the total number of fruits in the bag.\n\nSo, total fruits = apples + oranges + bananas = 5 + 7 + 4 = 16 fruits.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability of picking an apple or a banana. Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either an apple or a banana. So, number of favorable outcomes = number of apples + number of bananas = 5 + 4 = 9.\n\nTherefore, the probability P should be P = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 9/16.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the addition rule of probability. The addition rule says that the probability of A or B is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).\n\nIn this scenario, A could be picking an apple, and B could be picking a banana. Since you can't pick both at the same time in a single pick, P(A and B) should be zero, right? So, P(apple or banana) = P(apple) + P(banana) - P(apple and banana) = (5/16) + (4/16) - 0 = 9/16.\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier. So, the probability is 9/16.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Maybe using the complement rule. The complement of picking an apple or a banana is picking an orange. So, P(apple or banana) = 1 - P(orange).\n\nP(orange) = number of oranges / total fruits = 7/16.\n\nTherefore, P(apple or banana) = 1 - 7/16 = 9/16.\n\nAgain, the same answer. So, no matter which method I use, I end up with 9/16.\n\nI think that makes sense. Probability should be a fraction between 0 and 1, and 9/16 is approximately 0.5625, which seems reasonable since apples and bananas together make up 9 out of 16 fruits.\n\nLet me just double-check the numbers to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. 5 apples plus 7 oranges plus 4 bananas equals 16 fruits. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, apples plus bananas are 5 + 4 = 9. So, 9/16 is the probability.\n\nI don't see any mistakes here. It seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if the fruits are equally likely to be picked. The problem says \"randomly pick one fruit from the bag without looking,\" so I assume each fruit has an equal chance of being picked.\n\nIf there were different weights or sizes, maybe the probabilities would differ, but since it's not mentioned, I think assuming equal probability for each fruit is correct.\n\nAlso, the problem doesn't mention replacement or multiple picks, so it's just a single pick.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether apples, oranges, and bananas are the only fruits in the bag. The problem says \"in a bag of fruits\" and lists only these three types, so I assume there are no other fruits.\n\nIf there were other fruits, I would need to include them in the total count, but according to the problem, there are only apples, oranges, and bananas.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability of picking an apple or a banana is 9/16.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{16}} \\]"
