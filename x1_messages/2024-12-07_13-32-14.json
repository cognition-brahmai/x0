        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. It says the garden has a length of 15 meters and a width of 8 meters. There are two parts to this question: first, finding the area of the garden, and second, figuring out how much fencing material would be needed to build a fence around it.\n\nOkay, starting with the area. I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, for this garden, the area should be 15 meters times 8 meters. Let me do the multiplication: 15 times 8 is 120. So, the area is 120 square meters.\n\nNow, for the fencing material. I think that to find out how much fencing is needed, I have to calculate the perimeter of the garden. The perimeter of a rectangle is the total length of all its sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the formula for perimeter should be 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. So, that would be 2 times 15 meters plus 2 times 8 meters.\n\nLet me calculate that: 2 times 15 is 30 meters, and 2 times 8 is 16 meters. Adding those together, 30 plus 16 equals 46 meters. Therefore, you would need 46 meters of fencing material to go around the garden.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about the perimeter? I've heard someone mention that for a rectangle, you can also calculate the perimeter by adding the length and width and then multiplying by 2. Is that correct? Let me try that: 15 meters plus 8 meters is 23 meters, and then 23 times 2 is 46 meters. Yep, that matches what I calculated earlier. So, either way, you end up with 46 meters.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should double-check my calculations. For the area: 15 times 8 is indeed 120 square meters. For the perimeter: 2 times 15 is 30, 2 times 8 is 16, and 30 plus 16 is 46 meters. Alternatively, 15 plus 8 is 23, and 23 times 2 is 46 meters. Everything checks out.\n\nI think that's it. The area of the garden is 120 square meters, and you'd need 46 meters of fencing material to enclose it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe area of the garden is \\(\\boxed{120}\\) square meters, and the amount of fencing material needed is \\(\\boxed{46}\\) meters."
