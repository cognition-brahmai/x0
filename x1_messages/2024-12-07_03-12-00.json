        "content": "A saxophone is classified as a woodwind instrument, even though it is typically made of brass. This might seem counterintuitive, but the classification is based on how the sound is produced rather than the material it's made from. In a saxophone, sound is produced by blowing air into a reed mouthpiece, which vibrates to create the sound, similar to other woodwind instruments like clarinets and oboes. The use of a reed is a key characteristic that places it in the woodwind family, despite its brass construction.\n"
