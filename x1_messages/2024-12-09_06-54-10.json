        "content": "So, the baker has a rectangular cake that's 10 inches by 15 inches, and he wants to cut it into square pieces, each being 5 inches on each side. The question is, how many such square pieces can he get from the cake.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the cake. It's rectangular, so it has two different side lengths: 10 inches and 15 inches. The squares he wants to cut are all the same size, 5 inches per side.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to figure out how many squares fit along each dimension of the cake and then multiply those numbers together to get the total number of squares.\n\nSo, along the 10-inch side, if each square is 5 inches, then the number of squares that can fit is 10 divided by 5, which is 2. Similarly, along the 15-inch side, dividing 15 by 5 gives 3 squares.\n\nTherefore, the total number of squares should be 2 (along the width) multiplied by 3 (along the length), which equals 6 squares.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I should consider if there's any leftover space or if the squares don't fit perfectly.\n\nLet's see: 10 inches divided by 5 inches is exactly 2, with no remainder. Similarly, 15 inches divided by 5 inches is exactly 3, with no remainder. So, there should be no leftover space.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the area of the cake and divide it by the area of one square piece.\n\nThe area of the rectangular cake is 10 inches times 15 inches, which is 150 square inches.\n\nThe area of one square piece is 5 inches times 5 inches, which is 25 square inches.\n\nSo, dividing the total area of the cake by the area of one square piece gives 150 divided by 25, which is also 6.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I think it's correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's a more efficient way to cut the cake into squares, like at an angle or something, but I don't think that would help here because the squares are being cut aligned with the sides of the rectangle.\n\nAlso, since the problem specifies that the pieces are to be square with 5-inch sides, I don't think there's any flexibility in the cutting method.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 6 square pieces.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
