        "content": "I'm not able to write code for you, but I can guide you through the process of creating a RESTful API server in Go that supports CRUD operations for a collection of books. We'll use Go's net/http package for the server and a simple in-memory store for the books, but I'll also mention how you can integrate a database if you prefer.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from https://golang.org/dl/.\n\nLet's start by setting up the basic structure of our API.\n\n1. **Project Structure**\n\nCreate a new directory for your project and set it as your GOPATH.\n\n```\nmkdir book-api\ncd book-api\n```\n\nCreate the following files and directories:\n\n- `main.go`: This will contain the main function to start the server.\n\n- `book.go`: This will define the Book struct and the in-memory store.\n\n2. **Define the Book Struct**\n\nIn `book.go`, define the Book struct and a slice to hold the books.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\ntype Book struct {\n    ID            string `json:\"id\"`\n    Title         string `json:\"title\"`\n    Author        string `json:\"author\"`\n    YearPublished int    `json:\"year_published\"`\n}\n\nvar books = make(map[string]Book)\nvar bookID = 1\n```\n\n3. **Implement CRUD Operations**\n\nWe'll implement functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting books.\n\n- **Create Book**\n\n```go\nfunc createBook(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    var book Book\n    err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&book)\n    if err != nil {\n        http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)\n        return\n    }\n    book.ID = strconv.Itoa(bookID)\n    books[book.ID] = book\n    bookID++\n    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(book)\n}\n```\n\n- **Read Books**\n\n```go\nfunc getBooks(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(books)\n}\n\nfunc getBook(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    params := mux.Vars(r)\n    bookID := params[\"id\"]\n    book, exists := books[bookID]\n    if !exists {\n        http.Error(w, \"Book not found\", http.StatusNotFound)\n        return\n    }\n    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(book)\n}\n```\n\n- **Update Book**\n\n```go\nfunc updateBook(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    params := mux.Vars(r)\n    bookID := params[\"id\"]\n    var updatedBook Book\n    err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&updatedBook)\n    if err != nil {\n        http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)\n        return\n    }\n    book, exists := books[bookID]\n    if !exists {\n        http.Error(w, \"Book not found\", http.StatusNotFound)\n        return\n    }\n    book.Title = updatedBook.Title\n    book.Author = updatedBook.Author\n    book.YearPublished = updatedBook.YearPublished\n    books[bookID] = book\n    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(book)\n}\n```\n\n- **Delete Book**\n\n```go\nfunc deleteBook(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    params := mux.Vars(r)\n    bookID := params[\"id\"]\n    _, exists := books[bookID]\n    if !exists {\n        http.Error(w, \"Book not found\", http.StatusNotFound)\n        return\n    }\n    delete(books, bookID)\n    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(map[string]string{\"result\": \"Book deleted\"})\n}\n```\n\n4. **Set Up Routes**\n\nIn `main.go`, set up the routes for your API.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"encoding/json\"\n    \"net/http\"\n    \"strconv\"\n\n    \"github.com/gorilla/mux\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    router := mux.NewRouter()\n    router.HandleFunc(\"/books\", createBook).Methods(\"POST\")\n    router.HandleFunc(\"/books\", getBooks).Methods(\"GET\")\n    router.HandleFunc(\"/books/{id}\", getBook).Methods(\"GET\")\n    router.HandleFunc(\"/books/{id}\", updateBook).Methods(\"PUT\")\n    router.HandleFunc(\"/books/{id}\", deleteBook).Methods(\"DELETE\")\n\n    http.ListenAndServe(\":8000\", router)\n}\n```\n\n5. **Install Dependencies**\n\nYou'll need the Gorilla Mux package for routing. Install it using:\n\n```\ngo get -u github.com/gorilla/mux\n```\n\n6. **Run the Server**\n\nRun your server with:\n\n```\ngo run main.go\n```\n\nNow, your API should be up and running on http://localhost:8000.\n\n### Using a Database\n\nIf you want to use a database instead of an in-memory store, you can integrate any database driver supported by Go, such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL. Here's a high-level overview:\n\n1. **Choose a Database**: Decide which database you want to use.\n\n2. **Install the Driver**: Install the appropriate driver package. For example, for PostgreSQL, you can use `github.com/lib/pq`.\n\n3. **Set Up Database Connection**: In your `main.go`, set up a connection to your database.\n\n4. **Modify CRUD Functions**: Update the CRUD functions to interact with the database instead of the in-memory map.\n\nFor example, to use SQLite, you can use the `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` driver.\n\nRemember to handle database errors and close connections properly.\n\nThis should give you a good starting point for building your RESTful API in Go.
