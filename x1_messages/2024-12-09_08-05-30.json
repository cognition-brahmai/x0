        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a rectangular garden that's currently 30 meters long and 20 meters wide. The owner wants to increase the garden's area by 50% by adding an equal amount of land to both sides. We need to figure out how much land should be added to each side to achieve this.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. We have a rectangle with a length of 30 meters and a width of 20 meters. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width, so the current area is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Area} = 30 \\, \\text{m} \\times 20 \\, \\text{m} = 600 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nThe owner wants to increase this area by 50%. So, the new area should be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Area} = 600 \\, \\text{m}^2 + 0.5 \\times 600 \\, \\text{m}^2 = 600 \\, \\text{m}^2 + 300 \\, \\text{m}^2 = 900 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nNow, the plan is to add an equal amount of land to both sides of the garden. This means that we will be adding the same amount to both the length and the width. Let's denote this added amount by \\( x \\) meters.\n\nSo, the new length will be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Length} = 30 \\, \\text{m} + x \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nAnd the new width will be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Width} = 20 \\, \\text{m} + x \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nThe area of the new garden should be equal to the new area we calculated earlier, which is 900 m\u00b2. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n(30 + x) \\times (20 + x) = 900\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to solve for \\( x \\). Let's expand the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[\n30 \\times 20 + 30x + 20x + x^2 = 900\n\\]\n\n\\[\n600 + 50x + x^2 = 900\n\\]\n\nNext, let's move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 50x + 600 - 900 = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 50x - 300 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 50x - 300 = 0\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nIn this equation, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 50 \\), and \\( c = -300 \\). Plugging these values into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-50 \\pm \\sqrt{50^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-300)}}{2 \\times 1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-50 \\pm \\sqrt{2500 + 1200}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-50 \\pm \\sqrt{3700}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-50 \\pm 60.8276}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two potential solutions for \\( x \\):\n\n1. \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-50 + 60.8276}{2} = \\frac{10.8276}{2} = 5.4138 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\n2. \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-50 - 60.8276}{2} = \\frac{-110.8276}{2} = -55.4138 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nSince a negative value for \\( x \\) doesn't make sense in this context (we can't add negative land), we discard the negative solution. Therefore, the amount of land to be added to each side is approximately 5.4138 meters.\n\nHowever, to present a more precise answer, we can leave it in terms of the square root or round it to a reasonable number of decimal places. Let's round it to two decimal places for practical purposes:\n\n\\[\nx \\approx 5.41 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the owner should add approximately 5.41 meters to each side of the garden to increase its area by 50%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The original area is 600 m\u00b2, and we want to increase it by 50%, which is 900 m\u00b2. The new dimensions should be 30 + x and 20 + x, and their product should be 900.\n\nPlugging x = 5.41 m back into the new dimensions:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Length} = 30 + 5.41 = 35.41 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Width} = 20 + 5.41 = 25.41 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Area} = 35.41 \\, \\text{m} \\times 25.41 \\, \\text{m} \\approx 899.98 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\approx 900 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nThat checks out. So, adding approximately 5.41 meters to each side should achieve the desired increase in area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Let's consider that the owner is adding an equal amount of land to both sides, which implies that the shape might not necessarily remain a rectangle, but considering the previous approach, it's safe to assume that both length and width are increased by the same amount.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that the owner is adding land to all sides equally, which would mean adding the same amount to both the length and the width.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem says \"adding an equal amount of land to both sides.\" This could be interpreted in different ways. Does \"both sides\" mean adding to both the length and the width, or does it mean adding to two opposite sides?\n\nUpon re-reading the problem, it says: \"adding an equal amount of land to both sides.\" This could be ambiguous. Does it mean adding the same amount to both the length and the width, or adding the same amount to each side?\n\nIn the previous approach, I assumed that \"both sides\" refers to adding the same amount to both the length and the width, effectively making both dimensions larger by the same amount.\n\nHowever, another interpretation could be that the owner is adding land to all four sides of the garden, maintaining symmetry.\n\nIf that's the case, then adding \\( x \\) meters to all four sides would mean:\n\n- Adding \\( x \\) meters to both the length and the width, but since there are two sides for each dimension, the total addition to each dimension would be \\( 2x \\).\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Let's clarify.\n\nIf you imagine a rectangular garden, and you're adding a strip of land of width \\( x \\) meters around it, on all four sides, then the new length would be the original length plus twice the width of the strip (since you're adding it to both ends), and similarly for the width.\n\nSo, in that case:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Length} = 30 + 2x\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Width} = 20 + 2x\n\\]\n\nAnd the new area would be:\n\n\\[\n(30 + 2x)(20 + 2x) = 900\n\\]\n\nLet's expand this equation:\n\n\\[\n30 \\times 20 + 30 \\times 2x + 20 \\times 2x + 2x \\times 2x = 900\n\\]\n\n\\[\n600 + 60x + 40x + 4x^2 = 900\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4x^2 + 100x + 600 = 900\n\\]\n\nSubtract 900 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n4x^2 + 100x + 600 - 900 = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4x^2 + 100x - 300 = 0\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 4:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 25x - 75 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, we solve this quadratic equation for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-25 \\pm \\sqrt{25^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-75)}}{2 \\times 1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-25 \\pm \\sqrt{625 + 300}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-25 \\pm \\sqrt{925}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-25 \\pm 30.4138}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two potential solutions:\n\n1. \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-25 + 30.4138}{2} = \\frac{5.4138}{2} = 2.7069 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\n2. \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-25 - 30.4138}{2} = \\frac{-55.4138}{2} = -27.7069 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nAgain, the negative solution doesn't make sense in this context, so we discard it. Therefore, \\( x \\approx 2.7069 \\) meters.\n\nBut wait, in this interpretation, \\( x \\) is the width of the strip added around the garden on all four sides. So, the amount of land added to each side would be \\( x \\), which is approximately 2.71 meters.\n\nHowever, this contradicts our earlier result where we added \\( x \\) to both the length and the width directly. Which interpretation is correct?\n\nLet's compare the two approaches:\n\n1. Adding \\( x \\) meters to both the length and the width.\n\n2. Adding \\( x \\) meters to all four sides, which effectively increases the length by \\( 2x \\) and the width by \\( 2x \\).\n\nGiven the problem statement: \"adding an equal amount of land to both sides,\" the second interpretation seems more accurate because adding land to both sides typically means adding a strip around the perimeter.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is the second one, where \\( x \\) is the width of the strip added around the garden, and the new dimensions are \\( 30 + 2x \\) and \\( 20 + 2x \\).\n\nSo, the amount of land to be added to each side is approximately 2.71 meters.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, we got 5.41 meters, and in the second approach, we got 2.71 meters. There seems to be a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me check the calculations again.\n\nIn the second approach:\n\n\\[\n(30 + 2x)(20 + 2x) = 900\n\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[\n600 + 60x + 40x + 4x^2 = 900\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4x^2 + 100x + 600 = 900\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4x^2 + 100x - 300 = 0\n\\]\n\nDivide by 4:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 25x - 75 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-25 \\pm \\sqrt{625 + 300}}{2} = \\frac{-25 \\pm \\sqrt{925}}{2} = \\frac{-25 \\pm 30.4138}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx \\approx 2.7069 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nNow, plugging back to check:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Length} = 30 + 2(2.7069) \\approx 35.4138 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Width} = 20 + 2(2.7069) \\approx 25.4138 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Area} \\approx 35.4138 \\times 25.4138 \\approx 899.99 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\approx 900 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nThis checks out.\n\nIn the first approach, we added \\( x \\) to both the length and the width directly, which would be equivalent to adding \\( x/2 \\) to each side if we were adding to both sides. But that seems inconsistent with standard interpretations.\n\nTherefore, the second approach is more accurate, and the amount of land to be added to each side is approximately 2.71 meters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means adding the same amount to the length and the width, not necessarily adding land around all sides.\n\nBut given the common usage, adding land to \"both sides\" likely means adding a strip around the perimeter.\n\nAnother way to think about it: if you add \\( x \\) meters to each side, considering that opposite sides are increased by \\( x \\), but since it's a rectangle, both length and width need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of increasing both dimensions by the same proportion.\n\nBut no, the problem specifies adding an equal amount of land to both sides, not proportionally.\n\nGiven that, and considering the two approaches, I think the second approach is more accurate.\n\nTherefore, the owner should add approximately 2.71 meters to each side of the garden.\n\nAlternatively, to express it more precisely:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-25 + \\sqrt{925}}{2} \\approx 2.7069 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\n\\[\nx \\approx 2.71 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the owner should add approximately 2.71 meters to each side of the garden to increase its area by 50%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.71 \\, \\text{meters}} \\]"
