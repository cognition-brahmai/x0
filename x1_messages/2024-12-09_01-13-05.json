        "content": "That sounds familiar. Let me think... Tom Joad, Ma Joad, and Jim Casy. I believe these characters are from \"The Grapes of Wrath\" by John Steinbeck. It's a novel that depicts the struggles of Dust Bowl migrants during the Great Depression. The Joad family embarks on a journey from their Oklahoma home to California in search of a better life, facing numerous hardships along the way. Jim Casy is a former preacher who accompanies the family and grapples with his own beliefs and the social injustices he witnesses. \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is considered a classic of American literature and has had a significant impact on both literature and society."
