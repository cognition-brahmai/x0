        "content": "So, if a car travels 120 miles in 2 hours, to find its average speed, I need to divide the total distance by the total time, right? So, that would be 120 miles divided by 2 hours, which equals 60 miles per hour. So, the average speed is 60 mph.\n\nNow, if the car continues at this speed of 60 mph, and I need to find out how long it will take to travel an additional 180 miles, I can use the formula: time = distance divided by speed. So, time equals 180 miles divided by 60 mph, which equals 3 hours.\n\nTherefore, it will take an additional 3 hours to travel those 180 miles at the same speed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
