        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem. We've got a group of 50 people: 20 with brown eyes and 30 with blue eyes. We need to find the probability that when we randomly select three people from this group, at least one of them has brown eyes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"at least one\" means in probability terms. \"At least one\" typically means one or more. So, in this case, it's the probability that out of the three selected people, either one has brown eyes, two have brown eyes, or all three have brown eyes.\n\nHowever, calculating this directly could be a bit messy because there are multiple scenarios to consider. A simpler approach is to use the complement rule. The complement of \"at least one has brown eyes\" is \"none have brown eyes,\" which means all three selected people have blue eyes.\n\nSo, the probability of at least one having brown eyes is equal to 1 minus the probability that all three have blue eyes.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Total people: 50\n\n- Brown-eyed people: 20\n\n- Blue-eyed people: 30\n\nWe are selecting 3 people.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of ways to select 3 people out of 50. This is a combination problem, since the order doesn't matter.\n\nThe number of combinations is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial.\n\nSo, total ways to choose 3 people out of 50:\n\n\\[\nC(50, 3) = \\frac{50!}{3!(50 - 3)!} = \\frac{50!}{3! \\cdot 47!}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this by canceling out the \\( 47! \\) in the numerator and denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(50, 3) = \\frac{50 \\times 49 \\times 48 \\times 47!}{3! \\times 47!} = \\frac{50 \\times 49 \\times 48}{3!}\n\\]\n\nNow, \\( 3! = 6 \\), so:\n\n\\[\nC(50, 3) = \\frac{50 \\times 49 \\times 48}{6}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[\n50 \\times 49 = 2450\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2450 \\times 48 = 117,600\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{117,600}{6} = 19,600\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 19,600 possible ways to choose 3 people out of 50.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 blue-eyed people out of the 30 blue-eyed people.\n\nUsing the combination formula again:\n\n\\[\nC(30, 3) = \\frac{30!}{3!(30 - 3)!} = \\frac{30!}{3! \\cdot 27!}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nC(30, 3) = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28 \\times 27!}{3! \\times 27!} = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28}{6}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[\n30 \\times 29 = 870\n\\]\n\n\\[\n870 \\times 28 = 24,360\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{24,360}{6} = 4,060\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 4,060 ways to choose 3 blue-eyed people out of 30.\n\nNow, the probability that all three selected people have blue eyes is the number of ways to choose 3 blue-eyed people divided by the total number of ways to choose any 3 people from 50.\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{all blue eyes}) = \\frac{4,060}{19,600}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 20:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4,060 \\div 20}{19,600 \\div 20} = \\frac{203}{980}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 7:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{203 \\div 7}{980 \\div 7} = \\frac{29}{140}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( P(\\text{all blue eyes}) = \\frac{29}{140} \\).\n\nNow, the probability that at least one person has brown eyes is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least one brown eye}) = 1 - P(\\text{all blue eyes}) = 1 - \\frac{29}{140}\n\\]\n\nTo subtract this, we can write 1 as \\( \\frac{140}{140} \\):\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least one brown eye}) = \\frac{140}{140} - \\frac{29}{140} = \\frac{111}{140}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability is \\( \\frac{111}{140} \\).\n\nAlternatively, we can convert this to a decimal for a more straightforward understanding:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{111}{140} \\approx 0.792857...\n\\]\n\nRounded to four decimal places, that's approximately 0.7929.\n\nTo express it as a percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.7929 \\times 100 \\% \\approx 79.29\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there's approximately a 79.29% chance that at least one person out of three randomly selected from the group has brown eyes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total combinations of 50 people taken 3 at a time:\n\n\\[\nC(50, 3) = \\frac{50 \\times 49 \\times 48}{6} = 19,600\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNext, combinations of 30 blue-eyed people taken 3 at a time:\n\n\\[\nC(30, 3) = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28}{6} = 4,060\n\\]\n\nThat also seems correct.\n\nThen, the probability of all three having blue eyes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{all blue eyes}) = \\frac{4,060}{19,600} = \\frac{29}{140}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying \\( \\frac{4,060}{19,600} \\):\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 20:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4,060 \\div 20}{19,600 \\div 20} = \\frac{203}{980}\n\\]\n\nThen divide by 7:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{203 \\div 7}{980 \\div 7} = \\frac{29}{140}\n\\]\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nThen, \\( P(\\text{at least one brown eye}) = 1 - \\frac{29}{140} = \\frac{111}{140} \\).\n\nThat seems right.\n\nAlternatively, we could calculate it directly by finding the probability of having one, two, or three brown-eyed people and summing those probabilities, but that would be more complicated.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use probabilities step by step.\n\nFor example, the probability that the first person has blue eyes is \\( \\frac{30}{50} \\), the second has blue eyes given the first did is \\( \\frac{29}{49} \\), and the third has blue eyes given the first two did is \\( \\frac{28}{48} \\).\n\nSo, the probability that all three have blue eyes is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{50} \\times \\frac{29}{49} \\times \\frac{28}{48}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\nFirst, \\( \\frac{30}{50} = 0.6 \\)\n\nThen, \\( 0.6 \\times \\frac{29}{49} \\)\n\n\\[\n\\frac{29}{49} \\approx 0.5918\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.6 \\times 0.5918 \\approx 0.3551\n\\]\n\nThen, \\( 0.3551 \\times \\frac{28}{48} \\)\n\n\\[\n\\frac{28}{48} = \\frac{7}{12} \\approx 0.5833\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.3551 \\times 0.5833 \\approx 0.2072\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( P(\\text{all blue eyes}) \\approx 0.2072 \\)\n\nThen, \\( P(\\text{at least one brown eye}) = 1 - 0.2072 = 0.7928 \\), which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed approximately 79.29%.\n\nAlternatively, we could calculate the probability of having exactly one, two, or three brown-eyed people and sum those probabilities.\n\nThe probability of exactly one brown-eyed person:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 1) \\times C(30, 2) / C(50, 3)\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, exactly two brown-eyed people:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 2) \\times C(30, 1) / C(50, 3)\n\\]\n\nAnd exactly three brown-eyed people:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 3) \\times C(30, 0) / C(50, 3)\n\\]\n\nThen, sum these three probabilities.\n\nLet's calculate each one.\n\nFirst, \\( C(20, 1) = 20 \\)\n\n\\( C(30, 2) = \\frac{30 \\times 29}{2} = 435 \\)\n\nSo, \\( C(20, 1) \\times C(30, 2) = 20 \\times 435 = 8,700 \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( C(20, 2) = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = 190 \\)\n\n\\( C(30, 1) = 30 \\)\n\nSo, \\( C(20, 2) \\times C(30, 1) = 190 \\times 30 = 5,700 \\)\n\nNext, \\( C(20, 3) = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18}{6} = 1,140 \\)\n\n\\( C(30, 0) = 1 \\)\n\nSo, \\( C(20, 3) \\times C(30, 0) = 1,140 \\times 1 = 1,140 \\)\n\nNow, sum these up:\n\n\\[\n8,700 + 5,700 + 1,140 = 15,540\n\\]\n\nThen, divide by the total combinations \\( C(50, 3) = 19,600 \\):\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least one brown eye}) = \\frac{15,540}{19,600} = \\frac{1554}{1960}\n\\]\n\nSimplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 14:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1554 \\div 14}{1960 \\div 14} = \\frac{111}{140}\n\\]\n\nAgain, we get \\( \\frac{111}{140} \\), which confirms our previous result.\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one person has brown eyes when selecting three people from the group is \\( \\frac{111}{140} \\), or approximately 79.29%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{111}{140}} \\]"
