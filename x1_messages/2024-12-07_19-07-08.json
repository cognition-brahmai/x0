        "content": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about a train traveling from City A to City B. It says the train takes 3 hours to cover a distance of 180 miles. So, first things first, I need to find out the train's current speed.\n\nI know that speed is equal to distance divided by time, right? So, if the distance is 180 miles and the time is 3 hours, then the speed should be 180 miles divided by 3 hours, which is 60 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the problem says that the train increases its speed by 10 mph. So, if it was going at 60 mph, and it increases its speed by 10 mph, then the new speed would be 70 mph.\n\nNext, I need to find out how long it will take to travel the same distance of 180 miles at this new speed of 70 mph. Again, I can use the formula for speed, but rearrange it to solve for time. The formula for time is distance divided by speed.\n\nSo, time equals 180 miles divided by 70 mph. Let me do that calculation. 180 divided by 70 is... hmm, 70 goes into 180 two times, because 70 times 2 is 140. Then, 180 minus 140 is 40. So, it's 2 and 40/70 hours, which simplifies to 2 and 4/7 hours.\n\nBut maybe it's better to express it in hours and minutes. Let's see, 4/7 of an hour is how many minutes? Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, I can multiply 4/7 by 60.\n\n4/7 times 60 is... 4 times 60 is 240, divided by 7. 240 divided by 7 is approximately 34.2857, so roughly 34.29 minutes.\n\nSo, the total time would be 2 hours and about 34.29 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there's a more precise way to do this. Maybe I can keep it in fractional form.\n\n2 and 4/7 hours is the exact answer. If I need to express it decimals, it would be 2.+ 0.5714 (since 4 divided by 7 is approximately 0.5714), so about 2.5714 hours.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the answer in hours and minutes, so 2 hours and 34.29 minutes seems acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula time = distance / speed, plug in the values, and see.\n\nTime = 180 miles / 70 mph = 180/70 hours = 18/7 hours = 2 4/7 hours.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, if the train increases its speed by 10 mph to 70 mph, it will take 2 and 4/7 hours, or approximately 2 hours and 34 minutes to travel the same 180-mile distance.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, original speed: 180 miles / 3 hours = 60 mph. That seems correct.\n\nThen, increased speed: 60 mph + 10 mph = 70 mph. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, time at new speed: 180 miles / 70 mph = 180/70 hours = 18/7 hours = approximately 2.5714 hours.\n\nConverting 0.5714 hours to minutes: 0.5714 * 60 \u2248 34.29 minutes.\n\nSo, total time is 2 hours and 34.29 minutes.\n\nYeah, that seems about right.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the answer in hours as a decimal, I can leave it as approximately 2.571 hours.\n\nBut I think presenting it in hours and minutes might be more understandable for most people.\n\nSo, the final answer is that it will take approximately 2 hours and 34 minutes to travel from City A to City B at the increased speed of 70 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours and } 34 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
