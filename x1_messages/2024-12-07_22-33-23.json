        "content": "Okay, I'm going to help you write a Java program that reads a CSV file containing student information and manages it using an ArrayList of custom Student objects. We'll also implement sorting functionalities based on name, age, or grade, and a method to display the sorted list.\n\nFirst, let's break down the tasks:\n\n1. **Create a Student class**: This class will have properties for name, age, and grade, along with getters and setters.\n\n2. **Read the CSV file**: We'll use a Scanner or BufferedReader to read the file and populate an ArrayList of Student objects.\n\n3. **Implement sorting**: We'll use the Collections.sort method with custom Comparators to sort the list by name, age, or grade.\n\n4. **Display the list**: A method to print the list of students.\n\nLet's start with the Student class.\n\n### Student Class\n\n```java\npublic class Student {\n    private String name;\n    private int age;\n    private double grade;\n\n    public Student(String name, int age, double grade) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = age;\n        this.grade = grade;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public int getAge() {\n        return age;\n    }\n\n    public double getGrade() {\n        return grade;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"Student{name='\" + name + \"', age=\" + age + \", grade=\" + grade + \"}\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Main Class\n\nNow, let's create the main class that will handle file reading, sorting, and displaying.\n\n```java\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Collections;\nimport java.util.Comparator;\n\npublic class StudentManager {\n\n    private ArrayList<Student> students;\n\n    public StudentManager() {\n        students = new ArrayList<>();\n    }\n\n    public void readCSV(String fileName) {\n        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {\n            String line;\n            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n                String[] values = line.split(\",\");\n                if (values.length == 3) {\n                    String name = values[0];\n                    int age = Integer.parseInt(values[1]);\n                    double grade = Double.parseDouble(values[2]);\n                    students.add(new Student(name, age, grade));\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void sortByName() {\n        Collections.sort(students, Comparator.comparing(Student::getName));\n    }\n\n    public void sortByAge() {\n        Collections.sort(students, Comparator.comparingInt(Student::getAge));\n    }\n\n    public void sortByGrade() {\n        Collections.sort(students, Comparator.comparingDouble(Student::getGrade));\n    }\n\n    public void display() {\n        for (Student student : students) {\n            System.out.println(student);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        StudentManager manager = new StudentManager();\n        manager.readCSV(\"students.csv\");\n        manager.sortByName();\n        manager.display();\n\n        // To sort by age or grade, uncomment the following lines\n        // manager.sortByAge();\n        // manager.sortByGrade();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Student Class**: This class represents a student with name, age, and grade attributes. It has a constructor to initialize these properties and getter methods to access them. The `toString` method is overridden to provide a nice string representation of the student object.\n\n2. **StudentManager Class**: This class manages the list of students.\n   - **readCSV method**: Reads the CSV file and populates the ArrayList with Student objects. It assumes the CSV file has columns in the order: name, age, grade.\n   - **sort methods**: These methods use `Collections.sort` with appropriate Comparators to sort the list by name, age, or grade.\n   - **display method**: Iterates through the list and prints each student.\n\n3. **Main method**: Creates an instance of StudentManager, reads the CSV file, sorts the students by name, and displays them. You can uncomment the other sort methods to sort by age or grade as needed.\n\nMake sure your CSV file (e.g., `students.csv`) is in the correct format and in the same directory as your Java files, or provide the full path to the file.\n\nThis should give you a good starting point.
