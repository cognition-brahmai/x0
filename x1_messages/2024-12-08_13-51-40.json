        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. The length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet. I need to find out two things: first, the area of the garden in square feet, and second, how many square yards that would be.\n\nOkay, starting with the area in square feet. I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, area equals length times width.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nArea = 20 feet \u00d7 15 feet\n\nNow, 20 multiplied by 15 is 300. So, the area is 300 square feet.\n\nNext, I need to convert that into square yards. I know that 1 yard equals 3 feet, but since we're dealing with area, I need to think about square yards and square feet.\n\nI think I should recall how many square feet are in one square yard. If 1 yard is 3 feet, then 1 square yard is 3 feet by 3 feet, which is 9 square feet.\n\nSo, 1 square yard = 9 square feet.\n\nTo find out how many square yards are in 300 square feet, I can divide the total area in square feet by the number of square feet in one square yard.\n\nThat is:\n\nNumber of square yards = total area in square feet \u00f7 square feet per square yard\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of square yards = 300 \u00f7 9\n\nLet me do that division. 9 times 33 is 297, which is 3 less than 300. So, 33 and a third.\n\nWait, but I should be precise here. 300 divided by 9 is 33.333..., which is 33 and one-third.\n\nSo, the garden is 33 and one-third square yards.\n\nAlternatively, I can express that as a fraction: 33 1/3 square yards.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to express it differently. Perhaps in decimal form, which would be 33.333... square yards. Maybe I should round it to two decimal places, like 33.33 square yards.\n\nBut actually, since it's exactly one-third, maybe it's better to leave it as 33 1/3 square yards.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, area in square feet: 20 feet \u00d7 15 feet = 300 square feet. That seems correct.\n\nThen, converting to square yards: since 1 square yard = 9 square feet, then 300 \u00f7 9 = 33.333... which is 33 1/3 square yards. That looks right.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe area of the garden is \\boxed{300 \\text{ square feet} \\text{ and } 33\\frac{1}{3} \\text{ square yards}}."
