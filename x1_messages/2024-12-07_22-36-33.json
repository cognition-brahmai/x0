So, Mount Everest is currently recognized as the highest mountain in the world, standing at approximately 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level. But your question is about what was the highest mountain before Everest was discovered.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand that mountains have always existed, regardless of whether humans knew about them or not. Mount Everest has been there for millions of years, long before it was officially discovered and measured by humans.\n\nThe term \"discovered\" in this context likely refers to when humans first identified and measured Mount Everest as the world's highest peak. So, even before it was formally discovered, Mount Everest was still the highest mountain.\n\nHowever, to address the spirit of your question, perhaps you're wondering if there was another mountain that was considered the highest before Everest was measured. Historically, Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador was thought to be the highest mountain in the world in the 18th and early 19th centuries. It was surveyed by Alexander von Humboldt in 1802, and its height was estimated to be over 20,000 feet, which was higher than the then-known height of Mount Everest.\n\nBut in reality, Mount Everest is significantly taller. The great trigonometric survey of India in the 19th century measured the heights of various peaks in the Himalayas, and in 1856, it was determined that Peak XV (later named Mount Everest) was the highest mountain in the world.\n\nSo, to summarize, Mount Everest has always been the highest mountain, but humans didn't know that until it was measured in the 19th century. Before that, other mountains like Mont Blanc in Europe and Chimborazo in South America were considered the highest based on the knowledge available at the time.\n\nI hope this helps clarify things! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."
