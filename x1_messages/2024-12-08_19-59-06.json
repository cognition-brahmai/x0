        "content": "So I've got this problem here about an airline wanting to start a new direct flight between two cities that are 5,000 miles apart. They're planning to use an aircraft that has a maximum range of 6,000 miles and can carry up to 250 passengers. But there's a catch: the actual distance traveled can vary by up to 10% because of headwinds and tailwinds. And I need to calculate the minimum and maximum possible fuel consumption for this route, given that the aircraft consumes 0.05 gallons of fuel per mile per passenger.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the variables involved:\n\n1. **Base distance:** 5,000 miles\n\n2. **Distance variation:** \u00b110%\n\n3. **Passenger capacity:** 250 passengers\n\n4. **Fuel consumption rate:** 0.05 gallons per mile per passenger\n\nMy goal is to find the minimum and maximum fuel consumption.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the range of possible distances.**\n\nThe base distance is 5,000 miles, and it can vary by up to 10%. So, I need to calculate 10% of 5,000 miles.\n\n10% of 5,000 miles = 0.10 * 5,000 = 500 miles\n\nTherefore, the minimum distance is:\n\n5,000 miles - 500 miles = 4,500 miles\n\nAnd the maximum distance is:\n\n5,000 miles + 500 miles = 5,500 miles\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the fuel consumption for the minimum distance.**\n\nFuel consumption is given as 0.05 gallons per mile per passenger.\n\nSo, for the minimum distance of 4,500 miles with 250 passengers:\n\nFuel consumption = 4,500 miles * 0.05 gallons/mile/passenger * 250 passengers\n\nLet's compute that:\n\nFirst, 4,500 miles * 0.05 gallons/mile/passenger = 225 gallons/passenger\n\nThen, 225 gallons/passenger * 250 passengers = 56,250 gallons\n\nSo, the minimum fuel consumption is 56,250 gallons.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the fuel consumption for the maximum distance.**\n\nSimilarly, for the maximum distance of 5,500 miles with 250 passengers:\n\nFuel consumption = 5,500 miles * 0.05 gallons/mile/passenger * 250 passengers\n\nCompute this step by step:\n\nFirst, 5,500 miles * 0.05 gallons/mile/passenger = 275 gallons/passenger\n\nThen, 275 gallons/passenger * 250 passengers = 68,750 gallons\n\nTherefore, the maximum fuel consumption is 68,750 gallons.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the aircraft's maximum range.**\n\nThe aircraft has a maximum range of 6,000 miles. The maximum possible distance is 5,500 miles, which is within the aircraft's range (since 5,500 < 6,000 miles). So, there's no issue there.\n\n**Step 5: Finalize the answer.**\n\nBased on the calculations:\n\n- Minimum fuel consumption: 56,250 gallons (for 4,500 miles)\n\n- Maximum fuel consumption: 68,750 gallons (for 5,500 miles)\n\nI should present these values as the range of possible fuel consumption for the flight route.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{56,250 \\text{ gallons} \\text{ to } 68,750 \\text{ gallons}} \\]"
