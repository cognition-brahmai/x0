        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a company that produces 500 units of a product every day. Each unit costs them $15 to produce, and they sell each unit for $30. We need to find out how much profit they make in one week, assuming there are 7 days in a week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what profit is. Profit is basically the amount of money earned from sales minus the cost of producing those goods. So, profit per unit would be the selling price per unit minus the production cost per unit.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nProfit per unit = Selling price per unit - Production cost per unit\nProfit per unit = $30 - $15\nProfit per unit = $15\n\nSo, for each unit they sell, they make a $15 profit.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many units they produce and sell in a week. Since they produce 500 units each day and there are 7 days in a week:\n\nTotal units per week = Units per day * Number of days in a week\nTotal units per week = 500 * 7\nTotal units per week = 3,500 units\n\nNow, to find the total profit for the week, I can multiply the number of units sold in a week by the profit per unit.\n\nTotal profit per week = Total units per week * Profit per unit\nTotal profit per week = 3,500 * $15\n\nLet me do that multiplication:\n\n3,500 * 15\n\nWell, 3,500 * 10 is 35,000\n\nAnd 3,500 * 5 is 17,500\n\nSo, 35,000 + 17,500 equals 52,500\n\nTherefore, the total profit per week is $52,500.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, profit per unit is indeed $15.\n\nThey produce and sell 500 units per day.\n\nOver 7 days, that's 500 * 7 = 3,500 units.\n\n3,500 units * $15 profit per unit should be $52,500.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about daily profit and then multiply by 7.\n\nDaily profit = 500 units * $15 profit per unit = $7,500 per day.\n\nThen, weekly profit = $7,500 * 7 = $52,500.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider total revenue and total cost.\n\nTotal revenue per week = Total units per week * Selling price per unit\nTotal revenue per week = 3,500 * $30\n3,500 * 30 = 105,000\n\nTotal cost per week = Total units per week * Production cost per unit\nTotal cost per week = 3,500 * $15\n3,500 * 15 = 52,500\n\nThen, profit = Total revenue - Total cost\nProfit = $105,000 - $52,500 = $52,500\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, the company makes a profit of $52,500 in one week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{52500} \\]"
