Hmm, sounds like they're talking about Toronto. It's the largest city in Canada by population, and it's known for its diverse economy, including finance and commerce. Plus, it's very multicultural, with a large immigrant population, and there are plenty of shopping centers and high-income areas there. So, I think the city being referred to is Toronto."
