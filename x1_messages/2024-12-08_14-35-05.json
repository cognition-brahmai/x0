        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 friends who want to buy concert tickets, and each ticket costs $60. Normally, if there were no special offers, they would each buy one ticket, so that would be 5 tickets at $60 each.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the total cost without any special offers:\n\n5 tickets \u00d7 $60 per ticket = $300\n\nNow, there's a special offer where if they buy 4 tickets, they get the 5th one for free. So, instead of buying 5 tickets, they only need to pay for 4 tickets, and they get the 5th one without paying.\n\nSo, the total cost with the special offer is:\n\n4 tickets \u00d7 $60 per ticket = $240\n\nTo find out how much money they save with the special offer, I'll subtract the special offer total from the normal total:\n\n$300 (normal total) - $240 (special offer total) = $60\n\nSo, they save $60 with the special offer.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that they get one ticket for free. Since each ticket costs $60, the value of the free ticket is $60. Therefore, the savings should be equal to the price of one ticket, which is $60.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the savings are indeed $60.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any catch or if there are additional costs they might have to incur. For example, maybe there are fees or restrictions on the special offer. However, based on the information provided, there don't seem to be any additional costs.\n\nAlso, I should confirm that the special offer applies exactly to their situation. The offer is \"buy 4 tickets, get the 5th one free.\" Since there are 5 friends, this offer fits perfectly because they can buy 4 tickets and get the 5th one free.\n\nIf there were more or fewer friends, the calculation might be different. But in this case, with exactly 5 friends, the offer works out nicely.\n\nSo, in conclusion, by taking advantage of the special offer, the group of 5 friends saves $60 compared to buying individual tickets without the offer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
