        "content": "So the factory makes widgets in batches of 25, and each widget weighs 10 pounds. The shipment needs 500 pounds of widgets. I need to figure out how many full batches are needed for that shipment.\n\nFirst, I should find out how much a single batch weighs. Since each batch has 25 widgets and each widget is 10 pounds, I can multiply 25 by 10 to get the total weight per batch.\n\n25 widgets/batch * 10 pounds/widget = 250 pounds/batch\n\nSo each batch weighs 250 pounds.\n\nNow, the shipment requires 500 pounds of widgets. To find out how many batches are needed, I can divide the total required weight by the weight per batch.\n\n500 pounds / 250 pounds/batch = 2 batches\n\nSo, 2 full batches are needed for the shipment.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If one batch is 250 pounds, then two batches would be 500 pounds, which matches the shipment requirement.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider? Like, are there any partial batches or is it strictly full batches? The question asks for full batches, so partial batches aren't considered.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the weights are accurate. Each widget is 10 pounds, and batches are 25 widgets each, leading to 250 pounds per batch. The shipment needs 500 pounds, which is exactly two batches.\n\nI think that's straightforward. 2 full batches are needed.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any remainder or if the shipment could be divided differently. 2 batches give 500 pounds exactly, so no remainder.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2 full batches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
