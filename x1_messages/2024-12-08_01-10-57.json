        "content": "In oceanography, the term for the boundary between two masses of water with different densities, often caused by variations in temperature and salinity, is called a pycnocline. So, the correct answer is C. Pycnocline.\n\nTo elaborate a bit, let's understand what each of these terms refers to:\n\n- **Thermocline (Option A):** This is specifically the layer in a body of water where temperature changes rapidly with depth. It's a type of pycnocline because temperature affects water density.\n\n- **Halocline (Option B):** This refers to a layer where salinity changes rapidly with depth. Salinity also affects water density, so a halocline can be another type of pycnocline.\n\n- **Pycnocline (Option C):** This term is more general and refers to any layer in which the water density changes rapidly with depth. This change can be due to temperature (thermocline), salinity (halocline), or both.\n\n- **Option D (Both A and C):** While both thermoclines and pycnoclines can indicate density boundaries, pycnocline is the more inclusive term that covers any density change, including those caused by temperature, salinity, or both.\n\n- **Option E (None of the above):** This isn't correct because pycnocline is the appropriate term.\n\nSo, to summarize, pycnocline is the general term for a density boundary in water masses, which can be caused by temperature (thermocline), salinity (halocline), or both.\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u662fC.
