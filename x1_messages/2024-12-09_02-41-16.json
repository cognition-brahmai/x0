        "content": "So, the water tank is being filled at a rate of 25 liters per minute, and it takes 2 hours to fill it completely. I need to find out the total capacity of the tank in liters.\n\nFirst, I should probably convert the time from hours to minutes because the rate is given in liters per minute. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours would be 2 times 60, which is 120 minutes.\n\nNow, if the tank is being filled at 25 liters per minute for 120 minutes, I can find the total capacity by multiplying the rate by the time.\n\nSo, total capacity = rate \u00d7 time = 25 liters/minute \u00d7 120 minutes.\n\nLet me do the math: 25 \u00d7 120.\n\n25 times 100 is 2500, and 25 times 20 is 500. So, 2500 plus 500 equals 3000 liters.\n\nTherefore, the total capacity of the tank is 3000 liters.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using formulas or something like that.\n\nI recall that capacity or amount is equal to rate multiplied by time. So, A = r \u00d7 t.\n\nHere, r is 25 liters per minute, and t is 120 minutes, so A = 25 \u00d7 120 = 3000 liters.\n\nYeah, that seems straightforward.\n\nJust to be sure, maybe I should check the units. Liters per minute times minutes gives liters, which is correct.\n\nAlso, maybe I can think about it differently. If it's filling at 25 liters per minute, then in one hour it would fill 25 liters/minute \u00d7 60 minutes/hour = 1500 liters/hour.\n\nSince it takes 2 hours to fill the tank, the total capacity would be 1500 liters/hour \u00d7 2 hours = 3000 liters.\n\nSame answer again, so that reinforces that 3000 liters is the correct capacity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the rate in liters per second or something, but that seems unnecessary since the given rate is per minute and the time is in hours, which I converted to minutes.\n\nI think 3000 liters is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3000} \\]"
