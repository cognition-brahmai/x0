        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 4 red balls, 6 blue balls, and 5 green balls. So, total balls in the bag are 4 + 6 + 5, which is 15 balls.\n\nThe question is, if you draw two balls at random without replacement, what's the probability that both balls are the same color?\n\nOkay, so without replacement means that once you draw the first ball, it stays out, and you draw the second ball from the remaining balls.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes when drawing two balls from 15. That's probably the combination of 15 balls taken 2 at a time.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, total number of ways to choose 2 balls from 15 is C(15, 2).\n\nLet me calculate that: 15! / (2!(15 - 2)!) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 13!) = (15 \u00d7 14) / 2 = 105.\n\nSo, there are 105 possible pairs of balls.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the pairs where both balls are the same color.\n\nThere are three colors: red, blue, and green.\n\nSo, I'll calculate the number of ways to draw two red balls, two blue balls, and two green balls, then add them up.\n\nFirst, red balls: there are 4 red balls. The number of ways to choose 2 red balls from 4 is C(4, 2).\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4 - 2)!) = (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2!)) = (4 \u00d7 3) / 2 = 6.\n\nSo, 6 ways to choose two red balls.\n\nNext, blue balls: there are 6 blue balls. The number of ways to choose 2 blue balls from 6 is C(6, 2).\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6 - 2)!) = (6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 4!)) = (6 \u00d7 5) / 2 = 15.\n\nSo, 15 ways to choose two blue balls.\n\nLastly, green balls: there are 5 green balls. The number of ways to choose 2 green balls from 5 is C(5, 2).\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5 - 2)!) = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 3!)) = (5 \u00d7 4) / 2 = 10.\n\nSo, 10 ways to choose two green balls.\n\nNow, the total number of favorable outcomes is 6 (red) + 15 (blue) + 10 (green) = 31.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are the same color is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability = 31 / 105.\n\nBut, I should check if this fraction can be simplified.\n\nLet's see, 31 and 105. 31 is a prime number, and it doesn't divide 105 evenly because 31 \u00d7 3 = 93, and 31 \u00d7 4 = 124, which is more than 105.\n\nSo, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 31/105.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert this to a decimal to get a sense of it.\n\n31 divided by 105 is approximately 0.2952, or about 29.52%.\n\nSo, there's roughly a 29.5% chance that both balls drawn are the same color.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal balls: 4 red + 6 blue + 5 green = 15 balls.\n\nTotal ways to choose 2 balls: C(15, 2) = 105. That seems correct.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 red balls: C(4, 2) = 6.\n\n2 blue balls: C(6, 2) = 15.\n\n2 green balls: C(5, 2) = 10.\n\nTotal favorable outcomes: 6 + 15 + 10 = 31.\n\nProbability: 31/105.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of probabilities step by step.\n\nFirst draw: the probability of drawing any ball is 1, since it's random.\n\nSecond draw: given that the first ball was a certain color, what's the probability that the second ball is the same color.\n\nBut that might be more complicated, and I might end up with the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for probability of independent events, but since it's without replacement, they're not independent.\n\nWait, without replacement means that the probability changes after the first draw.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nFirst, the probability of drawing two red balls.\n\nProbability of first ball being red: 4/15.\n\nThen, given that the first ball was red, there are now 3 red balls left and 14 balls in total.\n\nSo, probability of second ball being red given the first was red: 3/14.\n\nTherefore, probability of both balls being red: (4/15) \u00d7 (3/14) = (4 \u00d7 3) / (15 \u00d7 14) = 12/210.\n\nSimilarly, probability of both balls being blue:\n\nFirst ball blue: 6/15.\n\nSecond ball blue given first was blue: 5/14.\n\nSo, (6/15) \u00d7 (5/14) = (6 \u00d7 5) / (15 \u00d7 14) = 30/210.\n\nAnd for green:\n\nFirst ball green: 5/15.\n\nSecond ball green given first was green: 4/14.\n\nSo, (5/15) \u00d7 (4/14) = (5 \u00d7 4) / (15 \u00d7 14) = 20/210.\n\nNow, the total probability of both balls being the same color is the sum of these three probabilities:\n\n12/210 + 30/210 + 20/210 = 62/210.\n\nSimplifying 62/210, divide numerator and denominator by 2: 31/105.\n\nSo, same answer as before: 31/105.\n\nThis reinforces that my initial calculation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the general formula for the probability of drawing two balls of the same color without replacement.\n\nThe formula would be:\n\nP(same color) = (number of ways to choose two balls of the same color) / (total number of ways to choose two balls)\n\nWhich is exactly what I did initially.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 31/105.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{31}{105}} \\]"
