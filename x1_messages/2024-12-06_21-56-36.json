        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A company has 500 employees, and the average salary per employee is $40,000 per year. Additionally, the company spends an extra 25% on benefits for each employee. I need to find out the total annual cost for salaries and benefits combined.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total salary cost without benefits. Since there are 500 employees each making $40,000, I can multiply the number of employees by the average salary:\n\nTotal salary = number of employees \u00d7 average salary\nTotal salary = 500 \u00d7 $40,000\n\nI know that 500 times 40,000 is:\n\n500 \u00d7 40,000 = 20,000,000\n\nSo, the total salary cost is $20,000,000 per year.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total benefits cost. The company spends an additional 25% on benefits for each employee. So, benefits are 25% of the total salary cost.\n\nBenefits = 25% of total salary\nBenefits = 0.25 \u00d7 $20,000,000\n\n0.25 times 20,000,000 is:\n\n0.25 \u00d7 20,000,000 = 5,000,000\n\nSo, the total benefits cost is $5,000,000 per year.\n\nNow, to find the total annual cost for salaries and benefits combined, I need to add the total salary cost and the total benefits cost:\n\nTotal cost = total salary + benefits\nTotal cost = $20,000,000 + $5,000,000\nTotal cost = $25,000,000\n\nTherefore, the total annual cost to the company for salaries and benefits is $25,000,000.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, since the company spends an additional 25% on benefits for each employee, that means the total cost per employee is the salary plus 25% of the salary, which is equivalent to 125% of the salary.\n\nSo, total cost per employee = salary + (25% of salary)\nTotal cost per employee = $40,000 + (0.25 \u00d7 $40,000)\nTotal cost per employee = $40,000 + $10,000\nTotal cost per employee = $50,000\n\nThen, for 500 employees, the total cost would be:\n\nTotal cost = number of employees \u00d7 total cost per employee\nTotal cost = 500 \u00d7 $50,000\nTotal cost = $25,000,000\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, $25,000,000 is indeed the total annual cost for salaries and benefits.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the total cost is the sum of the salaries and the benefits, which is 100% of the salaries plus 25% of the salaries, which totals 125% of the salaries.\n\nSo, total cost = 125% of total salaries\nTotal cost = 1.25 \u00d7 $20,000,000\nTotal cost = $25,000,000\n\nAgain, the same result. I think I've got it right.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me ensure that I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nFirst calculation:\n\nTotal salary = 500 \u00d7 $40,000 = $20,000,000\n\nBenefits = 25% of $20,000,000 = $5,000,000\n\nTotal cost = $20,000,000 + $5,000,000 = $25,000,000\n\nSecond calculation:\n\nTotal cost per employee = $40,000 + (0.25 \u00d7 $40,000) = $40,000 + $10,000 = $50,000\n\nTotal cost = 500 \u00d7 $50,000 = $25,000,000\n\nThird calculation:\n\nTotal cost = 125% of total salaries = 1.25 \u00d7 $20,000,000 = $25,000,000\n\nAll three methods give me the same answer, so I'm confident that $25,000,000 is the correct total annual cost for salaries and benefits.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25000000} \\]"
