        "content": "So I have this problem here. There's a box with balls of different colors: 5 red, 3 blue, and 2 green. I need to find the probability of picking either a red or a blue ball at random. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what probability means. Probability is the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are picking a red or a blue ball, and the total outcomes are picking any ball from the box.\n\nLet me figure out the total number of balls in the box. There are 5 red, 3 blue, and 2 green balls. So, total balls = 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 balls.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of red balls plus the number of blue balls. That's 5 red + 3 blue = 8 favorable outcomes.\n\nSo, the probability P of picking either a red or a blue ball is P = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 8/10.\n\nI can simplify that fraction: 8/10 = 4/5.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal: 4/5 = 0.8.\n\nOr as a percentage: 0.8 = 80%.\n\nSo, the probability is 4/5, or 0.8, or 80%.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the concept of adding probabilities of independent events.\n\nSince picking a red ball and picking a blue ball are two separate events that can't happen at the same time (I can't pick both colors with one pick), I can add their individual probabilities.\n\nFirst, find the probability of picking a red ball: P(red) = number of red balls / total balls = 5/10 = 1/2.\n\nThen, the probability of picking a blue ball: P(blue) = number of blue balls / total balls = 3/10.\n\nNow, add these probabilities: P(red or blue) = P(red) + P(blue) = 1/2 + 3/10.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. 1/2 is equivalent to 5/10, so 5/10 + 3/10 = 8/10, which simplifies to 4/5.\n\nSo, again, I get P(red or blue) = 4/5.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier, which is a good sign.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the probability of not picking a green ball, since the only other options are red and blue.\n\nThe probability of not picking a green ball is equal to 1 minus the probability of picking a green ball.\n\nP(not green) = 1 - P(green).\n\nP(green) = number of green balls / total balls = 2/10 = 1/5.\n\nSo, P(not green) = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.\n\nAgain, the same result. This confirms that my answer is consistent across different methods.\n\nIt's good to see that all these approaches lead to the same probability, which gives me confidence that 4/5 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure I understand this completely, let's consider what each step represents.\n\nFirst, calculating the total number of balls is straightforward: sum up all the balls of each color.\n\nThen, determining the favorable outcomes is identifying how many balls meet the condition of being either red or blue.\n\nDividing favorable by total gives the probability.\n\nAlternatively, adding the individual probabilities of picking a red ball and picking a blue ball also gives the same result, which makes sense because these are mutually exclusive events.\n\nAnd finally, using the complement rule (probability of not picking green) is another valid approach, especially when there are multiple colors to consider.\n\nThis problem seems pretty straightforward, but it's always good to verify the answer using different methods to ensure understanding.\n\nI think that's all for this problem. The probability of picking either a red or a blue ball is 4/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{5}} \\]"
