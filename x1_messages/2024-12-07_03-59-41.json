        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with 8 red balls, 5 blue balls, and 7 green balls. So, first things first, I need to find out the total number of balls in the box. Let's add them up: 8 red plus 5 blue plus 7 green equals 20 balls in total.\n\nNow, the problem says I'm drawing 3 balls randomly without replacement, and I need to find the probability that I get one ball of each color. Okay, so I need one red, one blue, and one green ball in my draw of 3.\n\nFirst, I recall that probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 20 without regard to order, since the order doesn't matter here.\n\nTo find that, I should use combinations, not permutations, because the order doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 20 is C(20, 3). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3!(20 - 3)!) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 1140.\n\nSo, there are 1140 possible ways to draw 3 balls from 20.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to draw one ball of each color. So, one red, one blue, and one green.\n\nSince the draws are without replacement, and the order doesn't matter, I can think of this as choosing one red ball from the 8 available, one blue ball from the 5 available, and one green ball from the 7 available.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose one red ball is C(8, 1) = 8.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose one blue ball is C(5, 1) = 5.\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose one green ball is C(7, 1) = 7.\n\nSince these are independent choices, I can multiply them together to get the total number of favorable outcomes.\n\nSo, number of favorable outcomes = 8 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 = 280.\n\nNow, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability = 280 / 1140.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction. Both 280 and 1140 are divisible by 20.\n\n280 \u00f7 20 = 14\n\n1140 \u00f7 20 = 57\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 14/57.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, total number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 20 is C(20, 3) = 1140. That seems correct.\n\nThen, number of ways to choose one of each color is C(8, 1) \u00d7 C(5, 1) \u00d7 C(7, 1) = 8 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 = 280. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, probability is 280 / 1140 = 14/57.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the problem step by step, considering the draws one at a time.\n\nFirst draw: The probability of drawing a red ball is 8/20.\n\nThen, without replacement, there are 19 balls left.\n\nSecond draw: The probability of drawing a blue ball is 5/19.\n\nThen, without replacement, there are 18 balls left.\n\nThird draw: The probability of drawing a green ball is 7/18.\n\nSo, the probability of this specific sequence (red, then blue, then green) is (8/20) \u00d7 (5/19) \u00d7 (7/18).\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter, I need to consider all possible orders in which I can draw one of each color.\n\nThere are 3! = 6 possible orders: RGB, RBG, GRB, GBR, BGR, BRG.\n\nWait, but since the colors are distinct, and I'm choosing one of each, I need to account for all these orders.\n\nSo, the total probability would be 6 \u00d7 [(8/20) \u00d7 (5/19) \u00d7 (7/18)].\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, (8/20) \u00d7 (5/19) \u00d7 (7/18) = (8 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7) / (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18) = 280 / 6840.\n\nNow, 6 \u00d7 280 = 1680.\n\nSo, 1680 / 6840.\n\nSimplify that fraction:\n\nBoth numerator and denominator are divisible by 240.\n\n1680 \u00f7 240 = 7\n\n6840 \u00f7 240 = 28.5\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm making a mistake in simplifying.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should leave it as 1680 / 6840 and simplify step by step.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 168 / 684.\n\nDivide by 12: 14 / 57.\n\nAgain, I get 14/57.\n\nOkay, so both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nSo, the probability is 14/57.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother approach could be to use probabilities based on hypergeometric distribution, since we're sampling without replacement.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\nP(X) = [C(K, X) \u00d7 C(N - K, n - X)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (20 balls)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (but in this case, we have multiple categories: red, blue, green)\n\n- n is the number of draws (3 balls)\n\n- X is the number of successes (but again, it's a bit different here)\n\nHmm, in this case, since we have three categories, maybe hypergeometric distribution isn't the most straightforward approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of permutations.\n\nTotal number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 20 is P(20, 3) = 20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18.\n\nBut then, since order doesn't matter, I should be using combinations, not permutations.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I considered the step-by-step approach, I used permutations in a way.\n\nActually, in that approach, I considered the order by multiplying probabilities for each draw, and then multiplied by the number of possible orders.\n\nBut ultimately, it gave me the same answer as the combinations approach.\n\nSo, I think the combinations approach is simpler and less error-prone for this problem.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 14/57.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can calculate it another way.\n\nLet's think about it as the probability of not getting two or three balls of the same color.\n\nBut that seems more complicated, because I'd have to calculate the probability of getting two balls of one color and the third of another, plus the probability of getting all three balls of the same color, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nWait, perhaps that's another way to approach it.\n\nSo, total probability is 1 - P(all three same color) - P(exactly two same color).\n\nFirst, P(all three same color):\n\nPossible if all three are red, or all three are blue, or all three are green.\n\nSo, P(all three red) = C(8, 3) / C(20, 3) = (56) / 1140\n\nP(all three blue) = C(5, 3) / C(20, 3) = (10) / 1140\n\nP(all three green) = C(7, 3) / C(20, 3) = (35) / 1140\n\nSo, P(all three same color) = (56 + 10 + 35) / 1140 = 101 / 1140\n\nNext, P(exactly two same color):\n\nThis can happen in three mutually exclusive ways: two red and one blue, two red and one green, two blue and one red, two blue and one green, two green and one red, two green and one blue.\n\nWait, but actually, since order doesn't matter, I need to think in terms of combinations.\n\nSo, for exactly two red and one blue: C(8, 2) \u00d7 C(5, 1) = 28 \u00d7 5 = 140\n\nTwo red and one green: C(8, 2) \u00d7 C(7, 1) = 28 \u00d7 7 = 196\n\nTwo blue and one red: C(5, 2) \u00d7 C(8, 1) = 10 \u00d7 8 = 80\n\nTwo blue and one green: C(5, 2) \u00d7 C(7, 1) = 10 \u00d7 7 = 70\n\nTwo green and one red: C(7, 2) \u00d7 C(8, 1) = 21 \u00d7 8 = 168\n\nTwo green and one blue: C(7, 2) \u00d7 C(5, 1) = 21 \u00d7 5 = 105\n\nSo, total number of ways for exactly two same color is 140 + 196 + 80 + 70 + 168 + 105 = 759\n\nTherefore, P(exactly two same color) = 759 / 1140\n\nNow, P(all three same color) is 101 / 1140\n\nSo, P(not one of each color) = P(all three same color) + P(exactly two same color) = (101 + 759) / 1140 = 860 / 1140\n\nTherefore, P(one of each color) = 1 - 860 / 1140 = (1140 - 860) / 1140 = 280 / 1140 = 14 / 57\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nThis gives me more confidence that 14/57 is the correct probability.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to consider the number of ways to choose one ball of each color and divide by the total number of ways to choose any three balls.\n\nWhich is exactly what I did in the first approach.\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing one ball of each color when drawing three balls without replacement from a box containing 8 red, 5 blue, and 7 green balls is 14/57.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{57}} \\]"
