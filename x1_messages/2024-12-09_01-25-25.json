        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, there are 7 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes take place in total.\n\nFirst, I think about how many handshakes one person would make. If there are 7 people, then each person would shake hands with 6 other people, right? Because they don't shake their own hand. So, if each of the 7 people shakes hands with 6 others, that would be 7 times 6, which is 42 handshakes.\n\nBut wait, that seems too high. I think I'm double-counting here. Because when person A shakes hands with person B, that's the same as person B shaking hands with person A. So, in my initial calculation, I'm counting each handshake twice\u2014once for each participant.\n\nTo correct for that, I need to divide the total by 2. So, 42 divided by 2 equals 21. Maybe the answer is 21 handshakes.\n\nLet me think of another way to approach this. Maybe I can use the formula for combinations. Since each handshake is a unique pair of people, I can calculate the number of ways to choose 2 people out of 7. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n is 7 and k is 2. So, C(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7 - 2)!) = (7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)).\n\nSimplifying that, the 5!, which is 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, cancels out from the numerator and denominator. So, it reduces to (7 \u00d7 6) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 42 / 2 = 21.\n\nAgain, I get 21 handshakes. That seems consistent with my first method.\n\nLet me try a smaller example to verify. Suppose there are 3 people in the room. Each shakes hands with the other two. So, person A shakes with B and C, person B shakes with A and C, and person C shakes with A and B. But again, A shaking with B is the same as B shaking with A, so the total unique handshakes should be 3.\n\nUsing the formula, C(3, 2) = 3! / (2!1!) = (6) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 6 / 2 = 3. That matches my expectation.\n\nAnother example: 4 people. Each shakes hands with 3 others, but again, each handshake is shared between two people. So, total handshakes should be C(4, 2) = 6.\n\nLet's list them to confirm: A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, C-D. Yes, that's 6 handshakes.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to 7 people, C(7, 2) = 21 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as each person shaking hands with every other person, and since the handshake is mutual, I need to count each unique pair only once.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the concept of graph theory, where each person is a node, and each handshake is an edge connecting two nodes. The total number of edges in a complete graph with n nodes is C(n, 2), which again is n(n-1)/2.\n\nFor n=7, it's 7\u00d76/2 = 21.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach I take, I keep arriving at 21 handshakes.\n\nI should also consider if there's any restriction or special condition in the problem that I might have missed. For example, are there any people who don't shake hands with each other for some reason? The problem states that \"each person shakes hands with every other person once,\" so there are no restrictions; everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the total number of handshakes is 21.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]"
