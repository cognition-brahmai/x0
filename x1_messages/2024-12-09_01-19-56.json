        "content": "Let's see. There are 8 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes happen in total.\n\nFirst, I think about one person. If there are 8 people, and one person shakes hands with every other person, that would be 7 handshakes for that one person because they don't shake their own hand.\n\nBut wait, if every person does that, then it would seem like there are 8 people each shaking hands with 7 others, which would be 8 times 7, equaling 56 handshakes.\n\nHowever, I think that counts each handshake twice because when person A shakes hands with person B, it's the same as person B shaking hands with person A. So, in my earlier calculation, that single handshake is being counted once for person A and once for person B.\n\nTherefore, to get the total number of unique handshakes, I need to divide that number by 2 to account for the fact that each handshake is being double-counted.\n\nSo, 56 divided by 2 equals 28.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe there's another way to think about it.\n\nLet me consider the concept of combinations. Since each handshake is between two distinct people, and the order doesn't matter (i.e., the handshake between person A and person B is the same as the one between person B and person A), this sounds like a combination problem.\n\nSpecifically, it's about choosing 2 people out of 8 to shake hands. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 8 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\), so:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{8!}{2!(8 - 2)!} = \\frac{8!}{2! \\times 6!}\n\\]\n\nI know that \\( 8! = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6! \\), so the \\( 6! \\) cancels out:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6!}{2! \\times 6!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{56}{2} = 28\n\\]\n\nSo, using the combination formula, I also get 28 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it step by step. The first person shakes hands with 7 others. The second person has already shaken hands with the first person, so they shake hands with 6 remaining people. The third person has already shaken hands with the first two, so they shake hands with 5 remaining people, and so on.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be:\n\n7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = ?\n\nLet's add them up:\n\n7 + 6 = 13\n\n13 + 5 = 18\n\n18 + 4 = 22\n\n22 + 3 = 25\n\n25 + 2 = 27\n\n27 + 1 = 28\n\n28 + 0 = 28\n\nAgain, I get 28 handshakes.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the formula for the sum of the first \\( n - 1 \\) natural numbers, since each person shakes hands with \\( n - 1 \\) others, and there are \\( n \\) people, but again, each handshake is counted twice.\n\nThe sum of the first \\( n - 1 \\) natural numbers is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in \\( n = 8 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8 \\times 7}{2} = \\frac{56}{2} = 28\n\\]\n\nOnce more, 28 handshakes.\n\nI think I've confirmed it through different methods: the initial approach of \\( \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2} \\), the combination formula \\( C(n, k) \\), and the step-by-step addition of handshakes.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes is 28.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]"
