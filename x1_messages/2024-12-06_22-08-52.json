        "content": "In this dramatic scene, Christian confronts Cyrano, realizing that Roxane loves not him but Cyrano, whose words and soul she admires. Cyrano, who indeed loves Roxane, is torn between his feelings and his friend's happiness. Christian insists on revealing the truth to Roxane, but Cyrano resists, fearing the consequences. Roxane enters, and Christian asks Cyrano to speak to her about something important. As they talk, a shot is heard, and Roxane rushes to see Christian lying wounded, having been shot in battle. She mourns him, unaware that Cyrano has been writing letters in Christian's name to express his own love to her. As the battle rages on, Cyrano vows to fight valiantly, driven by a double motivation: to avenge his fallen friend and his lost happiness. The scene culminates in a fierce battle, with Cyrano leading the remaining cadets in a final charge, holding high Roxane's handkerchief as a makeshift banner. The play ends with Cyrano reciting a poem about the bold Cadets of Gascony as the battle reaches its climax."
