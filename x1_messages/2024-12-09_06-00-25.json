        "content": "Ah, you're referring to a classic board game where players try to figure out which character their opponent has hidden, based on certain physical traits or features. Hmm, there are several games that involve deduction and guessing based on attributes, but one that comes immediately to mind is \"Clue\" or \"Cluedo,\" although that's more about solving a mystery based on clues related to a crime.\n\nWait, perhaps you're thinking of a different game where characters have specific physical features that you have to deduce through a series of questions or observations. One game that fits this description is \"Guess Who?\" It's a two-player game where each player has a board with multiple characters, each having distinct physical features like hair color, glasses, hats, etc. Players take turns asking yes-or-no questions about their opponent's secret character to narrow down the possibilities and guess who it is.\n\nIs that the game you were thinking of?"
