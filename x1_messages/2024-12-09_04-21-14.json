        "content": "Let's see. I have a jar with marbles of different colors: 5 red, 7 green, and 9 blue. So, the total number of marbles is 5 + 7 + 9, which equals 21 marbles.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the probability of drawing a red marble followed by a green marble without replacing the first marble. Okay, so this is about dependent events because the outcome of the first draw affects the second draw.\n\nFirst, I need to find the probability of drawing a red marble first. There are 5 red marbles out of 21 total marbles, so the probability is 5/21.\n\nNext, without replacing the first marble, I need to draw a green marble. Since I've already drawn one marble (which was red), there are now 20 marbles left in the jar. The number of green marbles remains 7 because I drew a red one first.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a green marble after having drawn a red one is 7/20.\n\nTo find the overall probability of both events happening in sequence, I need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nTherefore, the overall probability is (5/21) * (7/20).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, multiply the numerators: 5 * 7 = 35\n\nThen, multiply the denominators: 21 * 20 = 420\n\nSo, the probability is 35/420.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 35.\n\n35 \u00f7 35 = 1\n\n420 \u00f7 35 = 12\n\nSo, the simplified probability is 1/12.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal marbles initially: 5 red + 7 green + 9 blue = 21\n\nProbability of first draw being red: 5/21\n\nAfter drawing red, total marbles left: 20\n\nNumber of green marbles still: 7\n\nProbability of second draw being green: 7/20\n\nOverall probability: (5/21) * (7/20) = (5*7)/(21*20) = 35/420\n\nSimplify 35/420 by dividing numerator and denominator by 35: 1/12\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a red marble followed by a green marble without replacement is 1/12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{12}} \\]"
