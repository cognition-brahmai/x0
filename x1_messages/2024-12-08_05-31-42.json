        "content": "I'm here to help you with your programming task! It sounds like you need to create a C++ class for a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, you need to handle errors for invalid inputs and division by zero. Finally, you'll write a `main` function to demonstrate the use of this class by taking user input for two numbers and an operation, then displaying the result.\n\nLet's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Design the Calculator Class\n\nFirst, we need to design the class structure. The class should have methods for each arithmetic operation. Since we're dealing with integers, the class will accept two integers as operands.\n\nHere's a basic outline of the class:\n\n```cpp\nclass SimpleCalculator {\nprivate:\n    int num1;\n    int num2;\n\npublic:\n    SimpleCalculator(int a, int b) : num1(a), num2(b) {}\n\n    int add() {\n        return num1 + num2;\n    }\n\n    int subtract() {\n        return num1 - num2;\n    }\n\n    int multiply() {\n        return num1 * num2;\n    }\n\n    double divide() {\n        if (num2 == 0) {\n            throw std::invalid_argument(\"Division by zero is not allowed.\");\n        }\n        return static_cast<double>(num1) / num2;\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### Step 2: Error Handling\n\nWe need to handle invalid inputs and division by zero. For division by zero, we're throwing an `std::invalid_argument` exception. For invalid inputs, we'll assume that the user will input valid integers, but we can add input validation in the `main` function.\n\n### Step 3: Main Function\n\nThe `main` function will handle user input, create an instance of the `SimpleCalculator` class, perform the specified operation, and display the result.\n\nHere's how you can structure the `main` function:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <stdexcept>\n\nint main() {\n    int num1, num2;\n    char operation;\n\n    std::cout << \"Enter first integer: \";\n    if (!(std::cin >> num1)) {\n        std::cerr << \"Invalid input. Please enter integers only.\" << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    std::cout << \"Enter second integer: \";\n    if (!(std::cin >> num2)) {\n        std::cerr << \"Invalid input. Please enter integers only.\" << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    std::cout << \"Enter operation (+, -, *, /): \";\n    std::cin >> operation;\n\n    SimpleCalculator calc(num1, num2);\n\n    try {\n        switch (operation) {\n            case '+':\n                std::cout << \"Result: \" << calc.add() << std::endl;\n                break;\n            case '-':\n                std::cout << \"Result: \" << calc.subtract() << std::endl;\n                break;\n            case '*':\n                std::cout << \"Result: \" << calc.multiply() << std::endl;\n                break;\n            case '/':\n                std::cout << \"Result: \" << calc.divide() << std::endl;\n                break;\n            default:\n                std::cerr << \"Invalid operation. Please use +, -, *, or /.\" << std::endl;\n                return 1;\n        }\n    } catch (const std::invalid_argument& e) {\n        std::cerr << e.what() << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Calculator Class**:\n   - Contains private members `num1` and `num2`.\n   - Constructor initializes these members.\n   - Methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n   - Division checks for zero denominator and throws an exception if division by zero is attempted.\n\n2. **Main Function**:\n   - Prompts user for two integers and the operation to perform.\n   - Reads inputs and checks for valid integer inputs.\n   - Creates a `SimpleCalculator` object with the provided integers.\n   - Performs the operation based on user input and handles any exceptions that may be thrown.\n\nThis should cover the requirements you've outlined.
