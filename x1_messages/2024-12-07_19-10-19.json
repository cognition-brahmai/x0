Here's a blues song about unrequited love with nature and weather metaphors:)\n\n**Song Title: Stormy Hearts**\n\n(Verse 1)  \nWell, I woke up this mornin', sky was grey and dreary,  \nJust like my heart, feelin' empty and weary.  \nRaindrops fallin' down, ticklin' the windowpane,  \nEach one a teardrop, from love unrequited pain.\n\n(Chorus)  \nOh, stormy hearts, tossed in the wind,  \nLove's a hurricane, leaves me spin, spin, spin.  \nRain clouds gather, over my soul so blue,  \nIn this weather of love, I'm lost and I'm through.\n\n(Verse 2)  \nThe sun tries to peek through, but clouds won't let it shine,  \nJust like her smile, never meant for me to align.  \nBitter cold winds blow, chillin' my very bones,  \nEach gust a reminder, of love that never grows.\n\n(Chorus)  \nOh, stormy hearts, tossed in the wind,  \nLove's a hurricane, leaves me spin, spin, spin.  \nRain clouds gather, over my soul so blue,  \nIn this weather of love, I'm lost and I'm through.\n\n(Bridge)  \nLightning strikes, but it ain't for me,  \nJust flashes of hope, that memory can't see.  \nThunder roars, echoing my cries,  \nIn this tempest of love, under the endless skies.\n\n(Verse 3)  \nThe river flows, carries my sorrows away,  \nBut in its current, I can't find a single ray.  \nOf love returned, or warmth to hold,  \nJust the cold embrace of the night, so bold.\n\n(Chorus)  \nOh, stormy hearts, tossed in the wind,  \nLove's a hurricane, leaves me spin, spin, spin.  \nRain clouds gather, over my soul so blue,  \nIn this weather of love, I'm lost and I'm through.\n\n(Outro)  \nSo here I stand, in this stormy weather,  \nWith a heart that's broken, and no one to gather.  \nMaybe one day, the sun will break through,  \nBut for now, in this blues, I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck.\n\n**End of Song**"
