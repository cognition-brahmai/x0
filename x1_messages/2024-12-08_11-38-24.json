        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students playing sports, and I need to figure out how many students don't play either soccer or basketball. Let's see... there are 30 students in total. Among them, 12 boys play soccer, and 10 girls play basketball. Also, 5 boys play basketball, and 3 girls play soccer. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky at first, but if I break it down step by step, I think I can manage.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many students play at least one of the two sports: soccer or basketball. Then, I can subtract that number from the total number of students to find out how many don't play either sport.\n\nLet's start by identifying how many students play soccer and how many play basketball, considering that some students play both sports.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- 12 boys play soccer.\n\n- 10 girls play basketball.\n\n- 5 boys play basketball.\n\n- 3 girls play soccer.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says there are 12 boys who play soccer and 10 girls who play basketball, but then it also mentions that 5 boys also play basketball and 3 girls also play soccer. So, it seems like there are some students who play both sports.\n\nLet me try to organize this information better. Maybe I can use a Venn diagram in my mind to visualize this.\n\nLet\u2019s consider:\n\n- Total students: 30.\n\n- Let\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let B_s be the set of boys who play soccer.\n\n- Let G_b be the set of girls who play basketball.\n\n- Let B_b be the set of boys who play basketball.\n\n- Let G_s be the set of girls who play soccer.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- |B_s| = 12.\n\n- |G_b| = 10.\n\n- |B_b| = 5.\n\n- |G_s| = 3.\n\nBut I need to find out how many students play at least one sport, which would be the union of those who play soccer and those who play basketball.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many students play soccer (both boys and girls):\n\nStudents playing soccer, S = B_s + G_s = 12 + 3 = 15.\n\nSimilarly, students playing basketball, B = B_b + G_b = 5 + 10 = 15.\n\nBut if I just add S and B, that's 15 + 15 = 30, which is the total number of students. However, this might be double-counting those who play both sports.\n\nWait, do I know how many students play both sports?\n\nThe problem says that 5 boys play basketball, and among them, some may also play soccer. Similarly, 3 girls play soccer, and some may also play basketball.\n\nBut actually, the problem doesn't directly say how many students play both sports. It just gives the numbers for each category.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to assume that the groups are mutually exclusive unless specified otherwise.\n\nBut wait, it says \"5 boys also play basketball\" and \"3 girls also play soccer,\" which suggests that there are boys who play both soccer and basketball and girls who play both soccer and basketball.\n\nWait, no. Let's read that again.\n\n\"It says 5 boys also play basketball and 3 girls also play soccer.\"\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Let's re-examine the problem statement:\n\n\"In a class of 30 students, there are 12 boys who play soccer and 10 girls who play basketball. If 5 boys also play basketball and 3 girls also play soccer, how many students in the class do not play either sport?\"\n\nSo, 12 boys play soccer, and among them, 5 also play basketball. Similarly, 10 girls play basketball, and among them, 3 also play soccer.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the way it's phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let's parse it carefully:\n\n\"12 boys play soccer and 10 girls play basketball. If 5 boys also play basketball and 3 girls also play soccer, how many students in the class do not play either sport?\"\n\nSo, it's saying that there are 12 boys who play soccer, and separately, 10 girls who play basketball. Then, it adds that 5 boys also play basketball (in addition to soccer, I assume), and 3 girls also play soccer (in addition to basketball, I assume).\n\nWait, maybe I need to interpret it differently. Perhaps the \"also\" indicates that these students play both sports.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- 12 boys play soccer, and among them, 5 also play basketball.\n\n- 10 girls play basketball, and among them, 3 also play soccer.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- The number of boys who play only soccer is 12 - 5 = 7.\n\n- The number of girls who play only basketball is 10 - 3 = 7.\n\n- The number of boys who play both soccer and basketball is 5.\n\n- The number of girls who play both soccer and basketball is 3.\n\nAdditionally, there are boys who play only basketball and girls who play only soccer, but the problem doesn't specify those numbers directly.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"5 boys also play basketball\" and \"3 girls also play soccer,\" which seems to imply that these are in addition to the initial counts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider it this way:\n\n- There are 12 boys who play soccer.\n\n- There are 10 girls who play basketball.\n\n- Among the boys, 5 also play basketball in addition to soccer.\n\n- Among the girls, 3 also play soccer in addition to basketball.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if the 5 boys play both soccer and basketball, then they are already included in the 12 boys who play soccer.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should use set theory to model this.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Let B be the set of boys.\n\n- Let G be the set of girls.\n\n- Let S be the set of students who play soccer.\n\n- Let Bk be the set of students who play basketball.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- |B| + |G| = 30.\n\n- |S \u2229 B| = 12 (boys who play soccer).\n\n- |Bk \u2229 G| = 10 (girls who play basketball).\n\n- |Bk \u2229 B| = 5 (boys who play basketball).\n\n- |S \u2229 G| = 3 (girls who play soccer).\n\nWait, but |Bk \u2229 B| = 5 means that 5 boys play basketball. However, earlier it was stated that 12 boys play soccer.\n\nBut we need to find out how many students play at least one sport, which is |S \u222a Bk|.\n\nWe know that |S \u222a Bk| = |S| + |Bk| - |S \u2229 Bk|.\n\nBut we need to find |S| and |Bk|, and |S \u2229 Bk|.\n\nFrom the information given:\n\n- |S \u2229 B| = 12 (boys who play soccer).\n\n- |Bk \u2229 G| = 10 (girls who play basketball).\n\n- |Bk \u2229 B| = 5 (boys who play basketball).\n\n- |S \u2229 G| = 3 (girls who play soccer).\n\nWait, but |S| = |S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 G| = 12 + 3 = 15.\n\nSimilarly, |Bk| = |Bk \u2229 B| + |Bk \u2229 G| = 5 + 10 = 15.\n\nNow, |S \u222a Bk| = |S| + |Bk| - |S \u2229 Bk|.\n\nWe need to find |S \u2229 Bk|, which is the number of students who play both sports.\n\nBut from the given information, the students who play both sports are those who are boys playing both soccer and basketball and girls playing both soccer and basketball.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"5 boys also play basketball\" and \"3 girls also play soccer,\" which might mean that these are the students who play both sports.\n\nAssuming that, then |S \u2229 Bk| = 5 (boys who play both) + 3 (girls who play both) = 8.\n\nTherefore, |S \u222a Bk| = 15 + 15 - 8 = 22.\n\nThen, the number of students who do not play either sport is total students minus those who play at least one sport: 30 - 22 = 8.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this.\n\nIf |S| = 15 and |Bk| = 15, and |S \u2229 Bk| = 8, then |S \u222a Bk| = 15 + 15 - 8 = 22.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of a Venn diagram.\n\n- Total students: 30.\n\n- Students playing soccer: 15.\n\n- Students playing basketball: 15.\n\n- Students playing both: 8.\n\nSo, the number playing only soccer is 15 - 8 = 7.\n\nThe number playing only basketball is 15 - 8 = 7.\n\nThe number playing both is 8.\n\nTherefore, total playing at least one sport is 7 + 7 + 8 = 22.\n\nThus, students not playing any sport are 30 - 22 = 8.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that the interpretation of \"5 boys also play basketball\" and \"3 girls also play soccer\" is correct.\n\nIf \"5 boys also play basketball,\" does that mean these 5 boys play both soccer and basketball, in addition to the 12 boys who play soccer?\n\nWait, no. If 12 boys play soccer and among them, 5 also play basketball, then the number of boys who play both soccer and basketball is 5.\n\nSimilarly, if 10 girls play basketball and among them, 3 also play soccer, then the number of girls who play both soccer and basketball is 3.\n\nTherefore, the total number of students who play both sports is 5 (boys) + 3 (girls) = 8.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem meant that 5 boys play basketball in addition to the 12 boys who play soccer, then the total number of boys who play basketball would be 5 + the boys who play only basketball.\n\nBut the problem says \"5 boys also play basketball,\" which probably means in addition to playing soccer, they play basketball too.\n\nSimilarly, \"3 girls also play soccer\" likely means in addition to playing basketball, they play soccer too.\n\nTherefore, my initial interpretation seems correct.\n\nHence, the number of students who do not play either sport is 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
