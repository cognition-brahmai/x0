        "content": "I'm here to help you with your Python script for interacting with Google Cloud Storage! To get started, make sure you have the `google-cloud-storage` library installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install google-cloud-storage\n```\n\nNext, you'll need to set up authentication with Google Cloud. This typically involves creating service account credentials and setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your service account key file.\n\nOnce that's set up, you can proceed to write your script. Below is an example that demonstrates how to upload, download, list, and delete objects in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.\n\n```python\nfrom google.cloud import storage\n\ndef upload_blob(bucket_name, source_file_name, destination_blob_name):\n    \"\"\"Uploads a file to the bucket.\"\"\"\n    storage_client = storage.Client()\n    bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)\n    blob = bucket.blob(destination_blob_name)\n\n    blob.upload_from_filename(source_file_name)\n\n    print(f\"File {source_file_name} uploaded to {destination_blob_name}.\")\n\ndef download_blob(bucket_name, source_blob_name, destination_file_name):\n    \"\"\"Downloads a blob from the bucket.\"\"\"\n    storage_client = storage.Client()\n    bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)\n    blob = bucket.blob(source_blob_name)\n\n    blob.download_to_filename(destination_file_name)\n\n    print(f\"Blob {source_blob_name} downloaded to {destination_file_name}.\")\n\ndef list_blobs(bucket_name):\n    \"\"\"Lists all the blobs in the bucket.\"\"\"\n    storage_client = storage.Client()\n    bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)\n\n    blobs = bucket.list_blobs()\n\n    for blob in blobs:\n        print(blob.name)\n\ndef delete_blob(bucket_name, blob_name):\n    \"\"\"Deletes a blob from the bucket.\"\"\"\n    storage_client = storage.Client()\n    bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)\n    blob = bucket.blob(blob_name)\n\n    blob.delete()\n\n    print(f\"Blob {blob_name} deleted.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Set your bucket name\n    bucket_name = \"your-bucket-name\"\n\n    # Upload a file\n    source_file_name = \"local/path/to/file.txt\"\n    destination_blob_name = \"storage-object-name.txt\"\n    upload_blob(bucket_name, source_file_name, destination_blob_name)\n\n    # Download a file\n    source_blob_name = \"storage-object-name.txt\"\n    destination_file_name = \"local/path/to/downloaded_file.txt\"\n    download_blob(bucket_name, source_blob_name, destination_file_name)\n\n    # List all objects in the bucket\n    list_blobs(bucket_name)\n\n    # Delete an object\n    blob_name_to_delete = \"storage-object-name.txt\"\n    delete_blob(bucket_name, blob_name_to_delete)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Upload a File:**\n   - The `upload_blob` function takes the bucket name, local file path, and the desired name for the object in the bucket.\n   - It uses the `upload_from_filename` method to upload the file.\n\n2. **Download a File:**\n   - The `download_blob` function takes the bucket name, object name in the bucket, and the local path where the file should be saved.\n   - It uses the `download_to_filename` method to download the file.\n\n3. **List All Objects:**\n   - The `list_blobs` function takes the bucket name and lists all the objects in that bucket.\n   - It uses the `list_blobs` method to get an iterator of all blobs in the bucket.\n\n4. **Delete an Object:**\n   - The `delete_blob` function takes the bucket name and the object name to be deleted.\n   - It uses the `delete` method to remove the blob from the bucket.\n\nMake sure to replace `\"your-bucket-name\"`, `\"local/path/to/file.txt\"`, `\"storage-object-name.txt\"`, and other placeholders with actual values relevant to your use case.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
