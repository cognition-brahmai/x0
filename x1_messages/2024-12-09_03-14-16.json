        "content": "So, I've got this problem here: If you have a box of chocolates and eat 2 every day until they're gone, and the box lasted you 14 days, how many chocolates were originally in the box? And I need to include my logic in the answer.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. So, I'm eating 2 chocolates every day, and this continues for 14 days until the box is empty. So, I need to find out how many chocolates were there at the beginning.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider the rate at which I'm consuming the chocolates. I'm eating 2 chocolates per day. And this continues for 14 days. So, maybe I can multiply the number of chocolates I eat each day by the number of days to find the total.\n\nSo, that would be 2 chocolates/day times 14 days. Let's do the math: 2 times 14 is 28. So, there were originally 28 chocolates in the box.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check this. Suppose there were 28 chocolates, and I eat 2 every day. So, on day 1, I eat 2, leaving 26; day 2, eat another 2, leaving 24; and so on, until day 14, when I eat the last 2 chocolates, leaving 0. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the total number of chocolates is equal to the daily consumption multiplied by the number of days. So, total chocolates = 2 chocolates/day * 14 days = 28 chocolates.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider it a simple multiplication problem. If you have 14 days and each day you eat 2 chocolates, then the total is just 14 times 2, which is 28.\n\nI could also consider it as an addition problem, where each day you add 2 chocolates to your consumption total, over 14 days. So, 2 + 2 + 2 + ... + 2 (14 times), which again is 28.\n\nMoreover, if I were to plot this on a graph, with days on one axis and chocolates consumed on the other, it would be a straight line with a slope of 2, and after 14 days, the total would be 28.\n\nSo, all these different approaches lead me to the same conclusion that there were originally 28 chocolates in the box.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this. For example, is there a possibility that the number of chocolates eaten per day changes? The problem says \"eat 2 every day,\" so it's consistent.\n\nAlso, it says \"until they're gone,\" which means that on the last day, you eat the remaining chocolates, which in this case is 2, as the box lasts exactly 14 days.\n\nSo, no, I don't think there's any other factor to consider. The answer should be 28 chocolates.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any remainder or something. Like, what if the total number of chocolates isn't exactly divisible by 2, but the problem says I eat 2 every day until they're gone, and the box lasted exactly 14 days, so it must be exactly 28.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula for the total amount: total = rate \u00d7 time. Here, the rate is 2 chocolates per day, and the time is 14 days, so total = 2 \u00d7 14 = 28.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]"
