The expression is:\n\n((4^2 - 3 * 5) + 7) / 2\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting inside the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Calculate the exponent:\n\n4^2 = 16\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n((16 - 3 * 5) + 7) / 2\n\n2. Next, perform the multiplication:\n\n3 * 5 = 15\n\nNow it's:\n\n((16 - 15) + 7) / 2\n\n3. Then, do the subtraction inside the parentheses:\n\n16 - 15 = 1\n\nNow it's:\n\n(1 + 7) / 2\n\n4. Perform the addition inside the parentheses:\n\n1 + 7 = 8\n\nNow it's:\n\n8 / 2\n\n5. Finally, do the division:\n\n8 / 2 = 4\n\nSo, the answer is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
