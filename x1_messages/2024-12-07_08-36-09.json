        "content": "I'm going to help you develop a C++ application that solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using dynamic programming. The TSP is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Problem Understanding**:\n   - We have a set of cities and the distances between each pair of cities.\n   - We need to find the shortest route that starts from a given city, visits all other cities exactly once, and returns to the starting city.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Solution**:\n   - Use a dynamic programming approach to efficiently solve the TSP.\n   - Maintain a table to store the minimum cost of traveling from the starting city to each subset of cities and back to the starting city.\n\n3. **Bitmasking**:\n   - Use bitmasking to represent subsets of cities for efficient computation.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <limits.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int N = 1 << 18; // Maximum number of subsets\nconst int C = 19; // Maximum number of cities\nint dp[C][N];\nint dist[C][C];\nint n;\n\nint tsp(int mask, int pos) {\n    if (mask == (1 << n) - 1) {\n        return dist[pos][0];\n    }\n    if (dp[pos][mask] != -1) {\n        return dp[pos][mask];\n    }\n    int ans = INT_MAX;\n    for (int city = 0; city < n; city++) {\n        if (!(mask & (1 << city)) && dist[pos][city] != 0) {\n            int new_ans = dist[pos][city] + tsp(mask | (1 << city), city);\n            if (new_ans < ans) {\n                ans = new_ans;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    dp[pos][mask] = ans;\n    return ans;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    cin >> n;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n            cin >> dist[i][j];\n        }\n    }\n    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));\n    int ans = tsp(1, 0);\n    cout << \"The shortest path is \" << ans << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Read the number of cities (`n`) and the distance matrix.\n   - Initialize a DP table `dp` with dimensions `[n][N]` where `N` is the maximum number of subsets.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Function (`tsp`)**:\n   - `mask`: A bitmask representing the set of visited cities.\n   - `pos`: The current city.\n   - If all cities are visited (`mask == (1 << n) - 1`), return the distance from the current city back to city 0.\n   - If the result for the current state is already computed, return it.\n   - Otherwise, iterate through all cities, choose the next city to visit, and recursively compute the minimum cost.\n\n3. **Main Function**:\n   - Read input: number of cities and the distance matrix.\n   - Initialize the DP table with -1.\n   - Call the `tsp` function starting from city 0 with the initial mask (only city 0 is visited).\n   - Output the shortest path found.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the shortest path using dynamic programming and bitmasking to handle subsets of cities."
