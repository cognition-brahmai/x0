        "content": "I've heard the myth that lemmings commit mass suicide, but it's not entirely accurate. Lemmings are small rodents native to Arctic tundra regions, and they do experience periodic population booms and crashes. During these population surges, lemmings may migrate in large numbers in search of food and new territories. This behavior can sometimes lead to them accidentally falling off cliffs or drowning in bodies of water while attempting to cross them.\n\nThe misconception likely originated from a 1958 Disney documentary called \"White Wilderness,\" where filmmakers artificially created scenes of lemmings jumping off cliffs to make the documentary more dramatic. This portrayal gave rise to the myth that lemmings engage in mass suicide, but in reality, their migrations are driven by survival instincts rather than a desire to die.\n\nSo, to answer your question: No, lemmings do not commit mass suicide. Their migrations can sometimes result in accidental deaths, but this is not a deliberate act of self-destruction."
