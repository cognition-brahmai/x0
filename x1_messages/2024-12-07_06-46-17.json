One of his famous equations, E=mc^2, demonstrates the equivalence of energy (E) and mass (m), with c being the speed of light in a vacuum. This equation laid the groundwork for the creation of atomic energy and the atomic bomb. \n\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nWhat is Albert Einstein's famous equation and what does it signify?\nCitation?\nENDINSTRUCTION"

        "content": "Albert Einstein's famous equation is E=mc\u00b2. This equation signifies the principle of mass-energy equivalence, which states that energy (E) and mass (m) are different forms of the same thing and can be converted into each other. The 'c' represents the speed of light in a vacuum, which is a constant. This equation revolutionized physics by showing that a small amount of mass can be converted into a large amount of energy, as the speed of light squared is a very large number. This principle is fundamental to nuclear reactions and the operation of nuclear power plants and atomic bombs.\n\nCitation: \"Albert Einstein.\" Biography.com, A&E Networks Television, www.biography.com/scientist/albert-einstein."
