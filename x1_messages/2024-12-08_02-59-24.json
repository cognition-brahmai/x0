        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, there are 8 teams in a tournament, and each team plays every other team exactly once. I need to find out how many games will be played in total.\n\nFirst, I think about how many games each team plays. Since there are 8 teams and each plays every other team once, each team will play 7 games (because there are 7 other teams). So, if I multiply the number of teams by the number of games each plays, that would be 8 teams times 7 games, which equals 56 games.\n\nBut wait, that seems too high. I think I'm double-counting here because when team A plays team B, it's one game, but in my previous calculation, I counted it as one game for team A and another for team B, so that's double-counting the same game.\n\nTo correct this, I need to divide the total by 2 to account for the fact that each game is counted twice in my initial calculation. So, 56 divided by 2 equals 28 games. That seems more reasonable.\n\nAnother way to think about this is using combinations. Since each game is a unique combination of two teams, I can use the combination formula to find the number of unique pairs of teams. The combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n is 8 (teams), and k is 2 (since two teams play against each other in each game). So, C(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8 - 2)!) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 6!) = (8 \u00d7 7) / 2 = 56 / 2 = 28.\n\nThis matches my earlier result of 28 games.\n\nLet me consider another approach to verify. I can list out the games manually, but that might be time-consuming for 8 teams. Let's try with a smaller number of teams to see if the pattern holds.\n\nSuppose there are 3 teams: A, B, and C. Each plays every other team once:\n\n- A vs B\n\n- A vs C\n\n- B vs C\n\nThat's 3 games. Using my earlier method: 3 teams, each plays 2 games, total 6, divided by 2 equals 3. Correct.\n\nWith 4 teams: A, B, C, D.\n\n- A vs B\n\n- A vs C\n\n- A vs D\n\n- B vs C\n\n- B vs D\n\n- C vs D\n\nThat's 6 games. Using the formula: 4 teams, each plays 3 games, total 12, divided by 2 equals 6. Correct again.\n\nSo, for 8 teams, using the same logic, it should be 8 teams, each plays 7 games, total 56, divided by 2 equals 28 games.\n\nAlternatively, using the combination formula C(8, 2) = 28.\n\nI think this is the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, are there any restrictions or additional rules in the tournament that might affect the number of games? The problem doesn't mention any, so I assume it's a straightforward round-robin tournament where each pair of teams plays exactly once.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any byes or if some teams don't play each other for some reason, but again, the problem states that every team plays every other team exactly once.\n\nSo, I believe the total number of games is 28.\n\nJust to double-check, I can use another method. The total number of games in a round-robin tournament with n teams is given by the formula n(n-1)/2. Plugging in n=8: 8*7/2 = 56/2 = 28. Same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as each team playing a certain number of games, but again, I need to account for the double-counting.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently through multiple methods: manual counting for smaller numbers, the combination formula, and the standard formula for round-robin tournaments.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is 28 games in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]"
