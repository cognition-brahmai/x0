        "content": "So I've got this problem about a rectangular garden. It says that the length is 3 meters more than twice its width, and the area is 70 square meters. I need to find the dimensions, which means both the length and the width. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that for a rectangle, the area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, area = length \u00d7 width. That makes sense. Now, the problem gives me a relationship between the length and the width. It says the length is 3 meters more than twice its width. So, if I let the width be some variable, say W, then the length would be 2 times W plus 3 meters. So, length = 2W + 3.\n\nAlright, now I have expressions for both length and width in terms of W. And I know that length times width equals 70 square meters. So, I can set up an equation: (2W + 3) \u00d7 W = 70.\n\nLet me write that down: (2W + 3) * W = 70.\n\nNow, I need to solve for W. First, I'll expand the left side: 2W * W is 2W\u00b2, and 3 * W is 3W. So, the equation becomes: 2W\u00b2 + 3W = 70.\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation. I need to set it to zero to solve for W. So, subtract 70 from both sides: 2W\u00b2 + 3W - 70 = 0.\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: 2W\u00b2 + 3W - 70 = 0.\n\nI can solve this using the quadratic formula, which is W = [-B \u00b1 sqrt(B\u00b2 - 4AC)] / (2A), where A, B, and C are the coefficients from the quadratic equation Ax\u00b2 + Bx + C = 0.\n\nIn this case, A = 2, B = 3, and C = -70.\n\nPlugging these into the quadratic formula: W = [-3 \u00b1 sqrt(3\u00b2 - 4*2*(-70))] / (2*2).\n\nFirst, calculate the discriminant: B\u00b2 - 4AC = 9 - 4*2*(-70) = 9 + 560 = 569.\n\nSo, W = [-3 \u00b1 sqrt(569)] / 4.\n\nWait a minute, sqrt(569) is not a perfect square. Let me check if I did something wrong.\n\nLet me double-check the discriminant: B\u00b2 - 4AC = 9 - 4*2*(-70) = 9 + 560 = 569. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nHmm, sqrt(569) is approximately 23.85, but that doesn't seem to simplify nicely. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me go back. Maybe I can factor the quadratic equation instead.\n\nSo, 2W\u00b2 + 3W - 70 = 0.\n\nI'll try to factor this. I need two numbers that multiply to 2*(-70) = -140 and add up to 3.\n\nLet's see, 14 and -10: 14*(-10) = -140, and 14 + (-10) = 4. Not quite.\n\nHow about 14 and -10 don't work. Let's try 20 and -7: 20*(-7) = -140, and 20 + (-7) = 13. Still not 3.\n\nWait, 25 and -8: 25*(-8) = -200, which is too much.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the quadratic formula after all, even if it's not a perfect square.\n\nSo, W = [-3 \u00b1 sqrt(569)] / 4.\n\nBut sqrt(569) is approximately 23.85, as I said earlier.\n\nSo, W = [-3 + 23.85]/4 or W = [-3 - 23.85]/4.\n\nFirst option: (-3 + 23.85)/4 = 20.85/4 = 5.2125 meters.\n\nSecond option: (-3 - 23.85)/4 = -26.85/4 = -6.7125 meters.\n\nBut a width can't be negative, so the second option is invalid.\n\nTherefore, W \u2248 5.2125 meters.\n\nNow, to find the length, L = 2W + 3 = 2*(5.2125) + 3 = 10.425 + 3 = 13.425 meters.\n\nSo, the dimensions are approximately width = 5.21 meters and length = 13.43 meters.\n\nBut let me check if this gives an area of 70 square meters.\n\n5.21 * 13.43 \u2248 70.0003, which is very close to 70, considering rounding errors.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to get exact values without decimals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake assuming that the discriminant is 569.\n\nLet me recalculate the discriminant: B\u00b2 - 4AC = 9 - 4*2*(-70) = 9 + 560 = 569.\n\nWait, 569 is indeed the discriminant.\n\nBut maybe I can factor the quadratic equation differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use completing the square.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with 2W\u00b2 + 3W - 70 = 0.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 2: W\u00b2 + (3/2)W - 35 = 0.\n\nNow, move the constant term to the other side: W\u00b2 + (3/2)W = 35.\n\nNext, complete the square.\n\nTake half of the coefficient of W, which is 3/4, and square it: (3/4)\u00b2 = 9/16.\n\nAdd 9/16 to both sides: W\u00b2 + (3/2)W + 9/16 = 35 + 9/16.\n\nConvert 35 to sixteenths: 35 = 560/16.\n\nSo, 560/16 + 9/16 = 569/16.\n\nTherefore, (W + 3/4)\u00b2 = 569/16.\n\nTake square roots of both sides: W + 3/4 = \u00b1sqrt(569)/4.\n\nSo, W = -3/4 \u00b1 sqrt(569)/4.\n\nSince width can't be negative, W = [-3 + sqrt(569)] / 4.\n\nThat's the same result as before.\n\nSo, the exact value is W = [-3 + sqrt(569)] / 4 meters.\n\nAnd L = 2W + 3 = 2*([-3 + sqrt(569)] / 4) + 3 = [-3 + sqrt(569)] / 2 + 3.\n\nTo simplify: [-3 + sqrt(569)] / 2 + 6/2 = [(-3 + sqrt(569)) + 6]/2 = [3 + sqrt(569)] / 2 meters.\n\nSo, the exact dimensions are:\n\nWidth: [-3 + sqrt(569)] / 4 meters\n\nLength: [3 + sqrt(569)] / 2 meters\n\nAlternatively, using approximate values:\n\nWidth \u2248 5.21 meters\n\nLength \u2248 13.43 meters\n\nEither way, the dimensions of the garden are approximately 5.21 meters by 13.43 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe dimensions of the garden are \\boxed{5.21 \\text{ meters by } 13.43 \\text{ meters}}."
