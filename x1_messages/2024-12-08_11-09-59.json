        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is (4^2 - 3) / (2 + 1)^2. So, first things first, I need to calculate what's inside the parentheses.\n\nStarting with the numerator: 4^2 - 3.\n\n4^2 means 4 squared, which is 4 multiplied by itself. So, 4 times 4 is 16. Then, subtract 3 from that: 16 - 3 equals 13. So, the numerator is 13.\n\nNow, the denominator: (2 + 1)^2.\n\nFirst, add 2 and 1, which is 3. Then, square that result: 3^2 is 3 times 3, which is 9. So, the denominator is 9.\n\nNow, I have 13 divided by 9. That's 13/9. It can also be expressed as a mixed number or a decimal, but since the question doesn't specify, I'll leave it as 13/9.\n\nSo, the final answer is 13/9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{9}} \\]"
