        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I have 5 red balls, 4 blue balls, and 6 green balls. I need to arrange them in a row such that no two blue balls are adjacent. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the total number of balls I have. Let's add them up: 5 red + 4 blue + 6 green = 15 balls in total. If there were no restrictions, the number of ways to arrange them would be 15 factorial divided by the factorial of the counts of each color, right? So, 15! / (5! * 4! * 6!). But there's that condition that no two blue balls can be next to each other.\n\nAlright, so I need to make sure that between any two blue balls, there's at least one other ball. Maybe I can think of arranging the non-blue balls first and then finding spots to place the blue balls.\n\nLet's see: the non-blue balls are the red and green ones. So, 5 red + 6 green = 11 balls. These can be arranged in 11! / (5! * 6!) ways.\n\nNow, once these 11 balls are arranged, there are spaces between them where I can place the blue balls. If I have 11 balls, there are 12 possible spaces to place the blue balls: one before the first ball, one after the last ball, and nine spaces between each pair of consecutive balls.\n\nI need to place 4 blue balls into these 12 spaces, making sure that no two blue balls are in the same space, because that would make them adjacent. Wait, actually, since the spaces are between the non-blue balls, placing two blue balls in the same space would still separate them by at least one non-blue ball, but the problem is that no two blue balls are adjacent, meaning there shouldn't be two blue balls next to each other in the row.\n\nSo, to ensure that no two blue balls are adjacent, I need to place them in different spaces, and also ensure that there's at least one non-blue ball between any two blue balls.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the concept of permutations with restrictions.\n\nLet me try another approach. First, arrange all the non-blue balls. There are 11 non-blue balls (5 red and 6 green), so the number of ways to arrange them is 11! / (5! * 6!).\n\nNow, I have to place the 4 blue balls into these arrangements such that no two blue balls are adjacent. To do this, I can think of the non-blue balls as creating \"gaps\" where I can place the blue balls.\n\nIf I have 11 non-blue balls in a row, there are 12 possible gaps where I can place the blue balls: one before the first ball, one after the last ball, and one between each pair of consecutive non-blue balls.\n\nI need to choose 4 out of these 12 gaps to place one blue ball each, ensuring that no two blue balls are in the same gap, which would automatically ensure that no two blue balls are adjacent.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 4 gaps out of 12 is C(12, 4). Then, in each chosen gap, I place one blue ball.\n\nSo, the total number of arrangements would be:\n\n(Number of ways to arrange non-blue balls) * (Number of ways to choose gaps for blue balls)\n\nWhich is:\n\n(11! / (5! * 6!)) * C(12, 4)\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nFirst, arranging the non-blue balls: yes, 11! / (5! * 6!).\n\nThen, choosing 4 gaps out of 12 for the blue balls: C(12, 4).\n\nBut, does this account for the fact that the blue balls are indistinguishable? Yes, because the blue balls are identical, so we don't need to arrange them in the gaps, just place one in each chosen gap.\n\nSo, the total number of arrangements should be:\n\n(11! / (5! * 6!)) * C(12, 4)\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, calculate 11! / (5! * 6!):\n\n11! = 39916800\n\n5! = 120\n\n6! = 720\n\nSo, 39916800 / (120 * 720) = 39916800 / 86400 = 462\n\nNext, C(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * 8!) = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 495\n\nSo, total arrangements = 462 * 495 = let's see, 462 * 500 = 231000, minus 462 * 5 = 231000 - 2310 = 228690\n\nWait, but I think I did the multiplication wrong. Let's calculate 462 * 495 properly.\n\n462 * 500 = 231000\n\nThen, 462 * 5 = 2310\n\nSo, 231000 - 2310 = 228690\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to arrange the balls with no two blue balls adjacent is 228690.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to think about the inclusion-exclusion principle, where I calculate the total number of arrangements without any restrictions and then subtract the arrangements where at least two blue balls are adjacent.\n\nTotal arrangements without restrictions: 15! / (5! * 4! * 6!)\n\nNow, arrangements where at least two blue balls are adjacent: this is more complicated, and probably more time-consuming than the first method.\n\nGiven that, I think the first method is more straightforward and less error-prone for this problem.\n\nSo, I'll stick with the answer of 228690 ways.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{228690} \\]"
