        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular field that's 80 meters long and 60 meters wide. The farmer wants to plant trees around the perimeter of the field, and each tree should be 10 meters apart from the next one. We need to figure out how many trees he'll need in total.\n\nFirst, I think we should calculate the perimeter of the rectangular field because that's the total distance where the trees will be planted. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (length + width) \\]\n\nPlugging in the given dimensions:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (80 + 60) = 2 \\times 140 = 280 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nSo, the perimeter is 280 meters.\n\nNow, trees are to be planted at intervals of 10 meters along this perimeter. To find out how many trees are needed, we might think of dividing the perimeter by the interval distance:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of trees} = \\frac{P}{\\text{interval}} = \\frac{280}{10} = 28 \\]\n\nAt first glance, it seems like 28 trees would be enough to cover the 280 meters at 10-meter intervals. However, we need to consider whether this calculation accounts for the tree at the starting point and whether the last tree coincides with the first tree to complete the loop.\n\nSince the trees are planted around the perimeter, which is a closed loop, the first and last trees will be at the same point if we don't adjust the calculation. In other words, the 28th tree would be planted back at the starting point, overlapping with the first tree.\n\nTo avoid double-counting the tree at the starting point, we might need to think differently. Perhaps we should consider that the number of trees is equal to the number of intervals between them. So, if the perimeter is 280 meters and each interval is 10 meters, then the number of intervals (and thus trees) would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of trees} = \\frac{280}{10} = 28 \\]\n\nBut wait, in a closed loop, the number of intervals is equal to the number of trees. So, 28 intervals mean 28 trees. However, in some planting scenarios, the starting point and ending point being the same might require adjusting the count.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Imagine unfolding the rectangle into a straight line to simplify the problem.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of trees along each side:\n\n- Length side: 80 meters. If trees are planted every 10 meters, starting at one end, the number of trees would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of trees along length} = \\frac{80}{10} + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \\]\n\nWe add 1 because we include both ends.\n\n- Width side: 60 meters. Similarly:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of trees along width} = \\frac{60}{10} + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7 \\]\n\nNow, for the rectangular field, there are two lengths and two widths. So, total trees would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total trees} = 2 \\times 9 + 2 \\times 7 = 18 + 14 = 32 \\]\n\nBut wait, this counts the corner trees twice because each corner is shared by both sides meeting there. So, we need to subtract the four corner trees that were double-counted:\n\n\\[ \\text{Adjusted total trees} = 32 - 4 = 28 \\]\n\nThis brings us back to the same number, 28, as in the first method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of the least common multiple (LCM) or consider the positions more carefully to ensure that trees at the corners are properly accounted for.\n\nLet's try to visualize the planting process. Starting at one corner, the farmer plants the first tree. Then, every 10 meters along the perimeter, another tree is planted.\n\nSo, starting at corner A (let's say the bottom left), the first tree is planted there. Then, 10 meters along to point B, another tree; then 10 meters to point C, and so on, until returning to corner A.\n\nThe question is, does the last tree planted before returning to the start coincide with the first tree, or is there a need for an additional tree?\n\nGiven that the perimeter is 280 meters and the interval is 10 meters, 280 divided by 10 is exactly 28. This suggests that the 28th tree would be planted right back at the starting point, coinciding with the first tree.\n\nTherefore, in a closed loop, the number of trees needed is equal to the number of intervals around the loop. Hence, 28 trees are required.\n\nBut let's cross-verify this with another example to be sure. Suppose the perimeter was smaller, say 10 meters, with intervals of 2 meters. The number of trees needed would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of trees} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\]\n\nIndeed, planting a tree every 2 meters around a 10-meter perimeter would require 5 trees, with the fifth tree coinciding with the first one.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, 28 trees placed at 10-meter intervals around a 280-meter perimeter should suffice, with the 28th tree being at the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the farmer will need 28 trees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]"
