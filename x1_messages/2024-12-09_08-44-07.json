        "content": "The 1993 movie you're referring to is \"Groundhog Day.\" In this film, Bill Murray plays a weatherman named Phil Connors who finds himself inexplicably reliving February 2nd, or Groundhog Day, over and over again. Each time, he wakes up to the same morning, forced to live the same day repeatedly until he learns to become a better person and break the time loop. The movie is a comedy but also explores deeper themes about personal growth and the meaning of life."
