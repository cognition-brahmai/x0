        "content": "The volume of a sphere is given by the formula \\(v = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\), where \\(v\\) is the volume and \\(r\\) is the radius. In this problem, the volume is given as \\(36\\pi\\) cubic centimeters. So, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = 36\\pi\n\\]\n\nTo find the radius, we need to solve for \\(r\\). First, we can eliminate \\(\\pi\\) from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{3} r^3 = 36\n\\]\n\nNext, we can multiply both sides by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) to isolate \\(r^3\\):\n\n\\[\nr^3 = 36 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 36 \\times 0.75 = 27\n\\]\n\nNow, to find \\(r\\), we take the cube root of both sides:\n\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt[3]{27} = 3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the radius of the sphere is 3 centimeters."
