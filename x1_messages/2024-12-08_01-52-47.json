        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that the factory produces 1200 units of product A in 8 hours. We need to find out how many units it will produce in 5 days, assuming it works at the same rate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rate at which the factory is producing the units. If it produces 1200 units in 8 hours, I can calculate the hourly production rate. To do that, I'll divide the total units by the total hours:\n\n\\[ \\text{Hourly production rate} = \\frac{1200 \\text{ units}}{8 \\text{ hours}} = 150 \\text{ units per hour} \\]\n\nOkay, so the factory produces 150 units every hour.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how many hours the factory works in 5 days. Assuming it works the same 8-hour shift every day, I can calculate the total hours in 5 days like this:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total hours in 5 days} = 5 \\text{ days} \\times 8 \\text{ hours per day} = 40 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, if the factory works for 40 hours at a rate of 150 units per hour, the total production would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total production} = 150 \\text{ units/hour} \\times 40 \\text{ hours} = 6000 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nWait a minute, but I should consider whether the factory really works 8 hours each day. The problem says \"working at the same rate,\" but it doesn't specify the daily working hours. Maybe the factory works different hours per day.\n\nLet me check the problem again: \"how many units will it produce in 5 days working at the same rate?\" The rate is 150 units per hour, as I calculated earlier. But I need to confirm the total number of hours worked in those 5 days.\n\nIf the factory works 8 hours each day for 5 days, then my previous calculation holds, and it would produce 6000 units.\n\nHowever, perhaps the factory works different hours. Maybe it's a 24/7 operation. But the problem mentions \"working at the same rate,\" which is 150 units per hour, and previously it was working 8 hours a day.\n\nI think the safest assumption is that the factory continues to work 8 hours each day for 5 days, unless stated otherwise.\n\nTherefore, total production would be 150 units/hour * 40 hours = 6000 units.\n\nBut let me think differently. Maybe the \"same rate\" refers to the daily production rate, not the hourly rate.\n\nIf that's the case, then first I need to find the daily production rate based on the initial information.\n\nGiven that in 8 hours, the factory produces 1200 units, then in one day (assuming 8-hour workday), it produces 1200 units.\n\nTherefore, in 5 days, it would produce:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total production} = 1200 \\text{ units/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 6000 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nAgain, I get 6000 units.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's another way to look at it. Maybe the 8 hours mentioned is not a daily shift, but perhaps the total hours in a day.\n\nFor example, if the factory works 8 hours in a single day to produce 1200 units, then in 5 days, working the same 8 hours each day, it would produce 1200 units per day times 5 days, which again is 6000 units.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory works more hours per day, but the problem doesn't specify that, so I should stick with the given information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"5 days\" implies a certain number of hours in total, but again, without specified daily hours, I'll assume it's 8 hours per day.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is 6000 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6000} \\]"
