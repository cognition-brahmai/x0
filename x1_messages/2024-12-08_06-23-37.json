The expression is:\n\n((6^2 / 3) - (9 * 2)) * 4\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the exponentiation, division, multiplication, and subtraction in the correct order, remembering the order of operations: parentheses first, then exponents, followed by multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nSo, starting inside the parentheses:\n\n1. Calculate 6^2:\n\n6^2 = 36\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n((36 / 3) - (9 * 2)) * 4\n\n2. Next, divide 36 by 3:\n\n36 / 3 = 12\n\nNow it's:\n\n(12 - (9 * 2)) * 4\n\n3. Calculate 9 multiplied by 2:\n\n9 * 2 = 18\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n(12 - 18) * 4\n\n4. Subtract 18 from 12:\n\n12 - 18 = -6\n\nNow it's:\n\n(-6) * 4\n\n5. Finally, multiply -6 by 4:\n\n-6 * 4 = -24\n\nSo, the final answer is -24.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-24} \\]\n"
