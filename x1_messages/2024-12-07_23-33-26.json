        "content": "The term \"muggle\" comes from the Harry Potter book series by J.K. Rowling. In this series, a muggle is a person who lacks magical abilities and was not born into the magical world. The term is used to describe ordinary, non-magical people. Harry Potter, the protagonist, is a half-blood wizard who attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he and his friends navigate magical challenges and adventures while also dealing with everyday teenage issues. The Harry Potter series is renowned for its richly detailed magical world, complex characters, and exploration of themes such as love, loss, friendship, and the struggle between good and evil."
