        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 250 units per day. It operates 6 days a week and takes 2 weeks off per year for maintenance. I need to find out how many units it produces in one year.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many weeks the factory operates in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, and the factory takes 2 weeks off for maintenance. So, the number of weeks it operates is:\n\n52 weeks - 2 weeks = 50 weeks\n\nNow, since it operates 6 days a week, the number of operating days in a year is:\n\n50 weeks * 6 days/week = 300 days\n\nNext, it produces 250 units per day. So, the total annual production should be:\n\n300 days * 250 units/day = 75,000 units\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the weekly production and then multiply by the number of weeks it operates.\n\nWeekly production: 6 days * 250 units/day = 1,500 units/week\n\nNumber of operating weeks: 52 weeks - 2 weeks = 50 weeks\n\nTotal annual production: 1,500 units/week * 50 weeks = 75,000 units\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the annual production without considering the maintenance weeks and then subtract the production lost during the maintenance weeks.\n\nFirst, calculate the annual production if it operated all 52 weeks:\n\n52 weeks * 6 days/week * 250 units/day = 52 * 6 * 250 = 78,000 units\n\nThen, calculate the production lost during the 2 weeks off:\n\n2 weeks * 6 days/week * 250 units/day = 2 * 6 * 250 = 3,000 units\n\nSubtract the lost production from the total possible production:\n\n78,000 units - 3,000 units = 75,000 units\n\nAgain, it confirms the same total of 75,000 units per year.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any holiday or other downtime besides the 2 weeks off for maintenance? The question doesn't mention any other downtime, so I assume those 2 weeks are the only time the factory is not operating.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the factory operates 6 days a week, which means it's closed one day a week. So, in the 50 weeks it's operating, it's not operating on those 50 days (1 day per week).\n\nBut wait, no. If it operates 6 days a week, then in 50 weeks, it operates 50 * 6 = 300 days, as I calculated earlier.\n\nI feel confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75000} \\]"
