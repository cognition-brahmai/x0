        "content": "Yes, that's a common belief, but it's actually a myth. The Coriolis effect does influence the rotation of large-scale weather systems and ocean currents, causing them to spin clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. However, for small-scale phenomena like water draining from a sink or toilet, the Coriolis effect is negligible.\n\nThe direction in which water drains is primarily determined by the shape of the basin or toilet bowl and the way the water is introduced into it. Any pre-existing motion or asymmetry in the container can cause the water to swirl in a particular direction, regardless of the hemisphere.\n\nSo, while the Coriolis effect is a real phenomenon, its impact on small bodies of water is too weak to be observed in everyday situations."
