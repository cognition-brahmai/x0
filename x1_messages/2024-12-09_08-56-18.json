        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here. In a town, 60% of the population are adults, and 40% are children. Among the adults, 70% are married, and among the children, 20% are orphans. The question is, what percentage of the total population is married?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what is being asked. I need to find the percentage of the entire population that is married. Now, married people are only among the adults, right? Because children aren't married. So, I think I need to focus on the adult population to find out how many are married.\n\nGiven that 60% of the population are adults, and among these adults, 70% are married. So, to find the percentage of the total population that is married, I can calculate 70% of the 60% adult population.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nPercentage of married adults = 70% of 60%\n\nTo calculate that, I can multiply 70% by 60%:\n\n70% * 60% = 0.7 * 0.6 = 0.42\n\nSo, that's 42%.\n\nWait a minute, is that the final answer? Is 42% of the total population married?\n\nLet me double-check. The problem says that among the adults, 70% are married. And adults make up 60% of the population. So, yes, 70% of 60% should give me the portion of the total population that is married.\n\nBut the problem also mentions that among the children, 20% are orphans. Does that information affect the percentage of married people in the total population?\n\nHmm, orphans are children without parents, but since children can't be married, I don't think the orphan status affects the married population. So, perhaps that's just additional information that isn't needed for this particular question.\n\nSo, to confirm, the percentage of the total population that is married is 42%.\n\nWait, but I should maybe consider if there are any other married people besides the adults. But the problem implies that only adults can be married, as children are, well, children.\n\nAlso, orphans are a subset of children, and since children can't be married, it doesn't change the number of married adults.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 42%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of actual numbers to verify.\n\nSuppose the total population is 1000 people.\n\nThen, adults = 60% of 1000 = 600 adults.\n\nChildren = 40% of 1000 = 400 children.\n\nAmong adults, 70% are married: 70% of 600 = 420 married adults.\n\nAmong children, 20% are orphans: 20% of 400 = 80 orphans.\n\nBut again, since children can't be married, the number of married people is only the 420 married adults.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the total population that is married is (420 / 1000) * 100% = 42%.\n\nSo, yes, that seems consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nI think the answer is 42%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{42\\%} \\]"
