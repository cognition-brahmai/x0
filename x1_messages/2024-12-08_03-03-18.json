Raju was not like other tigers; he had a heart full of kindness and a mind filled with curiosity. One sunny morning, Raju stumbled upon a lost fawn, trembling and alone. Instead of seeing dinner, Raju saw vulnerability. He decided to protect the fawn, teaching it to find food and avoid danger. Days turned into weeks, and the unlikely pair became inseparable. The other animals whispered about the tiger who befriended his prey, but Raju didn't care. For him, compassion knew no bounds. And so, in the heart of the jungle, a legend was born\u2014a tiger who chose love over instinct."
