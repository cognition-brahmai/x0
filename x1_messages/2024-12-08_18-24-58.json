This vast and formidable mountain chain stretches from the Grey Mountains in the north to the White Mountains in the south, playing a significant role in the geography and history of Middle-earth. The Misty Mountains are home to various creatures, including dwarves, orcs, and other mystical beings, and have been the site of many epic battles and adventures throughout Tolkien's legendarium."
