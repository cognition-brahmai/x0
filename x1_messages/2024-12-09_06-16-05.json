        "content": "That would be Edgar Allan Poe. He's famous for his stories like \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" and \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" which are indeed dark and macabre. But he also wrote \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" and \"The Mystery of Marie Rog\u00eat,\" which are considered pioneering works in the detective fiction genre. Poe created the character C. Auguste Dupin, who is often regarded as one of the first fictional detectives in literature. His stories introduced elements such as the eccentric detective, the bumbling constabulary, and the detailed reasoning that would become hallmarks of the detective story."
