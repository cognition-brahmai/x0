        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nThere's a class of 30 students: 12 girls and 18 boys. We're supposed to find the probability that exactly 3 out of 5 randomly selected students are girls. Okay, sounds like a hypergeometric distribution problem since we're sampling without replacement.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for hypergeometric probability. The hypergeometric distribution is used when you're dealing with sampling without replacement from a finite population. The formula is:\n\n\\[ P(X = k) = \\frac{\\binom{K}{k} \\binom{N - K}{n - k}}{\\binom{N}{n}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( N \\) is the total number of items in the population.\n\n- \\( K \\) is the number of successful items in the population.\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of items sampled.\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of successful items in the sample.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- \\( N = 30 \\) (total students)\n\n- \\( K = 12 \\) (girls)\n\n- \\( n = 5 \\) (students selected)\n\n- \\( k = 3 \\) (girls desired in the sample)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ P(X = 3) = \\frac{\\binom{12}{3} \\binom{30 - 12}{5 - 3}}{\\binom{30}{5}} \\]\n\nLet me calculate each binomial coefficient step by step.\n\nFirst, \\( \\binom{12}{3} \\):\n\n\\[ \\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12!}{3!(12 - 3)!} = \\frac{12!}{3! \\cdot 9!} \\]\n\nCalculating factorials:\n\n- \\( 12! = 479,001,600 \\)\n\n- \\( 3! = 6 \\)\n\n- \\( 9! = 362,880 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{479,001,600}{6 \\times 362,880} = \\frac{479,001,600}{2,177,280} = 220 \\]\n\nNext, \\( \\binom{18}{2} \\) (since \\( 30 - 12 = 18 \\) and \\( 5 - 3 = 2 \\)):\n\n\\[ \\binom{18}{2} = \\frac{18!}{2!(18 - 2)!} = \\frac{18!}{2! \\cdot 16!} \\]\n\nCalculating factorials:\n\n- \\( 18! = 6,402,373,705,728,000 \\)\n\n- \\( 2! = 2 \\)\n\n- \\( 16! = 20,922,789,888,000 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\binom{18}{2} = \\frac{6,402,373,705,728,000}{2 \\times 20,922,789,888,000} = \\frac{6,402,373,705,728,000}{41,845,579,776,000} = 153 \\]\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check those calculations again.\n\nActually, I think I made a mistake in calculating \\( \\binom{18}{2} \\). Let's recalculate:\n\n\\[ \\binom{18}{2} = \\frac{18 \\times 17}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{306}{2} = 153 \\]\n\nOkay, that's correct.\n\nNow, \\( \\binom{30}{5} \\):\n\n\\[ \\binom{30}{5} = \\frac{30!}{5!(30 - 5)!} = \\frac{30!}{5! \\cdot 25!} \\]\n\nCalculating factorials:\n\n- \\( 30! \\) is a big number, but we don't need to calculate the full factorial because many terms will cancel out.\n\nInstead, we can calculate it as:\n\n\\[ \\binom{30}{5} = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28 \\times 27 \\times 26}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} \\]\n\nCalculating numerator:\n\n\\[ 30 \\times 29 = 870 \\]\n\n\\[ 870 \\times 28 = 24,360 \\]\n\n\\[ 24,360 \\times 27 = 657,720 \\]\n\n\\[ 657,720 \\times 26 = 17,100,720 \\]\n\nCalculating denominator:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\]\n\n\\[ 20 \\times 3 = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ 60 \\times 2 = 120 \\]\n\n\\[ 120 \\times 1 = 120 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\binom{30}{5} = \\frac{17,100,720}{120} = 142,506 \\]\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\n\\[ P(X = 3) = \\frac{220 \\times 153}{142,506} \\]\n\nFirst, multiply 220 and 153:\n\n\\[ 220 \\times 153 = 33,660 \\]\n\nThen divide by 142,506:\n\n\\[ \\frac{33,660}{142,506} \\]\n\nLet's simplify this fraction. Dividing numerator and denominator by 6:\n\n\\[ \\frac{33,660 \\div 6}{142,506 \\div 6} = \\frac{5,610}{23,751} \\]\n\nWe can check if this can be simplified further. Let's see if 5,610 and 23,751 have any common factors.\n\nDividing both by 3:\n\n- 5,610 \u00f7 3 = 1,870\n\n- 23,751 \u00f7 3 = 7,917\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,870}{7,917} \\]\n\nLet's check if 1,870 and 7,917 have any common factors.\n\n1,870 is divisible by 10 (1,870 \u00f7 10 = 187), but 7,917 is not divisible by 10. Let's check for other factors.\n\n187 is 11 \u00d7 17, so 1,870 = 11 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 10.\n\nCheck if 7,917 is divisible by 11 or 17.\n\n7,917 \u00f7 11 = 720.636..., not an integer.\n\n7,917 \u00f7 17 = 465.705..., not an integer.\n\nSo, the fraction \\(\\frac{1,870}{7,917}\\) is in its simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, we can convert this to a decimal for a clearer understanding.\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,870}{7,917} \\approx 0.2362 \\]\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.2362, or 23.62%.\n\nBut to be more precise, let's double-check the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, we can use another approach to calculate the probability.\n\nThe probability of selecting exactly 3 girls out of 5 students can also be calculated using the formula for hypergeometric distribution.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as the number of ways to choose 3 girls out of 12 multiplied by the number of ways to choose 2 boys out of 18, divided by the total number of ways to choose 5 students out of 30.\n\nWhich is exactly what we did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate it step by step, considering the probability at each draw without replacement.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe probability of selecting a girl on the first draw is 12/30.\n\nThen, given that a girl was selected first, the probability of selecting another girl is 11/29.\n\nThen, the probability of selecting a third girl is 10/28.\n\nThen, the probability of selecting a boy is 18/27.\n\nAnd then, selecting another boy is 17/26.\n\nBut since the order in which we select the students doesn't matter, we need to consider all possible sequences that result in exactly 3 girls and 2 boys.\n\nThe number of such sequences is the number of ways to arrange 3 girls and 2 boys in a sequence, which is \\(\\binom{5}{3} = 10\\).\n\nSo, the probability would be:\n\n\\[ P = \\binom{5}{3} \\times \\left( \\frac{12}{30} \\times \\frac{11}{29} \\times \\frac{10}{28} \\times \\frac{18}{27} \\times \\frac{17}{26} \\right) \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the probability for one specific sequence:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12}{30} \\times \\frac{11}{29} \\times \\frac{10}{28} \\times \\frac{18}{27} \\times \\frac{17}{26} \\]\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12}{30} = 0.4 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.4 \\times \\frac{11}{29} = 0.4 \\times 0.3793 \\approx 0.1517 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.1517 \\times \\frac{10}{28} = 0.1517 \\times 0.3571 \\approx 0.0541 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.0541 \\times \\frac{18}{27} = 0.0541 \\times 0.6667 \\approx 0.0361 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.0361 \\times \\frac{17}{26} = 0.0361 \\times 0.6538 \\approx 0.0236 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by \\(\\binom{5}{3} = 10\\):\n\n\\[ P \\approx 10 \\times 0.0236 = 0.236 \\]\n\nWhich matches our previous calculation.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.236, or 23.6%.\n\nAlternatively, to get the exact fraction, we can calculate it without decimal approximations.\n\nStarting over:\n\n\\[ P = \\binom{5}{3} \\times \\left( \\frac{12}{30} \\times \\frac{11}{29} \\times \\frac{10}{28} \\times \\frac{18}{27} \\times \\frac{17}{26} \\right) \\]\n\nFirst, \\(\\binom{5}{3} = 10\\).\n\nNow, the product inside:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12}{30} \\times \\frac{11}{29} \\times \\frac{10}{28} \\times \\frac{18}{27} \\times \\frac{17}{26} \\]\n\nLet's simplify each fraction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12}{30} = \\frac{2}{5} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{11}{29} \\] (already simplest)\n\n\\[ \\frac{10}{28} = \\frac{5}{14} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{18}{27} = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{17}{26} \\] (already simplest)\n\nSo, the product becomes:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{11}{29} \\times \\frac{5}{14} \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{17}{26} \\]\n\nNow, multiply numerator and denominator separately:\n\nNumerator:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 11 \\times 5 \\times 2 \\times 17 = 2 \\times 11 = 22 \\]\n\n\\[ 22 \\times 5 = 110 \\]\n\n\\[ 110 \\times 2 = 220 \\]\n\n\\[ 220 \\times 17 = 3,740 \\]\n\nDenominator:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 29 \\times 14 \\times 3 \\times 26 \\]\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 29 = 145 \\]\n\n\\[ 145 \\times 14 = 2,030 \\]\n\n\\[ 2,030 \\times 3 = 6,090 \\]\n\n\\[ 6,090 \\times 26 = 158,340 \\]\n\nSo, the product is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3,740}{158,340} \\]\n\nNow, multiply by 10:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times \\frac{3,740}{158,340} = \\frac{37,400}{158,340} \\]\n\nSimplify this fraction.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 20:\n\n\\[ \\frac{37,400 \\div 20}{158,340 \\div 20} = \\frac{1,870}{7,917} \\]\n\nWhich matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, the exact probability is \\(\\frac{1,870}{7,917}\\), which is approximately 0.2362.\n\nTherefore, the probability that exactly 3 out of 5 selected students are girls is approximately 23.62%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{1870}{7917} \\approx 0.2362} \\]"
