        "content": "I'm here to help! So, let's see. Marie Curie was a really important figure in science. She was born in Poland in 1867, not Russia in 1897, and she was a physicist and chemist, not an astronomer. She's famous for her work on radioactivity, which is different from cosmic radiation.\n\nMarie Curie was actually the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields: Physics and Chemistry. She won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, which she shared with her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, for their work on radioactivity. Then, she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911 for her discovery of the elements radium and polonium.\n\nSo, to sum it up, Marie Curie was a physicist and chemist who specialized in radioactivity. She won two Nobel Prizes, one in Physics and one in Chemistry, for her groundbreaking work in those fields.\n\nOh, and just to clarify, the Pulitzer Prize is an American prize for achievements in journalism, literature, and musical composition, so that's different from the Nobel Prize, which is awarded for physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, peace, and economic sciences.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
