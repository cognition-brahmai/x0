        "content": "To prove that the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 2 is continuous at x = 1, we need to show that the limit of f(x) as x approaches 1 is equal to f(1). In other words, we need to verify that:\n\nlim (x\u21921) f(x) = f(1)\n\nFirst, let's find f(1):\n\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 3(1) + 2 = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the limit of f(x) as x approaches 1. Since f(x) is a polynomial function, and polynomial functions are continuous everywhere, the limit of f(x) as x approaches any value is simply the value of the function at that point. Therefore:\n\nlim (x\u21921) f(x) = f(1) = 0\n\nThus, since the limit exists and is equal to the value of the function at x = 1, we can conclude that f(x) is continuous at x = 1.\n\nHowever, if you'd like to see a more rigorous epsilon-delta proof, I can provide that as well. Let's proceed with that.\n\nTo prove continuity at x = 1 using the epsilon-delta definition, we need to show that for every \u03b5 > 0, there exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that if |x - 1| < \u03b4, then |f(x) - f(1)| < \u03b5.\n\nWe already know that f(1) = 0, so this simplifies to:\n\n|f(x) - 0| < \u03b5 \u21d2 |f(x)| < \u03b5 whenever |x - 1| < \u03b4\n\nSo, we need to find a \u03b4 > 0 such that:\n\n|x - 1| < \u03b4 \u21d2 |x^3 - 3x + 2| < \u03b5\n\nLet's work on the expression |x^3 - 3x + 2|.\n\nFirst, factor the polynomial:\n\nx^3 - 3x + 2 = (x - 1)^2 (x + 2)\n\nProof of factorization:\n\nLet's verify this factorization by expanding (x - 1)^2 (x + 2):\n\n(x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1\n\nNow, multiply by (x + 2):\n\n(x^2 - 2x + 1)(x + 2) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 2x^2 - 4x + x + 2 = x^3 - 3x + 2\n\nSo, the factorization is correct.\n\nTherefore:\n\n|x^3 - 3x + 2| = |(x - 1)^2 (x + 2)| = |x - 1|^2 |x + 2|\n\nNow, we need to make |x - 1|^2 |x + 2| < \u03b5 whenever |x - 1| < \u03b4.\n\nLet's assume that \u03b4 \u2264 1. This is a common approach in epsilon-delta proofs to restrict the interval around x = 1 to make the expression easier to bound.\n\nIf |x - 1| < 1, then:\n\n0 < x < 2\n\nTherefore:\n\n2 < x + 2 < 4 \u21d2 |x + 2| < 4\n\nNow, since |x - 1| < \u03b4 and \u03b4 \u2264 1, we have:\n\n|x - 1|^2 |x + 2| < \u03b4^2 * 4\n\nWe want this to be less than \u03b5:\n\n\u03b4^2 * 4 < \u03b5 \u21d2 \u03b4^2 < \u03b5/4 \u21d2 \u03b4 < sqrt(\u03b5/4) = \u03b4 < \u03b5/2\n\nBut we also have the condition that \u03b4 \u2264 1.\n\nTherefore, to satisfy both conditions, we can choose:\n\n\u03b4 = min(1, \u03b5/2)\n\nNow, let's verify that this choice of \u03b4 works.\n\nAssume |x - 1| < \u03b4, where \u03b4 = min(1, \u03b5/2).\n\nThen:\n\n|x - 1| < 1 \u21d2 |x + 2| < 4 (as before)\n\nAnd:\n\n|x - 1| < \u03b5/2\n\nTherefore:\n\n|x^3 - 3x + 2| = |x - 1|^2 |x + 2| < (\u03b5/2)^2 * 4 = (\u03b5^2 / 4) * 4 = \u03b5^2\n\nWait, that's not quite right. Let's correct that.\n\nActually:\n\n|x - 1|^2 < (\u03b5/2)^2 = \u03b5^2 / 4\n\nBut then:\n\n|x - 1|^2 |x + 2| < (\u03b5^2 / 4) * 4 = \u03b5^2\n\nBut we want this to be less than \u03b5.\n\nThis suggests that my choice of \u03b4 might not be tight enough. Let's try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of setting \u03b4 \u2264 1 and then \u03b4 < \u03b5/2, I should directly relate \u03b4 to \u03b5 in a way that |x - 1|^2 |x + 2| < \u03b5.\n\nGiven that |x + 2| < 4 when |x - 1| < 1, then:\n\n|x - 1|^2 * 4 < \u03b5 \u21d2 |x - 1|^2 < \u03b5/4 \u21d2 |x - 1| < sqrt(\u03b5/4) = \u03b4\n\nSo, \u03b4 should be less than sqrt(\u03b5/4).\n\nTherefore, \u03b4 = sqrt(\u03b5/4) = (\u221a\u03b5)/2\n\nLet's choose \u03b4 = min(1, (\u221a\u03b5)/2)\n\nNow, verify:\n\nIf |x - 1| < \u03b4, then:\n\n|x - 1| < 1 \u21d2 |x + 2| < 4\n\nAnd:\n\n|x - 1| < (\u221a\u03b5)/2\n\nTherefore:\n\n|x - 1|^2 < (\u03b5)/4\n\nThus:\n\n|x - 1|^2 |x + 2| < (\u03b5/4) * 4 = \u03b5\n\nSo, |f(x) - f(1)| < \u03b5 whenever |x - 1| < \u03b4, where \u03b4 = min(1, (\u221a\u03b5)/2)\n\nTherefore, by the epsilon-delta definition, f(x) is continuous at x = 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{f(x) \\text{ is continuous at } x = 1} \\]"
