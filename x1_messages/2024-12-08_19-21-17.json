        "content": "So you've got a water tank that can hold 500 gallons, and it's being filled at a rate of 25 gallons per minute. You want to know how long it'll take to fill the tank completely. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a tank with a total capacity of 500 gallons, and it's being filled at a constant rate of 25 gallons every minute. I need to find out the time it takes to go from empty to full.\n\nOkay, so this seems like a straightforward division problem. If I have a total amount that needs to be filled, and a rate at which it's being filled, then the time required would be the total amount divided by the rate.\n\nSo, time = total capacity / filling rate\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\ntime = 500 gallons / 25 gallons per minute\n\nLet me do the math here. 500 divided by 25 is 20. So, time = 20 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, is that all there is to it? It seems too simple. Maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect the filling time, like the tank having an irregular shape or if the filling rate changes over time. But according to the problem, the filling rate is constant at 25 gallons per minute, and the tank's capacity is 500 gallons.\n\nSo, no need to overcomplicate things. The answer should be 20 minutes.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about it another way. If the tank is being filled at 25 gallons per minute, then in one minute, it gains 25 gallons. So, to reach 500 gallons, it would take 500 divided by 25 minutes, which again is 20 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of proportions. If 25 gallons take 1 minute, then 50 gallons would take 2 minutes, 75 gallons would take 3 minutes, and so on. So, for 500 gallons, it would be 500 / 25 = 20 minutes.\n\nI think no matter how I look at it, the answer remains the same. It's going to take 20 minutes to fill the tank completely.\n\nUnless there's something else I'm missing, like maybe the tank isn't empty to start with, or maybe there's a leakage, but the problem doesn't mention any such things. It seems straightforward.\n\nSo, the final answer is 20 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
