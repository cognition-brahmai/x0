        "content": "Let's tackle this family relationship problem step by step. So, we have a family consisting of a mother, a father, three sons, and each son has one sister. The question is, how many people are in this family?\n\nFirst, let's list out the members we know for sure:\n\n1. Mother\n\n2. Father\n\n3. Three sons\n\nSo, that's 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 people.\n\nNow, the tricky part is the statement \"each son has one sister.\" At first glance, it might seem like there are three sisters since there are three sons, each having one sister. But hold on, that would imply multiple sisters, which might not make sense because siblings share all their siblings.\n\nWait, actually, in most families, siblings share their siblings. So, if each son has one sister, that likely means there is only one sister shared among the three sons.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If each son has one sister, that sister is shared among all the sons, meaning there's only one sister in the family.\n\nSo, in addition to the mother, father, and three sons, there is one daughter (sister to the sons).\n\nTherefore, total family members: mother, father, three sons, and one daughter = 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 6 people.\n\nBut, let's double-check this logic. If there is only one daughter, and she is the sister to each of the three sons, that makes sense. Each son has exactly one sister, who is the same sister for all of them.\n\nAlternatively, if there were three daughters, each son could have three sisters, but that's not what the problem states. The problem says each son has one sister, implying only one sister per son.\n\nTherefore, the family consists of:\n\n- 1 mother\n\n- 1 father\n\n- 3 sons\n\n- 1 daughter\n\nTotal: 6 people.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says \"each son has one sister.\" Is it possible that the sister is only to some of the sons but not all? Hmm.\n\nWell, in most standard family structures, siblings share all their siblings. So, if the three sons are full siblings, they should all share the same siblings.\n\nTherefore, if one son has a sister, all three sons have the same sister(s).\n\nGiven that each son has one sister, it means there is only one sister in the family.\n\nHence, the family has six members.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are multiple sisters, but each son only has one sister, meaning each son has only one sister, but not necessarily the same one.\n\nBut that would be an unusual family structure, perhaps with half-siblings from different parents.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't provide any information about multiple marriages or different parents, so it's safe to assume that all children share the same parents.\n\nTherefore, all children are full siblings, sharing the same siblings.\n\nThus, if one son has one sister, all three sons have one sister.\n\nTherefore, there is only one daughter in the family.\n\nHence, the total number of family members is six.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider another angle.\n\nLet me consider the degrees of kinship.\n\nThe mother and father are parents to the three sons and one daughter.\n\nEach son has two parents (mother and father) and three siblings: two brothers and one sister.\n\nWait, wait, if there are three sons and one daughter, then each son has two brothers and one sister.\n\nSimilarly, the daughter has three brothers.\n\nBut the problem only specifies that each son has one sister, which is consistent with this setup.\n\nTherefore, the family consists of:\n\n- 1 mother\n\n- 1 father\n\n- 3 sons\n\n- 1 daughter\n\nTotal: 6 members.\n\nAlternatively, if there were more daughters, each son would have more than one sister, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the family must have exactly one daughter.\n\nHence, the answer is six people in the family.\n\nBut the problem might be trying to trick us into thinking that each son has a different sister, leading to multiple sisters, but that's not the case based on standard family structures.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that there are six people in the family.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
