        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces 500 cars per day. It operates 6 days a week and takes 2 weeks off for holidays each year. We need to find out how many cars it produces in a year.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many days a year the factory is operating. Since it operates 6 days a week, I'll start by calculating the total number of weeks in a year and then adjust for the holiday weeks.\n\nWe know there are 52 weeks in a year. If the factory takes 2 weeks off for holidays, then the number of weeks it operates is:\n\n52 weeks - 2 weeks = 50 weeks\n\nNow, since it operates 6 days a week, the total number of operating days in a year is:\n\n50 weeks * 6 days/week = 300 days\n\nSo, the factory operates for 300 days each year.\n\nNext, since it produces 500 cars per day, the total annual production would be:\n\n300 days * 500 cars/day = 150,000 cars\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the weekly production and then multiply by the number of weeks it operates.\n\nWeekly production:\n\n6 days/week * 500 cars/day = 3,000 cars/week\n\nThen, operating for 50 weeks:\n\n50 weeks * 3,000 cars/week = 150,000 cars\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there might be leap years or extra days that aren't accounted for. A year has 365 days, or 366 in a leap year. Since the factory operates 6 days a week and takes 2 weeks off, it's based on weeks, not days. So, whether it's a leap year or not doesn't affect the calculation based on weeks.\n\nHowever, just for curiosity, let's see how many days are actually covered by 50 weeks of 6 days each:\n\n50 weeks * 6 days/week = 300 days\n\nA regular year has 365 days, so 365 - 300 = 65 days off. But the problem states it takes 2 weeks off, which is 14 days, so there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconcile this. If the factory operates 6 days a week for 50 weeks, that's 300 days, but in a year with 365 days, 365 - 300 = 65 days off. But the problem mentions only 2 weeks off, which is 14 days. This suggests that my initial assumption might be incorrect.\n\nMaybe the factory operates 6 days a week for 52 weeks but takes 2 weeks off, meaning it operates for 50 weeks. But let's check that again.\n\nWait, 52 weeks in a year, minus 2 weeks off, equals 50 weeks operating. Each operating week has 6 days, so 50 weeks * 6 days/week = 300 days.\n\nBut if a year has 365 days, 50 weeks of 6 days would be 300 days, and 2 weeks off are 14 days, totaling 314 days. But 314 days is more than 365, which doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm, there's something wrong with this logic. Perhaps the discrepancy comes from how weeks are aligned with days in a year.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's calculate the total number of days the factory operates in a year.\n\nThere are 52 weeks in a year. If the factory takes 2 weeks off, that's 2 * 7 = 14 days off.\n\nHowever, the factory operates only 6 days a week, meaning that even when it's operating, it has one day off each week.\n\nSo, in 52 weeks, it has 52 days off (one each week).\n\nBut it takes an additional 2 weeks off, which is 14 days off.\n\nSo, total days off are 52 days (weekly offs) + 14 days (holiday offs) = 66 days off.\n\nTotal days in a year are 365, so operating days are 365 - 66 = 299 days.\n\nWait, but 52 weeks * 6 days/week = 312 days operating, plus 13 days off (since 52 weeks * 1 day off/week = 52 days off, plus 14 holiday days off, totaling 66 days off). But 365 - 66 = 299 days, which doesn't match the 312 I just calculated.\n\nThere's clearly a mistake in my reasoning here.\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps it's simpler to consider that the factory operates 6 days a week for 50 weeks (since it takes 2 weeks off).\n\nSo, 50 weeks * 6 days/week = 300 days.\n\nThen, the annual production is 300 days * 500 cars/day = 150,000 cars.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that in a year, there are 52 weeks, and the factory operates for 6 days a week for 50 weeks, that's still 300 days.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried to account for the total days in the year, there was a discrepancy. Maybe it's because of the extra days beyond complete weeks.\n\nPerhaps it's best to stick with the initial calculation: 50 weeks * 6 days/week = 300 days * 500 cars/day = 150,000 cars.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider a year has 365 days, and the factory operates 6/7 of the days (since it operates 6 days a week), but takes 2 weeks off, which is 14 days.\n\nSo, total operating days = (365 - 14) * (6/7) = 351 * (6/7) \u2248 351 * 0.857 \u2248 300 days.\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 150,000 cars in a year.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there a possibility that the factory operates on some days during the holiday weeks? The problem says it takes 2 weeks off, so presumably, those weeks are completely off.\n\nAlso, does the factory operate on holidays? The problem doesn't specify, but it mentions \"2 weeks off for holidays,\" so likely, those weeks include holidays, and the factory is closed entirely during those weeks.\n\nGiven that, my initial calculation seems sound.\n\nSo, the final answer is 150,000 cars per year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150000} \\]"
