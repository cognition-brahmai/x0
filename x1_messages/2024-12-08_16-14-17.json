Martin Luther King Jr. was not a business tycoon or philanthropist in the way you've described. He was actually a civil rights leader and Baptist minister who played a key role in the American civil rights movement. He was assassinated in 1968, not in 1988, and his most famous speech is indeed titled \"I Have a Dream,\" which he delivered during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963.\n\nThe information you provided seems to be inaccurate. The source you mentioned is from History.com, which is a reputable site for historical information. It's possible there might have been a misunderstanding or misquotation from the source. I recommend double-checking the information from the provided URL to get accurate details about Martin Luther King Jr.'s life and legacy.\n\nENDASSISTANCE"
