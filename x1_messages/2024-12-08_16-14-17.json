        "content": "So the company currently produces 5,000 units of a product each month, and each unit costs $20 to make. They're looking to reduce the cost per unit by 15%. I need to find out how much the total production cost would be reduced by if they achieve this.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what the current total production cost is. Since they produce 5,000 units each month at $20 per unit, I can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of units by the cost per unit.\n\nSo, total current cost = 5,000 units * $20/unit = $100,000 per month.\n\nNow, they want to decrease the cost per unit by 15%. To find out what the new cost per unit would be, I need to calculate 15% of $20 and then subtract that from the original $20 cost.\n\n15% of $20 is calculated as 0.15 * $20 = $3.\n\nSo, the reduction per unit is $3.\n\nTherefore, the new cost per unit would be $20 - $3 = $17 per unit.\n\nNow, to find out the new total production cost, I'll multiply the new cost per unit by the number of units produced.\n\nNew total cost = 5,000 units * $17/unit = $85,000 per month.\n\nTo find out how much the production cost is reduced, I'll subtract the new total cost from the original total cost.\n\nReduction in cost = original total cost - new total cost = $100,000 - $85,000 = $15,000 per month.\n\nSo, if the company is able to decrease the cost per unit by 15%, their monthly production cost would be reduced by $15,000.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe there's a simpler way to calculate the total reduction without finding the new cost per unit and then the new total cost.\n\nLet's see: if each unit's cost is reduced by 15%, and they produce 5,000 units, then the total reduction should be 5,000 times 15% of $20.\n\nSo, total reduction = 5,000 * (0.15 * $20) = 5,000 * $3 = $15,000.\n\nThat matches what I calculated earlier. So, either way, the reduction is $15,000 per month.\n\nIs there anything else I should consider? Maybe whether the reduction is permanent or just for one month. But since the question says they \"produce 5000 units of a product per month,\" I think it's safe to assume that the reduction would be ongoing, month by month, as long as the cost per unit remains reduced.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that there are no other costs involved, like fixed costs or variable costs beyond the per unit production cost. But the question only mentions the cost per unit to produce, so I think it's okay to focus solely on that.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's a way to express this reduction as a percentage of the original cost.\n\nSo, the original cost is $100,000, and the reduction is $15,000. To find the percentage reduction:\n\nPercentage reduction = (reduction / original cost) * 100 = ($15,000 / $100,000) * 100 = 15%.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, reducing the cost per unit by 15% results in a 15% reduction in the total production cost, which makes sense because the number of units produced remains the same.\n\nThis seems straightforward enough. I think $15,000 per month is the correct answer to how much the production cost would be reduced.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15000} \\]"
