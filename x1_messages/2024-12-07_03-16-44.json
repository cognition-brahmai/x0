        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to write a C++ program that reads integers from a text file, sorts them using merge sort, and writes the sorted list to a new file. Also, I need to handle errors like missing files or invalid content. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to read from a text file. In C++, I can use the `fstream` library for file handling. I'll need to open the file in read mode, check if it's opened successfully, and then read the integers one by one.\n\nNext, I have to sort the integers using merge sort. Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges them. I need to implement this recursively.\n\nAfter sorting, I have to write the sorted integers to a new text file. Again, using `fstream`, but this time opening a file in write mode and writing the sorted numbers.\n\nError handling is crucial. I need to check if the input file exists and is readable. Also, while reading, I should handle cases where the file contains non-integer values.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Include necessary headers: `iostream`, `fstream`, `vector`, and maybe `sstream` for parsing.\n\n2. Define a function for merge sort that takes a vector of integers and sorts it.\n\n3. In the main function, open the input file.\n\n4. Read the file and store integers in a vector. Handle any parsing errors.\n\n5. Call the merge sort function on the vector.\n\n6. Open an output file and write the sorted integers to it.\n\n7. Close both files and handle any file operation errors.\n\nLet's start with the merge sort function. Merge sort works by dividing the array into two halves until each subarray contains a single element, and then merging those subarrays in a sorted manner.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the merge sort function:\n\n```cpp\nvoid merge(std::vector<int>& arr, int left, int mid, int right) {\n    // Merge logic\n}\n\nvoid mergeSort(std::vector<int>& arr, int left, int right) {\n    if (left < right) {\n        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\n        mergeSort(arr, left, mid);\n        mergeSort(arr, mid + 1, right);\n        merge(arr, left, mid, right);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI need to implement the `merge` function, which will merge two sorted subarrays into one sorted subarray.\n\nNow, for file handling:\n\n- Open the input file using `std::ifstream`.\n\n- Check if the file is open using `if (inputFile.is_open())`.\n\n- Read the file line by line or directly into integers.\n\n- Handle cases where the file doesn't exist or can't be opened.\n\nFor reading integers from the file, I can read each line and then parse it as an integer. If parsing fails, I should skip that line or handle the error appropriately.\n\nSimilarly, for writing to the output file, I'll use `std::ofstream` and write each integer to a new line.\n\nI should also consider that the input file might be large, so using a vector to store all integers might not be memory efficient. But for simplicity, I'll assume the file isn't too large.\n\nLet me think about error handling in more detail:\n\n- If the input file doesn't exist, output an error message.\n\n- If the file contains non-integer values, skip those lines or handle them gracefully without crashing.\n\n- If there's an error writing to the output file, inform the user.\n\nI can use try-catch blocks for handling exceptions, but in C++, file operations don't throw exceptions by default, so I need to check the status flags of the file streams.\n\nAlso, I should choose appropriate names for the input and output files. Maybe ask the user for the input file name and generate an output file name based on that, or have default file names.\n\nFor now, let's assume the input file is named \"input.txt\" and the output file is \"sorted.txt\".\n\nLet me start writing some code.\n\nFirst, include the necessary headers:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <sstream>\n```\n\nDefine the merge function:\n\n```cpp\nvoid merge(std::vector<int>& arr, int left, int mid, int right) {\n    int n1 = mid - left + 1;\n    int n2 = right - mid;\n\n    std::vector<int> L(n1), R(n2);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++)\n        L[i] = arr[left + i];\n    for (int j = 0; j < n2; j++)\n        R[j] = arr[mid + 1 + j];\n\n    int i = 0, j = 0, k = left;\n\n    while (i < n1 && j < n2) {\n        if (L[i] <= R[j]) {\n            arr[k] = L[i];\n            i++;\n        } else {\n            arr[k] = R[j];\n            j++;\n        }\n        k++;\n    }\n\n    while (i < n1) {\n        arr[k] = L[i];\n        i++;\n        k++;\n    }\n\n    while (j < n2) {\n        arr[k] = R[j];\n        j++;\n        k++;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDefine the mergeSort function:\n\n```cpp\nvoid mergeSort(std::vector<int>& arr, int left, int right) {\n    if (left < right) {\n        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\n        mergeSort(arr, left, mid);\n        mergeSort(arr, mid + 1, right);\n        merge(arr, left, mid, right);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the main function, handle file operations:\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    std::ifstream inputFile(\"input.txt\");\n    if (!inputFile.is_open()) {\n        std::cerr << \"Error opening input file.\" << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    std::vector<int> numbers;\n    std::string line;\n    while (std::getline(inputFile, line)) {\n        std::stringstream ss(line);\n        int num;\n        if (ss >> num) {\n            numbers.push_back(num);\n        } else {\n            std::cerr << \"Warning: Invalid integer in file.\" << std::endl;\n        }\n    }\n    inputFile.close();\n\n    mergeSort(numbers, 0, numbers.size() - 1);\n\n    std::ofstream outputFile(\"sorted.txt\");\n    if (!outputFile.is_open()) {\n        std::cerr << \"Error opening output file.\" << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    for (int num : numbers) {\n        outputFile << num << std::endl;\n    }\n    outputFile.close();\n\n    std::cout << \"Sorting completed. Check 'sorted.txt'.\" << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis should work for basic cases. However, I need to make sure that the merge sort function handles empty vectors and vectors with a single element correctly, which it should.\n\nAlso, I should consider that the input file might have multiple integers per line or non-integer characters mixed with integers. To handle that, I might need to modify the reading part to parse each line more carefully.\n\nFor example, I can read each word from the file and try to parse it as an integer.\n\nLet me adjust the reading part:\n\n```cpp\nwhile (std::getline(inputFile, line)) {\n    std::stringstream ss(line);\n    std::string word;\n    while (ss >> word) {\n        try {\n            int num = std::stoi(word);\n            numbers.push_back(num);\n        } catch (const std::invalid_argument&) {\n            std::cerr << \"Warning: Invalid integer '\" << word << \"' in file.\" << std::endl;\n        } catch (const std::out_of_range&) {\n            std::cerr << \"Warning: Integer out of range '\" << word << \"' in file.\" << std::endl;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis way, I can handle files with multiple integers per line and skip any non-integer values.\n\nAlso, I should consider that the file might be very large, and storing all integers in memory might not be feasible. In such cases, I could implement an external sort, but that's more complex and beyond the scope of this task.\n\nFor now, assuming the file is manageable in size, this approach should work.\n\nLet me also think about the output file. Maybe I should allow the user to specify the input and output file names.\n\nI can modify the program to accept command-line arguments for input and output files.\n\nHere's how I can do that:\n\n```cpp\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\n    if (argc < 3) {\n        std::cerr << \"Usage: \" << argv[0] << \" input_file output_file\" << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    std::string inputFileName = argv[1];\n    std::string outputFileName = argv[2];\n\n    std::ifstream inputFile(inputFileName);\n    if (!inputFile.is_open()) {\n        std::cerr << \"Error opening input file: \" << inputFileName << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Rest of the code remains the same, using inputFileName and outputFileName\n}\n```\n\nThis makes the program more flexible.\n\nAlso, I should consider adding some checks to ensure that the output file can be created and written to.\n\nAdditionally, I can add some messages to inform the user about the progress, like how many numbers were read and sorted.\n\nLet me enhance the main function:\n\n```cpp\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\n    if (argc < 3) {\n        std::cerr << \"Usage: \" << argv[0] << \" input_file output_file\" << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    std::string inputFileName = argv[1];\n    std::string outputFileName = argv[2];\n\n    std::ifstream inputFile(inputFileName);\n    if (!inputFile.is_open()) {\n        std::cerr << \"Error opening input file: \" << inputFileName << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    std::vector<int> numbers;\n    std::string line;\n    while (std::getline(inputFile, line)) {\n        std::stringstream ss(line);\n        std::string word;\n        while (ss >> word) {\n            try {\n                int num = std::stoi(word);\n                numbers.push_back(num);\n            } catch (const std::invalid_argument&) {\n                std::cerr << \"Warning: Invalid integer '\" << word << \"' in file.\" << std::endl;\n            } catch (const std::out_of_range&) {\n                std::cerr << \"Warning: Integer out of range '\" << word << \"' in file.\" << std::endl;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    inputFile.close();\n\n    std::cout << \"Read \" << numbers.size() << \" integers from file.\" << std::endl;\n\n    mergeSort(numbers, 0, numbers.size() - 1);\n\n    std::ofstream outputFile(outputFileName);\n    if (!outputFile.is_open()) {\n        std::cerr << \"Error opening output file: \" << outputFileName << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    for (int num : numbers) {\n        outputFile << num << std::endl;\n    }\n    outputFile.close();\n\n    std::cout << \"Sorted numbers written to \" << outputFileName << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis should cover most of the requirements.\n\nI should also think about the performance of merge sort. Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), which is efficient for sorting. However, for very large files, memory usage could be an issue since we're loading all numbers into a vector.\n\nBut again, for the scope of this task, assuming the file is manageable in size, this should be fine.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other error scenarios I should handle.\n\n- What if the output file cannot be created? (e.g., permission issues)\n\n- What if the input file is empty?\n\n- What if the input file contains only invalid entries?\n\nFor an empty input file, the program should just create an empty output file or a file with no content, which is fine.\n\nIf the input file contains only invalid entries, the program will write an empty output file, which is also acceptable, provided we inform the user that no valid integers were found.\n\nI can add a check after reading the file to see if any valid integers were read.\n\nLet me adjust the code accordingly:\n\n```cpp\nif (numbers.empty()) {\n    std::cerr << \"No valid integers found in the input file.\" << std::endl;\n    return 1;\n}\n```\n\nPlace this check after reading the file and before sorting.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the program doesn't crash if the user provides incorrect command-line arguments.\n\nI've already handled the case where fewer than three arguments are provided, but I should ensure that the program exits gracefully in such cases.\n\nAdditionally, I can add some comments to the code for better readability.\n\nLet me also consider adding a header or a message at the beginning to inform the user how to use the program.\n\nWait, since it's a command-line program, the usage message is already provided when incorrect arguments are given.\n\nI think this covers most of the requirements.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- The program reads integers from a specified input file.\n\n- It sorts the integers using merge sort.\n\n- It writes the sorted integers to a specified output file.\n\n- It handles errors such as missing input files, invalid integers in the file, and issues with creating the output file.\n\n- It provides informative messages to the user.\n\nThis should be sufficient for the task at hand.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a C++ program that reads integers from a text file, sorts them using the merge sort algorithm, and writes the sorted integers to a new text file. The program must also handle errors gracefully, such as missing input files or invalid content.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Read Input File**: Use `std::ifstream` to read integers from the specified input file. Each integer is stored in a `std::vector<int>`.\n2. **Merge Sort Algorithm**: Implement the merge sort algorithm to sort the vector of integers in ascending order.\n3. **Write Output File**: Use `std::ofstream` to write the sorted integers to a specified output file.\n4. **Error Handling**: Handle exceptions such as missing input files, invalid integers in the file, and issues with creating the output file.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <sstream>\n#include <string>\n\nvoid merge(std::vector<int>& arr, int left, int mid, int right) {\n    int n1 = mid - left + 1;\n    int n2 = right - mid;\n\n    std::vector<int> L(n1), R(n2);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++)\n        L[i] = arr[left + i];\n    for (int j = 0; j < n2; j++)\n        R[j] = arr[mid + 1 + j];\n\n    int i = 0, j = 0, k = left;\n\n    while (i < n1 && j < n2) {\n        if (L[i] <= R[j]) {\n            arr[k] = L[i];\n            i++;\n        } else {\n            arr[k] = R[j];\n            j++;\n        }\n        k++;\n    }\n\n    while (i < n1) {\n        arr[k] = L[i];\n        i++;\n        k++;\n    }\n\n    while (j < n2) {\n        arr[k] = R[j];\n        j++;\n        k++;\n    }\n}\n\nvoid mergeSort(std::vector<int>& arr, int left, int right) {\n    if (left < right) {\n        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\n        mergeSort(arr, left, mid);\n        mergeSort(arr, mid + 1, right);\n        merge(arr, left, mid, right);\n    }\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\n    if (argc < 3) {\n        std::cerr << \"Usage: \" << argv[0] << \" input_file output_file\" << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    std::string inputFileName = argv[1];\n    std::string outputFileName = argv[2];\n\n    std::ifstream inputFile(inputFileName);\n    if (!inputFile.is_open()) {\n        std::cerr << \"Error opening input file: \" << inputFileName << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    std::vector<int> numbers;\n    std::string line;\n    while (std::getline(inputFile, line)) {\n        std::stringstream ss(line);\n        std::string word;\n        while (ss >> word) {\n            try {\n                int num = std::stoi(word);\n                numbers.push_back(num);\n            } catch (const std::invalid_argument&) {\n                std::cerr << \"Warning: Invalid integer '\" << word << \"' in file.\" << std::endl;\n            } catch (const std::out_of_range&) {\n                std::cerr << \"Warning: Integer out of range '\" << word << \"' in file.\" << std::endl;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    inputFile.close();\n\n    if (numbers.empty()) {\n        std::cerr << \"No valid integers found in the input file.\" << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    std::cout << \"Read \" << numbers.size() << \" integers from file.\" << std::endl;\n\n    mergeSort(numbers, 0, numbers.size() - 1);\n\n    std::ofstream outputFile(outputFileName);\n    if (!outputFile.is_open()) {\n        std::cerr << \"Error opening output file: \" << outputFileName << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    for (int num : numbers) {\n        outputFile << num << std::endl;\n    }\n    outputFile.close();\n\n    std::cout << \"Sorted numbers written to \" << outputFileName << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading the Input File**:\n   - Open the input file using `std::ifstream`.\n   - Read each line and parse integers, storing them in a vector.\n   - Handle invalid integers by skipping them and displaying a warning.\n\n2. **Merge Sort Implementation**:\n   - Recursively divide the vector into halves until sub-vectors contain single elements.\n   - Merge the sub-vectors in sorted order.\n\n3. **Writing the Output File**:\n   - Open the output file using `std::ofstream`.\n   - Write each sorted integer to the file, each on a new line.\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - Check if the input file opens successfully.\n   - Skip and warn about invalid integers.\n   - Check if the output file opens successfully.\n   - Inform the user if no valid integers are found in the input file."
