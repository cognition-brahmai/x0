        "content": "So you've got 10 marbles in a bag: 5 red, 3 blue, and 2 green. You want to know the probability of drawing two red marbles in a row without replacing the first one back into the bag. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what probability is. Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the event is drawing two red marbles consecutively without replacement.\n\nLet's consider the first draw:\n\n- Total marbles: 10\n\n- Red marbles: 5\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a red marble on the first draw is:\n\nP(Red1) = Number of red marbles / Total marbles = 5/10 = 1/2\n\nNow, since we're not replacing the first marble, the total number of marbles decreases by one after the first draw.\n\n- Total marbles left: 10 - 1 = 9\n\n- Red marbles left: 5 - 1 = 4 (since we've already drawn one red marble)\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a second red marble is:\n\nP(Red2 | Red1) = Number of red marbles left / Total marbles left = 4/9\n\nThe symbol \"|\" means \"given that,\" so P(Red2 | Red1) is the probability of drawing a second red marble given that the first one was red.\n\nTo find the overall probability of both events happening (drawing two red marbles in a row without replacement), we multiply the probabilities of each individual event:\n\nP(Two Reds) = P(Red1) * P(Red2 | Red1) = (1/2) * (4/9) = 4/18 = 2/9\n\nSo, the probability of drawing two red marbles without replacement is 2/9.\n\nLet's double-check this with another approach to ensure accuracy.\n\nWe can also calculate this using combinations. Combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, which in this case it doesn't since we're just interested in drawing two red marbles.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red marbles out of 5 is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(Red, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!) = (5*4*3!) / (2*1 * 3!) = (5*4) / 2 = 10\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any 2 marbles out of 10 is:\n\nC(Total, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10-2)!) = (10*9*8!) / (2*1 * 8!)) = (10*9)/2 = 45\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\nP(Two Reds) = C(Red, 2) / C(Total, 2) = 10/45 = 2/9\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation, so we can be confident that 2/9 is the correct probability.\n\nAlternatively, some people might think to calculate it differently, but as long as they account for the dependency of the second draw on the first, they should arrive at the same answer.\n\nIt's important to note that if the marbles were replaced after each draw, the probabilities would be different because the total number of marbles would remain the same for each draw. But since it's specified that there's no replacement, we have to adjust for the changing totals.\n\nAlso, if there were more colors or different numbers of marbles, the approach would be similar: calculate the probability for each draw, adjusting for any removals, and then multiply them together.\n\nIn summary, the probability of drawing two red marbles without replacement from a bag of 10 marbles (5 red, 3 blue, 2 green) is 2/9.\n\nI hope this explanation helps!
