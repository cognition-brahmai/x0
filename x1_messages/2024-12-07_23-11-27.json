        "content": "Believe it or not, the first woman to run for the U.S. presidency was Victoria Woodhull, all the way back in 1872. She was a pretty remarkable figure for her time\u2014she was involved in various social reform movements, including women's suffrage and labor rights. Running for president was just one of the many ways she challenged the norms of her era. It's fascinating to think about how far we've come since then, but also how much pioneering work was done by people like her."
