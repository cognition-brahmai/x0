        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: There's a box with red balls and blue balls. The ratio of red balls to blue balls is 3:2. And it says there are 15 red balls in the box. I need to find out how many blue balls there are.\n\nOkay, so ratios. I remember that ratios compare quantities. Here, the ratio is 3:2 for red to blue. That means for every 3 red balls, there are 2 blue balls.\n\nSo, if there are 15 red balls, I need to find out how many sets of 3 red balls there are in 15. Then, since for each set of 3 red balls there are 2 blue balls, I can find out the total number of blue balls.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, find out how many sets of 3 red balls are in 15 red balls.\n\n15 divided by 3 is 5. So, there are 5 sets.\n\nNow, for each set, there are 2 blue balls. So, 5 sets times 2 blue balls per set would be 10 blue balls.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to set up a proportion.\n\nThe ratio of red to blue is 3:2, which can be written as 3/2 = 15/x, where x is the number of blue balls.\n\nNow, solve for x.\n\nCross-multiplying, 3x = 2 * 15, so 3x = 30.\n\nThen, x = 30 / 3 = 10.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier answer. So, there are 10 blue balls.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nMaybe using fractions.\n\nThe ratio is 3:2, which means red balls are 3 parts and blue balls are 2 parts, making a total of 5 parts.\n\nIf there are 15 red balls, and red balls are 3 parts, then each part represents 15 / 3 = 5 balls.\n\nTherefore, blue balls, being 2 parts, would be 2 * 5 = 10 balls.\n\nAgain, 10 blue balls.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same answer, which is 10 blue balls.\n\nI think that's confident enough.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
