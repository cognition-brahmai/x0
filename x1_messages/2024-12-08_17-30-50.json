        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about renting a car. The company charges a flat fee of $20 per day and an additional 15 cents per mile driven. I need to figure out the total cost if I rent the car for 5 days and drive it for 200 miles.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the cost of renting the car for 5 days. Since the flat fee is $20 per day, I can multiply 20 by 5.\n\n20 * 5 = 100\n\nSo, the cost for 5 days is $100.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost for driving 200 miles. The charge is 15 cents per mile. So, I should multiply 0.15 by 200.\n\n0.15 * 200 = 30\n\nSo, the cost for driving 200 miles is $30.\n\nNow, I need to add these two amounts together to get the total cost.\n\n100 + 30 = 130\n\nTherefore, the total amount I will be charged is $130.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Is there any additional fee or tax that might be applied? The problem doesn't mention any other charges, so I think $130 is the final amount.\n\nJust to double-check, let me go through the calculations again.\n\nFlat fee per day: $20\n\nNumber of days: 5\n\nTotal flat fee: 20 * 5 = $100\n\nCost per mile: $0.15\n\nNumber of miles: 200\n\nTotal mileage cost: 0.15 * 200 = $30\n\nTotal cost: 100 + 30 = $130\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{130} \\]"
