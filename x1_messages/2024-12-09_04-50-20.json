        "content": "So the city wants to upgrade its public transportation system. They've got 100 buses right now, each can carry 50 passengers. They want to increase the total passenger capacity by 30%, and they want to keep the average occupancy rate at 80%. Also, they need to expand the routes, assuming the new routes will have similar passenger demand as the existing ones. I need to figure out how many additional buses they need and estimate how much to expand the routes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"total passenger capacity\" means. I think it's the maximum number of passengers all the buses can carry at once. So, with 100 buses, each holding 50 passengers, the current total capacity is 100 times 50, which is 5,000 passengers.\n\nThey want to increase this capacity by 30%. So, 30% of 5,000 is 0.3 times 5,000, which is 1,500. Therefore, the new total capacity should be 5,000 plus 1,500, which is 6,500 passengers.\n\nNow, they want to maintain an average occupancy rate of 80%. That means, on average, 80% of the seats are filled. So, if the new total capacity is 6,500, then the average number of passengers would be 80% of 6,500, which is 0.8 times 6,500, equal to 5,200 passengers.\n\nBut wait, is the occupancy rate relevant to calculating the number of buses needed? I think it's more about how full the buses are, not directly about the number of buses. The number of buses is determined by the desired capacity, which is already set to 6,500 passengers.\n\nSo, if each bus can carry 50 passengers, and they need a total capacity of 6,500, then the number of buses required would be 6,500 divided by 50, which is 130 buses.\n\nThey currently have 100 buses, so the number of additional buses needed is 130 minus 100, which is 30 buses.\n\nNow, regarding the expansion of routes. The problem says to assume that the expanded routes will have similar passenger demand as existing ones. So, if the current routes are served by 100 buses, and the new routes will be served by 30 additional buses, then the expansion in route coverage should be proportional to the number of buses assigned to them.\n\nIf the current routes are covered by 100 buses, and new routes are to be covered by 30 buses, then the expansion in route coverage should be 30% of the current route coverage, because 30 is 30% of 100.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let's see: 30 divided by 100 is 0.3, or 30%. So, yes, the route coverage should be expanded by 30%.\n\nBut maybe I should think in terms of passenger demand per route. If the new routes have similar passenger demand as existing ones, and each bus serves a certain route, then the passenger demand per bus should be similar.\n\nGiven that, if they're adding 30 buses, and each bus is expected to have similar passenger demand as the existing buses, then the total passenger demand should increase by 30 buses times 50 passengers per bus, which is 1,500 passengers, matching the earlier capacity increase.\n\nSo, the expansion in route coverage should be such that it can accommodate the additional 30 buses, each serving routes with similar passenger demand as the existing routes.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of bus-kilometers or service hours. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's sufficient to say that the route coverage should be expanded by 30%, assuming that the new routes will have similar passenger demand per unit length or per service hour as the existing routes.\n\nAlternatively, if the current routes are 100 units (arbitrary units), then the new routes should be an additional 30 units, making a total of 130 units, which aligns with the total capacity.\n\nBut maybe I need to consider the occupancy rate here as well. Wait, no, because the occupancy rate is about how full the buses are, not about the route coverage.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the current routes have a certain passenger demand, and the buses are running at 80% occupancy.\n\nBut the problem says to assume that the expanded routes will have similar passenger demand as existing ones. So, if the new routes are similar to the existing ones, then the passenger demand per route should be similar.\n\nGiven that, if they're adding 30 buses to serve new routes, and each bus serves one route (or a set of routes with similar demand), then the route coverage should be expanded to accommodate these 30 additional buses.\n\nAlternatively, if the current 100 buses cover a certain route network, and the new 30 buses will cover an additional network of similar demand per bus, then the route coverage should be expanded by the same factor.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at the ratio of routes to buses.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the current route coverage or the number of routes. It only mentions expanding the route coverage.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of the proportion of area or population covered by the routes.\n\nIf the current 100 buses cover a certain area or serve a certain population, then adding 30 buses would allow covering an additional area or serving more population, assuming similar demand densities.\n\nBut without specific data on the current route coverage, it's hard to give a precise estimate.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to say that the route coverage should be expanded by 30%, matching the increase in bus fleet size.\n\nThis assumes that the additional buses will be used to cover new routes that have similar passenger demand characteristics as the existing routes.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n- Additional buses needed: 30 buses\n\n- Route coverage expansion: 30% increase\n\nThis seems straightforward, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nCurrent total capacity: 100 buses * 50 passengers = 5,000 passengers\n\nDesired capacity increase: 30% of 5,000 = 1,500 passengers\n\nNew total capacity: 5,000 + 1,500 = 6,500 passengers\n\nNumber of buses needed: 6,500 / 50 = 130 buses\n\nAdditional buses needed: 130 - 100 = 30 buses\n\nRoute coverage expansion: 30% increase, assuming similar demand per route\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the route coverage expansion could be based on the additional passenger capacity.\n\nBut in that case, it would still be proportional to the number of buses added, assuming similar demand per bus.\n\nSo, I think 30% expansion in route coverage is a reasonable estimate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30 \\text{ additional buses and a } 30\\% \\text{ expansion in route coverage}} \\]"
