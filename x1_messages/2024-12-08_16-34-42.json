        "content": "To find the sum of all prime numbers between 50 and 100, we first need to identify all the prime numbers in that range. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nLet's list out the numbers between 50 and 100 and identify which ones are prime:\n\n53: Prime (divisors are 1 and 53)\n\n59: Prime\n\n61: Prime\n\n67: Prime\n\n71: Prime\n\n73: Prime\n\n79: Prime\n\n83: Prime\n\n89: Prime\n\n97: Prime\n\nNow, let's add them up:\n\n53 + 59 = 112\n\n112 + 61 = 173\n\n173 + 67 = 240\n\n240 + 71 = 311\n\n311 + 73 = 384\n\n384 + 79 = 463\n\n463 + 83 = 546\n\n546 + 89 = 635\n\n635 + 97 = 732\n\nSo, the sum of all prime numbers between 50 and 100 is 732.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{732} \\]"
