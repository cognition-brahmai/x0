After becoming corrupted by the One Ring, he transformed into a creature named Gollum. The corruption caused him to become slimy, pale, and with large, lidless eyes that could see in the dark. He was obsessed with the Ring and would do anything to get it back, even going so far as to betray his own kin. Gollum played a significant role in the story, particularly in leading Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee to Mordor, where the Ring could be destroyed."
