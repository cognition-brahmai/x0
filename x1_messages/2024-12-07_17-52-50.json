The expression is:\n\n(4^2 * 3) / 2 + 5 * (9 - 3)\n\nFirst, I need to recall the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\n9 - 3 = 6\n\nNow the expression becomes:\n\n(4^2 * 3) / 2 + 5 * 6\n\nNext, exponents:\n\n4^2 = 16\n\nSo now it's:\n\n(16 * 3) / 2 + 5 * 6\n\nNow, multiplication and division from left to right.\n\nFirst, 16 * 3 = 48\n\nThen, 48 / 2 = 24\n\nSo now the expression is:\n\n24 + 5 * 6\n\nNext, multiplication:\n\n5 * 6 = 30\n\nNow it's:\n\n24 + 30\n\nFinally, addition:\n\n24 + 30 = 54\n\nSo the answer is 54.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{54} \\]"
