        "content": "Before becoming a renowned physicist and developing the theory of relativity, Albert Einstein worked at a patent office in Bern, Switzerland. This period in his life is often referred to as his \"miracle year\" because it was during this time, in 1905, that he published four groundbreaking papers that transformed the world of physics. These papers covered the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and mass-energy equivalence, among other topics. The experience of evaluating patent applications is said to have influenced his thinking about the nature of space and time, which later contributed to his development of the theory of relativity."
