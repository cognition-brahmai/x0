        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a cylindrical water tank. It says the diameter is 6 meters and the height is 4 meters, and I need to find its volume in cubic meters. Alright, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that the volume of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( V \\) is the volume,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the base,\n\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder,\n\n- and \\( \\pi \\) is pi, which is approximately 3.14159.\n\nSo, I have the diameter, which is 6 meters. Remember that the radius is half of the diameter, so:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{6 \\, \\text{m}}{2} = 3 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nGot it. Now, the height \\( h \\) is given as 4 meters.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi (3 \\, \\text{m})^2 (4 \\, \\text{m}) \\]\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, square the radius:\n\n\\[ (3 \\, \\text{m})^2 = 9 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by the height:\n\n\\[ 9 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\times 4 \\, \\text{m} = 36 \\, \\text{m}^3 \\]\n\nFinally, multiply by pi:\n\n\\[ V = 36 \\, \\text{m}^3 \\times \\pi \\]\n\nSo, the volume is \\( 36\\pi \\) cubic meters.\n\nIf I need a numerical approximation, I can use \\( \\pi \\approx 3.14159 \\):\n\n\\[ V \\approx 36 \\times 3.14159 \\, \\text{m}^3 \\approx 113.097 \\, \\text{m}^3 \\]\n\nBut since the problem asks for the volume in cubic meters and doesn't specify to use a decimal approximation, I'll leave it in terms of pi.\n\nSo, the volume is \\( 36\\pi \\) cubic meters.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\n- Diameter = 6 meters \u2192 radius \\( r = 3 \\) meters.\n\n- Height \\( h = 4 \\) meters.\n\n- Volume formula for a cylinder: \\( V = \\pi r^2 h \\).\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi \\times (3)^2 \\times 4 = \\pi \\times 9 \\times 4 = 36\\pi \\, \\text{m}^3 \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I remember that the area of the base (which is a circle) is \\( \\pi r^2 \\), and then multiplying by the height gives the volume, which is consistent with what I did.\n\nI could also think about it in terms of the formula for the volume of a prism, which is base area times height, and a cylinder is like a prism with a circular base.\n\nSo, base area \\( A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\times 9 = 9\\pi \\, \\text{m}^2 \\), and height \\( h = 4 \\, \\text{m} \\), so volume \\( V = A \\times h = 9\\pi \\times 4 = 36\\pi \\, \\text{m}^3 \\).\n\nSame answer.\n\nMaybe I can approach it differently to confirm.\n\nLet's consider the circumference of the base, which is \\( c = 2\\pi r = 2\\pi \\times 3 = 6\\pi \\, \\text{m} \\).\n\nBut I don't think that helps directly with the volume.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about integrating the area along the height, but that's more complicated than necessary for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, if I imagine the cylinder as a stack of circular disks, each with thickness \\( dh \\), then the volume would be the integral of the area of these disks from 0 to h.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ V = \\int_{0}^{h} \\pi r^2 \\, dh = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nWhich is the same formula I started with.\n\nSo, again, confirming that \\( V = 36\\pi \\, \\text{m}^3 \\).\n\nAnother way to think about it: if I were to unfold the cylinder, the lateral surface area is \\( a = 2\\pi r h = 2\\pi \\times 3 \\times 4 = 24\\pi \\, \\text{m}^2 \\), but that's not directly related to the volume.\n\nWait, actually, the volume could also be thought of as the lateral surface area times the infinitesimal thickness integrated over the radius, but that seems overly complicated for this straightforward problem.\n\nI think I've confirmed enough that the volume is indeed \\( 36\\pi \\) cubic meters.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check the units.\n\n- Radius is in meters (m),\n\n- Height is in meters (m),\n\n- So, \\( r^2 \\) is in square meters (m\u00b2),\n\n- Multiply by height in meters (m), so volume is in cubic meters (m\u00b3),\n\n- And multiplying by pi keeps it in m\u00b3.\n\nUnits are consistent.\n\nAlso, considering the size of the tank, a volume of approximately 113 m\u00b3 seems reasonable for a cylinder with a diameter of 6 meters and height of 4 meters.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is \\( 36\\pi \\) cubic meters, or approximately 113.10 cubic meters.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify to use a decimal approximation, I'll stick with the exact form.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36\\pi} \\]"
