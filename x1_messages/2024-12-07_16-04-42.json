        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about a train traveling from Town A to Town B. It travels at 60 mph, takes a 20-minute break in Town C, which is halfway between A and B, and the entire journey, including the break, takes 3 hours. I need to find the distance between Town A and Town B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the journey. The train goes from A to C, takes a break, and then goes from C to B. Since C is halfway, the distance from A to C is the same as from C to B.\n\nLet's denote the distance from A to C as D. Therefore, the total distance from A to B is 2D.\n\nThe train travels at 60 mph, so the time to travel from A to C is D / 60 hours, and similarly, the time from C to B is also D / 60 hours.\n\nNow, there's a 20-minute break in Town C. I need to make sure all units are consistent. Since the travel time is in hours, I should convert 20 minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 20 minutes is 20/60 = 1/3 hours.\n\nThe total time for the journey is the sum of the travel times and the break time, which is 3 hours.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n(Time from A to C) + (Break time) + (Time from C to B) = Total time\n\nThat is:\n\n(D / 60) + (1/3) + (D / 60) = 3\n\nSimplifying, I can combine the terms:\n\n(2D / 60) + (1/3) = 3\n\nI can simplify 2D / 60 to D / 30:\n\n(D / 30) + (1/3) = 3\n\nNow, I need to solve for D.\n\nFirst, subtract 1/3 from both sides:\n\nD / 30 = 3 - 1/3\n\n3 minus 1/3 is (9/3 - 1/3) = 8/3.\n\nSo:\n\nD / 30 = 8/3\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 30:\n\nD = (8/3) * 30\n\nD = (8 * 30) / 3\n\nD = 240 / 3\n\nD = 80 miles\n\nSince D is the distance from A to C, and the total distance from A to B is 2D, then:\n\nTotal distance = 2 * 80 = 160 miles\n\nSo, the distance between Town A and Town B is 160 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{160} \\]"
