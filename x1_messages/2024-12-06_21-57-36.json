        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains here, one leaving from Station A at 8:00 AM going towards Station B, and another leaving from Station B at 9:00 AM going towards Station A. The distance between the stations is 300 miles. I need to find out when these two trains meet.\n\nFirst, let's note down the details:\n\n- Train from A:\n\n- Leaves at: 8:00 AM\n\n- Speed: 60 mph\n\n- Train from B:\n\n- Leaves at: 9:00 AM\n\n- Speed: 90 mph\n\n- Distance between stations: 300 miles\n\nSince the trains are moving towards each other, their speeds will add up when calculating how quickly they approach each other. So, the relative speed is 60 mph + 90 mph = 150 mph.\n\nBut wait a minute, the train from B leaves an hour later. So, in that one hour, the train from A has already been covering some distance.\n\nLet's calculate how far the train from A has traveled by the time the train from B starts at 9:00 AM.\n\nFrom 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM is one hour. So, train A travels 60 miles in that hour (since its speed is 60 mph).\n\nTherefore, at 9:00 AM, the distance remaining between the two trains is 300 miles - 60 miles = 240 miles.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other starting at 9:00 AM, with a combined speed of 150 mph.\n\nTo find the time it takes for them to cover the remaining 240 miles, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, Time = 240 miles / 150 mph = 1.6 hours.\n\nNow, 1.6 hours is 1 hour and 0.6 hours. To convert 0.6 hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).\n\n0.6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 36 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the trains meet 1 hour and 36 minutes after 9:00 AM.\n\nAdding 1 hour to 9:00 AM brings us to 10:00 AM. Then adding 36 minutes brings us to 10:36 AM.\n\nSo, the trains meet at 10:36 AM.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the total time each train has been traveling when they meet.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time after 9:00 AM when they meet as t hours.\n\nSo, the train from A has been traveling for t + 1 hours (since it started an hour earlier), and the train from B has been traveling for t hours.\n\nThe distance covered by train A by that time is 60 mph * (t + 1 hours).\n\nThe distance covered by train B is 90 mph * t hours.\n\nThe sum of these distances should equal the total distance between the stations, which is 300 miles.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n60(t + 1) + 90t = 300\n\nLet\u2019s solve for t:\n\n60t + 60 + 90t = 300\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n150t + 60 = 300\n\nSubtract 60 from both sides:\n\n150t = 240\n\nDivide both sides by 150:\n\nt = 240 / 150 = 1.6 hours\n\nAgain, that's 1 hour and 36 minutes after 9:00 AM, which is 10:36 AM.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it using relative speed.\n\nThe train from A starts at 8:00 AM and travels at 60 mph.\n\nBy 9:00 AM, it's 60 miles away from Station A, so 300 - 60 = 240 miles apart from Station B.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other starting at 9:00 AM, with speeds 60 mph and 90 mph.\n\nRelative speed is 60 + 90 = 150 mph.\n\nTime to cover 240 miles at 150 mph is 240 / 150 = 1.6 hours, which is again 1 hour and 36 minutes, leading to 10:36 AM.\n\nI think this is consistent across different methods, so I'm confident that the answer is 10:36 AM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10:36\\ \\text{AM}} \\]"
