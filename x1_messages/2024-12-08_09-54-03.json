        "content": "So, three friends went out for dinner and got a bill for $300. They agreed to split the bill evenly, which means each person would pay $100, right? Because $300 divided by 3 is $100 per person.\n\nBut then they found out they had a $50 discount coupon. So, the total bill after the discount would be $300 minus $50, which is $250. Now, they need to figure out how much each person should pay now, considering the discount.\n\nThe problem says they want to keep the discount amount proportional to their initial payment. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, each friend initially agreed to pay $100. The total discount is $50, so they need to distribute this $50 discount proportionally among the three friends based on what they initially paid.\n\nSince each friend paid $100 initially, and the discount is $50 in total, we need to see how much of this $50 each friend should get based on their initial payment.\n\nWait a minute, since they all paid the same amount initially, $100 each, the discount should probably be divided equally among them as well.\n\nSo, $50 discount divided by 3 friends is approximately $16.67 per friend.\n\nTherefore, each friend should get a $16.67 reduction from their initial $100 payment.\n\nSo, $100 minus $16.67 is $83.33.\n\nTherefore, each friend should now pay $83.33.\n\nLet me check if that adds up.\n\nIf each friend pays $83.33, then three friends paying that would total $249.99, which is almost $250. The slight discrepancy is due to rounding.\n\nAlternatively, we could avoid rounding and use fractions.\n\n$50 divided by 3 is exactly $16.666..., so $100 minus $16.666... is $83.333..., and three friends paying $83.333... each would total exactly $250.\n\nSo, each friend should pay $83.33, considering the discount is distributed equally among them.\n\nBut let's think again. The problem says to keep the discount amount proportional to their initial payment.\n\nSince all friends paid the same initial amount, $100 each, the discount should be divided equally among them.\n\nSo, yes, each friend gets a $16.67 reduction, and pays $83.33.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is that the total bill after discount is $250, and they split that evenly, so $250 divided by 3 is approximately $83.33 per friend.\n\nEither way, we arrive at the same answer.\n\nSo, each friend should now pay $83.33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{83.33} \\]"
