        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the car is traveling in two different phases with different speeds and times. First, it goes at 60 miles per hour for 4 hours, and then it speeds up to 80 miles per hour for another 2 hours. We need to find out the total distance it covers.\n\nI remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. So, for each phase, I can calculate the distance separately and then add them together to get the total distance.\n\nLet's start with the first phase:\n\nSpeed = 60 miles per hour\n\nTime = 4 hours\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 4 hours = 240 miles\n\nOkay, so in the first part, the car covers 240 miles.\n\nNow, for the second phase:\n\nSpeed = 80 miles per hour\n\nTime = 2 hours\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time = 80 miles/hour \u00d7 2 hours = 160 miles\n\nSo, in the second part, the car covers 160 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just need to add these two distances together:\n\nTotal distance = 240 miles + 160 miles = 400 miles\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst phase: 60 miles/hour \u00d7 4 hours = 240 miles. That seems correct.\n\nSecond phase: 80 miles/hour \u00d7 2 hours = 160 miles. That also seems right.\n\nAdding them up: 240 + 160 = 400 miles. Yeah, that looks correct.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the average speed for the entire journey.\n\nLet's try that. To find the average speed for the entire trip, I would need the total distance and the total time.\n\nWait, but that's what we're trying to find. So, maybe it's not the best approach here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the distances separately and then sum them up, which is what I already did.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to plot a graph of speed versus time, the area under the curve would give me the distance. But that might be more complicated for this situation.\n\nGiven that this is a straightforward problem, my initial approach seems appropriate.\n\nSo, the total distance covered by the car is 400 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400} \\]"
