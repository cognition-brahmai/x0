        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It's about finding out how many students in a class don't play any of the three sports: soccer, basketball, or volleyball. We have a total of 30 students, and we're given the numbers for each sport and their overlaps.\n\nFirst, let's list out what we know:\n\n- Total students, \\( n = 30 \\)\n\n- Students who play soccer, \\( |S| = 12 \\)\n\n- Students who play basketball, \\( |B| = 14 \\)\n\n- Students who play volleyball, \\( |V| = 16 \\)\n\n- Students who play both soccer and basketball, \\( |S \\cap B| = 5 \\)\n\n- Students who play both soccer and volleyball, \\( |S \\cap V| = 6 \\)\n\n- Students who play both basketball and volleyball, \\( |B \\cap V| = 7 \\)\n\n- Students who play all three sports, \\( |S \\cap B \\cap V| = 3 \\)\n\nWe need to find the number of students who don't play any of these sports. To do this, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students who play at least one sport and then subtract that from the total number of students.\n\nThe formula for the number of students who play at least one sport is:\n\n\\[\n|S \\cup B \\cup V| = |S| + |B| + |V| - |S \\cap B| - |S \\cap V| - |B \\cap V| + |S \\cap B \\cap V|\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\n\\[\n|S \\cup B \\cup V| = 12 + 14 + 16 - 5 - 6 - 7 + 3\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate that step by step:\n\nFirst, add the individual sport players:\n\n\\[\n12 + 14 = 26\n\\]\n\n\\[\n26 + 16 = 42\n\\]\n\nNext, subtract the students who play two sports:\n\n\\[\n42 - 5 = 37\n\\]\n\n\\[\n37 - 6 = 31\n\\]\n\n\\[\n31 - 7 = 24\n\\]\n\nFinally, add back the students who play all three sports:\n\n\\[\n24 + 3 = 27\n\\]\n\nSo, 27 students play at least one sport.\n\nNow, to find the number of students who don't play any sports, we subtract the number who play at least one sport from the total number of students:\n\n\\[\nn - |S \\cup B \\cup V| = 30 - 27 = 3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, 3 students don't play any of these sports.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again with the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\n\\[\n|S \\cup B \\cup V| = |S| + |B| + |V| - |S \\cap B| - |S \\cap V| - |B \\cap V| + |S \\cap B \\cap V|\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n|S \\cup B \\cup V| = 12 + 14 + 16 - 5 - 6 - 7 + 3\n\\]\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n\\[\n12 + 14 = 26\n\\]\n\n\\[\n26 + 16 = 42\n\\]\n\n\\[\n42 - 5 = 37\n\\]\n\n\\[\n37 - 6 = 31\n\\]\n\n\\[\n31 - 7 = 24\n\\]\n\n\\[\n24 + 3 = 27\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 27 students play at least one sport, and therefore, \\( 30 - 27 = 3 \\) students don't play any sports.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a Venn diagram or something similar.\n\nIf I were to draw a Venn diagram with three circles representing soccer, basketball, and volleyball, I would need to fill in the overlapping regions based on the given information.\n\nFirst, the center where all three circles overlap represents students who play all three sports, which is 3 students.\n\nNext, the regions where two circles overlap:\n\n- Soccer and basketball only: \\( |S \\cap B| - |S \\cap B \\cap V| = 5 - 3 = 2 \\)\n\n- Soccer and volleyball only: \\( |S \\cap V| - |S \\cap B \\cap V| = 6 - 3 = 3 \\)\n\n- Basketball and volleyball only: \\( |B \\cap V| - |S \\cap B \\cap V| = 7 - 3 = 4 \\)\n\nNow, the regions where only one sport is played:\n\n- Soccer only: \\( |S| - |S \\cap B| - |S \\cap V| + |S \\cap B \\cap V| = 12 - 5 - 6 + 3 = 4 \\)\n\n- Basketball only: \\( |B| - |S \\cap B| - |B \\cap V| + |S \\cap B \\cap V| = 14 - 5 - 7 + 3 = 5 \\)\n\n- Volleyball only: \\( |V| - |S \\cap V| - |B \\cap V| + |S \\cap B \\cap V| = 16 - 6 - 7 + 3 = 6 \\)\n\nNow, let's add up all these regions:\n\n- Soccer only: 4\n\n- Basketball only: 5\n\n- Volleyball only: 6\n\n- Soccer and basketball only: 2\n\n- Soccer and volleyball only: 3\n\n- Basketball and volleyball only: 4\n\n- All three sports: 3\n\nTotal students who play at least one sport:\n\n\\[\n4 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 = 27\n\\]\n\nAgain, this matches our previous calculation. Therefore, the number of students who don't play any sport is \\( 30 - 27 = 3 \\).\n\nI feel confident with this answer now. The key was to correctly apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion and to check the calculations step by step. Using the Venn diagram approach also helped verify the result.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
