        "content": "Sure, here's a simple Python function that accomplishes that:\n\n```python\ndef char_count(input_string):\n    count_dict = {}\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char in count_dict:\n            count_dict[char] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[char] = 1\n    return count_dict\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a string to it, and it will return a dictionary where the keys are the characters from the string and the values are the counts of each character.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nprint(char_count(\"hello\"))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n{'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1}\n```\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
