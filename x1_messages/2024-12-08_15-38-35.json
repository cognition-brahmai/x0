        "content": "Alright, I'll guide you through creating a Python script that trains a simple neural network on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow. We'll keep it straightforward so you can understand each part of the process.\n\nFirst, make sure you have TensorFlow installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install tensorflow\n```\n\nNow, let's start by importing the necessary modules:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers, models\n```\n\nNext, we'll load the MNIST dataset. TensorFlow keras API has a built-in function to load MNIST:\n\n```python\nmnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist\n(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()\n```\n\nThe MNIST images are 28x28 pixels, and the dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.\n\nBefore feeding the data into the neural network, we need to preprocess it. We'll normalize the images to have pixel values between 0 and 1:\n\n```python\ntrain_images = train_images / 255.0\ntest_images = test_images / 255.0\n```\n\nNow, let's define our simple neural network model. We'll use the Sequential API for this:\n\n```python\nmodel = models.Sequential([\n    layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),\n    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),\n    layers.Dense(10)\n])\n```\n\nHere's what each layer does:\n\n1. `Flatten`: Converts the 2D image data (28x28 pixels) into a 1D array (784 pixels).\n\n2. First `Dense` layer: 128 neurons with ReLU activation function.\n\n3. Second `Dense` layer: 10 neurons (for the 10 digits) without an activation function, as we'll use softmax in the loss function.\n\nNext, we need to compile the model. We'll use the Adam optimizer and SparseCategoricalCrossentropy loss function since we have integer labels:\n\n```python\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\n              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),\n              metrics=['accuracy'])\n```\n\nNow, let's train the model. We'll train it for 5 epochs:\n\n```python\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5)\n```\n\nAfter training, we'll evaluate the model on the test dataset:\n\n```python\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\nprint('\\nTest accuracy:', test_acc)\n```\n\nThat's it! Here's the complete script:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers, models\n\n# Load the MNIST dataset\nmnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist\n(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()\n\n# Preprocess the data\ntrain_images = train_images / 255.0\ntest_images = test_images / 255.0\n\n# Build the model\nmodel = models.Sequential([\n    layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),\n    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),\n    layers.Dense(10)\n])\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\n              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),\n              metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5)\n\n# Evaluate the model\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\nprint('\\nTest accuracy:', test_acc)\n```\n\nYou can run this script, and it will train a simple neural network on the MNIST dataset and print out the test accuracy. If you want to improve the model, you can try adding more layers, increasing the number of neurons, or using different activation functions.\n\n**Note**: If you're running this on a machine without a GPU, training might take a bit of time. Also, the accuracy can vary depending on the random initialization of the weights."
