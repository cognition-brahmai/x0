        "content": "So I've got this problem here: In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, divided into four suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades), with 13 cards per suit, I need to find the probability of drawing a pair of cards with the same rank, like two aces or two kings, and so on.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We're drawing two cards from the deck, and we want both of them to have the same rank. Ranks include Ace, 2 through 10, Jack, Queen, and King, making 13 possible ranks in total.\n\nI remember that probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to draw any two cards from the deck.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of ways to draw two cards from 52. Since the order doesn't matter (drawing card A first and card B second is the same as drawing card B first and card A second), we should use combinations, not permutations. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 cards from 52 is:\n\n\\[\nC(52, 2) = \\frac{52!}{2!(52 - 2)!} = \\frac{52 \\times 51}{2 \\times 1} = 1326\n\\]\n\nAlright, so there are 1326 possible pairs of cards that can be drawn from the deck.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the pairs where both cards have the same rank.\n\nLet's think about how many ways there are to draw two cards of the same rank.\n\nThere are 13 ranks in total, and for each rank, there are 4 cards (one from each suit). So, for a given rank, say Ace, how many ways are there to choose two Aces?\n\nAgain, since order doesn't matter, we use combinations. For each rank, the number of ways to choose 2 cards out of 4 is:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, for Aces, there are 6 possible pairs. The same logic applies to each of the other ranks. Since there are 13 ranks, the total number of favorable pairs is:\n\n\\[\n13 \\times 6 = 78\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 78 pairs where both cards have the same rank.\n\nNow, to find the probability, I divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{same rank}) = \\frac{78}{1326}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 6:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{78 \\div 6}{1326 \\div 6} = \\frac{13}{221}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, can I simplify it further? Let's see. 13 and 221 both divisible by 13:\n\n\\[\n13 \u00f7 13 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n221 \u00f7 13 = 17\n\\]\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{17}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a pair of cards with the same rank is \\( \\frac{1}{17} \\).\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability step by step. First, I draw one card from the deck. Doesn't matter what it is, since we're interested in the second card matching its rank.\n\nAfter drawing the first card, there are 51 cards left in the deck. Since there are 4 cards of each rank, and one has already been drawn, there are 3 cards left that match the rank of the first card.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the second card matches the rank of the first card is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{51} = \\frac{1}{17}\n\\]\n\nOops, that's the same answer I got earlier. That's a good sign, it confirms that my initial calculation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the first method, using combinations, and I get the same answer as the second method, which is more straightforward, it reinforces that \\( \\frac{1}{17} \\) is indeed the correct probability.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a pair of cards with the same rank from a standard deck of 52 cards is \\( \\frac{1}{17} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{17}} \\]"
