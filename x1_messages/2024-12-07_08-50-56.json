        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a school with 120 students. According to the problem, 25% of these students play football, and 30% play basketball. We need to find the maximum number of students who play both sports.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many students play football and how many play basketball.\n\nNumber of students who play football:\n\n25% of 120 = (25/100) * 120 = 30 students\n\nNumber of students who play basketball:\n\n30% of 120 = (30/100) * 120 = 36 students\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum number of students who play both sports. To maximize the number of students who play both sports, we need to consider the overlap between the two groups.\n\nThe total number of students who play either football or basketball or both can be found using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal = number who play football + number who play basketball - number who play both\n\nLet's denote the number who play both as x.\n\nSo,\n\nTotal = 30 + 36 - x\n\nBut we also know that the total number of students is 120, and this total includes students who play neither sport. Therefore, the number of students who play either football or basketball or both cannot exceed 120.\n\nHowever, in this problem, we are not given any information about students who play neither sport. To maximize the number of students who play both sports, we should assume that as many students as possible play both sports, even if that means that some students play only one sport or neither.\n\nBut wait, to maximize the overlap, we should consider the smallest group and see how much it can overlap with the larger group.\n\nLet's think about it differently. The maximum number of students who can play both sports is limited by the smaller of the two groups.\n\nSince 30 students play football and 36 play basketball, the maximum possible overlap is 30, because there are only 30 football players to begin with.\n\nSo, the maximum number of students who can play both sports is 30.\n\nBut let's verify this with the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nTotal = 30 + 36 - x\n\nIf x = 30, then Total = 30 + 36 - 30 = 36 students\n\nThis means that if 30 students play both sports, then the total number of students involved in either sport is 36, which is the number of basketball players. This makes sense because all football players are also basketball players, and there are 6 additional basketball players who don't play football.\n\nSince the total number of students in the school is 120, and only 36 are involved in either sport (if x=30), this is acceptable because it doesn't exceed the total number of students.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students who can play both sports is 30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
