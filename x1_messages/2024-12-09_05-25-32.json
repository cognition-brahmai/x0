        "content": "Mosaic was a major art form during the Late Antique period, which is the era of art made in the Western Roman Empire around 300 to 500 A.D. This period was characterized by the use of small pieces of colored glass, stone, or ceramic called tesserae, which were arranged to create intricate and colorful images on walls, floors, and ceilings. Mosaics were used to decorate public buildings, churches, and private homes, and they often depicted religious scenes, mythological stories, or everyday life. The use of mosaic art continued to evolve and spread throughout the Byzantine Empire and beyond, leaving a lasting impact on the art world."
