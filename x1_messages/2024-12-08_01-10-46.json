        "content": "Alright, I need to find out who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2005 and also get some information about their famous works. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to know who won the prize that year. I can use the Bing search engine for this. So, I'll make a search query like \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2005 winner.\" That should give me the name of the laureate.\n\nOnce I have the name, I need to find out about their famous works. For that, I might need to look up more information about them. Maybe I can use the DocReader tool to read a biography or a page about their works.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the name, I can use TextAnalyzer to extract key details from a text about the author, including their notable works.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach would be to search for \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2005 winner and their works.\" That way, I might get a search result that already lists both the winner's name and their famous works.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should probably first find the winner's name separately and then look for their works independently to ensure accuracy.\n\nLet me plan this out:\n\nStep 1: Use Bing to search for \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2005 winner.\"\n\n- This will give me the name of the laureate.\n\nStep 2: Once I have the name, use Bing again to search for \"[ laureate's name ] famous works\" or \"[ laureate's name ] notable works.\"\n\n- This should give me a list of their most well-known works.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the name, I could use DocReader to read a Wikipedia page or a biography page and then use TextAnalyzer to extract the key works.\n\nBut to keep it simple, using Bing twice might be sufficient.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way. I can search for \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2005 winner and their works\" in one go.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStep 1: Use Bing to search for \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2005 winner and their works.\"\n\n- This might give me search results that already list the winner and their famous works.\n\n- I can then use TextAnalyzer to extract the relevant information from the search results.\n\nBut Bing's search results are usually links, and I might need to read the content of those links to get the actual information.\n\nSo, perhaps a better approach would be:\n\nStep 1: Use Bing to search for \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2005 winner.\"\n\n- Get the name of the laureate.\n\nStep 2: Use DocReader to read a webpage about the laureate, perhaps their Wikipedia page.\n\n- This should give me a text containing information about the author, including their works.\n\nStep 3: Use TextAnalyzer to extract the famous works from the text obtained in Step 2.\n\nThis seems systematic. Let's outline it clearly.\n\nFinal Plan:\n\nStep 1: Use Bing to search for \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2005 winner.\"\n\n- Input: \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2005 winner.\"\n\n- Output: Store the search results in :evidence0:\n\nStep 2: Use TextAnalyzer on :evidence0: to extract the name of the winner.\n\n- Input: :evidence0:\n\n- Output: Store the extracted name in :evidence1:\n\nStep 3: Use Bing to search for \":evidence1: Wikipedia.\"\n\n- Input: [name from :evidence1:] + \" Wikipedia\"\n\n- Output: Store the search results in :evidence2:\n\nStep 4: Use DocReader on the top URL from :evidence2: to read the Wikipedia page.\n\n- Input: Top URL from :evidence2:\n\n- Output: Store the page content in :evidence3:\n\nStep 5: Use TextAnalyzer on :evidence3: to extract famous works of the laureate.\n\n- Input: :evidence3:\n\n- Output: Store the extracted works in :evidence4:\n\nStep 6: Use QnAMaker to formulate the final answer.\n\n- Input: \"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2005 and what are some of their most famous works?\" along with reference to :evidence4:\n\n- Output: Final answer referencing :evidence4:\n\nThis plan should help me systematically find and present the required information."
