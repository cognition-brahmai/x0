        "content": "I've got this task to create a command-line tool in Golang that interacts with the Twitter API to fetch and analyze tweets based on certain keywords. The tool needs to provide statistics like the total number of tweets, average sentiment score, and the most common words used in those tweets. Sounds interesting! Let's break this down into manageable steps.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a new Go project. I'll create a directory for my project and initialize it with `go mod init`. I should also decide on the command-line flags or arguments that users will provide to specify the keywords they're interested in.\n\nNext, I need to interact with the Twitter API. That means I'll have to sign up for Twitter Developer account, create an app, and get the necessary API keys and access tokens. Once I have those, I can use a Go library to handle the API requests. I've heard of `github.com/dghubble/go-twitter`, which seems popular for this purpose.\n\nSo, I'll import that library and set up the client with my credentials. Then, I need to make API calls to search for tweets containing the specified keywords. I should consider rate limits and maybe implement some error handling to manage API errors gracefully.\n\nOnce I have the tweets, I need to analyze them. One part of the analysis is calculating the average sentiment score. For sentiment analysis, I might need another library. There are several Go libraries for natural language processing, like `github.com/cdipaolo/sentiment`. I should check which one is best suited for my needs.\n\nAfter installing the sentiment analysis library, I'll process each tweet's text to get its sentiment score and keep a running total to calculate the average later.\n\nAdditionally, I need to find the most common words used in these tweets. For that, I can tokenize the tweet texts, perhaps using a library like `github.com/jdkato/prose`, which can help in splitting text into words and filtering out stop words like \"and\", \"the\", etc.\n\nI'll need to collect all the words from all the tweets, count their occurrences, and then sort them to find the top ones.\n\nFinally, I'll display all these statistics to the user in a clear and readable format.\n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\n1. Set up a new Go project.\n\n2. Define command-line flags for keywords.\n\n3. Set up Twitter API client using `go-twitter`.\n\n4. Fetch tweets containing the specified keywords.\n\n5. Use a sentiment analysis library to calculate the average sentiment score.\n\n6. Use a natural language processing library to find the most common words.\n\n7. Display the total tweet count, average sentiment score, and most common words.\n\nI should also think about testing. Since I'll be dealing with external APIs, I might want to write some integration tests, but I should be careful with API rate limits during testing.\n\nError handling is crucial, especially for API requests which can fail due to network issues or invalid credentials.\n\nI should also consider how to handle large volumes of data, in case there are many tweets matching the keywords.\n\nPrivacy is another concern. I need to make sure that the tool doesn't expose any sensitive information and complies with Twitter's API usage policies.\n\nAlright, I think I have a plan. Let's start by setting up the project and importing the necessary libraries.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Golang command-line tool that interacts with the Twitter API to fetch and analyze tweets containing specified keywords, follow these steps:\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"flag\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"os\"\n\n\t\"github.com/dghubble/go-twitter/twitter\"\n\t\"github.com/dghubble/oauth1\"\n\t\"github.com/cdipaolo/sentiment\"\n\t\"github.com/jdkato/prose/v2\"\n\t\"strings\"\n)\n\nvar (\n\tconsumerKey    = os.Getenv(\"TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY\")\n\tconsumerSecret = os.Getenv(\"TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET\")\n\taccessToken    = os.Getenv(\"TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN\")\n(accessTokenSecret = os.Getenv(\"TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET\")\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tkeyword := flag.String(\"keyword\", \"golang\", \"Keyword to search for in tweets\")\n\tcount := flag.Int(\"count\", 100, \"Number of tweets to fetch\")\n\tflag.Parse()\n\n\t// Set up Twitter client\n\tconfig := oauth1.NewConfig(consumerKey, consumerSecret)\n\ttoken := oauth1.NewToken(accessToken, accessTokenSecret)\n\thttpClient := config.Client(oauth1.NoContext, token)\n\tclient := twitter.NewClient(httpClient)\n\n\t// Search for tweets\n\tparams := &twitter.SearchTweetParams{\n\t\tQuery:   *keyword,\n\t\tCount:   *count,\n\t\tResultType: \"recent\",\n\t}\n\ttweets, _, err := client.Search.Tweets(params)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Error searching tweets: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\n\t// Initialize sentiment analyzer\n\tanalyzer, err := sentiment.NewAnalyzer()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Error initializing sentiment analyzer: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\n\tvar totalSentiment float64\n\twordCounts := make(map[string]int)\n\n\tfor _, tweet := range tweets.Statuses {\n\t\ttext := tweet.Text\n\t\tsentimentScore, _ := analyzer.PolarityScore(text)\n\t\ttotalSentiment += sentimentScore.Compound\n\n\t\t// Tokenize and count words\n\t\tdoc, _ := prose.NewDocument(text)\n\t\tfor _, token := range doc.Tokens() {\n\t\t\tif token.Pos != \"PUNCT\" && !strings.ContainsRune(string(token), ' ') {\n\t\t\t\tword := strings.ToLower(string(token))\n\t\t\t\twordCounts[word]++\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\taverageSentiment := totalSentiment / float64(len(tweets.Statuses))\n\n\t// Find most common words\n\ttype wordCount struct {\n\t\tword  string\n\t\tcount int\n\t}\n\tvar wordCountSlice []wordCount\n\tfor word, count := range wordCounts {\n\t\twordCountSlice = append(wordCountSlice, wordCount{word, count})\n\t}\n\tsort.Slice(wordCountSlice, func(i, j int) bool {\n\t\treturn wordCountSlice[i].count > wordCountSlice[j].count\n\t})\n\n\t// Display statistics\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Total tweets: %d\\n\", len(tweets.Statuses))\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Average sentiment score: %.3f\\n\", averageSentiment)\n\tfmt.Println(\"Most common words:\")\n\tfor i := 0; i < 10 && i < len(wordCountSlice); i++ {\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"%s: %d\\n\", wordCountSlice[i].word, wordCountSlice[i].count)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Setting Up the Project**:\n   - Create a new Go module using `go mod init <module-name>`.\n   - Install required packages:\n     ```sh\n     go get github.com/dghubble/go-twitter/twitter\n     go get github.com/dghubble/oauth1\n     go get github.com/cdipaolo/sentiment\n     go get github.com/jdkato/prose/v2\n     ```\n\n2. **Twitter API Setup**:\n   - Obtain API keys and access tokens from Twitter Developer account.\n   - Set environment variables for Twitter credentials.\n\n3. **Command-Line Flags**:\n   - Define flags for keyword and count of tweets to fetch.\n\n4. **Fetching Tweets**:\n   - Use `go-twitter` to create a Twitter client.\n   - Search for tweets containing the specified keyword.\n\n5. **Sentiment Analysis**:\n   - Use the `sentiment` package to analyze the sentiment of each tweet.\n   - Calculate the average sentiment score.\n\n6. **Word Frequency Analysis**:\n   - Use the `prose` package to tokenize tweet texts and count word frequencies.\n   - Identify the most common words.\n\n7. **Display Statistics**:\n   - Print total tweet count, average sentiment score, and top 10 most common words.\n\nThis tool provides a straightforward way to analyze tweets based on keywords, offering insights into sentiment and word usage."
