        "content": "Let's tackle this ant population problem. So, we've got an ant colony that doubles its population every week, and it starts with 100 ants. We need to figure out how many ants there will be after 5 weeks.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"doubles its population every week\" means. Does it mean that each week, the number of ants is multiplied by 2? Yeah, that sounds right. So, starting with 100 ants, after one week it would be 100 times 2, which is 200 ants. Then, after the second week, it would be 200 times 2, which is 400, and so on.\n\nLet me try to list it out week by week to see the pattern:\n\n- Week 0 (starting point): 100 ants\n\n- Week 1: 100 * 2 = 200 ants\n\n- Week 2: 200 * 2 = 400 ants\n\n- Week 3: 400 * 2 = 800 ants\n\n- Week 4: 800 * 2 = 1600 ants\n\n- Week 5: 1600 * 2 = 3200 ants\n\nSo, after 5 weeks, there would be 3200 ants.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way to look at this. Maybe I can use the formula for exponential growth. I recall that exponential growth can be calculated using the formula:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (growth rate)^(time)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 100 ants, the growth rate is 2 (since it doubles), and the time is 5 weeks.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nFinal amount = 100 * 2^5\n\n2^5 is 32, so:\n\nFinal amount = 100 * 32 = 3200 ants\n\nThat matches what I got earlier by listing it out week by week.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using addition instead of multiplication. Like, maybe the colony adds the same number of ants each week instead of doubling. But the problem says it doubles every week, so that shouldn't be the case.\n\nWait, maybe some people might get confused between doubling and adding a fixed number. For example, someone might think that doubling means adding the same amount each time, but that's not correct. Doubling means multiplying by 2 each time.\n\nLet me check if there's any chance that the \"doubling\" refers to something else. Like, maybe it's doubling from the previous week's increase or something. But no, the problem clearly says \"doubles its population every week,\" which means each week the population is multiplied by 2.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the starting point is week 0 or week 1. In my calculation, I considered week 0 as the starting point with 100 ants, and then week 1 is 200, and so on, up to week 5 being 3200. That seems correct.\n\nMaybe some people would think that after 5 weeks, it's only doubled 4 times or something, but no, starting from week 0 to week 5 is 5 doublings.\n\nLet me consider if there are any external factors that might affect the population, like ants dying or leaving the colony, but the problem doesn't mention any such things. It seems to assume ideal conditions where the population doubles every week without any losses.\n\nAlso, is there a possibility that the colony can't sustain such exponential growth and that the growth rate might slow down over time? Well, in real life, that might happen due to resource limitations, but this problem seems to be theoretical, assuming unlimited growth.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the population after 5 weeks should be 3200 ants.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if the doubling happens at the end of each week or continuously. But since it's discrete weeks, and the problem says \"every week,\" it's safe to assume that it's discrete doublings at the end of each week.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps some people might misinterpret \"doubles every week\" as adding twice the original amount each week. So, starting with 100 ants, they might think that each week you add another 200 ants (twice the original 100), leading to:\n\n- Week 0: 100 ants\n\n- Week 1: 100 + 200 = 300 ants\n\n- Week 2: 300 + 200 = 500 ants\n\n- Week 3: 500 + 200 = 700 ants\n\n- Week 4: 700 + 200 = 900 ants\n\n- Week 5: 900 + 200 = 1100 ants\n\nBut that's incorrect because \"doubling\" means multiplying by 2, not adding twice the original amount each time.\n\nAlternatively, someone might think that \"doubling every week\" means adding the same amount each week, equal to the original population. So, adding 100 ants each week:\n\n- Week 0: 100 ants\n\n- Week 1: 100 + 100 = 200 ants\n\n- Week 2: 200 + 100 = 300 ants\n\n- Week 3: 300 + 100 = 400 ants\n\n- Week 4: 400 + 100 = 500 ants\n\n- Week 5: 500 + 100 = 600 ants\n\nBut again, that's not correct because doubling means multiplying by 2, not adding the original amount.\n\nSo, to summarize, the correct approach is to multiply the population by 2 at the end of each week.\n\nTherefore, starting with 100 ants:\n\n- After Week 1: 100 * 2 = 200 ants\n\n- After Week 2: 200 * 2 = 400 ants\n\n- After Week 3: 400 * 2 = 800 ants\n\n- After Week 4: 800 * 2 = 1600 ants\n\n- After Week 5: 1600 * 2 = 3200 ants\n\nAlternatively, using the exponential growth formula:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (growth rate)^time\n\nFinal amount = 100 * 2^5 = 100 * 32 = 3200 ants\n\nSo, the answer should be 3200 ants after 5 weeks.\n\nI think that's the correct and most logical answer based on the information provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3200} \\]"
