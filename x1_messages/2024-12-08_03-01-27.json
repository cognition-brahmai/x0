Please note that Captain America is a fictional character, and any portrayal here is purely imaginative.]\n\n---\n\nDear [Friend's Name],\n\nI hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere apologies for missing your birthday party last weekend. I know how important this day is to you, and I truly regret not being able to be there in person to celebrate with you and share in your special day.\n\nAs you know, duty called, and I had to prioritize my responsibilities as Captain America. There was a situation that required my immediate attention, and I had to drop everything to handle it. While I understand that nothing can replace the time we could have spent together, please know that my absence was not out of neglect or disinterest in your celebration.\n\nI remember all the wonderful times we've shared over the years, and your friendship means the world to me. Your birthday is a day when I always look forward to celebrating your achievements and wishing you all the best for the coming year. Missing it was not a decision I took lightly, and I hope you can forgive me for not being there.\n\nTo make it up to you, I was thinking that maybe we could plan a small get-together or even just grab a drink when things settle down a bit. I owe you that, at the very least. Plus, I've got some stories from my recent missions that I know you'll find interesting.\n\nOnce again, I'm truly sorry for missing your birthday party. Please accept my heartfelt apologies, and know that you are one of the most important people in my life. Here's to many more birthdays and many more years of friendship!\n\nWith warm regards and a salute,\n\nSteve Rogers\nCaptain America\n\n---\n\n[Please remember that Captain America is a fictional character, and any representation here is for imaginative purposes only.]"
