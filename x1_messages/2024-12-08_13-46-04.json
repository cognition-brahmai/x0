        "content": "The author you're referring to is Mark Twain. He was a renowned American writer, humorist, entrepreneur, publisher, and lecturer. Born Samuel Langhorne Clemens on November 30, 1835, in Florida, Missouri, he is best known for his novels \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" (1876) and its sequel, \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" (1885), which has been called \"the Great American Novel.\"\n\nMark Twain's works are celebrated for their wit, satire, and deep understanding of human nature. He was a master of the literary style known as local color regionalism, which captures the dialects, manners, and customs of specific regions. His writing often reflects the culture and society of the American South before and after the Civil War.\n\nIn addition to his literary achievements, Twain was also an inventor, holding three patents, and he was involved in various business ventures, some of which ended in financial failure. He was known for his public lectures and his sharp criticism of imperialism, racism, and other social issues of his time.\n\nMark Twain passed away on April 21, 1910, but his legacy continues to influence literature and culture around the world. His works have been translated into numerous languages, and they remain widely read and studied in schools and universities."
