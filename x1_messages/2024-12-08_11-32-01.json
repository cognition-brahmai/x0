        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. To create a Python script that fetches weather data from a REST API and extracts specific information like temperature and humidity, we'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Choose a Weather API**: There are several weather APIs available, such as OpenWeatherMap, Weatherbit, or AccuWeather. For this example, I'll use OpenWeatherMap because it's widely used and has a free tier.\n\n2. **Sign Up for an API Key**: You'll need to sign up on the OpenWeatherMap website to get an API key, which is required to make requests to their API.\n\n3. **Install the Requests Library**: Python's `requests` library makes it easy to send HTTP requests. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n4. **Write the Python Script**: We'll write a script that takes a city name as input, makes a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, and extracts and displays the current temperature and humidity.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide with code snippets:\n\n### Step 1: Sign Up for OpenWeatherMap\n\n- Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).\n- Sign up for a free account.\n- Once registered, navigate to the API keys section to get your unique API key.\n\n### Step 2: Install the Requests Library\n\nMake sure you have the `requests` library installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install requests\n```\n\n### Step 3: Write the Python Script\n\nCreate a new Python script, e.g., `weather.py`, and add the following code:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(city, api_key):\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n    params = {\n        'q': city,\n        'appid': api_key,\n        'units': 'metric'  # Use 'imperial' for Fahrenheit\n    }\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    \n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        data = response.json()\n        temperature = data['main']['temp']\n        humidity = data['main']['humidity']\n        print(f\"Weather in {city}:\")\n        print(f\"Temperature: {temperature}\u00b0C\")\n        print(f\"Humidity: {humidity}%\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Error fetching weather data. Status code: {response.status_code}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    city = input(\"Enter city name: \")\n    api_key = 'your_api_key_here'  # Replace with your actual API key\n    get_weather(city, api_key)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Import the Requests Library**: We import the `requests` module to handle HTTP requests.\n\n2. **Define the `get_weather` Function**: This function takes a city name and an API key as parameters.\n   - It constructs the API URL and parameters.\n   - It sends a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API.\n   - If the response status code is 200 (OK), it parses the JSON data to extract the temperature and humidity and prints them.\n   - If there's an error, it prints the status code.\n\n3. **Main Block**: This block executes when the script is run directly.\n   - It prompts the user to enter a city name.\n   - It calls the `get_weather` function with the user-provided city name and your API key.\n\n### Notes:\n\n- **API Key Security**: In a real-world application, avoid hardcoding your API key in the script. Consider using environment variables or a configuration file.\n- **Error Handling**: This script handles basic error checking by checking the HTTP status code. You can expand this to handle other types of errors, such as network issues or invalid input.\n- **Units**: The `units` parameter in the API request is set to `'metric'` for Celsius. If you prefer Fahrenheit, set it to `'imperial'`.\n\nThat's it! Run your script, enter a city name, and you should see the current temperature and humidity for that city.
