        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. There are four houses in a row: blue, red, green, and yellow. The relationships between them are given in these statements:\n\n1. The blue house is to the right of the red house.\n\n2. The blue house is to the left of the green house.\n\n3. The yellow house is to the left of the red house.\n\nI need to determine the order of these houses from left to right based on these clues.\n\nFirst, let's consider the positions relative to each other.\n\nFrom statement 1: Blue is to the right of Red.\n\nSo, Red is to the left of Blue.\n\nFrom statement 2: Blue is to the left of Green.\n\nSo, Blue is before Green.\n\nFrom statement 3: Yellow is to the left of Red.\n\nSo, Yellow is before Red.\n\nLet me try to arrange them based on these relationships.\n\nStarting with Yellow, since it's to the left of Red, and Red is to the left of Blue, which is to the left of Green.\n\nSo, the order should be Yellow, Red, Blue, Green.\n\nLet me check if this satisfies all the conditions.\n\n- Yellow is to the left of Red: Yes, in this order.\n\n- Red is to the left of Blue: Yes.\n\n- Blue is to the left of Green: Yes.\n\nIt seems to fit all the given conditions.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider if there could be another possible order.\n\nSuppose I try to place the houses differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the positions as positions 1 to 4 from left to right.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Yellow is to the left of Red.\n\n- Red is to the left of Blue.\n\n- Blue is to the left of Green.\n\nSo, Yellow < Red < Blue < Green.\n\nThis seems straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the order from left to right is Yellow, Red, Blue, Green.\n\nI don't think there's another way to arrange them without violating one of the conditions.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are any other constraints or if I've misinterpreted the statements.\n\nLet me read the statements again.\n\n\"The blue house is to the right of the red house and to the left of the green house.\"\n\nSo, Red is to the left of Blue, and Blue is to the left of Green.\n\nAlso, \"The yellow house is to the left of the red house.\"\n\nSo, Yellow is to the left of Red.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is Yellow, Red, Blue, Green.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a overlapping or some other possibility, but given the linear arrangement from left to right, it seems clear.\n\nLet me see if I can place them in any other order.\n\nSuppose I try to place Red first, then Blue, then Green, and Yellow somewhere.\n\nBut according to the third statement, Yellow is to the left of Red, so Yellow has to be before Red.\n\nSo, Yellow must be the first house, followed by Red, then Blue, then Green.\n\nI don't see any other configuration that satisfies all the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the order from left to right is Yellow, Red, Blue, Green.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yellow, Red, Blue, Green}} \\]"
