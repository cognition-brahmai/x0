        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to calculate the compound interest on a $5000 investment over five years with an annual interest rate of 4%, and it's compounded quarterly. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the formula for compound interest. The general formula for the amount after compound interest is:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n- \\( P = 5000 \\) dollars\n\n- \\( r = 4\\% = 0.04 \\) (as a decimal)\n\n- \\( n = 4 \\) (since the interest is compounded quarterly)\n\n- \\( t = 5 \\) years\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.04}{4}\\right)^{4 \\times 5} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the rate per period:\n\n\\[ \\frac{0.04}{4} = 0.01 \\]\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1 + 0.01\\right)^{20} \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1.01\\right)^{20} \\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\( (1.01)^{20} \\). Let's do that step by step.\n\nCalculating \\( 1.01^1 = 1.01 \\)\n\n\\( 1.01^2 = 1.01 \\times 1.01 = 1.0201 \\)\n\n\\( 1.01^3 = 1.0201 \\times 1.01 = 1.030301 \\)\n\n\\( 1.01^4 = 1.030301 \\times 1.01 = 1.04060401 \\)\n\n\\( 1.01^5 = 1.04060401 \\times 1.01 = 1.0510100501 \\)\n\n\\( 1.01^{10} = (1.01^5)^2 = 1.0510100501^2 \\approx 1.10462212541 \\)\n\n\\( 1.01^{20} = (1.01^{10})^2 \\approx 1.10462212541^2 \\approx 1.22019003992 \\)\n\nSo, \\( A \\approx 5000 \\times 1.22019003992 \\approx 6100.9501996 \\)\n\nTherefore, the amount after 5 years is approximately $6100.95.\n\nNow, to find the compound interest earned, I need to subtract the principal from this amount:\n\n\\[ \\text{Compound Interest} = A - P = 6100.95 - 5000 = 1100.95 \\]\n\nSo, the compound interest earned is approximately $1100.95.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.04}{4}\\right)^{4 \\times 5} \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1 + 0.01\\right)^{20} \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1.01\\right)^{20} \\]\n\nCalculating \\( 1.01^{20} \\):\n\nI can use the formula for compound interest directly or use logarithms for more precision.\n\nUsing logarithms:\n\nLet \\( x = 1.01^{20} \\)\n\nThen, \\( \\ln(x) = 20 \\times \\ln(1.01) \\)\n\nUsing a calculator:\n\n\\( \\ln(1.01) \\approx 0.00995033 \\)\n\nSo, \\( \\ln(x) = 20 \\times 0.00995033 = 0.1990066 \\)\n\nThen, \\( x = e^{0.1990066} \\approx 1.22019 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( A = 5000 \\times 1.22019 = 6100.95 \\)\n\nAgain, \\( \\text{Compound Interest} = 6100.95 - 5000 = 1100.95 \\)\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest directly:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.04}{4}\\right)^{20} \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1.01\\right)^{20} \\]\n\nUsing a calculator for \\( (1.01)^{20} \\):\n\n\\( (1.01)^{20} \\approx 1.22019 \\)\n\nSo, \\( A = 5000 \\times 1.22019 = 6100.95 \\)\n\nAgain, \\( \\text{Compound Interest} = 6100.95 - 5000 = 1100.95 \\)\n\nAlternatively, I can use the compound interest formula to find the interest directly:\n\n\\[ \\text{Compound Interest} = P \\left( \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} - 1 \\right) \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Compound Interest} = 5000 \\left( (1 + 0.01)^{20} - 1 \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Compound Interest} = 5000 \\left( 1.22019 - 1 \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Compound Interest} = 5000 \\times 0.22019 = 1100.95 \\]\n\nSo, in all cases, the compound interest earned is $1100.95.\n\nWait, but I should check if there's a more accurate way to calculate this, maybe using more precise values or another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the amount step by step for each compounding period.\n\nStarting with \\( P = 5000 \\)\n\nInterest rate per quarter: \\( r/n = 0.04/4 = 0.01 \\)\n\nNumber of quarters: \\( n \\times t = 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\)\n\nSo, for each quarter, the amount is multiplied by \\( 1 + 0.01 = 1.01 \\)\n\nSo, after 20 quarters:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\times (1.01)^{20} \\]\n\nWe already calculated \\( (1.01)^{20} \\approx 1.22019 \\), so:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\times 1.22019 = 6100.95 \\]\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the amount quarter by quarter, but that would be time-consuming and should give the same result.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that the compound interest earned is $1100.95.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this calculation, such as different compounding methods or anything like that.\n\nIn this problem, it's clearly stated that the interest is compounded quarterly, so the formula we used is appropriate.\n\nAlso, the interest rate is given as an annual rate, and we've correctly adjusted it for the quarterly compounding by dividing by 4.\n\nAdditionally, the time period is 5 years, which is correctly converted to 20 quarters.\n\nTherefore, I don't think there's any mistake in the calculation.\n\nSo, the final answer is that the compound interest earned is $1100.95.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1100.95} \\]"
