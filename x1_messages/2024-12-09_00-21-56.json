        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a box containing red and blue balls. The probability of picking a red ball initially is 1/3. Then, we add 6 more red balls to the box, and the probability of picking a red ball becomes 1/2. We need to find out how many blue balls are in the box.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this clearer. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( r \\) be the initial number of red balls in the box.\n\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of blue balls in the box.\n\nWe\u2019re told that the probability of picking a red ball initially is 1/3. The probability of picking a red ball is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. So, we can write this as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r}{r + b} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nNext, we\u2019re told that if we add 6 more red balls to the box, the probability of picking a red ball becomes 1/2. So now, the number of red balls becomes \\( r + 6 \\), and the total number of balls becomes \\( r + b + 6 \\). The new probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r + 6}{r + b + 6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{r}{r + b} = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n\n2. \\(\\frac{r + 6}{r + b + 6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nOur goal is to solve for \\( b \\), the number of blue balls.\n\nLet\u2019s start by solving the first equation for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r}{r + b} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n3r = r + b\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( r \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2r = b\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( b = 2r \\). That\u2019s helpful.\n\nNow, let\u2019s plug this expression for \\( b \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r + 6}{r + b + 6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( b = 2r \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r + 6}{r + 2r + 6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r + 6}{3r + 6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, cross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n2(r + 6) = 3r + 6\n\\]\n\nExpand the left side:\n\n\\[\n2r + 12 = 3r + 6\n\\]\n\nNow, let\u2019s solve for \\( r \\). Subtract \\( 2r \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n12 = r + 6\n\\]\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n\n\\[\nr = 6\n\\]\n\nNow that we have \\( r = 6 \\), we can find \\( b \\) using \\( b = 2r \\):\n\n\\[\nb = 2 \\times 6 = 12\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 12 blue balls in the box.\n\nLet\u2019s double-check this to make sure it makes sense.\n\nInitially, with \\( r = 6 \\) and \\( b = 12 \\), the total number of balls is 18. The probability of picking a red ball is \\( \\frac{6}{18} = \\frac{1}{3} \\), which matches the first condition.\n\nAfter adding 6 red balls, the number of red balls becomes \\( 6 + 6 = 12 \\), and the total number of balls becomes \\( 18 + 6 = 24 \\). The probability of picking a red ball is now \\( \\frac{12}{24} = \\frac{1}{2} \\), which matches the second condition.\n\nEverything checks out, so the number of blue balls in the box is indeed 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
