        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we've got a box with 6 red balls and 4 blue balls, making a total of 10 balls. We're drawing 3 balls at random without replacement, and we want to find the probability that exactly 2 of them are red.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the formula for probability: it's the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the total number of possible ways to draw 3 balls out of 10 is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 and k = 3, so the total number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 10 is C(10, 3).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * (10 - 3)!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7!) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 7!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8) / (6) = 720 / 6 = 120.\n\nSo, there are 120 possible ways to draw 3 balls from 10.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to draw exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball.\n\nThere are 6 red balls and 4 blue balls.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 6 is C(6, 2), and the number of ways to choose 1 blue ball out of 4 is C(4, 1).\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is C(6, 2) \u00d7 C(4, 1).\n\nLet me calculate C(6, 2):\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6 - 2)!) = (6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 4!)) = (6 \u00d7 5) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.\n\nAnd C(4, 1) = 4! / (1! * (4 - 1)!) = (4 \u00d7 3!) / (1 \u00d7 3!)) = 4 / 1 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 15 \u00d7 4 = 60.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 60 / 120 = 0.5.\n\nSo, the probability is 0.5, or 50%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal ways to choose 3 balls from 10: C(10, 3) = 120. That seems correct.\n\nWays to choose 2 red balls from 6: C(6, 2) = 15. Correct.\n\nWays to choose 1 blue ball from 4: C(4, 1) = 4. Correct.\n\nFavorable outcomes: 15 \u00d7 4 = 60. Correct.\n\nProbability: 60 / 120 = 0.5. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it step by step, considering the draws one at a time without replacement.\n\nThe probability of drawing exactly 2 red balls out of 3 draws can happen in different sequences: red-red-blue, red-blue-red, or blue-red-red.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for each sequence and then add them up.\n\nFirst sequence: red-red-blue.\n\nProbability of first ball being red: 6/10.\n\nThen, second ball being red: 5/9 (since one red ball is already drawn).\n\nThird ball being blue: 4/8.\n\nSo, the probability for this sequence is (6/10) \u00d7 (5/9) \u00d7 (4/8).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n(6/10) = 0.6\n\n(5/9) \u2248 0.555...\n\n(4/8) = 0.5\n\nSo, 0.6 \u00d7 0.555... \u00d7 0.5 \u2248 0.1667.\n\nSimilarly, for the sequence red-blue-red:\n\nProbability: (6/10) \u00d7 (4/9) \u00d7 (5/8).\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n(6/10) = 0.6\n\n(4/9) \u2248 0.444...\n\n(5/8) = 0.625\n\nSo, 0.6 \u00d7 0.444... \u00d7 0.625 \u2248 0.1667.\n\nAnd for the sequence blue-red-red:\n\nProbability: (4/10) \u00d7 (6/9) \u00d7 (5/8).\n\nCalculating:\n\n(4/10) = 0.4\n\n(6/9) \u2248 0.666...\n\n(5/8) = 0.625\n\nSo, 0.4 \u00d7 0.666... \u00d7 0.625 \u2248 0.1667.\n\nNow, adding up the probabilities of these three sequences:\n\n0.1667 + 0.1667 + 0.1667 = 0.5.\n\nSo, again, we get the probability as 0.5 or 50%.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the binomial coefficient formula for hypergeometric distribution since we're sampling without replacement.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = [C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (10 balls).\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (6 red balls).\n\n- n is the number of draws (3 balls).\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (2 red balls).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 2) = [C(6, 2) * C(4, 1)] / C(10, 3) = (15 * 4) / 120 = 60 / 120 = 0.5.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I end up with a probability of 0.5.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing exactly 2 red balls out of 3 draws is 50%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.5} \\]"
