First, I need to handle the exponents and the operations inside the parentheses.\n\nStarting with the numerator: 4^2 * 3. 4 squared is 16, right? Because 4 times 4 is 16. Then, multiply that by 3, so 16 * 3 is 48.\n\nNow, the denominator: (8 - 5)^2. 8 minus 5 is 3, and 3 squared is 9.\n\nSo, the whole expression is 48 divided by 9. That simplifies to approximately 5.333..., or more precisely, 16/3 when expressed as a fraction.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. 48 divided by 9 is indeed 5.333..., but as a fraction, it's 48/9, which can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3, giving 16/3. Yep, that sounds correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 16/3 or approximately 5.333.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{16}{3}} \\]"
