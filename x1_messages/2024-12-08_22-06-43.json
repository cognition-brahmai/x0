        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train that goes from Town A to Town B at 60 mph and then comes back at 90 mph. We need to find the average speed for the whole trip.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, if I can find the total distance and the total time, I can calculate the average speed.\n\nLet's assume the distance between Town A and Town B is \\( d \\) miles. That means the total distance for the round trip is \\( 2d \\) miles.\n\nNow, for the trip from Town A to Town B at 60 mph, the time taken would be \\( \\frac{d}{60} \\) hours.\n\nFor the return trip from Town B to Town A at 90 mph, the time taken would be \\( \\frac{d}{90} \\) hours.\n\nSo, the total time for the round trip is \\( \\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{d}{90} \\) hours.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 90 is 180. So, \\( \\frac{d}{60} = \\frac{3d}{180} \\) and \\( \\frac{d}{90} = \\frac{2d}{180} \\). Adding them up gives \\( \\frac{5d}{180} = \\frac{d}{36} \\) hours.\n\nNow, the average speed is total distance divided by total time, which is \\( \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{36}} = 2d \\times \\frac{36}{d} = 72 \\) mph.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of a formula for average speed when the distances are equal but speeds are different. It's the harmonic mean, I think. The formula is \\( \\text{average speed} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{speed}_1 \\times \\text{speed}_2}{\\text{speed}_1 + \\text{speed}_2} \\).\n\nPlugging in the values: \\( \\text{average speed} = \\frac{2 \\times 60 \\times 90}{60 + 90} = \\frac{2 \\times 5400}{150} = \\frac{10800}{150} = 72 \\) mph.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer. So, the average speed for the entire round trip is 72 mph.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the distances were different or if the times were different. However, in this case, since the distances are equal, the harmonic mean formula is appropriate.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. **72 mph**\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72 \\text{ mph}} \\]"
