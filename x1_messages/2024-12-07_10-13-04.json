        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're looking for three consecutive odd integers that add up to 99. First, I need to understand what consecutive odd integers are. Odd integers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on\u2014numbers that aren't divisible by 2. Consecutive odd integers mean that each number is 2 more than the previous one. For example, 1, 3, 5 are consecutive odd integers.\n\nNow, let's denote the first odd integer as x. Since they are consecutive odd integers, the next one would be x + 2, and the one after that would be x + 4. So, the three integers are x, x + 2, and x + 4.\n\nThe problem says that the sum of these three integers is 99. So, I can set up an equation:\n\nx + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 99\n\nNow, let's simplify this equation. First, combine like terms:\n\nx + x + x + 2 + 4 = 99\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n3x + 6 = 99\n\nNext, I need to isolate x. I'll start by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:\n\n3x + 6 - 6 = 99 - 6\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n3x = 93\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:\n\n3x / 3 = 93 / 3\n\nSo, x = 31\n\nNow that I have x, which is the first integer, I can find the other two:\n\nx + 2 = 31 + 2 = 33\n\nx + 4 = 31 + 4 = 35\n\nSo, the three consecutive odd integers are 31, 33, and 35.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure this is correct. Add them up: 31 + 33 + 35 = 99. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have approached this problem by considering that the sum of three consecutive odd integers can also be thought of as three times the middle integer. Because in a set of three consecutive odd integers, the middle one is the average.\n\nSo, if 3 times the middle integer equals 99, then the middle integer is 99 / 3 = 33.\n\nThen, the integers would be 33 - 2 = 31, 33, and 33 + 2 = 35.\n\nAgain, that gives me the same result: 31, 33, and 35.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, but since there are only three terms and they are equally spaced, the methods above suffice.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The answer should be 31, 33, and 35.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{31, 33, 35} \\]"
