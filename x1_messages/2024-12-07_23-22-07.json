Each step in your plan should correspond to an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user's query, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools you have at your disposal:\nBing[input]: This tool allows the user to search for information on Bing. It provides a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts plain text from web pages given one or more links as input.\nLinkFinder[input]: Extracts links from plain text and returns them as a newline-separated list.\nQAEngine[input]: A question-answering model that answers questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nEach function takes a plain string as input without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., QAEngine[What is the capital of France, given :evidence3:?]\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nPlan: [first action]\n:evidence0: = [function call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function call and input parameter, possibly referring to previous evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What are some of the most popular dishes in Vietnamese cuisine?"
