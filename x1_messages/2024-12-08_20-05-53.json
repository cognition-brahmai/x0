First, I need to calculate the exponent, then do the subtraction and addition inside the parentheses, and finally multiplication and division.\n\nSo, starting with the exponent: 3^2 is 9. So now the expression is (9 - 4) * (5 + 7) / 2.\n\nNext, subtraction and addition inside the parentheses. 9 - 4 is 5, and 5 + 7 is 12. So now it's 5 * 12 / 2.\n\nNow, multiplication and division from left to right. 5 * 12 is 60, and 60 / 2 is 30.\n\nSo, the final answer is 30."
