        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you write a Go program that reads a CSV file and prints out the total number of rows and columns in that file. Sounds straightforward, right? Let's break it down into simple steps.\n\nFirst, you need to make sure you have Go installed on your machine. If you don't, you can download it from golang.org. Once you have Go set up, you can create a new file with a `.go` extension, like `main.go`.\n\nNow, in Go, to handle CSV files, we can use the `encoding/csv` package, which is part of the standard library. So, we'll need to import that, along with a few others that we'll use for file handling and printing output.\n\nHere's a rough outline of what our program needs to do:\n\n1. Open the CSV file.\n2. Read the contents of the file using the CSV reader.\n3. Count the number of rows and the number of columns in each row.\n4. Print the total number of rows and the number of columns.\n\nLet's start by setting up the basic structure of the program.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Go program that reads a CSV file and prints the total number of rows and columns, follow these steps:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Open the CSV File:** Use Go's `os` package to open the file.\n2. **Read the CSV File:** Use the `encoding/csv` package to read the CSV data.\n3. **Count Rows and Columns:** Iterate through the records to count the number of rows and columns.\n4. **Print the Results:** Output the total number of rows and columns.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"encoding/csv\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"os\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Open the CSV file\n\tfile, err := os.Open(\"data.csv\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error opening file:\", err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\tdefer file.Close()\n\n\t// Create a new CSV reader\n\treader := csv.NewReader(file)\n\n\t// Read all records from the CSV file\n\trecords, err := reader.ReadAll()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error reading file:\", err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\t// Get the total number of rows\n\ttotalRows := len(records)\n\tif totalRows == 0 {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"No data in the CSV file.\")\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\t// Assuming all rows have the same number of columns, get the number of columns from the first row\n\ttotalColumns := len(records[0])\n\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Total rows: %d\\n\", totalRows)\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Total columns: %d\\n\", totalColumns)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Open the CSV File:**\n   - Use `os.Open` to open the file named \"data.csv\". Handle any errors that occur during file opening.\n   - Defer the file closing to ensure it's closed even if an error occurs.\n\n2. **Read the CSV File:**\n   - Create a CSV reader using `csv.NewReader` and pass the file.\n   - Read all records from the CSV file using `reader.ReadAll()`. Handle any errors that occur during reading.\n\n3. **Count Rows and Columns:**\n   - Determine the total number of rows by getting the length of the records slice.\n   - Assume all rows have the same number of columns and determine the number of columns by getting the length of the first row.\n\n4. **Print the Results:**\n   - Print the total number of rows and columns using `fmt.Printf`.\n\nThis program provides a simple way to get the dimensions of a CSV file, assuming that all rows have the same number of columns. If the CSV file has rows with varying numbers of columns, additional logic would be needed to handle that scenario."
