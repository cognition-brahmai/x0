        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a city with 240,000 people. According to the information:\n\n- 60% of the population owns a car.\n\n- 30% uses public transportation.\n\nWe need to find out how many people use neither cars nor public transportation.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many people own cars and how many use public transportation.\n\nLet's calculate the number of car owners:\n\n60% of 240,000 is:\n\n\\( 0.60 \\times 240,000 = 144,000 \\) people own cars.\n\nNext, the number of people who use public transportation:\n\n30% of 240,000 is:\n\n\\( 0.30 \\times 240,000 = 72,000 \\) people use public transportation.\n\nNow, if I add these two numbers together:\n\n144,000 (car owners) + 72,000 (public transportation users) = 216,000 people.\n\nBut wait, is it possible that some people both own cars and use public transportation? The problem doesn't specify if these groups overlap. If some people are in both groups, then adding them directly would count those people twice.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't provide information about overlap, so maybe it's safe to assume that these are distinct groups. But in reality, it's possible for someone to own a car and still use public transportation.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the assumption that these groups are mutually exclusive unless stated otherwise.\n\nSo, if 216,000 people are either car owners or public transportation users, then the number of people who use neither would be the total population minus this number.\n\nTotal population: 240,000\n\nMinus those who own cars or use public transportation: 216,000\n\nSo, 240,000 - 216,000 = 24,000 people.\n\nTherefore, 24,000 people use neither cars nor public transportation.\n\nBut let me double-check this. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of percentages.\n\nTotal population: 100%\n\nCar owners: 60%\n\nPublic transportation users: 30%\n\nIf these groups don't overlap, then the percentage of people who use either cars or public transportation is 60% + 30% = 90%.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of people who use neither is 100% - 90% = 10%.\n\nApplying this to the total population:\n\n10% of 240,000 is:\n\n\\( 0.10 \\times 240,000 = 24,000 \\) people.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut again, I need to consider if there's any overlap between car owners and public transportation users. If there is an overlap, say x% of the population both owns a car and uses public transportation, then the formula would be:\n\nTotal = Car owners + Public transportation users - Both + Neither.\n\nSo, 100% = 60% + 30% - x% + Neither%.\n\nTherefore, Neither% = 100% - 60% - 30% + x% = 10% + x%.\n\nIf x% is greater than zero, then the percentage of people who use neither would be more than 10%.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify any overlap, it's reasonable to assume that x% is zero, leading to 10% using neither.\n\nThus, 24,000 people use neither cars nor public transportation.\n\nI think this is the correct answer based on the information provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24000} \\]"
