However, it has a significantly different atmosphere, which is much thicker than Earth's and consists mainly of carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric acid. This dense atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect, making Venus the hottest planet in our solar system, with surface temperatures that can melt lead."
