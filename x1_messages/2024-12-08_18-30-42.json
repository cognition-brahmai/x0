        "content": "To convert gallons to liters, I need to know the conversion factor. I think 1 gallon is approximately 3.785 liters. So, for 8 gallons, I would multiply 8 by 3.785. Let me do the math: 8 times 3.785 is... 8 times 3 is 24, 8 times 0.7 is 5.6, and 8 times 0.085 is 0.68. Adding those up: 24 plus 5.6 is 29.6, plus 0.68 makes 30.28 liters. So, the container holds about 30.28 liters.\n\nWait a minute, I should check if that conversion factor is accurate. I might be thinking of US gallons, but there are also imperial gallons. Let me confirm which one we're dealing with here. The problem just says \"gallons,\" without specifying. Maybe I should look up the exact conversion rate for both.\n\nOkay, I'm looking it up now. According to my research, 1 US gallon is approximately 3.78541 liters, while 1 imperial gallon is about 4.54609 liters. That's a notable difference. So, I need to figure out which type of gallon is being used in this problem.\n\nThe problem mentions that the container holds 8 gallons of water. It doesn't specify whether it's US gallons or imperial gallons. Maybe there's a way to infer it based on the context, like the location or other clues, but in this case, there are no additional details provided.\n\nPerhaps I should assume it's US gallons, as the US is more commonly associated with gallons in general. But to be precise, I should note that the conversion depends on the type of gallon.\n\nLet me consider both possibilities. If it's US gallons, then 8 gallons would be 8 times 3.78541 liters, which equals approximately 30.28328 liters. Rounded to two decimal places, that's about 30.28 liters.\n\nIf it's imperial gallons, then 8 gallons would be 8 times 4.54609 liters, which equals approximately 36.36872 liters, or about 36.37 liters.\n\nGiven that the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should provide both conversions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to determine the type of gallon based on the container's capacity. For example, if the container holds 8 gallons, and it's a standard container, it might be using US gallons.\n\nLet me think about standard container sizes. In the US, milk is often sold in gallons, and that's US gallons. But this is just a general assumption; without specific context, I can't be sure.\n\nMaybe I should look for clues in the way the question is phrased. The problem says, \"A container holds 8 gallons of water. How many liters does it hold?\" There's no indication of location or specific gallon type.\n\nIn such cases, it's common to assume US gallons unless specified otherwise, especially in problems that don't provide additional context.\n\nTherefore, I'll proceed with the US gallon conversion.\n\nSo, 8 US gallons times 3.78541 liters per gallon equals approximately 30.28328 liters.\n\nRounding to a reasonable precision, say two decimal places, that's 30.28 liters.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider the precision of the original measurement. The problem states \"8 gallons,\" which is a whole number with no decimal places. Assuming that implies one significant figure, the answer should also be reported with one significant figure, which would be 30 liters.\n\nHowever, considering that 8 has one significant figure but in measurements, it's often assumed to have more precision, especially if it's a precise volume like 8 gallons.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a more precise answer, given that liters are a metric unit and gallons are imperial, so a direct conversion might require more decimal places for accuracy.\n\nBut to avoid overcomplicating things, I'll stick with two decimal places, giving 30.28 liters as the answer.\n\nWait, but I should also consider the precision of the conversion factor. The conversion factor from US gallons to liters is exactly 3.785411784 liters per gallon, but using 3.78541 is sufficiently accurate for most purposes.\n\nGiven that, my calculation of 30.28328 liters is accurate, and rounding to two decimal places, 30.28 liters is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the answer in terms of cubic decimeters, since 1 liter is equal to 1 cubic decimeter, the answer would be the same: 30.28 cubic decimeters.\n\nBut since the question asks for liters, I'll stick with liters.\n\nSo, the container holds approximately 30.28 liters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30.28 \\text{ liters}} \\]"
