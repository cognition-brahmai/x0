        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two types of pens: blue ink pens that cost $1.50 each and black ink pens that cost $2.00 each. The customer buys a total of 10 pens and spends exactly $18.00. We need to find out how many of each type of pen they purchased.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) represent the number of blue ink pens.\n\n- Let \\( k \\) represent the number of black ink pens.\n\nWe know two things:\n\n1. The total number of pens is 10.\n\n2. The total cost is $18.00.\n\nSo, we can set up two equations based on this information.\n\nThe first equation will represent the total number of pens:\n\n\\[ b + k = 10 \\]\n\nThe second equation will represent the total cost:\n\n\\[ 1.50b + 2.00k = 18.00 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. I'll use the substitution method here.\n\nFirst, solve the first equation for one of the variables. Let's solve for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ b = 10 - k \\]\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( b \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 1.50(10 - k) + 2.00k = 18.00 \\]\n\nNext, distribute the 1.50:\n\n\\[ 15.00 - 1.50k + 2.00k = 18.00 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 15.00 + 0.50k = 18.00 \\]\n\nNow, subtract 15.00 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.50k = 3.00 \\]\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 0.50 to solve for \\( k \\):\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{3.00}{0.50} = 6 \\]\n\nSo, the customer bought 6 black ink pens.\n\nNow, substitute this value back into the equation \\( b = 10 - k \\) to find \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ b = 10 - 6 = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer purchased 4 blue ink pens and 6 black ink pens.\n\nTo double-check, let's calculate the total cost:\n\n- 4 blue ink pens at $1.50 each: \\( 4 \\times 1.50 = 6.00 \\)\n\n- 6 black ink pens at $2.00 each: \\( 6 \\times 2.00 = 12.00 \\)\n\n- Total: \\( 6.00 + 12.00 = 18.00 \\)\n\nIt matches the given total cost. Also, the total number of pens is \\( 4 + 6 = 10 \\), which matches the given information.\n\nSo, the final answer is 4 blue ink pens and 6 black ink pens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ blue ink pens and } 6 \\text{ black ink pens}} \\]"
