It's the fourth-largest island in the world and is known for its unique biodiversity and endemic species. The population of Madagascar is concentrated mainly on the island, with a small percentage living on surrounding smaller islands. However, if there's another African country with a majority of its population living on Madagascar, I might not be aware of it. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question?"
