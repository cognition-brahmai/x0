Is it Williamsburg? No, Williamsburg is in Virginia, and it does have historic sites like Colonial Williamsburg, and there are universities there too, like College of William & Mary. And I believe it's named after King William III and Queen Mary II, who were British monarchs. So, I think the answer is Williamsburg."
