        "content": "Hispaniola is shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic. The island was originally inhabited by the Ta\u00edno people before Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492, claiming it for Spain. The island was named La Isla Espa\u00f1ola, which later evolved into Hispaniola. The western third of the island was ceded to France in 1697, and it became the French colony of Saint-Domingue, while the eastern two-thirds remained under Spanish control as Santo Domingo. In 1804, Saint-Domingue gained independence as Haiti, while Santo Domingo remained a Spanish colony until it gained its independence in 1844, becoming the Dominican Republic. The two countries have had a complex and often tense relationship throughout their histories, with issues such as border disputes, migration, and economic disparities contributing to their sometimes strained relations."
