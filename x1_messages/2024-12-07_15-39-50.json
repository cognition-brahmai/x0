        "content": "Let's see... the riddle says, \"I am something that brings health benefits through movement and stillness alike. I originate from the East but now practiced worldwide. What am I?\" Hmm, it sounds like it's something related to exercise or maybe a type of meditation. The fact that it brings health benefits through both movement and stillness suggests that it's a practice that combines these elements.\n\nOriginating from the East and now practiced worldwide narrows it down even more. Could it be yoga? Yoga involves both movement in the form of poses and stillness in meditation and breathing exercises. It's known for its health benefits and has its roots in ancient Indian practices. Yeah, that seems to fit.\n\nAlternatively, it could be Tai Chi, which is another Eastern practice that combines slow movements with mindfulness and breath control. But Tai Chi is more specific to China, while yoga has a broader influence from India.\n\nWait, but the riddle says \"movement and stillness alike,\" and yoga definitely encompasses both of those aspects. There are dynamic yoga styles like Vinyasa that involve flowing movements, and there are also more static practices like Yin yoga, where you hold poses for longer periods. Plus, yoga often includes meditation and breathing exercises that involve stillness.\n\nAlso, the origin from the East matches, as yoga has its roots in ancient Indian philosophy and practices. Now, it's practiced all over the world for its physical, mental, and spiritual benefits.\n\nIs there any other practice that fits this description? Maybe martial arts, but while martial arts do originate from the East and involve movement, they might not emphasize stillness as much as yoga does. Meditation is part of some martial arts, but it's not as central as it is in yoga.\n\nAnother option could be Qigong, which is also an Eastern practice that combines movement and stillness with breathing techniques and meditation. However, yoga seems more prominent globally, but Qigong is also practiced worldwide.\n\nBut considering the combination of movement and stillness, health benefits, and Eastern origins, yoga seems to be the most fitting answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{yoga}} \\]"
