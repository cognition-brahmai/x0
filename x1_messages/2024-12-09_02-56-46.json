        "content": "So I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's asking. The city has a population of 1 million people. Out of these, 60% own cars. That means 600,000 people own cars, right? Because 60% of 1,000,000 is 600,000.\n\nNow, 25% of car owners also own bicycles. So, out of the 600,000 car owners, 25% of them have bicycles too. Let's calculate that: 25% of 600,000 is 150,000. So, 150,000 people own both cars and bicycles.\n\nBut the question is asking for the number of people who do not own either a car or a bicycle. So, I need to find out how many people don't own cars and don't own bicycles.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many people own cars or bicycles or both. To do that, I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe formula for the number of people who own cars or bicycles is:\n\nNumber of car owners + Number of bicycle owners - Number of people who own both cars and bicycles.\n\nBut wait, I don't know the total number of bicycle owners. The problem only tells me that 25% of car owners also own bicycles. It doesn't say anything about people who own only bicycles.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to assume that the only bicycle owners are those who also own cars. But that doesn't make sense because there could be people who own only bicycles and not cars.\n\nThe problem doesn't provide any information about people who own only bicycles. It only says that 25% of car owners also own bicycles, but it doesn't specify anything about bicycle ownership independent of car ownership.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the 25% of car owners who own bicycles are the only ones who own bicycles. In other words, there are no people who own only bicycles. If that's the case, then the total number of bicycle owners is 150,000, which are those who own both cars and bicycles.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption. The problem doesn't explicitly state that there are no people who own only bicycles. So, perhaps I should consider that there might be people who own only bicycles, but since there's no information about them, I might have to find another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem implies that only car owners can own bicycles, meaning there are no bicycle owners who don't own cars. If that's the case, then the total number of bicycle owners is indeed 150,000, who also own cars.\n\nBut again, that's assuming that no one owns only a bicycle, which isn't explicitly stated. I need to be careful here.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I should consider the total number of people who own cars, and separately consider those who own bicycles, but since I don't know the latter, perhaps there's another way.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can think in terms of sets. Let's denote:\n\n- Total population: 1,000,000\n\n- Car owners: 60% of 1,000,000 = 600,000\n\n- People who own both cars and bicycles: 25% of car owners = 150,000\n\nNow, if I want to find the number of people who own either cars or bicycles or both, I need to know the number of people who own only cars, plus those who own only bicycles, plus those who own both.\n\nBut I don't know the number of people who own only bicycles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the number of people who own cars or bicycles or both, and then subtract that from the total population to find those who own neither.\n\nBut to find the number of people who own cars or bicycles or both, I need:\n\nNumber of car owners + Number of bicycle owners - Number of people who own both.\n\nI know the number of car owners (600,000) and the number of people who own both (150,000), but I don't know the total number of bicycle owners.\n\nThis is problematic. Perhaps there's a different way to approach this.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider that the only bicycle owners are those who also own cars. In other words, assume that no one owns only a bicycle. If that's the case, then the total number of bicycle owners is 150,000.\n\nThen, the number of people who own cars or bicycles or both would be:\n\nNumber of car owners + Number of bicycle owners - Number of people who own both = 600,000 + 150,000 - 150,000 = 600,000.\n\nSo, in this case, the number of people who own either cars or bicycles or both is 600,000.\n\nThen, the number of people who own neither would be the total population minus those who own cars or bicycles or both: 1,000,000 - 600,000 = 400,000.\n\nBut is this a valid assumption? The problem states that 25% of car owners also own bicycles, but it doesn't say anything about people who might own only bicycles. So, perhaps there are people who own only bicycles, and I'm excluding them by assuming that only car owners can own bicycles.\n\nIf there are people who own only bicycles, then the number of people who own bicycles would be greater than 150,000, and consequently, the number of people who own neither would be less than 400,000.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't provide information about people who own only bicycles, perhaps it's safe to assume that only car owners can own bicycles. Alternatively, maybe the problem implies that bicycle ownership is subset of car ownership.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the 25% of car owners who own bicycles are in addition to those who own only bicycles.\n\nBut without additional information, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem differently. Let me consider the percentages.\n\n60% own cars, and 25% of car owners own bicycles. So, 25% of 60% own both cars and bicycles.\n\nLet me calculate that: 25% of 60% is 15% of the total population. So, 15% own both cars and bicycles.\n\nNow, the number of people who own only cars would be the number who own cars minus those who own both, which is 60% - 15% = 45% of the total population.\n\nAnd the number of people who own only bicycles would be the total bicycle owners minus those who own both. But I don't know the total bicycle owners.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem means that only car owners can own bicycles, meaning there are no bicycle owners who don't own cars. If that's the case, then the total bicycle owners are just the 15% who own both.\n\nIn that case, the number of people who own either cars or bicycles or both would be the number who own only cars plus the number who own both, which is 45% + 15% = 60% of the total population.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who own neither would be 100% - 60% = 40% of the total population, which is 400,000 people.\n\nBut again, this assumes that there are no bicycle owners who don't own cars, which may not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, if there are people who own only bicycles, then the number of people who own bicycles would be greater than 15%, and consequently, the number of people who own neither would be less than 400,000.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't provide information about people who own only bicycles, perhaps it's intended to assume that only car owners can own bicycles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider that bicycle ownership is independent of car ownership, but that seems unlikely given the information provided.\n\nI'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should try to think about it in terms of Venn diagrams.\n\nLet's imagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents car owners, and the other represents bicycle owners.\n\nThe overlapping area represents people who own both cars and bicycles.\n\nAccording to the problem, 60% own cars, and 25% of car owners own bicycles, which is 15% of the total population.\n\nSo, the overlapping area is 15% of the total population.\n\nNow, the car owners only would be 60% - 15% = 45% of the total population.\n\nThe bicycle owners only would be the total bicycle owners minus the 15% who own both.\n\nBut again, I don't know the total bicycle owners.\n\nIf I assume that there are no bicycle owners who don't own cars, then the bicycle only owners are zero, and the total bicycle owners are just the 15% who own both.\n\nIn that case, the total number of people who own cars or bicycles or both would be 45% (car only) + 15% (both) = 60%, and the number who own neither would be 40%, which is 400,000 people.\n\nBut I'm still unsure if this is the correct approach because the problem doesn't explicitly state that only car owners can own bicycles.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that there could be bicycle owners who don't own cars, then the number of bicycle owners would be greater than 15%, and the number of people who own neither would be less than 400,000.\n\nHowever, without information about the number of people who own only bicycles, I can't determine the exact number.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects me to assume that only car owners can own bicycles, or that bicycle ownership is subset of car ownership.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to interpret the given information.\n\nLet me try to look at it again.\n\nThe problem says: \"60% own cars, and 25% of car owners also own bicycles.\"\n\nIt doesn't say anything about people who own only bicycles.\n\nSo, perhaps it's safe to assume that the only bicycle owners are those who also own cars.\n\nIf that's the case, then the total number of bicycle owners is 15% of the population, and the number of people who own cars or bicycles or both is 60% (car owners) since bicycle owners are already included in car owners.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who own neither would be 40% of the population, which is 400,000 people.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident about this assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the 25% of car owners who own bicycles are in addition to those who own only bicycles.\n\nBut that would require assuming that there are people who own only bicycles, which isn't supported by the problem statement.\n\nThe problem only mentions that 25% of car owners also own bicycles, but it doesn't provide any information about people who own only bicycles.\n\nGiven the lack of information, perhaps the safest assumption is that only car owners can own bicycles, leading to the conclusion that 400,000 people own neither.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to solving this problem.\n\nLet me try to use algebra to represent the situation.\n\nLet:\n\n- Total population, P = 1,000,000\n\n- Percentage owning cars, C = 60%\n\n- Percentage of car owners who also own bicycles, B_C = 25%\n\nNumber of car owners, N_C = C * P = 0.60 * 1,000,000 = 600,000\n\nNumber of people who own both cars and bicycles, N_B_and_C = B_C * N_C = 0.25 * 600,000 = 150,000\n\nLet the number of people who own only bicycles be N_B_only.\n\nThen, the total number of bicycle owners, N_B = N_B_only + N_B_and_C = N_B_only + 150,000\n\nThe number of people who own cars or bicycles or both is:\n\nN_C + N_B - N_B_and_C = 600,000 + (N_B_only + 150,000) - 150,000 = 600,000 + N_B_only\n\nThen, the number of people who own neither is:\n\nP - (N_C + N_B - N_B_and_C) = 1,000,000 - (600,000 + N_B_only) = 400,000 - N_B_only\n\nBut without knowing N_B_only, I can't determine the exact number of people who own neither.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't provide information about N_B_only, perhaps it's intended to be zero, meaning that only car owners can own bicycles.\n\nIn that case, N_B_only = 0, and the number of people who own neither is 400,000 - 0 = 400,000.\n\nAlternatively, if there are people who own only bicycles, then the number of people who own neither would be less than 400,000.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the answer is 400,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe I can think in terms of maximum and minimum possible values.\n\nThe minimum number of bicycle owners is 150,000 (those who own both), and the maximum is unlimited, but in practical terms, it can't exceed the total population.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't provide constraints on the number of bicycle owners, perhaps the only logical conclusion is that 400,000 people own neither, assuming no one owns only a bicycle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that bicycle ownership is independent of car ownership, but that seems unlikely given the information provided.\n\nI'm going to make an educated guess and say that the number of people who own neither is 400,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400000} \\]"
