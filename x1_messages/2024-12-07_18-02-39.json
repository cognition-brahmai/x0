        "content": "Let's see. If a company produces 500 units every day and sells each unit for $10, I need to find out their total revenue after 30 days.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many units they produce in 30 days. Since they produce 500 units per day, I can multiply that by 30 to get the total production over 30 days.\n\nSo, 500 units/day \u00d7 30 days = 15,000 units.\n\nNext, since each unit is sold for $10, I can find the total revenue by multiplying the total number of units sold by the price per unit.\n\nTherefore, 15,000 units \u00d7 $10/unit = $150,000.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Are there any costs involved, or is this just straight revenue from sales?\n\nThe question asks for total revenue, not profit, so I don't need to subtract costs. Revenue is simply the income from sales.\n\nSo, their total revenue after 30 days would be $150,000.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check my calculations.\n\n500 units/day \u00d7 30 days = 15,000 units.\n\n15,000 units \u00d7 $10/unit = $150,000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as daily revenue and then multiply by 30.\n\nDaily revenue: 500 units \u00d7 $10/unit = $5,000.\n\nThen, $5,000/day \u00d7 30 days = $150,000.\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think $150,000 is the correct total revenue after 30 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150000} \\]"
