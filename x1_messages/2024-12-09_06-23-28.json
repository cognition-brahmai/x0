        "content": "So the zoo wants to expand and they need to figure out how much more land to buy. Let's see what they've got so far.\n\nThey currently have 50 acres for 300 animals from 50 different species, and on average, each species gets 1 acre. That makes sense because 50 species times 1 acre each equals 50 acres.\n\nNow, they plan to add 20 new species, and each of these new species will have an average of 10 animals. So, that's 20 species times 10 animals, which is 200 new animals.\n\nBut here's the thing: each species requires an average of 1 acre for their habitat. So, for the new 20 species, it should be 20 species times 1 acre each, which is 20 acres.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says that some species may need more space than others due to their size or environmental needs. So, maybe just using the average isn't enough. Perhaps I should consider that some species might need more than 1 acre.\n\nBut according to the information given, the average is 1 acre per species, and they want to add 20 new species. So, if they stick to the average, they would need 20 acres.\n\nHowever, since some species might need more space, maybe they should consider a buffer or plan for a bit more land to account for variations in space requirements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the total number of animals they will have after the expansion and recalculate the land needed based on the total number of species.\n\nLet me think differently. Currently, they have 50 species on 50 acres. They're adding 20 species, so that's 70 species in total.\n\nIf each species still needs an average of 1 acre, then they would need 70 acres in total. Since they already have 50 acres, they would need an additional 20 acres.\n\nBut the question mentions that some species may need more space due to size or environmental needs. So perhaps there's a need to consider that not all species are equal in terms of space requirements.\n\nMaybe I should look at the number of animals per species. Currently, they have 300 animals across 50 species, which is an average of 6 animals per species.\n\nNow, the new species will have an average of 10 animals per species, which is more than the current average.\n\nSo, perhaps the space requirement per species should consider the number of animals.\n\nWait, but the initial information says each species requires an average of 1 acre, regardless of the number of animals.\n\nIs that the case? Or does the space per species depend on the number of animals?\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me check. It says \"each species requires an average of 1 acre for their habitat.\"\n\nSo, it's per species, not per animal.\n\nTherefore, for 20 new species, it should be 20 acres.\n\nBut, as mentioned earlier, some species may need more space due to their size or environmental needs.\n\nSo, perhaps I should suggest that they need at least 20 acres, but possibly more depending on the specific species they plan to add.\n\nMaybe I should look into how much extra space some species might need.\n\nFor example, if they're adding large mammals like elephants or giraffes, those would require more space than, say, small birds or rodents.\n\nSo, perhaps I should consider a higher average acreage per species for the new additions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate based on the number of animals.\n\nIf the new species have an average of 10 animals each, and the current average is 6 animals per species with 1 acre per species, then perhaps the space per animal is about 1/6 acre per animal.\n\nBut wait, that might not be directly applicable, because the space is allocated per species, not per animal.\n\nMeaning, regardless of the number of animals, each species gets 1 acre.\n\nSo, even if a species has more animals, they still get 1 acre.\n\nBut that seems a bit off, because more animals would likely require more space.\n\nMaybe the average of 1 acre per species is already taking into account the number of animals per species.\n\nIn that case, with the new species having more animals on average, maybe they need more space per species.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zoo has been allocating space based on species-specific needs, and the average is just 1 acre per species.\n\nIn that case, adding 20 new species would require an additional 20 acres.\n\nBut, since some species may need more space, perhaps they should allocate more than 1 acre per new species.\n\nMaybe they should allocate an average of 1.5 acres per new species to account for the higher number of animals or special needs.\n\nSo, 20 species times 1.5 acres would be 30 acres.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they should stick to the average of 1 acre per species, which would be 20 acres.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps they should get a bit more to account for any species that need extra space.\n\nSo, maybe 25 acres.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at the total number of animals after expansion.\n\nCurrently, they have 300 animals. Adding 200 new animals brings the total to 500 animals.\n\nIf they have 70 species in total, and they currently have 50 acres for 300 animals, that's 0.166 acres per animal.\n\nBut again, since space is allocated per species, not per animal, this might not be directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of density: how many animals per acre.\n\nCurrently, they have 300 animals on 50 acres, which is 6 animals per acre.\n\nAfter adding 200 animals and 20 species, assuming they get 1 acre each, that's an additional 20 acres for 200 animals, which is 10 animals per acre.\n\nWait, but each new species is getting 1 acre for 10 animals, which is 10 animals per acre.\n\nMeanwhile, the existing setup is 6 animals per acre.\n\nSo, the new additions would have a higher density than the existing exhibits.\n\nBut the question mentions that some species may need more space due to their size or environmental needs.\n\nSo, perhaps the new species require more space than the average 1 acre.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zoo wants to maintain a similar density to what they have now.\n\nWait, their current density is 6 animals per acre.\n\nIf they add 200 animals on 20 acres, that's 10 animals per acre, which is higher density.\n\nSo, perhaps they need to allocate more acres to maintain a similar density.\n\nIf they want to maintain 6 animals per acre for the new additions, then for 200 new animals, they would need 200 divided by 6, which is about 33.33 acres.\n\nSo, that's more than the initial 20 acres based on 1 acre per species.\n\nAlternatively, if they allocate 1 acre per species, and some species need more space, they might have to allocate extra acres for those specific species.\n\nBut without specific information on which species need more space, it's hard to give an exact number.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to calculate based on the average space per species and then add a buffer for variations.\n\nSo, 20 species times 1 acre is 20 acres, plus maybe an additional 10 acres to account for species that need more space.\n\nThat would total 30 acres.\n\nAlternatively, they could calculate based on the desired animal density.\n\nIf they want to maintain the current density of 6 animals per acre, then for the new 200 animals, they would need about 33.33 acres.\n\nSo, rounding up, 34 acres.\n\nBut, if they allocate 1 acre per species, that's 20 acres, which would give them a density of 10 animals per acre for the new additions.\n\nIf that's acceptable, then 20 acres would suffice.\n\nAlternatively, if they want to match the existing density, they would need 34 acres.\n\nBut, perhaps a compromise could be to allocate 1 acre per species plus additional acres for species with larger space requirements.\n\nFor example, if some of the new species are large mammals that need 2 or 3 acres, then they would need to allocate accordingly.\n\nWithout specific information on the space requirements of the new species, it's difficult to give a precise number.\n\nHowever, based on the average, it seems that 20 acres would be the minimum required, but to account for variations, perhaps 30 acres would be a safer estimate.\n\nAlternatively, if they aim to maintain the current animal density, they would need about 34 acres for the new animals.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Based on average 1 acre per species: 20 species \u00d7 1 acre = 20 acres\n\n- To maintain current density (6 animals per acre) for new animals: 200 animals \u00f7 6 = 33.33 acres \u2248 34 acres\n\n- A compromise could be 25-30 acres to account for varying space requirements.\n\nTherefore, the zoo should consider purchasing at least 30 acres of additional land to accommodate the new species and their animals appropriately.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30 \\text{ acres}} \\]"
