        "content": "To solve the equation 3x - 7 = 11, we need to find the value of x that makes the equation true. We'll do this by isolating x on one side of the equation. Here are the steps:\n\nStep 1: Start with the equation:\n3x - 7 = 11\n\nStep 2: Add 7 to both sides to cancel the -7 on the left side:\n3x - 7 + 7 = 11 + 7\nThis simplifies to:\n3x = 18\n\nStep 3: Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:\n3x / 3 = 18 / 3\nThis simplifies to:\nx = 6\n\nSo, the solution is x = 6.\n\nTo check if this is correct, we can plug x = 6 back into the original equation:\n3*(6) - 7 = 18 - 7 = 11, which matches the right side of the equation. So, our solution is correct."
