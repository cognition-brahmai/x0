        "content": "So the car factory makes 120 cars each day and works for 300 days every year. We need to find out how many cars it will make in 5 years. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many cars are produced in one day. That's given as 120 cars.\n\nNext, how many days does the factory operate in a year? That's 300 days.\n\nSo, to find out how many cars are produced in one year, we can multiply the number of cars made per day by the number of days in a year that the factory operates.\n\nCars per year = cars per day \u00d7 days per year\nCars per year = 120 \u00d7 300\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n120 multiplied by 300. Well, 120 times 3 is 360, and since 300 is 3 times 100, it would be 360 times 100, which is 36,000.\n\nSo, the factory produces 36,000 cars per year.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many cars are produced in 5 years. So, we'll multiply the annual production by 5.\n\nTotal cars in 5 years = cars per year \u00d7 number of years\nTotal cars in 5 years = 36,000 \u00d7 5\n\nLet's do that multiplication.\n\n36,000 times 5 is 180,000.\n\nTherefore, the car factory will produce 180,000 cars in 5 years.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, 120 cars per day times 300 days per year equals 36,000 cars per year. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 36,000 cars per year times 5 years equals 180,000 cars. That also seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as total cars equals production rate per day times number of days in 5 years.\n\nNumber of days in 5 years is 300 days/year times 5 years, which is 1,500 days.\n\nThen, 120 cars/day times 1,500 days equals 180,000 cars.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, the final answer is 180,000 cars in 5 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180000} \\]"
