Maybe it's just about enjoying the simple things in life, like flying a kite on a breezy day or having a good chat with Snoopy. Or maybe it's about never giving up, even when things get tough, like when I try to kick that football and Lucy always pulls it away. But even though I never succeed, I keep trying because that's part of life, right? So, maybe happiness is about perseverance and finding joy in the little moments despite the challenges. What do you think?"
