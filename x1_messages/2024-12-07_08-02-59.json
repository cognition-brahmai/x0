        "content": "I have a fair six-sided die numbered from 1 to 6. I need to find out the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled in three throws is even. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each roll is independent, and the die is fair, so each face has an equal probability of landing face up. The possible outcomes for each roll are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\nI need to find the probability that the sum of three rolls is even. To do that, I should consider the properties of even and odd numbers. Specifically, I recall that:\n\n- Even + even = even\n\n- Odd + odd = even\n\n- Even + odd = odd\n\nSince I'm dealing with three numbers, I need to extend this to three terms. Let's consider the possible combinations of even and odd numbers in three rolls and see what their sums would be.\n\nLet's denote E for even and O for odd. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. E + E + E = E\n\n2. E + E + O = O\n\n3. E + O + O = O\n\n4. O + O + O = O\n\nWait, that seems incomplete. Actually, there are eight possible combinations:\n\n1. E + E + E = E\n\n2. E + E + O = O\n\n3. E + O + E = O\n\n4. E + O + O = E\n\n5. O + E + E = O\n\n6. O + E + O = E\n\n7. O + O + E = E\n\n8. O + O + O = O\n\nWait, actually, let's correct that. When you add three numbers, the sum is even if there are either zero odd numbers or two odd numbers. Because:\n\n- Zero odd numbers: all even, sum is even.\n\n- One odd number: even + even + odd = even + odd = odd\n\n- Two odd numbers: even + odd + odd = even + even = even\n\n- Three odd numbers: odd + odd + odd = odd + even = odd\n\nSo, the sum is even if there are 0 or 2 odd numbers in the three rolls.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability of having 0 or 2 odd numbers in three rolls.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of each possible number of odd numbers.\n\nSince the die is fair, the probability of rolling an odd number is 3/6 = 1/2, and the same for even, 1/2.\n\nThis is a binomial probability problem, where each roll is a Bernoulli trial with probability p = 1/2 for odd.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the number of trials (rolls), which is 3.\n\n- k is the number of successes (odd numbers).\n\n- C(n,k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\nSo, P(0 odd) = C(3,0) * (1/2)^0 * (1/2)^3 = 1 * 1 * 1/8 = 1/8\n\nP(1 odd) = C(3,1) * (1/2)^1 * (1/2)^2 = 3 * 1/2 * 1/4 = 3/8\n\nP(2 odd) = C(3,2) * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^1 = 3 * 1/4 * 1/2 = 3/8\n\nP(3 odd) = C(3,3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^0 = 1 * 1/8 * 1 = 1/8\n\nNow, the sum is even if there are 0 or 2 odd numbers, so P(sum even) = P(0 odd) + P(2 odd) = 1/8 + 3/8 = 4/8 = 1/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. The probability is 1/2.\n\nBut let's think about it another way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that for the sum of three numbers to be even, the number of odd numbers must be even. Since there are three rolls, the possible even counts of odd numbers are 0 or 2.\n\nWe already calculated that P(0 odd) + P(2 odd) = 1/8 + 3/8 = 4/8 = 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a simpler way to see this.\n\nConsider that the sum of two numbers is even if both are even or both are odd. Then adding a third number:\n\n- If the first two sum to even, adding an even number keeps it even, adding an odd makes it odd.\n\n- If the first two sum to odd, adding an even number makes it odd, adding an odd makes it even.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of parity.\n\nLet me consider the parity of each roll:\n\nEach roll is either even or odd, each with probability 1/2.\n\nThe sum is even if the number of odd rolls is even.\n\nIn three rolls, the number of odd rolls can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nAs calculated earlier, P(0 odd) = 1/8\n\nP(1 odd) = 3/8\n\nP(2 odd) = 3/8\n\nP(3 odd) = 1/8\n\nSo P(sum even) = P(0 odd) + P(2 odd) = 1/8 + 3/8 = 4/8 = 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, P(sum odd) = P(1 odd) + P(3 odd) = 3/8 + 1/8 = 4/8 = 1/2.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/2.\n\nWait, is there an even simpler way to see this?\n\nConsider that the sum of three dice rolls can range from 3 (1+1+1) to 18 (6+6+6).\n\nThe possible sums are the integers from 3 to 18.\n\nNow, among these sums, half are even and half are odd, since the range starts at 3 (odd) and ends at 18 (even), and there are 16 possible sums (3 to 18 inclusive).\n\nWait, 3 to 18 inclusive is 16 numbers: 3,4,5,...,18.\n\nOut of these, 8 are even and 8 are odd.\n\nBut, is it necessarily true that each even sum is equally likely as each odd sum?\n\nActually, no, because the distribution of sums is not uniform. Some sums are more likely than others.\n\nFor example, sum=3 can only occur if all three dice show 1, which has probability (1/6)^3 = 1/216.\n\nSum=4 can occur if two dice show 1 and one shows 2, in various combinations.\n\nSo, the probabilities vary for different sums.\n\nTherefore, simply counting the number of even and odd sums and assuming they are equally likely is not correct.\n\nHence, the earlier approach using binomial probabilities is more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think recursively.\n\nConsider that the sum of the first two dice can be either even or odd, each with probability 1/2.\n\nThen, adding the third die:\n\n- If the sum of the first two is even, adding an even number keeps it even, adding an odd makes it odd.\n\n- If the sum of the first two is odd, adding an even number makes it odd, adding an odd makes it even.\n\nSo, in either case, the final sum is equally likely to be even or odd, since the third die has equal probability of being even or odd.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum is even is 1/2.\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the parity of the sum depends only on the parities of the individual dice rolls, and since each die is independent and has equal probability of being even or odd, the sum's parity is equally likely to be even or odd.\n\nTherefore, P(sum even) = 1/2.\n\nThis seems straightforward, and it aligns with the more detailed binomial calculation.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled on three dice is even is 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
