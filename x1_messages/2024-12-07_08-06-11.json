        "content": "Ludwig van Beethoven composed the famous four-note motif that opens his Symphony No. 5 in C minor, Op. 67. This iconic motif, often described as \" fate knocking at the door,\" consists of three short notes followed by one long note (short-short-short-long). It is one of the most recognizable musical phrases in Western classical music and has been used in various contexts beyond the symphony itself. Beethoven began working on this symphony around 1804 and completed it in 1808. The premiere took place at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna on December 22, 1808, during a concert that also featured the premiere of his Symphony No. 6 and parts of his concerti and other works."
