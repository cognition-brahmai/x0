I need to find out how many men there are.\n\nOkay, so let's define variables for the number of men and women. Let\u2019s say the number of men is M and the number of women is W.\n\nAccording to the problem, there are 10 more women than men, so W = M + 10.\n\nAlso, the total number of people in the room is 30, so M + W = 30.\n\nNow, I can substitute the first equation into the second equation.\n\nSo, M + (M + 10) = 30.\n\nThat simplifies to 2M + 10 = 30.\n\nNext, I'll subtract 10 from both sides: 2M = 20.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2: M = 10.\n\nSo, there are 10 men in the room.\n\nBut wait, let me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf there are 10 men, then there are 10 + 10 = 20 women.\n\nTotal people: 10 men + 20 women = 30, which matches the total given.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
