        "content": "First, I need to find the area of the garden in square feet and then convert that to square meters. The garden is rectangular, so the area in square feet is length times width.\n\nLength = 30 feet\n\nWidth = 20 feet\n\nArea in square feet = 30 feet * 20 feet = 600 square feet\n\nNow, I need to convert square feet to square meters. I know that 1 foot is equal to 0.3048 meters. Since area is in square units, I need to square the conversion factor.\n\n1 square foot = (0.3048 meters)^2 = 0.09290304 square meters\n\nSo, to convert 600 square feet to square meters:\n\n600 square feet * 0.09290304 square meters/square foot = 55.741824 square meters\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's approximately 55.74 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{55.74} \\]"
