        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a class of 40 students, and 25% of them are left-handed. First, I need to find out how many students are left-handed.\n\nTo do that, I'll calculate 25% of 40:\n\n\\[\n0.25 \\times 40 = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 10 left-handed students.\n\nNext, the problem says there are 8 more right-handed students than left-handed students. Since there are 10 left-handed students, the number of right-handed students would be:\n\n\\[\n10 + 8 = 18\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. If there are 10 left-handed students and 18 right-handed students, that adds up to:\n\n\\[\n10 + 18 = 28\n\\]\n\nBut the class has 40 students in total. So, if 28 students are left-handed or right-handed, that leaves:\n\n\\[\n40 - 28 = 12\n\\]\n\nStudents who are neither left-handed nor right-handed. But the problem mentions that there are ambidextrous students. Ambidextrous means they can use both hands equally well, so they might be considered both left-handed and right-handed. But in this context, it seems like ambidextrous students are a separate category.\n\nHowever, the problem might be considering ambidextrous students as part of either left-handed or right-handed, or perhaps as a separate group. I need to clarify this.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"In a class of 40 students, 25% are left-handed. If there are 8 more right-handed students than left-handed students, how many students are ambidextrous?\"\n\nThe problem mentions left-handed, right-handed, and ambidextrous students. It's possible that ambidextrous students are in addition to left-handed and right-handed students, or they might be included in one of these categories.\n\nBut typically, in such problems, ambidextrous students are considered separately because they can use both hands. So, perhaps the total number of students is the sum of left-handed, right-handed, and ambidextrous students.\n\nLet me assume that:\n\nTotal students = left-handed + right-handed + ambidextrous\n\nWe know:\n\nTotal students = 40\n\nLeft-handed students = 25% of 40 = 10\n\nRight-handed students = left-handed students + 8 = 10 + 8 = 18\n\nTherefore, ambidextrous students = total students - (left-handed + right-handed) = 40 - (10 + 18) = 40 - 28 = 12\n\nSo, there are 12 ambidextrous students.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps ambidextrous students are included in both left-handed and right-handed counts. For example, if a student is ambidextrous, they might be counted as both left-handed and right-handed.\n\nIn that case, the actual number of unique left-handed students would be fewer because some ambidextrous students are being counted in both categories.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nL = number of left-handed students (including ambidextrous)\n\nR = number of right-handed students (including ambidextrous)\n\nA = number of ambidextrous students\n\nThen, the actual number of purely left-handed students (excluding ambidextrous) would be L - A\n\nSimilarly, the actual number of purely right-handed students would be R - A\n\nThe total number of students would be:\n\n(Purely left-handed) + (Purely right-handed) + Ambidextrous = (L - A) + (R - A) + A = L + R - A\n\nWe know that total students = 40, L = 10, R = 18\n\nSo:\n\n10 + 18 - A = 40\n\n28 - A = 40\n\nA = 28 - 40\n\nA = -12\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. You can't have a negative number of students.\n\nHmm, maybe I set up the equation wrong.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nIf L includes ambidextrous students, and R also includes ambidextrous students, then the total number of students is:\n\nL + R - A = 40\n\nBecause the ambidextrous students are counted in both L and R, so we need to subtract A to avoid double-counting.\n\nGiven L = 10, R = 18, and total students = 40:\n\n10 + 18 - A = 40\n\n28 - A = 40\n\nA = 28 - 40\n\nA = -12\n\nAgain, negative number doesn't make sense. There must be a mistake in the approach.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nPerhaps the 25% left-handed includes ambidextrous students, and the right-handed students are separate.\n\nBut the problem states \"25% are left-handed,\" and \"there are 8 more right-handed students than left-handed students.\" It doesn't specify anything about ambidextrous students being included or not.\n\nMaybe the ambidextrous students are not included in the left-handed or right-handed counts.\n\nIn that case:\n\nTotal students = left-handed + right-handed + ambidextrous\n\nGiven that left-handed = 10, right-handed = 10 + 8 = 18, then ambidextrous = 40 - 10 - 18 = 12\n\nThis seems straightforward, and earlier I thought maybe it was too straightforward, but perhaps that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that ambidextrous students are considered both left-handed and right-handed, so they are included in both counts.\n\nIn that case, the actual number of unique left-handed students would be L - A, and right-handed would be R - A.\n\nThen, total students = (L - A) + (R - A) + A = L + R - A\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n10 + 18 - A = 40\n\n28 - A = 40\n\nA = 28 - 40\n\nA = -12\n\nAgain, negative number doesn't make sense. So perhaps the ambidextrous students are not included in the left-handed and right-handed counts.\n\nTherefore, the simplest approach is correct: ambidextrous students are a separate group, and the number is 12.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't consider ambidextrous students at all, but that seems unlikely because the question specifically asks for the number of ambidextrous students.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the percentages don't add up to 100%, and the difference is the ambidextrous students.\n\nBut 25% are left-handed, and there are 8 more right-handed students than left-handed students.\n\nLet me try setting up equations.\n\nLet L = number of left-handed students\n\nGiven that 25% are left-handed: L = 0.25 * 40 = 10\n\nR = number of right-handed students = L + 8 = 10 + 8 = 18\n\nTotal students = L + R + A = 40\n\nSo, A = 40 - L - R = 40 - 10 - 18 = 12\n\nTherefore, there are 12 ambidextrous students.\n\nThis seems consistent unless there's another way to interpret the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers ambidextrous students as both left-handed and right-handed, and the counts are inclusive of ambidextrous students.\n\nIn that case, the actual number of unique left-handed students is L - A, and right-handed is R - A.\n\nThen, total students = (L - A) + (R - A) + A = L + R - A\n\nPlugging in:\n\n10 + 18 - A = 40\n\nA = 10 + 18 - 40 = -12\n\nAgain, negative number doesn't make sense. So this approach is flawed.\n\nPerhaps the problem doesn't account for ambidextrous students in the left-handed or right-handed counts, meaning ambidextrous students are a separate group.\n\nThus, A = 40 - L - R = 40 - 10 - 18 = 12\n\nSo, the number of ambidextrous students is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
