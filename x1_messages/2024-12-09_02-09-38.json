        "content": "So there's a class with 40 students, and 60% of them are boys. I need to find out how many girls are in the class. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many boys there are. If 60% of the class are boys, then I can calculate the number of boys by taking 60% of 40. To do that, I can multiply 40 by 0.60.\n\nSo, 40 times 0.60 is... let's see, 40 times 0.60 is 24. So there are 24 boys in the class.\n\nNow, to find out how many girls there are, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students. So, 40 minus 24 equals 16.\n\nTherefore, there are 16 girls in the class.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can calculate the percentage of girls directly. If 60% are boys, then the remaining percentage must be girls. So, 100% minus 60% equals 40%. So, girls make up 40% of the class.\n\nThen, to find the number of girls, I can calculate 40% of 40. That would be 40 times 0.40, which is 16.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, which is 16 girls in the class.\n\nI think that makes sense. Just to double-check, if there are 24 boys and 16 girls, that adds up to 40 students, which matches the total given. So, I'm confident that 16 is the correct number of girls in the class.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
