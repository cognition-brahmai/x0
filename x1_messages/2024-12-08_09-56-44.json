        "content": "So I have this problem here: a sphere has a surface area of 100 square centimeters, and I need to find its volume. Okay, first things first, I need to remember the formulas for the surface area and volume of a sphere. I think the surface area (SA) of a sphere is given by SA = 4\u03c0r\u00b2, and the volume (V) is V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nSo, I have the surface area, which is 100 cm\u00b2, and I need to find the volume. To do that, I need to find the radius first, right? Because the volume formula has r in it, and I don't know r yet.\n\nSo, starting with the surface area formula:\n\nSA = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n\nI know SA is 100 cm\u00b2, so:\n\n4\u03c0r\u00b2 = 100\n\nNow, I need to solve for r. First, I can divide both sides by 4\u03c0 to isolate r\u00b2:\n\nr\u00b2 = 100 / (4\u03c0)\n\nLet me calculate that. 100 divided by 4 is 25, so:\n\nr\u00b2 = 25 / \u03c0\n\nNow, to find r, I take the square root of both sides:\n\nr = \u221a(25 / \u03c0)\n\n\u221a(25) is 5, so:\n\nr = 5 / \u221a\u03c0\n\nHmm, I can rationalize the denominator if I want:\n\nr = 5\u221a\u03c0 / \u03c0\n\nOkay, that's fine. Now that I have r, I can plug it into the volume formula.\n\nV = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\n\nSubstitute r = 5 / \u221a\u03c0:\n\nV = (4/3)\u03c0 * (5 / \u221a\u03c0)\u00b3\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I can simplify it step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate r\u00b3:\n\nr\u00b3 = (5 / \u221a\u03c0)\u00b3 = 5\u00b3 / (\u221a\u03c0)\u00b3 = 125 / \u03c0^(3/2)\n\nNow, plug that back into the volume formula:\n\nV = (4/3)\u03c0 * (125 / \u03c0^(3/2))\n\nNow, simplify the expression:\n\nV = (4/3) * 125 * \u03c0 / \u03c0^(3/2)\n\n\u03c0 divided by \u03c0^(3/2) is \u03c0^(1 - 3/2) = \u03c0^(-1/2)\n\nSo:\n\nV = (4/3)*125*\u03c0^(-1/2)\n\nWhich is:\n\nV = (500/3)/\u221a\u03c0\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet me think differently. Since I have SA = 4\u03c0r\u00b2 = 100, and V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, maybe I can express V in terms of SA.\n\nI know that r = \u221a(SA / (4\u03c0)), from the surface area formula.\n\nSo, r = \u221a(100 / (4\u03c0)) = \u221a(25 / \u03c0) = 5 / \u221a\u03c0, which is what I had before.\n\nThen, V = (4/3)\u03c0*(5 / \u221a\u03c0)^3\n\nMaybe I can express V in terms of SA.\n\nWait, there's a relationship between SA and V for a sphere.\n\nI recall that for a sphere, V = (SA * r)/3\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nV = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\n\nSA = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n\nSo, V = (SA * r)/3\n\nBecause 4\u03c0r\u00b2 * r / 3 = 4\u03c0r\u00b3 / 3, which matches the volume formula.\n\nSo, V = (SA * r)/3\n\nNow, I can solve for V in terms of SA.\n\nBut I still need to find r in terms of SA.\n\nFrom SA = 4\u03c0r\u00b2, r = \u221a(SA / (4\u03c0))\n\nSo, plugging back into V:\n\nV = (SA / 3) * \u221a(SA / (4\u03c0))\n\nLet me plug in SA = 100 cm\u00b2:\n\nV = (100 / 3) * \u221a(100 / (4\u03c0)) = (100 / 3) * \u221a(25 / \u03c0) = (100 / 3) * (5 / \u221a\u03c0) = (500 / 3) / \u221a\u03c0\n\nOkay, that's the same expression I had earlier.\n\nMaybe I can approximate this numerically.\n\nFirst, I need to know the value of \u03c0, which is approximately 3.1416.\n\nSo, \u221a\u03c0 is approximately \u221a3.1416 \u2248 1.7725\n\nThen, V \u2248 (500 / 3) / 1.7725 \u2248 (166.6667) / 1.7725 \u2248 94.025 cm\u00b3\n\nWait, but I feel like there might be a more straightforward way to calculate this.\n\nLet me try to express V in terms of SA.\n\nI know that SA = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n\nAnd V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\n\nIf I solve SA = 4\u03c0r\u00b2 for r\u00b2, I get r\u00b2 = SA / (4\u03c0)\n\nThen, r = \u221a(SA / (4\u03c0))\n\nNow, V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b2 * r\n\nSubstitute r\u00b2 = SA / (4\u03c0):\n\nV = (4/3)\u03c0 * (SA / (4\u03c0)) * r = (4/3) * (SA / 4) * r = (SA / 3) * r\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, since r = \u221a(SA / (4\u03c0)), I can substitute that into the volume formula.\n\nBut it seems like I'm going in circles.\n\nMaybe I can use the relationship between SA and V differently.\n\nI recall that for a sphere, the surface area is related to the volume by SA = dV/dr * 4\u03c0r\u00b2.\n\nWait, that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, I know that for a sphere, the volume can be expressed as V = SA * r / 3\n\nWhich is what I had earlier.\n\nSo, perhaps the best way is to calculate r from SA, and then plug it into the volume formula.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the calculation I did earlier.\n\nSo, SA = 4\u03c0r\u00b2 = 100 cm\u00b2\n\nTherefore, r\u00b2 = 100 / (4\u03c0) = 25 / \u03c0\n\nSo, r = 5 / \u221a\u03c0 cm\n\nNow, V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0 * (125 / \u03c0^(3/2)) = (500/3) / \u221a\u03c0 cm\u00b3\n\nApproximating this, as I did earlier, gives approximately 94.025 cm\u00b3\n\nBut maybe I can leave it in exact form without approximating.\n\nSo, V = (500/3) / \u221a\u03c0 cm\u00b3\n\nAlternatively, I can rationalize the denominator:\n\nV = (500/3) * \u221a\u03c0 / \u03c0 cm\u00b3 = (500\u221a\u03c0)/ (3\u03c0) cm\u00b3\n\nWhich simplifies to V = (500 / (3\u221a\u03c0)) cm\u00b3\n\nBut I think the previous form is better.\n\nAlternatively, since SA = 4\u03c0r\u00b2 = 100, then \u03c0r\u00b2 = 25, so r\u00b2 = 25/\u03c0, and r = 5/\u221a\u03c0\n\nThen, V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0 * (125 / \u03c0^(3/2)) = (500/3) / \u221a\u03c0 cm\u00b3\n\nWait, I'm going back to the same expression.\n\nPerhaps there's a better way to express this.\n\nAlternatively, I can solve for r from SA = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n\nSo, r\u00b2 = SA / (4\u03c0) = 100 / (4\u03c0) = 25 / \u03c0\n\nTherefore, r = 5 / \u221a\u03c0 cm\n\nNow, V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0 * (125 / \u03c0^(3/2)) = (500/3) / \u221a\u03c0 cm\u00b3\n\nAlternatively, since r = 5 / \u221a\u03c0, then r\u00b3 = 125 / \u03c0^(3/2)\n\nSo, V = (4/3)\u03c0 * (125 / \u03c0^(3/2)) = (500/3) / \u221a\u03c0 cm\u00b3\n\nI think this is as simplified as it gets.\n\nAlternatively, I can express it in terms of \u03c0.\n\nBut to get a numerical value, I can plug in the approximation.\n\nSo, \u221a\u03c0 \u2248 1.7725, as I had earlier.\n\nThen, V \u2248 (500 / 3) / 1.7725 \u2248 166.6667 / 1.7725 \u2248 94.025 cm\u00b3\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator, I can get a more precise numerical value.\n\nBut perhaps the question wants the exact expression.\n\nSo, the volume is V = (500 / (3\u221a\u03c0)) cm\u00b3\n\nAlternatively, rationalizing the denominator, V = (500\u221a\u03c0)/(3\u03c0) cm\u00b3\n\nEither way, that's the volume of the sphere given the surface area is 100 cm\u00b2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{500}{3\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\text{ cubic centimeters}} \\]"
