        "content": "So the hotel chain is looking to implement a waste reduction program across all their properties. They've estimated that by reducing food waste by 25%, they can save $3 million annually on food purchases. Additionally, by reducing water usage by 15%, they expect to save another $2 million per year. The initial investment required for this program includes equipment upgrades and employee training, totaling $10 million. The question is, how long will it take for the hotel chain to recover their initial investment through these savings?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total annual savings from this program. They're saving $3 million from reduced food waste and $2 million from reduced water usage. So, the total annual savings would be:\n\nTotal annual savings = Savings from food waste + Savings from water usage\nTotal annual savings = $3,000,000 + $2,000,000\nTotal annual savings = $5,000,000\n\nNow, the initial investment is $10 million. To find out how long it will take to recover this investment, I need to divide the initial investment by the annual savings.\n\nPayback period = Initial investment / Total annual savings\nPayback period = $10,000,000 / $5,000,000\nPayback period = 2 years\n\nSo, it will take 2 years for the hotel chain to recover their initial investment through the savings from reduced food waste and water usage.\n\nBut wait, is there anything else I should consider? Is there any ongoing cost associated with maintaining this program that might affect the net savings? The problem doesn't mention any additional costs beyond the initial investment, so I'll assume that the $5 million in annual savings is net of any ongoing costs.\n\nAlso, I should consider if the savings are guaranteed or if there's any variability. For example, if the reduction in food waste or water usage isn't achieved, the savings might be less than estimated. But since the problem states that they \"estimate\" these savings, it suggests that these are expected values, and I should proceed with these estimates for the calculation.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the time value of money. In some investment analyses, the present value of future savings is calculated to determine the true payback period. However, since the problem doesn't mention any discount rate or require consideration of the time value of money, I'll assume that simple division of initial investment by annual savings is sufficient.\n\nMoreover, the problem specifies \"how long it will take to recover their initial investment through these savings,\" which suggests a straightforward payback period calculation without considering more complex financial metrics like net present value or internal rate of return.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the payback period is 2 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ years}} \\]"
