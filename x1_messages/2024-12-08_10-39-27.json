        "content": "Let's see. The farmer has 20 pigs and 5 cows. Each pig eats 4 pounds of food per day, and each cow eats 8 pounds per day. He wants to buy enough food for one week, which is 7 days.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how much food all the pigs eat in one day. Since there are 20 pigs and each eats 4 pounds per day, I can multiply 20 by 4.\n\n20 pigs * 4 pounds/pig/day = 80 pounds/day for pigs.\n\nNext, for the cows. There are 5 cows, and each eats 8 pounds per day. So, 5 cows * 8 pounds/cow/day = 40 pounds/day for cows.\n\nNow, to find the total food needed per day for both pigs and cows, I add the two amounts together.\n\n80 pounds/day (pigs) + 40 pounds/day (cows) = 120 pounds/day total.\n\nSince the farmer needs food for one week, which is 7 days, I need to multiply the daily total by 7.\n\n120 pounds/day * 7 days = 840 pounds.\n\nSo, the farmer needs to buy 840 pounds of food for one week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the weekly food for pigs and cows separately and then add them up.\n\nFirst, for pigs: 20 pigs * 4 pounds/day * 7 days = 20 * 4 * 7 = 560 pounds for pigs.\n\nFor cows: 5 cows * 8 pounds/day * 7 days = 5 * 8 * 7 = 280 pounds for cows.\n\nNow, add the two amounts: 560 + 280 = 840 pounds.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. So, 840 pounds seems to be the correct amount.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor to consider. For example, are there any leftovers from previous stocks? Or maybe the eating habits change during the week. But according to the problem, it's a straightforward calculation based on constant daily consumption.\n\nAlso, ensure that the units are consistent. Pounds of food per day, multiplied by days, gives pounds, which is what we need.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total number of animals and their average food consumption.\n\nTotal animals: 20 pigs + 5 cows = 25 animals.\n\nAverage food per animal per day: (20 pigs * 4 pounds/pig/day + 5 cows * 8 pounds/cow/day) / 25 animals.\n\nThat would be (80 + 40) / 25 = 120 / 25 = 4.8 pounds per animal per day.\n\nThen, total food for one week: 25 animals * 4.8 pounds/animal/day * 7 days = 25 * 4.8 * 7.\n\nLet's compute that: 25 * 4.8 = 120 pounds/day, and 120 * 7 = 840 pounds.\n\nAgain, the same result. This gives me more confidence that 840 pounds is the correct amount.\n\nPerhaps I can also think in terms of total food per type of animal and then sum them up.\n\nFor pigs:\n\nEach pig eats 4 pounds/day, so for 7 days, one pig eats 4 * 7 = 28 pounds.\n\nWith 20 pigs, total is 20 * 28 = 560 pounds.\n\nFor cows:\n\nEach cow eats 8 pounds/day, so for 7 days, one cow eats 8 * 7 = 56 pounds.\n\nWith 5 cows, total is 5 * 56 = 280 pounds.\n\nTotal food: 560 + 280 = 840 pounds.\n\nOnce more, the same answer.\n\nI think it's clear that the farmer needs to buy 840 pounds of food for one week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{840} \\]"
