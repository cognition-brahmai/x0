        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a group of people, and we're looking at two features: whether they're wearing glasses and whether they're wearing hats.\n\nFirst, we know that 75% of the people are wearing glasses. That means three-quarters of the group have glasses on.\n\nNext, 45% are wearing hats. That's less than half, so a bit less than half the group has hats.\n\nNow, the tricky part is that 30% are wearing both glasses and hats. So, these people are counted in both the 75% and the 45%.\n\nThe question is asking for the percentage of people who are wearing either glasses or hats or both. In set theory terms, this is the union of the two sets: glasses and hats.\n\nThere's a formula for finding the union of two sets:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Union} = \\text{Glasses} + \\text{Hats} - \\text{Both}\n\\]\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Union} = 75\\% + 45\\% - 30\\% = 90\\%\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check if I'm missing anything.\n\nLet me visualize this with a Venn diagram. Imagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents people wearing glasses, and the other represents people wearing hats.\n\n- The glasses circle is 75% of the group.\n\n- The hats circle is 45% of the group.\n\n- The overlapping area, where both glasses and hats are worn, is 30%.\n\nSo, the total area covered by either circle, which is what we're looking for, should be the sum of the individual areas minus the overlap, to avoid double-counting those who wear both.\n\nYes, that matches the formula I used earlier.\n\nBut, maybe I should consider if there's any possibility of people wearing neither glasses nor hats. The question is about those wearing either or both, but perhaps I should mention that 100% minus 90% are wearing neither.\n\nWait, but the question specifically asked for those wearing either glasses or hats or both, so 90% seems to be the direct answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using probabilities.\n\nIf we think of wearing glasses as event A and wearing hats as event B, then:\n\n- P(A) = 75%\n\n- P(B) = 45%\n\n- P(A and B) = 30%\n\nAnd we want P(A or B), which is:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\text{ and } B)\n\\]\n\nAgain, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ or } B) = 75\\% + 45\\% - 30\\% = 90\\%\n\\]\n\nSame result. That gives me more confidence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the number of people in each category.\n\nLet\u2019s assume there are 100 people in the group for simplicity.\n\n- 75 people wear glasses.\n\n- 45 people wear hats.\n\n- 30 people wear both.\n\nSo, the number of people who wear only glasses is 75 - 30 = 45.\n\nThe number of people who wear only hats is 45 - 30 = 15.\n\nTherefore, the total number wearing either glasses or hats or both is:\n\nOnly glasses: 45\n\nOnly hats: 15\n\nBoth: 30\n\nTotal: 45 + 15 + 30 = 90\n\nSo, 90 out of 100 people, which is 90%.\n\nThis matches what I got earlier.\n\nIs there any other angle I should consider? Maybe if there are people wearing neither, but the question isn't asking about them directly.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, if 90% are wearing either glasses or hats or both, then 10% must be wearing neither.\n\nBut since the question only asks for those wearing glasses or hats or both, 90% should be the answer.\n\nLet me see if there's any chance of misinterpretation in the problem statement.\n\n\"In a group of people, 75% are wearing glasses, and 45% are wearing hats. If 30% of the people are wearing both glasses and hats, what percentage of the people are wearing either glasses or hats or both?\"\n\nSeems clear enough. They're directly asking for the union of the two sets.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the inclusion-exclusion principle, which is essentially what the formula does: include the individual sets and exclude the intersection.\n\nSo, again, 75% + 45% - 30% = 90%.\n\nI think I've confirmed this enough ways. It's consistent across different approaches.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90\\%} \\]"
