        "content": "So in this class, there are 30 students in total, and there are twice as many girls as boys. So, if we let the number of boys be B, then the number of girls would be 2B, right? Because there are twice as many girls as boys.\n\nSo, the total number of students would be B + 2B, which is 3B, and we know that's equal to 30. So, 3B = 30. To find B, we can divide both sides by 3, so B = 10. That means there are 10 boys.\n\nSince there are twice as many girls, the number of girls is 2 times 10, which is 20.\n\nNow, the teacher picks one student at random. The probability that the chosen student is a girl is the number of girls divided by the total number of students.\n\nSo, probability P = number of girls / total students = 20 / 30.\n\nWe can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 10, which gives P = 2/3.\n\nSo, the probability is 2/3, or approximately 0.6667, which is about 66.67%.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that.\n\nIf there are 10 boys and 20 girls, that does add up to 30 students.\n\nAnd twice as many girls as boys: 2 times 10 is 20, which checks out.\n\nSo, yes, the probability should be 20 out of 30, which simplifies to 2/3.\n\nAlternatively, you could think of it in terms of percentages. 20 divided by 30 is approximately 0.6667, and multiplied by 100% gives about 66.67%.\n\nSo, there's approximately a 66.67% chance that the teacher picks a girl.\n\nAlternatively, you can think about it in terms of odds.\n\nThe odds of picking a girl are 20 to 10, which simplifies to 2 to 1.\n\nBut probability is specifically the favorable outcomes over the total outcomes, which is 20 over 30, or 2/3.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}} \\]"
