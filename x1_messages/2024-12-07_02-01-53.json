        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 people in total waiting in line to buy tickets for a concert, and there are twice as many women as men. I need to find out how many men and women there are.\n\nFirst, I should define variables for the number of men and women. Let's say:\n\n- Let m be the number of men in the line.\n\n- Since there are twice as many women as men, the number of women would be 2m.\n\nNow, the total number of people is the sum of men and women, so:\n\nm + 2m = 30\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n3m = 30\n\nNow, to find m, I can divide both sides by 3:\n\nm = 30 / 3\n\nm = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 men in the line.\n\nSince there are twice as many women as men, the number of women is:\n\n2 * 10 = 20\n\nTherefore, there are 10 men and 20 women in the line.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If there are 10 men and 20 women, that does add up to 30 people, and 20 is indeed twice 10. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of ratios. Since there are twice as many women as men, the ratio of women to men is 2:1. That means for every 1 man, there are 2 women. So, the total parts are 1 + 2 = 3 parts.\n\nGiven that there are 30 people in total, each part represents 30 / 3 = 10 people.\n\nTherefore, the number of men is 1 part * 10 = 10 men, and the number of women is 2 parts * 10 = 20 women.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that the number of women is twice the number of men. So, if I let m be the number of men, then women are 2m, and m + 2m = 30, which again gives me m = 10 and women = 20.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 10 men and 20 women.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ men and } 20 \\text{ women}} \\]"
