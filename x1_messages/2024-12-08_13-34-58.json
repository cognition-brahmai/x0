        "content": "So there are 100 people in a room, and 75% of them have brown eyes, and 40% have blonde hair. I need to find out the maximum number of people who could have both brown eyes and blonde hair.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many people have brown eyes and how many have blonde hair.\n\n75% of 100 people have brown eyes, so that's:\n\n0.75 * 100 = 75 people with brown eyes.\n\n40% of 100 people have blonde hair, so that's:\n\n0.40 * 100 = 40 people with blonde hair.\n\nNow, I need to find the maximum number of people who have both brown eyes and blonde hair.\n\nTo maximize the number of people who have both features, I should consider the overlap between the two groups.\n\nThe maximum overlap can't be more than the size of the smaller group.\n\nIn this case, the group with blonde hair is smaller, with 40 people, compared to the group with brown eyes, which has 75 people.\n\nSo, the maximum number of people who could have both brown eyes and blonde hair is 40, because there are only 40 people with blonde hair to begin with.\n\nBut let me double-check this.\n\nIf all 40 people with blonde hair also have brown eyes, then that would account for 40 people having both features.\n\nHowever, since there are 75 people with brown eyes, having 40 of them also have blonde hair doesn't exceed any limits.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to have more than 40 people with both features, say 41, but there are only 40 people with blonde hair, that's not possible because there aren't enough blonde-haired people to go around.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of people who could have both brown eyes and blonde hair is indeed 40.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this?\n\nMaybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any two sets, the size of their union is the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of their intersection.\n\nIn formula terms:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nIn this context, let's define:\n\nA = people with brown eyes\n\nB = people with blonde hair\n\nWe know:\n\n|A| = 75\n\n|B| = 40\n\n|A \u222a B| \u2264 100, because there are only 100 people in total.\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n|A \u222a B| = 75 + 40 - |A \u2229 B|\n\nTo find the maximum |A \u2229 B|, we need to minimize |A \u222a B|.\n\nThe smallest |A \u222a B| can be is 75, because there are 75 people with brown eyes, and adding people with blonde hair can't make the union smaller than that.\n\nBut actually, |A \u222a B| can be as small as the larger of |A| and |B|, which is 75 in this case.\n\nSo,\n\n75 \u2264 |A \u222a B| \u2264 100\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\n|A \u2229 B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u222a B|\n\nTo maximize |A \u2229 B|, we need to minimize |A \u222a B|.\n\nSo, if |A \u222a B| = 75, then:\n\n|A \u2229 B| = 75 + 40 - 75 = 40\n\nIf |A \u222a B| is larger, say 80, then:\n\n|A \u2229 B| = 75 + 40 - 80 = 35\n\nWhich is less than 40.\n\nTherefore, the maximum |A \u2229 B| is 40, when |A \u222a B| is minimized to 75.\n\nThis confirms my earlier conclusion that the maximum number of people who could have both brown eyes and blonde hair is 40.\n\nIs there any other way to think about this?\n\nMaybe considering that 75 people have brown eyes and 40 have blonde hair, and the maximum overlap is limited by the smaller group, which is the blonde hair group.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider a Venn diagram, there are two circles overlapping, one for brown eyes and one for blonde hair.\n\nThe brown eyes circle has 75 people, the blonde hair circle has 40 people.\n\nThe overlap can be up to 40 people, as that's the entire blonde hair circle.\n\nIf the blonde hair circle is entirely within the brown eyes circle, then all 40 blonde-haired people also have brown eyes.\n\nSince the brown eyes circle can accommodate up to 75 people, having 40 of them also have blonde hair is possible.\n\nTherefore, the maximum overlap is 40 people.\n\nI think this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
