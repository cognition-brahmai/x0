Each stage of the plan will have an associated evidence value, which is the output from one of the available functions given an input string that could be the user's question, one or more previous evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nBing[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information using the Bing search engine. This tool is useful in finding a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question. The function doesn't directly answer the question; it finds a list of sites that might have the answer.\nWebCrawler[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nURLExtractor[input]: Extract URLs from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of URLs.\nNLPModel[input]: Natural Language Processing model that can answer questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a :evidence[n]: variable, e.g. What color is the cat, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2020 and what was their contribution?"
