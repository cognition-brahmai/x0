        "content": "Let's see. There's this snail in the bottom of a 12-foot well. Each day it climbs up 3 feet, but each night it slides back down 2 feet. I need to figure out how many days it will take for the snail to reach the top of the well.\n\nFirst, I should understand the net progress the snail makes each day. During the day, it climbs up 3 feet, but at night it slides back 2 feet. So, the net progress each day is 3 feet minus 2 feet, which is 1 foot per day.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's not that simple. Let's think about it step by step.\n\nOn day one, the snail climbs up 3 feet, but then slides back 2 feet at night, so at the end of the first day, it's actually 1 foot up from the bottom.\n\nOn day two, it again climbs up 3 feet from where it was, which would be from 1 foot to 4 feet, and then slides back 2 feet at night, ending up at 2 feet.\n\nHmm, this seems like a pattern. Each day it makes a net gain of 1 foot.\n\nSo, if the well is 12 feet deep, and it gains 1 foot per day, it would take 12 days to reach the top, right?\n\nBut let's think about that again. If it's gaining 1 foot per day, then on the 12th day, it would be at 12 feet. But wait, on each day, it climbs 3 feet during the day before sliding back 2 feet at night.\n\nSo, on the 12th day, when it climbs up 3 feet, it would reach 12 feet during the day, and then potentially slide back down 2 feet at night.\n\nBut if it reaches the top during the day, does it still slide back down? Probably not, because once it reaches the top, it's out of the well.\n\nSo, perhaps on the 12th day, when it climbs up 3 feet during the day, it reaches 12 feet and escapes before sliding back.\n\nBut wait, let's check that.\n\nLet's see, each day it climbs 3 feet during the day and slides back 2 feet at night, netting 1 foot per day.\n\nBut on the day it reaches or surpasses the 12-foot mark, it won't slide back, because it's out of the well.\n\nSo, I need to find out on which day it reaches or surpasses 12 feet during the daytime climb.\n\nLet's calculate it this way:\n\nEach day, it makes a net gain of 1 foot (3 feet up and 2 feet back).\n\nSo, after n days, it would have climbed n feet.\n\nBut that doesn't account for the fact that on the final day, it might climb out before sliding back.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that differently.\n\nLet's think about it like this: every day, it climbs up 3 feet, and then slides back 2 feet, netting 1 foot per day.\n\nBut on the final day, it climbs up 3 feet and doesn't slide back, because it's out of the well.\n\nSo, up to the day before the final day, it's making a net gain of 1 foot per day.\n\nOn the final day, it climbs up 3 feet without sliding back.\n\nSo, I need to find out how many days it takes for the snail to be at a point where, on the next day, it can climb up 3 feet and reach or surpass the 12-foot mark.\n\nLet's say that on day n-1, the snail is at a height where, on day n, it can climb up 3 feet and reach or surpass 12 feet.\n\nSo, on day n, it climbs up 3 feet from its position at the end of day n-1.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the height at the end of day n-1 as h.\n\nThen, on day n, it climbs to h + 3 feet, and since it doesn't slide back on that day because it's reached the top, we have h + 3 >= 12 feet.\n\nTherefore, h >= 9 feet.\n\nSo, at the end of day n-1, the snail must be at least 9 feet up the well.\n\nNow, since each day it makes a net gain of 1 foot, starting from 0 feet, we can calculate how many days it takes to reach at least 9 feet.\n\nSo, to reach 9 feet with a net gain of 1 foot per day, it would take 9 days.\n\nWait, but on day 9, it would be at 9 feet.\n\nBut actually, each day it starts at its current height, climbs up 3 feet during the day, and then slides back 2 feet at night, ending up 1 foot higher than the previous day.\n\nSo, after 9 days, it would be at 9 feet at the end of day 9.\n\nThen, on day 10, it climbs up 3 feet during the day, reaching 12 feet, and escapes without sliding back.\n\nTherefore, it takes 10 days for the snail to reach the top of the well.\n\nBut let's double-check that.\n\nAfter day 1: 1 foot\n\nAfter day 2: 2 feet\n\nAfter day 3: 3 feet\n\nAfter day 4: 4 feet\n\nAfter day 5: 5 feet\n\nAfter day 6: 6 feet\n\nAfter day 7: 7 feet\n\nAfter day 8: 8 feet\n\nAfter day 9: 9 feet\n\nAfter day 10: climbs up 3 feet to 12 feet and escapes.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the snail needing to reach a point where, on the next day, its climb during the day will take it to or past the 12-foot mark.\n\nSo, it needs to be at least 9 feet at the end of some day, so that on the next day, it can climb the remaining 3 feet and escape.\n\nAnd since it makes a net gain of 1 foot per day, it would take 9 days to reach 9 feet, and then one more day to climb up to 12 feet and escape.\n\nTherefore, the total number of days is 10.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
