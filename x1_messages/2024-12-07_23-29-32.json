        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to find out the daily profit, and then we can calculate the annual profit.\n\nSo, the factory produces 500 units per day. Each unit costs $20 to produce and is sold for $45. That means for each unit, the profit is the selling price minus the production cost.\n\nProfit per unit = Selling price - Production cost\nProfit per unit = $45 - $20 = $25\n\nNow, since the factory produces 500 units per day, the daily profit would be:\n\nDaily profit = Profit per unit * Number of units per day\nDaily profit = $25 * 500 = $12,500\n\nNext, to find the annual profit, we need to know how many days the factory operates in a year. Assuming it works 365 days a year, the annual profit would be:\n\nAnnual profit = Daily profit * Number of days in a year\nAnnual profit = $12,500 * 365\n\nNow, let's calculate that:\n\n$12,500 * 365 = $4,562,500\n\nSo, the factory generates a profit of $4,562,500 in one year.\n\nBut wait, maybe the factory doesn't operate every single day of the year. Sometimes factories have maintenance days or shut down for holidays. If that's the case, we should adjust the number of operating days accordingly.\n\nFor example, if the factory operates 300 days a year, then:\n\nAnnual profit = $12,500 * 300 = $3,750,000\n\nOr if it's 350 days:\n\nAnnual profit = $12,500 * 350 = $4,375,000\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify the number of operating days, I'll assume it's 365 days.\n\nAlso, we should consider other costs that might be involved, such as overhead costs, labor costs, etc. But based on the information provided, we only have the production cost per unit and the selling price per unit.\n\nTherefore, the annual profit is $4,562,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4562500} \\]"
