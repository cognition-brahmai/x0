Each plan should be associated with an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the functions given an input string that can be the user question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nBing[input]: A tool that allows the user to search for information on Bing. This tool is useful in finding a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts text from a website link and produces plain text containing the content of the link.\nLinkGatherer[input]: Gathers links from plain text and generates a plain text response of links.\nAIML[input]: An AI model capable of answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a :data[n]: variable, e.g., What color is the dog, given :data1:?\n\nThe function inputs should be plain strings without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., AIML[What is the capital of France, given :data3:?]\n\nEnsure only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nPlan: [first action based on input question]\n:data0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on result of :data0:]\n:data1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :data0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:data[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who is the author of the book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and what other books have they written?"
