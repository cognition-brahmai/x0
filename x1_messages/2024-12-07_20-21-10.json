        "content": "So there are 12 people in the room, and everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total. Hmm, this sounds like a problem about combinations, where the order doesn't matter.\n\nFirst, I know that combinations are used when the order of selection doesn't matter, which makes sense here because a handshake between John and Mary is the same as a handshake between Mary and John. So, it's not like permutations where the order matters.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n is 12, since there are 12 people, and k is 2, because a handshake involves two people.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: C(12, 2) = 12! / (2!(12 - 2)!) = (12!)/(2! * 10!\u201d.\n\nNow, I can simplify this. Since 12! is 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10!, and the 10! in the numerator and denominator will cancel out.\n\nSo, it becomes: (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10!) / (2! \u00d7 10!) = (12 \u00d7 11) / 2! = (12 \u00d7 11) / 2.\n\nAnd 2! is 2, so it's (12 \u00d7 11) / 2 = (132) / 2 = 66.\n\nTherefore, there will be 66 handshakes in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to think about it.\n\nAnother way is to consider that each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. So, for 12 people, the first person shakes hands with 11 others, the second person shakes hands with 10 remaining people (since they already shook hands with the first person), the third shakes hands with 9, and so on, until the last person, who doesn't need to shake hands with anyone because they already did.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be 11 + 10 + 9 + ... + 1.\n\nThis is an arithmetic series where the first term a1 is 11, the last term an is 1, and the number of terms is 11.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 \u00d7 (a1 + an), where n is the number of terms.\n\nSo, S = 11/2 \u00d7 (11 + 1) = (11/2) \u00d7 12 = 11 \u00d7 6 = 66.\n\nAgain, 66 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of graph theory, where each person is a vertex, and each handshake is an edge connecting two vertices. The problem then becomes finding the number of edges in a complete graph with 12 vertices.\n\nThe formula for the number of edges in a complete graph is E = n(n - 1)/2, where n is the number of vertices.\n\nSo, E = 12(12 - 1)/2 = 12 \u00d7 11 / 2 = 132 / 2 = 66.\n\nOnce again, 66 handshakes.\n\nI think I've confirmed it through three different methods: combinations, arithmetic series, and graph theory. All of them lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that 66 is the correct number of handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{66} \\]"
