        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of 100 people, and out of these, 30 are vegetarians. Among these vegetarians, 20% are men. We need to find out what percentage of the entire group consists of vegetarian men.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many vegetarian men there are. Since 20% of the vegetarians are men, and there are 30 vegetarians, I can calculate the number of vegetarian men by taking 20% of 30.\n\nLet me do that calculation:\n\n20% of 30 is (20/100) * 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6.\n\nSo, there are 6 vegetarian men in the group.\n\nNow, the entire group has 100 people. We need to find out what percentage 6 is of 100.\n\nThat's straightforward: (6 / 100) * 100% = 6%.\n\nTherefore, 6% of the entire group is made up of vegetarian men.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I didn't miss anything. We have 100 people in total, 30 are vegetarians, and among those vegetarians, 20% are men. So, 6 is the number of vegetarian men. To find the percentage of the entire group that is vegetarian men, I just need to find what percentage 6 is of 100, which is indeed 6%.\n\nI think that's correct. But maybe I should consider if there's another way to look at this to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the proportions directly. Since 30 out of 100 are vegetarians, that's 30%. And among vegetarians, 20% are men. So, the percentage of the entire group that is vegetarian men would be 20% of 30%.\n\nLet me calculate that: 20% of 30% is (20/100) * 30% = 0.2 * 30% = 6%.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, again, we get 6%.\n\nLet me think if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Sometimes, these percentage problems can be tricky, but in this case, it seems pretty straightforward.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the numbers again. Total people: 100. Vegetarians: 30. Vegetarian men: 20% of 30, which is 6. So, 6 vegetarian men out of 100 total people is indeed 6%.\n\nI don't see any other angles to this problem. It seems like a straightforward calculation.\n\nOne thing to ensure is that there are no errors in the calculations. Let's verify the math again.\n\nFirst calculation: 20% of 30.\n\n20% = 0.2, so 0.2 * 30 = 6. Correct.\n\nSecond calculation: (6 / 100) * 100% = 6%. Correct.\n\nAlternative approach: 20% of 30% = 6%. Correct.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that 6% is the correct answer.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. The percentage of the entire group that is made up of vegetarian men is 6%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6\\%} \\]"
