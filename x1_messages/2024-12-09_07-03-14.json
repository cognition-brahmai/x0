        "content": "So, in this classroom, there are 15 boys and 10 girls, making a total of 25 students. Each student has a bag, and inside each bag, there are 5 books. To find out the total number of books, I need to multiply the total number of students by the number of books each student has.\n\nFirst, I'll add the number of boys and girls to get the total number of students:\n\n15 boys + 10 girls = 25 students\n\nNext, since each student has 5 books, I'll multiply the total number of students by 5:\n\n25 students \u00d7 5 books/student = 125 books\n\nSo, there are 125 books in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way could be to calculate the total number of books for boys and girls separately and then add them together.\n\nFor boys:\n\n15 boys \u00d7 5 books/boy = 75 books\n\nFor girls:\n\n10 girls \u00d7 5 books/girl = 50 books\n\nNow, add the books from boys and girls:\n\n75 books + 50 books = 125 books\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, it seems like 125 is the correct total number of books.\n\nBut let's think about it again. Maybe there's a chance that some students share books or something like that. Does the problem say anything about shared books? No, it says each student has a bag with 5 books inside. So, each student has their own 5 books.\n\nAlso, it's important to make sure that I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let's do the math again.\n\n15 + 10 = 25 students\n\n25 \u00d7 5 = 125 books\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each student has a bag with 5 books, then the total number of books is simply the number of students multiplied by the number of books per student.\n\nNumber of students = 15 boys + 10 girls = 25 students\n\nNumber of books per student = 5\n\nTotal books = 25 \u00d7 5 = 125\n\nI think that's straightforward.\n\nMaybe I can think about it in terms of groups. For example, the group of boys has 15 students, each with 5 books, and the group of girls has 10 students, each with 5 books.\n\nSo, for the boys:\n\n15 students \u00d7 5 books/student = 75 books\n\nFor the girls:\n\n10 students \u00d7 5 books/student = 50 books\n\nTotal books = 75 + 50 = 125 books\n\nThis is consistent with my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as each student having 5 books, so the total number of books is 5 times the number of students.\n\nTotal students = 25\n\nTotal books = 5 \u00d7 25 = 125 books\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough. The total number of books is 125.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem.\n\nIs there any possibility that the books are shared among students or that some students have more or fewer books? The problem states that each student has a bag with 5 books inside, so it's clear that each student has exactly 5 books.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the problem specifies \"inside each bag, there are 5 books,\" which means that every bag contains exactly 5 books, and each student has one bag.\n\nTherefore, there's no variation in the number of books per student.\n\nSo, the calculation is straightforward: total students multiplied by books per student.\n\nTotal students = 15 boys + 10 girls = 25 students\n\nBooks per student = 5\n\nTotal books = 25 \u00d7 5 = 125\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I'll do the multiplication again.\n\n25 \u00d7 5:\n\n20 \u00d7 5 = 100\n\n5 \u00d7 5 = 25\n\n100 + 25 = 125\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of addition.\n\nIf each student has 5 books, then adding 5 books for each of the 25 students:\n\n5 + 5 + 5 + ... + 5 (25 times) = 125\n\nBut that would take a while, so multiplication is faster.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that 25 students each have 5 books, it's the same as 5 groups of 25 books.\n\n5 \u00d7 25 = 125\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple ways. The total number of books is definitely 125.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{125} \\]"
