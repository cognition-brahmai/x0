        "content": "So I have this problem here about a cylindrical water tank. It says the diameter is 2 meters and the height is 5 meters, and I need to find its volume in cubic meters. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the volume of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( V \\) is the volume,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the base,\n\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder,\n\n- and \\( \\pi \\) is approximately 3.1416.\n\nSo, I need to find the radius from the given diameter. The diameter is 2 meters, and I know that the radius is half of the diameter. Therefore:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{2 \\, \\text{meters}}{2} = 1 \\, \\text{meter} \\]\n\nNow, I can plug the values into the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi (1 \\, \\text{meter})^2 \\times 5 \\, \\text{meters} \\]\n\nCalculating the square of the radius:\n\n\\[ (1 \\, \\text{meter})^2 = 1 \\, \\text{square meter} \\]\n\nSo, the volume becomes:\n\n\\[ V = 3.1416 \\times 1 \\, \\text{square meter} \\times 5 \\, \\text{meters} = 15.708 \\, \\text{cubic meters} \\]\n\nWait a minute, but I should be more precise with the value of \\( \\pi \\). Sometimes, problems expect you to use a specific value for \\( \\pi \\), but since it's not specified here, I'll stick with 3.1416.\n\nAlternatively, I can leave the answer in terms of \\( \\pi \\). So, the volume would be:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi \\times 1^2 \\times 5 = 5\\pi \\, \\text{cubic meters} \\]\n\nBut since the question asks for the volume in cubic meters, I should probably provide a numerical value. So, using \\( \\pi \\approx 3.1416 \\):\n\n\\[ V \\approx 5 \\times 3.1416 = 15.708 \\, \\text{cubic meters} \\]\n\nHmm, but I think I can make it more precise. Let me use \\( \\pi \\approx 3.1415926535 \\):\n\n\\[ V \\approx 5 \\times 3.1415926535 = 15.7079632675 \\, \\text{cubic meters} \\]\n\nBut that might be overkill. Usually, rounding to three decimal places is acceptable, so 15.708 cubic meters should be fine.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, diameter is 2 meters, so radius is 1 meter.\n\nThen, height is 5 meters.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h = \\pi \\times 1^2 \\times 5 = 5\\pi \\]\n\nUsing \\( \\pi \\approx 3.1416 \\), \\( V \\approx 15.708 \\) cubic meters.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the area of the base, which is a circle with radius 1 meter:\n\n\\[ A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\times 1^2 = \\pi \\, \\text{square meters} \\]\n\nThen, the volume is the area of the base times the height:\n\n\\[ V = A \\times h = \\pi \\times 5 = 5\\pi \\, \\text{cubic meters} \\]\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The volume of the cylindrical water tank is approximately 15.708 cubic meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15.708} \\]"
