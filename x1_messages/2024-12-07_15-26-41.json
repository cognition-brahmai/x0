        "content": "So there are 50 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes occur in total. Hmm, this seems like a problem about combinations, where order doesn't matter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. Each handshake is between two people, and it doesn't matter who initiates the handshake; it's the same handshake either way. So, it's not about permutations where order matters, but about combinations where order doesn't.\n\nI recall that the formula for combinations is given by:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the total number of items,\n\n- k is the number of items to choose,\n\n- \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nIn this case, n is 50 (the total number of people), and k is 2 (since a handshake involves two people).\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes should be C(50, 2).\n\nLet me plug in the values:\n\nC(50, 2) = 50! / (2!(50 - 2)!) = (50!)/(2! * 48!)\n\nNow, calculating 50! (50 factorial) would be a huge number, but I notice that in the fraction, 50! divided by 48! simplifies because 50! is 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48!.\n\nSo, C(50, 2) = (50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48!)/(2! \u00d7 48!)\r\n\r\nThe 48! terms cancel out:\n\n= (50 \u00d7 49)/(2!)\n\nAnd 2! is 2 \u00d7 1 = 2.\n\nSo, it becomes:\n\n= (50 \u00d7 49)/2\n\nNow, multiplying 50 and 49 gives 2450.\n\nThen, dividing by 2:\n\n2450 / 2 = 1225\n\nTherefore, there are 1225 handshakes in total.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this to confirm? Maybe using the concept of graph theory, where each person is a node and each handshake is an edge connecting two nodes. In that case, the number of edges in a complete graph with n nodes is also given by C(n, 2), which again is n(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=50:\n\nNumber of edges (handshakes) = 50 \u00d7 49 / 2 = 1225\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it sequentially. The first person shakes hands with 49 other people. The second person has already shaken hands with the first, so they shake hands with 48 remaining people. The third has already shaken hands with the first two, so they shake hands with 47 people, and so on, until the last person, who has already shaken hands with everyone else, so they shake no new hands.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be:\n\n49 + 48 + 47 + ... + 1\n\nThis is an arithmetic series where the first term a1 is 49, the last term an is 1, and the number of terms is 49.\n\nThe sum S of an arithmetic series is given by:\n\nS = n/2 \u00d7 (a1 + an)\n\nWhere n is the number of terms.\n\nSo, S = 49/2 \u00d7 (49 + 1) = (49 \u00d7 50)/2 = 1225\n\nAgain, that's 1225 handshakes.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that each person shakes hands with 49 others, and there are 50 people, so initially, it seems like there would be 50 \u00d7 49 = 2450 handshakes. However, this counts each handshake twice (once for each participant), so to get the actual number of unique handshakes, we need to divide by 2.\n\nSo, 2450 / 2 = 1225.\n\nOnce again, 1225 handshakes.\n\nAll these different approaches lead me to the same conclusion, which gives me confidence that 1225 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1225} \\]"
