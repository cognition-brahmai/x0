        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a tree that doubles its height every year, and after 5 years, it's 32 meters tall. We need to find out how tall it was originally, right at the start.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the tree to double its height every year. If the tree is, say, 1 meter tall in the first year, then in the second year, it would be 2 meters, in the third year 4 meters, and so on. It's like multiplying the height by 2 each year.\n\nSo, if we let the original height be some value, let's say h, then:\n\n- After 1 year: h * 2\n\n- After 2 years: h * 2 * 2 = h * 4\n\n- After 3 years: h * 2 * 2 * 2 = h * 8\n\n- After 4 years: h * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = h * 16\n\n- After 5 years: h * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = h * 32\n\nWait a minute, that seems off. Because 2 raised to the power of 5 is 32, so after 5 years, the height should be h multiplied by 32.\n\nBut the problem says that after 5 years, the tree is 32 meters tall. So, according to this, h * 32 = 32 meters.\n\nTo find the original height h, I can simply divide both sides by 32:\n\nh = 32 meters / 32 = 1 meter.\n\nSo, the original height of the tree was 1 meter.\n\nBut let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nIf the tree starts at 1 meter and doubles every year:\n\n- Year 1: 1 * 2 = 2 meters\n\n- Year 2: 2 * 2 = 4 meters\n\n- Year 3: 4 * 2 = 8 meters\n\n- Year 4: 8 * 2 = 16 meters\n\n- Year 5: 16 * 2 = 32 meters\n\nYes, that matches the information given in the problem. So, the original height was indeed 1 meter.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this in terms of exponential growth. The height of the tree can be modeled by the equation:\n\nHeight = original height * 2^(number of years)\n\nSo, 32 = h * 2^5\n\nAgain, solving for h: h = 32 / 32 = 1 meter.\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. The key is understanding that the tree doubles its height each year, which means multiplying the original height by 2 raised to the power of the number of years.\n\nIt's important to note that the tree doubles at the end of each year. So, at the beginning of the first year, it's h meters, and at the end of the first year, it becomes 2h meters, and so on.\n\nAlso, it's worth considering if there's any other factor that might affect the height, but the problem seems straightforward, with no additional complications mentioned.\n\nSo, the original height of the tree was 1 meter.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
