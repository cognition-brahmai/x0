Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home? Why are you breathless, and why stare you so?\nCASCA. Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero, I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds Have rived the knotty oaks; and I have seen Th' ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam, To be exalted with the threatening clouds: But never till tonight, never till now, Did I go through a tempest dropping fire. Either there is a civil strife in heaven, Or else the world too saucy with the gods, Incenses them to send destruction.\nCICERO. Why, saw you anything more wonderful?\nCASCA. A common slave--you'd know him well by sight-- Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand Not sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd. Besides,--I ha' not since put up my sword,-- Against the Capitol I met a lion, Who glared upon me, and went surly by, Without annoying me: and there were drawn Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women, Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw Men, all in fire, walk up and down the streets. And yesterday the bird of night did sit Even at noonday upon the marketplace, Howling and shrieking. When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet, let not men say \"These are their reasons; they are natural\"; For I believe they are portentous things Unto the climate that they point upon.\nCICERO. Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time. But men may construe things after their fashion, Clean from the purpose of the things themselves. Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?\nCASCA. He doth, for he did bid Antonius Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.\nCICERO. Good then, Casca: this disturbed sky Is not to walk in.\nCASCA. Farewell, Cicero.\n[Exit Cicero.]\n[Enter Cassius.]\nCASSIUS. Who's there?\nCASCA. A Roman.\nCASSIUS. Casca, by your voice.\nCASCA. Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!\nCASSIUS. A very pleasing night to honest men.\nCASCA. Who ever knew the heavens menace so?\nCASSIUS. Those that have known the earth so full of faults. For my part, I have walk'd about the streets, Submitting me unto the perilous night; And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see, Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone; And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open The breast of heaven, I did present myself Even in the aim and very flash of it.\nCASCA. But wherefore did you so much tempt the Heavens? It is the part of men to fear and tremble, When the most mighty gods by tokens send Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.\nCASSIUS. You are dull, Casca;and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you do want, Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze, And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder, To see the strange impatience of the Heavens: But if you would consider the true cause Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts, Why birds and beasts,from quality and kind; Why old men, fools, and children calculate;-- Why all these things change from their ordinance, Their natures, and preformed faculties To monstrous quality;--why, you shall find That Heaven hath infused them with these spirits, To make them instruments of fear and warning Unto some monstrous state. Now could I, Casca, Name to thee a man most like this dreadful night; That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars, As doth the lion in the Capitol; A man no mightier than thyself or me In personal action; yet prodigious grown, And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.\nCASCA. 'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?\nCASSIUS. Let it be who it is: for Romans now Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors; But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead, And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits; Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.\nCASCA. Indeed they say the senators to-morrow Mean to establish Caesar as a king; And he shall wear his crown by sea and land, In every place save here in Italy.\nCASSIUS. I know where I will wear this dagger then; Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius: Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong; Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat: Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass, Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron Can be retentive to the strength of spirit; But life, being weary of these worldly bars, Never lacks power to dismiss itself. If I know this, know all the world besides, That part of tyranny that I do bear I can shake off at pleasure.\n[Thunders still.]\nCASCA. So can I: So every bondman in his own hand bears The power to cancel his captivity.\nCASSIUS. And why should Caesar be a tyrant then? Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf, But that he sees the Romans are but sheep: He were no lion, were not Romans hinds. Those that with haste will make a mighty fire Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome, What rubbish, and what offal, when it serves For the base matter to illuminate So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief, Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this Before a willing bondman: then I know My answer must be made; but I am arm'd, And dangers are to me indifferent.\nCASCA. You speak to Casca; and to such a man That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand: Be factious for redress of all these griefs; And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthest.\nCASSIUS. There's a bargain made. Now know you, Casca, I have moved already Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans To undergo with me an enterprise Of honorable-dangerous consequence; And I do know by this, they stay for me In Pompey's Porch: for now, this fearful night, There is no stir or walking in the streets; And the complexion of the element Is favor'd like the work we have in hand, Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.\nCASCA. Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.\nCASSIUS. 'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait; He is a friend.--\n[Enter Cinna.]\nCinna, where haste you so?\nCINNA. To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?\nCASSIUS. No, it is Casca, one incorporate To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?\nCINNA. I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this! There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.\nCASSIUS. Am I not stay'd for? tell me.\nCINNA. Yes, You are. O Cassius, if you could but win The noble Brutus to our party,--\nCASSIUS. Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper, And look you lay it in the praetor's chair, Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this In at his window; set this up with wax Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done, Repair to Pompey's Porch, where you shall find us. Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?\nCINNA. All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie And so bestow these papers as you bade me.\nCASSIUS. That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.--\n[Exit Cinna.]\nCome, Casca, you and I will yet, ere day, See Brutus at his house: three parts of him Is ours already; and the man entire, Upon the next encounter, yields him ours.\nCASCA. O, he sits high in all the people's hearts! And that which would appear offense in us, His countenance, like richest alchemy, Will change to virtue and to worthiness.\nCASSIUS. Him, and his worth, and our great need of him, You have right well conceited. Let us go, For it is after midnight; and, ere day, We will awake him, and be sure of him.\n[Exeunt.]\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 600 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"

        "content": "I've read through this scene from Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar,\" and I need to summarize it in about 600 words. Let's see. This is Scene III of Act I, set in a street during a thunderstorm. The scene begins with Casca and Cicero encountering each other, both apparently shaken by the violent weather.\n\nCasca seems particularly disturbed, mentioning that he's seen unusual events tonight: a slave's hand on fire without being burned, a lion in the street, and women claiming to have seen fiery men walking the streets. He also mentions that an owl was seen in the marketplace at noon, which is unnerving because owls are nocturnal. Casca believes these are portentous signs, suggesting that something dire is about to happen.\n\nCicero responds philosophically, noting that people interpret events according to their own perspectives, not necessarily according to the events' true meanings. He asks Casca if Caesar is coming to the Capitol tomorrow, to which Casca confirms that Antonius has been instructed to tell Cicero as much.\n\nCicero then decides it's not safe to be out in such turbulent times and bids farewell to Casca. As Cicero exits, Cassius enters and engages Casca in conversation. Cassius seems to be using the chaotic weather and the strange occurrences to stir Casca's emotions and perhaps to recruit him into his plot against Caesar.\n\nCassius suggests that the heavens are warning them of a \"monstrous state,\" implying the impending tyranny of Caesar. He draws a parallel between the disturbed heavens and the moral decay of Rome, suggesting that Romans have become weak and subservient, like their mothers, rather than maintaining the strength and independence of their ancestors.\n\nCasca mentions that there's talk of the Senate planning to crown Caesar as king the next day, which Casca seems to view negatively. Cassius seizes on this, expressing his distaste for the idea of Caesar as a tyrant and suggesting that Caesar only behaves like a tyrant because Romans are meek and submissive, like sheep.\n\nCassius then makes a soliloquy about how he could end his own life if he wanted, implying that freedom from tyranny is a matter of personal resolve. He seems to be goading Casca into action, suggesting that they can overthrow Caesar if they act together.\n\nCasca responds positively, saying that every slave holds the power to free himself, indicating his willingness to join Cassius's cause. Cassius then outlines a plan that involves enlisting other noble Romans in their enterprise against Caesar. He mentions that some have already been approached and are waiting for him at Pompey's Porch.\n\nJust then, Cinna enters, and Cassius recognizes him. Cinna is also involved in their conspiracy and has come to find Cassius. He mentions that they have all seen strange sights tonight, likely referring to the supernatural phenomena Casca earlier described.\n\nCassius asks if he is expected at Pompey's Porch, and Cinna confirms it, also suggesting that if Brutus could be won over to their cause, it would greatly strengthen their position. Cassius reassures him and gives Cinna papers to place in Brutus's chair and at his window, as well as to affix to Brutus's statue, presumably persuasive letters or messages meant to influence Brutus to join their cause.\n\nAfter Cinna leaves, Cassius and Casca decide to go to Brutus's house to convince him to join their conspiracy against Caesar. Cassius is confident that they already have a significant part of Brutus on their side and that with a little more persuasion, they can win him completely.\n\nCasca expresses his admiration for Brutus, saying that he is held in high esteem by the people, and that anything that might seem offensive coming from others would be viewed as virtuous coming from Brutus. This suggests that Brutus's reputation and character are such that he could lend legitimacy to their cause.\n\nCassius agrees and expresses his belief that they have a good understanding of Brutus's worth and their urgent need for his support. They plan to visit Brutus before dawn to enlist his aid in their plot.\n\nSo, in summary, this scene sets the stage for the conspirators' plan to assassinate Caesar, using the chaotic and supernatural events of the night to justify and intensify their resolve. Cassius is portrayed as a key figure in orchestrating the conspiracy, and Brutus is identified as a crucial ally whose\u52a0\u5165 would greatly strengthen their cause.\n\n## Final Summary\nIn this scene from Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar,\" Act I, Scene III, the stage is set in a street during a thunderstorm, symbolizing the political turbulence in Rome. The scene opens with Casca and Cicero discussing the ominous weather and unusual events Casca has witnessed, which he believes are portents of impending disaster. These include a slave's hand on fire without being burned, a lion in the street, and women claiming to have seen fiery men walking the streets. Cicero responds philosophically, suggesting that people interpret events based on their own perspectives rather than the events' intrinsic meanings.\n\nCassius enters and engages Casca, using the chaotic weather and strange occurrences to stir emotions and recruit Casca into his plot against Caesar. Cassius implies that the disturbances are warnings of Caesar's impending tyranny and that Romans have become weak and subservient. Casca mentions that the Senate plans to crown Caesar as king the next day, which he views negatively. Cassius expresses his distaste for Caesar as a tyrant, suggesting that Caesar behaves tyrannically because Romans are meek.\n\nCassius makes a soliloquy about the power of the human spirit to overcome tyranny and even end one's own life if necessary. He goads Casca into action, suggesting they can overthrow Caesar together. Casca responds positively, indicating his willingness to join the cause. Cinna enters and confirms that other conspirators are waiting for Cassius at Pompey's Porch. He also suggests that winning Brutus over to their cause would greatly strengthen their position.\n\nCassius gives Cinna papers to place where Brutus will find them, aiming to persuade Brutus to join their conspiracy. After Cinna leaves, Cassius and Casca decide to visit Brutus's house before dawn to enlist his support. They believe that Brutus's reputation and character can lend legitimacy to their cause and that with his\u52a0\u5165, their plan to assassinate Caesar will be greatly strengthened.\n\nThis scene highlights Cassius's role as the instigator of the conspiracy and emphasizes the importance of Brutus's support in their plan. The supernatural events and the chaotic weather serve to heighten the sense of foreboding and justify the conspirators' actions in the minds of both characters and audience."
