        "content": "So there are 20 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total.\n\nFirst, I think about smaller numbers to understand the pattern. Let's say there are 2 people in the room. Person A and Person B. They would shake hands once. So, with 2 people, there's 1 handshake.\n\nNow, if there are 3 people: Person A, B, and C. A shakes hands with B, A shakes hands with C, and B shakes hands with C. That's 3 handshakes.\n\nWith 4 people: A, B, C, and D. A shakes hands with B, C, and D (that's 3 handshakes). B already shook hands with A, so B shakes hands with C and D (2 more handshakes). C already shook hands with A and B, so C shakes hands with D (1 more handshake). Total is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 handshakes.\n\nI see a pattern here. With each additional person, they shake hands with everyone who is already in the room, but since those handshakes have already been counted, we only add the new handshakes.\n\nSo, for 20 people, I can think of it as the sum of the first 19 natural numbers because the first person shakes hands with 19 others, the second with 18 (since they've already shaken hands with the first), and so on, down to the last person who has no one left to shake hands with.\n\nWait, but in my earlier examples, with 4 people, it was 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. So, for n people, it's the sum from 1 to n-1.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that the number of handshakes in a group of n people is given by the combination formula C(n, 2), which is n(n-1)/2.\n\nLet me verify that with my earlier examples. For n=2, C(2,2) = 1. For n=3, C(3,2)=3. For n=4, C(4,2)=6. That matches what I found earlier.\n\nSo, for 20 people, the number of handshakes would be C(20,2) = 20*19/2 = 190.\n\nBut let me double-check. If each of the 20 people shakes hands with 19 others, that would be 20*19 = 380 handshakes. But each handshake is being counted twice that way, once for each participant, so I need to divide by 2 to get the actual number of unique handshakes.\n\nYes, so 380 divided by 2 is indeed 190.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the formula for the sum of the first n-1 natural numbers. For n=20, sum from 1 to 19 is (19*20)/2 = 190.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that there are 190 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{190} \\]"
