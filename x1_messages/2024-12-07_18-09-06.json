        "content": "So the zoo is planning this new bird exhibit with three sections: tropical birds, waterfowl, and birds of prey. Each type needs different space: 200 sq ft per tropical bird, 300 sq ft per waterfowl, and 400 sq ft per bird of prey. Total space allocated is 20,000 sq ft. We need to figure out how many of each type can be accommodated while keeping a balanced representation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"balanced representation\" means. Maybe it means having roughly the same number of each type of bird, or perhaps it's about having a diversity that represents the different habitats or something like that. Since it's not specified, I'll assume it means having an equal number of each type of bird.\n\nLet's denote the number of tropical birds as T, waterfowl as W, and birds of prey as P. If we assume T = W = P, then we can set up an equation based on the space they require.\n\nSpace required for tropical birds: 200T\nSpace required for waterfowl: 300W\nSpace required for birds of prey: 400P\n\nTotal space: 200T + 300W + 400P = 20,000 sq ft\n\nSince T = W = P, let's say each is equal to X. So:\n\n200X + 300X + 400X = 20,000\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n900X = 20,000\n\nNow, solve for X:\n\nX = 20,000 / 900 = 22.222...\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a bird, we'll have to round down to 22 birds per category.\n\nLet's check the total space used:\n\n200*22 + 300*22 + 400*22 = 4,400 + 6,600 + 8,800 = 19,800 sq ft\n\nThat leaves 20,000 - 19,800 = 200 sq ft unused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can accommodate one more bird in one category. If we add one more tropical bird:\n\nT = 23, W = 22, P = 22\n\nSpace: 200*23 + 300*22 + 400*22 = 4,600 + 6,600 + 8,800 = 20,000 sq ft\n\nThat fits perfectly. Similarly, if we add one more waterfowl:\n\nT = 22, W = 23, P = 22\n\nSpace: 200*22 + 300*23 + 400*22 = 4,400 + 6,900 + 8,800 = 20,100 sq ft\n\nThat's 100 sq ft over. So that doesn't work.\n\nWhat if we add one more bird of prey:\n\nT = 22, W = 22, P = 23\n\nSpace: 200*22 + 300*22 + 400*23 = 4,400 + 6,600 + 9,200 = 20,200 sq ft\n\nThat's 200 sq ft over, which is not acceptable.\n\nSo, the only way to use the entire 20,000 sq ft while keeping the numbers as balanced as possible is to have 23 tropical birds, 22 waterfowl, and 22 birds of prey.\n\nBut maybe there are other combinations that also provide a balanced representation without having exactly the same number in each category.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"balanced representation\" means having the same number of each type of bird, in which case, sticking with 22 of each would be acceptable, leaving 200 sq ft unused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe balanced representation means having proportions that reflect their importance or something like that. But since that's not specified, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zoo has specific numbers in mind for each category based on species conservation status or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zoo wants to maximize the total number of birds, or maximize the number of species, or something like that.\n\nBut based on the information given, assuming balanced means equal numbers, then 23 tropical birds, 22 waterfowl, and 22 birds of prey seems to be the optimal solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zoo wants to prioritize certain types of birds over others. For example, maybe they want more birds of prey because they are more popular with visitors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have specific species in mind and know how much space those species need.\n\nBut again, since that information isn't provided, I'll stick with the assumption of equal numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"balanced representation\" means that the space allocated to each category is the same.\n\nIf that's the case, then each category would get 20,000 / 3 \u2248 6,666.67 sq ft.\n\nThen, for tropical birds: 6,666.67 / 200 = 33.333, so 33 tropical birds\n\nFor waterfowl: 6,666.67 / 300 \u2248 22.222, so 22 waterfowl\n\nFor birds of prey: 6,666.67 / 400 \u2248 16.666, so 16 birds of prey\n\nBut that's not really equal representation in terms of numbers, but equal in terms of space.\n\nTotal birds: 33 + 22 + 16 = 71 birds\n\nAlternatively, if we allocate space proportionally based on the space each type needs, that might be another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zoo has specific goals or constraints that aren't mentioned here.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to provide multiple options.\n\nOption 1: Equal number of each type\n\n- 23 tropical birds (200*23 = 4,600 sq ft)\n\n- 22 waterfowl (300*22 = 6,600 sq ft)\n\n- 22 birds of prey (400*22 = 8,800 sq ft)\n\nTotal: 20,000 sq ft\n\nOption 2: Equal space for each category\n\n- Tropical birds: 6,666.67 / 200 \u2248 33 birds (6,600 sq ft)\n\n- Waterfowl: 6,666.67 / 300 \u2248 22 birds (6,600 sq ft)\n\n- Birds of prey: 6,666.67 / 400 \u2248 16 birds (6,400 sq ft)\n\nTotal space used: 6,600 + 6,600 + 6,400 = 19,600 sq ft\n\nLeave 400 sq ft unused\n\nOption 3: Maximize total number of birds\n\nTo maximize the number of birds, we should allocate more space to birds that require less space per individual. In this case, tropical birds require the least space (200 sq ft), followed by waterfowl (300 sq ft), and then birds of prey (400 sq ft).\n\nSo, to maximize the number of birds, we should have as many tropical birds as possible, then waterfowl, and finally birds of prey.\n\nLet's assume we allocate all 20,000 sq ft to tropical birds:\n\n20,000 / 200 = 100 tropical birds\n\nBut that's not balanced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps allocate minimal space to birds of prey and waterfowl to maximize the number of tropical birds.\n\nBut again, that wouldn't be balanced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use linear programming to maximize the total number of birds subject to the space constraints and some balance requirements.\n\nBut without a clear definition of \"balanced representation,\" it's challenging to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zoo wants to have a minimum number of each type of bird.\n\nFor example, at least 20 of each type.\n\nThen, allocate the remaining space accordingly.\n\nFor example:\n\nTropical birds: 20 * 200 = 4,000 sq ft\n\nWaterfowl: 20 * 300 = 6,000 sq ft\n\nBirds of prey: 20 * 400 = 8,000 sq ft\n\nTotal: 18,000 sq ft\n\nRemaining space: 2,000 sq ft\n\nThen, allocate the remaining space to additional birds.\n\nSince tropical birds require the least space, we can add more of them.\n\n2,000 / 200 = 10 additional tropical birds\n\nTotal:\n\n- Tropical birds: 20 + 10 = 30\n\n- Waterfowl: 20\n\n- Birds of prey: 20\n\nTotal birds: 70\n\nAlternatively, maybe allocate the remaining space to add more of each type proportionally.\n\nBut again, without a clear definition of \"balanced representation,\" it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zoo has specific educational or conservation goals that dictate the number of each type of bird.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to suggest that the zoo decides on the priority or the desired number for each category and then allocate space accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps provide a range for each type based on the space requirements.\n\nFor example:\n\nLet T be the number of tropical birds,\n\nW be the number of waterfowl,\n\nP be the number of birds of prey.\n\nThen,\n\n200T + 300W + 400P = 20,000\n\nAssuming T, W, P are positive integers.\n\nWe can solve for one variable in terms of the others.\n\nFor example, solve for P:\n\nP = (20,000 - 200T - 300W) / 400\n\nP = 50 - 0.5T - 0.75W\n\nSince P must be an integer, 0.5T + 0.75W must be an integer.\n\nAlternatively, multiply through by 4 to eliminate decimals:\n\n4P = 200 - 2T - 3W\n\nSo, 2T + 3W must be even, or some other condition to make 4P an integer.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set limits based on the space each type requires.\n\nFor example, the maximum number of tropical birds is 20,000 / 200 = 100\n\nSimilarly, maximum waterfowl is 20,000 / 300 \u2248 66\n\nAnd maximum birds of prey is 20,000 / 400 = 50\n\nThen, find combinations within these limits that satisfy the space constraint.\n\nBut again, without a clear definition of \"balanced representation,\" it's challenging to provide a specific answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"balanced representation\" means that the number of each type of bird should be within a certain ratio of each other.\n\nFor example, the number of tropical birds should not exceed the number of waterfowl by more than a certain factor, and so on.\n\nBut since that's not specified, I'll stick with the initial approach.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is Option 1: 23 tropical birds, 22 waterfowl, and 22 birds of prey, using the entire 20,000 sq ft allocated space while keeping the numbers as balanced as possible.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{23 \\text{ tropical birds},\\ 22 \\text{ waterfowl},\\ 22 \\text{ birds of prey}} \\]"
