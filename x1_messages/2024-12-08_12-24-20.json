        "content": "So if a car gets 30 miles per gallon and has a 15-gallon fuel tank, to find out how far it can travel on a full tank before needing to refuel, I guess I just need to multiply the miles per gallon by the number of gallons in the tank.\n\nSo that would be 30 miles/gallon times 15 gallons. The gallons unit cancels out, leaving miles. So 30 times 15 is 450. So the car can travel 450 miles on a full tank.\n\nBut wait, is there anything else I should consider? Like, is the fuel tank capacity always exactly 15 gallons, or is there sometimes less because of the design of the tank? I think most cars have a fuel tank that holds a little more than the stated capacity to account for fuel expansion or something, but for this problem, I think assuming the tank holds exactly 15 gallons is fine.\n\nAlso, the mileage might not always be exactly 30 miles per gallon in real-world driving conditions. It could vary based on how you drive, the speed, traffic conditions, etc. But since this is a theoretical question, I'll stick with the given mileage.\n\nSo, my final answer is 450 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{450} \\]"
