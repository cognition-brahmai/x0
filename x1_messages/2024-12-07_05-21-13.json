        "content": "So if 5 apples cost $2, then to find out how much 15 apples would cost, I can probably just figure out the cost per apple and then multiply by 15. Let me see.\n\nFirst, the cost for 5 apples is $2, so the cost per apple would be $2 divided by 5, right? That would be $0.40 per apple.\n\nNow, if I want to buy 15 apples, I'd multiply the cost per apple by 15. So, $0.40 times 15.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 0.40 times 15 is, let's see, 0.40 times 10 is $4.00, and 0.40 times 5 is $2.00, so total $6.00.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me check another way. If 5 apples cost $2, then 15 apples are three times that amount, because 15 divided by 5 is 3. So, 3 times $2 would be $6.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier. So, it should cost $6 to buy 15 apples.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a discount for buying more apples. The problem doesn't say anything about that, so I'll assume it's a straightforward proportion.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up a proportion: 5 apples is to $2 as 15 apples is to x dollars.\n\nSo, 5/$2 = 15/x or 5:2 = 15:x.\n\nWait, actually, it's better to set it up as apples over cost: 5/x = 15/$2.\n\nNo, wait, I think I'm confusing the terms.\n\nLet me think again. If 5 apples cost $2, then the price per apple is $2/5 = $0.40.\n\nThen, for 15 apples, it's 15 times $0.40, which is $6.\n\nAlternatively, since 15 is three times 5, the cost should be three times $2, which is $6.\n\nI think that's consistent. So, the answer should be $6.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, maybe I can think of it in another way.\n\nSuppose I buy 5 apples for $2 three times, that would give me 15 apples for $6.\n\nUnless there's a bulk discount, but again, the problem doesn't mention any discounts.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that 15 apples would cost $6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
