        "content": "Let's see. The farmer has 120 acres of land in total. He plants corn on 40% of the land. So first, I need to find out how many acres are used for corn.\n\nTo find 40% of 120 acres, I can calculate:\n\n40% of 120 = (40/100) * 120 = 0.4 * 120 = 48 acres\n\nSo, 48 acres are planted with corn.\n\nNow, the remaining land after planting corn would be:\n\nTotal land - Corn land = 120 - 48 = 72 acres\n\nNext, the farmer plants soybeans on 30% of the remaining land. So, I need to find 30% of 72 acres.\n\n30% of 72 = (30/100) * 72 = 0.3 * 72 = 21.6 acres\n\nSo, 21.6 acres are planted with soybeans.\n\nNow, to find the unplanted land, I need to subtract both the corn and soybean lands from the total land.\n\nUnplanted land = Total land - Corn land - Soybean land\n\n= 120 - 48 - 21.6\n\n= 50.4 acres\n\nTherefore, 50.4 acres are left unplanted.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50.4} \\]"
