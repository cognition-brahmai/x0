        "content": "I'd be happy to help you with that! There are several types of beaches around the world, each offering unique experiences for visitors. Here, I'll describe four main types: sandy, rocky, pebble, and coral beaches, and provide a popular destination for each.\n\n1. **Sandy Beaches**: These are the most familiar type, featuring soft, golden sands that stretch along coastlines. Sandy beaches are ideal for sunbathing, building sandcastles, and relaxing. One of the most famous sandy beaches is **Copacabana Beach** in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It's known for its vibrant atmosphere, bustling boardwalk, and the iconic New Year's Eve celebrations.\n\n2. **Rocky Beaches**: Characterized by large rocks and boulders, these beaches offer a different kind of experience. Rocky beaches are great for exploring tidal pools, fishing, and enjoying scenic views. A popular example is **Black Rock Beach** in Big Sur, California, USA. Known for its dramatic cliffs and rugged beauty, it's a favorite among hikers and nature lovers.\n\n3. **Pebble Beaches**: These beaches feature small stones or pebbles instead of sand. They can be comfortable to walk on and offer a unique texture underfoot. **Porthminster Beach** in Cornwall, England, is a beautiful pebble beach surrounded by cliffs and offering stunning sea views. It's a popular spot for surfing and swimming.\n\n4. **Coral Beaches**: Found in tropical regions, coral beaches are formed from the breakdown of coral reefs. These beaches often have clear, turquoise waters and are perfect for snorkeling and diving to explore the vibrant marine life. **Whitehaven Beach** in the Whitsunday Islands, Australia, is renowned for its pure white silica sand and crystal-clear waters, making it a must-visit for nature enthusiasts.\n\nEach of these beach types offers a distinct experience, from the relaxation of sandy shores to the adventure of exploring rocky coastlines. Whether you're seeking sunshine, adventure, or simply a place to unwind, there's a beach out there perfect for you."
