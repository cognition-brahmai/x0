        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are 53 socks in a drawer: 21 blue, 15 black, and 17 red. The room is dark, so I can't see which socks I'm grabbing. I need to figure out the minimum number of socks I need to grab to ensure that I get at least one matching pair.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. A matching pair means two socks of the same color. There are three colors: blue, black, and red.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the worst-case scenario because that will help me determine the minimum number of socks I need to grab to guarantee a matching pair.\n\nSo, what's the worst that could happen? Well, I could grab one sock of each color. That would be one blue, one black, and one red. That's three socks, and I still don't have a matching pair because each sock is a different color.\n\nBut if I grab a fourth sock, no matter what color it is, it has to match one of the three socks I already have because there are only three colors.\n\nLet me put it another way:\n\n- First sock: could be any color, say blue.\n\n- Second sock: could be another color, say black.\n\n- Third sock: could be the remaining color, red.\n\n- Fourth sock: now, regardless of the color, it has to match one of the first three because there are only three colors.\n\nSo, it seems like grabbing four socks would guarantee that I have at least one matching pair.\n\nWait a minute, is there a possibility that the fourth sock doesn't match any of the first three? No, because there are only three colors. If I have one of each color already, the next one has to match one of them.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose I have a pile of socks, and I'm grabbing them one by one without looking.\n\n- Grab one sock: it's, say, blue.\n\n- Grab another sock: it's black.\n\n- Grab another sock: it's red.\n\nNow, I have one blue, one black, and one red sock. No matches yet.\n\n- Grab another sock: it has to be either blue, black, or red.\n\n- If it's blue, now I have two blue socks, which is a matching pair.\n\n- If it's black, now I have two black socks.\n\n- If it's red, now I have two red socks.\n\nIn any case, grabbing a fourth sock ensures that I have at least one matching pair.\n\nIs there a scenario where I could have more than four socks without having a matching pair? No, because with three colors, once you have four socks, at least two of them must be the same color.\n\nThis seems to be similar to the pigeonhole principle, where if you have n categories (in this case, three colors), and you have n+1 items, at least one category must have more than one item.\n\nSo, in this case, with three colors, I need to grab four socks to ensure that at least one color has two socks.\n\nWait, but the problem has different numbers of each color: 21 blue, 15 black, and 17 red. Does that matter?\n\nActually, in terms of guaranteeing a matching pair, the quantities don't matter as long as there are at least two socks of each color. Since there are 21 blue, 15 black, and 17 red, there are plenty of each color to make pairs.\n\nSo, even if there were only one sock of a particular color, but multiple of others, the principle would still hold. But in this case, all colors have multiple socks.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of socks to grab to ensure a matching pair is four.\n\nBut let's double-check this.\n\nSuppose I grab four socks, and they are: blue, black, red, blue. Yes, there's a matching pair of blue.\n\nOr blue, black, red, black: matching pair of black.\n\nOr blue, black, red, red: matching pair of red.\n\nIn any case, a fourth sock will create a pair.\n\nIs there a way to have four socks without a matching pair? No, because with three colors, the fourth sock must match one of the first three.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be four.\n\nWait, but I've seen similar problems where the answer is higher. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider the worst-case scenario again. The worst that could happen is that I grab one of each color first. That's three socks: one blue, one black, one red.\n\nThe next sock I grab has to be one of those colors, so it will form a pair.\n\nTherefore, four socks are sufficient to guarantee a matching pair.\n\nIs there a way to have more than four socks without a matching pair? No, because with three colors, once you have four socks, at least two must be the same color.\n\nSo, I think four is the minimum number needed to ensure a matching pair.\n\nTherefore, the answer is four.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
