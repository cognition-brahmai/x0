        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 50 red balls and 50 blue balls in a box, making a total of 100 balls. I'm supposed to pick one ball at random, look at its color, put it back, and repeat this process three times. I need to find out the probability that I pick a red ball all three times.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basic probability of picking a red ball in a single draw. Since there are 50 red balls out of 100, the probability should be 50/100, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.\n\nNow, because I'm picking the ball with replacement, each pick is independent of the others. That means the outcome of one pick doesn't affect the outcomes of the next picks.\n\nSo, for three picks in a row, all being red, I should multiply the probability of picking a red ball each time. That is, 0.5 multiplied by 0.5 multiplied by 0.5.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nProbability = 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5\n\nCalculating that:\n\n0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\n0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125\n\nSo, the probability is 0.125, which is the same as 12.5%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nI know that probability can also be expressed as a fraction. So, 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 equals 1/8.\n\nYes, 1/8 is equal to 0.125 or 12.5%. So, that checks out.\n\nLet me think about it in terms of combinations. The total number of possible outcomes for three picks, each having two possibilities (red or blue), is 2^3, which is 8.\n\nSo, there are 8 possible sequences:\n\n1. Red, Red, Red\n\n2. Red, Red, Blue\n\n3. Red, Blue, Red\n\n4. Red, Blue, Blue\n\n5. Blue, Red, Red\n\n6. Blue, Red, Blue\n\n7. Blue, Blue, Red\n\n8. Blue, Blue, Blue\n\nOut of these, only one sequence is all reds. So, the probability should be 1 out of 8, which again is 1/8 or 12.5%.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation. So, I think 1/8 is the correct probability.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the general formula for independent events. The probability of all events happening is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nIn this case, picking a red ball three times in a row would be:\n\nP(Red and Red and Red) = P(Red) * P(Red) * P(Red) = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nI should also consider if the order matters. In this problem, since I'm specifically looking for three reds in a row, the order does matter. But since all picks are independent and the probability doesn't change between picks, the calculation remains the same.\n\nLet me think about whether there's any other factor I'm missing. The problem says \"with replacement,\" so the probabilities stay constant across picks. If it were without replacement, the probabilities would change, but that's not the case here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the binomial probability formula, which is used for calculating the probability of a certain number of successes in a sequence of independent trials.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the number of trials (picks)\n\n- k is the number of successes (picking red)\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial\n\n- C(n,k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time\n\nIn this problem, n=3, k=3, p=0.5\n\nSo, P(3) = C(3,3) * (0.5)^3 * (1-0.5)^(3-3) = 1 * 0.125 * 1 = 0.125\n\nAgain, that's 1/8 or 12.5%, which matches my previous calculations.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently. The probability of picking a red ball three times in a row, with replacement, is 1/8 or 12.5%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{8}} \\]"
