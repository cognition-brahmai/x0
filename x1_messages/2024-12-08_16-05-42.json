        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a cylindrical water tank. The tank has a diameter of 8 feet and a height of 12 feet, and I need to find out its volume in gallons. The problem also gives me a conversion factor: 1 cubic foot equals 7.48 gallons. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find the volume of the cylinder in cubic feet, and then convert that volume to gallons. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. The diameter is given as 8 feet, so the radius is half of that, which is 4 feet. The height is 12 feet.\n\nLet me plug in the values:\n\nV = \u03c0 * (4 feet)\u00b2 * 12 feet\n\nV = \u03c0 * 16 square feet * 12 feet\n\nV = \u03c0 * 192 cubic feet\n\nNow, I need to calculate that. I can approximate \u03c0 as 3.1416.\n\nV \u2248 3.1416 * 192\n\nV \u2248 603.1872 cubic feet\n\nOkay, so the volume is approximately 603.1872 cubic feet.\n\nNext, I need to convert cubic feet to gallons. The conversion factor is 1 cubic foot = 7.48 gallons. So, I'll multiply the volume in cubic feet by 7.48 to get the volume in gallons.\n\nVolume in gallons \u2248 603.1872 cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 603.1872 * 7.48.\n\nWell, 603.1872 * 7 = 4222.3104\n\n603.1872 * 0.48 = 289.537856\n\nAdding those together: 4222.3104 + 289.537856 \u2248 4511.848256 gallons\n\nSo, the volume is approximately 4511.85 gallons.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a calculator for more precision, but since I'm doing this manually, I should be careful.\n\nLet me try breaking it down:\n\n603.1872 * 7.48\n\nFirst, 603.1872 * 7 = 4222.3104\n\nThen, 603.1872 * 0.4 = 241.27488\n\nAnd 603.1872 * 0.08 = 48.254976\n\nNow, adding those up:\n\n4222.3104 + 241.27488 + 48.254976 = 4511.840256 gallons\n\nSo, approximately 4511.84 gallons.\n\nI think that's accurate enough for this purpose.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the cylindrical water tank is approximately 4511.84 gallons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4511.84} \\]"
