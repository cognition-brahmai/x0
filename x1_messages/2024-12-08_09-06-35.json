        "content": "So I need to calculate the surface area of a cylinder that has a height of 10 units and a radius of 3 units. I remember that the surface area of a cylinder includes the area of the two circular bases plus the area of the side. The formula for the surface area of a cylinder is given by:\n\n\\[ A = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi r h \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the base.\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven that the radius \\( r = 3 \\) and the height \\( h = 10 \\), I can plug these values into the formula.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the area of the two bases:\n\n\\[ 2\\pi r^2 = 2\\pi (3)^2 = 2\\pi \\times 9 = 18\\pi \\]\n\nNext, I'll calculate the area of the side:\n\n\\[ 2\\pi r h = 2\\pi \\times 3 \\times 10 = 60\\pi \\]\n\nNow, I'll add these two areas together to get the total surface area:\n\n\\[ A = 18\\pi + 60\\pi = 78\\pi \\]\n\nIf I need a numerical value, I can approximate \\( \\pi \\) as 3.1416:\n\n\\[ A \\approx 78 \\times 3.1416 = 245.0448 \\]\n\nSo, the surface area of the cylinder is approximately 245.04 square units.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's go through it again.\n\nStarting with the formula:\n\n\\[ A = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi r h \\]\n\nPlugging in \\( r = 3 \\) and \\( h = 10 \\):\n\n\\[ A = 2\\pi (3)^2 + 2\\pi (3)(10) \\]\n\n\\[ A = 2\\pi (9) + 2\\pi (30) \\]\n\n\\[ A = 18\\pi + 60\\pi \\]\n\n\\[ A = 78\\pi \\]\n\nThat seems correct. And using \\( \\pi \\approx 3.1416 \\):\n\n\\[ A \\approx 78 \\times 3.1416 = 245.0448 \\]\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation. So, the surface area is approximately 245.04 square units.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using the formula for the lateral surface area and adding the areas of the two bases separately.\n\nThe lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by:\n\n\\[ A_{\\text{lateral}} = 2\\pi r h \\]\n\nAnd the area of one base is:\n\n\\[ A_{\\text{base}} = \\pi r^2 \\]\n\nSo, the total surface area would be:\n\n\\[ A = 2 A_{\\text{base}} + A_{\\text{lateral}} = 2(\\pi r^2) + 2\\pi r h \\]\n\nWhich is the same as the original formula I used. So, I'm confident that my calculation is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the surface area in terms of unwrapping the cylinder. If you imagine cutting the cylinder along its height and flattening it, the side would form a rectangle with height 10 and width equal to the circumference of the base, which is \\( 2\\pi r = 6\\pi \\). So, the area of this rectangle would be:\n\n\\[ A_{\\text{rectangle}} = \\text{height} \\times \\text{width} = 10 \\times 6\\pi = 60\\pi \\]\n\nThen, adding the areas of the two bases:\n\n\\[ A_{\\text{total}} = A_{\\text{rectangle}} + 2 A_{\\text{base}} = 60\\pi + 2(\\pi r^2) = 60\\pi + 18\\pi = 78\\pi \\]\n\nAgain, the same result. This reinforces that my calculation is accurate.\n\nI should also consider if the problem is asking for the surface area including both bases or just the lateral surface area. The question says \"surface area,\" which typically includes all surfaces of the cylinder, meaning both bases and the side. If it were just the lateral surface area, it would probably specify that. So, I believe including both bases is correct.\n\nTo further ensure accuracy, I can plug the values into the formula step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate \\( r^2 \\):\n\n\\[ r^2 = 3^2 = 9 \\]\n\nThen, calculate \\( 2\\pi r^2 \\):\n\n\\[ 2\\pi (9) = 18\\pi \\]\n\nNext, calculate \\( 2\\pi r h \\):\n\n\\[ 2\\pi (3)(10) = 60\\pi \\]\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n\\[ 18\\pi + 60\\pi = 78\\pi \\]\n\nSo, the total surface area is \\( 78\\pi \\) square units, or approximately 245.04 square units.\n\nI think that's the final answer. But to be absolutely sure, I can check if there's any other factor I might have missed, such as units or whether the cylinder is open-ended or not. The problem states that the cylinder has a height of 10 and a radius of 3, and it doesn't specify any openings, so I assume it's a closed cylinder with two bases.\n\nAnother way to think about the surface area is to consider the formula for the surface area of a closed cylinder, which indeed is \\( A = 2\\pi r (r + h) \\). Plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ A = 2\\pi (3)(3 + 10) = 2\\pi (3)(13) = 2\\pi (39) = 78\\pi \\]\n\nAgain, the same result. This cross-verification using a different formula confirms that my answer is correct.\n\nSo, the surface area of the cylinder is \\( 78\\pi \\) square units, or approximately 245.04 square units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{78\\pi \\text{ or approximately } 245.04} \\]"
