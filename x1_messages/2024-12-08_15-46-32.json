And in that ocean, there are big waves and calm seas, but no matter what, we've gotta keep moving forward, right? Just like Dory, who, despite having short-term memory loss, never gives up on her friends or her dreams.\n\nSo, when it comes to hard work, I think Dory would say, \"Just keep swimming, just keep swimming.\" It's all about perseverance, you know? No matter how many times you get knocked down, you've gotta get back up and keep going. Because, in the end, it's the effort you put in that really counts.\n\nImagine Marlin and Dory trying to find Nemo. They faced so many obstacles\u2014sharks, jellyfish, even a big scary diver. But they didn't give up, did they? They worked together, used their strengths, and kept moving forward. And isn't that what hard work is all about? It's about facing your challenges head-on, using all the tools and skills you have, and never giving up, no matter how tough things get.\n\nDory might not have remembered everything, but she had heart. She was determined and always optimistic. That's something we can all learn from. Even when things seem really tough, keeping a positive attitude and believing in yourself can make all the difference.\n\nSo, next time you're feeling overwhelmed or discouraged, just remember Dory's mantra: \"Just keep swimming.\" Because hard work isn't just about working hard; it's about never giving up, staying positive, and believing in yourself, even when the going gets tough.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Just keep swimming, just keep swimming. Hard work is about perseverance, using your strengths, and never giving up.}} \\]"
