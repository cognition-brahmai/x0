Each step in your plan will correspond to an evidence value, which is the output of one of the given functions with an input string that can be the user's question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools you can call:\nWebSearch[input]: This tool allows users to search for information on the internet using a general web search engine. It finds a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's query but does not directly provide the answer.\nPageReader[input]: This function loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline-delimited links and produces plain text output containing the content of those pages.\nLinkFinder[input]: Extracts links from plain text and provides a plain text, newline-delimited response of links.\nQAExpert[input]: A question-answering language model useful for answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question referencing a #E[n] variable, e.g., \"What is the capital of France, given #E1?\"\n\nThe input to each function should just be a plain string without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., QAExpert[What is the capital of France, given #E1?]\n\nRemember to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nPlan: [first action based on the input question]\n#E1 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on the result of #E1]\n#E2 = [next function to call and input parameter, which may reference previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context #E1\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: What is the history behind the Eiffel Tower and who were its main architects?"
