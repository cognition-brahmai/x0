        "content": "Let's see. The tree is currently 5 feet tall and grows 2 inches every year. We need to find out how tall it will be in 20 years. Hmm, first things first, I need to make sure all units are consistent. Feet and inches are both units of length, but they're different, so I should probably convert everything to the same unit.\n\nOkay, there are 12 inches in a foot, right? So, if the tree is 5 feet tall, that would be 5 times 12, which is 60 inches. So, currently, the tree is 60 inches tall.\n\nNow, it grows 2 inches every year. So, in 20 years, it would grow 2 inches per year times 20 years, which is 40 inches.\n\nSo, if it's currently 60 inches tall and it grows 40 inches in 20 years, the total height would be 60 plus 40, which is 100 inches.\n\nBut maybe the question wants the height in feet instead of inches. Let's see. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 100 inches divided by 12 would give us the height in feet.\n\n100 divided by 12 is 8.333..., which means 8 feet and 0.333... of a foot. Since 0.333... of a foot is roughly 4 inches (because 0.333 times 12 is 4), the height would be 8 feet 4 inches.\n\nWait, but I should check if there's another way to look at this. Maybe I made a mistake in the unit conversion.\n\nLet me try again. The tree is currently 5 feet tall, and it grows 2 inches per year for 20 years.\n\nSo, the growth in 20 years is 2 inches per year times 20 years, which is 40 inches.\n\nNow, adding that to the current height: 5 feet plus 40 inches.\n\nBut 5 feet is 60 inches, plus 40 inches is 100 inches, which is what I got before.\n\nAlternatively, I could add the growth in feet. 40 inches is 40 divided by 12, which is 3 feet and 4 inches (since 36 inches is 3 feet, and 4 inches is left over).\n\nSo, 5 feet plus 3 feet is 8 feet, plus 4 inches, which again gives 8 feet 4 inches.\n\nHmm, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Maybe the growth rate isn't constant, but the problem says it grows 2 inches every year, so I think it's safe to assume a constant growth rate.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are correctly converted and that I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLet me double-check the arithmetic:\n\n- Current height: 5 feet = 5 * 12 = 60 inches.\n\n- Growth in 20 years: 2 inches/year * 20 years = 40 inches.\n\n- Total height in inches: 60 + 40 = 100 inches.\n\n- Convert back to feet and inches: 100 inches / 12 = 8 feet plus 4 inches.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in feet from the beginning.\n\nThe tree grows 2 inches per year, and since there are 12 inches in a foot, the growth per year in feet is 2/12 = 1/6 feet per year.\n\nSo, in 20 years, the growth would be 20 * (1/6) = 20/6 = 3.333... feet.\n\nAdding that to the current height: 5 + 3.333... = 8.333... feet, which is 8 feet and 4 inches.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think this is the correct answer. The tree will be 8 feet 4 inches tall in 20 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8\\ \\text{feet}\\ 4\\ \\text{inches}} \\]\n"
