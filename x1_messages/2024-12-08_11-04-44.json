Let's break down the steps we need to take to make this happen.\n\nFirst, we need to find a public API that provides weather data. There are several options available, such as OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack, and AccuWeather. For this example, I'll use OpenWeatherMap because it's widely used and has a free tier that should suit our needs.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide to building this application:\n\n### Step 1: Sign Up for an API Key\n\n1. **OpenWeatherMap**: Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and sign up for a free account to get an API key.\n\n### Step 2: Install Required Libraries\n\nWe'll need the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the API. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install requests\n```\n\n### Step 3: Write the Python Code\n\nWe'll create a simple command-line application that asks the user for a city name and then fetches and displays the current weather data for that city.\n\nHere's a basic outline of the code:\n\n1. **Import the necessary library**:\n    ```python\n    import requests\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up the API URL and your API key**:\n    ```python\n    API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'\n    BASE_URL = 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather'\n    ```\n\n3. **Get user input for the city name**:\n    ```python\n    city = input(\"Enter city name: \")\n    ```\n\n4. **Construct the API URL with query parameters**:\n    ```python\n    url = f\"{BASE_URL}?q={city}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric\"\n    ```\n\n5. **Make the API request and handle the response**:\n    ```python\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    data = response.json()\n    ```\n\n6. **Check if the city was found and display the weather data**:\n    ```python\n    if data['cod'] == 200:\n        main = data['main']\n        weather = data['weather'][0]\n        print(f\"City: {data['name']}\")\n        print(f\"Temperature: {main['temp']}\u00b0C\")\n        print(f\"Humidity: {main['humidity']}%\")\n        print(f\"Weather: {weather['description']}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"City not found.\")\n    ```\n\n### Complete Code Example\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef main():\n    API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'\n    BASE_URL = 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather'\n    \n    city = input(\"Enter city name: \")\n    url = f\"{BASE_URL}?q={city}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric\"\n    \n    response = requests.get(url)\n    data = response.json()\n    \n    if data['cod'] == 200:\n        main = data['main']\n        weather = data['weather'][0]\n        print(f\"City: {data['name']}\")\n        print(f\"Temperature: {main['temp']}\u00b0C\")\n        print(f\"Humidity: {main['humidity']}%\")\n        print(f\"Weather: {weather['description']}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"City not found.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Step 4: Run the Application\n\n1. **Save the code** to a file, for example, `weather_app.py`.\n2. **Run the application** from the command line:\n    ```bash\n    python weather_app.py\n    ```\n3. **Enter a city name** when prompted, and see the weather data.\n\n### Step 5: Enhancements\n\n- **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling for network issues or invalid responses.\n- **More Features**: Fetch and display additional weather data like wind speed, pressure, etc.\n- **User Interface**: Consider building a GUI using libraries like Tkinter for a more user-friendly experience.\n- **Location Services**: Use geolocation services to get weather data based on the user's current location.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point for building your weather data scraper in Python.
