        "content": "So, the factory makes 1000 widgets every day, and each one has a 98% chance of being perfect. That means there's a 2% chance that a widget is defective, right? Because 100% minus 98% is 2%.\n\nSo, if I want to find out how many defective widgets are made each day on average, I need to calculate 2% of 1000.\n\nLet me think about how to do that. Percent means per hundred, so 2% is like 2 per 100. To find 2% of 1000, I can multiply 1000 by 2% or, in decimal form, that's 1000 times 0.02.\n\nSo, 1000 times 0.02 equals 20.\n\nDoes that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that for each widget, there's a 2% chance it's defective. So, if I have 1000 widgets, I can expect that 2% of them won't be perfect.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of probability. The probability of a widget being defective is 0.02. So, the expected number of defective widgets in a batch of 1000 is 1000 times 0.02, which again is 20.\n\nWait a minute, is there a more precise way to calculate this, maybe using some statistical formula?\n\nI recall that in statistics, the expected value is the sum of all possible values each multiplied by their probability. In this case, each widget can be defective (value 1) with probability 0.02, or not defective (value 0) with probability 0.98.\n\nSo, the expected value for one widget is 1 times 0.02 plus 0 times 0.98, which is 0.02.\n\nSince expected values are additive, for 1000 widgets, the expected number of defective widgets is 1000 times 0.02, which is 20.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. What if the defects aren't independent? Does that affect the expected value?\n\nWell, the problem says each widget has a 98% chance of being produced without defects, so I think it's safe to assume that the defects are independent.\n\nWait, but in reality, maybe there are some days when the production process is off, and more widgets are defective. But based on the information given, I think we have to assume independence.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial calculation, the expected number of defective widgets per day is 20.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other factor I'm missing. Is there any reason why this wouldn't be the case?\n\nPerhaps the factory has some quality control measures in place that could reduce the number of defective widgets. But the problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I don't think I can factor that in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a learning effect; as the factory produces more widgets, they get better at it. But again, the problem states a constant 98% defect-free rate per widget.\n\nSo, I think 20 is the correct expected number of defective widgets per day.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if the factory operates multiple shifts or has multiple machines. Maybe that could affect the defect rate. However, the problem doesn't provide any details about that, so I'll assume that the 98% applies uniformly to all widgets produced.\n\nAlso, perhaps the defect rate changes over time, but again, the problem states a constant daily production and defect probability.\n\nAnother thought: maybe some widgets have multiple types of defects, but the problem only mentions \"defects\" in general, so I think the 2% accounts for any kind of defect.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the expected number of defective widgets produced each day is 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
