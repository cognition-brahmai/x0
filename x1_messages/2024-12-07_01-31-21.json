Marie Curie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, which she shared with her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, for their work on radioactivity. Then, in 1911, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of the elements radium and polonium. This makes her the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different fields of science.\n"
