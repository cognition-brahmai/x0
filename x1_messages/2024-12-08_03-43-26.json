        "content": "Let's see. There are 50 houses in the village, and each house has one cat. Every day, each cat catches one mouse from the neighboring house. We need to find out how many mice were caught by all the cats in total after 5 days.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There are 50 houses, each with one cat. So, there are 50 cats in total. Each cat catches one mouse per day from a neighboring house. The question is about the total number of mice caught over 5 days.\n\nBut I need to be careful here. If each cat catches one mouse per day from a neighboring house, then each day, each cat is catching one mouse. So, per day, the total number of mice caught would be equal to the number of cats, which is 50.\n\nWait, but mice are being caught from neighboring houses. Does that mean that the mice being caught are from the houses adjacent to each cat's house? In a village with 50 houses, how are the houses arranged? Are they in a line, or perhaps in a circle, or some other configuration?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify the arrangement of the houses, which might be important because it affects how many neighbors each house has. For example, if the houses are arranged in a circle, each house has two neighbors. If they are in a straight line, the end houses have one neighbor each, and the inner houses have two.\n\nHmm, maybe the arrangement doesn't matter for this problem. The key point is that each cat catches one mouse from a neighboring house each day.\n\nSo, each day, each cat catches one mouse from a neighbor. That means that each day, 50 mice are caught in total, since there are 50 cats.\n\nWait a minute, but if each cat is catching a mouse from a neighboring house, doesn't that mean that some mice are being caught multiple times if multiple cats are targeting the same house?\n\nNo, because each cat catches one mouse from its neighboring house, but the mice are in the neighboring houses, not in their own houses. So, the mice are in different houses, and each cat is catching a mouse from a specific neighbor.\n\nBut the problem says \"from the neighboring house,\" which implies that each cat has a specific neighboring house from which it catches a mouse.\n\nIf the houses are arranged in a circle, for example, each house has two neighbors, but each cat would be catching a mouse from one specific neighbor.\n\nWait, perhaps it's safer to assume that each cat has one specific neighboring house from which it catches a mouse each day.\n\nSo, if there are 50 houses, and each cat catches one mouse per day from a neighboring house, then each day, 50 mice are caught.\n\nOver 5 days, the total number of mice caught would be 50 mice/day * 5 days = 250 mice.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because it seems too straightforward. Maybe there's something I'm missing here.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose we label the houses from 1 to 50. Each house has a cat, and each cat catches a mouse from a neighboring house.\n\nIf the houses are in a circle, house 1's neighbors are house 50 and house 2. Similarly, house 2's neighbors are house 1 and house 3, and so on.\n\nIf each cat catches one mouse from a neighboring house, and assuming each cat chooses one specific neighbor to catch a mouse from, then each day, 50 mice are caught.\n\nBut perhaps some cats are catching mice from the same house, which would mean that some mice are being caught multiple times.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"from the neighboring house,\" which is singular, implying each cat has one specific neighboring house from which it catches a mouse.\n\nSo, if each cat has one specific neighboring house, and there are 50 houses, then the total number of mice caught per day is 50.\n\nOver 5 days, that would be 250 mice.\n\nBut perhaps the same mouse is being caught multiple times if multiple cats are catching mice from the same house.\n\nWait, but the problem says each cat catches one mouse from the neighboring house each day. It doesn't specify that the mice are being replenished or that a house can have multiple mice.\n\nIf a cat catches a mouse from a neighboring house, and that mouse is caught every day, then perhaps the same mouse is being caught multiple times.\n\nBut that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each house has a certain number of mice, and each day, each cat catches one mouse from a neighboring house.\n\nBut the problem states that each house has a cat living in it, but it doesn't specify how many mice each house has.\n\nWait, the problem is: \"Each house has a cat living in it. Every day, each cat catches one mouse from the neighboring house.\"\n\nSo, it's about the cats catching mice from neighboring houses.\n\nBut the question is: how many mice were caught by all cats in total after 5 days?\n\nAssuming that each cat catches one mouse per day from a neighboring house, and there are 50 cats, then each day, 50 mice are caught.\n\nOver 5 days, that would be 50 * 5 = 250 mice.\n\nBut perhaps some mice are being caught multiple times, especially if multiple cats are catching mice from the same house.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each house has an unlimited number of mice, so each cat can catch one mouse per day from its neighbor without depleting the mouse population.\n\nIn that case, the total number of mice caught would indeed be 250.\n\nAlternatively, if each house has a limited number of mice, say one mouse, then on the first day, each cat catches one mouse from a neighboring house.\n\nOn the second day, if the neighboring house still has a mouse, the cat can catch another one, but if the mouse has already been caught, then there are no more mice to catch.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how many mice are in each house to begin with.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the safest assumption is that each house has an unlimited number of mice, so each cat can catch one mouse per day from a neighboring house without depleting the supply.\n\nTherefore, the total number of mice caught after 5 days would be 50 cats * 1 mouse/cat/day * 5 days = 250 mice.\n\nSo, the answer should be 250 mice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{250} \\]"
