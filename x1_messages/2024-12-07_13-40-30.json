If you're looking for an anagram of \"parse\" that relates to this concept, \"spare\" doesn't directly correspond, but in some contexts, \"reaps\" could be considered, though it's not directly related to parsing. In any case, the primary term for analyzing sentences into their components is \"parse.\""
