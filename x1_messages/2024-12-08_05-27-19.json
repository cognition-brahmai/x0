        "content": "So I need to compute the double integral of f(x,y) = xy over the region bounded by y=x, y=0, and x=1. Alright, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the region of integration. We have y = x, which is a straight line passing through the origin with a 45-degree slope; y = 0, which is the x-axis; and x = 1, which is a vertical line at x=1. So, the region is a right-angled triangle with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nNow, for a double integral over a region like this, I need to set up the limits of integration. Since it's a type I region (vertical strips), I can integrate with respect to y first, then x.\n\nSo, for a fixed x, y goes from y=0 up to y=x. And x goes from 0 to 1.\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b(from x=0 to x=1) \u222b(from y=0 to y=x) xy dy dx.\n\nAlright, let's compute the inner integral first.\n\nInner integral: \u222b(from y=0 to y=x) xy dy.\n\nTreat x as a constant here since we're integrating with respect to y.\n\nSo, \u222b xy dy = x \u222b y dy = x*(y^2)/2 evaluated from y=0 to y=x.\n\nPlugging in the limits:\n\nx*(x^2)/2 - x*(0)^2/2 = x*(x^2)/2 = (x^3)/2.\n\nSo, the inner integral gives (x^3)/2.\n\nNow, plug this into the outer integral:\n\n\u222b(from x=0 to x=1) (x^3)/2 dx.\n\nFactor out the constant 1/2:\n\n(1/2) \u222b(from x=0 to x=1) x^3 dx.\n\nNow, integrate x^3 with respect to x:\n\n(1/2)*(x^4)/4 evaluated from x=0 to x=1.\n\nWhich is (1/2)*(1/4 - 0) = (1/2)*(1/4) = 1/8.\n\nSo, the double integral of f(x,y) = xy over the given region is 1/8.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set up the integral with respect to x first, then y, to verify.\n\nSo, if I consider horizontal strips, y goes from 0 to 1, and for each y, x goes from y to 1.\n\nBecause the region is bounded by y=x below, so x starts at x=y and goes up to x=1.\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b(from y=0 to y=1) \u222b(from x=y to x=1) xy dx dy.\n\nLet's compute the inner integral first.\n\nInner integral: \u222b(from x=y to x=1) xy dx.\n\nTreat y as a constant here.\n\nSo, \u222b xy dx = y \u222b x dx = y*(x^2)/2 evaluated from x=y to x=1.\n\nPlugging in the limits:\n\ny*(1^2)/2 - y*(y^2)/2 = y/2 - (y^3)/2.\n\nSo, the inner integral gives y/2 - (y^3)/2.\n\nNow, plug this into the outer integral:\n\n\u222b(from y=0 to y=1) (y/2 - y^3/2) dy.\n\nFactor out 1/2:\n\n(1/2) \u222b(from y=0 to y=1) (y - y^3) dy.\n\nNow, integrate term by term:\n\n(1/2) * [ (y^2)/2 - (y^4)/4 ] evaluated from y=0 to y=1.\n\nPlugging in the limits:\n\n(1/2) * [ (1/2 - 1/4) - (0) ] = (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/8.\n\nSo, again, I get 1/8.\n\nAlright, that matches my first answer. So, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a different approach to verify.\n\nLet's see, perhaps I can use the properties of double integrals or change the order of integration, but I already did that.\n\nAlternatively, since the region is simple, maybe I can compute it directly.\n\nBut I think the two methods I've used are sufficient to confirm that the answer is 1/8.\n\nLet me just consider if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of the double integral of xy over this triangular region.\n\nWe know that the double integral of xy over a region can be interpreted as some kind of average value times the area, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, since both x and y are variables, and the region is bounded by y=x, y=0, and x=1, perhaps there's a symmetry or a substitution that could simplify the integral.\n\nFor example, maybe using polar coordinates, but given the region is a triangle, Cartesian coordinates seem more appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using iterated integrals as I did is the most straightforward way.\n\nGiven that both methods gave me the same answer of 1/8, I think that's the correct result.\n\nSo, the double integral of f(x,y) = xy over the region bounded by y=x, y=0, and x=1 is 1/8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{8}} \\]"
