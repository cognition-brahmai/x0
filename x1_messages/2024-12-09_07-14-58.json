This process involves several steps, which I'll outline below.\n\nFirst, recall that the definite integral of a function can be interpreted as the area under the curve of that function between two points. In this case, those points are x = 0 and x = 3.\n\nThe general formula for the definite integral of x^n from a to b is given by:\n\n\u222b from a to b of x^n dx = [x^{n+1}/(n+1)] from a to b\n\nFor our specific problem, n = 2, a = 0, and b = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\u222b from 0 to 3 of x\u00b2 dx = [x^{3}/3] from 0 to 3\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this expression at the upper limit (x = 3) and subtract its value at the lower limit (x = 0).\n\nFirst, evaluate at x = 3:\n\n(3)^3 / 3 = 27 / 3 = 9\n\nNext, evaluate at x = 0:\n\n(0)^3 / 3 = 0 / 3 = 0\n\nNow, subtract the lower limit value from the upper limit value:\n\n9 - 0 = 9\n\nTherefore, the integral of x\u00b2 from x = 0 to x = 3 is 9.\n\nTo summarize, we used the power rule for integration, which states that the integral of x^n is x^{n+1}/(n+1), and then applied the fundamental theorem of calculus to evaluate the definite integral by subtracting the antiderivative at the lower limit from that at the upper limit.\n\nThis method is straightforward for polynomial functions like x\u00b2 and provides an exact value for the area under the curve between the specified limits.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
