Gospel music is known for its uplifting messages and expressions of faith, so I'll aim to incorporate those elements into the lyrics. Here's a sample of what the song could sound like:\n\n**Chorus:**  \nIn every sunrise, in every star above,  \nI find reasons to sing, reasons to love.  \nSimple pleasures, pure and true,  \nGratitude flows, just me and You.\n\n**Verse 1:**  \nWake up to the dawn, birds singing sweet,  \nA warm cup of coffee, a morning treat.  \nLaughter of children, playing in the park,  \nThese are the moments that make my heart dance.\n\n**Chorus:**  \nIn every sunrise, in every star above,  \nI find reasons to sing, reasons to love.  \nSimple pleasures, pure and true,  \nGratitude flows, just me and You.\n\n**Verse 2:**  \nA gentle breeze that rustles the leaves,  \nA hug from a loved one, their comfort I believe.  \nRaindrops on the roof, a symphony so fine,  \nEach drop a reminder of life's divine design.\n\n**Chorus:**  \nIn every sunrise, in every star above,  \nI find reasons to sing, reasons to love.  \nSimple pleasures, pure and true,  \nGratitude flows, just me and You.\n\n**Bridge:**  \nSometimes we seek the big and the bold,  \nBut it's in the small where God's love is told.  \nContentment in the here and now,  \nLiving each day with grace and wow.\n\n**Chorus:**  \nIn every sunrise, in every star above,  \nI find reasons to sing, reasons to love.  \nSimple pleasures, pure and true,  \nGratitude flows, just me and You.\n\n**Outro:**  \nSo here's to the simple, the ordinary,  \nTo the blessings that fill each new day.  \nWith faith in my heart and a song in my soul,  \nI'll cherish it all, young and old.\n\nRemember, this is just a starting point. You can adjust the lyrics to better fit your vision or the musical style you have in mind. Feel free to add your own touches and make it uniquely yours!)"
