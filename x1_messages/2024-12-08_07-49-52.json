        "content": "So, there's this problem about a bus that leaves the station every 15 minutes, and a passenger arrives randomly. We need to find out the average waiting time for the next bus. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, since the buses leave every 15 minutes, the schedule is regular and periodic. So, if I think about the time between buses as a cycle of 15 minutes, and the passenger arrives at a random time within that cycle, the waiting time would depend on where in the cycle the passenger arrives.\n\nMaybe I can model this as a uniform distribution. The passenger can arrive at any time within the 15-minute interval equally likely. So, the waiting time would be a random variable that can range from 0 to 15 minutes.\n\nIn a uniform distribution, the average or expected value is the midpoint of the range. So, for a waiting time between 0 and 15 minutes, the average waiting time would be 7.5 minutes. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if that makes sense. If the buses are strictly on a 15-minute schedule, and the passenger arrives at a completely random time, then yes, on average, the passenger would wait half of the interval, which is 7.5 minutes.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using the concept of expected value. The expected waiting time E[T] can be calculated as the integral of t*f(t) dt over the range of possible waiting times, where f(t) is the probability density function.\n\nIn this case, f(t) = 1/15 for 0 \u2264 t \u2264 15, since it's a uniform distribution. So, E[T] = \u222b(t * (1/15)) dt from 0 to 15.\n\nCalculating that integral: \u222bt/15 dt from 0 to 15 is [t^2/30] from 0 to 15, which is (15^2)/30 - 0 = 225/30 = 7.5 minutes. Okay, that matches my earlier thought.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other factor I'm missing. Is the bus schedule perfectly regular? The problem says \"every 15 minutes,\" so I'm assuming it's perfectly periodic. If there was any randomness in the bus arrival times, that might affect the waiting time, but in this case, it's fixed.\n\nAlso, the passenger arrives randomly, which I'm taking to mean that the arrival time is uniformly distributed over the 15-minute interval between buses. If there were any patterns in the passenger's arrival time, that could change things, but since it's random, uniform distribution seems appropriate.\n\nAnother angle: maybe think about it discrete terms. Suppose we divide the 15-minute interval into, say, 1-minute intervals. Then, the possible waiting times are 0, 1, 2, up to 14 minutes.\n\nEach of these has an equal probability of 1/15. So, the expected waiting time would be the sum of t*(1/15) for t from 0 to 14.\n\nCalculating that: (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + 14)/15. The sum of the first n integers is n(n+1)/2, so sum from 0 to 14 is 14*15/2 = 105.\n\nTherefore, E[T] = 105/15 = 7 minutes. Wait, that's different from the earlier answer of 7.5 minutes. Hmm, must be a miscalculation.\n\nWait, sum from 0 to 14 is indeed 14*15/2 = 105, and 105 divided by 15 is 7. But earlier, using continuous uniform distribution, I got 7.5. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nAh, I see the issue. If we consider the interval from 0 to 15 minutes, inclusive, then the possible waiting times are from 0 to 15 minutes. In the discrete calculation, I went up to 14, which corresponds to a 15-minute interval divided into 15 equal parts: 0, 1, 2, ..., 14 minutes.\n\nBut in the continuous case, the upper limit is inclusive, so the average is (0 + 15)/2 = 7.5 minutes.\n\nSo, in the discrete case with 15 intervals, the average is 7 minutes, but as the number of intervals increases, it should approach the continuous average.\n\nLet me verify that. If I take n intervals, the sum is (n-1)*n/2, divided by n, gives (n-1)/2. As n approaches infinity, (n-1)/2 approaches n/2.\n\nIn the continuous case, it's exactly half the interval, which is 15/2 = 7.5 minutes.\n\nSo, the discrete calculation with 15 intervals is approximately 7 minutes, but as the number of intervals increases, it approaches 7.5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the continuous uniform distribution approach is more accurate here, giving an average waiting time of 7.5 minutes.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe considering that the passenger could arrive just after a bus leaves, needing to wait almost 15 minutes, or right before a bus arrives, waiting only a few seconds. On average, it should be half the interval, which is 7.5 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if we think in terms of expected value, and the distribution is uniform, then yes, 7.5 minutes is the correct average waiting time.\n\nWait a minute, is there any probability involved with the bus arrival? No, the buses are on a fixed schedule, so the randomness is only in the passenger's arrival time.\n\nTherefore, modeling the passenger's arrival time as a uniform random variable over the 15-minute interval between buses is correct.\n\nHence, the expected waiting time is indeed 7.5 minutes.\n\nBut earlier, I had a discrepancy in the discrete calculation. Maybe I should consider a larger number of intervals to see if it approaches 7.5.\n\nLet's say I divide the 15-minute interval into 30 parts, each of 0.5 minutes. Then, the possible waiting times are 0, 0.5, 1.0, ..., up to 14.5 minutes.\n\nThe sum is 0 + 0.5 + 1.0 + ... + 14.5. This is an arithmetic series with first term 0, last term 14.5, and number of terms 30.\n\nSum = (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term) = 30/2 * (0 + 14.5) = 15 * 14.5 = 217.5 minutes.\n\nThen, E[T] = 217.5 / 30 = 7.25 minutes.\n\nCloser to 7.5 but still not exactly. If I increase the number of intervals to 60, with each interval of 0.25 minutes, the sum would be higher.\n\nWait, this is getting cumbersome. Perhaps it's better to stick with the continuous uniform distribution approach, which directly gives the expected value as 7.5 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the average waiting time in a periodic arrival process.\n\nIn queuing theory, for a periodic arrival with period T, the average waiting time for a random arrival is T/2, assuming uniform distribution.\n\nHere, T = 15 minutes, so T/2 = 7.5 minutes. That matches our earlier calculation.\n\nIs there any other consideration I should make? For example, if the passenger's arrival time is not uniformly distributed, but that's against the problem statement which says \"randomly.\"\n\nAlso, assuming that the bus schedule is perfectly regular, without any variability in the departure times.\n\nAnother thing to consider: does the passenger arrive at any time of the day, or is there a specific time frame? The problem doesn't specify, but since it's a regular 15-minute schedule, I think it's safe to assume that the time of day doesn't affect the uniformity.\n\nTherefore, the average waiting time should be 7.5 minutes.\n\nWait, but in my discrete calculation with 15 intervals, I got 7 minutes, which doesn't match the continuous case. Maybe I need to adjust the discrete approach.\n\nIf I consider the intervals from 0 to 15 minutes, with 15 intervals, each of 1 minute, then the possible waiting times are 0,1,2,...,14 minutes, and the average is 7 minutes.\n\nBut if I consider the intervals from 0 to 15 minutes, with 15 intervals, each of exactly 1 minute, then the sum is 0+1+2+...+14 = 105, and divided by 15 is 7 minutes.\n\nHowever, in reality, the last interval would be from 14 to 15 minutes, so the waiting time for someone arriving in that interval would be between 0 and 1 minute.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the discrete model.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose the bus arrives at time t=0, t=15, t=30, etc.\n\nIf the passenger arrives at a time uniformly distributed between 0 and 15 minutes, then the waiting time is min(t, 15-t), but no, that's not correct.\n\nActually, the waiting time is 15 - arrival time, if arrival time is less than 15 minutes.\n\nWait, no. If the passenger arrives at time t, where 0 \u2264 t < 15, then the waiting time for the next bus is 15 - t minutes.\n\nTherefore, E[T] = \u222b(15 - t) * (1/15) dt from 0 to 15.\n\nLet's compute that: \u222b(15 - t)/15 dt from 0 to 15 = (1/15)[15t - t^2/2] from 0 to 15 = (1/15)[15*15 - (15^2)/2] - 0 = (1/15)[225 - 225/2] = (1/15)(225/2) = (225/30) = 7.5 minutes.\n\nOkay, that matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, in the discrete case, if I consider the waiting time as 15 - t for t from 0 to 15 in small intervals, and take the average, it should approach 7.5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the correct average waiting time is 7.5 minutes.\n\nPerhaps the discrepancy in the discrete calculation earlier was because I was summing from 0 to 14 minutes, which doesn't fully account for the last interval.\n\nIn conclusion, the average waiting time for the next bus is 7.5 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.5} \\]"
