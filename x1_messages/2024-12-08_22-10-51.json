        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 5 red balls, 7 blue balls, and 4 green balls. So, total balls in the bag are 5 + 7 + 4, which is 16 balls. Now, I need to draw 3 balls without replacement, and I want exactly 2 of them to be red.\n\nOkay, so without replacement means that once I draw a ball, it stays out and doesn't go back into the bag. That changes things because the probabilities change with each draw.\n\nFirst, I need to find the total number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 16. That's a combination problem, right? Because the order doesn't matter. So, the total number of ways is \"16 choose 3.\" The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, C(16, 3) = 16! / (3! * (16 - 3)!) = (16 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 14) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 560.\n\nAlright, that's the denominator, the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nNow, I need the number of favorable outcomes, which is getting exactly 2 red balls and 1 ball that's not red.\n\nThere are 5 red balls, so the number of ways to choose 2 red balls is C(5, 2).\n\nC(5, 2) = (5 \u00d7 4) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 10.\n\nNow, for the third ball, it can't be red; it has to be either blue or green. There are 7 blue and 4 green, so total of 11 non-red balls.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 1 non-red ball is C(11, 1) = 11.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is C(5, 2) \u00d7 C(11, 1) = 10 \u00d7 11 = 110.\n\nNow, the probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes, which is 110 / 560.\n\nSimplifying that fraction: both numerator and denominator divisible by 10, so 11 / 56.\n\nSo, the probability is 11/56.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the problem in terms of probability at each step since it's without replacement.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing exactly 2 red balls out of 3 draws.\n\nThis can happen in different orders:\n\n- Red, Red, Not Red\n\n- Red, Not Red, Red\n\n- Not Red, Red, Red\n\nSo, three different sequences.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for each sequence and then add them up.\n\nFirst sequence: Red, Red, Not Red.\n\nProbability of first ball being red: 5/16.\n\nThen, second ball being red: now there are 4 red balls left and total balls are 15, so 4/15.\n\nThird ball not red: now there are 11 non-red balls left out of 14 total balls, so 11/14.\n\nSo, the probability for this sequence is (5/16) \u00d7 (4/15) \u00d7 (11/14).\n\nSimilarly, for the sequence Red, Not Red, Red:\n\nFirst ball red: 5/16.\n\nSecond ball not red: 11/15 (since one red is already drawn, total balls are now 15).\n\nThird ball red: 4/14.\n\nSo, probability is (5/16) \u00d7 (11/15) \u00d7 (4/14).\n\nAnd for the sequence Not Red, Red, Red:\n\nFirst ball not red: 11/16.\n\nSecond ball red: 5/15 (since one non-red is already drawn, total balls are now 15).\n\nThird ball red: 4/14.\n\nSo, probability is (11/16) \u00d7 (5/15) \u00d7 (4/14).\n\nNow, let's calculate each of these:\n\nFirst sequence: (5/16) \u00d7 (4/15) \u00d7 (11/14) = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 11) / (16 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 14) = 220 / 3360.\n\nSecond sequence: (5/16) \u00d7 (11/15) \u00d7 (4/14) = same as first sequence, 220 / 3360.\n\nThird sequence: (11/16) \u00d7 (5/15) \u00d7 (4/14) = again 220 / 3360.\n\nSo, total probability is 3 \u00d7 (220 / 3360) = 660 / 3360.\n\nSimplifying that: both numerator and denominator divisible by 60, so 11 / 56.\n\nSo, again, I get 11/56.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the combination approach I did earlier and get the same result.\n\nSo, the probability is 11/56.\n\nWait, but I recall that in probability without replacement, the combination approach is often more straightforward.\n\nSo, perhaps that's a better way to think about it.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 16 is C(16, 3) = 560.\n\nNumber of ways to choose exactly 2 red balls: choose 2 out of 5 red balls, which is C(5, 2) = 10, and choose 1 out of the remaining 11 balls (non-red), which is C(11, 1) = 11.\n\nSo, favorable outcomes = 10 \u00d7 11 = 110.\n\nProbability = 110 / 560 = 11/56.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of hypergeometric distribution, but I think the combination approach is sufficient here.\n\nSo, the final answer is 11/56.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{56}} \\]"
