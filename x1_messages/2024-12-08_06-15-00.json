        "content": "Let's tackle this equation step by step. The equation we're given is:\n\n3x - 7 = 2(x + 4) - x\n\nFirst, I need to simplify both sides of the equation. Let's start with the right side. There's a 2 being multiplied by (x + 4), and then we're subtracting x. So, I'll distribute the 2 into the parentheses:\n\n2 * x + 2 * 4 = 2x + 8\n\nNow, subtract x from that:\n\n2x + 8 - x = (2x - x) + 8 = x + 8\n\nSo, the right side simplifies to x + 8.\n\nNow, the equation looks like this:\n\n3x - 7 = x + 8\n\nNext, I want to get all the x terms on one side and the constant terms on the other side. Let's subtract x from both sides to get rid of the x on the right side:\n\n3x - x - 7 = x - x + 8\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2x - 7 = 8\n\nNow, I'll add 7 to both sides to move the constant term to the right side:\n\n2x - 7 + 7 = 8 + 7\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2x = 15\n\nFinally, I'll divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:\n\n2x / 2 = 15 / 2\n\nSo, x = 15/2, which is 7.5\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\n3x - 7 = 2(x + 4) - x\n\nDistribute the 2:\n\n3x - 7 = 2x + 8 - x\n\nCombine like terms on the right:\n\n3x - 7 = (2x - x) + 8 = x + 8\n\nNow, subtract x from both sides:\n\n3x - x - 7 = x - x + 8\n\n2x - 7 = 8\n\nAdd 7 to both sides:\n\n2x - 7 + 7 = 8 + 7\n\n2x = 15\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nx = 15/2 = 7.5\n\nSeems consistent. Let me verify by plugging x = 7.5 back into the original equation.\n\nLeft side: 3*(7.5) - 7 = 22.5 - 7 = 15.5\n\nRight side: 2*(7.5 + 4) - 7.5 = 2*(11.5) - 7.5 = 23 - 7.5 = 15.5\n\nBoth sides equal, so x = 7.5 is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.5} \\]"
