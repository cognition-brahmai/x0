        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces 120 widgets per hour. Each widget needs 3 minutes of labor from a worker. We need to find out how many workers are required to keep this production going.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the production rate and the labor time per widget. The factory produces 120 widgets every hour, and each widget takes 3 minutes to be labored on by a worker.\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, I can think about how much total labor time is required for the 120 widgets.\n\nEach widget takes 3 minutes, so for 120 widgets, the total labor time needed would be:\n\nTotal labor time = Number of widgets \u00d7 Labor time per widget\n\nTotal labor time = 120 widgets \u00d7 3 minutes/widget\n\nTotal labor time = 360 minutes\n\nNow, since the production is happening over the course of one hour (60 minutes), I need to find out how many workers are needed to provide 360 minutes of labor within that hour.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of workers as W.\n\nEach worker works for 60 minutes in the hour, so the total labor provided by W workers in one hour is:\n\nTotal labor provided = W workers \u00d7 60 minutes/worker\n\nWe need this total labor provided to be at least equal to the total labor time required, which is 360 minutes.\n\nSo, we set up the equation:\n\nW \u00d7 60 \u2265 360\n\nNow, solve for W:\n\nW \u2265 360 / 60\n\nW \u2265 6\n\nTherefore, at least 6 workers are needed to maintain the production rate of 120 widgets per hour, given that each widget requires 3 minutes of labor.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate how many widgets a single worker can handle in an hour.\n\nSince each widget takes 3 minutes, a worker can complete:\n\nNumber of widgets per worker = 60 minutes / 3 minutes/widget = 20 widgets/hour\n\nNow, the factory needs to produce 120 widgets per hour.\n\nSo, the number of workers required would be:\n\nNumber of workers = Total widgets needed / Widgets per worker\n\nNumber of workers = 120 / 20\n\nNumber of workers = 6\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation. So, it seems like 6 workers are needed.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any overlap or if workers can handle more than one widget at a time. The problem says each widget requires 3 minutes of labor from a worker, which suggests that a worker is dedicated to one widget at a time for those 3 minutes.\n\nIn a assembly line, workers might be working on different widgets simultaneously, but given that each widget needs 3 minutes of individual attention from a worker, it seems like the calculation holds.\n\nAnother angle to consider is if the labor time is spread out over the hour. For example, if a worker can switch between widgets, but since each widget needs continuous labor for 3 minutes, it's likely that a worker can only handle one widget at a time.\n\nSo, in conclusion, 6 workers are needed to produce 120 widgets per hour, with each widget requiring 3 minutes of labor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
