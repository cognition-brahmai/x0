        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a restaurant that currently serves 200 customers per day, and each customer orders one meal. That means they sell 200 meals a day right now.\n\nNow, the restaurant is thinking about increasing their prices by 20%. But, because of this price increase, they expect to lose 25% of their customers. We need to find out how many meals they will sell per day after this change.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many customers they will lose and how many they will keep after the price increase.\n\nLet's start by calculating 25% of their current 200 customers.\n\n25% of 200 is:\n\n(25/100) * 200 = 50 customers\n\nSo, they will lose 50 customers.\n\nThat means the number of customers they will have left is:\n\n200 - 50 = 150 customers\n\nSince each customer still orders one meal, they will sell 150 meals per day after the price increase.\n\nWait a minute, but the price increase is 20%. Does that affect the number of meals sold? Well, the problem says that as a result of the price increase, they lose 25% of their customers. It seems like the loss of customers is directly due to the price increase.\n\nSo, the price increase leads to a decrease in the number of customers by 25%, which we've calculated as 50 customers, leaving them with 150 customers.\n\nTherefore, they will sell 150 meals per day.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nMaybe the price increase affects the number of meals each customer orders. But the problem says each customer orders one meal, and there's no indication that the number of meals per customer changes. So, it's safe to assume that each remaining customer still orders one meal.\n\nAnother angle to consider: perhaps the problem is testing whether we consider the percentage changes correctly.\n\nOriginal number of meals: 200\n\nPrice increases by 20%, leading to losing 25% of customers.\n\nSo, losing 25% of 200 is 50 customers, as we calculated.\n\nAlternatively, we could think about the retention rate. If they lose 25% of customers, they retain 75% of their customers.\n\n75% of 200 is:\n\n(75/100) * 200 = 150 customers\n\nAgain, that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, it seems consistent that they will have 150 customers left, meaning they sell 150 meals per day.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the problem wants us to consider the revenue aspect, but it specifically asks for the number of meals sold per day.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in calculating the percentage loss.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\n25% of 200 is indeed 50.\n\n200 minus 50 is 150.\n\nAlternatively, 75% of 200 is 150.\n\nSeems solid.\n\nAnother way to think about it: if they lose 25% of their customers, that means they keep 75%.\n\n\nSo, meals sold = 200 * 75% = 150 meals.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the price increase, but since the question only asks for the number of meals sold, not the revenue, the price change doesn't directly affect the number of meals sold, assuming each customer still buys one meal.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 150 meals per day.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor involved.\n\nIs there any possibility that the remaining customers might order more or less meals due to the price increase? The problem doesn't suggest that, so we should stick to the information given.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies that each customer orders one meal, and doesn't mention any change in that behavior.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is 150 meals per day.\n\nSo, the final answer is 150 meals per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
