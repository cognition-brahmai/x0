        "content": "Sure! I'd be happy to help you create a basic calculator application in Java. We'll make sure it can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to building this application.\n\n### Step 1: Setting Up the Project\n\nFirst, make sure you have Java installed on your computer. You can download it from [oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) if you don't have it already.\n\nCreate a new Java class file, for example, `Calculator.java`.\n\n### Step 2: Import Necessary Packages\n\nFor this basic calculator, we won't need any additional packages beyond what's provided in the standard Java library.\n\n### Step 3: Design the Calculator Class\n\nWe'll create a simple command-line calculator. The program will prompt the user to enter two numbers and select an operation. Then, it will display the result.\n\nHere\u2019s the code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Calculator {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Enter first number:\");\n        double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.println(\"Enter second number:\");\n        double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.println(\"Choose an operation:\");\n        System.out.println(\"1. Addition\");\n        System.out.println(\"2. Subtraction\");\n        System.out.println(\"3. Multiplication\");\n        System.out.println(\"4. Division\");\n        int choice = scanner.nextInt();\n\n        double result = 0;\n        switch (choice) {\n            case 1:\n                result = num1 + num2;\n                break;\n            case 2:\n                result = num1 - num2;\n                break;\n            case 3:\n                result = num1 * num2;\n                break;\n            case 4:\n                if (num2 != 0) {\n                    result = num1 / num2;\n                } else {\n                    System.out.println(\"Error! Division by zero.\");\n                    System.exit(1);\n                }\n                break;\n            default:\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid choice.\");\n                System.exit(1);\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Importing Scanner:** We use `java.util.Scanner` to read input from the user.\n2. **Reading Inputs:** The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and stores them in `num1` and `num2`.\n3. **Choosing Operation:** The user selects an operation by entering a number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.).\n4. **Performing Calculation:** Based on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding operation.\n5. **Handling Division by Zero:** If the user chooses division and enters zero as the second number, the program displays an error message and exits.\n6. **Displaying Result:** The result of the operation is displayed on the screen.\n\n### Step 4: Compiling and Running the Program\n\n1. Save the file as `Calculator.java`.\n2. Open a command prompt or terminal.\n3. Navigate to the directory containing the `Calculator.java` file.\n4. Compile the program by running:\n   ```\n   javac Calculator.java\n   ```\n5. Run the program by executing:\n   ```\n   java Calculator\n   ```\n\n### Step 5: Testing the Calculator\n\n- Enter two numbers when prompted.\n- Select an operation by entering the corresponding number.\n- Verify that the result is correct.\n\nThis basic calculator should meet your requirements for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
