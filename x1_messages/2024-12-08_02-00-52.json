        "content": "So I have this problem here: a car factory produces 500 cars every week, and I need to find out how many cars it produces in a non-leap year. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many weeks there are in a non-leap year. A non-leap year has 365 days. Since there are 7 days in a week, I can calculate the number of weeks by dividing 365 by 7.\n\nLet me do that:\n\n365 \u00f7 7 = 52 weeks with a remainder. Let's find out what the remainder is.\n\n52 weeks \u00d7 7 days = 364 days.\n\nSo, 365 - 364 = 1 day extra.\n\nThat means there are 52 full weeks and 1 extra day in a non-leap year.\n\nNow, the factory produces 500 cars every week. So for 52 weeks, it would produce:\n\n500 cars/week \u00d7 52 weeks = 26,000 cars.\n\nBut there's that extra day to consider. Since the factory produces cars every day, I need to find out how many cars it produces in that extra day.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many cars are produced per day. The factory produces 500 cars in 7 days, so:\n\n500 cars \u00f7 7 days = approximately 71.4286 cars per day.\n\nSo, in one extra day, it would produce about 71.4286 cars.\n\nAdding that to the 26,000 cars from the 52 weeks:\n\n26,000 + 71.4286 \u2248 26,071.4286 cars.\n\nBut since you can't produce a fraction of a car, I should probably round this to the nearest whole number.\n\n26,071.4286 rounds to 26,071 cars.\n\nWait a minute, but the factory produces cars in whole numbers each day. Maybe I should consider that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory doesn't produce cars on the extra day if it only operates on standard weeks.\n\nBut the problem says \"every week,\" and doesn't specify anything about extra days, so maybe I should just consider the 52 weeks.\n\nLet me check that approach.\n\nOption 1: 52 weeks \u00d7 500 cars/week = 26,000 cars.\n\nOption 2: 52 weeks \u00d7 500 cars/week + 1 day's production.\n\nTo find one day's production: 500 cars / 7 days = approximately 71.4286 cars/day.\n\nSo, total production: 26,000 + 71.4286 \u2248 26,071 cars.\n\nBut since cars are whole units, perhaps the factory only produces cars in whole numbers each day, and the extra day would produce a full day's production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory operates every day of the year, including the extra day.\n\nIn that case, I should calculate the daily production and then multiply by 365 days.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nDaily production: 500 cars / 7 days = approximately 71.4286 cars/day.\n\nThen, for 365 days: 71.4286 cars/day \u00d7 365 days = ?\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 71.4286 \u00d7 365.\n\nWell, 70 \u00d7 365 = 25,550.\n\nAnd 1.4286 \u00d7 365 \u2248 521.429.\n\nSo, total production: 25,550 + 521.429 \u2248 26,071.429 cars.\n\nAgain, rounding to the nearest whole number: 26,071 cars.\n\nAlternatively, since the factory produces 500 cars every week, and there are 52.1429 weeks in a year (365 \u00f7 7), you could multiply 500 by 52.1429.\n\nLet's try that.\n\n500 \u00d7 52.1429 = 500 \u00d7 52 + 500 \u00d7 0.1429 = 26,000 + 71.45 \u2248 26,071.45 cars.\n\nAgain, rounding to 26,071 cars.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more precise way to calculate this.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf the factory produces 500 cars every week, and there are 365 days in a non-leap year, then the total production would be:\n\n(500 cars/week) \u00d7 (52 weeks/year) + (500 cars/week) \u00d7 (1/7 week/day) \u00d7 (1 day/year).\n\nSo, that's 500 \u00d7 52 + (500 / 7) \u00d7 1.\n\nWhich is 26,000 + 71.4286 \u2248 26,071 cars.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is:\n\nTotal production = (number of weeks in a year) \u00d7 (weekly production) + (extra days) \u00d7 (daily production).\n\nWe have 52 weeks and 1 extra day.\n\nSo, 52 \u00d7 500 + 1 \u00d7 (500 / 7) = 26,000 + 71.4286 \u2248 26,071 cars.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory operates every day, including the extra day, then it's 365 days of production.\n\nDaily production is 500 / 7 \u2248 71.4286 cars per day.\n\nSo, 365 \u00d7 71.4286 \u2248 26,071 cars.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory only produces in complete weeks, and the extra day doesn't count, then it's just 52 weeks \u00d7 500 cars/week = 26,000 cars.\n\nBut the problem says \"every week,\" which implies regular weekly production, but doesn't specify anything about extra days.\n\nHowever, since there are 365 days in a year, and 52 weeks only account for 364 days, there is that extra day to consider.\n\nIf the factory operates every day, then it's producing cars every day, including that extra day.\n\nSo, perhaps the more accurate approach is to calculate the daily production and then multiply by 365.\n\nTherefore:\n\nDaily production = 500 cars / 7 days \u2248 71.4286 cars per day.\n\nTotal production in a year = 71.4286 cars/day \u00d7 365 days = 26,071.429 cars.\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the factory produces approximately 26,071 cars in a non-leap year.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory only operates on weeks and not on the extra day, then it's 52 weeks \u00d7 500 cars/week = 26,000 cars.\n\nBut since the problem says \"every week,\" it's probably safer to include the extra day's production.\n\nSo, my final answer is approximately 26,071 cars in a non-leap year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{26071} \\]"
