        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a construction company building a large residential complex with 500 apartments across five buildings. Each apartment requires an average of 2000 square feet of flooring material. There are three types of flooring materials: hardwood, laminate, and carpet, with costs of $10, $5, and $3 per square foot, respectively.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total square footage of flooring required for the entire complex. Since there are 500 apartments and each requires 2000 square feet, the total square footage would be:\n\nTotal square footage = Number of apartments \u00d7 Square footage per apartment\nTotal square footage = 500 \u00d7 2000\nTotal square footage = 1,000,000 square feet\n\nNow, we need to allocate the flooring materials according to the given percentages of the total flooring budget. The company needs to allocate at least 30% for hardwood, no more than 40% for laminate, and the remaining amount for carpet.\n\nLet's denote the total flooring budget as B.\n\nSo, the allocation for each type of flooring material would be:\n\nHardwood: At least 30% of B\nLaminate: No more than 40% of B\nCarpet: The remaining amount, which would be B - (Hardwood + Laminate)\n\nBut wait a minute, I need to make sure that the sum of the percentages doesn't exceed 100%. Let's check:\n\nHardwood: at least 30%\nLaminate: no more than 40%\nCarpet: the remaining amount\n\nSo, the maximum allocation for hardwood is 30%, and the maximum for laminate is 40%, which would leave at least 30% for carpet (100% - 30% - 40% = 30%).\n\nHowever, the problem states \"at least 30% for hardwood\" and \"no more than 40% for laminate.\" So, the exact allocations depend on the choices made within these constraints.\n\nBut to calculate the total flooring budget, I need to find the total cost based on the square footage and the type of flooring used.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe I need to determine how much of each type of flooring material is used based on the square footage and then calculate the budget accordingly.\n\nLet me consider that the total square footage is 1,000,000 square feet.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nH = square footage of hardwood\nL = square footage of laminate\nC = square footage of carpet\n\nWe know that:\n\nH + L + C = 1,000,000\n\nThe costs are:\n\nCost of hardwood = $10 per sq ft\nCost of laminate = $5 per sq ft\nCost of carpet = $3 per sq ft\n\nSo, the total cost (budget) B would be:\n\nB = 10H + 5L + 3C\n\nNow, the problem states that the company needs to allocate at least 30% of the total flooring budget for hardwood and no more than 40% for laminate.\n\nSo:\n\nHardwood: 10H \u2265 0.3B\nLaminate: 5L \u2264 0.4B\n\nAnd C = 1,000,000 - H - L\n\nSubstituting C into the budget equation:\n\nB = 10H + 5L + 3(1,000,000 - H - L)\nB = 10H + 5L + 3,000,000 - 3H - 3L\nB = (10H - 3H) + (5L - 3L) + 3,000,000\nB = 7H + 2L + 3,000,000\n\nNow, from the hardwood allocation:\n\n10H \u2265 0.3B\n\nAnd from the laminate allocation:\n\n5L \u2264 0.4B\n\nLet's express H and L in terms of B.\n\nFrom the hardwood inequality:\n\n10H \u2265 0.3B\nH \u2265 0.03B\n\nFrom the laminate inequality:\n\n5L \u2264 0.4B\nL \u2264 0.08B\n\nAlso, since H + L \u2264 1,000,000 (because C \u2265 0), we have:\n\nH + L \u2264 1,000,000\n\nBut H \u2265 0.03B and L \u2264 0.08B, so combining these:\n\n0.03B + L \u2264 1,000,000\nL \u2264 1,000,000 - 0.03B\n\nBut we also have L \u2264 0.08B, so:\n\nL \u2264 min(1,000,000 - 0.03B, 0.08B)\n\nThis seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider the budget equation again:\n\nB = 7H + 2L + 3,000,000\n\nAnd we have H + L + C = 1,000,000, with C = 1,000,000 - H - L.\n\nAlso, 10H \u2265 0.3B and 5L \u2264 0.4B.\n\nThis is getting a bit messy. Maybe I need to set up the problem differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that the minimum allocation for hardwood is exactly 30% of the budget, and the maximum allocation for laminate is exactly 40% of the budget, and see what that implies.\n\nLet\u2019s assume:\n\n10H = 0.3B (minimum allocation for hardwood)\n5L = 0.4B (maximum allocation for laminate)\n\nThen, from the first equation:\n\nH = 0.03B\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\nL = 0.08B\n\nNow, C = 1,000,000 - H - L\nC = 1,000,000 - 0.03B - 0.08B\nC = 1,000,000 - 0.11B\n\nNow, the budget equation is:\n\nB = 10H + 5L + 3C\nB = 10(0.03B) + 5(0.08B) + 3(1,000,000 - 0.11B)\nB = 0.3B + 0.4B + 3,000,000 - 0.33B\nB = (0.3 + 0.4 - 0.33)B + 3,000,000\nB = 0.37B + 3,000,000\n\nNow, subtract 0.37B from both sides:\n\nB - 0.37B = 3,000,000\n0.63B = 3,000,000\n\nNow, solve for B:\n\nB = 3,000,000 / 0.63\nB \u2248 4,761,904.76\n\nSo, the total flooring budget is approximately $4,761,904.76.\n\nNow, let's find the allocation for each type of flooring material.\n\nHardwood:\n\nH = 0.03B\nH = 0.03 \u00d7 4,761,904.76\nH \u2248 142,857.14 square feet\n\nCost for hardwood:\n\n10 \u00d7 142,857.14 \u2248 1,428,571.40\n\nLaminate:\n\nL = 0.08B\nL = 0.08 \u00d7 4,761,904.76\nL \u2248 380,952.38 square feet\n\nCost for laminate:\n\n5 \u00d7 380,952.38 \u2248 1,904,761.90\n\nCarpet:\n\nC = 1,000,000 - H - L\nC = 1,000,000 - 142,857.14 - 380,952.38\nC \u2248 476,190.48 square feet\n\nCost for carpet:\n\n3 \u00d7 476,190.48 \u2248 1,428,571.44\n\nNow, let's check if the budget adds up:\n\nTotal budget = Cost of hardwood + Cost of laminate + Cost of carpet\nTotal budget \u2248 1,428,571.40 + 1,904,761.90 + 1,428,571.44\nTotal budget \u2248 4,761,904.74\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation of B \u2248 4,761,904.76.\n\nAlso, let's verify the allocations:\n\nHardwood allocation: 1,428,571.40 / 4,761,904.76 \u2248 0.2999 or 30%, which meets the minimum requirement.\n\nLaminate allocation: 1,904,761.90 / 4,761,904.76 \u2248 0.4, which is exactly 40%, meeting the maximum requirement.\n\nCarpet allocation: 1,428,571.44 / 4,761,904.76 \u2248 0.3, which is 30%.\n\nSo, the allocations are:\n\nHardwood: approximately $1,428,571.40\nLaminate: approximately $1,904,761.90\nCarpet: approximately $1,428,571.44\n\nTotal flooring budget: approximately $4,761,904.76\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4,761,904.76} \\]"
