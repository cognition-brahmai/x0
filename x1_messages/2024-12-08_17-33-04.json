        "content": "So, we've got this bacteria colony that doubles in size every 3 hours, and we want to know how many times larger it'll be after 1 day. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what's being asked. We have a colony of bacteria that doubles every 3 hours. So, starting from an initial size, after 3 hours, it's twice as big. After another 3 hours, it doubles again, and so on.\n\nThe question is, how many times larger is the colony after 1 full day. Now, 1 day has 24 hours, right? So, we need to find out how many 3-hour periods there are in 24 hours.\n\nLet me calculate that. 24 hours divided by 3 hours per period would be:\n\n24 \u00f7 3 = 8\n\nSo, there are 8 periods of 3 hours in 24 hours.\n\nNow, since the bacteria double every 3 hours, that means over 8 periods, they'll double 8 times.\n\nTo find out how many times larger the colony is after 8 doublings, we can use the formula for exponential growth. The general formula for exponential growth is:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount \u00d7 (growth rate)^(number of periods)\n\nIn this case, the growth rate is 2 (doubling), and the number of periods is 8.\n\nSo, Final amount = Initial amount \u00d7 2^8\n\nNow, 2 raised to the power of 8 is:\n\n2^8 = 256\n\nTherefore, the final amount is 256 times the initial amount.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nStarting with an initial size, after 3 hours, it's 2 times the initial.\n\nAfter 6 hours, it's 2 times that, so 4 times the initial.\n\nAfter 9 hours, it's 2 times that, so 8 times the initial.\n\nAfter 12 hours, it's 16 times.\n\nAfter 15 hours, it's 32 times.\n\nAfter 18 hours, it's 64 times.\n\nAfter 21 hours, it's 128 times.\n\nAfter 24 hours, it's 256 times.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of exponential functions. The size of the colony can be modeled by the function:\n\nSize = Initial \u00d7 2^(t/3)\n\nWhere t is the time in hours.\n\nSo, at t = 24 hours:\n\nSize = Initial \u00d7 2^(24/3) = Initial \u00d7 2^8 = Initial \u00d7 256\n\nAgain, that confirms that the colony is 256 times larger after 1 day.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using logarithms or something, but that seems unnecessary for this straightforward problem.\n\nIs there any chance I made a mistake in assuming that the doubling happens every 3 hours continuously? I think the problem states that it doubles every 3 hours, so it's discrete doubling at each 3-hour interval.\n\nWait, if it's a continuous growth rate, that would be different, but the problem says it doubles every 3 hours, which implies discrete doubling at each interval.\n\nSo, my approach should be correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the size at each 3-hour mark:\n\n- At t=0: Initial size\n\n- At t=3 hours: 2 \u00d7 Initial\n\n- At t=6 hours: 4 \u00d7 Initial\n\n- At t=9 hours: 8 \u00d7 Initial\n\n- At t=12 hours: 16 \u00d7 Initial\n\n- At t=15 hours: 32 \u00d7 Initial\n\n- At t=18 hours: 64 \u00d7 Initial\n\n- At t=21 hours: 128 \u00d7 Initial\n\n- At t=24 hours: 256 \u00d7 Initial\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think it's clear that the colony will be 256 times larger after 1 day.\n\nBut just to cover all bases, maybe I should consider whether the doubling is continuous or discrete. The problem says it doubles every 3 hours, which typically means discrete doubling at each interval, but maybe it's growing continuously.\n\nIf it's continuous growth, the formula would be:\n\nSize = Initial \u00d7 e^(rt)\n\nWhere r is the growth rate.\n\nBut in this case, since it doubles every 3 hours, we can find r such that:\n\n2 = e^(3r)\n\nTaking natural log of both sides:\n\nln(2) = 3r\n\nSo, r = ln(2)/3\n\nThen, at t=24 hours:\n\nSize = Initial \u00d7 e^( (ln(2)/3) \u00d7 24 ) = Initial \u00d7 e^( (ln(2)) \u00d7 8 ) = Initial \u00d7 e^(ln(2^8)) = Initial \u00d7 2^8 = Initial \u00d7 256\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nSo, whether we consider discrete doubling or continuous growth, we end up with the same factor of 256.\n\nTherefore, the bacteria colony will be 256 times larger after 1 day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{256} \\]"
