It's one of only three countries in the world that are enclaved within another, meaning its entire border is contained within another country's borders. The other two are San Marino and Vatican City, both enclaved within Italy. Lesotho's position makes it a landlocked country, and its relationship with South Africa is complex, involving issues of trade, water rights, and political ties."
