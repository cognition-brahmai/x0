        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 3 doctors in a small town, and each doctor has exactly 4 patients. That means in total, there are 3 doctors times 4 patients each, which is 12 patients in total.\n\nNow, one of the doctors moves away. So, there are only 2 doctors left. The patients of the doctor who moved away need to be divided equally among the remaining two doctors.\n\nThe doctor who moved away had 4 patients, so these 4 patients are divided equally between the two remaining doctors. That means each of the remaining doctors gets an additional 2 patients.\n\nSo, originally, each of the remaining doctors had 4 patients. Now, they each get 2 more patients. Therefore, each of the remaining doctors now has 4 + 2 = 6 patients.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. There were 12 patients in total at the beginning. One doctor moves away, taking their 4 patients with them, but actually, no, the patients are divided among the remaining doctors.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently.\n\nLet me think again: There are 3 doctors, each with 4 patients, so total patients are 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nOne doctor moves away, so their 4 patients need to be divided among the remaining two doctors.\n\nSo, 4 patients divided equally between 2 doctors means each doctor gets 2 additional patients.\n\nTherefore, the remaining doctors originally had 4 patients each, and now they each have 4 + 2 = 6 patients.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is that now there are only 2 doctors left to serve all 12 patients, but since the moving doctor took their 4 patients with them, no, wait, the patients are divided among the remaining doctors.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the patients of the moving doctor are redistributed.\n\nSo, initially:\n\nDoctor A: 4 patients\n\nDoctor B: 4 patients\n\nDoctor C: 4 patients\n\nTotal patients: 12\n\nDoctor C moves away, so their 4 patients are divided equally between Doctors A and B.\n\nEach of Doctors A and B gets 2 patients from Doctor C's list.\n\nTherefore:\n\nDoctor A: original 4 + 2 = 6 patients\n\nDoctor B: original 4 + 2 = 6 patients\n\nDoctor C: no longer in town, so 0 patients.\n\nBut the question asks how many patients each doctor has now. Since Doctor C has moved away, perhaps they still have their patients, or those patients were transferred.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"their patients are divided equally among the remaining two doctors.\" So, Doctor C's 4 patients are divided equally between Doctor A and Doctor B.\n\nTherefore, Doctor A and Doctor B each get 2 additional patients.\n\nSo, Doctor A: 4 + 2 = 6 patients\n\nDoctor B: 4 + 2 = 6 patients\n\nDoctor C: 0 patients (since they moved away).\n\nBut the question might be considering only the doctors still in town. So, perhaps it's only asking about Doctors A and B.\n\nIn that case, each of the remaining doctors has 6 patients.\n\nAlternatively, if Doctor C still has their patients with them, but in another town, then Doctor C might still have 4 patients, but the problem seems to imply that their patients are divided among the remaining doctors.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is that each of the remaining two doctors has 6 patients.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
