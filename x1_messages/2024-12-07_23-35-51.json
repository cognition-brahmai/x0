        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company with 100 employees, and they're distributing a total of $50,000 in bonuses. The top 10% of performers will get double the bonus amount compared to the other 90%. We need to find out how much each employee in the top 10% will receive.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many employees are in the top 10% and how many are in the remaining 90%.\n\nTotal employees = 100\n\nTop 10% performers = 10% of 100 = 0.10 * 100 = 10 employees\n\nOther 90% performers = 90% of 100 = 0.90 * 100 = 90 employees\n\nNow, let's denote the bonus amount that each of the 90% performers receives as x. Since the top 10% performers receive double that amount, each of them will receive 2x.\n\nNext, we need to set up an equation that accounts for the total bonus amount distributed.\n\nTotal bonus = (number of 90% performers * x) + (number of top 10% performers * 2x)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n50,000 = (90 * x) + (10 * 2x)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n50,000 = 90x + 20x\n\n50,000 = 110x\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 50,000 / 110\n\nx = 454.5454...\n\nSo, each of the 90% performers receives approximately $454.55.\n\nBut we're asked to find out how much each employee in the top 10% receives, which is 2x.\n\n2x = 2 * 454.5454... = 909.0909...\n\nTherefore, each employee in the top 10% will receive approximately $909.09.\n\nTo check if this makes sense, let's calculate the total bonus distributed with these amounts.\n\nTotal from 90% performers: 90 * 454.55 = 40,909.50\n\nTotal from top 10% performers: 10 * 909.09 = 9,090.90\n\nAdding them up: 40,909.50 + 9,090.90 = 50,000.40\n\nThere's a slight discrepancy due to rounding. To make it exact, we can use the precise value of x without rounding.\n\nx = 50,000 / 110 = 454.5454...\n\n2x = 909.0909...\n\nSo, each top performer gets $909.09 (repeating).\n\nAlternatively, we can express it as a fraction.\n\nx = 50,000 / 110 = 5,000 / 11 \u2248 454.5454...\n\n2x = 10,000 / 11 \u2248 909.0909...\n\nThus, each top performer receives $909.09.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{909.09} \\]"
