        "content": "So if someone drinks 3 cups of coffee every day, and we want to know how many cups they drink in a year, we need to do a bit of multiplication. First, we should know how many days there are in a year. Typically, there are 365 days in a year, right? But we have to consider leap years, which have 366 days. For now, let's assume it's a non-leap year.\n\nSo, if they drink 3 cups per day for 365 days, we can multiply 3 by 365 to get the total number of cups in a year. Let me do that calculation. 3 times 365 is... 3 times 300 is 900, and 3 times 65 is 195. So, 900 plus 195 equals 1095 cups in a year.\n\nBut wait, every four years, there's a leap year with an extra day. So, over four years, they would have one extra day of coffee drinking. That means an additional 3 cups every four years. So, if we're looking at a period that includes leap years, we should account for that.\n\nFor example, over four years, it would be 4 times 365, which is 1460 days, plus one extra day for the leap year, totaling 1461 days. So, 1461 days times 3 cups per day would be 4383 cups over four years.\n\nBut if we're just looking at a single year, whether it's a leap year or not, the calculation changes slightly. For a leap year, it would be 3 cups times 366 days, which is 1098 cups.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- In a non-leap year: 3 cups/day \u00d7 365 days = 1095 cups\n\n- In a leap year: 3 cups/day \u00d7 366 days = 1098 cups\n\nIf we're considering a long-term average, including leap years, we could calculate the average number of cups per year over a period that includes leap years.\n\nFor instance, over four years with one leap year:\n\nTotal cups = (3 cups/day \u00d7 365 days \u00d7 3 years) + (3 cups/day \u00d7 366 days \u00d7 1 year)\n\n= (3 \u00d7 365 \u00d7 3) + (3 \u00d7 366 \u00d7 1)\n\n= (3 \u00d7 1095) + (3 \u00d7 366)\n\n= 3285 + 1098\n\n= 4383 cups\n\nThen, the average per year would be 4383 cups / 4 years = 1095.75 cups per year.\n\nThis is very close to the 1095 cups in a non-leap year, with just a slight increase to account for the extra day every four years.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the average number of days in a year, considering leap years, and then multiply by the daily consumption.\n\nThe average length of a year, accounting for leap years, is approximately 365.2425 days (this is the Gregorian calendar average).\n\nSo, average cups per year = 3 cups/day \u00d7 365.2425 days/year = 1095.7275 cups/year.\n\nRounding that, it's about 1095.73 cups per year.\n\nBut for most practical purposes, people might just use 365 days and say 1095 cups per year.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that some years have more than one leap year, but in the Gregorian calendar, leap years occur every four years, so over a four-year period, there's one leap year.\n\nIf we're looking at a longer period, like 100 years, the rules get a bit more complicated because years divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they're also divisible by 400.\n\nFor example, the year 2000 was a leap year, but 1900 was not.\n\nBut for our purposes, assuming a typical four-year cycle with one leap year, the average is sufficient.\n\nSo, to answer the original question: if a person drinks 3 cups of coffee per day, they will drink approximately 1095 cups in a non-leap year, 1098 cups in a leap year, or on average about 1095.75 cups per year when accounting for leap years.\n\nIf more precision is needed, considering the exact average length of a year, it would be about 1095.7275 cups per year.\n\nBut for most purposes, saying 1095 cups per year is accurate enough.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1095} \\]"
