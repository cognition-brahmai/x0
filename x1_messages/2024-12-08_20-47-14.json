He showed a remarkable aptitude for learning and excelling in various subjects, particularly mathematics and science. Newton's intellectual prowess was evident from an early age, and he went on to make groundbreaking contributions to physics, mathematics, and astronomy. So, the notion that he was a poor student in his early years is a misconception."
