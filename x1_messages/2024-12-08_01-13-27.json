        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I have a cube with edge lengths of 6 inches, and I need to find out the total surface area of this cube. Okay, let's start from the beginning. I know that a cube is a three-dimensional shape with all sides equal, and it has six faces. Each face is a square, right? So, since all edges are 6 inches, each face should be a square with sides of 6 inches.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the area of a square. I think the area of a square is just the side length squared. So, for one face of the cube, the area would be 6 inches times 6 inches, which is 36 square inches.\n\nNow, since a cube has six faces, and all faces are identical squares, the total surface area should be six times the area of one face. So, that would be 6 times 36 square inches.\n\nLet me do the multiplication: 6 times 36. 6 times 30 is 180, and 6 times 6 is 36. So, 180 plus 36 equals 216 square inches.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Is there another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer?\n\nAnother way to think about the surface area of a cube is to use the formula SA = 6s\u00b2, where s is the length of an edge. In this case, s is 6 inches. So, plugging in the value, SA = 6 times (6 inches)\u00b2.\n\nFirst, calculate (6 inches)\u00b2, which is 36 square inches, and then multiply by 6, which again gives me 216 square inches. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there any other formula or method I should consider? I remember that for other 3D shapes, like cylinders or spheres, the surface area formulas are different, but for a cube, this should be correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any trick or if I'm missing something. The problem states that it's a cube with edge length 6 inches, and it's asking for total surface area. There are no additional constraints or unusual conditions mentioned, so I think the straightforward approach is appropriate.\n\nAlso, units are important here. Since we're dealing with area, the units should be in square inches, which I've used.\n\nLet me visualize this. A cube has six faces: top, bottom, front, back, left, and right. Each of these faces is a square with area 36 square inches, and summing them up gives 216 square inches.\n\nI think this makes sense. Unless there's some advanced concept or misunderstanding, this should be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{216} \\]"
