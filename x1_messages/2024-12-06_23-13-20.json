Zebras are native to Africa and are members of the Equidae family, which includes horses and donkeys. There are three main species of zebra: the plains zebra, the mountain zebra, and Grevy's zebra. Each species has distinct stripe patterns, and these stripes serve various purposes, including camouflage, social interaction, and pest prevention."
