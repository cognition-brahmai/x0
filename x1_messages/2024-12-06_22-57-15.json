        "content": "So there are 50 people in a room, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total. Hmm, this seems like a classic problem in combinatorics, which is a branch of mathematics dealing with counting and arrangements.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. If there are 50 people, and each shakes hands with every other person exactly once, that means person A shakes hands with person B, but then person B doesn't shake hands with person A again. It's a single handshake between each pair of people.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes should be equal to the number of unique pairs of people in the room. In mathematical terms, this is the number of combinations of 50 people taken 2 at a time, because a handshake involves 2 people.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items,\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose,\n\n- \\( n! \\) denotes the factorial of \\( n \\), which is the product of all positive integers up to \\( n \\).\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 50 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\), so the number of handshakes is \\( C(50, 2) \\).\n\nLet me plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[\nC(50, 2) = \\frac{50!}{2!(50 - 2)!} = \\frac{50!}{2! \\times 48!}\n\\]\n\nNow, \\( 50! \\) is \\( 50 \\times 49 \\times 48! \\), so the \\( 48! \\) terms cancel out:\n\n\\[\nC(50, 2) = \\frac{50 \\times 49 \\times 48!}{2! \\times 48!} = \\frac{50 \\times 49}{2!}\n\\]\n\nAnd \\( 2! \\) is \\( 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\), so:\n\n\\[\nC(50, 2) = \\frac{50 \\times 49}{2} = \\frac{2450}{2} = 1225\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there would be 1225 handshakes in total.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this to confirm the answer? Maybe using a different approach.\n\nAnother way is to consider that each of the 50 people shakes hands with 49 others. So, initially, it might seem like there are \\( 50 \\times 49 = 2450 \\) handshakes. However, this counts each handshake twice\u2014once for each participant in the handshake. So, to get the correct total, we need to divide by 2.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total handshakes} = \\frac{50 \\times 49}{2} = 1225\n\\]\n\nThis matches the previous result, which is a good sign.\n\nLet me consider yet another approach to be absolutely sure. Suppose there are 2 people: they shake hands once. For 3 people: each shakes hands with the other two, but since each handshake is shared between two people, it's \\( 3 \\times 2 / 2 = 3 \\) handshakes. For 4 people: \\( 4 \\times 3 / 2 = 6 \\) handshakes. This seems to follow the same formula.\n\nSo, extrapolating that, for 50 people, it should be \\( 50 \\times 49 / 2 = 1225 \\) handshakes.\n\nAdditionally, I can think about it recursively. If there are \\( n \\) people, the number of handshakes is \\( C(n, 2) \\). Adding one more person to \\( n \\) people would add \\( n \\) new handshakes (since the new person shakes hands with each of the existing \\( n \\) people). So, starting from \\( n = 2 \\), \\( C(2, 2) = 1 \\), then \\( n = 3 \\), add 2 more handshakes, total 3, and so on, up to \\( n = 50 \\).\n\nThis recursive thinking aligns with the combination formula, further confirming that the total number of handshakes is indeed 1225.\n\nIs there any possibility that I'm missing something here? Let's think about it differently. Suppose there are 50 people, and we want to count the number of unique pairs. This is exactly what the combination formula does.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to list out the handshakes for a smaller number and see if the formula holds. For example, with 4 people (A, B, C, D):\n\n- A shakes hands with B, C, D (3 handshakes)\n\n- B shakes hands with C, D (2 handshakes, but AB is already counted)\n\n- C shakes hands with D (1 handshake, AB and AC already counted)\n\n- D has already shaken hands with A, B, C\n\nTotal handshakes: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6, which matches \\( C(4, 2) = 6 \\).\n\nSimilarly, for 50 people, the total should be \\( C(50, 2) = 1225 \\).\n\nAnother angle: in graph theory, this can be represented as a complete graph with 50 vertices, where each vertex represents a person and each edge represents a handshake. The number of edges in a complete graph with \\( n \\) vertices is \\( C(n, 2) \\), which again is \\( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\). Plugging in \\( n = 50 \\), we get \\( \\frac{50 \\times 49}{2} = 1225 \\).\n\nSo, from multiple perspectives\u2014combinatorics, recursive reasoning, and graph theory\u2014the answer remains consistent: there are 1225 handshakes.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any chance of overcounting or undercounting. In the combination approach, each pair is counted exactly once, and since handshakes are unique events between two people, without repetition, this seems accurate.\n\nAlso, assuming that no one shakes hands with themselves, which makes sense in this context.\n\nTherefore, I am confident that the total number of handshakes is 1225.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1225} \\]"
