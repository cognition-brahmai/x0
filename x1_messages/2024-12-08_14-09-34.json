        "content": "Okay, I'll create a C++ class for a trie data structure. A trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree data structure used for efficient retrieval of a key in a dataset of strings. It's particularly useful for tasks like auto-completion, spell-checking, and routing tables.\n\nFirst, I need to define the structure of a trie node. Each node will have a map or an array of pointers to its children nodes, corresponding to each possible character. For simplicity, I'll assume we're working with lowercase English letters, so I'll use an array of size 26.\n\nEach node should also have a flag to indicate whether it marks the end of a word. Additionally, I might want to keep track of the frequency of words or other metadata, but for now, I'll keep it simple.\n\nSo, the TrieNode class might look like this:\n\n```cpp\nclass TrieNode {\npublic:\n    TrieNode* children[26];\n    bool isEndOfWord;\n\n    TrieNode() {\n        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n            children[i] = nullptr;\n        }\n        isEndOfWord = false;\n    }\n};\n```\n\nNext, I'll create the Trie class, which will have methods to insert words, delete words, and check if a word exists in the trie.\n\nStarting with insertion: To insert a word into the trie, I'll start from the root and iterate through each character in the word. For each character, I'll check if there is a child node corresponding to that character. If not, I'll create a new node. Then, I'll move to the child node and repeat the process for the next character. Finally, I'll set the isEndOfWord flag to true for the node corresponding to the last character of the word.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the insert method:\n\n```cpp\nclass Trie {\nprivate:\n    TrieNode* root;\n\npublic:\n    Trie() {\n        root = new TrieNode();\n    }\n\n    void insert(string word) {\n        TrieNode* current = root;\n        for (char ch : word) {\n            int index = ch - 'a';\n            if (current->children[index] == nullptr) {\n                current->children[index] = new TrieNode();\n            }\n            current = current->children[index];\n        }\n        current->isEndOfWord = true;\n    }\n};\n```\n\nNow, for checking if a word exists in the trie: I'll traverse the trie from the root, following the path defined by the characters in the word. If I reach the end of the word and the current node has isEndOfWord set to true, then the word exists in the trie.\n\nHere's the exists method:\n\n```cpp\nbool exists(string word) {\n    TrieNode* current = root;\n    for (char ch : word) {\n        int index = ch - 'a';\n        if (current->children[index] == nullptr) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        current = current->children[index];\n    }\n    return current->isEndOfWord;\n}\n```\n\nDeleting a word from the trie is a bit trickier. I need to remove the word while ensuring that common prefixes are not removed if other words share them. I should also handle the case where multiple words share a suffix.\n\nOne approach is to mark the end of word flag as false when deleting, but only if the node has no children. If it has children, it means that part of the word is a prefix for other words, so I should just unset the end of word flag.\n\nAlternatively, I can fully remove nodes that become irrelevant after deletion, i.e., nodes that have no children and are not the end of another word.\n\nI'll implement the latter approach for a more memory-efficient trie.\n\nHere's a rough idea for the delete method:\n\n1. Traverse the trie to the node corresponding to the last character of the word.\n\n2. If the node does not exist, the word is not in the trie, so do nothing.\n\n3. If the node exists, set its isEndOfWord flag to false.\n\n4. Recursively delete nodes from the bottom up if they have no children.\n\nHere's the delete method:\n\n```cpp\nvoid deleteWord(string word) {\n    deleteWordHelper(root, word, 0);\n}\n\nbool deleteWordHelper(TrieNode* current, string word, int index) {\n    if (index == word.size()) {\n        if (!current->isEndOfWord) {\n            // Word doesn't exist\n            return false;\n        }\n        current->isEndOfWord = false;\n        // If node has children, don't delete it\n        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n            if (current->children[i] != nullptr) {\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n        // No children, safe to delete\n        delete current;\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    int ch = word[index] - 'a';\n    if (current->children[ch] == nullptr) {\n        // Word doesn't exist\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    bool shouldDeleteCurrent = deleteWordHelper(current->children[ch], word, index + 1);\n\n    if (shouldDeleteCurrent) {\n        current->children[ch] = nullptr;\n        // Check if current node has any children left\n        bool hasChildren = false;\n        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n            if (current->children[i] != nullptr) {\n                hasChildren = true;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if (!hasChildren && !current->isEndOfWord) {\n            delete current;\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nI need to be careful with memory management here. When deleting nodes, I must ensure that I'm not deleting nodes that are still in use by other words.\n\nAlso, I should consider adding a destructor to the Trie class to clean up all nodes when the trie is destroyed.\n\nHere's a simple destructor:\n\n```cpp\n~Trie() {\n    delete root;\n}\n```\n\nBut I need to make sure that all child nodes are properly deleted as well. So, I should implement a recursive delete function in the TrieNode class.\n\nLet's add a delete function to TrieNode:\n\n```cpp\nclass TrieNode {\npublic:\n    TrieNode* children[26];\n    bool isEndOfWord;\n\n    TrieNode() {\n        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n            children[i] = nullptr;\n        }\n        isEndOfWord = false;\n    }\n\n    ~TrieNode() {\n        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n            if (children[i] != nullptr) {\n                delete children[i];\n            }\n        }\n    }\n};\n```\n\nThis way, when the trie is destroyed, all nodes will be properly deleted.\n\nFinally, I should consider adding other useful methods, such as searching for prefixes, listing all words with a given prefix, or checking if any word exists with a given prefix.\n\nFor example, a method to check if any word exists with a given prefix:\n\n```cpp\nbool startsWith(string prefix) {\n    TrieNode* current = root;\n    for (char ch : prefix) {\n        int index = ch - 'a';\n        if (current->children[index] == nullptr) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        current = current->children[index];\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\nAnd a method to list all words with a given prefix could be implemented using recursion and depth-first search.\n\nBut for now, I'll stick to the basic insert, delete, and exists methods.\n\nLet me summarize the complete Trie class:\n\n```cpp\nclass TrieNode {\npublic:\n    TrieNode* children[26];\n    bool isEndOfWord;\n\n    TrieNode() {\n        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n            children[i] = nullptr;\n        }\n        isEndOfWord = false;\n    }\n\n    ~TrieNode() {\n        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n            if (children[i] != nullptr) {\n                delete children[i];\n            }\n        }\n    }\n};\n\nclass Trie {\nprivate:\n    TrieNode* root;\n\npublic:\n    Trie() {\n        root = new TrieNode();\n    }\n\n    ~Trie() {\n        delete root;\n    }\n\n    void insert(string word) {\n        TrieNode* current = root;\n        for (char ch : word) {\n            int index = ch - 'a';\n            if (current->children[index] == nullptr) {\n                current->children[index] = new TrieNode();\n            }\n            current = current->children[index];\n        }\n        current->isEndOfWord = true;\n    }\n\n    bool exists(string word) {\n        TrieNode* current = root;\n        for (char ch : word) {\n            int index = ch - 'a';\n            if (current->children[index] == nullptr) {\n                return false;\n            }\n            current = current->children[index];\n        }\n        return current->isEndOfWord;\n    }\n\n    void deleteWord(string word) {\n        deleteWordHelper(root, word, 0);\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    bool deleteWordHelper(TrieNode* current, string word, int index) {\n        if (index == word.size()) {\n            if (!current->isEndOfWord) {\n                return false;\n            }\n            current->isEndOfWord = false;\n            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n                if (current->children[i] != nullptr) {\n                    return false;\n                }\n            }\n            delete current;\n            return true;\n        }\n\n        int ch = word[index] - 'a';\n        if (current->children[ch] == nullptr) {\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        bool shouldDeleteCurrent = deleteWordHelper(current->children[ch], word, index + 1);\n\n        if (shouldDeleteCurrent) {\n            current->children[ch] = nullptr;\n            bool hasChildren = false;\n            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n                if (current->children[i] != nullptr) {\n                    hasChildren = true;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            if (!hasChildren && !current->isEndOfWord) {\n                delete current;\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n\n        return false;\n    }\n};\n```\n\nThis should cover the basic functionality of a trie in C++. I can further optimize and add more features as needed.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement a Trie data structure in C++, we need to create a class that efficiently handles operations like insertion, deletion, and existence checks for words. Below is a comprehensive implementation of such a class.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **TrieNode Structure**:\n   - Each node contains an array of pointers to its child nodes, assuming lowercase English letters (26 letters).\n   - A boolean flag `isEndOfWord` to mark the end of a word.\n\n2. **Trie Class**:\n   - **Insertion**: Traverse the Trie, creating new nodes for characters not present on the path.\n   - **Existence Check**: Traverse the Trie to see if the word path exists and if the final node marks the end of a word.\n   - **Deletion**: Traverse to the word's terminal node, unset the `isEndOfWord` flag, and recursively delete nodes that become unused.\n\n3. **Memory Management**:\n   - Implement a destructor for `TrieNode` to ensure all child nodes are properly deleted when a node is destroyed.\n   - The `Trie` class manages the root node and cleans up all nodes through its destructor.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```cpp\nclass TrieNode {\npublic:\n    TrieNode* children[26];\n    bool isEndOfWord;\n\n    TrieNode() {\n        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n            children[i] = nullptr;\n        }\n        isEndOfWord = false;\n    }\n\n    ~TrieNode() {\n        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n            if (children[i] != nullptr) {\n                delete children[i];\n            }\n        }\n    }\n};\n\nclass Trie {\nprivate:\n    TrieNode* root;\n\npublic:\n    Trie() {\n        root = new TrieNode();\n    }\n\n    ~Trie() {\n        delete root;\n    }\n\n    void insert(const std::string& word) {\n        TrieNode* current = root;\n        for (char ch : word) {\n            int index = ch - 'a';\n            if (current->children[index] == nullptr) {\n                current->children[index] = new TrieNode();\n            }\n            current = current->children[index];\n        }\n        current->isEndOfWord = true;\n    }\n\n    bool search(const std::string& word) {\n        TrieNode* current = root;\n        for (char ch : word) {\n            int index = ch - 'a';\n            if (current->children[index] == nullptr) {\n                return false;\n            }\n            current = current->children[index];\n        }\n        return current->isEndOfWord;\n    }\n\n    void remove(const std::string& word) {\n        removeHelper(root, word, 0);\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    bool removeHelper(TrieNode* current, const std::string& word, int index) {\n        if (index == word.size()) {\n            if (!current->isEndOfWord) {\n                return false;\n            }\n            current->isEndOfWord = false;\n            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n                if (current->children[i] != nullptr) {\n                    return false;\n                }\n            }\n            delete current;\n            return true;\n        }\n\n        int ch = word[index] - 'a';\n        if (current->children[ch] == nullptr) {\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        bool shouldDeleteCurrent = removeHelper(current->children[ch], word, index + 1);\n\n        if (shouldDeleteCurrent) {\n            current->children[ch] = nullptr;\n            bool hasChildren = false;\n            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n                if (current->children[i] != nullptr) {\n                    hasChildren = true;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            if (!hasChildren && !current->isEndOfWord) {\n                delete current;\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n\n        return false;\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **TrieNode**: Represents each node in the Trie, containing links to child nodes and a flag to indicate the end of a word.\n- **Trie**: Manages the root node and provides methods to insert, search, and remove words.\n  - **insert**: Adds a word to the Trie, creating new nodes for characters as needed.\n  - **search**: Checks if a word exists in the Trie.\n  - **remove**: Deletes a word from the Trie, removing nodes that are no longer used.\n\nThis implementation ensures efficient operations typical of a Trie data structure, suitable for applications requiring fast string retrieval and manipulation."
