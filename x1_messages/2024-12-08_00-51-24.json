        "content": "So, I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. The original dimensions are a length of 15 meters and a width of 8 meters. The gardener wants to increase the width by 2 meters but keep the same area. I need to find out what the new length will be.\n\nFirst, I should probably remember the formula for the area of a rectangle. It's length times width, right? So, the original area is 15 meters times 8 meters, which is 120 square meters.\n\nNow, the gardener is increasing the width by 2 meters. So, the new width will be 8 meters plus 2 meters, which is 10 meters.\n\nThe problem says the area should remain the same, so the new area should still be 120 square meters.\n\nLet me denote the new length as L. So, the new area is L times the new width, which is 10 meters, and that should equal 120 square meters.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation: L * 10 = 120.\n\nTo find L, I just need to divide both sides of the equation by 10.\n\nSo, L = 120 / 10 = 12 meters.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there anything I'm missing?\n\nLet me double-check the original area: 15 * 8 = 120 square meters. Yes.\n\nNew width: 8 + 2 = 10 meters.\n\nNew area should be the same: 120 square meters.\n\nSo, L * 10 = 120.\n\nL = 12 meters.\n\nHmm, that makes sense. The length is decreasing from 15 meters to 12 meters to compensate for the increase in width to keep the area constant.\n\nI think that's the answer: the new length will be 12 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
