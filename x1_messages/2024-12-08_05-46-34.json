        "content": "Let's break this down. So, the car rental company charges $50 per day and an additional $0.20 per mile driven. I rented the car for 3 days and drove it for 200 miles. I need to find out the total cost.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the cost for the days I rented the car. It's $50 per day for 3 days. So, that should be $50 multiplied by 3.\n\n$50 * 3 = $150\n\nThat's the cost for the rental days.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost for the miles I drove. It's $0.20 per mile for 200 miles. So, that's $0.20 multiplied by 200.\n\n$0.20 * 200 = $40\n\nThat's the cost for the miles driven.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I need to add both amounts together.\n\n$150 (rental days) + $40 (miles driven) = $190\n\nSo, the total rental cost should be $190.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different formula or something I'm missing. Let's see.\n\nThe total cost (C) is equal to the daily rental fee multiplied by the number of days (D) plus the mileage fee per mile (M) multiplied by the number of miles (Miles).\n\nSo, C = (D * R) + (M * Miles)\n\nWhere:\n\n- D is the number of days\n\n- R is the daily rental fee\n\n- M is the mileage fee per mile\n\n- Miles is the total miles driven\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nC = (3 * 50) + (0.20 * 200) = 150 + 40 = 190\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a package deal or something, but the problem doesn't mention any discounts or additional fees, so I think $190 is the correct total cost.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other costs that might be involved.\n\nFor example, sometimes there are drop-off fees if you return the car at a different location, or there might be insurance fees, but the problem doesn't mention any of that. It only mentions a daily rental fee and a per-mile fee.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the total cost should be $190.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{190} \\]"
