        "content": "So I have this problem here: \"If a spherical ball has a diameter of 6 inches, what is its volume in cubic inches?\" Okay, I know that the volume of a sphere can be calculated using a specific formula, but I'm a bit rusty on the details. Let me try to recall it.\n\nI think the formula for the volume of a sphere is something like V = (4/3) * \u03c0 * r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So, first things first, I need to find the radius of the sphere.\n\nThe problem gives me the diameter, which is 6 inches. I know that the radius is half of the diameter, so r = d/2. Therefore, r = 6/2 = 3 inches. Alright, so r = 3 inches.\n\nNow, plugging that into the formula: V = (4/3) * \u03c0 * (3)^3. Let me calculate 3 cubed. 3^3 = 3 * 3 * 3 = 27. So, V = (4/3) * \u03c0 * 27.\n\nNext, I can simplify this. (4/3) * 27 = (4 * 27) / 3 = 108 / 3 = 36. So, V = 36\u03c0.\n\nHmm, but the problem asks for the volume in cubic inches, and \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159. Should I leave the answer in terms of \u03c0 or compute the numerical value?\n\nWell, sometimes leaving it in terms of \u03c0 is acceptable, especially if the problem doesn't specify to use a decimal approximation. But since it asks for cubic inches, maybe I should provide a numerical value.\n\nLet me check. If I use \u03c0 \u2248 3.14, then V \u2248 36 * 3.14 = 113.04 cubic inches.\n\nAlternatively, if I use a more precise value for \u03c0, say 3.14159, then V \u2248 36 * 3.14159 \u2248 113.097 cubic inches.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider significant figures. The given diameter is 6 inches, which has one significant figure, so maybe the answer should be rounded to one significant figure as well.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? I think diameter is given as 6 inches, which has one significant figure, but in practice, especially in physics and engineering, we often consider that simple numbers like 6 have infinite significant figures unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to assume that it has two significant figures, given that it's a measurement in inches, which is a standard unit.\n\nTo be safe, I'll keep the answer in terms of \u03c0, which is exact, and also provide the numerical approximation to two decimal places.\n\nSo, the volume is 36\u03c0 cubic inches, which is approximately 113.10 cubic inches.\n\nWait, but 36 * \u03c0 is actually 113.097..., so rounding to two decimal places would be 113.10, as I thought.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the formula: V = (4/3) * \u03c0 * r^3.\n\nGiven d = 6 inches, so r = 3 inches.\n\nThen, r^3 = 27 cubic inches.\n\nThen, (4/3) * 27 = 36.\n\nSo, V = 36\u03c0 cubic inches \u2248 113.10 cubic inches.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it differently. Maybe I can use the formula for the volume of a sphere in terms of diameter. I recall there's a formula like V = (\u03c0 * d^3)/6, but let me verify that.\n\nIf V = (4/3) * \u03c0 * r^3 and r = d/2, then substituting r:\n\nV = (4/3) * \u03c0 * (d/2)^3 = (4/3) * \u03c0 * (d^3 / 8) = (4/3 * 1/8) * \u03c0 * d^3 = (1/6) * \u03c0 * d^3.\n\nSo, yes, V = (\u03c0 * d^3)/6.\n\nLet me try using this formula with d = 6 inches.\n\nV = (\u03c0 * 6^3)/6 = (\u03c0 * 216)/6 = (216\u03c0)/6 = 36\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nSame as before. So, that's a good check.\n\nAlternatively, if I had missed something in the first formula, the second approach confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the volume is 36\u03c0 cubic inches, or approximately 113.10 cubic inches.\n\nI think it's appropriate to provide both the exact value in terms of \u03c0 and the decimal approximation.\n\nSo, the final answer is 36\u03c0 cubic inches, or approximately 113.10 cubic inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36\\pi \\text{ cubic inches} \\approx 113.10 \\text{ cubic inches}} \\]"
