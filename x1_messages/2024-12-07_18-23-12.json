        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the bakery wants to expand its product offerings by adding gluten-free options, and they plan to dedicate 20% of their production capacity to these gluten-free products. Currently, they produce 10,000 units daily, with an average cost of $1 per unit. The cost of producing gluten-free items is estimated to be 50% higher than regular products. We need to calculate the daily production quantity and cost for both regular and gluten-free items after this expansion.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the current situation is:\n\n- Total daily production: 10,000 units\n\n- Cost per regular unit: $1\n\n- Cost of gluten-free units: 50% higher than regular units\n\nSo, the cost per gluten-free unit would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost per gluten-free unit} = \\$1 + (50\\% \\times \\$1) = \\$1 + \\$0.50 = \\$1.50 \\]\n\nNow, they plan to dedicate 20% of their production capacity to gluten-free products. This means that 20% of their total production will be gluten-free, and the remaining 80% will be regular products.\n\nLet's calculate the production quantities:\n\n- Gluten-free production: 20% of 10,000 units\n\n\\[ \\text{Gluten-free units} = 0.20 \\times 10,000 = 2,000 \\text{ units} \\]\n\n- Regular production: 80% of 10,000 units\n\n\\[ \\text{Regular units} = 0.80 \\times 10,000 = 8,000 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total daily production cost for both regular and gluten-free items.\n\nFirst, the cost for regular units:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost for regular units} = 8,000 \\text{ units} \\times \\$1/\\text{unit} = \\$8,000 \\]\n\nThen, the cost for gluten-free units:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost for gluten-free units} = 2,000 \\text{ units} \\times \\$1.50/\\text{unit} = \\$3,000 \\]\n\nNow, to find the total daily production cost:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total daily production cost} = \\$8,000 + \\$3,000 = \\$11,000 \\]\n\nSo, after the expansion:\n\n- Regular units: 8,000 units at $1 each, totaling $8,000\n\n- Gluten-free units: 2,000 units at $1.50 each, totaling $3,000\n\n- Total production cost: $11,000\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check if the total production capacity remains the same or if it's increasing. The problem says they plan to dedicate 20% of their production capacity to gluten-free products, assuming that the total production capacity remains at 10,000 units daily.\n\nHowever, sometimes when expanding product lines, especially if they require different processes or ingredients, there might be changes in overall production capacity. But based on the information provided, it seems that the total production volume stays the same, just with a reallocation of production types.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the cost increase for gluten-free products affects the overall average cost. Initially, all units were $1 each, totaling $10,000 daily. Now, with the new mix, the total cost is $11,000 for the same number of units, which would increase the average cost per unit.\n\nLet's calculate the new average cost per unit:\n\n\\[ \\text{New average cost per unit} = \\frac{\\$11,000}{10,000 \\text{ units}} = \\$1.10 \\text{ per unit} \\]\n\nSo, by introducing gluten-free products that cost more to produce, the average cost per unit increases by $0.10.\n\nMoreover, it's essential to consider if the sales price for gluten-free products is higher to cover the increased production costs. If the bakery sells gluten-free products at a higher price point, they might still maintain their profit margins. However, that information isn't provided in the problem, so we'll focus on the production costs.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Daily production quantity for regular items: 8,000 units\n\n- Daily production cost for regular items: $8,000\n\n- Daily production quantity for gluten-free items: 2,000 units\n\n- Daily production cost for gluten-free items: $3,000\n\n- Total daily production cost: $11,000\n\nI think this covers what's being asked. If there's any other aspect or if I've missed something, please let me know."
