        "content": "So, I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. The length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet, and I need to find out the area in square feet. Alright, let's see. I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, if length is 20 feet and width is 15 feet, I just need to multiply 20 by 15 to get the area.\n\nLet me write that down: Area = length \u00d7 width = 20 feet \u00d7 15 feet.\n\nNow, multiplying 20 by 15. Well, 20 times 10 is 200, and 20 times 5 is 100, so altogether that's 200 + 100 = 300. So, the area should be 300 square feet.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to check this? Maybe I can use the formula for the area again, just to make sure I'm doing this right. Yes, Area = l \u00d7 w, which is 20 \u00d7 15. Let me try to multiply them again: 20 times 15 is indeed 300.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in smaller parts. Suppose I break down the length into 10 + 10, so two parts of 10 feet each. Then, the area would be (10 \u00d7 15) + (10 \u00d7 15) = 150 + 150 = 300 square feet. Same answer.\n\nOr, maybe I can use the width to break it down. Width is 15 feet, which can be 10 + 5. So, area would be (20 \u00d7 10) + (20 \u00d7 5) = 200 + 100 = 300 square feet again.\n\nSeems consistent. I think I've got it right. But, to be extra sure, maybe I can use a different approach. What if I use the diagonal to find the area or something? Wait, no, that's not necessary for a rectangle. The area is straightforward: just length times width.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to visualize the garden. If it's 20 feet long and 15 feet wide, that means it's a big rectangular space. If I were to lay out square tiles of 1 foot by 1 foot, how many would I need to cover the entire garden? Well, 20 feet in length means 20 tiles along the length, and 15 feet in width means 15 tiles along the width. So, total tiles would be 20 times 15, which is again 300 tiles. Therefore, the area is 300 square feet.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. I've confirmed it with multiple methods, and all of them point to 300 square feet. I don't see any reason to doubt this. Unless, of course, there's some trick to the problem that I'm missing. Maybe someone thinks that the garden has a different shape or something, but the problem clearly states that it's rectangular with length 20 feet and width 15 feet.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's recall the definition of area for a rectangle. The area is the product of its length and width, and the unit is square feet, which makes sense because feet times feet is square feet.\n\nSo, final answer: the area of the garden is 300 square feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
