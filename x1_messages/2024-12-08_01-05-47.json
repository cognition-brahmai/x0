        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains moving towards each other. One leaves from Town A to Town B at 60 mph, and the other leaves from Town B to Town A at 90 mph. The distance between the towns is 180 miles. I need to find out when they will meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that since both trains are moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. So, the relative speed is 60 mph + 90 mph = 150 mph.\n\nNow, the total distance between them is 180 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Relative Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 180 miles / 150 mph = 1.2 hours\n\nBut maybe I should check if this makes sense. Let's see, in 1.2 hours, the first train would have traveled 60 mph * 1.2 hours = 72 miles. The second train would have traveled 90 mph * 1.2 hours = 108 miles. Adding those up: 72 + 108 = 180 miles, which is the total distance between the towns. So, yes, they would have covered the entire distance between them in 1.2 hours.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps I can set up an equation based on the time each train has been traveling.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time until they meet as t hours.\n\nThen, the distance covered by the first train is 60t miles, and the distance covered by the second train is 90t miles. Since they are moving towards each other, the sum of these distances should equal the total distance between the towns:\n\n60t + 90t = 180\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n150t = 180\n\nNow, solving for t:\n\nt = 180 / 150 = 1.2 hours\n\nAgain, I get the same answer. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how fast the distance between the two trains is closing. Since they are moving towards each other, the rate at which the distance decreases is the sum of their speeds, which is 150 mph, as I thought earlier. So, the time it takes for the distance to close from 180 miles to 0 miles is indeed 180 / 150 = 1.2 hours.\n\nI wonder if there's a way to visualize this. Maybe I can plot the positions of both trains over time on a graph. The x-axis could represent time in hours, and the y-axis could represent the distance from Town A.\n\nFor the first train, starting at Town A, its distance from Town A would increase linearly at 60 miles per hour.\n\nFor the second train, starting at Town B, its distance from Town A would decrease linearly at 90 miles per hour, since it's moving towards Town A.\n\nThe point where their paths cross on the graph would be the time when they meet.\n\nBut since I've already calculated it twice and got the same answer, I think it's safe to conclude that they will meet after 1.2 hours.\n\nWait, but 1.2 hours is the same as 1 hour and 12 minutes. Because 0.2 hours is 0.2 * 60 minutes = 12 minutes.\n\nSo, if they both leave at, say, 1:00 PM, they would meet at 2:12 PM.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.2 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
