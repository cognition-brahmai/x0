        "content": "So I read 25 pages in half an hour, and I want to know how long it'll take to read a 300-page book. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many pages I read per minute. If I read 25 pages in half an hour, that's 30 minutes, right? So, 25 pages in 30 minutes. To find pages per minute, I can divide the number of pages by the number of minutes.\n\nPages per minute = 25 pages / 30 minutes = 0.8333 pages per minute.\n\nWait, that seems a bit slow. Maybe I should think in terms of pages per hour instead. Since half an hour is 30 minutes, in one hour I would read twice that amount, right?\n\nSo, in one hour, I read 25 pages * 2 = 50 pages per hour.\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, my reading speed is 50 pages per hour.\n\nNow, I have a 300-page book to read. To find out how many hours it will take, I can divide the total number of pages by the reading speed.\n\nTime = Total pages / Pages per hour = 300 pages / 50 pages per hour = 6 hours.\n\nSo, it should take me 6 hours to read the entire book.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using proportions.\n\nIf 25 pages take 30 minutes, then 300 pages will take x minutes.\n\nSo, 25 pages : 30 minutes = 300 pages : x minutes.\n\nThis is a proportion, so I can set it up as:\n\n25/30 = 300/x\n\nWait, actually, it's inverse, because more pages should take more time. So, it should be direct proportion.\n\nLet me set it up correctly.\n\nIf 25 pages take 30 minutes, then 300 pages will take (30 minutes / 25 pages) * 300 pages.\n\nFirst, find the time per page, which is 30 minutes / 25 pages = 1.2 minutes per page.\n\nThen, for 300 pages, it's 1.2 minutes per page * 300 pages = 360 minutes.\n\nNow, convert 360 minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 360 minutes / 60 = 6 hours.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe using unit rates.\n\nMy reading rate is 50 pages per hour, as I calculated before.\n\nSo, for 300 pages, time = total pages / reading rate = 300 / 50 = 6 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of time per page.\n\nTime per page = 30 minutes / 25 pages = 1.2 minutes per page.\n\nThen, for 300 pages, total time = 1.2 minutes/page * 300 pages = 360 minutes, which is 6 hours.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same conclusion: it will take 6 hours to read a 300-page book if I read at a rate of 25 pages in half an hour.\n\nI think that makes sense. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any breaks or other factors that might affect the total reading time.\n\nFor example, if I take breaks every certain number of pages, that would increase the total time. But since the problem doesn't mention any breaks, I'll assume that the reading is continuous without any interruptions.\n\nAlso, it's possible that my reading speed might change over time, but again, without that information, I'll assume a constant reading speed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it should take 6 hours to read the 300-page book.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
