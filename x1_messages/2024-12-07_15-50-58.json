        "content": "So, I've got this question here: If a human body has about 5 liters of blood and can lose up to 15% before it becomes life-threatening, how much blood in milliliters can a person lose safely? And I need to show my work.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a human body with approximately 5 liters of blood. It's safe to lose up to 15% of that without it being life-threatening. I need to find out how much that is in milliliters.\n\nOkay, so I know that 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters. So, 5 liters would be 5 times 1000, which is 5000 milliliters. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, I need to find 15% of 5000 milliliters. Percentage means per hundred, so 15% is the same as 15 per 100 or 15/100, which is 0.15 in decimal form.\n\nTo find 15% of 5000 milliliters, I can multiply 5000 by 0.15.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nSafe blood loss = Total blood volume \u00d7 Percentage that can be lost safely\n\nSo, Safe blood loss = 5000 ml \u00d7 0.15\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication:\n\n5000 \u00d7 0.15\n\nWell, 5000 \u00d7 0.1 is 500, and 5000 \u00d7 0.05 is 250. So, 500 plus 250 is 750.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 5000 \u00d7 15/100.\n\n5000 \u00d7 15 = 75,000\n\nThen, divide by 100: 75,000 \u00f7 100 = 750.\n\nSo, the safe amount of blood that can be lost is 750 milliliters.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with total blood volume: 5 liters = 5000 milliliters.\n\nPercentage that can be lost safely: 15%.\n\nSo, 15% of 5000 ml is indeed 750 ml.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in fractions. 15% is the same as 15/100, which simplifies to 3/20.\n\nSo, 3/20 of 5000 ml:\n\n(3/20) \u00d7 5000 = (3 \u00d7 5000) / 20 = 15,000 / 20 = 750 ml.\n\nSame answer.\n\nLet me consider another approach. If 10% of 5000 ml is 500 ml, then 15% would be 10% plus half of 10%, which is 500 ml plus 250 ml, totaling 750 ml. Again, the same result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 750 milliliters is the correct amount of blood that can be lost safely.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I should account for. The question seems straightforward: it's about calculating a percentage of a given total volume.\n\nI don't think there's any need to convert units further or consider anything else. The question asks for the answer in milliliters, and I've got 750 ml.\n\nLet me write down the final answer clearly.\n\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[ \\boxed{750} \\]\n\nSo, a person can lose up to 750 milliliters of blood safely before it becomes life-threatening, given that they have about 5 liters of blood in total and can lose up to 15% without critical harm."
