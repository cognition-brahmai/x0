        "content": "So the car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for 4 hours, and we need to find out how far it travels during that time. Okay, let's see.\n\nI remember that speed, time, and distance are related by a formula. The formula is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nIn this case, the speed is 60 miles per hour, and the time is 4 hours. So, plugging in the values:\n\nDistance = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 4 hours\n\nWhen I multiply these, the hours unit cancels out, leaving me with miles. So:\n\nDistance = 240 miles\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to think about it. If the car is going 60 miles every hour, then in 4 hours, it should cover 60 miles four times, which is 240 miles. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for average speed, which is total distance divided by total time. So, rearranging that formula to find distance:\n\nDistance = Average Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nAgain, that gives me 60 miles/hour \u00d7 4 hours = 240 miles.\n\nHmm, but maybe there's something I'm missing. What if the speed wasn't constant? The problem says \"average speed,\" so even if the speed varied during the trip, as long as the average was 60 miles per hour, the total distance should still be 240 miles.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose in the first hour, the car traveled 50 miles, in the second hour 60 miles, third hour 70 miles, and fourth hour 60 miles. The total distance would be 50 + 60 + 70 + 60 = 240 miles. The average speed would be total distance divided by total time, which is 240 miles / 4 hours = 60 miles per hour. That matches the given average speed.\n\nAlternatively, if the car traveled at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour for all four hours, the distance would still be 240 miles.\n\nSo, in both cases, the total distance is 240 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider? Like, is there anything about the units that I need to convert? The speed is given in miles per hour, and time is in hours, so no conversion is needed.\n\nAlso, the problem doesn't mention any stops or changes in direction, so I don't need to account for that.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the total distance traveled is 240 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
