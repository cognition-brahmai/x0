Let's see how this goes.\n\n**A**lphabetical verses, here I come,\n**B**ringing rhythms, under the sun.\n**C**reating melodies, one by one,\n**D**ancing notes, till the day is done.\n\n**E**very letter tells a tale,\n**F**rom A to Z, no one fails.\n**G**entle sounds, soft and frail,\n**H**armonizing, in every veil.\n\n**I**maginations run wild,\n**J**oining forces, side by side.\n**K**eyboard keys, lightly piled,\n**L**ending beats, to the night's stride.\n\n**M**usical dreams, taking flight,\n**N**otes ascending, into the light.\n**O**ctaves wide, pure and bright,\n**P**ainting pictures, through the night.\n\n**Q**uiet whispers, in the air,\n**R**hythms pulsing, everywhere.\n**S**ongs of love, beyond compare,\n**T**ouching hearts, beyond repair.\n\n**U**nder the moon, so serene,\n**V**oices blending, like a dream.\n**W**ords of hope, in between,\n**X**treme emotions, we redeem.\n\n**Y**ears may pass, but songs remain,\n**Z**ealously, in our hearts they reign.\n\nSo, there you have it! A song lyric with each verse starting from A to Z, in alphabetical order. I tried to make it flow smoothly and keep the theme consistent throughout. I hope you like it!"
