        "content": "So I have this problem here. There's a square field with each side being 10 meters long, and in the center of this field, there's a circular fountain with a radius of 5 meters. I need to find out the area of the field that's left after accounting for the fountain's area.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formulas for the area of a square and the area of a circle because that's what this problem is about: subtracting the area of the circle from the area of the square.\n\nThe area of a square is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{square}} = \\text{side}^2\n\\]\n\nGiven that the side is 10 meters:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{square}} = 10^2 = 100 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nNext, the area of a circle is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{circle}} = \\pi \\times \\text{radius}^2\n\\]\n\nThe radius of the fountain is 5 meters, so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{circle}} = \\pi \\times 5^2 = \\pi \\times 25 \\approx 78.54 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the remaining area of the field not occupied by the fountain, I subtract the area of the fountain from the total area of the field:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining area} = \\text{Area}_{\\text{square}} - \\text{Area}_{\\text{circle}} = 100 - 78.54 \\approx 21.46 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, I used an approximation for \\pi (\\pi \\approx 3.1416). Maybe I should keep it in terms of \\pi for a more exact answer.\n\nLet's do that again without approximating \\pi.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{circle}} = \\pi \\times 25 = 25\\pi \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining area} = 100 - 25\\pi \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nThat's exact. But if I need a numerical value, I can substitute \\pi with approximately 3.1416:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining area} \\approx 100 - 25 \\times 3.1416 = 100 - 78.54 = 21.46 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, if more precision is needed, I can use more decimal places for \\pi.\n\nBut for most practical purposes, 21.46 square meters is a good answer.\n\nLet me double-check if there's anything else I need to consider. Is there any overlap or something like that? Nope, the fountain is completely within the center of the square field, so simply subtracting the areas should give the correct remaining area.\n\nAlright, I think that's it. The remaining area of the field not occupied by the fountain is approximately 21.46 square meters, or more exactly, 100 - 25\\pi square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100 - 25\\pi} \\]"
