        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have 30 animals in a field, and they're either chickens or cows. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. Together, they have 78 legs. We need to find out how many chickens and how many cows there are.\n\nFirst, I think I should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chickens as \\( c \\) and the number of cows as \\( k \\). We know two things:\n\n1. The total number of animals is 30, so \\( c + k = 30 \\).\n\n2. The total number of legs is 78, and since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4, that gives us \\( 2c + 4k = 78 \\).\n\nSo, now I have a system of two equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nc + k &= 30 \\\\\n2c + 4k &= 78\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nI need to solve for \\( c \\) and \\( k \\). One way to do this is by using the substitution or elimination method. I think I'll use the substitution method here.\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( c = 30 - k \\). I can substitute this expression for \\( c \\) into the second equation.\n\nSo, plugging in \\( c \\):\n\n\\[\n2(30 - k) + 4k = 78\n\\]\n\nNow, let's simplify this:\n\n\\[\n60 - 2k + 4k = 78\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n60 + 2k = 78\n\\]\n\nSubtract 60 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2k = 18\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nk = 9\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 9 cows. Now, plug this back into the first equation to find \\( c \\):\n\n\\[\nc = 30 - 9 = 21\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 21 chickens and 9 cows.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If there are 21 chickens, that's \\( 21 \\times 2 = 42 \\) legs, and 9 cows, that's \\( 9 \\times 4 = 36 \\) legs. Adding those together: \\( 42 + 36 = 78 \\) legs, which matches the total given. So, it seems correct.\n\nAnother way to approach this is by assuming all animals are of one type and then adjusting based on the difference in legs. For example, if all 30 animals were chickens, they would have \\( 30 \\times 2 = 60 \\) legs. But we have 78 legs, which is 18 legs more than 60. Since each cow has 2 more legs than a chicken, we can find the number of cows by dividing the extra legs by 2: \\( 18 \\div 2 = 9 \\) cows. Then, the number of chickens would be \\( 30 - 9 = 21 \\), which matches what I found earlier.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign that it's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21 \\text{ chickens and } 9 \\text{ cows}} \\]"
