        "content": "So there's this store having a 20% off sale on all items, and I have a shirt that originally costs $25. I need to find out what the price will be after the discount. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 20% discount means. Percentages can be a bit tricky, but I think I've got it. So, 20% off means I'm saving 20% of the original price. That means I pay only 80% of the original price because 100% - 20% = 80%.\n\nWait, is there another way to look at it? Maybe I should calculate the discount amount first and then subtract it from the original price. That might be clearer.\n\nOkay, so the discount is 20% of $25. To find 20% of something, I can multiply the original price by 20% or 0.20 in decimal form.\n\nSo, discount amount = original price \u00d7 discount rate\n\nDiscount amount = $25 \u00d7 0.20\n\nLet me do the multiplication: 25 times 0.20. That's like 25 times 2 divided by 10, which is 50 divided by 10, which is 5. So, the discount amount is $5.\n\nNow, to find the final price after the discount, I subtract the discount amount from the original price.\n\nFinal price = original price - discount amount\n\nFinal price = $25 - $5 = $20\n\nAlright, that seems straightforward. But earlier, I thought about paying 80% of the original price. Let me check if that gives me the same answer.\n\nSo, if I pay 80% of $25, that's $25 \u00d7 0.80\n\n25 times 0.80 is 20. So, again, $20.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer. That's reassuring. It looks like whether I calculate the discount amount first and subtract it or calculate the percentage I have to pay directly, I end up with $20.\n\nMaybe I should try another way to confirm. What if I use fractions? 20% is the same as 20 per 100, which simplifies to 1/5.\n\nSo, the discount is 1/5 of $25.\n\n1/5 of 25 is 5, so again, $5 discount, leading to $20 final price.\n\nOkay, every method I try brings me to the same conclusion. The final price of the shirt after a 20% discount is $20.\n\nI think I've got it figured out now. Percentages can be a bit confusing at first, but breaking it down into steps makes it easier. It's good to verify the answer using different methods to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
