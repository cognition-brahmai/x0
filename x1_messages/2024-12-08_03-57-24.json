        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a group of people, and 60% of them have brown eyes while 40% have blue eyes. Additionally, there are 24 more people with brown eyes than with blue eyes. We need to find out how many people are in the group altogether.\n\nFirst, let's understand what these percentages mean. If we let the total number of people in the group be T, then:\n\n- The number of people with brown eyes is 60% of T, which is 0.60 * T.\n\n- The number of people with blue eyes is 40% of T, which is 0.40 * T.\n\nNow, according to the problem, there are 24 more people with brown eyes than with blue eyes. That means:\n\nNumber of brown-eyed people - Number of blue-eyed people = 24\n\nSubstituting the expressions we have:\n\n0.60 * T - 0.40 * T = 24\n\nLet's do the math:\n\n0.60T - 0.40T = 0.20T\n\nSo, 0.20T = 24\n\nTo find T, we can divide both sides by 0.20:\n\nT = 24 / 0.20\n\nT = 120\n\nTherefore, there are 120 people in the group.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure we didn't make any mistakes. If there are 120 people in total:\n\n- 60% of 120 is 72 people with brown eyes.\n\n- 40% of 120 is 48 people with blue eyes.\n\nNow, 72 - 48 = 24, which matches the information given in the problem. So, our answer seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about this problem in terms of ratios. Since 60% have brown eyes and 40% have blue eyes, the ratio of brown-eyed to blue-eyed people is 60:40, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nThis means for every 3 brown-eyed people, there are 2 blue-eyed people. The difference in their numbers should be 1 part (3 - 2 = 1), and according to the problem, this difference is 24 people.\n\nSo, if 1 part corresponds to 24 people, then the total number of parts is 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people T is 5 parts times 24 people per part, which is 5 * 24 = 120.\n\nAgain, we arrive at the same answer, 120 people in the group.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use algebra. Let\u2019s denote:\n\n- B = number of brown-eyed people\n\n- BL = number of blue-eyed people\n\nFrom the problem, we have:\n\nB = 0.60 * T\n\nBL = 0.40 * T\n\nAnd:\n\nB = BL + 24\n\nSubstituting the first two equations into the third:\n\n0.60T = 0.40T + 24\n\nSubtract 0.40T from both sides:\n\n0.20T = 24\n\nDivide both sides by 0.20:\n\nT = 120\n\nOnce again, we get T = 120.\n\nI think it's clear that the total number of people in the group is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
