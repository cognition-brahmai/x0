        "content": "Netflix was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph. The company initially started as a DVD rental service, allowing users to rent movies through the mail. The idea came about when Reed Hastings was charged fees for late rental of the movie \"Apollo 13\" from a video store. This experience led him to think about a subscription-based model without late fees, which eventually became the foundation of Netflix. Over time, Netflix evolved into a streaming service and now produces its own original content."
