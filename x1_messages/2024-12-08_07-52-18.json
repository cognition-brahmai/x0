Yeah, according to most sources, the Nile is the longest river, followed by the Amazon in South America, which is about 6,400 kilometers long. So, the Nile is longer. But I've heard that some people claim the Amazon is longer because of the way you measure it. Maybe it's close. But generally, the Nile is considered the longest. So, approximately 6,650 kilometers is the length of the Nile River."
