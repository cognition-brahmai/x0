        "content": "So the store has a discount policy where for every 10 items you buy, you get a 2% discount on the total price. The customer is buying 50 items, and I need to find out what their total discount percentage would be.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many sets of 10 items are in 50 items. Since 50 divided by 10 is 5, that means there are 5 sets of 10 items.\n\nNow, for each set of 10 items, the customer gets a 2% discount. So, if there are 5 sets, I might think that the total discount is 5 times 2%, which would be 10%. But I'm not sure if it's that straightforward because percentages can be a bit tricky when they stack like this.\n\nLet me think about how discounts work. If each set of 10 items gives a 2% discount on the total price, and the discounts are cumulative, then maybe the total discount isn't just a simple multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider it as a single discount rate based on the number of sets. So, if 10 items get 2%, then 20 items would get 4%, 30 items get 6%, and so on. So, for 50 items, which is 5 sets of 10, it would be 5 times 2%, which is 10%.\n\nBut maybe there's a different way to look at it. Maybe the discount applies to the price per item, but I think it's applied to the total price.\n\nLet me consider an example to make sure. Suppose each item costs $1. So, 50 items would cost $50.\n\nNow, for every 10 items, there's a 2% discount on the total price. Since there are 5 sets of 10 items, the total discount should be 10% on the total price.\n\nSo, 10% of $50 is $5. Therefore, the customer would pay $45.\n\nBut wait, is there a possibility that the discounts are applied sequentially, meaning that each subsequent discount is applied to the already discounted price?\n\nLet me explore that idea. If the first 10 items give a 2% discount on the total, the next 10 items give another 2% discount on the already discounted price, and so on.\n\nBut that seems complicated, and the problem seems straightforward. Maybe it's just a flat 2% discount for every 10 items bought, up to the total number of sets purchased.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store means that for every 10 items, you get an additional 2% off the remaining amount, but that sounds like it could lead to a higher total discount.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if there's a formula or a standard way to calculate such discounts.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If 10 items give a 2% discount, then 20 items give 4%, 30 items give 6%, and so on, up to 50 items giving 10%.\n\nThat seems consistent. So, for 50 items, the total discount percentage would be 10%.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider the total cost with the discount.\n\nIf each item costs $1, total price without discount is $50.\n\nWith a 10% discount, the discount amount is $5, so the customer pays $45.\n\nAlternatively, if the discounts are applied sequentially, let's see what happens.\n\nStart with $50.\n\nFirst 10 items: 2% discount on $50, which is $1, so new price is $49.\n\nSecond 10 items: another 2% discount on $49, which is $0.98, so new price is $48.02.\n\nThird 10 items: another 2% discount on $48.02, which is $0.96, so new price is $47.06.\n\nFourth 10 items: another 2% discount on $47.06, which is $0.94, so new price is $46.12.\n\nFifth 10 items: another 2% discount on $46.12, which is $0.92, so new price is $45.20.\n\nSo, with sequential discounts, the final price is $45.20, which is a total discount of $4.80 from the original $50.\n\nThat would be a total discount percentage of (4.8 / 50) * 100% = 9.6%.\n\nWait, that's less than the initial 10% I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, there's a difference between applying the discounts sequentially versus applying a flat total discount.\n\nIn the first approach, I applied a flat 10% discount on the total price, resulting in a $5 discount.\n\nIn the sequential approach, the discounts are applied repeatedly, resulting in a slightly lower discount amount of $4.80, or 9.6%.\n\nI think the intended meaning is the flat discount per set of 10 items, leading to a total discount of 10% for 50 items.\n\nBut to be precise, I should clarify the store's policy.\n\nIf the store says \"for every 10 items bought, you get a 2% discount on the total price,\" it likely means that for each set of 10 items, you get an additional 2% off the total price.\n\nIn that case, it's similar to the sequential approach, where each 2% discount is applied to the remaining amount after previous discounts.\n\nSo, in this scenario, for 50 items, the total discount would be less than 10%, specifically 9.6%.\n\nHowever, in practical terms, especially in retail, it might be simpler to apply a flat total discount based on the number of sets purchased.\n\nGiven that, I think the total discount percentage for 50 items would be 10%.\n\nBut to be accurate, considering the sequential application, it's 9.6%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the discounts are stacked on the original price, meaning that for 50 items, you get 5 instances of 2% discount on the original total price.\n\nIn that case, the total discount would be 5 * 2% = 10% of the original price.\n\nBut that seems similar to the flat discount approach.\n\nWait, in the sequential approach, each discount is applied to the already discounted price, which compounds the discount.\n\nWhereas in the flat approach, the discounts are simply added up.\n\nSo, in reality, the sequential approach results in a higher total discount because each subsequent discount is applied to a lower amount.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the sequential approach, each discount is applied to the remaining amount after previous discounts, so the discount amounts decrease with each application.\n\nThat's why the total discount is less than the sum of individual discounts.\n\nIn the flat approach, the discounts are added up directly.\n\nSo, in this case, the flat approach gives a higher total discount.\n\nBut I think the store likely means the flat approach, where for each set of 10 items, you get an additional 2% off the total price, up to the number of sets purchased.\n\nTherefore, for 50 items, the total discount would be 10%.\n\nSo, the customer would get a 10% discount on their total purchase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10\\%} \\]"
