        "content": "So there are 8 red balls and 12 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 20 balls. I need to find the probability of picking two red balls in a row, with replacement. Since I'm putting the ball back each time, the total number of balls remains the same for each pick.\n\nFirst, I should find the probability of picking a red ball on the first try. There are 8 red balls out of 20 total balls, so the probability is 8/20, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nNow, because I'm replacing the ball, the probability of picking a red ball on the second try is the same, 2/5.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening consecutively, I need to multiply the probabilities of each event. So, it should be (2/5) * (2/5) = 4/25.\n\nWait, but probabilities are often expressed as decimals or percentages. 4/25 is 0.16, which is 16%. So, the probability is 16%.\n\nLet me double-check. Total balls: 8 red + 12 blue = 20 balls.\n\nProbability of first red ball: 8/20 = 2/5.\n\nSince replacement occurs, probability of second red ball: again 8/20 = 2/5.\n\nMultiplying them: (2/5) * (2/5) = 4/25.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{25}} \\]"
