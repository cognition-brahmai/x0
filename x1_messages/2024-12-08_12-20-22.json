        "content": "So I have this car rental problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The car rental company charges a flat fee of $20 per day plus an additional 15 cents per mile driven. I need to find out the total cost if I rent the car for 3 days and drive it for 150 miles.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to break this down into parts. There's a daily flat fee and a per-mile charge. So, the total cost should be the sum of the daily fees plus the cost for the miles driven.\n\nLet me start by calculating the daily fees. The flat fee is $20 per day, and I'm renting the car for 3 days. So, I'll multiply 20 by 3.\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\nSo, the daily fees amount to $60.\n\nNext, the per-mile charge is 15 cents per mile, and I drove 150 miles. First, I need to convert 15 cents to dollars because the daily fee is in dollars. 15 cents is $0.15.\n\nSo, the cost for miles driven is 0.15 multiplied by 150.\n\n0.15 \u00d7 150 = 22.5\n\nSo, the cost for miles driven is $22.50.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I'll add the daily fees and the miles driven cost.\n\n60 + 22.5 = 82.5\n\nTherefore, the total cost is $82.50.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I'll use a different approach to confirm.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total cost using the formula:\n\nTotal cost = (flat fee per day \u00d7 number of days) + (cost per mile \u00d7 number of miles)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTotal cost = (20 \u00d7 3) + (0.15 \u00d7 150)\n\nThat's the same as before.\n\nTotal cost = 60 + 22.5 = 82.5\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total cost per mile and per day separately.\n\nLet me see, for 3 days, the flat fee is $20 per day, so $60 in total.\n\nFor 150 miles, at $0.15 per mile, that's $22.50.\n\nAdding them up gives $82.50.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other charge that might be applicable. The problem mentions only a flat fee per day and a per-mile charge. There's no mention of any additional fees like tax, insurance, etc. So, I'll assume that the total cost is just the sum of these two components.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let's recalculate:\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60 (daily fees)\n\n0.15 \u00d7 150 = 22.5 (miles driven cost)\n\n60 + 22.5 = 82.5 (total cost)\n\nNo mistakes there.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the per-mile charge as a separate component from the daily fee. The daily fee is fixed regardless of how many miles you drive, and the per-mile charge depends on how many miles you actually drive.\n\nIn this case, since I drove 150 miles, the per-mile charge is applicable only for those 150 miles.\n\nSo, yes, $82.50 seems to be the correct total cost.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{82.50} \\]"
