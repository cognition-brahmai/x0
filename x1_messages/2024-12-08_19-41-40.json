        "content": "The disease you're referring to is scurvy. It's caused by a prolonged deficiency of vitamin C, which is essential for the synthesis of collagen, a protein that plays a crucial role in the body's connective tissues. Scurvy was indeed a significant health issue for sailors during long sea voyages before the importance of vitamin C in the diet was fully understood.\n\nSymptoms of scurvy include fatigue, weakness, swollen and bleeding gums, joint pain, poor wound healing, and in severe cases, even tooth loss and death. The condition was particularly prevalent among sailors because their diets on long voyages often lacked fresh fruits and vegetables, which are rich sources of vitamin C.\n\nThe British navy, in particular, suffered greatly from scurvy in the 18th century. It wasn't until the late 1700s that Scottish surgeon James Lind conducted experiments that suggested citrus fruits could prevent scurvy. Later, in the 19th century, the British navy began issuing lime juice to sailors, which led to a significant reduction in scurvy cases. This practice is thought to be the origin of the term \"limey,\" which was used to refer to British sailors.\n\nToday, scurvy is rare in developed countries due to improved diets and the availability of a wide range of foods, including those rich in vitamin C. However, it can still occur in individuals with poor diets, alcoholics, and in some cases of severe food restrictions or malabsorption disorders.\n\nPrevention is straightforward: ensuring an adequate intake of vitamin C through diet or supplements. Foods high in vitamin C include citrus fruits, strawberries, bell peppers, tomatoes, broccoli, and leafy green vegetables, among others.\n\nIn summary, scurvy is a disease resulting from vitamin C deficiency, historically affecting sailors on long voyages due to lack of fresh produce in their diets. Its prevalence declined significantly with the introduction of dietary changes and the understanding of nutritional requirements."
