        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We start with 50 birds sitting on a tree branch. A hunter shoots and kills 20% of them. Then, of the remaining birds, 30% fly away because of the noise. We need to find out how many birds are left on the branch.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many birds the hunter kills. Since the hunter kills 20% of the 50 birds, I can calculate that by finding 20% of 50.\n\nTo find 20% of 50, I can multiply 50 by 0.20:\n\n50 \u00d7 0.20 = 10\n\nSo, the hunter kills 10 birds.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many birds are left after the hunter shoots. If there were 50 birds and 10 were killed, then:\n\n50 - 10 = 40 birds remaining.\n\nNext, 30% of the remaining birds fly away due to the noise. So, I need to find 30% of 40.\n\nTo find 30% of 40, I can multiply 40 by 0.30:\n\n40 \u00d7 0.30 = 12\n\nSo, 12 birds fly away.\n\nNow, to find out how many birds are left on the branch, I subtract the number of birds that flew away from the remaining birds after the hunter shot:\n\n40 - 12 = 28 birds.\n\nTherefore, there are 28 birds left on the tree branch.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 50 birds:\n\n1. Hunter kills 20%: 50 \u00d7 0.20 = 10 birds killed.\n\n2. Birds remaining: 50 - 10 = 40 birds.\n\n3. 30% of remaining birds fly away: 40 \u00d7 0.30 = 12 birds fly away.\n\n4. Birds left: 40 - 12 = 28 birds.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of percentages.\n\nInitially, there are 50 birds.\n\nAfter the hunter shoots 20%, that means 80% are left:\n\n50 \u00d7 0.80 = 40 birds.\n\nThen, 30% of these 40 birds fly away, so 70% remain:\n\n40 \u00d7 0.70 = 28 birds.\n\nAgain, 28 birds are left on the branch.\n\nI think this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]"
