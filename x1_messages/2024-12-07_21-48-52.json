        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 20,000 liters of soda per day, and each bottle holds 500 milliliters. I need to find out how many bottles can be filled in a week, which is 7 days.\n\nFirst, I should probably convert the daily production from liters to milliliters because the bottle size is given in milliliters. I know that 1 liter is equal to 1,000 milliliters. So, 20,000 liters would be:\n\n20,000 liters * 1,000 milliliters/liter = 20,000,000 milliliters per day.\n\nNow, each bottle holds 500 milliliters. To find out how many bottles can be filled per day, I can divide the total milliliters produced per day by the volume of each bottle:\n\n20,000,000 milliliters / 500 milliliters/bottle = 40,000 bottles per day.\n\nSince we want to know the number of bottles filled in a week, and there are 7 days in a week, I can multiply the daily bottle count by 7:\n\n40,000 bottles/day * 7 days/week = 280,000 bottles per week.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 20,000 liters per day, converting to milliliters:\n\n20,000 * 1,000 = 20,000,000 milliliters per day.\n\nEach bottle is 500 milliliters, so number of bottles per day:\n\n20,000,000 / 500 = 40,000 bottles per day.\n\nOver 7 days:\n\n40,000 * 7 = 280,000 bottles per week.\n\nThat seems correct. Alternatively, I can think about it in terms of liters. Since 1 liter is 1,000 milliliters, and each bottle is 500 milliliters, that means each bottle is 0.5 liters.\n\nSo, number of bottles per day:\n\n20,000 liters / 0.5 liters/bottle = 40,000 bottles per day.\n\nThen, 40,000 bottles/day * 7 days = 280,000 bottles per week.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find out how many bottles can be filled in a week directly. First, find the total production in a week:\n\n20,000 liters/day * 7 days = 140,000 liters per week.\n\nConvert that to milliliters:\n\n140,000 liters * 1,000 milliliters/liter = 140,000,000 milliliters per week.\n\nThen, divide by the bottle size:\n\n140,000,000 milliliters / 500 milliliters/bottle = 280,000 bottles per week.\n\nAgain, the same result. So, I'm confident that 280,000 bottles per week is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{280000} \\]"
