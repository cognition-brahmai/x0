        "content": "The French phrase you're referring to is \"Fin de si\u00e8cle,\" which indeed describes the cultural and intellectual climate of the late 19th century, particularly the 1890s. This period was marked by a sense of decadence, pessimism, and cultural reevaluation in Europe, especially in France and England. Fin de si\u00e8cle art, literature, and thought often explored themes of decay, morbidity, and the occult, reflecting a broader mood of uncertainty and change as the old century gave way to the new. Notable figures associated with this movement include Oscar Wilde, Aubrey Beardsley, and Friedrich Nietzsche."
