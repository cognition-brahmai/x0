        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 houses in the village, each with at least one child, and each house has a different number of children. The total number of children is 55. I need to find out how many children live in the house with the most kids.\n\nFirst, since each house has a different number of children and at least one child, the smallest possible numbers of children in the houses would be the first 10 positive integers: 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 10.\n\nLet me calculate the sum of the first 10 positive integers to see if that adds up to 55.\n\nThe formula for the sum of the first n positive integers is \\( S = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\).\n\nSo, for n = 10:\n\n\\( S = \\frac{10 \\times 11}{2} = 55 \\).\n\nWait, that's exactly 55. So if each house has a different number of children starting from 1 up to 10, the total number of children would be 55.\n\nTherefore, the house with the most kids would have 10 children.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another possibility. The problem says each house has a different number of children, and the total is 55.\n\nIf I try to have a different distribution where the numbers are not consecutive starting from 1, but still different and sum up to 55, would that be possible?\n\nFor example, if I have 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. The sum would be:\n\n2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n2+3=5, 5+4=9, 9+5=14, 14+6=20, 20+7=27, 27+8=35, 35+9=44, 44+10=54, 54+11=65.\n\nThat's 65, which is more than 55.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to have smaller numbers, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 12.\n\nSum would be 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+12.\n\nCalculating: 1+2=3, 3+3=6, 6+4=10, 10+5=15, 15+6=21, 21+7=28, 28+8=36, 36+9=45, 45+12=57.\n\nThat's 57, still more than 55.\n\nAlternatively, if I try 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11.\n\nSum: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+10+11.\n\nCalculating: 1+2=3, 3+3=6, 6+4=10, 10+5=15, 15+6=21, 21+7=28, 28+8=36, 36+10=46, 46+11=57.\n\nAgain, 57, which is more than 55.\n\nIt seems that any deviation from the sequence 1 through 10 results in a sum that is either equal to or greater than 55.\n\nBut wait, what if I have some numbers less than 10 but adjust others accordingly?\n\nLet me try 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, which sums to 55, as previously calculated.\n\nIf I try to increase one number, I have to decrease another to keep the sum at 55, but since all numbers must be different and at least 1, there might be constraints.\n\nFor example, if I try to have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11, the sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+11 = 56, which is more than 55.\n\nTo make the sum 55, I would need to decrease one of the other numbers, but if I decrease one number, say from 9 to 8, but 8 is already in the list, so it violates the \"different number\" condition.\n\nAlternatively, if I try 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11, sum is 57, which is too high.\n\nWait, maybe I can have some numbers skipped, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11.\n\nSum: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+9+10+11.\n\nCalculating: 1+2=3, 3+3=6, 6+4=10, 10+5=15, 15+6=21, 21+7=28, 28+9=37, 37+10=47, 47+11=58.\n\nStill higher than 55.\n\nAlternatively, what if I try to have a smaller highest number?\n\nSuppose the highest is 9. Then the maximum sum would be 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+x, where x is less than 9 and different from others.\n\nBut x has to be at least 1 and different from others.\n\nIf x is 0, but it's not at least one, so not allowed.\n\nIf x is 10, but that's higher than 9, which contradicts the assumption that 9 is the highest.\n\nWait, this seems tricky.\n\nLet me consider that the sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55, which fits the total number of children.\n\nIf I try to have the highest number less than 10, say 9, then the sum of 1 through 9 is 45.\n\nThen I need another number that is different and at least 1, but not exceeding 9, which is already included.\n\nWait, if I have numbers from 1 to 9, sum is 45, and need a total of 55, so the additional number would be 55 - 45 = 10.\n\nBut 10 is greater than 9, which contradicts the assumption that 9 is the highest.\n\nSimilarly, if I try to have the highest number as 11, the sum would be more than 55, as seen earlier.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the only possible distribution where each house has a different number of children, each having at least one, and the total is 55, is when the numbers of children per house are exactly 1 through 10.\n\nHence, the house with the most kids has 10 children.\n\nBut let me think differently. Maybe there's a way to have more than 10 children in the house with the most kids by adjusting other houses to have fewer children, but still maintaining uniqueness and at least one child per house.\n\nWait, but if I have houses with 1 through 9 children, and one house with more than 10, the sum would exceed 55, as shown earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I have houses with 0 children, but that's not allowed since each house has at least one child.\n\nWait, the problem says each house has at least one child living in it.\n\nSo, no house can have 0 children.\n\nTherefore, the minimal distribution is 1 through 10, summing to 55.\n\nAny attempt to have a higher number would require adjusting other numbers downward, but that would either duplicate numbers or go below 1, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, the house with the most kids must have exactly 10 children.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
