        "content": "To estimate the potential increase in revenue from selling recyclable materials once the city achieves its target recycling rate of 60%, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the current amount of solid waste being recycled.\n2. Determine the total solid waste generated by the city.\n3. Calculate the increased amount of solid waste that will be recycled when the rate increases to 60%.\n4. Estimate the additional revenue generated from the increased recycling.\n\nLet's start with the information provided:\n\n- Current recycling rate: 40%\n- Current revenue from recycling: $2 million\n\nFirst, we need to find out the total solid waste generated by the city. Let's denote the total solid waste as \\( W \\).\n\nSince the city recycles 40% of its solid waste, the amount of waste recycled currently is \\( 0.40W \\).\n\nThe revenue generated from recycling this amount is $2 million. Therefore, the revenue per unit of recycled waste can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Revenue per unit} = \\frac{\\$2,000,000}{0.40W} = \\frac{\\$2,000,000}{0.40} \\times \\frac{1}{W} = \\$5,000,000 \\times \\frac{1}{W} \\]\n\nNow, the city aims to increase the recycling rate to 60%. The amount of waste recycled at this rate would be \\( 0.60W \\).\n\nThe revenue generated from recycling at 60% would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Revenue at 60%} = 0.60W \\times \\left( \\$5,000,000 \\times \\frac{1}{W} \\right) = 0.60 \\times \\$5,000,000 = \\$3,000,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the potential increase in revenue from selling recyclable materials once the target recycling rate is achieved would be:\n\n\\[ \\$3,000,000 - \\$2,000,000 = \\$1,000,000 \\]\n\nSo, the potential increase in revenue is $1 million.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1,000,000} \\]"
