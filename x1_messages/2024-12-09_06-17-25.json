        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. The original dimensions are 20 meters in length and 10 meters in width. The gardener wants to increase the area by 50% without changing the shape of the garden. I need to find out what the new dimensions should be.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the original area of the garden. Since it's a rectangle, the area is length times width, right? So, that would be 20 meters times 10 meters, which is 200 square meters.\n\nNow, the gardener wants to increase this area by 50%. So, I need to calculate what 50% of 200 square meters is. Half of 200 is 100, so increasing by 50% means adding 100 square meters to the original 200 square meters, making the new area 300 square meters.\n\nBut here's the catch: the shape of the garden shouldn't change. That means the new garden should still be a rectangle with the same shape as the original one. I think that implies keeping the same ratio of length to width.\n\nThe original ratio of length to width is 20:10, which simplifies to 2:1. So, whatever the new dimensions are, their ratio should still be 2:1.\n\nLet me denote the new length as L and the new width as W. According to the ratio, L/W = 2/1, which means L = 2W.\n\nNow, since the area of the new garden is supposed to be 300 square meters, and area is length times width, I can set up the equation:\n\nL * W = 300\n\nBut since L = 2W, I can substitute that into the equation:\n\n2W * W = 300\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n2W\u00b2 = 300\n\nNow, I can solve for W:\n\nW\u00b2 = 150\n\nW = sqrt(150)\n\nHmm, sqrt(150)... Let me calculate that. 150 is 25 times 6, so sqrt(150) = sqrt(25*6) = 5*sqrt(6). But maybe it's better to get a decimal value. Sqrt(150) is approximately 12.247 meters.\n\nSo, the new width W is approximately 12.247 meters.\n\nNow, since L = 2W, the new length L would be approximately 2 * 12.247 = 24.494 meters.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me check the area with these new dimensions: 24.494 meters times 12.247 meters should be around 300 square meters.\n\nLet me do the multiplication: 24.494 * 12.247. That's approximately 24 * 12.25 = 294, plus a bit more from the decimals. Yeah, it should be around 300 square meters.\n\nSo, the new dimensions should be approximately 24.494 meters in length and 12.247 meters in width.\n\nBut maybe there's a more precise way to do this without dealing with square roots. Let's think differently.\n\nSince the shape doesn't change, and area is increasing by 50%, that means the area is being multiplied by 1.5.\n\nIn rectangles with the same shape, if you scale both dimensions by the same factor, the area is scaled by the square of that factor.\n\nLet me denote the scaling factor as S. Then, the new length is S times the original length, and the new width is S times the original width.\n\nThe new area would be (S*L) * (S*W) = S\u00b2 * (L*W) = S\u00b2 * original area.\n\nWe want the new area to be 1.5 times the original area, so:\n\nS\u00b2 * 200 = 300\n\nS\u00b2 = 300 / 200 = 1.5\n\nTherefore, S = sqrt(1.5)\n\nS = sqrt(1.5) = sqrt(3/2) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(2) \u2248 1.2247\n\nSo, the scaling factor is approximately 1.2247.\n\nNow, to find the new dimensions, I just need to multiply the original dimensions by this scaling factor.\n\nNew length = 20 * 1.2247 \u2248 24.494 meters\n\nNew width = 10 * 1.2247 \u2248 12.247 meters\n\nThat matches what I got earlier. So, it seems consistent.\n\nBut maybe I can express it in exact form without decimals.\n\nSince S = sqrt(1.5) = sqrt(3/2) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(2), I can rationalize the denominator:\n\nS = sqrt(3)*sqrt(2)/2 = sqrt(6)/2\n\nTherefore, the new length is 20 * (sqrt(6)/2) = 10*sqrt(6) meters\n\nAnd the new width is 10 * (sqrt(6)/2) = 5*sqrt(6) meters\n\nSo, the exact new dimensions are 10*sqrt(6) meters in length and 5*sqrt(6) meters in width.\n\nIf I want to approximate these values:\n\nsqrt(6) is approximately 2.44949, so:\n\nLength \u2248 10 * 2.44949 = 24.4949 meters\n\nWidth \u2248 5 * 2.44949 = 12.24745 meters\n\nWhich matches what I had before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to think about scaling the dimensions to achieve the desired area increase while maintaining the shape.\n\nLet me consider that the perimeter might be relevant, but I don't think so, because changing the dimensions while keeping the shape would scale both length and width by the same factor, as I did earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think in terms of similar figures. In similar rectangles, the ratio of corresponding sides is constant, which is what I already used.\n\nI think the approach I took is correct.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nOriginal area: 20 * 10 = 200 sq.m.\n\nDesired area: 200 * 1.5 = 300 sq.m.\n\nScaling factor S, where S\u00b2 = 1.5, so S = sqrt(1.5) \u2248 1.2247\n\nNew length: 20 * 1.2247 \u2248 24.494 m\n\nNew width: 10 * 1.2247 \u2248 12.247 m\n\nArea with new dimensions: 24.494 * 12.247 \u2248 300 sq.m.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to express it in terms of square roots:\n\nNew length: 20 * sqrt(1.5) = 20 * sqrt(3/2) = 20 * sqrt(6)/2 = 10*sqrt(6) m\n\nNew width: 10 * sqrt(1.5) = 10 * sqrt(6)/2 = 5*sqrt(6) m\n\nSo, the exact dimensions are 10*sqrt(6) meters by 5*sqrt(6) meters.\n\nIf I rationalize or simplify further, I can leave it like that, as it's an exact value.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects decimal approximations, I can provide those as well.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify, I can offer both the exact and approximate values.\n\nSo, the new dimensions should be 10*sqrt(6) meters in length and 5*sqrt(6) meters in width, which is approximately 24.494 meters by 12.247 meters.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe new dimensions of the garden should be \\boxed{10\\sqrt{6} \\text{ meters in length and } 5\\sqrt{6} \\text{ meters in width}} (approximately 24.494 meters in length and 12.247 meters in width)."
