        "content": "So I've got this problem here. It says that in a certain city, it rains on average 120 days per year. Out of these rainy days, 60% experience thunderstorms. I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen day from this city will be a rainy day with a thunderstorm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I think it's about finding the chance that any given day in this city is both rainy and has a thunderstorm. Since it's an average over the year, I can assume that the probability is the same every day.\n\nI know that there are 365 days in a year, unless it's a leap year, but the problem doesn't specify, so I'll stick with 365.\n\nSo, it rains on 120 days out of 365. That means the probability of any day being rainy is 120 divided by 365. But wait, the question is about rainy days with thunderstorms.\n\nOut of these 120 rainy days, 60% have thunderstorms. So, first, I need to find out how many days have both rain and thunderstorms.\n\n60% of 120 days is calculated as 0.60 times 120, which is 72 days.\n\nSo, there are 72 days that have both rain and thunderstorms.\n\nNow, to find the probability that a randomly chosen day is one of these 72 days, I need to divide 72 by the total number of days in a year, which is 365.\n\nSo, the probability is 72 divided by 365.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n72 divided by 365 is approximately 0.1973.\n\nTo express this as a percentage, I can multiply by 100, which gives about 19.73%.\n\nBut I think the answer is expected in decimal form, so 0.1973.\n\nAlternatively, I can simplify the fraction 72/365.\n\nLet's see, both 72 and 365 are divisible by 72 and 365 share a common factor of 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nWait, 72 and 365, let's check if they can be simplified.\n\n72 divided by 72 is 1, and 365 divided by 72 is approximately 5.069, which isn't an integer, so the fraction 72/365 is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 72/365, which is approximately 0.1973.\n\nBut maybe I should leave it as a fraction rather than a decimal, depending on what's requested.\n\nThe question doesn't specify, so either should be acceptable.\n\nBut probably, presenting it as a decimal is more straightforward.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.1973, or 19.73%.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this?\n\nLet me think.\n\nI could consider the probability of a day being rainy and having a thunderstorm as the product of the probability of it being rainy and the probability of having a thunderstorm given that it's rainy.\n\nIn probability terms, this is P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A).\n\nHere, A is rainy day, and B is thunderstorm.\n\nWe are given P(A) = 120/365, and P(B|A) = 60% or 0.60.\n\nSo, P(rainy and thunderstorm) = (120/365) * 0.60.\n\nCalculating that: first, 120 divided by 365 is approximately 0.3288.\n\nThen, 0.3288 times 0.60 is approximately 0.1973.\n\nSo, again, I get approximately 0.1973.\n\nThis matches what I got earlier, so that's a good sign.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that out of the 365 days, 120 are rainy, and 60% of those have thunderstorms, leading to 72 days with both rain and thunderstorms, and then the probability is 72/365, which is again approximately 0.1973.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I end up with the same probability.\n\nI think this makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any other factor I should consider.\n\nIs there any dependency or independence issue here?\n\nWell, the problem states that out of the rainy days, 60% have thunderstorms.\n\nThis implies that the thunderstorms are conditional on the days being rainy.\n\nSo, it's a conditional probability, which is correctly captured by P(B|A).\n\nTherefore, my approach seems correct.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"a randomly chosen day,\" which means that each day has an equal chance of being selected, and the probability is just the number of favorable days divided by the total number of days.\n\nIn this case, the favorable days are the 72 days with both rain and thunderstorms.\n\nHence, the probability is 72/365.\n\nI could also consider leap years, but since the problem specifies \"on average 120 days per year,\" I can assume that it's already accounting for leap years over the long run.\n\nTherefore, sticking with 365 days per year is acceptable.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability that a randomly chosen day from this city will be a rainy day with a thunderstorm is approximately 0.1973, or 19.73%.\n\nBut perhaps I should present it in its exact fractional form, which is 72/365.\n\nAlternatively, I can simplify it by dividing both numerator and denominator by the greatest common divisor.\n\nLet's find the greatest common divisor of 72 and 365.\n\nThe factors of 72 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72.\n\nThe factors of 365 are 1, 5, 73, 365.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor is 1, meaning 72/365 is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the exact probability is 72/365.\n\nIf I want to express it as a decimal, it's approximately 0.19726, which rounds to 0.1973.\n\nOr as a percentage, about 19.73%.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify, I'll go with the decimal form.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 0.1973.\n\nI think that's clear.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.1973} \\]"
