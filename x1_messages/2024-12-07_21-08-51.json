        "content": "Let's see here. So, the train goes from City A to City B at 60 miles per hour and it takes 3 hours. First, I need to find out the distance between the two cities. I know that distance equals speed multiplied by time, so distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles.\n\nNow, on the way back, the train increases its speed by 20%. So, the new speed is 60 miles/hour + (20% of 60 miles/hour). 20% of 60 is 0.2 * 60 = 12 miles/hour. Therefore, the new speed is 60 + 12 = 72 miles/hour.\n\nI need to find out how long it takes to travel back to City A at this new speed. I know that time equals distance divided by speed, so time = 180 miles / 72 miles/hour.\n\nLet me calculate that: 180 divided by 72. Well, 72 times 2 is 144, and 180 minus 144 is 36. So, 72 goes into 36 how many times? 72 times 0.5 is 36. So, total time is 2.5 hours.\n\nWait, but I should check if that's correct. Another way to look at it is to see that the speed increased by 20%, so the time should decrease by a certain percentage. Let's see, if speed and time are inversely proportional, then time is inversely proportional to speed.\n\nSo, if the speed increases by 20%, the new speed is 120% of the original speed. Therefore, the time should be 100% / 120% of the original time.\n\nOriginal time was 3 hours. So, new time = 3 hours / 1.2 = 2.5 hours.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, it takes 2.5 hours for the train to travel back to City A.\n\nBut maybe I can think of it another way to confirm. If the train is going faster, it should take less time, which makes sense since 2.5 hours is less than 3 hours.\n\nAlso, 20% increase in speed should lead to a decrease in time by about 16.67%, since 100% / 120% = 5/6, which is approximately 83.33%, meaning a 16.67% decrease in time.\n\nOriginal time was 3 hours, so 16.67% of 3 hours is 0.5 hours, which when subtracted from 3 hours gives 2.5 hours. Yep, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula time = distance / speed, which I did earlier, and that also gives 180 miles / 72 miles per hour = 2.5 hours.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
