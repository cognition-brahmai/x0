        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two trains leaving the same station but at different times and heading in opposite directions. The first train leaves at 6 PM going east at 60 miles per hour, and the second train leaves an hour later, at 7 PM, going west at 80 miles per hour. We need to find out when they will be 210 miles apart.\n\nFirst, I need to understand their positions relative to the station at any given time. Since they're traveling in opposite directions, the distance between them will be the sum of the distances each has traveled from the station.\n\nLet's define a variable for time. Let\u2019s let t be the time in hours after the first train leaves. So, at time t, the first train has been traveling for t hours, and the second train has been traveling for t - 1 hours, since it leaves an hour later.\n\nNow, the distance traveled by the first train is speed times time, which is 60 miles per hour times t hours, so 60t miles.\n\nSimilarly, the distance traveled by the second train is 80 miles per hour times (t - 1) hours, which is 80(t - 1) miles.\n\nSince they're traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of these two distances:\n\nTotal distance = 60t + 80(t - 1)\n\nWe want this total distance to be 210 miles, so we can set up the equation:\n\n60t + 80(t - 1) = 210\n\nNow, let's solve for t.\n\nFirst, expand the equation:\n\n60t + 80t - 80 = 210\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n140t - 80 = 210\n\nAdd 80 to both sides:\n\n140t = 290\n\nNow, divide both sides by 140:\n\nt = 290 / 140\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nt = 2.0714 hours\n\nHmm, that's not a whole number. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the time differently. Let\u2019s try letting t be the time after the second train leaves. Then, the first train has been traveling for t + 1 hours, and the second train for t hours.\n\nSo, distance of first train: 60(t + 1)\n\nDistance of second train: 80t\n\nTotal distance: 60(t + 1) + 80t = 210\n\nLet\u2019s solve this equation.\n\n60t + 60 + 80t = 210\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n140t + 60 = 210\n\nSubtract 60 from both sides:\n\n140t = 150\n\nDivide by 140:\n\nt = 150 / 140 = 1.0714 hours\n\nSo, approximately 1 hour and 4.286 minutes.\n\nBut I need to find the time when they are 210 miles apart. If t is the time after the second train leaves, then the total time from when the first train leaves is t + 1 hours.\n\nSo, t + 1 = 2.0714 hours, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut maybe I need to express this in terms of the clock.\n\nThe first train leaves at 6 PM. So, 2.0714 hours after 6 PM would be approximately 8:04 PM.\n\nWait, let me calculate that properly.\n\n2 hours after 6 PM is 8 PM. Then 0.0714 hours is 0.0714 * 60 minutes = approximately 4.286 minutes, which is roughly 4 minutes and 17 seconds.\n\nSo, the time would be around 8:04 PM.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to approach this problem, like considering their relative speeds.\n\nSince they're traveling in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is 60 + 80 = 140 miles per hour.\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes for them to be 210 miles apart.\n\nHowever, since the second train leaves an hour later, the first train has already been traveling for one hour before the second train starts.\n\nIn that first hour, the first train covers 60 miles (since it travels at 60 mph).\n\nSo, when the second train starts at 7 PM, the initial distance between them is 60 miles.\n\nNow, both trains are moving away from each other at a combined speed of 140 mph.\n\nWe need the total distance between them to be 210 miles.\n\nSo, the additional distance needed is 210 - 60 = 150 miles.\n\nTime required to cover 150 miles at 140 mph is t = 150 / 140 = 1.0714 hours.\n\nSo, starting from 7 PM, it takes approximately 1 hour and 4 minutes to reach an additional 150 miles.\n\nTherefore, the total time from 6 PM is 1 hour (until 7 PM) plus 1.0714 hours, which is approximately 2.0714 hours, leading again to around 8:04 PM.\n\nAlternatively, since the second train leaves at 7 PM and it takes 1.0714 hours to reach the additional 150 miles, adding 1 hour and 4 minutes to 7 PM gives 8:04 PM.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 8:04 PM.\n\nBut maybe I should check if this makes sense.\n\nAt 7 PM:\n\n- Train 1 has already traveled 60 miles (6 PM to 7 PM).\n\n- Train 2 has just started.\n\nFrom 7 PM onwards:\n\n- Train 1 continues east at 60 mph.\n\n- Train 2 goes west at 80 mph.\n\nTheir combined speed apart is 140 mph.\n\nSo, distance apart increases by 140 miles each hour.\n\nAt 7 PM, initial distance is 60 miles.\n\nAfter t hours from 7 PM:\n\nDistance apart = 60 + 140t.\n\nSet this equal to 210 miles:\n\n60 + 140t = 210\n\n140t = 150\n\nt = 150 / 140 = 1.0714 hours.\n\nSo, time is 7 PM + 1 hour and 4 minutes, which is 8:04 PM.\n\nYes, this seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, considering the first train's travel:\n\nFrom 6 PM to 7 PM: 60 miles east.\n\nFrom 7 PM to 8 PM: another 60 miles east, total 120 miles.\n\nSecond train from 7 PM to 8 PM: 80 miles west.\n\nTotal distance apart at 8 PM: 120 (east) + 80 (west) = 200 miles.\n\nStill short of 210 miles.\n\nSo, continue:\n\nFrom 8 PM to 8:04 PM:\n\nFirst train travels 60 mph * 4 minutes = 60 * (4/60) = 4 miles east.\n\nSecond train travels 80 mph * 4 minutes = 80 * (4/60) = 5.333 miles west.\n\nSo, additional distance apart: 4 + 5.333 = 9.333 miles.\n\nAdding to the 200 miles at 8 PM: 200 + 9.333 = 209.333 miles, which is approximately 210 miles.\n\nTherefore, the time is around 8:04 PM.\n\nI think this is accurate enough.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8:04 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
