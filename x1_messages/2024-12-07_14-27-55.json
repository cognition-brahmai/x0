        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the car first travels at 50 miles per hour for 3 hours. To find out how far it goes in that time, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo for the first part:\n\nDistance\u2081 = 50 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 150 miles\n\nThen, the car increases its speed to 60 miles per hour and travels for another 2 hours. Again, using the same formula:\n\nDistance\u2082 = 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nNow, to find the total distance traveled, I just need to add these two distances together:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance\u2081 + Distance\u2082 = 150 miles + 120 miles = 270 miles\n\nSo, the car has traveled a total of 270 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{270} \\]"
