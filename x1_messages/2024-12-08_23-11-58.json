        "content": "To evaluate the integral of sin(x) from 0 to \u03c0/2, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the integral**: We need to compute the definite integral of sin(x) with respect to x, from x = 0 to x = \u03c0/2.\n\n2. **Find the antiderivative**: The antiderivative of sin(x) is -cos(x). This is because the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x), so when we take the negative, it becomes sin(x).\n\n3. **Apply the fundamental theorem of calculus**: This theorem states that the definite integral of a function from a to b is the antiderivative evaluated at b minus the antiderivative evaluated at a.\n\nSo, let's write this mathematically:\n\n\u222b from 0 to \u03c0/2 of sin(x) dx = [-cos(x)] from 0 to \u03c0/2\n\nNow, evaluate this:\n\n= -cos(\u03c0/2) - (-cos(0))\n\n= -cos(\u03c0/2) + cos(0)\n\n4. **Calculate the values**:\n\n- cos(\u03c0/2) = 0\n\n- cos(0) = 1\n\nSo, plugging these values in:\n\n= -0 + 1 = 1\n\nTherefore, the integral of sin(x) from 0 to \u03c0/2 is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
