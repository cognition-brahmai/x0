        "content": "To determine the amount of water needed to fill a cylindrical tank, we need to calculate the volume of the cylinder. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is given by:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( V \\) is the volume,\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the base,\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the tank is 4 meters, the radius \\( r \\) is half of the diameter:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{4 \\, \\text{meters}}{2} = 2 \\, \\text{meters} \\]\n\nThe height \\( h \\) is given as 5 meters.\n\nNow, plugging these values into the volume formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi (2 \\, \\text{m})^2 (5 \\, \\text{m}) \\]\n\\[ V = \\pi (4 \\, \\text{m}^2) (5 \\, \\text{m}) \\]\n\\[ V = \\pi (20 \\, \\text{m}^3) \\]\n\\[ V \\approx 3.14159 \\times 20 \\, \\text{m}^3 \\]\n\\[ V \\approx 62.8318 \\, \\text{m}^3 \\]\n\nTherefore, approximately 62.83 cubic meters of water would be needed to fill the cylindrical tank completely.\n\nIf you need the volume in liters (since 1 cubic meter equals 1000 liters), then:\n\n\\[ V \\approx 62.8318 \\, \\text{m}^3 \\times 1000 \\, \\text{L/m}^3 = 62,831.8 \\, \\text{liters} \\]\n\nSo, approximately 62,832 liters of water are required."
