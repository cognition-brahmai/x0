        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 5 red balls and 3 green balls, making a total of 8 balls. I need to find the probability that if I pick 2 balls at random without replacing them, both of them are red. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how probability works. The probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is picking 2 red balls, and the total possible outcomes are all the ways I can pick any 2 balls from the box.\n\nSo, let's figure out the total number of ways to pick 2 balls from 8. I think this is a combination problem because the order in which I pick the balls doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nHere, n = 8 and k = 2. So, the total number of ways to choose 2 balls from 8 is C(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8 - 2)!) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 6!) = (8 \u00d7 7) / 2 = 56 / 2 = 28. So, there are 28 possible ways to pick 2 balls from 8.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to pick 2 red balls from the 5 red balls available. Again, this is a combination problem. So, C(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5 - 2)!) = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 3!)) = (5 \u00d7 4) / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10. So, there are 10 ways to pick 2 red balls from 5.\n\nNow, the probability that both balls are red is the number of favorable outcomes (picking 2 red balls) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (picking any 2 balls from 8). So, probability = 10 / 28.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2: 10 \u00f7 2 = 5, and 28 \u00f7 2 = 14. So, the simplified fraction is 5/14.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using probabilities step by step, considering that the picking is without replacement.\n\nYes, I can think of it as the probability of picking a red ball first and then another red ball second, without replacing the first one.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball first is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 5/8.\n\nAfter picking one red ball, there are now 4 red balls left and a total of 7 balls left in the box.\n\nSo, the probability of picking another red ball is now 4/7.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, I multiply the probabilities: (5/8) \u00d7 (4/7) = (5 \u00d7 4) / (8 \u00d7 7) = 20 / 56.\n\nSimplifying 20/56 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4: 20 \u00f7 4 = 5, and 56 \u00f7 4 = 14. So, again, I get 5/14.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like 5/14 is the correct probability that both balls picked are red.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's another approach, maybe using permutations instead of combinations.\n\nIf I use permutations, the order would matter, but in this case, the order doesn't matter because I'm just interested in getting two red balls, regardless of the order.\n\nBut for the sake of practice, let's try it that way.\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 red balls in order is P(5, 2) = 5 \u00d7 4 = 20.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick any 2 balls in order is P(8, 2) = 8 \u00d7 7 = 56.\n\nSo, the probability is 20/56, which simplifies to 5/14 again.\n\nSame answer as before. So, no matter which method I use, I end up with 5/14.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The probability is definitely 5/14.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{14}} \\]"
