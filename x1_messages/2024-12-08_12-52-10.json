        "content": "Let's see. I have this sequence defined recursively: each term is three times the previous term minus two, and the first term is 5. So, a\u2081 = 5, and for any n greater than 1, a\u2099 = 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 - 2. I need to find a\u2085.\n\nOkay, I'll start by finding a\u2082. Using the formula:\n\na\u2082 = 3 * a\u2081 - 2 = 3 * 5 - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13.\n\nNow, a\u2083:\n\na\u2083 = 3 * a\u2082 - 2 = 3 * 13 - 2 = 39 - 2 = 37.\n\nNext, a\u2084:\n\na\u2084 = 3 * a\u2083 - 2 = 3 * 37 - 2 = 111 - 2 = 109.\n\nFinally, a\u2085:\n\na\u2085 = 3 * a\u2084 - 2 = 3 * 109 - 2 = 327 - 2 = 325.\n\nSo, the fifth term of the sequence is 325.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from a\u2081 = 5:\n\n- a\u2082 = 3*5 - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- a\u2083 = 3*13 - 2 = 39 - 2 = 37 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- a\u2084 = 3*37 - 2 = 111 - 2 = 109 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- a\u2085 = 3*109 - 2 = 327 - 2 = 325 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLooks good. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find a general formula for the nth term without having to calculate each step. That might be more efficient for larger n.\n\nLet's try to find a closed-form expression for a\u2099.\n\nGiven the recursive formula a\u2099 = 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 - 2, with a\u2081 = 5.\n\nThis is a linear recursive relation, and I think it can be solved to find a direct formula for a\u2099.\n\nFirst, I can look for a particular solution and a homogeneous solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation would be a\u2099 = 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081.\n\nAssuming a solution of the form a\u2099 = r^n, plugging into the homogeneous equation:\n\nr^n = 3r^{n-1} \u21d2 r = 3.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is a\u2099^{(h)} = c * 3^n, where c is a constant to be determined.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (-2), I can assume a particular solution that is a constant, say a\u2099^{(p)} = k.\n\nPlugging into the recursive formula:\n\nk = 3k - 2 \u21d2 2k = 2 \u21d2 k = 1.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = a\u2099^{(h)} + a\u2099^{(p)} = c * 3^n + 1.\n\nNow, use the initial condition a\u2081 = 5 to find c:\n\n5 = c * 3^1 + 1 \u21d2 5 = 3c + 1 \u21d2 3c = 4 \u21d2 c = 4/3.\n\nThus, the general formula for a\u2099 is:\n\na\u2099 = (4/3) * 3^n + 1.\n\nSimplifying:\n\na\u2099 = 4 * 3^{n-1} + 1.\n\nNow, let's verify this formula with the earlier terms.\n\nFor n = 1:\n\na\u2081 = 4 * 3^{0} + 1 = 4 * 1 + 1 = 5 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 2:\n\na\u2082 = 4 * 3^{1} + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 3:\n\na\u2083 = 4 * 3^{2} + 1 = 36 + 1 = 37 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 4:\n\na\u2084 = 4 * 3^{3} + 1 = 108 + 1 = 109 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 5:\n\na\u2085 = 4 * 3^{4} + 1 = 4 * 81 + 1 = 324 + 1 = 325 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula checks out with the earlier calculations.\n\nSo, a\u2085 = 325.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to find a general formula, I could have used the method of solving linear recursions.\n\nBut since the problem only asked for a\u2085, calculating step by step was straightforward.\n\nI'm confident that 325 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{325} \\]"
