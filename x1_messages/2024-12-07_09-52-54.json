        "content": "So, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is: if a baker bakes 12 loaves of bread every hour and works 8 hours a day, how many loaves does he bake in a month with 30 days?\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many loaves the baker bakes in one day. Since he bakes 12 loaves per hour and works 8 hours a day, I can multiply 12 by 8 to get the daily total.\n\n12 loaves/hour \u00d7 8 hours/day = 96 loaves/day\n\nSo, the baker bakes 96 loaves each day.\n\nNext, to find out how many loaves he bakes in a month of 30 days, I need to multiply the daily amount by the number of days in the month.\n\n96 loaves/day \u00d7 30 days = 2,880 loaves\n\nTherefore, the baker bakes 2,880 loaves in a month.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the total number of hours the baker works in a month and then multiply that by the number of loaves he bakes per hour.\n\nFirst, find the total hours worked in a month:\n\n8 hours/day \u00d7 30 days = 240 hours\n\nThen, multiply the total hours by the number of loaves per hour:\n\n240 hours \u00d7 12 loaves/hour = 2,880 loaves\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, it seems like 2,880 loaves is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation. For example, are there any holidays or days off that might reduce the number of days he works? The problem says he works 8 hours a day for 30 days, so I think it's safe to assume he works every day of the month.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies exactly 30 days, so I don't need to worry about different month lengths.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the baker might bake more or less loaves in certain hours. But the problem states that he bakes 12 loaves every hour, so his production rate is constant.\n\nSo, no, there don't seem to be any additional factors to consider. The calculation is straightforward.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let me do the math again.\n\nFirst, loaves per day:\n\n12 loaves/hour \u00d7 8 hours/day = 96 loaves/day\n\nThen, loaves per month:\n\n96 loaves/day \u00d7 30 days = 2,880 loaves\n\nAlternatively, total hours in a month:\n\n8 hours/day \u00d7 30 days = 240 hours\n\nThen, loaves per month:\n\n12 loaves/hour \u00d7 240 hours = 2,880 loaves\n\nYes, it's consistent. The answer is 2,880 loaves.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2880} \\]"
