The game's properties are named after actual locations in London, particularly in the Mayfair area, which is known for its high-end real estate. Players move around the board, buying, trading, and developing properties with the goal of driving their opponents into bankruptcy. The game has been localized in many countries, adapting the property names to reflect local landmarks and streets."
