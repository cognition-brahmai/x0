        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Let's create a simple command-line calculator in C++ that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We'll make sure it's user-friendly and handles basic operations correctly.\n\nFirst, we need to include the necessary headers. Since we're working with input and output in C++, we'll include `<iostream>`. Additionally, to make the code cleaner, we can use the `using namespace std;` directive, although it's generally good practice to avoid this in larger projects.\n\nNext, we'll write a function to handle the calculations based on the operator provided by the user. This function will take two numbers and an operator as arguments and return the result.\n\nWe'll also need to handle user input: asking for two numbers and the operator they want to use. After getting the input, we'll call our calculation function and display the result.\n\nFinally, we should consider edge cases, such as division by zero, to make sure our program doesn't crash or give incorrect results.\n\nLet's go through this step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Include Headers and Define Namespace\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the Calculation Function\n\nWe'll create a function named `calculate` that takes two double values and a char operator, and returns the result of the operation.\n\n```cpp\ndouble calculate(double num1, double num2, char op) {\n    switch (op) {\n        case '+':\n            return num1 + num2;\n        case '-':\n            return num1 - num2;\n        case '*':\n            return num1 * num2;\n        case '/':\n            if (num2 != 0) {\n                return num1 / num2;\n            } else {\n                cout << \"Error: Division by zero.\" << endl;\n                return NAN; // Not a Number\n            }\n        default:\n            cout << \"Error: Invalid operator.\" << endl;\n            return NAN;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Main Function to Handle User Input and Output\n\nIn the `main` function, we'll prompt the user to enter two numbers and an operator, call the `calculate` function, and display the result.\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    double num1, num2;\n    char operatorChar;\n\n    cout << \"Simple Calculator\" << endl;\n    cout << \"Enter first number: \";\n    cin >> num1;\n    cout << \"Enter second number: \";\n    cin >> num2;\n    cout << \"Enter operator (+, -, *, /): \";\n    cin >> operatorChar;\n\n    double result = calculate(num1, num2, operatorChar);\n    if (!isnan(result)) {\n        cout << \"Result: \" << result << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Compile and Run the Program\n\nTo compile the program, save it to a file, for example, `calculator.cpp`, and use a C++ compiler like g++. Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the file, and run:\n\n```sh\ng++ calculator.cpp -o calculator\n./calculator\n```\n\nThis will compile the program and create an executable named `calculator`. Running this executable will start the calculator.\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Headers and Namespace**: We include `<iostream>` for input and output operations and use `std` namespace for convenience.\n2. **Calculate Function**: This function performs the arithmetic operation based on the operator provided. It handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, including checking for division by zero.\n3. **Main Function**: This function handles user interaction. It reads two numbers and an operator from the user, calls the `calculate` function, and prints the result if the operation is valid.\n\nThis simple calculator should meet the requirements you've specified.
