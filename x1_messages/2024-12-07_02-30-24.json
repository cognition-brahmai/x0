        "content": "So I've got this election scenario here, and I need to figure out what percentage of the total votes each candidate received. Candidate A has 12,500 votes, and Candidate B has 9,750 votes. To find the percentage each candidate received, I need to first find the total number of votes cast in the election. That should be the sum of the votes for both candidates.\n\nSo, total votes = votes for Candidate A + votes for Candidate B = 12,500 + 9,750.\n\nLet me calculate that: 12,500 plus 9,750. 12,500 plus 9,000 is 21,500, and then plus 750 is 22,250. So, the total number of votes is 22,250.\n\nNow, to find the percentage for Candidate A, I need to divide the number of votes Candidate A received by the total number of votes, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nSo, percentage for Candidate A = (votes for A / total votes) * 100 = (12,500 / 22,250) * 100.\n\nLet me calculate that. First, divide 12,500 by 22,250. Let's see, 12,500 divided by 22,250.\n\nI can simplify this fraction before dividing. Both numbers are divisible by 250.\n\n12,500 divided by 250 is 50, and 22,250 divided by 250 is 89.\n\nSo, 12,500 / 22,250 = 50 / 89.\n\nNow, divide 50 by 89. Let's do that division.\n\n50 divided by 89 is approximately 0.5618.\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage: 0.5618 * 100 = 56.18%.\n\nSo, Candidate A received approximately 56.18% of the total votes.\n\nNow, for Candidate B, it's a similar process.\n\nPercentage for Candidate B = (votes for B / total votes) * 100 = (9,750 / 22,250) * 100.\n\nAgain, using the simplified fraction. Earlier, we saw that 22,250 divided by 250 is 89, and 9,750 divided by 250 is 39.\n\nSo, 9,750 / 22,250 = 39 / 89.\n\nNow, divide 39 by 89.\n\n39 divided by 89 is approximately 0.4382.\n\nMultiply by 100 to get the percentage: 0.4382 * 100 = 43.82%.\n\nSo, Candidate B received approximately 43.82% of the total votes.\n\nJust to check if these percentages add up to 100%, let's add them together:\n\n56.18% + 43.82% = 100%.\n\nPerfect, it adds up.\n\nAlternatively, if there were only two candidates, once I have one candidate's percentage, I could subtract it from 100% to get the other candidate's percentage. But calculating both separately is good for verification.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Candidate A: 56.18%\n\n- Candidate B: 43.82%\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{56.18\\% \\text{ for Candidate A and } 43.82\\% \\text{ for Candidate B}} \\]"
