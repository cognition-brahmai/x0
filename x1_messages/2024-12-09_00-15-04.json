Tolkien's Middle-earth, the fictional volcanic mountain that serves as the ultimate destination for Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee in their quest to destroy the One Ring is Mount Doom, also known as Orodruin in Sindarin. This active volcano is located in the heart of Mordor, the realm of the Dark Lord Sauron. It was here that the One Ring was forged, and it is the only place where it can be unmade, by casting it back into the fires from which it was created. Frodo and Sam face countless dangers and trials as they make their perilous journey to reach Mount Doom and fulfill their mission to save Middle-earth from Sauron's tyranny."
