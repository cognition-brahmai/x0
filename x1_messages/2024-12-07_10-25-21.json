        "content": "The automobile was invented by several individuals contributing to its development over time, rather than a single inventor. However, the first modern automobile is often credited to Karl Benz, who patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen in 1886. As for the assembly line, it was pioneered by Ransom E. Olds in 1901 at his Olds Motor Vehicle Company, but it was Henry Ford who popularized and perfected the moving assembly line for mass production of automobiles in 1913."
