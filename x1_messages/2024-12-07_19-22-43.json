        "content": "Let's tackle this population problem step by step. So, we've got a city with a population of 1 million people. The birth rate is 12 per 1000 people, and the death rate is 8 per 1000 people. We need to find out the net increase in population after one year.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what birth and death rates mean. The birth rate is the number of births per 1000 people in the population per year, and the death rate is the number of deaths per 1000 people in the population per year. So, in this city, for every 1000 people, there are 12 births and 8 deaths each year.\n\nTo find the net increase, I should probably calculate the total number of births and subtract the total number of deaths in one year. That should give me the net increase in population.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total number of births. The birth rate is 12 per 1000 people. Since the population is 1 million, which is 1,000,000 people, I need to find out how many groups of 1000 people there are in 1,000,000.\n\nNumber of groups of 1000 in 1,000,000 is 1,000,000 / 1000 = 1000.\n\nSo, there are 1000 groups of 1000 people in the population.\n\nNow, if each group of 1000 people has 12 births per year, then the total number of births in the city per year is 12 births/group * 1000 groups = 12,000 births.\n\nSimilarly, for deaths, the death rate is 8 per 1000 people. Using the same approach, the total number of deaths per year is 8 deaths/group * 1000 groups = 8,000 deaths.\n\nNow, to find the net increase in population, I subtract the total deaths from the total births:\n\nNet increase = Total births - Total deaths = 12,000 - 8,000 = 4,000 people.\n\nSo, the net increase in population after one year is 4,000 people.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using rates directly on the population.\n\nLet's try that. The birth rate is 12 per 1000 people, which can also be expressed as 12/1000 = 0.012 or 1.2% per year.\n\nSimilarly, the death rate is 8 per 1000 people, which is 8/1000 = 0.008 or 0.8% per year.\n\nSo, the net growth rate would be birth rate minus death rate: 0.012 - 0.008 = 0.004 or 0.4% per year.\n\nNow, applying this net growth rate to the initial population:\n\nNet increase = Initial population * net growth rate = 1,000,000 * 0.004 = 4,000 people.\n\nLooks like I get the same answer using this method, which is a good sign.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of proportions. The birth rate is 12 per 1000, so the proportion of the population born in a year is 12/1000 = 0.012.\n\nSimilarly, the proportion dying is 8/1000 = 0.008.\n\nNet change in proportion is 0.012 - 0.008 = 0.004.\n\nSo, 0.004 of the population is the net increase.\n\nTherefore, net increase = 0.004 * 1,000,000 = 4,000 people.\n\nAgain, the same answer. Seems consistent.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors that might affect the population change. Are there migrations, for example? The problem doesn't mention any immigration or emigration, so I'll assume that the population change is only due to births and deaths.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the rates are per year, which they are, as stated in the problem.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the rates are constant over the year. Since the problem doesn't specify any variations, I'll assume they are constant.\n\nI also need to ensure that I'm using the correct units. The population is in people, and the rates are per 1000 people per year, which matches up correctly.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst method:\n\n- Total births: (12 births/1000 people) * 1,000,000 people = 12,000 births\n\n- Total deaths: (8 deaths/1000 people) * 1,000,000 people = 8,000 deaths\n\n- Net increase: 12,000 - 8,000 = 4,000 people\n\nSecond method:\n\n- Net growth rate: 12/1000 - 8/1000 = 4/1000 = 0.004 per year\n\n- Net increase: 0.004 * 1,000,000 = 4,000 people\n\nThird method:\n\n- Proportion born: 12/1000 = 0.012\n\n- Proportion dying: 8/1000 = 0.008\n\n- Net change proportion: 0.012 - 0.008 = 0.004\n\n- Net increase: 0.004 * 1,000,000 = 4,000 people\n\nAll methods lead to the same conclusion: the net increase in population after one year is 4,000 people.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The problem seems straightforward, and I've verified the answer using multiple approaches, which gives me confidence in the result.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4000} \\]"
