        "content": "To find the average speed for the entire trip, we need to consider both the distances traveled and the times taken at each speed. Average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.\n\nFirst, let's break down the trip into two parts:\n\n1. The car travels 50 miles at 25 miles per hour.\n\n2. Then, it travels another 50 miles at 50 miles per hour.\n\nWe need to find the time taken for each part of the trip.\n\nFor the first part:\n\nDistance = 50 miles\n\nSpeed = 25 mph\n\nTime = Distance / Speed = 50 / 25 = 2 hours\n\nFor the second part:\n\nDistance = 50 miles\n\nSpeed = 50 mph\n\nTime = Distance / Speed = 50 / 50 = 1 hour\n\nNow, let's find the total distance and total time:\n\nTotal distance = 50 miles + 50 miles = 100 miles\n\nTotal time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours\n\nTherefore, the average speed for the entire trip is:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time = 100 miles / 3 hours \u2248 33.33 mph\n\nSo, the average speed of the entire trip is approximately 33.33 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33.\\overline{3} \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]"
