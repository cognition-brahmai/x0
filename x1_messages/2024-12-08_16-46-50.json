        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 students in total, and the ratio of boys to girls is 3:2. That means for every 3 boys, there are 2 girls. So, I need to figure out how many groups of 3 boys and 2 girls make up the class.\n\nFirst, I'll add the parts of the ratio together: 3 parts boys plus 2 parts girls equals 5 parts in total. Now, since there are 30 students in total, each part must represent 30 divided by 5, which is 6 students per part.\n\nSo, if each part is 6 students, then the number of boys is 3 parts times 6 students per part, which is 18 boys. And the number of girls is 2 parts times 6 students per part, which is 12 girls.\n\nLet me double-check that: 18 boys plus 12 girls equals 30 students, which matches the total given. Also, the ratio of 18 to 12 simplifies to 3 to 2, which matches the given ratio. So, I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18 \\text{ boys and } 12 \\text{ girls}} \\]"
