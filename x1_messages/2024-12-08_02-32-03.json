        "content": "So, I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden that measures 20 meters by 15 meters. The gardener wants to plant flowers around the perimeter, and each flower needs 1 meter of space. I need to figure out how many flowers can be planted.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the perimeter of a rectangle is. I remember that the perimeter is the total distance around the shape. For a rectangle, you can calculate it by adding up all the sides. Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, it's probably easier to use a formula like Perimeter = 2*(length + width).\n\nSo, in this case, the length is 20 meters and the width is 15 meters. Plugging those values into the formula, Perimeter = 2*(20 + 15) = 2*(35) = 70 meters.\n\nNow, each flower requires 1 meter of space. So, if the perimeter is 70 meters, and each flower takes up 1 meter, then the number of flowers that can be planted should be equal to the perimeter in meters.\n\nWait a minute, is it that straightforward? Let me think about it. If you're planting flowers around the perimeter, and each flower needs 1 meter of space, then yes, you can fit one flower per meter.\n\nBut, I should consider whether the flowers are being planted at the corners. In a rectangle, the corners are angles, so if you're planting flowers at each corner, you need to make sure you're not double-counting the space at the corners.\n\nLet me visualize this. Imagine starting at one corner and planting a flower there. Then, moving along the length of 20 meters, planting flowers every meter. When you reach the next corner, you plant another flower. Then, move along the width of 15 meters, planting flowers every meter, and so on, around the rectangle.\n\nIf I do it this way, the flowers at the corners are shared by two sides. So, for example, the first flower is at the corner, and it's counted for both the length and the width.\n\nBut in terms of space, since each flower requires 1 meter, and the perimeter is 70 meters, it should still work out to 70 flowers, with the corner flowers being part of both sides.\n\nLet me check this another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of flowers for each side and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the longer sides: each is 20 meters long. If you plant flowers every meter, starting from one end to the other, that's 20 flowers per long side.\n\nThen, the shorter sides: each is 15 meters long. Planting flowers every meter, that's 15 flowers per short side.\n\nSo, for two long sides: 2 * 20 = 40 flowers.\n\nFor two short sides: 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.\n\nTotal flowers: 40 + 30 = 70 flowers.\n\nWait, but in this method, the corner flowers are being counted twice, once for each side that meets at the corner. Since there are four corners, that means 4 flowers are being double-counted.\n\nSo, to get the correct total, I should subtract the 4 double-counted flowers.\n\nTherefore, total flowers = 70 - 4 = 66 flowers.\n\nBut earlier, using the perimeter method, I got 70 flowers. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nLet me think again. If I use the perimeter method, the perimeter is 70 meters, and each flower takes 1 meter. But in reality, when planting flowers around a closed shape like a rectangle, the number of flowers is equal to the perimeter in meters because the last flower connects back to the first one, forming a closed loop.\n\nIn this case, you don't need to subtract the corner flowers because they are part of the perimeter.\n\nMaybe the double-counting approach is incorrect.\n\nLet me try to think of it differently. Imagine you're walking around the perimeter and planting a flower every meter. When you reach a corner, you plant a flower and continue along the next side. Since each side is measured independently, and the corners are included in both sides, but in reality, the space is continuous.\n\nSo, the perimeter calculation should account for this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the number of points around a rectangle.\n\nWait, in discrete mathematics, when placing objects around a rectangle, you need to consider whether the corners are included or not.\n\nLet me try a smaller example to see.\n\nSuppose I have a smaller rectangle, say 2 meters by 1 meter.\n\nPerimeter = 2*(2 + 1) = 6 meters.\n\nIf I plant flowers every meter:\n\n- Starting at corner A, plant flower 1.\n\n- Move 1 meter to point B, plant flower 2.\n\n- Move 1 meter to corner C, plant flower 3.\n\n- Move 1 meter to point D, plant flower 4.\n\n- Move 1 meter to corner E (which is back to corner A), plant flower 5.\n\n- But wait, I've already planted at corner A, so do I need a fifth flower?\n\nActually, in a closed loop, the first and last flowers coincide, so you might think that the number of flowers is equal to the perimeter in meters.\n\nBut in this example, the perimeter is 6 meters, but when planting flowers every meter, you end up with 6 flowers, not 5.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n- Start at corner A, plant flower 1.\n\n- Move 1 meter to point B (not a corner), plant flower 2.\n\n- Move 1 meter to corner C, plant flower 3.\n\n- Move 1 meter to point D (not a corner), plant flower 4.\n\n- Move 1 meter to corner E (which is corner A), plant flower 5.\n\n- But since corner A already has flower 1, you don't need a sixth flower.\n\nWait, this suggests that the number of flowers is equal to the perimeter in meters, which is 6.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, perimeter is 70 meters, so 70 flowers.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered the sides separately, I got 70 flowers, but then thought about subtracting the corner flowers, leading to 66 flowers.\n\nNow, I'm confused.\n\nLet me try to think about it differently. Perhaps I should consider that the flowers are placed at the endpoints of each meter segment.\n\nSo, for a side of 20 meters, you have 21 planting positions (including both ends).\n\nSimilarly, for a side of 15 meters, you have 16 planting positions.\n\nBut then, for the entire rectangle:\n\n- Two long sides: 21 + 21 = 42 positions.\n\n- Two short sides: 16 + 16 = 32 positions.\n\n- Total positions: 42 + 32 = 74.\n\n- But this counts the corner positions twice.\n\n- Since there are four corners, subtract 4 for the double-counted positions.\n\n- Therefore, total flowers: 74 - 4 = 70 flowers.\n\nWait, this seems consistent with the perimeter method.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the number of flowers being equal to the number of meter segments around the perimeter, which is 70.\n\nIn the smaller example, perimeter is 6 meters, number of flowers is 6.\n\nSo, in the original problem, the number of flowers is equal to the perimeter in meters, which is 70.\n\nTherefore, the gardener can plant 70 flowers around the perimeter of the garden.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]"
