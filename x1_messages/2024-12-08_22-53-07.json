        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 30 people in a group: 17 have brown eyes, 12 have blue eyes, and 1 has green eyes. I need to find the probability that if I randomly select two people from this group, both of them have brown eyes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the event is selecting two people with brown eyes. So, the favorable outcomes are the ways to choose two brown-eyed people, and the total possible outcomes are the ways to choose any two people from the group.\n\nLet's start by finding the total number of ways to choose two people from 30. This is a combination problem because the order in which we select the people doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 people from 30 is:\n\n\\[\nC(30, 2) = \\frac{30!}{2!(30 - 2)!} = \\frac{30!}{2! \\times 28!}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the \\( 28! \\) in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(30, 2) = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 28!} = \\frac{30 \\times 29}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{870}{2} = 435\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 435 possible ways to choose any two people from the group.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to choose two brown-eyed people. There are 17 brown-eyed people, so I'll use the combination formula again:\n\n\\[\nC(17, 2) = \\frac{17!}{2!(17 - 2)!} = \\frac{17!}{2! \\times 15!}\n\\]\n\nAgain, simplifying by canceling out the \\( 15! \\):\n\n\\[\nC(17, 2) = \\frac{17 \\times 16 \\times 15!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 15!} = \\frac{17 \\times 16}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{272}{2} = 136\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 136 ways to choose two brown-eyed people.\n\nNow, the probability that both selected people have brown eyes is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both brown eyes}) = \\frac{136}{435}\n\\]\n\nI should check if this fraction can be simplified. Let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 136 and 435.\n\nFirst, find the prime factors of each number.\n\n136:\n\n136 \u00f7 2 = 68\n\n68 \u00f7 2 = 34\n\n34 \u00f7 2 = 17\n\n17 is a prime number.\n\nSo, 136 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 17 = \\( 2^3 \\times 17 \\)\n\n435:\n\n435 \u00f7 5 = 87\n\n87 \u00f7 3 = 29\n\n29 is a prime number.\n\nSo, 435 = 5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 29\n\nThere are no common prime factors between 136 and 435, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both selected people have brown eyes is \\( \\frac{136}{435} \\).\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal or a percentage for better understanding.\n\nTo convert to a decimal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{136}{435} \\approx 0.3126\n\\]\n\nTo convert to a percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.3126 \\times 100 \\approx 31.26\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, there's approximately a 31.26% chance that both selected people have brown eyes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the total number of ways to choose 2 people from 30 is indeed 435.\n\nThen, the number of ways to choose 2 brown-eyed people from 17 is 136.\n\nSo, the probability is \\( \\frac{136}{435} \\), which is approximately 0.3126 or 31.26%.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use probabilities sequentially.\n\nThe probability that the first person selected has brown eyes is \\( \\frac{17}{30} \\).\n\nGiven that the first person has brown eyes, there are now 16 brown-eyed people left and a total of 29 people left to choose from.\n\nSo, the probability that the second person also has brown eyes is \\( \\frac{16}{29} \\).\n\nTherefore, the overall probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{17}{30} \\times \\frac{16}{29} = \\frac{272}{870}\n\\]\n\nWait, 17 times 16 is 272, and 30 times 29 is 870.\n\nNow, simplify \\( \\frac{272}{870} \\).\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{136}{435}\n\\]\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the probability is \\( \\frac{136}{435} \\), or approximately 31.26%.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{136}{435}} \\]"
