        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Java program that reads a CSV file with names and ages, sorts them by age in descending order, and then writes the sorted data to a new CSV file. Also, I need to make sure it handles exceptions if the input file is missing or incorrect.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a CSV file is. CSV stands for Comma-Separated Values, which is a simple file format used to store tabular data, where each line represents a record and fields within the record are separated by commas.\n\nSo, the input file might look something like this:\n\nJohn,25\n\nAlice,30\n\nBob,22\n\nEach line has a name and an age separated by a comma.\n\nMy program needs to read this file, sort the entries based on age in descending order, and then write them to a new CSV file.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to follow:\n\n1. **Reading the CSV file:**\n\n- Open the file.\n\n- Read each line.\n\n- Parse each line to separate names and ages.\n\n2. **Storing the data:**\n\n- I need to store the names and ages in a way that allows sorting by age.\n\n- Maybe use a list of custom objects, where each object has a name and an age.\n\n3. **Sorting the data:**\n\n- Sort the list of objects based on age in descending order.\n\n- I can use Collections.sort() with a custom comparator.\n\n4. **Writing to a new CSV file:**\n\n- Create a new file.\n\n- Write each sorted entry to this file, in the same format.\n\n5. **Handling exceptions:**\n\n- If the input file is missing, handle the FileNotFoundException.\n\n- If the file is not a valid CSV, handle parsing errors.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline of the classes and methods I might need.\n\nI'll need a class to represent a Person, with name and age fields.\n\n```java\n\nclass Person {\n\n    String name;\n\n    int age;\n\n    Person(String name, int age) {\n\n        this.name = name;\n\n        this.age = age;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThen, in my main class, I'll have methods to read the file, sort the list, and write the file.\n\nBut first, I need to handle file reading. I'll use the BufferedReader to read the file line by line.\n\nI need to handle exceptions, so I'll put the file reading code in a try-catch block for FileNotFoundException and IOException.\n\nWhile reading each line, I'll split the line by comma to get the name and age.\n\nI need to handle cases where the line is not properly formatted, so I should check if there are exactly two parts after splitting.\n\nIf not, I might want to skip that line or log an error.\n\nOnce I have the name and age, I'll create a Person object and add it to a list.\n\nAfter reading all lines, I'll sort the list using Collections.sort() with a comparator that sorts by age in descending order.\n\nFinally, I'll write the sorted list to a new CSV file.\n\nFor writing the file, I'll use BufferedWriter.\n\nAgain, I need to handle exceptions for file writing.\n\nI should also make sure to close the readers and writers properly, maybe using try-with-resources to handle this automatically.\n\nLet me think about the method structures.\n\nProbably, I'll have:\n\n- readCSVFile(String filePath): List<Person>\n\n- sortPeople(List<Person> people): List<Person>\n\n- writeCSVFile(List<Person> people, String filePath)\n\nIn sortPeople, I can use Collections.sort() with a lambda expression for the comparator.\n\nLike:\n\nCollections.sort(people, (p1, p2) -> p2.age - p1.age);\n\nFor writing the file, I'll iterate through the sorted list and write each person's name and age to the file, separated by a comma.\n\nI should also handle any exceptions that occur during writing.\n\nAdditionally, I might want to choose the output file name based on the input file name, or allow it to be specified by the user.\n\nFor now, I'll assume the output file name is \"sorted_\" + inputFileName.\n\nSo, if input is \"people.csv\", output will be \"sorted_people.csv\".\n\nI need to make sure that the program can take the input file path as a command-line argument.\n\nSo, in the main method, I'll check if the file path is provided, and if not, prompt the user to enter it.\n\nWait, better yet, I can make it accept the input file path as a command-line argument.\n\nIf not provided, display an error message.\n\nAlternatively, I can hardcode the input file path for now, and later make it more flexible.\n\nBut for a robust program, it's better to accept it as an argument.\n\nSo, in main, I'll check if args.length is at least 1, and if not, print usage instructions.\n\nAssuming the program is called with java MyClass input.csv, then args[0] will be \"input.csv\".\n\nThen, I'll call readCSVFile with args[0], sort the list, and write to \"sorted_\" + args[0].\n\nNow, let's think about exception handling in more detail.\n\nIf the input file doesn't exist, FileNotFoundException will be thrown.\n\nI should catch that and inform the user that the file was not found.\n\nIf there are issues reading the file, catch IOException and inform accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, while writing the file, if there are issues, catch IOException.\n\nAlso, if there are parsing errors, like age not being an integer, or lines not having exactly two fields, I should handle those gracefully, perhaps by skipping those lines or logging an error.\n\nFor age parsing, I can use Integer.parseInt(), which can throw NumberFormatException if the age is not a valid integer.\n\nSo, I need to catch that and handle it.\n\nMaybe I'll collect such errors in a list and report them all at the end.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll just skip those lines and print a warning message for each invalid line.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that the program doesn't crash if the file is empty.\n\nIn that case, the list will be empty, and sorting and writing should handle that gracefully.\n\nAlright, I think I have a plan.\n\nLet me start by implementing the Person class.\n\nThen, I'll work on the readCSVFile method.\n\nI'll use try-with-resources to handle BufferedReader.\n\nSplit each line by \",\", and check if the array length is 2.\n\nIf yes, extract name and age, create Person object, add to list.\n\nIf not, print a warning and skip that line.\n\nHandle NumberFormatException when parsing age.\n\nThen, implement the sortPeople method using Collections.sort() with a comparator.\n\nNext, implement writeCSVFile, again using try-with-resources for BufferedWriter.\n\nIterate through the sorted list and write each person's name and age, separated by comma.\n\nFinally, in the main method, check if args has at least one element, then call these methods in sequence, handling exceptions.\n\nI should also ensure that the output file is not overwritten if it already exists, or at least inform the user.\n\nMaybe check if the output file exists before writing, and prompt to overwrite or choose a different name.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll just overwrite the file if it exists.\n\nI need to make sure that the program is user-friendly and provides clear messages.\n\nSo, I'll print messages like \"Reading file: input.csv\", \"Sorting data...\", \"Writing sorted file: sorted_input.csv\", and \"Done.\"\n\nAlso, if there are any errors, provide meaningful error messages.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered the main points.\n\nNow, I'll start writing the code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Java program that reads a CSV file containing names and ages of people, sorts them by age in descending order, and writes the sorted data to a new CSV file. The program should also handle exceptions for missing or incorrect input files.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Reading the CSV file:**\n   - Use `BufferedReader` to read the file line by line.\n   - Split each line by comma to separate names and ages.\n   - Store each person's data in a `Person` object and add it to a list.\n\n2. **Sorting the data:**\n   - Use `Collections.sort()` with a custom comparator to sort the list of `Person` objects by age in descending order.\n\n3. **Writing to a new CSV file:**\n   - Use `BufferedWriter` to write the sorted data to a new CSV file.\n\n4. **Handling exceptions:**\n   - Catch `FileNotFoundException` if the input file is missing.\n   - Catch `IOException` for other I/O errors.\n   - Handle `NumberFormatException` if age values are not integers.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\nclass Person {\n    String name;\n    int age;\n\n    Person(String name, int age) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = age;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class SortCSV {\n\n    private static List<Person> readCSVFile(String filePath) {\n        List<Person> people = new ArrayList<>();\n        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {\n            String line;\n            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n                String[] parts = line.split(\",\");\n                if (parts.length != 2) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Skipping invalid line: \" + line);\n                    continue;\n                }\n                try {\n                    String name = parts[0].trim();\n                    int age = Integer.parseInt(parts[1].trim());\n                    people.add(new Person(name, age));\n                } catch (NumberFormatException e) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Invalid age format: \" + parts[1]);\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n            System.out.println(\"File not found: \" + filePath);\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            System.out.println(\"Error reading file: \" + e.getMessage());\n        }\n        return people;\n    }\n\n    private static List<Person> sortPeople(List<Person> people) {\n        Collections.sort(people, (p1, p2) -> p2.age - p1.age);\n        return people;\n    }\n\n    private static void writeCSVFile(List<Person> people, String filePath) {\n        try (BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(filePath))) {\n            for (Person person : people) {\n                bw.write(person.name + \",\" + person.age);\n                bw.newLine();\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            System.out.println(\"Error writing file: \" + e.getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        if (args.length < 1) {\n            System.out.println(\"Please provide the input CSV file path.\");\n            return;\n        }\n        String inputPath = args[0];\n        String outputPath = \"sorted_\" + inputPath;\n\n        System.out.println(\"Reading file: \" + inputPath);\n        List<Person> people = readCSVFile(inputPath);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Sorting data...\");\n        List<Person> sortedPeople = sortPeople(people);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Writing sorted file: \" + outputPath);\n        writeCSVFile(sortedPeople, outputPath);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Done.\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Person Class:**\n   - A simple class to hold the name and age of a person.\n\n2. **readCSVFile Method:**\n   - Reads the CSV file and parses it into a list of `Person` objects.\n   - Skips invalid lines and handles formatting errors.\n\n3. **sortPeople Method:**\n   - Sorts the list of `Person` objects by age in descending order using a comparator.\n\n4. **writeCSVFile Method:**\n   - Writes the sorted list of `Person` objects to a new CSV file.\n\n5. **main Method:**\n   - Accepts the input file path from command-line arguments.\n   - Calls the reading, sorting, and writing methods in sequence.\n   - Handles exceptions and provides user feedback through print statements."
