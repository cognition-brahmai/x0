        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a bakery that sells cupcakes in boxes of 6, 9, and 12, and a customer wants exactly 45 cupcakes. We need to find out the minimum number of boxes required to make up exactly 45 cupcakes.\n\nFirst, I should note that the box sizes are 6, 9, and 12 cupcakes each. These are all multiples of 3, which means that any combination of these boxes will give a total that's a multiple of 3. Since 45 is also a multiple of 3, it's possible to make up 45 cupcakes using these box sizes.\n\nNow, the goal is to minimize the number of boxes. So, I should try to use as few boxes as possible to reach exactly 45 cupcakes.\n\nOne approach is to start with the largest box size and see how many of those I can use without exceeding 45.\n\nThe largest box is 12 cupcakes. Let's see how many 12-cupcake boxes I can use:\n\n45 \u00f7 12 = 3 with a remainder of 9.\n\nSo, if I use 3 boxes of 12 cupcakes, that's 36 cupcakes, and I'll need an additional 9 cupcakes to reach 45.\n\nNow,\u5e78\u4e8f\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e5f\u67099 cupcakes\u7684\u76d2\u5b50\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u518d\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a9 cupcakes\u7684\u76d2\u5b50\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u603b\u5171\u662f3\u4e2a12 cupcakes\u7684\u76d2\u5b50\u52a0\u4e0a1\u4e2a9 cupcakes\u7684\u76d2\u5b50\uff0c\u603b\u51714\u4e2a\u76d2\u5b50\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u9700\u8981\u786e\u8ba4\u4e00\u4e0b\u662f\u5426\u6709\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u76d2\u5b50\u7ec4\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u523045 cupcakes\u3002\n\n\u6bd4\u5982\u8bf4\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6211\u4f7f\u75282\u4e2a12 cupcakes\u7684\u76d2\u5b50\uff0c\u90a3\u5c31\u662f24 cupcakes\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u898145 - 24 = 21 cupcakes\u3002\n\n\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u770b\u770b\u600e\u4e48\u7ec4\u54086, 9,\u548c12\u6765\u5f97\u523021 cupcakes\u3002\n\n21 \u00f7 9 = 2 with a remainder of 3, but 3 isn't a available box size.\n\nWait, but I can use a combination of 9 and 12.\n\nWait, 21 is not a multiple of 6 or 9 or 12, so I need to find a combination.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- 2 boxes of 9 cupcakes: 18 cupcakes, plus 1 box of 6 cupcakes: 6 cupcakes. Total 24 cupcakes, which is more than 21.\n\nThat doesn't work.\n\n- 1 box of 9 cupcakes: 9 cupcakes, plus 2 boxes of 6 cupcakes: 12 cupcakes. Total 21 cupcakes.\n\nSo, 1 box of 9 and 2 boxes of 6 would make 21 cupcakes.\n\nTherefore, if I use 2 boxes of 12, 1 box of 9, and 2 boxes of 6, that's a total of 5 boxes.\n\nBut earlier, using 3 boxes of 12 and 1 box of 9, I only needed 4 boxes.\n\nSo, that's worse than the previous option.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nWhat if I use 1 box of 12 cupcakes: 12 cupcakes, and need 45 - 12 = 33 cupcakes.\n\nNow, 33 divided by 9 is 3 with a remainder of 6.\n\nSo, 3 boxes of 9 cupcakes: 27 cupcakes, plus 1 box of 6 cupcakes: 6 cupcakes, totaling 33 cupcakes.\n\nSo, in this case, it's 1 box of 12, 3 boxes of 9, and 1 box of 6, totaling 5 boxes.\n\nThat's worse than the previous option of 4 boxes.\n\nLet me try using only 9 and 12 boxes.\n\nSo, no 6-cupcake boxes.\n\n45 divided by 12 is 3 with a remainder of 9.\n\nSo, 3 boxes of 12 and 1 box of 9, totaling 4 boxes, which matches my first option.\n\nIs there a way to use fewer than 4 boxes?\n\nLet's see.\n\nWhat if I try to use more 9-cupcake boxes and fewer 12-cupcake boxes.\n\nFor example, 4 boxes of 9 cupcakes: 36 cupcakes, plus 1 box of 9 cupcakes: 9 cupcakes, totaling 45 cupcakes.\n\nWait, no: 4 boxes of 9 would be 36, plus 1 box of 9 would be 45.\n\nWait, that's 5 boxes in total.\n\nWait, no: 4 boxes of 9 is 36, plus 1 box of 9 is 45, but that's 5 boxes, which is worse than 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, 4 boxes of 9 is 36, plus 1 box of 9 is 45, but that's 5 boxes.\n\nWait, but earlier, I had 3 boxes of 12 and 1 box of 9, which is 4 boxes.\n\nIs there a way to use only 3 boxes?\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf I use 3 boxes of 12, that's 36 cupcakes, and I need 9 more.\n\nSo, 1 box of 9 cupcakes, totaling 4 boxes.\n\nIs there a combination of 3 boxes that adds up to 45?\n\nLet's see.\n\nPossible combinations of 3 boxes:\n\n- 3 boxes of 12: 36 cupcakes (need 9 more)\n\n- 2 boxes of 12 and 1 box of 9: 24 + 9 = 33 cupcakes (need 12 more)\n\n- 2 boxes of 12 and 1 box of 6: 24 + 6 = 30 cupcakes (need 15 more)\n\n- 1 box of 12, 2 boxes of 9: 12 + 18 = 30 cupcakes (need 15 more)\n\n- 1 box of 12, 1 box of 9, 1 box of 6: 12 + 9 + 6 = 27 cupcakes (need 18 more)\n\n- 3 boxes of 9: 27 cupcakes (need 18 more)\n\n- 2 boxes of 9 and 1 box of 6: 18 + 6 = 24 cupcakes (need 21 more)\n\n- 1 box of 9 and 2 boxes of 6: 9 + 12 = 21 cupcakes (need 24 more)\n\n- 3 boxes of 6: 18 cupcakes (need 27 more)\n\nNone of these combinations of 3 boxes add up to 45 cupcakes.\n\nSo, it's not possible to make 45 cupcakes with only 3 boxes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of boxes needed is 4.\n\nBut let me check if there's a way to use 4 boxes in a different combination.\n\nFor example:\n\n- 3 boxes of 12 and 1 box of 9: 36 + 9 = 45\n\n- Or, maybe 1 box of 12, 3 boxes of 9: 12 + 27 = 39 (need 6 more)\n\nThat's not enough.\n\n- Or, 2 boxes of 12 and 2 boxes of 9: 24 + 18 = 42 (need 3 more)\n\nStill not enough.\n\n- Or, 4 boxes of 9: 36 cupcakes (need 9 more)\n\nThat would require a fifth box.\n\nSo, seems like the only combination that works with 4 boxes is 3 boxes of 12 and 1 box of 9.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of boxes needed is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
