        "content": "So the population of the town is increasing by 5% every year, and it's currently at 10,000. I need to find out what it will be in 3 years. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that a percentage increase means that each year, the population grows by 5% of what it was at the beginning of that year. So, for each year, I need to calculate 5% of the current population and add that to the population to get the new population for that year.\n\nLet me try to do this step by step for each year.\n\n**Year 1:**\n\nStart with 10,000 people.\n\nCalculate 5% of 10,000:\n\n5% of 10,000 = (5/100) * 10,000 = 0.05 * 10,000 = 500\n\nSo, the population increases by 500 people in the first year.\n\nNew population at the end of Year 1:\n\n10,000 + 500 = 10,500\n\n**Year 2:**\n\nNow, the population is 10,500 people.\n\nCalculate 5% of 10,500:\n\n5% of 10,500 = (5/100) * 10,500 = 0.05 * 10,500 = 525\n\nSo, the population increases by 525 people in the second year.\n\nNew population at the end of Year 2:\n\n10,500 + 525 = 11,025\n\n**Year 3:**\n\nNow, the population is 11,025 people.\n\nCalculate 5% of 11,025:\n\n5% of 11,025 = (5/100) * 11,025 = 0.05 * 11,025 = 551.25\n\nSo, the population increases by 551.25 people in the third year.\n\nNew population at the end of Year 3:\n\n11,025 + 551.25 = 11,576.25\n\nWait, but population can't be a fraction; you can't have 0.25 of a person. Probably, I should round this to the nearest whole number.\n\n11,576.25 rounds to 11,576 people.\n\nSo, the population in 3 years will be approximately 11,576 people.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard about using the formula for exponential growth: P = P0 * (1 + r)^t, where P is the future population, P0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is time in years.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nGiven:\n\nP0 = 10,000\n\nr = 5% = 0.05\n\nt = 3 years\n\nSo, P = 10,000 * (1 + 0.05)^3 = 10,000 * (1.05)^3\n\nCalculating 1.05 cubed:\n\n1.05^2 = 1.1025\n\n1.1025 * 1.05 = 1.157625\n\nSo, P = 10,000 * 1.157625 = 11,576.25\n\nAgain, I get 11,576.25, which rounds to 11,576.\n\nHmm, interesting. Both methods give me the same result.\n\nBut wait, I recall that in some cases, population growth might be modeled differently, maybe using compound interest or something similar. Is there another way to approach this?\n\nLet me think about compound interest, since population growth can be similar to interest accumulation.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is A = P*(1 + r/n)^(n*t), but in this case, since the interest is compounded annually, n=1.\n\nSo, it's similar to the exponential growth formula I used earlier.\n\nTherefore, I think the exponential growth formula is appropriate here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a simple interest approach, but I don't think that's correct for ongoing annual growth.\n\nLet me try the simple interest method to see the difference.\n\nUsing simple interest, the increase each year would be the same percentage of the original population, not the current population.\n\nSo, 5% of 10,000 is 500 people per year.\n\nOver 3 years, the total increase would be 500 * 3 = 1,500 people.\n\nNew population would be 10,000 + 1,500 = 11,500 people.\n\nBut this is different from the exponential growth method, which gave me 11,576.\n\nI think the exponential growth method is more accurate here because it accounts for the fact that each year's growth is 5% of the previous year's population, which includes the previous growth.\n\nSo, the population grows on top of its own growth each year, similar to compound interest.\n\nTherefore, the exponential growth formula is the way to go.\n\nLet me check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nMaybe using a multiplier.\n\nEach year, the population is multiplied by 1.05.\n\nSo, after 3 years, it's multiplied by 1.05 three times.\n\nSo, 10,000 * 1.05 * 1.05 * 1.05 = 10,000 * 1.157625 = 11,576.25\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I could make a table to see the population each year.\n\n**Year 0:** 10,000\n\n**Year 1:** 10,000 * 1.05 = 10,500\n\n**Year 2:** 10,500 * 1.05 = 11,025\n\n**Year 3:** 11,025 * 1.05 = 11,576.25\n\nSame result again.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem meant that the population increases by a flat 5% of the original population each year, rather than 5% of the current population, then the simple interest approach would be appropriate, giving 11,500.\n\nBut I think the standard interpretation is that it's 5% of the current population each year, leading to exponential growth.\n\nTherefore, the population in 3 years will be approximately 11,576 people.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"increases by 5% every year,\" which typically means compound growth.\n\nLet me see if there's any other factor to consider.\n\nIs the population increasing continuously, or is it discrete yearly increases?\n\nThe problem says \"every year,\" which suggests discrete yearly increases.\n\nTherefore, the exponential growth formula is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, if it were continuous growth, the formula would be P = P0 * e^(rt), but that's not the case here.\n\nSo, I'll stick with the exponential growth formula.\n\nTherefore, the population in 3 years will be approximately 11,576 people.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11576} \\]"
