        "content": "Let's see. The water tank has a total capacity of 12,000 liters. It takes 3 hours to fill it completely using a pipe that has a flow rate of 1,500 liters per hour. We need to find out how much water was already in the tank before filling started.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much water is added to the tank during those 3 hours. Since the flow rate is 1,500 liters per hour, and it runs for 3 hours, I can calculate the total water added by multiplying the flow rate by the time:\n\nWater added = flow rate \u00d7 time\n\nWater added = 1,500 liters/hour \u00d7 3 hours = 4,500 liters\n\nSo, 4,500 liters of water were added to the tank.\n\nNow, the tank's total capacity is 12,000 liters, and 4,500 liters were added to fill it completely. To find out how much water was already in the tank before filling started, I need to subtract the water added from the total capacity:\n\nInitial water in tank = total capacity - water added\n\nInitial water in tank = 12,000 liters - 4,500 liters = 7,500 liters\n\nTherefore, there were 7,500 liters of water already in the tank before filling started.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFlow rate is 1,500 liters per hour, and time is 3 hours. So, 1,500 \u00d7 3 = 4,500 liters added.\n\nTotal capacity is 12,000 liters. So, if 4,500 liters were added to fill it up, then initially there must have been 12,000 - 4,500 = 7,500 liters.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of rates. The pipe adds 1,500 liters each hour. Over 3 hours, that's 4,500 liters. So, if the tank was filled up to its full capacity of 12,000 liters by adding 4,500 liters, then it must have had 7,500 liters already.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the fraction of the tank that was filled initially. Since 4,500 liters were added to reach 12,000 liters, the initial amount was 7,500 liters, which is indeed 12,000 - 4,500.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. There were 7,500 liters of water in the tank before filling started.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7500} \\]"
