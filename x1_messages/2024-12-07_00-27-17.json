        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. So, you want a Python script that uses NumPy to generate a 10x10 matrix of random numbers between 0 and 100. Then, you need to calculate and print the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of these numbers.\n\nFirst, make sure you have NumPy installed. If not, you can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install numpy\n```\n\nAlso, for calculating the mode, you might need the SciPy library, so install that as well:\n\n```bash\npip install scipy\n```\n\nNow, here's the script that does what you're asking for:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import stats\n\n# Generate a 10x10 matrix of random numbers between 0 and 100\nmatrix = np.random.randint(0, 101, size=(10, 10))\n\n# Print the matrix\nprint(\"Matrix:\")\nprint(matrix)\n\n# Flatten the matrix to a 1D array for easier calculations\nflat_matrix = matrix.flatten()\n\n# Calculate mean\nmean = np.mean(flat_matrix)\nprint(\"\\nMean:\", mean)\n\n# Calculate median\nmedian = np.median(flat_matrix)\nprint(\"Median:\", median)\n\n# Calculate mode\nmode = stats.mode(flat_matrix)\nprint(\"Mode:\", mode.mode[0], \"with count\", mode.count[0])\n\n# Calculate standard deviation\nstd_dev = np.std(flat_matrix)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", std_dev)\n```\n\nLet me explain what each part does:\n\n1. **Generating the Matrix:**\n   - We use `np.random.randint(0, 101, size=(10, 10))` to generate a 10x10 matrix of random integers between 0 and 100 inclusive.\n\n2. **Printing the Matrix:**\n   - Simply use `print(matrix)` to display the matrix.\n\n3. **Flattening the Matrix:**\n   - We flatten the 2D matrix into a 1D array to make it easier to calculate statistics across all elements.\n\n4. **Calculating Statistics:**\n   - **Mean:** Use `np.mean()` on the flattened array.\n   - **Median:** Use `np.median()` on the flattened array.\n   - **Mode:** Use `stats.mode()` from the SciPy library, which returns both the mode and its count.\n   - **Standard Deviation:** Use `np.std()` on the flattened array.\n\nThis script should give you all the information you need about the generated matrix.
