        "content": "To solve the differential equation dy/dx = xy with the initial condition y(0) = 1, we can use the method of separation of variables. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Separate the variables:** We start by rewriting the equation so that all terms involving y are on one side and all terms involving x are on the other side.\n\n   Given: dy/dx = xy\n\n   We can rewrite this as: dy/y = x dx\n\n2. **Integrate both sides:** Now, we integrate both sides of the equation.\n\n   \u222b(1/y) dy = \u222bx dx\n\n   The left side integrates to ln|y| + C\u2081, and the right side integrates to (1/2)x\u00b2 + C\u2082, where C\u2081 and C\u2082 are constants of integration.\n\n3. **Combine the constants:** We can combine the constants of integration into a single constant.\n\n   ln|y| = (1/2)x\u00b2 + C\n\n   where C = C\u2082 - C\u2081.\n\n4. **Solve for y:** To solve for y, we exponentiate both sides to eliminate the natural logarithm.\n\n   e^(ln|y|) = e^((1/2)x\u00b2 + C)\n\n   This simplifies to:\n\n   |y| = e^((1/2)x\u00b2) * e^C\n\n   Since e^C is just a positive constant, we can denote it as another constant, say C.\n\n   Therefore, y = C e^((1/2)x\u00b2)\n\n   Note that the absolute value is handled by allowing C to be positive or negative.\n\n5. **Apply the initial condition:** We are given that y(0) = 1. We substitute x = 0 and y = 1 into the equation to find C.\n\n   1 = C e^((1/2)(0)\u00b2)\n\n   1 = C e^(0)\n\n   1 = C * 1\n\n   Therefore, C = 1.\n\n6. **Write the final solution:** Substituting C back into the equation, we get:\n\n   y = e^((1/2)x\u00b2)\n\nSo, the solution to the differential equation dy/dx = xy with the initial condition y(0) = 1 is y = e^((1/2)x\u00b2)."
