        "content": "So I have this problem here. There's a rectangle that's 10 inches long and 6 inches wide. I need to cut out a square with sides of 2 inches from each corner of this rectangle. Then, I have to find out what the area of the remaining shape is after I've done that.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize what's going on here. I have a rectangle, right? Length 10 inches, width 6 inches. So, it's longer than it is wide. Now, from each corner, I'm supposed to cut out a square that's 2 inches on each side.\n\nAlright, so if I imagine this, I have four corners on the rectangle, and from each corner, I'm removing a 2-inch square. That means I'm taking away four squares in total, each with an area of 2 inches by 2 inches.\n\nFirst, I can calculate the total area of the original rectangle. The area of a rectangle is length times width, so that would be 10 inches times 6 inches, which is 60 square inches.\n\nNext, I need to find out the total area of the squares I'm cutting out. Each square is 2 inches by 2 inches, so each one has an area of 4 square inches. Since I'm cutting out four of these squares, the total area removed would be 4 squares times 4 square inches each, which is 16 square inches.\n\nNow, to find the area of the remaining shape, I can subtract the total area removed from the original area of the rectangle. So, that's 60 square inches minus 16 square inches, which gives me 44 square inches.\n\nWait a minute, is that all there is to it? It seems pretty straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, after cutting out the squares from each corner, the remaining shape would be like a rectangle with its corners cut off. In fact, if you imagine folding down the flaps or something, it might form a different shape, but in this case, I'm just supposed to find the area of what's left.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that when I remove each square, I'm removing 4 square inches from each corner. Since there are four corners, that's 16 square inches total, just like I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, again, subtracting 16 square inches from the original 60 square inches gives me 44 square inches.\n\nHmm, maybe I can approach it differently to confirm. Let's see.\n\nIf I were to cut out the squares and then rearrange the pieces, perhaps I can visualize the remaining shape as a larger figure with the squares removed.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the remaining shape as a larger rectangle with four smaller rectangles attached, but that might be more complicated than necessary.\n\nWait, actually, after removing the squares from each corner, the remaining shape would have new dimensions. Let's try to calculate the dimensions of the remaining central part.\n\nThe original length is 10 inches. From each end, I'm cutting out 2 inches, so the remaining central length would be 10 inches minus 2 inches from one end and 2 inches from the other end, which is 10 - 2 - 2 = 6 inches.\n\nSimilarly, the original width is 6 inches. Cutting out 2 inches from each side, the remaining central width would be 6 - 2 - 2 = 2 inches.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If I have a width of 6 inches and I cut out 2 inches from each side, that would leave 2 inches in the middle. But that seems too small.\n\nBut then, if I consider the central part, it should be a rectangle with the length and width reduced by twice the square's side length because I'm cutting from both sides.\n\nSo, original length: 10 inches, cut 2 inches from each end, so 10 - 4 = 6 inches.\n\nOriginal width: 6 inches, cut 2 inches from each side, so 6 - 4 = 2 inches.\n\nSo, the central rectangle would be 6 inches by 2 inches, which has an area of 12 square inches.\n\nBut wait, that's less than the 44 square inches I calculated earlier. That doesn't make sense. There must be something wrong with this approach.\n\nAh, I see the mistake. When you cut out squares from each corner, you're not just leaving a small central rectangle; you're also leaving flaps or extensions along the sides.\n\nLet me try to sketch this mentally.\n\nOriginal rectangle: 10 inches by 6 inches.\n\nCut out a 2-inch square from each corner.\n\nSo, from each corner, a 2-inch by 2-inch square is removed.\n\nNow, if I imagine folding the sides, it would form something like a net of a box, but here, I'm just removing the squares and want to find the area of what's left.\n\nSo, total area removed is indeed 4 squares of 2x2=4 square inches each, so 16 square inches total.\n\nOriginal area is 10x6=60 square inches.\n\nRemaining area is 60 - 16 = 44 square inches.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried to calculate the dimensions of the remaining shape, I got confused.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nIf I cut out squares from each corner, the remaining shape is like a cross, with a central rectangle and four rectangles extending from it where the corners were cut out.\n\nWait, no. Actually, after cutting out the squares from each corner, the remaining shape would have four sides with rectangular flaps.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the perimeter or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the area of the remaining shape by considering the new shape formed after removing the squares.\n\nLet me try this:\n\nAfter removing the four squares, the remaining shape is a larger rectangle with its corners cut out. But perhaps I can think of it as a rectangle with dimensions reduced by the amount cut from each side.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the length and width are each reduced by twice the side of the square being cut out, but that's similar to what I did earlier.\n\nOriginal length: 10 inches.\n\nCut out 2 inches from both ends, so new length is 10 - 2*2 = 6 inches.\n\nOriginal width: 6 inches.\n\nCut out 2 inches from both sides, so new width is 6 - 2*2 = 2 inches.\n\nBut then, the area would be 6*2=12 square inches, which contradicts the earlier calculation of 60-16=44 square inches.\n\nSo, there's clearly a mistake in this approach.\n\nLet me try to visualize this again.\n\nI have a rectangle that's 10 inches long and 6 inches wide.\n\nI cut out a 2-inch square from each corner.\n\nSo, from each corner, a 2-inch by 2-inch piece is removed.\n\nNow, if I consider the total area removed, it's 4 squares each of 4 square inches, so 16 square inches.\n\nSubtracting that from the original 60 square inches gives 44 square inches.\n\nBut according to the other approach, the remaining central rectangle should be 6 inches by 2 inches, which is 12 square inches.\n\nBut 12 is not equal to 44, so something's not right.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the remaining shape isn't just the central rectangle; there are also the flaps or the parts that are not cut out.\n\nWait, no. When you cut out the squares from each corner, the central part that's left is a smaller rectangle, and then there are the parts along the sides that aren't cut out.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nMaybe I should draw a diagram.\n\nLet's say I have a rectangle 10 inches by 6 inches.\n\nLet's label the corners as A, B, C, and D.\n\nAt each corner, I'm cutting out a 2-inch square.\n\nSo, from corner A, I remove a 2-inch square, same for B, C, and D.\n\nNow, the remaining shape is the original rectangle minus these four squares.\n\nSo, the area should indeed be the original area minus the area of the four squares.\n\nThat is, 10*6 - 4*(2*2) = 60 - 16 = 44 square inches.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried to calculate the dimensions of the remaining central part, I got 6 inches by 2 inches, which is 12 square inches.\n\nSo, where is the discrepancy?\n\nAh, I think I see the problem.\n\nWhen I cut out the squares from each corner, the remaining shape isn't just the central rectangle; there are also the rectangular parts along the sides.\n\nSo, the central rectangle is 6 inches by 2 inches, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut additionally, there are four rectangles along the sides.\n\nLet's see:\n\nOriginal length is 10 inches.\n\nCut out 2 inches from each end, so the central part is 6 inches.\n\nSimilarly, original width is 6 inches.\n\nCut out 2 inches from each side, so the central part is 2 inches.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the overall shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that after cutting out the squares, the remaining shape can be rearranged into a different shape with the same area.\n\nBut that seems unnecessarily complicated.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose I consider the rectangle divided into smaller rectangles after cutting out the squares.\n\nAfter removing the four squares, the remaining shape consists of:\n\n- The central rectangle: (10 - 2*2) inches by (6 - 2*2) inches = 6 inches by 2 inches.\n\n- Four rectangular flaps: two along the length and two along the width.\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, when you cut out the squares from the corners, you're removing only the corners, and the remaining shape is like a cross or a plus sign.\n\nSo, the central part is indeed 6 inches by 2 inches.\n\nAdditionally, there are four rectangles that were not cut out: two rectangles of 6 inches by 2 inches (along the length) and two rectangles of 2 inches by 6 inches (along the width), but that doesn't make sense because the cuts are only at the corners.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the remaining shape as the original area minus the four cut-out squares.\n\nSo, area remaining = original area - area of four squares.\n\nThat is, 10*6 - 4*(2*2) = 60 - 16 = 44 square inches.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but why did my earlier approach give a different answer?\n\nAh, I think I see.\n\nWhen I considered the central rectangle as 6 inches by 2 inches, that's only the very center part.\n\nBut in reality, after cutting out the squares from the corners, the remaining shape includes that central rectangle plus the rectangular strips along the sides.\n\nSo, the central rectangle is 6 inches by 2 inches.\n\nThen, there are two rectangular strips along the length: each is 6 inches long (the central length) by 2 inches wide (since 6 - 2 - 2 = 2 inches).\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, the original width is 6 inches.\n\nAfter cutting out 2 inches from each side, the central width is 2 inches.\n\nSo, the central rectangle is 6 inches by 2 inches.\n\nAdditionally, along the length, there are two rectangles that are 10 - 2 - 2 = 6 inches long and 2 inches wide (the parts that were not cut out from the sides).\n\nBut wait, that sounds similar to what I just calculated.\n\nSo, total area would be:\n\n- Central rectangle: 6 inches * 2 inches = 12 square inches.\n\n- Two rectangles along the length: each is 6 inches * 2 inches = 12 square inches each.\n\n- Two rectangles along the width: each is 2 inches * 2 inches = 4 square inches each.\n\nWait, but this seems off because 12 + 12 + 4 + 4 = 32 square inches, which is still not matching the earlier calculation of 44 square inches.\n\nSo, there's inconsistency here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the remaining shape consists of the central rectangle plus the four rectangular flaps.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to visualize it differently.\n\nLet me try to divide the original rectangle into parts.\n\nOriginal rectangle: 10 inches by 6 inches.\n\nCut out four squares of 2 inches by 2 inches from each corner.\n\nSo, the remaining shape is like a cross.\n\nThe central part is 6 inches by 2 inches.\n\nThen, there are four rectangular flaps:\n\n- Two along the length: each is 6 inches (central length) by 2 inches.\n\n- Two along the width: each is 2 inches (central width) by 2 inches.\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, after cutting out the squares from the corners, the remaining shape consists of the central rectangle plus four rectangles that are each 2 inches in width.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate the area of the remaining shape by considering the areas that are not removed.\n\nSo, original area: 10*6 = 60 square inches.\n\nArea removed: 4*(2*2) = 16 square inches.\n\nTherefore, remaining area: 60 - 16 = 44 square inches.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nBut why is my earlier approach giving a different answer?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm double-counting or something.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose I consider the remaining shape after cutting out the squares.\n\nIt would have a length of 10 inches minus the two 2-inch cuts, so 10 - 4 = 6 inches.\n\nSimilarly, width of 6 inches minus the two 2-inch cuts, so 6 - 4 = 2 inches.\n\nBut that only accounts for the central rectangle, which is 6 inches by 2 inches, or 12 square inches.\n\nHowever, the total remaining area should be 44 square inches, as per the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, there must be more to it.\n\nAh, I see the confusion now.\n\nWhen you cut out the squares from each corner, you're not just removing those squares; the remaining shape includes the central rectangle plus the areas along the sides that are not cut out.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you cut out the squares from each corner, you're only removing those four squares, and the rest of the area remains.\n\nSo, the total remaining area should indeed be the original area minus the area of the four squares, which is 60 - 16 = 44 square inches.\n\nThe confusion arises when I try to think of the remaining shape as consisting of the central rectangle plus additional parts, but in reality, the central rectangle calculation (6 inches by 2 inches) only accounts for part of the remaining area.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to calculate the area of the central rectangle and the areas along the sides correctly.\n\nSo, the central rectangle is 6 inches by 2 inches, which is 12 square inches.\n\nThen, along the length, there are two rectangles: each is 6 inches (length) by 2 inches (width), but wait, that's the same as the central rectangle.\n\nNo, actually, after cutting out the squares, along each of the longer sides, there are rectangles that are 6 inches long (the central length) and 2 inches high (since 6 - 2 - 2 = 2 inches).\n\nSimilarly, along the shorter sides, there are rectangles that are 2 inches long and 2 inches high.\n\nBut this seems confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the remaining shape is like a rectangle with its corners cut out, and calculate the area accordingly.\n\nBut the simplest and most straightforward way is to calculate the original area minus the area of the four squares removed.\n\nThat gives 60 - 16 = 44 square inches.\n\nTherefore, the area of the remaining shape is 44 square inches.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nEarlier confusion arose from trying to calculate the area by considering the dimensions of the remaining central part, but that approach is more complicated and prone to error in this case.\n\nSo, the best way is to subtract the area removed from the original area.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{44} \\]"
