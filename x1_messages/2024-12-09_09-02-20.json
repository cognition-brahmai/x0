        "content": "Let's see. I have this recursive sequence defined by a(1) = 3, and for n > 1, a(n) = 2*a(n-1) + 1. I need to find out what a(5) is.\n\nOkay, so recursive sequences work by defining each term based on the previous ones. Here, each term a(n) is twice the previous term a(n-1) plus one. Starting with a(1) = 3, I can calculate each term step by step up to a(5).\n\nLet me start by finding a(2). According to the formula, a(2) = 2*a(1) + 1. Since a(1) is 3, that would be 2*3 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7. So, a(2) = 7.\n\nNext, a(3) = 2*a(2) + 1. I just found that a(2) is 7, so 2*7 + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15. Therefore, a(3) = 15.\n\nNow, a(4) = 2*a(3) + 1. With a(3) being 15, that's 2*15 + 1 = 30 + 1 = 31. So, a(4) = 31.\n\nFinally, a(5) = 2*a(4) + 1. Since a(4) is 31, then 2*31 + 1 = 62 + 1 = 63. Therefore, a(5) = 63.\n\nLet me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from a(1) = 3:\n\n- a(2) = 2*3 + 1 = 7\n\n- a(3) = 2*7 + 1 = 15\n\n- a(4) = 2*15 + 1 = 31\n\n- a(5) = 2*31 + 1 = 63\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the value of a(5) is 63.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{63} \\]"
