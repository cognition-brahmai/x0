        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a pizza place offers 10 toppings, and I need to figure out how many different pizzas I can order if I must choose at least one topping but no more than four. And I'm supposed to use combinatorics to explain it. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, combinatorics is all about counting, right? Specifically, it helps us figure out how many ways there are to choose or arrange things without having to list them all out. In this case, we're choosing toppings for a pizza, and there are restrictions on how many toppings we can pick.\n\nSo, the pizza place has 10 different toppings to choose from, and I have to pick at least one but no more than four. That means I can choose 1 topping, or 2 toppings, or 3 toppings, or 4 toppings. I can't have a pizza with no toppings, and I can't have more than four toppings.\n\nNow, in combinatorics, when we're choosing items from a set without regard to the order, we use combinations. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items to choose from, and k is the number of items we're choosing.\n\nIn this scenario, n is 10 (the total number of toppings), and k can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since we're choosing at least one and no more than four toppings).\n\nSo, to find the total number of different pizzas I can order, I need to calculate the sum of the combinations for each possible k.\n\nThat is, total pizzas = C(10,1) + C(10,2) + C(10,3) + C(10,4).\n\nLet's calculate each of these step by step.\n\nFirst, C(10,1):\n\nC(10,1) = 10! / (1!(10 - 1)!) = 10! / (1! * 9!) = (10 * 9!) / (1 * 9!) = 10.\n\nSo, there are 10 different pizzas with exactly one topping.\n\nNext, C(10,2):\n\nC(10,2) = 10! / (2!(10 - 2)!) = 10! / (2! * 8!) = (10 * 9 * 8!) / (2 * 1 * 8!)= (10 * 9) / 2 = 45.\n\nSo, there are 45 different pizzas with exactly two toppings.\n\nNow, C(10,3):\n\nC(10,3) = 10! / (3!(10 - 3)!) = 10! / (3! * 7!) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7!) / (6 * 7!)= (10 * 9 * 8) / 6 = (720) / 6 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nActually, 10 * 9 * 8 = 720, and 3! is 6, so 720 / 6 = 120. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, there are 120 different pizzas with exactly three toppings.\n\nFinally, C(10,4):\n\nC(10,4) = 10! / (4!(10 - 4)!) = 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6!) / (24 * 6!)= (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / 24.\n\nLet's calculate the numerator: 10 * 9 = 90, 90 * 8 = 720, 720 * 7 = 5040.\n\nNow, divide by 24: 5040 / 24 = 210.\n\nSo, there are 210 different pizzas with exactly four toppings.\n\nNow, to find the total number of different pizzas I can order, I add up all these combinations:\n\nTotal pizzas = 10 + 45 + 120 + 210 = 385.\n\nWait, let's double-check that addition.\n\n10 + 45 = 55.\n\n55 + 120 = 175.\n\n175 + 210 = 385.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, there are 385 different pizzas that can be ordered with at least one and no more than four toppings.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, I should consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the total number of possible pizzas, including the option with no toppings and those with more than four toppings, and then subtract the ones that don't meet our criteria.\n\nSo, the total number of possible pizzas, including the option with no toppings, is 2^10, since each topping can either be included or not included.\n\n2^10 = 1024.\n\nNow, if we subtract the pizzas with no toppings and those with more than four toppings, we should get the same result as before.\n\nFirst, the number of pizzas with no toppings is C(10,0) = 1.\n\nNext, the number of pizzas with more than four toppings is the sum of C(10,5) through C(10,10).\n\nSo, let's calculate C(10,5):\n\nC(10,5) = 10! / (5! * 5!) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (120) = (30240) / 120 = 252.\n\nC(10,6) = C(10,4) = 210 (since C(n,k) = C(n,n-k)).\n\nC(10,7) = C(10,3) = 120.\n\nC(10,8) = C(10,2) = 45.\n\nC(10,9) = C(10,1) = 10.\n\nC(10,10) = C(10,0) = 1.\n\nSo, the total number of pizzas with more than four toppings is 252 + 210 + 120 + 45 + 10 + 1 = 638.\n\nNow, subtracting the pizzas with no toppings and those with more than four toppings from the total:\n\n1024 - 1 - 638 = 1024 - 639 = 385.\n\nOkay, this matches the earlier result, which is a good sanity check.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of binomial coefficients.\n\nThe sum of C(10,k) from k=0 to k=10 is 2^10 = 1024.\n\nThe sum from k=0 to k=4 is C(10,0) + C(10,1) + C(10,2) + C(10,3) + C(10,4) = 1 + 10 + 45 + 120 + 210 = 386.\n\nWait, that doesn't match. Wait, earlier I calculated C(10,1) to C(10,4) as 10 + 45 + 120 + 210 = 385, and C(10,0) is 1, so sum from k=0 to k=4 should be 385 + 1 = 386.\n\nBut earlier, when I did 1024 - 1 - 638, I got 385.\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, let's recount.\n\nTotal pizzas: 2^10 = 1024.\n\nPizzas with no toppings: C(10,0) = 1.\n\nPizzas with more than four toppings: C(10,5) to C(10,10) = 252 + 210 + 120 + 45 + 10 + 1 = 638.\n\nSo, 1024 - 1 - 638 = 1024 - 639 = 385.\n\nBut sum from k=1 to k=4 is 10 + 45 + 120 + 210 = 385.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought sum from k=0 to k=4 is 386, which is correct, but since we're excluding the no-topping pizza, it should be sum from k=1 to k=4, which is 385.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that there are 385 different pizzas with at least one and no more than four toppings.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the concept of combinations with restrictions.\n\nIn this case, the restriction is that we can choose from 1 to 4 toppings, which is exactly what we've done.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about it in terms of binary choices, each topping can be either chosen or not chosen, but with the constraint on the number of toppings.\n\nBut the combinatorial approach is straightforward and appropriate here.\n\nSo, in conclusion, using combinatorics, specifically the combination formula C(n,k), and summing up the combinations for k=1 to k=4 with n=10, we find that there are 385 different pizzas that can be ordered with at least one and no more than four toppings.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{385} \\]"
