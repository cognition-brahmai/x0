        "content": "Okay, so I've got this system of equations to solve: y = 2x + 1 and y = -x + 5. I need to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations at the same time. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since both equations are already solved for y, that makes things a bit easier. I can set them equal to each other because if both equal y, then they must equal each other. So, 2x + 1 = -x + 5. Now, I just need to solve for x.\n\nLet me subtract 1 from both sides: 2x = -x + 4.\n\nNext, I'll add x to both sides to get all the x terms on one side: 2x + x = 4, so 3x = 4.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3: x = 4/3.\n\nOkay, so x is 4/3. Now, I need to find y. I can plug x = 4/3 into either of the original equations. I'll pick the first one: y = 2x + 1.\n\nSo, y = 2*(4/3) + 1 = 8/3 + 1.\n\nWait, 1 is the same as 3/3, so y = 8/3 + 3/3 = 11/3.\n\nSo, the solution should be x = 4/3 and y = 11/3.\n\nLet me check if this works in the second equation: y = -x + 5.\n\nPlug in x = 4/3: y = -(4/3) + 5 = -4/3 + 15/3 = 11/3.\n\nYes, y comes out to be 11/3 again. So, both equations give me the same y value when x is 4/3. That means my solution is correct.\n\nI think that's it. The solution to the system is x = 4/3 and y = 11/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left( \\frac{4}{3}, \\frac{11}{3} \\right)} \\]"
