        "content": "Let's see. There are 6 children in the family: 3 boys and 3 girls. Each child has exactly one brother named John, and we need to find out how many Johns are in the family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the statement \"each child has exactly one brother named John.\" This means that for every child in the family, there is precisely one brother who is named John.\n\nLet's consider the children in the family:\n\n- There are 3 boys and 3 girls.\n\n- So, the boys are John, and possibly others, but according to the statement, each child has exactly one brother named John.\n\nWait a minute, in a family, brothers share the same parents, so all the boys are brothers to each other.\n\nBut according to the statement, each child has exactly one brother named John.\n\nLet's think about it from a girl's perspective first:\n\n- Each girl has 3 brothers (since there are 3 boys in the family).\n\n- But according to the statement, each child has exactly one brother named John.\n\n- So, each girl has only one brother named John.\n\n- This implies that only one of the three boys is named John.\n\nNow, let's think about the boys:\n\n- Each boy has two brothers (since there are three boys in total).\n\n- According to the statement, each child has exactly one brother named John.\n\n- So, each boy should have only one brother named John.\n\n- If only one of the boys is named John, then each boy would have one brother named John and another brother with a different name.\n\nWait, but if there is only one John, then each boy would have only one brother named John, which matches the statement.\n\nSimilarly, each girl would have only one brother named John, which also matches the statement.\n\nTherefore, there is only one John in the family.\n\nBut let's double-check this.\n\nSuppose there are two Johns in the family.\n\n- Then, each girl would have two brothers named John, which contradicts the statement that each child has exactly one brother named John.\n\n- Similarly, each boy would have at least one brother named John, but if there are two Johns, some boys might have more than one brother named John, which again contradicts the statement.\n\nTherefore, having more than one John would violate the condition that each child has exactly one brother named John.\n\nSimilarly, if there is only one John, then each child has exactly one brother named John, which satisfies the condition.\n\nHence, there is only one John in the family.\n\nWait, but the question says \"each child has exactly one brother named John,\" and we need to find out how many Johns are in the family.\n\nFrom the above reasoning, it seems that there is only one John.\n\nBut let's consider another angle.\n\nSuppose John is one of the boys.\n\n- Each girl has three brothers, but only one is John.\n\n- Each boy has two brothers, one of whom is John.\n\nThis matches the condition that each child has exactly one brother named John.\n\nNow, if there were two Johns, then each girl would have two brothers named John, which doesn't satisfy the \"exactly one\" condition.\n\nSimilarly, if there were no Johns, then each child would have zero brothers named John, which again doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nTherefore, there must be exactly one John in the family.\n\nSo, the answer is that there is only one John in the family.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
