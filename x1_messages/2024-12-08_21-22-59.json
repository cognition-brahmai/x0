        "content": "So the train is moving at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, and it takes 30 minutes to go between two stations. I need to find out how far apart these stations are.\n\nFirst, I should remember the basic formula for distance, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nSo, I have the speed, which is 60 miles per hour, and the time, which is 30 minutes. But I need to make sure that the units for time and speed match. Since speed is in miles per hour, time should be in hours.\n\nNow, 30 minutes is half an hour, so I can convert that to hours:\n\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes} = 0.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, plugging into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 60 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nMultiplying that gives:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 30 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nLet me think about the units again. Speed is in miles per hour, and time is in hours, so multiplying them should indeed give miles. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of proportions. If the train travels 60 miles in one hour, then in half an hour, it would travel half of that distance, which is 30 miles. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using conversion factors or something like that.\n\nWell, I know that 60 miles per hour is the same as 1 mile per minute, because there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, if it's traveling at 1 mile per minute, and it takes 30 minutes, then the distance would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 1 \\text{ mile per minute} \\times 30 \\text{ minutes} = 30 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nAgain, I get 30 miles.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for speed:\n\n\\[ \\text{speed} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} \\]\n\nAnd rearrange it to solve for distance:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nWhich is where I started.\n\nI think no matter how I look at it, the answer is 30 miles.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the distance, like acceleration or something. The problem says the train is traveling at a constant speed, so no acceleration, which means my straightforward calculation should be correct.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. I converted minutes to hours, which they are, so that's fine.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the time includes stopping time at the stations or not, but the problem doesn't mention any stopping time, so I assume that the 30 minutes is solely for traveling between the stations.\n\nSo, I think 30 miles is the correct answer.\n\nJust for extra confidence, I'll look up a similar problem to see if my approach is right.\n\n[Looks up a similar problem online]\n\nI found a similar example where a car travels at 50 miles per hour for 2 hours, and the distance is calculated as 100 miles. That makes sense. In another example, a runner runs at 8 miles per hour for 15 minutes, which is 0.25 hours, and the distance is 2 miles. Again, that matches the formula.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to this problem, 60 miles per hour times 0.5 hours equals 30 miles.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
