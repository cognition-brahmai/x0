        "content": "This is an interesting riddle! Let's see, you have cities but no houses, mountains but no trees, and rivers but no water. Hmm, it sounds like something that represents geographical features without the actual physical elements.\n\nMaybe it's a map? A map has representations of cities, mountains, and rivers, but not the actual houses, trees, or water. That could make sense. Or perhaps it's a globe, but globes typically show continents and oceans, not necessarily cities and mountains in detail.\n\nWait, but maps come in different types\u2014some might show more detail than others. Maybe it's a topographic map that shows mountains and rivers, but again, it's just representations.\n\nAnother thought: could it be a digital map or a virtual map in a computer or a video game? Those can have cities, mountains, and rivers without the physical elements.\n\nBut the riddle doesn't specify anything about digital or virtual, so maybe it's something more general.\n\nLet me think differently. If it has cities, mountains, and rivers, but none of the actual contents like houses, trees, or water, perhaps it's a model or a miniature landscape.\n\nBut models or miniatures do have small versions of houses, trees, and water, even if they're not real. So that might not fit perfectly.\n\nWait, what about a photograph? A photograph can capture cities, mountains, and rivers, but it doesn't contain the actual houses, trees, or water\u2014it's just a picture.\n\nThat seems promising. Alternatively, it could be a painting or a drawing that depicts these landscapes without containing the actual elements.\n\nBut then again, maps are also a kind of drawing or representation, so maybe that's still the best answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's another angle to this. Maybe it's a concept or an idea\u2014like the layout of a city or a region, but not the physical place itself.\n\nBut that seems a bit abstract. Perhaps it's a puzzle or a board game that has representations of these features.\n\nBoard games often have maps with cities, mountains, and rivers, but again, it ties back to the idea of a map.\n\nI think the most straightforward answer is a map. It fits all the criteria: it has cities (but not houses), mountains (but not trees), and rivers (but not water).\n\nUnless there's a more creative or less obvious answer that I'm missing.\n\nLet me check if there's any play on words here. The word \"have\" could be interpreted differently, but in this context, it seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a atlas, which is a collection of maps.\n\nBut an atlas still consists of maps, so it's similar to the map answer.\n\nPerhaps the answer is simply \"a map.\"\n\nI'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{a map}} \\]"
