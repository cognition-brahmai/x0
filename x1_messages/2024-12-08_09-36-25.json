        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of 6 friends who ordered food worth $85.80, and they forgot to include the 8% tax in their calculation. They want to split the total bill evenly among themselves. So, we need to find out how much each person should pay, including the tax.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total bill including tax. The food costs $85.80, and there's an 8% tax on that amount. To find the tax amount, we can calculate 8% of $85.80.\n\nTax amount = 8% of $85.80\n            = (8/100) * 85.80\n            = 0.08 * 85.80\n            = $6.864\n\nNow, let's add this tax amount to the original food cost to get the total bill.\n\nTotal bill = food cost + tax amount\n           = $85.80 + $6.864\n           = $92.664\n\nSince we're dealing with money, it's standard to round to two decimal places. So, $92.664 rounds to $92.66.\n\nNow, this total bill needs to be split evenly among 6 people.\n\nAmount per person = total bill / number of people\n                  = $92.66 / 6\n                  = $15.44333...\n\nAgain, rounding to two decimal places, each person should pay $15.44.\n\nWait a minute, but if we multiply $15.44 by 6, we get $92.64, which is 2 cents less than the total bill of $92.66. This is a common issue when splitting bills evenly due to rounding.\n\nTo handle this, one approach is to have two people pay a little extra to cover the difference. So, if the total is $92.66 and 6 people pay $15.44 each, that's $92.64, which is 2 cents short.\n\nSo, we can have two people pay an extra penny each, making their payment $15.45, and the other four pay $15.44.\n\nLet's verify this:\n\n- Four people pay $15.44: 4 * 15.44 = $61.76\n- Two people pay $15.45: 2 * 15.45 = $30.90\n- Total: $61.76 + $30.90 = $92.66\n\nPerfect, that adds up correctly.\n\nAlternatively, one person could pay $15.45 and another pay $15.46, but that might be more complicated.\n\nSo, in conclusion, each person should pay either $15.44, $15.45, or $15.46, with the majority paying $15.44, and a couple paying a little more to cover the total.\n\nBut if we're to provide a single amount that each person should pay, considering the rounding, it's acceptable to say approximately $15.44, acknowledging that some adjustment might be needed to cover the total bill precisely.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15.44} \\]"
