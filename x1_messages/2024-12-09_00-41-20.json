        "content": "In developmental biology, the process by which a less specialized cell becomes a more specialized cell type is called differentiation. So, the correct answer is C. Differentiation.\n\nTo elaborate, differentiation is a critical process in the development of multicellular organisms. It involves cells becoming specialized in structure and function, which allows different parts of the organism to perform specific tasks. For example, in humans, stem cells can differentiate into various cell types such as muscle cells, nerve cells, or blood cells, each with its own unique characteristics and functions.\n\nMitosis, option A, is the process of cell division that results in two daughter cells each having the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. It's essential for growth and repair in organisms.\n\nMeiosis, option B, is a type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, creating gametes (sperm and egg cells) in sexually reproducing organisms.\n\nTranscription, option D, is the process of creating RNA from a DNA template, which is the first step in gene expression leading to protein synthesis.\n\nSo, among these options, differentiation is the process that leads to cell specialization."
