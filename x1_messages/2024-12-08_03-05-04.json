I have some tools at my disposal: DuckDuckGo for searching, URLParser for extracting URLs, SiteReader for reading site contents, and AIQA for answering questions based on the context. I need to plan this step by step.\n\n**Step 1:** First, I need to find the current population of New York City. I can use DuckDuckGo to search for \"New York City population.\"\n\n*Action:*\n\nEvidence1 = DuckDuckGo[\"New York City population\"]\n\n**Step 2:** Once I have the search results, I need to parse the URLs from these results to look for reliable sources like the official New York City website or reputable news sites.\n\n*Action:*\n\nEvidence2 = URLParser[Evidence1]\n\n**Step 3:** I should read the contents of these URLs to gather information about the population.\n\n*Action:*\n\nEvidence3 = SiteReader[Evidence2]\n\n**Step 4:** With the text from these sites, I can use AIQA to extract the population figure.\n\n*Action:*\n\nEvidence4 = AIQA[\"What is the current population of New York City?\", Evidence3]\n\n**Step 5:** Now, for the major tourist attractions in New York City, I can again use DuckDuckGo to search for \"major tourist attractions in New York City.\"\n\n*Action:*\n\nEvidence5 = DuckDuckGo[\"major tourist attractions in New York City\"]\n\n**Step 6:** Parse the URLs from these search results.\n\n*Action:*\n\nEvidence6 = URLParser[Evidence5]\n\n**Step 7:** Read the contents of these URLs.\n\n*Action:*\n\nEvidence7 = SiteReader[Evidence6]\n\n**Step 8:** Use AIQA to identify and list the major tourist attractions from the gathered text.\n\n*Action:*\n\nEvidence8 = AIQA[\"What are the major tourist attractions in New York City?\", Evidence7]\n\n**Step 9:** Finally, compile the information from Evidence4 and Evidence8 to present the population and the list of major tourist attractions.\n\n*Action:*\n\nAnswer: \"The current population of New York City is \" + Evidence4 + \", and its major tourist attractions include \" + Evidence8 + \".\"\n\n**Justification:**\n\nThis step-by-step approach ensures that I am gathering information from reliable sources and using tools effectively to extract the required data. By separating the tasks into searching, parsing, reading, and questioning, I can manage the process efficiently and accurately."
