        "content": "So I need to find the area of a trapezoid, and I have the lengths of the two bases and the height. The bases are 8 cm and 12 cm, and the height is 5 cm. I remember there's a formula for the area of a trapezoid, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, what is a trapezoid? It's a four-sided shape with at least one pair of parallel sides. These parallel sides are called the bases. The other two sides are called the legs. The distance between the two bases is called the height.\n\nThe formula for the area of a trapezoid is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (b_1 + b_2) \\times h\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( b_1 \\) and \\( b_2 \\) are the lengths of the two bases, and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\nSo, in this case, \\( b_1 = 8 \\) cm, \\( b_2 = 12 \\) cm, and \\( h = 5 \\) cm.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (8 + 12) \\times 5\n\\]\n\nFirst, add the lengths of the bases:\n\n\\[\n8 + 12 = 20\n\\]\n\nThen, multiply by the height:\n\n\\[\n20 \\times 5 = 100\n\\]\n\nFinally, multiply by half:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 100 = 50\n\\]\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 50 square centimeters.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I recall that the formula averages the lengths of the bases and then multiplies by the height. That's what the \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times (b_1 + b_2) \\) part does\u2014it finds the average of the bases and then multiplies by the height to get the area.\n\nLet me verify the calculation again:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (8 + 12) \\times 5 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 \\times 5 = 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the trapezoid as a combination of a rectangle and a triangle. If I imagine the trapezoid with the longer base of 12 cm, I can visualize a rectangle with width 8 cm and height 5 cm, and a triangle with base (12 - 8) = 4 cm and height 5 cm. Then, the area would be the sum of the rectangle's area and the triangle's area.\n\nFirst, the rectangle's area:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{rectangle}} = 8 \\times 5 = 40 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\nNext, the triangle's area:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times 5 = 10 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\nAdding them together:\n\n\\[\n40 + 10 = 50 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation, so I'm confident that 50 square centimeters is the correct area of the trapezoid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
