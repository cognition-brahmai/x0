        "content": "So there are 100 houses in this town. Every third house has a red door, and every fifth house has a blue door. I need to find out how many houses have both red and blue doors.\n\nHmm, so if a house has both a red and a blue door, that means it's one of the houses that is both every third house and every fifth house. So, it's the houses that are multiples of both 3 and 5.\n\nI remember that when you have two numbers and you want to find the numbers that are multiples of both, you need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of those two numbers. The LCM of 3 and 5 should be 15, right? Because 3 and 5 are both prime numbers, so their LCM is just their product.\n\nSo, every 15th house has both a red and a blue door. Now, I need to find out how many houses out of 100 are multiples of 15.\n\nTo do that, I can divide 100 by 15 and see how many whole times 15 goes into 100.\n\n15 times 6 is 90, and 15 times 7 is 105. But 105 is more than 100, so only up to 15 times 6, which is 90.\n\nSo, there are 6 houses that have both red and blue doors.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check. Maybe I should list out the multiples of 15 up to 100 to be sure.\n\n15 \u00d7 1 = 15\n\n15 \u00d7 2 = 30\n\n15 \u00d7 3 = 45\n\n15 \u00d7 4 = 60\n\n15 \u00d7 5 = 75\n\n15 \u00d7 6 = 90\n\n15 \u00d7 7 = 105, which is beyond 100.\n\nSo, indeed, there are 6 houses that have both red and blue doors.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula for finding the number of multiples of a number within a range. The number of multiples of n up to x is floor(x/n).\n\nSo, floor(100/15) = floor(6.666...) = 6.\n\nThat matches what I found earlier.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also consider if there's any overlap or exception, but I don't think so in this case. The problem is straightforward: find houses that are multiples of both 3 and 5, which are multiples of 15.\n\nSo, the answer should be 6 houses have both red and blue doors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
