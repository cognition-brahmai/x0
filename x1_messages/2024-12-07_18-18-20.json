        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a box with 10 red balls and 20 blue balls, making a total of 30 balls. The task is to figure out the minimum number of balls I need to draw without looking to guarantee that I have at least 6 balls of the same color.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to \"ensure\" or \"guarantee\" that I have at least 6 balls of the same color. This means that no matter how the balls are arranged or which balls I pick, after drawing a certain number of balls, I am absolutely sure that among them, there are at least 6 balls that are either all red or all blue.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the worst-case scenario. The worst-case scenario is that I pick as many balls as possible without getting 6 balls of the same color. Once I exceed that number, then I can be sure that no matter what, I have at least 6 balls of one color.\n\nSo, let's think about the worst-case scenario. If I try to avoid getting 6 balls of the same color, I can pick up to 5 red balls and 5 blue balls. That's 10 balls in total, and I still don't have 6 balls of the same color.\n\nBut wait, there are only 10 red balls in the box. So, if I pick more than 5 red balls, I would have at least 6 red balls. Similarly, there are 20 blue balls, so if I pick more than 5 blue balls, I have at least 6 blue balls.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, I pick 5 red balls and 5 blue balls, totaling 10 balls, and I still don't have 6 of the same color. However, if I pick one more ball, the 11th ball, it must be either red or blue.\n\nIf it's red, then I have 6 red balls. If it's blue, I have 6 blue balls. So, by picking 11 balls, I guarantee that I have at least 6 balls of the same color.\n\nWait a minute, but there are only 10 red balls. So, if I pick 11 balls, and there are only 10 red balls, then it's impossible to have 11 red balls. So, in that case, if I pick 11 balls, and there are only 10 red balls, then at least one of them must be blue.\n\nBut the point is, to guarantee at least 6 balls of the same color, I need to consider the worst-case scenario where I pick as many balls as possible without reaching 6 of one color, and then add one more.\n\nSo, in this case, picking 5 red and 5 blue balls (10 balls) doesn't give me 6 of the same color. But picking one more ball (the 11th ball) ensures that regardless of its color, I will have at least 6 balls of one color.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of balls I must draw to ensure that I have at least 6 balls of the same color is 11.\n\nBut let me double-check this reasoning. Suppose I pick 5 red and 5 blue balls. That's 10 balls, and I don't have 6 of the same color yet. The next ball I pick will either be red or blue. If it's red, I have 6 red balls. If it's blue, I have 6 blue balls. So, yes, picking 11 balls guarantees that I have at least 6 balls of the same color.\n\nAlternatively, if I pick fewer than 11 balls, say 10 balls, it's possible to have 5 red and 5 blue balls, which doesn't satisfy the condition of having at least 6 balls of the same color.\n\nTherefore, 11 is the minimum number of balls I must draw to ensure that I have at least 6 balls of the same color.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]"
