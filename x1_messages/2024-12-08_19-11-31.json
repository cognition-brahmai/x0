If you or someone else is experiencing symptoms of a heart attack, it's crucial to seek immediate medical attention. That being said, here are some common signs of a heart attack:\n\n1. Chest discomfort: Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center of the chest that lasts more than a few minutes, or that goes away and comes back. It can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain.\n\n2. Discomfort in other areas of the upper body: Symptoms can include pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or stomach.\n\n3. Shortness of breath: This may occur with or without chest discomfort.\n\n4. Other signs: These may include breaking out in a cold sweat, nausea, or lightheadedness.\n\nRemember, not all these signs occur in every heart attack, and some people may experience only mild symptoms. It's important to be aware of these signs and to seek medical help immediately if you suspect a heart attack is occurring."
