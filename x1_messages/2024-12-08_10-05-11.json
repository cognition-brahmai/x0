It finds a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nSiteReader[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nURLExtractor[input]: Extract links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nASKER[input]: Question answering language model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text.  The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who was Albert Einstein and what were his major contributions to physics?"
