        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 5 red marbles, 8 blue marbles, and 12 green marbles. So, total marbles in the bag are 5 + 8 + 12, which is 25 marbles.\n\nThe question is, if you draw three marbles at random without replacement, what's the probability that you will draw exactly one marble of each color? Okay, so I need to find the probability of drawing one red, one blue, and one green marble in any order.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes when drawing three marbles from 25. Since the order doesn't matter (it's a combination, not a permutation), I should use combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 3 marbles out of 25 is calculated using the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items,\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose,\n\n- \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, for the total number of ways:\n\n\\[\nC(25, 3) = \\frac{25!}{3!(25 - 3)!} = \\frac{25!}{3! \\cdot 22!}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the 22! in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(25, 3) = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22!}{3! \\times 22!} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23}{3!}\n\\]\n\nNow, 3! is 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, which is 6. So:\n\n\\[\nC(25, 3) = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23}{6}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n25 \u00d7 24 = 600\n\n600 \u00d7 23 = 13,800\n\n13,800 \u00f7 6 = 2,300\n\nSo, there are 2,300 possible ways to draw 3 marbles from 25.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is drawing one marble of each color: one red, one blue, and one green.\n\nThere are 5 red, 8 blue, and 12 green marbles.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one red marble from five is C(5,1), which is simply 5.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose one blue marble from eight is C(8,1) = 8.\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose one green marble from twelve is C(12,1) = 12.\n\nSince these are independent choices, the total number of favorable outcomes is the product of these individual choices:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 8 \\times 12 = 480\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 480 ways to draw one marble of each color.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{one of each color}) = \\frac{480}{2300}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 40:\n\n480 \u00f7 40 = 12\n\n2300 \u00f7 40 = 57.5\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. 2300 divided by 40 is actually 57.5, but probabilities should be fractions of whole numbers. Maybe I made a mistake in simplifying.\n\nLet me check the division again.\n\n480 \u00f7 40 = 12\n\n2300 \u00f7 40 = 57.5\n\nHmm, that can't be right because probability should be a fraction of whole numbers. Perhaps 40 isn't the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 480 and 2300.\n\nLet me find the GCD of 480 and 2300.\n\nFirst, find the prime factors of each number.\n\n480:\n\n480 \u00f7 2 = 240\n\n240 \u00f7 2 = 120\n\n120 \u00f7 2 = 60\n\n60 \u00f7 2 = 30\n\n30 \u00f7 2 = 15\n\n15 \u00f7 3 = 5\n\n5 \u00f7 5 = 1\n\nSo, 480 = 2^5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5\n\n2300:\n\n2300 \u00f7 2 = 1150\n\n1150 \u00f7 2 = 575\n\n575 \u00f7 5 = 115\n\n115 \u00f7 5 = 23\n\n23 \u00f7 23 = 1\n\nSo, 2300 = 2^2 \u00d7 5^2 \u00d7 23\n\nNow, the common prime factors are 2^2 and 5.\n\nSo, GCD = 2^2 \u00d7 5 = 4 \u00d7 5 = 20\n\nTherefore, I should divide both numerator and denominator by 20.\n\n480 \u00f7 20 = 24\n\n2300 \u00f7 20 = 115\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 24/115.\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{one of each color}) = \\frac{24}{115}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, but earlier I had 480/2300, and dividing both by 20 gives 24/115. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can double-check by dividing both 480 and 2300 by 40, but as we saw, 2300 \u00f7 40 = 57.5, which is not an integer, so 20 is indeed the GCD.\n\nSo, the final probability is 24/115.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal to get a sense of it.\n\n24 \u00f7 115 \u2248 0.2087\n\nSo, approximately 20.87%.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing exactly one marble of each color is 24/115, or about 20.87%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{115}} \\]"
