        "content": "So I have this problem: find the sum of all positive integers less than 1000 that are divisible by either 3 or 5. Hmm, sounds familiar. I think this is a classic problem often used to illustrate the inclusion-exclusion principle in set theory.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have to consider all positive integers less than 1000, so that means numbers starting from 1 up to 999. Out of these, we're only interested in those that are divisible by 3 or 5.\n\nI recall that to find the sum of numbers divisible by a certain number, I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. An arithmetic series is a sequence of numbers where the difference between consecutive terms is constant.\n\nLet me start by finding the sum of numbers less than 1000 that are divisible by 3.\n\nFirst, find how many numbers less than 1000 are divisible by 3.\n\nThe smallest positive integer divisible by 3 is 3, and the largest less than 1000 would be 999, since 999 divided by 3 is 333.\n\nSo, the number of terms, n, is 333.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is given by:\n\nSum = n/2 * (first term + last term)\n\nSo, sum of numbers divisible by 3:\n\nSum_3 = 333/2 * (3 + 999) = 333/2 * 1002 = 333 * 501 = 166,833\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nFirst term a = 3, common difference d = 3, number of terms n = 333.\n\nLast term l = a + (n-1)d = 3 + (333-1)*3 = 3 + 332*3 = 3 + 996 = 999. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSum = n/2 * (a + l) = 333/2 * (3 + 999) = 333 * 501 = 166,833.\n\nAlright, now let's find the sum of numbers less than 1000 that are divisible by 5.\n\nSimilarly, the smallest positive integer divisible by 5 is 5, and the largest less than 1000 is 995.\n\nTo find the number of terms, n:\n\n995 divided by 5 is 199, so n = 199.\n\nSum of numbers divisible by 5:\n\nSum_5 = 199/2 * (5 + 995) = 199/2 * 1000 = 199 * 500 = 99,500.\n\nOkay, now here's the thing. If I just add Sum_3 and Sum_5, I'll get the total sum of numbers divisible by 3 or 5, but I'll be double-counting the numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5, i.e., divisible by 15.\n\nSo, to apply the inclusion-exclusion principle, I need to subtract the sum of numbers divisible by 15.\n\nLet me find the sum of numbers less than 1000 that are divisible by 15.\n\nSmallest positive integer divisible by 15 is 15, and the largest less than 1000 is 990.\n\nNumber of terms n:\n\n990 divided by 15 is 66, so n = 66.\n\nSum of numbers divisible by 15:\n\nSum_15 = 66/2 * (15 + 990) = 33 * 1005 = 33,165.\n\nNow, applying inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal sum = Sum_3 + Sum_5 - Sum_15 = 166,833 + 99,500 - 33,165 = 266,333 - 33,165 = 233,168.\n\nWait, but I should double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLet's verify Sum_3:\n\nn = 333, a = 3, l = 999.\n\nSum_3 = 333 * (3 + 999)/2 = 333 * 501 = 166,833. That seems correct.\n\nSum_5:\n\nn = 199, a = 5, l = 995.\n\nSum_5 = 199 * (5 + 995)/2 = 199 * 500 = 99,500. Correct.\n\nSum_15:\n\nn = 66, a = 15, l = 990.\n\nSum_15 = 66 * (15 + 990)/2 = 66 * 502.5? Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, hold on. The formula is n/2 * (a + l). So 66/2 * (15 + 990) = 33 * 1005 = 33,165. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, Total sum = 166,833 + 99,500 - 33,165.\n\nLet's add 166,833 and 99,500 first: 166,833 + 99,500 = 266,333.\n\nThen subtract 33,165: 266,333 - 33,165 = 233,168.\n\nWait, but I have a feeling that the answer might be different. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the sum of multiples of a number below a certain limit.\n\nThe sum of multiples of a number m below n is m * (floor((n-1)/m) * (floor((n-1)/m) + 1))/2.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, sum of multiples of 3 below 1000:\n\nm = 3, n = 1000.\n\nfloor(999/3) = 333.\n\nSum = 3 * (333 * 334)/2 = 3 * (111222)/2 = 3 * 55,611 = 166,833. Same as before.\n\nSimilarly, sum of multiples of 5 below 1000:\n\nm = 5, n = 1000.\n\nfloor(999/5) = 199.\n\nSum = 5 * (199 * 200)/2 = 5 * (39,800)/2 = 5 * 19,900 = 99,500. Same.\n\nSum of multiples of 15 below 1000:\n\nm = 15, n = 1000.\n\nfloor(999/15) = 66.\n\nSum = 15 * (66 * 67)/2 = 15 * (4,422)/2 = 15 * 2,211 = 33,165. Same.\n\nSo, total sum is 166,833 + 99,500 - 33,165 = 233,168.\n\nBut I recall that the standard answer to this problem is 233,168, so perhaps I'm correct.\n\nWait, but I think I've heard that the sum of multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is 233,168, but I might be misremembering.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem specifies \"below 1000\" inclusive or exclusive.\n\nWait, the problem says \"less than 1000\", so that includes 999 but not 1000.\n\nIn my calculations, I used numbers up to 999, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nAnother way to calculate this is to use the formula for the sum of multiples of 3 and 5, minus the sum of multiples of 15, as I did.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series for numbers divisible by 3 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula that combines everything.\n\nSum = sum_{k=1}^{ floor((n-1)/3)} 3k + sum_{k=1}^{ floor((n-1)/5)} 5k - sum_{k=1}^{ floor((n-1)/15)} 15k.\n\nWhich is what I used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:\n\nSum = 3 * sum_{k=1}^{ floor((n-1)/3)} k + 5 * sum_{k=1}^{ floor((n-1)/5)} k - 15 * sum_{k=1}^{ floor((n-1)/15)} k.\n\nWhich again is the same as what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:\n\nSum = 3 * (floor((n-1)/3))(floor((n-1)/3) + 1)/2 + 5 * (floor((n-1)/5))(floor((n-1)/5) + 1)/2 - 15 * (floor((n-1)/15))(floor((n-1)/15) + 1)/2.\n\nWhich is again the same calculation.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small program to verify this.\n\nLet me pseudocode a simple loop:\n\ninitialize sum = 0\n\nfor i from 1 to 999:\n\nif i mod 3 == 0 or i mod 5 == 0:\n\nsum += i\n\nprint sum\n\nThis should give the correct sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a mathematical formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series where the common difference is the least common multiple.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:\n\nSum = (3 * floor((n-1)/3) * (floor((n-1)/3) + 1))/2 + (5 * floor((n-1)/5) * (floor((n-1)/5) + 1))/2 - (15 * floor((n-1)/15) * (floor((n-1)/15) + 1))/2.\n\nWhich is exactly what I did.\n\nSo, I think 233,168 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased differently, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the sum of all positive integers less than 1000 that are divisible by 3 or 5, but not both.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"divisible by either 3 or 5\", which includes numbers divisible by both.\n\nBut in my calculation, I included numbers divisible by both once, as per inclusion-exclusion.\n\nWait, but if the problem wants numbers divisible by either 3 or 5, but not both, then I need to exclude the numbers divisible by both.\n\nIn that case, I would need to find the sum of numbers divisible by 3 only plus the sum of numbers divisible by 5 only.\n\nWhich would be Sum_3 + Sum_5 - 2*Sum_15.\n\nIn my previous calculation, Sum_3 + Sum_5 - Sum_15 gives the sum of numbers divisible by 3 or 5, including those divisible by both once.\n\nIf the problem wants only numbers divisible by 3 or 5 but not both, then I need to exclude the numbers divisible by both.\n\nSo, sum of numbers divisible by 3 only is Sum_3 - Sum_15.\n\nSum of numbers divisible by 5 only is Sum_5 - Sum_15.\n\nTotal sum would be (Sum_3 - Sum_15) + (Sum_5 - Sum_15) = Sum_3 + Sum_5 - 2*Sum_15.\n\nSo, 166,833 + 99,500 - 2*33,165 = 166,833 + 99,500 - 66,330 = 266,333 - 66,330 = 200,003.\n\nBut I don't think that's the case here, as the problem says \"divisible by either 3 or 5\", which includes numbers divisible by both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the sum of all positive integers less than 1000 that are divisible by 3 and 5, which would be only the numbers divisible by 15.\n\nBut that's not the case, as it says \"either 3 or 5\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the sum directly using a formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the sum of multiples of 3 and 5 up to n, minus the sum of multiples of 15.\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula that combines everything into one expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:\n\nSum = 3 * sum_{k=1}^{ floor((n-1)/3)} k + 5 * sum_{k=1}^{ floor((n-1)/5)} k - 15 * sum_{k=1}^{ floor((n-1)/15)} k.\n\nWhich again is the same as what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series where the common difference is the least common multiple.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:\n\nSum = (3 * floor((n-1)/3) * (floor((n-1)/3) + 1))/2 + (5 * floor((n-1)/5) * (floor((n-1)/5) + 1))/2 - (15 * floor((n-1)/15) * (floor((n-1)/15) + 1))/2.\n\nWhich is the same as what I did.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can verify with a smaller range to see if the formula works.\n\nFor example, let's consider numbers less than 20 that are divisible by 3 or 5.\n\nNumbers divisible by 3: 3,6,9,12,15,18.\n\nNumbers divisible by 5: 5,10,15,20.\n\nWait, but less than 20, so 5,10,15.\n\nNumbers divisible by both: 15.\n\nSum using inclusion-exclusion:\n\nSum_3 = 3+6+9+12+15+18 = 63.\n\nSum_5 = 5+10+15 = 30.\n\nSum_15 = 15.\n\nTotal sum = 63 + 30 - 15 = 78.\n\nAlternatively, sum of numbers less than 20 divisible by 3 or 5: 3,5,6,9,10,12,15,18.\n\nSum: 3+5=8, +6=14, +9=23, +10=33, +12=45, +15=60, +18=78. Yes, matches.\n\nSo, the formula works for this small case.\n\nTherefore, I think my calculation for the original problem is correct.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integers less than 1000 that are divisible by either 3 or 5 is 233,168.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{233168} \\]"
