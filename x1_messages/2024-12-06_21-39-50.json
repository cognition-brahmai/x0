        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, the store sells an item at a 25% discount but still makes a 20% profit. I need to find out what the original cost of the item to the store was.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what a 25% discount means. If an item has a marked price, and it's sold at a 25% discount, that means the selling price is 75% of the marked price. Right? Because 100% minus 25% discount is 75%.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\n- Let \\( C \\) be the original cost price of the item to the store.\n\n- Let \\( M \\) be the marked price of the item.\n\n- The selling price \\( S \\) is then \\( 0.75M \\), since it's sold at a 25% discount.\n\nNow, the store makes a 20% profit on the cost price. That means the selling price is 120% of the cost price. So, \\( S = 1.20C \\).\n\nSo, we have two expressions for \\( S \\):\n\n1. \\( S = 0.75M \\)\n\n2. \\( S = 1.20C \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( 0.75M = 1.20C \\).\n\nI can solve for \\( M \\) in terms of \\( C \\):\n\n\\( M = \\frac{1.20C}{0.75} = 1.60C \\)\n\nSo, the marked price is 160% of the cost price.\n\nBut wait, I think I need to find the original cost of the item to the store, which is \\( C \\). But I don't have a specific number for the selling price or the marked price. Maybe I need to express everything in terms of \\( C \\).\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose the cost price is \\( C \\). The store wants to make a 20% profit, so the selling price should be \\( 1.20C \\).\n\nNow, this selling price is also equal to the marked price minus 25% of the marked price, which is \\( M - 0.25M = 0.75M \\).\n\nSo, \\( 0.75M = 1.20C \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( M = \\frac{1.20C}{0.75} = 1.60C \\)\n\nSo, the marked price is 1.60 times the cost price.\n\nBut the question is asking for the original cost of the item to the store, which is \\( C \\). However, without a specific selling price or marked price, it seems like \\( C \\) can be any value, and the relationship holds.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpreted the question. Let me read it again.\n\n\"If a store sells an item at a 25% discount and still makes a profit of 20%, what was the original cost of the item to the store?\"\n\nHmm, it seems like there might be missing information. Maybe the question implies that the marked price is related to the cost price in a certain way, but it's not specified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is to express the cost price in terms of the selling price or the marked price, but again, no specific numbers are given.\n\nLet me consider if there's a standard approach to such problems.\n\nSuppose the store buys an item for \\( C \\) dollars. To achieve a certain profit margin, they set the marked price \\( M \\) based on \\( C \\). Then, they offer a discount on \\( M \\) to get the selling price \\( S \\), and they still make their desired profit.\n\nIn this case, they offer a 25% discount on \\( M \\), so \\( S = 0.75M \\). They want to make a 20% profit on \\( C \\), so \\( S = 1.20C \\).\n\nSetting these equal: \\( 0.75M = 1.20C \\), which gives \\( M = \\frac{1.20}{0.75}C = 1.60C \\).\n\nSo, the marked price is 160% of the cost price.\n\nBut again, without a specific value for \\( M \\) or \\( S \\), I can't solve for \\( C \\) numerically.\n\nMaybe the question is expecting an expression for \\( C \\) in terms of another variable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an assumption that the marked price is based on a certain profit margin, but that's not clear from the question.\n\nLet me try to think of it differently. Suppose the store wants to make a 20% profit on the cost price, and they know they're going to sell the item at a 25% discount. What should be the marked price to achieve that?\n\nWe've already established that \\( M = 1.60C \\).\n\nBut the question is asking for the original cost, given that scenario.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I need to consider the relationship between the cost price, the marked price, and the selling price more carefully.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Cost price: \\( C \\)\n\n- Marked price: \\( M \\)\n\n- Selling price: \\( S = M - 0.25M = 0.75M \\)\n\n- Profit: \\( S - C \\)\n\n- Profit percentage: \\( \\frac{S - C}{C} = 20\\% = 0.20 \\)\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{0.75M - C}{C} = 0.20 \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\( 0.75M - C = 0.20C \\)\n\n\\( 0.75M = 1.20C \\)\n\n\\( M = \\frac{1.20C}{0.75} = 1.60C \\)\n\nSo, the marked price is 160% of the cost price.\n\nBut I still don't have a numerical value for \\( C \\). Maybe the question is to express the cost price in terms of the selling price or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem.\n\nLet me consider that the store sells the item at a 25% discount and still makes a 20% profit on the cost price. I need to find the cost price.\n\nBut to find a specific numerical value for the cost price, I need some additional information, such as the selling price or the marked price.\n\nWithout that, I can only express the relationships between these variables, as I've done above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is to find the cost price in terms of the selling price.\n\nLet's denote the selling price as \\( S \\).\n\nWe know that \\( S = 0.75M \\) and \\( S = 1.20C \\).\n\nFrom \\( S = 1.20C \\), we can solve for \\( C \\):\n\n\\( C = \\frac{S}{1.20} \\)\n\nSo, the original cost to the store is \\( \\frac{S}{1.20} \\), where \\( S \\) is the selling price.\n\nBut again, without a specific value for \\( S \\), I can't compute a numerical value for \\( C \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is to express the cost price in terms of the marked price.\n\nFrom earlier, \\( M = 1.60C \\), so \\( C = \\frac{M}{1.60} \\).\n\nBut again, without a specific \\( M \\), I can't find a numerical value for \\( C \\).\n\nMaybe I'm missing something. Perhaps there's a standard formula or a different approach to this problem.\n\nLet me try to look at it from the perspective of the markup.\n\nSuppose the store wants to make a 20% profit on the cost price. That means the selling price is 120% of the cost price.\n\nBut they're selling it at a 25% discount on the marked price, meaning the selling price is 75% of the marked price.\n\nSo, \\( 0.75M = 1.20C \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( M = \\frac{1.20}{0.75}C = 1.60C \\)\n\nThis confirms what I had earlier.\n\nPerhaps the question is to find the ratio of the marked price to the cost price, which is 1.60, or 160%.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the original cost of the item to the store, which suggests that a numerical value is expected.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question implies that the marked price is a certain percentage above the cost price, but that's not specified.\n\nWait, perhaps the marked price is 100% above the cost price, meaning \\( M = 2C \\), but that's not indicated in the question.\n\nWithout additional information, such as the selling price or the marked price, I don't see how to determine the original cost price numerically.\n\nMaybe the question is incomplete or missing some details.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is to find the cost price in terms of the selling price, which I've already done as \\( C = \\frac{S}{1.20} \\).\n\nBut again, without \\( S \\), I can't find a numerical value.\n\nI think I need more information to solve for the original cost price. Maybe the selling price or the marked price is given, but it's not provided in the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard assumption in such problems that the marked price is a certain percentage above the cost price, but I don't recall any such standard.\n\nGiven the information provided, I can only express the relationships between the cost price, marked price, and selling price, but I cannot determine a specific numerical value for the cost price.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the problem as stated does not provide sufficient information to find a unique solution for the original cost of the item to the store.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Insufficient information to determine the original cost price numerically.}} \\]"
