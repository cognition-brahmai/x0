A network where the degree distribution follows a power law.\n\nScale-free networks are a type of network where the degree distribution follows a power law, at least asymptotically. This means that the fraction P(k) of nodes in the network having k connections to other nodes goes for large values of k as\n\nP(k) ~ k^(-\u03b3)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is a parameter whose value is typically in the range between 2 and 3, although occasionally it may lie outside these bounds.\n\nIn such networks, some nodes, known as hubs, have a significantly higher number of connections compared to others. This property makes scale-free networks highly resilient to random node failures but vulnerable to targeted attacks on hubs.\n\nScale-free networks are observed in various real-world systems, such as the World Wide Web, social networks, biological networks, and many others. The power-law degree distribution is a key characteristic that distinguishes scale-free networks from other types of networks, such as random networks or small-world networks.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **Power Law Degree Distribution:** The probability that a node has k connections decreases as a power law.\n\n- **Hubs:** Presence of a few nodes with a very high degree.\n\n- **Resilience to Random Failures:** Due to the presence of hubs, the network remains connected even if many nodes are removed randomly.\n\n- **Vulnerability to Targeted Attacks:** Removing hubs can lead to the disintegration of the network.\n\n- **Prevalence in Real-World Systems:** Common in many naturally occurring and human-made networks.\n\n**Comparison with Other Network Types:**\n\n- **Random Networks (Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model):** Degree distribution is binomial or Poisson, with most nodes having similar degrees.\n\n- **Small-World Networks:** Have short path lengths and high clustering coefficients, often with a Poisson degree distribution.\n\nScale-free networks are a fundamental concept in network science and have significant implications for understanding the structure and dynamics of complex systems."
