The Sistine Chapel's ceiling is indeed his most renowned work, and the scene you're referring to is part of his series of frescoes that depict various scenes from the Book of Genesis, including the Creation of Adam, where God and Adam reach out to each other symbolizing the imparting of the spark of life. It's an iconic image that has been reproduced and parodied countless times in popular culture."
