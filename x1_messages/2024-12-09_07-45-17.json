        "content": "To calculate how many miles a person walks in a year if they take 10,000 steps per day on average, we need to know the average length of a step. The average step length for an adult is about 2.5 feet.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many feet are in a mile. There are 5,280 feet in a mile.\n\nNext, we can calculate how many steps are in a mile by dividing the number of feet in a mile by the average step length:\n\n5,280 feet per mile / 2.5 feet per step = 2,112 steps per mile\n\nNow, if a person takes 10,000 steps per day, we can find out how many miles that is by dividing the total steps by the number of steps per mile:\n\n10,000 steps per day / 2,112 steps per mile \u2248 4.73 miles per day\n\nFinally, to find out how many miles a person walks in a year, we need to multiply the daily mileage by the number of days in a year:\n\n4.73 miles per day \u00d7 365 days per year \u2248 1,725.45 miles per year\n\nTherefore, a person who takes 10,000 steps per day on average walks approximately 1,725 miles in a year.\n\n**Note:** This is a general estimate and can vary based on individual step length and the actual number of steps taken each day."
