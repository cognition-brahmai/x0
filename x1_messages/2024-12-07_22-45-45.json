        "content": "So I've got this problem here about calculating the total cost of a conference for a large corporation. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are 1,500 employees attending the conference, and it's going to last for three days at a resort. The resort charges $250 per person per night for accommodations and meals. So, I need to calculate the cost for all those people staying for three nights.\n\nLet me start by calculating the cost for one person for three nights. That would be $250 per night times 3 nights, which is $750 per person.\n\nNow, since there are 1,500 employees, I'll multiply $750 by 1,500 to get the total cost for all employees for accommodations and meals.\n\n$750 times 1,500 is... let's see, 750 times 1,000 is $750,000, and 750 times 500 is $375,000. So, $750,000 plus $375,000 equals $1,125,000.\n\nOkay, so the total cost for accommodations and meals is $1,125,000.\n\nNext, the company needs to rent conference rooms and audio-visual equipment, which costs $25,000 per day. Since the conference is three days long, I'll multiply $25,000 by 3.\n\n$25,000 times 3 is $75,000.\n\nSo, the total cost for conference rooms and AV equipment is $75,000.\n\nNow, I need to add the accommodations and meals cost to the conference rooms and AV equipment cost to get the subtotal before tax.\n\nThat's $1,125,000 plus $75,000, which equals $1,200,000.\n\nFinally, there's a 7% tax on all expenses. So, I need to calculate 7% of $1,200,000 and add that to the subtotal to get the total cost.\n\nFirst, find 7% of $1,200,000. \n\n7% of $1,200,000 is 0.07 times $1,200,000, which is $84,000.\n\nNow, add the tax to the subtotal: $1,200,000 plus $84,000 equals $1,284,000.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of hosting the conference, including the 7% tax on all expenses, is $1,284,000.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, per person cost for three nights: $250/night * 3 nights = $750.\n\nThen, for 1,500 people: $750 * 1,500 = $1,125,000.\n\nConference rooms and AV: $25,000/day * 3 days = $75,000.\n\nSubtotal: $1,125,000 + $75,000 = $1,200,000.\n\nTax: 7% of $1,200,000 = $84,000.\n\nTotal: $1,200,000 + $84,000 = $1,284,000.\n\nSeems correct. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1284000} \\]"
