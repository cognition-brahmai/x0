The bartender looks up and says, \"What is this, some kind of joke?\" The golfer says, \"I don't know, I'm just here for the free drinks.\" The priest says, \"Actually, I'm here to discuss a sermon.\" And the lawyer says, \"I'm here because the other two asked me to accompany them.\" The bartender shakes his head and says, \"Well, at least I know who's telling the truth here.\" So, they all have a good laugh, and that's the end of that joke. It's a bit light-hearted, but I hope you enjoyed it!"
