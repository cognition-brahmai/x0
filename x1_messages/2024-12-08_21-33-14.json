        "content": "Let's see. So, the person is walking at an average speed of 3 miles per hour for 2 hours and 30 minutes. I need to find out how far they travel.\n\nFirst, I should probably convert the time into hours since the speed is in miles per hour. 2 hours and 30 minutes is the same as 2.5 hours, right? Because 30 minutes is half an hour, so 2 plus 0.5 equals 2.5 hours.\n\nNow, to find the distance, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nDistance = 3 miles per hour \u00d7 2.5 hours\n\nMultiplying those together:\n\nDistance = 7.5 miles\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of it differently. In one hour, the person walks 3 miles. So in 2 hours, they would walk 6 miles. Then, in half an hour, they would walk half of 3 miles, which is 1.5 miles. So, total distance would be 6 miles plus 1.5 miles, which is 7.5 miles.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the time into minutes. 2 hours and 30 minutes is 150 minutes. Then, the speed is 3 miles per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the speed in miles per minute would be 3 miles per 60 minutes, which is 0.05 miles per minute.\n\nThen, distance would be speed times time: 0.05 miles per minute \u00d7 150 minutes = 7.5 miles.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to look at this. Maybe using fractions. 2 hours and 30 minutes is 2 and a half hours, which is 5/2 hours.\n\nSo, distance = 3 miles per hour \u00d7 5/2 hours = (3 \u00d7 5)/2 = 15/2 = 7.5 miles.\n\nOnce more, I get 7.5 miles.\n\nI think it's consistent across different methods, so I can be confident that the answer is 7.5 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.5} \\]"
