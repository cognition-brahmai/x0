It's denoted by the symbol Au on the periodic table, which actually comes from its Latin name, Aurum, meaning \"shining dawn\" or \"glow of sunrise.\" Gold has been valued for centuries for its attractive yellow color and its unique physical properties, such as being highly malleable and ductile. This means it can be beaten into thin sheets or drawn into fine wires without breaking, making it ideal for crafting intricate jewelry pieces. Additionally, gold is resistant to tarnish and corrosion, which further enhances its appeal for decorative and lasting applications."
