        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here. There's a group of people, and they're categorized by eye color and whether they wear glasses or not. So, 60% have brown eyes, and 40% have green eyes. Then, among those with brown eyes, 70% wear glasses, and among those with green eyes, 50% wear glasses. I need to find out what percentage of the whole group wears glasses.\n\nOkay, first things first. I think I should consider the total group as 100% for simplicity. So, let's say there are 100 people in the group. That way, percentages directly translate to numbers of people.\n\nSo, 60% have brown eyes, which means 60 people have brown eyes. And 40% have green eyes, so 40 people have green eyes.\n\nNow, among the brown-eyed people, 70% wear glasses. So, 70% of 60 people wear glasses. Let's calculate that: 0.70 times 60 is 42. So, 42 people with brown eyes wear glasses.\n\nSimilarly, among the green-eyed people, 50% wear glasses. So, 50% of 40 people is 20 people with green eyes wear glasses.\n\nNow, to find the total number of people who wear glasses, I just need to add those two numbers together: 42 plus 20 equals 62.\n\nSince we started with 100 people, 62% of the group wears glasses.\n\nWait a minute, is there a different way to approach this? Maybe using probabilities or something like that?\n\nLet's try. The probability that someone has brown eyes is 60%, and given that, the probability they wear glasses is 70%. So, the joint probability of having brown eyes and wearing glasses is 0.60 times 0.70, which is 0.42 or 42%.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having green eyes is 40%, and given that, the probability of wearing glasses is 50%. So, that's 0.40 times 0.50, which is 0.20 or 20%.\n\nNow, to find the total probability of wearing glasses, regardless of eye color, I add those two probabilities together: 42% plus 20% equals 62%.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier. So, I think 62% is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there any overlap or other categories I should consider? The problem only mentions two eye colors and whether people wear glasses or not. It seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of a formula. The total percentage wearing glasses is equal to the sum of the percentages wearing glasses within each eye color group, weighted by the proportion of each eye color in the group.\n\nSo, it's (percentage with brown eyes) times (percentage of brown-eyed people who wear glasses) plus (percentage with green eyes) times (percentage of green-eyed people who wear glasses).\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 60% times 70% plus 40% times 50%, which is 42% plus 20%, totaling 62%.\n\nYep, same answer again. I think I'm confident with this.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the entire group and the contributions from each subgroup. The brown-eyed glass wearers contribute 42% of the total group, and the green-eyed glass wearers contribute 20%, so together they make up 62%.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this reasoning. It seems consistent across different approaches.\n\nJust to double-check, let's imagine different numbers. Suppose the group had 50% brown-eyed people and 50% green-eyed people, with the same percentages wearing glasses. Then, it would be 50% times 70% plus 50% times 50%, which is 35% plus 25%, totaling 60%. But in our case, it's 60% brown-eyed and 40% green-eyed, leading to 42% plus 20%, which is 62%. That makes sense because there are more brown-eyed people, who have a higher percentage of glass wearers.\n\nSo, in conclusion, 62% of the group wears glasses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{62\\%} \\]"
