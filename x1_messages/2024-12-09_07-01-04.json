The city currently has 200 diesel buses, and they want to replace 50% of them with electric buses over the next 5 years. Each electric bus costs $750,000, and the city can allocate a budget of $20 million for this project. Calculate how many electric buses the city can purchase within the given budget, and determine if it's possible to achieve their goal. Also, calculate the annual budget allocation required to meet the target."

        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the city wants to replace 50% of their 200 diesel buses with electric buses over the next 5 years. First, I need to figure out how many buses that is.\n\nIf they have 200 diesel buses and want to replace 50% of them, that means they want to replace:\n\n200 buses * 50% = 100 buses\n\nSo, they want to add 100 electric buses to their fleet over 5 years.\n\nNext, each electric bus costs $750,000. To find out the total cost for 100 electric buses, I'll multiply the number of buses by the cost per bus:\n\n100 buses * $750,000/bus = $75,000,000\n\nSo, the total cost would be $75 million.\n\nBut the city has allocated a budget of $20 million for this project. That means they have $20 million to spend, but the total cost is $75 million. That seems like a problem because $20 million is less than $75 million.\n\nSo, with $20 million, how many electric buses can they actually purchase?\n\nEach bus costs $750,000, so the number of buses they can buy is:\n\n$20,000,000 / $750,000 per bus = approximately 26.67 buses\n\nBut they can't buy a fraction of a bus, so they can purchase 26 buses with $20 million.\n\nBut their goal is to replace 100 buses. So, with only $20 million, they can only afford 26 buses, which is far short of their target.\n\nNow, they want to do this over 5 years. So, maybe they can spread out the purchases over the 5 years.\n\nIf they want to reach 100 buses in 5 years, they would need to purchase:\n\n100 buses / 5 years = 20 buses per year\n\nBut each bus costs $750,000, so the annual cost would be:\n\n20 buses/year * $750,000/bus = $15,000,000 per year\n\nSo, to meet their goal, they need to spend $15 million each year for 5 years, totaling $75 million.\n\nBut they have allocated only $20 million in total, not per year. So, there's a mismatch here.\n\nAlternatively, if they allocate the $20 million over 5 years, that would be:\n\n$20,000,000 / 5 years = $4,000,000 per year\n\nWith $4 million per year, how many buses can they buy each year?\n\n$4,000,000 / $750,000 per bus = approximately 5.33 buses per year\n\nAgain, they can't buy a fraction of a bus, so they can purchase 5 buses per year.\n\nOver 5 years, that would be:\n\n5 buses/year * 5 years = 25 buses\n\nWhich is still short of their goal of 100 buses.\n\nSo, it seems impossible for them to reach their goal with the current budget allocation.\n\nUnless they find additional funds or the cost of electric buses decreases over time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can seek grants, partnerships, or subsidies to help cover the cost.\n\nAnother option could be to extend the timeline beyond 5 years.\n\nBut based on the current information, with a total budget of $20 million and each bus costing $750,000, they can only afford about 26 buses, far short of the 100 they aim to purchase.\n\nSo, to answer the questions:\n\n1. How many electric buses can the city purchase within the given budget?\n\nWith $20 million, they can purchase approximately 26 electric buses.\n\n2. Is it possible to achieve their goal?\n\nNo, it's not possible with the current budget, as their goal requires $75 million, and they only have $20 million allocated.\n\n3. Calculate the annual budget allocation required to meet the target.\n\nTo purchase 100 buses over 5 years, they need to spend $15 million per year.\n\nGiven that, it seems like they need to either increase their budget, extend the timeline, or find a way to reduce the cost per bus.\n\nMaybe they can phase the replacement over a longer period or look for more funding options.\n\nBut with the current budget, they cannot achieve their goal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{26 \\text{ buses}} \\]"
