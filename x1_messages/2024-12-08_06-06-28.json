        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a factory that produces widgets in three colors: red, blue, and green. The problem gives us two ratios: the ratio of red to blue widgets is 3:2, and the ratio of blue to green widgets is 4:5. We need to find the ratio of red to green widgets.\n\nFirst, let's understand what ratios represent. A ratio compares quantities of different things. In this case, we're comparing the quantities of red, blue, and green widgets.\n\nGiven:\n\n- The ratio of red to blue widgets is 3:2.\n\n- The ratio of blue to green widgets is 4:5.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of red to green widgets.\n\nOne way to approach this is to find a common term between the two given ratios, which in this case is the number of blue widgets. This will allow us to link the two ratios together and find the relationship between red and green widgets.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Red widgets as R\n\n- Blue widgets as B\n\n- Green widgets as G\n\nFrom the first ratio, R:B = 3:2. This means that for every 3 red widgets, there are 2 blue widgets.\n\nFrom the second ratio, B:G = 4:5. This means that for every 4 blue widgets, there are 5 green widgets.\n\nTo combine these ratios, we need to express them with a common term for blue widgets.\n\nLet's find a common multiple for the blue widgets in both ratios. In the first ratio, blue is 2 parts, and in the second ratio, blue is 4 parts. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 4 is 4.\n\nSo, we'll adjust the first ratio so that the number of blue widgets is 4.\n\nOriginal first ratio: R:B = 3:2\n\nTo make B=4, we multiply both sides of the ratio by 2:\n\nR:B = (3*2):(2*2) = 6:4\n\nNow, the first ratio is R:B = 6:4, and the second ratio is B:G = 4:5.\n\nSince the number of blue widgets is now the same in both ratios (4), we can combine them:\n\nR:B:G = 6:4:5\n\nFrom this combined ratio, the ratio of red to green widgets is 6:5.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let's double-check.\n\nAlternatively, another way to find the ratio of red to green widgets is to express both in terms of blue widgets and then relate them directly.\n\nFrom the first ratio, R/B = 3/2, so R = (3/2)B.\n\nFrom the second ratio, B/G = 4/5, so G = (5/4)B.\n\nNow, we can find R/G by substituting the expressions in terms of B:\n\nR/G = (R)/(G) = ( (3/2)B ) / ( (5/4)B ) = (3/2) / (5/4) = (3/2) * (4/5) = (3*4)/(2*5) = 12/10 = 6/5.\n\nSo, R:G = 6:5.\n\nThis confirms our earlier result.\n\nLet's consider if there's another way to approach this to ensure accuracy.\n\nSuppose we assume a specific number of blue widgets and then find the corresponding numbers of red and green widgets based on the given ratios.\n\nLet\u2019s assume there are 4 blue widgets (since 4 is a common multiple we used earlier).\n\nFrom the first ratio, R:B = 3:2.\n\nIf B=4, then R = (3/2)*4 = 6.\n\nFrom the second ratio, B:G = 4:5.\n\nIf B=4, then G = (5/4)*4 = 5.\n\nSo, R=6 and G=5, which gives R:G = 6:5.\n\nThis matches our previous findings.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose a different multiple, say B=8.\n\nFrom R:B = 3:2, R = (3/2)*8 = 12.\n\nFrom B:G = 4:5, G = (5/4)*8 = 10.\n\nSo, R:G = 12:10 = 6:5 after simplifying.\n\nAgain, the same ratio.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of red to green widgets is 6:5.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor we should account for.\n\nIs there any possibility that the ratios could be different depending on the total number of widgets?\n\nNo, ratios are proportions and should hold regardless of the total number, as long as the proportions remain the same.\n\nAlso, we assumed that the number of blue widgets is the same in both ratios, which is valid because blue widgets are common to both ratios.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the ratios as fractions and find a way to relate the red and green widgets through blue.\n\nWe have R/B = 3/2 and B/G = 4/5.\n\nTo find R/G, we can multiply R/B by B/G:\n\nR/G = (R/B) * (B/G) = (3/2) * (4/5) = 12/10 = 6/5.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nThis reinforces our confidence in the answer.\n\nI don't think there's any other angle to approach this problem from.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of red to green widgets is 6:5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6:5} \\]"
