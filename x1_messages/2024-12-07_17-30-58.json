        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. We've got 100 people in a room, and they speak different languages: 80 speak English, 70 speak Spanish, and 60 speak French. We need to find the minimum number of people who speak all three languages.\n\nFirst, I think I should recall some set theory principles because this sounds like a problem involving overlapping sets. The principle of inclusion-exclusion might be useful here.\n\nSo, the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets says that to find the total number of elements in at least one of the sets, you add the sizes of the individual sets, subtract the sizes of their pairwise intersections, and then add back the size of the intersection of all three sets.\n\nMathematically, it's:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nIn this problem, A, B, and C represent the sets of people speaking English, Spanish, and French, respectively.\n\nWe know:\n\n|A| = 80\n\n|B| = 70\n\n|C| = 60\n\nAnd the total number of people is 100, so |A \u222a B \u222a C| \u2264 100.\n\nOur goal is to find the minimum |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|.\n\nTo minimize the number of people who speak all three languages, I need to maximize the overlaps between only two languages.\n\nLet me think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the sum of the individual sets:\n\n|A| + |B| + |C| = 80 + 70 + 60 = 210\n\nNow, if there were no overlaps, the total number of people would be 210, but we only have 100 people. So, there must be overlaps.\n\nThe overlaps are the pairwise intersections and the triple intersection.\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n210 - (|A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C|) + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| = |A \u222a B \u222a C| \u2264 100\n\nWe want to minimize |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|, so we need to maximize the sum of the pairwise intersections.\n\nBut how can we maximize the sum of the pairwise intersections?\n\nLet's think about the maximum possible overlap between two sets.\n\nFor example, the maximum possible |A \u2229 B| is 70, because |B| = 70 is the smaller of |A| and |B|.\n\nSimilarly, the maximum |A \u2229 C| is 60, and the maximum |B \u2229 C| is 60.\n\nBut wait, these maximum overlaps might not be achievable simultaneously.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose we try to maximize the sum |A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C|.\n\nTo maximize this sum, we need as many people as possible to be in exactly two of the sets.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- x = |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\n- y = |A \u2229 C| - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\n- z = |B \u2229 C| - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\n- w = |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nThen, the total number of distinct people is:\n\n|A| + |B| + |C| - (x + y + z + 2w)\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the total number of language speakers:\n\nWe have 210 total language speakers, but only 100 people, so there are 210 - 100 = 110 overlaps.\n\nThese overlaps can be either pairwise overlaps or the triple overlap.\n\nEach pairwise overlap counts once, and the triple overlap counts twice (since it's in all three pairwise overlaps).\n\nSo, if we let:\n\n- p = number of people in exactly two languages\n\n- q = number of people in all three languages\n\nThen, the total overlaps are p + 2q = 110\n\nAnd the total number of people is:\n\nPeople speaking only one language + p + q = 100\n\nBut we can express people speaking only one language as:\n\n|A| - (x + y + w) + |B| - (x + z + w) + |C| - (y + z + w)\n\nWait, this is getting messy.\n\nLet me try to use the inclusion-exclusion formula directly.\n\nWe have:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nWe know |A \u222a B \u222a C| \u2264 100\n\nSo:\n\n80 + 70 + 60 - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| \u2264 100\n\nSimplify:\n\n210 - (|A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C|) + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| \u2264 100\n\nRearrange:\n\n|A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C| - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| \u2265 110\n\nOur goal is to minimize |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|, so we need to maximize |A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C|\n\nBut we need to consider the constraints on these pairwise intersections.\n\nWe know that:\n\n|A \u2229 B| \u2264 min(|A|, |B|) = 70\n\n|A \u2229 C| \u2264 min(|A|, |C|) = 60\n\n|B \u2229 C| \u2264 min(|B|, |C|) = 60\n\nSo, the maximum possible sum is 70 + 60 + 60 = 190\n\nBut, in reality, it might not be possible to have all these pairwise intersections at their maximum because of overlaps.\n\nWait, let's think about the total possible overlaps.\n\nIf we sum the pairwise intersections, we get:\n\n|A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C| \u2264 |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \u222a B \u222a C|\n\nBut we don't know |A \u222a B \u222a C| yet.\n\nAlternatively, from the earlier inequality:\n\n|A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C| - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| \u2265 110\n\nWe can rearrange to:\n\n|A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C| \u2265 110 + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nTo minimize |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|, we need to maximize |A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C|\n\nBut, considering the constraints on the pairwise intersections.\n\nLet me try to assume that |A \u2229 B|, |A \u2229 C|, and |B \u2229 C| are as large as possible without exceeding their individual maxima.\n\nLet\u2019s set:\n\n|A \u2229 B| = 70\n\n|A \u2229 C| = 60\n\n|B \u2229 C| = 60\n\nThen, plugging into the inequality:\n\n70 + 60 + 60 - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| \u2265 110\n\n190 - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| \u2265 110\n\nSo, |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| \u2264 80\n\nBut this doesn't help much because |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| can't be more than the individual intersections.\n\nWait, I need to think differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the maximum possible sum of pairwise intersections that doesn't exceed the total overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the number of people in exactly two languages.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- a = |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\n- b = |A \u2229 C| - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\n- c = |B \u2229 C| - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nThen, the number of people in exactly two languages is a + b + c, and the number in all three is w = |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nThe total number of people is:\n\n|A| + |B| + |C| - (a + b + c + 2w) = 100\n\nWe have:\n\n80 + 70 + 60 - (a + b + c + 2w) = 100\n\n210 - (a + b + c + 2w) = 100\n\nSo, a + b + c + 2w = 110\n\nOur goal is to minimize w, so we need to maximize a + b + c\n\nBut a, b, c are non-negative, and they are bounded by:\n\na \u2264 |A \u2229 B| - w \u2264 70 - w\n\nb \u2264 |A \u2229 C| - w \u2264 60 - w\n\nc \u2264 |B \u2229 C| - w \u2264 60 - w\n\nSo, a + b + c \u2264 (70 - w) + (60 - w) + (60 - w) = 190 - 3w\n\nPlugging back into the equation:\n\na + b + c + 2w = 110\n\nWe have:\n\n190 - 3w \u2265 110 - 2w\n\nWait, this seems confusing.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nFrom a + b + c + 2w = 110 and a + b + c \u2264 190 - 3w, we have:\n\n110 - 2w \u2264 190 - 3w\n\nAdding 3w to both sides:\n\n110 + w \u2264 190\n\nSubtracting 110:\n\nw \u2264 80\n\nAgain, this doesn't seem helpful.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the minimal w such that a + b + c = 110 - 2w is less than or equal to 190 - 3w.\n\nSo:\n\n110 - 2w \u2264 190 - 3w\n\nAdding 3w to both sides:\n\n110 + w \u2264 190\n\nSubtracting 110:\n\nw \u2264 80\n\nBut w also can't be negative, so w \u2265 0\n\nBut this seems too broad. There must be a better way to find the minimal w.\n\nLet me try to think about it differently.\n\nSuppose we want to minimize the number of people who speak all three languages.\n\nTo minimize this, we need as many people as possible to speak only two languages.\n\nSo, let's see how many people are speaking at least two languages.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nn = number of people speaking at least two languages.\n\nThen, n = number of people speaking exactly two languages + number of people speaking all three languages.\n\nFrom earlier, a + b + c + w = n\n\nAnd from a + b + c + 2w = 110, we have n + w = 110\n\nSo, n = 110 - w\n\nOur goal is to maximize n, which means minimizing w.\n\nBut n cannot exceed the sum of the pairwise intersections minus w.\n\nWait, this seems circular.\n\nLet me try to find the maximum possible n.\n\nThe maximum n can be is the sum of the pairwise intersections minus twice the triple intersection.\n\nBut this is getting too convoluted.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the total number of language speakers:\n\nEnglish: 80\n\nSpanish: 70\n\nFrench: 60\n\nTotal language instances: 80 + 70 + 60 = 210\n\nBut there are only 100 people, so there are 210 - 100 = 110 overlaps.\n\nEach person who speaks two languages contributes one overlap, and each person who speaks three languages contributes two overlaps.\n\nSo, if we let:\n\n- x = number of people who speak exactly two languages\n\n- y = number of people who speak exactly three languages\n\nThen, the total overlaps are x + 2y = 110\n\nAnd the total number of people is (number speaking only one language) + x + y = 100\n\nWe can find the number of people speaking only one language by subtracting those speaking two or three languages.\n\nBut we can also express the total language instances as:\n\nOnly English: 80 - x - y\n\nOnly Spanish: 70 - x - y\n\nOnly French: 60 - x - y\n\nPlus x (speaking two languages) and y (speaking three languages)\n\nSo:\n\n(80 - x - y) + (70 - x - y) + (60 - x - y) + x + y = 100\n\nSimplify:\n\n210 - 2x - 2y = 100\n\nSo, 210 - 2(x + y) = 100\n\nThen, 2(x + y) = 110\n\nThus, x + y = 55\n\nBut we also have x + 2y = 110 from the overlaps.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) x + y = 55\n\n2) x + 2y = 110\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\ny = 55\n\nThen, from equation 1: x + 55 = 55 \u21d2 x = 0\n\nSo, y = 55, x = 0\n\nThis suggests that 55 people speak all three languages, and 0 people speak exactly two languages.\n\nBut this seems too high for the minimum number of people speaking all three languages.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nWe have:\n\nTotal language instances: 80 + 70 + 60 = 210\n\nTotal people: 100\n\nOverlaps: 210 - 100 = 110\n\nEach person speaking two languages contributes one overlap, and each speaking three languages contributes two overlaps.\n\nSo, x + 2y = 110\n\nTotal people: people speaking only one language + x + y = 100\n\nAlso, people speaking only one language = total in individual sets minus those in intersections.\n\nSo, only English: 80 - x - y\n\nOnly Spanish: 70 - x - y\n\nOnly French: 60 - x - y\n\nTotal only one language: (80 - x - y) + (70 - x - y) + (60 - x - y) = 210 - 3x - 3y\n\nThen, total people: (210 - 3x - 3y) + x + y = 100\n\nSimplify: 210 - 2x - 2y = 100\n\nSo, 2x + 2y = 110 \u21d2 x + y = 55\n\nAnd we have x + 2y = 110\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second: y = 55\n\nThen, x = 55 - y = 0\n\nSo, y = 55, x = 0\n\nThis suggests that at least 55 people speak all three languages.\n\nBut this seems counterintuitive because it's a large number. Let me verify.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if this is indeed the minimal number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to have more people speaking exactly two languages, thus reducing those speaking all three.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nSuppose y is less than 55, say y = 54\n\nThen, from x + y = 55, x = 1\n\nFrom x + 2y = 1 + 2*54 = 109, which should be equal to 110. But it's 109, which is less than 110.\n\nBut overlaps must equal 110, so this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if y = 55, x = 0, then x + 2y = 110, which matches.\n\nIf y = 56, x = -1, which is impossible.\n\nSo, y must be exactly 55, and x = 0.\n\nThis suggests that the minimal number of people speaking all three languages is 10.\n\nWait, earlier I got y = 55, but that seems too high.\n\nLet me check my calculations again.\n\nFrom:\n\nx + y = 55\n\nx + 2y = 110\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\ny = 55\n\nThen, x = 55 - 55 = 0\n\nBut does this make sense?\n\nLet's plug back to check:\n\nOnly English: 80 - 0 - 55 = 25\n\nOnly Spanish: 70 - 0 - 55 = 15\n\nOnly French: 60 - 0 - 55 = 5\n\nPeople speaking exactly two languages: 0\n\nPeople speaking all three languages: 55\n\nTotal people: 25 + 15 + 5 + 0 + 55 = 100\n\nTotal language instances:\n\nOnly English: 25*1 = 25\n\nOnly Spanish: 15*1 = 15\n\nOnly French: 5*1 = 5\n\nAll three: 55*3 = 165\n\nTotal: 25 + 15 + 5 + 165 = 210, which matches.\n\nBut is there a way to have fewer people speaking all three languages?\n\nSuppose we try y = 54, then x = 1\n\nThen:\n\nOnly English: 80 - 1 - 54 = 25\n\nOnly Spanish: 70 - 1 - 54 = 15\n\nOnly French: 60 - 1 - 54 = 5\n\nExactly two languages: 1*2 = 2 (since x=1, but this is counting in the overlaps)\n\nWait, no.\n\nEach person speaking exactly two languages contributes one overlap, and each speaking three languages contributes two overlaps.\n\nSo, overlaps = x + 2y = 1 + 2*54 = 109, which is less than 110.\n\nBut we need 110 overlaps. So, this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if y = 55, x = 0, overlaps = 0 + 2*55 = 110, which matches.\n\nIf y = 56, x = -1, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, y must be at least 55.\n\nWait, but this seems too high. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the sum of the pairwise intersections.\n\nWe have:\n\n|A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C| - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| = 110\n\nWe need to minimize |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|, so we need to maximize |A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C|\n\nWhat's the maximum possible sum of the pairwise intersections?\n\nEach pairwise intersection can't exceed the smaller of the two sets.\n\nSo, |A \u2229 B| \u2264 70\n\n|A \u2229 C| \u2264 60\n\n|B \u2229 C| \u2264 60\n\nSo, the maximum sum is 70 + 60 + 60 = 190\n\nThen, from:\n\n|A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C| - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| \u2265 110\n\nIf |A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C| = 190, then |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| \u2264 80\n\nBut we need to minimize |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|, so we need to see if |A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C| can be as high as 190.\n\nHowever, there might be constraints that prevent this.\n\nLet me consider the total number of people.\n\nWe have:\n\n|A| + |B| + |C| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| = |A \u222a B \u222a C| \u2264 100\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n80 + 70 + 60 - (|A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C|) + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| \u2264 100\n\n210 - (|A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C|) + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| \u2264 100\n\nRearranged:\n\n(|A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C|) - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| \u2265 110\n\nThis is the same as before.\n\nTo minimize |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|, we need to maximize (|A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C|)\n\nThe maximum sum is 70 + 60 + 60 = 190\n\nSo, 190 - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| \u2265 110 \u21d2 |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| \u2264 80\n\nBut this doesn't directly give us the minimal |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the actual overlaps.\n\nLet\u2019s think about the minimal |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nSuppose we set |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| to be as small as possible.\n\nWhat's the smallest possible value?\n\nIt can't be less than zero, so the minimal possible is zero.\n\nBut in reality, it might not be possible to have zero people speaking all three languages given the numbers.\n\nSo, we need to find the actual minimal possible value.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nIf |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| = 0, then |A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C| \u2265 110\n\nBut |A \u2229 B| \u2264 70, |A \u2229 C| \u2264 60, |B \u2229 C| \u2264 60\n\nSo, the maximum sum is 70 + 60 + 60 = 190, which is greater than 110.\n\nBut we need to check if it's possible to have |A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C| = 110 with |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| = 0\n\nWait, but if |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| = 0, then |A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C| must be at least 110.\n\nIs this possible?\n\nLet\u2019s see.\n\nIf |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| = 0, then the inclusion-exclusion formula becomes:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = 80 + 70 + 60 - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 C| \u2264 100\n\nSo, 210 - (|A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C|) \u2264 100 \u21d2 |A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C| \u2265 110\n\nThis is consistent with what we have.\n\nBut is there a way to arrange the overlaps such that |A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C| = 110 and |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| = 0?\n\nLet\u2019s try to see.\n\nSuppose |A \u2229 B| = x, |A \u2229 C| = y, |B \u2229 C| = z\n\nWe have x + y + z = 110\n\nAnd x \u2264 70, y \u2264 60, z \u2264 60\n\nIs this possible?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nIf x = 70, y = 40, z = 0, but z cannot be less than zero.\n\nWait, z cannot be zero because |B \u2229 C| \u2264 60, but it can be up to 60.\n\nAlternatively, x = 70, y = 40, z = 0, but z can't be zero if |B \u2229 C| must be at least some value.\n\nWait, actually, if z = 0, then |B \u2229 C| = 0, which is allowed.\n\nSo, x = 70, y = 40, z = 0 sums to 110.\n\nBut does this make sense in the context of the problem?\n\nLet\u2019s check the total number of distinct people.\n\nPeople in A: 80 = only A + |A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| = only A + 70 + 40 - 0 = only A + 110\n\nBut only A cannot be negative, which suggests a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nLet\u2019s think about the principle of inclusion-exclusion again.\n\nWith |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| = 0, we have:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = 80 + 70 + 60 - x - y - z = 210 - 110 = 100\n\nThis matches the total number of people, so it's possible.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried to find only A, it seemed to give a negative number.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nOnly A = |A| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| = 80 - 70 - 40 + 0 = -30\n\nThis is impossible because you can't have negative people.\n\nTherefore, it's not possible to have |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| = 0.\n\nSo, the assumption that |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| = 0 leads to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| must be at least 10.\n\nWait, how did I get 10?\n\nLet me recalculate.\n\nFrom only A = 80 - x - y + w\n\nGiven w = |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nSo, only A = 80 - x - y + w\n\nSimilarly, only B = 70 - x - z + w\n\nOnly C = 60 - y - z + w\n\nAnd people speaking exactly two languages:\n\nexactly AB = x - w\n\nExactly AC = y - w\n\nExactly BC = z - w\n\nTotal people:\n\nonly A + only B + only C + exactly AB + exactly AC + exactly BC + all three = 100\n\nPlugging in:\n\n(80 - x - y + w) + (70 - x - z + w) + (60 - y - z + w) + (x - w) + (y - w) + (z - w) + w = 100\n\nSimplify:\n\n80 - x - y + w + 70 - x - z + w + 60 - y - z + w + x - w + y - w + z - w + w = 100\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(80 + 70 + 60) + (-x - y - z) + (w + w + w - w - w - w + w) = 100\n\n210 - (x + y + z) + w = 100\n\nBut from earlier, x + y + z = 110 - w\n\nSo, 210 - (110 - w) + w = 100\n\n210 - 110 + w + w = 100\n\n100 + 2w = 100\n\nTherefore, 2w = 0 \u21d2 w = 0\n\nBut we already saw that w cannot be zero because it leads to negative values for only A.\n\nThis suggests that our assumption is incorrect, and there must be a minimal w greater than zero.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that x + y + z = 110 - w, and plug that back.\n\nWait, from earlier:\n\nx + y + z = |A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C| = 110 + w\n\nBut from the inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = 210 - (x + y + z) + w = 210 - (110 + w) + w = 100\n\nWhich holds true.\n\nBut earlier, only A = 80 - x - y + w\n\nIf w = 0, and x + y = 70 + 40 = 110, then only A = 80 - 110 + 0 = -30, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, w must be at least 10 to make only A non-negative.\n\nSo, let's set only A = 0, then:\n\n80 - x - y + w = 0 \u21d2 x + y - w = 80\n\nBut x + y + z = 110 + w\n\nIf x + y - w = 80, then x + y = 80 + w\n\nPlugging into x + y + z = 110 + w:\n\n(80 + w) + z = 110 + w \u21d2 z = 30\n\nSimilarly, only B = 70 - x - z + w \u2265 0\n\n70 - x - 30 + w \u2265 0 \u21d2 40 - x + w \u2265 0 \u21d2 x \u2264 40 + w\n\nOnly C = 60 - y - z + w \u2265 0\n\n60 - y - 30 + w \u2265 0 \u21d2 30 - y + w \u2265 0 \u21d2 y \u2264 30 + w\n\nAlso, x + y = 80 + w\n\nSo, y = 80 + w - x\n\nPlugging into y \u2264 30 + w:\n\n80 + w - x \u2264 30 + w \u21d2 80 - x \u2264 30 \u21d2 x \u2265 50\n\nBut earlier, x \u2264 40 + w\n\nSo, x \u2265 50 and x \u2264 40 + w\n\nTo satisfy both, 50 \u2264 x \u2264 40 + w\n\nBut x cannot be greater than |A \u2229 B| = 70\n\nSo, 50 \u2264 x \u2264 70\n\nAnd 50 \u2264 40 + w \u21d2 w \u2265 10\n\nTherefore, the minimal w is 10.\n\nSo, the minimal number of people who speak all three languages is 10.\n\nLet me verify this.\n\nIf w = 10, then:\n\nx + y = 80 + 10 = 90\n\nz = 30\n\nOnly A: 80 - x - y + 10 = 80 - 90 + 10 = 0\n\nOnly B: 70 - x - z + 10 = 70 - x - 30 + 10 = 50 - x\n\nOnly C: 60 - y - z + 10 = 60 - y - 30 + 10 = 40 - y\n\nPeople speaking exactly two languages:\n\nExactly AB: x - 10\n\nExactly AC: y - 10\n\nExactly BC: z - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20\n\nAll three: 10\n\nTotal people:\n\n0 + (50 - x) + (40 - y) + (x - 10) + (y - 10) + 20 + 10 = 100\n\nSimplify:\n\n0 + 50 - x + 40 - y + x - 10 + y - 10 + 20 + 10 = 100\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(50 + 40 - 10 - 10 + 20 + 10) + (-x + x - y + y) = 100\n\n(100) + 0 = 100\n\nYes, it checks out.\n\nAlso, check the overlaps:\n\nOverlaps = x + y + z - 2w = 90 + 30 - 20 = 100\n\nBut earlier, we have overlaps = 110\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating overlaps.\n\nWait, actually, overlaps = x + y + z - 2w = 90 + 30 - 20 = 100, but earlier we have overlaps = 110\n\nThis suggests an inconsistency.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recall that overlaps = x + y + z - 2w\n\nSet equal to 110:\n\nx + y + z - 2w = 110\n\nPlugging in x + y = 90, z = 30, w = 10:\n\n90 + 30 - 20 = 100, which is less than 110.\n\nThis indicates a problem.\n\nSo, perhaps w cannot be 10.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust my earlier assumption.\n\nLet me go back.\n\nFrom x + y = 80 + w\n\nAnd x + y + z = 110 + w\n\nThen z = 30\n\nNow, overlaps = x + y + z - 2w = (110 + w) - 2w = 110 - w\n\nSet equal to 110:\n\n110 - w = 110 \u21d2 w = 0\n\nBut earlier, w cannot be zero due to negative only A.\n\nTherefore, there is no solution with w = 0.\n\nThis suggests that our initial assumption is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal w is higher.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal w is 10, but then overlaps = 110 - 10 = 100, which is less than required 110.\n\nThis suggests that w needs to be adjusted.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to set overlaps = x + y + z - 2w = 110\n\nAnd x + y + z = 110 + w\n\nThen, 110 + w - 2w = 110 - w = 110\n\nThus, w = 0\n\nBut w cannot be zero, as we saw earlier.\n\nThis suggests that there is no solution with w = 0, and hence, the assumption that w can be zero is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the minimal w must be such that overlaps = 110 - w \u2264 110\n\nBut overlaps must be exactly 110, so 110 - w = 110 \u21d2 w = 0, which is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is no solution, which contradicts the problem's premise.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that |A \u222a B \u222a C| might be less than 100.\n\nBut the problem states there are 100 people, so |A \u222a B \u222a C| \u2264 100\n\nBut in reality, it must be equal to 100, assuming everyone speaks at least one language.\n\nSo, |A \u222a B \u222a C| = 100\n\nThen, from inclusion-exclusion:\n\n210 - (x + y + z) + w = 100 \u21d2 x + y + z - w = 110\n\nBut earlier, x + y + z = 110 + w\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\n110 + w - w = 110, which holds true.\n\nBut from overlaps = x + y + z - 2w = 110 + w - 2w = 110 - w\n\nAnd overlaps must be equal to 110, so 110 - w = 110 \u21d2 w = 0, which is invalid.\n\nThis suggests a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the minimal w is such that only A, only B, only C are non-negative.\n\nFrom only A = 80 - x - y + w \u2265 0\n\nOnly B = 70 - x - z + w \u2265 0\n\nOnly C = 60 - y - z + w \u2265 0\n\nWith x + y = 80 + w\n\nAnd z = 30\n\nPlugging into only B:\n\n70 - x - 30 + w \u2265 0 \u21d2 40 - x + w \u2265 0 \u21d2 x \u2264 40 + w\n\nOnly C:\n\n60 - y - 30 + w \u2265 0 \u21d2 30 - y + w \u2265 0 \u21d2 y \u2264 30 + w\n\nAlso, x + y = 80 + w\n\nSo, y = 80 + w - x\n\nPlugging into y \u2264 30 + w:\n\n80 + w - x \u2264 30 + w \u21d2 80 - x \u2264 30 \u21d2 x \u2265 50\n\nAlso, x \u2264 40 + w\n\nSo, 50 \u2264 x \u2264 40 + w\n\nTo satisfy both, 50 \u2264 40 + w \u21d2 w \u2265 10\n\nTherefore, the minimal w is 10.\n\nLet\u2019s set w = 10\n\nThen, x \u2265 50 and x \u2264 50 (since x \u2264 40 + 10 = 50)\n\nTherefore, x = 50\n\nThen, y = 80 + 10 - 50 = 40\n\nZ = 30\n\nNow, check only B:\n\n70 - x - z + w = 70 - 50 - 30 + 10 = 0\n\nOnly C:\n\n60 - y - z + w = 60 - 40 - 30 + 10 = 0\n\nOnly A:\n\n80 - x - y + w = 80 - 50 - 40 + 10 = 0\n\nPeople speaking exactly two languages:\n\nExactly AB: x -
