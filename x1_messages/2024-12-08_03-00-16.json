        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that. In JavaScript, to count the occurrences of each element in an array, you can use an object to keep track of the counts. Here's a step-by-step explanation and a sample function to achieve this:\n\n1. **Initialize an empty object** to store the counts of each element.\n2. **Iterate over each element** in the array.\n3. **Check if the element exists** as a key in the object.\n   - If it does, **increment its count**.\n   - If it doesn't, **add it to the object with a count of 1**.\n4. **Return the object** containing the counts.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```javascript\nfunction countOccurrences(arr) {\n  const counts = {};\n  arr.forEach(element => {\n    if (counts[element]) {\n      counts[element]++;\n    } else {\n      counts[element] = 1;\n    }\n  });\n  return counts;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst array = ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'banana'];\nconsole.log(countOccurrences(array));\n// Output: { apple: 2, banana: 3, orange: 1 }\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start with an empty object `counts`.\n2. **Iteration**: We use the `forEach` method to iterate over each element in the array.\n3. **Counting**:\n   - For each element, we check if it already exists as a key in the `counts` object.\n   - If it does, we increment its value by 1.\n   - If it doesn't, we add it to the object with a value of 1.\n4. **Return**: Finally, we return the `counts` object which now holds the count of each element in the array.\n\nThis method is efficient and straightforward for counting occurrences of elements in an array using JavaScript."
