        "content": "So in this problem, there's a class of 40 students, and 70% of them passed a math test. First, I need to find out how many students that is. To do that, I can calculate 70% of 40.\n\nLet me see: 70% of 40 is 0.7 times 40, which is 28 students. So, 28 students passed the test initially.\n\nNow, the problem says that if 5 more students had passed the test, what would have been the new percentage? So, if 5 more students passed, that would mean 28 plus 5, which is 33 students passed.\n\nNow, I need to find out what percentage 33 students is of the total 40 students. To find the percentage, I can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{part}}{\\text{whole}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the \"part\" is 33 students, and the \"whole\" is 40 students. So, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{33}{40} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate that. First, 33 divided by 40 is 0.825. Then, multiplied by 100 to get the percentage: 0.825 times 100 is 82.5%.\n\nSo, if 5 more students had passed the test, the new percentage of students who passed would be 82.5%.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check my calculations. Starting with 40 students, 70% passed: 0.7 times 40 is indeed 28. Adding 5 more students who passed makes it 33. Then, 33 divided by 40 is 0.825, and 0.825 times 100 is 82.5%. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of the increase in percentage. Each student represents what percentage of the total class? Since the total class is 40 students, one student is equal to \\frac{1}{40} times 100%, which is 2.5%. So, if 5 more students passed, that's an additional 5 times 2.5%, which is 12.5%. Adding that to the original 70% would give 70% plus 12.5%, which is 82.5%. That matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident it's correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the difference between the new number of students who passed and the original number. So, 33 minus 28 is 5, which is the additional students who passed. As I just calculated, that's an increase of 12.5% over the original pass rate.\n\nBut the question is asking for the new percentage, not the increase. So, the new percentage is 82.5%.\n\nI think that's the answer. But to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. The class has 40 students, 70% passed. That's 28 students. If 5 more students had passed, that's 33 students. What percentage is that of the total class? It's 33 out of 40, which is indeed 82.5%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the class size could change, but no, it says \"in a class of 40 students,\" so the total number is fixed at 40.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the 5 additional students passing are in addition to the original 28, or if it's a separate group. But the problem says \"if 5 more students had passed,\" which implies adding to the original number who passed.\n\nSo, no, my initial approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the new percentage of students who passed would be 82.5%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{82.5\\%} \\]"
