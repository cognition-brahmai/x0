        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 people in the family: two sets of twins and one other person. In each set of twins, one has brown eyes and the other has blue eyes. So, for the two sets of twins, that's four people: two with brown eyes and two with blue eyes. Then there's the fifth person with green eyes.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in each set of twins, one has brown eyes and the other has blue eyes. So, first set of twins: one brown, one blue. Second set of twins: one brown, one blue. And then the fifth person has green eyes.\n\nSo, total people:\n\n- First twin set: brown and blue\n\n- Second twin set: brown and blue\n\n- Fifth person: green\n\nSo, total brown-eyed people: two (one from each twin set).\n\nTotal people: five.\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen person has brown eyes would be the number of brown-eyed people divided by the total number of people, which is 2/5.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure. Is there any other way to interpret this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the twins share the same eye color, but according to the statement, one twin from each set has brown eyes and the other has blue eyes. So, it's not that each set of twins has both brown eyes or both blue eyes, but rather each set has one brown and one blue.\n\nSo, yes, two brown-eyed people out of five total people.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 2/5, which is 0.4 or 40%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{5}} \\]"
