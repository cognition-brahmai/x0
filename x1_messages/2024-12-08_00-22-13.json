        "content": "Let's see. So, in this school election, there are two candidates: candidate X and candidate Y. Candidate X got 60% of the total votes, and candidate Y got the remaining votes. The total number of votes cast was 1,200. I need to find out how many more votes candidate X received compared to candidate Y.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how many votes each candidate received. Since candidate X got 60% of the votes, I can calculate that by taking 60% of 1,200. Then, candidate Y must have got the remaining 40% of the votes, which I can also calculate.\n\nSo, votes for candidate X = 60% of 1,200.\n\nVotes for candidate Y = 40% of 1,200.\n\nThen, to find out how many more votes candidate X received than candidate Y, I can subtract the votes for candidate Y from the votes for candidate X.\n\nLet me do the math.\n\nFirst, 60% of 1,200:\n\n(60/100) * 1,200 = 0.6 * 1,200 = 720 votes.\n\nNow, 40% of 1,200:\n\n(40/100) * 1,200 = 0.4 * 1,200 = 480 votes.\n\nSo, candidate X received 720 votes, and candidate Y received 480 votes.\n\nNow, to find the difference:\n\n720 - 480 = 240 votes.\n\nTherefore, candidate X received 240 more votes than candidate Y.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe there's a simpler way to find the difference without calculating each candidate's votes separately.\n\nLet's see. The difference in their percentages is 60% - 40% = 20%. So, the difference in votes should be 20% of the total votes.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n20% of 1,200 = (20/100) * 1,200 = 0.2 * 1,200 = 240 votes.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI think that's the correct answer: candidate X received 240 more votes than candidate Y.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
