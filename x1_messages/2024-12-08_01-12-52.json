        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a box with 3 red balls and 2 green balls, making a total of 5 balls. We're drawing two balls randomly without replacement, and we want to find the probability that both balls are of the same color.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to draw two balls without replacement. This means that once I draw the first ball, it doesn't go back into the box, so the total number of balls decreases by one for the second draw.\n\nThe problem is about finding the probability that both balls are the same color. That means either both are red or both are green. So, I can think of this as two separate events and then add their probabilities together.\n\nLet's start by finding the probability that both balls are red.\n\nThere are 3 red balls out of 5 total balls. So, the probability of drawing a red ball first is 3/5.\n\nAfter drawing one red ball, there are now 2 red balls left and a total of 4 balls remaining in the box. So, the probability of drawing a second red ball is 2/4 or 1/2.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening (drawing two red balls in a row without replacement), I multiply the probabilities:\n\nP(both red) = (3/5) * (1/2) = 3/10.\n\nNow, let's find the probability that both balls are green.\n\nThere are 2 green balls out of 5 total balls. So, the probability of drawing a green ball first is 2/5.\n\nAfter drawing one green ball, there is now 1 green ball left and a total of 4 balls remaining in the box. So, the probability of drawing a second green ball is 1/4.\n\nAgain, to find the probability of both events happening (drawing two green balls in a row without replacement), I multiply the probabilities:\n\nP(both green) = (2/5) * (1/4) = 2/20 = 1/10.\n\nNow, since these two events are mutually exclusive (they can't happen at the same time), I can add their probabilities to find the total probability that both balls are the same color:\n\nP(both same color) = P(both red) + P(both green) = 3/10 + 1/10 = 4/10 = 2/5.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using combinations?\n\nYes, I can use combinations to find the probability. The total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 5 is C(5,2), which is 10.\n\nThe number of ways to draw 2 red balls out of 3 is C(3,2), which is 3.\n\nThe number of ways to draw 2 green balls out of 2 is C(2,2), which is 1.\n\nSo, the total number of favorable outcomes is 3 (for red) + 1 (for green) = 4.\n\nTherefore, the probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes: 4/10 = 2/5.\n\nThis matches the result I got earlier using the step-by-step approach.\n\nLet me double-check if I'm missing anything. Is there any other way this could be interpreted? For example, could the balls be drawn with replacement? No, the problem specifically says \"without replacement,\" so that's correct.\n\nAlso, ensure that the colors are the only distinctions between the balls, and that all balls are equally likely to be drawn.\n\nYes, that seems to be the case here.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 2/5.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Maybe finding the probability that the two balls are of different colors and then subtracting that from 1.\n\nFirst, find P(one red and one green).\n\nThis can happen in two ways: first red then green, or first green then red.\n\nP(first red, then green) = (3/5) * (2/4) = 3/10.\n\nP(first green, then red) = (2/5) * (3/4) = 3/10.\n\nSo, P(different colors) = 3/10 + 3/10 = 6/10 = 3/5.\n\nThen, P(same color) = 1 - P(different colors) = 1 - 3/5 = 2/5.\n\nAgain, the same result. This gives me confidence that 2/5 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{5}} \\]"
