        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 houses on one side of the street and 5 on the other, making a total of 15 houses. Each house has a different number of occupants, ranging from 1 to 15 people, and the total number of occupants in all houses is exactly 120. We need to find out how many people live in the house with the highest number of occupants.\n\nFirst, since each house has a different number of occupants ranging from 1 to 15, the occupants in the houses must be the numbers from 1 to 15, each used exactly once. The sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula n(n+1)/2. So, the sum of numbers from 1 to 15 is 15*16/2 = 120. That matches the total number of occupants given, which is 120.\n\nWait a minute, if the sum of occupants from 1 to 15 is exactly 120, and that's the total number of occupants, then it seems like we can just assign each house a unique number of occupants from 1 to 15, and the house with the highest number of occupants would have 15 people.\n\nBut let's double-check if there are any constraints I might have missed. The problem says there are 10 houses on one side and 5 on the other, but it doesn't specify any particular arrangement or additional constraints beyond the total number of occupants being 120 and each house having a different number of occupants between 1 and 15.\n\nGiven that, and since the sum of 1 to 15 is indeed 120, it seems straightforward that the house with the highest number of occupants has 15 people.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a trick here. Maybe the distribution of houses on both sides of the street affects the arrangement. But the problem doesn't specify any constraints based on the sides of the street, so I don't think that's relevant.\n\nAnother way to look at it: if we have to assign unique numbers of occupants from 1 to 15 to 15 houses, and the sum is 120, then the highest possible number of occupants in any single house is 15.\n\nBut maybe the question is trying to ask something else. Let's see if there's another interpretation.\n\nSuppose we consider that the houses on one side have more occupants than the other. But again, without specific constraints, I don't think that affects the highest number of occupants.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation of the range \"1 to 15 people.\" Does it mean that the number of occupants in each house is between 1 and 15, inclusive, and all are distinct?\n\nYes, that's what it says.\n\nSo, with distinct occupants per house from 1 to 15, and total sum 120, the highest number is 15.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is to find the maximum possible occupants in the highest house given the constraints.\n\nBut in this case, since all numbers from 1 to 15 are used exactly once, the highest number is inevitably 15.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is to find the number of occupants in the house with the highest number, given that the sum is 120 and all houses have distinct occupants from 1 to 15.\n\nIn that case, again, the highest is 15.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe there's a way to arrange the numbers differently.\n\nWait, suppose some houses have fewer occupants, could that make the highest number higher than 15?\n\nBut the problem states that the number of occupants ranges from 1 to 15, and each house has a different number. So, the numbers must be unique from 1 to 15.\n\nTherefore, the highest number of occupants in any house is 15.\n\nAlternatively, if the range \"1 to 15\" means that the minimum is 1 and the maximum is 15, but not necessarily using all numbers from 1 to 15, then that changes things.\n\nWait, the problem says \"each house has a different number of occupants, ranging from 1 to 15 people.\" That could be interpreted as the number of occupants in each house is a unique integer between 1 and 15, inclusive.\n\nIf that's the case, then again, the highest number is 15.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to interpret this.\n\nSuppose that the range \"1 to 15\" means that the smallest number of occupants in any house is 1 and the largest is 15, but not necessarily that all numbers from 1 to 15 are used, just that each house has a different number within that range.\n\nHowever, the problem also states that each house has a different number of occupants, so likely, it means that the numbers are unique and span from 1 to 15.\n\nGiven that, the highest number is 15.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mathematical way to confirm this.\n\nLet's calculate the sum of the first 15 natural numbers: 1+2+3+...+15.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this sum is 15*16/2 = 120.\n\nSince the total number of occupants is exactly 120, and the sum of occupants from 1 to 15 is also 120, it confirms that all numbers from 1 to 15 are used exactly once.\n\nTherefore, the house with the highest number of occupants has 15 people.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
