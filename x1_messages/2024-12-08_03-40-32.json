        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, there's a company with 150 employees. Out of these, 60% work full-time, and the remaining work part-time. Full-time employees work 40 hours per week, while part-time employees work 20 hours per week. We need to find the total number of hours worked by all employees in one week.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many employees are full-time and how many are part-time. Since 60% of the employees are full-time, I can calculate the number of full-time employees by taking 60% of 150.\n\nNumber of full-time employees = 60% of 150 = 0.60 \u00d7 150 = 90 employees\n\nNow, the rest of the employees are part-time. So, the number of part-time employees would be the total employees minus the full-time employees.\n\nNumber of part-time employees = 150 - 90 = 60 employees\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total hours worked by full-time employees and the total hours worked by part-time employees separately, and then add them together to get the total hours for the entire company.\n\nTotal hours by full-time employees = number of full-time employees \u00d7 hours per week = 90 \u00d7 40 = 3600 hours\n\nTotal hours by part-time employees = number of part-time employees \u00d7 hours per week = 60 \u00d7 20 = 1200 hours\n\nNow, add these two totals together to get the overall total hours worked in one week.\n\nTotal hours worked = 3600 + 1200 = 4800 hours\n\nSo, the total number of hours worked by all employees in one week is 4800 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4800} \\]"
