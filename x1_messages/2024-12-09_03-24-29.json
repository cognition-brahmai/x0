        "content": "The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the formula for perimeter is P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width.\n\nGiven that the length (L) is 10 meters and the width (W) is 6 meters, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP = 2(10) + 2(6)\n\nFirst, multiply 2 by the length:\n\n2 * 10 = 20 meters\n\nThen, multiply 2 by the width:\n\n2 * 6 = 12 meters\n\nNow, add these two results together to get the total perimeter:\n\n20 meters + 12 meters = 32 meters\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the garden is 32 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]"
