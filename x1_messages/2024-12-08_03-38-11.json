        "content": "So the factory produces 500 units of product A and 700 units of product B every day. Each unit of product A needs 2 hours of labor, and each unit of product B needs 3 hours of labor. I need to find out the total hours of labor required for both products combined each day.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the labor hours for product A alone. Since each unit of product A requires 2 hours of labor, and they produce 500 units daily, I can multiply the number of units by the labor hours per unit. So, that's 500 units times 2 hours per unit.\n\n500 * 2 = 1000 hours.\n\nThat means 1000 hours of labor are needed for product A each day.\n\nNext, I'll do the same for product B. Each unit of product B requires 3 hours of labor, and they produce 700 units daily. So, 700 units times 3 hours per unit.\n\n700 * 3 = 2100 hours.\n\nSo, 2100 hours of labor are needed for product B each day.\n\nNow, to find the total labor hours for both products combined, I just need to add the labor hours for product A and product B together.\n\n1000 hours (for A) + 2100 hours (for B) = 3100 hours.\n\nTherefore, the factory requires 3100 hours of labor each day for the production of both products.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer?\n\nMaybe I can think in terms of total units and average labor hours, but that might be more complicated. Or, I could consider the labor hours per product and then sum them up, which is essentially what I did.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total labor hours using a formula like:\n\nTotal labor = (units of A * labor per A) + (units of B * labor per B)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal labor = (500 * 2) + (700 * 3) = 1000 + 2100 = 3100 hours.\n\nYeah, that matches what I did earlier.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there any overhead labor or is there any dependency between the production of A and B that might affect labor hours? The question doesn't mention anything like that, so I think assuming independent labor requirements for each product is fine.\n\nAlso, the production numbers are given per day, so the time frame is consistent.\n\nSo, I think 3100 hours is the correct total labor hours required daily for both products.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3100} \\]"
