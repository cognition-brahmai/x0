        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, Jane read 30 pages on Monday. That's easy.\n\nOn Tuesday, she read twice as many pages as she did on Monday. So, twice 30 pages would be 60 pages.\n\nThen, on Wednesday, she read half as many pages as she did on Tuesday. So, half of 60 pages is 30 pages.\n\nNow, to find the total pages she read over the three days, I just need to add up the pages from each day: 30 pages on Monday, 60 pages on Tuesday, and 30 pages on Wednesday.\n\nSo, 30 + 60 + 30 equals... let's see, 30 plus 30 is 60, and then plus another 60 makes 120.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let me do that again. 30 plus 60 is 90, and then plus another 30 makes 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, Jane read a total of 120 pages over the three days.\n\nBut let me double-check. Monday: 30 pages. Tuesday: twice that, so 60 pages. Wednesday: half of Tuesday, so 30 pages. Total: 30 + 60 + 30 = 120 pages.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
