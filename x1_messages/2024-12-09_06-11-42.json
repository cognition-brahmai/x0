        "content": "Let's see. The original price of the product is $150 per unit. During the sale, they're offering a discount of 15% on each unit. I need to find out what the new price per unit will be after applying this discount.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a 15% discount means. A percentage discount is a reduction in the original price, and it's calculated based on the percentage of the original price.\n\nSo, to find the discount amount, I can calculate 15% of $150.\n\nLet me recall how to calculate percentages. To find a percentage of a number, I can use the formula:\n\nDiscount Amount = (Discount Percentage / 100) * Original Price\n\nIn this case, the discount percentage is 15, and the original price is $150.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDiscount Amount = (15 / 100) * 150\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n15 divided by 100 is 0.15.\n\nThen, 0.15 multiplied by 150 is... let's see, 0.15 times 100 is 15, and 0.15 times 50 is 7.5. So, 15 plus 7.5 is 22.5.\n\nTherefore, the discount amount is $22.5.\n\nNow, to find the new price per unit, I need to subtract the discount amount from the original price.\n\nNew Price = Original Price - Discount Amount\n\nSo,\n\nNew Price = 150 - 22.5\n\nThat equals $127.5.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nDiscount Percentage = 15%\n\nOriginal Price = $150\n\nDiscount Amount = (15 / 100) * 150 = 0.15 * 150 = 22.5\n\nNew Price = 150 - 22.5 = 127.5\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that you can calculate the new price directly by multiplying the original price by (100% - discount percentage). Let me try that.\n\nSo, 100% - 15% = 85%\n\nThen, New Price = 85% of Original Price\n\nWhich is:\n\nNew Price = (85 / 100) * 150 = 0.85 * 150\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.85 times 100 is 85, and 0.85 times 50 is 42.5. So, 85 plus 42.5 is 127.5.\n\nAgain, $127.5.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, so I'm confident that's the correct new price per unit after the 15% discount.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nSuppose the company offers a discount of 15%, meaning the customer pays only 85% of the original price. So, again, that's 0.85 times $150, which is $127.5.\n\nAlternatively, if the discount was added to the price, that would be a price increase, which isn't the case here. Discounts reduce the price, so subtraction is the correct operation.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm not confusing this with other types of calculations, like profit margins or markups, but in this scenario, it's simply a percentage discount on the selling price.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the new price per unit after a 15% discount is $127.5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{127.5} \\]"
