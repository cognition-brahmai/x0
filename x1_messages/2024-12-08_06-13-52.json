So, if John is taller than Peter, and Mary is shorter than Peter, does that mean John is taller than Mary?\n\nWell, think about it this way: If John is taller than Peter, and Mary is shorter than Peter, then John is taller than Peter who is taller than Mary. So, John should be taller than Mary.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Maybe there's a scenario where Mary is actually taller than John.\n\nLet me consider some heights. Suppose Peter is 170 cm tall. Then, since John is taller than Peter, John could be, say, 180 cm. And Mary is shorter than Peter, so she could be, say, 160 cm. In this case, John (180 cm) is taller than Mary (160 cm).\n\nAnother scenario: Peter is 170 cm, John is 175 cm, and Mary is 165 cm. Still, John is taller than Mary.\n\nWhat if Peter is 170 cm, John is 180 cm, and Mary is 160 cm. Again, John is taller than Mary.\n\nIt seems like in all these cases, John is taller than Mary.\n\nIs there any possible way that Mary could be taller than John? Let's try to think of such a scenario.\n\nSuppose Peter is 170 cm, and John is 175 cm (taller than Peter). Now, Mary is shorter than Peter, so she has to be less than 170 cm. So, Mary could be 165 cm, which is still shorter than John's 175 cm.\n\nWait, but what if Peter is very short? Say Peter is 150 cm. Then John is taller than Peter, say 151 cm. And Mary is shorter than Peter, say 149 cm. So, John (151 cm) is still taller than Mary (149 cm).\n\nIs there a way that Mary could be taller than John? If Peter is, say, 100 cm, John is 101 cm, and Mary is 99 cm. Again, John is taller than Mary.\n\nIt looks like in all these examples, John is taller than Mary.\n\nSo, yes, it is true that John is taller than Mary.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yes, John is taller than Mary.}} \\]"
