        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular method for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. Even though it's typically used for graphs with non-negative edge weights, I'll provide you with a basic implementation that assumes all edge weights are positive.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You might also want to have a Python IDE or text editor ready.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to implementing Dijkstra's algorithm in Python:\n\n### Step 1: Represent the Graph\n\nWe'll represent the graph using an adjacency list, where each node maps to a list of its neighboring nodes and their corresponding edge weights.\n\n### Step 2: Implement Dijkstra's Algorithm\n\nWe'll use a priority queue to always expand the node with the smallest current distance from the start node.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Shortest Path\n\nOnce we have the distances, we can reconstruct the path from the start node to the end node.\n\n### Final Solution\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef dijkstra(graph, start, end):\n    # Priority queue to hold nodes to visit, initialized with the starting node\n    pq = [(0, start)]\n    # Dictionary to hold the shortest distance to each node\n    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}\n    distances[start] = 0\n    # Dictionary to hold the previous node in the shortest path\n    previous_nodes = {node: None for node in graph}\n    \n    while pq:\n        # Get the node with the smallest distance\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(pq)\n        \n        # Nodes can be added to the priority queue multiple times. We only\n        # process a node the first time we remove it from the priority queue.\n        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Explore each neighbor of the current node\n        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():\n            distance = current_distance + weight\n            # Only consider this new path if it's better\n            if distance < distances[neighbor]:\n                distances[neighbor] = distance\n                previous_nodes[neighbor] = current_node\n                # Add the neighbor to the priority queue\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))\n    \n    # Reconstruct the path\n    path = []\n    current = end\n    while current is not None:\n        path.append(current)\n        current = previous_nodes[current]\n    # Reverse the path to get from start to end\n    path = path[::-1]\n    \n    return path, distances[end]\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Example graph represented as an adjacency list\n    graph = {\n        'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},\n        'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},\n        'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},\n        'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}\n    }\n    \n    start_node = 'A'\n    end_node = 'D'\n    path, distance = dijkstra(graph, start_node, end_node)\n    print(f\"Shortest path from {start_node} to {end_node}: {path}\")\n    print(f\"Distance: {distance}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Graph Representation:** \n   - We use a dictionary where keys are nodes and values are dictionaries of neighbors and their edge weights.\n\n2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**\n   - We use a priority queue (min-heap) to always visit the node with the smallest known distance.\n   - We keep track of the shortest distances and the previous nodes in the path.\n   - We update the distances and previous nodes as we explore the graph.\n\n3. **Path Reconstruction:**\n   - We backtrack from the end node to the start node using the `previous_nodes` dictionary to construct the shortest path.\n\nThis implementation should work for undirected graphs with positive edge weights.
