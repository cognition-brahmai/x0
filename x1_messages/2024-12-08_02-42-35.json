        "content": "So, we've got this scenario here. There's a company with 120 employees, and they each work 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. That means each employee works 8 times 5, which is 40 hours per week. So, the total number of hours worked by all employees currently is 120 employees times 40 hours each, which is 4,800 hours per week.\n\nNow, the company decides to increase their workforce by 25%. So, we need to find out how many additional employees that corresponds to. 25% of 120 is calculated by 120 times 0.25, which is 30 employees. So, they're adding 30 more employees.\n\nEach of these new employees will also work 40 hours per week, just like the existing ones. Therefore, the additional hours worked weekly will be 30 employees times 40 hours each, which equals 1,200 hours.\n\nSo, the company will have an additional 1,200 hours worked weekly after increasing their workforce by 25%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1200} \\]"
