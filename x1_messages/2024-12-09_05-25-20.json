        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got 100 people standing in line to enter a theater, each with a ticket for a specific seat from 1 to 100. But here's the twist: the first person loses their ticket and picks a random seat to sit in. Then, everyone else follows the rule\u2014If their assigned seat is available, they take it; if not, they pick a random empty seat. The question is, what's the probability that the last person ends up in their correct seat, seat number 100?\n\nHmm, this seems like a tricky problem at first glance, but maybe there's a pattern or a simpler way to think about it. Let's try to break it down.\n\nFirst, consider what happens when the first person loses their ticket and picks a random seat. They could pick any seat from 1 to 100 with equal probability. Now, the second person comes in. If seat 2 is available, they take it; if not, they pick a random empty seat. This pattern continues down the line.\n\nI wonder if the position of the first person's choice affects the last person's seating arrangement. Let's think about some smaller cases to see if there's a pattern.\n\nLet's start with just 2 people. Person 1 loses their ticket and picks either seat 1 or seat 2 randomly. If they pick seat 1, then person 2 takes seat 2. If they pick seat 2, then person 2 has to take seat 1 since their seat is taken. So, the probability that person 2 gets their correct seat is 1/2.\n\nInteresting. Now, let's try with 3 people.\n\n- Person 1 picks a seat randomly: seat 1, 2, or 3, each with probability 1/3.\n\n- If person 1 picks seat 1, then person 2 takes seat 2, and person 3 takes seat 3. So, person 3 gets their seat.\n\n- If person 1 picks seat 2, then person 2 has to pick a random seat. At this point, seat 1 and seat 3 are available. If person 2 picks seat 1, then person 3 takes seat 3. If person 2 picks seat 3, then person 3 has to take seat 1. So, the probability that person 3 gets seat 3 is 1/2 in this scenario.\n\n- If person 1 picks seat 3, then person 2 takes seat 2, and person 3 is left with seat 1. So, person 3 does not get their seat.\n\nNow, compiling these:\n\n- Probability person 1 picks seat 1: 1/3, and person 3 gets seat 3.\n\n- Probability person 1 picks seat 2: 1/3, and person 3 gets seat 3 with probability 1/2.\n\n- Probability person 1 picks seat 3: 1/3, and person 3 does not get seat 3.\n\nSo, total probability that person 3 gets seat 3 is:\n\n(1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(1/2) + (1/3)*0 = 1/3 + 1/6 + 0 = 1/2.\n\nAgain, 1/2.\n\nHmm, interesting. With 2 people, it's 1/2, and with 3 people, it's also 1/2. Maybe this is a pattern?\n\nLet's try with 4 people to confirm.\n\n- Person 1 picks a seat randomly: seats 1, 2, 3, or 4, each with probability 1/4.\n\n- If person 1 picks seat 1, then everyone else takes their assigned seats, including person 4 taking seat 4.\n\n- If person 1 picks seat 2, then person 2 picks a random seat from seats 1, 3, and 4.\n\n- If person 2 picks seat 1, then person 3 takes seat 3, and person 4 takes seat 4.\n\n- If person 2 picks seat 3, then person 3 picks a random seat from seats 1 and 4.\n\n- If person 3 picks seat 1, person 4 takes seat 4.\n\n- If person 3 picks seat 4, person 4 is left with seat 1.\n\n- If person 2 picks seat 4, then person 3 takes seat 3, and person 4 is left with seat 1.\n\n- If person 1 picks seat 3, then person 2 takes seat 2, person 3 picks a random seat from seats 1 and 4.\n\n- If person 3 picks seat 1, person 4 takes seat 4.\n\n- If person 3 picks seat 4, person 4 is left with seat 1.\n\n- If person 1 picks seat 4, then person 2 takes seat 2, person 3 takes seat 3, and person 4 is left with seat 1.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total probability that person 4 gets seat 4:\n\n- Person 1 picks seat 1: probability 1/4, person 4 gets seat 4.\n\n- Person 1 picks seat 2: probability 1/4.\n\n- Then person 2 picks seat 1: probability 1/3, person 4 gets seat 4.\n\n- Person 2 picks seat 3: probability 1/3.\n\n- Then person 3 picks seat 1: probability 1/2, person 4 gets seat 4.\n\n- Person 3 picks seat 4: probability 1/2, person 4 does not get seat 4.\n\n- Person 2 picks seat 4: probability 1/3, person 4 does not get seat 4.\n\n- So, total for person 1 picks seat 2: (1/4)*(1/3*1 + 1/3*(1/2*1 + 1/2*0) + 1/3*0) = (1/4)*(1/3 + 1/3*(1/2) + 0) = (1/4)*(1/3 + 1/6) = (1/4)*(1/2) = 1/8.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider a general case with n people.\n\nDefine P(n) as the probability that the last person gets their correct seat in a line of n people.\n\nFrom the examples above:\n\nP(2) = 1/2\n\nP(3) = 1/2\n\nP(4) seems to be 1/2 as well, based on the messy calculation above.\n\nSo, maybe P(n) = 1/2 for any n?\n\nBut that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P(n) = 1/n? But no, for n=2, it's 1/2; for n=3, it's 1/2; for n=4, seemingly 1/2. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe P(n) = 1/(n-1) + something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a recursive pattern here.\n\nLet's try to find a recursive formula for P(n).\n\nConsider the first person's choice:\n\n- They pick seat 1: probability 1/n. Then everyone else, including the last person, gets their correct seat.\n\n- They pick seat n: probability 1/n. Then the last person cannot get their seat.\n\n- They pick seat k, where 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n-1: probability 1/n each.\n\nIn this case, person k finds their seat taken and has to choose a random seat from the remaining ones.\n\nThis seems complicated to model directly.\n\nMaybe there's a smarter way to look at this.\n\nLet me think about the last person's seat: seat n.\n\nThe last person will get their seat if it's still available when they enter.\n\nThat means, none of the previous people have taken seat n.\n\nBut, given the way the problem is set up, people only take a random seat if their assigned seat is taken.\n\nSo, it's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of cycles in permutations.\n\nThis problem is similar to the airport seating problem or the hat check problem.\n\nIn fact, it's a classic problem in probability, and the answer often surprises people.\n\nBased on what I recall, in this type of problem, the probability that the last person gets their correct seat is always 1/2, regardless of the number of seats, as long as the first person picks a seat randomly.\n\nWait, but is that true?\n\nLet me check with n=3 again to confirm.\n\nFrom earlier, with n=3, P(3) = 1/2.\n\nWith n=4, it seemed like P(4) = 1/2.\n\nSo, maybe it's always 1/2.\n\nBut I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability is 1/(n-1), but for n=3, that would be 1/2, for n=4, 1/3, which doesn't match our earlier result.\n\nWait, but in n=2, P(2) = 1/2, which would suggest that it's not 1/(n-1).\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's always 1/2, regardless of n.\n\nBut I need to find a general solution.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose that the first person picks seat k, where k can be from 1 to n.\n\nThen, person k will be the first one who finds their seat taken and has to choose a random seat.\n\nThis creates a sort of \"displacement\" in the seating arrangement.\n\nHowever, eventually, someone will sit in seat 1, because if not, there would be a cycle that doesn't include seat 1, which isn't possible in this setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the seating arrangement will form a derangement, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the fact that the last person will get their seat if and only if the first person didn't sit in their seat, and no one else displaces them.\n\nBut that seems too vague.\n\nLet me try to look for a pattern or a general formula.\n\nI recall that in such problems, the probability often simplifies to 1/2, but I need to confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability is always 1/2, regardless of the number of seats.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about it in terms of the first person choosing seat 1 or seat n.\n\nIf the first person chooses seat 1, then everyone else, including the last person, gets their correct seat.\n\nIf the first person chooses seat n, then the last person does not get their seat.\n\nIf the first person chooses any other seat k, then the problem reduces to a similar problem with n-k people.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when the first person chooses a seat, it effectively partitions the remaining seats into two groups: seats 1 to k-1 and seats k+1 to n, but I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I need to look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that, regardless of how many people are there, the last person will either get their seat or not, and the probability is 1/2.\n\nBut again, this seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability is always 1/2 because the last person has an equal chance of getting their seat or not, given the random choices made by previous people.\n\nBut I need a more concrete reasoning.\n\nLet me try to think about it in terms of the first person's choice.\n\nIf the first person sits in seat 1, then everyone gets their correct seat, including the last person.\n\nIf the first person sits in seat n, then the last person does not get their seat.\n\nIf the first person sits in any seat k between 1 and n, then person k will be the first one to choose a random seat, and so on.\n\nBut perhaps there's a symmetry here.\n\nConsider that, in the end, only two seats are possible for the last person: their own seat or the first person's seat.\n\nBecause, whichever seat the first person chose, it starts a chain reaction, but ultimately, the last person will either get their seat or the first person's seat.\n\nBut that seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about it in terms of pairs.\n\nIn reality, the probability that the last person gets their correct seat is equal to the probability that the first person did not choose their seat.\n\nBut again, that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the probability is always 1/2, and here's why:\n\nThe first person chooses a seat randomly.\n\nThen, every subsequent person takes their seat if available or chooses randomly.\n\nIn the end, the last person will either get their seat or the first person's seat, with equal probability.\n\nThus, the probability is 1/2.\n\nBut why is that the case?\n\nWait, perhaps because the first person's choice is random, and the chain\u53cd\u5e94 propagates in such a way that the last person's seat is equally likely to be taken or available.\n\nBut I need a better explanation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the fact that, in the end, only two seats remain: seat 1 and seat n.\n\nAnd the last person will get one of them randomly.\n\nHence, probability 1/2.\n\nBut is that accurate?\n\nWait, that can't be right, because there are more than two seats involved in the process.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that, by the time the last person arrives, whichever seat is left, it's equally likely to be seat 1 or seat n.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because there are more seats involved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the probability is always 1/2, regardless of the number of seats.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive for larger n.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a general formula.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern.\n\nFrom n=2: P(2) = 1/2\n\nFrom n=3: P(3) = 1/2\n\nFrom n=4: Based on my earlier messy calculation, it seems P(4) = 1/2\n\nSo, maybe P(n) = 1/2 for any n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P(n) = 1/n.\n\nBut for n=2, 1/2 = 1/2; for n=3, 1/3 \u2260 1/2; so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe P(n) = 1/(n-1).\n\nFor n=2: 1/1 = 1, which is not 1/2.\n\nFor n=3: 1/2, which matches.\n\nFor n=4: 1/3, which doesn't match my earlier conclusion of 1/2.\n\nSo, that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P(n) = 1/2 for n \u2265 2.\n\nBut I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of the first person choosing seat 1 or seat n, and the remaining choices don't affect the last person's seat.\n\nWait, let's consider that:\n\n- If the first person chooses seat 1, then everyone gets their correct seat, including the last person. Probability: 1/n.\n\n- If the first person chooses seat n, then the last person does not get their seat. Probability: 1/n.\n\n- If the first person chooses any other seat k (2 \u2264 k \u2264 n-1), then the problem reduces to a similar problem with n-k people.\n\nWait, perhaps I can formalize this.\n\nLet me define P(n) as the probability that the last person gets their correct seat in a line of n people.\n\nThen:\n\nP(n) = (probability first person chooses seat 1) * 1 + (probability first person chooses seat n) * 0 + \u03a3(from k=2 to n-1) (probability first person chooses seat k) * P(n-k)\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nActually, if the first person chooses seat k (where 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n-1), then person k will be the first one to choose a random seat from the remaining ones, effectively starting a new chain.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe P(n) = (1/n) * 1 + (1/n) * 0 + (n-2)/n * P(n-1)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P(n) = (1/n) * 1 + (1/n) * 0 + (n-2)/n * P(n-1)\n\nWait, that seems similar to what I just said.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe P(n) = (1/n) * 1 + (1/n) * 0 + (n-2)/n * P(n-1)\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that, when the first person chooses seat k, it reduces the problem to a smaller problem of size n-k+1.\n\nWait, perhaps P(n) = (1/n) * 1 + (1/n) * 0 + \u03a3(from k=2 to n-1) (1/n) * P(n - (k-1))\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe there's a different approach.\n\nLet me look for a pattern in the probabilities.\n\nFrom n=2: P(2) = 1/2\n\nn=3: P(3) = 1/2\n\nn=4: Seems like P(4) = 1/2\n\nSo, maybe P(n) = 1/2 for any n \u2265 2.\n\nIf that's the case, then for n=100, P(100) = 1/2.\n\nBut I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability is always 1/2, regardless of n.\n\nBut I need a more rigorous justification.\n\nLet me try to think about it differently.\n\nSuppose that, in the end, only two seats are left: seat 1 and seat n.\n\nThen, the last person will get one of them at random, so probability 1/2.\n\nBut is that accurate?\n\nWait, that seems plausible.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe first person chooses a seat randomly.\n\nThen, a chain reaction occurs where people take their seats if available or choose randomly.\n\nBut, in the end, only two seats are left: the first person's seat (seat 1) and the last person's seat (seat n).\n\nTherefore, the last person has an equal chance of getting either seat, making the probability 1/2.\n\nBut is this always true?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about it in terms of cycles.\n\nIn permutation terms, the seating arrangement can be seen as a permutation where the first person chooses a seat randomly, and others follow a specific rule.\n\nIn such permutations, the last person ends up in their correct seat or in the first person's seat, with equal probability.\n\nHence, P(n) = 1/2.\n\nThis seems to be a common result in such problems.\n\nTherefore, for n=100, the probability that the last person sits in seat 100 is 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]\n"
