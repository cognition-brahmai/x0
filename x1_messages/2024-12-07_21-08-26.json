        "content": "To find the average speed for the entire round trip, we need to consider both the outbound and return journeys. The average speed for the round trip isn't simply the average of the two speeds because the time spent traveling at each speed is different due to the varying speeds.\n\nHere's how to approach this problem step by step:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let the distance between City A and City B be \\( d \\) miles.\n\n2. **Calculate Time for Each Leg:**\n   - Time taken to travel from City A to City B (\\( t_1 \\)):\n     \\[\n     t_1 = \\frac{d}{60} \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n   - Time taken to travel back from City B to City A (\\( t_2 \\)):\n     \\[\n     t_2 = \\frac{d}{80} \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Distance:**\n   - The total distance for the round trip is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total distance} = 2d \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Total Time:**\n   - The total time for the round trip is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total time} = t_1 + t_2 = \\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{d}{80}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Combine the Times:**\n   - To add these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 80 is 240.\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d}{60} = \\frac{4d}{240}, \\quad \\frac{d}{80} = \\frac{3d}{240}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total time} = \\frac{4d}{240} + \\frac{3d}{240} = \\frac{7d}{240} \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Average Speed:**\n   - Average speed is total distance divided by total time.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}} = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{7d}{240}} = 2d \\times \\frac{240}{7d} = \\frac{480d}{7d} = \\frac{480}{7} \\text{ mph}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   - Calculate \\( \\frac{480}{7} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{480}{7} \\approx 68.5714 \\text{ mph}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the average speed for the entire round trip is approximately 68.57 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{68.57 \\text{ mph}} \\]"
