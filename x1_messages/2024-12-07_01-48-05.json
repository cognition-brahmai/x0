        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. So, you want to create a Golang application that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion. Additionally, it should validate the input and return an error message if the input is invalid.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a factorial is. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It's denoted by n!. For example, 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nNow, recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In the case of factorial, the recursive relation is n! = n \u00d7 (n-1)! with the base case being 0! = 1.\n\nAlright, let's start by setting up a simple Golang program. We'll need to take an integer input from the user, validate it to ensure it's a non-negative integer, and then compute its factorial using recursion.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Read input from the user.**\n2. **Validate the input to ensure it's a non-negative integer.**\n3. **If the input is valid, compute the factorial using recursion.**\n4. **If the input is invalid, return an appropriate error message.**\n\nLet's consider how to implement each step.\n\n### Step 1: Read input from the user\n\nIn Go, we can read input from the user using the `fmt` package's `Scanln` function. We'll read a string first and then try to convert it to an integer.\n\n### Step 2: Validate the input\n\nWe need to ensure that the input is a non-negative integer. This involves:\n\n- Checking if the input string can be converted to an integer.\n- Ensuring that the integer is non-negative.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the factorial using recursion\n\nWe'll define a recursive function that calculates the factorial. The base case is when n is 0, in which case the factorial is 1. For n > 0, the factorial is n multiplied by the factorial of n-1.\n\n### Step 4: Handle invalid input\n\nIf the input is not a non-negative integer, we'll print an error message.\n\nNow, let's think about potential issues and how to handle them.\n\n#### Potential issues:\n\n- **Negative integers:** We need to ensure that the input is non-negative.\n- **Non-integer input:** If the input is not an integer, we should handle that gracefully.\n- **Large numbers:** Factorials can grow very large very quickly. In Go, integers can handle up to 64-bit values, but factorials can exceed even that for relatively small n. For example, 20! is already too big for a 64-bit integer. We'll need to decide how to handle large inputs.\n\n#### Handling large numbers:\n\nOne approach is to use Go's `math/big` package, which provides arbitrary-precision integers. This way, we can compute factorials of larger numbers without worrying about integer overflow.\n\nHowever, for simplicity, we can limit our implementation to handle only small integers whose factorials fit within the standard `int64` type.\n\n#### Error handling:\n\nIn Go, we can use error\u8fd4\u56de values to handle errors gracefully. For this simple application, we'll just print error messages to the console.\n\n#### User experience:\n\nWe should provide clear instructions to the user on how to use the application and what kind of input is expected.\n\n#### Testing:\n\nWe should test the application with various inputs, including edge cases like 0, 1, and negative numbers, as well as non-integer inputs.\n\nNow, let's sketch out the code structure.\n\n### Code Structure\n\n1. **Main function:**\n   - Prompt the user for input.\n   - Read the input.\n   - Validate the input.\n   - If valid, compute the factorial using a recursive function.\n   - Print the result or an error message.\n\n2. **Recursive factorial function:**\n   - Base case: if n is 0, return 1.\n   - Recursive case: return n multiplied by the factorial of n-1.\n\n3. **Input validation:**\n   - Check if the input string can be converted to an integer.\n   - Check if the integer is non-negative.\n\n### Sample Code\n\nHere's a simple implementation without using the `math/big` package, assuming that the input is small enough that the factorial fits into an `int64`.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tvar input string\n\tfmt.Print(\"Enter a non-negative integer: \")\n\tfmt.Scanln(&input)\n\n\t// Validate input\n\tn, err := parseNonNegativeInt(input)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error:\", err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\t// Compute factorial\n\tfactorial, err := factorial(n)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error:\", err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tfmt.Printf(\"%d! = %d\\n\", n, factorial)\n}\n\nfunc parseNonNegativeInt(input string) (int64, error) {\n\tvar n int64\n\t_, err := fmt.Sscan(input, &n)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn 0, fmt.Errorf(\"invalid integer: %s\", input)\n\t}\n\tif n < 0 {\n\t\treturn 0, fmt.Errorf(\"number must be non-negative: %d\", n)\n\t}\n\treturn n, nil\n}\n\nfunc factorial(n int64) (int64, error) {\n\tif n > 20 { // 20! is the largest factorial that fits in int64\n\t\treturn 0, fmt.Errorf(\"input too large: %d\", n)\n\t}\n\tif n == 0 {\n\t\treturn 1, nil\n\t}\n\tf, err := factorial(n - 1)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn 0, err\n\t}\n\treturn n * f, nil\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Main function:**\n   - Prompts the user to enter a non-negative integer.\n   - Reads the input as a string.\n   - Parses and validates the input using `parseNonNegativeInt`.\n   - If the input is valid, computes the factorial using the `factorial` function.\n   - Prints the result or an error message.\n\n2. **parseNonNegativeInt function:**\n   - Attempts to convert the input string to an `int64`.\n   - Checks if the integer is non-negative.\n   - Returns an error if the input is invalid.\n\n3. **factorial function:**\n   - Implements the recursive factorial calculation.\n   - Handles the base case where n is 0.\n   - Checks if n is greater than 20 to prevent integer overflow.\n   - Recursively calls itself to compute factorial.\n\nThis should give you a good starting point for your Golang application to calculate factorials using recursion with input validation. If you need to handle larger numbers, consider using the `math/big` package for arbitrary-precision integers."
