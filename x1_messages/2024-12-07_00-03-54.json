        "content": "Let's see. There are 6 red balls and 4 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 10 balls. I need to find the probability that both balls I pick are red, and I'm putting the ball back each time. So, it's with replacement.\n\nFirst, I should find the probability of picking a red ball on the first draw. Since there are 6 red balls out of 10, the probability is 6/10, which simplifies to 3/5.\n\nNow, because I'm putting the ball back, the total number of balls remains the same for the second draw. So, the probability of picking a red ball on the second draw is also 3/5.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening together (both balls being red), I need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event. So, it should be (3/5) * (3/5).\n\nLet me calculate that: 3/5 * 3/5 = 9/25.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that I'm considering the replacement correctly. Since I'm putting the ball back, the probability doesn't change between draws, which seems to be the case here.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total number of possible outcomes. Since each draw is independent and there are 10 balls each time, there are 10 * 10 = 100 possible outcomes for two draws.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to pick a red ball both times. Since there are 6 red balls each time, it's 6 * 6 = 36.\n\nSo, the probability should be 36/100, which simplifies to 9/25.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there any other way to approach this problem?\n\nI could consider the probability of not picking a blue ball in both draws. The probability of not picking a blue ball in one draw is the same as picking a red ball, which is 3/5.\n\nSo, the probability of not picking a blue ball in both draws is (3/5) * (3/5) = 9/25.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of picking two red balls in a row with replacement.\n\nI think no matter how I look at it, the answer remains 9/25.\n\nLet me consider if there's any chance I'm missing something. Is there any dependency between the draws that I'm not accounting for? Since it's with replacement, and the problem states that I'm putting the ball back each time, the draws should be independent.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies that I look at the color each time, but that shouldn't affect the probability since I'm replacing the ball.\n\nWait, what if the act of looking at the color affects the selection process? But no, since I'm putting it back, the bag remains the same for each draw.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The straightforward approach is probably the correct one.\n\nSo, the probability is 9/25.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the general formula for probability with replacement.\n\nIf you have two independent events, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nHere, picking a red ball is an independent event each time, since it's with replacement.\n\nTherefore, P(both red) = P(red on first draw) * P(red on second draw) = (3/5) * (3/5) = 9/25.\n\nYes, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{25}} \\]"
