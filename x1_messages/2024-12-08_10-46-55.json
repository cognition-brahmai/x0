        "content": "Let's see. The company has an annual revenue of $1,000,000. It spends 30% on salaries, 25% on rent, and 15% on marketing. I need to find out what percentage is left for other expenses or profit.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total percentage spent on salaries, rent, and marketing. Let's add those percentages up:\n\n30% (salaries) + 25% (rent) + 15% (marketing) = 70%\n\nSo, the company spends a total of 70% of its revenue on salaries, rent, and marketing.\n\nNow, to find out what's left, I need to subtract this 70% from the total revenue, which is 100%.\n\n100% - 70% = 30%\n\nTherefore, 30% of the revenue is left for other expenses or profit.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check that. Maybe I should calculate it in terms of actual dollars to confirm.\n\nThe revenue is $1,000,000.\n\nSalaries: 30% of $1,000,000 = $300,000\n\nRent: 25% of $1,000,000 = $250,000\n\nMarketing: 15% of $1,000,000 = $150,000\n\nTotal spent: $300,000 + $250,000 + $150,000 = $700,000\n\nLeftover: $1,000,000 - $700,000 = $300,000\n\nNow, to find the percentage of the leftover amount:\n\n($300,000 / $1,000,000) * 100% = 30%\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 30% of the revenue is left for other expenses or profit.\n\nI think that's straightforward. But maybe there's more to it. Perhaps there are implicit taxes or other mandatory deductions that aren't mentioned here. However, since the question doesn't specify any other expenses or deductions, I'll assume that only salaries, rent, and marketing are the expenses mentioned, and the remainder is what's left for other expenses or profit.\n\nAlternatively, if the company has taxes or other expenses, that would further reduce the percentage left. But based on the information provided, I can only work with what's given.\n\nSo, my final answer is 30%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30\\%} \\]"
