        "content": "So, there's this problem about a company with 500 employees. Out of these, 300 are full-time, and the rest are part-time. I need to find out what percentage of the workforce is part-time. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many part-time employees there are. Since the total number of employees is 500 and 300 of them are full-time, I can subtract the full-time employees from the total to get the number of part-time employees.\n\nSo, part-time employees = total employees - full-time employees\nThat would be 500 - 300 = 200 part-time employees.\n\nNow, to find the percentage of part-time employees, I need to see what portion of the total workforce is part-time. Percentage is a way to express a part of a whole in terms of 100. So, I can use the formula:\n\nPercentage of part-time employees = (number of part-time employees / total employees) * 100\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nPercentage = (200 / 500) * 100\n\nLet me calculate that. 200 divided by 500 is 0.4. Then, 0.4 multiplied by 100 is 40%.\n\nSo, 40% of the workforce is part-time.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. If there are 300 full-time employees out of 500, that's 300/500 = 0.6, which is 60%. So, the remaining 40% should indeed be part-time. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the proportions. Full-time employees are 300 out of 500, which simplifies to 3/5, and 3/5 is equal to 60%. Therefore, part-time employees must be 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up a proportion. If 500 employees represent 100%, then each employee represents 100% / 500 = 0.2%. Therefore, 200 part-time employees would represent 200 * 0.2% = 40%.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same conclusion that 40% of the workforce is part-time. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40\\%} \\]"
