        "content": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about health economics, which is a part of economics that looks at health and healthcare issues. So, it's about how economics helps us understand health problems and healthcare systems.\n\nThe question is asking which of the options is NOT a typical area of study for a health economist. So, I need to identify which one among A, B, C, D, and E isn't usually something that health economists look into.\n\nLet's go through each option:\n\nA. The economic impact of smoking on public health.\n\nWell, smoking is a health-affecting behavior, and health economists study such behaviors. They look at how smoking affects health costs, productivity, and overall public health. So, this seems like something they would study.\n\nB. The cost-effectiveness of different healthcare systems.\n\nThis is right in their wheelhouse. Health economists compare different healthcare systems to see which ones provide the best value for money, which treatments are most cost-effective, and so on.\n\nC. The economic factors influencing obesity rates.\n\nAgain, obesity is a health issue, and health economists study how economic factors like prices, income, and policies affect health behaviors and outcomes. So, this is definitely something they look into.\n\nD. The impact of healthcare policies on patient outcomes.\n\nHealthcare policies are a big part of what health economists study. They analyze how policies affect access to care, quality of care, and ultimately, patient health outcomes.\n\nE. The design and construction of hospital facilities.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit different. While hospital facilities are part of the healthcare system, the design and construction aspect might be more related to architecture, engineering, or maybe facility management. I'm not sure if health economists directly study the design and construction of hospitals.\n\nWait, but health economists might look at the costs and benefits of different types of hospital facilities, or how facility design affects patient outcomes or efficiency. So, there might be some overlap.\n\nBut compared to the other options, which are clearly within the realm of health economics, this one seems a bit more tangential.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If I were to categorize these options, A, B, C, and D are all directly related to health behaviors, healthcare systems, and policies, which are core to health economics. Option E, while related to healthcare, seems more focused on the physical structure rather than the economic aspects.\n\nMaybe it's about distinguishing between the economic analysis of healthcare and the practical aspects of building hospitals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps hospital facility design is studied by health economists in terms of how it affects costs or outcomes, but maybe it's not a typical area of study compared to the others.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is E. The design and construction of hospital facilities is not a typical area of study for a health economist, at least not directly. It's more likely that they would study the economic implications of different facility designs rather than the design itself.\n\nSo, the answer is E.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{E} \\]"
