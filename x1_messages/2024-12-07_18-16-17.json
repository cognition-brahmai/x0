        "content": "Let's see. There are 7 days in a week, so in 3 weeks, there would be 3 times 7, which is 21 days. The factory produces 1200 units each day, so over 21 days, it would produce 1200 units per day times 21 days. Let me calculate that: 1200 multiplied by 21.\n\nWell, 12 times 21 is 252, so 1200 times 21 would be 25,200 units. So, the factory will produce 25,200 units in 3 weeks.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If the factory produces 1200 units per day, then in one week, which is 7 days, it would produce 1200 times 7, which is 8,400 units. So, in 3 weeks, it would be 8,400 units per week times 3, which is also 25,200 units. Yeah, that matches my first calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of total days. Since 3 weeks are 21 days, and the factory produces 1200 units each day, the total production would be 1200 units/day times 21 days, which again is 25,200 units.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any holidays or weekends where the factory might not be operating. The problem doesn't mention anything about the factory shutting down on weekends or any other days, so I'll assume it operates every day of the week.\n\nSome factories do operate 7 days a week, while others might have weekends off. But since there's no information provided about the factory's operating schedule, I'll stick with the assumption that it operates daily without breaks.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any constraints or limitations mentioned that might affect production, like machine breakdowns or labor issues. But again, the problem doesn't provide any such information, so I'll assume that production is consistent every day.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the factory produces 1200 units per day for 21 days, totaling 25,200 units in 3 weeks.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the units. The problem says \"units of a product,\" which is a general term and doesn't specify anything about the nature of the product or any special conditions that might affect production. So, no need to worry about that.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory has different shifts or varying production rates, but again, no information is provided about that, so I'll keep it simple.\n\nSome people might get confused about the number of days in 3 weeks, especially if they miscount the days. But since 1 week is 7 days, 3 weeks would be 21 days. Simple multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, if someone forgets about leap years or something, but since we're dealing with a standard 7-day week, that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAnother angle could be to consider the production in weeks first and then multiply by 3, which is what I did initially, and that matched my first approach, so that's reassuring.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be 25,200 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25200} \\]"
