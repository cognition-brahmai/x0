        "content": "That's pi! It's a very important number in math and science. It shows up in lots of different formulas and calculations, not just in geometry but also in things like physics and engineering. The value of pi is approximately 3.14159, but it's an irrational number, which means its decimal representation goes on forever without repeating. People have calculated pi to trillions of decimal places, but for most practical purposes, a few digits are enough. For example, in everyday calculations, using 3.14 or 22/7 is often sufficient. But in more precise scientific and engineering work, more decimal places are used to ensure accuracy. There are even competitions where people memorize as many digits of pi as they can. The world record is thousands of digits! It's fascinating how such a simple ratio has such a complex and infinite decimal expansion."
