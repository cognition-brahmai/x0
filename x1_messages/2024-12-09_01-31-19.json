        "content": "So the factory makes 1000 widgets every day, and each one has a 3% chance of being defective. I need to find out the expected number of defective widgets per day. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that \"expected value\" in probability is like the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents. So, if I have a bunch of trials (in this case, each widget is a trial), and each has a certain probability of success (or in this case, failure, since we're talking about defects), then the expected value is the number of trials times the probability of success on each trial.\n\nHere, the number of trials is 1000 widgets, and the probability of a defective widget is 3%, which is 0.03 in decimal form. So, expected number of defective widgets should be 1000 times 0.03.\n\nLet me calculate that: 1000 \u00d7 0.03 = 30.\n\nSo, the factory can expect to produce 30 defective widgets each day.\n\nBut wait, is there more to this? Is there a different way to look at it, maybe using binomial distribution or something like that?\n\nYeah, technically, the number of defective widgets in a day follows a binomial distribution, where each widget is a Bernoulli trial with success probability of 0.03. The expected value of a binomial distribution is n times p, where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of success on each trial.\n\nSo, again, that's 1000 \u00d7 0.03 = 30.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider if there's any other factor that could influence this. For example, are there any dependencies between the widgets? Does the defectiveness of one widget affect another? The problem doesn't suggest any dependencies, so I can assume that each widget's defectiveness is independent of the others.\n\nAlso, is the probability of being defective really constant at 3% for each widget? Again, the problem states that each widget has a 3% chance of being defective, so I'll assume that's constant.\n\nSo, based on this, the expected number is 30 defective widgets per day.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about what expected value really means here. It doesn't mean that every day exactly 30 widgets will be defective. Some days there might be more, some days less. But over a long period of time, the average number of defective widgets per day should approach 30.\n\nAlso, if the factory wants to reduce the number of defective widgets, they might look into quality control measures to lower that 3% defect rate.\n\nAlternatively, if they want to predict the probability of having more or fewer defects on a given day, they could use the binomial distribution to calculate those probabilities.\n\nBut for the purpose of this question, which is just to find the expected number, 30 seems to be the answer.\n\nLet me double-check my calculation: 1000 \u00d7 0.03. That's 1000 times 3%, which is 30. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the expected number of defective widgets produced each day is 30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
