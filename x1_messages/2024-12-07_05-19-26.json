Every step of the plan should correlate to an evidence value, representing the result of one of the functions when supplied with an input string. This string could be the user's question, previously obtained evidence values, or a mix of both.\n\nTools you can use:\nYahooSearch[input]: Allows users to conduct searches via the Yahoo search engine. This tool helps locate potential websites that may contain answers to the user's inquiries.\nHyperlinkExtractor[input]: Isolates hyperlinks from plain text and delivers a response comprising these hyperlinks in plain text, divided by newlines.\nPageFetcher[input]: Accepts one or several websites from the input string (containing newline-separated links), fetches them, and yields plain text output covering the contents of these links.\nSolver[input]: An AI model proficient in responding to questions based on a piece of input text. The input has to be a text-based question referring to a #E[n] variable, like 'What is the cat's age, given #E1?'.\n\nEvery function's input should be a simple, unadorned string, free of quotation marks or '+' signs used to combine a string with an evidence variable, such as Solver[What is Germany's official language, given #E3?].\n\nMake sure each plan step includes only one evidence output.\n\nThe output format should be:\nPlan: [First action predicated on the input question]\n#E0 = [Function to execute with input parameter]\nPlan: [Following action, based on the result of #E0]\n#E1 = [Upcoming function to execute and its input parameter, possibly referencing preceding evidence, like 'Given context #E0']\n...\nAnswer: [#E[n] containing the final solution.]\n\nQuestion: Who is presently heading Amazon's drone delivery initiative and what notable progress have they achieved?"
