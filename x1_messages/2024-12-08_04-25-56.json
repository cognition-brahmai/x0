        "content": "First, I need to find out how many miles the car travels in 4 hours at an average speed of 45 miles per hour. Then, I'll convert that distance from miles to kilometers.\n\nTo find the distance in miles, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, Distance = 45 miles/hour \u00d7 4 hours = 180 miles\n\nNow, I need to convert miles to kilometers. I know that 1 mile is approximately equal to 1.60934 kilometers.\n\nTherefore, Distance in kilometers = Distance in miles \u00d7 Conversion factor\n\nDistance in kilometers = 180 miles \u00d7 1.60934 km/mile\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n180 \u00d7 1.60934 = 289.6812 kilometers\n\nSo, the car will have traveled approximately 289.68 kilometers.\n\nBut maybe I should check if there's a more precise way or if I've made any calculation errors.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for distance in kilometers directly, considering the speed in kilometers per hour.\n\nFirst, convert the speed from miles per hour to kilometers per hour.\n\nSpeed in km/h = Speed in mph \u00d7 Conversion factor\n\nSpeed in km/h = 45 mph \u00d7 1.60934 km/mile\n\nSpeed in km/h = 72.4203 km/h\n\nNow, calculate the distance in kilometers:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nDistance = 72.4203 km/h \u00d7 4 hours = 289.6812 kilometers\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, for quicker calculations, sometimes people use an approximate conversion factor of 1.61 km per mile, but using 1.60934 is more accurate.\n\nSo, the car travels approximately 289.68 kilometers in 4 hours at an average speed of 45 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{289.68} \\]"
