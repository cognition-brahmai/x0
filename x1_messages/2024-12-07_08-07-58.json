        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a topological space X, and we need to prove that the empty set and X itself are both open sets in this space. Okay, first things first, I need to remember the definition of a topological space.\n\nA topological space is a set X paired with a collection of subsets, called a topology, that satisfies certain properties. These properties are:\n\n1. Both the empty set and X are in the topology.\n\n2. The union of any collection of sets in the topology is also in the topology.\n\n3. The intersection of any finite collection of sets in the topology is also in the topology.\n\nSo, if X is a topological space, then by definition, the empty set and X are part of its topology. And in a topological space, the sets in the topology are defined to be open sets. Therefore, the empty set and X are open by definition.\n\nWait a minute, is that all there is to it? It seems almost too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the question is asking for a proof from more fundamental principles, not just relying on the definition.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Maybe it's asking to prove that the empty set and X satisfy the conditions to be open sets based on the definition of openness in a topology.\n\nSo, in a topological space, a set is open if it is an element of the topology. But that seems circular. Maybe I need to recall how open sets are defined in terms of neighborhoods or interior points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the empty set and X in terms of their complements. In topology, a set is closed if its complement is open. Also, the empty set and X are both closed sets because their complements are X and the empty set, respectively, which should be open.\n\nBut then we're back to the same issue: to say that the empty set and X are closed because their complements are open, but we're trying to prove that the empty set and X are open in the first place.\n\nMaybe I need to look at the axioms of topology again. The first axiom explicitly states that the empty set and X are in the topology. So, if X is a topological space, then the topology on X includes both the empty set and X themselves.\n\nTherefore, since the topology is the collection of open sets by definition, both the empty set and X are open sets.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Perhaps considering basis elements or subbases, but that seems more complicated than necessary.\n\nLet me try to write this out more formally.\n\nProof:\n\nLet X be a topological space with topology T.\n\nBy definition of a topology, the empty set \u2205 and the whole space X are elements of T.\n\nSince the elements of T are defined to be the open sets in X, it follows that both \u2205 and X are open sets in X.\n\nTherefore, the empty set and X are both open sets in the topological space X.\n\nQ.E.D.\n\nThat seems concise and direct. But maybe the question is expecting more. Perhaps it wants me to consider the properties that make a set open, beyond just being in the topology.\n\nIn that case, maybe I should consider the definition of an open set in terms of interior points.\n\nIn some topological spaces, a set is open if every point in the set has a neighborhood contained entirely within the set.\n\nLet's apply this to the empty set and X.\n\nFirst, the empty set: it has no points, so the condition \"every point in the set has a neighborhood contained in the set\" is vacuously true because there are no points to check. Therefore, the empty set is open.\n\nSecond, the whole space X: for every point x in X, we need to find a neighborhood of x that is contained in X. But X contains all points, so any neighborhood of x is a subset of X. Therefore, X is open.\n\nThis seems like a solid argument.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the complement of the empty set is X, and the complement of X is the empty set, and if we assume that one of them is closed, then the other must be open. But again, this seems to rely on the definition already.\n\nWait, in topology, both the empty set and X are both open and closed. They are clopen sets. But to prove that they are open, perhaps it's sufficient to note that they satisfy the definition of openness.\n\nLet me see if there's another approach, maybe using the notion of a basis for the topology.\n\nA basis B for a topology on X is a collection of subsets of X such that:\n\n1. For each x in X, there is at least one basis element B containing x.\n\n2. If x is in the intersection of two basis elements B1 and B2, then there is a basis element B3 containing x that is contained in the intersection of B1 and B2.\n\nThen, the topology generated by B consists of all unions of elements of B.\n\nIf we consider the whole space X as a union of all basis elements, then X is in the topology, hence open.\n\nAs for the empty set, it can be considered as the union of no basis elements, which is always allowed in topology.\n\nTherefore, both X and the empty set are open.\n\nThis seems consistent with the earlier proof.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the definition of a topology in terms of the closure operator or the interior operator, but that might be overcomplicating things.\n\nAnother thought: in any topological space, the empty set and X are the trivial open sets.\n\nSimilarly, in a metric space, which is a special case of a topological space, the empty set and the whole space are open because for the empty set, there are no points to check the openness condition, and for the whole space, every point has a neighborhood contained within the space itself.\n\nBut since we're dealing with a general topological space, not necessarily metrizable, it's better to stick with the definition of topology.\n\nIn conclusion, the empty set and X are open in X directly by the definition of a topology.\n\nSo, the proof is as follows:\n\nProof:\n\nLet X be a topological space with topology T.\n\nBy definition of a topology, both the empty set \u2205 and the whole space X are elements of T.\n\nTherefore, by definition, both \u2205 and X are open sets in X.\n\nAdditionally, considering the definition of an open set in terms of neighborhoods, the empty set has no points to check, making it open, and for X, every point has a neighborhood contained in X, making X open.\n\nThus, the empty set and X are both open sets in the topological space X.\n\nQ.E.D.\n\nThis seems complete and accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The empty set and } X \\text{ are both open sets in the topological space } X.} \\]"
