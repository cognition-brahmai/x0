        "content": "Alright, I need to figure out the history behind the creation of Google. I have some tools at my disposal: Bing to search the web, TextExtractor to get text from websites, LinkFinder to find links in text, and AnswerBot to answer questions based on provided text. I need to plan this step by step to get the most accurate and comprehensive answer.\n\nFirst, I should probably start with a web search to find relevant sources about the history of Google's creation. Bing seems like the way to go for that. I'll input the question \"What is the history behind the creation of Google?\" into Bing and see what comes up.\n\nSo, Plan 1: Search for information about the history of Google's creation.\n\n:evidence0: = Bing[\"What is the history behind the creation of Google?\"]\n\nOnce I have the search results, I need to extract the actual text from those pages to read and understand the history. TextExtractor can help with that. But first, I need to pick the most relevant links from the search results. Maybe I can use LinkFinder to get the links from the Bing search results.\n\nWait, but Bing probably returns a list of links already. Maybe I can directly take those links and pass them to TextExtractor. Let me think about this.\n\nPlan 2: Extract the links from the Bing search results.\n\n:evidence1: = LinkFinder[:evidence0:]\n\nNow, with the list of links, I need to decide which ones are most relevant to get text from. Maybe I can pick the top 3 or 5 links. For now, let's assume I'll extract text from the top 3 links.\n\nPlan 3: Extract text from the top 3 links.\n\n:evidence2: = TextExtractor[Top 3 links from :evidence1:]\n\nThis should give me a bunch of text from those pages. Now, I need to make sense of this text and find the information specifically about the history of Google's creation. This might be a bit tricky because the text could be lengthy and contain other information.\n\nMaybe I can use AnswerBot to answer the question based on the extracted text. I'll need to format the input properly, referencing the evidence.\n\nPlan 4: Use AnswerBot to answer the question based on the extracted text.\n\n:evidence3: = AnswerBot[\"What is the history behind the creation of Google? Given context: \" + :evidence2:]\n\nBut, I'm not sure if AnswerBot can handle a large chunk of text. Maybe I should summarize the extracted text first or break it into smaller parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use TextExtractor to get text from each link separately and then combine them, or process them one by one.\n\nLet me adjust the plan.\n\nPlan 3 revised: Extract text from each of the top 3 links separately.\n\n:evidence2a: = TextExtractor[Link 1 from :evidence1:]\n\n:evidence2b: = TextExtractor[Link 2 from :evidence1:]\n\n:evidence2c: = TextExtractor[Link 3 from :evidence1:]\n\nNow, I have three pieces of text. I can either combine them or process them individually.\n\nPlan 4 revised: Combine the text from the three sources.\n\n:evidence2: = :evidence2a: + \" \" + :evidence2b: + \" \" + :evidence2c:\n\nNow, with the combined text, I can use AnswerBot to answer the question.\n\nPlan 5: Use AnswerBot to answer the question based on the combined text.\n\n:evidence3: = AnswerBot[\"What is the history behind the creation of Google? Given context: \" + :evidence2:]\n\nThis should give me an answer based on the information extracted from the top three links. But to make sure the answer is comprehensive and accurate, maybe I should consider more links or verify the information across multiple sources.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use AnswerBot multiple times, each time with text from a single source, and then compare the answers.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I can use AnswerBot to extract key points from each source and then synthesize those points into a final answer.\n\nPlan 4 alternative: Use AnswerBot to extract key points from each source.\n\n:evidence3a: = AnswerBot[\"What are the key points about the history of Google's creation? Given context: \" + :evidence2a:]\n\n:evidence3b: = AnswerBot[\"What are the key points about the history of Google's creation? Given context: \" + :evidence2b:]\n\n:evidence3c: = AnswerBot[\"What are the key points about the history of Google's creation? Given context: \" + :evidence2c:]\n\nThen, I can combine these key points.\n\nPlan 5 alternative: Combine the key points from each source.\n\n:evidence4: = :evidence3a: + \" \" + :evidence3b: + \" \" + :evidence3c:\n\nFinally, synthesize a comprehensive answer based on these key points.\n\nPlan 6: Synthesize a comprehensive answer based on the combined key points.\n\n:evidence5: = AnswerBot[\"Summarize the history of Google's creation based on these points: \" + :evidence4:]\n\nThis seems like a thorough approach. By extracting key points from each source and then synthesizing them, I can ensure that the final answer is well-rounded and accurate.\n\nHowever, this involves more steps and might be time-consuming. Maybe for this question, the initial plan of combining text from top three links and then using AnswerBot once would suffice.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with the revised plan.\n\nSo, the final plan is:\n\nPlan 1: Search for information about the history of Google's creation.\n\n:evidence0: = Bing[\"What is the history behind the creation of Google?\"]\n\nPlan 2: Extract the links from the Bing search results.\n\n:evidence1: = LinkFinder[:evidence0:]\n\nPlan 3: Extract text from the top 3 links.\n\n:evidence2a: = TextExtractor[Link 1 from :evidence1:]\n\n:evidence2b: = TextExtractor[Link 2 from :evidence1:]\n\n:evidence2c: = TextExtractor[Link 3 from :evidence1:]\n\nPlan 4: Combine the text from the three sources.\n\n:evidence2: = :evidence2a: + \" \" + :evidence2b: + \" \" + :evidence2c:\n\nPlan 5: Use AnswerBot to answer the question based on the combined text.\n\n:evidence3: = AnswerBot[\"What is the history behind the creation of Google? Given context: \" + :evidence2:]\n\nAnswer: :evidence3:\n\nThis should give me a detailed and accurate answer to the user's question."
