        "content": "So the company has 500 employees in total, and 70% of them are men. I need to find out how many women work there. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, if 70% of the employees are men, then the remaining percentage must be women, right? So, I can calculate the percentage of women by subtracting the percentage of men from 100%.\n\nPercentage of women = 100% - 70% = 30%\n\nNow, to find out how many women that corresponds to, I need to calculate 30% of the total number of employees, which is 500.\n\nSo, number of women = 30% of 500\n\nI know that \"of\" in mathematics usually means multiplication, so:\n\nNumber of women = 30% * 500\n\nBut percentages can be tricky, so I should remember to convert the percentage to a decimal before multiplying. 30% as a decimal is 0.30.\n\nSo, number of women = 0.30 * 500\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication:\n\n0.30 * 500 = 150\n\nTherefore, there are 150 women working at the company.\n\nWait a minute, just to double-check, maybe I can approach this differently to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the number of men first and then subtract that from the total number of employees to find the number of women.\n\nNumber of men = 70% of 500\n\nAgain, converting 70% to a decimal: 0.70\n\nSo, number of men = 0.70 * 500 = 350\n\nNow, total employees are 500, so number of women = total employees - number of men = 500 - 350 = 150\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, definitely, there are 150 women working at the company.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of ratios. If 70% are men, then the ratio of men to total employees is 70:100, and similarly for women, it's 30:100.\n\nBut I think my first method is straightforward enough.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, are there any employees who identify as non-binary or prefer not to specify gender? But the question seems to categorize all employees as either men or women, so I'll assume that's covering all employees.\n\nAlso, the question specifies that 70% are men, so the remaining 30% should be women.\n\nSo, my final answer is 150 women work at the company.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
