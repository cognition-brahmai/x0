        "content": "So, I've got this problem here. A store sells two types of pens: blue and black. The ratio of blue pens to black pens sold is 3:7. And the total number of pens sold is 1500. I need to find out how many blue pens were sold.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what a ratio is. A ratio compares two quantities. Here, the ratio of blue to black pens is 3:7. That means for every 3 blue pens sold, there are 7 black pens sold.\n\nNow, to find out how many blue pens were sold out of 1500 total pens, I need to figure out what part of the total corresponds to blue pens.\n\nFirst, I can think of the ratio as parts. So, blue pens are 3 parts and black pens are 7 parts. Together, that's 3 + 7 = 10 parts in total.\n\nSo, the total number of pens, 1500, is divided into 10 parts.\n\nTo find out how many pens are in one part, I can divide the total number of pens by the total number of parts:\n\n1500 pens \u00f7 10 parts = 150 pens per part.\n\nNow, since blue pens are 3 parts, I can find the number of blue pens by multiplying the number of parts for blue pens by the number of pens per part:\n\n3 parts \u00d7 150 pens per part = 450 blue pens.\n\nSo, the store sold 450 blue pens.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nIf blue pens are 3 parts and black pens are 7 parts, and each part is 150 pens, then black pens would be 7 \u00d7 150 = 1050 pens.\n\nAdding the blue and black pens together: 450 + 1050 = 1500, which matches the total number of pens sold.\n\nSo, yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to approach this is by using proportions.\n\nThe ratio of blue pens to total pens is 3 to (3+7), which is 3:10.\n\nSo, the fraction of total pens that are blue is 3/10.\n\nTherefore, the number of blue pens is 3/10 of 1500.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n(3/10) \u00d7 1500 = (3 \u00d7 1500) / 10 = 4500 / 10 = 450.\n\nAgain, that confirms that there are 450 blue pens sold.\n\nI could also check this using algebra.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of blue pens as B and the number of black pens as K.\n\nAccording to the ratio, B/K = 3/7.\n\nAnd the total pens sold are B + K = 1500.\n\nFrom the ratio, I can write B = (3/7)K.\n\nNow, substituting this into the total equation:\n\n(3/7)K + K = 1500.\n\nCombining terms: (3/7)K + (7/7)K = (10/7)K = 1500.\n\nNow, solving for K: K = 1500 \u00d7 (7/10) = 1050.\n\nThen, B = 1500 - K = 1500 - 1050 = 450.\n\nAgain, that gives me the same answer.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I keep getting 450 blue pens.\n\nI think that's pretty conclusive.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can consider if there's any other way to interpret the ratio.\n\nIs it possible that the ratio is 3:7 but the total is not 10 parts? Wait, no, 3 + 7 is 10, so that seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, if the ratio were different, but in this case, it's clearly 3:7.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the total adds up: 450 blue + 1050 black = 1500 total pens.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the final answer is 450 blue pens sold.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{450} \\]"
