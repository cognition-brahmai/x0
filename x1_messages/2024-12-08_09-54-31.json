However, it's worth noting that he received the Nobel Prize specifically \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.\" His work on the theory of relativity was groundbreaking, but the Nobel Committee recognized his contribution to the photoelectric effect, which laid the foundation for quantum theory."
