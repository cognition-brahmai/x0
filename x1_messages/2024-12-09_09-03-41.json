        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces 200 widgets per hour, and it's running for an 8-hour shift. First, I need to figure out the total number of widgets produced in that shift.\n\nTotal widgets produced = production rate per hour \u00d7 number of hours\n\nSo, that's 200 widgets/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 1600 widgets.\n\nNow, each widget goes through a quality check, and 95% of them pass immediately. So, let's find out how many pass the first time.\n\nWidgets passing first quality check = total widgets \u00d7 95%\n\nThat\u2019s 1600 \u00d7 0.95 = 1520 widgets.\n\nNow, there are 5% that don't pass the first time. I need to find out how many that is.\n\nWidgets failing first quality check = total widgets \u00d7 5%\n\nSo, 1600 \u00d7 0.05 = 80 widgets.\n\nOf these 80 widgets that failed the first check, half are reworked and then pass the test. So, let's find out how many are reworked.\n\nWidgets reworked = widgets failing first check \u00d7 50%\n\nThat\u2019s 80 \u00d7 0.5 = 40 widgets.\n\nThese 40 reworked widgets then pass the test after being reworked.\n\nNow, to find the total number of widgets that ultimately pass the quality check, I need to add the ones that passed the first time to the ones that were reworked and passed afterward.\n\nTotal passing widgets = widgets passing first check + widgets reworked and passed\n\nSo, that\u2019s 1520 + 40 = 1560 widgets.\n\nTherefore, in an 8-hour shift, 1560 widgets ultimately pass the quality check.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1560} \\]"
