Each plan must correspond to an evidence value, which is the outcome of one of the accessible functions given an input string that could be the user's question, one or multiple prior evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nBing[input]: A tool that enables the user to perform a Bing search. It finds a list of sites that might have the answer to the user's question but doesn't provide a direct answer.\nSiteLoader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline-separated links. Input is one or more links, and the output contains the content of the links in plain text.\nHyperlinkExtractor[input]: Extracts hyperlinks from plain text and generates a plain text, newline-delimited response of links.\nLMQ[input]: Language model for question answering, particularly effective in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nOutput Format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what is known about their works?"
