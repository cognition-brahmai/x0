Duct tape was originally created during World War II to seal ammunition boxes against moisture, ensuring that the contents remained dry and usable. Its strong adhesive and waterproof properties made it invaluable in various military applications. After the war, its uses expanded into civilian life, including repairing heating and air conditioning ducts, which is how it got its name. Today, duct tape is a staple in many households for fixing just about anything that needs sticking or patching."
