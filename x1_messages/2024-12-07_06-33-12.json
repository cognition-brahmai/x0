        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a car rental company has 10 cars and wants to rent them out to 5 customers. Each customer must get at least one car. I need to figure out how many different ways this can be done.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's about distributing 10 distinct cars to 5 customers, with each customer getting at least one car. So, it's a problem of distributing distinct items to distinct groups with no group left empty.\n\nI recall that in combinatorics, when distributing distinct items to distinct groups with no group empty, it involves something called surjective functions or Stirling numbers of the second kind combined with permutations.\n\nLet me think about Stirling numbers of the second kind. Stirling numbers of the second kind, S(n, k), count the number of ways to partition n distinct items into k non-empty subsets. Once I have these partitions, I need to assign these subsets to the 5 customers, who are distinct, so I need to multiply by k! (the number of ways to assign the subsets to the customers).\n\nSo, the formula should be: Number of ways = S(10, 5) \u00d7 5!\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, actually, since the cars are distinct and the customers are distinct, maybe there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as assigning each car to one of the 5 customers, with the condition that each customer gets at least one car. This sounds like the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion principle states that to count the number of surjective (onto) functions from a set of size n to a set of size k, it's k^n (the total number of functions) minus the number of functions that leave out at least one customer, plus those that leave out at least two, and so on.\n\nSo, mathematically, it's:\n\nNumber of ways = k^n - C(k,1)\u00d7(k-1)^n + C(k,2)\u00d7(k-2)^n - ... + (-1)^(k-1)\u00d7C(k,k-1)\u00d71^n\n\nWhere n is the number of cars (10), and k is the number of customers (5).\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of ways = 5^10 - C(5,1)\u00d74^10 + C(5,2)\u00d73^10 - C(5,3)\u00d72^10 + C(5,4)\u00d71^10\n\nLet me calculate each term step by step.\n\nFirst, 5^10:\n\n5^10 = 9,765,625\n\nNext, C(5,1)\u00d74^10:\n\nC(5,1) = 5\n\n4^10 = 1,048,576\n\nSo, 5 \u00d7 1,048,576 = 5,242,880\n\nNext, C(5,2)\u00d73^10:\n\nC(5,2) = 10\n\n3^10 = 59,049\n\nSo, 10 \u00d7 59,049 = 590,490\n\nNext, C(5,3)\u00d72^10:\n\nC(5,3) = 10\n\n2^10 = 1,024\n\nSo, 10 \u00d7 1,024 = 10,240\n\nFinally, C(5,4)\u00d71^10:\n\nC(5,4) = 5\n\n1^10 = 1\n\nSo, 5 \u00d7 1 = 5\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nNumber of ways = 9,765,625 - 5,242,880 + 590,490 - 10,240 + 5\n\nLet's do the calculations step by step:\n\nFirst, 9,765,625 - 5,242,880 = 4,522,745\n\nThen, 4,522,745 + 590,490 = 5,113,235\n\nNext, 5,113,235 - 10,240 = 5,102,995\n\nFinally, 5,102,995 + 5 = 5,102,995 + 5 = 5,103,000\n\nWait, but 5,102,995 + 5 is actually 5,103,000. Okay, got it.\n\nSo, the number of ways is 5,103,000.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I missed something.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that the number of surjective functions from a set of size n to a set of size k is k! \u00d7 S(n, k), where S(n, k) is the Stirling number of the second kind.\n\nSo, let's see if that matches.\n\nFirst, find S(10, 5), the number of ways to partition 10 distinct cars into 5 non-empty subsets.\n\nThen, multiply by 5! to assign these subsets to the 5 distinct customers.\n\nI need to look up the value of S(10, 5).\n\nAlternatively, I can use the inclusion-exclusion formula to calculate it, but that's essentially what I did earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I can verify the calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate the inclusion-exclusion step by step.\n\nNumber of ways = 5^10 - C(5,1)\u00d74^10 + C(5,2)\u00d73^10 - C(5,3)\u00d72^10 + C(5,4)\u00d71^10\n\nSo,\n\n5^10 = 9,765,625\n\nC(5,1) = 5\n\n4^10 = 1,048,576\n\n5 \u00d7 1,048,576 = 5,242,880\n\nC(5,2) = 10\n\n3^10 = 59,049\n\n10 \u00d7 59,049 = 590,490\n\nC(5,3) = 10\n\n2^10 = 1,024\n\n10 \u00d7 1,024 = 10,240\n\nC(5,4) = 5\n\n1^10 = 1\n\n5 \u00d7 1 = 5\n\nNow, plug these back in:\n\n9,765,625 - 5,242,880 = 4,522,745\n\n4,522,745 + 590,490 = 5,113,235\n\n5,113,235 - 10,240 = 5,102,995\n\n5,102,995 + 5 = 5,103,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of Stirling numbers.\n\nThe Stirling number of the second kind, S(10, 5), counts the number of ways to partition 10 distinct cars into 5 non-empty subsets.\n\nThen, since the customers are distinct, I need to assign these subsets to the customers, which can be done in 5! ways.\n\nSo, total number of ways = S(10, 5) \u00d7 5!\n\nI need to find S(10, 5).\n\nThere is a formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind:\n\nS(n, k) = 1/k! \u00d7 sum from i=0 to k of (-1)^(k-i) \u00d7 i^n \u00d7 C(k, i)\n\nWait, that's the formula for surjective functions, which is k! \u00d7 S(n, k) = inclusion-exclusion formula.\n\nActually, it's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, there are tables available for Stirling numbers of the second kind.\n\nLooking up S(10, 5), I find that S(10, 5) = 42,525.\n\nThen, 42,525 \u00d7 5! = 42,525 \u00d7 120 = 5,103,000.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, the number of ways is indeed 5,103,000.\n\nTherefore, the car rental company can distribute the 10 cars among the 5 customers in 5,103,000 different ways, given that each customer receives at least one car.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5103000} \\]"
