        "content": "The Hubble Space Telescope has allowed astronomers to observe celestial bodies with unprecedented clarity due to its location outside the Earth's atmosphere. This eliminates the distortion caused by atmospheric turbulence, enabling the telescope to capture images in far greater detail than ground-based telescopes. Additionally, the Hubble Space Telescope can observe ultraviolet light, which is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere and thus inaccessible to ground-based telescopes. This has led to significant advancements in our understanding of the universe. Based on this information, what is one key advantage of space-based telescopes over ground-based telescopes?\nA. They can observe celestial bodies in greater detail\nB. They can observe ultraviolet light\nC. They are not affected by atmospheric turbulence\nD. All of the above"

        "content": "D. All of the above\n\nSpace-based telescopes, like the Hubble Space Telescope, offer several advantages over ground-based telescopes. One key advantage is that they can observe celestial bodies in greater detail because they are located outside the Earth's atmosphere, which eliminates the distortion caused by atmospheric turbulence. This allows them to capture clearer and sharper images. Additionally, space-based telescopes can observe ultraviolet light, which is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere and therefore inaccessible to ground-based telescopes. This capability has enabled astronomers to study celestial objects in wavelengths that were previously unavailable, leading to significant advancements in our understanding of the universe. So, all the options A, B, and C are correct, making D. All of the above the right answer."
