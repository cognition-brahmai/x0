        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the store sells books for $15 each, and they offer a 20% discount on every third book purchased. We need to find out how much it would cost to buy 9 books.\n\nFirst, let's understand the discount policy. It says there's a 20% discount on every third book. So, if someone buys 9 books, which books will get the discount? The third, sixth, and ninth books, right? Because those are the every third books in the sequence.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost without any discount. If each book is $15 and you're buying 9 books, it would be 9 * $15 = $135. But since every third book gets a 20% discount, we need to adjust for those discounted books.\n\nLet's find out how many books get the discount. Since it's every third book, in 9 books, it would be 9 / 3 = 3 books. So, 3 books get a 20% discount.\n\nNext, let's calculate the discount on each of those 3 books. A 20% discount on a $15 book is 0.20 * $15 = $3. So, each discounted book costs $15 - $3 = $12.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost. There are 6 books at full price and 3 books at the discounted price.\n\nThe cost for the full-price books is 6 * $15 = $90.\n\nThe cost for the discounted books is 3 * $12 = $36.\n\nSo, the total cost would be $90 + $36 = $126.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using a formula or a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as buying books in sets of three, since every third book gets a discount. In 9 books, there are three sets of three books each.\n\nIn each set of three books:\n\n- Two books are at full price: 2 * $15 = $30.\n\n- One book is at a discounted price: $15 - $3 = $12.\n\nSo, total for each set is $30 + $12 = $42.\n\nSince there are three such sets in 9 books, the total cost would be 3 * $42 = $126.\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation, so that's good.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the total discount. Since 3 books get a $3 discount each, the total discount is 3 * $3 = $9.\n\nSo, the total cost would be the full price minus the total discount: $135 - $9 = $126.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation of the discount policy. For example, does the discount apply only to every third book regardless of how many are purchased, or does it apply to every third book in the sequence of purchases?\n\nIn this case, since the problem says \"every third book purchased,\" it's safe to assume it's every third book in the sequence. So, books 3, 6, and 9 get the discount.\n\nI don't think there's any other way to interpret this, so I'm confident that $126 is the correct total cost for 9 books.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{126} \\]"
