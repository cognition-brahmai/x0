        "content": "Certainly! To create a Python script that fetches weather information from an external RESTful API, you can use the OpenWeatherMap API, which is a popular choice for weather data. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Sign Up for API Key\nFirst, you need to sign up for an API key from OpenWeatherMap. Visit their website at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and sign up for a free account to get your API key.\n\n### Step 2: Install Required Libraries\nYou will need the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the API. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install requests\n```\n\n### Step 3: Write the Python Script\nCreate a Python script that takes a city name as input, makes a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, and displays the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed.\n\nHere's a sample script:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(city, api_key):\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n    params = {\n        'q': city,\n        'appid': api_key,\n        'units': 'metric'  # Use 'imperial' for Fahrenheit\n    }\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    \n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        data = response.json()\n        main = data['main']\n        wind = data['wind']\n        temperature = main['temp']\n        humidity = main['humidity']\n        wind_speed = wind['speed']\n        print(f\"Temperature: {temperature}\u00b0C\")\n        print(f\"Humidity: {humidity}%\")\n        print(f\"Wind Speed: {wind_speed} m/s\")\n    else:\n        print(\"City not found or API request failed.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    city = input(\"Enter city name: \")\n    api_key = 'your_api_key_here'  # Replace with your actual API key\n    get_weather(city, api_key)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Replace `your_api_key_here`\nMake sure to replace `'your_api_key_here'` with the actual API key you obtained from OpenWeatherMap.\n\n### Step 5: Run the Script\nSave the script to a file, for example, `weather.py`, and run it using Python:\n\n```bash\npython weather.py\n```\n\nYou will be prompted to enter a city name. After entering the city name, the script will display the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed for that city.\n\n### Explanation\n1. **API Request**: The script constructs a URL with the city name and API key and sends a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API.\n2. **Data Parsing**: If the request is successful (status code 200), it parses the JSON response to extract temperature, humidity, and wind speed.\n3. **Display Information**: It prints the extracted information in a readable format.\n\nThis script provides a simple way to fetch and display weather information for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API."
