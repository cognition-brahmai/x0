        "content": "Tenebrism, a painting technique that uses extreme contrasts of light and dark to create a dramatic effect, was notably used by the Italian Baroque painter Caravaggio. His work is renowned for its intense chiaroscuro, which helps to emphasize the subjects and create a sense of three-dimensionality and drama."
