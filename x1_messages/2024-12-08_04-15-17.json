        "content": "So the restaurant normally can seat 100 people, but because of social distancing, they can only have 60% of that. So first, I need to find out what 60% of 100 is. That should be the maximum number of customers allowed now.\n\nOkay, 60% of 100 is calculated by 100 multiplied by 0.60, which equals 60. So, they can have up to 60 customers at a time.\n\nNow, there are already 45 customers in the restaurant. I need to find out how many more can be seated without exceeding the 60% limit.\n\nSo, I subtract the current number of customers from the maximum allowed: 60 minus 45, which is 15.\n\nTherefore, they can seat 15 more customers while following the guidelines.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Is there any other constraint or factor that might affect this calculation?\n\nLet me think: social distancing might also affect the seating arrangement, but since the problem already gives a overall percentage reduction, I think that's all I need to consider.\n\nSo, the answer should be 15 more customers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
