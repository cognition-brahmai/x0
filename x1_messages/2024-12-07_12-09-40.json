        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to calculate the compound interest on a $1,000 investment over five years with an annual interest rate of 3%, compounded annually. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the formula for compound interest. I think it's something like:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount, which is the initial amount of money, so that's $1,000 in this case.\n\n- r is the annual interest rate, which is 3%, but I need to write that as a decimal. So, 3% is 0.03.\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's compounded annually, n should be 1.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years, which is 5 years.\n\nSo, plugging in these values into the formula:\n\nA = 1000(1 + 0.03/1)^(1*5)\n\nSimplifying inside the parentheses first:\n\n1 + 0.03/1 = 1 + 0.03 = 1.03\n\nThen, raising that to the power of 5:\n\n1.03^5\n\nI'm not sure what 1.03 to the power of 5 is off the top of my head, so I might need to calculate that separately.\n\nLet me calculate 1.03^5.\n\nFirst, 1.03 * 1.03 = 1.0609\n\nThen, 1.0609 * 1.03 = 1.092727\n\nThen, 1.092727 * 1.03 = 1.12550881\n\nAnd finally, 1.12550881 * 1.03 = 1.1592740743\n\nSo, 1.03^5 is approximately 1.1592740743\n\nNow, multiplying that by the principal amount:\n\nA = 1000 * 1.1592740743 = 1159.2740743\n\nSo, the total amount after 5 years is approximately $1,159.27\n\nBut the question asks for the compound interest earned, which is the difference between the final amount and the principal.\n\nSo, Compound Interest = A - P = 1159.27 - 1000 = $159.27\n\nWait a minute, is there a simpler way to calculate just the compound interest without finding the total amount first?\n\nI think there is another formula for compound interest:\n\nCompound Interest = P[(1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1]\n\nUsing the same values as before:\n\nP = 1000\n\nr = 0.03\n\nn = 1\n\nt = 5\n\nPlugging in:\n\nCompound Interest = 1000[(1 + 0.03/1)^(1*5) - 1] = 1000[(1.03)^5 - 1]\n\nWe already calculated (1.03)^5 as approximately 1.1592740743\n\nSo,\n\nCompound Interest = 1000[1.1592740743 - 1] = 1000[0.1592740743] = $159.27\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using a different formula or method?\n\nI've heard of something called the simple interest formula, but I know that's different from compound interest. Simple interest is just I = PRT, where I is interest, P is principal, R is rate, and T is time. But that's not what we want here because it doesn't account for interest being earned on interest.\n\nBut just for comparison, let's calculate the simple interest for the same scenario.\n\nUsing the simple interest formula:\n\nI = PRT = 1000 * 0.03 * 5 = 150\n\nSo, with simple interest, the interest earned would be $150, whereas with compound interest, it's $159.27. That makes sense because compound interest earns interest on the accumulated interest from previous periods.\n\nAnother way to think about compound interest is to see how the interest builds up each year.\n\nLet me try calculating the amount year by year.\n\nStarting with $1,000.\n\nAfter the first year:\n\nInterest = 1000 * 0.03 = $30\n\nNew amount = 1000 + 30 = $1,030\n\nAfter the second year:\n\nInterest = 1030 * 0.03 = $30.90\n\nNew amount = 1030 + 30.90 = $1,060.90\n\nAfter the third year:\n\nInterest = 1060.90 * 0.03 = $31.827\n\nNew amount = 1060.90 + 31.827 = $1,092.727\n\nAfter the fourth year:\n\nInterest = 1092.727 * 0.03 = $32.78181\n\nNew amount = 1092.727 + 32.78181 = $1,125.50881\n\nAfter the fifth year:\n\nInterest = 1125.50881 * 0.03 = $33.7652643\n\nNew amount = 1125.50881 + 33.7652643 = $1,159.2740743\n\nSo, again, the total amount after 5 years is approximately $1,159.27, and the compound interest earned is $159.27.\n\nThis matches what I got using the formula, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the compounding frequency was different. For example, if it was compounded semi-annually or monthly, would the answer be the same?\n\nIn this problem, it specifies that it's compounded annually, so n = 1. If it were compounded more frequently, say semi-annually (n = 2) or monthly (n = 12), the compound interest earned would be slightly more because interest is being earned on interest more frequently.\n\nBut since it's compounded annually, we use n = 1.\n\nIs there any other factor to consider, like inflation or taxes? The problem doesn't mention any additional factors, so I'm assuming it's just a straightforward compound interest calculation.\n\nAlso, it's important to make sure that the interest rate is indeed an annual rate and that the compounding period is stated correctly. In this case, it's annual for both the rate and the compounding period.\n\nAnother thing to watch out for is the time period. The problem states five years, so t = 5.\n\nIf the time period was given in months or days, I'd need to convert it to years for the formula.\n\nBut in this case, it's clearly five years.\n\nJust to double-check my calculations:\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nA = 1000(1 + 0.03/1)^(1*5) = 1000(1.03)^5\n\n(1.03)^5 = 1.1592740743\n\nA = 1000 * 1.1592740743 = 1159.2740743\n\nCompound Interest = A - P = 1159.2740743 - 1000 = 159.2740743\n\nRounded to two decimal places, it's $159.27\n\nAlternatively, using the compound interest formula directly:\n\nCompound Interest = P[(1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1] = 1000[(1.03)^5 - 1] = 1000[1.1592740743 - 1] = 1000[0.1592740743] = $159.27\n\nAnd the step-by-step yearly calculation also arrived at the same amount.\n\nSo, I'm confident that $159.27 is the correct compound interest earned over five years.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if the interest was compounded more frequently.\n\nFor example, if it was compounded semi-annually (n = 2):\n\nA = 1000(1 + 0.03/2)^(2*5) = 1000(1 + 0.015)^(10) = 1000(1.015)^10\n\nCalculating (1.015)^10:\n\n1.015^2 = 1.030225\n\n1.030225^2 = 1.06136350625\n\n1.06136350625^2 = 1.12550881087\n\n1.12550881087 * 1.015 \u2248 1.14183685546\n\nSo, A \u2248 1000 * 1.14183685546 = 1141.83685546\n\nCompound Interest \u2248 1141.84 - 1000 = $141.84\n\nWait, that's less than the annually compounded interest. That doesn't make sense because more frequent compounding should yield more interest.\n\nWait, actually, I must have miscalculated (1.015)^10.\n\nLet me recalculate that.\n\n1.015^2 = 1.030225\n\n1.030225^2 = 1.06136350625\n\n1.06136350625^2 = 1.12550881087\n\nNow, 1.12550881087 * 1.015 \u2248 1.14183685546\n\nThen, 1.14183685546 * 1.015 \u2248 1.15823620421\n\nThen, 1.15823620421 * 1.015 \u2248 1.17502514042\n\nThen, 1.17502514042 * 1.015 \u2248 1.19221599189\n\nWait, I think I misapplied the exponents. Actually, for n=2 and t=5, it's (1 + r/n)^(nt) = (1.015)^10\n\nI recall that (1.015)^10 is approximately 1.16147632233\n\nSo, A = 1000 * 1.16147632233 = 1161.47632233\n\nCompound Interest = 1161.48 - 1000 = $161.48\n\nSo, indeed, with semi-annual compounding, the compound interest is higher than with annual compounding.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's compounded annually, so I shouldn't be considering semi-annual compounding. I just did that for comparison.\n\nSo, going back, for annual compounding, the compound interest is $159.27, and for semi-annual compounding, it's $161.48.\n\nThat shows that more frequent compounding leads to higher interest earned.\n\nBut since the problem specifies annual compounding, the answer remains $159.27.\n\nIs there any other aspect I should consider? Maybe the effect of rounding.\n\nIn my calculations, I rounded intermediate steps, which can lead to slight discrepancies in the final answer.\n\nTo minimize rounding errors, it's best to carry out calculations with as many decimal places as possible and round only at the end.\n\nIn my step-by-step yearly calculation, I carried more decimal places, and the final amount was $1,159.2740743, which rounds to $1,159.27\n\nSimilarly, using the formula directly gave the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that $159.27 is the correct compound interest earned over five years.\n\nJust to summarize:\n\n- Principal (P): $1,000\n\n- Annual interest rate (r): 3% or 0.03\n\n- Number of times interest is compounded per year (n): 1 (annually)\n\n- Time (t): 5 years\n\nUsing the compound interest formula:\n\nCompound Interest = P[(1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1] = 1000[(1 + 0.03/1)^(1*5) - 1] = 1000[(1.03)^5 - 1] = 1000[1.1592740743 - 1] = 1000[0.1592740743] = $159.27\n\nAlternatively, calculating the total amount A and then subtracting the principal:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) = 1000(1.03)^5 = 1000*1.1592740743 = $1,159.27\n\nCompound Interest = A - P = $159.27\n\nOr, calculating year by year:\n\nYear 1: $1,000 + 3% = $1,030\n\nYear 2: $1,030 + 3% = $1,060.90\n\nYear 3: $1,060.90 + 3% = $1,092.727\n\nYear 4: $1,092.727 + 3% = $1,125.50881\n\nYear 5: $1,125.50881 + 3% = $1,159.2740743\n\nAgain, compound interest = $159.27\n\nTherefore, the compound interest earned is $159.27\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{159.27} \\]"
