        "content": "So, you've got a rectangular garden that's 50 feet long and 30 feet wide, and you're wondering how many feet of flowers you'll need to plant along the entire perimeter. Perimeter sounds a bit tricky, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nFirst things first, I need to remember what a perimeter is. I think it's the total distance around the edge of something. So, for a rectangle, that would be the sum of all its sides. A rectangle has two lengths and two widths, right? So, if I add up the length twice and the width twice, that should give me the perimeter.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nPerimeter (P) = 2 \u00d7 length (L) + 2 \u00d7 width (W)\n\nGiven that the length (L) is 50 feet and the width (W) is 30 feet, I can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP = 2 \u00d7 50 + 2 \u00d7 30\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication:\n\n2 \u00d7 50 = 100 feet\n\n2 \u00d7 30 = 60 feet\n\nNow, I need to add those together to get the total perimeter:\n\n100 feet + 60 feet = 160 feet\n\nSo, the gardener would need 160 feet of flowers to plant along the entire perimeter of the garden.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle? I think I've heard something about adding the length and width and then multiplying by two. Let me check that.\n\nSo, another formula could be:\n\nP = 2 \u00d7 (L + W)\n\nLet's try that with the given dimensions:\n\nP = 2 \u00d7 (50 + 30) = 2 \u00d7 80 = 160 feet\n\nOkay, same result. That's reassuring. So, either way, the perimeter is 160 feet.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, maybe I should double-check my calculations. Starting with the first method:\n\nP = 2 \u00d7 L + 2 \u00d7 W = 2 \u00d7 50 + 2 \u00d7 30 = 100 + 60 = 160 feet\n\nAnd the second method:\n\nP = 2 \u00d7 (L + W) = 2 \u00d7 (50 + 30) = 2 \u00d7 80 = 160 feet\n\nBoth methods confirm the same perimeter. I think that's pretty solid.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using the area or something, but I don't think that's relevant for perimeter. Perimeter is just the boundary, so area wouldn't come into play here.\n\nAlternatively, if it were a square, all sides would be equal, and the perimeter would be four times one side, but since it's a rectangle, it's different lengths for length and width.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the garden has any irregular shapes or extensions, but the problem says it's a rectangular garden, so I can assume it's a standard rectangle.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. Both the length and width are given in feet, so no conversion is needed.\n\nWait, the question is about planting flowers along the perimeter. Does that include any specific spacing between the flowers or anything like that? The question doesn't specify, so I'm assuming it's just the total linear feet needed.\n\nIf there were additional requirements, like the distance between each flower, I would need to calculate the number of flowers based on that spacing, but since it's just asking for the feet of flowers, 160 feet should be the answer.\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking this. It seems straightforward. A rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, so adding up all the sides gives the perimeter.\n\nLet me consider if there's a formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. Yes, P = 2L + 2W or P = 2(L + W), which is what I used earlier.\n\nIt's good to see that both methods give the same result. That boosts my confidence in the answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The gardener needs 160 feet of flowers to plant along the perimeter of the garden.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{160} \\]"
