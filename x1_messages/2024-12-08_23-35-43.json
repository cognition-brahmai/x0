        "content": "Let's calculate that. If each person uses 80 gallons per day, and there are four people, then daily usage would be 80 gallons/person/day * 4 people = 320 gallons/day. Now, to find out the monthly usage, we need to know how many days are in a month. Typically, a month has about 30 days. So, 320 gallons/day * 30 days = 9,600 gallons per month. But remember, this is a rough estimate. Actual usage can vary based on habits and the specific activities they engage in."
