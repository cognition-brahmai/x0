        "content": "Alright, I'm going to design a simple chat server using C# and sockets that can handle multiple clients and broadcast messages to all connected clients. Since you've asked for a plain format, I'll keep the explanation straightforward and focus on the code and key steps.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Server Setup:**\n   - Use `TcpListener` to listen for incoming client connections.\n   - Accept multiple clients using `AcceptTcpClient` in a loop.\n   - Handle each client in a separate thread or using asynchronous methods to manage concurrency.\n\n2. **Client Handling:**\n   - For each connected client, read messages from their socket.\n   - Broadcast any received message to all other connected clients.\n\n3. **Thread Management:**\n   - Use threads or async methods to handle multiple clients simultaneously without blocking.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Net;\nusing System.Net.Sockets;\nusing System.Text;\nusing System.Threading;\n\nnamespace SimpleChatServer\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        private static List<TcpClient> clients = new List<TcpClient>();\n        private static object lockObject = new object();\n\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            int port = 5000;\n            TcpListener server = new TcpListener(IPAddress.Any, port);\n            server.Start();\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Server started on port \" + port);\n\n            while (true)\n            {\n                TcpClient client = server.AcceptTcpClient();\n                lock (lockObject)\n                {\n                    clients.Add(client);\n                }\n                Console.WriteLine(\"New client connected: \" + client.Client.RemoteEndPoint);\n                Thread clientThread = new Thread(HandleClient);\n                clientThread.Start(client);\n            }\n        }\n\n        private static void HandleClient(object clientObj)\n        {\n            TcpClient client = (TcpClient)clientObj;\n            NetworkStream stream = client.GetStream();\n            byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n            int bytesRead;\n\n            while (true)\n            {\n                try\n                {\n                    bytesRead = stream.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);\n                }\n                catch\n                {\n                    lock (lockObject)\n                    {\n                        clients.Remove(client);\n                    }\n                    client.Close();\n                    Console.WriteLine(\"Client disconnected: \" + client.Client.RemoteEndPoint);\n                    return;\n                }\n\n                if (bytesRead == 0)\n                {\n                    lock (lockObject)\n                    {\n                        clients.Remove(client);\n                    }\n                    client.Close();\n                    Console.WriteLine(\"Client disconnected: \" + client.Client.RemoteEndPoint);\n                    return;\n                }\n\n                string message = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n                Broadcast(message, client);\n            }\n        }\n\n        private static void Broadcast(string message, TcpClient sender)\n        {\n            byte[] buffer = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(message);\n            lock (lockObject)\n            {\n                foreach (TcpClient client in clients)\n                {\n                    if (client != sender)\n                    {\n                        try\n                        {\n                            NetworkStream stream = client.GetStream();\n                            stream.Write(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);\n                        }\n                        catch\n                        {\n                            // Handle disconnection\n                            clients.Remove(client);\n                            client.Close();\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Server Setup:**\n   - The server listens on port 5000 using `TcpListener`.\n   - It accepts incoming client connections in a loop.\n\n2. **Client Handling:**\n   - For each client, a new thread is created to handle communication.\n   - The server reads messages from the client in a loop and broadcasts them to other clients.\n\n3. **Broadcasting:**\n   - When a message is received from a client, it is broadcasted to all other connected clients.\n   - Exception handling is used to manage client disconnections gracefully.\n\nThis setup ensures that the server can handle multiple clients simultaneously and broadcast messages effectively."
