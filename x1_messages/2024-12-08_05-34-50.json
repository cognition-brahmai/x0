        "content": "So Alice can paint a room in 5 hours, and Bob can do it in 7 hours. I need to find out how long it will take them to paint the room together. Hmm, this seems like a problem about working together or combined work rates.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how much of the room each person can paint in one hour. That's their work rate, right? So, Alice's work rate is 1 room per 5 hours, which is 1/5 of the room per hour. Similarly, Bob's work rate is 1 room per 7 hours, which is 1/7 of the room per hour.\n\nNow, if they work together, their work rates should add up. So, the combined work rate would be 1/5 plus 1/7 of the room per hour. To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 7 is 35, I think.\n\nSo, 1/5 is equal to 7/35, and 1/7 is equal to 5/35. Adding them together, 7/35 plus 5/35 is 12/35. So, together, they can paint 12/35 of the room per hour.\n\nNow, to find out how long it takes them to paint the whole room, I need to divide the entire room (which is 1) by their combined work rate (12/35). So, time = work / rate, which is 1 / (12/35) = 35/12 hours.\n\n35/12 hours is the same as 2 hours and 11/12 of an hour. To convert 11/12 of an hour into minutes, I can multiply by 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. 11/12 * 60 = 55 minutes.\n\nSo, together, Alice and Bob can paint the room in 2 hours and 55 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a simpler way to think about it. If Alice can paint a room in 5 hours, and Bob in 7 hours, working together, they should be able to finish faster than either one alone, which makes sense since I got 2 hours and 55 minutes, which is less than both 5 and 7 hours.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to think about how much work they do in one hour together. As I calculated, that's 12/35 of the room. So, to complete the whole room, it should take 35/12 hours, which is indeed 2 hours and 55 minutes.\n\nI think that makes sense. Maybe I can also think about it in terms of their rates:\n\nAlice's rate: 1/5 room per hour\n\nBob's rate: 1/7 room per hour\n\nCombined rate: 1/5 + 1/7 = 12/35 room per hour\n\nTime to complete one room: 1 / (12/35) = 35/12 hours\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of a formula for combined work rates: if one person can do a job in A hours and another in B hours, together they can do it in (A*B)/(A+B) hours.\n\nSo, plugging in the values: (5*7)/(5+7) = 35/12 hours, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that it's 35/12 hours.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about how much work they do together over time.\n\nLet's say they work for t hours together. Then, the amount of work done by Alice is (1/5)*t, and by Bob is (1/7)*t. The total work done together is (1/5 + 1/7)*t = (12/35)*t.\n\nSet that equal to 1 (the whole room), so (12/35)*t = 1.\n\nSolving for t: t = 35/12 hours.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough. So, the final answer is 35/12 hours, or 2 hours and 55 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{35}{12} \\text{ hours}} \\]"
