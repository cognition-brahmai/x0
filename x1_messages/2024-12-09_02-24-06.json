        "content": "Let's see. There are 12,000 households in total. 40% own a dog, 30% own a cat, and 10% own both a dog and a cat. I need to find out how many households don't own either a dog or a cat.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how many households own a dog or a cat or both. I know that if I just add the percentages of dog owners and cat owners, that would be 40% + 30% = 70%. But that counts the households that own both a dog and a cat twice, once in the dog owners and once in the cat owners.\n\nSince 10% own both, I need to subtract that from the total to avoid double-counting. So, the percentage of households that own either a dog or a cat or both would be 70% - 10% = 60%.\n\nNow, to find the number of households that don't own either, I can subtract this 60% from 100% to get the percentage that owns neither. That would be 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nFinally, to find the number of households, I can calculate 40% of 12,000.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n40% of 12,000 is 0.4 * 12,000 = 4,800.\n\nSo, 4,800 households do not own either a dog or a cat.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I used the inclusion-exclusion principle here. The formula for the union of two sets is:\n\nNumber of households that own a dog or a cat = Number that own dogs + Number that own cats - Number that own both.\n\nSo, in percentages: 40% + 30% - 10% = 60%.\n\nThen, the households that own neither are 100% - 60% = 40%, which is 4,800 households.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the complement of the union of two sets:\n\nHouseholds that own neither = Total households - (Households that own dogs + Households that own cats - Households that own both).\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nHouseholds that own neither = 12,000 - (0.4*12,000 + 0.3*12,000 - 0.1*12,000) = 12,000 - (4,800 + 3,600 - 1,200) = 12,000 - 7,200 = 4,800.\n\nWait, that gives me the same answer, but I think I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\n0.4*12,000 = 4,800 (dog owners)\n\n0.3*12,000 = 3,600 (cat owners)\n\n0.1*12,000 = 1,200 (both)\n\nSo, households that own dogs or cats or both = 4,800 + 3,600 - 1,200 = 7,200.\n\nThen, households that own neither = 12,000 - 7,200 = 4,800.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, using percentages:\n\nPercentage that owns dogs: 40%\n\nPercentage that owns cats: 30%\n\nPercentage that owns both: 10%\n\nSo, percentage that owns either dogs or cats or both: 40% + 30% - 10% = 60%.\n\nTherefore, percentage that owns neither: 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\n40% of 12,000 = 0.4 * 12,000 = 4,800.\n\nEverything points to 4,800 households not owning either a dog or a cat.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4800} \\]"
