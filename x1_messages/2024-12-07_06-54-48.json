        "content": "So on Monday, the bakery sold 120 pastries, and that was 75% of what they had made for that day. I need to find out how many pastries they made in total on Monday.\n\nAlright, let's think about this. If 120 pastries represent 75% of the total pastries made, then I need to find out what number 120 is 75% of. That sounds like a classic percentage problem.\n\nI remember that to find the whole when you have a part and the percentage, you can use the formula:\n\nTotal = (Part / Percentage) * 100\n\nIn this case, the part is 120 pastries, and the percentage is 75%. So plugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal = (120 / 75) * 100\n\nLet me calculate that. First, 120 divided by 75 is 1.6. Then, 1.6 multiplied by 100 is 160.\n\nSo, the bakery made 160 pastries on Monday.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's check. If they made 160 pastries and sold 75% of them, that should be 120.\n\nLet me verify: 75% of 160 is 0.75 times 160, which is indeed 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation to solve for the total number of pastries made.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total number of pastries made as x.\n\nAccording to the problem, 75% of x is equal to 120.\n\nSo, 0.75x = 120\n\nTo find x, I can divide both sides by 0.75:\n\nx = 120 / 0.75\n\nWhich also gives x = 160\n\nAgain, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nMaybe I can think about it in terms of fractions to confirm.\n\n75% is the same as 3/4.\n\nSo, if 3/4 of the total pastries is 120, then 1/4 of the total is 120 divided by 3, which is 40.\n\nTherefore, the total pastries would be 4 times 40, which is 160.\n\nYet again, I get 160.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that 75% is 120, then 100% would be 120 divided by 0.75, which is 160.\n\nAll these different approaches lead me to the same answer, which gives me confidence that 160 is the correct total number of pastries made on Monday.\n\nSo, the bakery made 160 pastries on Monday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{160} \\]"
