The additions made by various dynasties over centuries\nThe Great Wall of China's current length is a result of contributions from multiple dynasties over many centuries, each adding their own sections and fortifications for defensive purposes. While the Qin Dynasty initiated the construction, subsequent dynasties like the Han, Northern Wei, Northern Qi, Sui, and Ming Dynasties all contributed to its extension and strengthening. This cumulative effort over time has led to the extensive wall we know today."
