        "content": "Let's see. There are 40 students in total. 60% passed the math exam, so that means 60% of 40 students passed math. Let me calculate that:\n\n60% of 40 is (60/100)*40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 students passed math.\n\nSimilarly, 70% passed English, so 70% of 40 is (70/100)*40 = 0.7 * 40 = 28 students passed English.\n\nNow, 50% passed both exams, so 50% of 40 is (50/100)*40 = 0.5 * 40 = 20 students passed both.\n\nTo find out how many failed both exams, I need to find out how many students didn't pass either exam.\n\nI recall there's a principle in sets called the inclusion-exclusion principle that might help here. It states that for two sets, the size of their union is the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of their intersection.\n\nSo, the number of students who passed at least one exam is the number who passed math plus the number who passed English minus the number who passed both.\n\nThat is: Passed at least one = passed math + passed English - passed both.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 24 + 28 - 20 = 32 students passed at least one exam.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who failed both exams is the total number of students minus those who passed at least one exam.\n\nSo, 40 - 32 = 8 students failed both exams.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf 24 passed math and 28 passed English, and 20 passed both, then indeed, 24 + 28 = 52, but since 20 are counted in both, we subtract 20 to avoid double-counting, resulting in 32 who passed at least one exam.\n\nThen, 40 - 32 = 8 students failed both.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it using a Venn diagram. Let's say one circle represents math passers and the other represents English passers.\n\nThe overlap, which is both, is 20 students.\n\nSo, only math passers are 24 - 20 = 4 students.\n\nOnly English passers are 28 - 20 = 8 students.\n\nThen, the total who passed at least one exam is 4 (only math) + 8 (only English) + 20 (both) = 32 students.\n\nAgain, 40 - 32 = 8 students failed both.\n\nHmm, consistent with the previous calculation.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem to confirm?\n\nMaybe using the concept of probabilities or some other method.\n\nWait, in terms of probabilities, the probability of passing at least one exam is the probability of passing math plus the probability of passing English minus the probability of passing both.\n\nGiven that, P(math) = 60%, P(English) = 70%, P(both) = 50%.\n\nSo, P(at least one) = P(math) + P(English) - P(both) = 60% + 70% - 50% = 80%.\n\nThen, the probability of failing both is 100% - 80% = 20%.\n\nSo, 20% of 40 students failed both exams: (20/100)*40 = 0.2 * 40 = 8 students.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of sets and verify it that way.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the set of students who passed math as M and those who passed English as E.\n\nWe are given:\n\n|M| = 24, |E| = 28, |M \u2229 E| = 20.\n\nWe need to find the number of students who are in neither M nor E, which is the complement of M \u222a E.\n\nFirst, find |M \u222a E| = |M| + |E| - |M \u2229 E| = 24 + 28 - 20 = 32.\n\nThen, the number of students who failed both is total students - |M \u222a E| = 40 - 32 = 8.\n\nYet another confirmation.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a contingency table to visualize this.\n\nLet's create a table:\n\nPassed Math | Failed Math | Total\n\nPassed English | 20 | ? | 28\n\nFailed English | ? | ? | ?\n\nTotal | 24 | ? | 40\n\nFrom here, we can fill in the missing values.\n\nSince 20 students passed both math and English, and 28 passed English in total, the number who passed English but failed math is 28 - 20 = 8.\n\nSimilarly, the number who passed math but failed English is 24 - 20 = 4.\n\nNow, the total number who passed math is 24, and passed English is 28, so the total number who passed at least one is 20 (both) + 8 (only English) + 4 (only math) = 32.\n\nThus, the number who failed both is 40 - 32 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, to find the number who failed both, we can look at the table.\n\nWe have:\n\nPassed Math | Failed Math | Total\n\nPassed English | 20 | 8 | 28\n\nFailed English | 4 | ? | ?\n\nTotal | 24 | ? | 40\n\nNow, the total who failed English is total students - those who passed English = 40 - 28 = 12.\n\nSimilarly, the total who failed math is 40 - 24 = 16.\n\nNow, in the table:\n\nFailed Math and Failed English is the cell we need to find.\n\nWe have:\n\nFailed Math and Passed English = 8\n\nFailed Math and Failed English = total failed math - those who passed English and failed math.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach it differently.\n\nActually, from the earlier calculations, we already know that the number who failed both is 8.\n\nBut let's try to confirm it again.\n\nWe have:\n\nTotal failed math = 16\n\nOut of these, 8 passed English but failed math.\n\nTherefore, the number who failed both is total failed math - those who passed English but failed math = 16 - 8 = 8.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, total failed English is 12.\n\nOut of these, 4 passed math but failed English.\n\nTherefore, the number who failed both is total failed English - those who passed math but failed English = 12 - 4 = 8.\n\nAgain, consistent with previous calculations.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I keep arriving at 8 students who failed both exams.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of overlap or miscalculation.\n\nGiven that 50% passed both exams, which is 20 students, and 60% passed math (24 students), which includes those who passed both and those who passed only math.\n\nSimilarly, 70% passed English (28 students), including those who passed both and those who passed only English.\n\nSo, only math passers are 24 - 20 = 4.\n\nOnly English passers are 28 - 20 = 8.\n\nBoth = 20.\n\nTotal who passed at least one exam is 4 + 8 + 20 = 32.\n\nFailed both = total students - those who passed at least one = 40 - 32 = 8.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nI don't see any error in this reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who failed both exams is 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
