        "content": "So the factory is currently making 1000 units of product A each day, and it costs them $2 to make each unit. Now, they're thinking about switching to product B, which costs $3 per unit to produce. They want to know how much more it's going to cost them to make 1000 units of product B instead of product A.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total cost for producing 1000 units of product A. Since each unit costs $2, I can multiply the number of units by the cost per unit:\n\n1000 units * $2/unit = $2000\n\nSo, it costs $2000 to produce 1000 units of product A.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total cost for producing 1000 units of product B, which costs $3 per unit:\n\n1000 units * $3/unit = $3000\n\nSo, producing 1000 units of product B costs $3000.\n\nNow, to find out how much more it costs to produce product B instead of product A, I need to subtract the cost of producing product A from the cost of producing product B:\n\n$3000 - $2000 = $1000\n\nTherefore, it will cost the factory an additional $1000 to produce 1000 units of product B compared to producing 1000 units of product A.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If product B costs $3 per unit and product A costs $2 per unit, then the difference in cost per unit is $3 - $2 = $1.\n\nSo, for each unit they switch from A to B, it costs an extra $1. If they're producing 1000 units, then the total additional cost would be 1000 units * $1/unit = $1000.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of total costs. The total cost for product A is $2000, and for product B it's $3000. The difference is indeed $1000.\n\nI don't think there's any other factors to consider here, like overhead costs or anything like that, because the question only gives information about the production costs per unit. So, assuming that the only variable changing is the cost per unit, the additional cost is $1000.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this is a straightforward cost comparison based on the given production costs. There might be other considerations in reality, such as differences in selling price, demand for product B compared to A, or changes in production efficiency, but based on the information provided, the additional cost is $1000.\n\nSo, to answer the question: It will cost the factory $1000 more to produce 1000 units of product B compared to producing 1000 units of product A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1000} \\]\n"
