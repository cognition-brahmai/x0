        "content": "Let's tackle this reading challenge! So, I've got a 500-page book, and I'm supposed to read 20 pages every day except on Sundays, when I read 30 pages. Hmm, okay, first things first, I need to figure out how many pages I read in a week.\n\nThere are 7 days in a week. If I read 20 pages each day from Monday to Saturday, that's 6 days, right? So, 6 days \u00d7 20 pages/day = 120 pages. Then on Sunday, I read 30 pages. So, in total, per week, I read 120 + 30 = 150 pages.\n\nNow, the book has 500 pages. I need to find out how many weeks it'll take to read 500 pages at a rate of 150 pages per week.\n\n500 \u00f7 150 = 3.333... weeks. Hmm, but I can't have a fraction of a week. So, I need to see how many full weeks I can read and then see how many pages are left over.\n\nIn 3 full weeks, I read 3 \u00d7 150 = 450 pages. So, 500 - 450 = 50 pages left to read.\n\nNow, after 3 weeks, I've read 450 pages, and I have 50 pages left. I need to figure out how many more days it'll take to read these 50 pages.\n\nRemember, on weekdays (Monday to Saturday), I read 20 pages per day, and on Sunday, I read 30 pages.\n\nSo, let's see. If I have 50 pages left, and it's the start of a new week, I'll read 20 pages on Monday, leaving me with 50 - 20 = 30 pages.\n\nThen on Tuesday, I'll read another 20 pages, but I only need 30 pages, so on Tuesday, I'll read the remaining 30 pages.\n\nWait, but hold on. On Sunday, I read 30 pages, but since it's a new week, maybe I should consider the days accordingly.\n\nLet me clarify: after 3 full weeks of reading 150 pages each week, I have 50 pages left. Now, I need to see which day of the week it is, but maybe for simplicity, I can assume that the pattern repeats every week, so the days are the same each week.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it like this: in a week, I read 150 pages. After 3 weeks, 450 pages are read, leaving 50 pages.\n\nNow, I need to read the remaining 50 pages. Let's see how many days that takes.\n\nDay 1: 20 pages (Monday), total read: 450 + 20 = 470 pages, remaining: 50 - 20 = 30 pages.\n\nDay 2: 20 pages (Tuesday), but I only need 30 pages, so I'll read 30 pages on Tuesday.\n\nWait, but I read 20 pages on Tuesday, but I only need 30 pages. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no. After Monday, I've read 470 pages, and I have 30 pages left. On Tuesday, I read 20 pages, which would bring me to 490 pages, leaving 10 pages.\n\nThen on Wednesday, I'll read another 20 pages, but I only need 10 pages, so I'll read 10 pages on Wednesday.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 500 - 490 = 10 pages, not 30.\n\nLet me recast this. After 3 weeks: 450 pages read.\n\nDay 1 (Monday): +20 pages \u2192 470 pages, 30 pages left.\n\nDay 2 (Tuesday): +20 pages \u2192 490 pages, 10 pages left.\n\nDay 3 (Wednesday): +10 pages \u2192 500 pages.\n\nSo, it takes 3 weeks and 3 days to finish the book.\n\nBut wait, on Wednesday, do I read only 10 pages? Maybe not, because my daily reading is 20 pages on weekdays. But if I only need 10 pages to finish the book, I'll read just those 10 pages.\n\nSo, in total, it's 3 weeks and 3 days.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of total days.\n\nFirst, determine how many days it takes to read 500 pages, given the reading pattern.\n\nLet's see: 6 days a week I read 20 pages, and 1 day I read 30 pages.\n\nSo, in a week, I read 150 pages, as previously calculated.\n\nNow, 500 \u00f7 150 = 3.333... weeks.\n\nThis means 3 full weeks and a fraction of a week.\n\nTo find out the fraction, 0.333... weeks \u00d7 7 days/week = approximately 2.333 days.\n\nSo, 3 weeks and about 2.333 days.\n\nBut in terms of actual days, let's see:\n\nIn 3 weeks, I read 450 pages.\n\nRemaining pages: 50.\n\nNow, in the fourth week:\n\nMonday: +20 pages \u2192 470 pages, 30 pages left.\n\nTuesday: +20 pages \u2192 490 pages, 10 pages left.\n\nWednesday: +10 pages \u2192 500 pages.\n\nSo, it's 3 weeks and 3 days.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 3 weeks and 2.333 days. But in reality, it takes 3 weeks and 3 days because I can't read a fraction of a day.\n\nWait, but let's see: 0.333 weeks \u00d7 7 days = 2.333 days, which aligns with needing about 2.333 days beyond 3 weeks.\n\nBut in practice, since I can't read a fraction of a day, I need to round up to the next whole day.\n\nTherefore, it's 3 weeks and 3 days.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of total days needed.\n\nFirst, find out how many days it takes to read 500 pages.\n\nEach week has 7 days:\n\n- Monday to Saturday: 20 pages/day \u2192 6 days \u00d7 20 pages = 120 pages.\n\n- Sunday: 30 pages.\n\n- Total per week: 150 pages.\n\nNow, 500 \u00f7 150 = 3.333... weeks.\n\nSo, 3 full weeks: 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 days.\n\nRemaining pages: 500 - (3 \u00d7 150) = 50 pages.\n\nNow, in the fourth week, I need to read 50 pages.\n\nLooking at the daily reading:\n\nMonday: +20 pages \u2192 total 21 + 1 = 22 days, 21 days + Monday.\n\nTuesday: +20 pages \u2192 total 22 + 1 = 23 days.\n\nWednesday: +10 pages \u2192 total 23 + 1 = 24 days.\n\nWait, but this seems inconsistent with previous thoughts.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of days needed.\n\nEach week is 7 days: 6 days of 20 pages and 1 day of 30 pages, totaling 150 pages per week.\n\nNumber of full weeks: 500 \u00f7 150 = 3 weeks and some extra days.\n\nPages read in 3 weeks: 3 \u00d7 150 = 450 pages.\n\nRemaining pages: 500 - 450 = 50 pages.\n\nNow, in the fourth week, I need to read 50 pages.\n\nLooking at the daily reading pattern:\n\nMonday: +20 pages \u2192 total 470 pages, 30 pages left.\n\nTuesday: +20 pages \u2192 total 490 pages, 10 pages left.\n\nWednesday: +10 pages \u2192 finish the book.\n\nSo, it takes 3 weeks and 3 days to finish the book.\n\nTherefore, the total time is 3 weeks and 3 days.\n\nBut perhaps the question wants the answer in days.\n\n3 weeks \u00d7 7 days/week = 21 days.\n\nPlus 3 days: 21 + 3 = 24 days.\n\nSo, it takes 24 days to finish the book.\n\nWait, but is there a more precise way to calculate this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the average pages read per day.\n\nTotal pages per week: 150 pages.\n\nTotal days per week: 7 days.\n\nAverage pages per day: 150 \u00f7 7 \u2248 21.4286 pages/day.\n\nThen, total days needed: 500 \u00f7 21.4286 \u2248 23.333 days.\n\nBut earlier, my calculation showed 24 days.\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the reading pattern more carefully.\n\nLet's try to model it differently.\n\nSuppose I read for d days, with the reading pattern repeating every 7 days.\n\nEach cycle of 7 days: 6 days \u00d7 20 pages + 1 day \u00d7 30 pages = 150 pages.\n\nNumber of complete cycles: floor(500 \u00f7 150) = 3 cycles.\n\nPages read in 3 cycles: 3 \u00d7 150 = 450 pages.\n\nRemaining pages: 500 - 450 = 50 pages.\n\nNow, I need to read 50 pages in the next days.\n\nLooking at the daily reading pattern:\n\nDay 1 (Monday): +20 pages \u2192 total 470 pages, 30 pages left.\n\nDay 2 (Tuesday): +20 pages \u2192 total 490 pages, 10 pages left.\n\nDay 3 (Wednesday): +10 pages \u2192 finish the book.\n\nSo, it takes 3 cycles (21 days) plus 3 days = 24 days.\n\nBut according to the average method, it's 23.333 days, which doesn't make sense because I can't read a fraction of a day.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the average method isn't the best approach here because of the varying reading amounts on different days.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial approach, it seems that it takes 24 days to finish the book.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 24 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
