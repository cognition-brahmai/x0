        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem here: I'm playing a game with two six-sided dice, and I need to find out the probability of rolling a sum of 7. Hmm, probability can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand what's going on when I roll two dice. Each die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6, and when I roll both, I get two numbers. The sum of these two numbers is what I'm interested in, specifically when that sum equals 7.\n\nSo, to find the probability, I know that probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Make sense. So, I need to figure out how many ways I can get a sum of 7 and divide that by the total number of possible sums when rolling two dice.\n\nLet me first figure out the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice. Since each die is independent of the other, I can find the total number of outcomes by multiplying the number of outcomes for each die. Die one has 6 faces, and die two has 6 faces, so total outcomes should be 6 * 6 = 36. Okay, so there are 36 possible combinations when rolling two dice.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these 36 combinations add up to 7. Let's list out all the possible ways to get a sum of 7.\n\nIf die one shows 1, then die two needs to show 6 to make the sum 7 (1 + 6 = 7).\n\nIf die one shows 2, then die two needs to show 5 (2 + 5 = 7).\n\nIf die one shows 3, then die two needs to show 4 (3 + 4 = 7).\n\nIf die one shows 4, then die two needs to show 3 (4 + 3 = 7).\n\nIf die one shows 5, then die two needs to show 2 (5 + 2 = 7).\n\nIf die one shows 6, then die two needs to show 1 (6 + 1 = 7).\n\nSo, that's six different combinations that result in a sum of 7.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 6.\n\nNow, to find the probability, I divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes = 6 / 36 = 1/6.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nIs there any other way to get a sum of 7 that I might have overlooked? Let's see:\n\nLooking back at the combinations:\n\n1 + 6 = 7\n\n2 + 5 = 7\n\n3 + 4 = 7\n\n4 + 3 = 7\n\n5 + 2 = 7\n\n6 + 1 = 7\n\nThat seems comprehensive. Each die can be from 1 to 6, and I've covered all the pairs that add up to 7.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of the properties of numbers. The smallest number on a die is 1, and the largest is 6. So, to get a sum of 7, the numbers on the two dice need to add up to 7. Since 7 is greater than the maximum on a single die (6), I need one die to be higher and one lower accordingly.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that for each number on the first die, there's exactly one number on the second die that will make the sum 7. For example, if the first die is 1, the second must be 6; if the first is 2, the second must be 5, and so on.\n\nThis consistency suggests that there are indeed 6 favorable outcomes.\n\nNow, confirming the total number of possible outcomes. Since each die is six-sided and independent, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 * 6 = 36.\n\nSo, probability is 6/36, which simplifies to 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of fractions. Each die has a 1/6 chance of landing on any particular number. However, since the dice are dependent on each other to sum to 7, I need to consider their combined outcomes.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the concept of combinations or permutations. Since the order matters in terms of which die shows which number, this is a permutations problem.\n\nThe number of ways to choose two numbers that add up to 7, where order matters, is 6, as listed earlier.\n\nThe total number of possible ordered pairs is 36.\n\nThus, the probability is still 6/36 = 1/6.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if the dice are identical or distinct. In probability problems, it's important to know whether the dice are distinguishable or not.\n\nIn this case, since we're considering each die separately, I'm assuming they are distinct. For example, die one and die two are separate entities.\n\nIf they were identical, the approach might be different, but in standard probability problems with dice, they are considered distinct.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach stands.\n\nAlternatively, some people might try to list all possible sums and see how many are 7, but that could be more time-consuming. The method I used is more efficient.\n\nLet me consider if there are any overlapping outcomes or any outcomes that I've double-counted.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n(1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1)\n\nEach of these is unique, so no overlaps.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 6/36 = 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the probability step by step.\n\nFirst, the probability that die one shows any number is 1 (since it's certain to show some number between 1 and 6).\n\nThen, given that die one shows a particular number, the probability that die two shows the number that makes the sum 7 can be determined.\n\nFor example, if die one shows 1, the probability that die two shows 6 is 1/6.\n\nSimilarly, if die one shows 2, the probability that die two shows 5 is 1/6, and so on.\n\nSince die one can show any number from 1 to 6, and for each of these, there's exactly one corresponding number on die two that makes the sum 7, the probability is 1/6 for each pair.\n\nSince these are mutually exclusive events (only one pair can occur at a time), I can add up the probabilities:\n\n1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 6*(1/6) = 1.\n\nWait, but that would suggest that the probability is 1, which means it's certain to happen, which we know isn't the case because there are other possible sums.\n\nWait, I must have messed up somewhere.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nActually, the probability for each specific pair is 1/36, since there are 36 possible outcomes.\n\nBut since there are 6 favorable pairs, the total probability is 6*(1/36) = 1/6.\n\nYes, that makes more sense.\n\nSo, each favorable outcome has a probability of 1/36, and since there are 6 such outcomes, the total probability is 6/36 = 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the probability based on conditional events.\n\nFor instance, the probability that die one is a certain number and die two is the corresponding number to make the sum 7.\n\nBut that seems more complicated than necessary.\n\nGiven that, I think my initial approach is the most straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two six-sided dice is 1/6.\n\nJust to double-check, I can consider other known probabilities with dice.\n\nFor example, the probability of rolling a sum of 2 is only 1/36, since it can only happen if both dice show 1.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of rolling a sum of 12 is also 1/36, only when both dice show 6.\n\nOther sums have different probabilities, with 7 being the most likely sum because it has the most combinations that add up to it.\n\nWait, actually, in craps, a sum of 7 is common because there are more ways to get it.\n\nBut in this specific case, as I've calculated, there are 6 ways to get 7 out of 36 possible outcomes, so 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of generating functions or other probability distributions, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nGiven that, I'm confident that the probability is 1/6.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{6}} \\]"
