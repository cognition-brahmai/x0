        "content": "So I've got this equation to solve: 3x - 7 = 20. Alright, let's see how to tackle this step by step. The goal here is to find out what value of x makes this equation true.\n\nFirst, I need to isolate x on one side of the equation. To do that, I should get rid of the -7 that's being subtracted from 3x. I can do this by adding 7 to both sides of the equation. That way, things stay balanced.\n\nSo, starting with:\n\n3x - 7 = 20\n\nI'll add 7 to both sides:\n\n3x - 7 + 7 = 20 + 7\n\nThe -7 and +7 on the left side cancel each other out, so I'm left with:\n\n3x = 27\n\nNow, I need to get x by itself. Since 3x means 3 multiplied by x, I can undo that by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.\n\nSo, dividing both sides by 3:\n\n3x / 3 = 27 / 3\n\nOn the left side, 3 divided by 3 is 1, so it's just x:\n\nx = 9\n\nAlright, so x equals 9. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I'll plug x = 9 back into the original equation to see if it holds true.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n3x - 7 = 20\n\nPlugging in x = 9:\n\n3*(9) - 7 = 27 - 7 = 20\n\nYes, it checks out. So, x = 9 is the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
