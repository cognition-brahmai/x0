        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 students in total, and there are twice as many girls as boys. I need to find out how many more girls there are than boys.\n\nFirst, let's use some variables to represent the number of boys and girls. Let\u2019s say the number of boys is B and the number of girls is G. According to the problem, G = 2B, because there are twice as many girls as boys.\n\nAlso, the total number of students is 30, so B + G = 30.\n\nNow, since G = 2B, I can substitute that into the first equation:\n\nB + 2B = 30\n\nThat simplifies to 3B = 30.\n\nSo, B = 10.\n\nNow, since G = 2B, G = 2 * 10 = 20.\n\nTherefore, there are 20 girls and 10 boys.\n\nTo find out how many more girls than boys there are, I subtract the number of boys from the number of girls: 20 - 10 = 10.\n\nSo, there are 10 more girls than boys in the class.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
