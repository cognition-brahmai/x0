        "content": "So, the train goes from City A to City B at an average speed of 90 miles per hour, and it takes 4 hours to make the trip. I need to find out how far apart these two cities are.\n\nWell, I remember that speed, time, and distance are related. The basic formula is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nIn this case, the speed is 90 miles per hour, and the time is 4 hours. So, plugging these values into the formula should give me the distance.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nDistance = 90 miles/hour \u00d7 4 hours\n\nNow, when I multiply these, the hours unit should cancel out, leaving me with miles.\n\nSo, 90 miles/hour times 4 hours is:\n\n90 \u00d7 4 = 360 miles\n\nTherefore, the two cities are 360 miles apart.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Is there any possibility that the speed wasn't constant, or that there were stops along the way? The problem says it's an average speed, so maybe there were some variations in speed, but the average over the whole journey was 90 miles per hour.\n\nBut since it's average speed, and we're given the total time, using the formula should still give us the correct distance.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If the train was going at 90 miles per hour for 4 hours, how far would it travel?\n\nIn one hour, it would travel 90 miles.\n\nIn two hours, 180 miles.\n\nThree hours, 270 miles.\n\nFour hours, 360 miles.\n\nYeah, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer?\n\nMaybe using the formula for time:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nWe can rearrange this to find distance:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nWhich is the same formula I used before.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use the concept of distance being the area under the speed-time graph, but since the speed is constant, it's just a rectangle with height 90 miles per hour and width 4 hours, so the area is again 360 miles.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nSo, the final answer is 360 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
