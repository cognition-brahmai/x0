        "content": "Let's see. So, the restaurant has 12 tables, and each table can seat 4 people. That means the total seating capacity is 12 times 4, which is 48 people. So, the restaurant can seat 48 people when it's at full capacity.\n\nNow, three large groups of 10 people each come in. So, that's 3 groups times 10 people per group, which equals 30 people.\n\nWe need to find out what percentage of the total seats would be occupied by these 30 people.\n\nTo find the percentage, I think I should divide the number of people by the total seating capacity and then multiply by 100.\n\nSo, that would be (30 divided by 48) times 100.\n\nLet me do the math here.\n\nFirst, 30 divided by 48.\n\n30 \u00f7 48 equals 0.625.\n\nThen, 0.625 times 100 equals 62.5%.\n\nSo, 62.5% of the total seats would be occupied by the three groups of 10 people each.\n\nWait a minute, but the restaurant has 48 seats, and 30 people are coming in. Is there any other way to look at this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if all 12 tables are already seated with 4 people each, making it full capacity of 48 people, and then these three groups of 10 people want to be seated. But the question says the restaurant is at full capacity, which is 48 people, and then these three groups of 10 people come in.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread it.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"If the restaurant is at full capacity, what percentage of the total seats would be occupied if three large groups of 10 people come in?\"\n\nWait, if the restaurant is already at full capacity with 48 people, and then three groups of 10 people come in, that would be an additional 30 people.\n\nBut the restaurant is already full, so those 30 people wouldn't have seats unless some people leave or there's somehow more seating.\n\nBut the question is asking for the percentage of total seats occupied by these three groups, assuming the restaurant is already at full capacity.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the restaurant is at full capacity, and these three groups are trying to be seated, but since there are only 48 seats, not all 30 people can be seated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is to find out what percentage 30 people represent of the total seating capacity of 48 seats.\n\nIn that case, my earlier calculation of 62.5% seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking what percentage of the total seats would be occupied by these 30 people if they were to be seated, assuming that the restaurant is currently at full capacity.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense because the restaurant is already full.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is worded poorly.\n\nLet me try to rephrase it to understand better.\n\n\" A restaurant has 12 tables that can seat 4 people each. If the restaurant is at full capacity, what percentage of the total seats would be occupied if three large groups of 10 people come in?\"\n\nSo, the restaurant has 48 seats in total.\n\nIf three groups of 10 people come in, that's 30 people.\n\nBut the restaurant is already at full capacity with 48 people.\n\nSo, if these 30 people come in, they would need additional seating, but since the restaurant is full, only up to 48 seats are available.\n\nTherefore, only 48 seats would be occupied, which is 100% of the seating capacity.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to make sense with the question asked.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the restaurant is not currently at full capacity, but has a seating capacity of 48 people.\n\nThen, three groups of 10 people come in, totaling 30 people, and we need to find out what percentage of the total seats would be occupied by these 30 people.\n\nIn that case, it's (30 / 48) * 100 = 62.5%.\n\nBut the question says \"if the restaurant is at full capacity.\"\n\nWait, maybe it's a scenario where the restaurant is not currently at full capacity, but has a capacity of 48 people, and then these three groups of 10 people come in, and we need to find out what percentage of the total seats would be occupied by them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the restaurant is at full capacity with 48 people, and then these three groups of 10 people come in, making it 48 + 30 = 78 people, but the restaurant only has 48 seats, so 48 seats are occupied, which is 100% of the seating capacity.\n\nBut that doesn't align with the phrasing of the question.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nSuppose the restaurant has a seating capacity of 48 people.\n\nIf three groups of 10 people come in, that's 30 people.\n\nThe percentage of the total seats occupied by these 30 people would be (30 / 48) * 100 = 62.5%.\n\nBut the question mentions \"if the restaurant is at full capacity.\"\n\nDoes \"at full capacity\" mean that the restaurant is already seating 48 people, and these three groups are additional?\n\nIf so, then the restaurant would still only have 48 seats occupied, which is 100% of capacity, regardless of how many people are trying to get seats.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"at full capacity\" refers to the seating capacity of the restaurant, which is 48 seats.\n\nIn that case, the percentage of seats occupied by the 30 people would indeed be 62.5%.\n\nI think the key here is to understand what \"if the restaurant is at full capacity\" refers to.\n\nPerhaps it's better to assume that the restaurant has a seating capacity of 48 seats, and the question is asking, if three groups of 10 people come in, what percentage of the total seats would be occupied by them.\n\nIn that case, it's straightforward: (30 / 48) * 100 = 62.5%.\n\nAlternatively, if the restaurant is already at full capacity with 48 people, and these three groups of 10 people come in, then the seats occupied would still be 48, which is 100% of capacity.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent with the question's phrasing.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll go with the first interpretation: the restaurant has a seating capacity of 48 seats, and three groups of 10 people come in, totaling 30 people.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of seats occupied by these 30 people is 62.5%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{62.5\\%} \\]"
