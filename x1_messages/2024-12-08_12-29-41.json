        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular garden that's originally 30 meters long and 20 meters wide. The gardener wants to increase both the length and the width by the same percentage to get a new area that's 50% larger than the original area. We need to find out what that percentage increase should be.\n\nFirst, let's find out the original area of the garden. The area of a rectangle is given by length times width, so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Original Area} = 30 \\, \\text{m} \\times 20 \\, \\text{m} = 600 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nNow, the new area is supposed to be 50% larger than the original area. So, we need to calculate what 50% of the original area is and then add that to the original area to get the new area.\n\n\\[\n50\\% \\, \\text{of Original Area} = 0.5 \\times 600 \\, \\text{m}^2 = 300 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Area} = 600 \\, \\text{m}^2 + 300 \\, \\text{m}^2 = 900 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nAlright, so the new area should be 900 square meters. Now, the gardener wants to increase both the length and the width by the same percentage. Let's call this percentage \\( p \\).\n\nTo find the new dimensions, we need to increase both the length and the width by \\( p\\% \\). To express this mathematically, increasing a dimension by \\( p\\% \\) is the same as multiplying it by \\( 1 + \\frac{p}{100} \\).\n\nSo, the new length will be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Length} = 30 \\, \\text{m} \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{p}{100}\\right)\n\\]\n\nAnd the new width will be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Width} = 20 \\, \\text{m} \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{p}{100}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThe new area, which is the product of the new length and new width, should be equal to 900 square meters. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Area} = \\text{New Length} \\times \\text{New Width} = 900 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for new length and new width:\n\n\\[\n30 \\, \\text{m} \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{p}{100}\\right) \\times 20 \\, \\text{m} \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{p}{100}\\right) = 900 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n\\[\n30 \\times 20 \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{p}{100}\\right)^2 = 900\n\\]\n\n\\[\n600 \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{p}{100}\\right)^2 = 900\n\\]\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 600 to isolate the squared term:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\frac{p}{100}\\right)^2 = \\frac{900}{600} = 1.5\n\\]\n\nTake the square root of both sides to solve for \\( 1 + \\frac{p}{100} \\):\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{p}{100} = \\sqrt{1.5}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the square root of 1.5:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1.5} \\approx 1.2247\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{p}{100} \\approx 1.2247\n\\]\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides to solve for \\( \\frac{p}{100} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p}{100} \\approx 0.2247\n\\]\n\nFinally, multiply both sides by 100 to find \\( p \\):\n\n\\[\np \\approx 22.47\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the gardener should increase both the length and the width by approximately 22.47% to achieve a new area that is 50% larger than the original area.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[\n600 \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{p}{100}\\right)^2 = 900\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 600:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\frac{p}{100}\\right)^2 = 1.5\n\\]\n\nTaking square roots:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{p}{100} = \\sqrt{1.5}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1.5} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx \\frac{1.732}{1.414} \\approx 1.2247\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{p}{100} \\approx 1.2247\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p}{100} \\approx 0.2247\n\\]\n\n\\[\np \\approx 22.47\\%\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, we could have approached this problem using algebraic manipulation without plugging in the numbers right away.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the percentage increase as \\( p \\). Then, the new length is \\( 30 \\times (1 + \\frac{p}{100}) \\) and the new width is \\( 20 \\times (1 + \\frac{p}{100}) \\). The new area is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Area} = 30 \\times (1 + \\frac{p}{100}) \\times 20 \\times (1 + \\frac{p}{100}) = 600 \\times (1 + \\frac{p}{100})^2\n\\]\n\nWe know the new area should be 50% larger than the original area, so:\n\n\\[\n600 \\times (1 + \\frac{p}{100})^2 = 600 \\times 1.5 = 900\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 600:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\frac{p}{100})^2 = 1.5\n\\]\n\nTaking square roots:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{p}{100} = \\sqrt{1.5}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p}{100} = \\sqrt{1.5} - 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\np = 100(\\sqrt{1.5} - 1)\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( \\sqrt{1.5} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1.5} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx \\frac{1.732}{1.414} \\approx 1.2247\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\np \\approx 100(1.2247 - 1) = 100(0.2247) = 22.47\\%\n\\]\n\nThis confirms our previous result.\n\nAlternatively, we could have set up the equation in terms of the scale factor. Let\u2019s denote the scale factor by \\( k \\), where \\( k = 1 + \\frac{p}{100} \\). Then, the new length is \\( 30k \\) and the new width is \\( 20k \\), and the new area is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Area} = 30k \\times 20k = 600k^2\n\\]\n\nWe know that the new area should be 50% larger than the original area:\n\n\\[\n600k^2 = 600 \\times 1.5 = 900\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 600:\n\n\\[\nk^2 = 1.5\n\\]\n\nTaking square roots:\n\n\\[\nk = \\sqrt{1.5} \\approx 1.2247\n\\]\n\nThen, the percentage increase \\( p \\) is:\n\n\\[\np = (k - 1) \\times 100\\% = (1.2247 - 1) \\times 100\\% = 22.47\\%\n\\]\n\nAgain, this matches our previous calculations.\n\nTo further verify, let's consider the general case. If both dimensions of a rectangle are increased by the same percentage, the area increases by the square of that percentage increase. In other words, if each dimension is increased by a factor of \\( k \\), the area increases by a factor of \\( k^2 \\).\n\nIn this problem, we want the area to increase by 50%, which means \\( k^2 = 1.5 \\). Therefore, \\( k = \\sqrt{1.5} \\approx 1.2247 \\), leading to a percentage increase of approximately 22.47%.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use logarithms. We have:\n\n\\[\nk^2 = 1.5\n\\]\n\nTaking natural logarithms on both sides:\n\n\\[\n2 \\ln k = \\ln 1.5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\ln k = \\frac{\\ln 1.5}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nk = e^{\\frac{\\ln 1.5}{2}} = \\sqrt{1.5} \\approx 1.2247\n\\]\n\nThis again confirms our earlier result.\n\nLet\u2019s also consider the problem using different units to ensure consistency. Suppose the original dimensions are in meters, as given. The area is in square meters. If we increase both dimensions by the same percentage, the units should remain consistent, and the area should scale accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider changing the units to centimeters, the original length is 3000 cm and the width is 2000 cm. The original area would be 3000 cm \u00d7 2000 cm = 6,000,000 cm\u00b2. Increasing both dimensions by 22.47% would give new dimensions of 3000 cm \u00d7 1.2247 \u2248 3674.1 cm and 2000 cm \u00d7 1.2247 \u2248 2449.4 cm. The new area would be 3674.1 cm \u00d7 2449.4 cm \u2248 9,000,000 cm\u00b2, which is indeed 1.5 times the original area of 6,000,000 cm\u00b2. This confirms that the percentage increase is consistent across different units.\n\nMoreover, we can approach this problem using proportional reasoning. Since both dimensions are increased by the same percentage, the area increases by the square of that percentage increase. Let\u2019s denote the percentage increase as \\( p\\% \\). Then, the area increases by \\( (1 + \\frac{p}{100})^2 \\) times the original area.\n\nWe want this increase to result in a 50% larger area, which is 1.5 times the original area. Therefore, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\frac{p}{100})^2 = 1.5\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( p \\), we get:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{p}{100} = \\sqrt{1.5}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p}{100} = \\sqrt{1.5} - 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\np = 100(\\sqrt{1.5} - 1) \\approx 22.47\\%\n\\]\n\nThis is consistent with our previous calculations.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the binomial approximation for small values of \\( p \\), but since \\( p \\) is around 22.47%, which is not extremely small, this approximation may not be very accurate. However, for the sake of completeness, let's try it.\n\nThe binomial approximation states that for small \\( x \\), \\( (1 + x)^n \\approx 1 + n x \\). In this case, \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( x = \\frac{p}{100} \\), so:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\frac{p}{100})^2 \\approx 1 + 2 \\times \\frac{p}{100}\n\\]\n\nWe set this equal to 1.5:\n\n\\[\n1 + 2 \\times \\frac{p}{100} = 1.5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2 \\times \\frac{p}{100} = 0.5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p}{100} = 0.25\n\\]\n\n\\[\np = 25\\%\n\\]\n\nHowever, this is only an approximation and overestimates the actual percentage increase, which we've calculated more accurately as approximately 22.47%. Therefore, while the binomial approximation can provide a quick estimate, it's not precise enough for this scenario.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the problem in terms of ratios. The original area is 600 m\u00b2, and the new area is 900 m\u00b2. The ratio of the new area to the original area is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{900}{600} = 1.5\n\\]\n\nSince both dimensions are increased by the same percentage, the scale factor for each dimension is the square root of the area ratio:\n\n\\[\nk = \\sqrt{1.5} \\approx 1.2247\n\\]\n\nThus, each dimension is increased by approximately 22.47%.\n\nWe can also verify this by considering the ratio of the new dimensions to the original dimensions. For the length:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{New Length}}{\\text{Original Length}} = \\frac{30 \\times 1.2247}{30} = 1.2247\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, for the width:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{New Width}}{\\text{Original Width}} = \\frac{20 \\times 1.2247}{20} = 1.2247\n\\]\n\nBoth ratios are equal, as expected, and the percentage increase is indeed approximately 22.47%.\n\nLet\u2019s consider another method using logarithms to solve for \\( p \\). Starting from:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\frac{p}{100})^2 = 1.5\n\\]\n\nTaking natural logarithms on both sides:\n\n\\[\n2 \\ln(1 + \\frac{p}{100}) = \\ln 1.5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\ln(1 + \\frac{p}{100}) = \\frac{\\ln 1.5}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{p}{100} = e^{\\frac{\\ln 1.5}{2}} = \\sqrt{1.5} \\approx 1.2247\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p}{100} = 1.2247 - 1 = 0.2247\n\\]\n\n\\[\np = 22.47\\%\n\\]\n\nThis confirms our previous results.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the concept of geometric mean. Since both dimensions are increased by the same percentage, the geometric mean of the scale factors for length and width should equal the square root of the area ratio.\n\nThe geometric mean of the scale factors is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{k \\times k} = k = \\sqrt{1.5} \\approx 1.2247\n\\]\n\nThus, each dimension is increased by approximately 22.47%.\n\nLet\u2019s also consider solving the problem using algebraic manipulation without approximations. We have:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\frac{p}{100})^2 = 1.5\n\\]\n\nTaking square roots:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{p}{100} = \\sqrt{1.5}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p}{100} = \\sqrt{1.5} - 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\np = 100(\\sqrt{1.5} - 1)\n\\]\n\nNow, \\( \\sqrt{1.5} \\) can be expressed exactly as \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2} \\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\np = 100\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2} - 1\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\np = 50(\\sqrt{6} - 2)\n\\]\n\nUsing the approximate value \\( \\sqrt{6} \\approx 2.4495 \\):\n\n\\[\np \\approx 50(2.4495 - 2) = 50(0.4495) = 22.475\\%\n\\]\n\nThis is consistent with our earlier calculations.\n\nAlternatively, we can rationalize the expression to get a more precise value without resorting to approximations. However, since the problem likely expects a numerical answer, approximating \\( \\sqrt{1.5} \\) to 1.2247 and calculating \\( p \\) as approximately 22.47% should suffice.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the percentage increase can be expressed in terms of the area increase. Since the area is increased by 50%, and the area scales with the square of the scale factor, the scale factor for the dimensions is \\( \\sqrt{1.5} \\), leading to a percentage increase of \\( (\\sqrt{1.5} - 1) \\times 100\\% \\), which is approximately 22.47%.\n\nTo further illustrate this, let's consider that if the scale factor for the dimensions is \\( k \\), then the area scale factor is \\( k^2 \\). Given that \\( k^2 = 1.5 \\), solving for \\( k \\) gives \\( k = \\sqrt{1.5} \\), which is approximately 1.2247, corresponding to a 22.47% increase in each dimension.\n\nAlternatively, if we let the percentage increase be \\( p\\% \\), then the scale factor \\( k = 1 + \\frac{p}{100} \\), and the area scale factor is \\( k^2 = \\left(1 + \\frac{p}{100}\\right)^2 \\). Setting this equal to 1.5 and solving for \\( p \\) gives the same result.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use the formula for percentage change in area when both dimensions are changed by the same percentage. The percentage change in area is approximately twice the percentage change in one dimension, assuming the percentage change is small. However, since the required area increase is 50%, which is not a small change, this approximation isn't very accurate here. Instead, we must use the exact relationship, which is \\( (1 + \\frac{p}{100})^2 = 1.5 \\), as we did earlier.\n\nLet\u2019s also consider the problem graphically. If we plot the scale factor \\( k \\) against the area scale factor \\( k^2 \\), we have a parabolic relationship. Given that \\( k^2 = 1.5 \\), we can find \\( k \\) by taking the square root, which gives us \\( k \\approx 1.2247 \\), corresponding to a 22.47% increase.\n\nAlternatively, if we plot the percentage increase in dimensions \\( p\\% \\) against the percentage increase in area, we get a nonlinear relationship because the area increases with the square of the scale factor. This reinforces the need to solve the equation \\( (1 + \\frac{p}{100})^2 = 1.5 \\) to find the exact percentage increase.\n\nIn conclusion, after considering multiple approaches and verification methods, we can confidently state that the gardener should increase both the length and the width by approximately 22.47% to achieve a new area that is 50% larger than the original area.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22.47\\%} \\]"
