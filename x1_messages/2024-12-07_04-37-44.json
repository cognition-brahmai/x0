        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about a train's journey. It says the train travels at an average speed of 80 mph for the first half of its journey and then increases its speed to 100 mph for the second half. The total journey takes 4 hours, and I need to find out the total distance covered by the train.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. The train has two parts of its journey: the first half and the second half. Each half in terms of distance, not time. So, the distance is divided into two equal parts, and the train travels each half at different speeds.\n\nLet me denote the total distance as D. Therefore, each half of the journey is D/2.\n\nNow, for the first half, the train travels at 80 mph, and for the second half, it travels at 100 mph. The total time for the journey is 4 hours.\n\nI know that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, the time taken for the first half is (D/2)/80, and for the second half, it's (D/2)/100.\n\nThe sum of these times should equal the total time, which is 4 hours.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation:\n\n(D/2)/80 + (D/2)/100 = 4\n\nHmm, that makes sense. Now, I need to solve for D.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the left side of the equation.\n\n(D/2)/80 is the same as D/(2*80) = D/160\n\nSimilarly, (D/2)/100 = D/(2*100) = D/200\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nD/160 + D/200 = 4\n\nNow, to add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 160 and 200.\n\nLet's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 160 and 200.\n\n160 factors: 2^5 * 5\n\n200 factors: 2^3 * 5^2\n\nSo, LCM is 2^5 * 5^2 = 32 * 25 = 800\n\nOkay, so the common denominator is 800.\n\nNow, convert each fraction:\n\nD/160 = (D * 5)/800 = 5D/800\n\nD/200 = (D * 4)/800 = 4D/800\n\nSo, 5D/800 + 4D/800 = 4\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n(5D + 4D)/800 = 4\n\n9D/800 = 4\n\nNow, solve for D:\n\n9D = 4 * 800\n\n9D = 3200\n\nD = 3200 / 9\n\nD = 355.555... miles\n\nSo, the total distance is approximately 355.56 miles.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting from:\n\nD/160 + D/200 = 4\n\nFinding the LCM of 160 and 200, which is 800.\n\nThen, 5D/800 + 4D/800 = 4\n\n9D/800 = 4\n\n9D = 3200\n\nD = 3200 / 9\n\nD = 355.555... miles\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the train travels the first half distance at 80 mph and the second half at 100 mph, and the total time is 4 hours.\n\nPerhaps I can use the formula for average speed, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nWait, actually, the average speed for the entire journey can be calculated as total distance divided by total time.\n\nBut in this case, since the distances are equal, but the speeds are different, maybe there's a formula for average speed when distances are equal.\n\nI recall that for two equal distances traveled at different speeds, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the two speeds.\n\nThe harmonic mean for two speeds, V1 and V2, is given by:\n\nAverage speed = (2 * V1 * V2) / (V1 + V2)\n\nIn this case, V1 = 80 mph and V2 = 100 mph.\n\nSo, average speed = (2 * 80 * 100) / (80 + 100) = (16000) / 180 \u2248 88.888... mph\n\nNow, if the average speed is approximately 88.888 mph and the total time is 4 hours, then the total distance is average speed multiplied by time.\n\nSo, D = 88.888... * 4 = 355.555... miles\n\nThis matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, the total distance covered by the train is approximately 355.56 miles.\n\nAlternatively, to express it as a fraction, it's 3200/9 miles.\n\nBut probably, giving it as a decimal is more understandable.\n\nYes, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{355.\\overline{5} \\text{ miles}} \\]"
