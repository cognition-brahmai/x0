        "content": "So there are 10 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes occur in total. Hmm, let's try to think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have 10 distinct individuals, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly one time. So, no repeated handshakes between the same pair of people.\n\nMaybe I can start by considering a smaller number of people and see if I can find a pattern or a formula that I can apply to the larger group.\n\nLet's say there are 2 people in the room: Person A and Person B. How many handshakes would there be? Well, they only shake hands with each other once, so there's just 1 handshake.\n\nNow, let's increase the number to 3 people: Person A, Person B, and Person C. Let's see:\n\n- A shakes hands with B (that's 1 handshake)\n\n- A shakes hands with C (that's another handshake, total of 2)\n\n- B shakes hands with C (that's a third handshake)\n\nSo, with 3 people, there are 3 handshakes.\n\nNext, let's try with 4 people: A, B, C, and D.\n\n- A shakes hands with B (1)\n\n- A shakes hands with C (2)\n\n- A shakes hands with D (3)\n\n- B shakes hands with C (4)\n\n- B shakes hands with D (5)\n\n- C shakes hands with D (6)\n\nSo, with 4 people, there are 6 handshakes.\n\nWait a minute, is there a pattern here? Let's look at the numbers:\n\n- 2 people: 1 handshake\n\n- 3 people: 3 handshakes\n\n- 4 people: 6 handshakes\n\nThese numbers look familiar. They seem to be triangular numbers. Triangular numbers are sums of consecutive integers. For example:\n\n- 1 (for 2 people): 1\n\n- 3 (for 3 people): 1 + 2\n\n- 6 (for 4 people): 1 + 2 + 3\n\nSo, for n people, the number of handshakes seems to be the sum of the first (n-1) integers.\n\nWait, let's verify that.\n\nFor n = 2: sum of first (2-1) = 1 integer: 1. That matches.\n\nFor n = 3: sum of first (3-1) = 2 integers: 1 + 2 = 3. That matches.\n\nFor n = 4: sum of first (4-1) = 3 integers: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. That matches.\n\nSo, it seems like for n people, the number of handshakes is the sum of the first (n-1) positive integers.\n\nNow, I know that the sum of the first k positive integers is given by the formula:\n\nSum = k(k + 1)/2\n\nIn this case, k = n - 1, so the sum would be:\n\nSum = (n - 1)(n - 1 + 1)/2 = (n - 1)n/2\n\nTherefore, the number of handshakes for n people is (n(n - 1))/2.\n\nLet's test this formula with the earlier examples.\n\nFor n = 2:\n\n(2 * 1)/2 = 1. Correct.\n\nFor n = 3:\n\n(3 * 2)/2 = 3. Correct.\n\nFor n = 4:\n\n(4 * 3)/2 = 6. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula seems to hold.\n\nNow, applying this to the original problem where there are 10 people:\n\nNumber of handshakes = (10 * 9)/2 = 90/2 = 45.\n\nSo, there are 45 handshakes in total.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using combinations.\n\nBecause each handshake is between two distinct people, and the order doesn't matter (i.e., handshake between A and B is the same as handshake between B and A), this sounds like a combination problem.\n\nSpecifically, it's the number of ways to choose 2 people out of 10, which is denoted as \"10 choose 2\".\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nSo, C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10 - 2)!) = (10 * 9 * 8!) / (2 * 1 * 8!) = (10 * 9) / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45.\n\nAgain, we get 45 handshakes, which matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, both approaches lead to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to think about this to confirm.\n\nSuppose each of the 10 people shakes hands with every other person. Each person will shake hands with 9 others (since they don't shake their own hand).\n\nSo, total handshakes would be 10 people * 9 handshakes per person = 90.\n\nBut wait, this counts each handshake twice (once for each participant), so to get the actual number of unique handshakes, we need to divide by 2.\n\nTherefore, total handshakes = (10 * 9)/2 = 45.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I keep getting 45 handshakes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 45.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
