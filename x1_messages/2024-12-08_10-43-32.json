        "content": "So I've got this problem here about bacteria doubling every hour. Let's see, initially, there are 500 bacteria, and I need to find out how many there will be after 8 hours. Hmm, doubling every hour sounds like it's growing exponentially.\n\nI remember that exponential growth can be modeled with a formula like \\(N = N_0 \\times 2^{(t/T)}\\), where:\n\n- \\(N\\) is the final amount,\n\n- \\(N_0\\) is the initial amount,\n\n- \\(t\\) is the time elapsed,\n\n- \\(T\\) is the doubling time.\n\nIn this case, the initial amount \\(N_0\\) is 500, the doubling time \\(T\\) is 1 hour, and \\(t\\) is 8 hours. Plugging these values into the formula should give me the final amount after 8 hours.\n\nSo, \\(N = 500 \\times 2^{(8/1)}\\), which simplifies to \\(N = 500 \\times 2^8\\).\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\(2^8\\). Let's see, 2 raised to the power of 8 is 256.\n\nSo, \\(N = 500 \\times 256\\).\n\nMultiplying that out, 500 times 256 should be 128,000.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, \\(2^8\\) is indeed 256.\n\nThen, 500 times 256:\n\n500 times 200 is 100,000.\n\n500 times 56 is 28,000.\n\nAdding those together, 100,000 plus 28,000 is 128,000.\n\nOkay, so after 8 hours, there should be 128,000 bacteria.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can think about it differently. Since the bacteria double every hour, starting with 500:\n\nAfter 1 hour: 500 times 2 is 1,000.\n\nAfter 2 hours: 1,000 times 2 is 2,000.\n\nAfter 3 hours: 2,000 times 2 is 4,000.\n\nAfter 4 hours: 4,000 times 2 is 8,000.\n\nAfter 5 hours: 8,000 times 2 is 16,000.\n\nAfter 6 hours: 16,000 times 2 is 32,000.\n\nAfter 7 hours: 32,000 times 2 is 64,000.\n\nAfter 8 hours: 64,000 times 2 is 128,000.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, after 8 hours, there will be 128,000 bacteria.\n\nI think that's the answer. But maybe I should consider if there's any other factor that could affect the growth, like limited resources or space. But the problem doesn't mention any constraints, so assuming unlimited growth, 128,000 seems correct.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{128000} \\]"
