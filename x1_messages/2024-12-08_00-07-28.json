        "content": "Alright, so the zoo has a total budget of $20 million for expanding their facilities by adding new animal enclosures and exhibits. They've decided to allocate this budget in specific percentages for different types of exhibits: 50% for mammals, 30% for birds, and 20% for reptiles. Additionally, we're given the average cost per enclosure for each type: $2 million for mammals, $1.5 million for birds, and $1 million for reptiles. The task is to calculate the individual budgets for each type of exhibit and then estimate how many new enclosures can be built within those budgets.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the individual budgets for mammals, birds, and reptiles based on the percentages provided.\n\n1. **Mammal Exhibits:**\n   - Allocation: 50% of $20 million\n   - Calculation: 0.50 * 20,000,000 = $10,000,000\n\n2. **Bird Exhibits:**\n   - Allocation: 30% of $20 million\n   - Calculation: 0.30 * 20,000,000 = $6,000,000\n\n3. **Reptile Exhibits:**\n   - Allocation: 20% of $20 million\n   - Calculation: 0.20 * 20,000,000 = $4,000,000\n\nSo, the individual budgets are:\n- Mammals: $10,000,000\n- Birds: $6,000,000\n- Reptiles: $4,000,000\n\nNext, we need to estimate the number of new enclosures that can be built for each type of exhibit based on the average cost per enclosure.\n\n1. **Mammal Enclosures:**\n   - Average cost per enclosure: $2,000,000\n   - Budget: $10,000,000\n   - Number of enclosures: 10,000,000 / 2,000,000 = 5 enclosures\n\n2. **Bird Enclosures:**\n   - Average cost per enclosure: $1,500,000\n   - Budget: $6,000,000\n   - Number of enclosures: 6,000,000 / 1,500,000 = 4 enclosures\n\n3. **Reptile Enclosures:**\n   - Average cost per enclosure: $1,000,000\n   - Budget: $4,000,000\n   - Number of enclosures: 4,000,000 / 1,000,000 = 4 enclosures\n\nTherefore, based on the given budgets and average costs per enclosure, the zoo can build:\n- 5 new mammal enclosures\n- 4 new bird enclosures\n- 4 new reptile enclosures\n\nIt's important to note that these calculations assume that the entire budget for each category will be spent on enclosures and that there are no other costs associated with the exhibits, such as landscaping, utilities, or staffing. In reality, there might be additional expenses that could affect the number of enclosures that can be built. However, based on the information provided, this is the estimated number of new enclosures the zoo can construct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 \\text{ mammal enclosures},\\ 4 \\text{ bird enclosures},\\ 4 \\text{ reptile enclosures}} \\]"
