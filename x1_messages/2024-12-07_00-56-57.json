I need to find out how much each person contributed.\n\nOkay, so the total amount contributed is $1500, and this amount is divided equally among 25 people. To find out how much each person contributed, I should divide the total amount by the number of contributors.\n\nSo, it's $1500 divided by 25. Let me do the math.\n\n1500 \u00f7 25.\n\nWell, 25 times 60 is 1500. So, each person contributed $60.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check again. 25 times 60 is indeed 1500.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, each person contributed $60.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
