        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular field that is twice as long as it is wide, and the perimeter is 600 meters. We need to find the dimensions of the field.\n\nFirst, let's recall what the perimeter of a rectangle is. The perimeter is the total distance around the rectangle, which is calculated by adding up all its sides. For a rectangle, that's twice the length plus twice the width.\n\nSo, if we let the width of the field be \\( w \\) meters, then since the field is twice as long as it is wide, the length \\( l \\) would be \\( 2w \\) meters.\n\nNow, the formula for the perimeter \\( p \\) is:\n\n\\[ p = 2l + 2w \\]\n\nWe know that \\( p = 600 \\) meters, \\( l = 2w \\), so we can substitute \\( l \\) in the perimeter formula:\n\n\\[ 600 = 2(2w) + 2w \\]\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\[ 600 = 4w + 2w \\]\n\\[ 600 = 6w \\]\n\nNow, solving for \\( w \\):\n\n\\[ w = \\frac{600}{6} \\]\n\\[ w = 100 \\] meters\n\nNow that we have the width, we can find the length:\n\n\\[ l = 2w = 2 \\times 100 = 200 \\] meters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the field are 100 meters in width and 200 meters in length.\n\nWait a minute, let me just double-check that. If the width is 100 meters and the length is 200 meters, then the perimeter would be:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 100 + 2 \\times 200 = 200 + 400 = 600 \\] meters\n\nThat matches the given perimeter, so it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem using the ratio of the sides. Since the field is twice as long as it is wide, the ratio of length to width is 2:1. For rectangles, the perimeter can also be thought of in terms of the ratio.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the width as \\( w \\) and the length as \\( 2w \\). The perimeter is the sum of all sides, which is \\( 2w + 2(2w) = 2w + 4w = 6w \\). We know the perimeter is 600 meters, so:\n\n\\[ 6w = 600 \\]\n\\[ w = 100 \\] meters\n\nAnd again, \\( l = 2w = 200 \\) meters.\n\nThis matches my previous result, so I\u2019m confident that\u2019s the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the standard formula for the perimeter of a rectangle and substitute the given relationships.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[ l = 2w \\]\n\\[ p = 600 \\]\n\nAnd:\n\n\\[ p = 2l + 2w \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( l \\):\n\n\\[ 600 = 2(2w) + 2w \\]\n\\[ 600 = 4w + 2w \\]\n\\[ 600 = 6w \\]\n\\[ w = 100 \\] meters\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ l = 2w = 200 \\] meters\n\nSame result again. It seems consistent across different methods.\n\nLet me consider if there\u2019s any other way this could be interpreted. The problem says the field is \u201ctwice as long as it is wide,\u201d which clearly establishes the relationship between length and width. The perimeter is given as 600 meters, which is the sum of all sides.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any ambiguity here. The problem is straightforward, and the method I used is standard for solving such problems.\n\nJust to be thorough, let\u2019s consider if the field could be oriented differently, but in rectangle terminology, length is generally the longer side, and width is the shorter side. Since it\u2019s specified that the field is twice as long as it is wide, length must be twice the width.\n\nIf I were to assume that width is twice the length, that would contradict the given information. So, sticking with the initial approach is correct.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the units are consistent: everything is in meters, so no conversion is needed.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the field are 100 meters in width and 200 meters in length.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe dimensions of the field are \\(\\boxed{100 \\text{ meters by } 200 \\text{ meters}}\\)."
