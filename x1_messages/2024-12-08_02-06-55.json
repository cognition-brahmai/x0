It flows through a bunch of countries in Central and Eastern Europe, and it ends up in the Black Sea. Let me see, the capitals it passes through include Vienna in Austria, Bratislava in Slovakia, Budapest in Hungary, and Belgrade in Serbia. That's four capital cities, as you mentioned. And it's known for being one of the longest rivers in Europe. I think the Volga in Russia is the longest, but the Danube is definitely up there. It's also famous for its beauty and history, with lots of castles and historical sites along its banks. So, yeah, I'm pretty sure it's the Danube."
