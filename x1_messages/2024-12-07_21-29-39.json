        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an office with 4 printers, and each printer uses 3 ink cartridges per month. We need to find out how many ink cartridges are used in a year.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basic information given:\n\n- Number of printers: 4\n\n- Ink cartridges per printer per month: 3\n\n- Time period: 1 year\n\nAssuming a year has 12 months, I can start by calculating the total ink cartridges used per month and then multiply that by 12 to get the annual usage.\n\n**Solution 1: Standard Calculation**\n\n1. Calculate monthly usage per printer: 3 cartridges/month\n\n2. Total monthly usage for 4 printers: 4 printers * 3 cartridges/month = 12 cartridges/month\n\n3. Annual usage: 12 cartridges/month * 12 months/year = 144 cartridges/year\n\nThis seems straightforward. But maybe there are other factors to consider.\n\n**Solution 2: Considering Cartridge Yield**\n\nPerhaps not all cartridges are used completely in a month. Some printers might use only a portion of a cartridge before replacing it. If that's the case, the actual number of cartridges used might be higher.\n\nAssume that each cartridge is only used for 20 days before needing replacement, and a month has 30 days.\n\nThen, each printer might need more than 3 cartridges per month.\n\nBut this is speculative. The problem states \"uses 3 ink cartridges per month,\" which likely means they replace them exactly 3 times a month, regardless of partial usage.\n\nSo, this might not be necessary.\n\n**Solution 3: Accounting for Printer Usage Variability**\n\nMaybe not all printers are used equally. Some printers might be used more than others, leading to varying cartridge consumption.\n\nFor example, suppose two printers are high-usage and each uses 4 cartridges/month, while the other two are low-usage and each uses 2 cartridges/month.\n\nThen:\n\n- High-usage printers: 2 printers * 4 cartridges/month = 8 cartridges/month\n\n- Low-usage printers: 2 printers * 2 cartridges/month = 4 cartridges/month\n\n- Total monthly usage: 8 + 4 = 12 cartridges/month\n\n- Annual usage: 12 * 12 = 144 cartridges/year\n\nThis matches the standard calculation. So, even with variability, the total remains the same.\n\n**Solution 4: Considering Cartridge Refills**\n\nPerhaps some cartridges can be refilled, reducing the number of new cartridges used.\n\nIf each cartridge can be refilled once, then the number of new cartridges needed would be halved.\n\nBut the problem doesn't mention refilling, so it's probably safe to assume that cartridges are not refilled.\n\n**Solution 5: Including Spare Cartridges**\n\nMaybe the office keeps spare cartridges on hand, beyond what is immediately used.\n\nBut the problem specifies \"used in a year,\" not \"purchased\" or \"stocked.\" So, only the used cartridges should be counted.\n\n**Solution 6: Printer Downtime**\n\nThere might be months where a printer is down for maintenance and doesn't use any cartridges.\n\nHowever, the problem states \"each printer uses 3 ink cartridges per month,\" implying consistent usage.\n\nSo, unless specified, we should assume all printers are operational all year.\n\n**Ranking the Solutions:**\n\n1. **Standard Calculation:** This is the most straightforward and aligns with the information given. It's likely the intended solution.\n\n2. **Accounting for Printer Usage Variability:** This considers that usage might not be uniform across printers, but still arrives at the same total.\n\n3. **Considering Cartridge Yield:** This introduces an assumption about cartridge usage that isn't supported by the problem statement.\n\n4. **Considering Cartridge Refills:** Again, this introduces an assumption not present in the problem.\n\n5. **Including Spare Cartridges:** The problem specifies \"used,\" not stocked or purchased, so this is unlikely.\n\n6. **Printer Downtime:** The problem implies consistent usage, so this factor is probably negligible.\n\n**Best Solution:**\n\nThe standard calculation is the most appropriate, as it directly uses the information provided without making additional assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the office uses 144 ink cartridges in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{144} \\]"
