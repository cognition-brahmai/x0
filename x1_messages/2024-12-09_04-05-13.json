What is love, I pray?\nIs it not like the sun, that doth ascend\nThe eastern skies, and with his golden rays\nDoth warm the earth, and make the flowers to spring?\nOr is it as the moon, that with her beams\nDoth guide the wanderer in the darkest night,\nAnd shows him where to tread? Or is it both,\nAnd more besides, that I, being young and rash,\nCannot descry? O, tell me, gentle friend,\nWhat is this love that hath such power and grace,\nThat it can turn the savage beast to mild,\nAnd make the stubborn heart obedience pay?\nIs it a god, or but a fancy bred\nIn idle brains, that cannot rest in peace?\nO, speak, and let me hear thy wisdom\u2019s voice!"
