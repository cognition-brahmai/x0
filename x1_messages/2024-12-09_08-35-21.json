Each unit requires 1,000 square feet of flooring material, with three options available: hardwood ($8 per sq ft), laminate ($4 per sq ft), and carpet ($2 per sq ft). The developer wants to offer a mix of flooring options to cater to different buyer preferences but must stay within a budget of $2 million for flooring materials.

        "content": "So I've got this problem here about figuring out the best mix of flooring options for a big residential complex. There are 500 apartments, each needing 1,000 square feet of flooring. There are three options: hardwood at $8 per square foot, laminate at $4, and carpet at $2. The total budget for flooring is $2 million. I need to find the optimal combination that maximizes variety while staying within the budget.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total flooring required. Each unit needs 1,000 sq ft, and there are 500 units, so total flooring needed is 500 * 1,000 = 500,000 sq ft.\n\nNow, the budget is $2 million for all this flooring. So, average cost per sq ft would be 2,000,000 / 500,000 = $4 per sq ft.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n- Hardwood: $8/sq ft\n\n- Laminate: $4/sq ft\n\n- Carpet: $2/sq ft\n\nIf the average needs to be $4, maybe a mix where the average comes out to that. But the goal is also to maximize variety, meaning likely having all three types used, not just two.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- H = area in sq ft for hardwood\n\n- L = area in sq ft for laminate\n\n- C = area in sq ft for carpet\n\nWe have:\n\nH + L + C = 500,000 sq ft\n\nAnd the cost:\n\n8H + 4L + 2C \u2264 2,000,000 dollars\n\nI need to maximize variety, which could mean having all three types used to the extent possible without exceeding the budget.\n\nOne way to approach this is to set up the equations and see what combinations satisfy both the area and the cost constraints.\n\nFirst, from the area:\n\nC = 500,000 - H - L\n\nPlugging into the cost equation:\n\n8H + 4L + 2(500,000 - H - L) \u2264 2,000,000\n\nSimplify:\n\n8H + 4L + 1,000,000 - 2H - 2L \u2264 2,000,000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(8H - 2H) + (4L - 2L) + 1,000,000 \u2264 2,000,000\n\n6H + 2L + 1,000,000 \u2264 2,000,000\n\nSubtract 1,000,000 from both sides:\n\n6H + 2L \u2264 1,000,000\n\nI can simplify this further by dividing everything by 2:\n\n3H + L \u2264 500,000\n\nSo, L \u2264 500,000 - 3H\n\nNow, since L and C have to be non-negative, H has to be such that L is not negative. So:\n\n500,000 - 3H \u2265 0\n\n3H \u2264 500,000\n\nH \u2264 166,666.67 sq ft\n\nSimilarly, C = 500,000 - H - L \u2265 0\n\nBut since L \u2264 500,000 - 3H, then C = 500,000 - H - L \u2265 500,000 - H - (500,000 - 3H) = 500,000 - H - 500,000 + 3H = 2H \u2265 0\n\nWhich is always true as long as H \u2265 0.\n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\nH \u2264 166,666.67 sq ft\n\nL \u2264 500,000 - 3H\n\nC = 500,000 - H - L \u2265 0\n\nNow, to maximize variety, perhaps we should aim to use as much as possible of each type.\n\nBut since hardwood is the most expensive and carpet is the cheapest, to stay within budget, we need to balance how much of each we use.\n\nMaybe set H to its maximum possible, which is about 166,666 sq ft, then L = 500,000 - 3H.\n\nWait, L = 500,000 - 3H.\n\nSo if H = 166,666, then L = 500,000 - 3*166,666 = 500,000 - 500,000 = 0.\n\nSo in this case, C = 500,000 - H - L = 500,000 - 166,666 - 0 = 333,334 sq ft.\n\nSo, in this scenario:\n\nH = 166,666 sq ft\n\nL = 0 sq ft\n\nC = 333,334 sq ft\n\nCost would be:\n\n8*166,666 + 4*0 + 2*333,334 = 1,333,328 + 0 + 666,668 = 2,000,000 exactly.\n\nSo this combination uses only hardwood and carpet, no laminate.\n\nBut to maximize variety, maybe we should aim to have all three types.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set L to a certain value and see what H and C would be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think in terms of minimizing the most used option or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that to maximize variety, we should aim to have equal areas of each type, but that might not be possible within the budget.\n\nLet's see what happens if we try to have equal areas:\n\nH = L = C = 500,000 / 3 \u2248 166,666 sq ft each.\n\nThen, cost would be:\n\n8*166,666 + 4*166,666 + 2*166,666 = 1,333,328 + 666,664 + 333,332 = 2,333,324, which is over the budget of 2 million.\n\nSo that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set C to its maximum possible to save cost, then allocate the remaining budget to H and L.\n\nCarpet is the cheapest, so maximizing carpet would minimize the cost, allowing more expensive options within the budget.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize variety, not necessarily minimize cost.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that to maximize variety, we should have a certain proportion of each type.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think in terms of maximizing the Shannon entropy of the distribution of flooring types.\n\nBut that might be overcomplicating things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim to have at least a certain minimum amount of each type.\n\nFor example, require that each type is used in at least 10% of the total area.\n\nSo, minimum 50,000 sq ft of each type.\n\nThen, see if that's possible within the budget.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nSet H \u2265 50,000\n\nL \u2265 50,000\n\nC \u2265 50,000\n\nThen, H + L + C = 500,000\n\nSo, H + L + C = 500,000\n\nWith H, L, C \u2265 50,000\n\nNow, cost: 8H + 4L + 2C \u2264 2,000,000\n\nIs this possible?\n\nLet\u2019s see, if H = L = C = 50,000, then total cost is 8*50,000 + 4*50,000 + 2*50,000 = 400,000 + 200,000 + 100,000 = 700,000, which is well under the budget.\n\nBut perhaps we can allocate more to hardwood and laminate while still meeting the minimums.\n\nLet me set H = 50,000, L = 50,000, C = 400,000\n\nCost: 8*50,000 + 4*50,000 + 2*400,000 = 400,000 + 200,000 + 800,000 = 1,400,000, which is under budget.\n\nAlternatively, H = 50,000, L = 150,000, C = 300,000\n\nCost: 8*50,000 + 4*150,000 + 2*300,000 = 400,000 + 600,000 + 600,000 = 1,600,000\n\nStill under budget.\n\nAlternatively, H = 100,000, L = 100,000, C = 300,000\n\nCost: 8*100,000 + 4*100,000 + 2*300,000 = 800,000 + 400,000 + 600,000 = 1,800,000\n\nStill under budget.\n\nAlternatively, H = 100,000, L = 200,000, C = 200,000\n\nCost: 8*100,000 + 4*200,000 + 2*200,000 = 800,000 + 800,000 + 400,000 = 2,000,000\n\nThis is exactly the budget.\n\nSo, in this case, H = 100,000, L = 200,000, C = 200,000, total cost = $2,000,000.\n\nThis seems like a balanced approach, using at least 100,000 sq ft of each type, which might satisfy the variety requirement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for higher amounts of hardwood and laminate, but need to see if that's possible within the budget.\n\nLet me try H = 150,000, L = 150,000, C = 200,000\n\nCost: 8*150,000 + 4*150,000 + 2*200,000 = 1,200,000 + 600,000 + 400,000 = 2,200,000, which is over budget.\n\nNot feasible.\n\nAlternatively, H = 150,000, L = 100,000, C = 250,000\n\nCost: 8*150,000 + 4*100,000 + 2*250,000 = 1,200,000 + 400,000 + 500,000 = 2,100,000, still over budget.\n\nAlternatively, H = 150,000, L = 50,000, C = 300,000\n\nCost: 8*150,000 + 4*50,000 + 2*300,000 = 1,200,000 + 200,000 + 600,000 = 2,000,000 exactly.\n\nThis is also within budget, but L is only 50,000, which might not be sufficient variety.\n\nComparing this with the earlier combination where H = 100,000, L = 200,000, C = 200,000, which also totals $2,000,000.\n\nPerhaps the second option provides more variety since it has higher amounts of both laminate and carpet compared to hardwood.\n\nAlternatively, maybe aim for H = 50,000, L = 250,000, C = 200,000\n\nCost: 8*50,000 + 4*250,000 + 2*200,000 = 400,000 + 1,000,000 + 400,000 = 1,800,000, which is under budget.\n\nBut perhaps allocate the remaining budget to increase hardwood.\n\nRemaining budget is 2,000,000 - 1,800,000 = 200,000.\n\nIf I allocate that to hardwood, increasing H by 25,000 sq ft (since 25,000 * $8 = 200,000), then H = 75,000, L = 250,000, C = 200,000.\n\nTotal cost: 8*75,000 + 4*250,000 + 2*200,000 = 600,000 + 1,000,000 + 400,000 = 2,000,000.\n\nThis also fits the budget.\n\nComparing this with H = 100,000, L = 200,000, C = 200,000, and H = 150,000, L = 50,000, C = 300,000.\n\nWhich one maximizes variety?\n\nIt's a bit subjective, but perhaps the first one with H = 100,000, L = 200,000, C = 200,000 provides a good balance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe aim for H = 50,000, L = 200,000, C = 250,000\n\nCost: 8*50,000 + 4*200,000 + 2*250,000 = 400,000 + 800,000 + 500,000 = 1,700,000, which leaves 300,000 to allocate.\n\nIf I allocate that entirely to hardwood, H increases by 37,500 sq ft (since 37,500 * 8 = 300,000), so H = 87,500, L = 200,000, C = 250,000, total cost 2,000,000.\n\nAnother option.\n\nThis seems flexible, but perhaps there's a better way to maximize variety.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps define variety in terms of entropy.\n\nEntropy in information theory is a measure of uncertainty or variety.\n\nThe Shannon entropy for the distribution of flooring types could be calculated as:\n\nEntropy = -sum(p_i * log p_i)), where p_i is the proportion of each type.\n\nBut perhaps that's overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, just aim for as even a distribution as possible without violating the budget.\n\nGiven that, perhaps aim for H, L, C as close as possible to each other, within budget constraints.\n\nLet\u2019s try to set H = L = C = x\n\nThen, 3x = 500,000, so x \u2248 166,666\n\nBut as we saw earlier, the cost would be 8x + 4x + 2x = 14x\n\n14 * 166,666 \u2248 2,333,324, which is over budget.\n\nSo, not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, set H = a, L = b, C = c\n\nWith a + b + c = 500,000\n\nAnd 8a + 4b + 2c \u2264 2,000,000\n\nTo maximize variety, perhaps maximize the minimum of a, b, c.\n\nThis is similar to an optimization problem where we want to make the smallest allocation as large as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use linear programming to maximize a function that represents variety, subject to the constraints.\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the cost per sq ft.\n\nThe average cost needs to be $4 per sq ft, as we calculated earlier.\n\nSo, any combination where the weighted average cost is $4 or less would be acceptable.\n\nTo maximize variety, perhaps aim for a distribution where the costs are as spread out as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think in terms of having a certain percentage of each type.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that to maximize variety, we should have a mix where no single type dominates.\n\nBut it's still a bit vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about the difference between the maximum and minimum areas being minimized.\n\nSo, minimizing the difference between the largest and smallest areas.\n\nThis could be another way to maximize variety.\n\nLet\u2019s try to set up the problem that way.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nM = maximum of H, L, C\n\nm = minimum of H, L, C\n\nThen, aim to minimize M - m, subject to the constraints.\n\nThis could be a way to make the areas as evenly distributed as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express H, L, C in terms of their deviation from the average.\n\nThe average area per type would be 500,000 / 3 \u2248 166,666 sq ft.\n\nBut since that exceeds the budget, perhaps aim to get as close as possible to that average without exceeding the budget.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize some function representing variety, subject to the area and cost constraints.\n\nBut that might be too complicated for this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that to maximize variety, we should have all three types used in a way that their proportions are as equal as possible given the cost constraints.\n\nGiven that, perhaps express H and L in terms of C, or vice versa.\n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\nL \u2264 500,000 - 3H\n\nAnd C = 500,000 - H - L\n\nLet\u2019s try to express L in terms of H:\n\nL = 500,000 - 3H\n\nThen, C = 500,000 - H - L = 500,000 - H - (500,000 - 3H) = 2H\n\nSo, C = 2H\n\nNow, we can express the areas in terms of H:\n\nH = H\n\nL = 500,000 - 3H\n\nC = 2H\n\nNow, since L must be \u2265 0, 500,000 - 3H \u2265 0, so H \u2264 166,666.67\n\nAlso, C = 2H must be \u2265 0, which is always true as H \u2265 0.\n\nNow, to maximize variety, perhaps maximize H, since C = 2H and L decreases as H increases.\n\nBut wait, if H increases, L decreases, and C increases.\n\nSo, as H increases, C increases, and L decreases.\n\nThis might lead to less variety as L becomes smaller.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a sweet spot where H, L, and C are all positive and as balanced as possible.\n\nLet\u2019s try to find H such that H, L, and C are all positive and as close as possible.\n\nSo, H \u2264 166,666.67\n\nLet\u2019s choose H = 100,000\n\nThen, L = 500,000 - 3*100,000 = 200,000\n\nC = 2*100,000 = 200,000\n\nSo, H = 100,000, L = 200,000, C = 200,000\n\nTotal cost: 8*100,000 + 4*200,000 + 2*200,000 = 800,000 + 800,000 + 400,000 = 2,000,000\n\nThis seems like a balanced approach.\n\nAlternatively, H = 120,000\n\nThen, L = 500,000 - 3*120,000 = 500,000 - 360,000 = 140,000\n\nC = 2*120,000 = 240,000\n\nTotal cost: 8*120,000 + 4*140,000 + 2*240,000 = 960,000 + 560,000 + 480,000 = 2,000,000\n\nHere, H = 120,000, L = 140,000, C = 240,000\n\nComparing to the previous combination, H = 100,000, L = 200,000, C = 200,000\n\nIn the first, L and C are equal, in the second, C is larger than L.\n\nPerhaps the first one is more balanced in terms of variety.\n\nAlternatively, H = 110,000\n\nThen, L = 500,000 - 3*110,000 = 500,000 - 330,000 = 170,000\n\nC = 2*110,000 = 220,000\n\nTotal cost: 8*110,000 + 4*170,000 + 2*220,000 = 880,000 + 680,000 + 440,000 = 2,000,000\n\nSo, H = 110,000, L = 170,000, C = 220,000\n\nThis seems fairly balanced.\n\nComparing the three options:\n\nOption 1: H=100,000, L=200,000, C=200,000\n\nOption 2: H=110,000, L=170,000, C=220,000\n\nOption 3: H=120,000, L=140,000, C=240,000\n\nAll three options stay within the budget.\n\nTo decide which one maximizes variety, perhaps look at the standard deviation of the areas.\n\nOption 1: areas are 100,000, 200,000, 200,000\n\nMean is 166,666.67\n\nDeviation: -66,666.67, 33,333.33, 33,333.33\n\nVariance: (2*(33,333.33)^2 + (66,666.67)^2)/3 \u2248 2,222,222,222\n\nStandard deviation \u2248 47,140.45\n\nOption 2: 110,000, 170,000, 220,000\n\nMean: 166,666.67\n\nDeviation: -56,666.67, 3,333.33, 53,333.33\n\nVariance: (56,666.67^2 + 3,333.33^2 + 53,333.33^2)/3 \u2248 2,013,333,333\n\nStandard deviation \u2248 44,870.02\n\nOption 3: 120,000, 140,000, 240,000\n\nMean: 166,666.67\n\nDeviation: -46,666.67, -26,666.67, 73,333.33\n\nVariance: (46,666.67^2 + 26,666.67^2 + 73,333.33^2)/3 \u2248 2,966,666,667\n\nStandard deviation \u2248 54,463.72\n\nInterestingly, Option 2 has the lowest standard deviation, meaning the areas are closest to the mean, indicating more even distribution.\n\nTherefore, Option 2: H=110,000, L=170,000, C=220,000 might be the best in terms of maximizing variety.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that to maximize customer preferences, we should have a variety in terms of the types offered in different units, not just the area.\n\nFor example, some units could have hardwood, some laminate, and some carpet.\n\nBut in terms of the area allocated to each type, the above analysis applies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about allocating different flooring types to different units based on their size or location.\n\nBut given the problem's constraints, I think the above approach is sufficient.\n\nSo, the optimal combination is:\n\nHardwood: 110,000 sq ft\n\nLaminate: 170,000 sq ft\n\nCarpet: 220,000 sq ft\n\nThis maximizes the variety of flooring options while staying within the budget of $2,000,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Hardwood: } 110,000 \\text{ sq ft}, \\text{ Laminate: } 170,000 \\text{ sq ft}, \\text{ Carpet: } 220,000 \\text{ sq ft}} \\]"
