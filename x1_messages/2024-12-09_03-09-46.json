        "content": "So I have this statement here: \"If a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b], it must attain both its maximum and minimum values within that interval.\" I need to prove this. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I remember there's a theorem in calculus that states this exact thing. It's called the Extreme Value Theorem. So, maybe I can look that up to understand it better. But I should try to prove it myself first.\n\nAlright, so let's start with the basics. A function f is continuous on a closed interval [a, b]. That means that for every point c in [a, b], the limit of f as x approaches c exists and is equal to f(c). Also, since it's a closed interval, a and b are included.\n\nNow, I need to show that f attains both its maximum and minimum values in [a, b]. That means there exist points c and d in [a, b] such that f(c) \u2264 f(x) \u2264 f(d) for all x in [a, b].\n\nHmm, how can I approach this? Maybe I can use the fact that a continuous function on a closed interval is bounded. I think there's a theorem that says that a continuous function on a closed interval is bounded and attains its bounds.\n\nWait, that sounds too much like the Extreme Value Theorem itself. Maybe I need to prove that first.\n\nLet me try to prove that a continuous function on a closed interval is bounded. If I can show that, maybe I can extend it to show that it attains its maximum and minimum.\n\nSo, suppose f is continuous on [a, b]. I need to show that there exists a number M such that |f(x)| \u2264 M for all x in [a, b].\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that f is not bounded on [a, b]. That means for any M > 0, there exists an x in [a, b] such that |f(x)| > M.\n\nNow, since [a, b] is closed and bounded, it's compact. I think there's something about compactness and continuity that can be used here.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider sequences. If [a, b] is compact, then every sequence in [a, b] has a convergent subsequence that converges to a point in [a, b].\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which states that every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look back at some definitions.\n\nLet me recall that a set is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover. But I'm not sure how to apply that here.\n\nAlternatively, in metric spaces, compactness is equivalent to being complete and totally bounded. But maybe that's too advanced for now.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the fact that a continuous function maps compact sets to compact sets. If [a, b] is compact and f is continuous, then f([a, b]) is compact. And in the real numbers, compact sets are closed and bounded. Therefore, f([a, b]) is bounded.\n\nThat sounds promising. So, if f([a, b]) is bounded, then there exists M such that |f(x)| \u2264 M for all x in [a, b].\n\nNow, since f([a, b]) is also closed and bounded, it contains its supremum and infimum. Therefore, the maximum and minimum values are attained in [a, b].\n\nWait, but I need to show that the maximum and minimum are attained, not just that the function is bounded.\n\nLet me try to make this more rigorous.\n\nFirst, prove that f is bounded on [a, b].\n\nAssume, for contradiction, that f is unbounded on [a, b]. Then, for every n in the natural numbers, there exists x_n in [a, b] such that |f(x_n)| > n.\n\nNow, the sequence {x_n} is in [a, b], which is bounded. By the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, {x_n} has a convergent subsequence {x_{n_k}} that converges to some point c in [a, b] (since [a, b] is closed).\n\nNow, since f is continuous at c, the sequence {f(x_{n_k})} should converge to f(c). But wait, |f(x_{n_k})| > n_k, and n_k goes to infinity as k goes to infinity. Therefore, {f(x_{n_k})} diverges to infinity, which contradicts the fact that it should converge to f(c), a finite limit.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that f is unbounded must be false. Hence, f is bounded on [a, b].\n\nNow, since f is bounded, it has a least upper bound (supremum) and a greatest lower bound (infimum) in the real numbers. Let\u2019s denote the supremum by M and the infimum by m.\n\nI need to show that there exist points c and d in [a, b] such that f(c) = m and f(d) = M.\n\nLet's first consider the supremum M.\n\nDefine a sequence {y_k} in [a, b] such that f(y_k) approaches M as k goes to infinity. That is, for each k, choose y_k in [a, b] with M - 1/k < f(y_k) \u2264 M.\n\nThis is possible because M is the least upper bound, so for each k, there exists y_k in [a, b] such that f(y_k) is within 1/k of M.\n\nNow, the sequence {y_k} is in [a, b], which is compact, so by Bolzano-Weierstrass, it has a convergent subsequence {y_{k_j}} that converges to some point d in [a, b].\n\nSince f is continuous at d, the sequence {f(y_{k_j})} converges to f(d).\n\nBut {f(y_{k_j})} is a subsequence of {f(y_k)}, which converges to M (since f(y_k) approaches M).\n\nTherefore, {f(y_{k_j})} also converges to M, and since it converges to f(d), we have f(d) = M.\n\nThus, the maximum value M is attained at d in [a, b].\n\nSimilarly, for the infimum m, we can construct a sequence {z_k} in [a, b] such that m \u2264 f(z_k) < m + 1/k.\n\nAgain, by Bolzano-Weierstrass, {z_k} has a convergent subsequence {z_{l_j}} converging to some point c in [a, b].\n\nBy continuity of f at c, {f(z_{l_j})} converges to f(c).\n\nBut {f(z_{l_j})} is a subsequence of {f(z_k)}, which converges to m.\n\nTherefore, {f(z_{l_j})} converges to m, and since it converges to f(c), we have f(c) = m.\n\nThus, the minimum value m is attained at c in [a, b].\n\nTherefore, we have shown that if f is continuous on [a, b], it attains both its maximum and minimum values in [a, b].\n\nI think this completes the proof.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{If a function is continuous on a closed interval } [a, b], \\text{ it must attain both its maximum and minimum values within that interval.}}"
