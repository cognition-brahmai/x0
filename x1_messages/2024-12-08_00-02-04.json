        "content": "So there's a class with 25 students in total, and out of those, 12 are boys. The rest are girls, right? So, first, I need to find out how many girls there are. That should be straightforward: total students minus boys. So, 25 minus 12 equals 13 girls. Okay, so there are 13 girls in the class.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the ratio of boys to girls. A ratio compares one quantity to another, so in this case, it's comparing the number of boys to the number of girls. So, it's boys compared to girls.\n\nI have 12 boys and 13 girls. So, the ratio should be 12 to 13. Ratios can be written in different ways: with a colon, like 12:13, or as a fraction, 12/13. But since it's a ratio of boys to girls, 12:13 is probably the most standard way to write it.\n\nWait a minute, does the ratio need to be simplified? Like, is there a greatest common divisor for 12 and 13 that I can divide both by to make the ratio smaller? Let's see, 12 and 13 are consecutive numbers, and since 13 is a prime number, the only common divisor is 1. So, the ratio is already in its simplest form.\n\nJust to double-check, let's confirm the numbers again. Total students are 25, boys are 12, so girls are 25 minus 12, which is indeed 13. So, the ratio of boys to girls is 12:13.\n\nI think that's the answer. But maybe I should consider if the question is asking for anything else, like the ratio of boys to total students or something else. No, it specifically says the ratio of boys to girls.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with 12:13 as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12:13} \\]"
