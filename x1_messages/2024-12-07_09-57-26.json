        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to develop a Golang web server that serves static files and also has an API endpoint to calculate the nth Fibonacci number using memoization, with goroutines for handling multiple requests concurrently. Sounds like a good project to practice Go's concurrency features and web handling.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a basic web server in Go that can serve static files from a specified directory. I know that Go's standard library has the http package, which should be sufficient for this task. I can use the http.FileServer handler to serve static files.\n\nSo, to serve static files from a directory, say \"static\", I can do something like this:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tfs := http.FileServer(http.Dir(\"static\"))\n\thttp.Handle(\"/\", fs)\n\n\tlog.Println(\"Starting server on :8080\")\n\terr := http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis sets up a server that serves files from the \"static\" directory when you access the root URL.\n\nNext, I need to add an API endpoint to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. The requirement is to use memoization to optimize the calculation, especially for larger values of n. Memoization will store the results of previous calculations to avoid redundant computations.\n\nI should design an endpoint, perhaps something like /api/fibonacci?n=10, where n is the position in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nTo implement memoization, I can use a map to store previously computed Fibonacci numbers. Since multiple goroutines might access this map concurrently, I need to make sure it's thread-safe. Go's map type is not safe for concurrent reads and writes without additional synchronization.\n\nOne way to handle this is to use a sync.RWMutex to protect access to the map.\n\nHere's a rough idea of how the memoization part could look:\n\n```go\ntype fibMemo struct {\n\tsync.RWMutex\n\tcache map[int]int\n}\n\nvar memo fibMemo\n\nfunc init() {\n\tmemo.cache = make(map[int]int)\n\tmemo.cache[0] = 0\n\tmemo.cache[1] = 1\n}\n\nfunc fibonacci(n int) int {\n\tmemo.RLock()\n\tif val, found := memo.cache[n]; found {\n\t\tmemo.RUnlock()\n\t\treturn val\n\t}\n\tmemo.RUnlock()\n\n\tmemo.Lock()\n\tdefer memo.Unlock()\n\t// Double-check if another goroutine has computed it while acquiring the lock.\n\tif val, found := memo.cache[n]; found {\n\t\treturn val\n\t}\n\n\tval := fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n\tmemo.cache[n] = val\n\treturn val\n}\n```\n\nThis function first tries to retrieve the result from the cache using a read lock. If it's not found, it acquires a write lock and computes the value, storing it in the cache.\n\nNow, I need to expose this functionality via an HTTP endpoint. I can add a handler for \"/api/fibonacci\" that expects a query parameter \"n\", parses it to an integer, calls the fibonacci function, and returns the result as JSON.\n\nSomething like this:\n\n```go\nfunc fibonacciHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tnStr := r.URL.Query().Get(\"n\")\n\tif nStr == \"\" {\n\t\thttp.Error(w, \"Missing 'n' parameter\", http.StatusBadRequest)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tn, err := strconv.Atoi(nStr)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\thttp.Error(w, \"Invalid 'n' parameter\", http.StatusBadRequest)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tif n < 0 {\n\t\thttp.Error(w, \"'n' must be a non-negative integer\", http.StatusBadRequest)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tresult := fibonacci(n)\n\tw.Header().Set(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n\tjson.NewEncoder(w).Encode(map[string]int{\"result\": result})\n}\n```\n\nI need to register this handler in the main function:\n\n```go\nhttp.HandleFunc(\"/api/fibonacci\", fibonacciHandler)\n```\n\nNow, regarding the concurrent handling of requests using goroutines. Go's http server already handles requests concurrently using goroutines under the hood, so each incoming request is handled in its own goroutine. Therefore, I don't need to manually spawn goroutines for each request; the http server takes care of that.\n\nHowever, in the fibonacci function, recursive calls will also run in the same goroutine, which might not be ideal for very large n due to stack overflow risks. To mitigate this, I could consider an iterative approach to computing Fibonacci numbers, which would be more efficient and safer for large n.\n\nHere's an iterative version with memoization:\n\n```go\nfunc fibonacci(n int) int {\n\tmemo.RLock()\n\tif val, found := memo.cache[n]; found {\n\t\tmemo.RUnlock()\n\t\treturn val\n\t}\n\tmemo.RUnlock()\n\n\tmemo.Lock()\n\tdefer memo.Unlock()\n\n\t// Double-check if another goroutine has computed it while acquiring the lock.\n\tif val, found := memo.cache[n]; found {\n\t\treturn val\n\t}\n\n\ta, b := 0, 1\n\tfor i := 1; i < n; i++ {\n\t\ta, b = b, a+b\n\t}\n\n\tmemo.cache[n] = b\n\treturn b\n}\n```\n\nThis iterative approach avoids the stack overflow issue and is more efficient in terms of both time and space.\n\nI should also consider adding some error handling for very large values of n, as integers can overflow in Go. But for the sake of simplicity, I'll assume that n is within a reasonable range.\n\nAdditionally, I might want to add some logging to see what's happening, especially during development.\n\nI can use the standard log package for this.\n\nFinally, I need to make sure that all resources are properly cleaned up when the program exits, but with this setup, it's not strictly necessary since we're using only goroutines and no external resources.\n\nPutting it all together, here's what the complete code might look like:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"strconv\"\n\t\"sync\"\n\n\t\"github.com/go-chi/chi\"\n\t\"github.com/go-chi/chi/middleware\"\n)\n\ntype fibMemo struct {\n\tsync.RWMutex\n\tcache map[int]int\n}\n\nvar memo fibMemo\n\nfunc init() {\n\tmemo.cache = make(map[int]int)\n\tmemo.cache[0] = 0\n\tmemo.cache[1] = 1\n}\n\nfunc fibonacci(n int) int {\n\tmemo.RLock()\n\tif val, found := memo.cache[n]; found {\n\t\tmemo.RUnlock()\n\t\treturn val\n\t}\n\tmemo.RUnlock()\n\n\tmemo.Lock()\n\tdefer memo.Unlock()\n\n\tif val, found := memo.cache[n]; found {\n\t\treturn val\n\t}\n\n\ta, b := 0, 1\n\tfor i := 1; i < n; i++ {\n\t\ta, b = b, a+b\n\t}\n\n\tmemo.cache[n] = b\n\treturn b\n}\n\nfunc fibonacciHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tnStr := r.URL.Query().Get(\"n\")\n\tif nStr == \"\" {\n\t\thttp.Error(w, \"Missing 'n' parameter\", http.StatusBadRequest)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tn, err := strconv.Atoi(nStr)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\thttp.Error(w, \"Invalid 'n' parameter\", http.StatusBadRequest)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tif n < 0 {\n\t\thttp.Error(w, \"'n' must be a non-negative integer\", http.StatusBadRequest)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tresult := fibonacci(n)\n\tw.Header().Set(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n\tjson.NewEncoder(w).Encode(map[string]int{\"result\": result})\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tr := chi.NewRouter()\n\tr.Use(middleware.Logger)\n\tr.Use(middleware.RequestID)\n\tr.Use(middleware.RealIP)\n\tr.Use(middleware.Recoverer)\n\n\tr.Get(\"/api/fibonacci\", fibonacciHandler)\n\n\tfs := http.FileServer(http.Dir(\"static\"))\n\tr.Handle(\"/*\", fs)\n\n\tlog.Println(\"Starting server on :8080\")\n\terr := http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", r)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nIn this version, I've used the chi router for better URL handling and added some middleware for logging, request ID, real IP, and recovery from panics.\n\nI need to make sure that the \"static\" directory exists and contains the files I want to serve.\n\nI can test the static file serving by placing an index.html file in the \"static\" directory and accessing http://localhost:8080/ in a web browser.\n\nTo test the Fibonacci API, I can access http://localhost:8080/api/fibonacci?n=10 and expect a JSON response with the 10th Fibonacci number.\n\nI should also consider adding more robust error handling and perhaps rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.\n\nOverall, this should fulfill the requirements of serving static files and providing a concurrent Fibonacci number calculation API using memoization in Go.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo achieve the task of creating a Golang web server that serves static files and provides an API endpoint to calculate the nth Fibonacci number using memoization, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up a basic web server to serve static files.**\n2. **Implement an API endpoint to calculate the nth Fibonacci number using memoization.**\n3. **Ensure the server handles multiple requests concurrently using goroutines.**\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Static File Serving:**\n   - Use Go's `http.FileServer` handler to serve files from a specified directory.\n\n2. **Fibonacci API Endpoint:**\n   - Implement a memoized Fibonacci function to optimize calculations.\n   - Use a `sync.RWMutex` to handle concurrent access to the memoization cache.\n   - Create an HTTP handler for the API endpoint that accepts a query parameter `n` and returns the nth Fibonacci number.\n\n3. **Concurrency:**\n   - Leverage Go's built-in concurrency support in the `http` package, which handles each request in its own goroutine.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"strconv\"\n\t\"sync\"\n\n\t\"github.com/go-chi/chi\"\n\t\"github.com/go-chi/chi/middleware\"\n)\n\ntype fibMemo struct {\n\tsync.RWMutex\n\tcache map[int]int\n}\n\nvar memo fibMemo\n\nfunc init() {\n\tmemo.cache = make(map[int]int)\n\tmemo.cache[0] = 0\n\tmemo.cache[1] = 1\n}\n\nfunc fibonacci(n int) int {\n\tmemo.RLock()\n\tif val, found := memo.cache[n]; found {\n\t\tmemo.RUnlock()\n\t\treturn val\n\t}\n\tmemo.RUnlock()\n\n\tmemo.Lock()\n\tdefer memo.Unlock()\n\n\tif val, found := memo.cache[n]; found {\n\t\treturn val\n\t}\n\n\ta, b := 0, 1\n\tfor i := 1; i < n; i++ {\n\t\ta, b = b, a+b\n\t}\n\n\tmemo.cache[n] = b\n\treturn b\n}\n\nfunc fibonacciHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tnStr := r.URL.Query().Get(\"n\")\n\tif nStr == \"\" {\n\t\thttp.Error(w, \"Missing 'n' parameter\", http.StatusBadRequest)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tn, err := strconv.Atoi(nStr)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\thttp.Error(w, \"Invalid 'n' parameter\", http.StatusBadRequest)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tif n < 0 {\n\t\thttp.Error(w, \"'n' must be a non-negative integer\", http.StatusBadRequest)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tresult := fibonacci(n)\n\tw.Header().Set(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n\tjson.NewEncoder(w).Encode(map[string]int{\"result\": result})\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tr := chi.NewRouter()\n\tr.Use(middleware.Logger)\n\tr.Use(middleware.RequestID)\n\tr.Use(middleware.RealIP)\n\tr.Use(middleware.Recoverer)\n\n\tr.Get(\"/api/fibonacci\", fibonacciHandler)\n\n\tfs := http.FileServer(http.Dir(\"static\"))\n\tr.Handle(\"/*\", fs)\n\n\tlog.Println(\"Starting server on :8080\")\n\terr := http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", r)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Static File Serving:**\n   - The `http.FileServer` serves files from the \"static\" directory.\n   - The router handles all other paths with `r.Handle(\"/*\", fs)`.\n\n2. **Fibonacci API Endpoint:**\n   - The `fibonacciHandler` function handles GET requests to `/api/fibonacci`.\n   - It extracts the `n` parameter from the query string, validates it, and computes the nth Fibonacci number using the memoized function.\n   - The result is returned as a JSON object.\n\n3. **Concurrency:**\n   - The Go HTTP server handles each request in its own goroutine, enabling concurrent processing.\n   - The memoization cache is protected by a read-write mutex to ensure safe concurrent access.\n\nThis setup ensures that the server is efficient, handles multiple requests concurrently, and provides both static file serving and dynamic API functionality."
