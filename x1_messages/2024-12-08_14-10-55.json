        "content": "Let's see. The train goes from City A to City B, which is 120 miles apart, and it travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. So, first, I need to figure out how long the journey would take without any stops.\n\nIf the distance is 120 miles and the speed is 60 miles per hour, then time equals distance divided by speed, right? So, time = 120 miles / 60 mph = 2 hours. That's the time without any stops.\n\nBut, there's an unscheduled stop halfway through the journey for 30 minutes due to technical issues. Halfway means at the 60-mile mark, since the total distance is 120 miles.\n\nSo, the train travels the first half, which is 60 miles at 60 mph, which takes 1 hour. Then it stops for 30 minutes, and then it travels the second half, another 60 miles at 60 mph, which takes another hour.\n\nSo, total time is 1 hour (first half) + 30 minutes (stop) + 1 hour (second half) = 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The total distance is 120 miles, speed is 60 mph, so normally it should take 2 hours. But with a 30-minute stop, it should indeed take an additional 30 minutes, making it 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
