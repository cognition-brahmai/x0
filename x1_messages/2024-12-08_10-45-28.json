It connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and is one of the most strategically important straits in the world due to the significant volume of international shipping that passes through it. The narrowest point is about 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) wide, allowing for easy visual contact between the Spanish coast of Europe and the Moroccan coast of Africa."
