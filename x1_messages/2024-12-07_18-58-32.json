        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many boys and girls are in the class.\n\nThe class has 40 students, and 60% of them are boys. So, the number of boys is:\n\nNumber of boys = 60% of 40 = 0.60 \u00d7 40 = 24 boys\n\nSince the rest are girls, the number of girls is:\n\nNumber of girls = Total students - Number of boys = 40 - 24 = 16 girls\n\nNext, we need to find out how many boys and girls passed the exam.\n\n75% of the boys passed the exam, so:\n\nNumber of boys who passed = 75% of 24 = 0.75 \u00d7 24 = 18 boys\n\n80% of the girls passed the exam, so:\n\nNumber of girls who passed = 80% of 16 = 0.80 \u00d7 16 = 12.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a student, we'll round it to 13 girls\n\nNow, the total number of students who passed the exam is:\n\nTotal passed = Number of boys who passed + Number of girls who passed = 18 + 13 = 31 students\n\nTo find the percentage of the total class that passed the exam, we use the formula:\n\nPercentage passed = (Total passed / Total students) \u00d7 100 = (31 / 40) \u00d7 100 = 77.5%\n\nSo, 77.5% of the total class passed the exam.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{77.5\\%} \\]"
