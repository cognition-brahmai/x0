        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that. Let's create a Ruby script that does exactly what you've described. We'll need to read a directory path from the command line, traverse the directory recursively, count the number of files and directories, and calculate their sizes in bytes.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Ruby installed on your system. You can check this by running `ruby -v` in your terminal. If Ruby is not installed, you can download it from https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/.\n\nNow, let's write the script step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Read the Directory Path from the Command Line\n\nWe'll use the `ARGV` array to get the directory path provided as a command-line argument.\n\n```ruby\nif ARGV.length != 1\n  puts \"Usage: ruby script.rb /path/to/directory\"\n  exit\nend\n\ndirectory_path = ARGV[0]\n```\n\n### Step 2: Check if the Provided Path is a Directory\n\nBefore proceeding, we need to ensure that the provided path is indeed a directory.\n\n```ruby\nif !File.directory?(directory_path)\n  puts \"Error: #{directory_path} is not a directory.\"\n  exit\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Traverse the Directory Recursively\n\nWe'll use the `Dir.glob` method with the `**/*` pattern to recursively traverse all entries in the directory.\n\n```ruby\nentries = Dir.glob(File.join(directory_path, '**', '*'))\n```\n\n### Step 4: Count Files and Directories and Calculate Sizes\n\nWe'll initialize counters for files and directories and variables to store their total sizes.\n\n```ruby\nfile_count = 0\ndir_count = 0\ntotal_file_size = 0\ntotal_dir_size = 0\n\nentries.each do |entry|\n  if File.file?(entry)\n    file_count += 1\n    total_file_size += File.size(entry)\n  elsif File.directory?(entry)\n    dir_count += 1\n    # Directories don't have a size in the same way files do,\n    # but if you want to include the size of all files within the directory,\n    # you can calculate it separately.\n    # For now, we'll consider directory size as 0.\n    total_dir_size += 0\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### Step 5: Display the Results\n\nFinally, we'll print the counts and sizes.\n\n```ruby\nputs \"Total files: #{file_count}, Total size: #{total_file_size} bytes\"\nputs \"Total directories: #{dir_count}, Total size: #{total_dir_size} bytes\"\n```\n\n### Complete Script\n\nPutting it all together, here's the complete Ruby script:\n\n```ruby\nif ARGV.length != 1\n  puts \"Usage: ruby script.rb /path/to/directory\"\n  exit\nend\n\ndirectory_path = ARGV[0]\n\nif !File.directory?(directory_path)\n  puts \"Error: #{directory_path} is not a directory.\"\n  exit\nend\n\nentries = Dir.glob(File.join(directory_path, '**', '*'))\n\nfile_count = 0\ndir_count = 0\ntotal_file_size = 0\ntotal_dir_size = 0\n\nentries.each do |entry|\n  if File.file?(entry)\n    file_count += 1\n    total_file_size += File.size(entry)\n  elsif File.directory?(entry)\n    dir_count += 1\n    # Directories don't have a size in the same way files do,\n    # but if you want to include the size of all files within the directory,\n    # you can calculate it separately.\n    # For now, we'll consider directory size as 0.\n    total_dir_size += 0\n  end\nend\n\nputs \"Total files: #{file_count}, Total size: #{total_file_size} bytes\"\nputs \"Total directories: #{dir_count}, Total size: #{total_dir_size} bytes\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading Command-Line Arguments:** The script checks if exactly one argument is provided, which should be the directory path.\n2. **Validation:** It verifies that the provided path is a directory.\n3. **Traversal:** It uses `Dir.glob` with the `**/*` pattern to get all entries recursively.\n4. **Counting and Sizing:** It iterates through each entry, counts files and directories, and sums up the sizes of files.\n5. **Output:** It displays the total counts and sizes.\n\nSave this script to a file, for example, `directory_stats.rb`, and run it from the command line like this:\n\n```sh\nruby directory_stats.rb /path/to/directory\n```\n\nReplace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path you want to analyze.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
