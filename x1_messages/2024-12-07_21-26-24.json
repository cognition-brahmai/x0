        "content": "So the restaurant has two types of tables, right? 15 tables that each have four seats, and 10 tables that each have six seats. And we want to know how many customers the restaurant can accommodate if it's operating at full capacity. That means all tables are full with customers sitting in all the seats.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many seats are there in total. To do that, I should calculate the total number of seats from the four-seat tables and add that to the total number of seats from the six-seat tables.\n\nSo, for the four-seat tables:\n\nNumber of four-seat tables: 15\n\nSeats per table: 4\n\nTotal seats from four-seat tables: 15 tables * 4 seats/table = 60 seats\n\nNext, for the six-seat tables:\n\nNumber of six-seat tables: 10\n\nSeats per table: 6\n\nTotal seats from six-seat tables: 10 tables * 6 seats/table = 60 seats\n\nNow, to find the total seating capacity, I add both totals together:\n\nTotal seats = seats from four-seat tables + seats from six-seat tables\n\nTotal seats = 60 + 60 = 120\n\nTherefore, the restaurant can accommodate 120 customers at full capacity.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps there are some restrictions or additional factors I should consider, like space between tables or staff availability, but based on the information given, it seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of the number of tables and their seating capacities. So, 15 tables with 4 seats each and 10 tables with 6 seats each.\n\nAnother way to calculate this could be to find the total number of tables and some average seating per table, but that might be more complicated than necessary. Since the tables have different seating capacities, it's better to calculate each type separately and then sum them up.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other information that might affect the seating capacity. For example, is there a possibility that some seats are not usable due to obstructions or if some tables are reserved for specific purposes? But again, based on the information provided, it seems like all seats are available for customers.\n\nAlso, I should consider if the restaurant has any standing room or additional seating areas, but since it's not mentioned, I'll assume that only the seated capacity is considered.\n\nMoreover, perhaps there are regulations or permits that limit the number of customers allowed in the restaurant, but again, without that information, I can't factor that in.\n\nGiven that, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider that some tables might be designed for private sections or have reduced seating due to design elements, but again, with the information provided, it seems like all seats are available for customers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the restaurant has a bar area with additional seating, but since it's not mentioned, I shouldn't assume that.\n\nSo, sticking to the given data, 15 tables with 4 seats and 10 tables with 6 seats, totaling 120 seats.\n\nTherefore, the restaurant can accommodate 120 customers at full capacity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
