        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're told that in a certain city, the ratio of men to women is 3:4, and there are 28,000 more women than men. We need to find out how many men and women there are in the city.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a ratio means. A ratio of 3:4 means that for every 3 men, there are 4 women. It's like dividing the city's population into parts where men make up 3 parts and women make up 4 parts.\n\nNow, let's denote the number of men as M and the number of women as W. According to the ratio, M/W = 3/4.\n\nBut we also know that there are 28,000 more women than men, so W = M + 28,000.\n\nWe can substitute this into the ratio equation:\n\nM / (M + 28,000) = 3/4\n\nNow, we can solve for M.\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n4M = 3(M + 28,000)\n\n4M = 3M + 84,000\n\nSubtract 3M from both sides:\n\n4M - 3M = 84,000\n\nM = 84,000\n\nSo, there are 84,000 men in the city.\n\nNow, to find the number of women, we use the earlier equation:\n\nW = M + 28,000 = 84,000 + 28,000 = 112,000\n\nTherefore, there are 84,000 men and 112,000 women in the city.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check this to make sure it makes sense.\n\nIf there are 84,000 men and 112,000 women, the difference is indeed 112,000 - 84,000 = 28,000, which matches the given information.\n\nAlso, checking the ratio: 84,000 : 112,000 simplifies to 84/112 = 3/4, which is the given ratio.\n\nSo, our answer seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is to consider the ratio as parts. Since the ratio is 3:4, we can think of men as 3 parts and women as 4 parts, meaning there is a difference of 1 part between them.\n\nGiven that this 1 part equals 28,000 (since there are 28,000 more women than men), we can find the value of one part and then calculate the total number of men and women.\n\nSo, 1 part = 28,000\n\nTherefore, men = 3 parts = 3 * 28,000 = 84,000\n\nWomen = 4 parts = 4 * 28,000 = 112,000\n\nThis matches our previous calculation.\n\nSo, the city has 84,000 men and 112,000 women.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{84000 \\text{ men and } 112000 \\text{ women}} \\]"
