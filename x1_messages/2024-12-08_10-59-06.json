        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to compile a list of 21 words that start with \"pre\". Now, \"pre\" is a prefix that usually means \"before\" or \"in advance.\" It's pretty common in English, so there should be plenty of words to choose from. Let me start brainstorming some categories to make this easier.\n\nFirst, I can think of words related to time, since \"pre\" often indicates something happening before something else. Like \"prelude,\" which is an introduction or a preliminary event. Another one is \"preview,\" which means to see something in advance, before it's officially released or available to the public.\n\nIn the realm of prefixes, there are words like \"prefix\" itself, which is a letter or group of letters added to the beginning of a word to change its meaning. Similarly, \"predict\" means to say or estimate what will happen in the future based on present trends and past experience.\n\nLet's consider words related to preparation or\u9884\u5148\u884c\u52a8. For example, \"prepare\" means to make something ready for a specific purpose or event. \"Prevent\" is another one, which means to stop something from happening, especially something bad.\n\nIn academia, there are terms like \"preschool,\" which refers to education for children before they start formal schooling, usually before the age of five or six. \"Prestudy\" might refer to an initial study or research done before a main project or experiment.\n\nIn law and business, there are terms like \"pretrial,\" which refers to the period before a trial begins, during which various legal procedures and hearings take place. \"Preapproved\" is another one, often used in finance to indicate that someone has been approved for a loan or credit card before formally applying.\n\nIn technology, there's \"preinstall,\" which means to install software or applications on a computer or device before it's delivered to the user. \"Preexisting\" refers to something that existed before a particular time or event, like a preexisting condition in insurance terminology.\n\nIn everyday language, there's \"preference,\" which means a liking or preference for one thing over another. \"Pretend\" means to act as if something were true, even though it's not.\n\nLet's see, in the context of food and cooking, there's \"preheat,\" which means to heat an oven or other appliance to a desired temperature before starting to cook. \"Prepackaged\" refers to items that are packaged or prepared in advance, often for convenience.\n\nIn publishing, there's \"prepublication,\" which refers to activities or materials related to a book or article before it's officially published. \"Preliminary\" means occurring or done at the beginning; prior to the main activity.\n\nIn sports, there's \"preseason,\" which is the period before the official start of a sports season, often used for training and practice games.\n\nIn personal development, there's \"premeditated,\" which means something that is thought about and planned in advance, often with malicious intent.\n\nIn environmental science, there's \"prevalent,\" which means widespread or commonly occurring, especially in a particular area or during a specific time.\n\nIn history, there's \"precolonial,\" referring to the time before a country or region was colonized by another power.\n\nIn medicine, there's \"preoperative,\" which relates to the period before a surgical operation.\n\nIn fashion, there's \"pret-a-porter,\" which is French for \"ready to wear,\" referring to clothing that is mass-produced and sold in standardized sizes.\n\nHmm, I think I have more than 21 now. Let me list them out to make sure:\n\n1. Prelude\n2. Preview\n3. Prefix\n4. Predict\n5. Prepare\n6. Prevent\n7. Preschool\n8. Prestudy\n9. Pretrial\n10. Preapproved\n11. Preinstall\n12. Preexisting\n13. Preference\n14. Pretend\n15. Preheat\n16. Prepackaged\n17. Prepublication\n18. Preliminary\n19. Preseason\n20. Premeditated\n21. Prevalent\n\nThat's 21 words starting with \"pre.\" I could keep going, but I think this covers a good variety of categories and contexts. If needed, I can add more, but for now, this should suffice.\n\n**Final List:**\n\n1. Prelude\n2. Preview\n3. Prefix\n4. Predict\n5. Prepare\n6. Prevent\n7. Preschool\n8. Prestudy\n9. Pretrial\n10. Preapproved\n11. Preinstall\n12. Preexisting\n13. Preference\n14. Pretend\n15. Preheat\n16. Prepackaged\n17. Prepublication\n18. Preliminary\n19. Preseason\n20. Premeditated\n21. Prevalent"
