        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a train traveling between two cities that are 100 miles apart. On its first trip, it makes a 20-minute stop halfway through the journey, and the total travel time for this trip is 2 hours and 40 minutes. On the second trip, there are no stops, and we need to find out how long this trip took.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"halfway through the journey\" means. Since the distance between the two cities is 100 miles, halfway would be at the 50-mile mark. So, the train stops for 20 minutes at the 50-mile point on its way to the destination.\n\nThe total travel time for the first trip is 2 hours and 40 minutes. This includes both the moving time and the 20-minute stop. So, to find out how much time the train was actually moving, I should subtract the stop time from the total travel time.\n\nLet's convert everything to minutes for easier calculations.\n\n- Total travel time for the first trip: 2 hours and 40 minutes.\n\n- 2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.\n\n- So, total travel time = 120 minutes + 40 minutes = 160 minutes.\n\n- Stop time: 20 minutes.\n\n- Therefore, moving time for the first trip = total travel time - stop time = 160 minutes - 20 minutes = 140 minutes.\n\nNow, the train travels 100 miles in 140 minutes on the first trip, including the stop. Wait, no, actually, the moving time is 140 minutes for 100 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me think again.\n\nActually, the train makes a stop halfway, which is at 50 miles, after which it continues for another 50 miles. So, the moving time is divided into two halves, each covering 50 miles.\n\nBut the stop is made halfway, so the train moves for a certain time to cover the first 50 miles, stops for 20 minutes, and then moves for another certain time to cover the next 50 miles.\n\nGiven that the train travels at a constant speed, the time to cover each 50-mile segment should be the same.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let \\( t \\) be the time in minutes to cover 50 miles.\n\n- Then, the total moving time is \\( 2t \\).\n\n- The total travel time is moving time plus stop time: \\( 2t + 20 \\) minutes.\n\n- We know the total travel time is 160 minutes.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 2t + 20 = 160 \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ 2t = 160 - 20 \\]\n\n\\[ 2t = 140 \\]\n\n\\[ t = 70 \\] minutes.\n\nSo, it takes 70 minutes to cover each 50-mile segment.\n\nTherefore, the total moving time for the entire 100 miles is \\( 2 \\times 70 = 140 \\) minutes.\n\nNow, on the second trip, there are no stops, so the total travel time is just the moving time.\n\nTherefore, the second trip took 140 minutes.\n\nBut let's double-check this reasoning to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the speed of the train.\n\nSince it covers 50 miles in 70 minutes, the speed \\( s \\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} = \\frac{50 \\text{ miles}}{70 \\text{ minutes}} \\]\n\nBut to make it consistent, let's convert time to hours.\n\n\\[ 70 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{70}{60} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{7}{6} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{50}{\\frac{7}{6}} = 50 \\times \\frac{6}{7} = \\frac{300}{7} \\approx 42.857 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nNow, for the second trip, covering 100 miles at this constant speed, the time \\( t \\) is:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{100}{\\frac{300}{7}} = 100 \\times \\frac{7}{300} = \\frac{700}{300} = \\frac{7}{3} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nConvert \\( \\frac{7}{3} \\) hours to minutes:\n\n\\[ \\frac{7}{3} \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 140 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, again, we get 140 minutes for the second trip.\n\nAlternatively, since the train travels at a constant speed, the time taken should be directly proportional to the distance.\n\nIn the first trip, without stops, it would have taken 140 minutes to travel 100 miles.\n\nWith stops, the total time is 160 minutes, which includes the 140 minutes of moving and 20 minutes of stopping.\n\nIn the second trip, there are no stops, so the time should indeed be 140 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 140 minutes, which is 2 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nBut the question might expect the answer in hours and minutes or just in minutes.\n\nWait, the question asks, \"how long did the second trip take?\" and previously, times were given in hours and minutes.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to express the answer in hours and minutes.\n\n140 minutes is 2 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nSo, the second trip took 2 hours and 20 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2\\ \\text{hours}\\ 20\\ \\text{minutes}} \\]"
