        "content": "So the company wants to offer free gym memberships to all its employees to improve their wellness program. There are 5,000 employees, and each gym membership costs $500 per year. The average salary is $60,000 per year, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant to the calculation here.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total annual cost of providing these gym memberships. Since each membership costs $500 and there are 5,000 employees, I can multiply those two numbers to get the total cost.\n\nTotal cost = number of employees \u00d7 cost per membership\n\nTotal cost = 5,000 \u00d7 $500 = $2,500,000 per year.\n\nSo, the company would spend $2.5 million annually on gym memberships.\n\nNow, the next part is to compare this cost to the potential savings from reduced healthcare costs and increased productivity. The assumption is that regular exercise leads to a 5% reduction in sick days taken.\n\nI need to figure out how much the company currently spends on healthcare and how much productivity is lost due to sick days. But, the problem doesn't provide specific numbers for current healthcare costs or the value of sick days taken. So, I might need to make some assumptions here.\n\nLet's start by trying to estimate the savings from reduced sick days.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many sick days are currently taken by employees on average.\n\nUnfortunately, the problem doesn't provide this information. So, I'll have to make an assumption. Let's assume that, on average, each employee takes 10 sick days per year. This is just a guess, and in reality, it could be different, but I need some number to work with.\n\nSo, average sick days per employee per year = 10\n\nTotal sick days for all employees = 5,000 \u00d7 10 = 50,000 sick days per year.\n\nNow, if regular exercise leads to a 5% reduction in sick days, then the reduction would be:\n\nReduced sick days = 5% of 50,000 = 0.05 \u00d7 50,000 = 2,500 sick days.\n\nSo, the company would see 2,500 fewer sick days per year.\n\nNext, I need to quantify the value of these reduced sick days. This could be in terms of productivity saved.\n\nAssuming that each employee's daily productivity is roughly their annual salary divided by the number of working days in a year.\n\nLet's assume there are 250 working days in a year. So,\n\nDaily salary = $60,000 / 250 = $240 per day.\n\nTherefore, the value of one sick day is $240 in lost productivity.\n\nSo, the value of 2,500 reduced sick days would be:\n\n2,500 \u00d7 $240 = $600,000 per year.\n\nTherefore, the company could save $600,000 per year in productivity gains from reduced sick days.\n\nBut, the problem also mentions potential savings from reduced healthcare costs. However, without specific data on current healthcare costs, it's hard to estimate this accurately.\n\nPerhaps I can assume that the cost of healthcare per sick day is certain amount. But again, without data, it's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for general statistics or research that shows the relationship between exercise and healthcare costs.\n\nI recall that studies have shown that regular exercise can lead to lower healthcare costs due to prevention of diseases and overall better health.\n\nBut, without specific numbers, it's difficult to quantify this for the company.\n\nPerhaps, for the sake of this calculation, I can assume that the reduction in healthcare costs is equivalent to the productivity savings, i.e., another $600,000 per year.\n\nSo, total potential savings would be:\n\nProductivity savings: $600,000\n\nHealthcare cost savings: $600,000\n\nTotal savings: $1,200,000 per year.\n\nNow, comparing this to the cost of gym memberships, which is $2,500,000 per year.\n\nSo, $2,500,000 cost vs. $1,200,000 in savings.\n\nThis means the company would still be out of pocket by $1,300,000 per year.\n\nBut, this might be worthwhile if the company values employee wellness and considers the long-term benefits beyond just financial savings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other intangible benefits, such as improved employee morale and retention, which aren't captured in this calculation.\n\nHowever, based purely on the numbers provided and my assumptions, it seems that the cost outweighs the savings.\n\nBut, I should note that my assumptions may not be accurate, and the actual impact could be different.\n\nFor example, if the current average sick days are higher than 10 per employee, or if the reduction in sick days is more than 5%, then the savings could be greater.\n\nSimilarly, if healthcare costs are significantly reduced due to employee exercise, then that would add more value.\n\nPerhaps the company should conduct a feasibility study to get actual data on current sick days and healthcare costs before making a decision.\n\nAlternatively, they could consider offering the gym memberships as an optional benefit and monitor the impact on sick days and healthcare costs over time.\n\nIn conclusion, based on my calculations and assumptions, the cost of providing gym memberships appears to exceed the potential savings from reduced sick days and healthcare costs. However, the true value may depend on various factors that aren't accounted for in this analysis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Total annual cost of gym memberships: } \\$2,500,000} \\]"
