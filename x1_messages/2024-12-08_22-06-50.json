She took off from Harbour Grace, Newfoundland, Canada, on May 20, 1932, and landed in Culmore, near Derry, Northern Ireland, on May 21, 1932. This historic flight made her the first woman to achieve this feat, and it was also the fifth anniversary of Charles Lindbergh's solo transatlantic flight. Amelia Earhart's accomplishment was a significant milestone in aviation history and helped to break down barriers for women in the field."
