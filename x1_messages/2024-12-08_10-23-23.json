Each step of your plan should be accompanied by an evidence variable that captures the output of the tool used in that step.\n\nHere are the available tools:\n1. WebSearch[input]: This tool allows you to perform a web search with any given input string. The results can be a list of websites or articles that may contain the answer to your query.\n2. TextExtractor[input]: This tool extracts plain text from one or more URLs provided as newline-separated strings in the input.\n3. LinkCollector[input]: This tool collects all the links present in a given piece of text and outputs them as newline-separated strings.\n4. QAModel[input]: This is a question-answering model that can provide answers based on a given context. The input must be a question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., \"What is the capital of France, given :evidence1:?\"\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nPlan: [first action]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call with input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer]\n\nQuestion: What is the most populated city in Canada and what is its main industry?"
