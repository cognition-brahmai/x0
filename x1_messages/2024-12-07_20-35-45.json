Here's a Python function that takes a sentence as input and returns the longest word in that sentence:\n\n```python\ndef longest_word(sentence):\n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Initialize variables to store the longest word and its length\n    longest = \"\"\n    max_length = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each word\n    for word in words:\n        # Remove punctuation from the word\n        word = word.strip('.,!?;:')\n        \n        # Update the longest word if the current word is longer\n        if len(word) > max_length:\n            longest = word\n            max_length = len(word)\n    \n    return longest\n\n# Example usage:\nsentence = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\nprint(longest_word(sentence))  # Output: \"jumps\"\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the sentence into words, stripping punctuation from each word, and then finding the word with the maximum length."
