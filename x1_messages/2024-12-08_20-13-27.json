        "content": "So, I've got this problem here about a company launching a new product line and needing to figure out their production capacity. Let's see what we've got.\n\nFirst, the initial market research estimates a demand of 10,000 units per month. But, this demand is expected to increase by 15% annually. So, that means every year, the monthly demand will go up by 15%.\n\nNow, the production facility can make 12,000 units per month at full capacity, but it costs $1 million to set it up. We need to calculate the break-even point for this investment, considering a profit margin of $50 per unit. Also, we need to estimate when the company should think about expanding production capacity based on how demand is growing.\n\nAlright, let's start with the break-even point. The break-even point is when the total revenue equals the total cost. In this case, the total cost includes the initial investment and any ongoing costs, but since we're not given any variable costs per unit, maybe we can assume that the profit margin of $50 per unit is after covering the variable costs.\n\nSo, if the profit per unit is $50, and the initial investment is $1 million, then the break-even point in units would be the investment divided by the profit per unit.\n\nBreak-even point (units) = $1,000,000 / $50 = 20,000 units.\n\nThat means the company needs to sell 20,000 units in total to break even.\n\nBut wait, demand is monthly, and production capacity is monthly, so maybe we should think in terms of months.\n\nLet's see: initial monthly demand is 10,000 units. If they produce 12,000 units per month, they can meet the initial demand and have some excess capacity.\n\nBut demand grows annually by 15%. So, each year, the monthly demand increases by 15%.\n\nLet me see: in year 1, monthly demand is 10,000 units.\n\nAt the end of year 1, demand increases by 15%, so in year 2, monthly demand is 10,000 * 1.15 = 11,500 units per month.\n\nSimilarly, at the end of year 2, demand increases by another 15%, so in year 3, monthly demand is 11,500 * 1.15 \u2248 13,225 units per month.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, the production capacity is 12,000 units per month.\n\nSo, in year 1, demand is 10,000 < 12,000, so capacity is sufficient.\n\nIn year 2, demand is 11,500 < 12,000, still within capacity.\n\nIn year 3, demand is 13,225 > 12,000, so capacity is exceeded.\n\nTherefore, the company should consider expanding production capacity by the start of year 3.\n\nBut let's verify this with more precise calculations.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cumulative profit over time to see when the initial investment is recovered.\n\nAssuming the company starts production in month 1, with a production capacity of 12,000 units per month, and demand starts at 10,000 units per month.\n\nProfit per unit is $50.\n\nSo, in year 1:\n\nMonthly demand: 10,000 units\n\nMonthly production: 12,000 units\n\nMonthly sales: 10,000 units (limited by demand)\n\nMonthly profit: 10,000 * $50 = $500,000\n\nTotal profit for year 1: 12 * $500,000 = $6,000,000\n\nSimilarly, in year 2:\n\nMonthly demand: 10,000 * 1.15 = 11,500 units\n\nMonthly production: 12,000 units\n\nMonthly sales: 11,500 units\n\nMonthly profit: 11,500 * $50 = $575,000\n\nTotal profit for year 2: 12 * $575,000 = $6,900,000\n\nCumulative profit after year 2: $6,000,000 + $6,900,000 = $12,900,000\n\nSince the investment is $1,000,000, the break-even point is long passed by the end of year 1, since even in the first month, the profit is $500,000, so break-even is in the second month.\n\nWait, that seems off. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAh, perhaps there are ongoing costs or the profit margin isn't purely profit but contribution margin towards covering fixed costs.\n\nLet me reconsider.\n\nSuppose the profit margin of $50 per unit is the amount that contributes to covering the initial investment after variable costs are covered.\n\nIn that case, the break-even point in units is still 20,000 units.\n\nGiven that monthly demand is 10,000 units, it would take 2 months to break even.\n\nBut that seems too simplistic, as demand is growing over time.\n\nMaybe I should calculate the cumulative profit each month, considering the increasing demand.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, let's establish the demand growth.\n\nDemand starts at 10,000 units per month and increases by 15% annually.\n\nSo, at the end of each year, demand increases by 15%.\n\nTherefore:\n\nMonth 1-12: Demand = 10,000 units/month\n\nMonth 13-24: Demand = 10,000 * 1.15 = 11,500 units/month\n\nMonth 25-36: Demand = 11,500 * 1.15 \u2248 13,225 units/month\n\nAnd so on.\n\nProduction capacity is 12,000 units/month.\n\nSo, in months 1-12: Sales = 10,000 units/month (demand limited)\n\nMonths 13-24: Sales = 11,500 units/month (still below capacity)\n\nMonths 25-36: Sales = 12,000 units/month (capacity limited)\n\nBeyond month 36: Sales = 12,000 units/month (until capacity is expanded)\n\nNow, profit per unit is $50.\n\nSo, cumulative profit:\n\nMonth 1-12: 10,000 units/month * $50 = $500,000/month\n\nTotal for year 1: 12 * $500,000 = $6,000,000\n\nMonth 13-24: 11,500 units/month * $50 = $575,000/month\n\nTotal for year 2: 12 * $575,000 = $6,900,000\n\nCumulative after 2 years: $6,000,000 + $6,900,000 = $12,900,000\n\nSince the investment is $1,000,000, the break-even point is reached in the first month, as $500,000 profit covers a part of the investment, and the second month covers the remaining.\n\nBut that can't be right because $500,000 per month exceeds $1,000,000 in two months.\n\nWait, maybe I need to model it more carefully.\n\nLet's consider the cash flows:\n\nInitial investment: -$1,000,000 (at month 0)\n\nMonthly profits:\n\nMonth 1: $500,000\n\nMonth 2: $500,000\n\nCumulative after month 2: -$1,000,000 + $500,000 + $500,000 = $0\n\nSo, break-even is at the end of month 2.\n\nBut this seems too straightforward, perhaps there are other costs involved that aren't considered here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $50 profit per unit is not accurate, or there are other factors.\n\nAnyway, based on the information provided, the break-even point is 2 months.\n\nNow, regarding when to expand production capacity.\n\nAs demand grows, the company will eventually reach its production capacity.\n\nFrom the earlier calculation:\n\nMonth 1-12: Demand = 10,000 < 12,000\n\nMonth 13-24: Demand = 11,500 < 12,000\n\nMonth 25-36: Demand = 13,225 > 12,000\n\nSo, by month 25, demand exceeds capacity.\n\nTherefore, the company should consider expanding production capacity before month 25 to meet the increasing demand.\n\nPerhaps they should start planning the expansion in month 24 or earlier to have the new capacity ready by month 25.\n\nAlternatively, they could consider increasing capacity earlier if they expect the demand growth to continue.\n\nAlso, they might want to build some buffer capacity to handle any sudden increases in demand or to have excess capacity for potential future growth.\n\nSo, depending on their strategy, they might decide to expand sooner or later.\n\nBut based on the given demand growth, the production capacity will be exceeded in month 25.\n\nTherefore, the company should consider expanding production capacity by month 25.\n\nIn terms of years, that's approximately 2 years and 1 month after starting production.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Break-even point: 2 months\n\n- Time to expand production capacity: by the start of month 25, or approximately 2 years and 1 month after starting production.\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ months for break-even, expand capacity by month 25}} \\]"
