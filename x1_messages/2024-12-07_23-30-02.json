        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you write a multithreaded program in C that computes the factorial of a number using threads. The main thread will read the number from the user and create a worker thread to compute the factorial. Once the computation is done, the worker thread will print the result and terminate.\n\nFirst, we need to include the necessary headers. For threads in C, we'll use the POSIX threads library, so we need to include `pthread.h`. We'll also include `stdio.h` for input and output functions and `stdlib.h` for any standard library functions we might need.\n\nNext, we need to define a function that will be executed by the worker thread. This function will take an argument, which will be the number for which we need to compute the factorial. Since thread functions in POSIX threads must take a `void*` argument and return `void*`, we'll cast the argument to the appropriate type inside the function.\n\nIn the main function, we'll read the number from the user. We need to make sure that the number is non-negative since factorial is not defined for negative numbers. We'll create a thread attribute object to set the thread's detach state, so it cleans up automatically when it terminates.\n\nWe'll pass the number to the worker thread by placing it in a suitable data structure, perhaps a simple integer pointer, and pass that pointer to the thread function.\n\nIn the worker thread function, we'll compute the factorial of the given number and then print the result. After that, the thread can terminate.\n\nLet's think about how to compute the factorial. Since factorials can get very large very quickly, we need to choose an appropriate data type to store the result. For simplicity, we'll use `unsigned long long`, which can handle factorials up to 20! without overflow.\n\nWe should also consider that computing factorial for large numbers might take some time, but since this is just a educational example, we'll keep it simple.\n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\n1. Include necessary headers.\n\n2. Define the thread function that computes the factorial and prints the result.\n\n3. In the main function:\n\na. Read the number from the user.\n\nb. Check if the number is non-negative.\n\nc. Create a thread attribute object and set it to detach state.\n\nd. Create the worker thread with the thread function and the number as an argument.\n\ne. Wait for the worker thread to finish (although with detach state, it should clean up automatically).\n\n4. In the worker thread function:\n\na. Cast the argument to the appropriate type.\n\nb. Compute the factorial.\n\nc. Print the result.\n\nd. Thread terminates.\n\nLet me consider error checking. We should check if the thread creation was successful and handle any errors appropriately.\n\nAlso, since we're dealing with user input, we need to make sure that the input is a valid integer.\n\nLet me think about how to pass the argument to the thread function. Since the thread function must take a `void*` argument, we'll pass the address of the integer containing the number, and cast it back to an integer pointer in the thread function.\n\nWait, actually, since we need to pass just a single integer, we can allocate memory for an integer, set its value, and pass the pointer to this integer to the thread function. In the thread function, we'll cast the `void*` back to `int*` and access the value.\n\nBut to make it simpler, since the factorial function only needs the number and doesn't need to modify it, we can pass the integer by value using a cast.\n\nLet me try to write a draft of the code in my mind.\n\nFirst, include the headers:\n\n```c\n\n#include <pthread.h>\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n```\n\nDefine the thread function:\n\n```c\n\nvoid* compute_factorial(void* arg) {\n\n    int num = *(int*)arg;\n\n    unsigned long long factorial = 1;\n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= num; i++) {\n\n        factorial *= i;\n\n    }\n\n    printf(\"Factorial of %d is %llu\\n\", num, factorial);\n\n    // No need to free arg here since we're using detach state\n\n    return NULL;\n\n}\n\n```\n\nIn the main function:\n\n```c\n\nint main() {\n\n    int num;\n\n    printf(\"Enter a non-negative integer: \");\n\n    if (scanf(\"%d\", &num) != 1) {\n\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Invalid input.\\n\");\n\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n\n    }\n\n    if (num < 0) {\n\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\\n\");\n\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n\n    }\n\n    pthread_t thread;\n\n    pthread_attr_t attr;\n\n    pthread_attr_init(&attr);\n\n    pthread_attr_setdetachstate(&attr, PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED);\n\n    if (pthread_create(&thread, &attr, compute_factorial, &num) != 0) {\n\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Failed to create thread.\\n\");\n\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n\n    }\n\n    // No need to join since it's detached\n\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n\n}\n\n```\n\nWait a minute, in this code, I'm passing the address of the local variable `num` to the thread function. However, in a detached thread, there's a risk that the main thread might exit before the worker thread finishes if we're not careful. But since we're using a detached thread and the thread should clean up after itself, it should be fine.\n\nBut to be safe, maybe we should allocate memory for the number and pass that memory to the thread function, so that even if the main thread exits before the worker thread, the memory remains valid.\n\nLet's adjust the code accordingly.\n\nModify the main function:\n\n```c\n\nint main() {\n\n    int num;\n\n    printf(\"Enter a non-negative integer: \");\n\n    if (scanf(\"%d\", &num) != 1) {\n\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Invalid input.\\n\");\n\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n\n    }\n\n    if (num < 0) {\n\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\\n\");\n\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n\n    }\n\n    int* num_ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));\n\n    if (num_ptr == NULL) {\n\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Memory allocation failed.\\n\");\n\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n\n    }\n\n    *num_ptr = num;\n\n    pthread_t thread;\n\n    pthread_attr_t attr;\n\n    pthread_attr_init(&attr);\n\n    pthread_attr_setdetachstate(&attr, PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED);\n\n    if (pthread_create(&thread, &attr, compute_factorial, num_ptr) != 0) {\n\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Failed to create thread.\\n\");\n\n        free(num_ptr);\n\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n\n    }\n\n    // No need to join since it's detached\n\n    // The thread will handle freeing the memory\n\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd modify the thread function to free the allocated memory:\n\n```c\n\nvoid* compute_factorial(void* arg) {\n\n    int* num_ptr = (int*)arg;\n\n    int num = *num_ptr;\n\n    unsigned long long factorial = 1;\n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= num; i++) {\n\n        factorial *= i;\n\n    }\n\n    printf(\"Factorial of %d is %llu\\n\", num, factorial);\n\n    free(num_ptr);\n\n    return NULL;\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis way, the memory allocated for `num` is freed by the worker thread after it's done with the computation.\n\nLet me double-check for any potential issues.\n\n1. Memory Allocation: We allocate memory for `num` to ensure it persists beyond the main function's scope.\n\n2. Thread Detachment: By setting the detach state, the thread cleans up automatically when it terminates.\n\n3. Error Handling: We check for successful thread creation and memory allocation.\n\n4. Data Type for Factorial: Using `unsigned long long` should suffice for reasonably small integers.\n\n5. User Input Validation: We check if the input is a valid integer and non-negative.\n\nI think this covers the basics. If you want to make it more robust, you could add more error checking or handle larger factorials using libraries like GMP, but for educational purposes, this should be sufficient.\n\nLet me write the complete code now.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a multithreaded program in C that computes the factorial of a number provided by the user. The main thread will read the number from the user and create a worker thread to compute the factorial. Once the computation is complete, the worker thread will print the result and terminate.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Include Necessary Headers**:\n   - `pthread.h` for thread management.\n   - `stdio.h` for input and output functions.\n   - `stdlib.h` for standard library functions and memory management.\n\n2. **Define the Thread Function**:\n   - This function will compute the factorial of the given number and print the result.\n   - It will also free the allocated memory for the number.\n\n3. **Main Function**:\n   - Read the number from the user and validate the input.\n   - Allocate memory for the number to ensure it persists beyond the main function's scope.\n   - Set thread attributes to detach the worker thread for automatic cleanup.\n   - Create the worker thread to compute the factorial.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```c\n#include <pthread.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n// Thread function to compute factorial\nvoid* compute_factorial(void* arg) {\n    int* num_ptr = (int*)arg;\n    int num = *num_ptr;\n    unsigned long long factorial = 1;\n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= num; i++) {\n        factorial *= i;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"Factorial of %d is %llu\\n\", num, factorial);\n    free(num_ptr);\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int num;\n    printf(\"Enter a non-negative integer: \");\n    if (scanf(\"%d\", &num) != 1) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Invalid input.\\n\");\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    if (num < 0) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\\n\");\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    int* num_ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));\n    if (num_ptr == NULL) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Memory allocation failed.\\n\");\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    }\n    *num_ptr = num;\n\n    pthread_t thread;\n    pthread_attr_t attr;\n    pthread_attr_init(&attr);\n    pthread_attr_setdetachstate(&attr, PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED);\n\n    if (pthread_create(&thread, &attr, compute_factorial, num_ptr) != 0) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Failed to create thread.\\n\");\n        free(num_ptr);\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    // No need to join since it's detached\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Thread Function**:\n  - `compute_factorial` takes a void pointer, casts it to an integer pointer, computes the factorial, prints the result, and frees the allocated memory.\n\n- **Main Function**:\n  - Reads an integer from the user.\n  - Allocates memory for the integer to ensure it persists beyond the main function's scope.\n  - Sets the thread detachment state for automatic cleanup.\n  - Creates a worker thread to compute the factorial using the provided number.\n  - The main thread exits without waiting for the worker thread since the thread is detached.\n\nThis approach ensures that the program handles the computation in a separate thread, manages memory properly, and validates user input appropriately."
