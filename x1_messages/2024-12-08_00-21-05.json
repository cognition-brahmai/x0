        "content": "Alright, I'm going to create a simple C# console application that acts as a basic calculator. It should be able to handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the inputs provided via command line arguments. I need to make sure that it handles errors gracefully, especially cases where the inputs are invalid or if there's a division by zero.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a new C# console project. I can do this using Visual Studio or the .NET CLI. For simplicity, I'll assume that the user has the .NET SDK installed.\n\nLet me start by creating a new console project. Open the terminal and run:\n\n```bash\ndotnet new console -n BasicCalculator\ncd BasicCalculator\n```\n\nThis will create a new console project named \"BasicCalculator\" and navigate into its directory.\n\nNow, I need to open the `Program.cs` file and start editing it to include the calculator logic.\n\nI'll begin by looking at the default `Main` method that's generated:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nnamespace BasicCalculator\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI need to modify this to accept command line arguments for two numbers and an operator. The operator will be one of the following: +, -, *, or /.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the correct number of arguments are provided. The program should expect exactly three arguments: two numbers and one operator.\n\nSo, in the `Main` method, I'll check the length of the `args` array:\n\n```csharp\nif (args.Length != 3)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Usage: BasicCalculator.exe number1 operator number2\");\n    return;\n}\n```\n\nNext, I need to parse the first and third arguments as numbers. Since the numbers could be either integers or decimals, I'll try to parse them as doubles.\n\nI'll use `double.TryParse` for this, as it's safer than `double.Parse` because it doesn't throw an exception if the parsing fails.\n\nSo, I'll declare two double variables for the numbers and a string for the operator:\n\n```csharp\ndouble num1, num2;\nstring operatorSymbol = args[1];\n```\n\nNow, try parsing the first argument:\n\n```csharp\nif (!double.TryParse(args[0], out num1))\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Error: The first argument is not a valid number.\");\n    return;\n}\n```\n\nSimilarly, parse the second argument:\n\n```csharp\nif (!double.TryParse(args[2], out num2))\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Error: The third argument is not a valid number.\");\n    return;\n}\n```\n\nNow, based on the operator, I'll perform the corresponding operation.\n\nI'll use a `switch` statement for this:\n\n```csharp\nswitch (operatorSymbol)\n{\n    case \"+\":\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Result: {num1 + num2}\");\n        break;\n    case \"-\":\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Result: {num1 - num2}\");\n        break;\n    case \"*\":\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Result: {num1 * num2}\");\n        break;\n    case \"/\":\n        if (num2 == 0)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Error: Division by zero.\");\n            return;\n        }\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Result: {num1 / num2}\");\n        break;\n    default:\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Error: Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.\");\n        break;\n}\n```\n\nI need to make sure that division by zero is handled, which is why I've added a check when the operator is \"/\" and num2 is zero.\n\nLet me summarize the `Main` method so far:\n\n```csharp\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\n    if (args.Length != 3)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Usage: BasicCalculator.exe number1 operator number2\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    double num1, num2;\n    string operatorSymbol = args[1];\n\n    if (!double.TryParse(args[0], out num1))\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Error: The first argument is not a valid number.\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (!double.TryParse(args[2], out num2))\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Error: The third argument is not a valid number.\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    switch (operatorSymbol)\n    {\n        case \"+\":\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Result: {num1 + num2}\");\n            break;\n        case \"-\":\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Result: {num1 - num2}\");\n            break;\n        case \"*\":\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Result: {num1 * num2}\");\n            break;\n        case \"/\":\n            if (num2 == 0)\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Error: Division by zero.\");\n                return;\n            }\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Result: {num1 / num2}\");\n            break;\n        default:\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Error: Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.\");\n            break;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI think this covers the basic functionality and error handling required.\n\nLet me test this in my mind with some examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nCommand: `BasicCalculator.exe 5 + 3`\n\nExpected Output: `Result: 8`\n\nExample 2:\n\nCommand: `BasicCalculator.exe 10 / 2`\n\nExpected Output: `Result: 5`\n\nExample 3:\n\nCommand: `BasicCalculator.exe 8 * 4`\n\nExpected Output: `Result: 32`\n\nExample 4:\n\nCommand: `BasicCalculator.exe 15 - 7`\n\nExpected Output: `Result: 8`\n\nExample 5:\n\nCommand: `BasicCalculator.exe a + b`\n\nExpected Output: `Error: The first argument is not a valid number.`\n\nExample 6:\n\nCommand: `BasicCalculator.exe 10 / 0`\n\nExpected Output: `Error: Division by zero.`\n\nExample 7:\n\nCommand: `BasicCalculator.exe 5 % 3`\n\nExpected Output: `Error: Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.`\n\nExample 8:\n\nCommand: `BasicCalculator.exe 1 2 3`\n\nExpected Output: `Error: Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.`\n\nExample 9:\n\nCommand: `BasicCalculator.exe 5 +`\n\nExpected Output: `Usage: BasicCalculator.exe number1 operator number2`\n\nExample 10:\n\nCommand: `BasicCalculator.exe`\n\nExpected Output: `Usage: BasicCalculator.exe number1 operator number2`\n\nSeems like it should handle these cases appropriately.\n\nI might consider adding some formatting to the output, like always displaying the result with a certain number of decimal places, but for a basic calculator, the current implementation should suffice.\n\nAlso, I should ensure that the program doesn't crash for any input by using try-catch blocks, but since I'm using `TryParse`, it should handle most invalid inputs without crashing.\n\nOne thing I might add is handling negative numbers and decimal numbers to make sure the parser can cope with them, but `double.TryParse` should handle those just fine.\n\nAnother consideration is whether to support more operators, but since the requirement is for a basic calculator with only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, I'll stick with those.\n\nI should also think about internationalization, like decimal separators. In some locales, the decimal separator is a comma (,) instead of a period (.), but `double.TryParse` uses the current culture's settings by default. If I want to support only period as the decimal separator, I can specify the number style:\n\n```csharp\nif (!double.TryParse(args[0], System.Globalization.NumberStyles.Float, System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, out num1))\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Error: The first argument is not a valid number.\");\n    return;\n}\n\nif (!double.TryParse(args[2], System.Globalization.NumberStyles.Float, System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, out num2))\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Error: The third argument is not a valid number.\");\n    return;\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the parser expects a period as the decimal separator, which is common in English-speaking countries.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to make it more flexible and accept the locale's decimal separator, I can omit the culture info, and `TryParse` will use the current culture's settings.\n\nFor now, I'll keep it simple and assume that the decimal separator is a period.\n\nLet me think about edge cases:\n\n- Very large numbers that exceed double's maximum value.\n\n- Very small numbers close to zero.\n\n- Negative numbers.\n\n- Division where the result is a decimal.\n\nI should also consider if the user provides more or fewer arguments than expected.\n\nI've already handled the case where the number of arguments is not three by displaying a usage message.\n\nAnother possible improvement is to make the program more user-friendly by providing a help option, like `--help` or `-h`, but that might be beyond the scope of a basic calculator.\n\nFor now, I'll keep it minimal.\n\nLet me think about how to compile and run this program.\n\nIn Visual Studio, I can just build and run the project.\n\nUsing the .NET CLI, I can run:\n\n```bash\ndotnet run -- 5 + 3\n```\n\nThe double dash `--` separates the dotnet CLI options from the application arguments.\n\nAlternatively, after publishing the application, I can run it directly from the command line like any other executable.\n\nI should also consider if I need to handle non-numeric inputs that could be mistaken for valid numbers, but `double.TryParse` should catch most issues.\n\nFor instance, if the user inputs \"five\" instead of \"5\", `TryParse` will fail and display the error message.\n\nI think this covers the requirements.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll write down the final `Program.cs` code:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nnamespace BasicCalculator\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            if (args.Length != 3)\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Usage: BasicCalculator.exe number1 operator number2\");\n                return;\n            }\n\n            double num1, num2;\n            string operatorSymbol = args[1];\n\n            if (!double.TryParse(args[0], out num1))\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Error: The first argument is not a valid number.\");\n                return;\n            }\n\n            if (!double.TryParse(args[2], out num2))\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Error: The third argument is not a valid number.\");\n                return;\n            }\n\n            switch (operatorSymbol)\n            {\n                case \"+\":\n                    Console.WriteLine($\"Result: {num1 + num2}\");\n                    break;\n                case \"-\":\n                    Console.WriteLine($\"Result: {num1 - num2}\");\n                    break;\n                case \"*\":\n                    Console.WriteLine($\"Result: {num1 * num2}\");\n                    break;\n                case \"/\":\n                    if (num2 == 0)\n                    {\n                        Console.WriteLine(\"Error: Division by zero.\");\n                        return;\n                    }\n                    Console.WriteLine($\"Result: {num1 / num2}\");\n                    break;\n                default:\n                    Console.WriteLine(\"Error: Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.\");\n                    break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI believe this should work as expected.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a basic calculator console application in C#, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set Up the Project:**\n   - Open your terminal or command prompt.\n   - Create a new C# console project using the .NET CLI:\n     ```bash\n     dotnet new console -n BasicCalculator\n     cd BasicCalculator\n     ```\n\n2. **Edit the Program.cs File:**\n   - Open the `Program.cs` file in your preferred text editor or IDE.\n   - Replace the existing code with the following:\n\n     ```csharp\n     using System;\n\n     namespace BasicCalculator\n     {\n         class Program\n         {\n             static void Main(string[] args)\n             {\n                 if (args.Length != 3)\n                 {\n                     Console.WriteLine(\"Usage: BasicCalculator.exe number1 operator number2\");\n                     return;\n                 }\n\n                 double num1, num2;\n                 string operatorSymbol = args[1];\n\n                 if (!double.TryParse(args[0], out num1))\n                 {\n                     Console.WriteLine(\"Error: The first argument is not a valid number.\");\n                     return;\n                 }\n\n                 if (!double.TryParse(args[2], out num2))\n                 {\n                     Console.WriteLine(\"Error: The third argument is not a valid number.\");\n                     return;\n                 }\n\n                 switch (operatorSymbol)\n                 {\n                     case \"+\":\n                         Console.WriteLine($\"Result: {num1 + num2}\");\n                         break;\n                     case \"-\":\n                         Console.WriteLine($\"Result: {num1 - num2}\");\n                         break;\n                     case \"*\":\n                         Console.WriteLine($\"Result: {num1 * num2}\");\n                         break;\n                     case \"/\":\n                         if (num2 == 0)\n                         {\n                             Console.WriteLine(\"Error: Division by zero.\");\n                             return;\n                         }\n                         Console.WriteLine($\"Result: {num1 / num2}\");\n                         break;\n                     default:\n                         Console.WriteLine(\"Error: Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.\");\n                         break;\n                 }\n             }\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Run the Application:**\n   - Use the .NET CLI to run the application with command line arguments:\n     ```bash\n     dotnet run -- 5 + 3\n     ```\n   - Replace `5`, `+`, and `3` with your desired numbers and operator.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Argument Check:** The program first checks if exactly three arguments are provided. If not, it displays usage instructions.\n- **Input Parsing:** It attempts to parse the first and third arguments as double-precision floating point numbers. If parsing fails, it outputs an error message.\n- **Operator Handling:** It uses a switch statement to perform the operation specified by the operator:\n  - `+` for addition\n  - `-` for subtraction\n  - `*` for multiplication\n  - `/` for division, with a check to prevent division by zero\n- **Error Handling:** The program handles errors such as invalid numbers and invalid operators, providing informative messages for each case.\n\nThis simple calculator provides a solid foundation and can be extended with additional features as needed.\n"
