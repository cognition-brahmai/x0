Each student who passed gets a certificate, and we need to figure out how many certificates need to be printed.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many students passed the test. Since 60% of the 30 students passed, I can calculate that by multiplying 30 by 60%.\n\nBut wait, percentages can be a bit tricky sometimes. I remember that 60% is the same as 60 per 100, or 0.6 in decimal form. So, to find 60% of 30, I can multiply 30 by 0.6.\n\nLet me do that: 30 times 0.6. That should be 18.\n\nSo, 18 students passed the test.\n\nNow, since each passing student gets one certificate, the number of certificates needed should be equal to the number of students who passed, which is 18.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as finding what 60% of 30 is. I know that 50% of 30 would be 15, because half of 30 is 15. Then, 10% of 30 is 3, because 10% is the same as dividing by 10. So, 60% would be 50% plus 10%, which is 15 plus 3, making 18 again.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that 18 is the correct number.\n\nTherefore, 18 certificates need to be printed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
