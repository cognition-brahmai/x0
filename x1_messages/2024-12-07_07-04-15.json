        "content": "So I've got this problem here. In the game, you earn 5 points for every correct answer and lose 2 points for every wrong answer. I answered 20 questions correctly and 10 questions incorrectly, and I need to find out what my final score is. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the points I earned from the correct answers. Since I get 5 points for each correct answer and I answered 20 correctly, I can multiply 5 points by 20. That should give me the total points from correct answers.\n\nSo, 5 points \u00d7 20 = 100 points.\n\nNext, I need to account for the points I lost from incorrect answers. I lose 2 points for each incorrect answer, and I got 10 wrong. So, I'll multiply -2 points by 10.\n\n-2 points \u00d7 10 = -20 points.\n\nNow, to find the final score, I need to add the points from correct answers and subtract the points lost from incorrect answers. Basically, it's total points = points from correct answers + points lost from incorrect answers.\n\nSo, total points = 100 + (-20) = 80 points.\n\nWait a minute, adding a negative number is the same as subtracting it, right? So, 100 + (-20) is the same as 100 - 20, which indeed equals 80.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can think about it differently. Maybe I can calculate the total points another way to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the net points per question, but since the points for correct and incorrect answers are different, it's probably more straightforward to calculate them separately as I did.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as total points = (correct answers \u00d7 points per correct) + (incorrect answers \u00d7 points per incorrect).\n\nWhich is what I did: (20 \u00d7 5) + (10 \u00d7 (-2)) = 100 + (-20) = 80.\n\nI think that's correct. Maybe I can try plugging in smaller numbers to see if the logic holds.\n\nSuppose I answered 2 questions correctly and 1 incorrectly.\n\nPoints: (2 \u00d7 5) + (1 \u00d7 (-2)) = 10 - 2 = 8.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nAnother check: 1 correct and 0 incorrect.\n\nPoints: (1 \u00d7 5) + (0 \u00d7 (-2)) = 5 + 0 = 5.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, scaling up to the original numbers: 20 correct and 10 incorrect.\n\nTotal points: (20 \u00d7 5) + (10 \u00d7 (-2)) = 100 - 20 = 80.\n\nI think that's the final score.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
