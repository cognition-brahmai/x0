        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about socks in a drawer. Let me see if I can figure this out. There are 12 socks in total: 6 are black, 4 are blue, and 2 are red. The question is, if I pick one sock without looking, what's the probability that it's black?\n\nOkay, probability. I remember that probability is basically the chances of something happening. It's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcome is picking a black sock, and the total outcomes are all the socks I could possibly pick.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the total number of socks. It says there are 12 socks: 6 black, 4 blue, and 2 red. So, 6 + 4 + 2 equals 12. That checks out.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of black socks, which is 6.\n\nSo, the probability P of picking a black sock should be P = number of black socks / total number of socks = 6 / 12.\n\nHmm, 6 divided by 12 is 0.5. So, is the probability 0.5?\n\nWait, probabilities are often expressed as fractions or percentages as well. 6/12 is the same as 1/2, and that's 50%.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/2 or 50%.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other factor to consider here? Like, are the socks arranged in a certain way, or is there something about the way I'm picking them?\n\nThe problem says I'm reaching into the drawer without looking and pulling out one sock. So, it's a random pick. That means each sock has an equal chance of being picked, right?\n\nYes, so in that case, my initial approach should be correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can think about it another way. The probability of picking a black sock is the number of black socks divided by the total number of socks. That's straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of not picking a black sock and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of picking a black sock.\n\nSo, the number of non-black socks is 4 blue + 2 red = 6.\n\nSo, probability of not picking black is 6/12 = 0.5.\n\nTherefore, probability of picking black is 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nGood, consistency here.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of percentages. 6 out of 12 socks are black. So, 6/12 * 100% = 50%.\n\nSame result.\n\nOr, as a fraction, 6/12 simplifies to 1/2.\n\nSo, all these different ways of looking at it lead me back to the same answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this.\n\nJust to double-check, are there any tricks or common mistakes I should watch out for in probability problems?\n\nWell, sometimes people get confused with dependent and independent events. But in this case, since I'm only picking one sock, it's a single event. So, no need to worry about dependencies.\n\nAlso, make sure that the events are mutually exclusive. Here, the colors are distinct, so a sock can't be both black and blue, for example.\n\nYes, that seems to hold.\n\nAnother thing is to ensure that the total probability sums up to 1. So, probability of black + blue + red should be 1.\n\nLet's check that.\n\nProbability of black: 6/12 = 1/2.\n\nProbability of blue: 4/12 = 1/3.\n\nProbability of red: 2/12 = 1/6.\n\nNow, 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 should equal 1.\n\nLet's see: 1/2 is 3/6, 1/3 is 2/6, and 1/6 is 1/6. So, 3/6 + 2/6 + 1/6 = 6/6 = 1.\n\nPerfect, that checks out.\n\nSo, no issues there.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The probability of picking a black sock is indeed 1/2 or 50%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
