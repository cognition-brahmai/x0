        "content": "You're referring to Madonna's self-titled debut album, released in 1983, but I think there might be a slight confusion in the details. The album that is often credited with making Madonna a household name and was released in 1984 is actually her second studio album, \"Like a Virgin.\" However, the self-titled debut album \"Madonna\" was released in 1983.\n\nBut to address your question directly, it seems like you're thinking of an album released in 1984 that was associated with Madonna and had a significant impact on MTV. \"Like a Virgin\" was indeed released in November 1984 and featured the hit single \"Material Girl,\" among others. This album played a crucial role in establishing Madonna as a pop icon and was heavily promoted on MTV, with music videos for several of its tracks.\n\nThe music videos from \"Like a Virgin\" were groundbreaking and helped to define the visual aesthetic of MTV in its early days. Videos like \"Material Girl,\" \"Like a Virgin,\" and \"Angel\" were staples on the channel and contributed to the album's success.\n\nSo, while the self-titled album \"Madonna\" was her debut, it was \"Like a Virgin\" that was released in 1984 and had a profound impact on MTV, earning it the nickname \"The Album That Made MTV.\"\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about Madonna or her career?"
