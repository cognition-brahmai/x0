        "content": "So there are 240 students in total at this school. Out of these, 40% play basketball, and 30% play soccer. Additionally, 12% of the students play both sports. I need to find out how many students play either basketball or soccer.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how many students play basketball and how many play soccer separately.\n\nSo, for basketball:\n\n40% of 240 students = (40/100) * 240 = 96 students\n\nFor soccer:\n\n30% of 240 students = (30/100) * 240 = 72 students\n\nNow, 12% play both sports:\n\n12% of 240 students = (12/100) * 240 = 28.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a student, maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that percentages might need to be handled differently, but 12% of 240 is indeed 28.8, which suggests that perhaps the numbers are meant to be decimals or perhaps rounding is expected. Maybe it's 29 students, but to be precise, let's keep it as 28.8 for now.\n\nTo find the total number of students who play either basketball or soccer, I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle helps avoid double-counting those who play both sports.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nTotal playing either = (number playing basketball) + (number playing soccer) - (number playing both)\n\nPlugging in the numbers I have:\n\nTotal = 96 + 72 - 28.8 = 168 - 28.8 = 139.2\n\nAgain, I end up with a decimal, which doesn't make sense for counting students. Maybe there's an error in my approach.\n\nLet me double-check the percentages:\n\n40% of 240 is indeed 96.\n\n30% of 240 is indeed 72.\n\n12% of 240 is indeed 28.8.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects us to round 28.8 to 29 students.\n\nIf I assume that, then:\n\nTotal = 96 + 72 - 29 = 168 - 29 = 139 students\n\nAlternatively, maybe the percentages are meant to be exact numbers, but that would require adjusting the total number of students to fit whole numbers, which might not be the case here.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the percentages directly without calculating the exact numbers of students.\n\nSo, percentage playing basketball: 40%\n\nPercentage playing soccer: 30%\n\nPercentage playing both: 12%\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion for percentages:\n\nPercentage playing either = (40% + 30%) - 12% = 70% - 12% = 58%\n\nThen, 58% of 240 students = (58/100) * 240 = 139.2\n\nAgain, I get 139.2, which suggests that perhaps the problem expects an answer of 139 students, rounding down from 139.2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's acceptable to have a decimal in this context, but since we're dealing with whole students, it's probably best to round to the nearest whole number, which would be 139 students.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if the numbers add up correctly.\n\nIf 40% play basketball and 30% play soccer, and 12% play both, then the percentage playing only basketball is 40% - 12% = 28%, and only soccer is 30% - 12% = 18%. Then, the total percentage playing either is 28% + 18% + 12% = 58%, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, 58% of 240 students is 139.2, which rounds to 139 students.\n\nTherefore, the total number of students who play either basketball or soccer is 139.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{139} \\]"
