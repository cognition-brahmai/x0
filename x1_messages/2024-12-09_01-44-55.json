        "content": "Let's see here. So, there's a train traveling from Station A to Station B, and the total distance between them is 120 miles. It says the train travels at a constant speed, which is important because that means the speed doesn't change throughout the journey.\n\nNow, the question mentions that it takes the train 2 hours to travel half the distance. Half of 120 miles is 60 miles, so it takes 2 hours to cover 60 miles.\n\nI need to find out how long it will take to travel the entire 120 miles.\n\nFirst, maybe I should find out the speed of the train. Speed is usually calculated as distance divided by time. So, if the train covers 60 miles in 2 hours, its speed would be:\n\nSpeed = distance / time = 60 miles / 2 hours = 30 miles per hour.\n\nOkay, so the train is moving at 30 miles per hour.\n\nNow, to find out how long it takes to cover the entire 120 miles at this speed, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = distance / speed.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 120 miles / 30 miles per hour = 4 hours.\n\nSo, it should take 4 hours to travel the entire distance.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Let's see.\n\nIf it takes 2 hours to cover half the distance, then to cover the full distance, it should take twice as long, right? Because the speed is constant.\n\nSo, 2 hours multiplied by 2 is 4 hours. That matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of proportions. If 60 miles takes 2 hours, then 120 miles would take x hours.\n\nSo, setting up a proportion:\n\n60 miles / 2 hours = 120 miles / x hours.\n\nSolving for x:\n\n60/2 = 120/x\n\n30 = 120/x\n\nMultiply both sides by x:\n\n30x = 120\n\nDivide both sides by 30:\n\nx = 120 / 30 = 4 hours.\n\nAgain, I get 4 hours.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. The problem says the train travels at a constant speed, so there's no acceleration or deceleration. The distance is straightforward, and there's no mention of stops along the way.\n\nSo, based on the information given, it seems straightforward that it would take 4 hours to travel the entire 120 miles.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about it another way. Maybe using the concept of velocity.\n\nVelocity is speed in a specific direction. Since the train is moving from Station A to Station B, its velocity is constant in direction and magnitude.\n\nSo, using the formula for time:\n\nTime = distance / velocity.\n\nWe already have distance (120 miles) and velocity (30 miles per hour), so time is 120 / 30 = 4 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the definition of constant speed, it means that the train covers equal distances in equal intervals of time.\n\nSo, if it takes 2 hours to cover 60 miles, then to cover another 60 miles, it should take another 2 hours, totaling 4 hours.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same conclusion: it will take 4 hours to travel the entire distance.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. Unless there's some trick or additional information I'm missing, it seems clear that the answer is 4 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
