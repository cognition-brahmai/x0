        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 100 houses in this village, each numbered from 1 to 100. Every house has a dog living in it, except for those houses that are multiples of 5. So, houses like 5, 10, 15, up to 100 don't have dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many houses don't have dogs. Since the houses without dogs are the multiples of 5 between 1 and 100, I can calculate that by dividing 100 by 5.\n\n100 \u00f7 5 = 20\n\nSo, there are 20 houses without dogs.\n\nNow, since there are 100 houses in total, the number of houses that do have dogs would be:\n\n100 - 20 = 80\n\nSo, there are 80 houses with dogs.\n\nThe question says that each dog barks at every person who passes by its house. So, if someone walks past all the houses, each of these 80 dogs will bark at them.\n\nTherefore, the number of dogs that will bark is 80.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to interpret this? Let me double-check.\n\nWe have 100 houses, numbered 1 to 100.\n\nHouses that are multiples of 5 don't have dogs. So, houses 5, 10, 15, ..., 100 are without dogs.\n\nThat's every 5th house, which indeed amounts to 20 houses.\n\nSo, 100 - 20 = 80 houses have dogs.\n\nEach of these 80 houses has one dog, and each dog barks at the person passing by.\n\nTherefore, 80 dogs will bark.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
