        "content": "Alright, so we've got this scenario here about a supermarket planning to open a new store in a growing neighborhood. The store is going to be 2,500 square meters in size, and they've got different departments they want to allocate space to: produce, bakery, deli, and frozen foods. According to industry standards, they're planning to allocate 40% to produce, 20% to bakery, 15% to deli, and 25% to frozen foods. Our task is to calculate the floor area allocated to each department and explain it step by step.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a total floor area of 2,500 square meters, and it's being divided among four departments in specific percentages. So, for each department, I need to find out what part of the total area corresponds to its allocated percentage.\n\nLet's start with the produce department, which is getting 40% of the total area. To find out how many square meters that is, I need to calculate 40% of 2,500 square meters.\n\nI know that \"percent\" means \"per hundred,\" so 40% is the same as 40 per 100, or 40/100, which simplifies to 0.40 in decimal form.\n\nSo, to find 40% of 2,500, I can multiply 2,500 by 0.40.\n\nLet me do that:\n\n2,500 \u00d7 0.40 = 1,000 square meters.\n\nSo, the produce department gets 1,000 square meters.\n\nNext, the bakery department is allocated 20% of the total area. Again, \"percent\" means \"per hundred,\" so 20% is 20/100, which is 0.20 in decimal form.\n\nNow, I'll multiply the total area by 0.20 to find the bakery's allocation:\n\n2,500 \u00d7 0.20 = 500 square meters.\n\nSo, the bakery department gets 500 square meters.\n\nMoving on to the deli department, which is getting 15% of the total area. 15% is equivalent to 15/100, or 0.15 in decimal form.\n\nMultiplying the total area by 0.15:\n\n2,500 \u00d7 0.15 = 375 square meters.\n\nTherefore, the deli department gets 375 square meters.\n\nLastly, the frozen foods department is allocated 25% of the total area. 25% is the same as 25/100, which is 0.25 in decimal form.\n\nSo, multiplying the total area by 0.25:\n\n2,500 \u00d7 0.25 = 625 square meters.\n\nThus, the frozen foods department gets 625 square meters.\n\nJust to double-check that everything adds up correctly, I can add up the areas of all four departments and see if they total the original 2,500 square meters.\n\nproduce: 1,000 sq m\n\nbakery: 500 sq m\n\ndeli: 375 sq m\n\nfrozen foods: 625 sq m\n\nAdding those together:\n\n1,000 + 500 = 1,500\n\n1,500 + 375 = 1,875\n\n1,875 + 625 = 2,500 sq m\n\nPerfect, it all adds up.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Produce: 40% of 2,500 sq m = 1,000 sq m\n\n- Bakery: 20% of 2,500 sq m = 500 sq m\n\n- Deli: 15% of 2,500 sq m = 375 sq m\n\n- Frozen Foods: 25% of 2,500 sq m = 625 sq m\n\nAnd there you have it! That's how you calculate the floor area allocated to each department based on the given percentages.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Produce: } 1000 \\text{ sq m}, \\text{ Bakery: } 500 \\text{ sq m}, \\text{ Deli: } 375 \\text{ sq m}, \\text{ Frozen Foods: } 625 \\text{ sq m}} \\]"
