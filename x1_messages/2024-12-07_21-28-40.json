        "content": "So there are 50 people in a room, and I need to figure out the minimum number of people who could be wearing both glasses and hats. Let's see.\n\nFirst, 20% of them are wearing glasses. So, 20% of 50 is:\n\n0.20 * 50 = 10 people wearing glasses.\n\nNext, 30% are wearing hats. So, 30% of 50 is:\n\n0.30 * 50 = 15 people wearing hats.\n\nNow, I need to find the minimum number of people who are wearing both glasses and hats.\n\nI remember that for sets, there's something called the principle of inclusion-exclusion. It says that for two sets, the size of their union is the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of their intersection.\n\nIn formula terms:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nIn this context, A is the set of people wearing glasses, and B is the set of people wearing hats.\n\nSo, |A| = 10 and |B| = 15.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for |A \u2229 B|:\n\n|A \u2229 B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u222a B|\n\nNow, the union of A and B, |A \u222a B|, can be at most 50, since there are only 50 people in the room.\n\nBut I need to find the minimum number of people wearing both, so I need to maximize |A \u222a B|.\n\nBecause the more people are in the union, the fewer are in the intersection.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf |A \u222a B| is as large as possible, then |A \u2229 B| is as small as possible.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, to minimize |A \u2229 B|, I need to maximize |A \u222a B|.\n\nThe maximum |A \u222a B| can be is 50, since there are only 50 people.\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\n|A \u2229 B| = 10 + 15 - 50 = 25 - 50 = -25\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. You can't have a negative number of people.\n\nThat must mean something's wrong with my approach.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the union can't be larger than the total number of people.\n\nWait, in this case, |A| + |B| = 10 + 15 = 25, which is less than 50.\n\nSo, the maximum |A \u222a B| is 25, not 50.\n\nWait, no. If there are 50 people, and only 10 wear glasses and 15 wear hats, the union can be up to 50 if some people wear neither.\n\nBut actually, since |A| + |B| = 25, the union can't be larger than 25 because that's the total number of people wearing either glasses or hats or both.\n\nWait, no. If some people wear both, then the union would be less than 25.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion says:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nWe know |A| = 10, |B| = 15.\n\nWe want to minimize |A \u2229 B|, so we need to maximize |A \u222a B|.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible value of |A \u222a B|?\n\nWell, it can't be more than the total number of people, which is 50.\n\nBut in this case, |A| + |B| = 10 + 15 = 25.\n\nSo, the maximum |A \u222a B| is 25, because even if no one wears both, the union is 25.\n\nWait, but if some people wear both, the union would be less than 25.\n\nSo, to minimize |A \u2229 B|, we need to maximize |A \u222a B|, which in this case is 25.\n\nSo, plugging into the formula:\n\n|A \u2229 B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u222a B| = 10 + 15 - 25 = 0.\n\nSo, the minimum number of people wearing both is 0.\n\nBut the problem says \"the minimum number of people who could be wearing both glasses and hats.\"\n\nIs it possible for no one to be wearing both?\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf 10 people wear glasses and 15 wear hats, and the total number of unique people is 25, then yes, it's possible for no one to wear both.\n\nAlternatively, some people could be wearing both, which would reduce the number in the union.\n\nBut since the union can be as large as 25 without any overlap, the minimum overlap is 0.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider that some people wear neither.\n\nYes, since there are 50 people in total, and only 25 wearing either glasses or hats or both, that means 50 - 25 = 25 people wear neither.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it's possible that no one wears both glasses and hats.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of people wearing both is 0.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nSuppose we have 10 people wearing glasses and 15 wearing hats.\n\nIf no one wears both, then the total number wearing either is 10 + 15 = 25.\n\nIf some people wear both, then the total number wearing either is less than 25.\n\nBut since the total number of people is 50, and the union can be up to 25, that means the minimum overlap is 0.\n\nHence, the minimum number of people wearing both is 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
