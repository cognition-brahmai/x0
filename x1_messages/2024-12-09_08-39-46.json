        "content": "Let's see. I read 5 pages of a book every day, and the book has 250 pages. I need to find out how many days it will take me to finish the book.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. I need to find the total number of days required to read the entire book at a constant rate of 5 pages per day.\n\nSo, the total number of pages is 250, and I read 5 pages each day. To find the number of days, I should divide the total pages by the number of pages I read per day.\n\nThat is, number of days = total pages / pages per day.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: number of days = 250 / 5.\n\nLet me do the division: 250 divided by 5 is 50.\n\nSo, it will take me 50 days to finish the book.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if there's any remainder. If the total pages weren't exactly divisible by the daily reading amount, I might need an extra day. But in this case, 250 divided by 5 is exactly 50, with no remainder.\n\nAlso, I should consider if I read a different number of pages on the last day, but since 250 is perfectly divisible by 5, every day I read exactly 5 pages.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether I read every day without any breaks. The problem says I read 5 pages every day, so I'm assuming I read every day without any breaks.\n\nSo, in conclusion, it will take me 50 days to finish reading the book.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
