Rabbits are herbivores, and their diet primarily consists of hay, fresh vegetables, and a limited amount of pellets. When it comes to beverages, rabbits don't require much water beyond what they get from their food. However, it's essential to provide them with clean, fresh water at all times.\n\nIn terms of beverages, plain water is the healthiest option for rabbits. Some owners might offer diluted fruit juices or herbal teas occasionally, but these should be given in moderation and not as a regular part of their diet. It's crucial to avoid sugary drinks, milk, or any beverages containing caffeine or alcohol, as these can be harmful to rabbits.\n\nAlways ensure that your rabbit has access to clean water, and consult with a veterinarian if you have any concerns about their dietary needs."
