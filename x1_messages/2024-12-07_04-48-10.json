        "content": "Sure! To solve a system of linear equations using the SciPy library in Python, you can use the `linalg.solve` function from SciPy. This function is designed to solve linear equations of the form Ax = b, where A is a square matrix and b is a one-dimensional array.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to creating a Python script that solves a system of linear equations using SciPy and displays the results in a human-readable format:\n\n1. **Install SciPy**: If you haven't already installed SciPy, you can do so using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install scipy\n   ```\n\n2. **Import necessary libraries**: You'll need to import `numpy` for handling arrays and `scipy.linalg` for solving the system of equations.\n\n3. **Define the matrices**: Define the coefficient matrix A and the constant matrix b.\n\n4. **Solve the system**: Use `scipy.linalg.solve` to find the solution vector x.\n\n5. **Display the results**: Print the solution in a readable format.\n\nHere's a sample Python script that demonstrates these steps:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import solve\n\ndef main():\n    # Define the coefficient matrix A and the constant matrix b\n    A = np.array([[3, 2, -1],\n                  [2, -2, 4],\n                  [-1, 0.5, -1]])\n    b = np.array([1, -2, 0])\n    \n    # Solve the system of equations\n    x = solve(A, b)\n    \n    # Display the results\n    print(\"Solution:\")\n    for i, xi in enumerate(x):\n        print(f\"x{i+1} = {xi}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Importing Libraries**:\n   - `numpy` is used for creating and handling arrays.\n   - `scipy.linalg.solve` is used to solve the system of equations.\n\n2. **Defining Matrices**:\n   - Matrix A represents the coefficients of the variables.\n   - Matrix b represents the constants on the right-hand side of the equations.\n\n3. **Solving the System**:\n   - The `solve` function computes the exact solution for x in the equation Ax = b.\n\n4. **Displaying Results**:\n   - The solution vector x is printed in a formatted manner, showing each variable's value.\n\nThis script is straightforward and can be modified to solve different systems of linear equations by changing the matrices A and b accordingly."
