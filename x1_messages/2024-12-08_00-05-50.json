        "content": "Let's figure this out step by step. First, I need to know how many days are in a non-leap year. I remember that a non-leap year has 365 days.\n\nSo, if the man earns $100 per day, and there are 365 days in a non-leap year, I can find out his total earnings by multiplying his daily earnings by the number of days in the year.\n\nThat is:\n\nTotal earnings = daily earnings \u00d7 number of days in a year\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal earnings = $100 \u00d7 365\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication.\n\n100 multiplied by 365 is:\n\n100 \u00d7 365 = 36,500\n\nSo, the man earns $36,500 in a non-leap year.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Like, does he earn on weekends? Or are there holidays where he doesn't work? The question just says \"per day,\" so I think it's safe to assume it's every day of the year.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that it's a non-leap year, because leap years have 366 days. But the question specifies a non-leap year, so 365 days is correct.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe breaking it down into months or weeks, but since the question gives a daily rate, daily multiplication seems straightforward and appropriate.\n\nI don't think I need to consider any taxes or deductions unless specified. The question is about how much he earns, not how much he takes home.\n\nSo, my final answer is $36,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36500} \\]"
