        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a car that travels at two different speeds for two separate intervals. First, it goes 75 miles per hour for 2 hours, and then it slows down to 55 miles per hour for another 2 hours. We need to find the average speed for the entire trip.\n\nOkay, so average speed is total distance divided by total time, right? That's the basic formula. So, I need to find the total distance the car traveled and the total time it took.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance for each part of the trip.\n\nFor the first part:\n\nSpeed = 75 mph\n\nTime = 2 hours\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 75 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 150 miles\n\nFor the second part:\n\nSpeed = 55 mph\n\nTime = 2 hours\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 55 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 110 miles\n\nNow, the total distance is the sum of these two distances:\n\nTotal distance = 150 miles + 110 miles = 260 miles\n\nThe total time is the sum of the two time intervals:\n\nTotal time = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours\n\nSo, the average speed is:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time = 260 miles / 4 hours = 65 mph\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe there's another way to look at it. Maybe I should consider the weighted average of the speeds.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nSince each speed is maintained for the same amount of time (2 hours), the average speed should just be the arithmetic mean of the two speeds.\n\nSo, average speed = (75 mph + 55 mph) / 2 = 130 mph / 2 = 65 mph\n\nHmm, same answer as before. That makes sense because the time spent at each speed is the same.\n\nBut what if the times were different? Say, for example, the car traveled at 75 mph for 1 hour and then at 55 mph for 3 hours. How would that affect the average speed?\n\nLet's consider that scenario to understand better.\n\nFirst part:\n\nSpeed = 75 mph\n\nTime = 1 hour\n\nDistance = 75 mph \u00d7 1 hour = 75 miles\n\nSecond part:\n\nSpeed = 55 mph\n\nTime = 3 hours\n\nDistance = 55 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 165 miles\n\nTotal distance = 75 miles + 165 miles = 240 miles\n\nTotal time = 1 hour + 3 hours = 4 hours\n\nAverage speed = 240 miles / 4 hours = 60 mph\n\nNow, if I were to take the weighted average, with times as weights:\n\nAverage speed = (75 mph \u00d7 1 hour + 55 mph \u00d7 3 hours) / (1 hour + 3 hours) = (75 + 165) / 4 = 240 / 4 = 60 mph\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nSo, in general, the average speed is the total distance divided by the total time, which can also be thought of as the weighted average of the speeds, weighted by the time spent at each speed.\n\nIn the original problem, since the times are equal, the average speed is simply the arithmetic mean of the two speeds.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another approach using harmonic mean.\n\nI recall that for speeds over the same distance, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the two speeds. But in this case, the distances are different because the times are the same, not the distances.\n\nWait, no, the harmonic mean is used when the distances are the same but the speeds are different.\n\nFor example, if the car traveled 75 mph for one segment and 55 mph for another segment of the same distance, then the average speed would be the harmonic mean of the two speeds.\n\nBut in our problem, the times are the same, not the distances.\n\nSo, the harmonic mean doesn't apply here directly.\n\nStick with the total distance divided by total time.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to plot speed versus time and find the average value.\n\nIf I were to plot this, for the first 2 hours, the speed is 75 mph, and for the next 2 hours, it's 55 mph.\n\nThe average speed would be the area under the speed-time graph divided by the total time.\n\nThe area under the graph is simply (75 mph \u00d7 2 hours) + (55 mph \u00d7 2 hours) = 150 miles + 110 miles = 260 miles\n\nTotal time is 4 hours, so average speed is 260 miles / 4 hours = 65 mph\n\nSame answer again.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs the car accelerating between the two speeds? The problem doesn't say anything about acceleration, so I assume it instantly transitions from 75 mph to 55 mph.\n\nDoes that affect the average speed? Probably not, since we're given constant speeds for each interval.\n\nAlso, are there any units I need to convert? Everything is in miles and hours, so no conversion needed.\n\nIs there any possibility of the car traveling in different directions? The problem doesn't specify, but since it's about speed, which is scalar, direction doesn't matter unless it's a velocity problem.\n\nBut it's about speed, so scalar quantity, direction isn't relevant.\n\nTherefore, the average speed for the entire trip is 65 mph.\n\nI think that's the most precise and complete solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{65 \\text{ mph}} \\]"
