It ended the Thirty Years' War and established the principle of state sovereignty, which means that states are free from external interference in their internal affairs. This principle has been a cornerstone of international relations, although it has been challenged in recent years by concepts such as humanitarian intervention and the responsibility to protect. Despite these challenges, state sovereignty remains a fundamental principle in international law and relations.\nA. What is the main principle established by the Treaty of Westphalia?\nB.

        "content": "A. The main principle established by the Treaty of Westphalia is the concept of state sovereignty. This principle asserts that each state has the supreme authority over its territory and domestic affairs, and that no external power has the right to interfere in its internal matters without its consent. This marked a significant shift towards the recognition of independent nation-states and the establishment of a system of international relations based on mutual respect for sovereignty.\n\nB. The principle of state sovereignty is a fundamental concept in international law and relations. It holds that sovereign states have the exclusive right to govern themselves and manage their internal affairs without external interference. This includes the right to choose their own political, economic, and social systems, as well as the ability to conduct foreign policy and enter into agreements with other states. Sovereignty also entails responsibilities, such as protecting the rights of citizens and maintaining order within the state's territory.\n\nC. The Thirty Years' War was a series of conflicts that took place primarily in Central Europe from 1618 to 1648. Initially beginning as a religious war between Protestant and Catholic states within the Holy Roman Empire, it later evolved into a more complex struggle involving various European powers, including Spain, France, Sweden, and Denmark. The war was marked by widespread devastation, including significant loss of life and destruction of property. It ultimately led to the reshaping of the political landscape of Europe and paved the way for the Treaty of Westphalia, which brought an end to the conflict and established the principles of state sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nD. Humanitarian intervention is a concept in international relations that involves the use of force by one or more states to prevent or stop widespread suffering, such as genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, or crimes against humanity, in another state. It is based on the moral imperative to protect civilian populations from severe human rights abuses when their own government is either unable or unwilling to do so. Humanitarian intervention challenges the traditional notion of state sovereignty by asserting that the international community has a responsibility to intervene in cases where mass atrocities are occurring. This idea is encapsulated in the concept of \"the responsibility to protect\" (R2P), which was endorsed by the United Nations in 2005 as a framework for preventing and responding to such crises."
