        "content": "Let's see. So, the store sells apples for $1.50 per pound and oranges for $2.00 per pound. The customer is buying 4 pounds of apples and 3 pounds of oranges, and there's a 20% discount on the total price. I need to find out how much they will save because of the discount.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total cost without the discount. To do that, I'll multiply the price per pound of each fruit by the number of pounds bought and then add them together.\n\nSo, for apples:\n\n4 pounds * $1.50 per pound = $6.00\n\nFor oranges:\n\n3 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $6.00\n\nNow, add those two amounts to get the total cost before the discount:\n\n$6.00 + $6.00 = $12.00\n\nNext, I need to calculate the discount. The store is offering a 20% discount on the total price. To find out how much the discount is, I'll take 20% of $12.00.\n\n20% of $12.00 = 0.20 * $12.00 = $2.40\n\nSo, the customer will save $2.40 because of the discount.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe I should confirm my calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate the cost of apples and oranges again.\n\nApples: 4 pounds * $1.50/pound = $6.00\n\nOranges: 3 pounds * $2.00/pound = $6.00\n\nTotal before discount: $6.00 + $6.00 = $12.00\n\nNow, 20% discount on $12.00:\n\n20% of $12.00 = (20/100) * $12.00 = 0.20 * $12.00 = $2.40\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total price after the discount and see how much they pay, but the question is asking how much they will save, which is the discount amount.\n\nSo, the savings are $2.40.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.40} \\]"
