        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There are 8 red shirts, 12 blue shirts, and 15 green shirts on display. A customer wants to buy one of each color, so they need one red, one blue, and one green shirt. The question is, what's the probability that the first three shirts they pick are one of each color?\n\nAlright, probability problems can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step. First, I need to understand the total number of shirts and how many ways there are to pick three shirts out of that total.\n\nSo, total shirts = 8 red + 12 blue + 15 green = 35 shirts.\n\nNow, the customer is picking three shirts one after another, and we want the probability that these three are all of different colors, one red, one blue, and one green.\n\nSince the order in which they pick the shirts matters in terms of probability (because once a shirt is picked, it's not replaced, I assume), I need to consider the sequence of picks.\n\nLet me consider the different possible sequences in which the customer can pick one of each color. The sequences are:\n\n1. Red, then blue, then green.\n\n2. Red, then green, then blue.\n\n3. Blue, then red, then green.\n\n4. Blue, then green, then red.\n\n5. Green, then red, then blue.\n\n6. Green, then blue, then red.\n\nSo, there are 6 possible sequences.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the probability for each sequence and then add them up because these are mutually exclusive events.\n\nLet's start with the first sequence: Red, then blue, then green.\n\nProbability of picking a red shirt first:\n\nNumber of red shirts / total shirts = 8/35.\n\nAfter picking a red shirt, there are now 34 shirts left.\n\nProbability of picking a blue shirt next:\n\nNumber of blue shirts / remaining shirts = 12/34.\n\nThen, probability of picking a green shirt next:\n\nNumber of green shirts / remaining shirts = 15/33.\n\nSo, the probability for this sequence is (8/35) * (12/34) * (15/33).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 8/35 = 0.22857 approximately.\n\nThen, 12/34 = 0.35294 approximately.\n\nThen, 15/33 = 0.45455 approximately.\n\nMultiplying these together: 0.22857 * 0.35294 * 0.45455 \u2248 0.0365 or 3.65%.\n\nBut maybe it's better to keep it as fractions to maintain accuracy.\n\nSo, (8/35) * (12/34) * (15/33) = (8*12*15)/(35*34*33).\n\nCalculating numerator: 8*12=96, 96*15=1440.\n\nDenominator: 35*34=1190, 1190*33=39270.\n\nSo, 1440 / 39270.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction.\n\nBoth numerator and denominator are divisible by 10: 144 / 3927.\n\nNow, divided by 3: 48 / 1309.\n\nI think that's as simplified as it gets.\n\nNow, since there are 6 such sequences, and each has the same probability (because the numbers are symmetric in terms of color order), the total probability is 6 * (48 / 1309).\n\nSo, 6 * 48 = 288.\n\nTherefore, total probability is 288 / 1309.\n\nLet me check if that's reducible. 288 and 1309.\n\n1309 divided by 288 is 4.545..., not divisible.\n\nCheck for common factors.\n\n288 is divisible by 16, 9, etc.\n\n1309 divided by 9 is 145.444..., not divisible.\n\n1309 divided by 16 is 81.8125, not divisible.\n\nSo, 288/1309 is already in simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake assuming all sequences have the same probability. Let me verify.\n\nWait, actually, in terms of calculations, since the numbers of shirts are different for each color, the probability might vary depending on the order.\n\nWait a minute, in the first sequence, red then blue then green, the probabilities were 8/35, 12/34, and 15/33.\n\nIn another sequence, say blue then red then green, it would be 12/35, 8/34, and 15/33.\n\nSo, actually, the probabilities are different for different sequences because the denominators remain the same, but the numerators change based on the number of shirts of each color.\n\nTherefore, I need to calculate each sequence separately.\n\nLet's calculate all six sequences.\n\nFirst sequence: red, blue, green.\n\nProbability: (8/35) * (12/34) * (15/33) = (8*12*15)/(35*34*33) = 1440 / 39270 = 48 / 1309.\n\nSecond sequence: red, green, blue.\n\nProbability: (8/35) * (15/34) * (12/33) = (8*15*12)/(35*34*33) = 1440 / 39270 = 48 / 1309.\n\nThird sequence: blue, red, green.\n\nProbability: (12/35) * (8/34) * (15/33) = (12*8*15)/(35*34*33) = 1440 / 39270 = 48 / 1309.\n\nFourth sequence: blue, green, red.\n\nProbability: (12/35) * (15/34) * (8/33) = (12*15*8)/(35*34*33) = 1440 / 39270 = 48 / 1309.\n\nFifth sequence: green, red, blue.\n\nProbability: (15/35) * (8/34) * (12/33) = (15*8*12)/(35*34*33) = 1440 / 39270 = 48 / 1309.\n\nSixth sequence: green, blue, red.\n\nProbability: (15/35) * (12/34) * (8/33) = (15*12*8)/(35*34*33) = 1440 / 39270 = 48 / 1309.\n\nSo, indeed, each sequence has the same probability of 48/1309.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is 6 * (48/1309) = 288 / 1309.\n\nNow, let's see if this fraction can be simplified.\n\n288 and 1309.\n\nDivide both by 3: 288 \u00f7 3 = 96, 1309 \u00f7 3 = 436.333..., not divisible.\n\nNext, 288 \u00f7 7 = 41.142..., 1309 \u00f7 7 = 187, not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 11 = 26.181..., 1309 \u00f7 11 = 119, not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 13 = 22.153..., 1309 \u00f7 13 = 100.692..., not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 17 = 16.941..., 1309 \u00f7 17 = 77, not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 19 = 15.157..., 1309 \u00f7 19 = 69.421..., not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 23 = 12.521..., 1309 \u00f7 23 = 57, not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 29 = 9.931..., 1309 \u00f7 29 = 45.137..., not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 31 = 9.290..., 1309 \u00f7 31 = 42.225..., not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 37 = 7.783..., 1309 \u00f7 37 = 35.378..., not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 41 = 7.024..., 1309 \u00f7 41 = 32, not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 43 = 6.707..., 1309 \u00f7 43 = 30.441..., not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 47 = 6.127..., 1309 \u00f7 47 = 27.851..., not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 53 = 5.433..., 1309 \u00f7 53 = 24.698..., not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 59 = 4.874..., 1309 \u00f7 59 = 22.186..., not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 61 = 4.719..., 1309 \u00f7 61 = 21.458..., not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 67 = 4.295..., 1309 \u00f7 67 = 19.537..., not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 71 = 4.056..., 1309 \u00f7 71 = 18.436..., not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 73 = 3.945..., 1309 \u00f7 73 = 17.931..., not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 79 = 3.645..., 1309 \u00f7 79 = 16.569..., not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 83 = 3.469..., 1309 \u00f7 83 = 15.771..., not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 89 = 3.235..., 1309 \u00f7 89 = 14.707..., not divisible.\n\n288 \u00f7 97 = 2.968..., 1309 \u00f7 97 = 13.494..., not divisible.\n\nSo, it seems that 288 and 1309 have no common factors other than 1, meaning 288/1309 is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the first three shirts picked are one of each color is 288/1309.\n\nAlternatively, we can express this as a decimal for better understanding.\n\n288 divided by 1309 is approximately 0.220, or 22%.\n\nSo, there's approximately a 22% chance that the first three shirts picked are one of each color.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that calculation.\n\n288 / 1309 = ?\n\nLet me do the division carefully.\n\n1309 goes into 288 zero times, so 1309 * 0 = 0.\n\nSubtract 0 from 288 to get 288.\n\nBring down a zero to make it 2880.\n\n1309 goes into 2880 twice: 1309 * 2 = 2618.\n\nSubtract 2618 from 2880 to get 262.\n\nBring down another zero to make it 2620.\n\n1309 goes into 2620 once: 1309 * 1 = 1309.\n\nSubtract 1309 from 2620 to get 1311.\n\nBring down another zero to make it 13110.\n\n1309 goes into 13110 nine times: 1309 * 9 = 11781.\n\nSubtract 11781 from 13110 to get 1329.\n\nBring down another zero to make it 13290.\n\n1309 goes into 13290 nine times: 1309 * 9 = 11781.\n\nSubtract 11781 from 13290 to get 1509.\n\nBring down another zero to make it 15090.\n\n1309 goes into 15090 eleven times: 1309 * 11 = 14399.\n\nSubtract 14399 from 15090 to get 691.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, 288 / 1309 is approximately 0.22001, which is about 22%.\n\nTherefore, the probability is roughly 22%, or more precisely, 288/1309.\n\nAlternatively, we can express it as a percentage: approximately 21.97%.\n\nSo, there's about a 22% chance that the first three shirts picked are one of each color.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 3.65% for one sequence, and since there are six sequences, it would be around 22%.\n\nActually, that matches up.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider another approach.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick three shirts out of 35 is C(35,3), which is 35 choose 3.\n\nC(35,3) = 35! / (3! * (35-3)!) = (35*34*33)/(3*2*1) = 35*17*11 = 6545.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to pick one red, one blue, and one green shirt.\n\nNumber of ways to pick one red shirt: C(8,1) = 8.\n\nOne blue shirt: C(12,1) = 12.\n\nOne green shirt: C(15,1) = 15.\n\nSo, total favorable outcomes: 8 * 12 * 15 = 1440.\n\nTherefore, probability = favorable / total = 1440 / 6545.\n\nLet's simplify 1440 / 6545.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 288 / 1309.\n\nAgain, we get the same fraction as before, 288/1309.\n\nSo, this confirms that our initial approach was correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the customer is picking the shirts one at a time, and we consider the order, then the total number of ways to pick any three shirts in order is 35*34*33 = 39270.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to pick one of each color in any order.\n\nWe calculated earlier that there are 6 sequences, each with 1440 ways.\n\nSo, total favorable outcomes: 6 * 1440 = 8640.\n\nTherefore, probability = 8640 / 39270 = 288 / 1309, which matches our previous result.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, we end up with the same probability.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the first three shirts picked are one of each color is 288/1309, or approximately 22%.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{288}{1309}} \\]"
