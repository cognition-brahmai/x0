        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: a farmer has ducks and cows on his farm. He counts a total of 40 heads and 100 legs among all his animals. I need to figure out how many ducks he has.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by understanding what's given. Ducks and cows are the animals involved. Ducks have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Also, each animal has one head.\n\nSo, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let D be the number of ducks.\n\n- Let C be the number of cows.\n\nFrom the problem, I know that the total number of heads is 40. Since each animal has one head, the total number of animals is 40. So:\n\nD + C = 40\n\nThat's one equation.\n\nNext, the total number of legs is 100. Ducks have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. So:\n\n2D + 4C = 100\n\nNow, I have two equations with two variables:\n\n1) D + C = 40\n\n2) 2D + 4C = 100\n\nI need to solve these equations to find the value of D, which is the number of ducks.\n\nHmm, how can I solve these equations? One way is to use the substitution method. From the first equation, I can express D in terms of C:\n\nD = 40 - C\n\nNow, I can substitute this expression for D into the second equation:\n\n2(40 - C) + 4C = 100\n\nLet me simplify that:\n\n80 - 2C + 4C = 100\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n80 + 2C = 100\n\nNow, subtract 80 from both sides:\n\n2C = 20\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nC = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 cows.\n\nNow, plug this back into the first equation to find D:\n\nD + 10 = 40\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\nD = 30\n\nTherefore, the farmer has 30 ducks.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If there are 30 ducks and 10 cows:\n\n- Total heads: 30 + 10 = 40, which matches.\n\n- Total legs: (30 * 2) + (10 * 4) = 60 + 40 = 100, which also matches.\n\nLooks good. Alternatively, I could have used the elimination method. Let's see:\n\nStarting with the two equations:\n\n1) D + C = 40\n\n2) 2D + 4C = 100\n\nI can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of D the same:\n\n2D + 2C = 80\n\nNow, subtract this from the second equation:\n\n(2D + 4C) - (2D + 2C) = 100 - 80\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2C = 20\n\nSo, C = 10, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nYeah, it seems consistent. So, the farmer has 30 ducks.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using ratios or something like that?\n\nWell, thinking about it, the difference in legs comes from the cows having two more legs than ducks. Since ducks have 2 legs and cows have 4, each cow contributes 2 extra legs compared to a duck.\n\nLet's assume all animals are ducks. Then, total legs would be 40 * 2 = 80 legs.\n\nBut actually, there are 100 legs, which is 20 legs more than 80.\n\nSince each cow adds 2 extra legs, the number of cows is 20 / 2 = 10 cows.\n\nTherefore, ducks are total animals minus cows: 40 - 10 = 30 ducks.\n\nAgain, it confirms the earlier result.\n\nThis method is sometimes called the \"assumption method.\" It can be a quicker way to solve such problems without setting up equations.\n\nLet me try to generalize this method. Suppose there are two types of animals: one with L1 legs and the other with L2 legs. Total heads are H, and total legs are F.\n\nIf we assume all are of type 1, then total legs would be H * L1.\n\nBut actual legs are F, so the difference is F - H * L1.\n\nEach animal of type 2 adds (L2 - L1) legs compared to type 1.\n\nTherefore, number of type 2 animals is (F - H * L1) / (L2 - L1).\n\nIn this problem: L1 = 2 (ducks), L2 = 4 (cows), H = 40, F = 100.\n\nSo, number of cows = (100 - 40 * 2) / (4 - 2) = (100 - 80) / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10 cows.\n\nThen, ducks = 40 - 10 = 30 ducks.\n\nIt's the same as before.\n\nThis method can be efficient when dealing with such problems, especially when there are large numbers.\n\nNow, just to make sure, is there any other way to look at this problem?\n\nPerhaps using ratios of legs to heads.\n\nLet's see, total legs to total heads is 100:40, which simplifies to 5:2.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that directly helps here.\n\nWait, maybe I can think in terms of average legs per animal.\n\nTotal legs divided by total animals is 100 / 40 = 2.5 legs per animal.\n\nBut ducks have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs.\n\nSo, the average is 2.5, which is between 2 and 4.\n\nLet me see, perhaps I can set up a proportion.\n\nIf all animals were ducks, average would be 2 legs.\n\nFor each cow, the average increases by (4 - 2) = 2 legs.\n\nSo, to reach an average of 2.5 legs, the number of cows would be (2.5 - 2) / (4 - 2) = 0.5 / 2 = 0.25 of the total animals.\n\nBut 0.25 of 40 is 10 cows, which matches again.\n\nTherefore, ducks are 40 - 10 = 30.\n\nThis is consistent with all the methods I've used.\n\nIt's reassuring that all these different approaches lead to the same answer.\n\nI think I've covered multiple ways to solve this problem, and all of them point to the farmer having 30 ducks.\n\nSo, the final answer is 30 ducks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
