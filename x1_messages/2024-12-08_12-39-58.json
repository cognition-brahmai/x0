        "content": "Let's see. There's a train leaving from New York City heading to Los Angeles at 100 miles per hour, and then three hours later, another train leaves from Los Angeles heading towards New York City at 200 miles per hour. They're on the same track, and we need to figure out when they'll meet.\n\nFirst, I need to know the distance between New York City and Los Angeles. I recall it's about 2,800 miles, but I should confirm that. According to various sources, the distance is approximately 2,780 miles. So, I'll use that figure.\n\nNow, the first train leaves New York City at 100 mph, and three hours later, the second train leaves Los Angeles at 200 mph. So, by the time the second train starts, the first train has already been traveling for three hours.\n\nLet me calculate how far the first train has traveled in those three hours.\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time\n\nDistance = 100 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 300 miles\n\nSo, the first train has covered 300 miles in the first three hours. That means the remaining distance between the two trains when the second one starts is:\n\nTotal distance - distance already covered by the first train = 2,780 miles - 300 miles = 2,480 miles\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other, so their speeds will add up relative to each other.\n\nRelative speed = speed of first train + speed of second train = 100 mph + 200 mph = 300 mph\n\nSo, they are closing the gap between them at a rate of 300 miles per hour.\n\nNow, time taken to cover the remaining 2,480 miles at 300 mph is:\n\nTime = distance / relative speed = 2,480 miles / 300 mph = 8.2667 hours\n\nThat's approximately 8 hours and 16 minutes.\n\nBut, since the first train had already been traveling for three hours before the second train started, the total time from when the first train left until they meet is:\n\n3 hours + 8.2667 hours = 11.2667 hours\n\nWhich is approximately 11 hours and 16 minutes.\n\nSo, they will meet about 11 hours and 16 minutes after the first train leaves New York City.\n\nWait a minute, but I should check if this makes sense. Let me verify the calculations.\n\nFirst, distance already covered by the first train in 3 hours: 100 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 300 miles.\n\nRemaining distance: 2,780 - 300 = 2,480 miles.\n\nCombined speed: 100 + 200 = 300 mph.\n\nTime to cover 2,480 miles at 300 mph: 2,480 / 300 = 8.2667 hours.\n\nTotal time from first train's departure: 3 + 8.2667 = 11.2667 hours.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of relative motion. The first train has a head start of 300 miles, and then both trains are moving towards each other at a combined speed of 300 mph, so the time to cover the remaining 2,480 miles is indeed 8.2667 hours.\n\nTherefore, they will meet approximately 11 hours and 16 minutes after the first train departs from New York City.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11 \\text{ hours and } 16 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
