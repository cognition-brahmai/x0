        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of selecting exactly 3 boys and 2 girls out of a class of 25 students, where there are 12 boys and 13 girls. The teacher is selecting 5 students at random.\n\nFirst, let's understand the total number of ways to select 5 students out of 25. This can be calculated using the combination formula, which is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 5 students out of 25 is:\n\n\\[\nC(25, 5) = \\frac{25!}{5!(25 - 5)!} = \\frac{25!}{5! \\times 20!}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to choose exactly 3 boys out of 12 and 2 girls out of 13.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 12 is:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 3) = \\frac{12!}{3!(12 - 3)!} = \\frac{12!}{3! \\times 9!}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 13 is:\n\n\\[\nC(13, 2) = \\frac{13!}{2!(13 - 2)!} = \\frac{13!}{2! \\times 11!}\n\\]\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes, which is selecting exactly 3 boys and 2 girls, is the product of the two combinations above:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 3) \\times C(13, 2)\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability \\( P \\) of selecting exactly 3 boys and 2 girls is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{C(12, 3) \\times C(13, 2)}{C(25, 5)}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate each combination step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate \\( C(12, 3) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(12, 3) = \\frac{12!}{3! \\times 9!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9!}{3! \\times 9!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{1320}{6} = 220\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate \\( C(13, 2) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(13, 2) = \\frac{13!}{2! \\times 11!} = \\frac{13 \\times 12 \\times 11!}{2! \\times 11!} = \\frac{13 \\times 12}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{156}{2} = 78\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate \\( C(25, 5) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(25, 5) = \\frac{25!}{5! \\times 20!} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20!}{120 \\times 20!} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21}{120}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the numerator:\n\n\\[\n25 \\times 24 = 600 \\\\\n600 \\times 23 = 13,800 \\\\\n13,800 \\times 22 = 303,600 \\\\\n303,600 \\times 21 = 6,375,600\n\\]\n\nNow, divide by the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6,375,600}{120} = 53,130\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( C(25, 5) = 53,130 \\).\n\nNow, calculate the number of favorable outcomes:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 3) \\times C(13, 2) = 220 \\times 78 = 17,160\n\\]\n\nFinally, calculate the probability:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{17,160}{53,130}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 30:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{17,160 \\div 30}{53,130 \\div 30} = \\frac{572}{1,771}\n\\]\n\nCheck if this can be simplified further. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 572 and 1,771 needs to be found.\n\nFirst, find the GCD of 572 and 1,771.\n\nPrime factors of 572:\n\n572 \u00f7 2 = 286\n\n286 \u00f7 2 = 143\n\n143 \u00f7 11 = 13\n\nSo, 572 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 13\n\nPrime factors of 1,771:\n\n1,771 \u00f7 7 = 253\n\n253 \u00f7 11 = 23\n\nSo, 1,771 = 7 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 23\n\nCommon prime factor is 11.\n\nTherefore, GCD is 11.\n\nNow, divide numerator and denominator by 11:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{572 \u00f7 11}{1,771 \u00f7 11} = \\frac{52}{161}\n\\]\n\nSo, the simplified probability is \\( \\frac{52}{161} \\).\n\nTo express this as a decimal, perform the division:\n\n52 \u00f7 161 \u2248 0.323\n\nTo express as a percentage, multiply by 100:\n\n0.323 \u00d7 100 \u2248 32.3%\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting exactly 3 boys and 2 girls is approximately 32.3%, or in fraction form, \\( \\frac{52}{161} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{52}{161}} \\]"
