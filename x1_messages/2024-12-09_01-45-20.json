Actors in Kabuki often play multiple roles, including female characters, which are traditionally performed by male actors in a style known as onnagata. The performances are accompanied by music and can be quite lengthy, sometimes spanning an entire day. It's really fascinating to watch, especially if you're interested in history and culture.\n"
