        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this problem: a bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to figure out the cost of the ball. Let's denote the cost of the ball as \\( b \\) dollars. According to the problem, the bat costs $1 more than the ball, so the bat would cost \\( b + 1 \\) dollars.\n\nNow, together, the bat and the ball cost $1.10. So, I can set up an equation:\n\n\\[ b + (b + 1) = 1.10 \\]\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\[ 2b + 1 = 1.10 \\]\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 2b = 0.10 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ b = 0.05 \\]\n\nSo, the ball costs $0.05, and the bat costs $1 more, which is $1.05. Adding them up: $0.05 + $1.05 = $1.10. That makes sense.\n\nBut wait, I remember that this is a tricky problem because a lot of people intuitively think that if the bat costs $1 more than the ball, and together they cost $1.10, then the ball must cost $0.10 and the bat $1.00, but that only adds up to $1.10 if you add them directly, but actually, $1.00 is only $0.90 more than $0.10, not $1 more.\n\nSo, the intuitive answer is wrong. The ball can't be $0.10 because then the bat would be $1.00, and the difference would be only $0.90, not $1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the ball costs $0.05 and the bat costs $1.05.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.05} \\]"
