        "content": "Implementing a simple chat application in Python using the socket library involves creating both a server and client components. The server will handle multiple clients and broadcast messages to all connected clients except the sender. Each client will be able to send and receive messages in real-time.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Server Setup:**\n   - Use `socket` to create a TCP/IP server.\n   - Use `threading` to handle multiple clients concurrently.\n   - Maintain a list of connected clients.\n   - Broadcast messages from one client to all other connected clients.\n\n2. **Client Setup:**\n   - Use `socket` to connect to the server.\n   - Use two threads: one for sending messages and one for receiving messages.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n#### Server Code\n\n```python\nimport socket\nimport threading\n\nserver_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\nhost = '127.0.0.1'\nport = 12345\nserver_socket.bind((host, port))\nserver_socket.listen(5)\nprint(f\"Server listening on {host}:{port}\")\n\nclients = []\nnicknames = []\n\ndef broadcast(message, sender_socket):\n    for client in clients:\n        if client != sender_socket:\n            try:\n                client.send(message)\n            except:\n                # Remove the client if unable to send message\n                remove(client)\n\ndef remove(client_socket):\n    if client_socket in clients:\n        index = clients.index(client_socket)\n        nickname = nicknames[index]\n        broadcast(f'{nickname} left the chat!'.encode('ascii'), client_socket)\n        clients.remove(client_socket)\n        nicknames.remove(nickname)\n        client_socket.close()\n\ndef handle_client(client_socket):\n    while True:\n        try:\n            message = client_socket.recv(1024)\n            broadcast(message, client_socket)\n        except:\n            remove(client_socket)\n            break\n\ndef receive():\n    while True:\n        client_socket, addr = server_socket.accept()\n        print(f\"Connected with {str(addr)}\")\n        \n        client_socket.send('NICK'.encode('ascii'))\n        nickname = client_socket.recv(1024).decode('ascii')\n        nicknames.append(nickname)\n        clients.append(client_socket)\n        \n        print(f\"Nickname of client is {nickname}!\")\n        broadcast(f\"{nickname} joined the chat!\".encode('ascii'), client_socket)\n        client_socket.send('Connected to the server!'.encode('ascii'))\n        \n        thread = threading.Thread(target=handle_client, args=(client_socket,))\n        thread.start()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    receive()\n```\n\n#### Client Code\n\n```python\nimport socket\nimport threading\n\nclient_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\nhost = '127.0.0.1'\nport = 12345\nclient_socket.connect((host, port))\n\ndef receive():\n    while True:\n        try:\n            message = client_socket.recv(1024).decode('ascii')\n            if message == 'NICK':\n                client_socket.send(nickname.encode('ascii'))\n            else:\n                print(message)\n        except:\n            print(\"An error occurred!\")\n            client_socket.close()\n            break\n\ndef write():\n    while True:\n        message = f'{nickname}: {input(\"\")}'\n        client_socket.send(message.encode('ascii'))\n\nnickname = input(\"Choose your nickname: \")\n\nreceive_thread = threading.Thread(target=receive)\nreceive_thread.start()\n\nwrite_thread = threading.Thread(target=write)\nwrite_thread.start()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Server:**\n   - Listens for incoming connections.\n   - Assigns nicknames to clients.\n   - Broadcasts messages from one client to all others.\n   - Handles disconnections gracefully.\n\n2. **Client:**\n   - Connects to the server.\n   - Sends nickname upon connection.\n   - Listens for incoming messages and prints them.\n   - Allows the user to send messages in real-time.\n\nThis setup ensures that multiple clients can connect to the server, send messages, and receive messages from other clients simultaneously."
