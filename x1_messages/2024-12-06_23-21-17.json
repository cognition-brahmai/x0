        "content": "Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that. Let's dive into how we can implement Dijkstra's algorithm in Java to find the shortest path between two nodes in an undirected, weighted graph.\n\nFirst off, Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular way to find the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. It works well for graphs with non-negative edge weights. Since your graph is undirected and weighted, Dijkstra's algorithm is a perfect fit.\n\nTo implement this, we'll need to represent our graph in a way that's easy to work with. A common approach is to use an adjacency list, where each node has a list of its neighboring nodes along with the weights of the edges connecting them.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Graph Representation:** We'll use a map where each key is a node, and the value is another map representing its neighbors and the weights of the edges to those neighbors.\n\n2. **Priority Queue:** We'll use a priority queue to always select the node with the smallest current distance to explore next.\n\n3. **Distance Array:** Keep track of the shortest distances from the start node to each node.\n\n4. **Predecessor Array:** Keep track of the predecessors to each node to reconstruct the path later.\n\n5. **Algorithm Steps:**\n   - Initialize distances to all nodes as infinite except the start node, which is 0.\n   - Add the start node to the priority queue.\n   - While the priority queue is not empty:\n     - Extract the node with the smallest distance.\n     - For each neighbor of the current node:\n       - Calculate the distance through the current node.\n       - If this distance is less than the previously known distance, update it.\n       - Add the neighbor to the priority queue if it's not already there.\n\n6. **Path Reconstruction:** Once the algorithm is done, use the predecessor array to build the path from the end node back to the start node.\n\nLet's translate this plan into Java code.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we will implement Dijkstra's algorithm in Java to find the shortest path between two nodes in an undirected, weighted graph.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Representation:** Use a `Map<Integer, Map<Integer, Integer>>` where keys are node identifiers, and values are maps of neighboring nodes with their corresponding edge weights.\n2. **Priority Queue:** Use a `PriorityQueue` to always expand the node with the smallest known distance.\n3. **Distance Tracking:** Maintain a `distance` array to track the shortest distance from the start node to each node.\n4. **Predecessor Tracking:** Use a `predecessor` array to record the path for reconstruction.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class

and its value is another map of neighboring nodes with edge weights.\n2. **Priority Queue:** We prioritize nodes based on their current shortest distance from the start node.\n3. **Distance Tracking:** We maintain and update distances to each node as we explore the graph.\n4. **Predecessor Tracking:** We record the path by keeping track of each node's predecessor.\n5. **Path Reconstruction:** Once the algorithm completes, we reconstruct the path from the end node back to the start node using the predecessor map.\n\nThis implementation efficiently computes the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm, suitable for graphs with non-negative edge weights."
