        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a bag with different colored balls: 5 red, 3 blue, and 2 green. I need to find the probability of drawing a blue ball at random. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what probability means. Probability is the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcome is drawing a blue ball, and the total outcomes are all the balls in the bag.\n\nLet me figure out the total number of balls. There are 5 red, 3 blue, and 2 green balls. So, total balls = 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 balls.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of blue balls, which is 3.\n\nSo, probability of drawing a blue ball = number of blue balls / total number of balls = 3/10.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should consider whether the balls are being replaced or not, or if there's any other condition. The problem says \"randomly drawing a blue ball,\" and doesn't mention anything about replacement or multiple draws, so I think it's just a single draw.\n\nHmm, maybe I should think about it in terms of percentages too. 3/10 is 0.3, which is 30%. So, there's a 30% chance of drawing a blue ball.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using combinations. The number of ways to choose one blue ball from three is C(3,1), and the total number of ways to choose any ball from ten is C(10,1). So, probability = C(3,1)/C(10,1) = 3/10. Same result.\n\nAlright, I think that makes sense. Probability is 3/10.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is the bag well-mixed? Are there any biased ways of drawing the balls? The problem doesn't specify anything like that, so I assume it's a fair draw.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I haven't miscounted the total number of balls. 5 red + 3 blue + 2 green indeed equals 10. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, final answer: the probability is 3/10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{10}} \\]"
