However, it's worth noting that the term \"pachyderm\" is not used in modern biological classification systems, as it is based on outdated ideas about animal relationships. In current taxonomy, elephants are classified in the order Proboscidea, rhinoceroses in Perissodactyla, and hippopotamuses in Artiodactyla."
