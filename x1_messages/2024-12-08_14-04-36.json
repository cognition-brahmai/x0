        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two types of candies, Type A and Type B, with different prices per pound, and we need to figure out how many pounds of each to buy to meet a total weight and total cost.\n\nFirst, let's note down what we know:\n\n- Price per pound of Type A: $8\n\n- Price per pound of Type B: $12\n\n- Total pounds to buy: 6 pounds\n\n- Total cost: $60\n\nWe need to find out how many pounds of Type A and Type B to purchase.\n\nLet's define variables to make this easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the pounds of Type A candy.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the pounds of Type B candy.\n\nNow, we can set up equations based on the information given.\n\nFirst equation: the total weight of the candies.\n\n\\( x + y = 6 \\)\n\nSecond equation: the total cost of the candies.\n\nSince Type A costs $8 per pound and Type B costs $12 per pound, the total cost is:\n\n\\( 8x + 12y = 60 \\)\n\nSo, we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 6 \\)\n\n2. \\( 8x + 12y = 60 \\)\n\nWe can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. I'll use the substitution method here.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n\\( x = 6 - y \\)\n\nNow, substitute \\( x \\) in equation 2:\n\n\\( 8(6 - y) + 12y = 60 \\)\n\nLet's simplify this:\n\n\\( 48 - 8y + 12y = 60 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 48 + 4y = 60 \\)\n\nSubtract 48 from both sides:\n\n\\( 4y = 12 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n\\( y = 3 \\)\n\nNow that we have \\( y \\), which is the pounds of Type B, we can find \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 6 - y = 6 - 3 = 3 \\)\n\nSo, the customer should purchase 3 pounds of Type A and 3 pounds of Type B.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure it adds up correctly.\n\nTotal weight: 3 + 3 = 6 pounds \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTotal cost: (3 pounds of A * $8) + (3 pounds of B * $12) = $24 + $36 = $60 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nIt seems correct. However, sometimes there can be different solutions, so let's see if there are other possibilities.\n\nSuppose we try different values. For example, if we buy 4 pounds of Type A and 2 pounds of Type B:\n\nTotal weight: 4 + 2 = 6 pounds\n\nTotal cost: (4 * 8) + (2 * 12) = 32 + 24 = $56, which is less than $60.\n\nAlternatively, if we buy 2 pounds of Type A and 4 pounds of Type B:\n\nTotal weight: 2 + 4 = 6 pounds\n\nTotal cost: (2 * 8) + (4 * 12) = 16 + 48 = $64, which is more than $60.\n\nSo, our initial solution of 3 pounds each seems to be the only one that meets both the weight and cost requirements.\n\nAlternatively, we could have approached this problem using ratios or thinking about the average price per pound.\n\nThe average price per pound required is total cost divided by total weight:\n\n$60 / 6 pounds = $10 per pound.\n\nSo, the average price should be $10 per pound, which is right in between $8 and $12. Therefore, it makes sense that an equal mixture of both types would achieve this average.\n\nThis confirms our earlier solution.\n\nAnother way to look at it is using the concept of weighted averages. The difference between the average price and the price of each type can tell us the ratio in which they should be mixed.\n\nThe difference for Type A: $10 - $8 = $2\n\nThe difference for Type B: $12 - $10 = $2\n\nSo, the differences are equal, which again suggests that the mixture should be in a 1:1 ratio, meaning equal pounds of each type.\n\nThis aligns with our previous conclusions.\n\nTherefore, the customer should purchase 3 pounds of Type A and 3 pounds of Type B candy to meet the total weight and cost requirements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ pounds of Type A and } 3 \\text{ pounds of Type B}} \\]"
