        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about a university planning to upgrade its on-campus housing facilities. They've got a budget of $8 million for this project, and they're planning to renovate three dormitory buildings: Building A with 100 rooms, Building B with 150 rooms, and Building C with 200 rooms. The plan is to allocate 25% of the budget to Building A, 35% to Building B, and 40% to Building C. I need to calculate the individual budgets for each building's renovation and then estimate the average cost per room for renovations.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how much money is allocated to each building based on the percentages given.\n\nStarting with Building A:\n\nBudget for Building A = 25% of $8,000,000\n\nTo calculate 25% of $8,000,000, I can multiply 8,000,000 by 0.25.\n\nSo, 8,000,000 * 0.25 = 2,000,000\n\nTherefore, Building A gets $2,000,000.\n\nNext, Building B:\n\nBudget for Building B = 35% of $8,000,000\n\nSimilarly, 8,000,000 * 0.35 = 2,800,000\n\nSo, Building B gets $2,800,000.\n\nNow, Building C:\n\nBudget for Building C = 40% of $8,000,000\n\n8,000,000 * 0.40 = 3,200,000\n\nTherefore, Building C gets $3,200,000.\n\nNow, to check if these additions up to the total budget:\n\n2,000,000 + 2,800,000 + 3,200,000 = 8,000,000\n\nYes, that matches the total budget of $8,000,000.\n\nNext, I need to estimate the average cost per room for renovations in each building.\n\nStarting with Building A:\n\nBuilding A has 100 rooms and a budget of $2,000,000.\n\nAverage cost per room for Building A = 2,000,000 / 100 = $20,000 per room\n\nNow, Building B:\n\nBuilding B has 150 rooms and a budget of $2,800,000.\n\nAverage cost per room for Building B = 2,800,000 / 150\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n2,800,000 divided by 150.\n\nFirst, 150 times 18,000 is 2,700,000\n\nSubtract that from 2,800,000, which leaves 100,000\n\n150 times 666.67 is approximately 100,000\n\nSo, 18,000 + 666.67 \u2248 18,666.67\n\nTherefore, approximately $18,666.67 per room\n\nAlternatively, for more precision:\n\n2,800,000 \u00f7 150 = 18,666.666...\n\nSo, approximately $18,666.67 per room\n\nNow, Building C:\n\nBuilding C has 200 rooms and a budget of $3,200,000.\n\nAverage cost per room for Building C = 3,200,000 / 200 = $16,000 per room\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Building A: $20,000 per room\n\n- Building B: $18,666.67 per room\n\n- Building C: $16,000 per room\n\nNow, if the question is asking for the average cost per room across all buildings, I need to calculate the total cost divided by the total number of rooms.\n\nTotal cost is $8,000,000\n\nTotal number of rooms is 100 + 150 + 200 = 450 rooms\n\nAverage cost per room = 8,000,000 / 450\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n8,000,000 \u00f7 450\n\n450 times 17,777.777... is 8,000,000\n\nSo, approximately $17,777.78 per room\n\nTherefore, the average cost per room for renovations across all buildings is approximately $17,777.78.\n\nBut, to be precise:\n\n8,000,000 divided by 450 is exactly 17,777.777...\n\nRounded to two decimal places, it's $17,777.78\n\nSo, that's the overall average cost per room.\n\nBut, the question seems to be asking for the average cost per room for renovations, and it might be referring to each building individually or overall. Given that it asks for \"the average cost per room,\" without specifying, I think it's safe to provide both the individual averages and the overall average.\n\nAlternatively, if it's to provide a single average cost per room, then the overall average would be appropriate.\n\nBut, to be thorough, I'll consider both.\n\nFirst, individual averages:\n\n- Building A: $20,000 per room\n\n- Building B: $18,666.67 per room\n\n- Building C: $16,000 per room\n\nNow, overall average:\n\n- $17,777.78 per room\n\nAlternatively, if the question is asking for the average cost per room across all renovations, then $17,777.78 is the figure to report.\n\nBut, to ensure I'm answering correctly, I should consider the context.\n\nThe question says: \"Estimate the average cost per room for renovations and provide step-by-step reasoning.\"\n\nGiven that, I think the overall average is what's being asked for.\n\nTherefore, the average cost per room for renovations across all buildings is approximately $17,777.78.\n\nHowever, to provide more insight, I can also calculate the weighted average, considering the number of rooms in each building.\n\nBut since the allocations are already based on percentages that lead to the individual budgets, and I've calculated the overall average by dividing the total budget by the total number of rooms, that should suffice.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should verify if the percentages given for budget allocation are proportional to the number of rooms.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nBuilding A: 100 rooms\n\nBuilding B: 150 rooms\n\nBuilding C: 200 rooms\n\nTotal rooms: 450\n\nPercentage of rooms:\n\n- Building A: 100/450 \u2248 22.22%\n\n- Building B: 150/450 \u2248 33.33%\n\n- Building C: 200/450 \u2248 44.44%\n\nBut the budget allocations are:\n\n- Building A: 25%\n\n- Building B: 35%\n\n- Building C: 40%\n\nSo, the budget allocations are not exactly proportional to the number of rooms.\n\nBuilding A has 22.22% of the rooms but gets 25% of the budget.\n\nBuilding B has 33.33% of the rooms but gets 35% of the budget.\n\nBuilding C has 44.44% of the rooms but gets 40% of the budget.\n\nSo, the allocations are similar but not exactly proportional.\n\nTherefore, the average cost per room will reflect these allocation differences.\n\nGiven that, the individual averages per room are as calculated earlier.\n\nBut the overall average is still $17,777.78 per room.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is asking for the average cost per room across all renovations, then $17,777.78 is the figure to report.\n\nHowever, perhaps the question is asking for the average cost per room based on the individual allocations.\n\nIn that case, perhaps I should calculate the weighted average based on the number of rooms.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nWeighted average cost per room = (Sum of (individual budget / individual number of rooms) * number of rooms) / total number of rooms\n\nWait, that would just be the same as total budget divided by total number of rooms, which is what I already calculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the total cost divided by total number of rooms, which is what I did.\n\nSo, $17,777.78 per room.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to consider the total cost and total rooms.\n\nTotal cost: $8,000,000\n\nTotal rooms: 450\n\nAverage cost per room: 8,000,000 / 450 = $17,777.78\n\nTherefore, the average cost per room for renovations is approximately $17,777.78.\n\nHence, the final answer is approximately $17,777.78 per room.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{17777.78}\\]"
