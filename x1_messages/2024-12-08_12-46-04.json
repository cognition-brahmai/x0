        "content": "I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. So, there are 12 marbles in a bag: 3 red, 4 green, and 5 blue. I need to find the probability of picking one marble of each color when I draw 3 marbles at random without replacement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I pick a marble, it stays out of the bag, so the total number of marbles decreases with each draw.\n\nNow, the total number of ways to pick 3 marbles out of 12 is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 marbles from 12 is C(12, 3).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(12, 3) = 12! / (3!(12 - 3)!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 220.\n\nSo, there are 220 possible ways to choose any 3 marbles from the bag.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to pick one marble of each color. That means one red, one green, and one blue.\n\nLet's find the number of ways to pick one red marble from the 3 available. That's C(3, 1) = 3.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to pick one green marble from the 4 available is C(4, 1) = 4.\n\nAnd the number of ways to pick one blue marble from the 5 available is C(5, 1) = 5.\n\nSince these are independent choices, the total number of ways to pick one of each color is the product of these individual choices.\n\nSo, total favorable outcomes = 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 5 = 60.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nTherefore, probability = 60 / 220.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction.\n\nBoth numerator and denominator can be divided by 20.\n\n60 \u00f7 20 = 3\n\n220 \u00f7 20 = 11\n\nSo, the probability is 3/11.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the problem step by step, considering the draws one at a time.\n\nFirst draw: The probability of picking any color is fine, but I need to ensure that the next picks are different colors.\n\nBut I think the combination approach is more straightforward for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to consider the total number of ways to arrange 3 marbles of different colors and divide by the total number of ways to arrange any 3 marbles.\n\nBut I think I've already got the right answer with the combination approach.\n\nSo, the probability should be 3/11.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to confirm this.\n\nSuppose I consider the hypergeometric distribution, which deals with sampling without replacement.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = [C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (12 marbles)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (but in this case, it's a bit different because we have three categories)\n\n- n is the number of draws (3 marbles)\n\n- k is the number of observed successes\n\nBut since there are three colors, I need to adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to stick with the initial approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nThe probability of picking one of each color is equivalent to picking one red, one green, and one blue.\n\nSo, P = (number of ways to pick one red, one green, and one blue) / (total number of ways to pick any 3 marbles)\n\nWhich is what I calculated earlier: 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 5 / C(12, 3) = 60 / 220 = 3/11.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to consider the\u987a\u5e8f of drawing the marbles.\n\nFor example, the probability of first drawing a red, then a green, then a blue.\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter, I need to consider all possible orders: RGB, RBG, GRB, GBR, BRG, BGR.\n\nEach of these orders has the same probability.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for one order and then multiply by the number of orders.\n\nTake, for example, RGB:\n\nP(Red first) = 3/12\n\nThen, P(Green second | Red first) = 4/11 (since one marble is already picked)\n\nThen, P(Blue third | Red and Green picked) = 5/10\n\nSo, P(RGB) = (3/12) \u00d7 (4/11) \u00d7 (5/10) = (3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 5) / (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10) = 60 / 1320 = 1/22.\n\nSimilarly, each of the other orders has the same probability of 1/22.\n\nSince there are 6 possible orders, total probability is 6 \u00d7 (1/22) = 6/22 = 3/11.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 3/11.\n\nSo, the final answer is 3/11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{11}} \\]"
