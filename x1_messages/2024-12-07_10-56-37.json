        "content": "So, we've got this problem here about a tree that's growing at a rate of 1.5 feet per year, and it starts off as a sapling that's 3 feet tall. We need to figure out how tall it will be after 10 years. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have an initial height of 3 feet, and the tree grows 1.5 feet each year. We want to know the height after 10 years. This seems like a straightforward growth problem where we can calculate the total growth over 10 years and then add that to the initial height.\n\nSo, the growth per year is 1.5 feet. Over 10 years, the total growth would be 1.5 feet/year times 10 years. Let me do that calculation:\n\n1.5 feet/year * 10 years = 15 feet\n\nOkay, so the tree will grow 15 feet over 10 years. Now, we need to add that to the initial height of 3 feet:\n\n3 feet + 15 feet = 18 feet\n\nSo, after 10 years, the tree should be 18 feet tall.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider here? Is the growth rate constant every year, or is there any possibility of it changing over time? The problem says the tree grows at a rate of 1.5 feet per year, which suggests a constant growth rate. So, I think it's fine to assume that it grows 1.5 feet each year without any variations.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The growth rate is given in feet per year, and the initial height is in feet, so everything matches up nicely.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations just to be sure. Starting height: 3 feet. Growth per year: 1.5 feet. Over 10 years, total growth: 1.5 * 10 = 15 feet. Total height after 10 years: 3 + 15 = 18 feet. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using a formula for linear growth. I recall that in linear growth, the final amount can be calculated using the formula:\n\nFinal amount = initial amount + (growth rate * time)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nFinal height = 3 feet + (1.5 feet/year * 10 years) = 3 + 15 = 18 feet\n\nSame answer as before. Good, it confirms that my first approach was correct.\n\nLet's consider if there's any other aspect to this problem. For example, is there such a thing as a tree growing exactly 1.5 feet every year without fail? In reality, tree growth can be affected by various factors like weather, soil quality, and environmental conditions, but since the problem states a constant growth rate, I think it's safe to ignore those variables.\n\nAnother thing to consider is units of measurement. The problem uses feet and years, and I've kept the units consistent throughout my calculations. But just to be thorough, if the problem had mentioned different units, I would need to convert them accordingly. In this case, no conversion is needed.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The problem is straightforward, and my calculations seem correct. The tree will be 18 feet tall after 10 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
