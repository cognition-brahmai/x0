        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 1200 widgets per hour and operates for 16 hours each day. It works 5 days a week. I need to find out how many widgets it produces in a week.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how many widgets are produced in one day. Since it produces 1200 widgets per hour and operates for 16 hours, I can multiply these two numbers to get the daily production.\n\nSo, 1200 widgets/hour * 16 hours/day = 19,200 widgets per day.\n\nNow, to find out the weekly production, I need to multiply the daily production by the number of days it operates in a week, which is 5.\n\nSo, 19,200 widgets/day * 5 days/week = 96,000 widgets per week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's an easier way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total number of hours the factory operates in a week and then multiply that by the hourly production rate.\n\nFirst, find the total operating hours per week: 16 hours/day * 5 days/week = 80 hours/week.\n\nThen, multiply that by the production rate: 1200 widgets/hour * 80 hours/week = 96,000 widgets per week.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, which is 96,000 widgets per week.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any downtime or breaks in the 16-hour operation? The problem doesn't mention any, so I'll assume that the factory is running continuously for those 16 hours each day.\n\nAlso, it specifies that it operates 5 days a week, so I don't need to account for weekends or holidays in this calculation.\n\nSo, my final answer is 96,000 widgets per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{96000} \\]"
