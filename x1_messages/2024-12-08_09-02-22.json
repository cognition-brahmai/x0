        "content": "I'm here to help you understand the Black-Scholes option pricing formula. It's a cornerstone in financial mathematics used to determine the theoretical price of European-style options. The formula was developed by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes in 1973 and is based on the principles of stochastic calculus and partial differential equations. Let's dive into the derivation step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Assumptions of the Black-Scholes Model\n\nBefore we begin, it's crucial to understand the assumptions that underpin the Black-Scholes model:\n\n1. **European Option:** The option can only be exercised at expiration.\n2. **No Dividends:** The underlying asset does not pay dividends during the life of the option.\n3. **Constant Volatility:** The volatility of the underlying asset is constant over the life of the option.\n4. **Risk-Free Interest Rate:** The risk-free interest rate is constant and known.\n5. **No Transaction Costs or Taxes:** There are no costs associated with buying or selling the underlying asset or the option.\n6. **Markets are Efficient:** There are no arbitrage opportunities.\n\nThese assumptions simplify the model but may not hold true in real-world scenarios. Despite this, the Black-Scholes model remains a valuable tool for option pricing.\n\n### Step 2: The Underlying Asset Price Dynamics\n\nThe price of the underlying asset, \\( S_t \\), is assumed to follow a geometric Brownian motion:\n\n\\[\ndS_t = \\mu S_t dt + \\sigma S_t dW_t\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the expected return of the underlying asset.\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the volatility of the underlying asset.\n- \\( W_t \\) is a standard Brownian motion.\n\nThis stochastic differential equation implies that the logarithm of the asset price follows a Brownian motion with drift.\n\n### Step 3: Portfolio Construction\n\nTo derive the Black-Scholes equation, we construct a riskless portfolio consisting of the option and the underlying asset. Let \\( V(S_t, t) \\) be the value of the option at time \\( t \\).\n\nConsider a portfolio \\( \\Pi \\) that holds one option and short \\( \\Delta \\) units of the underlying asset:\n\n\\[\n\\Pi = V - \\Delta S_t\n\\]\n\nThe goal is to choose \\( \\Delta \\) such that the portfolio is riskless, meaning its value doesn't change due to small changes in \\( S_t \\).\n\n### Step 4: Applying Ito's Lemma\n\nTo find how \\( V \\) changes with time and the underlying asset price, we apply Ito's lemma to \\( V(S_t, t) \\):\n\n\\[\ndV = \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\mu S_t \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 S_t^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} \\right) dt + \\sigma S_t \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} dW_t\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Making the Portfolio Riskless\n\nThe portfolio \\( \\Pi \\) should be riskless, meaning its change should only be due to the risk-free interest rate. Therefore, the stochastic term in \\( d\\Pi \\) should be zero.\n\nCompute \\( d\\Pi \\):\n\n\\[\nd\\Pi = dV - \\Delta dS_t\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( dV \\) and \\( dS_t \\):\n\n\\[\nd\\Pi = \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\mu S_t \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 S_t^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} \\right) dt + \\sigma S_t \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} dW_t - \\Delta (\\mu S_t dt + \\sigma S_t dW_t)\n\\]\n\nFor the portfolio to be riskless, the coefficient of \\( dW_t \\) must be zero:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma S_t \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} - \\Delta \\sigma S_t = 0 \\implies \\Delta = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Deriving the Black-Scholes PDE\n\nWith \\( \\Delta = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} \\), the change in the portfolio value is:\n\n\\[\nd\\Pi = \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\mu S_t \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 S_t^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} - \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} (\\mu S_t dt) \\right) dt = \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 S_t^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} \\right) dt\n\\]\n\nSince the portfolio is riskless, its return should equal the risk-free rate:\n\n\\[\nd\\Pi = r \\Pi dt = r \\left( V - \\Delta S_t \\right) dt = r \\left( V - \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} S_t \\right) dt\n\\]\n\nEquating the two expressions for \\( d\\Pi \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 S_t^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} = r \\left( V - \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} S_t \\right)\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms, we obtain the Black-Scholes partial differential equation (PDE):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 S_t^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} + r S_t \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} - r V = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Solving the Black-Scholes PDE for a European Call Option\n\nTo find the price of a European call option, we need to solve the Black-Scholes PDE with the appropriate boundary conditions. The payoff of a European call option at expiration \\( T \\) is:\n\n\\[\nV(S_T, T) = \\max(S_T - K, 0)\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( K \\) is the strike price.\n\nTo solve the PDE, we use a change of variables and properties of the heat equation. The solution is:\n\n\\[\nC(S_t, t) = S_t N(d_1) - K e^{-r(T - t)} N(d_2)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n\\[\nd_1 = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{S_t}{K}\\right) + \\left( r + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} \\right)(T - t)}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T - t}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd_2 = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T - t}\n\\]\n\nAnd \\( N(x) \\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\n\n### Step 8: Explanation of the Solution\n\n- **\\( S_t N(d_1) \\):** This term represents the discounted expected value of the stock price at expiration, adjusted for the probability that the option will be exercised.\n  \n- **\\( K e^{-r(T - t)} N(d_2) \\):** This term represents the present value of the strike price, adjusted for the probability that the option will be exercised.\n\nThe variables \\( d_1 \\) and \\( d_2 \\) capture the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the underlying asset price and time to expiration, respectively.\n\n### Step 9: Black-Scholes Formula for a European Put Option\n\nSimilarly, the price of a European put option can be derived using the put-call parity relationship:\n\n\\[\nP(S_t, t) = C(S_t, t) - S_t + K e^{-r(T - t)}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the call option price:\n\n\\[\nP(S_t, t) = S_t N(d_1) - K e^{-r(T - t)} N(d_2) - S_t + K e^{-r(T - t)} = -S_t (1 - N(d_1)) + K e^{-r(T - t)} (1 - N(d_2))\n\\]\n\nUsing the property \\( N(-x) = 1 - N(x) \\):\n\n\\[\nP(S_t, t) = S_t N(-d_1) - K e^{-r(T - t)} N(-d_2)\n\\]\n\n### Step 10: Conclusion\n\nThe Black-Scholes formula provides a theoretical estimate of the price of European options, assuming constant volatility and interest rates, no dividends, and efficient markets. While these assumptions may not hold in reality, the model remains widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness as a starting point for more complex models.\n\nUnderstanding the derivation not only provides insight into the formula but also into the principles of financial derivatives and stochastic calculus.\n\n### Final Black-Scholes Formula for a European Call Option\n\n\\[\nC(S_t, t) = S_t N(d_1) - K e^{-r(T - t)} N(d_2)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n\\[\nd_1 = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{S_t}{K}\\right) + \\left( r + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} \\right)(T - t)}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T - t}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd_2 = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T - t}\n\\]\n\nAnd \\( N(x) \\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution."
