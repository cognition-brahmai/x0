        "content": "To create a Java program that reads a text file containing lines of space-separated integers, computes the sum of the integers in each line, and prints the sums, while also handling cases where the file does not exist or contains invalid data, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import necessary classes**: You'll need classes for file handling, reading lines from the file, and handling exceptions.\n\n2. **Read the file**: Use a `BufferedReader` to read the file line by line.\n\n3. **Parse and sum integers**: For each line, split the line into strings based on spaces, parse each string to an integer, and compute the sum.\n\n4. **Handle exceptions**: Catch and handle exceptions for file not found and invalid data.\n\nHere's a sample implementation:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class SumLines {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String fileName = \"input.txt\"; // Specify your file name here\n\n        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {\n            String line;\n            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n                try {\n                    String[] parts = line.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n                    int sum = 0;\n                    for (String part : parts) {\n                        sum += Integer.parseInt(part);\n                    }\n                    System.out.println(\"Sum: \" + sum);\n                } catch (NumberFormatException e) {\n                    System.err.println(\"Invalid data in line: \" + line);\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            System.err.println(\"Error reading the file: \" + e.getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Import Statements**:\n   - `BufferedReader` and `FileReader` for reading the file.\n   - `IOException` for handling file reading exceptions.\n   - `NumberFormatException` for handling invalid integer data.\n\n2. **Reading the File**:\n   - `BufferedReader` is used to read the file line by line efficiently.\n   - `FileReader` is used to connect to the specified file.\n\n3. **Processing Each Line**:\n   - Each line is split into parts using `split(\"\\\\s+\")`, which splits on one or more whitespace characters.\n   - Each part is parsed to an integer using `Integer.parseInt()`.\n   - The sum of integers in the line is computed and printed.\n\n4. **Exception Handling**:\n   - `NumberFormatException` is caught and handled if a line contains non-integer data.\n   - `IOException` is caught and handled if there is an error reading the file, such as if the file does not exist.\n\nThis program ensures that it handles both file reading errors and data parsing errors gracefully, providing feedback for each type of issue encountered."
