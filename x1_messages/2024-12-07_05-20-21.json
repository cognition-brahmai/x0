        "content": "Let's see. So, the train goes from Town A to Town B, which is 180 miles apart, at a constant speed of 60 mph. It stops for 20 minutes halfway through the journey. I need to find the average speed for the entire trip.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how long the journey takes without the stop. If the distance is 180 miles and the speed is 60 mph, then time equals distance divided by speed. So, time = 180 miles / 60 mph = 3 hours.\n\nBut there's a stop halfway through the journey. Halfway would be at 90 miles, since 180 miles divided by 2 is 90 miles.\n\nThe train stops for 20 minutes at the halfway point. I need to convert that to hours because the speed is in miles per hour. 20 minutes is 20/60 = 1/3 of an hour.\n\nSo, the total time for the trip is the time to travel 180 miles plus the stop time. That's 3 hours + 1/3 hour = 3 1/3 hours.\n\nNow, average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, average speed = 180 miles / (3 1/3 hours).\n\nBut 3 1/3 hours is the same as 10/3 hours (since 3 = 9/3, and 9/3 + 1/3 = 10/3).\n\nSo, average speed = 180 miles / (10/3 hours) = 180 * 3/10 = 540/10 = 54 mph.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it in two parts: the first half and the second half.\n\nFirst half: 90 miles at 60 mph, so time = 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.\n\nThen, stop for 20 minutes, which is 1/3 hour.\n\nThen, second half: another 90 miles at 60 mph, so another 1.5 hours.\n\nTotal time = 1.5 hours + 1/3 hour + 1.5 hours.\n\nLet's add that up: 1.5 + 0.333... + 1.5 = 3.333... hours, which is 10/3 hours.\n\nTotal distance is 180 miles.\n\nSo, average speed = total distance / total time = 180 / (10/3) = 180 * 3/10 = 540/10 = 54 mph.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of average velocity over the entire trip.\n\nBut I think the method I used is correct. The train travels at a constant speed, but the stop adds extra time to the journey, which lowers the average speed.\n\nSo, the average speed for the entire trip is 54 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{54 \\text{ mph}} \\]"
