        "content": "I've got this problem here: there are 50 red balls and 50 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 100 balls. I need to draw two balls without looking and find out the probability that both balls are the same color. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is the chance of something happening, and it's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are the scenarios where both balls are either red or both are blue.\n\nSo, total number of ways to draw two balls from 100 balls. That sounds like a combination problem because the order in which I draw the balls doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nHere, n = 100 and k = 2.\n\nSo, total number of ways to choose 2 balls from 100 is C(100, 2).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(100, 2) = 100! / (2!(100 - 2)!) = (100 \u00d7 99) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 4950.\n\nSo, there are 4950 possible ways to draw two balls from the bag.\n\nNow, favorable outcomes are when both balls are red or both are blue.\n\nLet's find the number of ways to draw two red balls.\n\nThere are 50 red balls, so number of ways to choose 2 red balls is C(50, 2).\n\nSimilarly, number of ways to choose 2 blue balls is C(50, 2).\n\nSo, total favorable outcomes = C(50, 2) + C(50, 2).\n\nLet me calculate C(50, 2):\n\nC(50, 2) = 50! / (2!(50 - 2)!) = (50 \u00d7 49) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 1225.\n\nSo, both for red and blue, it's 1225 each.\n\nTherefore, total favorable outcomes = 1225 + 1225 = 2450.\n\nNow, probability = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 2450 / 4950.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction.\n\nBoth numerator and denominator can be divided by 50.\n\n2450 \u00f7 50 = 49\n\n4950 \u00f7 50 = 99\n\nSo, probability = 49/99.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense?\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it step by step.\n\nFirst, I draw one ball. Doesn't matter what color it is, since I'm interested in the second ball matching the first one.\n\nSo, let's say the first ball is red. The probability of drawing a red ball first is 50/100 = 1/2.\n\nGiven that the first ball is red, the probability that the second ball is also red is 49/99, because there are now 49 red balls left out of 99 total balls.\n\nSo, probability of both balls being red is (50/100) \u00d7 (49/99).\n\nSimilarly, if the first ball is blue, probability is also (50/100) \u00d7 (49/99).\n\nSince these are mutually exclusive events (either first ball is red or blue), I can add them up.\n\nSo, total probability = (50/100 \u00d7 49/99) + (50/100 \u00d7 49/99) = 2 \u00d7 (50/100 \u00d7 49/99).\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n= 2 \u00d7 (1/2 \u00d7 49/99) = 2 \u00d7 (49/198) = 98/198 = 49/99.\n\nSo, same answer as before: 49/99.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of combinations.\n\nTotal ways to choose 2 balls: C(100, 2) = 4950.\n\nWays to choose 2 red balls: C(50, 2) = 1225.\n\nWays to choose 2 blue balls: C(50, 2) = 1225.\n\nTotal favorable ways: 1225 + 1225 = 2450.\n\nProbability: 2450 / 4950 = 49/99.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent.\n\nIs there another way to approach this to confirm?\n\nMaybe using probabilities directly.\n\nProbability that the first ball is red: 50/100 = 1/2.\n\nGiven that the first ball is red, probability that the second ball is also red: 49/99.\n\nSo, probability both are red: (1/2) \u00d7 (49/99).\n\nSimilarly, probability both are blue: (1/2) \u00d7 (49/99).\n\nTotal probability both are same color: 2 \u00d7 (1/2 \u00d7 49/99) = 49/99.\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, consider that after drawing the first ball, there are 99 balls left, with 49 of the same color as the first ball (since there were 50 of each to start with, and one has been removed).\n\nSo, probability that the second ball matches the first in color is 49/99.\n\nThat's a simpler way to think about it, and it gives the same answer.\n\nSo, all methods point to 49/99.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this?\n\nSuppose I consider the probability that the two balls are different colors and subtract that from 1.\n\nProbability that the first ball is red: 1/2.\n\nGiven that, probability second ball is blue: 50/99.\n\nSimilarly, probability first ball is blue: 1/2.\n\nGiven that, probability second ball is red: 50/99.\n\nSo, total probability that the balls are different colors: (1/2 \u00d7 50/99) + (1/2 \u00d7 50/99) = 2 \u00d7 (1/2 \u00d7 50/99) = 50/99.\n\nTherefore, probability that both balls are the same color: 1 - 50/99 = 49/99.\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nThis reinforces confidence in the result.\n\nAlternatively, using combinations:\n\nTotal ways to choose 2 balls of same color: 2 \u00d7 C(50, 2) = 2 \u00d7 1225 = 2450.\n\nTotal ways to choose any 2 balls: C(100, 2) = 4950.\n\nProbability: 2450 / 4950 = 49/99.\n\nConsistent again.\n\nI think it's clear that the probability is 49/99.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any chance of error in this approach.\n\nOne potential source of error could be if the draws are with replacement, but in this problem, it's specified \"without looking,\" which typically implies without replacement.\n\nIf it were with replacement, then the probabilities would be different.\n\nLet's quickly calculate that to see the difference.\n\nIf draws are with replacement, then:\n\nProbability first ball is red: 50/100 = 1/2.\n\nProbability second ball is red: still 50/100 = 1/2.\n\nSo, probability both are red: (1/2) \u00d7 (1/2) = 1/4.\n\nSimilarly, probability both are blue: 1/4.\n\nTotal probability both are same color: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.\n\nSo, in that case, it would be 1/2.\n\nBut in our problem, it's without replacement, so the correct answer is 49/99.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that in without replacement, the probabilities are slightly different because the total number of balls decreases by one after the first draw.\n\nBut in this symmetric case where there are equal numbers of each color, the calculation works out as above.\n\nI think I've covered all the possible angles here, and all methods confirm that the probability is 49/99.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{49}{99}} \\]"
