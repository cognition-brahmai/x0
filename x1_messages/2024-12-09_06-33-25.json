        "content": "So there's this problem about population growth. Let's see: there are 8 million people in a city, and the population increases by 2% every year. We need to find out how many people will live there after 5 years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 2% increase means. Percentage increase is a way to express how much something grows in relation to its original amount. So, if something increases by 2%, it means it grows by 2% of its current value each year.\n\nLet's denote the initial population as P\u2080, which is 8,000,000 people. The growth rate is 2% per year, and we want to find the population after 5 years, which I'll call P\u2085.\n\nOne way to approach this is to calculate the population incrementally for each year. So, each year, the population increases by 2% of the previous year's population.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with year 0: P\u2080 = 8,000,000\n\nYear 1: P\u2081 = P\u2080 + 0.02 * P\u2080 = P\u2080 * (1 + 0.02) = 8,000,000 * 1.02\n\nLet me calculate that: 8,000,000 * 1.02 = 8,160,000\n\nYear 2: P\u2082 = P\u2081 * 1.02 = 8,160,000 * 1.02\n\nCalculating: 8,160,000 * 1.02 = 8,323,200\n\nYear 3: P\u2083 = P\u2082 * 1.02 = 8,323,200 * 1.02\n\nCalculating: 8,323,200 * 1.02 = 8,489,664\n\nYear 4: P\u2084 = P\u2083 * 1.02 = 8,489,664 * 1.02\n\nCalculating: 8,489,664 * 1.02 = 8,659,457.28\n\nYear 5: P\u2085 = P\u2084 * 1.02 = 8,659,457.28 * 1.02\n\nCalculating: 8,659,457.28 * 1.02 = 8,832,646.4256\n\nSo, after 5 years, the population would be approximately 8,832,646 people.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a better way to calculate this without doing it year by year. I recall that population growth can be modeled using the formula for exponential growth.\n\nThe general formula for exponential growth is:\n\nP\u209c = P\u2080 * (1 + r)^t\n\nWhere:\n\n- P\u209c is the population after time t\n\n- P\u2080 is the initial population\n\n- r is the growth rate\n\n- t is the time in years\n\nIn this case, P\u2080 = 8,000,000, r = 0.02, and t = 5.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nP\u2085 = 8,000,000 * (1 + 0.02)^5\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.02)^5:\n\n1.02^5\n\nI can calculate this step by step:\n\n1.02^1 = 1.02\n\n1.02^2 = 1.02 * 1.02 = 1.0404\n\n1.02^3 = 1.0404 * 1.02 = 1.061208\n\n1.02^4 = 1.061208 * 1.02 = 1.08243216\n\n1.02^5 = 1.08243216 * 1.02 = 1.1040808032\n\nNow, multiply this by the initial population:\n\nP\u2085 = 8,000,000 * 1.1040808032 = 8,832,646.4256\n\nSo, again, we get approximately 8,832,646 people.\n\nThis matches the result I got from calculating year by year, which is a good sign.\n\nBut let's double-check the calculations to be sure.\n\nStarting with the exponential growth formula:\n\nP\u2085 = P\u2080 * (1 + r)^t\n\nP\u2085 = 8,000,000 * (1.02)^5\n\nFirst, calculate 1.02^5.\n\nUsing a calculator, 1.02^5 = 1.1040808032.\n\nThen, 8,000,000 * 1.1040808032 = 8,832,646.4256.\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, since population must be an integer, we get 8,832,646.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that population can't be a fraction, we might round down to 8,832,646.\n\nBut in population studies, it's common to round to the nearest whole number.\n\nSo, the final population after 5 years would be approximately 8,832,646 people.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation.\n\nThe problem states that the population increases by 2% every year, with no mention of immigration, emigration, or other factors affecting the population. So, I'll assume that the only change in population is due to this annual growth rate.\n\nAlso, the growth rate is compounded annually, meaning that each year's growth is based on the previous year's population.\n\nTherefore, the exponential growth formula is appropriate here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula for compound interest, since it's similar to compounded growth.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is:\n\nA = P * (1 + r/n)^(n*t)\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this case, since the population grows annually at a rate of 2%, and it's compounded once per year, n = 1.\n\nSo, the formula simplifies to:\n\nA = P * (1 + r)^t\n\nWhich is the same as the exponential growth formula I used earlier.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the exponential growth formula is the correct approach.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using logarithms or other methods, but I think the exponential growth formula is the most straightforward and appropriate method.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's verify the calculation again.\n\nCalculate 1.02^5:\n\n1.02^1 = 1.02\n\n1.02^2 = 1.02 * 1.02 = 1.0404\n\n1.02^3 = 1.0404 * 1.02 = 1.061208\n\n1.02^4 = 1.061208 * 1.02 = 1.08243216\n\n1.02^5 = 1.08243216 * 1.02 = 1.1040808032\n\nNow, multiply by the initial population:\n\n8,000,000 * 1.1040808032 = 8,832,646.4256\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number: 8,832,646\n\nSo, the population after 5 years will be approximately 8,832,646 people.\n\nAlternatively, if we don't round intermediate steps and carry more decimal places, the result might be slightly different, but it should be very close to this number.\n\nLet me consider if the problem expects a different approach, perhaps using linear approximation or differential equations, but given that it's a straightforward percentage increase per year, the exponential growth formula is sufficient.\n\nAlso, since the growth rate is relatively small (2% per year), and the time period is short (5 years), there shouldn't be a significant difference between using the exponential growth formula and other more complex methods.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is approximately 8,832,646 people.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"8 million people,\" and the answer I got is 8,832,646. That's an increase of about 10.4%, which seems consistent with a 2% annual increase over 5 years.\n\nTo confirm, let's calculate the total percentage increase:\n\n(8,832,646 - 8,000,000) / 8,000,000 * 100% = 832,646 / 8,000,000 * 100% = 10.408075%\n\nWhich is approximately equal to (1.02)^5 - 1 = 1.1040808032 - 1 = 0.1040808032, or 10.40808032%\n\nSo, it matches.\n\nAlternatively, we could use the rule of 70 to estimate the doubling time, but since we're only looking at a 5-year period, and the increase is relatively small, the exponential growth formula is more precise.\n\nIn conclusion, after 5 years, the population of the city will be approximately 8,832,646 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8832646} \\]"
