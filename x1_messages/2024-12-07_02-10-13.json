        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains here, one leaving Station A at 9 am going towards Station B, and the other leaving Station B at 11 am going towards Station A. The distance between the stations is 480 miles. I need to find out when these two trains will meet.\n\nFirst, I should note down the details:\n\n- Train from A: leaves at 9 am, speed 60 mph\n\n- Train from B: leaves at 11 am, speed 80 mph\n\n- Distance between A and B: 480 miles\n\nSince the trains are moving towards each other, their speeds will add up when calculating how quickly they approach each other. So, the relative speed is 60 mph + 80 mph = 140 mph.\n\nBut wait, the train from B leaves two hours after the train from A. So, between 9 am and 11 am, only the train from A is moving.\n\nLet me calculate how far the train from A has traveled in those two hours.\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time = 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nSo, by 11 am, the train from A has covered 120 miles, meaning the remaining distance between the two trains is 480 miles - 120 miles = 360 miles.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other starting at 11 am, with a combined speed of 140 mph.\n\nI need to find the time it takes for them to cover the remaining 360 miles at 140 mph.\n\nTime = distance / speed = 360 miles / 140 mph.\n\nLet me calculate that: 360 divided by 140 is 2.5714 hours.\n\nHmm, 2.5714 hours. That's 2 hours and approximately 34.29 minutes (since 0.5714 \u00d7 60 \u2248 34.29 minutes).\n\nSo, they will meet at 11 am plus 2 hours and 34 minutes, which would be around 1:34 pm.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nFirst, from 9 am to 11 am, it's 2 hours, during which only train A is moving, covering 120 miles.\n\nThen, from 11 am, both trains are moving towards each other at a combined speed of 140 mph, with 360 miles left between them.\n\nTime to meet: 360 miles / 140 mph = 2.5714 hours, which is 2 hours and 34 minutes.\n\nSo, 11 am + 2 hours 34 minutes = 1:34 pm.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1:34\\ \\text{pm}} \\]"
