        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this train that's traveling at different speeds for different periods of time, and I need to find out the total distance it covers. Okay, first, it travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for 4 hours. Then, it slows down to 40 miles per hour for the next 3 hours. I need to find the total distance traveled.\n\nI remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. So, for the first part, the distance should be 60 mph times 4 hours, and for the second part, it's 40 mph times 3 hours. Then, I just add those two distances together to get the total distance.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nDistance 1 = Speed 1 * Time 1\n\nDistance 2 = Speed 2 * Time 2\n\nTotal Distance = Distance 1 + Distance 2\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDistance 1 = 60 mph * 4 hours = 240 miles\n\nDistance 2 = 40 mph * 3 hours = 120 miles\n\nTotal Distance = 240 miles + 120 miles = 360 miles\n\nSo, the train has traveled a total of 360 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe by considering the average speed for the entire journey. Let's see.\n\nFirst, total time traveled is 4 hours + 3 hours = 7 hours.\n\nIf I try to find the average speed over the entire journey, it would be the total distance divided by the total time. But I don't know the total distance yet, that's what I'm trying to find.\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to stick with the initial approach of calculating each segment separately and then adding them up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the distance covered in each hour and then sum them up. But that seems more time-consuming.\n\nLet me check my initial calculation again.\n\nFirst segment: 60 mph for 4 hours: 60 * 4 = 240 miles.\n\nSecond segment: 40 mph for 3 hours: 40 * 3 = 120 miles.\n\nTotal distance: 240 + 120 = 360 miles.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in that calculation.\n\nMaybe I can consider if the train was slowing down gradually from 60 mph to 40 mph, but the problem says it travels at 60 mph for 4 hours, then slows down to 40 mph for the next 3 hours. So, it's two distinct segments with constant speeds.\n\nTherefore, the total distance is indeed 360 miles.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
