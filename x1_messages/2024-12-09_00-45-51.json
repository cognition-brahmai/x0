        "content": "Let's see. The factory normally produces 500 units per day. They're going to increase production by 20% each day for the next three days. So, I need to calculate the production for each of the four days and then add them up.\n\nFirst, day one is straightforward: 500 units.\n\nNow, for day two, they increase production by 20%. So, I need to calculate 20% of 500 and add that to the original 500 units.\n\n20% of 500 is 0.20 * 500 = 100 units.\n\nSo, day two production is 500 + 100 = 600 units.\n\nWait, but the problem says they increase production by 20% each day for the next three days. Does that mean each day's production is 20% more than the previous day's production?\n\nIf that's the case, then day two is 500 * 1.20 = 600 units.\n\nThen, day three would be 600 * 1.20 = 720 units.\n\nAnd day four would be 720 * 1.20 = 864 units.\n\nSo, total production over the four days would be day one plus day two plus day three plus day four.\n\nThat is: 500 + 600 + 720 + 864.\n\nLet me add those up.\n\n500 + 600 = 1100.\n\n1100 + 720 = 1820.\n\n1820 + 864 = 2684.\n\nSo, the total production over the four-day period is 2684 units.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if I interpreted the problem correctly.\n\nThe problem says they increase production by 20% each day for the next three days.\n\nSo, starting from day one: 500 units.\n\nDay two: 500 + 0.20*500 = 600 units.\n\nDay three: 600 + 0.20*600 = 720 units.\n\nDay four: 720 + 0.20*720 = 864 units.\n\nTotal: 500 + 600 + 720 + 864 = 2684 units.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as a geometric series, where each day's production is 1.20 times the previous day's production.\n\nSo, day one: 500.\n\nDay two: 500 * 1.20.\n\nDay three: 500 * (1.20)^2.\n\nDay four: 500 * (1.20)^3.\n\nTotal production: 500 + 500*1.20 + 500*(1.20)^2 + 500*(1.20)^3.\n\nFactor out 500: 500 * (1 + 1.20 + (1.20)^2 + (1.20)^3).\n\nCalculate the sum inside the parentheses: 1 + 1.20 = 2.20; 2.20 + 1.44 (which is 1.20 squared) = 3.64; 3.64 + 1.728 (which is 1.20 cubed) = 5.368.\n\nSo, total production: 500 * 5.368 = 2684 units.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nWait, but is there a formula for the sum of a geometric series?\n\nYes, the sum S of the first n terms of a geometric series is S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, a = 500, r = 1.20, n = 4.\n\nSo, S = 500 * (1 - (1.20)^4) / (1 - 1.20).\n\nCalculate (1.20)^4: 1.20 * 1.20 = 1.44; 1.44 * 1.20 = 1.728; 1.728 * 1.20 = 2.0736.\n\nSo, S = 500 * (1 - 2.0736) / (1 - 1.20) = 500 * (-1.0736) / (-0.20) = 500 * 5.368 = 2684 units.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think 2684 units is the correct total production over the four-day period.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2684} \\]"
