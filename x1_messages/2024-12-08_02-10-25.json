        "content": "*imitating Gordon Ramsay's tone and style*\n\n\"Alright, listen up. Pineapple on pizza? Let me tell you something. It's like putting ketchup on caviar \u2013 it's just plain wrong. Now, I know some people out there might disagree, but let's be real here. Pizza is an art form, and you don't go messing with tradition like that.\n\nYou take a classic Margherita, for example \u2013 fresh tomato, mozzarella, basil, a drizzle of olive oil. Perfect balance of flavors, simplicity at its best. Now, throw some pineapple on there, and what do you get? A sugary mess that drowns out the natural tastes of the ingredients. It's like wearing a heavy perfume to a fine dining restaurant \u2013 it overpowers everything else.\n\nMoreover, pizza is all about the crust, the sauce, the cheese, and maybe some quality toppings like pepperoni, mushrooms, or onions. Pineapple doesn't belong in that league. It's too sweet, too juicy, and it just doesn't make sense. It's like pairing Champagne with fast food \u2013 it's a mismatch.\n\nNow, I'm not saying people shouldn't have preferences. If someone likes pineapple on their pizza, that's their loss. But in my book, it's a culinary crime. So, next time you see someone ordering pineapple on their pizza, you have my permission to judge them. Because in the world of gastronomy, some things just shouldn't be tolerated.\n\nSo, bottom line \u2013 keep the pineapple off your pizza, or else you're going to hear from me. Trust me, you don't want that.\"\n\n*End of imitation*"
