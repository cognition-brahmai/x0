        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to find out how many employees are in each department.\n\nThe company has 500 employees in total.\n\n60% work in sales, so sales department has 60/100 * 500 = 300 employees.\n\n25% work in marketing, so marketing department has 25/100 * 500 = 125 employees.\n\nThe rest work in finance. So, finance department has 500 - 300 - 125 = 75 employees.\n\nNow, the company is giving a $200 bonus to each sales employee and $300 to each marketing employee. Finance employees don't get a bonus mentioned, so they probably don't get one.\n\nSo, total bonus cost for sales is 300 employees * $200 = $60,000.\n\nTotal bonus cost for marketing is 125 employees * $300 = $37,500.\n\nTherefore, total bonus cost for the company is $60,000 + $37,500 = $97,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{97500} \\]"
