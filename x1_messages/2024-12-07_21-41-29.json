        "content": "So I've got this problem about optimizing emergency room operations to reduce waiting times. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nFirst, the ER receives 300 patients per day, with a peak of 60 patients per hour during busy periods. Each patient needs an average of 30 minutes for treatment, and there are currently 20 treatment rooms available. The goal is to maintain a maximum waiting time of 15 minutes per patient during peak hours. I also need to consider the staffing requirements for any additional rooms, assuming one doctor and two nurses per room.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current situation during peak hours. There are 60 patients per hour, and each patient takes 30 minutes on average. So, in terms of treatment capacity, how many patients can be treated in an hour with the current 20 rooms?\n\nEach room can treat two patients per hour because each treatment takes 30 minutes. So, with 20 rooms, the total treatment capacity is 20 rooms * 2 patients per hour = 40 patients per hour.\n\nBut during peak hours, there are 60 patients per hour coming in. So, with only 40 patients being treated per hour, there's a shortfall of 20 patients per hour. These 20 patients would have to wait for treatment.\n\nNow, the waiting time depends on how long it takes for a room to become available. Since each treatment takes 30 minutes, a room becomes available every 30 minutes per patient. With 20 rooms, and each treating two patients per hour, the system can handle 40 patients per hour.\n\nBut we have 60 patients arriving per hour, so there's a queue building up. I need to find out how many additional rooms are needed to bring the waiting time down to a maximum of 15 minutes.\n\nLet me think about this in terms of queueing theory. In queueing theory, there's a formula to calculate waiting time based on arrival rate and service rate.\n\nThe arrival rate (\u03bb) is 60 patients per hour.\n\nThe service rate (\u03bc) per room is 2 patients per hour (since each treatment takes 30 minutes).\n\nWith n servers (rooms), the waiting time in the queue (Wq) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nWq = (\u03bb / (n * \u03bc - \u03bb)) * (1 / (n * \u03bc))\n\nBut I need to make sure that Wq is less than or equal to 15 minutes, which is 0.25 hours.\n\nSo, setting Wq \u2264 0.25 hours.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n(60 / (n * 2 - 60)) * (1 / (n * 2)) \u2264 0.25\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n(60 / (2n - 60)) * (1 / 2n) \u2264 0.25\n\nMultiply both sides by (2n - 60) and by 2n:\n\n60 \u2264 0.25 * (2n - 60) * 2n\n\nSimplify:\n\n60 \u2264 0.25 * (4n\u00b2 - 120n)\n\n60 \u2264 n\u00b2 - 30n\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nn\u00b2 - 30n - 60 \u2265 0\n\nNow, solve for n using the quadratic formula:\n\nn = [30 \u00b1 sqrt(900 + 240)] / 2\n\nn = [30 \u00b1 sqrt(1140)] / 2\n\nn = [30 \u00b1 33.76] / 2\n\nPossible solutions:\n\nn = (30 + 33.76)/2 = 31.88 \u2248 32 rooms\n\nn = (30 - 33.76)/2 = -1.88 (not feasible since number of rooms can't be negative)\n\nSo, n \u2265 32 rooms are needed to keep the waiting time \u2264 15 minutes.\n\nCurrently, there are 20 rooms, so the number of additional rooms needed is 32 - 20 = 12 rooms.\n\nBut let me verify this result because queueing theory can be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of utilization factor (\u03c1).\n\n\u03c1 = \u03bb / (n * \u03bc)\n\nFor a stable system, \u03c1 < 1.\n\nThe waiting time increases as \u03c1 approaches 1.\n\nI want to find n such that Wq \u2264 0.25 hours.\n\nFrom queueing theory, for M/M/n queue, the waiting time in the queue is:\n\nWq = (\u03bb / (n * \u03bc - \u03bb)) * (1 / (n * \u03bc))\n\nSet Wq \u2264 0.25:\n\n(60 / (2n - 60)) * (1 / (2n)) \u2264 0.25\n\nSimplify:\n\n60 / (2n - 60) * 1 / (2n) = 60 / (4n\u00b2 - 120n) \u2264 0.25\n\n60 \u2264 0.25 * (4n\u00b2 - 120n)\n\n60 \u2264 n\u00b2 - 30n\n\nn\u00b2 - 30n - 60 \u2265 0\n\nSolving n\u00b2 - 30n - 60 = 0 gives n \u2248 31.88 or n \u2248 -1.88\n\nSo, n \u2265 32 rooms.\n\nTherefore, additional rooms needed = 32 - 20 = 12 rooms.\n\nNow, considering staffing requirements:\n\nEach additional room requires one doctor and two nurses.\n\nSo, for 12 additional rooms:\n\n- Doctors: 12 additional doctors\n\n- Nurses: 24 additional nurses\n\nThis seems like a lot, but it's based on the initial assumption.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the utilization factor to see if this is efficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider the total treatment capacity needed.\n\nDuring peak hours, 60 patients per hour arrive, each needing 30 minutes of treatment.\n\nSo, total treatment time required per hour is 60 patients * 0.5 hours = 30 hours.\n\nEach room can provide 2 treatments per hour (since each treatment is 0.5 hours), so each room provides 2 treatments per hour.\n\nTo meet the demand, number of rooms needed = total treatment required per hour / treatment per room per hour = 60 patients per hour / 2 patients per room per hour = 30 rooms.\n\nBut according to my earlier calculation, it was 32 rooms.\n\nClose enough, maybe I can round to 30 rooms.\n\nSo, additional rooms needed = 30 - 20 = 10 rooms.\n\nWait, earlier calculation suggested 12 rooms, now it's 10 rooms.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nLet me check again.\n\nUsing the treatment demand approach:\n\n60 patients per hour * 0.5 hours per patient = 30 treatment hours needed per hour.\n\nEach room provides 2 treatments per hour (since each treatment is 0.5 hours).\n\nSo, number of rooms required = 30 treatment hours per hour / 2 treatments per room per hour = 15 rooms.\n\nBut currently, there are 20 rooms, which is more than 15 rooms.\n\nWait, this can't be right.\n\nIf 20 rooms can handle 40 patients per hour, but only 60 patients are arriving per hour, which requires 30 treatment hours per hour, and 15 rooms can provide that.\n\nBut why is there a waiting time if 20 rooms can handle 40 patients per hour?\n\nI think I'm confusing myself.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet's use Little's Law, which relates the average number of customers in a system (N), the arrival rate (\u03bb), and the average time a customer spends in the system (W):\n\nN = \u03bb * W\n\nSimilarly, for the queue, Nq = \u03bb * Wq\n\nWe can relate Nq to the number of servers (n), service rate per server (\u03bc), and arrival rate (\u03bb).\n\nIn an M/M/n queue, the average waiting time in the queue Wq can be calculated as:\n\nWq = Nq / \u03bb\n\nAnd Nq can be found using:\n\nNq = (\u03bb^2 / (n * \u03bc * (n * \u03bc - \u03bb))) for M/M/n queues.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the average waiting time in the queue for an M/M/n queue:\n\nWq = [(\u03bb / (n * \u03bc - \u03bb))] / [n * \u03bc]\n\nSet Wq \u2264 0.25 hours.\n\nGiven \u03bb = 60 patients per hour, \u03bc = 2 patients per hour per room.\n\nSo,\n\nWq = (60 / (n * 2 - 60)) / (2n) \u2264 0.25\n\nSimplify:\n\nWq = (60 / (2n - 60)) * (1 / 2n) = 60 / (4n\u00b2 - 120n) \u2264 0.25\n\nThen,\n\n60 \u2264 0.25 * (4n\u00b2 - 120n)\n\n60 \u2264 n\u00b2 - 30n\n\nn\u00b2 - 30n - 60 \u2265 0\n\nSolving n\u00b2 - 30n - 60 = 0 gives n \u2248 31.88 or n \u2248 -1.88\n\nSo, n \u2265 32 rooms.\n\nWait, but earlier I got n \u2265 30 rooms using a different approach.\n\nI think the first approach is more accurate because it uses the specific formula for waiting time in an M/M/n queue.\n\nTherefore, the hospital needs at least 32 rooms to ensure that the waiting time is no more than 15 minutes.\n\nCurrently, there are 20 rooms, so they need to add 12 rooms.\n\nNow, considering staffing:\n\nEach additional room requires one doctor and two nurses.\n\nTherefore, for 12 additional rooms:\n\n- Doctors: 12 additional doctors\n\n- Nurses: 24 additional nurses\n\nThis seems like a significant increase in staff, but it's necessary to meet the demand during peak hours.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other ways to improve efficiency without adding so many rooms and staff.\n\nFor example, reducing the treatment time per patient, or improving the flow of patients through the ER.\n\nBut based on the given parameters, if treatment time is fixed at 30 minutes per patient, and arrival rate is 60 patients per hour during peak times, then adding 12 rooms seems to be the solution to achieve the desired waiting time.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that with more rooms, the waiting time decreases, but there might be diminishing returns.\n\nLet me try plugging in n = 28 rooms and see what Wq is.\n\nWq = (60 / (2*28 - 60)) / (2*28) = (60 / (56 - 60)) / 56 = (60 / -4) / 56 = undefined, since division by negative number doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nWait, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use a more precise formula for Wq in an M/M/n queue.\n\nThe actual formula for Wq in an M/M/n queue is:\n\nWq = [(\u03bb / \u03bc)^n * \u03c1] / [n! * (1 - \u03c1)^2 * \u03bc]\n\nBut this is getting complicated, and I might not get an exact solution without numerical methods.\n\nGiven that, perhaps my initial approach with the quadratic equation is sufficient for this problem.\n\nTherefore, I'll stick with the conclusion that 32 rooms are needed, which means 12 additional rooms.\n\nStaffing requirements:\n\n- 12 additional doctors\n\n- 24 additional nurses\n\nAlternatively, if the hospital cannot hire that many additional staff, they may need to consider other strategies, such as:\n\n- Scheduling more staff during peak hours to reduce treatment times.\n\n- Implementing triage systems to prioritize patients and\u5206\u6d41\u90e8\u5206\u75c5\u4eba\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u90e8\u95e8\u6216\u533b\u9662\u3002\n\n- \u63d0\u9ad8\u73b0\u6709\u623f\u95f4\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ba1\u7406\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u8bca\u7597\u8f66\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a012\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u5ba4\u662f\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5927\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f415\u5206\u949f\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
