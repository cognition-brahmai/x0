        "content": "So the factory makes 1200 units every day, and each unit is sold for $10. We need to find out how much money the factory makes in one week.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many units are produced in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, I can multiply the daily production by 7.\n\nSo, 1200 units/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 8400 units/week.\n\nNext, each unit is sold for $10, so to find the total revenue, I need to multiply the number of units produced in a week by the price per unit.\n\nThat would be 8400 units \u00d7 $10/unit = $84,000.\n\nWait a minute, does the factory operate every day of the week? Maybe it has weekends off or something. But the problem says \"every day,\" so I think it's safe to assume it's 7 days a week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory doesn't produce on weekends, and a week is only 5 working days. But the problem doesn't specify, so I'll stick with 7 days.\n\nSo, the factory produces 1200 units/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 8400 units/week.\n\nThen, revenue is 8400 units \u00d7 $10/unit = $84,000.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the factory produces 1200 units each day and sells each unit for $10, then daily revenue is 1200 \u00d7 $10 = $12,000.\n\nThen, in one week (7 days), the revenue would be $12,000/day \u00d7 7 days = $84,000.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the factory generates $84,000 in revenue in one week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{84000} \\]"
