        "content": "So, I've got this problem here. A person invests $10,000 in a savings account that has an annual interest rate of 4%, and it's compounded quarterly. I need to find out how much money will be in the account after 5 years. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for compound interest because that's what's being used here. The general formula for compound interest is:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount, which is the initial amount of money. In this case, it's $10,000.\n\n- r is the annual interest rate decimal. So, 4% would be 0.04.\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's compounded quarterly, that means four times a year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for, in years. Here, it's 5 years.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nA = 10000(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*5)\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the interest rate per quarter:\n\n0.04 / 4 = 0.01\n\nSo, each quarter, the interest rate is 1%.\n\nNow, add 1 to that:\n\n1 + 0.01 = 1.01\n\nNow, raise that to the power of 4 times 5, which is 20:\n\n1.01^20\n\nI need to calculate 1.01 to the power of 20. Let me see:\n\n1.01^1 = 1.01\n\n1.01^2 = 1.0201\n\n1.01^3 = 1.030301\n\n1.01^4 = 1.04060401\n\n1.01^5 = 1.0510100501\n\n1.01^10 = (1.01^5)^2 \u2248 1.0510100501^2 \u2248 1.10408080321\n\n1.01^20 = (1.01^10)^2 \u2248 1.10408080321^2 \u2248 1.21899441242\n\nSo, approximately 1.219\n\nNow, multiply that by the principal amount:\n\nA = 10000 * 1.219 = 12190\n\nWait, but I remember that the actual formula should give a slightly higher amount because interest is compounding. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a financial calculator or a tool to compute this more accurately. But since I'm doing this manually, there might be a better way.\n\nLet me try using the formula again:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nP = 10000\n\nr = 0.04\n\nn = 4\n\nt = 5\n\nSo,\n\nA = 10000(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*5)\n\n= 10000(1 + 0.01)^20\n\n= 10000(1.01)^20\n\nNow, calculating (1.01)^20:\n\nI know that (1 + x)^n \u2248 e^(n*x) for small x, but perhaps I can use a better approximation or just calculate it directly.\n\nAlternatively, I can look up a table or use logarithms to calculate this more accurately.\n\nLet me try using logarithms.\n\nFirst, take the natural log of both sides:\n\nln(A) = ln(10000) + 20*ln(1.01)\n\nCalculate ln(10000) = ln(10^4) = 4*ln(10) \u2248 4*2.302585 \u2248 9.21034\n\nCalculate ln(1.01) \u2248 0.00995033\n\nSo,\n\nln(A) \u2248 9.21034 + 20*0.00995033 \u2248 9.21034 + 0.1990066 \u2248 9.4093466\n\nNow, A = e^(9.4093466) \u2248 12189.9\n\nSo, approximately $12,190.\n\nBut I think there's a more accurate way to calculate this without logarithms. Maybe I can use the compound interest formula directly.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate it step by step for each compounding period.\n\nSince it's compounded quarterly, every 3 months the interest is calculated and added to the principal.\n\nSo, each quarter, the interest is 1% of the current amount.\n\nLet me try calculating it quarter by quarter for 5 years, which is 20 quarters.\n\nStarting with $10,000.\n\nQuarter 1:\n\nInterest = 1% of 10,000 = $100\n\nNew balance = 10,000 + 100 = $10,100\n\nQuarter 2:\n\nInterest = 1% of 10,100 = $101\n\nNew balance = 10,100 + 101 = $10,201\n\nQuarter 3:\n\nInterest = 1% of 10,201 = $102.01\n\nNew balance = 10,201 + 102.01 = $10,303.01\n\nQuarter 4:\n\nInterest = 1% of 10,303.01 = $103.0301\n\nNew balance = 10,303.01 + 103.0301 = $10,406.0401\n\nAnd so on, for 20 quarters.\n\nThis seems time-consuming, but perhaps there's a pattern or a formula I can use to calculate the final amount directly.\n\nWait, that's the point of the compound interest formula. Maybe I should rely on that.\n\nSo, going back to the formula:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nA = 10000(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*5)\n\n= 10000(1 + 0.01)^20\n\n= 10000(1.01)^20\n\nNow, calculating (1.01)^20.\n\nI can use the binomial theorem for a better approximation.\n\n(1 + x)^n = 1 + n*x + (n*(n-1)/2)*x^2 + ...\n\nSo,\n\n(1.01)^20 = 1 + 20*0.01 + (20*19/2)*0.01^2 + ...\n\n= 1 + 0.2 + (190)*0.0001 + ...\n\n= 1 + 0.2 + 0.019 + ...\n\n\u2248 1.219\n\nSo,\n\nA \u2248 10000 * 1.219 = 12,190\n\nBut I know that the actual value should be slightly higher because I'm ignoring higher-order terms in the binomial expansion.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a financial calculator or an online tool to get the exact value.\n\nAssuming I don't have access to such tools, I'll stick with the formula.\n\nSo, A = 10000(1.01)^20\n\nCalculating 1.01^20:\n\n1.01^10 is approximately 1.10462\n\nSo, 1.01^20 = (1.01^10)^2 \u2248 1.10462^2 \u2248 1.22019\n\nTherefore, A \u2248 10000 * 1.22019 = 12,201.90\n\nSo, after 5 years, the account will have approximately $12,201.90.\n\nBut to be more precise, I can look up the exact value of (1.01)^20.\n\nUsing a calculator, (1.01)^20 \u2248 1.22019004 \u2248 1.22019\n\nTherefore, A = 10000 * 1.22019 = $12,201.90\n\nSo, the final amount in the account after 5 years would be approximately $12,201.90.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12201.90} \\]"
