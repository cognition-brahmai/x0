        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a box with 10 black socks and 10 white socks, and I can't see inside. I need to figure out how many socks I have to take out to make sure I have at least one pair of matching socks. Okay, let's think about this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to guarantee a matching pair. It's not about probability or likelihood; it's about ensuring that no matter what, I get at least one pair of the same color. So, I have to consider the worst-case scenario.\n\nWhat's the worst that can happen? Well, I could pick one black sock and one white sock. That's two socks, but they don't match. So, if I pick a third sock, it has to be either black or white. If I pick a black one, then I have two black socks, which is a matching pair. If I pick a white one, then I have two white socks, which is also a matching pair. So, in either case, by the time I pick the third sock, I have a matching pair.\n\nWait a minute, is there a way to pick more than two socks without getting a matching pair? Let's see. If I pick three socks, as I just thought, I'm guaranteed a matching pair. But maybe there's a scenario where I pick more than two socks without getting a matching pair. Hmm.\n\nActually, no. Because after picking two socks of different colors, any additional sock I pick will match one of the colors I've already picked. So, three socks are sufficient to guarantee at least one matching pair.\n\nBut let's generalize this thinking. Suppose there are more colors or more socks. The principle seems to be that I need to consider the worst-case scenario, which is picking one sock of each available color before I get a second sock of any color.\n\nIn this case, there are two colors: black and white. So, the worst case is picking one black and one white sock. The next sock I pick will necessarily match one of them.\n\nIf there were three colors, say black, white, and red, then the worst case would be picking one of each color, which is three socks, and the fourth sock would guarantee a matching pair.\n\nSo, in general, if there are n colors, I need to pick n+1 socks to guarantee at least one matching pair.\n\nIn this specific problem, n is 2 (black and white), so I need to pick 2 + 1 = 3 socks to guarantee a matching pair.\n\nBut let's double-check this reasoning. Suppose I pick two socks, and they are different colors. Then, the third sock I pick has to be either black or white, matching one of the first two.\n\nAlternatively, suppose I pick three socks. If the first two are different colors, and the third is the same as one of them, then I have a matching pair. If the third is different, but there are only two colors, then that's not possible. So, in this scenario, with only two colors, picking three socks guarantees at least one pair of matching socks.\n\nWait, but what if I pick two socks of the same color and then a third of the other color? Still, I have a matching pair from the first two.\n\nSo, in all possible scenarios, picking three socks ensures that I have at least one pair of matching socks.\n\nIs there a way to guarantee a matching pair by picking fewer than three socks? Well, if I pick only two socks, it's possible to get one black and one white, which doesn't give me a matching pair. Therefore, two socks are not sufficient to guarantee a matching pair.\n\nHence, the answer must be three socks.\n\nBut let's consider another angle. What if I pick four socks? Well, that would still guarantee a matching pair, but it's more than necessary. Similarly, any number greater than three would also guarantee a matching pair, but three is the smallest number that ensures it.\n\nSo, to summarize, in order to guarantee that I have at least one pair of matching socks from a box containing 10 black socks and 10 white socks, I need to pick out three socks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
