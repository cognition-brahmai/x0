        "content": "So I have this problem about a square garden that's 10 meters on each side, and I need to figure out how much fencing I'll need to go around it, but with a 2-meter opening for an entrance. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, since it's a square garden, all four sides are equal, right? So each side is 10 meters. To find the total perimeter, I would normally just multiply the side length by 4. That would be 10 meters times 4, which is 40 meters. That's the total fencing I'd need if there were no openings.\n\nBut there is an opening of 2 meters for the entrance, so I need to subtract that from the total perimeter. So, 40 meters minus 2 meters should give me the amount of fencing needed. That sounds straightforward.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check. The perimeter is the total length around the garden, which is 40 meters. If I'm leaving a 2-meter opening, that means I don't need fencing for those 2 meters. So, yes, subtracting 2 meters from 40 meters gives me 38 meters of fencing required.\n\nI think that makes sense. Is there any other way to approach this? Maybe I could calculate the perimeter step by step. Let's try that.\n\nStarting from one corner, let's say I have four sides: front, back, and two sides. Each is 10 meters. So, front is 10 meters, back is 10 meters, and the two sides are each 10 meters, totaling 40 meters.\n\nNow, if I'm making an opening of 2 meters on one of the sides, say the front, then instead of a full 10 meters on the front, I'll have 10 meters minus 2 meters, which is 8 meters of fencing on the front.\n\nSo, now the total fencing would be: 8 meters (front) plus 10 meters (back) plus 10 meters (one side) plus 10 meters (other side), which adds up to 38 meters.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, it's consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that the opening replaces part of the fencing. So, instead of having fencing along the entire perimeter, I'm replacing 2 meters with an opening. Therefore, the total fencing is the full perimeter minus the opening.\n\nMathematically, that's Perimeter - Opening = Fencing needed.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 40 meters - 2 meters = 38 meters.\n\nSeems solid.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the opening was on a corner or something, but the problem says it's an opening of 2 meters for the entrance, which I'm assuming is on one of the sides, not spanning corners.\n\nIf it were spanning corners, that might complicate things, but since it's a square garden, it's reasonable to assume the opening is on one of the straight sides.\n\nAlso, the problem doesn't specify where exactly the opening is placed, so I think assuming it's on one of the sides is fair.\n\nTherefore, the amount of fencing needed is 38 meters.\n\nI don't think there's any need for additional considerations here, like the width of the fence or anything like that, because the problem doesn't provide extra details. It's straightforward: find the perimeter and subtract the opening.\n\nSo, final answer: 38 meters of fencing needed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{38} \\]"
