        "content": "Let's see. The store sells apples for $1.50 per pound, and the customer buys 6 pounds. To find out how much the customer spends, I need to multiply the price per pound by the number of pounds bought.\n\nSo, that's $1.50 multiplied by 6.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n1.50 x 6 = ?\n\nWell, 1 x 6 is 6, and 0.50 x 6 is 3. So, 6 + 3 equals 9.\n\nTherefore, the customer spends $9.00 on apples.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me check again.\n\n1.50 times 6:\n\n1.50\n\ntimes\n\n6\n\n------\n\n9.00\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 1.50 is the same as 150 cents.\n\n150 cents per pound times 6 pounds is 900 cents.\n\nAnd 900 cents is equal to $9.00.\n\nSo, either way, it comes to $9.00.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
