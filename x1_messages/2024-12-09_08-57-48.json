        "content": "Assuming that each $100 bill has a thickness of approximately 0.0043 inches (0.0109 cm), we can calculate the number of bills in a 1-meter stack.\n\nFirst, convert 1 meter to inches because the thickness is given in inches.\n\n1 meter = 39.3701 inches\n\nNow, divide the total height of the stack by the thickness of one bill to find the number of bills.\n\nNumber of bills = Total height / Thickness per bill\nNumber of bills = 39.3701 inches / 0.0043 inches per bill\nNumber of bills \u2248 9,155.84 bills\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a bill, we'll round down to 9,155 bills.\n\nNow, each bill is worth $100, so the total amount of money in the stack is:\n\nTotal money = Number of bills \u00d7 Value per bill\nTotal money = 9,155 bills \u00d7 $100\nTotal money = $915,500\n\nTherefore, a stack of $100 bills that is 1 meter tall would contain approximately $915,500."
