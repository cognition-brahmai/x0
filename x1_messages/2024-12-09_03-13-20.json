This iconic statue, officially titled \"Liberty Enlightening the World,\" was designed by French sculptor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel. It was intended to commemorate the centennial of American independence and to honor the friendship between the two nations. The statue was assembled on Liberty Island in New York Harbor and has since become a symbol of freedom and democracy around the world."
