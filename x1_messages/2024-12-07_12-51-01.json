Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how bubble sort works:\n\n1. **Start** from the first element of the array.\n\n2. **Compare** the current element with the next element.\n\n- If the current element is greater than the next element, **swap** them.\n\n- If the current element is smaller or equal to the next element, **leave** them as they are.\n\n3. **Move** to the next element and repeat step 2 until you reach the end of the array.\n\n4. After one complete pass through the array, the largest element will be at the end.\n\n5. **Repeat** the entire process for the entire array except the last element, which is already sorted.\n\n6. Continue this process, reducing the range of unsorted elements by one after each pass, until the entire array is sorted.\n\nNow, let's implement this in JavaScript.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement the bubble sort algorithm in JavaScript, we need to repeatedly step through the list, compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Outer Loop**: This controls the number of passes we make over the array. For an array of size `n`, we need `n-1` passes.\n2. **Inner Loop**: In each pass, we compare each element with its next element and swap them if they are in the wrong order.\n3. **Optimization**: We can add a flag to check if any swaps occurred in the inner loop. If no swaps occurred, the array is already sorted, and we can terminate early.\n\n### Solution Code\n```javascript\nfunction bubbleSort(arr) {\n    let n = arr.length;\n    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {\n        // Flag to check if any swap occurs\n        let swapped = false;\n        for (let j = 0; j < n - 1 - i; j++) {\n            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {\n                // Swap arr[j] and arr[j + 1]\n                let temp = arr[j];\n                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];\n                arr[j + 1] = temp;\n                swapped = true;\n            }\n        }\n        // If no two elements were swapped in inner loop, break\n        if (!swapped) {\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    return arr;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nlet array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90];\nconsole.log(\"Original array:\", array);\nbubbleSort(array);\nconsole.log(\"Sorted array:\", array);\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Outer Loop**: Runs from `i = 0` to `n-2`.\n2. **Inner Loop**: Runs from `j = 0` to `n-2-i`. This ensures that after each pass, the largest element bubbles up to the end.\n3. **Swapping**: If `arr[j] > arr[j + 1]`, swap them.\n4. **Optimization Flag**: `swapped` is used to optimize the algorithm. If no swaps occur in a pass, the array is already sorted, and we can terminate early.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the array is sorted in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm."
