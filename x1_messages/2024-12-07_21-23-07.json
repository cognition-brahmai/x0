        "content": "So there are 100 houses numbered from 1 to 100, and I need to find out how many of these houses have the number '9' appearing at least once in their house number. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should probably list out all the house numbers and see where the digit '9' appears. But that seems time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions where '9' can appear in a two-digit number. For house numbers from 1 to 100, the numbers can be from 01 to 100, but since house number 1 is just 1, not 01, I'll consider numbers from 1 to 100.\n\nSo, for each house number, there can be one digit or two digits. For numbers from 1 to 9, they are single-digit, and only house number 9 has a '9'. For numbers from 10 to 99, they have two digits, so '9' can appear in the units place or the tens place. And then house number 100 is a three-digit number, but since it's 100, there's no '9' in it.\n\nAlright, so I can break this down into three parts:\n\n1. Single-digit house numbers (1 to 9):\n\n- Only house number 9 has a '9'.\n\n2. Two-digit house numbers (10 to 99):\n\n- '9' can be in the tens place: numbers like 90, 91, 92, ..., 99.\n\n- '9' can be in the units place: numbers like 19, 29, 39, ..., up to 99.\n\n3. Three-digit house number (100):\n\n- House number 100 does not contain a '9'.\n\nSo, first, for single-digit house numbers, there's only one house number with '9', which is house number 9.\n\nNext, for two-digit house numbers (10 to 99):\n\n- If '9' is in the tens place, the numbers are 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99. That's 10 houses.\n\n- If '9' is in the units place, the numbers are 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 99. That's 9 houses.\n\nWait a minute, I see that 99 is appearing in both lists. So if I add 10 + 9, that would be 19, but since 99 is counted in both, I should subtract one to avoid double-counting. So total two-digit houses with at least one '9' are 10 + 9 - 1 = 18 houses.\n\nThen, for house number 100, there's no '9', so it doesn't count.\n\nTherefore, the total number of houses with at least one '9' is 1 (from single-digit) + 18 (from two-digit) + 0 (from three-digit) = 19 houses.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's list them out to make sure.\n\nSingle-digit: 9\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99\n\n- Units place: 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 99\n\nAs I said, 99 is in both, so total unique houses are 1 + 10 + 9 - 1 = 19.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the total number of houses with at least one '9' is equal to the total houses minus the houses with no '9's at all.\n\nTotal houses: 100\n\nHouses with no '9's:\n\n- Single-digit (1 to 9): exclude 9, so 8 houses.\n\n- Two-digit (10 to 99): exclude those with '9' in tens or units place.\n\n- Three-digit (100): no '9'.\n\nSo, for two-digit houses with no '9's:\n\n- Tens place: can be 1 to 8 (since 9 is excluded), so 8 options.\n\n- Units place: can be 0 to 8 (since 9 is excluded), so 9 options.\n\nTherefore, 8 * 9 = 72 two-digit houses with no '9's.\n\nPlus, single-digit houses with no '9's: 8 houses.\n\nPlus, house number 100: 1 house.\n\nSo total houses with no '9's: 8 (single-digit) + 72 (two-digit) + 1 (three-digit) = 81 houses.\n\nTherefore, houses with at least one '9' = total houses - houses with no '9's = 100 - 81 = 19 houses.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 19 houses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{19} \\]"
