        "content": "Certainly! Here are three circus skills described in YAML format, including their levels of difficulty and necessary equipment:\n\n```yaml\n- skill: Juggling\n  difficulty: Medium\n  equipment:\n    - Juggling balls (3-5)\n    - Open space to practice\n\n- skill: Tightrope Walking\n  difficulty: High\n  equipment:\n    - Tightrope setup (rope, anchors, safety net)\n    - Balance pole (optional)\n\n- skill: Diabolo\n  difficulty: Medium-High\n  equipment:\n    - Diabolo (the spinning top)\n    - Two sticks with strings attached\n    - Flat, smooth surface for practicing tricks\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Juggling:**\n   - **Difficulty:** Medium\n     - Juggling is a skill that requires coordination and hand-eye timing. It can be learned by most people with practice, but mastering more complex patterns takes time.\n   - **Equipment:**\n     - **Juggling balls:** Typically 3-5 balls are used to start.\n     - **Open space:** A clear area to practice without obstacles.\n\n2. **Tightrope Walking:**\n   - **Difficulty:** High\n     - This skill requires exceptional balance, focus, and often physical strength to maintain posture on a thin rope.\n   - **Equipment:**\n     - **Tightrope setup:** Includes the rope itself, secure anchors at both ends, and ideally a safety net below.\n     - **Balance pole:** Optional, but helps with maintaining balance by extending the center of gravity.\n\n3. **Diabolo:**\n   - **Difficulty:** Medium-High\n     - Involves spinning and manipulating a spool (diabolo) on a string attached to two handles. It requires good hand coordination and practice to master basic and advanced tricks.\n   - **Equipment:**\n     - **Diabolo:** The spinning top toy.\n     - **Two sticks with strings attached:** These are used to control the diabolo.\n     - **Flat, smooth surface:** For practicing tricks without interference from uneven ground or obstacles.\n```\n\n"
