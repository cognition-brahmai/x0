        "content": "So there are 20 birds on a tree, and a hunter shoots and kills 25% of them. I need to figure out how many birds are left on the tree. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many birds were killed by the hunter. Since the hunter killed 25% of the birds, I can calculate 25% of 20.\n\n25% of 20 is calculated as (25/100) * 20 = 5 birds.\n\nSo, 5 birds were killed.\n\nNow, to find out how many birds are left on the tree, I subtract the number of birds killed from the total number of birds initially on the tree.\n\n20 - 5 = 15 birds.\n\nWait a minute, but this seems too straightforward. Maybe there's something else to consider.\n\nPerhaps the sound of the gunshot would scare away the remaining birds, causing them to fly away. In that case, if the remaining birds fly away, there might be no birds left on the tree.\n\nBut the question says \"how many birds are left on the tree,\" not how many birds are still in the area.\n\nGiven that, it's possible that the remaining birds were scared by the gunshot and flew away.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some of the birds were not scared and stayed on the tree.\n\nBut the question doesn't provide any information about the behavior of the remaining birds after the shooting.\n\nIn such cases, it's usually safe to assume that only the birds killed by the hunter are removed, and the rest remain unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, based on that assumption, if 5 birds were killed, then 15 birds are still on the tree.\n\nHowever, considering the practical aspect, it's likely that the noise from the gunshot would scare the remaining birds away.\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify any such behavior, I should stick to the given information.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 15 birds left on the tree.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another perspective.\n\nSuppose that the hunter's shot scares all the remaining birds away. In that case, there would be no birds left on the tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only some of the birds fly away, and others stay.\n\nBut again, without specific information, it's impossible to determine.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is simply the mathematical calculation: 20 minus 25% of 20, which is 15.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to trick me by suggesting that all birds, including the dead ones, are still on the tree.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as killed birds would probably fall off the tree.\n\nWait, perhaps the killed birds remain on the tree until removed.\n\nBut the question says the hunter kills 25% of them, but it doesn't say anything about removing the dead birds.\n\nSo, if the dead birds stay on the tree, then the number of birds left on the tree would still be 20, but with 5 dead and 15 alive.\n\nBut the question probably expects us to consider only the living birds as \"left on the tree.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe both dead and living birds are considered \"left on the tree.\"\n\nBut that seems unclear.\n\nPerhaps the question is ambiguous.\n\nLet me look at it again.\n\n\"There are 20 birds on a tree. A hunter shoots and kills 25% of them. How many birds are left on the tree? Explain your logic.\"\n\nGiven that, I think the expectation is to calculate the number of living birds remaining on the tree after the hunter's shot.\n\nAssuming that the remaining living birds fly away due to the gunshot, then there would be only the dead birds left on the tree.\n\nBut again, it's unclear whether the dead birds remain on the tree or fall off.\n\nIf the dead birds fall off, then there would be no birds left on the tree.\n\nBut generally, when a bird is shot, it may fall off the tree.\n\nHowever, perhaps some birds fall off and some stay, depending on where they were perched.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I should stick to the straightforward approach:\n\n- Total birds initially: 20\n\n- Percentage killed: 25%\n\n- Number killed: 25% of 20 = 5\n\n- Number remaining: 20 - 5 = 15\n\nTherefore, 15 birds are left on the tree.\n\nAlternatively, considering the practical scenario where the gunshot scares away the remaining birds, then there would be only the dead birds left on the tree.\n\nBut since the question asks for the number of birds left on the tree, and doesn't specify whether dead or alive, perhaps the answer should include both dead and living birds.\n\nBut again, it's unclear.\n\nMaybe the intended answer is 15, assuming that the remaining living birds fly away, and only the dead ones remain on the tree.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense because dead birds wouldn't stay on the tree; they might fall off.\n\nThis is getting too confusing.\n\nI think the best approach is to go with the straightforward mathematical calculation: 20 minus 25% of 20 equals 15.\n\nTherefore, there are 15 birds left on the tree.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
