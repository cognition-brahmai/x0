        "content": "So if I read 50 pages every day for two weeks, how many pages would that be in total? Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many days are in two weeks. Well, one week has 7 days, so two weeks would have 14 days.\n\nNow, if I read 50 pages each day for 14 days, I can find the total by multiplying the number of pages per day by the number of days.\n\nSo, that would be 50 pages/day times 14 days.\n\nLet me do the math: 50 times 14.\n\nI know that 50 times 10 is 500, and 50 times 4 is 200. So, 500 plus 200 is 700.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 14 as 10 plus 4, so 50 times 10 is 500, and 50 times 4 is 200, and adding them gives 700.\n\nOr, I can multiply 50 by 14 directly: 50 times 14 is 700.\n\nSo, I would have read 700 pages in total.\n\nBut wait, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using division or something else.\n\nWell, since I'm dealing with multiplication here, division isn't directly applicable unless I want to verify the result.\n\nFor example, if I have 700 pages and I divide them by 14 days, I should get back to 50 pages per day.\n\nLet's check: 700 divided by 14 is indeed 50.\n\nSo, that confirms my multiplication was correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I had a different number of pages or days, I might need to adjust my calculation, but in this case, it's straightforward.\n\nI don't think there are any tricks here, like considering weekends or holidays, since the question says \"every day for two weeks,\" which means all 14 days are included.\n\nSo, the total number of pages read would be 700.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{700} \\]"
