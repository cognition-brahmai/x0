        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces widgets at a cost of $5 each and sells them for $12 each. They want to make a profit of $3,500. We need to find out how many widgets they need to sell to reach that profit.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what profit means. Profit is basically the money earned from sales minus the cost of producing those widgets. So, profit equals total revenue minus total cost.\n\nGiven that, let's define some variables to make this clearer. Let\u2019s let \\( n \\) be the number of widgets sold.\n\nThe total revenue from selling \\( n \\) widgets at $12 each would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue} = 12n\n\\]\n\nThe total cost of producing \\( n \\) widgets at $5 each would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost} = 5n\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the profit \\( P \\) would be:\n\n\\[\nP = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Cost} = 12n - 5n = 7n\n\\]\n\nNow, we know they want a profit of $3,500, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n7n = 3500\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( n \\), we just need to divide both sides by 7:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{3500}{7} = 500\n\\]\n\nSo, they need to sell 500 widgets to make a profit of $3,500.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there are other costs involved that I haven't considered, like fixed costs. The problem doesn't mention any fixed costs, so I assume that the only cost is the $5 per widget. If there were fixed costs, we would need to account for those separately.\n\nAlso, it's important to make sure that the selling price is indeed $12 per widget and that there are no discounts or varying prices based on the number sold. The problem states that each widget is sold for $12, so I'll stick with that.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether all produced widgets are sold. If they produce more than they sell, they would have unsold widgets, which might incur holding costs, but again, the problem doesn't mention any such costs.\n\nGiven the information provided, the calculation seems straightforward. The profit per widget is $12 minus $5, which is $7. So, to make $3,500 in profit, they need to sell $3,500 divided by $7 per widget, which is indeed 500 widgets.\n\nLet me just verify the arithmetic to be completely sure:\n\n\\[\n7 \\times 500 = 3500\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the factory needs to sell 500 widgets to achieve a profit of $3,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500} \\]"
