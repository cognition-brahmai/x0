        "content": "Let's see here. So, there are three friends who decided to split the cost of a pizza evenly. The pizza costs $12 in total. If they were all paying, each would pay $12 divided by 3, which is $4 each. But one friend forgot their wallet, so they can't pay their share. That means the other two friends have to cover the missing $4.\n\nNow, the two friends are going to split that missing $4 between them, in addition to their own $4 share. So, each of the two friends will pay their own $4 plus half of the missing $4.\n\nHalf of $4 is $2. So, each of the two friends will pay $4 (their own share) plus $2 (half of the missing share), which totals $6 each.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If each of the two friends pays $6, then together they pay $12, which is the total cost of the pizza. That makes sense because the one friend who didn't pay their share has their $4 covered by the other two, who each pay an extra $2.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is that the total cost is $12, and only two friends are paying. So, $12 divided by 2 is $6 each.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each of the two paying friends owes $6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
