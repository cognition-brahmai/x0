        "content": "So, if a store has 3 different types of apples and 4 different types of oranges, and I want to buy one apple and one orange, how many different ways can I do that?\n\nWell, let's think about this. If there are 3 types of apples, say Apple A, Apple B, and Apple C, and 4 types of oranges, say Orange 1, Orange 2, Orange 3, and Orange 4, then for each type of apple, I can pair it with any of the 4 types of oranges.\n\nSo, for Apple A, I can choose Orange 1, Orange 2, Orange 3, or Orange 4. That's 4 options just for Apple A. Similarly, for Apple B, I again have 4 options: Orange 1, Orange 2, Orange 3, or Orange 4. The same goes for Apple C.\n\nSo, for each apple, there are 4 choices of oranges. Since there are 3 apples, total combinations would be 3 apples times 4 oranges, which is 12 different ways.\n\nWait, is there a formula for this? I think in probability, when you have independent events, you multiply the number of choices. Here, choosing an apple and choosing an orange are independent; what you choose for apple doesn't affect what you choose for orange, assuming you can choose any combination.\n\nSo, the total number of different ways to buy one apple and one orange is 3 multiplied by 4, which equals 12.\n\nLet me list them out to make sure:\n\n1. Apple A and Orange 1\n\n2. Apple A and Orange 2\n\n3. Apple A and Orange 3\n\n4. Apple A and Orange 4\n\n5. Apple B and Orange 1\n\n6. Apple B and Orange 2\n\n7. Apple B and Orange 3\n\n8. Apple B and Orange 4\n\n9. Apple C and Orange 1\n\n10. Apple C and Orange 2\n\n11. Apple C and Orange 3\n\n12. Apple C and Orange 4\n\nYes, that's 12 different combinations.\n\nBut wait, is there a possibility that some combinations might not be allowed? Like, maybe the store doesn't allow certain types of apples with certain types of oranges due to some pairing restrictions. But the question doesn't mention any restrictions, so I'll assume all combinations are possible.\n\nAlso, the question is about buying one apple and one orange, not about buying multiple fruits or anything else. So, I don't need to consider scenarios where I might buy more than one of each.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the apples and oranges as two separate choices. First, I choose an apple, and then I choose an orange. The order of selection might not matter here, but the total number of combinations is still the product of the number of choices for each fruit.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think in terms of sets, the set of apples has 3 elements, and the set of oranges has 4 elements. The Cartesian product of these two sets would have 3 times 4, which is 12 elements.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I keep arriving at 12 as the total number of different ways to buy one apple and one orange.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Maybe if some apples or oranges are out of stock, but again, the question doesn't mention any such constraints. It seems straightforward.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the question were about choosing either one apple or one orange, not both. In that case, it would be 3 plus 4, equaling 7 options. But the question specifies buying one apple and one orange, which means both, not either-or.\n\nSo, definitely, it's multiplication, not addition.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 12 different ways.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
