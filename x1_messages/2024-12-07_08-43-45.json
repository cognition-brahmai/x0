        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 4 red balls and 6 blue balls, making a total of 10 balls. I need to find the probability of drawing one ball of each color when I draw two balls without replacement. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I draw a ball, I don't put it back into the box before drawing the next one. So, the total number of balls decreases by one after each draw.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the probability of drawing one ball of each color. That means either I draw a red ball first and then a blue ball, or a blue ball first and then a red ball. So, there are two scenarios to consider here.\n\nLet me consider the first scenario: drawing a red ball first and then a blue ball.\n\nThe probability of drawing a red ball first is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. So, that's 4 red balls out of 10 total balls, which is 4/10 or 2/5.\n\nAfter drawing a red ball, there are now 9 balls left in the box: 3 red and 6 blue. So, the probability of drawing a blue ball next is 6 blue balls out of 9 total balls, which is 6/9 or 2/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both events happening in sequence\u2014first drawing a red ball and then a blue ball\u2014is the product of the individual probabilities: (2/5) * (2/3) = 4/15.\n\nNow, let's consider the second scenario: drawing a blue ball first and then a red ball.\n\nThe probability of drawing a blue ball first is the number of blue balls divided by the total number of balls. So, that's 6 blue balls out of 10 total balls, which is 6/10 or 3/5.\n\nAfter drawing a blue ball, there are now 9 balls left in the box: 4 red and 5 blue. So, the probability of drawing a red ball next is 4 red balls out of 9 total balls, which is 4/9.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both events happening in sequence\u2014first drawing a blue ball and then a red ball\u2014is the product of the individual probabilities: (3/5) * (4/9) = 12/45, which simplifies to 4/15.\n\nNow, since these two scenarios are mutually exclusive (they can't both happen at the same time), I need to add their probabilities to get the total probability of drawing one ball of each color.\n\nSo, total probability = probability of first scenario + probability of second scenario = 4/15 + 4/15 = 8/15.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using combinations?\n\nYes, I can use combinations to calculate the probability.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 10 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, total number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 10 is C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * 8!) = (10 * 9)/2 = 45.\n\nNow, the number of ways to choose one red and one blue ball is the product of the number of ways to choose one red ball and the number of ways to choose one blue ball.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one red ball is C(4, 1) = 4.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one blue ball is C(6, 1) = 6.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose one red and one blue ball is 4 * 6 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 24/45, which simplifies to 8/15.\n\nOkay, so both methods give me the same answer: 8/15.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using probability trees or something like that?\n\nWell, probability trees can be used, but in this case, with just two draws, it might be a bit overkill, but let's see.\n\nStarting with the first draw:\n\n- Probability of drawing red first: 4/10\n\n- Probability of drawing blue first: 6/10\n\nThen, for each branch, the second draw:\n\nIf first draw is red:\n\n- Probability of second draw being blue: 6/9\n\nIf first draw is blue:\n\n- Probability of second draw being red: 4/9\n\nSo, the probability of red then blue is (4/10)*(6/9) = 4/15\n\nProbability of blue then red is (6/10)*(4/9) = 4/15\n\nTotal probability is 4/15 + 4/15 = 8/15\n\nSame answer again.\n\nWhat if I consider the order doesn't matter? Can I calculate it directly without considering the order?\n\nYes, that's essentially what I did with the combinations approach. By using combinations, I didn't consider the order of drawing the balls.\n\nSo, in summary, whether I consider the sequences separately and add their probabilities or use combinations to calculate the probability directly, I end up with the same result: 8/15.\n\nIs there any chance I'm missing something here?\n\nLet me think: are there any other scenarios I should consider? Well, the problem specifies drawing two balls without replacement, and I've considered all possible ways to draw one of each color. So, I think I've covered it.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the probability of drawing two red balls and two blue balls and see if everything adds up.\n\nProbability of two red balls: C(4, 2)/C(10, 2) = 6/45 = 2/15\n\nProbability of two blue balls: C(6, 2)/C(10, 2) = 15/45 = 1/3\n\nProbability of one red and one blue: 24/45 = 8/15\n\nNow, let's add them up: 2/15 + 1/3 + 8/15\n\nConvert 1/3 to fifteenths: 1/3 = 5/15\n\nSo, 2/15 + 5/15 + 8/15 = 15/15 = 1\n\nYes, it all adds up to 1, which makes sense because these are the only possible outcomes when drawing two balls.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the probability of drawing one ball of each color is indeed 8/15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{8}{15}} \\]"
