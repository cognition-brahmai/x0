        "content": "Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. She was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, which she shared with her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, for their work on radioactivity. Marie Curie later won another Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911 for her discovery of the elements radium and polonium. Thus, she is the only person to have won Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields."
