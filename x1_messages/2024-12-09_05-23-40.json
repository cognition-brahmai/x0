        "content": "So I have this problem: I need to figure out how many four-digit palindromes there are. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward, like 121 or 1331. But in this case, we're dealing with four-digit numbers, so examples would be 1221 or 1331, where the first and last digits are the same, and the two middle digits are the same.\n\nAlright, first things first, let's understand what a four-digit palindrome looks like. It has four digits, so it's of the form ABCD, where A, B, C, and D are digits from 0 to 9, but since it's a four-digit number, A can't be 0 (because that would make it a three-digit number or less).\n\nNow, for it to be a palindrome, it has to read the same forward and backward. That means A must equal D, and B must equal C. So, the number looks like ABBA.\n\nSo, the number is determined by choosing A, B, and then setting C and D accordingly, since C = B and D = A.\n\nAlright, so how many choices do we have for A? A can be any digit from 1 to 9, because if A were 0, it wouldn't be a four-digit number. So, there are 9 possible choices for A.\n\nNext, B can be any digit from 0 to 9, because there are no restrictions on B other than it being a digit. So, there are 10 possible choices for B.\n\nOnce A and B are chosen, C and D are determined, since C must equal B and D must equal A.\n\nTherefore, the total number of four-digit palindromes should be the number of choices for A multiplied by the number of choices for B, which is 9 times 10, equaling 90.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Let's consider an example. If A is 1 and B is 2, then the number is 1221, which is a palindrome. If A is 1 and B is 0, the number is 1001, which is also a palindrome. So, that seems correct.\n\nIs there any other restriction I might be missing? For example, are there any leading zeros to worry about? Well, A can't be 0, but since D is equal to A, and A is not zero, D is also not zero. C is equal to B, which can be zero, but that's fine because it's the hundreds digit and doesn't affect the number of digits.\n\nSo, it seems straightforward: 9 choices for A (1 through 9), and 10 choices for B (0 through 9), giving a total of 90 four-digit palindromes.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about the range of four-digit numbers. The smallest four-digit number is 1000, and the largest is 9999. Palindromes within this range would start from 1001, 1111, 1221, up to 9999 if it's a palindrome.\n\nWait, is 9999 a palindrome? Yes, because it reads the same forward and backward. Similarly, 1001 is a palindrome.\n\nSo, going from A=1 to A=9, and for each A, B goes from 0 to 9, that's indeed 90 possibilities.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem to confirm? Maybe by considering the number of possible pairs for the first and last digits, and the middle two digits.\n\nWell, since the first and last digits have to be the same, and the second and third digits have to be the same, it's essentially choosing the first digit (A) and the second digit (B), and then setting C and D accordingly.\n\nSo, again, 9 choices for A and 10 choices for B, totaling 90.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think about the total number of four-digit numbers and see what fraction of them are palindromes.\n\nThe total number of four-digit numbers is 9000, since it's from 1000 to 9999, inclusive. That's 9000 numbers.\n\nBut figuring out the fraction that are palindromes might not be straightforward without knowing how palindromes are distributed.\n\nGiven that, I think the initial approach is the most straightforward and correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of four-digit palindromes is 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]"
