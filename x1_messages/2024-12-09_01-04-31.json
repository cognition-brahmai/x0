For example, a course in mechanical engineering might delve into the principles of thermodynamics and fluid mechanics, while a course in electrical engineering might focus on circuit theory and signal processing. Regardless of the discipline, the course is likely to involve a combination of theoretical study and practical application, with students learning to apply their knowledge to solve real-world problems. What is likely to be a common element in these courses?\nA. The use of computer programming in engineering\nB. The role of materials science in engineering\nC. The impact of environmental factors on engineering design\nD. The application of theoretical knowledge to solve real-world problems"

While options A, B, and C are important aspects in certain engineering fields, not all engineering disciplines necessarily emphasize computer programming, materials science, or environmental factors to the same extent. However, applying theoretical knowledge to solve real-world problems is a fundamental aspect of engineering education overall."
