        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a bacteria colony that doubles every hour. If I start with 50 bacteria, how many will there be after 10 hours? Hmm, exponential growth, right? Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"doubles every hour\" means. It means that every hour, the number of bacteria increases by a factor of 2. So, if I have x bacteria at a certain hour, the next hour I'll have 2x.\n\nStarting with 50 bacteria, after one hour, it would be 50 times 2, which is 100. After two hours, it would double again to 200, and so on.\n\nI think there's a formula for this. Exponential growth is often represented by the formula:\n\n\\[ N(t) = N_0 \\times 2^{(t/T)} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( N(t) \\) is the amount at time t.\n\n- \\( N_0 \\) is the initial amount.\n\n- t is the time elapsed.\n\n- T is the doubling time.\n\nIn this case, \\( N_0 = 50 \\), t = 10 hours, and T = 1 hour.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ N(10) = 50 \\times 2^{(10/1)} = 50 \\times 2^{10} \\]\n\nNow, what's 2 raised to the 10th power? Let's see:\n\n2^1 = 2\n\n2^2 = 4\n\n2^3 = 8\n\n2^4 = 16\n\n2^5 = 32\n\n2^6 = 64\n\n2^7 = 128\n\n2^8 = 256\n\n2^9 = 512\n\n2^10 = 1024\n\nSo, \\( 2^{10} = 1024 \\).\n\nNow, multiply that by the initial population:\n\n50 \u00d7 1024 = ?\n\nWell, 50 times 1000 is 50,000, and 50 times 24 is 1,200. So, total is 50,000 + 1,200 = 51,200.\n\nTherefore, after 10 hours, there would be 51,200 bacteria.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using the general exponential growth formula:\n\n\\[ N(t) = N_0 \\times e^{(kt)} \\]\n\nWhere k is the growth rate.\n\nBut in this case, since it's doubling every hour, using the first formula is more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as a geometric sequence where each term is twice the previous one.\n\nStarting with 50, then 100, 200, 400, and so on, up to 10 hours.\n\nTo find the 10th term:\n\nFirst term (a) = 50\n\nCommon ratio (r) = 2\n\nNumber of terms (n) = 10\n\nThe formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:\n\n\\[ a_n = a \\times r^{(n-1)} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ a_{10} = 50 \\times 2^{9} \\]\n\nWait, that's 2 to the 9th power because n-1 = 9.\n\nBut earlier, using the exponential growth formula, I had 2 to the 10th power.\n\nHmm, which one is correct?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf I start at time t=0 with 50 bacteria, then at t=1 hour, it doubles to 100, which is 50 times 2^1.\n\nAt t=2 hours, it's 200, which is 50 times 2^2.\n\nSo, in general, at time t, it's \\( 50 \\times 2^{t} \\).\n\nTherefore, at t=10 hours, it should be \\( 50 \\times 2^{10} = 50 \\times 1024 = 51,200 \\).\n\nBut according to the geometric sequence formula, \\( a_n = a \\times r^{(n-1)} \\), which would give \\( 50 \\times 2^{9} = 50 \\times 512 = 25,600 \\).\n\nThat's half of what the exponential growth formula gives.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nI think the exponential growth formula is more appropriate for continuous doubling, while the geometric sequence might be slightly different in interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the geometric sequence formula is misapplied here.\n\nLet me check the geometric sequence approach again.\n\nIf I consider t=0, N=50.\n\nt=1, N=100.\n\nt=2, N=200.\n\n...\n\nThen, the general formula should be \\( N(t) = 50 \\times 2^{t} \\), where t is the number of hours.\n\nSo, at t=10, \\( N(10) = 50 \\times 2^{10} = 51,200 \\).\n\nTherefore, the geometric sequence formula I initially used was incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that at t=0, it's already the first term.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to use the exponential growth formula or simply recognize that it's doubling every hour, starting from 50.\n\nTherefore, after 10 hours, the population would be 50 multiplied by 2 raised to the 10th power, which is 50 times 1024, equaling 51,200 bacteria.\n\nLet me just confirm this with a smaller time frame to see if it makes sense.\n\nFor example, after 1 hour: 50 \u00d7 2^1 = 100.\n\nAfter 2 hours: 50 \u00d7 2^2 = 200.\n\nAfter 3 hours: 50 \u00d7 2^3 = 400.\n\nYes, that matches the doubling pattern.\n\nSo, after 10 hours, it should be 50 \u00d7 2^10 = 50 \u00d7 1024 = 51,200.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{51200} \\]"
