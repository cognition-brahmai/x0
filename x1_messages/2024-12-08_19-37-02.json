        "content": "The Apollo astronauts brought back lunar samples during their missions to the Moon, and these samples are stored at a facility managed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Specifically, the main repository for these lunar samples is located at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. This facility is known as the Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility.\n\nAdditionally, there is a secondary repository for lunar samples at Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, also in Houston. These repositories ensure the preservation and scientific study of the lunar materials collected during the Apollo missions.\n\nIt's worth noting that some lunar samples are also held at other institutions for educational and research purposes, but the primary storage and curation are handled by NASA at their facilities in Houston."
