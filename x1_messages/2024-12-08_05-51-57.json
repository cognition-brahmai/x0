        "content": "In the realm where ancient echoes dwell,\nWhere stone and shadow weave their spell,\nThere stand the mountains, proud and old,\nTheir peaks in mist, their tales untold.\n\nBeneath the sky's eternal blue,\nThey guard the secrets that few knew,\nOf elves and dwarves, of dragons' lair,\nAnd wizards' might beyond compare.\n\nMountains of Mist, where mists do curl,\nAnd winds sing songs that stir the soul,\nTheir heights unclimbable, their hearts pure,\nIn their silent vigil, they endure.\n\nMountains of Flame, where fire burns bright,\nGuarded by dragons through day and night,\nTheir crags are hot, their valleys deep,\nWhere only the brave or foolhardy creep.\n\nMountains of Snow, where winter reigns,\nAnd frostbeard giants build their domains,\nTheir peaks are white, their breath is cold,\nYet life endures, though seldom told.\n\nMountains of Gold, where treasures lie,\nBuried deep within the earth's embrace,\nDwarves delve and toil, their beards aglow,\nIn mines where sunlight never shows.\n\nMountains of Dreams, where spirits dwell,\nAnd ancient trees whisper secrets well,\nElves dance beneath the moon's soft light,\nIn glades where time stands still and right.\n\nOh, mountains tall, with stories vast,\nYour grandeur stirs the human heart,\nIn your embrace, we find our place,\nIn this world, both wild and tame.\n\nSo sing we now, this ballad old,\nOf mountains fair, where legends hold,\nMay their majesty forever shine,\nIn the hearts of those who climb and pine.\n\n**End of Ballad**"
