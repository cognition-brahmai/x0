        "content": "So the zoo is planning this new exhibit for endangered species, and it's divided into four sections for different species. The total area is 50,000 square feet, and it's split up like this: 40% for Species A, 30% for Species B, 20% for Species C, and 10% for Species D. Then, there are recommended space requirements per animal for each species: 500 sq ft for A, 400 for B, 600 for C, and 800 for D. I need to calculate the individual areas for each section and figure out how many animals can be housed in each based on those space requirements.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the area for each species section.\n\nFor Species A:\n\n40% of 50,000 sq ft is 0.40 * 50,000 = 20,000 sq ft.\n\nFor Species B:\n\n30% of 50,000 sq ft is 0.30 * 50,000 = 15,000 sq ft.\n\nFor Species C:\n\n20% of 50,000 sq ft is 0.20 * 50,000 = 10,000 sq ft.\n\nFor Species D:\n\n10% of 50,000 sq ft is 0.10 * 50,000 = 5,000 sq ft.\n\nNow, to estimate the number of animals that can be housed in each section, I'll divide the area allocated to each species by the recommended space per animal for that species.\n\nFor Species A:\n\n20,000 sq ft / 500 sq ft per animal = 40 animals.\n\nFor Species B:\n\n15,000 sq ft / 400 sq ft per animal = 37.5 animals.\n\nBut we can't have half an animal, so maybe they'll house 37 or round up to 38, depending on how they handle that.\n\nFor Species C:\n\n10,000 sq ft / 600 sq ft per animal = approximately 16.67 animals.\n\nAgain, probably 16 or 17 animals.\n\nFor Species D:\n\n5,000 sq ft / 800 sq ft per animal = 6.25 animals.\n\nSo, maybe 6 or 7 animals.\n\nBut considering that these are endangered species, perhaps they'll aim for smaller numbers to ensure each animal has enough space or to account for future growth.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any other space requirements, like areas for enclosures, habitats, or visitor pathways, but based on the information given, it seems like the entire area is allocated for the animals.\n\nIt might be useful to double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me verify the area calculations:\n\n- Species A: 40% of 50,000 = 20,000 sq ft. That seems correct.\n\n- Species B: 30% of 50,000 = 15,000 sq ft. Correct.\n\n- Species C: 20% of 50,000 = 10,000 sq ft. Correct.\n\n- Species D: 10% of 50,000 = 5,000 sq ft. Correct.\n\nNow, for the number of animals:\n\n- Species A: 20,000 / 500 = 40. Correct.\n\n- Species B: 15,000 / 400 = 37.5. Correct.\n\n- Species C: 10,000 / 600 \u2248 16.67. Correct.\n\n- Species D: 5,000 / 800 = 6.25. Correct.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there are any additional factors that could affect the number of animals, like the need for breeding spaces, sick bays, or separation areas for different groups within the species.\n\nBut based on the information provided, it seems like the calculations are straightforward.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Species A: 20,000 sq ft, accommodating 40 animals.\n\n- Species B: 15,000 sq ft, accommodating 37 or 38 animals.\n\n- Species C: 10,000 sq ft, accommodating 16 or 17 animals.\n\n- Species D: 5,000 sq ft, accommodating 6 or 7 animals.\n\nThis should give the zoo a good estimate of how many animals they can house in each section of the new exhibit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\begin{array}{l|l|l}\n\\text{Species} & \\text{Area (sq ft)} & \\text{Number of Animals} \\\\\n\\hline\nA & 20,000 & 40 \\\\\nB & 15,000 & 37 \\text{ or } 38 \\\\\nC & 10,000 & 16 \\text{ or } 17 \\\\\nD & 5,000 & 6 \\text{ or } 7 \\\\\n\\end{array} } \\]"
