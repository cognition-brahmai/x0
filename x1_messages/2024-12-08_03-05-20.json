The word \"moonlet\" comes from the Latin word \"luna,\" meaning \"moon,\" combined with the suffix \"-let,\" which denotes something small. Moonlets are typically much smaller than regular moons and can be found in various planetary systems, including our own solar system. For example, some of the smaller satellites orbiting Jupiter and Saturn can be considered moonlets."
