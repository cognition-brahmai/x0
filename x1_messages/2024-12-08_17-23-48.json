        "content": "Let's see. There are two types of pens: Type A costs $1.50 each and Type B costs $2.00 each. The customer buys a total of 10 pens for $18.00, and we need to find out how many of each type they bought.\n\nHmm, this seems like a system of equations problem. Let me define variables for the number of each type of pen. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( a \\) be the number of Type A pens.\n\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of Type B pens.\n\nWe know that the total number of pens is 10, so:\n\n\\[ a + b = 10 \\]\n\nAnd the total cost is $18.00, so:\n\n\\[ 1.5a + 2b = 18 \\]\n\nNow, I have two equations with two variables. I can solve this system to find the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nFirst, I can solve the first equation for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ a = 10 - b \\]\n\nThen, substitute this expression into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 1.5(10 - b) + 2b = 18 \\]\n\nNow, let's distribute the 1.5:\n\n\\[ 15 - 1.5b + 2b = 18 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 15 + 0.5b = 18 \\]\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.5b = 3 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.5:\n\n\\[ b = 6 \\]\n\nSo, the number of Type B pens is 6. Now, plug this back into the equation for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ a = 10 - 6 = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 4 Type A pens and 6 Type B pens.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense. The cost of 4 Type A pens is \\( 4 \\times 1.5 = 6 \\) dollars, and the cost of 6 Type B pens is \\( 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\) dollars. Adding those up: \\( 6 + 12 = 18 \\) dollars, which matches the total amount paid.\n\nSo, the answer should be 4 Type A pens and 6 Type B pens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ Type A pens and } 6 \\text{ Type B pens}} \\]"
