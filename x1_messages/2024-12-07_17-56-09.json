        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a train traveling from station A to station C, with a stop in between at station B. The train moves at a constant speed of 60 km/h, and I need to find the total distance between A and C. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the train goes from station A to station B in 2 hours. Since it's moving at 60 km/h, I can calculate the distance between A and B by multiplying speed by time. So, distance from A to B is 60 km/h * 2 h = 120 km.\n\nNext, the train stops at station B for 30 minutes. This is just a stop, so no distance is covered during this time. It's important to note that this stop time doesn't affect the distance calculation, only the total travel time if needed.\n\nAfter the stop, the train continues to station C, taking another 1 hour and 30 minutes. Again, the speed is 60 km/h. To find the distance from B to C, I need to convert 1 hour and 30 minutes into hours because the speed is in km per hour. 30 minutes is 0.5 hours, so total time is 1.5 hours. Therefore, distance from B to C is 60 km/h * 1.5 h = 90 km.\n\nNow, to find the total distance from A to C, I just need to add the distances from A to B and B to C. So, total distance = 120 km + 90 km = 210 km.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? The train stops for 30 minutes at station B, but since we're only asked for the total distance, not the total travel time, I don't think the stop time affects the distance calculation. The distance is solely based on the time spent moving and the speed.\n\nLet me double-check the times to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. From A to B: 2 hours. Stop at B: 0.5 hours. From B to C: 1.5 hours. If I were to calculate the total travel time, it would be 2 + 0.5 + 1.5 = 4 hours. But again, the question is about distance, not time.\n\nSo, confirming again: distance A to B is 120 km, distance B to C is 90 km, total distance A to C is 210 km.\n\nI think that's the answer. Simple enough, once I break it down like this.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{210} \\]"
