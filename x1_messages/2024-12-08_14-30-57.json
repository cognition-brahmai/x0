        "content": "The volume of a cylinder is calculated using the formula V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Given that the radius is 6 inches and the height is 10 inches, we can plug these values into the formula to find the volume.\n\nSo, V = \u03c0*(6 inches)\u00b2*(10 inches) = \u03c0*(36 square inches)*(10 inches) = \u03c0*(360 cubic inches).\n\nSince \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159, the volume would be approximately 3.14159 * 360 \u2248 1130.97 cubic inches.\n\nBut since the problem asks for the volume in terms of \u03c0, the exact volume is 360\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360\\pi} \\]"
