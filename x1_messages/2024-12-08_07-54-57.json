        "content": "The traditional use of origami in Japanese culture primarily signifies purity and good luck. Origami, which translates to \"folded paper,\" has a long history in Japan, dating back to the Heian period (794-1185). Initially, paper was a luxury item in Japan, and its use in origami reflected the high esteem in which it was held.\n\nIn religious ceremonies and rituals, origami was used to create various shapes and figures that held symbolic meanings. For example, the folding of paper cranes (orizuru) is a well-known origami tradition, with the crane being a symbol of longevity and fidelity in Japanese culture. According to Japanese tradition, folding 1,000 paper cranes grants the folder a wish, often related to health and longevity.\n\nMoreover, origami was also used in secular contexts, such as in the folding of noshi, a strip of folded paper that was attached to gifts to convey good fortune and was a symbol of celebration and festivity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. It symbolizes purity and good luck.\n\nOption A, \"It signifies the importance of nature in Japanese culture,\" is partially correct in that many origami designs are inspired by natural forms such as animals and plants, reflecting the deep connection between Japanese culture and nature. However, this option does not capture the primary symbolic\u610f\u4e49 of origami in traditional ceremonies and rituals.\n\nOption B, \"It represents the complexity of Japanese social structure,\" is not directly related to the traditional use of origami. While origami may have been practiced by different social classes in Japan, its use in religious ceremonies and rituals was more about the symbolic meanings attached to the folded paper rather than reflecting social structures.\n\nOption D, \"It reflects the transient nature of life,\" touches on a broader philosophical aspect often associated with Japanese culture, particularly through the concept of mono no aware, which appreciates the bittersweet beauty of things that are impermanent. While this may be applicable to some interpretations of origami, especially in the context of folding paper cranes for wishes and hopes, it is not the primary significance in traditional use.\n\nIn summary, while origami has multiple layers of meaning and can be associated with various cultural and philosophical ideas, its traditional use in Japanese religious ceremonies and rituals primarily symbolizes purity and good luck."
