        "content": "So you've got a rectangular garden that's 20 feet long and 10 feet wide, and you want to cover it with a 6-inch layer of soil. You're wondering how many square feet of soil you'll need. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, it's important to note that soil is typically measured in volume, not just area. So, while you might think of \"square feet\" for area, for soil depth, we need to consider cubic feet or cubic yards, which are measures of volume. But since you've asked for \"square feet of soil,\" I'll assume you're looking for the area coverage, but I need to clarify that.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's calculate both the area and the volume of soil needed.\n\n1. **Calculating the area:**\n\nThe area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 20 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 10 \\, \\text{feet} = 200 \\, \\text{square feet}\n\\]\n\nSo, the garden covers 200 square feet.\n\n2. **Calculating the volume of soil needed:**\n\nSince you want to add a 6-inch layer of soil, we need to find the volume of soil that covers 200 square feet to a depth of 6 inches.\n\nFirst, convert the depth from inches to feet because the area is in square feet.\n\n\\[\n6 \\, \\text{inches} = \\frac{6}{12} \\, \\text{feet} = 0.5 \\, \\text{feet}\n\\]\n\nNow, volume is area multiplied by depth.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Volume} = \\text{Area} \\times \\text{depth} = 200 \\, \\text{sq ft} \\times 0.5 \\, \\text{ft} = 100 \\, \\text{cubic feet}\n\\]\n\nSo, you would need 100 cubic feet of soil.\n\nBut since you asked for \"square feet of soil,\" perhaps you're thinking about how much soil to buy, and some suppliers sell soil by the cubic yard or even by the bag in cubic feet.\n\nJust to convert cubic feet to cubic yards (since 1 cubic yard = 27 cubic feet):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Volume in cubic yards} = \\frac{100}{27} \\approx 3.70 \\, \\text{cubic yards}\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, if soil is sold by the bag, and each bag is, say, 1 cubic foot, you would need 100 bags.\n\nBut to directly answer your question: if you're looking for the area coverage, it's 200 square feet, but for the volume of soil needed for a 6-inch layer, it's 100 cubic feet.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
