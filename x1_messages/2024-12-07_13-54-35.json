        "content": "Alright, I have this task to create a Java application that interacts with a MariaDB database to manage book information. The app should let users add books, list all books, and search for books by title or author through a command-line interface. I need to make sure that it's simple and straightforward since it's a basic application.\n\nFirst, I need to set up the MariaDB database. I should create a database and a table to store the book information. The table should have columns for the book's title, author, and publication year. I need to decide on the data types for each column. For example, title and author can be varchar types, and the publication year can be an integer.\n\nHere's a rough SQL statement to create the table:\n\n```sql\nCREATE DATABASE booksDB;\n\nUSE booksDB;\n\nCREATE TABLE books (\n    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    author VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    publication_year INT\n);\n```\n\nI'm including an 'id' field as the primary key, which will automatically increment for each new book entry. This will help in uniquely identifying each book in the database.\n\nNext, I need to set up the Java application. Since it's a command-line application, I'll use the Scanner class to read user inputs. The application should present a menu to the user with options to add a book, list all books, search by title, search by author, and maybe an option to exit the program.\n\nI need to make sure that the application can connect to the MariaDB database using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). I'll need to include the MariaDB JDBC driver in my project. If I'm using Maven, I can add the dependency in the pom.xml file.\n\nHere's an example of how to include the MariaDB JDBC driver in Maven:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.mariadb.jdbc</groupId>\n    <artifactId>mariadb-java-client</artifactId>\n    <version>2.7.3</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nNow, I need to write the Java code to handle database operations. I'll create methods for adding a book, retrieving all books, searching by title, and searching by author.\n\nFor adding a book, I'll need to take input for title, author, and publication year, and then insert these values into the 'books' table.\n\nFor listing all books, I'll retrieve all rows from the 'books' table and display them.\n\nFor searching by title or author, I'll take the search query from the user and execute a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause to filter the results.\n\nI should also handle any exceptions that might occur during database operations, such as connection errors or SQL syntax errors.\n\nLet me sketch a basic outline of the Java class:\n\n```java\nimport java.sql.*;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class BookManager {\n\n    // Database URL, username, and password\n    private static final String URL = \"jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/booksDB\";\n    private static final String USER = \"your_username\";\n    private static final String PASSWORD = \"your_password\";\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        Connection connection = null;\n\n        try {\n            // Establish connection\n            connection = DriverManager.getConnection(URL, USER, PASSWORD);\n\n            while (true) {\n                System.out.println(\"\\nBook Manager Menu:\");\n                System.out.println(\"1. Add Book\");\n                System.out.println(\"2. List All Books\");\n                System.out.println(\"3. Search by Title\");\n                System.out.println(\"4. Search by Author\");\n                System.out.println(\"5. Exit\");\n                System.out.print(\"Enter your choice: \");\n\n                int choice = scanner.nextInt();\n                scanner.nextLine(); // Consume newline\n\n                switch (choice) {\n                    case 1:\n                        addBook(scanner, connection);\n                        break;\n                    case 2:\n                        listAllBooks(connection);\n                        break;\n                    case 3:\n                        searchByTitle(scanner, connection);\n                        break;\n                    case 4:\n                        searchByAuthor(scanner, connection);\n                        break;\n                    case 5:\n                        System.exit(0);\n                        break;\n                    default:\n                        System.out.println(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\");\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (SQLException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        } finally {\n            if (connection != null) {\n                try {\n                    connection.close();\n                } catch (SQLException e) {\n                    e.printStackTrace();\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static void addBook(Scanner scanner, Connection connection) throws SQLException {\n        System.out.print(\"Enter title: \");\n        String title = scanner.nextLine();\n        System.out.print(\"Enter author: \");\n        String author = scanner.nextLine();\n        System.out.print(\"Enter publication year: \");\n        int year = scanner.nextInt();\n        scanner.nextLine(); // Consume newline\n\n        String sql = \"INSERT INTO books (title, author, publication_year) VALUES (?, ?, ?)\";\n        try (PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(sql)) {\n            statement.setString(1, title);\n            statement.setString(2, author);\n            statement.setInt(3, year);\n            statement.executeUpdate();\n            System.out.println(\"Book added successfully.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static void listAllBooks(Connection connection) throws SQLException {\n        String sql = \"SELECT * FROM books\";\n        try (Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n             ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(sql)) {\n            while (resultSet.next()) {\n                int id = resultSet.getInt(\"id\");\n                String title = resultSet.getString(\"title\");\n                String author = resultSet.getString(\"author\");\n                int year = resultSet.getInt(\"publication_year\");\n                System.out.printf(\"%d: %s by %s (%d)\\n\", id, title, author, year);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static void searchByTitle(Scanner scanner, Connection connection) throws SQLException {\n        System.out.print(\"Enter title to search: \");\n        String title = scanner.nextLine();\n        String sql = \"SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE ?\";\n        try (PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(sql)) {\n            statement.setString(1, \"%\" + title + \"%\");\n            try (ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery()) {\n                while (resultSet.next()) {\n                    int id = resultSet.getInt(\"id\");\n                    String bookTitle = resultSet.getString(\"title\");\n                    String author = resultSet.getString(\"author\");\n                    int year = resultSet.getInt(\"publication_year\");\n                    System.out.printf(\"%d: %s by %s (%d)\\n\", id, bookTitle, author, year);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static void searchByAuthor(Scanner scanner, Connection connection) throws SQLException {\n        System.out.print(\"Enter author to search: \");\n        String author = scanner.nextLine();\n        String sql = \"SELECT * FROM books WHERE author LIKE ?\";\n        try (PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(sql)) {\n            statement.setString(1, \"%\" + author + \"%\");\n            try (ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery()) {\n                while (resultSet.next()) {\n                    int id = resultSet.getInt(\"id\");\n                    String title = resultSet.getString(\"title\");\n                    String bookAuthor = resultSet.getString(\"author\");\n                    int year = resultSet.getInt(\"publication_year\");\n                    System.out.printf(\"%d: %s by %s (%d)\\n\", id, title, bookAuthor, year);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- I've defined a `BookManager` class with a `main` method that sets up the database connection and presents a menu to the user.\n\n- The `addBook` method takes user input for title, author, and publication year, and inserts a new row into the 'books' table.\n\n- The `listAllBooks` method retrieves and prints all books in the database.\n\n- The `searchByTitle` and `searchByAuthor` methods allow users to search for books based on partial matches of the title or author.\n\nI need to make sure that the database connection details (URL, USER, PASSWORD) are correctly set according to the local MariaDB setup.\n\nAlso, I should handle cases where the user enters invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values for the publication year.\n\nAdditionally, it's a good practice to close database resources properly to avoid leaks. In the code above, I'm using try-with-resources statements for statements and result sets to ensure they are closed automatically.\n\nOnce the database is set up and the Java code is written, I can compile and run the application to test its functionality.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Java application that interacts with a MariaDB database to manage book information, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the MariaDB Database\n\n1. **Install MariaDB** if not already installed.\n2. **Create a database** and a table to store book information.\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE DATABASE booksDB;\n   USE booksDB;\n\n   CREATE TABLE books (\n       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n       title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n       author VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n       publication_year INT\n   );\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Set Up the Java Project\n\n1. **Create a new Java project** in your preferred IDE.\n2. **Add the MariaDB JDBC driver** to your project dependencies. If using Maven, include the following dependency in your `pom.xml`:\n\n   ```xml\n   <dependency>\n       <groupId>org.mariadb.jdbc</groupId>\n       <artifactId>mariadb-java-client</artifactId>\n       <version>2.7.3</version>\n   </dependency>\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Implement the Java Application\n\nCreate a class named `BookManager` with the following code:\n\n```java\nimport java.sql.*;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class BookManager {\n\n    // Database URL, username, and password\n    private static final String URL = \"jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/booksDB\";\n    private static final String USER = \"your_username\";\n    private static final String PASSWORD = \"your_password\";\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        Connection connection = null;\n\n        try {\n            // Establish connection\n            connection = DriverManager.getConnection(URL, USER, PASSWORD);\n\n            while (true) {\n                System.out.println(\"\\nBook Manager Menu:\");\n                System.out.println(\"1. Add Book\");\n                System.out.println(\"2. List All Books\");\n                System.out.println(\"3. Search by Title\");\n                System.out.println(\"4. Search by Author\");\n                System.out.println(\"5. Exit\");\n                System.out.print(\"Enter your choice: \");\n\n                int choice = scanner.nextInt();\n                scanner.nextLine(); // Consume newline\n\n                switch (choice) {\n                    case 1:\n                        addBook(scanner, connection);\n                        break;\n                    case 2:\n                        listAllBooks(connection);\n                        break;\n                    case 3:\n                        searchByTitle(scanner, connection);\n                        break;\n                    case 4:\n                        searchByAuthor(scanner, connection);\n                        break;\n                    case 5:\n                        System.exit(0);\n                        break;\n                    default:\n                        System.out.println(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\");\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (SQLException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        } finally {\n            if (connection != null) {\n                try {\n                    connection.close();\n                } catch (SQLException e) {\n                    e.printStackTrace();\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static void addBook(Scanner scanner, Connection connection) throws SQLException {\n        System.out.print(\"Enter title: \");\n        String title = scanner.nextLine();\n        System.out.print(\"Enter author: \");\n        String author = scanner.nextLine();\n        System.out.print(\"Enter publication year: \");\n        int year = scanner.nextInt();\n        scanner.nextLine(); // Consume newline\n\n        String sql = \"INSERT INTO books (title, author, publication_year) VALUES (?, ?, ?)\";\n        try (PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(sql)) {\n            statement.setString(1, title);\n            statement.setString(2, author);\n            statement.setInt(3, year);\n            statement.executeUpdate();\n            System.out.println(\"Book added successfully.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static void listAllBooks(Connection connection) throws SQLException {\n        String sql = \"SELECT * FROM books\";\n        try (Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n             ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(sql)) {\n            while (resultSet.next()) {\n                int id = resultSet.getInt(\"id\");\n                String title = resultSet.getString(\"title\");\n                String author = resultSet.getString(\"author\");\n                int year = resultSet.getInt(\"publication_year\");\n                System.out.printf(\"%d: %s by %s (%d)\\n\", id, title, author, year);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static void searchByTitle(Scanner scanner, Connection connection) throws SQLException {\n        System.out.print(\"Enter title to search: \");\n        String title = scanner.nextLine();\n        String sql = \"SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE ?\";\n        try (PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(sql)) {\n            statement.setString(1, \"%\" + title + \"%\");\n            try (ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery()) {\n                while (resultSet.next()) {\n                    int id = resultSet.getInt(\"id\");\n                    String bookTitle = resultSet.getString(\"title\");\n                    String author = resultSet.getString(\"author\");\n                    int year = resultSet.getInt(\"publication_year\");\n                    System.out.printf(\"%d: %s by %s (%d)\\n\", id, bookTitle, author, year);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static void searchByAuthor(Scanner scanner, Connection connection) throws SQLException {\n        System.out.print(\"Enter author to search: \");\n        String author = scanner.nextLine();\n        String sql = \"SELECT * FROM books WHERE author LIKE ?\";\n        try (PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(sql)) {\n            statement.setString(1, \"%\" + author + \"%\");\n            try (ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery()) {\n                while (resultSet.next()) {\n                    int id = resultSet.getInt(\"id\");\n                    String title = resultSet.getString(\"title\");\n                    String bookAuthor = resultSet.getString(\"author\");\n                    int year = resultSet.getInt(\"publication_year\");\n                    System.out.printf(\"%d: %s by %s (%d)\\n\", id, title, bookAuthor, year);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Run the Application\n\n1. **Compile the Java code**.\n2. **Run the `BookManager` class**.\n3. Use the command-line menu to add books, list all books, and search by title or author.\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Database Setup**: A MariaDB database named `booksDB` is created with a table `books` to store book details.\n- **Java Application**: A simple command-line application using JDBC to interact with the database.\n- **Features**:\n  - Add a new book.\n  - List all books in the database.\n  - Search for books by title or author with partial matching.\n  - Exit the application gracefully.\n\nThis application provides a basic interface for managing a collection of books, demonstrating database interactions in Java using JDBC."
