        "content": "So I have this problem here: a cone has a volume of 200 cubic centimeters and a height of 10 centimeters, and I need to find the radius of its base. Hmm, I remember there's a formula for the volume of a cone, but I'm a bit rusty on the details. Let me think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the volume of a cone. I think it's something like V = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius of the base, and h is the height. Yeah, that sounds right. Let me confirm that. Yes, I'm pretty sure that's the formula.\n\nSo, given that V = 200 cm\u00b3 and h = 10 cm, I need to find r. Plugging the known values into the formula, I get:\n\n200 = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2 * 10\n\nAlright, now I need to solve for r. Let me first simplify the equation. I can divide both sides by 10 to make it easier:\n\n200 / 10 = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2 * 10 / 10\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n20 = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2\n\nNow, to isolate r\u00b2, I can multiply both sides by 3:\n\n20 * 3 = \u03c0r\u00b2\n\n60 = \u03c0r\u00b2\n\nNext, I'll divide both sides by \u03c0 to solve for r\u00b2:\n\n60 / \u03c0 = r\u00b2\n\nNow, to find r, I need to take the square root of both sides:\n\nr = \u221a(60 / \u03c0)\n\nLet me calculate that value. First, I'll compute 60 divided by \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so:\n\n60 / 3.1416 \u2248 19.0986\n\nNow, taking the square root of 19.0986:\n\n\u221a19.0986 \u2248 4.3702\n\nSo, the radius is approximately 4.37 centimeters.\n\nWait a minute, let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from:\n\nV = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h\n\nPlugging in V = 200 and h = 10:\n\n200 = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2 * 10\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n20 = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n60 = \u03c0r\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by \u03c0:\n\n60 / \u03c0 = r\u00b2\n\nTake square root:\n\nr = \u221a(60 / \u03c0)\n\nCalculating 60 / \u03c0:\n\n60 / 3.1416 \u2248 19.0986\n\nThen, \u221a19.0986 \u2248 4.3702\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the exact value without approximation:\n\nr = \u221a(60 / \u03c0)\n\nWhich is approximately 4.3702 cm, as I calculated.\n\nBut maybe I can express it in terms of \u03c0 for exactness. Let's see.\n\nStarting from:\n\nr\u00b2 = 60 / \u03c0\n\nSo, r = \u221a(60 / \u03c0)\n\nWhich can also be written as:\n\nr = \u221a(60) / \u221a\u03c0\n\nOr, r = \u221a(60/\u03c0)\n\nBut I think the decimal approximation is sufficient for practical purposes.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using proportions or similar cones, but I don't think that's necessary here since we have the direct formula.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I can verify this by calculating the volume with r = 4.37 cm and h = 10 cm and see if it gives me approximately 200 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo, V = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h\n\nPlugging in r = 4.37 and h = 10:\n\nV = (1/3) * \u03c0 * (4.37)\u00b2 * 10\n\nFirst, (4.37)\u00b2 \u2248 19.0969\n\nThen, V = (1/3) * \u03c0 * 19.0969 * 10\n\nWhich is V = (1/3) * 3.1416 * 19.0969 * 10\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\nFirst, 3.1416 * 19.0969 \u2248 59.999 (approximately 60)\n\nThen, (1/3) * 60 = 20\n\nAnd finally, 20 * 10 = 200 cm\u00b3\n\nYes, that matches the original volume, so my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to be more precise, I can use more decimal places in \u03c0, but for most practical purposes, using \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416 is sufficient.\n\nSo, the radius of the base of the cone is approximately 4.37 centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4.37 \\text{ cm}} \\]"
