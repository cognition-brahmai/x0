During a solar eclipse, the Moon comes between the Earth and the Sun, casting a shadow on the Earth and obscuring the Sun's light. This can happen only at new moon, when the Sun and Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth. There are different types of solar eclipses, including total, partial, and annular eclipses, depending on the alignment and distances between the Earth, Moon, and Sun."
