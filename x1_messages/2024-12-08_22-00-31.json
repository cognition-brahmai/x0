        "content": "The world's largest coral reef system, which includes over 2,900 individual reefs, is located off the coast of Australia. This magnificent structure is known as the Great Barrier Reef. It stretches over 2,300 kilometers (about 1,400 miles) and covers an area roughly the size of Italy or Japan. The Great Barrier Reef is not only a natural wonder but also a vital ecosystem that supports a diverse range of marine life. It's important to note that while Australia is the country closest to the Great Barrier Reef, the reef itself is a natural formation and not confined within any national boundaries. The Australian government, along with international partners, plays a significant role in its conservation and management."
