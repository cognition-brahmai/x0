        "content": "I'm stumped by this one. It's a riddle, right? \"We are all around, yet to us you are half blind. Sunlight makes us invisible, and difficult to find.\" Hmm, let's see. So, it's something that's everywhere around us, but we can't see it easily, especially in sunlight. And there's this part about being \"half blind\" to it. Maybe it's related to perception or something environmental.\n\nFirst, think about things that are all around us. Air, for example, is always around, but we can't see it. But sunlight makes air even less visible because light passes through it without scattering much, unless there's dust or something. Wait, but the riddle says that sunlight makes it invisible and difficult to find, so air might be a possibility.\n\nBut then there's the part about being \"half blind\" to it. I'm not sure what that means. Maybe it's referring to how we only perceive certain aspects of it, hence being \"half blind.\" Or perhaps it's something that affects only part of our body, like one of our senses.\n\nAnother angle: could it be sound? Sound is all around us, and in sunlight, which is bright, maybe sounds are drowned out or something. But that doesn't quite fit with being \"half blind.\" Sight and sound are different senses, so maybe not.\n\nWhat about shadows? Shadows are all around, especially in sunlight, but sunlight actually creates shadows. So, in sunlight, shadows become more prominent, but maybe in bright sunlight, some shadows become harder to see, especially if the light is directly overhead. But again, not sure about the \"half blind\" part.\n\nMaybe it's something related to vision itself. Like, our eyes have blind spots, but that doesn't seem to fit with being all around and affected by sunlight.\n\nWait, maybe it's ultraviolet light. UV light is all around us, especially in sunlight, but we can't see it because it's outside the visible spectrum. So, in a way, sunlight makes it invisible to us, and we're \"half blind\" to it because we can't see it without special equipment. That could make sense.\n\nBut then again, UV light isn't something we interact with directly; it's more of a scientific concept for many people. Maybe it's something more tangible.\n\nAnother thought: could it be heat? Heat is all around us, and in sunlight, heat increases, making it harder to perceive individual sources of heat. Plus, we're \"half blind\" to heat because we can only feel it through touch, not see it directly.\n\nBut that seems a bit of a stretch. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet's look at the structure of the riddle. Each line seems to give a clue about what this thing is.\n\n1. \"We are all around, yet to us you are half blind.\" \u2013 It's ubiquitous, but we only perceive part of it or are somehow limited in our perception.\n\n2. \"Sunlight makes us invisible, and difficult to find.\" \u2013 In the presence of sunlight, it becomes hard to detect or see.\n\nPerhaps it's something that contrasts with sunlight or is overpowered by it.\n\nWait, what about reflections? Reflections are all around us, especially in urban environments with lots of glass buildings. But in sunlight, reflections can be blinding or hard to see clearly, making them difficult to find or perceive properly.\n\nThat could work. We're \"half blind\" to reflections because sometimes they dazzle us or make it hard to see what's actually there.\n\nBut then, reflections are visible; they're not made invisible by sunlight. In fact, sunlight often enhances reflections.\n\nMaybe not that either.\n\nWhat about something that disappears in sunlight? Like, perhaps it's something that only appears in low light conditions.\n\nFor example, stars. Stars are all around us in the sky, but during the day, when there's sunlight, they become invisible and difficult to find. And in a way, we're \"half blind\" to them because we can't see them during the day.\n\nBut the riddle says \"all around,\" which stars aren't necessarily, since they're in the sky. Also, stars aren't directly affected by sunlight; they're just outshone by it.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe it's something more abstract. Like, perhaps it's ideas or thoughts. Ideas are all around us, in the sense that they're shared and pervasive in culture. But in the \"sunlight\" of public scrutiny or rational thought, some ideas become invisible or hard to find because they're either too obvious or too obscure.\n\nBut that seems too vague.\n\nWait, perhaps it's something related to vision or perception.\n\nWhat about glare? Glare is caused by sunlight and can make things difficult to see. It's all around, especially on bright days, and sunlight makes it worse, making things invisible or hard to find.\n\nAlso, we're \"half blind\" to glare because it impairs our vision.\n\nThat seems promising.\n\nLet me check:\n\n- Glare is all around on a sunny day.\n\n- We're \"half blind\" to it because it impairs our vision.\n\n- Sunlight makes it invisible in the sense that it's so bright it washes out details.\n\n- And it's difficult to find or locate specific things because of the glare.\n\nYes, that fits well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's something related to the way our eyes work in sunlight.\n\nFor instance, our pupils constrict in sunlight to reduce the amount of light entering the eye, which can affect our peripheral vision or depth perception.\n\nBut that seems more like a physiological response rather than an external entity.\n\nWait, maybe it's something related to the way sunlight affects our vision.\n\nLike, perhaps it's shadows again, but considered differently.\n\nShadows are all around in sunlight, but they're hard to see clearly sometimes, especially if the light is coming from many directions.\n\nBut I don't know.\n\nGlare still seems the most fitting answer.\n\nSo, my guess is glare.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{glare}} \\]"
