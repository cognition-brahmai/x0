        "content": "In Greek mythology, the three-headed dog that guards the entrance to the underworld is named Cerberus. He is the offspring of the monsters Echidna and Typhon and is often depicted as having three heads, although some variations describe him having multiple heads or even a serpent's tail. Cerberus's primary role is to ensure that the souls of the deceased remain in the underworld and that no living being can enter without permission. The famous hero Heracles (or Hercules in Roman mythology) included capturing Cerberus as one of his twelve labors, which he accomplished by subduing the dog with his strength and kindness."
