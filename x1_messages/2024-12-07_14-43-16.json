        "content": "Certainly! To calculate the area of a triangle when you know its base and height, you can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n\\]\n\nIn Python, you can implement this as a function that takes the base and height as arguments and returns the calculated area. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef triangle_area(base, height):\n    return 0.5 * base * height\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing the base and height of the triangle as arguments. For example:\n\n```python\narea = triangle_area(10, 5)\nprint(area)  # Output: 25.0\n```\n\nThis function multiplies the base by the height and then by 0.5 to get the area of the triangle."
