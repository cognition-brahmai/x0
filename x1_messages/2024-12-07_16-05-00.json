The Tigris is one of the two main rivers that define the Fertile Crescent, the other being the Euphrates. These rivers have played a crucial role in the development of ancient civilizations in the region, including the Mesopotamian civilization, which is often regarded as one of the earliest cradles of civilization. Baghdad, located along the Tigris, has been a significant center of culture, learning, and commerce for centuries."
