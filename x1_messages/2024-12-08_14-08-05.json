        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 8 defective items and 12 non-defective items, making a total of 20 items. I need to find the probability that when I randomly select 3 items, at least one of them is defective.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"at least one defective\" means. It means that in the three items I pick, there could be one defective, two defective, or all three defective. So, I need to find the probability of having one or more defective items.\n\nOne way to approach this is to calculate the probability of each possible scenario where there's at least one defective item and then add them up. That would be:\n\n- Probability of exactly one defective item\n\n- Plus probability of exactly two defective items\n\n- Plus probability of exactly three defective items\n\nBut that seems a bit cumbersome. There might be a simpler way.\n\nWait, I remember that \"at least one\" probabilities can often be found more easily by subtracting the probability of none from 1. So, in this case, the probability of at least one defective item would be 1 minus the probability of selecting no defective items in the three selections.\n\nThat sounds promising. So, let's try that.\n\nFirst, I need to find the probability of selecting no defective items, which means selecting all non-defective items in the three selections.\n\nThere are 12 non-defective items and 8 defective items, making 20 items in total.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 non-defective items out of 12 is given by the combination formula C(12,3), which is 12 choose 3.\n\nSimilarly, the total number of ways to choose any 3 items out of 20 is C(20,3), which is 20 choose 3.\n\nSo, the probability of selecting all non-defective items is C(12,3) divided by C(20,3).\n\nThen, the probability of at least one defective item is 1 minus that probability.\n\nLet me calculate C(12,3) and C(20,3).\n\nC(n,k) is calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!), where \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\nSo, C(12,3) = 12! / (3! * 9!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 220.\n\nAnd C(20,3) = 20! / (3! * 17!) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 1140.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting all non-defective items is 220 / 1140 = approximately 0.19298.\n\nSo, the probability of at least one defective item is 1 - 0.19298 = approximately 0.80702.\n\nBut maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to use probabilities step by step, considering the selections one at a time.\n\nFor example, the probability that the first item selected is defective is 8/20.\n\nBut wait, since I'm looking for at least one defective, it might be more complicated to calculate directly this way, especially since the selections are without replacement.\n\nI think the initial approach using combinations is simpler and more straightforward for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability of exactly one defective, exactly two defective, and exactly three defective, and then add them up.\n\nLet's try that to confirm.\n\nFirst, probability of exactly one defective:\n\nNumber of ways to choose one defective out of eight: C(8,1) = 8.\n\nNumber of ways to choose two non-defective out of twelve: C(12,2) = 66.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose three items out of twenty: C(20,3) = 1140.\n\nSo, probability of exactly one defective is (8 \u00d7 66) / 1140 = 528 / 1140 \u2248 0.46316.\n\nNext, probability of exactly two defective:\n\nNumber of ways to choose two defective out of eight: C(8,2) = 28.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one non-defective out of twelve: C(12,1) = 12.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose three items: C(20,3) = 1140.\n\nSo, probability of exactly two defective is (28 \u00d7 12) / 1140 = 336 / 1140 \u2248 0.29474.\n\nThen, probability of exactly three defective:\n\nNumber of ways to choose three defective out of eight: C(8,3) = 56.\n\nNumber of ways to choose zero non-defective out of twelve: C(12,0) = 1.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose three items: C(20,3) = 1140.\n\nSo, probability of exactly three defective is 56 / 1140 \u2248 0.04912.\n\nNow, adding these up: 0.46316 + 0.29474 + 0.04912 = approximately 0.80702.\n\nThis matches the previous result of 1 - (220 / 1140) = 1 - 0.19298 = 0.80702.\n\nSo, both approaches give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting at least one defective item when choosing three items at random from the box is approximately 0.807 or 80.7%.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.807} \\]"
