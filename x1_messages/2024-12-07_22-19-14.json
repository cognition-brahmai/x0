        "content": "So there are 100 books on the shelf. 40% of them are fiction, and the rest are non-fiction. I need to find out how many are non-fiction.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many books are fiction. Since 40% are fiction, I can calculate that by taking 40% of 100. \n\nTo calculate 40% of 100, I can multiply 100 by 0.40 (because 40% is the same as 0.40 in decimal form).\n\nSo, 100 times 0.40 equals 40. That means there are 40 fiction books.\n\nNow, to find the number of non-fiction books, I can subtract the number of fiction books from the total number of books.\n\nTotal books are 100, and fiction books are 40, so 100 minus 40 equals 60.\n\nTherefore, there are 60 non-fiction books.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe I can directly calculate the percentage of non-fiction books.\n\nIf 40% are fiction, then the remaining percentage must be non-fiction. Since the total is 100%, non-fiction books would be 100% minus 40%, which is 60%.\n\nSo, 60% of the books are non-fiction. To find out how many that is, I can calculate 60% of 100.\n\nAgain, 60% of 100 is 60.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer: there are 60 non-fiction books.\n\nI think that makes sense. But just to be thorough, maybe I can check if the numbers add up.\n\nFiction books: 40\n\nNon-fiction books: 60\n\nTotal: 40 + 60 = 100, which matches the total number of books.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
