        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got 120 passengers on a train, and 75% of them have first-class tickets, while the remaining 25% have second-class tickets. The train has 8 first-class cabins and 4 second-class cabins, and we need to find out how many passengers are in each cabin on average.\n\nFirst, I'll figure out how many passengers have first-class tickets and how many have second-class tickets.\n\nGiven that 75% of the passengers have first-class tickets:\n\nNumber of first-class passengers = 75% of 120 = 0.75 \u00d7 120 = 90 passengers.\n\nTherefore, the remaining 25% have second-class tickets:\n\nNumber of second-class passengers = 25% of 120 = 0.25 \u00d7 120 = 30 passengers.\n\nNow, we have 8 first-class cabins and 4 second-class cabins.\n\nTo find the average number of passengers per first-class cabin:\n\nAverage first-class cabin passengers = total first-class passengers / number of first-class cabins = 90 / 8 = 11.25 passengers per cabin.\n\nSimilarly, for second-class cabins:\n\nAverage second-class cabin passengers = total second-class passengers / number of second-class cabins = 30 / 4 = 7.5 passengers per cabin.\n\nSo, on average, there are 11.25 passengers in each first-class cabin and 7.5 passengers in each second-class cabin.\n\nBut wait, averages can be decimal numbers, especially when dividing passengers into cabins. In reality, you can't have a fraction of a passenger, but since the question asks for an average, this is acceptable.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal passengers: 120.\n\nFirst-class passengers: 75% of 120 = 90.\n\nSecond-class passengers: 25% of 120 = 30.\n\nFirst-class cabins: 8.\n\nSecond-class cabins: 4.\n\nAverage first-class cabin passengers: 90 / 8 = 11.25.\n\nAverage second-class cabin passengers: 30 / 4 = 7.5.\n\nEverything seems to add up correctly.\n\nI think that's the answer: on average, there are 11.25 passengers in each first-class cabin and 7.5 passengers in each second-class cabin.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11.25 \\text{ passengers per first-class cabin and } 7.5 \\text{ passengers per second-class cabin}} \\]"
