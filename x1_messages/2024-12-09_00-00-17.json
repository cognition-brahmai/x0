        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a town with 12,000 people, and 30% of them are vegetarians. That means the rest are non-vegetarians, right? So first, I need to find out how many people are non-vegetarians.\n\nIf 30% are vegetarians, then the percentage that are non-vegetarians is 100% - 30% = 70%. So, 70% of the town's population are non-vegetarians.\n\nNow, to find out how many people that is, I'll calculate 70% of 12,000.\n\n70% of 12,000 is (70/100) * 12,000 = 0.7 * 12,000 = 8,400.\n\nSo, there are 8,400 non-vegetarians in the town.\n\nOut of these non-vegetarians, 40% prefer chicken over other meats. So, I need to find out what 40% of 8,400 is.\n\n40% of 8,400 is (40/100) * 8,400 = 0.4 * 8,400 = 3,360.\n\nTherefore, 3,360 people in the town prefer chicken.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total population is 12,000.\n\nVegetarians are 30% of 12,000, which is 0.3 * 12,000 = 3,600.\n\nNon-vegetarians are 12,000 - 3,600 = 8,400.\n\nNow, 40% of these 8,400 prefer chicken, which is 0.4 * 8,400 = 3,360.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of people who prefer chicken is 3,360.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3360} \\]"
