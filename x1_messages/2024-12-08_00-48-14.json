        "content": "So I've got this problem here about shipping containers from a port to a warehouse. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are 200 containers that need to be transported, and each container weighs 20 tons. But actually, the weight might not be directly relevant for the number of trips, unless there are weight restrictions on the trucks. But according to the problem, each truck can carry up to 5 containers at once, regardless of weight, so I think we can focus on the number of containers per trip.\n\nSo, each truck can carry 5 containers per trip, and the company can make 10 trips per day. So, the number of containers transported per day would be:\n\n5 containers/trip \u00d7 10 trips/day = 50 containers/day\n\nNow, with 200 containers to transport, the number of days required would be:\n\n200 containers \u00f7 50 containers/day = 4 days\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the fuel cost for this operation. To do that, I need to know how much fuel is consumed in total and then multiply by the price per gallon.\n\nFirst, let's find out the distance involved. The warehouse is 50 miles away from the port. However, since the trucks have to go from the port to the warehouse and probably return to the port for another load, it's a round trip. So, the total distance per trip is:\n\n50 miles (to the warehouse) + 50 miles (back to the port) = 100 miles per trip\n\nNow, each truck makes 10 trips per day, so the daily mileage per truck is:\n\n100 miles/trip \u00d7 10 trips/day = 1,000 miles/day\n\nNext, I need to know the fuel consumption. The problem states that each truck consumes 6 miles per gallon of diesel fuel. So, the fuel used per day per truck is:\n\n1,000 miles/day \u00f7 6 miles/gallon = approximately 166.67 gallons/day\n\nNow, the price of diesel is $3.50 per gallon, so the daily fuel cost per truck is:\n\n166.67 gallons/day \u00d7 $3.50/gallon = approximately $583.33/day\n\nBut wait, I need to find out the total fuel cost for the entire operation, which takes 4 days. So, the total fuel cost per truck would be:\n\n$583.33/day \u00d7 4 days = $2,333.32\n\nHowever, I need to consider whether there is only one truck or multiple trucks being used. The problem says the company has access to trucks capable of carrying up to 5 containers at once, but it doesn't specify how many trucks they have. It only mentions that they can make 10 trips per day.\n\nIf they have multiple trucks, and they can make 10 trips per day in total, then perhaps they have multiple trucks working together to achieve those 10 trips per day. But to simplify, maybe they have one truck that can make 10 trips per day. But that seems unlikely for a truck to make 10 round trips of 100 miles each in a day, but maybe it's possible with a relay team or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they have multiple trucks working simultaneously, and together they can make 10 trips per day.\n\nBut to make this calculation, I think I need to assume that there is one truck making 10 trips per day. Otherwise, I would need to know how many trucks are being used.\n\nSo, assuming there is one truck, and it makes 10 trips per day, then the total fuel cost for that one truck over 4 days would be $2,333.32.\n\nBut maybe there are multiple trucks, and together they make 10 trips per day. In that case, I need to know how many trucks are there to calculate the total fuel cost.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem means that the company can make 10 trips per day in total, regardless of the number of trucks. So, if they have multiple trucks, the total number of trips per day is 10.\n\nBut to find out the total fuel cost, I need to know the total miles driven by all trucks combined.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nTotal trips needed: 200 containers \u00f7 5 containers/trip = 40 trips\n\nTotal days required: 40 trips \u00f7 10 trips/day = 4 days\n\nNow, for fuel cost:\n\nEach trip is 100 miles (round trip)\n\nTotal miles for all trips: 40 trips \u00d7 100 miles/trip = 4,000 miles\n\nNow, fuel consumption is 6 miles per gallon, so total gallons needed:\n\n4,000 miles \u00f7 6 miles/gallon = approximately 666.67 gallons\n\nTotal fuel cost: 666.67 gallons \u00d7 $3.50/gallon = approximately $2,333.34\n\nSo, the total fuel cost for the entire operation is approximately $2,333.34.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ days and } \\$2,333.34} \\]"
