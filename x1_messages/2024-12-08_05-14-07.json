        "content": "So the car factory produces 120 cars per day, and each car has four wheels. We need to find out how many wheels are produced in a month with 30 days. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many wheels are produced per day. Since each car has four wheels, and they produce 120 cars per day, I can multiply the number of cars by the number of wheels per car to get the daily wheel production.\n\nSo, wheels per day = number of cars per day \u00d7 wheels per car\n\nThat would be:\n\nwheels per day = 120 cars/day \u00d7 4 wheels/car\n\nwheels per day = 480 wheels/day\n\nOkay, that makes sense. Now, to find out how many wheels are produced in a month with 30 days, I need to multiply the daily wheel production by the number of days in the month.\n\nwheels per month = wheels per day \u00d7 number of days in the month\n\nSo,\n\nwheels per month = 480 wheels/day \u00d7 30 days\n\nwheels per month = 14,400 wheels\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total number of cars produced in a month and then multiply by the number of wheels per car.\n\nFirst, find the total number of cars produced in a month:\n\ncars per month = cars per day \u00d7 number of days in the month\n\ncars per month = 120 cars/day \u00d7 30 days\n\ncars per month = 3,600 cars\n\nThen, since each car has four wheels, the total number of wheels would be:\n\nwheels per month = cars per month \u00d7 wheels per car\n\nwheels per month = 3,600 cars \u00d7 4 wheels/car\n\nwheels per month = 14,400 wheels\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, it seems like 14,400 wheels are produced in a month.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect the number of wheels produced. For example, are there any days in the month where the factory doesn't produce cars, or maybe they produce more on certain days. But according to the problem, it's a steady production of 120 cars per day for 30 days, so no need to account for variations.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies that each car has four wheels, so I don't need to consider any variations in the number of wheels per car.\n\nTherefore, the total number of wheels produced in a month is 14,400.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14400} \\]"
