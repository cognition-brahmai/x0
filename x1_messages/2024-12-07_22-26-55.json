        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a train traveling between Town A and Town B. It goes from A to B at 60 mph, and the distance is 180 miles. Then it comes back from B to A at 90 mph. I need to find the average speed for the whole round trip.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, I need to find the total distance and the total time for the round trip.\n\nThe distance from A to B is 180 miles, and the return trip is also 180 miles, so the total distance is 180 + 180 = 360 miles.\n\nNow, I need to find the time taken for each leg of the trip.\n\nGoing from A to B at 60 mph:\n\nTime = distance / speed = 180 miles / 60 mph = 3 hours.\n\nReturning from B to A at 90 mph:\n\nTime = distance / speed = 180 miles / 90 mph = 2 hours.\n\nSo, the total time for the round trip is 3 hours + 2 hours = 5 hours.\n\nNow, average speed = total distance / total time = 360 miles / 5 hours = 72 mph.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that when speeds are different for the same distance, the average speed isn't just the arithmetic mean. Maybe I should use the harmonic mean for speeds.\n\nLet me think about this again.\n\nThe formula for average speed is indeed total distance over total time. But sometimes, especially when the distances are the same but speeds are different, there's a shortcut using harmonic mean.\n\nThe harmonic mean for two speeds is 2/(1/v1 + 1/v2).\n\nSo, for speeds v1 and v2, the harmonic mean is 2/(1/60 + 1/90).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, find 1/60 + 1/90.\n\n1/60 + 1/90 = (3/180) + (2/180) = 5/180 = 1/36.\n\nSo, harmonic mean = 2 / (1/36) = 72 mph.\n\nOkay, so that matches my earlier calculation. So, the average speed is 72 mph.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nTotal distance is 360 miles.\n\nTotal time is 5 hours.\n\n360 / 5 = 72 mph.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might think to take the average of the two speeds, which would be (60 + 90)/2 = 75 mph, but that's incorrect for average speed in this case because the times are different for each leg.\n\nThe train goes faster on the return trip, so it takes less time, which means it spends more time traveling at the slower speed.\n\nTherefore, the average speed is closer to the slower speed.\n\nSo, 72 mph is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]"
