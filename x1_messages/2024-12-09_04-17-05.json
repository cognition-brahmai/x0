        "content": "So, the company sells 1500 widgets each month at $20 per widget, and it costs them $10 to produce each widget. We need to find out their monthly profit.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the total revenue. Revenue is the income from selling the widgets, so we multiply the number of widgets sold by the price per widget. That would be 1500 widgets times $20 per widget.\n\n1500 * 20 = 30,000\n\nSo, the total revenue is $30,000 per month.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total production costs. That's the cost to make each widget multiplied by the number of widgets produced. So, $10 per widget times 1500 widgets.\n\n1500 * 10 = 15,000\n\nTherefore, the total production costs are $15,000 per month.\n\nNow, profit is revenue minus costs. So, we subtract the total production costs from the total revenue.\n\n30,000 - 15,000 = 15,000\n\nTherefore, the company's monthly profit is $15,000.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? Let's make sure we haven't missed anything. Are there any other costs involved, like overheads or taxes? The question only mentions production costs of $10 per widget, so perhaps for this scenario, we're only considering the direct production costs.\n\nBut in reality, companies have other expenses like rent, utilities, salaries, marketing, and so on. However, since these aren't mentioned in the problem, I guess we can assume that only production costs are deducted from the revenue to calculate profit.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes profit is calculated by subtracting all expenses, not just production costs. But based on the information provided, it seems like we're only dealing with production costs here.\n\nSo, sticking to the given data, revenue is $30,000, production costs are $15,000, and therefore profit is $15,000 per month.\n\nLet me just double-check the calculations to be sure.\n\nNumber of widgets: 1500\n\nSelling price per widget: $20\n\nTotal revenue: 1500 * 20 = $30,000\n\nProduction cost per widget: $10\n\nTotal production costs: 1500 * 10 = $15,000\n\nProfit: $30,000 - $15,000 = $15,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could calculate the profit per widget first and then multiply by the number of widgets.\n\nProfit per widget: Selling price - production cost = $20 - $10 = $10\n\nTotal profit: $10 per widget * 1500 widgets = $15,000\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, the monthly profit is $15,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15000} \\]"
