        "content": "So there are 4 people who speak English and 5 who speak French in a room, making a total of 9 people. I need to find the probability that if I pick any two people randomly, they can talk to each other in either English or French.\n\nFirst, I should understand what it means for them to communicate. They can communicate if both speak English, both speak French, or if one speaks English and the other speaks French, assuming that they can switch languages or something. But the problem doesn't specify if they can switch languages or if they need to speak the same language. I think for this problem, they need to speak the same language to communicate directly.\n\nSo, the favorable outcomes are:\n\n1. Both speak English.\n\n2. Both speak French.\n\nI won't consider the case where one speaks English and the other speaks French as a favorable outcome because they can't communicate directly in the same language.\n\nNow, to find the probability, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to choose 2 people out of 9. That's the combination of 9 choose 2.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, C(9, 2) = 9! / (2!(9 - 2)!) = (9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 7!) = (9 \u00d7 8) / 2 = 72 / 2 = 36.\n\nSo, there are 36 possible ways to choose 2 people out of 9.\n\nNow, let's find the number of favorable outcomes.\n\nFirst, both speak English: there are 4 English speakers, so the number of ways to choose 2 English speakers is C(4, 2).\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4 - 2)!) = (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2!)) = (4 \u00d7 3) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6.\n\nSo, there are 6 ways to choose 2 English speakers.\n\nNext, both speak French: there are 5 French speakers, so the number of ways to choose 2 French speakers is C(5, 2).\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5 - 2)!) = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 3!)) = (5 \u00d7 4) / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10.\n\nSo, there are 10 ways to choose 2 French speakers.\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 6 (English) + 10 (French) = 16.\n\nNow, the probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes, which is 16 / 36.\n\nThis can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 4: 16 \u00f7 4 = 4, 36 \u00f7 4 = 9.\n\nSo, the probability is 4/9.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that in some problems, people who speak both languages are considered, but here, it's 4 speak English and 5 speak French, and it's a total of 9 people. It seems like there are no overlaps, because 4 + 5 = 9, so no one speaks both languages.\n\nBut just to confirm: if there were people who spoke both languages, that would affect the counts, but in this case, since total is 9 and 4 + 5 = 9, it suggests no overlap.\n\nSo, my answer should be 4/9.\n\nBut maybe I should consider the possibility that some people might speak both languages, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just says 4 speak English and 5 speak French, and total is 9.\n\nIf some people speak both, then the counts would be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that some people might speak both languages, but the problem doesn't mention that, so I have to assume that there is no overlap unless specified.\n\nGiven that, my previous calculation stands: probability is 4/9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of probabilities.\n\nFirst, pick the first person: it can be anyone of the 9.\n\nThen, pick the second person: if the first speaks English, then the second must also speak English; if the first speaks French, the second must also speak French.\n\nSo, let's consider:\n\nProbability that the first person speaks English: 4/9.\n\nGiven that, the probability that the second person also speaks English is 3/8 (since one English speaker is already chosen).\n\nSimilarly, probability that the first person speaks French: 5/9.\n\nGiven that, the probability that the second person also speaks French is 4/8 = 1/2.\n\nSo, total probability is (4/9 \u00d7 3/8) + (5/9 \u00d7 1/2) = (12/72) + (5/18) = (12/72) + (20/72) = 32/72 = 4/9.\n\nAgain, I get 4/9.\n\nSo, I think 4/9 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{9}} \\]"
