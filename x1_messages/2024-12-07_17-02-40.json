        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the theme park has a budget of $15 million to build a new roller coaster. There are several costs involved here:\n\n1. Construction cost per linear foot of track: $1,500\n\n2. Land preparation: $2 million\n\n3. Ride vehicles: $3 million\n\n4. Theming elements: $4 million\n\nOur goal is to find out the maximum length of the roller coaster track that can be built within this $15 million budget, considering all these associated costs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what all these costs entail:\n\n- Construction cost is directly proportional to the length of the track. So, the longer the track, the higher this cost will be.\n\n- Land preparation, ride vehicles, and theming elements are fixed costs that don't change with the length of the track.\n\nSo, the total cost (TC) can be expressed as:\n\nTC = construction cost + land preparation + ride vehicles + theming elements\n\nGiven that the construction cost is $1,500 per linear foot, we can express it as:\n\nConstruction cost = $1,500 * length of the track (in feet)\n\nLet's denote the length of the track as L (in feet).\n\nSo,\n\nTC = ($1,500 * L) + $2,000,000 + $3,000,000 + $4,000,000\n\nSimplifying that:\n\nTC = $1,500L + $9,000,000\n\nNow, the total budget is $15 million, which is $15,000,000.\n\nSo, we need to ensure that TC \u2264 $15,000,000.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the inequality:\n\n$1,500L + $9,000,000 \u2264 $15,000,000\n\nOur task is to solve for L, the maximum length of the track.\n\nFirst, subtract $9,000,000 from both sides of the inequality:\n\n$1,500L \u2264 $15,000,000 - $9,000,000\n\n$1,500L \u2264 $6,000,000\n\nNow, divide both sides by $1,500 to solve for L:\n\nL \u2264 $6,000,000 / $1,500\n\nCalculating that:\n\nL \u2264 4,000 feet\n\nSo, the maximum length of the roller coaster track that can be built within the $15 million budget is 4,000 feet.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nTotal budget: $15,000,000\n\nFixed costs:\n\n- Land preparation: $2,000,000\n\n- Ride vehicles: $3,000,000\n\n- Theming elements: $4,000,000\n\nTotal fixed costs: $2,000,000 + $3,000,000 + $4,000,000 = $9,000,000\n\nRemaining budget for construction: $15,000,000 - $9,000,000 = $6,000,000\n\nConstruction cost per linear foot: $1,500\n\nTherefore, maximum length L = $6,000,000 / $1,500 per foot\n\nL = 4,000 feet\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can plug L = 4,000 feet back into the total cost equation to verify:\n\nTC = $1,500 * 4,000 + $9,000,000 = $6,000,000 + $9,000,000 = $15,000,000\n\nWhich matches the budget exactly.\n\nSo, the maximum length of the roller coaster track that can be built within the $15 million budget is 4,000 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4000 \\text{ feet}} \\]"
