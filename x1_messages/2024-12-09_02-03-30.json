        "content": "The term \"selfie\" originates from the word \"self\" and the suffix \"-ie,\" which is commonly used in English to denote endearment or smallness. It was first used in 2002 by an Australian man named Nathan Hope, who posted a picture of himself with a bloody lip on a internet forum, explaining that he had bumped into a door while taking a photo. The term quickly gained popularity, especially with the rise of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, where users could easily share self-portraits. In 2013, \"selfie\" was named the word of the year by the Oxford English Dictionary, reflecting its widespread usage and cultural significance."
