        "content": "Sure! Here are five common types of pasta along with a brief description of their shapes:\n\n1. **Spaghetti** - This is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. It's probably one of the most well-known types and is often served with tomato sauce or other simple sauces.\n\n2. **Fettuccine** - These are flat, wide ribbons of pasta, thicker than linguine. They are great for heartier sauces like Alfredo or creamy mushroom sauces.\n\n3. **Penne** - Penne is a type of tube-shaped pasta that's cut diagonally at both ends, giving it a slightly pointed shape. This shape helps capture sauces, making it versatile for various dishes, including pasta salads.\n\n4. **Ravioli** - Ravioli are small pouches of pasta made by placing a filling on a sheet of pasta dough and then topping it with another sheet of dough, which is then sealed. They can be filled with cheese, meat, vegetables, or other ingredients.\n\n5. **Lasagna** - Lasagna consists of wide, flat sheets of pasta that are layered with sauces, cheeses, and sometimes meats or vegetables to create a baked dish.\n\nEach type of pasta has its own unique characteristics and is suited to different types of sauces and preparations."
