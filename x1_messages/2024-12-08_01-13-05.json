        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 2000 units of product A and 1500 units of product B each month. For product A, each unit requires 3 hours of labor, and for product B, each unit requires 4 hours of labor. I need to find out the total labor hours required per year for both products combined.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the monthly labor hours for each product and then sum them up to get the total monthly labor hours. After that, I can multiply the total monthly labor hours by 12 to get the annual labor hours.\n\nSo, for product A:\n\nLabor hours per month = number of units * labor hours per unit\n\n= 2000 units * 3 hours/unit\n\n= 6000 hours\n\nFor product B:\n\nLabor hours per month = 1500 units * 4 hours/unit\n\n= 6000 hours\n\nNow, total monthly labor hours for both products:\n\nTotal monthly labor hours = labor hours for A + labor hours for B\n\n= 6000 hours + 6000 hours\n\n= 12,000 hours\n\nTo find the annual labor hours, I need to multiply the total monthly labor hours by 12:\n\nAnnual labor hours = total monthly labor hours * 12\n\n= 12,000 hours/month * 12 months/year\n\n= 144,000 hours/year\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there any other factor I should consider? Like holidays or overtime? The question doesn't mention anything about that, so I think assuming a standard monthly production is fine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should verify the calculations again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nProduct A: 2000 units * 3 hours/unit = 6000 hours\n\nProduct B: 1500 units * 4 hours/unit = 6000 hours\n\nTotal per month: 6000 + 6000 = 12,000 hours\n\nPer year: 12,000 hours/month * 12 months/year = 144,000 hours/year\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to calculate the total units produced per year for each product and then multiply by the labor hours per unit.\n\nFirst, find the annual production for each product:\n\nProduct A: 2000 units/month * 12 months/year = 24,000 units/year\n\nProduct B: 1500 units/month * 12 months/year = 18,000 units/year\n\nThen, calculate the labor hours:\n\nProduct A: 24,000 units/year * 3 hours/unit = 72,000 hours/year\n\nProduct B: 18,000 units/year * 4 hours/unit = 72,000 hours/year\n\nTotal annual labor hours: 72,000 + 72,000 = 144,000 hours/year\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that 144,000 hours per year is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{144000} \\]"
