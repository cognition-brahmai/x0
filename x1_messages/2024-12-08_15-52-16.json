        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a farmer has 120 meters of fencing and wants to create a rectangular enclosure for his sheep. I need to figure out what the maximum area he can enclose with that amount of fencing is. Alright, let's start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nFirst, I know that the farmer has a fixed amount of fencing, which is 120 meters, and he wants to use it to create a rectangle. The goal is to maximize the area inside that rectangle. So, I need to find the dimensions of the rectangle that will give me the largest possible area with a perimeter of 120 meters.\n\nI remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides. For a rectangle, that's 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. So, the formula for the perimeter is:\n\n\\[ P = 2l + 2w \\]\n\nwhere \\( l \\) is the length and \\( w \\) is the width. In this case, the perimeter is fixed at 120 meters, so:\n\n\\[ 2l + 2w = 120 \\]\n\nI can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ l + w = 60 \\]\n\nOkay, so the sum of the length and the width is 60 meters. Now, I need to express the area of the rectangle in terms of one variable so that I can maximize it. The area \\( a \\) of a rectangle is given by:\n\n\\[ a = l \\times w \\]\n\nFrom the simplified perimeter equation, I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for \\( w \\):\n\n\\[ w = 60 - l \\]\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( w \\) into the area formula:\n\n\\[ a = l \\times (60 - l) \\]\n\\[ a = 60l - l^2 \\]\n\nSo, the area \\( a \\) is a function of \\( l \\), and it's a quadratic equation in terms of \\( l \\). Quadratic equations graph as parabolas, and since the coefficient of \\( l^2 \\) is negative (-1), this parabola opens downwards, which means it has a maximum point at its vertex.\n\nThe vertex of a parabola given by \\( a = pl^2 + ql + r \\) occurs at \\( l = -\\frac{q}{2p} \\). In my equation, \\( a = -l^2 + 60l \\), so \\( p = -1 \\) and \\( q = 60 \\). Plugging these values into the vertex formula:\n\n\\[ l = -\\frac{60}{2 \\times (-1)} \\]\n\\[ l = -\\frac{60}{-2} \\]\n\\[ l = 30 \\]\n\nSo, the length that maximizes the area is 30 meters. Now, I can find the corresponding width using the earlier expression:\n\n\\[ w = 60 - l \\]\n\\[ w = 60 - 30 \\]\n\\[ w = 30 \\]\n\nWait a minute, so both the length and the width are 30 meters? That means the rectangle is actually a square. Is that right? I think so, because in geometry, for a given perimeter, a square encloses the maximum area. But let's verify the area calculation to make sure.\n\nThe area would be:\n\n\\[ a = l \\times w \\]\n\\[ a = 30 \\times 30 \\]\n\\[ a = 900 \\text{ square meters} \\]\n\nIs there a way to confirm that this is indeed the maximum area? Maybe I can try different values around 30 meters to see if the area increases or decreases.\n\nLet's try \\( l = 29 \\) meters:\n\n\\[ w = 60 - 29 = 31 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\\[ a = 29 \\times 31 = 899 \\text{ square meters} \\]\n\nThat's less than 900 square meters.\n\nNow, let's try \\( l = 31 \\) meters:\n\n\\[ w = 60 - 31 = 29 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\\[ a = 31 \\times 29 = 899 \\text{ square meters} \\]\n\nAgain, less than 900.\n\nWhat about \\( l = 25 \\) meters:\n\n\\[ w = 60 - 25 = 35 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\\[ a = 25 \\times 35 = 875 \\text{ square meters} \\]\n\nStill less.\n\nAnd \\( l = 35 \\) meters:\n\n\\[ w = 60 - 35 = 25 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\\[ a = 35 \\times 25 = 875 \\text{ square meters} \\]\n\nSame result.\n\nIt seems like whenever I deviate from \\( l = 30 \\) meters, the area decreases. Therefore, the maximum area is indeed 900 square meters when the rectangle is a square with sides of 30 meters each.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Perhaps using calculus to find the maximum area.\n\nIf I have the area function:\n\n\\[ a(l) = 60l - l^2 \\]\n\nI can find its derivative with respect to \\( l \\) and set it to zero to find the critical points.\n\nThe derivative of \\( a \\) with respect to \\( l \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{da}{dl} = 60 - 2l \\]\n\nSetting this equal to zero:\n\n\\[ 60 - 2l = 0 \\]\n\\[ 2l = 60 \\]\n\\[ l = 30 \\]\n\nSo, again, I get \\( l = 30 \\) meters as the critical point. To confirm that this is a maximum, I can check the second derivative:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d^2a}{dl^2} = -2 \\]\n\nSince the second derivative is negative, the function has a maximum at \\( l = 30 \\) meters.\n\nAlright, so both the algebraic approach and the calculus approach confirm that the maximum area is 900 square meters when the rectangle is a square with sides of 30 meters.\n\nI think that's the answer, but let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this. For example, is there a restriction on the dimensions of the rectangle that I'm not considering? The problem doesn't specify any constraints other than the perimeter being 120 meters, so I think the answer holds.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that for a given perimeter, the shape that encloses the maximum area is a circle. However, since the farmer wants a rectangular enclosure, a square is the best option among rectangles.\n\nTo find out how much larger the area of a circle would be with the same perimeter, I can calculate it for comparison.\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of a circle is given by:\n\n\\[ c = 2\\pi r \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius. Given that the circumference is 120 meters:\n\n\\[ 2\\pi r = 120 \\]\n\\[ r = \\frac{120}{2\\pi} \\]\n\\[ r = \\frac{60}{\\pi} \\]\n\nNow, the area of the circle is:\n\n\\[ a = \\pi r^2 \\]\n\\[ a = \\pi \\left( \\frac{60}{\\pi} \\right)^2 \\]\n\\[ a = \\pi \\times \\frac{3600}{\\pi^2} \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{3600}{\\pi} \\]\n\nUsing approximately \\( \\pi \\approx 3.1416 \\):\n\n\\[ a \\approx \\frac{3600}{3.1416} \\]\n\\[ a \\approx 1145.92 \\text{ square meters} \\]\n\nSo, a circle would enclose approximately 1145.92 square meters, which is larger than the 900 square meters of the square. However, since the farmer specifically wants a rectangular enclosure, the maximum area he can achieve is 900 square meters.\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum area the farmer can enclose with 120 meters of fencing, using a rectangular shape, is 900 square meters, achieved by creating a square enclosure with sides of 30 meters each.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{900} \\]"
