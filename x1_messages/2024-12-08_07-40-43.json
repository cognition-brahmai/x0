I hope you and the reindears are doing good up in the North Pole.\n\nI know this is the time when all my freinds write to you asking for toys, games or maybe a new bicycle. But this year, I don't want any of those things. Instead, there's something else that's really importnat to me.\n\nYou see, my mom and dad have been living in different houses for some time now. They say it's better this way but I miss how we used to be - a family. We used to do so many fun things together like going on picnics, playing board games on Sunday nights, and even decorating our Christmas tree. Now, everything feels different and a little bit lonley.\n\nSo, dear Santa, if you could, please help my parents find their way back to each other. I promise I've been very good this year. I've done all my homework, helped Mom with chores and even shared my favorite candy with my little sister, Lucy. I just wish for my family to be whole again.\n\nThank you, Santa. I beleive in you and your magic. And remember, no need to bring any presents for me under the tree. My only wish is for my parents to be happy together again.\n\nYour freind,\nJamie"
