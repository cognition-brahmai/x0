        "content": "So I've got this problem here: In a group of 30 people, how many ways can you form a committee of 5 members if one specific person must be included and another specific person must not be included?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We have 30 people in total, and we need to form a committee of 5. But there are two specific conditions: one specific person must be included, and another specific person must not be included.\n\nFirst, let's deal with the person who must be included. Since they have to be on the committee, we can think of them as already chosen. So, out of the 5 spots on the committee, one is already taken by this specific person. That means we only need to choose the remaining 4 members from the other people in the group.\n\nBut wait, there's another condition: another specific person must not be included. So, this person cannot be on the committee. So, we need to exclude them from the selection.\n\nLet's see: total people are 30. One specific person is already included in the committee, so we don't need to choose them again. Another specific person cannot be included, so they are excluded. That means the pool of people we can choose the remaining 4 members from is 30 total minus the one who must be included minus the one who must not be included. So, 30 - 1 - 1 = 28 people.\n\nWait, but the one who must be included is already on the committee, so we don't need to choose them again. And the one who must not be included is excluded from the selection. So, the remaining people to choose from are 30 - 2 = 28.\n\nBut, since the one who must be included is already on the committee, we only need to choose 4 more members from these 28 people.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 4 members from 28 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items to choose from, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 28 and k = 4.\n\nSo, the number of ways is C(28, 4).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 28! is a big number, but since we're dividing by 24! (because (28 - 4)! = 24!), many terms will cancel out.\n\nSo, C(28, 4) = 28! / (4! * 24!) = (28 * 27 * 26 * 25 * 24!) / (24! * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)) = (28 * 27 * 26 * 25) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1).\n\nNow, calculate numerator: 28 * 27 = 756, 756 * 26 = 19656, 19656 * 25 = 491400.\n\nDenominator: 4 * 3 = 12, 12 * 2 = 24, 24 * 1 = 24.\n\nSo, 491400 / 24 = 20475.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check my calculations.\n\n28 * 27 is indeed 756.\n\n756 * 26: let's calculate that again. 700 * 26 = 18200, 56 * 26 = 1456, total 18200 + 1456 = 19656.\n\n19656 * 25: 19656 * 20 = 393120, 19656 * 5 = 98280, total 393120 + 98280 = 491400.\n\nDenominator: 4! = 24.\n\nSo, 491400 / 24.\n\nLet's divide 491400 by 24.\n\nFirst, 24 * 20000 = 480000.\n\nSubtract: 491400 - 480000 = 11400.\n\n24 * 475 = 11400 (because 24 * 500 = 12000, which is too much, so 24 * 475 = 24 * 400 + 24 * 75 = 9600 + 1800 = 11400).\n\nSo, total is 20000 + 475 = 20475.\n\nWait, but I think I've miscalculated somewhere because 28 choose 4 should be 20475, but I recall that the formula might be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator or look up the combination formula again to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way to think about this.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nWe have 30 people.\n\nOne specific person must be included, so they are already on the committee.\n\nAnother specific person must not be included, so they are excluded.\n\nSo, total people to choose from are 30 - 2 = 28.\n\nBut since one is already included, we need to choose 4 more from these 28.\n\nSo, it's C(28, 4).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the one who must be included is already on the committee, and the one who must not be included is excluded, so we have 28 people to choose 4 from.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the number of ways is C(28, 4).\n\nNow, C(28, 4) is calculated as 28! / (4! * 24!) = (28 * 27 * 26 * 25) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = (28 * 27 * 26 * 25) / 24.\n\nCalculate numerator: 28 * 27 = 756.\n\n756 * 26 = 19656.\n\n19656 * 25 = 491,400.\n\nDenominator is 24.\n\nSo, 491,400 / 24.\n\nLet's do the division: 24 * 20,475 = 491,400.\n\nSo, the number of ways is 20,475.\n\nWait, but I think I recall that the combination C(28, 4) is 20,475, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a different approach to verify.\n\nLet me think about it differently.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose 5 people from 30 is C(30, 5).\n\nBut, we have constraints: one specific person must be included and another specific person must not be included.\n\nSo, let's adjust for the constraints.\n\nFirst, since one specific person must be included, we can think of them as already on the committee, so we only need to choose 4 more people from the remaining 29.\n\nBut, among these 29, another specific person must not be included.\n\nSo, actually, out of the remaining 29, we need to exclude that one person, so we have 28 people to choose from.\n\nThus, it's C(28, 4).\n\nAlternatively, think of it as total ways to choose 5 people including the specific person and excluding another specific person.\n\nFirst, fix the specific person to be included, so we choose them, and then choose the remaining 4 from the remaining 28 (excluding the one who must not be included).\n\nSo, again, C(28, 4).\n\nAlternatively, think in terms of total combinations without constraints and then apply the constraints.\n\nTotal ways to choose 5 from 30 is C(30, 5).\n\nNow, we want to include one specific person and exclude another specific person.\n\nSo, fix the one to be included, and exclude the one not to be included.\n\nSo, the committee must include person A and must not include person B.\n\nSo, person A is included, person B is excluded.\n\nSo, total people to choose from are 30 - 2 = 28, and we need to choose 4 more members.\n\nHence, C(28, 4).\n\nAlternatively, think of it as choosing 5 people including person A and excluding person B.\n\nSo, total ways are C(28, 4).\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to choose the committee without any restrictions, then subtract the committees that include person B and/or do not include person A.\n\nBut, in this case, since person A must be included and person B must not be included, we can directly choose the committee as person A plus 4 others from the remaining 28.\n\nSo, it's C(28, 4).\n\nTherefore, the number of ways is C(28, 4) = 20,475.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this calculation.\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!).\n\nSo, C(28, 4) = 28! / (4! * 24!) = (28 * 27 * 26 * 25) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = (28 * 27 * 26 * 25) / 24.\n\nCalculate numerator: 28 * 27 = 756.\n\n756 * 26 = 19,656.\n\n19,656 * 25 = 491,400.\n\nDenominator is 24.\n\nSo, 491,400 / 24 = 20,475.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the combination formula in terms of multiplication:\n\nC(28, 4) = (28 * 27 * 26 * 25) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = (28/4) * (27/3) * (26/2) * (25/1) = 7 * 9 * 13 * 25.\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n7 * 9 = 63.\n\n63 * 13 = 819.\n\n819 * 25 = 20,475.\n\nYes, same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the property of combinations: C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k).\n\nBut, in this case, it's simpler to calculate directly.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to form the committee is 20,475.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other constraints or if I've missed something.\n\nWe have 30 people.\n\nOne specific person must be included, so they are already on the committee.\n\nAnother specific person must not be included, so they are excluded.\n\nTherefore, the remaining people are 30 - 2 = 28.\n\nWe need to choose 4 more members from these 28.\n\nSo, C(28, 4) = 20,475.\n\nAlternatively, think about the total number of committees that include person A and exclude person B.\n\nWhich is indeed C(28, 4).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 20,475.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should confirm this with a smaller example to ensure the logic is sound.\n\nSuppose there are 5 people: A, B, C, D, E.\n\nWe need to form a committee of 3, including A and excluding B.\n\nSo, total people: 5.\n\nMust include A, exclude B.\n\nSo, remaining people: C, D, E.\n\nWe need to choose 2 more members from C, D, E.\n\nSo, C(3, 2) = 3.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1. A, C, D\n\n2. A, C, E\n\n3. A, D, E\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, total committees including A and excluding B.\n\nWhich matches C(3, 2) = 3.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, C(28, 4) = 20,475.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 20,475.\n\nBut, to be absolutely sure, perhaps I can think about it in terms of permutations and combinations.\n\nAnother way is to consider that the specific person who must be included is already chosen, so we have 4 spots left.\n\nWe cannot choose the specific person who must not be included, so we have 30 - 1 (for the one included) - 1 (for the one excluded) = 28 people to choose from.\n\nHence, C(28, 4).\n\nAlternatively, think about the total number of committees that include A and do not include B.\n\nWhich is C(28, 4).\n\nTherefore, the answer is 20,475.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more complex and there are other constraints.\n\nBut based on the information given, this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to form the committee is 20,475.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20475} \\]"
