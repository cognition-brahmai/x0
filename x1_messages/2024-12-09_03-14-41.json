The disease primarily affects the skin, nerves, and mucous membranes, leading to disfigurement and disability if left untreated. It is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae and is transmitted through prolonged close contact with an infected person. It is important to seek medical attention if you suspect you have been exposed to leprosy."
