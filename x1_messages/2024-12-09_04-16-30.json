        "content": "Let's see. There are originally 20 houses, each with 4 people. So, the total number of people initially is 20 houses * 4 people/house = 80 people.\n\nNow, the village is building 5 new houses, and each of these new houses will have 3 people living in them. So, the number of people moving into the new houses is 5 houses * 3 people/house = 15 people.\n\nAfter the new houses are built, the total number of people in the village will be the initial 80 people plus the new 15 people, which is 80 + 15 = 95 people.\n\nThe total number of houses after the new ones are built will be the original 20 houses plus 5 new houses, which is 20 + 5 = 25 houses.\n\nTo find the average number of people per house, we divide the total number of people by the total number of houses. So, average = total people / total houses = 95 people / 25 houses.\n\nLet me calculate that: 95 divided by 25 is 3.8.\n\nSo, the average number of people per house after the new houses are built is 3.8 people per house.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3.8} \\]"
