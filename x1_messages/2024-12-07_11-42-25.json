        "content": "So I have this problem here about students playing soccer and basketball. There are 25 students in total. 12 play soccer, 8 play basketball, and 3 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nOkay, first, I should probably figure out how many students play at least one of the sports. Since some students play both, I can't just add 12 and 8 together because that would count the students who play both sports twice.\n\nSo, I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That means I add the number of students who play soccer and the number who play basketball, and then subtract the number who play both, to avoid double-counting.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- S = number of students who play soccer = 12\n\n- B = number of students who play basketball = 8\n\n- Both = number of students who play both sports = 3\n\nThen, the number of students who play at least one sport is S + B - Both = 12 + 8 - 3 = 17.\n\nNow, since there are 25 students in total, the number of students who don't play either sport would be the total number minus those who play at least one sport.\n\nSo, students who don't play either sport = total students - students who play at least one sport = 25 - 17 = 8.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that this makes sense. Let me draw a Venn diagram to visualize this.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents soccer players, and the other represents basketball players.\n\n- The soccer circle has 12 students.\n\n- The basketball circle has 8 students.\n\n- The overlapping area, where students play both sports, has 3 students.\n\nSo, the part of the soccer circle that doesn't overlap with basketball is 12 - 3 = 9 students who play only soccer.\n\nThe part of the basketball circle that doesn't overlap with soccer is 8 - 3 = 5 students who play only basketball.\n\nThen, the overlapping area has 3 students who play both.\n\nSo, the total number of students who play at least one sport is 9 (only soccer) + 5 (only basketball) + 3 (both) = 17.\n\nAgain, subtracting this from the total number of students: 25 - 17 = 8 students who don't play either sport.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the union of two sets:\n\nn(S \u222a B) = n(S) + n(B) - n(S \u2229 B)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n(S \u222a B) is the number of students who play soccer or basketball or both.\n\n- n(S) is the number of soccer players.\n\n- n(B) is the number of basketball players.\n\n- n(S \u2229 B) is the number of students who play both sports.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nn(S \u222a B) = 12 + 8 - 3 = 17\n\nThen, the number of students who don't play either sport is the total number of students minus those who play at least one sport:\n\n25 - 17 = 8\n\nThis matches what I got earlier.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can check if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using sets or some other method.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the number of students who play only soccer, only basketball, and both, and then see how they add up.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Only soccer: 12 - 3 = 9\n\n- Only basketball: 8 - 3 = 5\n\n- Both sports: 3\n\nSo, total students who play at least one sport: 9 + 5 + 3 = 17\n\nAgain, 25 - 17 = 8 students don't play either sport.\n\nI think this is consistent across different methods, so I'm confident that the answer is 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
