What am I?\"\n\nOkay, so first part: \"Feed me and I live.\" That suggests that providing something to this thing sustains it or keeps it alive. So, it needs whatever \"feeding\" it to survive.\n\nNext part: \"Give me drink and I die.\" Hmm, this is interesting. So, if you give it a drink, it dies. That means water or any liquid is harmful to it.\n\nSo, something that needs to be fed to live but dies when given water. Let me think about what that could be.\n\nWell, fire is something that needs fuel to burn and stay alive. If you feed it with more fuel, it continues to burn. But if you give it water, it will extinguish and die.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Fire needs fuel to continue burning, and water will put it out.\n\nIs there anything else that fits this description? Maybe something more abstract?\n\nWell, perhaps it could be a question or a mystery. Feeding it means providing more information, which keeps it alive, but giving it a \"drink\" could mean providing an answer, which solves it and therefore \"kills\" the mystery. But that seems a bit of a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's sugar. Feeding sugar makes some things, like bacteria, thrive, but giving them water dilutes the sugar or changes their environment in a way that harms them. But that doesn't seem quite right.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a suppository. You feed it by inserting it into the body, but if it gets wet, it melts or dissolves and becomes ineffective. Hmm, that might fit, but it's a bit obscure.\n\nOr maybe it's a paper match. If you feed it by lighting it, it burns and lives as a flame, but if you give it drink, meaning water, it will extinguish.\n\nBut fire seems like the most straightforward and classic answer. It's a common riddle, and fire is the typical response.\n\nLet me see if there are any other possibilities.\n\nCould it be a wick or something similar? No, because a wick needs both fuel and often is exposed to air.\n\nWait, what about abookmark? Feeding it means reading more of the book, so the bookmark progresses, but giving it a drink might smudge the pages and damage the book, effectively \"killing\" the reading experience. That's creative, but again, not the standard answer.\n\nI think fire is the best and most logical answer here.\n\nSo, the answer to the riddle \"Feed me and I live, give me drink and I die. What am I?\" is fire.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{fire}} \\]"
