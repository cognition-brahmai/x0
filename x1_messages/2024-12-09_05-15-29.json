        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a film studio planning to make a bunch of blockbuster movies over the next five years. Each movie has an average production budget of $200 million and is expected to bring in $500 million at the box office. I need to calculate the total investment required for this project and the potential return on investment (ROI), taking into account things like marketing costs, distribution fees, and merchandise sales.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many movies they're planning to make over these five years. The problem doesn't specify the number of movies per year, so I'll assume they're making one movie per year. That seems reasonable for a major studio focusing on blockbusters. So, over five years, that would be five movies.\n\nNow, each movie has a production budget of $200 million. So, for five movies, the total production budget would be:\n\n5 movies * $200 million/movie = $1,000 million\n\nBut, of course, production budget isn't the only cost involved in making and releasing a movie. There are marketing costs, distribution fees, and other expenses. The problem mentions these factors, so I need to estimate those costs.\n\nMarketing costs can vary, but for big blockbuster movies, they can range from $50 million to $150 million per movie. Let's assume an average marketing cost of $100 million per movie.\n\nDistribution fees typically range from 15% to 30% of the box office revenue. Since these are big movies, perhaps the higher end of that range. Let's assume 30% for distribution fees.\n\nAlso, there are other expenses like publicity, contingency funds, and so on. It's hard to quantify these without more specific information, so for now, I'll stick with production and marketing costs for my initial calculation.\n\nSo, total investment per movie would be:\n\nProduction budget: $200 million\n\nMarketing costs: $100 million\n\nTotal per movie: $300 million\n\nFor five movies:\n\n5 * $300 million = $1,500 million\n\nNow, on the revenue side, each movie is expected to generate $500 million in box office revenue. But, we have to consider the distribution fees, which are 30% of the box office revenue.\n\nDistribution fees per movie: 30% of $500 million = $150 million\n\nSo, net box office revenue per movie would be:\n\n$500 million - $150 million = $350 million\n\nFor five movies:\n\n5 * $350 million = $1,750 million\n\nAdditionally, there are merchandise sales to consider. The problem mentions merchandise sales as a factor, but doesn't provide specific numbers. Merchandise can include toys, clothing, digital content, and more. For big blockbuster movies, merchandise can be a significant source of revenue.\n\nIt's difficult to estimate exactly how much merchandise sales would bring in, but for the sake of this calculation, let's assume that merchandise sales amount to 20% of the box office revenue per movie.\n\nMerchandise sales per movie: 20% of $500 million = $100 million\n\nFor five movies:\n\n5 * $100 million = $500 million\n\nNow, let's sum up the total revenue from net box office and merchandise sales:\n\n$1,750 million (net box office) + $500 million (merchandise) = $2,250 million\n\nTotal investment was $1,500 million, and total revenue is $2,250 million.\n\nTo calculate the ROI, we use the formula:\n\nROI = (Total Revenue - Total Investment) / Total Investment * 100%\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nROI = ($2,250 million - $1,500 million) / $1,500 million * 100% = ($750 million / $1,500 million) * 100% = 50%\n\nSo, the potential ROI is 50%.\n\nHowever, this calculation is somewhat simplified. There are other costs and revenues to consider. For example, there might be additional expenses like publicity, talent residuals, and overhead costs. On the revenue side, there are international box office sales, home video sales, and streaming revenues, which can be substantial for big movies.\n\nIf I were to make this calculation more accurate, I would need more detailed information about all these factors. But based on the information provided and the assumptions I've made, a 50% ROI seems plausible for this project.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50\\%} \\]"
