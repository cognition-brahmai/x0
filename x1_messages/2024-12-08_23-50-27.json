        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A player earns points in a game by solving puzzles and completing challenges. Each puzzle solved gives 5 points, and each challenge completed gives 3 points. The player has earned a total of 23 points, and I need to find out all the possible combinations of puzzles and challenges that could add up to 23 points.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to set this up with some variables. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( p \\) be the number of puzzles solved.\n\n- Let \\( c \\) be the number of challenges completed.\n\nGiven that each puzzle is worth 5 points and each challenge is worth 3 points, the total points can be represented by the equation:\n\n\\[ 5p + 3c = 23 \\]\n\nNow, I need to find all the non-negative integer solutions for \\( p \\) and \\( c \\) that satisfy this equation. Since puzzles and challenges can't be negative, both \\( p \\) and \\( c \\) have to be whole numbers.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to solve for one variable in terms of the other and then find the values that make sense.\n\nLet's solve for \\( c \\) in terms of \\( p \\):\n\n\\[ 3c = 23 - 5p \\]\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{23 - 5p}{3} \\]\n\nFor \\( c \\) to be an integer, \\( 23 - 5p \\) must be divisible by 3. That means \\( 23 - 5p \\) should be a multiple of 3.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about possible values for \\( p \\) and see which ones make \\( c \\) an integer.\n\nLet's consider possible values for \\( p \\). Since each puzzle is 5 points, and the total is 23, the maximum number of puzzles solved would be \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{23}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 4 \\) puzzles, because \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\), and \\( 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\), which is over 23.\n\nSo, possible values for \\( p \\) are 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nI'll plug each of these into the equation and see if \\( c \\) comes out to be an integer.\n\n1. If \\( p = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{23 - 0}{3} = \\frac{23}{3} \\approx 7.666... \\]\n\nThat's not an integer, so this isn't a valid solution.\n\n2. If \\( p = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{23 - 5}{3} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6 \\]\n\nThat's an integer, so one possible combination is 1 puzzle and 6 challenges.\n\n3. If \\( p = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{23 - 10}{3} = \\frac{13}{3} \\approx 4.333... \\]\n\nNot an integer, so invalid.\n\n4. If \\( p = 3 \\):\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{23 - 15}{3} = \\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.666... \\]\n\nAgain, not an integer.\n\n5. If \\( p = 4 \\):\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{23 - 20}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1 \\]\n\nThat's an integer, so another possible combination is 4 puzzles and 1 challenge.\n\nSo far, the valid combinations are:\n\n- 1 puzzle and 6 challenges\n\n- 4 puzzles and 1 challenge\n\nWait a minute, are there any other possible values for \\( p \\) beyond 4? Well, \\( p = 5 \\) would give \\( 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\), which is more than 23, so that's not possible. And \\( p = -1 \\) would give a negative number of points, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if there are any other possible values for \\( p \\) that I might have missed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can solve this using the general method for linear Diophantine equations. The equation is:\n\n\\[ 5p + 3c = 23 \\]\n\nI need to find non-negative integer solutions for \\( p \\) and \\( c \\).\n\nFirst, I can find one particular solution. Let's see, if \\( p = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ 5(2) + 3c = 23 \\]\n\n\\[ 10 + 3c = 23 \\]\n\n\\[ 3c = 13 \\]\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{13}{3} \\]\n\nNot an integer. How about \\( p = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ 5(1) + 3c = 23 \\]\n\n\\[ 5 + 3c = 23 \\]\n\n\\[ 3c = 18 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 6 \\]\n\nSo, one solution is \\( p = 1 \\), \\( c = 6 \\).\n\nAnother solution is \\( p = 4 \\), \\( c = 1 \\), as I found earlier.\n\nIs there a general way to find all solutions?\n\nYes, for the equation \\( 5p + 3c = 23 \\), since 5 and 3 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), all integer solutions can be found using the formula for linear Diophantine equations.\n\nThe general solution is:\n\n\\[ p = p_0 + 3k \\]\n\n\\[ c = c_0 - 5k \\]\n\nWhere \\( p_0 \\) and \\( c_0 \\) are particular solutions, and \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\nUsing the particular solution \\( p = 1 \\), \\( c = 6 \\):\n\n\\[ p = 1 + 3k \\]\n\n\\[ c = 6 - 5k \\]\n\nNow, I need \\( p \\) and \\( c \\) to be non-negative integers.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ 1 + 3k \\geq 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 6 - 5k \\geq 0 \\]\n\nFrom the first inequality:\n\n\\[ 3k \\geq -1 \\]\n\n\\[ k \\geq -\\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nSince \\( k \\) is an integer, \\( k \\geq 0 \\).\n\nFrom the second inequality:\n\n\\[ -5k \\geq -6 \\]\n\n\\[ 5k \\leq 6 \\]\n\n\\[ k \\leq \\frac{6}{5} \\]\n\n\\[ k \\leq 1.2 \\]\n\nSince \\( k \\) is an integer, \\( k \\leq 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, possible integer values for \\( k \\) are 0 and 1.\n\nFor \\( k = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ p = 1 + 3(0) = 1 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 6 - 5(0) = 6 \\]\n\nFor \\( k = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ p = 1 + 3(1) = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 6 - 5(1) = 1 \\]\n\nThese are the same solutions I found earlier.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using modular arithmetic.\n\nLet's see. Starting with:\n\n\\[ 5p + 3c = 23 \\]\n\nI can rearrange to:\n\n\\[ 5p = 23 - 3c \\]\n\nThis means that \\( 23 - 3c \\) must be divisible by 5.\n\nIn other words:\n\n\\[ 23 - 3c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\]\n\n\\[ -3c \\equiv -23 \\pmod{5} \\]\n\nSince \\( -23 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\) (because \\( -23 + 25 = 2 \\)), and \\( -3 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\), we have:\n\n\\[ 2c \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2 (which is valid since 2 and 5 are coprime):\n\n\\[ c \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\]\n\nThis means that \\( c = 5m + 1 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nSince \\( c \\) has to be non-negative, \\( m \\) can be 0, 1, 2, etc., but we also have to consider the constraints from \\( p \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( c = 5m + 1 \\) back into the equation:\n\n\\[ 5p + 3(5m + 1) = 23 \\]\n\n\\[ 5p + 15m + 3 = 23 \\]\n\n\\[ 5p + 15m = 20 \\]\n\n\\[ p + 3m = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ p = 4 - 3m \\]\n\nNow, since \\( p \\) must be non-negative, \\( 4 - 3m \\geq 0 \\), which implies \\( m \\leq \\frac{4}{3} \\). Since \\( m \\) is an integer, \\( m \\leq 1 \\).\n\nAlso, \\( m \\geq 0 \\) because \\( c = 5m + 1 \\geq 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, possible values for \\( m \\) are 0 and 1.\n\nFor \\( m = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ p = 4 - 0 = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 0 + 1 = 1 \\]\n\nFor \\( m = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ p = 4 - 3 = 1 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 5 + 1 = 6 \\]\n\nAgain, the same solutions as before.\n\nSo, it seems there are only two possible combinations:\n\n1. 1 puzzle and 6 challenges\n\n2. 4 puzzles and 1 challenge\n\nLet me double-check if there are any other possibilities.\n\nSuppose I consider \\( m = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ p = 4 - 6 = -2 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 10 + 1 = 11 \\]\n\nBut \\( p = -2 \\) is not acceptable, as you can't solve a negative number of puzzles.\n\nSimilarly, \\( m = -1 \\):\n\n\\[ p = 4 - (-3) = 7 \\]\n\n\\[ c = -5 + 1 = -4 \\]\n\nAgain, negative values are not acceptable.\n\nTherefore, only \\( m = 0 \\) and \\( m = 1 \\) give valid solutions.\n\nAlternatively, going back to the original equation:\n\n\\[ 5p + 3c = 23 \\]\n\nI can think about it in terms of finding lattice points (points with integer coordinates) on the line represented by this equation, within the first quadrant (since \\( p \\) and \\( c \\) are non-negative).\n\nThe intercepts are:\n\n- If \\( p = 0 \\), \\( c = \\frac{23}{3} \\), which is not an integer.\n\n- If \\( c = 0 \\), \\( p = \\frac{23}{5} \\), which is also not an integer.\n\nThe slope of the line is \\( -\\frac{5}{3} \\), indicating that for every increase of 3 in \\( c \\), \\( p \\) decreases by 5, or vice versa.\n\nGiven that, starting from one solution, I can find others by adding multiples of the coefficient vector \\( (3, -5) \\), which is consistent with the general solution I found earlier.\n\nBut in this case, since 5 and 3 are coprime, there are no other solutions beyond those already found.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there could be any other combinations where the total points add up to 23.\n\nSuppose the player solved 2 puzzles:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\] points from puzzles.\n\nThen, points from challenges would be:\n\n\\[ 23 - 10 = 13 \\]\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{13}{3} \\]\n\nWhich is not an integer, so invalid.\n\nIf the player solved 3 puzzles:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\]\n\n\\[ 23 - 15 = 8 \\]\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{8}{3} \\]\n\nAgain, not an integer.\n\nSo, indeed, only 1 puzzle and 6 challenges, or 4 puzzles and 1 challenge, are possible.\n\nAlternatively, if the player solved 0 puzzles:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 0 = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 23 - 0 = 23 \\]\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{23}{3} \\]\n\nNot an integer.\n\nAnd for negative puzzles, which don't make sense.\n\nSimilarly, for more than 4 puzzles, as previously discussed.\n\nTherefore, the only possible combinations are:\n\n- 1 puzzle and 6 challenges\n\n- 4 puzzles and 1 challenge\n\nI think that's all there is to it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{(p, c) = (1, 6) \\text{ or } (4, 1)} \\]"
