However, I can guide you through the steps and provide a general outline of how you can achieve this task in C++.\n\nHere's a high-level approach to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Reading the CSV file:**\n   - Open the input CSV file.\n   - Read the data line by line.\n   - Parse each line to extract names and ages.\n\n2. **Storing the data:**\n   - Store the names and ages in appropriate data structures, such as vectors of structures or pairs.\n\n3. **Sorting the data:**\n   - Sort the data based on age in ascending order.\n\n4. **Writing to a new CSV file:**\n   - Open a new CSV file for writing.\n   - Write the sorted data to this file.\n\nLet's break down each step:\n\n### Step 1: Reading the CSV file\n\nYou can use `std::ifstream` to read the file. Assume the CSV file has lines in the format \"Name,Age\", where Name is a string and Age is an integer.\n\n```cpp\n#include <fstream>\n#include <string>\n#include <vector>\n#include <sstream>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nstruct Person {\n    std::string name;\n    int age;\n};\n\nstd::vector<Person> readCSV(const std::string& filename) {\n    std::vector<Person> people;\n    std::ifstream file(filename);\n    std::string line;\n\n    while (std::getline(file, line)) {\n        std::stringstream ss(line);\n        std::string token;\n        Person person;\n\n        // Read name\n        std::getline(ss, token, ',');\n        person.name = token;\n\n        // Read age\n        std::getline(ss, token, ',');\n        person.age = std::stoi(token);\n\n        people.push_back(person);\n    }\n\n    return people;\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Storing the data\n\nIn the above code, we're storing the data in a vector of `Person` structures. This is a convenient way to handle the data.\n\n### Step 3: Sorting the data\n\nYou can use `std::sort` from the algorithm header to sort the vector based on the age.\n\n```cpp\n#include <algorithm>\n\nvoid sortByAge(std::vector<Person>& people) {\n    std::sort(people.begin(), people.end(), [](const Person& a, const Person& b) {\n        return a.age < b.age;\n    });\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Writing to a new CSV file\n\nUse `std::ofstream` to write the sorted data to a new CSV file.\n\n```cpp\nvoid writeCSV(const std::vector<Person>& people, const std::string& filename) {\n    std::ofstream file(filename);\n\n    for (const auto& person : people) {\n        file << person.name << \",\" << person.age << \"\\n\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Putting it all together\n\nCreate a main function to orchestrate these steps:\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    std::string inputFilename = \"input.csv\";\n    std::string outputFilename = \"output.csv\";\n\n    std::vector<Person> people = readCSV(inputFilename);\n    sortByAge(people);\n    writeCSV(people, outputFilename);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **Error handling:** Add checks to ensure the file opens successfully.\n- **CSV format:** Handle cases where names may contain commas or quotes.\n- **Performance:** For large files, consider more efficient reading and sorting methods.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point for your program.
