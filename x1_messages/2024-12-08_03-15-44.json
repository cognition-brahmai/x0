        "content": "So the theme park is adding a new roller coaster to bring in more folks, and they've got some specifics about how it works. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the roller coaster can hold 24 riders per run, and each cycle\u2014including loading and unloading\u2014takes 3 minutes. The park plans to keep it running continuously for 12 hours each day. We need to find out how many riders it can handle in a day and then estimate the extra money it would bring in if each ride costs $5.\n\nAlright, let's start with finding out how many cycles the roller coaster can complete in a day. Since it runs for 12 hours each day, and each cycle takes 3 minutes, we first need to figure out how many 3-minute intervals there are in 12 hours.\n\nFirst, convert 12 hours into minutes:\n\n12 hours \u00d7 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes\n\nNow, divide the total minutes by the cycle time:\n\n720 minutes \u00f7 3 minutes/cycle = 240 cycles per day\n\nSo, the roller coaster can complete 240 cycles in a day.\n\nNext, since each cycle can carry 24 riders, the total number of riders per day would be:\n\n240 cycles/day \u00d7 24 riders/cycle = 5,760 riders per day\n\nNow, if each rider pays $5 for the ride, the additional revenue per day would be:\n\n5,760 riders/day \u00d7 $5/rider = $28,800 per day\n\nWait a minute, that seems pretty straightforward, but let's double-check to make sure we didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, confirm the number of cycles per day. 12 hours times 60 minutes is indeed 720 minutes. Dividing that by 3 minutes per cycle gives us 240 cycles. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 240 cycles times 24 riders per cycle equals 5,760 riders. That also seems right.\n\nFinally, 5,760 riders times $5 per rider equals $28,800. That appears to be the correct revenue.\n\nHowever, maybe we should consider if there are any breaks or downtime for the roller coaster. The problem says it operates \"continuously\" for 12 hours each day, so I guess no breaks, which is why we didn't subtract any time for maintenance or anything like that.\n\nAlso, assuming that there's always a full load of 24 riders per cycle, which might not always be the case, but based on the information provided, that's the assumption we have to make.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the roller coaster can accommodate 5,760 riders per day, and the additional revenue generated would be $28,800 per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28800} \\]"
