        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that sells bags of candy normally for $12 each. During a sale, there's a discount of 25% off the regular price. A customer decides to buy 8 bags during this sale and we need to find out how much they save compared to buying them at the regular price.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 25% discount means. A 25% discount off the regular price means the customer pays 75% of the regular price, right? Because 100% - 25% = 75%.\n\nSo, the sale price per bag is 75% of $12.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n75% of $12 is (75/100) * 12 = 0.75 * 12 = $9.\n\nSo, during the sale, each bag costs $9.\n\nNow, if the customer buys 8 bags at the sale price, the total cost would be 8 * $9 = $72.\n\nNext, I need to find out what the total cost would have been without the discount.\n\nWithout the discount, each bag is $12, so for 8 bags, it would be 8 * $12 = $96.\n\nNow, to find out how much the customer saves by buying during the sale, I subtract the sale total from the regular total.\n\nSo, $96 - $72 = $24.\n\nTherefore, the customer saves $24 by buying the 8 bags during the sale.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the discount per bag and then multiply by the number of bags.\n\nThe discount per bag is 25% of $12, which is (25/100) * 12 = 0.25 * 12 = $3.\n\nSo, each bag has a $3 discount.\n\nFor 8 bags, the total discount would be 8 * $3 = $24.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the customer saves $24 in total.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
