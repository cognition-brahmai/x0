        "content": "The primary purpose of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is to simulate and analyze fluid flow. Therefore, the correct answer is B. To simulate and analyze fluid flow.\n\nCFD is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical analysis and algorithms to solve and analyze problems involving fluid flows. It allows engineers and scientists to model and study the behavior of fluids (liquids, gases, and plasmas) and their interactions with surfaces and other fluids. CFD is widely used in various industries, including aerospace, automotive, chemical processing, and environmental engineering, to design and optimize new equipment and systems, as well as to troubleshoot and improve existing ones.\n\nOption A, \"To study the behavior of solid objects,\" is incorrect because CFD primarily focuses on fluids, although it can also consider the interaction between fluids and solids, such as in the case of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations.\n\nOption C, \"To predict weather patterns,\" is partially correct in that CFD is used in meteorology to model atmospheric flows and predict weather patterns. However, this is a specific application of CFD, and the primary purpose of CFD is more broadly to simulate and analyze fluid flow in various contexts, not just weather prediction.\n\nOption D, \"To design electrical circuits,\" is incorrect because CFD is not related to electrical engineering or circuit design. Electrical circuits are typically designed using tools and principles from electrical engineering, such as circuit simulation software like SPICE, which is entirely different from CFD.\n\nIn summary, while CFD has applications in various fields, its primary purpose is to simulate and analyze fluid flow, making option B the correct answer.\n"
