        "content": "Alright, I've got this system of equations to solve: y = 2x - 3 and y = x + 1. I need to find the values of x and y that make both equations true at the same time. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nSince both equations are solved for y, it seems straightforward to set them equal to each other. That way, I can solve for x first. So, if y = 2x - 3 and y = x + 1, then setting them equal gives me:\n\n2x - 3 = x + 1\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. I'll start by getting all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. I can subtract x from both sides:\n\n2x - x - 3 = x - x + 1\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\nx - 3 = 1\n\nNext, I'll add 3 to both sides to isolate x:\n\nx - 3 + 3 = 1 + 3\n\nSo, x = 4\n\nNow that I have x, I can plug it back into one of the original equations to find y. Let's use the second equation, y = x + 1:\n\ny = 4 + 1\n\ny = 5\n\nSo, the solution should be x = 4 and y = 5. But I should check if these values satisfy both equations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, plug into y = 2x - 3:\n\n5 = 2(4) - 3\n\n5 = 8 - 3\n\n5 = 5 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nNow, plug into y = x + 1:\n\n5 = 4 + 1\n\n5 = 5 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, both equations are satisfied. So, the solution is x = 4, y = 5.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to solve this system? Maybe using substitution or elimination methods? I already used substitution since both equations were solved for y, but let's see about elimination.\n\nFor elimination, I need to arrange the equations so that one variable cancels out when I add or subtract them. Let's write both equations again:\n\ny = 2x - 3\n\ny = x + 1\n\nI can subtract the second equation from the first:\n\n( y ) - ( y ) = (2x - 3) - (x + 1)\n\n0 = 2x - 3 - x - 1\n\nSimplify:\n\n0 = x - 4\n\nSo, x = 4\n\nThen, plug back into one of the equations to find y, which I already did, and got y = 5.\n\nLooks like I get the same answer using both methods. That gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nIs there a graphical way to understand this? Sure, since these are linear equations, their graphs are straight lines. The solution to the system is the point where these two lines intersect.\n\nSo, plotting y = 2x - 3 and y = x + 1 on a graph, the point where they cross should be (4, 5). I can visualize that, but since I don't have a graphing tool right now, I'll trust the algebraic solution.\n\nLet me consider if there are any special cases or if the system could have no solution or infinitely many solutions. In this case, since the slopes of the two lines are different (2 and 1), they must intersect at exactly one point, which is what I found.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if the equations were parallel or the same line. If the slopes were equal, the lines would be parallel and have no solution unless they were the same line, in which case there would be infinitely many solutions. But here, the slopes are different, so there's exactly one solution.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The solution is x = 4, y = 5, and I've verified it using substitution and elimination methods. There's no need for matrix methods or other techniques since this is a simple system of two equations with two variables.\n\nOne more thing: could I have solved for y first instead of x? Well, in this case, since both equations are already solved for y, it was easier to solve for x first. But if they weren't, I could have rearranged them accordingly.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this solution. Let's move on to the next problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{x = 4, \\ y = 5} \\]"
