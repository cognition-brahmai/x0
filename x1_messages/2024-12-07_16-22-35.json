A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). For example, \"madam\" and \"nurses run\" are palindromes.\n\nTo write a Python script that checks if a given word is a palindrome, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Normalize the Input:** Remove any spaces and punctuation, and convert all characters to lowercase to ensure the check is case-insensitive and not affected by non-alphabetic characters.\n\n2. **Check if the Word Reads the Same Forwards and Backwards:** Compare the normalized string with its reverse.\n\nHere's a simple Python function to accomplish this:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(word):\n    # Normalize the input: remove spaces, punctuation, and convert to lowercase\n    normalized = ''.join(char.lower() for char in word if char.isalnum())\n    \n    # Check if the normalized string is equal to its reverse\n    return normalized == normalized[::-1]\n\n# Example usage:\nword = input(\"Enter a word to check if it's a palindrome: \")\nif is_palindrome(word):\n    print(\"It's a palindrome!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"It's not a palindrome.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Normalization:**\n   - `char.lower() for char in word if char.isalnum()` creates a generator that iterates through each character in the input word, converts it to lowercase, and includes it only if it's alphanumeric (letters and numbers). This removes spaces and punctuation.\n   - `''.join(...)` concatenates these characters into a single string.\n\n2. **Palindrome Check:**\n   - `normalized[::-1]` creates a reversed copy of the normalized string.\n   - The function returns `True` if the normalized string is equal to its reversed version, otherwise `False`.\n\nThis script is straightforward and efficient for checking palindromes in Python.
