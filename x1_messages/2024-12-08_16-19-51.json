        "content": "So the original garden is 25 feet long and 10 feet wide. That means its area is length times width, so 25 times 10, which is 250 square feet. Now, the owner wants to expand the garden by increasing both the length and the width by 2 feet each. So, the new length will be 25 plus 2, which is 27 feet, and the new width will be 10 plus 2, which is 12 feet. To find the new area, I need to multiply the new length by the new width, so that's 27 times 12. Let me calculate that. 27 times 10 is 270, and 27 times 2 is 54, so adding those together, 270 plus 54 equals 324 square feet. Therefore, the new area of the garden will be 324 square feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{324} \\]"
