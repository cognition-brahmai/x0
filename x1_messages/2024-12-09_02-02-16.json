        "content": "So I've got this bacteria population problem here. Let's see what it's asking. It says that a bacteria population doubles every 20 minutes, and there are initially 500 bacteria. I need to find out how many there will be after 2 hours.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the time frames involved. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 120 minutes. The population doubles every 20 minutes, so I should figure out how many 20-minute intervals there are in 120 minutes.\n\nLet me calculate that: 120 minutes divided by 20 minutes per doubling. That's 120 / 20 = 6. So, there are 6 doubling periods in 2 hours.\n\nNow, starting with 500 bacteria, the population doubles each time period. So, after each 20 minutes, the number of bacteria is multiplied by 2.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nStarting amount: 500\n\nAfter 20 minutes: 500 * 2 = 1000\n\nAfter 40 minutes: 1000 * 2 = 2000\n\nAfter 60 minutes: 2000 * 2 = 4000\n\nAfter 80 minutes: 4000 * 2 = 8000\n\nAfter 100 minutes: 8000 * 2 = 16,000\n\nAfter 120 minutes: 16,000 * 2 = 32,000\n\nSo, after 2 hours, there would be 32,000 bacteria.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a formula I can use instead of multiplying repeatedly. I recall that exponential growth can be modeled by the formula:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (growth rate)^(time / period)\n\nIn this case, the growth rate is 2 (since it doubles), the initial amount is 500, the time is 120 minutes, and the period is 20 minutes.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nFinal amount = 500 * 2^(120 / 20) = 500 * 2^6 = 500 * 64 = 32,000\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. So, 32,000 bacteria after 2 hours.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if the doubling time is correctly applied. Every 20 minutes the population doubles.\n\nSo, initial time (t=0): 500\n\nt=20 min: 500 * 2 = 1000\n\nt=40 min: 1000 * 2 = 2000\n\nt=60 min: 2000 * 2 = 4000\n\nt=80 min: 4000 * 2 = 8000\n\nt=100 min: 8000 * 2 = 16,000\n\nt=120 min: 16,000 * 2 = 32,000\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the exponential growth formula:\n\nAmount = initial amount * e^(kt)\n\nBut in this case, since it's doubling every 20 minutes, the first method is simpler.\n\nWait, maybe I should verify using the continuous growth formula to see if I get the same answer.\n\nThe general formula for exponential growth is:\n\nA = A0 * e^(kt)\n\nWhere A is the final amount, A0 is the initial amount, k is the growth rate, and t is time.\n\nFirst, I need to find k. I know that after 20 minutes, the amount doubles, so:\n\n2A0 = A0 * e^(k*20)\n\nDivide both sides by A0:\n\n2 = e^(20k)\n\nTake natural log of both sides:\n\nln(2) = 20k\n\nSo, k = ln(2)/20\n\nNow, plug k back into the formula to find A at t=120 minutes:\n\nA = 500 * e^((ln(2)/20)*120)\n\nSimplify the exponent:\n\n(ln(2)/20)*120 = ln(2)*6 = 6ln(2) = ln(2^6) = ln(64)\n\nSo, A = 500 * e^(ln(64)) = 500 * 64 = 32,000\n\nAgain, the same answer. So, it seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the rule of doubling time. The population doubles every 20 minutes, so in 120 minutes, it doubles 6 times, which is 2^6 = 64 times the initial amount.\n\n500 * 64 = 32,000\n\nConsistent again.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider if the doubling time was different or if the time wasn't a whole number multiple of the doubling period.\n\nBut in this case, since 120 minutes is exactly 6 times 20 minutes, it's straightforward.\n\nIf the time was, say, 125 minutes, then I'd have to account for partial doubling periods, but here it's straightforward.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 32,000 bacteria after 2 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32000} \\]"
