        "content": "During the Renaissance period, which spanned roughly from the 14th to the 17th century, people's beliefs about the solar system were primarily influenced by the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle and the Roman astronomer Ptolemy. This model, known as the geocentric model, placed Earth at the center of the universe, with the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars orbiting around it in perfect circles.\n\nHowever, towards the end of the Renaissance, a few groundbreaking thinkers began to challenge this long-held belief. Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer, proposed a heliocentric model in the 16th century, suggesting that the Sun was at the center of the universe, with the planets, including Earth, orbiting around it. This idea was further developed by Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei in the 17th century, leading to the eventual acceptance of the heliocentric model and marking the beginning of modern astronomy.\n\nIt's important to note that the transition from the geocentric to the heliocentric model was not immediate or universally accepted. Many scientists, philosophers, and religious authorities resisted the new ideas, often due to a combination of scientific, philosophical, and religious reasons. The shift in understanding the solar system was part of a broader intellectual movement during the Renaissance that emphasized observation, experimentation, and critical thinking, paving the way for the Scientific Revolution."
