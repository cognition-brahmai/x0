        "content": "Albert Einstein's famous equation is E=mc^2. This equation represents the relationship between energy (E) and mass (m), with c being the speed of light in a vacuum. It signifies that energy and mass are interchangeable; they are different forms of the same thing. This equation is fundamental to our understanding of physics and has numerous applications in fields such as nuclear energy and particle physics.\n\nENDOUTPUT\n"
