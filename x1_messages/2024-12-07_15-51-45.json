To create a Go program that interacts with Redis to store and retrieve key-value pairs with expiration times, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up your Go environment:** Make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).\n\n2. **Install Redis:** Ensure that Redis is installed and running on your local machine or a server accessible to your Go application. You can download Redis from [https://redis.io/download](https://redis.io/download).\n\n3. **Install Go Redis client library:** You'll need a library to connect to Redis from Go. One of the most popular libraries is `go-redis`. You can install it using Go's package manager:\n\n   ```sh\n   go get github.com/go-redis/redis/v8\n   ```\n\n4. **Write the Go code:** Create a new Go file, for example, `main.go`, and write the code to connect to Redis, set key-value pairs with expiration times, and retrieve them.\n\nHere's a simple example to get you started:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"context\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"time\"\n\n\t\"github.com/go-redis/redis/v8\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Create a new Redis client\n\tclient := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{\n\t\tAddr:     \"localhost:6379\", // Redis server address\n\t\tPassword: \"\",               // no password set\n\t\tDB:       0,                // use default DB\n\t})\n\n\t// Set up context\n\tctx := context.Background()\n\n\t// Set a key with a value and expiration time\n\tkey := \"mykey\"\n\tvalue := \"myvalue\"\n\texpiration := 10 * time.Second // expiration time\n\n\terr := client.SetEX(ctx, key, value, expiration).Err()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err)\n\t}\n\n\t// Get the value of the key\n\tval, err := client.Get(ctx, key).Result()\n\tif err == redis.Nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Key does not exist\")\n\t} else if err != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err)\n\t} else {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Value:\", val)\n\t}\n\n\t// Wait for the key to expire\n\ttime.Sleep(11 * time.Second)\n\n\t// Try to get the value again after expiration\n\tval, err = client.Get(ctx, key).Result()\n\tif err == redis.Nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Key has expired\")\n\t} else if err != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err)\n\t} else {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Value after expiration:\", val)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Connecting to Redis:** We create a new Redis client using `redis.NewClient` and specify the Redis server address, password (if any), and the database number.\n\n2. **Setting a key with expiration:** We use the `SetEX` method to set a key with a value and an expiration time. The `SetEX` method takes the context, key, value, and expiration duration as parameters.\n\n3. **Getting the value:** We use the `Get` method to retrieve the value associated with a key. If the key does not exist (`redis.Nil`), we handle it appropriately.\n\n4. **Waiting for expiration:** We use `time.Sleep` to wait for the key to expire and then attempt to retrieve the value again to see that it no longer exists.\n\nThis should give you a basic understanding of how to interact with Redis from Go to store and retrieve key-value pairs with expiration times. You can expand upon this by adding more functionalities as needed."
