        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to figure out how many Type A and Type B pens were bought, given that there are 12 pens in total and the total cost is $10. The cost of each Type A pen is $0.75, and each Type B pen is $1.25.\n\nFirst, I should define variables for the number of each type of pen. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( a \\) be the number of Type A pens.\n\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of Type B pens.\n\nNow, I know that the total number of pens is 12, so I can write the equation:\n\n\\[ a + b = 12 \\]\n\nNext, the total cost of the pens is $10. Since each Type A pen costs $0.75 and each Type B pen costs $1.25, I can write the cost equation as:\n\n\\[ 0.75a + 1.25b = 10 \\]\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( a + b = 12 \\)\n\n2. \\( 0.75a + 1.25b = 10 \\)\n\nI need to solve this system to find the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nOne way to solve this is by the substitution method. I can solve the first equation for one variable and substitute it into the second equation.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ a = 12 - b \\]\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( a \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 0.75(12 - b) + 1.25b = 10 \\]\n\nNow, I'll distribute the 0.75:\n\n\\[ 0.75 \\times 12 - 0.75b + 1.25b = 10 \\]\n\n\\[ 9 - 0.75b + 1.25b = 10 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 9 + (1.25b - 0.75b) = 10 \\]\n\n\\[ 9 + 0.5b = 10 \\]\n\nNow, subtract 9 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.5b = 1 \\]\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 0.5:\n\n\\[ b = 2 \\]\n\nSo, there are 2 Type B pens.\n\nNow, substitute \\( b = 2 \\) back into the equation \\( a = 12 - b \\):\n\n\\[ a = 12 - 2 = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 10 Type A pens and 2 Type B pens.\n\nTo check if this is correct, I can plug these values back into the original equations.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n\\[ a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \\] \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSecond equation:\n\n\\[ 0.75 \\times 10 + 1.25 \\times 2 = 7.5 + 2.5 = 10 \\] \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out, so the solution is 10 Type A pens and 2 Type B pens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ Type A pens and } 2 \\text{ Type B pens}} \\]"
