You can store the gathered evidence into a variable #E[index] that can be referenced later.\n\nAvailable tools:\nGoogleScholar[input]: Tool that enables searching for academic articles, papers, and publications. The input should be a research-related query.\nPDFParser[input]: Load PDF files from the input URL(s) and produce plain text output containing the content of the file(s).\nCitationTracker[input]: Track citations made in academic papers. Input is a link to an academic paper.\nQAExpert[input]: Answer questions based on common sense, world knowledge, or given input context that may contain the answer.\n\nEach plan should be followed by exactly one evidence (#E[index]) value.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [First action based on input question]\n#E1 = [Function call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action based on #E1]\n#E2 = [Next function call and input parameter, potentially referring to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context #E1\"]\n...\nFinal answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: How has the theory of relativity been used in recent astrophysics research?"
