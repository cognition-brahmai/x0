        "content": "So I've got this recipe that says I need 8 cups of flour to make 24 cookies. But I want to make 36 cookies instead. I need to figure out how many cups of flour that would require. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how much flour is needed for one cookie, and then multiply that by 36 to get the total amount needed for 36 cookies. That makes sense.\n\nSo, if 8 cups of flour make 24 cookies, then the amount of flour per cookie would be 8 cups divided by 24 cookies. Let me do that calculation:\n\n8 cups \u00f7 24 cookies = 0.333... cups per cookie.\n\nHmm, that's a repeating decimal. Maybe I can work with fractions instead to make it easier. Let's try that.\n\n8 cups divided by 24 cookies is the same as 8/24, which simplifies to 1/3 cup per cookie.\n\nOkay, so each cookie requires 1/3 cup of flour.\n\nNow, to find out how much flour is needed for 36 cookies, I can multiply the amount per cookie by 36.\n\nSo, 1/3 cup per cookie \u00d7 36 cookies = ?\n\nWell, 1/3 of 36 is 12. So, it should be 12 cups of flour.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to set up a proportion.\n\nIf 24 cookies require 8 cups, then 36 cookies require x cups.\n\nSo, 24 cookies : 8 cups = 36 cookies : x cups.\n\nThis can be written as a ratio: 24/8 = 36/x.\n\nWait, actually, that's not correct. Ratios should be consistent, so it should be cookies to cups.\n\nSo, it's 24 cookies to 8 cups, which is 24:8, simplifying to 3:1.\n\nSo, for every 3 cookies, you need 1 cup of flour.\n\nTherefore, for 36 cookies, you would need 36 divided by 3 equals 12 cups of flour.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of scaling.\n\nIf 24 cookies require 8 cups, then to find out how many times 24 goes into 36, I can divide 36 by 24, which is 1.5.\n\nSo, 36 cookies is 1.5 times 24 cookies.\n\nTherefore, I need 1.5 times the amount of flour.\n\nSo, 1.5 \u00d7 8 cups = 12 cups.\n\nAgain, that gives me the same answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the amount of flour per dozen cookies.\n\n24 cookies are 2 dozen, and they require 8 cups.\n\nSo, per dozen cookies, it\u2019s 8 cups divided by 2, which is 4 cups per dozen.\n\nTherefore, for 36 cookies, which is 3 dozen, I would need 3 times 4 cups, which is 12 cups.\n\nOnce more, the same result.\n\nAlright, it seems consistent across multiple methods that I need 12 cups of flour for 36 cookies.\n\nI think that\u2019s pretty confident.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
