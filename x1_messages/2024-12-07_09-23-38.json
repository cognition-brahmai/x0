        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. So, a palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). For example, \"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama\" is a palindrome.\n\nTo create a Python function that checks if a given string is a palindrome, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Normalize the string**: Convert the string to lowercase to make it case-insensitive.\n2. **Remove non-alphanumeric characters**: Remove any characters that are not letters or numbers.\n3. **Check if the cleaned string is equal to its reverse**.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n### Step 1: Normalize the string\n\nWe can use the `lower()` method to convert the string to lowercase. This ensures that the function is case-insensitive.\n\n### Step 2: Remove non-alphanumeric characters\n\nWe can use the `isalnum()` method in a list comprehension to filter out any characters that are not letters or numbers.\n\n### Step 3: Check if the cleaned string is equal to its reverse\n\nWe can reverse the cleaned string and check if it is equal to the original cleaned string.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n    # Step 1: Normalize the string\n    s = s.lower()\n    \n    # Step 2: Remove non-alphanumeric characters\n    cleaned = ''.join(char for char in s if char.isalnum())\n    \n    # Step 3: Check if the cleaned string is equal to its reverse\n    return cleaned == cleaned[::-1]\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_string = \"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama\"\nprint(is_palindrome(input_string))  # Output: True\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Normalization**: Converts \"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama\" to \"a man, a plan, a canal, panama\".\n2. **Cleaning**: Removes commas and spaces to get \"amanaplanacanalpanama\".\n3. **Checking palindrome**: Checks if \"amanaplanacanalpanama\" is equal to its reverse, which it is.\n\nThis function should work for most cases. However, if you need to handle more complex scenarios, such as ignoring certain special characters or considering localized characters, you might need to adjust the cleaning step accordingly.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!"
