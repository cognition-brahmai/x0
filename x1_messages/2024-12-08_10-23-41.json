        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces 10,000 units of a product per month. Because demand is going up, they decide to bump up production by 5% each month. We need to find out how many units they'll produce in the third month.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to increase production by 5% each month. Percentage increases can be a bit tricky, but I think I've got it. A 5% increase means that each month, the factory is producing 5% more units than it did the previous month.\n\nSo, starting with the first month, they produce 10,000 units. In the second month, they increase that by 5%. To find out what 5% of 10,000 is, I can calculate 0.05 times 10,000, which is 500 units. So, the second month's production is 10,000 + 500 = 10,500 units.\n\nNow, for the third month, they're going to increase the second month's production by another 5%. So, I need to find 5% of 10,500. That would be 0.05 times 10,500, which is 525 units. Therefore, the third month's production is 10,500 + 525 = 11,025 units.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to calculate this without finding the increase each time separately? I remember that when you have consecutive percentage increases, you can use the formula for exponential growth.\n\nThe formula for the amount after a certain number of periods with a fixed percentage increase is:\n\n\\[ \\text{final amount} = \\text{initial amount} \\times (1 + \\text{growth rate})^{\\text{number of periods}} \\]\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 10,000 units, the growth rate is 5% or 0.05, and the number of periods is 2 (since we're going from month 1 to month 3, which is two increases).\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{final amount} = 10,000 \\times (1 + 0.05)^2 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate 1 + 0.05, which is 1.05.\n\nThen, raise 1.05 to the power of 2: \\(1.05^2 = 1.1025\\).\n\nFinally, multiply by the initial amount: \\(10,000 \\times 1.1025 = 11,025\\).\n\nSo, again, we get 11,025 units for the third month.\n\nJust to double-check, let's see if this matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nFirst month: 10,000 units.\n\nSecond month: 10,000 + (0.05 \u00d7 10,000) = 10,000 + 500 = 10,500 units.\n\nThird month: 10,500 + (0.05 \u00d7 10,500) = 10,500 + 525 = 11,025 units.\n\nYes, it matches. So, the factory will produce 11,025 units in the third month.\n\nI think that's the answer, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The problem says the factory increases production by 5% each month, and we're to find the production in the third month.\n\nI started with 10,000 units in the first month, increased it by 5% to get the second month's production, and then increased that amount by another 5% to get the third month's production. Alternatively, using the exponential growth formula, I got the same result.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to think of it as compound interest, where the production increases by 5% each month. The formula is the same as the one I used.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 11,025 units is the correct answer for the third month's production.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11025} \\]"
