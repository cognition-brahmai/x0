        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a jar with 4 red marbles, 6 blue marbles, and 10 green marbles. That means in total, there are 4 + 6 + 10 = 20 marbles. I need to find the probability of drawing at least one red marble when I draw 3 marbles without replacement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"at least one red marble\" means. It means that in the three marbles I draw, I could have one red, two red, or all three red. That seems a bit complicated to calculate directly because there are different scenarios. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.\n\nI recall that \"at least one\" probabilities can often be found more easily by calculating the probability of the complementary event and subtracting it from 1. The complementary event of getting at least one red marble is getting no red marbles at all in the three draws. So, maybe I should calculate the probability of drawing zero red marbles and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of drawing at least one red marble.\n\nThat sounds like a plan. So, first, I'll calculate the probability of drawing zero red marbles in three draws without replacement.\n\nTo do that, I need to find the probability of drawing three marbles, all of which are not red. In other words, all three are either blue or green.\n\nThere are 6 blue and 10 green marbles, so together, there are 6 + 10 = 16 non-red marbles.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw 3 marbles out of 20 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 marbles out of 20 is C(20, 3).\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose 3 non-red marbles out of 16 is C(16, 3).\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing zero red marbles is C(16, 3) / C(20, 3).\n\nThen, the probability of drawing at least one red marble is 1 - (C(16, 3) / C(20, 3)).\n\nLet me calculate these combinations.\n\nFirst, C(16, 3) = 16! / (3!(16 - 3)!) = (16 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 14) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (16 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 14) / 6 = (3360) / 6 = 560.\n\nNext, C(20, 3) = 20! / (3!(20 - 3)!) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18) / 6 = (6840) / 6 = 1140.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing zero red marbles is 560 / 1140.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 20: 560 \u00f7 20 = 28, 1140 \u00f7 20 = 57. So, 28/57.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing at least one red marble is 1 - 28/57 = (57/57 - 28/57) = 29/57.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to approach this problem, maybe using permutations or another method?\n\nLet me think. Since the marbles are drawn without replacement, the draws are dependent events. That means the probability changes with each draw.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability of drawing at least one red marble by considering the different scenarios: exactly one red, exactly two red, or exactly three red marbles.\n\nSo, the probability of exactly one red marble would be C(4,1) * C(16,2) / C(20,3).\n\nSimilarly, exactly two red marbles would be C(4,2) * C(16,1) / C(20,3).\n\nAnd exactly three red marbles would be C(4,3) * C(16,0) / C(20,3).\n\nThen, the total probability of at least one red marble would be the sum of these three probabilities.\n\nLet me calculate each of these.\n\nFirst, C(4,1) = 4.\n\nC(16,2) = (16 \u00d7 15) / 2 = 120.\n\nSo, C(4,1) * C(16,2) = 4 \u00d7 120 = 480.\n\nThen, C(4,2) = (4 \u00d7 3) / 2 = 6.\n\nC(16,1) = 16.\n\nSo, C(4,2) * C(16,1) = 6 \u00d7 16 = 96.\n\nNext, C(4,3) = 4.\n\nC(16,0) = 1.\n\nSo, C(4,3) * C(16,0) = 4 \u00d7 1 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 480 + 96 + 4 = 580.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is C(20,3) = 1140, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the probability is 580 / 1140.\n\nSimplifying that fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 20, 580 \u00f7 20 = 29, 1140 \u00f7 20 = 57. So, 29/57.\n\nInteresting, I get the same answer as before. That's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this problem step by step, considering the probability at each draw.\n\nFor example, the probability of drawing a red marble on the first draw is 4/20 = 1/5.\n\nIf the first marble is red, then for the second draw, there are 3 red marbles left and 19 marbles in total.\n\nSimilarly, if the first marble is not red, then for the second draw, there are still 4 red marbles, but only 19 marbles in total.\n\nThis seems more complicated because it involves conditional probabilities.\n\nI think the combination method is more straightforward for this problem.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the probability of drawing at least one red marble by subtracting the probability of drawing no red marbles from 1, which is what I did initially.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same answer, which is 29/57.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to confirm this.\n\nSuppose I consider the total number of ways to draw at least one red marble.\n\nThat would be the total number of ways to draw three marbles minus the number of ways to draw zero red marbles.\n\nTotal number of ways to draw three marbles is C(20,3) = 1140.\n\nNumber of ways to draw zero red marbles is C(16,3) = 560.\n\nSo, number of ways to draw at least one red marble is 1140 - 560 = 580.\n\nTherefore, probability is 580 / 1140 = 29/57.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think this confirms that the probability is indeed 29/57.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider the step-by-step approach with conditional probabilities.\n\nThe probability of drawing at least one red marble is equal to 1 minus the probability of drawing no red marbles in all three draws.\n\nThe probability of drawing no red marbles in all three draws is the probability of drawing a non-red marble on the first draw, and then another non-red on the second draw, and another non-red on the third draw, given that the previous draws were non-red.\n\nSo, the probability of first draw being non-red is 16/20 = 4/5.\n\nGiven that the first draw was non-red, there are now 15 non-red marbles left and 19 marbles in total.\n\nSo, the probability of the second draw being non-red is 15/19.\n\nSimilarly, given that the first two draws were non-red, there are now 14 non-red marbles left and 18 marbles in total.\n\nSo, the probability of the third draw being non-red is 14/18 = 7/9.\n\nTherefore, the probability of all three draws being non-red is (4/5) \u00d7 (15/19) \u00d7 (7/9).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, (4/5) \u00d7 (15/19) = (4 \u00d7 15) / (5 \u00d7 19) = 60 / 95 = 12/19.\n\nThen, (12/19) \u00d7 (7/9) = (12 \u00d7 7) / (19 \u00d7 9) = 84 / 171.\n\nSimplifying 84/171 by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 84 \u00f7 3 = 28, 171 \u00f7 3 = 57. So, 28/57.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing no red marbles is 28/57.\n\nThus, the probability of drawing at least one red marble is 1 - 28/57 = 29/57.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nThis reinforces my confidence in the result.\n\nI think I've approached this problem from multiple angles, and each method leads me to the same probability: 29/57.\n\nSo, the final answer is 29/57.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{29}{57}} \\]"
