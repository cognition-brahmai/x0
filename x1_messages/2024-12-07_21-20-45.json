        "content": "So there are 5 red balls and 7 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 12 balls. You're going to pick one ball, look at its color, put it back in the bag, and then pick another ball. You want to know the probability that both balls you pick are red.\n\nFirst, let's understand what probability is. Probability is a way to measure how likely something is to happen. It's usually expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means it's impossible and 1 means it's certain. For example, the probability of picking a red ball from the bag is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls.\n\nIn this case, there are 5 red balls and 12 balls in total, so the probability of picking a red ball on the first pick is 5/12.\n\nNow, because you're putting the ball back after the first pick, the total number of balls remains the same for the second pick. So, the probability of picking a red ball on the second pick is also 5/12.\n\nSince these are two independent events (the outcome of the first pick doesn't affect the second pick because you're putting the ball back), to find the probability of both events happening, you multiply their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, the probability of picking two red balls in a row is (5/12) * (5/12).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n5 multiplied by 5 is 25, and 12 multiplied by 12 is 144. So, it's 25/144.\n\nTo get a decimal, you can divide 25 by 144, which is approximately 0.1736.\n\nTo express it as a percentage, you multiply by 100, so it's about 17.36%.\n\nSo, there's roughly an 17.36% chance that you'll pick two red balls in a row under these conditions.\n\nDoes that make sense? Is there anything else you'd like to know about probability or this specific problem?"
