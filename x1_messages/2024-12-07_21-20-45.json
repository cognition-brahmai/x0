        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to figure out how many girls are in the class since we know there are 30 students in total and 18 of them are boys. So, the number of girls would be:\n\nNumber of girls = Total students - Number of boys\nNumber of girls = 30 - 18\nNumber of girls = 12\n\nNow, we're told that 60% of the boys passed the exam. To find out how many boys passed, we calculate 60% of 18.\n\nNumber of boys who passed = 60% of 18\nNumber of boys who passed = 0.60 * 18\nNumber of boys who passed = 10.8\n\nBut since we can't have a fraction of a student, we'll round this to the nearest whole number. In this case, it's 11 boys passed the exam.\n\nNext, 80% of the girls passed the exam. So, we'll calculate 80% of 12.\n\nNumber of girls who passed = 80% of 12\nNumber of girls who passed = 0.80 * 12\nNumber of girls who passed = 9.6\n\nAgain, rounding to the nearest whole number, that's 10 girls passed the exam.\n\nNow, to find the total number of students who passed the exam, we add the number of boys who passed and the number of girls who passed.\n\nTotal students who passed = Number of boys who passed + Number of girls who passed\nTotal students who passed = 11 + 10\nTotal students who passed = 21\n\nSo, 21 students in total passed the exam.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]"
