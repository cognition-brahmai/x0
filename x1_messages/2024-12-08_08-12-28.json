        "content": "So I've got this problem: I need to figure out how many ways to arrange the letters in the word \"COMPUTER\" with the condition that no two vowels are next to each other. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the vowels and consonants in \"COMPUTER\". The vowels are O, U, E, and the consonants are C, M, P, T, R. So, we have 3 vowels and 5 consonants.\n\nNow, the goal is to arrange these letters so that no two vowels are adjacent. That means, no two vowels should be next to each other in the arrangement.\n\nOne way to approach this is to first arrange the consonants and then find the possible positions to place the vowels such that they are not next to each other.\n\nLet's start by arranging the consonants. There are 5 consonants: C, M, P, T, R. Since all these consonants are distinct, the number of ways to arrange them is 5 factorial, which is 5! = 120.\n\nNow, when we arrange these 5 consonants, there are spaces between them where we can place the vowels. If we have 5 consonants, there are 6 possible spaces where vowels can be placed: one before the first consonant, one after the last consonant, and one between each pair of consonants.\n\nSo, the spaces look like this: _ C _ M _ P _ T _ R _\n\nWe need to place 3 vowels into these 6 spaces, making sure that no two vowels are in the same space. This is because if two vowels are in the same space, they would be adjacent, which violates the condition.\n\nSo, we need to choose 3 out of these 6 spaces to place one vowel each. The number of ways to choose 3 spaces out of 6 is given by the combination formula C(6,3) = 20.\n\nOnce we've chosen the spaces, we need to place the 3 distinct vowels into these spaces. Since the vowels are distinct, the number of ways to arrange them in the chosen spaces is 3! = 6.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to arrange the vowels in the chosen spaces is C(6,3) * 3! = 20 * 6 = 120.\n\nNow, remember that we already have 120 ways to arrange the consonants. So, the total number of arrangements of the word \"COMPUTER\" with no two vowels adjacent is the number of ways to arrange the consonants multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the vowels in the chosen spaces.\n\nThat is, total arrangements = 120 (consonants) * 120 (vowels) = 14,400.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I have arranged the consonants in 5! = 120 ways, and for each of these, I have C(6,3) = 20 ways to choose the spaces for vowels, and then 3! = 6 ways to arrange the vowels in those spaces. So, yes, total arrangements are 120 * 20 * 6 = 14,400.\n\nBut, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the total number of arrangements without any restrictions and then subtract the arrangements where at least two vowels are adjacent.\n\nTotal arrangements without any restrictions are 8! = 40,320, since there are 8 distinct letters.\n\nNow, to find the number of arrangements where at least two vowels are adjacent, it might be easier to use the inclusion-exclusion principle, but that could get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of arrangements where all vowels are separate (which is what we did earlier) and subtract that from the total arrangements to find the arrangements where at least two vowels are adjacent. But wait, that would give me the opposite of what I need.\n\nActually, no. Since I need the arrangements where no two vowels are adjacent, which is exactly what I calculated earlier as 14,400.\n\nBut to verify, let's consider another approach.\n\nSuppose I arrange the vowels first. There are 3 vowels, and they need to be placed in such a way that they are not adjacent. But this seems more complicated because the positions of the consonants affect where the vowels can be placed.\n\nNo, better to stick with the initial approach: arrange consonants first, then find spaces for vowels.\n\nAlternatively, think of the consonants as dividers creating spaces for vowels.\n\nWith 5 consonants, there are 6 spaces for vowels, as I thought earlier.\n\nChoosing 3 out of these 6 spaces and arranging the vowels in them seems correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is indeed 120 (consonants) * 120 (vowel placements) = 14,400.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any overlaps or misses in this approach.\n\nAre there any arrangements where vowels are adjacent even though we've chosen different spaces?\n\nNo, because each vowel is placed in a separate space between the consonants.\n\nAlso,\u786e\u8ba4\u4e00\u4e0b\u6bcd\u97f3\u548c\u5b50\u97f3\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u662f\u5426\u6b63\u786e\u3002\n\n\u5728\"COMPUTER\"\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bcd\u97f3\u662fO, U, E\uff0c\u5b50\u97f3\u662fC, M, P, T, R\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\n\n\u518d\u8005\uff0c\u5b50\u97f3\u7684\u6392\u5217\u662f5! = 120\u79cd\u3002\n\n\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u9009\u62e96\u4e2a\u7a7a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u76843\u4e2a\u6765\u653e\u7f6e\u6bcd\u97f3\uff0c\u662fC(6,3) = 20\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u3002\n\n\u7136\u540e\uff0c3\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6bcd\u97f3\u5728\u9009\u5b9a\u76843\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u7684\u6392\u5217\u662f3! = 6\u79cd\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u603b\u6570\u662f120 * 20 * 6 = 14,400\u3002\n\n\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\n\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u53ef\u4ee5\u518d\u4ece\u6982\u7387\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u6765\u770b\u4e00\u4e0b\u3002\n\n\u5047\u8bbe\u968f\u673a\u6392\u5217\"COMPUTER\"\u7684\u5b57\u6bcd\uff0c\u6c42\u6ca1\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u6bcd\u97f3\u76f8\u90bb\u7684\u6982\u7387\u3002\n\n\u603b\u6392\u5217\u6570\u662f8! = 40,320\u3002\n\n\u4e4b\u524d\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u65e0\u4e24\u6bcd\u97f3\u76f8\u90bb\u7684\u6392\u5217\u662f14,400\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6982\u7387\u662f14,400 / 40,320 = 0.3571\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u8bf4\u5927\u7ea635.71%\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u8fd9\u53ea\u662f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6392\u5217\u6570\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u5e94\u8be5\u662f14,400\u79cd\u6392\u5217\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14400} \\]"
