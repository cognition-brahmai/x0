        "content": "Let's see. There are 50 people in the room. Half of them are wearing glasses, so that means 50 divided by 2, which is 25 people wearing glasses. Now, out of these 25 people wearing glasses, 1/4 of them have blue eyes. So, I need to find out what's 1/4 of 25. That would be 25 divided by 4, which is 6.25. But how can you have 6.25 people? Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. If half of the 50 people are wearing glasses, that's 25 people. Then, 1/4 of those 25 have blue eyes. So, 1/4 of 25 is 6.25. Hmm, maybe it's okay to have a fraction of a person in this context, but it seems weird. Maybe the problem expects a whole number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that 1/4 of the people wearing glasses have blue eyes, but maybe it's intended to be interpreted that these are the only people with blue eyes in the room. But the question specifically asks for the number of people with blue eyes who are wearing glasses, so maybe it's just 6.25.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the number of people should be a whole number, so maybe the problem has a mistake or needs more information. Or maybe I need to assume that the fractions result in whole numbers.\n\nLet me try another approach. If half of the 50 people are wearing glasses, that's 25 people. Then, 1/4 of those 25 are wearing glasses and have blue eyes. So, 1/4 of 25 is 6.25. Maybe the problem expects me to round it to the nearest whole number, which would be 6 or 7. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed to have exact whole numbers, so perhaps there's a mistake in my calculation. Let me double-check the steps.\n\nTotal people: 50\n\nHalf wearing glasses: 50 / 2 = 25\n\n1/4 of those wearing glasses have blue eyes: 25 * 1/4 = 6.25\n\nHmm, still getting 6.25. Maybe the problem is hypothetical and accepts a fractional person for the sake of the example. In that case, the answer is 6.25 people with blue eyes are wearing glasses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that 1/4 of the people in the room have blue eyes and are wearing glasses. But the wording specifies that 1/4 of those wearing glasses have blue eyes, so my initial approach seems correct.\n\nI think the answer is 6.25 people, but since you can't have a fraction of a person, maybe the problem needs to be re-examined or perhaps the answer is expected to be rounded.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6.25} \\]"
