        "content": "Let's see. So, the store sells two types of candies: chocolate bars and lollipops. The ratio of chocolate bars to lollipops sold is 3:7, and the total number of candies sold is 500. I need to find out how many chocolate bars were sold.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio of 3:7 means that for every 3 chocolate bars sold, there are 7 lollipops sold. So, the total parts of the ratio are 3 + 7 = 10 parts.\n\nNow, if there are 10 parts in total and the store sold 500 candies, that means each part represents 500 divided by 10, which is 50 candies per part.\n\nSince chocolate bars make up 3 parts of the ratio, the number of chocolate bars sold would be 3 parts times 50 candies per part, which is 150 chocolate bars.\n\nLet me double-check that. If chocolate bars are 3 parts, and each part is 50, then 3 times 50 is indeed 150. And for lollipops, which are 7 parts, 7 times 50 is 350.\n\nAdding those together, 150 chocolate bars plus 350 lollipops equals 500 candies, which matches the total given. So, my answer should be correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
