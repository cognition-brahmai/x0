        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 5 blue marbles, 3 red marbles, and 2 green marbles in a bag. I need to find the probability of drawing two blue marbles in a row without replacing the first one back into the bag. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the event is drawing two blue marbles one after another without putting the first one back.\n\nSo, step one is to find the probability of drawing a blue marble on the first draw. There are 5 blue marbles and a total of 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 marbles in the bag. Therefore, the probability of drawing a blue marble first is 5/10, which simplifies to 1/2.\n\nNow, since we're not replacing the first marble back into the bag, the total number of marbles decreases by one after the first draw. So, for the second draw, there are now 9 marbles left in the bag. If the first marble drawn was blue, there are now 4 blue marbles left.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a second blue marble is 4/9.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening consecutively, I need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event. So, it's the probability of the first blue marble times the probability of the second blue marble given that the first was blue.\n\nThat is: (5/10) * (4/9) = (1/2) * (4/9) = 4/18, which simplifies to 2/9.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If I multiply 5/10 by 4/9, that's 20/90, which reduces to 2/9. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 blue marbles out of 5 is C(5,2), and the total number of ways to choose any 2 marbles out of 10 is C(10,2). So, the probability would be C(5,2)/C(10,2).\n\nLet's calculate that. C(5,2) is (5*4)/2 = 10, and C(10,2) is (10*9)/2 = 45. So, 10/45 simplifies to 2/9. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the reduction in the sample space after each draw. First draw: 5 blue out of 10. Second draw: 4 blue out of 9, without replacement.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the probability is 2/9.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. The marbles are all assumed to be equally likely to be drawn, right? No information suggests that some marbles are heavier or smaller or anything like that. So, I think it's fair to assume that each marble has an equal chance of being drawn.\n\nAlso, the fact that there are marbles of different colors doesn't affect the calculation, as the question is specifically about drawing two blue marbles in a row.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if the colors mattered in some way. For example, if there was some dependency between the colors, but the problem doesn't suggest that.\n\nAdditionally, the problem specifies \"without replacement,\" so I correctly accounted for that by decreasing the total number of marbles and the number of blue marbles for the second draw.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The probability is indeed 2/9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{9}} \\]"
