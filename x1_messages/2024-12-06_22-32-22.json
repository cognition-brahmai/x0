        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A farmer has a rectangular field that's 120 meters long and 80 meters wide, and he wants to divide it into equal square plots. I need to figure out what the largest possible size for each square plot is.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to divide a rectangle into equal square plots. Each square plot should be the same size, and they should cover the entire field without any overlap or gaps. So, the side length of each square plot has to be a divisor of both the length and the width of the field.\n\nIn other words, I'm looking for a number that can divide both 120 and 80 completely, without leaving any remainder. And since I want the largest possible square plot, I need to find the largest such number.\n\nHmm, this sounds like I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 120 and 80. The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. That should give me the side length of the largest possible square plot.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD of two numbers. One way is to list all the divisors of each number and find the largest one that's common to both. But that might be time-consuming for larger numbers. Another method is to use prime factorization.\n\nSo, first, I'll find the prime factors of 120 and 80.\n\nStarting with 120:\n\n120 divided by 2 is 60,\n\n60 divided by 2 is 30,\n\n30 divided by 2 is 15,\n\n15 divided by 3 is 5,\n\nand 5 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 120 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5, or 2^3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5.\n\nNow, for 80:\n\n80 divided by 2 is 40,\n\n40 divided by 2 is 20,\n\n20 divided by 2 is 10,\n\n10 divided by 2 is 5,\n\nand 5 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 80 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5, or 2^3 \u00d7 5.\n\nTo find the GCD, I need to take the lowest power of all the common prime factors. Here, the common prime factors are 2 and 5.\n\nThe lowest power of 2 in both factorizations is 2^3, and for 5, it's 5^1.\n\nSo, GCD = 2^3 \u00d7 5 = 8 \u00d7 5 = 40.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible size for each square plot is 40 meters on each side.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me check.\n\nIf each square plot is 40 meters by 40 meters, then the number of plots along the length of the field would be 120 divided by 40, which is 3, and along the width, 80 divided by 40, which is 2. So, overall, there would be 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 square plots.\n\nAnd since 40 is the GCD of 120 and 80, I don't think there's a larger number that divides both 120 and 80. Let me confirm that.\n\nWhat's the next largest divisor of both 120 and 80? Well, looking at the prime factors, if I take 2^2 \u00d7 5 = 4 \u00d7 5 = 20, that's 20. But 20 is smaller than 40, so 40 is indeed larger.\n\nAlternatively, 2^2 \u00d7 5 = 20, 2^1 \u00d7 5 = 10, 2^0 \u00d7 5 = 5, and so on. Nothing larger than 40 divides both 120 and 80.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD. According to that, to find GCD of 120 and 80, I can divide 120 by 80 and find the remainder.\n\n120 divided by 80 is 1, with a remainder of 40.\n\nThen, I take GCD of 80 and 40.\n\n80 divided by 40 is 2, with a remainder of 0.\n\nSo, when the remainder is 0, the divisor at that step is the GCD, which is 40.\n\nThis matches what I found earlier using prime factorization.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible size for each square plot is 40 meters.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to divide the field into equal square plots.\n\nSuppose I consider a square plot size of 10 meters. Then, along the length, I'd have 120 / 10 = 12 plots, and along the width, 80 / 10 = 8 plots, totaling 12 \u00d7 8 = 96 plots. But that's smaller than the 40-meter plots.\n\nOr, if I take 20-meter plots: 120 / 20 = 6 plots along the length, 80 / 20 = 4 plots along the width, totaling 24 plots. Still smaller than 40-meter plots.\n\nWait, no, actually, 20-meter plots would result in more plots, but the question is about the largest possible size of each square plot.\n\nSo, in terms of size per plot, 40 meters is larger than 20 meters.\n\nI think I might be confusing \"largest number of plots\" with \"largest size per plot.\" The larger the size of each plot, the fewer plots there will be, which makes sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to choose smaller plots, I'd get more plots, but the problem specifically asks for the largest possible size of each square plot.\n\nTherefore, sticking with 40 meters as the side length of each square plot.\n\nLet me also consider if there's any restriction on the number of plots, but the problem doesn't specify any particular number of plots, only that they should be equal square plots, and we're to find the largest possible size.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be 40 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
