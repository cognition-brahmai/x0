        "content": "Let's see. So we have two trains here. One leaves Station A at 6 PM going 60 miles per hour, and the other leaves Station B at 7 PM going 80 miles per hour. Station B is 120 miles away from Station A. I need to figure out when they'll meet.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how far each train has traveled by the time they meet. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. Wait, but one leaves an hour after the other, so I need to account for that.\n\nLet me think about it step by step.\n\nTrain A leaves at 6 PM at 60 mph.\n\nTrain B leaves at 7 PM at 80 mph.\n\nThe distance between Station A and Station B is 120 miles.\n\nI need to find the time when they meet.\n\nMaybe I can set up an equation for their positions.\n\nLet's denote the time after 7 PM as t hours.\n\nSo, at time t after 7 PM:\n\n- Train A has been traveling for t + 1 hours (since it left at 6 PM).\n\n- Train B has been traveling for t hours.\n\nThe distance covered by Train A would be 60 * (t + 1) miles.\n\nThe distance covered by Train B would be 80 * t miles.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they've covered should equal the initial distance between them, which is 120 miles.\n\nSo:\n\n60(t + 1) + 80t = 120\n\nNow, I can solve for t.\n\nFirst, expand the equation:\n\n60t + 60 + 80t = 120\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n140t + 60 = 120\n\nSubtract 60 from both sides:\n\n140t = 60\n\nNow, divide both sides by 140:\n\nt = 60 / 140 = 3 / 7 hours\n\nHmm, 3/7 hours. I need to convert that to minutes to find the exact time.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\n(3/7) * 60 = 180/7 \u2248 25.714 minutes\n\nSo, approximately 25 minutes and 43 seconds (since 0.714 * 60 \u2248 43 seconds).\n\nTherefore, they will meet at approximately 7:25 PM and 43 seconds.\n\nWait a minute, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting equation:\n\n60(t + 1) + 80t = 120\n\nExpanding:\n\n60t + 60 + 80t = 120\n\nCombining:\n\n140t + 60 = 120\n\nSubtract 60:\n\n140t = 60\n\nDivide by 140:\n\nt = 60/140 = 3/7 hours\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, converting 3/7 hours to minutes:\n\n(3/7) * 60 = 180/7 \u2248 25.714 minutes\n\nSo, approximately 25 minutes and 43 seconds.\n\nTherefore, if Train B leaves at 7:00 PM, they will meet at around 7:25:43 PM.\n\nBut, to be more precise, perhaps I should leave it in fractional form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of relative speed.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds: 60 + 80 = 140 mph.\n\nHowever, since Train A has a head start of 1 hour, it covers 60 miles in that hour, reducing the initial distance between them to 120 - 60 = 60 miles.\n\nNow, with both trains moving towards each other at a combined speed of 140 mph, the time to cover the remaining 60 miles is:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed = 60 / 140 = 3/7 hours, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the meeting time is indeed 3/7 hours after 7 PM.\n\nTo express this more neatly, perhaps I can convert 3/7 hours into minutes and seconds.\n\nAs previously calculated, 3/7 hours is approximately 25 minutes and 43 seconds.\n\nTherefore, they will meet at approximately 7:25:43 PM.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider only minutes, 3/7 hours is exactly 25.7142... minutes, which is 25 minutes and 0.7142*60 \u2248 42.857 seconds, so roughly 25 minutes and 43 seconds.\n\nThus, the meeting time is approximately 7:25:43 PM.\n\nBut for practical purposes, perhaps it's acceptable to say 7:25 PM.\n\nHowever, to be more precise, 7:25:43 PM would be more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the fractional part more carefully:\n\n0.7142 minutes is approximately 42.857 seconds, which is roughly 43 seconds.\n\nSo, 7:25:43 PM.\n\nTherefore, the two trains will meet at approximately 7:25:43 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7:25\\ \\text{PM and}\\ 43\\ \\text{seconds}} \\]"
