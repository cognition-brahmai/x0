        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company that produces two types of widgets: type A and type B. The production cost for each type A widget is $20, and for each type B widget, it's $25. The company plans to produce a total of 200 widgets with a total production cost of $4500. We need to figure out how many of each type they should produce.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of type A widgets.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of type B widgets.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of widgets is 200.\n\n2. The total production cost is $4500.\n\nSo, we can write two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 200 \\) (since the total number of widgets is 200)\n\n2. \\( 20x + 25y = 4500 \\) (since the total cost is $4500, with type A costing $20 each and type B costing $25 each)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. I think substitution might be straightforward here.\n\nFirst, from equation 1, we can express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\):\n\n\\( x = 200 - y \\)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into equation 2:\n\n\\( 20(200 - y) + 25y = 4500 \\)\n\nLet's simplify this:\n\n\\( 4000 - 20y + 25y = 4500 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 4000 + 5y = 4500 \\)\n\nNow, subtract 4000 from both sides:\n\n\\( 5y = 500 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n\\( y = 100 \\)\n\nSo, the number of type B widgets is 100.\n\nNow, substitute \\( y = 100 \\) back into the expression for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 200 - 100 = 100 \\)\n\nTherefore, the company should produce 100 type A widgets and 100 type B widgets.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check this to make sure it adds up correctly.\n\nIf they produce 100 type A widgets at $20 each, that's \\( 100 \\times 20 = 2000 \\) dollars.\n\nFor type B widgets, 100 at $25 each, that's \\( 100 \\times 25 = 2500 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal cost: \\( 2000 + 2500 = 4500 \\) dollars, which matches the given total production cost.\n\nAlso, the total number of widgets is \\( 100 + 100 = 200 \\), which matches the required total.\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using ratios or percentages.\n\nThinking about the average cost per widget. The total cost is $4500 for 200 widgets, so the average cost per widget is \\( \\frac{4500}{200} = 22.5 \\) dollars.\n\nNow, type A costs $20 and type B costs $25. The average is $22.5, which is right in the middle. In fact, it's the midpoint between 20 and 25, which suggests that the number of type A and type B widgets should be equal.\n\nIndeed, that's what we found: 100 of each type.\n\nThis gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nBut let's consider if there's a way to generalize this or if there are other scenarios to consider.\n\nSuppose the total number of widgets or the total cost was different. The method would still apply: set up the equations and solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nAlternatively, if there were more types of widgets, we would have more variables and more equations to solve accordingly.\n\nIn this case, with only two types, the system is straightforward to solve.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. The company should produce 100 type A widgets and 100 type B widgets to meet their production goals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100 \\text{ type A widgets and } 100 \\text{ type B widgets}} \\]"
