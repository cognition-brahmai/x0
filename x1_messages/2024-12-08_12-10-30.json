The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, but it's most notably used for credit card numbers. It was created by IBM scientist Hans Peter Luhn.\n\nThe algorithm is designed to protect against accidental errors, such as transposed digits, and can detect about 90% of all possible single-digit errors and most significant digit transpositions. However, it's important to note that it's not a security feature; it doesn't protect against intentional fraud or malicious actors.\n\nHere's how the Luhn algorithm works:\n\n1. **Starting from the Right:** Begin with the digit immediately to the left of the check digit (the last digit). This is the first digit to consider in the algorithm.\n\n2. **Double Every Second Digit:** Moving from right to left, double every second digit. If the result of this doubling operation is greater than 9 (e.g., 8 * 2 = 16), then add the digits of the product (e.g., 16: 1 + 6 = 7, 18: 1 + 8 = 9).\n\n3. **Sum All Digits:** Add up all the digits, including the check digit.\n\n4. **Check for Divisibility by 10:** If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 (if the total ends in zero), then the number is valid according to the Luhn formula; otherwise, it's not valid.\n\nNow, let's implement this in JavaScript. I'll write a function called `validateCreditCard` that takes a string as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the card number is valid.\n\nHere's the step-by-step code with explanations:\n\n```javascript\nfunction validateCreditCard(cardNumber) {\n    // Step 1: Convert the input string into an array of numbers\n    const digits = cardNumber.split('').map(Number);\n    \n    // Step 2: Identify the check digit (last digit)\n    const checkDigit = digits.pop();\n    \n    // Step 3: Reverse the array to start from the right (excluding the check digit)\n    digits.reverse();\n    \n    // Step 4: Double every second digit\n    for (let i = 0; i < digits.length; i++) {\n        if ((i + 1) % 2 === 0) {\n            digits[i] *= 2;\n            // If the result is greater than 9, subtract 9\n            if (digits[i] > 9) {\n                digits[i] -= 9;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Step 5: Sum all the digits, including the check digit\n    const total = digits.reduce((sum, digit) => sum + digit, 0) + checkDigit;\n    \n    // Step 6: Check if the total is divisible by 10\n    return total % 10 === 0;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconsole.log(validateCreditCard(\"4532015112830366\")); // Should return true\nconsole.log(validateCreditCard(\"6011514433546201\")); // Should return false\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Convert the input string into an array of numbers:** This makes it easier to manipulate individual digits.\n\n2. **Identify the check digit:** The last digit of the card number is the check digit, which we'll use to verify the validity.\n\n3. **Reverse the array:** This allows us to start processing from the right, excluding the check digit.\n\n4. **Double every second digit:** Starting from the first digit (excluding the check digit), double every second digit. If the result is greater than 9, subtract 9 to get the sum of the digits.\n\n5. **Sum all the digits:** Include the check digit in this sum.\n\n6. **Check divisibility by 10:** If the total sum is divisible by 10, the card number is valid.\n\nThis function should work for most credit card numbers, but keep in mind that different card networks have different lengths and starting digits, which aren't accounted for in this basic Luhn validation. For a more comprehensive validation, you might need to include additional checks for card length and prefix."
