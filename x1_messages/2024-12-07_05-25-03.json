        "content": "So there are 12 socks in a drawer: 6 black and 6 white. It's completely dark, so I can't see which color I'm picking. I need to figure out the minimum number of socks I need to pull out to guarantee that I have at least one matching pair.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a matching pair means. A matching pair would be two socks of the same color, either both black or both white.\n\nNow, since there are only two colors, black and white, I need to consider the worst-case scenario to ensure that I have at least one matching pair.\n\nLet's think about it step by step.\n\nIf I pull out one sock, it can be either black or white. I don't have a pair yet because I only have one sock.\n\nIf I pull out a second sock, there are two possibilities:\n\n1. It's the same color as the first sock. In this case, I have a matching pair.\n\n2. It's a different color from the first sock. So, I have one black and one white sock.\n\nIn the first scenario, I have a matching pair, which is what I want.\n\nIn the second scenario, I don't have a matching pair yet, but I have one sock of each color.\n\nNow, if I pull out a third sock, there are again two possibilities:\n\n1. It matches the first sock's color.\n\n2. It matches the second sock's color.\n\nIn either case, I will have at least two socks of the same color, which is a matching pair.\n\nSo, in the worst-case scenario, I pull out one black and one white sock first, and then the third sock will definitely give me a matching pair.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of socks I need to pull out to guarantee at least one matching pair is three.\n\nWait a minute, is there a chance that pulling out three socks isn't enough? Let's think about it.\n\nIf I pull out three socks, the possible combinations are:\n\n- All three are black.\n\n- All three are white.\n\n- Two black and one white.\n\n- Two white and one black.\n\nIn all these cases, I have at least one matching pair.\n\nIs there a possibility where I don't have a matching pair with three socks? No, because if I have three socks and only two colors, at least two of them must be the same color.\n\nThis seems to make sense, but maybe I should consider more.\n\nLet me think about the pigeonhole principle. The pigeonhole principle states that if you have more items than containers, at least one container must contain more than one item.\n\nIn this case, the \"containers\" are the colors, and the \"items\" are the socks.\n\nThere are two colors (containers) and I'm pulling out socks (items).\n\nAccording to the pigeonhole principle, if I pull out three socks, with two colors, at least one color must have at least two socks.\n\nThis confirms that pulling out three socks guarantees at least one matching pair.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if pulling out two socks could sometimes give me a matching pair.\n\nYes, sometimes pulling out two socks will give me a matching pair if they happen to be the same color.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that I pull out one black and one white sock, which doesn't give me a matching pair.\n\nTherefore, pulling out two socks does not guarantee a matching pair, because there's a possibility of getting one of each color.\n\nOn the other hand, pulling out three socks ensures that at least two of them are the same color, regardless of which colors they are.\n\nSo, the minimum number of socks I need to pull out to guarantee at least one matching pair is three.\n\nBut wait, what if there were more colors? Let's say there were three colors: black, white, and blue.\n\nIn that case, the minimum number to guarantee a matching pair would be four socks, because in the worst case, I could have one of each color, and the fourth sock would match one of them.\n\nBut in this problem, there are only two colors: black and white.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number is three.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nSuppose I pull out one sock, and it's black.\n\nThen I pull out another sock, and it's white.\n\nNow, I have one black and one white sock, no matching pair.\n\nThen I pull out a third sock.\n\nIt must be either black or white.\n\nIf it's black, I have two black socks.\n\nIf it's white, I have two white socks.\n\nIn either case, I have a matching pair.\n\nTherefore, three socks are sufficient.\n\nIs there a way to have two socks and still not have a matching pair? Yes, if they are different colors.\n\nTherefore, two socks do not guarantee a matching pair.\n\nHence, the minimum number is three.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overthinking this.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the number of colors.\n\nWith two colors, the worst-case scenario is having one of each color after pulling out two socks.\n\nThe next sock pulled out must match one of the colors already drawn.\n\nTherefore, three socks guarantee at least one matching pair.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is three.\n\nBut let's see if the number of socks in the drawer affects this.\n\nThere are 12 socks: 6 black and 6 white.\n\nBut actually, the number of socks in the drawer doesn't matter for this particular problem, as long as there are at least two socks of each color.\n\nThe key is the number of colors, not the total number of socks.\n\nSo, even if there were 100 socks, with 50 black and 50 white, the minimum number to guarantee a matching pair would still be three.\n\nHowever, if there were more colors, the number would change.\n\nFor example, if there were three colors, I would need to pull out four socks to guarantee a matching pair.\n\nBut in this case, with only two colors, three socks are sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the answer is three.\n\nI think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
