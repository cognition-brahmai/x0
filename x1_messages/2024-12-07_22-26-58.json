Each step in your plan should correlate to an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the accessible functions when given an input string that could be the user's inquiry, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n1. YahooSearch[input]: A tool that enables the user to conduct an online search via the Yahoo search engine. This tool is useful for finding a variety of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\n2. WebCrawler[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string, which includes newline separated links, and yields plain text output containing the site's content.\n3. HyperlinkExtractor[input]: Extracts hyperlinks from plain text and produces a plain text, newline separated response of links.\n4. QuerySolver[input]: A question-answering language model, particularly adept at providing answers based on an input text passage. The input needs to be a text question that refers to an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nEach function requires just a simple string as input, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., QuerySolver[What is the capital of France, given :evidence3:?]\n\nEnsure only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should be structured as follows:\nPlan: [First action to take based on the input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action to take, based on the result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to call and input parameter, which may reference previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What is the significance of the Battle of Waterloo and how did it impact Europe?"
