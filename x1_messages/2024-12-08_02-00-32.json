Thou potion divine, that doth inspire\nThe sluggish mind to thoughts of loftier fire;\nA friend in morning's early light, when all\nIs hushed and still, save for the bird's sweet call.\n\nIn yonder kitchen, where the sun doth break\nThrough window's pane, and on the walls doth make\nA pattern fair of light and shadow play,\nThere stands the pot, a symbol of the day.\n\nThe beans, so dark and rich, like earth's own core,\nAre ground to dust, and in the water's roar\nThey mingle, dance, and brew a liquid gold,\nThat wakes the senses and the spirit bold.\n\nI take thee, coffee, in thy cup of clay,\nAnd raise thee high, as to the gods of yore,\nAnd drink thee in, with sips that slow betray\nThe pleasure deep, the warmth that doth restore.\n\nThou art the solace of the weary soul,\nThe comforter in times when hopes grow cold;\nA balm for cares, a cure for earthly pain,\nA friend that never doth betray or wane.\n\nSo let me toast thee, coffee, dear and true,\nIn this, thy verse, where Wordsworth's pen doth sue\nFor thy fair praise, and in thy honor sing,\nA lay of love, that doth thy worth proclaim.\n\nFor thou art more than mere refreshment rare;\nThou art a muse, that doth the poet dare\nTo reach beyond, to touch the skies above,\nAnd find in thee a wellspring of thy love.\n\nSo here's to coffee, strong and black as night,\nThat doth illuminate the darkest plight;\nA beacon bright, a guiding star so true,\nIn life's vast sea, where we doth navigate anew."
