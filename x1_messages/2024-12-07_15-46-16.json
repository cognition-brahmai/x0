        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a box containing red balls and blue balls. It says that there are twice as many red balls as blue balls, and there are 15 blue balls. I need to find out how many balls there are in total in the box.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I know that there are blue balls and red balls in the box. The number of red balls is twice the number of blue balls. So, if there are 15 blue balls, then the number of red balls should be 2 times 15, right?\n\nLet me calculate that: 2 times 15 is 30. So, there are 30 red balls.\n\nNow, to find the total number of balls in the box, I need to add the number of blue balls and the number of red balls together. That would be 15 blue balls plus 30 red balls.\n\nLet's add those up: 15 + 30 equals 45.\n\nSo, there are 45 balls in total in the box.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything I'm missing here? Let me double-check. The problem says there are twice as many red balls as blue balls, and there are 15 blue balls. I multiplied 15 by 2 to get 30 red balls, and then added them together to get 45. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any other colors or any trick in the problem. The problem only mentions red and blue balls, so I think it's safe to assume that those are the only colors in the box.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a possibility that some balls are both red and blue, but that doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. It's probably just red and blue separate balls.\n\nSo, I think my answer is correct. There are 45 balls in total in the box.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
