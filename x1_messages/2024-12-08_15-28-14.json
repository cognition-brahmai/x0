        "content": "So Tom can paint a room in 6 hours, and Jane can do it in 8 hours. If they both start painting at the same time, how long will it take them to finish together? Hmm, this seems like a problem about working together or combined work rates.\n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out how much of the room each person can paint per hour. That way, I can see how much they can do together in one hour.\n\nSo, Tom can paint the whole room in 6 hours. That means, in one hour, he paints 1/6 of the room.\n\nSimilarly, Jane can paint the whole room in 8 hours, so in one hour, she paints 1/8 of the room.\n\nNow, if they work together, in one hour, they should paint the sum of what each can paint individually in an hour. So, together, they paint 1/6 + 1/8 of the room in one hour.\n\nI need to add those fractions. To add 1/6 and 1/8, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 8 is 24.\n\nSo, 1/6 is equal to 4/24, and 1/8 is equal to 3/24.\n\nAdding those together: 4/24 + 3/24 = 7/24.\n\nThat means, together, they paint 7/24 of the room in one hour.\n\nNow, to find out how long it takes them to paint the whole room, I need to divide the whole room (which is 1) by the rate at which they paint together (which is 7/24 per hour).\n\nSo, time = 1 / (7/24) = 24/7 hours.\n\n24/7 is approximately 3.4286 hours.\n\nBut maybe I can express that as hours and minutes. Let's see.\n\n3 hours is 3 hours, and 0.4286 hours needs to be converted to minutes.\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, 0.4286 hours * 60 minutes/hour \u2248 25.714 minutes.\n\nSo, approximately, it would take them 3 hours and 26 minutes to paint the room together.\n\nWait a minute, but I should check if there's a better way to express 24/7 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I can leave the answer as a fraction: 24/7 hours.\n\nOr, calculate it more precisely.\n\nLet me see: 24 divided by 7 is 3 with a remainder of 3, so 3 and 3/7 hours.\n\nNow, 3/7 of an hour to minutes: 3/7 * 60 \u2248 25.714 minutes.\n\nSo, 3 hours and 25.714 minutes.\n\nRounding to the nearest minute, it's about 3 hours and 26 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to be more precise, I can keep it as 24/7 hours.\n\nBut maybe the question expects the answer in hours as a fraction.\n\nLet me see: the exact time is 24/7 hours.\n\nSo, it's 24/7 hours, which is approximately 3.42857 hours.\n\nBut perhaps I can think of it in minutes.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 24/7 * 60 minutes.\n\n24/7 * 60 = (24 * 60)/7 = 1440/7 \u2248 205.714 minutes.\n\nSo, approximately 205 minutes and about 43 seconds.\n\nBut maybe it's better to stick with the fractional hours.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for combined work rates.\n\nI recall that if one person can do a job in A hours and another in B hours, together they can do it in (A*B)/(A+B) hours.\n\nSo, in this case, A = 6 hours, B = 8 hours.\n\nSo, time together = (6*8)/(6+8) = 48/14 = 24/7 hours.\n\nWhich matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, that's a quicker way to do it.\n\nBut I think it's important to understand where that formula comes from, which is essentially what I did initially by adding the rates.\n\nSo, in conclusion, it will take them 24/7 hours to paint the room together, which is approximately 3 hours and 26 minutes.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{7} \\text{ hours}} \\]"
