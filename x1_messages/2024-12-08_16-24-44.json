        "content": "Let's see. The bakery wants to increase its bread production from 2,000 loaves a day to 3,500 loaves a day. They're planning to do this by adding new ovens. Each new oven can bake 100 loaves per hour, and the bakery operates for 12 hours a day. I need to figure out how many additional ovens are required to meet this new production goal.\n\nFirst, I should find out how much more production is needed. The current production is 2,000 loaves a day, and the target is 3,500 loaves a day. So, the increase needed is:\n\n3,500 loaves - 2,000 loaves = 1,500 loaves per day.\n\nNow, I need to find out how much production each new oven can add per day. Each oven can bake 100 loaves per hour, and the bakery operates for 12 hours a day. So, each oven can produce:\n\n100 loaves/hour * 12 hours/day = 1,200 loaves per day.\n\nOkay, so each new oven can add 1,200 loaves to the daily production.\n\nNow, to find out how many ovens are needed to produce the additional 1,500 loaves, I can divide the required additional production by the production capacity of one oven:\n\n1,500 loaves / 1,200 loaves/oven = 1.25 ovens.\n\nBut I can't have a fraction of an oven, so I need to round up to the next whole number because even if the additional production is partially met by an oven, I still need to install a whole oven. So, the bakery needs to add 2 ovens.\n\nWait a minute, let me check if 2 ovens would exceed the required production. If each oven produces 1,200 loaves per day, then 2 ovens would produce:\n\n2 ovens * 1,200 loaves/oven = 2,400 loaves per day.\n\nBut the bakery only needs an additional 1,500 loaves. So, 2 ovens would actually produce more than needed, but since I can't have a fraction of an oven, 2 is the minimum number required to meet or exceed the target.\n\nAlternatively, if the bakery is okay with producing more than 3,500 loaves, then 2 ovens would be sufficient. But if they want to minimize excess production, they might consider other options.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps the bakery can adjust the operating hours or find other efficiencies, but based on the information provided, it seems that adding ovens is the only option.\n\nLet me consider if there are any constraints or other factors that might affect this decision. For example, is there enough space in the bakery for additional ovens? Or are there any cost considerations? But the question doesn't provide that information, so I'll assume that the only concern is to meet the production target.\n\nAlso, I should confirm the current production capacity. The bakery currently produces 2,000 loaves a day. I should find out how many ovens they currently have to see if there's a pattern or if the new ovens are similar in capacity to the existing ones.\n\nLet me assume that the current ovens have the same capacity as the new ones. If each oven produces 1,200 loaves per day, then the current number of ovens can be calculated as:\n\nCurrent production / production per oven = 2,000 loaves / 1,200 loaves/oven \u2248 1.666 ovens.\n\nAgain, since you can't have a fraction of an oven, this suggests that the bakery currently has 2 ovens, producing 2,400 loaves per day. But the question says they currently produce 2,000 loaves daily. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nMaybe the current ovens have different capacities or there are other constraints in the production process. Or perhaps there are inefficiencies or downtime that reduces the actual output from the current ovens.\n\nBut since the question doesn't provide details about the current ovens, I'll proceed with the assumption that the current production is 2,000 loaves per day, and the new ovens can each produce 1,200 loaves per day.\n\nSo, to meet the target of 3,500 loaves per day, the bakery needs an additional 1,500 loaves. With each new oven providing 1,200 loaves per day, they would need at least 2 ovens to reach or exceed the required increase.\n\nTherefore, the bakery should add 2 ovens.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check the total production with 2 additional ovens:\n\nCurrent production: 2,000 loaves\n\nAdditional production from 2 ovens: 2 * 1,200 = 2,400 loaves\n\nTotal production: 2,000 + 2,400 = 4,400 loaves per day.\n\nWait, that's more than the target of 3,500 loaves. So, perhaps there's a better way to meet the exact target without overproducing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bakery can operate the new ovens for fewer hours or find another way to adjust production, but based on the information given, the ovens operate for 12 hours a day.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the total production capacity needed and then determine the number of ovens required.\n\nThe target is 3,500 loaves per day.\n\nEach oven produces 1,200 loaves per day.\n\nSo, the total number of ovens required is:\n\nTotal loaves needed / loaves per oven = 3,500 / 1,200 \u2248 2.916 ovens.\n\nAgain, since you can't have a fraction of an oven, the bakery would need to have 3 ovens to meet the target.\n\nBut wait, currently, they produce 2,000 loaves with, presumably, less than 2 ovens, but as per my earlier calculation, 2 ovens would produce 2,400 loaves, which is more than the current production. Maybe there are other factors affecting production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current ovens are not operating at full capacity, and there is room to increase production without adding new ovens.\n\nBut again, the question seems to imply that adding new ovens is the way to increase production.\n\nGiven that, and considering that 2 ovens would produce 2,400 loaves, which, when added to the current 2,000 loaves, would exceed the target of 3,500 loaves, but 1 oven would only add 1,200 loaves, resulting in a total of 3,200 loaves, which is still short of the target.\n\nSo, with 1 additional oven: 2,000 + 1,200 = 3,200 loaves.\n\nWith 2 additional ovens: 2,000 + 2,400 = 4,400 loaves.\n\nThe target is 3,500 loaves, so adding 2 ovens would exceed the target by 900 loaves, while adding 1 oven would fall short by 300 loaves.\n\nTherefore, to meet or exceed the target, the bakery needs to add 2 ovens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bakery can find a way to utilize the existing resources more efficiently to bridge the gap, but without additional information, adding 2 ovens seems to be the straightforward solution.\n\nIn conclusion, the bakery needs to add 2 ovens to meet or exceed the production target of 3,500 loaves per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
