        "content": "So I've got this investment problem here. I need to figure out how much $5,000 will grow to in 2 years with an annual interest rate of 4%, and it's compounded quarterly. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for compound interest. I think it's something like:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount, which is the initial amount of money, so that's $5,000.\n\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate, which is 4%, but I need to write that as a decimal, so that's 0.04.\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's compounded quarterly, that means four times a year.\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time the money is invested for, in years, which is 2 years.\n\nSo, plugging in these values:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.04}{4}\\right)^{4 \\times 2} \\]\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the interest rate per quarter:\n\n\\[ \\frac{0.04}{4} = 0.01 \\]\n\nSo, each quarter, the interest rate is 1%.\n\nNext, calculate the base of the exponent:\n\n\\[ 1 + 0.01 = 1.01 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the exponent:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 2 = 8 \\]\n\nSo, I need to raise 1.01 to the power of 8:\n\n\\[ 1.01^8 \\]\n\nLet me compute that. I can use a calculator for this.\n\n\\[ 1.01^8 \\approx 1.082856 \\]\n\nNow, multiply that by the principal amount:\n\n\\[ 5000 \\times 1.082856 = 5414.28 \\]\n\nSo, after 2 years, the investment will be worth approximately $5,414.28.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.04}{4}\\right)^{4 \\times 2} \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1 + 0.01\\right)^8 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\times (1.01)^8 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\times 1.082856 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5414.28 \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it differently to verify. Since the interest is compounded quarterly, each quarter the investment grows by 1%.\n\nSo, starting with $5,000:\n\nAfter first quarter:\n\n\\[ 5000 \\times 1.01 = 5050 \\]\n\nAfter second quarter:\n\n\\[ 5050 \\times 1.01 = 5100.50 \\]\n\nAfter third quarter:\n\n\\[ 5100.50 \\times 1.01 = 5151.51 \\]\n\nAfter fourth quarter (which is after 1 year):\n\n\\[ 5151.51 \\times 1.01 = 5203.02 \\]\n\nAfter fifth quarter:\n\n\\[ 5203.02 \\times 1.01 = 5255.05 \\]\n\nAfter sixth quarter:\n\n\\[ 5255.05 \\times 1.01 = 5307.60 \\]\n\nAfter seventh quarter:\n\n\\[ 5307.60 \\times 1.01 = 5360.68 \\]\n\nAfter eighth quarter (which is after 2 years):\n\n\\[ 5360.68 \\times 1.01 = 5414.28 \\]\n\nSo, again, I get $5,414.28.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the effective annual interest rate and then apply it for 2 years.\n\nThe effective annual interest rate \\( r_{eff} \\) is:\n\n\\[ r_{eff} = \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^n - 1 \\]\n\n\\[ r_{eff} = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.04}{4}\\right)^4 - 1 \\]\n\n\\[ r_{eff} = (1.01)^4 - 1 \\]\n\n\\[ r_{eff} = 1.040604 - 1 = 0.040604 \\]\n\nSo, the effective annual rate is approximately 4.0604%.\n\nNow, applying this for 2 years:\n\n\\[ A = P (1 + r_{eff})^t \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\times (1.040604)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\times 1.082432 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5412.16 \\]\n\nWait, that's slightly different from the previous calculation. Hmm.\n\nIn the first method, I got $5,414.28, and in this method, I got $5,412.16. There's a difference of $2.12. Why is that?\n\nI think the discrepancy comes from using the effective annual rate calculated based on quarterly compounding, but then applying it over 2 years without considering the compounding within each year.\n\nIn the first method, I accounted for each quarterly compounding period separately, which is more accurate for compound interest.\n\nIn the second method, using the effective annual rate, I'm considering the annual effect of quarterly compounding, but when extending it to multiple years, it assumes that each year's interest is compounded once at the effective rate, which isn't exactly accurate because interest is still compounded quarterly within each year.\n\nTherefore, the first method is more precise for this scenario.\n\nSo, I'll stick with the first calculation: $5,414.28.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the general compound interest formula again to confirm.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.04}{4}\\right)^{8} \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1.01\\right)^{8} \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\times 1.082856 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5414.28 \\]\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I use continuous compounding, but that's not applicable here since it's compounded quarterly.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after 2 years, the investment will be worth approximately $5,414.28.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5414.28} \\]"
