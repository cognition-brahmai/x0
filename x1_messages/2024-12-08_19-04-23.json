Each tool can be called with an input string and will produce an output that can be stored in a variable :evidence[n]: which can then be used as input for subsequent tools.\n\nThe available tools are:\n\nBing[input]: This tool allows you to search for information using the Bing search engine. It's useful for finding a list of websites that may contain the answer to your question.\nLinkCollector[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text response containing newline delimited links.\nWebReader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nFactFinder[input]: A question answering model that answers questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., What color is the cat, given :evidence1:?\n\nEach function should receive a plain string as input without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., FactFinder[What is the capital of Michigan, given :evidence3:?]\n\nEnsure only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [first action]\n:evidence0: = [function call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function call and input parameter, referencing previous evidence if necessary]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2019 and what is their most famous work?"
