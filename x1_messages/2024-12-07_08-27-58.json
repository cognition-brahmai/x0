        "content": "So there are 5 red balls and 3 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 8 balls. You're picking one ball, looking at its color, putting it back, and then picking another ball. You want to know the probability that both balls are red.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the probability of picking a red ball on the first try. There are 5 red balls out of 8 total balls, so the probability is 5/8.\n\nNow, because you're putting the ball back, the total number of balls remains the same for the second pick. So, the probability of picking a red ball on the second try is also 5/8.\n\nSince these are independent events\u2014meaning the outcome of the first pick doesn't affect the second pick because you're putting the ball back\u2014we can find the probability of both events happening by multiplying their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, the probability of picking two red balls in a row is (5/8) * (5/8).\n\nLet me calculate that: 5 times 5 is 25, and 8 times 8 is 64. So, it's 25/64.\n\nTo double-check, I can think about it in terms of percentages. 25 divided by 64 is approximately 0.3906, which is about 39.06%. That makes sense because picking two red balls in a row should be less likely than picking one red ball.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it combinatorially. The total number of ways to pick two balls with replacement is 8 * 8 = 64, since there are 8 choices for the first pick and 8 for the second.\n\nThe number of ways to pick two red balls is 5 * 5 = 25, since there are 5 red balls to choose from each time.\n\nSo, again, the probability is 25/64.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I consider the events without replacement, but in this case, it's with replacement, so my initial approach should be correct.\n\nWait a minute, what if the balls are indistinguishable? Does that affect the probability?\n\nWell, the balls are either red or blue, and since they're being picked randomly, their indistinguishability shouldn't affect the probability calculation. It's the counts that matter.\n\nAlso, since it's with replacement, the probability resets for each pick.\n\nSo, I believe 25/64 is the correct probability.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider another angle.\n\nImagine you have a grid of 8 by 8, where each row and column represents the possible outcomes of the first and second picks, respectively.\n\nEach cell in the grid represents a possible outcome of the two picks.\n\nThere are 8 rows and 8 columns, making 64 cells in total.\n\nOut of these, the cells where both picks are red correspond to the first 5 rows and the first 5 columns, which is 5 * 5 = 25 cells.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 25/64.\n\nI think that covers it. I can't think of any reason why this wouldn't be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{64}} \\]"
