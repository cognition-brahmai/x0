For each plan, provide an evidence value which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string.\n\nThese are the tools that can be utilized:\nWebCrawler[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information across the internet. It provides a list of sites that might contain the answer to the user's query.\nContentScraper[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline-delimited links. Input is one or more links, and it outputs plain text containing the content of the links.\nURLExtractor[input]: Extracts links from plain text and generates a plain text, newline-delimited response of links.\nQuerySolver[input]: Question-answering model, particularly effective at answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that refers to a #fact[n] variable, e.g., What color is the dog, given #fact1?\n\nThe input to each function should just be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with a fact variable, e.g., QuerySolver[What is the capital of Spain, given #fact3?]\n\nEnsure to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should be in this format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on the input question]\n#fact0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of #fact0:]\n#fact1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context #fact0\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: [#fact[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who is the director of the movie 'Inception' and what are some other movies they have directed?"
