While Luna is away, David hides the blue ball behind a tree. Luna comes back with the red ball but accidentally drops it into a nearby pond. A stranger walking by picks up the blue ball from behind the tree and continues walking. Unaware of these events, where do Emily and David think the blue ball is?"

Since they were not aware of Luna dropping the red ball into the pond or the stranger picking up the blue ball, they would assume that everything is as they last saw it. So, they probably believe that the blue ball is still behind the tree, waiting to be found."
