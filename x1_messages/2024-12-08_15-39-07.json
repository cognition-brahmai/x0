Each floor has four apartments, and each apartment has a living area of 1,200 square feet. Calculate the total living area in the complex and estimate the number of residents it can accommodate, considering an average household size of 3 people. Also, calculate the total number of parking spaces required if each apartment is allocated 1.5 parking spaces."

        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. First, we need to find out the total living area in the entire residential complex. To do that, we'll start by calculating the number of apartments in one building and then multiply that by the number of buildings.\n\nSo, each building has 20 floors, and each floor has 4 apartments. Therefore, the number of apartments per building is:\n\n20 floors/building * 4 apartments/floor = 80 apartments/building\n\nNow, there are 5 buildings in total, so the total number of apartments in the complex is:\n\n5 buildings * 80 apartments/building = 400 apartments\n\nEach apartment has a living area of 1,200 square feet, so the total living area is:\n\n400 apartments * 1,200 sq ft/apartment = 480,000 sq ft\n\nNext, we need to estimate the number of residents the complex can accommodate, assuming an average household size of 3 people per apartment. So, the total number of residents would be:\n\n400 apartments * 3 residents/apartment = 1,200 residents\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the total number of parking spaces required, with each apartment allocated 1.5 parking spaces. Therefore, the total parking spaces needed are:\n\n400 apartments * 1.5 spaces/apartment = 600 parking spaces\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Total living area: 480,000 square feet\n\n- Estimated number of residents: 1,200\n\n- Total parking spaces required: 600\n\nI think that covers all the parts of the question. If there's anything else you need or if I've missed something, let me know."
