        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a bag with only red and blue marbles, and when you pick two marbles at random without putting them back, there's a 1/3 chance that both are red. We need to find the smallest possible total number of marbles in the bag.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this clearer. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- \\(r\\) is the number of red marbles.\n\n- \\(b\\) is the number of blue marbles.\n\n- \\(t = r + b\\) is the total number of marbles.\n\nThe problem states that the probability of picking two red marbles without replacement is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nNow, the probability of picking two red marbles in succession without replacement can be calculated using combinations or step by step.\n\nUsing combinations, the probability is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{two red}) = \\frac{\\binom{r}{2}}{\\binom{t}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{r(r-1)}{2}}{\\frac{t(t-1)}{2}} = \\frac{r(r-1)}{t(t-1)} \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, this equals \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{r(r-1)}{t(t-1)} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[ 3r(r-1) = t(t-1) \\]\n\nThis is one equation with two variables, which is a bit tricky. We need to find integer values for \\( r \\) and \\( t \\), since marbles can't be fractional.\n\nAlternatively, we can think step by step:\n\n- The probability that the first marble is red is \\( \\frac{r}{t} \\).\n\n- Given that the first marble is red, the probability that the second marble is also red is \\( \\frac{r-1}{t-1} \\).\n\n- Therefore, the combined probability is \\( \\frac{r}{t} \\times \\frac{r-1}{t-1} = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nThis brings us back to the same equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{r(r-1)}{t(t-1)} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nSo, \\( 3r(r-1) = t(t-1) \\).\n\nNow, since \\( t = r + b \\), and \\( b \\) is at least 1 (because the bag has only red and blue marbles), \\( t > r \\).\n\nWe need to find the smallest \\( t \\) such that there exists an integer \\( r < t \\) satisfying the equation above.\n\nLet's try to express \\( t \\) in terms of \\( r \\), or vice versa, to find possible values.\n\nFrom \\( 3r(r-1) = t(t-1) \\), we can see that \\( t(t-1) \\) must be a multiple of 3, since \\( r(r-1) \\) is an integer.\n\nAlso, \\( r(r-1) \\) is the product of two consecutive integers, so it's always even, meaning the left side \\( 3r(r-1) \\) is a multiple of 6.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider this as a Diophantine equation and look for integer solutions.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[ t^2 - t - 3r^2 + 3r = 0 \\]\n\nThis looks a bit messy. Maybe instead, I can solve for \\( t \\) in terms of \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ t^2 - t - 3r(r-1) = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic in \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 12r(r-1)}}{2} \\]\n\nFor \\( t \\) to be an integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square:\n\n\\[ 1 + 12r(r-1) = k^2 \\]\n\nFor some integer \\( k \\).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[ k^2 = 1 + 12r(r-1) \\]\n\nThis is a form of a Diophantine equation. To find integer solutions, we can try small integer values for \\( r \\) and see if \\( k^2 \\) turns out to be a perfect square.\n\nLet's try \\( r = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ k^2 = 1 + 12(1)(0) = 1 \\]\n\nWhich gives \\( k = 1 \\), which is a perfect square.\n\nThen, \\( t = \\frac{1 \\pm 1}{2} \\), which gives \\( t = 1 \\) or \\( t = 0 \\).\n\nBut if \\( t = 1 \\), and \\( r = 1 \\), then \\( b = 0 \\), which contradicts the problem statement that there are only red and blue marbles, implying \\( b \\geq 1 \\).\n\nSo, \\( r = 1 \\) doesn't work.\n\nNext, try \\( r = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ k^2 = 1 + 12(2)(1) = 1 + 24 = 25 \\]\n\n\\( k = 5 \\), which is a perfect square.\n\nThen, \\( t = \\frac{1 \\pm 5}{2} \\), which gives \\( t = 3 \\) or \\( t = -2 \\).\n\nSince \\( t \\) must be positive, \\( t = 3 \\).\n\nThen, \\( b = t - r = 3 - 2 = 1 \\).\n\nLet's check if this satisfies the original probability condition.\n\nProbability of picking two red marbles:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{\\binom{2}{2}}{\\binom{3}{2}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nWhich matches the given probability.\n\nSo, with \\( t = 3 \\), \\( r = 2 \\), and \\( b = 1 \\), the condition is satisfied.\n\nBut the problem asks for the smallest possible total number of marbles, so we should check if there are smaller \\( t \\) than 3 that satisfy the condition.\n\nWe already checked \\( r = 1 \\), which gave \\( t = 3 \\), but that didn't work because \\( b = 0 \\), which isn't allowed.\n\nWait, no. With \\( r = 2 \\), \\( t = 3 \\), and \\( b = 1 \\), it is valid.\n\nIs there a way to have \\( t < 3 \\)?\n\nIf \\( t = 2 \\), then possible \\( r = 1 \\) or \\( r = 2 \\).\n\nIf \\( r = 1 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), then probability of picking two red marbles is:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{\\binom{1}{2}}{\\binom{2}{2}} = \\frac{0}{1} = 0 \\]\n\nWhich is not \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nIf \\( r = 2 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), which isn't allowed.\n\nSo, \\( t = 3 \\) with \\( r = 2 \\), \\( b = 1 \\) is the smallest possible total number of marbles that satisfies the condition.\n\nBut let's check \\( r = 3 \\) to see if there's a smaller \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ k^2 = 1 + 12(3)(2) = 1 + 72 = 73 \\]\n\n73 is not a perfect square.\n\nNext, \\( r = 4 \\):\n\n\\[ k^2 = 1 + 12(4)(3) = 1 + 144 = 145 \\]\n\n145 is not a perfect square.\n\n\\( r = 5 \\):\n\n\\[ k^2 = 1 + 12(5)(4) = 1 + 240 = 241 \\]\n\n241 is not a perfect square.\n\n\\( r = 6 \\):\n\n\\[ k^2 = 1 + 12(6)(5) = 1 + 360 = 361 \\]\n\n361 is \\( 19^2 \\), so \\( k = 19 \\).\n\nThen, \\( t = \\frac{1 \\pm 19}{2} \\), which gives \\( t = 10 \\) or \\( t = -9 \\).\n\nSo, \\( t = 10 \\), and \\( b = 10 - 6 = 4 \\).\n\nCheck the probability:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{\\binom{6}{2}}{\\binom{10}{2}} = \\frac{15}{45} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nWhich again satisfies the condition.\n\nBut since we are looking for the smallest possible total number of marbles, \\( t = 3 \\) is smaller than \\( t = 10 \\).\n\nSo, \\( t = 3 \\) is smaller.\n\nBut let's check if there are any other smaller solutions.\n\nWe already checked \\( t = 2 \\), which didn't work.\n\nIs there a way to have \\( t = 1 \\)?\n\nIf \\( t = 1 \\), then \\( r \\) must be 1 (since \\( r \\) can't be 0, or there would be no red marbles), but then \\( b = 0 \\), which isn't allowed.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible total number of marbles is 3.\n\nWait a minute, but let's think differently. Maybe there are larger \\( r \\) that give smaller \\( t \\), but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical constraint I'm missing.\n\nWait, another approach: since \\( t(t-1) = 3r(r-1) \\), and \\( t > r \\) (because \\( b \\geq 1 \\)), we can look for pairs \\( (r, t) \\) that satisfy this.\n\nSo, \\( t^2 - t - 3r^2 + 3r = 0 \\).\n\nThis is a quadratic in \\( t \\), as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider this as a Pell equation or something similar.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nGiven that \\( t(t-1) = 3r(r-1) \\), we can look for integer solutions where \\( t > r \\).\n\nWe already found two solutions: \\( (r, t) = (2, 3) \\) and \\( (6, 10) \\).\n\nIs there a pattern here?\n\nLooking at the differences:\n\n- From \\( r = 2 \\) to \\( r = 6 \\), that's a multiple of 3.\n\n- From \\( t = 3 \\) to \\( t = 10 \\), that's not a clear multiple, but perhaps there's a ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps these solutions are related through a recursive formula.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, since we're looking for the smallest \\( t \\), and we've established that \\( t = 3 \\) works and is smaller than \\( t = 10 \\), and there are no smaller valid \\( t \\) below 3, we can conclude that the smallest possible total number of marbles is 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
