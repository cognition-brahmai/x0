OCD, or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, is a mental health condition characterized by unwanted intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) that a person feels driven to perform in response to those obsessions. While some people with OCD may have symptoms related to cleanliness or symmetry, the disorder can manifest in many different ways and is not solely about being neat or organized. It's important to understand that OCD causes significant distress and can interfere with a person's daily life. If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of OCD, it's crucial to seek help from a mental health professional."
