        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a box with 12 red balls, 18 blue balls, and 20 green balls. I need to find the probability of picking either a red or a blue ball at random. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what probability is. Probability is the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue ball, and the total outcomes are all the balls in the box.\n\nLet me find the total number of balls first. There are 12 red, 18 blue, and 20 green balls. So, total balls = 12 + 18 + 20. Let's add those up: 12 plus 18 is 30, plus 20 is 50. So, there are 50 balls in total.\n\nNow, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue ball. There are 12 red balls and 18 blue balls. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 12 + 18, which is 30.\n\nSo, the probability P of picking a red or blue ball is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. That is P = 30 / 50.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 10, which gives me P = 3 / 5.\n\nTo express this as a decimal, I can divide 3 by 5, which is 0.6.\n\nAlternatively, I can express it as a percentage by multiplying the decimal by 100, so 0.6 times 100 is 60%.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red or blue ball is 3/5, or 0.6, or 60%.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the concept of probability of separate events.\n\nI know that the probability of picking a red ball is 12/50, and the probability of picking a blue ball is 18/50. Since these are mutually exclusive events (you can't pick both at the same time), I can add their probabilities together to get the total probability of picking either one.\n\nSo, P(red or blue) = P(red) + P(blue) = (12/50) + (18/50) = 30/50 = 3/5, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nGood, that makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the probability of not picking a green ball, since picking red or blue is the same as not picking green.\n\nThe number of green balls is 20, so the probability of picking a green ball is 20/50 = 2/5 = 0.4 = 40%.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not picking a green ball is 1 - P(green) = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6, or 60%, which again matches my previous result.\n\nAlright, all these methods lead me to the same answer, which gives me more confidence that I'm correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there anything about the way the balls are arranged or anything like that? The problem says it's a random pick without looking, so each ball should have an equal chance of being picked. So, no, I don't think there's any other factor.\n\nAlso, I should confirm that the events are indeed mutually exclusive. Can I pick both a red and a blue ball at the same time? Well, I'm picking only one ball, so no, it's only one color at a time. So, yes, mutually exclusive.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since A and B are mutually exclusive, P(A and B) is zero, so it reduces to P(A) + P(B), which is what I did.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a red or blue ball is 3/5, or 0.6, or 60%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{5}} \\]"
