        "content": "So I've got this problem here about forming a committee with some specific conditions. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it.\n\nWe have a group of 9 men and 4 women, and we need to form a committee of 5 people. The catch is that at least one woman must be included in the committee. Okay, so I need to figure out how many ways this can be done.\n\nFirst, I know that this is a combination problem because the order in which we select the people doesn't matter. It's about choosing a group of people, not arranging them in a specific order.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 5 people from 13 (9 men + 4 women) without any restrictions would be the combination of 13 choose 5. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, total unrestricted ways would be C(13, 5).\n\nBut, there's a condition that at least one woman must be included. That means we need to exclude the cases where no women are chosen, i.e., all 5 members are men.\n\nSo, the number of ways to form the committee with at least one woman would be the total number of ways to choose any 5 people minus the number of ways to choose 5 men with no women.\n\nIn other words:\n\nNumber of ways = C(13, 5) - C(9, 5)\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, C(13, 5) = 13! / (5! * (13 - 5)!) = (13!)/(5! * 8!) =\n\n(13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9)/(5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (154,440)/(120) = 1,287\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recalculate.\n\nActually, 13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 = 154,440\n\nAnd 5! = 120\n\nSo, 154,440 / 120 = 1,287. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNow, C(9, 5) = 9! / (5! * (9 - 5)!) = (9!)/(5! * 4!) =\n\n(9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5)/(5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (15,120)/(120) = 126\n\nWait, again, let's check:\n\n9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 = 15,120\n\n5! = 120\n\n15,120 / 120 = 126. Correct.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 5 people with at least one woman is:\n\n1,287 - 126 = 1,161\n\nBut, I should double-check if there are other ways to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of ways to choose committees with exactly one woman, exactly two women, and so on, up to four women, since there are only 4 women.\n\nSo, that would be:\n\nC(4,1) * C(9,4) + C(4,2) * C(9,3) + C(4,3) * C(9,2) + C(4,4) * C(9,1)\n\nLet's calculate each term.\n\nFirst, C(4,1) = 4\n\nC(9,4) = 126 (as calculated earlier)\n\nSo, 4 * 126 = 504\n\nNext, C(4,2) = 6\n\nC(9,3) = 84\n\nSo, 6 * 84 = 504\n\nThen, C(4,3) = 4\n\nC(9,2) = 36\n\nSo, 4 * 36 = 144\n\nFinally, C(4,4) = 1\n\nC(9,1) = 9\n\nSo, 1 * 9 = 9\n\nNow, add them all up: 504 + 504 + 144 + 9 = 1,157\n\nWait a minute, earlier I got 1,161, but now I'm getting 1,157. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in one of the calculations.\n\nLet me recheck C(9,4). Earlier, I thought C(9,4) is 126, but let's confirm:\n\nC(9,4) = 126, that's correct.\n\nC(4,1) * C(9,4) = 4 * 126 = 504 - correct.\n\nC(4,2) = 6, C(9,3) = 84, 6 * 84 = 504 - correct.\n\nC(4,3) = 4, C(9,2) = 36, 4 * 36 = 144 - correct.\n\nC(4,4) = 1, C(9,1) = 9, 1 * 9 = 9 - correct.\n\nAdding them up: 504 + 504 = 1,008; 1,008 + 144 = 1,152; 1,152 + 9 = 1,161.\n\nWait, now I'm getting 1,161 again. Earlier, I thought I got 1,157, but it was a miscalculation. It's indeed 1,161.\n\nSo, both methods give me 1,161.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to form the committee with at least one woman is 1,161.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of the inclusion-exclusion principle, but in this case, it's straightforward since the only restriction is that there must be at least one woman.\n\nSo, the total number of unrestricted committees is C(13,5) = 1,287.\n\nThe number of committees with no women (all men) is C(9,5) = 126.\n\nTherefore, committees with at least one woman are 1,287 - 126 = 1,161.\n\nThis matches the result I got from the alternative method.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1,161.\n\nBut, just to be absolutely sure, let me check if there's any other constraint or if I've miscounted anything.\n\nIs there any overlapping or double-counting in the alternative method?\n\nIn the alternative method, I considered committees with exactly one woman, exactly two women, and so on, up to four women.\n\nSince these are mutually exclusive cases, there's no overlapping.\n\nTherefore, the sum should be correct.\n\nHence, the final answer is 1,161.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1161} \\]"
