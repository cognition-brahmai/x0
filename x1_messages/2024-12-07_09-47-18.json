It provides a list of potentially relevant websites but does not directly provide answers.\nURLLoader[input]: Loads one or multiple websites from an input string consisting of newline-separated URLs.

Input must be a question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [initial action based on input query]\n:evidence0: = [function call with input parameters]\nPlan: [subsequent action based on :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function call with input parameters, possibly referencing earlier evidence]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: - contains the ultimate answer]\n\nQuestion: Who was the architect behind the Sydney Opera House and what other notable buildings did they design?"
