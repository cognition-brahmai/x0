        "content": "Implementing Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in C++ involves several steps. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights. Here\u2019s how you can implement it using an adjacency matrix:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of vertices, edges, and their weights to construct the adjacency matrix.\n2. **Initialization**: Set the distance to the source vertex as 0 and to all other vertices as infinity.\n3. **Priority Queue**: Use a priority queue to always pick the vertex with the smallest distance.\n4. **Relaxation**: For each adjacent vertex, check if the distance can be reduced and update it if possible.\n5. **Output**: Print the shortest distances from the source to all vertices.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <limits.h>\n#include <queue>\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function to find the vertex with the minimum distance value, from the set of vertices not yet included in shortest path tree\nint minDistance(int dist[], bool sptSet[], int V) {\n    int min = INT_MAX, min_index;\n\n    for (int v = 0; v < V; v++)\n        if (sptSet[v] == false && dist[v] <= min)\n            min = dist[v], min_index = v;\n\n    return min_index;\n}\n\n// Function to print the constructed distance array\nvoid printSolution(int dist[], int n) {\n    cout << \"Vertex \\t Distance from Source\\n\";\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n        cout << i << \" \\t\\t\" << dist[i] << \"\\n\";\n}\n\n// Function that implements Dijkstra's single source shortest path algorithm for a graph represented using adjacency matrix representation\nvoid dijkstra(int graph[100][100], int src, int V) {\n    int dist[V]; // The output array. dist[i] will hold the shortest distance from src to i\n\n    bool sptSet[V]; // sptSet[i] will be true if vertex i is included in shortest path tree or shortest distance from src to i is finalized\n\n    // Initialize all distances as INFINITE and stpSet[] as false\n    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)\n        dist[i] = INT_MAX, sptSet[i] = false;\n\n    // Distance of source vertex from itself is always 0\n    dist[src] = 0;\n\n    // Find shortest path for all vertices\n    for (int count = 0; count < V - 1; count++) {\n        // Pick the minimum distance vertex from the set of vertices not yet processed\n        int u = minDistance(dist, sptSet, V);\n\n        // Mark the picked vertex as processed\n        sptSet[u] = true;\n\n        // Update dist value of the adjacent vertices of the picked vertex\n        for (int v = 0; v < V; v++)\n\n            // Update dist[v] only if is not in sptSet, there is an edge from u to v, and total weight of path from src to v through u is smaller than current value of dist[v]\n            if (!sptSet[v] && graph[u][v] && dist[u] != INT_MAX && dist[u] + graph[u][v] < dist[v])\n                dist[v] = dist[u] + graph[u][v];\n    }\n\n    // print the constructed distance array\n    printSolution(dist, V);\n}\n\n// Driver code\nint main() {\n    int V, E;\n    cout << \"Enter number of vertices: \";\n    cin >> V;\n    cout << \"Enter number of edges: \";\n    cin >> E;\n\n    int graph[100][100];\n    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < V; j++) {\n            graph[i][j] = 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    cout << \"Enter edges and weights:\\n\";\n    for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {\n        int u, v, w;\n        cin >> u >> v >> w;\n        graph[u][v] = w;\n        // For undirected graph\n        graph[v][u] = w;\n    }\n\n    int src;\n    cout << \"Enter source vertex: \";\n    cin >> src;\n\n    dijkstra(graph, src, V);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Input Handling**:\n   - Read the number of vertices (`V`) and edges (`E`).\n   - Read each edge and its weight to fill the adjacency matrix.\n\n2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:\n   - Initialize distances to all vertices as infinite except the source vertex, which is set to 0.\n   - Use a loop to relax edges, updating the distances to vertices if a shorter path is found.\n   - Track vertices that have been processed using the `sptSet` array.\n\n3. **Output**:\n   - Print the shortest distances from the source vertex to all other vertices.\n\nThis implementation ensures that you get the shortest paths efficiently using an adjacency matrix representation."
