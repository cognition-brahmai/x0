        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the car is traveling in two different phases with different speeds and durations. First, it goes at 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, and then it speeds up to 80 miles per hour for another 4 hours. To find the total distance traveled, I need to calculate the distance for each phase separately and then add them together.\n\nOkay, for the first phase:\n\nSpeed = 60 miles per hour\n\nTime = 3 hours\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 3 hours = 180 miles\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nNow, for the second phase:\n\nSpeed = 80 miles per hour\n\nTime = 4 hours\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 80 miles/hour \u00d7 4 hours = 320 miles\n\nAlright, now I just need to add both distances to get the total distance traveled.\n\nTotal distance = Distance in first phase + Distance in second phase = 180 miles + 320 miles = 500 miles\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider, like acceleration or rest stops? The problem doesn't mention anything about that, so I think assuming constant speeds for the given times is fine.\n\nJust to double-check, let's see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the formula for average speed or something like that.\n\nAverage speed is total distance divided by total time, but I don't know the total distance yet; that's what I'm trying to find. So, maybe that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the entire journey as two segments and add them up, which is what I already did.\n\nLet me see, total time is 3 hours + 4 hours = 7 hours.\n\nIf I were to calculate the average speed for the entire journey, it would be total distance divided by total time, but again, I don't know the total distance yet.\n\nI think the way I did it initially is correct. Calculating each segment's distance and then summing them up.\n\nSo, first segment: 60 mph for 3 hours = 180 miles\n\nSecond segment: 80 mph for 4 hours = 320 miles\n\nTotal distance: 180 + 320 = 500 miles\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to check, I could see if the average speed over the entire journey makes sense.\n\nTotal distance is 500 miles, total time is 7 hours, so average speed would be 500 miles / 7 hours \u2248 71.43 mph\n\nThat makes sense because the car spent less time at the lower speed (60 mph for 3 hours) and more time at the higher speed (80 mph for 4 hours), so the average should be closer to 80 than to 60, which 71.43 is.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the weighteds average of the speeds.\n\nThe car was at 60 mph for 3 hours and at 80 mph for 4 hours.\n\nSo, the weighted average speed would be (60 mph \u00d7 3 hours + 80 mph \u00d7 4 hours) / total time\n\nWhich is (180 + 320) / 7 = 500 / 7 \u2248 71.43 mph\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nTherefore, the total distance traveled by the car is 500 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500} \\]"
