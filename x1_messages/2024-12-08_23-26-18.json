Below is a Python script that implements the merge sort algorithm to sort a list of strings alphabetically.\n\n```python\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) > 1:\n        # Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves\n        mid = len(arr) // 2\n        left_half = arr[:mid]\n        right_half = arr[mid:]\n\n        # Recursively sort both halves\n        merge_sort(left_half)\n        merge_sort(right_half)\n\n        # Merge the sorted halves\n        i = j = k = 0\n        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):\n            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:\n                arr[k] = left_half[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                arr[k] = right_half[j]\n                j += 1\n            k += 1\n\n        # Check if any element was left in the left half\n        while i < len(left_half):\n            arr[k] = left_half[i]\n            i += 1\n            k += 1\n\n        # Check if any element was left in the right half\n        while j < len(right_half):\n            arr[k] = right_half[j]\n            j += 1\n            k += 1\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    sample_list = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\", \"grapes\", \"mango\"]\n    print(\"Original list:\", sample_list)\n    merge_sort(sample_list)\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sample_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Divide**: The `merge_sort` function splits the input list into two halves until each sublist has only one element.\n2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort each half.\n3. **Combine**: Merge the sorted halves back together in the correct order.\n\nThe `merge_sort` function is called recursively on the two halves of the list, and then the `merge` step combines these halves in sorted order. This process continues until the entire list is sorted.\n\nIn the example usage, a sample list of strings is provided, and the script prints both the original and the sorted lists.\n"
