        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a train traveling at different speeds for different amounts of time, and I need to find out the total distance it travels. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, the train travels at an average speed of 90 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. I know that distance is equal to speed multiplied by time, so for this part, the distance should be 90 km/h times 5 hours. Let me calculate that:\n\n90 km/h * 5 h = 450 kilometers.\n\nOkay, so the train travels 450 kilometers during the first part of its journey.\n\nThen, it decreases its speed to 60 kilometers per hour for another 3 hours. Again, using the formula distance equals speed times time, the distance for this part should be 60 km/h times 3 hours.\n\n60 km/h * 3 h = 180 kilometers.\n\nSo, in the second part, the train travels 180 kilometers.\n\nNow, to find the total distance traveled, I just need to add these two distances together:\n\n450 kilometers + 180 kilometers = 630 kilometers.\n\nTherefore, the train travels a total of 630 kilometers.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the average speed for the entire journey or something like that. Let me think about it.\n\nThe total time of the journey is 5 hours plus 3 hours, which is 8 hours. If I could find the average speed over the entire journey, then multiply it by the total time, that should also give me the total distance.\n\nLet's see, the average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. But in this case, I don't know the total distance yet, which is what I'm trying to find. So maybe that's not the best approach here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I could use the concept of weighted averages for the speeds, weighted by the time spent at each speed.\n\nThe formula for average speed when times are known is:\n\nAverage speed = (total distance) / (total time)\n\nBut again, that seems circular because I don't have the total distance yet.\n\nMaybe I should stick with the initial approach of calculating each part separately and adding them up. That seems straightforward and logical.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst part: 90 km/h * 5 h = 450 km\n\nSecond part: 60 km/h * 3 h = 180 km\n\nTotal distance: 450 km + 180 km = 630 km\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to, I could verify by calculating the average speed over the entire journey.\n\nTotal distance is 630 km, total time is 8 hours, so average speed would be 630 km / 8 h = 78.75 km/h.\n\nNow, if I look at the individual speeds and times, I can see that spending more time at the higher speed of 90 km/h would pull the average speed higher, which makes sense because the train was going faster for a longer period.\n\nBut again, this is just another way of looking at it, and it confirms the total distance I calculated earlier.\n\nI think that's sufficient. The train travels a total of 630 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{630} \\]"
