        "content": "The celestial body you're referring to is the Moon. It is Earth's only natural satellite and plays a significant role in causing tides on our planet due to its gravitational pull. The Moon's gravity affects the Earth's oceans, causing them to bulge out in the direction of the Moon and on the opposite side, leading to high tides. The areas in between experience lower tides, known as neap tides. This cycle repeats approximately every 12 hours and 25 minutes, corresponding to the time it takes for the Earth to rotate once relative to the Moon's position."
