You're looking for a term that refers to a religious leader who performs sacred functions, and it's an anagram of \"stripe.\" So, I need to rearrange the letters in \"stripe\" to form this word.\n\nFirst, let's list out the letters in \"stripe\": S, T, R, I, P, E.\n\nNow, thinking about religious leaders who perform sacred functions, there are many titles like priest, pastor, imam, rabbi, etc. Hmm, \"priest\" seems relevant, but \"priest\" isn't an anagram of \"stripe\" because \"stripe\" has seven letters and \"priest\" has six.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let's check: S-T-R-I-P-E, that's six letters. Priest is also six letters: P-R-I-E-S-T. So perhaps it is an anagram.\n\nLet's see if I can rearrange the letters in \"stripe\" to form \"priest.\"\n\nS-T-R-I-P-E to P-R-I-E-S-T.\n\nLooking at the letters:\n\n- S and T are in both words.\n\n- R, I, E are common.\n\n- P is in both.\n\nSo, rearranging:\n\nS-T-R-I-P-E can be rearranged to P-R-I-E-S-T.\n\nYes, that works!\n\nSo, the answer is \"priest.\"\n\nBut wait, you said it's a religious leader who performs sacred functions, and an anagram of \"stripe.\" Priest fits that description perfectly.\n\nIs there anything else I should consider? Maybe another term that fits both criteria.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another word that's an anagram of \"stripe\" related to religion.\n\nLet's see other possible anagrams of \"stripe.\"\n\nStripping that out, I can think of:\n\n- Spite\n\n-Peters\n\n-Perist\n\n-Repits\n\nNone of these seem to relate to religious leaders.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps adding or removing a letter, but since you specified it's an anagram of \"stripe,\" which has six letters, the word should also have six letters.\n\nTherefore, \"priest\" seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\nSo, the religious leader who performs sacred functions and is an anagram of \"stripe\" is a priest.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{priest}} \\]"
