        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students playing soccer and basketball. Let's see what it's asking. There are 100 students who play soccer, 75 who play basketball, and 50 who play both sports. I need to find out how many students play either soccer or basketball, but not both.\n\nOkay, first things first, I think I should recall some set theory here because this sounds like a classic problem involving unions and intersections of sets.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let S be the set of students who play soccer.\n\n- Let B be the set of students who play basketball.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- The number of students who play soccer, which is the cardinality of set S, is |S| = 100.\n\n- The number of students who play basketball, |B| = 75.\n\n- The number of students who play both soccer and basketball, which is the intersection of S and B, |S \u2229 B| = 50.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of students who play either soccer or basketball, but not both. That means I need to find the symmetric difference of S and B, which is denoted by S \u0394 B, and its cardinality |S \u0394 B|.\n\nThe symmetric difference is defined as the set of elements which are in either of the sets S or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nMathematically, S \u0394 B = (S \u222a B) - (S \u2229 B), or equivalently, S \u0394 B = (S - B) \u222a (B - S).\n\nSo, the number of students who play either soccer or basketball, but not both, is |S \u0394 B| = |S| + |B| - 2|S \u2229 B|.\n\nLet me plug in the values:\n\n|S \u0394 B| = 100 + 75 - 2*50 = 175 - 100 = 75.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to approach this to confirm?\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\n- Students who play only soccer: |S - B| = |S| - |S \u2229 B| = 100 - 50 = 50.\n\n- Students who play only basketball: |B - S| = |B| - |S \u2229 B| = 75 - 50 = 25.\n\nThen, the total number of students who play either soccer or basketball, but not both, would be the sum of these two: 50 + 25 = 75.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. Good, it's consistent.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also calculate the total number of students who play either sport using the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nTotal playing either sport = |S \u222a B| = |S| + |B| - |S \u2229 B| = 100 + 75 - 50 = 125.\n\nNow, out of these 125 students, 50 play both sports. So, the number who play only one sport would be 125 - 50 = 75, which again matches my previous results.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who play either soccer or basketball, but not both, is 75.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
