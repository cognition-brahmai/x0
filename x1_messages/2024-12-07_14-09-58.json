Each step in your plan should correspond to an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the functions given an input string that can either be the user's query, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools you can use:\nBing[input]: This tool allows users to search for information using Bing. It is useful for finding a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nTextScraper[input]: This function extracts text from one or more websites provided as newline-separated links in the input string.\nLinkCollector[input]: This tool extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text response with newline-separated links.\nKnowledgeBase[input]: A question answering model capable of providing answers based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., What color is the dog, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe input to each function should be a plain string without quotes or \"+\" for concatenating a string with an evidence variable, e.g., KnowledgeBase[What is the capital of France, given :evidence2:?]\n\nRemember to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output format should be:\nPlan: [first action based on the input question]\n:evidence0: = [function call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on the result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function call and input parameter, possibly referring to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2019 and what is their most famous work?"
