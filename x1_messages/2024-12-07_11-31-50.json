        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 units of product A every hour. And it takes 3 hours to produce enough to fill one truck. So first, I need to find out how many units are needed to fill one truck.\n\nIf it takes 3 hours to fill a truck, and the factory produces 500 units per hour, then the number of units per truck is:\n\n500 units/hour * 3 hours = 1500 units per truck.\n\nNow, if the factory operates for 24 hours, the total production would be:\n\n500 units/hour * 24 hours = 12,000 units.\n\nTo find out how many trucks can be filled, I need to divide the total production by the number of units per truck:\n\n12,000 units / 1500 units/truck = 8 trucks.\n\nSo, the factory can fill 8 trucks with product A in 24 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
