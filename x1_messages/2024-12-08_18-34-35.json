        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 30 people in a group, out of which 18 have brown eyes and 12 have blue eyes. I need to find the probability that if I randomly select two people from this group, both of them have blue eyes.\n\nOkay, first things first, I know that probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcome is selecting two people with blue eyes, and the total outcomes are all possible ways to select any two people from the group.\n\nLet me think about how to find the total number of ways to select two people from 30. I think this is a combination problem because the order in which I select the people doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose. So, for the total number of ways to choose two people from 30, it would be:\n\n\\[\nC(30, 2) = \\frac{30!}{2!(30 - 2)!} = \\frac{30!}{2! \\cdot 28!}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the 28! in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(30, 2) = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 28!} = \\frac{30 \\times 29}{2} = 15 \\times 29 = 435\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 435 possible ways to choose any two people from the group.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to choose two people with blue eyes. There are 12 people with blue eyes. So, the number of ways to choose two blue-eyed people is:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12!}{2!(12 - 2)!} = \\frac{12!}{2! \\cdot 10!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 10!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} = 6 \\times 11 = 66\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 66 favorable ways to choose two blue-eyed people.\n\nNow, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both have blue eyes}) = \\frac{66}{435}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{66 \\div 3}{435 \\div 3} = \\frac{22}{145}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability is \\( \\frac{22}{145} \\).\n\nWait a minute, I should check if this is the lowest terms. Let's see, 22 and 145. 22 is 2 times 11, and 145 is 5 times 29. No common factors, so yes, it's in the lowest terms.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this step by step, considering the probability of selecting one blue-eyed person and then another. The probability of selecting the first blue-eyed person is 12 out of 30, and then, given that the first was blue-eyed, the probability of selecting another blue-eyed person is 11 out of 29.\n\nSo, the probability would be:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{first blue}) \\times P(\\text{second blue} | \\text{first blue}) = \\frac{12}{30} \\times \\frac{11}{29} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{30 \\times 29} = \\frac{132}{870}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 6:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{132 \\div 6}{870 \\div 6} = \\frac{22}{145}\n\\]\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier using combinations. So, that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both selected people have blue eyes is \\( \\frac{22}{145} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{22}{145}} \\]"
