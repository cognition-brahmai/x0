        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces three types of products: X, Y, and Z. The production ratio given is 4 units of X to 6 units of Y to 10 units of Z. And the total production per day is 200 units. We need to find out how many units of each product are produced daily.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio tells us the relative quantities of something. In this case, for every 4 units of X, there are 6 units of Y and 10 units of Z. So, the quantities are proportional to 4:6:10.\n\nTo make it easier, I can think of the ratio as parts. Let's say each part corresponds to a certain number of units. So, for product X, it's 4 parts, for Y it's 6 parts, and for Z it's 10 parts.\n\nNow, I need to find out what one part is equal to, and then I can calculate the units for each product.\n\nFirst, let's add up all the parts:\n\n4 (for X) + 6 (for Y) + 10 (for Z) = 20 parts in total.\n\nThe total production is 200 units per day, and this corresponds to 20 parts.\n\nSo, to find the value of one part, I can divide the total units by the total parts:\n\n1 part = 200 units / 20 parts = 10 units per part.\n\nNow that I know one part is 10 units, I can find the units for each product:\n\n- Product X: 4 parts \u00d7 10 units/part = 40 units\n\n- Product Y: 6 parts \u00d7 10 units/part = 60 units\n\n- Product Z: 10 parts \u00d7 10 units/part = 100 units\n\nLet me check if this adds up to the total production:\n\n40 (X) + 60 (Y) + 100 (Z) = 200 units. Yes, it matches.\n\nAlso, let's verify the ratios:\n\n- X:Y = 40:60 = 4:6\n\n- Y:Z = 60:100 = 6:10\n\n- X:Z = 40:100 = 4:10\n\nThese ratios match the given production ratio of 4:6:10.\n\nSo, the factory produces 40 units of product X, 60 units of product Y, and 100 units of product Z daily.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40 \\text{ units of X}, 60 \\text{ units of Y}, 100 \\text{ units of Z}} \\]"
