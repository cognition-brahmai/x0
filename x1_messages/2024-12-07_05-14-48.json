        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. First, there's an item that originally costs $250, and there's a discount of 20% on it. So, I need to find out how much the discount is and then subtract that from the original price to get the discounted price. After that, there's a sales tax of 8% applied to the discounted price. So, I'll need to calculate the tax and add it to the discounted price to get the final price. Let's see.\n\nFirst, calculating the discount:\n\nDiscount = 20% of $250\n\nTo find 20% of $250, I can multiply 250 by 0.20.\n\n$250 \u00d7 0.20 = $50\n\nSo, the discount is $50.\n\nNow, subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price:\n\n$250 - $50 = $200\n\nNext, calculate the sales tax on the discounted price:\n\nSales tax = 8% of $200\n\nTo find 8% of $200, I can multiply 200 by 0.08.\n\n$200 \u00d7 0.08 = $16\n\nSo, the sales tax is $16.\n\nFinally, add the sales tax to the discounted price to get the final price:\n\n$200 + $16 = $216\n\nTherefore, the final price of the item after the discount and sales tax is $216.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{216} \\]\n"
