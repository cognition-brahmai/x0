        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 3 and then subtracting 1. The first term is 2, and we need to find the sum of the first five terms.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the terms one by one.\n\nThe first term, let's call it a1, is given as 2.\n\nNow, to find the second term, a2, I need to multiply a1 by 3 and then subtract 1.\n\nSo, a2 = 3 * a1 - 1 = 3 * 2 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5.\n\nNext, the third term, a3, is obtained by multiplying a2 by 3 and subtracting 1.\n\na3 = 3 * a2 - 1 = 3 * 5 - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14.\n\nSimilarly, the fourth term, a4, is:\n\na4 = 3 * a3 - 1 = 3 * 14 - 1 = 42 - 1 = 41.\n\nAnd the fifth term, a5, is:\n\na5 = 3 * a4 - 1 = 3 * 41 - 1 = 123 - 1 = 122.\n\nNow that I have all five terms: 2, 5, 14, 41, and 122, I need to find their sum.\n\nSum = a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 + a5 = 2 + 5 + 14 + 41 + 122.\n\nLet's add them up step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\nFirst, 2 + 5 = 7.\n\nThen, 7 + 14 = 21.\n\nNext, 21 + 41 = 62.\n\nFinally, 62 + 122 = 184.\n\nSo, the sum of the first five terms of the sequence is 184.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nStarting with a1 = 2.\n\na2 = 3 * 2 - 1 = 5. That seems correct.\n\na3 = 3 * 5 - 1 = 14. Correct.\n\na4 = 3 * 14 - 1 = 41. Correct.\n\na5 = 3 * 41 - 1 = 122. Correct.\n\nNow, summing them up: 2 + 5 = 7; 7 + 14 = 21; 21 + 41 = 62; 62 + 122 = 184. Everything checks out.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the first five terms is indeed 184.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{184} \\]"
