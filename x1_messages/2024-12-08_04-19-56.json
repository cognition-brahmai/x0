        "content": "Let's see here. So, we have two trains leaving from different stations at the same time and heading towards each other. Train A is leaving from Station A, which is 100 miles away from Station B, where Train B is leaving from. Train A is going at 40 mph, and Train B is going at 60 mph. I need to find out how far Train A has traveled when they pass each other.\n\nFirst, I should understand that since both trains are moving towards each other, their speeds will add up when calculating how quickly they approach each other. So, the combined speed is 40 mph + 60 mph = 100 mph. That means together, they are closing the distance between them at a rate of 100 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the initial distance between them is 100 miles. So, the time it takes for them to meet can be calculated by dividing the distance by their combined speed. Time = Distance / Speed = 100 miles / 100 mph = 1 hour.\n\nSo, they will meet after 1 hour. Now, to find out how far Train A has traveled in that time, I can multiply its speed by the time. Distance = Speed * Time = 40 mph * 1 hour = 40 miles.\n\nWait, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Another way to think about it is to consider the ratio of their speeds. Train A is going at 40 mph and Train B at 60 mph, so the ratio of their speeds is 40:60, which simplifies to 4:6 or 2:3.\n\nIf they're moving towards each other, the distance each covers will be in the ratio of their speeds. So, the total distance is 100 miles, and Train A should cover 2/5 of that distance, while Train B covers 3/5.\n\nLet's calculate that. 2/5 of 100 miles is (2/5)*100 = 40 miles. Yeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of relative speed. Since they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds, which is again 100 mph. The time to meet would be the distance divided by the relative speed, which is 100 miles / 100 mph = 1 hour. Then, distance covered by Train A is its speed multiplied by time, which is 40 mph * 1 hour = 40 miles.\n\nHmm, all these methods lead me to the same answer. I think it's safe to conclude that when the trains pass each other, Train A would have traveled 40 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
