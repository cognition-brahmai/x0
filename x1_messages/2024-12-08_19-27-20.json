        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here: a farmer has chickens and cows on his farm. There are a total of 32 heads and 84 legs. I need to figure out how many chickens the farmer has.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by understanding what's being given to me. Chickens and cows are the two types of animals on the farm. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads should be the sum of the number of chickens and the number of cows. That makes sense.\n\nSo, if I let C represent the number of chickens and K represent the number of cows, then:\n\nC + K = 32\n\nBecause there are 32 heads in total.\n\nNow, for the legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. So, the total number of legs would be:\n\n2C + 4K = 84\n\nBecause there are 84 legs in total.\n\nSo, now I have two equations:\n\n1) C + K = 32\n\n2) 2C + 4K = 84\n\nI need to solve these equations to find the value of C, which is the number of chickens.\n\nHmm, I remember that with two variables, I can use either substitution or elimination method to solve for one variable.\n\nLet me try the substitution method first.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nC = 32 - K\n\nNow, I can substitute this expression for C into equation 2:\n\n2(32 - K) + 4K = 84\n\nLet me simplify that:\n\n64 - 2K + 4K = 84\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n64 + 2K = 84\n\nNow, subtract 64 from both sides:\n\n2K = 20\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2:\n\nK = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 cows.\n\nNow, plug this back into the expression for C:\n\nC = 32 - 10 = 22\n\nTherefore, there are 22 chickens.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nIf there are 22 chickens and 10 cows:\n\nTotal heads: 22 + 10 = 32 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTotal legs: (22 * 2) + (10 * 4) = 44 + 40 = 84 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLooks correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the elimination method.\n\nLet's see.\n\nStarting with the two equations:\n\n1) C + K = 32\n\n2) 2C + 4K = 84\n\nI can multiply equation 1 by 2 to make the coefficients of C the same in both equations:\n\n2C + 2K = 64\n\nNow, subtract this from equation 2:\n\n(2C + 4K) - (2C + 2K) = 84 - 64\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2K = 20\n\nSo, K = 10\n\nThen, C = 32 - 10 = 22\n\nSame result as before.\n\nI think it's confirmed. There are 22 chickens on the farm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22} \\]"
