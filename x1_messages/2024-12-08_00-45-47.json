        "content": "Ah, you're referring to a character from one of Charles Dickens' novels. Miss Havisham is indeed a memorable figure. She has a particular affinity for a certain color, which is prominently featured in the story. The novel you're thinking of is \"Great Expectations.\" In this book, Miss Havisham is known for her obsession with the color yellow, or more specifically, her faded wedding dress that has turned yellow over time. This dress is a symbol of her enduring bitterness and resentment after being jilted at the altar many years ago. The color yellow, in this context, represents decay, stagnation, and the passage of time without her moving on from her trauma. It's a powerful imagery that Dickens uses to convey Miss Havisham's emotional state and the impact of her past on her present life."
