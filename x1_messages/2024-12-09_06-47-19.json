        "content": "Sure! Reversing the words in a sentence is a common programming task, and it's quite straightforward in JavaScript. I'll walk you through how to do it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what we need to achieve. If we have a sentence like \"Hello world\", reversing the words would make it \"world Hello\". So, the order of the words is reversed, but the words themselves remain the same.\n\nHere's a simple way to do this in JavaScript:\n\n1. **Split the sentence into words:** We can use the `split` method to break the sentence into an array of words. By default, `split` separates the string by spaces.\n\n2. **Reverse the array of words:** JavaScript arrays have a `reverse` method that reverses the order of the elements in place.\n\n3. **Join the reversed array back into a sentence:** We can use the `join` method to concatenate the words back together, separated by spaces.\n\nLet's see this in code:\n\n```javascript\nfunction reverseWords(sentence) {\n    // Split the sentence into words\n    var words = sentence.split(' ');\n    \n    // Reverse the array of words\n    var reversedWords = words.reverse();\n    \n    // Join the reversed array back into a sentence\n    var reversedSentence = reversedWords.join(' ');\n    \n    return reversedSentence;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nvar originalSentence = \"Hello world\";\nvar reversedSentence = reverseWords(originalSentence);\nconsole.log(reversedSentence);  // Output: \"world Hello\"\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `reverseWords` that takes a sentence as input and returns the sentence with its words reversed. The `split`, `reverse`, and `join` methods make this task very straightforward.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **split(' ')**:\n   - This method splits the sentence into an array of words using space as the separator.\n   - For example, \"Hello world\" becomes `[\"Hello\", \"world\"]`.\n\n2. **reverse()**:\n   - This method reverses the array in place.\n   - So, `[\"Hello\", \"world\"]` becomes `[\"world\", \"Hello\"]`.\n\n3. **join(' ')**:\n   - This method joins the elements of the array into a single string, separated by spaces.\n   - Therefore, `[\"world\", \"Hello\"]` becomes \"world Hello\".\n\nThis approach is efficient and easy to understand, making it a perfect solution for reversing words in a sentence using JavaScript."
