        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a simple banking system in Python that allows users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance through the command line. This will be a text-based interface, meaning everything will happen in the terminal.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what a banking system does in this context. Essentially, it should keep track of a balance and allow users to perform transactions like deposits and withdrawals. We also need to make sure that withdrawals don't exceed the available balance.\n\nLet's break this down into steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the Bank Account:**\n   - Start with a balance of zero.\n\n2. **Deposit Functionality:**\n   - Allow the user to add money to the balance.\n\n3. **Withdraw Functionality:**\n   - Allow the user to remove money from the balance, but only if they have sufficient funds.\n\n4. **Check Balance Functionality:**\n   - Display the current balance.\n\n5. **User Interface:**\n   - Provide a menu for the user to choose what they want to do.\n\n6. **Loop:**\n   - Continue to offer services until the user decides to exit.\n\nLet's think about how to structure this in Python. We can use functions for each operation to keep the code organized.\n\n### Initial Plan\n\n- Define a variable to hold the balance, starting at 0.\n- Create a loop that keeps running until the user chooses to exit.\n- Inside the loop, present a menu to the user:\n  - Option 1: Deposit\n  - Option 2: Withdraw\n  - Option 3: Check Balance\n  - Option 4: Exit\n- Based on the user's choice, call the corresponding function.\n\n### Functions\n\n1. **deposit(amount):**\n   - Adds the specified amount to the balance.\n   \n2. **withdraw(amount):**\n   - Subtracts the specified amount from the balance if sufficient funds are available.\n   \n3. **check_balance():**\n   - Displays the current balance.\n\n### Error Handling\n\n- Ensure that the user enters valid choices and valid amounts (e.g., positive numbers).\n- Prevent withdrawals that exceed the balance.\n\n### Let's Start Coding\n\nFirst, I'll set up the initial balance and the main loop.\n\n```python\nbalance = 0.0\n\nwhile True:\n    print(\"\\nWelcome to Simple Bank:\")\n    print(\"1. Deposit\")\n    print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n    print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n    print(\"4. Exit\")\n    \n    choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1-4): \")\n    \n    if choice == '1':\n        amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to deposit: \"))\n        balance += amount\n        print(f\"Deposited: {amount}. New balance: {balance}\")\n    elif choice == '2':\n        amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to withdraw: \"))\n        if amount > balance:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n        else:\n            balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrawn: {amount}. New balance: {balance}\")\n    elif choice == '3':\n        print(f\"Current balance: {balance}\")\n    elif choice == '4':\n        print(\"Thank you for using Simple Bank. Goodbye!\")\n        break\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please select a number between 1 and 4.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **balance:** A variable that holds the account balance, starting at 0.\n- **while True:** Creates an infinite loop that keeps the program running until the user chooses to exit.\n- **print statements:** Display the menu options.\n- **input:** captures the user's choice.\n- **if-elif-else:** Depending on the choice, performs the corresponding action.\n- **deposit:** Adds the input amount to the balance.\n- **withdraw:** Checks if the balance is sufficient; if so, subtracts the amount; otherwise, alerts the user.\n- **check_balance:** Prints the current balance.\n- **exit:** Breaks the loop, ending the program.\n\nThis is a straightforward implementation. We can make it more robust by adding error handling for non-numeric inputs and formatting the currency outputs.\n\n### Enhancements\n\n1. **Error Handling for Input:**\n   - Ensure that the user enters a number for the amount.\n   - Handle cases where the user enters non-numeric values.\n\n2. **Currency Formatting:**\n   - Display balances and amounts with currency symbols and proper formatting.\n\n3. **Multiple Accounts:**\n   - Although beyond the scope of this simple system, consider how multiple accounts could be managed.\n\n4. **Transaction History:**\n   - Keep a record of deposits and withdrawals.\n\nFor now, this basic system should serve as a good starting point. Let me know if you'd like to add any specific features or if you have any questions about the code!\n\n### Final Solution\n\nTo create a simple banking system in Python that allows users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance through the command line, follow these steps:\n\n#### Approach\n\n1. **Initialize the Bank Account:**\n   - Start with a balance of zero.\n\n2. **Deposit Functionality:**\n   - Allow the user to add money to the balance.\n\n3. **Withdraw Functionality:**\n   - Allow the user to remove money from the balance, but only if they have sufficient funds.\n\n4. **Check Balance Functionality:**\n   - Display the current balance.\n\n5. **User Interface:**\n   - Provide a menu for the user to choose what they want to do.\n\n6. **Loop:**\n   - Continue to offer services until the user decides to exit.\n\n#### Solution Code\n\n```python\nbalance = 0.0\n\nwhile True:\n    print(\"\\nWelcome to Simple Bank:\")\n    print(\"1. Deposit\")\n    print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n    print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n    print(\"4. Exit\")\n    \n    choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1-4): \")\n    \n    if choice == '1':\n        amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to deposit: \"))\n        balance += amount\n        print(f\"Deposited: {amount}. New balance: {balance}\")\n    elif choice == '2':\n        amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to withdraw: \"))\n        if amount > balance:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n        else:\n            balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrawn: {amount}. New balance: {balance}\")\n    elif choice == '3':\n        print(f\"Current balance: {balance}\")\n    elif choice == '4':\n        print(\"Thank you for using Simple Bank. Goodbye!\")\n        break\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please select a number between 1 and 4.\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n- **balance:** A variable that holds the account balance, starting at 0.\n- **while True:** Creates an infinite loop that keeps the program running until the user chooses to exit.\n- **print statements:** Display the menu options.\n- **input:** captures the user's choice.\n- **if-elif-else:** Depending on the choice, performs the corresponding action.\n- **deposit:** Adds the input amount to the balance.\n- **withdraw:** Checks if the balance is sufficient; if so, subtracts the amount; otherwise, alerts the user.\n- **check_balance:** Prints the current balance.\n- **exit:** Breaks the loop, ending the program.\n\nThis simple banking system can be enhanced further by adding error handling for non-numeric inputs and formatting the currency outputs."
