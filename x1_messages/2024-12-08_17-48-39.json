Each tool should be used at least once and each plan must have an associated evidence value.\n\nHere are the available tools:\n\nBing[input]: This tool allows you to search for information on Bing. It's useful for finding websites that may contain answers to your question.\nWebCrawler[input]: This tool extracts text from one or more web pages provided in the input string (newline separated links). The output is plain text content of these pages.\nLinkPicker[input]: Extracts URLs from plain text and outputs them as newline-separated strings.\nInfoGatherer[input]: A question answering tool that can provide answers based on general knowledge or given context. The input should be a question which might reference previous evidence variables.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nPlan: [First action]\n#E1 = [Function call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action based on #E1]\n#E2 = [Next function call with input parameters possibly referencing #E1]\n...\nFinal Answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: Who is the author of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and what other works have they published?"

        "content": "Alright, I need to find out who wrote \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and what other books they've written. I think I can use the tools provided to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll use Bing to search for information about \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" because that should tell me who the author is. So, I'll input the book title into Bing.\n\nPlan: Search for \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" on Bing.\n#E1 = Bing[\"To Kill a Mockingbird\"]\n\nOnce I have the search results from Bing, I need to pick relevant links that might have information about the author. I can use LinkPicker to extract the URLs from the search results.\n\nPlan: Extract URLs from the Bing search results.\n#E2 = LinkPicker[#E1]\n\nNow, with these URLs, I should crawl the web pages to get the actual text content. WebCrawler can help me with that. I'll input the URLs extracted by LinkPicker.\n\nPlan: Extract text from the selected web pages.\n#E3 = WebCrawler[#E2]\n\nAfter getting the text content from these web pages, I need to find out who the author is. Probably, it's mentioned on the first few pages. Once I have the author's name, I can then search for other works by the same author.\n\nSo, I'll look through #E3 to find the author's name. Let's assume I find that the author is Harper Lee.\n\nThen, I can use InfoGatherer to ask about other works by Harper Lee.\n\nPlan: Ask about other works by Harper Lee.\n#E4 = InfoGatherer[\"What other books did Harper Lee write?\"]\n\nAlternatively, I could use Bing again to search for \"Harper Lee other books\" to find more information.\n\nPlan: Search for \"Harper Lee other books\" on Bing.\n#E5 = Bing[\"Harper Lee other books\"]\n\nThen, I can extract the URLs from this new set of search results using LinkPicker.\n\nPlan: Extract URLs from the new Bing search results.\n#E6 = LinkPicker[#E5]\n\nNext, crawl these web pages to get the text content.\n\nPlan: Extract text from the new set of web pages.\n#E7 = WebCrawler[#E6]\n\nFinally, compile the information from #E3 and #E7 to provide a complete answer to the user's question.\n\nFinal Answer: Combine information from #E3 and #E7 to list the author and their other works.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe I can optimize it.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\n1. Use Bing to search for \"To Kill a Mockingbird author other works\".\n\nPlan: Search for \"To Kill a Mockingbird author other works\" on Bing.\n#E1 = Bing[\"To Kill a Mockingbird author other works\"]\n\n2. Extract URLs from the search results.\n\nPlan: Extract URLs from the search results.\n#E2 = LinkPicker[#E1]\n\n3. Crawl the web pages to get text content.\n\nPlan: Extract text from the web pages.\n#E3 = WebCrawler[#E2]\n\n4. Use InfoGatherer to parse the text and find the author's name and other works.\n\nPlan: Ask InfoGatherer to identify the author and their other works from the text.\n#E4 = InfoGatherer[\"Who is the author of To Kill a Mockingbird and what are their other works, based on the following text: \" + #E3]\n\n5. Final Answer: #E4\n\nThis seems more efficient. By searching for both the author and other works in one go, I can potentially get all the information I need in fewer steps.\n\nBut to ensure accuracy, maybe I should confirm the author first and then find other works.\n\nAnother plan:\n\n1. Use Bing to search for \"To Kill a Mockingbird author\".\n\nPlan: Search for \"To Kill a Mockingbird author\" on Bing.\n#E1 = Bing[\"To Kill a Mockingbird author\"]\n\n2. Extract URLs from the search results.\n\nPlan: Extract URLs from the search results.\n#E2 = LinkPicker[#E1]\n\n3. Crawl the web pages to get text content.\n\nPlan: Extract text from the web pages.\n#E3 = WebCrawler[#E2]\n\n4. Use InfoGatherer to identify the author's name.\n\nPlan: Ask InfoGatherer to identify the author from the text.\n#E4 = InfoGatherer[\"Who is the author of To Kill a Mockingbird according to the following text: \" + #E3]\n\n5. Assume #E4 returns \"Harper Lee\".\n\n6. Then, use Bing to search for \"Harper Lee other books\".\n\nPlan: Search for \"Harper Lee other books\" on Bing.\n#E5 = Bing[\"Harper Lee other books\"]\n\n7. Extract URLs from these search results.\n\nPlan: Extract URLs from the new search results.\n#E6 = LinkPicker[#E5]\n\n8. Crawl these web pages.\n\nPlan: Extract text from these web pages.\n#E7 = WebCrawler[#E6]\n\n9. Use InfoGatherer to list other works by Harper Lee.\n\nPlan: Ask InfoGatherer to list other works by Harper Lee.\n#E8 = InfoGatherer[\"What other books did Harper Lee write, based on the following text: \" + #E7]\n\n10. Final Answer: Combine #E4 and #E8.\n\nThis seems thorough, but it involves more steps. Maybe I can combine some steps to make it more efficient.\n\nOptimized plan:\n\n1. Search for \"To Kill a Mockingbird author other works\" on Bing.\n\nPlan: Search for \"To Kill a Mockingbird author other works\" on Bing.\n#E1 = Bing[\"To Kill a Mockingbird author other works\"]\n\n2. Extract URLs from the search results.\n\nPlan: Extract URLs from the search results.\n#E2 = LinkPicker[#E1]\n\n3. Crawl the web pages to get text content.\n\nPlan: Extract text from the web pages.\n#E3 = WebCrawler[#E2]\n\n4. Use InfoGatherer to identify the author and their other works from the text.\n\nPlan: Ask InfoGatherer to identify the author and their other works.\n#E4 = InfoGatherer[\"Who is the author of To Kill a Mockingbird and what are their other works, based on the following text: \" + #E3]\n\n5. Final Answer: #E4\n\nThis should give me the author's name and a list of other works in one go. It's efficient and uses all the tools required.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can consider adding a step to cross-verify the information from multiple sources, but given the constraints, this should suffice.\n\nFinal plan:\n\nPlan: Search for \"To Kill a Mockingbird author other works\" on Bing.\n#E1 = Bing[\"To Kill a Mockingbird author other works\"]\n\nPlan: Extract URLs from the search results.\n#E2 = LinkPicker[#E1]\n\nPlan: Extract text from the web pages.\n#E3 = WebCrawler[#E2]\n\nPlan: Ask InfoGatherer to identify the author and their other works.\n#E4 = InfoGatherer[\"Who is the author of To Kill a Mockingbird and what are their other works, based on the following text: \" + #E3]\n\nFinal Answer: #E4"
