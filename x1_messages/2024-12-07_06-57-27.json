        "content": "Tiger Balm, the well-known topical analgesic, is composed of several key ingredients that contribute to its distinctive aroma and therapeutic effects. The primary components include camphor, menthol, and oil derived from the camphor tree. The camphor tree, scientifically known as Cinnamomum camphora, is a large evergreen tree that originates from East Asia. It is renowned for its strong, pungent scent, which is primarily due to the high concentration of camphor in its wood and leaves. This oil is extracted from the tree and used in various medicinal and cosmetic products, including Tiger Balm, for its soothing and invigorating properties."
