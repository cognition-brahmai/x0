        "content": "So if a bacteria population doubles every hour, and we want to know how many times larger it will be after 8 hours compared to when it started, right? Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for something to double every hour. If I start with, say, 1 bacterium, after one hour, it doubles to 2. After another hour, those 2 each double to make 4. Then 4 double to make 8, and so on. So, it's multiplying by 2 for each hour that passes.\n\nSo, if I have an initial amount, let's call it P0, and it doubles every hour, then after 1 hour, it's 2 * P0. After 2 hours, it's 2 * 2 * P0, which is 2^2 * P0. After 3 hours, it's 2^3 * P0, and so on.\n\nSo, in general, after t hours, the population Pt would be P0 multiplied by 2 raised to the power of t. So, Pt = P0 * 2^t.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many times larger the population is after 8 hours compared to the initial size. So, I think I need to find the ratio of P8 to P0, which would be (P0 * 2^8) / P0. The P0 cancels out, leaving just 2^8.\n\nSo, 2 raised to the 8th power is 256. Therefore, the population is 256 times larger after 8 hours.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If it doubles every hour, then each hour it multiplies by 2. So, after 1 hour, it's multiplied by 2 once. After 2 hours, it's multiplied by 2 twice, which is 2^2, or 4. After 3 hours, 2^3, or 8, and so on.\n\nSo, after 8 hours, it should be multiplied by 2 eight times, which is 2^8, which is 256.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as geometric growth, where the growth factor is 2 per hour. So, over 8 hours, the cumulative growth factor is 2^8.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list out the population at each hour:\n\n- Start: P0\n\n- After 1 hour: 2 * P0\n\n- After 2 hours: 2 * 2 * P0 = 4 * P0\n\n- After 3 hours: 2 * 4 * P0 = 8 * P0\n\n- After 4 hours: 2 * 8 * P0 = 16 * P0\n\n- After 5 hours: 2 * 16 * P0 = 32 * P0\n\n- After 6 hours: 2 * 32 * P0 = 64 * P0\n\n- After 7 hours: 2 * 64 * P0 = 128 * P0\n\n- After 8 hours: 2 * 128 * P0 = 256 * P0\n\nSo, again, after 8 hours, it's 256 times the initial population.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the population is 256 times larger after 8 hours compared to its initial size.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{256} \\]"
