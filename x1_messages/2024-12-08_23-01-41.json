        "content": "So I've got this problem: if you flip a coin twice, what's the probability of getting two heads? And I need to show my work. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that when you flip a fair coin, there are two possible outcomes for each flip: heads (H) or tails (T). Since the coin is fair, the probability of getting heads on a single flip is 1/2, and the same goes for tails.\n\nNow, when you flip the coin twice, each flip is independent of the other. That means the outcome of the first flip doesn't affect the outcome of the second flip. So, to find the probability of getting two heads in a row, I need to find the probability of getting heads on the first flip and heads on the second flip.\n\nSince the flips are independent, I can multiply the probabilities together. So, the probability of getting heads on the first flip is 1/2, and the probability of getting heads on the second flip is also 1/2. Therefore, the probability of both events happening is:\n\nP(two heads) = P(H on first flip) \u00d7 P(H on second flip) = (1/2) \u00d7 (1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should think about it differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to list all possible outcomes when flipping a coin twice. Each flip has two possibilities, so for two flips, there are 2 \u00d7 2 = 4 possible outcomes. Let's list them:\n\n1. Heads on first flip and heads on second flip (H, H)\n\n2. Heads on first flip and tails on second flip (H, T)\n\n3. Tails on first flip and heads on second flip (T, H)\n\n4. Tails on first flip and tails on second flip (T, T)\n\nSo, there are four equally likely outcomes. Out of these, only one outcome corresponds to getting two heads: (H, H). Therefore, the probability should be 1 out of 4, which is 1/4.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, it's consistent.\n\nBut let's consider if the coin is unfair, just to see. Suppose the probability of heads is not 1/2, but some other value, say p. Then, the probability of getting two heads would be p \u00d7 p = p\u00b2. But in this problem, it's a fair coin, so p = 1/2, and p\u00b2 = (1/2)\u00b2 = 1/4.\n\nAlright, I think I'm confident with this answer. But to be thorough, maybe I should think about the addition rule or something else, just to make sure.\n\nWait, no. Probability rules tell us that for independent events, we multiply their probabilities to find the probability of both occurring. In this case, the two coin flips are independent, so multiplication is the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of binomial probability. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(k successes in n trials) = C(n, k) \u00d7 p^k \u00d7 (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\nIn this scenario, n = 2 (two flips), k = 2 (two heads), and p = 1/2.\n\nSo, P(2 heads in 2 flips) = C(2, 2) \u00d7 (1/2)^2 \u00d7 (1 - 1/2)^{2-2} = 1 \u00d7 (1/4) \u00d7 (1/2)^0 = 1 \u00d7 (1/4) \u00d7 1 = 1/4\n\nAgain, the same answer. This is reassuring.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Suppose someone thinks that the two flips are not independent. But for a fair coin, each flip is independent of the others. So, that shouldn't be a issue here.\n\nAlso, maybe someone might think about the order of the flips. But since we're specifically looking for two heads in a row, the order matters. (H, H). If the order didn't matter, it would be combinations, but in this case, it's permutations because sequence matters.\n\nWait, actually, in my earlier list of outcomes, (H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T), each is distinct and ordered. So, treating them as ordered pairs is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was about getting two heads without regard to order, but since it's two flips, it's essentially the same.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The probability is indeed 1/4, or 25%.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I can think about simulating this. If I flip a coin twice many times, say 100 times, I would expect to get two heads about 25 times, assuming a fair coin.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, final answer: 1/4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}} \\]"
