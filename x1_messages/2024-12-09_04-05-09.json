        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students playing different sports, and I need to figure out how many students don't play any sport. Let me see... There are 40 students in total. Some play football, some play basketball, some play volleyball, and some play combinations of these sports. It's a bit tricky, but I think I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this.\n\nFirst, let's list out what we know:\n\n- Total students, n = 40\n\n- Students playing football, F = 12\n\n- Students playing basketball, B = 18\n\n- Students playing volleyball, V = 25\n\n- Students playing both football and basketball, F \u2229 B = 5\n\n- Students playing both football and volleyball, F \u2229 V = 8\n\n- Students playing both basketball and volleyball, B \u2229 V = 10\n\n- Students playing all three sports, F \u2229 B \u2229 V = 2\n\nOkay, so the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets is:\n\nn(F \u222a B \u222a V) = F + B + V - (F \u2229 B) - (F \u2229 V) - (B \u2229 V) + (F \u2229 B \u2229 V)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nn(F \u222a B \u222a V) = 12 + 18 + 25 - 5 - 8 - 10 + 2\n\nLet me calculate that step by step:\n\n12 + 18 = 30\n\n30 + 25 = 55\n\nNow, subtract the intersections:\n\n55 - 5 = 50\n\n50 - 8 = 42\n\n42 - 10 = 32\n\nThen, add back the students who play all three sports:\n\n32 + 2 = 34\n\nSo, 34 students play at least one sport.\n\nNow, to find the number of students who don't play any sport, I'll subtract the number who play at least one sport from the total number of students:\n\n40 - 34 = 6\n\nTherefore, 6 students don't play any sport.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I missed something. Is there any possibility that some students are being counted incorrectly?\n\nLet me verify the inclusion-exclusion principle. Yes, it's correct: when you add the individual sets, you subtract the pairwise intersections because those have been counted twice, and then you add back the intersection of all three because it was subtracted too many times.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a Venn diagram to visualize this.\n\nImagine three circles overlapping. One for football, one for basketball, and one for volleyball.\n\nFirst, the students who play all three sports are 2. So, the intersection of all three circles is 2.\n\nNext, students who play both football and basketball but not volleyball would be F \u2229 B - F \u2229 B \u2229 V = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nSimilarly, students who play both football and volleyball but not basketball: F \u2229 V - F \u2229 B \u2229 V = 8 - 2 = 6\n\nStudents who play both basketball and volleyball but not football: B \u2229 V - F \u2229 B \u2229 V = 10 - 2 = 8\n\nNow, students who play only football: F - (F \u2229 B + F \u2229 V - F \u2229 B \u2229 V) = 12 - (5 + 8 - 2) = 12 - 11 = 1\n\nSimilarly, students who play only basketball: B - (F \u2229 B + B \u2229 V - F \u2229 B \u2229 V) = 18 - (5 + 10 - 2) = 18 - 13 = 5\n\nStudents who play only volleyball: V - (F \u2229 V + B \u2229 V - F \u2229 B \u2229 V) = 25 - (8 + 10 - 2) = 25 - 16 = 9\n\nNow, let's add up all these distinct parts:\n\nOnly football: 1\n\nOnly basketball: 5\n\nOnly volleyball: 9\n\nFootball and basketball only: 3\n\nFootball and volleyball only: 6\n\nBasketball and volleyball only: 8\n\nAll three sports: 2\n\nTotal students playing at least one sport: 1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 6 + 8 + 2 = 34\n\nAgain, subtracting from total students: 40 - 34 = 6\n\nSo, yes, my initial calculation was correct. 6 students don't play any sport.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider using set theory formulas or even probabilities, but since it's a straightforward inclusion-exclusion problem, that seems unnecessary.\n\nI think 6 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
