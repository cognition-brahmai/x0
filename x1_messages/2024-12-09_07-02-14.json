        "content": "So the company has a profit margin of 25%, and they sell an item for $150. I need to find out what their cost was to produce it.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a profit margin means. A profit margin of 25% typically means that the profit is 25% of the selling price. Wait, no. Actually, there are different ways to interpret profit margin\u2014some people mean profit as a percentage of cost, others as a percentage of selling price.\n\nI think in this context, it's probably profit as a percentage of cost, which is common in business. So, if the profit margin is 25%, that means the profit is 25% of the cost.\n\nLet me denote the cost as C and the selling price as S. Given that S = $150 and the profit is S - C, which is also equal to 25% of C.\n\nSo, S - C = 0.25 * C\n\nPlugging in S = 150:\n\n150 - C = 0.25C\n\nNow, I can solve for C:\n\n150 = C + 0.25C\n\n150 = 1.25C\n\nC = 150 / 1.25\n\nC = 120\n\nSo, the cost to produce the item was $120.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if profit margin is always defined as profit over cost. I recall that sometimes it's defined differently.\n\nAlternatively, profit margin can sometimes be defined as profit divided by selling price. If that's the case, then:\n\nProfit Margin = (S - C) / S = 25%\n\nSo, (150 - C) / 150 = 0.25\n\nThen, 150 - C = 0.25 * 150\n\n150 - C = 37.5\n\nC = 150 - 37.5 = 112.5\n\nSo, depending on how profit margin is defined, the cost could be either $120 or $112.50.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. I need to figure out which definition is being used here.\n\nLet me see\u2014if profit margin is 25%, and it's based on cost, then C + 0.25C = S, which is 1.25C = 150, so C = 120.\n\nIf profit margin is 25% of selling price, then S - C = 0.25S, so C = S - 0.25S = 0.75S = 0.75*150 = 112.5.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nI think in business, profit margin is often expressed as a percentage of cost, not selling price. But to be safe, I should consider both possibilities.\n\nPerhaps I should look it up to confirm the standard definition.\n\n[Simulates searching for information]\n\nAh, I found that there are different types of profit margins. Gross profit margin is typically calculated as (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold)/Revenue, which is profit as a percentage of revenue.\n\nBut in this question, it just says \"profit margin of 25%,\" without specifying whether it's based on cost or selling price.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, maybe I should consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst scenario: profit is 25% of cost.\n\nSo, S = C + 0.25C = 1.25C\n\nTherefore, C = S / 1.25 = 150 / 1.25 = 120\n\nSecond scenario: profit is 25% of selling price.\n\nSo, S - C = 0.25S\n\nTherefore, C = S - 0.25S = 0.75S = 0.75*150 = 112.5\n\nSo, depending on the interpretation, the cost could be either $120 or $112.50.\n\nPerhaps the standard definition in business is profit as a percentage of cost, in which case $120 would be the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a different approach.\n\nLet me think in terms of equations.\n\nLet C be the cost.\n\nSelling price S = $150\n\nProfit P = S - C\n\nProfit margin = P / C = 25% = 0.25\n\nSo, (S - C)/C = 0.25\n\nS/C - 1 = 0.25\n\nS/C = 1.25\n\nC = S / 1.25 = 150 / 1.25 = 120\n\nAlternatively, if profit margin is P/S = 0.25, then:\n\n(S - C)/S = 0.25\n\n1 - C/S = 0.25\n\nC/S = 0.75\n\nC = 0.75 * S = 0.75 * 150 = 112.5\n\nSo, again, two possible answers based on different interpretations.\n\nMaybe I should consider context clues in the question.\n\nThe question says \"profit margin of 25%.\" Without further specification, it might be safe to assume it's profit as a percentage of cost.\n\nAdditionally, in accounting, gross profit margin is typically calculated as (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold)/Revenue, which is profit as a percentage of revenue.\n\nHowever, operating margin or net profit margin might be calculated differently.\n\nBut in this context, since it's about selling products, it's likely referring to gross profit margin, which is based on revenue.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought gross profit margin is (Revenue - COGS)/Revenue.\n\nBut in that case, if it's 25%, then C = 0.75 * S = 112.5\n\nAlternatively, if it's defined as (S - C)/C = 0.25, then C = S / 1.25 = 120\n\nI think both interpretations are valid depending on the context, and without specified, it's ambiguous.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to assume the common business practice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that a 25% profit margin based on cost is different from a 25% profit margin based on selling price.\n\nIn the first case, with C = 120, S = 150, P = 30, and P/C = 30/120 = 25%, which matches the given profit margin.\n\nIn the second case, with C = 112.5, S = 150, P = 37.5, and P/S = 37.5/150 = 25%, which also matches the given profit margin.\n\nSo, depending on whether profit margin is based on cost or selling price, the cost is either $120 or $112.50.\n\nI think the more common interpretation in business is profit margin based on selling price, which would make the cost $112.50.\n\nTherefore, the cost to produce the item was $112.50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{112.50} \\]"
