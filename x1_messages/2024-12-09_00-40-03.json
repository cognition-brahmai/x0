In many European folklore traditions, storks are believed to bring babies to new parents, often depicted as placing the\u5a74\u513f in a blanket and gently setting them down in the house. This myth likely originated because storks build large nests on rooftops and chimneys, making their presence conspicuous in residential areas.\n\nIn yoga, the \"stork pose\" is a balancing posture that involves standing on one leg while lifting the other leg forward and extending the arms. It's a pose that requires balance and focus, much like the delicate task of delivering a baby, though the connection between the two is more symbolic than literal.\n\nSo, to summarize, the bird associated with delivering babies and which also names a yoga pose is the stork."
