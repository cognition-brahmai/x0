        "content": "Alright, I'm going to create a simple ATM program in Python. The ATM should allow users to deposit money, withdraw money, check their balance, and exit the program. I need to make sure that the user inputs are validated and that any errors are handled properly.\n\nFirst, I'll start by setting up the basic structure of the program. I'll use a loop to keep the ATM running until the user chooses to exit. I'll also need to keep track of the user's balance, so I'll initialize a variable for that.\n\nLet me think about how I want to structure the menu. I can display options like:\n\n1. Deposit money\n\n2. Withdraw money\n\n3. Check balance\n\n4. Exit\n\nThen, based on the user's choice, I'll perform the corresponding action.\n\nI need to make sure that the user enters a valid choice. If they enter something that's not a number or a number that doesn't correspond to an option, I should display an error message and ask them to try again.\n\nFor depositing money, I'll ask the user how much they want to deposit and add that amount to the balance. I need to make sure that the amount is a positive number.\n\nSimilarly, for withdrawing money, I'll ask how much they want to withdraw and subtract that amount from the balance, but only if the balance is sufficient. If the balance is less than the withdrawal amount, I should display an error message.\n\nFor checking the balance, I'll simply display the current balance.\n\nWhen the user chooses to exit, I'll break out of the loop and end the program.\n\nI should also handle cases where the user enters non-numeric values for deposit or withdrawal amounts. In such cases, I'll need to display an error message and ask for input again.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline of the program:\n\nInitialize balance to 0\n\nDisplay welcome message\n\nStart a loop:\n\nDisplay menu options\n\nAsk for user choice\n\nIf choice is 1:\n\nAsk for deposit amount\n\nValidate and add to balance\n\nElif choice is 2:\n\nAsk for withdrawal amount\n\nValidate and subtract from balance if sufficient\n\nElif choice is 3:\n\nDisplay current balance\n\nElif choice is 4:\n\nBreak out of the loop\n\nElse:\n\nDisplay invalid choice message\n\nEnd of loop\n\nDisplay exit message\n\nNow, I need to implement this in code. I'll use functions to handle each operation to make the code cleaner.\n\nFirst, I'll define a function for depositing money:\n\nDefine deposit():\n\nAsk for deposit amount\n\nWhile amount is not valid:\n\nTry to convert to float\n\nIf error, display message and ask again\n\nIf amount is negative, display message and ask again\n\nAdd amount to balance\n\nDisplay success message\n\nSimilarly, define withdraw():\n\nAsk for withdrawal amount\n\nWhile amount is not valid:\n\nTry to convert to float\n\nIf error, display message and ask again\n\nIf amount is negative, display message and ask again\n\nIf amount is greater than balance, display error\n\nElse, subtract from balance and display success\n\nDefine check_balance():\n\nDisplay current balance\n\nDefine main():\n\nInitialize balance to 0\n\nDisplay welcome message\n\nStart a loop:\n\nDisplay menu\n\nAsk for choice\n\nIf choice is 1, call deposit()\n\nElif choice is 2, call withdraw()\n\nElif choice is 3, call check_balance()\n\nElif choice is 4, break\n\nElse, display invalid choice\n\nDisplay exit message\n\nIf this module is the main program, call main()\n\nI need to make sure that the balance is accessible in all functions. Since balance is modified in deposit and withdraw functions, I'll need to use a global variable or pass it around. In this case, using a global variable might be simpler.\n\nLet me write the code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple ATM program in Python, we need to simulate the basic functionalities of depositing money, withdrawing money, checking balance, and exiting the program. We will ensure that user inputs are validated and handle any errors appropriately.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with initializing the balance to zero.\n2. **Menu Display**: Show a menu with options to deposit, withdraw, check balance, or exit.\n3. **Input Handling**: Use a loop to keep the ATM running until the user chooses to exit. Validate user choices and handle invalid inputs gracefully.\n4. **Depositing Money**: Ask for the deposit amount, ensure it's a positive number, and add it to the balance.\n5. **Withdrawing Money**: Ask for the withdrawal amount, ensure it's a positive number and does not exceed the balance, then subtract it from the balance.\n6. **Checking Balance**: Display the current balance.\n7. **Exiting**: Break out of the loop to end the program.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef deposit(balance):\n    while True:\n        try:\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to deposit: \"))\n            if amount <= 0:\n                print(\"Amount must be greater than zero.\")\n            else:\n                balance += amount\n                print(f\"Deposited: {amount}. New balance: {balance}\")\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n    return balance\n\ndef withdraw(balance):\n    while True:\n        try:\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to withdraw: \"))\n            if amount <= 0:\n                print(\"Amount must be greater than zero.\")\n            elif amount > balance:\n                print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n            else:\n                balance -= amount\n                print(f\"Withdrew: {amount}. New balance: {balance}\")\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n    return balance\n\ndef check_balance(balance):\n    print(f\"Current balance: {balance}\")\n\ndef main():\n    balance = 0\n    print(\"Welcome to the Simple ATM\")\n    \n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nATM Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit money\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw money\")\n        print(\"3. Check balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n        \n        try:\n            choice = int(input(\"Choose an option (1-4): \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 4.\")\n            continue\n        \n        if choice == 1:\n            balance = deposit(balance)\n        elif choice == 2:\n            balance = withdraw(balance)\n        elif choice == 3:\n            check_balance(balance)\n        elif choice == 4:\n            print(\"Thank you for using the Simple ATM. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please select a valid option.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The balance is initialized to zero.\n- **Menu Display**: A menu is displayed with options 1 through 4.\n- **Input Handling**: The program keeps asking for input until a valid choice is made. It handles non-numeric inputs and ensures amounts are positive.\n- **Depositing and Withdrawing**: These functions validate the amounts and update the balance accordingly.\n- **Checking Balance**: Simply displays the current balance.\n- **Exiting**: Terminates the program gracefully.\n\nThis approach ensures that the ATM simulation is user-friendly and robust against invalid inputs."
