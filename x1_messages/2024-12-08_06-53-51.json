        "content": "Let's tackle this reading problem step by step. So, I've got a book with 300 pages, and I plan to read 20 pages per day. But there's a twist: each day, I re-read 5 pages from the previous day. Hmm, that means I'm not making as much progress as I think because I'm going back to re-read some pages.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many new pages I'm actually reading each day. If I read 20 pages daily but re-read 5 of those, then perhaps I'm only advancing by 15 pages each day. Wait, but that doesn't seem quite right. Let me think again.\n\nOn day one, I read 20 new pages. On day two, I re-read 5 pages from day one and read 15 new pages. So, total pages read by the end of day two would be 20 (day one) plus 15 (new on day two), which is 35 pages.\n\nWait, but does re-reading those 5 pages mean I'm spending time on them again, or does it affect the total pages I've read so far? Maybe I should consider the net new pages I'm reading each day after accounting for the re-reading.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\n**Option 1: Net new pages per day**\n\nEach day, I read 20 pages, but 5 of those are re-read from the previous day. So, net new pages per day are 20 - 5 = 15 pages.\n\nSo, if I read 15 new pages each day, the total number of days to finish the book would be 300 / 15 = 20 days.\n\nThat seems straightforward, but maybe I'm missing something here.\n\n**Option 2: Accumulative reading**\n\nLet's think about it differently. Each day, I read 20 pages, but 5 of those are overlapping with the previous day's reading.\n\nSo, on day one, I read pages 1-20.\n\nOn day two, I re-read pages 16-20 and read new pages 21-35.\n\nWait, if I re-read 5 pages from the previous day, that means the overlap is 5 pages between day one and day two.\n\nSo, total unique pages read by the end of day two would be 20 (day one) + (20 - 5) = 35 pages, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nContinuing this pattern:\n\n- Day one: pages 1-20\n\n- Day two: pages 16-35\n\n- Day three: pages 31-50\n\n- Day four: pages 46-65\n\n- and so on.\n\nEach day, the starting page is 15 pages ahead of the previous day's starting page because I'm re-reading 5 pages.\n\nSo, the starting page number each day is day_number * 15 + 1.\n\nWait, let's verify that.\n\n- Day one: 1 + (1-1)*15 = 1\n\n- Day two: 1 + (2-1)*15 = 16\n\n- Day three: 1 + (3-1)*15 = 31\n\n- Day four: 1 + (4-1)*15 = 46\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the starting page each day is 1 + (day_number - 1) * 15.\n\nSimilarly, the ending page is starting_page + 19 (since I read 20 pages each day).\n\nWait, why +19? Because if starting page is 1, then 1+19=20, which is correct for pages 1-20.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to find the day when the ending page >= 300.\n\nSo, let's set up the equation:\n\nstarting_page + 19 >= 300\n\n1 + (day_number - 1) * 15 + 19 >= 300\n\nSimplify:\n\n( day_number - 1 ) * 15 + 20 >= 300\n\n( day_number - 1 ) * 15 >= 280\n\nday_number - 1 >= 280 / 15\n\nday_number - 1 >= 18.666...\n\nSince day_number must be an integer, day_number - 1 >= 19, so day_number >= 20.\n\nSo, on day 20, I would reach or surpass page 300.\n\nWait, but let's verify that.\n\nCalculate starting page on day 20:\n\n1 + (20 - 1) * 15 = 1 + 19*15 = 1 + 285 = 286\n\nEnding page: 286 + 19 = 305, which is beyond page 300.\n\nSo, on day 20, I finish reading up to page 305, which means I've completed the book.\n\nBut, does that mean I finish the book on day 20?\n\nWell, since the book has 300 pages, and on day 20 I read up to page 305, which includes page 300, yes, I've finished the book on day 20.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I finish earlier.\n\nWait, on day 19:\n\nStarting page: 1 + (19 - 1)*15 = 1 + 18*15 = 1 + 270 = 271\n\nEnding page: 271 + 19 = 290\n\nSo, by the end of day 19, I've read up to page 290.\n\nOn day 20, I start from page 286 and read up to page 305.\n\nWait, but page 291 to 305 on day 20.\n\nSo, to read up to page 300, I would have completed the book on day 20.\n\nTherefore, it takes 20 days to finish the book.\n\nNow, let's consider another approach to confirm this.\n\n**Option 3: Total pages read over days**\n\nEach day, I read 20 pages, but there's an overlap of 5 pages with the previous day.\n\nSo, the total unique pages read after n days would be:\n\nTotal pages = 20*n - 5*(n-1)\n\nBecause each day after the first, I'm re-reading 5 pages.\n\nSo, total unique pages = 20*n - 5*(n-1)\n\nSimplify:\n\n20n - 5n + 5 = 15n + 5\n\nSet this greater than or equal to 300:\n\n15n + 5 >= 300\n\n15n >= 295\n\nn >= 295 / 15\n\nn >= 19.666...\n\nSince n must be an integer, n >= 20.\n\nAgain, this suggests that it takes 20 days to finish the book.\n\nWait, but let's check the total unique pages on day 19 and day 20.\n\nDay 19:\n\nTotal unique pages = 15*19 + 5 = 285 + 5 = 290 pages\n\nDay 20:\n\nTotal unique pages = 15*20 + 5 = 300 + 5 = 305 pages\n\nSo, by the end of day 19, I've read 290 pages, and by the end of day 20, I've read 305 pages, which includes page 300.\n\nTherefore, I finish the book on day 20.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each day I'm making a net progress of 15 pages, as in Option 1.\n\nSo, 300 / 15 = 20 days.\n\nThis aligns with both Option 2 and Option 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 20 days.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way to look at this.\n\n**Option 4: Geometric series or other approaches**\n\nHmm, I don't think a geometric series applies here, as the reading pattern is linear with a constant net progress each day.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as an arithmetic sequence.\n\nLet\u2019s define the total unique pages read after n days as a sequence.\n\nFrom Option 3, we have:\n\nTotal pages = 15n + 5\n\nSet 15n + 5 >= 300\n\nSolve for n:\n\n15n >= 295\n\nn >= 19.666...\n\nn = 20 days\n\nThis confirms the previous results.\n\nI think this is solid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the overlap each day.\n\nEach day, I read 20 pages, but 5 are overlaps.\n\nSo, the net new pages are 15 per day.\n\nThus, total pages = net pages per day * number of days\n\n300 = 15 * n\n\nn = 300 / 15 = 20 days\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI can't see any flaw in this reasoning.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that it will take 20 days to finish the book.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
