        "content": "In the style of Walt Whitman, a cinquain about hope might look like this:\n\nHope, vast and free,\nSprouting like grass in the wild,\nEnduring, persistent,\nThrough storm and calm, it weaves its spell,\nEver-renewing, boundless.\n\nNote: Walt Whitman's poetry is known for its free verse, celebration of nature, and exploration of the human experience. This cinquain attempts to capture some of that spirit while adhering to the traditional cinquain structure."
