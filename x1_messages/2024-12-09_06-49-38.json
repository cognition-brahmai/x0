        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains, one leaving Town A at 60 mph and the other leaving Town B at 80 mph, and the towns are 200 miles apart. I need to find out when they will meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand the situation. The two trains are moving towards each other from two different points, Town A and Town B, which are 200 miles apart. So, they are approaching each other, and I need to find the time when they meet.\n\nI recall that when two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So, the relative speed here would be 60 mph + 80 mph = 140 mph.\n\nNow, the initial distance between them is 200 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Relative Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 200 miles / 140 mph\n\nLet me calculate that. 200 divided by 140 is... hmm, 140 goes into 200 one time, with 60 miles left over. So, 1 hour and 60 miles still to go. Now, 140 mph means they cover 140 miles in one hour, so 60 miles would take less than an hour.\n\nAlternatively, I can simplify the fraction: 200/140 = 10/7 hours.\n\nBut I think it's better to convert this into hours and minutes. So, 10/7 hours is approximately 1.4286 hours.\n\nTo convert the decimal part to minutes, I can multiply 0.4286 by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).\n\n0.4286 * 60 \u2248 25.716 minutes.\n\nSo, approximately, it would take 1 hour and 26 minutes for the two trains to meet.\n\nWait a minute, let me check my calculation again. Maybe I can do it differently to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the distance each train covers in time t.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time until they meet as t hours.\n\nIn t hours, the first train travels 60t miles, and the second train travels 80t miles.\n\nSince they are moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they travel should equal the initial distance between the towns, which is 200 miles.\n\nSo, 60t + 80t = 200\n\nCombining like terms, 140t = 200\n\nNow, solving for t: t = 200 / 140 = 10/7 hours, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, t = 10/7 hours, or approximately 1.4286 hours.\n\nTo express this in hours and minutes, as I did earlier, 0.4286 hours * 60 minutes/hour \u2248 25.716 minutes, which rounds to about 26 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the two trains will meet approximately 1 hour and 26 minutes after they both leave their respective towns.\n\nBut maybe I can express this in minutes only for more precision.\n\nFirst, 10/7 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 600/7 minutes \u2248 85.714 minutes.\n\nSo, approximately 85.714 minutes.\n\nIf I need to be more precise, I can leave it as 10/7 hours or 600/7 minutes.\n\nBut for practical purposes, saying 1 hour and 26 minutes is fine.\n\nAlternatively, if the question expects the answer in hours, I can leave it as 10/7 hours.\n\nBut perhaps the question is asking for the time in hours and minutes.\n\nWait, the question is: \"When will they meet?\"\n\nIt doesn't specify the format, so I should probably provide the answer in the most understandable format, which is hours and minutes.\n\nSo, 1 hour and 26 minutes after they both leave their respective towns.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nFor example, are the trains leaving at the same time? The question says \"when will they meet?\", assuming they start at the same time.\n\nIf they start at different times, that would affect the calculation, but since it doesn't specify, I assume they start simultaneously.\n\nAlso, I assume they are moving towards each other in a straight line, without any changes in speed or direction.\n\nGiven that, my calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to consider the concept of relative speed.\n\nSince they are moving towards each other, the distance between them decreases at a rate equal to the sum of their speeds, which is 140 mph.\n\nSo, to cover 200 miles at 140 mph relative speed, time is 200/140 = 10/7 hours.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 \\text{ hour and } 26 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
