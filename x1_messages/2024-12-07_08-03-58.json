        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a bag with 4 red marbles, 6 blue marbles, and 10 green marbles. That's a total of 4 + 6 + 10 = 20 marbles. We're drawing 3 marbles at random without replacement, and we want to find the probability of drawing exactly 2 red marbles and 1 blue marble.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the formula for probability: it's the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to draw 3 marbles out of 20. That sounds like a combination problem because the order doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose 3 marbles out of 20 is C(20, 3).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3!(20 - 3)!) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 1140.\n\nSo, there are 1140 possible ways to draw 3 marbles from 20.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is drawing exactly 2 red marbles and 1 blue marble.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n- Number of ways to choose 2 red marbles out of 4.\n\n- Number of ways to choose 1 blue marble out of 6.\n\nSince these are independent choices, I'll multiply these two combinations to get the total number of favorable outcomes.\n\nFirst, calculate C(4, 2) for the red marbles:\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4 - 2)!) = (4 \u00d7 3) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 6.\n\nThen, calculate C(6, 1) for the blue marble:\n\nC(6, 1) = 6! / (1!(6 - 1)!) = 6 / 1 = 6.\n\nNow, multiply these together to get the number of favorable outcomes:\n\n6 (ways to choose red) \u00d7 6 (ways to choose blue) = 36.\n\nSo, there are 36 favorable ways to draw exactly 2 red marbles and 1 blue marble.\n\nNow, to find the probability, I'll divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = 36 / 1140.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction:\n\nBoth numerator and denominator can be divided by 12.\n\n36 \u00f7 12 = 3.\n\n1140 \u00f7 12 = 95.\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 3/95.\n\nTo double-check, I can also calculate this using the formula for hypergeometric distribution, since we're drawing without replacement.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = [C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the total number of items (20 marbles).\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (4 red marbles).\n\n- n is the number of draws (3 marbles).\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (2 red marbles).\n\nBut wait, in this problem, we want exactly 2 red and 1 blue. So, we need to adjust for that.\n\nActually, the approach I took earlier is correct for exactly 2 red and 1 blue.\n\nAlternatively, using hypergeometric distribution, I would calculate the probability of drawing 2 red marbles and then separately consider the probability that the third marble is blue, given that two reds have already been drawn.\n\nBut that might complicate things. I think the initial approach is sufficient.\n\nSo, the probability is 3/95.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe I should consider the position in which the marbles are drawn. Does the order matter here? The problem says \"draw 3 marbles at random without replacement,\" and it asks for exactly 2 red and 1 blue.\n\nSince the order doesn't matter, my initial approach should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability step by step, considering the order of drawing.\n\nLet's try that to verify.\n\nFirst draw: could be red, blue, or green.\n\nBut since order doesn't matter, it's better to use combinations.\n\nAlternatively, let's calculate it step by step:\n\nFirst, draw a red marble: probability is 4/20.\n\nThen, draw another red marble: now there are 3 red left and 19 total marbles, so 3/19.\n\nThen, draw a blue marble: now there are 6 blue marbles left and 18 total marbles, so 6/18.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing red, red, blue in that order is (4/20) * (3/19) * (6/18).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n(4/20) = 1/5.\n\n(3/19) = 3/19.\n\n(6/18) = 1/3.\n\nMultiplying them together: (1/5) * (3/19) * (1/3) = (1 * 3 * 1) / (5 * 19 * 3) = 3 / 285 = 1 / 95.\n\nBut wait, that's 1/95, and earlier I got 3/95. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nI think I see the problem: in this step-by-step approach, I considered only one specific order: red, red, blue. But there are other orders in which we can draw 2 reds and 1 blue: red, blue, red; blue, red, red.\n\nSo, I need to account for all possible orders.\n\nThere are C(3, 2) = 3 ways to arrange 2 reds and 1 blue in three draws.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is 3 * (1/95) = 3/95.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier result.\n\nSo, the probability is indeed 3/95.\n\nAlternatively, I can confirm this using the hypergeometric distribution formula.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula for exactly k successes in n draws from a population of size N that contains K successes is:\n\nP(X = k) = [C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nIn this case:\n\n- N = 20 (total marbles)\n\n- K = 4 (red marbles)\n\n- n = 3 (marbles drawn)\n\n- k = 2 (red marbles to be drawn)\n\nBut, since we also need exactly 1 blue marble, we need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, actually, the hypergeometric formula gives the probability of drawing exactly k red marbles. Then, given that, we need to ensure that the remaining marble is blue.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to stick with the initial combination approach.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the probability of drawing exactly 2 red marbles and 1 blue marble using the hypergeometric formula by considering both colors simultaneously.\n\nBut that might be more complicated.\n\nGiven that my initial approach and the step-by-step multiplication approach both lead to the same answer, I'm confident that the probability is 3/95.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3/95.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{95}} \\]"
