        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I have a right triangle with legs measuring 7 inches and 24 inches, and I need to find the length of the hypotenuse in centimeters. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst things first, I need to remember how to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle. I think it's something to do with the Pythagorean theorem. Yeah, that's it! The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (let's call it c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two legs (let's call them a and b). So, it's a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2.\n\nSo, in this case, a = 7 inches and b = 24 inches. Plugging these values into the formula, I get:\n\n7\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n\nCalculating the squares:\n\n49 + 576 = c\u00b2\n\nAdding those up:\n\n625 = c\u00b2\n\nNow, to find c, I need to take the square root of both sides:\n\nc = \u221a625\n\nc = 25 inches\n\nSo, the hypotenuse is 25 inches. But the problem asks for the length in centimeters. I need to convert inches to centimeters. I recall that 1 inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters. So, to convert 25 inches to centimeters, I'll multiply by 2.54:\n\n25 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = 63.5 centimeters\n\nTherefore, the length of the hypotenuse is 63.5 centimeters.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. What if I convert the legs to centimeters first and then apply the Pythagorean theorem?\n\nLet's try that. Converting 7 inches and 24 inches to centimeters:\n\n7 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = 17.78 cm\n\n24 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = 60.96 cm\n\nNow, applying the Pythagorean theorem in centimeters:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n\n17.78\u00b2 + 60.96\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n\nCalculating the squares:\n\n(17.78)^2 = 316.1284\n\n(60.96)^2 = 3716.4816\n\nAdding them up:\n\n316.1284 + 3716.4816 = 4032.61 cm\u00b2\n\nNow, taking the square root to find c:\n\nc = \u221a4032.61 \u2248 63.5 cm\n\nSo, I get the same result. That gives me more confidence that 63.5 cm is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Is there a possibility that the legs are not both in inches, or maybe the hypotenuse is given and I need to find something else? No, the problem clearly states that the legs are 7 inches and 24 inches, and I need to find the hypotenuse in centimeters.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the triangle is indeed a right triangle. The problem says it is, so I can assume that's correct.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm using the correct conversion factor from inches to centimeters. I'm pretty sure 1 inch = 2.54 cm is the standard conversion, so that should be fine.\n\nLet me also verify the calculation:\n\nFirst method:\n\n7\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 = 49 + 576 = 625\n\n\u221a625 = 25 inches\n\n25 inches * 2.54 = 63.5 cm\n\nSecond method:\n\n17.78\u00b2 + 60.96\u00b2 = 316.1284 + 3716.4816 = 4032.61 cm\u00b2\n\n\u221a4032.61 \u2248 63.5 cm\n\nBoth methods give the same result, so I think it's correct.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any rounding error. In the second method, I used 17.78 and 60.96 for the legs in centimeters. If I use more decimal places, say 17.7800 and 60.9600, the result should be more precise.\n\nCalculating:\n\n17.7800\u00b2 = 316.128400\n\n60.9600\u00b2 = 3716.481600\n\nSum = 4032.609999999999\n\nSquare root of that is approximately 63.50 cm\n\nSo, still 63.5 cm when rounded to one decimal place.\n\nTherefore, the length of the hypotenuse is 63.5 centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{63.5} \\]"
