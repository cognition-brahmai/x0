        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a city with 100,000 registered voters. During the election, 60% of these registered voters actually cast their votes. That means we first need to find out how many people voted in total.\n\nTo find 60% of 100,000, we can calculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total votes cast} = 100,000 \\times \\frac{60}{100} = 60,000 \\]\n\nSo, 60,000 people voted in the election.\n\nNext, among these voters, 55% voted for candidate A and 45% voted for candidate B. We need to find out how many votes each candidate received.\n\nFirst, votes for candidate A:\n\n\\[ \\text{Votes for A} = 60,000 \\times \\frac{55}{100} = 33,000 \\]\n\nThen, votes for candidate B:\n\n\\[ \\text{Votes for B} = 60,000 \\times \\frac{45}{100} = 27,000 \\]\n\nNow, to find out how many more votes candidate A received than candidate B, we subtract the votes for B from the votes for A:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 33,000 - 27,000 = 6,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, candidate A received 6,000 more votes than candidate B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6000} \\]"
