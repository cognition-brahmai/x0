        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a basic banking system in Java that uses a SQLite database to store account data and transaction history. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a SQLite database. I'm familiar with SQLite since it's lightweight and easy to use for small applications like this. I'll need to create tables for accounts and transactions.\n\nFor the accounts table, I should have fields like account number, owner's name, balance, and maybe an account creation date. For transactions, I'll need fields like transaction ID, account number, transaction type (deposit, withdrawal, transfer), amount, and timestamp.\n\nI need to make sure that the database operations are efficient and that I handle any possible errors, like trying to withdraw more money than is in the account.\n\nNow, for the Java part, I'll need to create classes to represent accounts and transactions. Probably, an Account class with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and transferring funds. I'll also need a DatabaseHandler class to handle all the SQL operations.\n\nI should think about how to generate unique account numbers. Maybe use a combination of the current time and some random digits to ensure uniqueness.\n\nUser interaction: I need to create a simple interface for users to create accounts, log in, and perform transactions. Since it's a command-line program, I'll use Scanner to get input from the user.\n\nSecurity is important, especially for passwords. I should hash passwords before storing them in the database to protect user data.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Set up the SQLite database with tables for accounts and transactions.\n\n2. Create Java classes for Account and Transaction.\n\n3. Implement a DatabaseHandler class to interact with the database.\n\n4. Create methods in the Account class for deposit, withdraw, and transfer.\n\n5. Implement user interaction: create accounts, log in, perform transactions.\n\n6. Ensure data integrity and handle exceptions.\n\n7. Provide transaction history for each account.\n\nI should also think about how to keep the program running until the user chooses to exit. Maybe use a loop that displays a menu and waits for user input.\n\nAlright, let's start by setting up the database.\n\nFirst, I'll write the SQL statements to create the tables.\n\nFor the accounts table:\n\n```\n\nCREATE TABLE accounts (\n\n account_number INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n\n owner_name TEXT NOT NULL,\n\n balance REAL NOT NULL,\n\n creation_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n\n);\n\n```\n\nFor the transactions table:\n\n```\n\nCREATE TABLE transactions (\n\n transaction_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n\n account_number INTEGER,\n\n transaction_type TEXT NOT NULL,\n\n amount REAL NOT NULL,\n\n timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n\n FOREIGN KEY (account_number) REFERENCES accounts(account_number)\n\n);\n\n```\n\nI need to make sure that the account_number in transactions references the account_number in accounts.\n\nNow, in Java, I need to establish a connection to the SQLite database. I'll need to add the SQLite JDBC driver to my project.\n\nAssuming I'm using Maven, I'll add the dependency to the pom.xml:\n\n```\n\n<dependency>\n\n <groupId>org.xerial</groupId>\n\n <artifactId>sqlite-jdbc</artifactId>\n\n <version>3.36.0.3</version>\n\n</dependency>\n\n```\n\nNow, I'll create a DatabaseHandler class that handles all database operations.\n\nIn the DatabaseHandler class, I'll have methods like:\n\n- createTables(): to create the accounts and transactions tables.\n\n- createAccount(String ownerName, double initialBalance): to insert a new account into the accounts table.\n\n- getAccount(int accountNumber): to retrieve an account by its number.\n\n- deposit(int accountNumber, double amount): to add money to an account and log the transaction.\n\n- withdraw(int accountNumber, double amount): to withdraw money from an account, if sufficient balance exists, and log the transaction.\n\n- transfer(int fromAccount, int toAccount, double amount): to transfer money from one account to another, provided the sender has sufficient funds.\n\n- getTransactionHistory(int accountNumber): to retrieve all transactions for a given account.\n\nI need to handle exceptions, like SQLException, and maybe create custom exceptions for things like insufficient funds.\n\nLet me think about how to generate account numbers. I can create a method that generates a random number and checks if it already exists in the database. If it does, generate another one.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a combination of the current timestamp and a sequence number to ensure uniqueness.\n\nWait, since SQLite has an AUTOINCREMENT feature, maybe I can use that for the account_number field.\n\nLet me modify the accounts table creation statement:\n\n```\n\nCREATE TABLE accounts (\n\n account_number INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n\n owner_name TEXT NOT NULL,\n\n balance REAL NOT NULL,\n\n creation_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n\n);\n\n```\n\nThat way, each new account will get a unique account_number automatically.\n\nOkay, that simplifies things.\n\nNow, for the Account class, I'll have fields like accountNumber, ownerName, and balance.\n\nBut actually, since all data is stored in the database, maybe I don't need to store these fields in memory, except maybe for the current session.\n\nWait, to optimize, I could retrieve the account data when the user logs in and keep it in memory for the duration of the session.\n\nThen, any changes like deposits or withdrawals can be immediately reflected in memory and then saved to the database.\n\nThis way, I reduce the number of database reads.\n\nSo, in the Account class, I'll have fields for accountNumber, ownerName, and balance, and maybe a list of transactions.\n\nBut, keeping a list of all transactions in memory might not be efficient if there are many transactions. Maybe I'll just retrieve transaction history from the database when needed.\n\nAlright, perhaps the Account class should mainly hold the accountNumber and ownerName, and balance can be retrieved from the database when needed.\n\nWait, but retrieving balance for every operation might be inefficient.\n\nMaybe I'll keep the balance in memory and update the database whenever there's a change.\n\nThat way, I minimize database writes.\n\nI need to think about the trade-offs.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Keep balance in memory.\n\n- Update database only when balance changes.\n\nPros: fewer writes to the database.\n\nCons: if the program crashes, the database might not have the latest balance.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Always retrieve balance from the database before performing operations.\n\nPros: database always has the latest data.\n\nCons: more database reads, which could be slower.\n\nGiven that this is a simple banking system and we're using a local SQLite database, which is efficient for small datasets, Option 2 might be acceptable.\n\nI'll go with Option 2 for simplicity and data integrity.\n\nSo, in the Account class, I'll have methods like deposit, withdraw, and transfer, which will retrieve the current balance from the database, perform the operation, and update the database.\n\nWait, but that might not be efficient if multiple operations are performed in quick succession.\n\nAlternatively, I can retrieve the balance once when the user logs in and keep it in memory, and update it with each operation, then save it to the database when the user logs out.\n\nThat way, I reduce the number of database operations.\n\nThis introduces a potential inconsistency if the program crashes, but for a simple system, it might be acceptable.\n\nI'll go with this approach.\n\nSo, in the Account class, I'll have fields for accountNumber, ownerName, and balance, which is kept in memory during the session.\n\nThen, I'll have methods like deposit, withdraw, and transfer, which update the in-memory balance and log the transaction in the database.\n\nWhen the user logs out, I'll update the balance in the database.\n\nIf the program crashes, the next time the user logs in, their balance will be what's last saved in the database.\n\nIt's not ideal, but for this simple system, it should suffice.\n\nNow, for user interaction, I'll create a simple text menu.\n\nSomething like:\n\n\"Welcome to the Banking System\"\n\n\"1. Create Account\"\n\n\"2. Log In\"\n\n\"3. Exit\"\n\nIf the user chooses 1, they'll be prompted to enter their name and initial deposit.\n\nThen, an account will be created with a unique account number, and the user will be notified of their account number.\n\nIf they choose 2, they'll be prompted to enter their account number and password.\n\nAssuming passwords are stored hashed in the database, I'll need to hash the input password and compare it with the stored hash.\n\nOnce logged in, they'll see another menu:\n\n\"1. Deposit\"\n\n\"2. Withdraw\"\n\n\"3. Transfer\"\n\n\"4. Check Balance\"\n\n\"5. Transaction History\"\n\n\"6. Log Out\"\n\nFor each operation, I'll handle it accordingly.\n\nFor deposit, they enter the amount, which is added to the in-memory balance, and a deposit transaction is logged in the database.\n\nSimilar for withdrawal and transfer, but with checks for sufficient balance.\n\nTransaction history can be retrieved from the database.\n\nWhen they log out, the in-memory balance is saved to the database.\n\nI need to handle cases like entering invalid amounts, trying to withdraw more than the balance, etc.\n\nI should also think about concurrency, but since this is a single-user command-line application, I'll assume that only one user is using the system at a time.\n\nIn a real banking system, concurrency control would be crucial, but for this simulation, I'll skip it.\n\nNow, about hashing passwords. I need to choose a hashing algorithm, like SHA-256, and salt the passwords for security.\n\nBut implementing secure password storage is a bit involved, and since this is a simple simulation, maybe I'll just store passwords in plain text for now.\n\nWait, that's not good. Even in a simulation, I should practice good security habits.\n\nSo, I'll implement basic password hashing using SHA-256.\n\nI can use the MessageDigest class in Java for this.\n\nI'll create a method to hash passwords before storing them in the database, and compare hashed passwords when users log in.\n\nBetter yet, I'll use bcrypt for password hashing, which is more secure and designed for passwords.\n\nI can use the bcrypt library in Java for this purpose.\n\nI'll need to add the bcrypt dependency to my project.\n\nFor Maven, the dependency is:\n\n```\n\n<dependency>\n\n <groupId>org.mindrot</groupId>\n\n <artifactId>jbcrypt</artifactId>\n\n <version>0.4</version>\n\n</dependency>\n\n```\n\nThen, I can use BCrypt.hashpw and BCrypt.checkpw methods to handle password hashing and verification.\n\nThat's better.\n\nNow, let's think about the flow of the program.\n\nI'll have a main class with a main method that starts the program.\n\nIn the main method, I'll create an instance of DatabaseHandler to set up the database.\n\nThen, I'll display the main menu and handle user choices.\n\nIf the user chooses to create an account, I'll prompt for name and initial deposit, generate an account number, hash a default password (or ask the user to set one), and insert the account into the database.\n\nIf the user chooses to log in, I'll prompt for account number and password, verify the password against the hashed password in the database, and if correct, allow access to the account operations.\n\nOnce logged in, the user can perform various operations until they log out.\n\nWhen they log out, the balance is saved to the database.\n\nI need to make sure that the program handles exceptions gracefully, like entering non-numeric values for account numbers or amounts.\n\nI should use try-catch blocks to handle such errors and display user-friendly messages.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that the database connection is properly closed when the program exits.\n\nI can use try-with-resources to handle this.\n\nAlright, I think I have a plan.\n\nLet me start by creating the DatabaseHandler class.\n\nI'll write methods to create tables, create accounts, get accounts, perform deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and retrieve transaction history.\n\nI need to make sure that all database operations are properly handled and that I prevent SQL injection by using prepared statements.\n\nYes, always use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.\n\nOkay, let's start writing some code.\n\nFirst, the DatabaseHandler class.\n\nI'll need to load the SQLite JDBC driver and establish a connection to the database.\n\nHere's a rough sketch:\n\n```\n\nimport java.sql.*;\n\npublic class DatabaseHandler {\n\n private Connection connection;\n\n public DatabaseHandler() {\n\n try {\n\n Class.forName(\"org.sqlite.JDBC\");\n\n connection = DriverManager.getConnection(\"jdbc:sqlite:banking.db\");\n\n } catch (ClassNotFoundException | SQLException e) {\n\n e.printStackTrace();\n\n }\n\n }\n\n // Other methods to follow...\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThen, the createTables method:\n\n```\n\npublic void createTables() {\n\n String createAccountsTable = \"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS accounts (\" +\n\n \"account_number INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\" +\n\n \"owner_name TEXT NOT NULL,\" +\n\n \"balance REAL NOT NULL,\" +\n\n \"creation_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\" +\n\n \");\";\n\n String createTransactionsTable = \"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transactions (\" +\n\n \"transaction_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\" +\n\n \"account_number INTEGER,\" +\n\n \"transaction_type TEXT NOT NULL,\" +\n\n \"amount REAL NOT NULL,\" +\n\n \"timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\" +\n\n \"FOREIGN KEY (account_number) REFERENCES accounts(account_number)\" +\n\n \");\";\n\n try (Statement stmt = connection.createStatement()) {\n\n stmt.execute(createAccountsTable);\n\n stmt.execute(createTransactionsTable);\n\n } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n e.printStackTrace();\n\n }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nNext, the createAccount method:\n\n```\n\nimport org.mindrot.jbcrypt.BCrypt;\n\npublic void createAccount(String ownerName, double initialBalance, String password) {\n\n String hashedPassword = BCrypt.hashpw(password, BCrypt.gensalt());\n\n String insertAccount = \"INSERT INTO accounts (owner_name, balance) VALUES (?, ?);\";\n\n try (PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(insertAccount, Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS)) {\n\n pstmt.setString(1, ownerName);\n\n pstmt.setDouble(2, initialBalance);\n\n pstmt.executeUpdate();\n\n ResultSet generatedKeys = pstmt.getGeneratedKeys();\n\n if (generatedKeys.next()) {\n\n int accountNumber = generatedKeys.getInt(1);\n\n // Store password in another table or same table, depending on design\n\n }\n\n } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n e.printStackTrace();\n\n }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nWait, in the accounts table, I don't have a password field. Maybe I need to add that.\n\nYes, I should store the hashed password in the accounts table.\n\nLet me modify the accounts table creation statement:\n\n```\n\nCREATE TABLE accounts (\n\n account_number INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n\n owner_name TEXT NOT NULL,\n\n balance REAL NOT NULL,\n\n password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,\n\n creation_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n\n);\n\n```\n\nThen, in the createAccount method, I can insert the hashed password.\n\nSimilarly, in the login process, I'll retrieve the password_hash for the given account_number and use BCrypt.checkpw to verify the provided password.\n\nOkay, moving on.\n\nThe getAccount method:\n\n```\n\npublic Account getAccount(int accountNumber) {\n\n String query = \"SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE account_number = ?;\";\n\n try (PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(query)) {\n\n pstmt.setInt(1, accountNumber);\n\n ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();\n\n if (rs.next()) {\n\n String ownerName = rs.getString(\"owner_name\");\n\n double balance = rs.getDouble(\"balance\");\n\n return new Account(accountNumber, ownerName, balance);\n\n }\n\n } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n e.printStackTrace();\n\n }\n\n return null;\n\n}\n\n```\n\nDeposit method:\n\n```\n\npublic void deposit(int accountNumber, double amount) {\n\n String updateBalance = \"UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + ? WHERE account_number = ?;\";\n\n String logTransaction = \"INSERT INTO transactions (account_number, transaction_type, amount) VALUES (?, 'deposit', ?);\";\n\n try (PreparedStatement pstmt1 = connection.prepareStatement(updateBalance);\n\n PreparedStatement pstmt2 = connection.prepareStatement(logTransaction)) {\n\n pstmt1.setDouble(1, amount);\n\n pstmt1.setInt(2, accountNumber);\n\n pstmt1.executeUpdate();\n\n pstmt2.setInt(1, accountNumber);\n\n pstmt2.setDouble(2, amount);\n\n pstmt2.executeUpdate();\n\n } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n e.printStackTrace();\n\n }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nWithdrawal method:\n\n```\n\npublic void withdraw(int accountNumber, double amount) {\n\n String updateBalance = \"UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ? WHERE account_number = ?;\";\n\n String logTransaction = \"INSERT INTO transactions (account_number, transaction_type, amount) VALUES (?, 'withdrawal', ?);\";\n\n try (PreparedStatement pstmt1 = connection.prepareStatement(updateBalance);\n\n PreparedStatement pstmt2 = connection.prepareStatement(logTransaction)) {\n\n pstmt1.setDouble(1, amount);\n\n pstmt1.setInt(2, accountNumber);\n\n int rowsAffected = pstmt1.executeUpdate();\n\n if (rowsAffected == 0) {\n\n // Balance insufficient or account not found\n\n throw new SQLException(\"Insufficient funds or account not found.\");\n\n }\n\n pstmt2.setInt(1, accountNumber);\n\n pstmt2.setDouble(2, amount);\n\n pstmt2.executeUpdate();\n\n } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n e.printStackTrace();\n\n }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nTransfer method:\n\n```\n\npublic void transfer(int fromAccount, int toAccount, double amount) {\n\n // First, withdraw from the sender's account\n\n withdraw(fromAccount, amount);\n\n // Then, deposit to the recipient's account\n\n deposit(toAccount, amount);\n\n // Log the transfer in both accounts' transactions\n\n String logTransferFrom = \"INSERT INTO transactions (account_number, transaction_type, amount) VALUES (?, 'transfer_out', ?);\";\n\n String logTransferTo = \"INSERT INTO transactions (account_number, transaction_type, amount) VALUES (?, 'transfer_in', ?);\";\n\n try (PreparedStatement pstmtFrom = connection.prepareStatement(logTransferFrom);\n\n PreparedStatement pstmtTo = connection.prepareStatement(logTransferTo)) {\n\n pstmtFrom.setInt(1, fromAccount);\n\n pstmtFrom.setDouble(2, amount);\n\n pstmtFrom.executeUpdate();\n\n pstmtTo.setInt(1, toAccount);\n\n pstmtTo.setDouble(2, amount);\n\n pstmtTo.executeUpdate();\n\n } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n e.printStackTrace();\n\n }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nGet transaction history:\n\n```\n\npublic List<Transaction> getTransactionHistory(int accountNumber) {\n\n List<Transaction> transactions = new ArrayList<>();\n\n String query = \"SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE account_number = ? ORDER BY timestamp DESC;\";\n\n try (PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(query)) {\n\n pstmt.setInt(1, accountNumber);\n\n ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();\n\n while (rs.next()) {\n\n int transactionId = rs.getInt(\"transaction_id\");\n\n String transactionType = rs.getString(\"transaction_type\");\n\n double amount = rs.getDouble(\"amount\");\n\n Timestamp timestamp = rs.getTimestamp(\"timestamp\");\n\n transactions.add(new Transaction(transactionId, accountNumber, transactionType, amount, timestamp));\n\n }\n\n } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n e.printStackTrace();\n\n }\n\n return transactions;\n\n}\n\n```\n\nNow, for the Account class, considering that I'm keeping balance in memory during the session, here's a rough outline:\n\n```\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\n\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class Account {\n\n private int accountNumber;\n\n private String ownerName;\n\n private double balance;\n\n private DatabaseHandler dbHandler;\n\n public Account(int accountNumber, String ownerName, double balance, DatabaseHandler dbHandler) {\n\n this.accountNumber = accountNumber;\n\n this.ownerName = ownerName;\n\n this.balance = balance;\n\n this.dbHandler = dbHandler;\n\n }\n\n public void deposit(double amount) {\n\n balance += amount;\n\n dbHandler.deposit(accountNumber, amount);\n\n }\n\n public void withdraw(double amount) throws InsufficientFundsException {\n\n if (amount > balance) {\n\n throw new InsufficientFundsException(\"Insufficient funds.\");\n\n }\n\n balance -= amount;\n\n dbHandler.withdraw(accountNumber, amount);\n\n }\n\n public void transfer(int toAccount, double amount) throws InsufficientFundsException {\n\n withdraw(amount);\n\n dbHandler.deposit(toAccount, amount);\n\n dbHandler.transfer(accountNumber, toAccount, amount);\n\n }\n\n public double getBalance() {\n\n return balance;\n\n }\n\n public List<Transaction> getTransactionHistory() {\n\n return dbHandler.getTransactionHistory(accountNumber);\n\n }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nI've also defined a custom exception class InsufficientFundsException for handling cases where a user tries to withdraw or transfer more than their balance.\n\nNow, for the user interaction part, I'll create a main class with a menu-driven interface.\n\nHere's a rough sketch:\n\n```\n\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class BankingSystem {\n\n public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n DatabaseHandler dbHandler = new DatabaseHandler();\n\n dbHandler.createTables();\n\n Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n while (true) {\n\n System.out.println(\"\\nWelcome to the Banking System\");\n\n System.out.println(\"1. Create Account\");\n\n System.out.println(\"2. Log In\");\n\n System.out.println(\"3.

Please try again.\");\n\n }\n\n }\n\n }\n\n private static void createAccount(Scanner scanner, DatabaseHandler dbHandler) {\n\n System.out.print(\"Enter your name: \");\n\n String name = scanner.nextLine();\n\n System.out.print(\"Enter initial deposit amount: \");\n\n double deposit = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n scanner.nextLine(); // Consume newline\n\n System.out.print(\"Create a password: \");\n\n String password = scanner.nextLine();\n\n dbHandler.createAccount(name, deposit, password);\n\n System.out.println(\"Account created successfully!\");\n\n }\n\n private static void logIn(Scanner scanner, DatabaseHandler dbHandler) {\n\n System.out.print(\"Enter your account number: \");\n\n int accountNumber = scanner.nextInt();\n\n scanner.nextLine(); // Consume newline\n\n System.out.print(\"Enter your password: \");\n\n String password = scanner.nextLine();\n\n Account account = dbHandler.getAccount(accountNumber);\n\n if (account != null && BCrypt.checkpw(password, account.getHashedPassword())) {\n\n System.out.println(\"Login successful!\");\n\n accountMenu(scanner, account, dbHandler);\n\n } else {\n\n System.out.println(\"Invalid account number or password.\");\n\n }\n\n }\n\n private static void accountMenu(Scanner scanner, Account account, DatabaseHandler dbHandler) {\n\n while (true) {\n\n System.out.println(\"\\nAccount Menu\");\n\n System.out.println(\"1.

Please try again.\");\n\n }\n\n }\n\n }\n\n // Implement deposit, withdraw, transfer, checkBalance, viewTransactionHistory methods\n\n}\n\n```\n\nI need to implement the deposit, withdraw, transfer, checkBalance, and viewTransactionHistory methods.\n\nAlso, in the Account class, I need to add a method to get the hashed password from the database.\n\nAlternatively, I can retrieve the hashed password when creating the Account object and store it in memory for password verification.\n\nWait, but in the logIn method, I already verify the password before creating the Account object.\n\nSo, maybe I don't need to store the hashed password in the Account class.\n\nI'll need to think about the design.\n\nAlso, in the deposit method of the Account class, I'm calling dbHandler.deposit, which updates the database.\n\nBut earlier, I thought about updating the database only when the user logs out.\n\nI need to reconcile these thoughts.\n\nMaybe I should only update the database when the user logs out, to minimize database writes.\n\nIn that case, I'll remove the dbHandler.deposit call from the deposit method in the Account class.\n\nInstead, I'll keep track of all changes in memory and update the database balance when the user logs out.\n\nSimilarly for withdrawal and transfer.\n\nThis way, I reduce the number of database operations.\n\nBut, this introduces the risk of data loss if the program crashes before the user logs out.\n\nGiven that this is a simple simulation, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nHere's an updated version of the Account class:\n\n```\n\npublic class Account {\n\n private int accountNumber;\n\n private String ownerName;\n\n private double balance;\n\n public Account(int accountNumber, String ownerName, double balance) {\n\n this.accountNumber = accountNumber;\n\n this.ownerName = ownerName;\n\n this.balance = balance;\n\n }\n\n public void deposit(double amount) {\n\n balance += amount;\n\n }\n\n public void withdraw(double amount) throws InsufficientFundsException {\n\n if (amount > balance) {\n\n throw new InsufficientFundsException(\"Insufficient funds.\");\n\n }\n\n balance -= amount;\n\n }\n\n public void transfer(Account recipient, double amount) throws InsufficientFundsException {\n\n withdraw(amount);\n\n recipient.deposit(amount);\n\n }\n\n public double getBalance() {\n\n return balance;\n\n }\n\n // Other methods as needed\n\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd in the DatabaseHandler class, I'll have a method to update the balance when the user logs out.\n\n```\n\npublic void updateBalance(int accountNumber, double balance) {\n\n String updateBalance = \"UPDATE accounts SET balance = ? WHERE account_number = ?;\";\n\n try (PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(updateBalance)) {\n\n pstmt.setDouble(1, balance);\n\n pstmt.setInt(2, accountNumber);\n\n pstmt.executeUpdate();\n\n } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n e.printStackTrace();\n\n }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nIn the accountMenu method, after performing operations like deposit, withdraw, or transfer, I won't immediately update the database.\n\nOnly when the user logs out will the in-memory balance be saved to the database.\n\nThis reduces the number of database writes but at the cost of potential data loss if the program crashes.\n\nFor this simulation, it should be acceptable.\n\nNow, I need to implement the deposit, withdraw, transfer, checkBalance, and viewTransactionHistory methods in the BankingSystem class.\n\nHere's a rough implementation:\n\n```\n\nprivate static void deposit(Scanner scanner, Account account, DatabaseHandler dbHandler) {\n\n System.out.print(\"Enter amount to deposit: \");\n\n double amount = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n scanner.nextLine(); // Consume newline\n\n account.deposit(amount);\n\n System.out.println(\"Deposit successful.\");\n\n

System.out.println(\"Transfer successful.\");\n\n dbHandler.logTransaction(account.getAccountNumber(), \"transfer_out\", amount);\n\n dbHandler.logTransaction(toAccount, \"transfer_in\", amount);\n\n } else {\n\n System.out.println(\"Recipient account not found.\");\n\n }\n\n } catch (InsufficientFundsException e) {\n\n System.out.println(e.getMessage());\n\n }\n\n}\n\nprivate static void checkBalance(Account account) {\n\n System.out.println(\"Current balance: \" + account.getBalance());\n\n}\n\nprivate static void viewTransactionHistory(Account account) {\n\n List<Transaction> transactions = account.getTransactionHistory();\n\n for (Transaction tx : transactions) {\n\n System.out.println(tx);\n\n }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nI need to make sure that the logTransaction method in DatabaseHandler is implemented.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```\n\npublic void logTransaction(int accountNumber, String transactionType, double amount) {\n\n String insertTransaction = \"INSERT INTO transactions (account_number, transaction_type, amount) VALUES (?, ?, ?);\";\n\n try (PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(insertTransaction)) {\n\n pstmt.setInt(1, accountNumber);\n\n pstmt.setString(2, transactionType);\n\n pstmt.setDouble(3, amount);\n\n pstmt.executeUpdate();\n\n } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n e.printStackTrace();\n\n }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nAlso, in the transfer method, I need to ensure that both the withdrawal and deposit are successful before logging the transactions.\n\nOtherwise, I might have inconsistent transaction logs.\n\nTo handle this, I can use database transactions, which allow grouping multiple SQL operations into a single unit of work that can be committed or rolled back.\n\nIn Java, I can set the connection to manual commit mode, perform the operations, and then commit or roll back based on success.\n\nHere's an example of how to implement the transfer method with database transactions:\n\n```\n\npublic void transfer(int fromAccount, int toAccount, double amount) {\n\n try {\n\n connection.setAutoCommit(false);\n\n withdraw(fromAccount, amount);\n\n deposit(toAccount, amount);\n\n connection.commit();\n\n } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n try {\n\n connection.rollback();\n\n } catch (SQLException ex) {\n\n ex.printStackTrace();\n\n }\n\n e.printStackTrace();\n\n } finally {\n\n try {\n\n connection.setAutoCommit(true);\n\n } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n e.printStackTrace();\n\n }\n\n }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis ensures that both operations are successful before committing the changes to the database.\n\nIf any operation fails, the changes are rolled back.\n\nI need to apply similar handling in the accountMenu methods to ensure data consistency.\n\nWait, but in my earlier design, I'm keeping the balance in memory and only updating the database when the user logs out.\n\nIn that case, I need to make sure that the in-memory balances are accurate and that the database is updated only at logout.\n\nMaybe I need to reconsider this approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can update the database immediately for each transaction to ensure data persistence.\n\nGiven the potential for data loss in the first approach, I think it's better to update the database for each transaction.\n\nSo, I'll modify the Account class to update the database immediately upon deposit, withdraw, or transfer.\n\nThis way, the database always has the latest balance, and if the program crashes, there's no loss of data.\n\nHere's an updated Account class:\n\n```\n\npublic class Account {\n\n private int accountNumber;\n\n private String ownerName;\n\n private double balance;\n\n private DatabaseHandler dbHandler;\n\n public Account(int accountNumber, String ownerName, double balance, DatabaseHandler dbHandler) {\n\n this.accountNumber = accountNumber;\n\n this.ownerName = ownerName;\n\n this.balance = balance;\n\n this.dbHandler = dbHandler;\n\n }\n\n public void deposit(double amount) {\n\n balance += amount;\n\n dbHandler.deposit(accountNumber, amount);\n\n }\n\n public void withdraw(double amount) throws InsufficientFundsException {\n\n if (amount > balance) {\n\n throw new InsufficientFundsException(\"Insufficient funds.\");\n\n }\n\n balance -= amount;\n\n dbHandler.withdraw(accountNumber, amount);\n\n }\n\n public void transfer(int toAccount, double amount) throws InsufficientFundsException {\n\n withdraw(amount);\n\n dbHandler.deposit(toAccount, amount);\n\n dbHandler.transfer(accountNumber, toAccount, amount);\n\n }\n\n public double getBalance() {\n\n return balance;\n\n }\n\n public List<Transaction> getTransactionHistory() {\n\n return dbHandler.getTransactionHistory(accountNumber);\n\n }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd in the DatabaseHandler class, I'll make sure that the deposit, withdraw, and transfer methods update the database accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that the database is always up-to-date, at the cost of more database operations.\n\nGiven that SQLite is efficient for small datasets and local use, this should be acceptable for this simulation.\n\nNow, I need to implement the custom exception class InsufficientFundsException.\n\nHere's a simple implementation:\n\n```\n\npublic class InsufficientFundsException extends Exception {\n\n public InsufficientFundsException(String message) {\n\n super(message);\n\n }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nI need to make sure to handle this exception in the user interaction methods, providing feedback to the user.\n\nAlso, I should think about validating user inputs, such as ensuring that account numbers and amounts are numeric and positive.\n\nI can use Scanner's hasNextDouble and hasNextInt methods to validate inputs.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n\nif (!scanner.hasNextDouble()) {\n\n System.out.println(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\");\n\n scanner.next(); // Clear invalid input\n\n} else {\n\n double amount = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n // Proceed with the operation\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis helps prevent errors due to invalid inputs.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure that account numbers are positive integers and that amounts are positive numbers.\n\nNow, for the transaction history, I need to decide how to display the transactions.\n\nEach transaction has a type (deposit, withdrawal, transfer_in, transfer_out) and an amount, along with a timestamp.\n\nI can format the output to show date, time, transaction type, and amount.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"2023-04-01 10:30:00 - Deposit: +$100.00\"\n\n\"2023-04-02 14:45:00 - Withdrawal: -$50.00\"\n\n\"2023-04-03 16:20:00 - Transfer Out: -$200.00\"\n\n\"2023-04-04 09:15:00 - Transfer In: +$150.00\"\n\nI'll need to format the timestamp appropriately.\n\nIn Java, I can use the Timestamp class to handle this.\n\nIn the Transaction class, I can have methods to format the transaction details for display.\n\nHere's a rough outline of the Transaction class:\n\n```\n\nimport java.sql.Timestamp;\n\npublic class Transaction {\n\n private int transactionId;\n\n private int accountNumber;\n\n private String transactionType;\n\n private double amount;\n\n private Timestamp timestamp;\n\n public Transaction(int transactionId, int accountNumber, String transactionType, double amount, Timestamp timestamp) {\n\n this.transactionId = transactionId;\n\n this.accountNumber = accountNumber;\n\n this.transactionType = transactionType;\n\n this.amount = amount;\n\n this.timestamp = timestamp;\n\n }\n\n @Override\n\n public String toString() {\n\n String sign = transactionType.equals(\"deposit\") || transactionType.equals(\"transfer_in\") ? \"+\" : \"-\";\n\n return timestamp.toString() + \" - \" + transactionType.toUpperCase() + \": \" + sign + \"$\" + amount;\n\n }\n\n // Getters and setters as needed\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis toString method will format the transaction details as shown earlier.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the database connection is properly closed when the program exits.\n\nI can achieve this by using try-with-resources in the DatabaseHandler class.\n\nHere's an updated version:\n\n```\n\nimport java.sql.*;\n\npublic class DatabaseHandler implements AutoCloseable {\n\n private Connection connection;\n\n public DatabaseHandler() {\n\n try {\n\n Class.forName(\"org.sqlite.JDBC\");\n\n connection = DriverManager.getConnection(\"jdbc:sqlite:banking.db\");\n\n } catch (ClassNotFoundException | SQLException e) {\n\n e.printStackTrace();\n\n }\n\n }\n\n @Override\n\n public void close() throws SQLException {\n\n if (connection != null) {\n\n connection.close();\n\n }\n\n }\n\n // Other methods as before...\n\n}\n\n```\n\nIn the main class, I can use try-with-resources to ensure that the DatabaseHandler is closed when the program exits.\n\nHere's an updated main method:\n\n```\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\n try (DatabaseHandler dbHandler = new DatabaseHandler()) {\n\n dbHandler.createTables();\n\n Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n while (true) {\n\n // Main menu and other methods as before...\n\n }\n\n } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n e.printStackTrace();\n\n }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis ensures that the database connection is closed properly.\n\nI need to make sure to handle any SQLExceptions that might be thrown when closing the connection.\n\nNow, I should test the program to ensure that all operations work as expected.\n\nI'll need to create accounts, log in, perform deposits, withdrawals, transfers, check balances, view transaction history, and log out.\n\nI should also test edge cases, such as trying to withdraw more than the balance, entering invalid account numbers, and so on.\n\nAdditionally, I should check that the database is updated correctly after each operation and that the transaction history is accurate.\n\nI might need to add more error handling and user feedback based on the testing results.\n\nOverall, this should cover the requirements for a basic banking system simulation in Java using SQLite.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a basic banking system in Java that uses a SQLite database to store account data and transaction history, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the SQLite Database\n\nFirst, set up the SQLite database with tables for accounts and transactions.\n\n#### SQL Statements:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE accounts (\n    account_number INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n    owner_name TEXT NOT NULL,\n    balance REAL NOT NULL,\n    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,\n    creation_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE transactions (\n    transaction_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n    account_number INTEGER,\n    transaction_type TEXT NOT NULL,\n    amount REAL NOT NULL,\n    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n    FOREIGN KEY (account_number) REFERENCES accounts(account_number)\n);\n```\n\n### Step 2: Add Dependencies\n\nEnsure you have the necessary dependencies in your `pom.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.xerial</groupId>\n        <artifactId>sqlite-jdbc</artifactId>\n        <version>3.36.0.3</version>\n    </dependency>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.mindrot</groupId>\n        <artifactId>jbcrypt</artifactId>\n        <version>0.4</version>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create the DatabaseHandler Class\n\nThis class handles all database
