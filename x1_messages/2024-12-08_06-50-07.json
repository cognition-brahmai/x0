Each plan will have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user question, one or more previous evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nWebSearch[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information using a web search engine. This tool is useful in finding an appropriate list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts text from websites provided as newline separated links. The input should be one or more links and it produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkParser[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nQAEngine[input]: Question answering model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe input to each function just needs to be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g. QAEngine[What is the capital of France, given :evidence3:?]\n\nEnsure to only include one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What are some notable achievements of the current president of Harvard University?"

        "content": "Alright, I need to find out about the notable achievements of the current president of Harvard University. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to know who the current president of Harvard is. I'm not sure who that is off the top of my head, so I should probably look that up. I can use the WebSearch tool for that. I'll search for \"current president of Harvard University.\"\n\nOnce I have the name, I can then look into their achievements. Maybe I can find some articles or official profiles that highlight their accomplishments while leading Harvard.\n\nSo, plan number one: use WebSearch to find out who the current president of Harvard is.\n\n:evidence0: = WebSearch[current president of Harvard University]\n\nAlright, let's assume that from :evidence0:, I get a list of search results, and from there, I can find the name of the president. Let's say the search results lead me to a Wikipedia page or the Harvard University official website where it lists the current president.\n\nNext step would be to gather information about this person's achievements. I can probably use the TextExtractor tool to get the text from relevant web pages. So, based on the links I get from :evidence0:, I can pick the most relevant ones, maybe the Harvard University president's official bio page or a notable article about their tenure.\n\nSo, plan number two: use LinkParser to extract links from the search results in :evidence0:, and then choose the most relevant ones for more detailed information.\n\n:evidence1: = LinkParser[:evidence0:]\n\nThen, use TextExtractor on those selected links to get the text content.\n\nPlan number three: use TextExtractor on the selected links from :evidence1:.\n\n:evidence2: = TextExtractor[selected links from :evidence1:]\n\nNow, with :evidence2:, which is the text content from those pages, I can look for information about the president's achievements. This might be straightforward if the text is well-organized, but it could be time-consuming to go through all the text manually.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the QAEngine tool to ask specific questions about the president's achievements based on the text in :evidence2:.\n\nSo, plan number four: use QAEngine to ask about the notable achievements of the president, referencing :evidence2:.\n\n:evidence3: = QAEngine[What are some notable achievements of the current Harvard University president, given :evidence2:?]\n\nThis should give me a summary or list of achievements based on the text provided.\n\nHowever, to make sure I have a comprehensive answer, I might want to cross-verify this information with other sources. So, perhaps I should repeat the process with another search or look for additional articles.\n\nPlan number five: perform another WebSearch to find more information about the president's achievements.\n\n:evidence4: = WebSearch[notable achievements of [president's name]]\n\nThen, parse the links from this search.\n\n:evidence5: = LinkParser[:evidence4:]\n\nExtract text from these links.\n\n:evidence6: = TextExtractor[selected links from :evidence5:]\n\nAnd finally, use QAEngine to summarize the achievements from this new set of text.\n\n:evidence7: = QAEngine[What are some notable achievements of [president's name], given :evidence6:?]\n\nNow, with :evidence3: and :evidence7:, I can compare the information and compile a more complete list of achievements.\n\nPlan number six: compile the information from :evidence3: and :evidence7: to create a final answer.\n\n:evidence8: = QAEngine[Combining the information from :evidence3: and :evidence7:, what are the key achievements of the current Harvard University president?]\n\nThis should give me a consolidated answer with the most important achievements.\n\nAlternatively, if time is a constraint, I could stick with the initial source and trust its accuracy, especially if it's the official Harvard University website.\n\nIn that case, :evidence3: might be sufficient.\n\nBut to ensure accuracy and provide a more robust answer, it's better to cross-reference multiple sources.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with the comprehensive approach.\n\nSo, the final answer would be :evidence8:.\n\n**Final Plan:**\n\nPlan: Use WebSearch to find out who the current president of Harvard University is.\n\n:evidence0: = WebSearch[current president of Harvard University]\n\nPlan: Parse the links from the search results.\n\n:evidence1: = LinkParser[:evidence0:]\n\nPlan: Extract text from the most relevant links.\n\n:evidence2: = TextExtractor[selected links from :evidence1:]\n\nPlan: Use QAEngine to identify notable achievements from :evidence2:.\n\n:evidence3: = QAEngine[What are some notable achievements of the current Harvard University president, given :evidence2:?]\n\nPlan: Perform another WebSearch for more information on the president's achievements.\n\n:evidence4: = WebSearch[notable achievements of [president's name]]\n\nPlan: Parse the links from this new search.\n\n:evidence5: = LinkParser[:evidence4:]\n\nPlan: Extract text from the selected links.\n\n:evidence6: = TextExtractor[selected links from :evidence5:]\n\nPlan: Use QAEngine to summarize achievements from the new text.\n\n:evidence7: = QAEngine[What are some notable achievements of [president's name], given :evidence6:?]\n\nPlan: Combine the information from :evidence3: and :evidence7: to create a final answer.\n\n:evidence8: = QAEngine[Combining the information from :evidence3: and :evidence7:, what are the key achievements of the current Harvard University president?]\n\nAnswer: :evidence8:"
