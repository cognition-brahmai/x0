        "content": "So the factory makes 500 units of product A in 8 hours, and we need to find out how long it will take to make 750 units. Hmm, this seems like a proportion problem. Let me think about it.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the rate at which the factory produces the units. So, if it produces 500 units in 8 hours, the rate is 500 units per 8 hours. I can calculate the units per hour by dividing 500 by 8. Let me do that:\n\n500 \u00f7 8 = 62.5 units per hour.\n\nSo, the factory produces 62.5 units each hour.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many hours it will take to produce 750 units at this rate. I can set up an equation where:\n\nunits = rate \u00d7 time\n\nSo, 750 = 62.5 \u00d7 time\n\nTo find the time, I can divide both sides by 62.5:\n\ntime = 750 \u00f7 62.5\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n750 \u00f7 62.5 = 12 hours.\n\nSo, it will take 12 hours to produce 750 units of product A.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way is to set up a proportion:\n\n500 units is to 8 hours as 750 units is to x hours.\n\nSo, 500/8 = 750/x\n\nNow, cross-multiplying:\n\n500x = 8 \u00d7 750\n\n500x = 6000\n\nNow, divide both sides by 500:\n\nx = 6000 \u00f7 500 = 12 hours.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, it definitely looks like 12 hours is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of scaling. If 500 units take 8 hours, then to find out how long 750 units take, I can find the scaling factor.\n\nThe scaling factor is 750 \u00f7 500 = 1.5.\n\nSo, if I multiply the time by 1.5, 8 hours \u00d7 1.5 = 12 hours.\n\nAgain, I get 12 hours.\n\nHmm, seems consistent across different methods. I think it's safe to conclude that it will take 12 hours to produce 750 units of product A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
