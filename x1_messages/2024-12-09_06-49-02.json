        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a village with 100 houses, numbered from 1 to 100. A postman starts at house number 1, then skips the next two houses, so he goes to house number 4. Then he skips the next three houses and goes to house number 8. This pattern continues, with the number of houses he skips increasing by one each time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the pattern of the houses he visits. Let's list out the sequence of houses he visits:\n\n- Start at house 1.\n\n- Skip the next two houses (2 and 3), so next is house 4.\n\n- Skip the next three houses (5, 6, 7), so next is house 8.\n\n- Skip the next four houses (9, 10, 11, 12), so next is house 13.\n\n- Skip the next five houses (14, 15, 16, 17, 18), so next is house 19.\n\n- And so on, until he can't skip the required number of houses anymore because he's reached the end of the village.\n\nSo, the sequence of houses he visits is: 1, 4, 8, 13, 19, ...\n\nI need to find a general formula for the house numbers he visits. Let's try to find a pattern or formula that describes the sequence.\n\nLooking at the differences between consecutive houses:\n\n- 4 - 1 = 3\n\n- 8 - 4 = 4\n\n- 13 - 8 = 5\n\n- 19 - 13 = 6\n\n- ...\n\nIt looks like the difference increases by 1 each time. So, the nth house he visits is given by the sum of the first n natural numbers starting from 3.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The number of houses skipped increases by one each time. So, the first time he skips 2 houses, then 3, then 4, and so on.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of houses skipped at each step as s_i, where s_i = i + 1 for i starting from 1.\n\nWait, actually, the first skip is 2 houses, which corresponds to s_1 = 2. Then s_2 = 3, s_3 = 4, and so on.\n\nSo, the positions of the houses he visits can be described by:\n\n- House 1 (starting point)\n\n- House 1 + (1 + s_1) = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4\n\n- House 4 + (1 + s_2) = 4 + 1 + 3 = 8\n\n- House 8 + (1 + s_3) = 8 + 1 + 4 = 13\n\n- House 13 + (1 + s_4) = 13 + 1 + 5 = 19\n\n- And so on.\n\nWait, this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to model this.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the cumulative number of houses skipped up to the nth step.\n\nThe total number of houses skipped after n steps is s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_n = 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + (n+1) = sum from k=2 to n+1 of k = [ (n+1)(n+2)/2 ) - 1 ]\n\nWait, sum from k=1 to n+1 of k is (n+1)(n+2)/2, so sum from k=2 to n+1 is (n+1)(n+2)/2 - 1.\n\nBut actually, the postman moves to the next house after skipping s_i houses each time.\n\nSo, the position after n steps is the starting position plus the sum of the steps taken, where each step is 1 (moving to the next house) plus the number of houses skipped.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the cumulative steps.\n\nLet\u2019s define the position p_n of the nth house visited as:\n\np_n = p_{n-1} + 1 + s_n\n\nWhere s_n = n + 1.\n\nSo, p_n = p_{n-1} + 1 + (n + 1) = p_{n-1} + n + 2\n\nWith p_1 = 1.\n\nThis is a recursive formula. Let's try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nWe can write:\n\np_n = 1 + sum_{k=2}^{n+1} k = 1 + [ (n+1)(n+2)/2 - 1 ] = (n+1)(n+2)/2\n\nWait, that seems off because p_1 should be 1, but according to this, p_1 = (1+1)(1+2)/2 = 3, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the summation.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nIf p_n = p_{n-1} + n + 1, with p_1 = 1.\n\nWait, perhaps s_n = n + 1, and the step is 1 + s_n = n + 2.\n\nSo, p_n = p_{n-1} + (n + 2)\n\nWith p_1 = 1.\n\nThen, p_n = 1 + sum_{k=2}^{n} (k + 1) = 1 + sum_{k=2}^{n} k + sum_{k=2}^{n} 1 = 1 + [ (n(n+1)/2) - 1 ] + (n - 1) = 1 + (n(n+1)/2 - 1) + (n - 1) = (n(n+1)/2) + n - 1\n\nSimplify: n(n+1)/2 + n - 1 = (n^2 + n + 2n - 2)/2 = (n^2 + 3n - 2)/2\n\nBut let's check for n=1: p_1 = (1 + 3 - 2)/2 = 2/2 = 1, which matches.\n\nFor n=2: p_2 = (4 + 6 - 2)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nFor n=3: p_3 = (9 + 9 - 2)/2 = 16/2 = 8, which matches.\n\nFor n=4: p_4 = (16 + 12 - 2)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches.\n\nGreat, so the general formula for the position of the nth house visited is p_n = (n^2 + 3n - 2)/2.\n\nNow, we need to find the largest n such that p_n <= 100.\n\nSo, solve (n^2 + 3n - 2)/2 <= 100\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: n^2 + 3n - 2 <= 200\n\nSo, n^2 + 3n - 202 <= 0\n\nSolve the quadratic inequality n^2 + 3n - 202 <= 0\n\nFirst, find the roots of n^2 + 3n - 202 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula: n = [-3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 808)]/2 = [-3 \u00b1 sqrt(817)]/2\n\n.Sqrt(817) is approximately 28.6, since 28^2 = 784 and 29^2 = 841.\n\nSo, n = [-3 + 28.6]/2 \u2248 25.6/2 \u2248 12.8\n\nAnd n = [-3 - 28.6]/2 \u2248 -31.6/2 \u2248 -15.8\n\nSince n must be a positive integer, the inequality n^2 + 3n - 202 <= 0 holds for n between approximately -15.8 and 12.8.\n\nBut n must be at least 1, so n can be from 1 to 12 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the postman visits n = 1 to 12 houses.\n\nLet's check p_12: (144 + 36 - 2)/2 = (178)/2 = 89\n\np_13: (169 + 39 - 2)/2 = (206)/2 = 103, which is beyond 100.\n\nSo, up to n=12, p_12=89, which is within 100, and n=13 is 103, which is beyond.\n\nTherefore, the postman visits 12 houses in total.\n\nWait, but p_12 = 89, and the next one is p_13 = 103, which is beyond 100. So, yes, he visits up to house 89, and cannot go to the next one because it's beyond 100.\n\nTherefore, the total number of houses he visits is 12.\n\nBut let's make sure there are no overlaps or missing houses.\n\nLooking back at the sequence: 1, 4, 8, 13, 19, 26, 34, 43, 53, 64, 76, 89.\n\nThese are all unique and within 1 to 100, and the next one would be 103, which is beyond.\n\nSo, indeed, he visits 12 houses in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
