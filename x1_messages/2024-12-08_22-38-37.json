        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about a train's journey. It travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, makes a stop for 30 minutes, and then continues for another 120 miles. The entire trip takes 4 hours, and I need to find out how far the train traveled before making the stop.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the different parts of the trip:\n\n1. The train travels at 60 mph for some distance before stopping.\n\n2. It stops for 30 minutes.\n\n3. After the stop, it travels another 120 miles at the same speed of 60 mph.\n\nThe total time for the entire trip is 4 hours.\n\nI need to find the distance traveled in the first part of the trip, before the stop.\n\nLet me denote the distance traveled before the stop as \"d\" miles.\n\nNow, time is equal to distance divided by speed.\n\nSo, the time taken for the first part of the trip is d miles divided by 60 mph.\n\nThe stop lasts for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours.\n\nThe time taken for the second part of the trip is 120 miles divided by 60 mph.\n\nSo, the total time is the sum of these three parts, and it equals 4 hours.\n\nLet me write that as an equation:\n\n(time for first part) + (stop time) + (time for second part) = total time\n\nSo,\n\n(d / 60) + 0.5 + (120 / 60) = 4\n\nNow, I can solve for d.\n\nFirst, calculate 120 / 60, which is 2 hours.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n(d / 60) + 0.5 + 2 = 4\n\nCombine the constants: 0.5 + 2 = 2.5\n\nSo,\n\n(d / 60) + 2.5 = 4\n\nNow, subtract 2.5 from both sides:\n\nd / 60 = 1.5\n\nThen, multiply both sides by 60 to solve for d:\n\nd = 1.5 * 60\n\nd = 90 miles\n\nSo, the train traveled 90 miles before making the stop.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nIf d = 90 miles, at 60 mph, the time is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.\n\nStop time is 0.5 hours.\n\nSecond part is 120 miles at 60 mph, which is 2 hours.\n\nTotal time: 1.5 + 0.5 + 2 = 4 hours, which matches the given total time.\n\nSo, the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]"
