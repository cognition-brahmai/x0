        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a school with 800 students in total. Out of these, 60% are enrolled in a sports program. First, I need to find out how many students that is.\n\nTo find 60% of 800, I can calculate it as follows:\n\n60% of 800 = (60/100) * 800 = 0.6 * 800 = 480 students.\n\nSo, 480 students are enrolled in the sports program.\n\nNow, among these 480 students who participate in sports, 30% also take part in a music program. I need to find out how many that is.\n\nTo find 30% of 480, I can calculate:\n\n30% of 480 = (30/100) * 480 = 0.3 * 480 = 144 students.\n\nTherefore, 144 students are involved in both sports and music programs.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I've understood the problem correctly. The question is asking for the number of students involved in both sports and music programs. According to the information given:\n\n- Total students: 800\n\n- Percentage enrolled in sports: 60%\n\n- Among sports participants, percentage also in music: 30%\n\nI think I've got it right. I first found the number of students enrolled in sports, which is 480, and then found 30% of those to find who are also in music, which is 144.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any overlap or other factors mentioned in the problem. The problem seems straightforward: it's only about students enrolled in both sports and music, and it's given directly as percentages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of sets. Let\u2019s denote:\n\n- Total students: 800\n\n- Students in sports (S): 60% of 800 = 480\n\n- Students in both sports and music (S \u2229 M): 30% of S = 30% of 480 = 144\n\nSo, using set notation, the number of students in both sports and music is indeed 144.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the percentage of the total student body that is involved in both programs. But since the 30% is of the sports participants, not the total student body, it's important to do it in two steps as I did initially.\n\nI should also confirm if there's any other information implied or if there\u2019s a need to consider students who might be in music but not in sports. However, the question specifically asks for students involved in both sports and music programs, so focusing on the sports participants who also do music is correct.\n\nLet me also ensure that I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting with 800 students:\n\n- 60% of 800 is 480 (sports participants).\n\n- 30% of 480 is 144 (both sports and music).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to, I could calculate the percentage of the total student body that is involved in both programs. That would be:\n\n(144 / 800) * 100% = 18%.\n\nSo, 18% of the total students are involved in both sports and music programs. But again, the question is directly asking for the number, which is 144.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be 144 students involved in both sports and music programs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{144} \\]"
