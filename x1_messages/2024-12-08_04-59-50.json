        "content": "So I have this problem here. A car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for 12 hours straight. I need to find out how many times its wheels will rotate if each wheel has a diameter of 2 feet. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how far the car travels in total. It's going at 60 miles per hour for 12 hours, so the total distance should be speed multiplied by time. So, 60 miles per hour times 12 hours equals 720 miles. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, I need to relate that distance to the rotation of the wheels. Each rotation of the wheel covers a certain distance, which is the circumference of the wheel. The circumference of a circle is given by pi times the diameter. The diameter is 2 feet, so the circumference is pi times 2, which is approximately 3.1416 times 2, equaling about 6.2832 feet.\n\nWait, but the total distance is in miles, and the circumference is in feet. I need to make sure the units match. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so the total distance in feet is 720 miles times 5280 feet per mile. Let me calculate that: 720 times 5280. 700 times 5280 is 3,696,000, and 20 times 5280 is 105,600, so total is 3,696,000 plus 105,600 equals 3,801,600 feet.\n\nNow, to find out how many rotations the wheels make, I need to divide the total distance by the circumference of the wheel. So, 3,801,600 feet divided by approximately 6.2832 feet per rotation.\n\nLet me do that division. First, I can simplify it by dividing 3,801,600 by 6.2832. Alternatively, since pi is approximately 3.1416, and the diameter is 2, circumference is 2*pi, which is 6.2832. So, number of rotations is total distance divided by circumference.\n\nLet me calculate 3,801,600 divided by 6.2832. Hmm, that might be a bit tedious manually, but I can simplify it. Maybe I can divide both numerator and denominator by 2 to make it easier. Wait, no, that won't help directly.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate it step by step. Let's see, 6.2832 multiplied by what number equals 3,801,600.\n\nWell, perhaps I can first divide 3,801,600 by 6.2832. Let me try moving the decimal places to make it easier. If I multiply both numerator and denominator by 10,000, I get 3,801,600 times 10,000 divided by 6.2832 times 10,000, which is 38,016,000,000 divided by 62,832.\n\nHmm, that seems even more complicated. Maybe I should use a calculator for this part.\n\nAssuming I had a calculator, I would enter 3,801,600 divided by 6.2832. Let's see, 6.2832 times 600,000 is 3,769,920, which is less than 3,801,600. The difference is 31,680.\n\nThen, 6.2832 times 5,040 is approximately 31,680. So, 605,040 rotations.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem precise. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the exact value of pi, which is 3.1416, but perhaps using fractions would help. Pi is approximately 22/7, so circumference is 2*(22/7) = 44/7 feet.\n\nThen, number of rotations is total distance divided by circumference, which is 3,801,600 divided by 44/7, which is 3,801,600 multiplied by 7/44.\n\nLet me calculate that: 3,801,600 times 7 is 26,611,200, divided by 44.\n\nNow, 44 times 600,000 is 26,400,000, which is less than 26,611,200. The difference is 211,200.\n\n44 times 4,800 is 207,360, which is less than 211,200 by 3,840.\n\n44 times 87 is approximately 3,828, which is more than 3,840.\n\nWait, this is getting too messy. Maybe I should stick to decimal calculations.\n\nLet me try dividing 3,801,600 by 6.2832.\n\nFirst, 6.2832 times 600,000 is 3,769,920.\n\nSubtract that from 3,801,600, which leaves 31,680.\n\nNow, 6.2832 times 5,040 is approximately 31,680.\n\nSo, total rotations is approximately 605,040.\n\nBut I feel like there's a simpler way to approach this.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can cancel out some units earlier on.\n\nLet me start again.\n\nFirst, total distance is speed times time: 60 miles per hour times 12 hours equals 720 miles.\n\nNow, convert miles to feet: 720 miles times 5,280 feet per mile equals 3,801,600 feet.\n\nCircumference of the wheel is pi times diameter: 3.1416 times 2 feet equals approximately 6.2832 feet.\n\nNumber of rotations is total distance divided by circumference: 3,801,600 feet divided by 6.2832 feet per rotation.\n\nNow, to make this division easier, I can divide both numerator and denominator by 0.0048 feet, but that doesn't help much.\n\nAlternatively, I can recognize that 6.2832 is approximately 2*pi, so number of rotations is distance divided by 2*pi.\n\nBut I still need to compute that value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula that relates linear distance to angular rotation, but I think I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me just proceed with the division: 3,801,600 divided by 6.2832.\n\nLet me move the decimal points to make it easier: multiply both by 10,000 to get 38,016,000,000 divided by 62,832.\n\nNow, divide 38,016,000,000 by 62,832.\n\nLet me see, 62,832 times 600,000 is 37,699,200,000.\n\nSubtract that from 38,016,000,000 to get 316,800,000.\n\nNow, 62,832 times 5,040 is approximately 316,800,000.\n\nSo, total rotations is approximately 605,040.\n\nBut to be more precise, let's check the multiplication: 62,832 times 5,040 is 62,832 times 5,000 plus 62,832 times 40.\n\n62,832 times 5,000 is 314,160,000.\n\n62,832 times 40 is 2,513,280.\n\nAdd them up: 314,160,000 plus 2,513,280 equals 316,673,280.\n\nSubtract that from 316,800,000 to get 126,720.\n\nNow, 62,832 times 2 is 125,664.\n\nSubtract that from 126,720 to get 1,056.\n\n62,832 times 0.016 is approximately 1,005.\n\nSo, approximately, total rotations is 605,040 plus a little bit more.\n\nBut for practical purposes, we can round it to 605,040 rotations.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the exact value of pi, which is 3.1416, the calculation might be more accurate.\n\nBut I think 605,040 is a reasonable approximation.\n\nSo, the wheels will rotate approximately 605,040 times during the 12-hour trip.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{604800} \\]"
