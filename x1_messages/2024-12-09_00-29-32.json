        "content": "So I have this problem here. It says that in a town, 60% of the people are adults, and 40% are children. There are 1200 adults in the town, and I need to find out how many children there are.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I know that 60% of the town's population are adults, and that equals 1200 people. I need to find the number of children, which is 40% of the population.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to find the total population of the town first. If 60% of the population is 1200 adults, I can set up an equation to find the total population.\n\nLet's denote the total population as P. Then, 60% of P is equal to 1200.\n\nSo, 0.60 * P = 1200.\n\nTo find P, I can divide both sides of the equation by 0.60.\n\nP = 1200 / 0.60.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n1200 divided by 0.60 is 2000.\n\nSo, the total population of the town is 2000 people.\n\nNow, since 40% of the population are children, I can find the number of children by calculating 40% of 2000.\n\nThat is, 0.40 * 2000 = 800.\n\nTherefore, there are 800 children in the town.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIf the total population is 2000, and 60% are adults (1200), then indeed 40% should be children (800). That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of ratios.\n\nThe ratio of adults to the total population is 60:100, which simplifies to 3:5.\n\nSimilarly, the ratio of children to the total population is 40:100, which simplifies to 2:5.\n\nGiven that there are 1200 adults, which corresponds to 3 parts in the ratio, I can find the value of one part and then find the number of children.\n\nSo, 3 parts = 1200 adults.\n\nTherefore, one part = 1200 / 3 = 400.\n\nThen, children are 2 parts = 2 * 400 = 800.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use proportions.\n\nIf 60% corresponds to 1200 adults, then 40% corresponds to x children.\n\nSo, 60% / 40% = 1200 / x.\n\nWait, actually, that might not be the best way to set it up.\n\nAlternatively, I can set up a proportion based on the percentage of the population.\n\n60% corresponds to 1200 adults, so 40% corresponds to x children.\n\nTherefore, x = (40% / 60%) * 1200.\n\nThat simplifies to x = (2/3) * 1200 = 800.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nSo, the town has 800 children.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{800} \\]"
