        "content": "Sure, I'll help you classify those sports into team sports and individual sports.\n\nFirst, let's look at the team sports:\n\n1. Basketball: This is definitely a team sport. It's played with two teams of five players each, and the objective is to score points by shooting a ball through a hoop.\n\n2. Soccer: Another clear team sport. It's played between two teams of eleven players, and the goal is to score by getting the ball into the opponent's goal.\n\n3. Volleyball: This is also a team sport, typically played with two teams of six players each. The aim is to send the ball over the net in such a way that the opponent team cannot return it properly.\n\n4. Baseball: This is a team sport as well, played between two teams, usually consisting of nine players each. The objective is to score runs by hitting a ball with a bat and running around four bases.\n\nNow, for the individual sports:\n\n1. Tennis: While there is such a thing as doubles in tennis, the primary and most common form is singles, where one player plays against another. So, I would classify tennis as an individual sport.\n\n2. Swimming: Swimmers compete individually against other swimmers, each in their own lane. So, this is an individual sport.\n\n3. Golf: Golf is typically played individually, with players competing against each other's scores. So, it's an individual sport.\n\n4. Gymnastics: Gymnasts perform individually, although there are team scores in competitions. However, the core of gymnastics is individual performance, so I would classify it as an individual sport.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nTeam sports: basketball, soccer, volleyball, baseball\n\nIndividual sports: tennis, swimming, golf, gymnastics\n\nI hope that helps!"
