        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have John, his sister Mary, and their friend Paul, and we need to figure out how many books they read in a year collectively.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how many books each person reads per month and then calculate that over a year.\n\nStarting with John: he reads 2 books per month.\n\nMary reads twice as many books as John. So, if John reads 2 books a month, Mary reads 2 times that, which is 4 books per month.\n\nPaul reads 3 books less than Mary. Since Mary reads 4 books a month, Paul reads 4 minus 3, which is 1 book per month.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many books each of them reads in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:\n\n- John reads 2 books per month, so in a year, he reads 2 books/month times 12 months, which equals 24 books.\n\n- Mary reads 4 books per month, so in a year, she reads 4 books/month times 12 months, which equals 48 books.\n\n- Paul reads 1 book per month, so in a year, he reads 1 book/month times 12 months, which equals 12 books.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of books they read in a year, I'll add up their individual totals:\n\n24 (John) + 48 (Mary) + 12 (Paul) = 84 books.\n\nSo, together, they read 84 books in a year.\n\n**Summary of steps:**\n\n1. Determine the number of books each person reads per month.\n   - John: 2 books/month\n   - Mary: 2 * John = 4 books/month\n   - Paul: Mary - 3 = 1 book/month\n\n2. Calculate the annual reading for each person.\n   - John: 2 books/month * 12 months = 24 books/year\n   - Mary: 4 books/month * 12 months = 48 books/year\n   - Paul: 1 book/month * 12 months = 12 books/year\n\n3. Add up the annual readings.\n   - Total: 24 + 48 + 12 = 84 books/year\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{84} \\]"
