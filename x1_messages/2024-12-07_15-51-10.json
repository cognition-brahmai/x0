        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train traveling between two cities that are 240 miles apart. It takes 3 hours to go from City A to City B and 4 hours to return from City B to City A. We need to find the average speed of the train for the entire trip.\n\nFirst, I remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, I need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.\n\nThe distance from City A to City B is 240 miles, and the return trip is also 240 miles. So, the total distance is 240 + 240 = 480 miles.\n\nNow, the time taken to go from City A to City B is 3 hours, and the time to return is 4 hours. So, the total time is 3 + 4 = 7 hours.\n\nSo, the average speed should be total distance divided by total time, which is 480 miles divided by 7 hours. Let me calculate that: 480 \u00f7 7 is approximately 68.57 miles per hour.\n\nBut wait, I recall that average speed can sometimes be tricky, especially when the speeds for the outbound and return trips are different. Maybe I should check another way.\n\nLet me calculate the speed for each leg of the trip. From City A to City B, the train covers 240 miles in 3 hours, so the speed is 240 \u00f7 3 = 80 miles per hour.\n\nOn the return trip, from City B to City A, it covers 240 miles in 4 hours, so the speed is 240 \u00f7 4 = 60 miles per hour.\n\nNow, to find the average speed for the entire trip, I could take the harmonic mean of these two speeds, since we're dealing with rates and times.\n\nThe formula for the harmonic mean of two speeds is: 2 * (speed1 * speed2) / (speed1 + speed2).\n\nSo, plugging in the values: 2 * (80 * 60) / (80 + 60) = 2 * 4800 / 140 = 9600 / 140 = 68.57 miles per hour.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the average speed is approximately 68.57 miles per hour.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to look at this. Suppose the train travels at different speeds for each leg; does averaging the speeds make sense?\n\nWell, average speed is indeed total distance over total time, so my initial approach should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the average of the two speeds, that would be (80 + 60) / 2 = 70 miles per hour. But that's not the same as 68.57. Why is that?\n\nAh, because the times are different for each leg, the average speed isn't simply the arithmetic mean of the two speeds. It's weighted by the time spent at each speed. Since the return trip takes longer, it has more weight in the average.\n\nSo, the harmonic mean is the appropriate way to average rates when the distances are the same but the times are different.\n\nTherefore, the correct average speed is approximately 68.57 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, the problem might be expecting the answer in miles per hour, but maybe it wants it as a fraction.\n\nLet me express 480 divided by 7 as a fraction: 480/7 miles per hour.\n\nThat's approximately 68.57142857... miles per hour, which can be left as a fraction or rounded depending on the context.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify, I'll leave it as 480/7 miles per hour.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to express it as a decimal, it's approximately 68.57 miles per hour.\n\nBut to be precise, 480 divided by 7 is exactly 68 and 4/7 miles per hour, since 7*68 = 476, and 480 - 476 = 4, so 4/7.\n\nSo, 68 and 4/7 miles per hour.\n\nI think that's as exact as I can get.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal distance: 240 miles each way, so 480 miles.\n\nTotal time: 3 hours plus 4 hours, which is 7 hours.\n\nAverage speed: 480 miles / 7 hours = 68.5714... miles per hour.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the harmonic mean formula: 2 * (80 * 60) / (80 + 60) = 2 * 4800 / 140 = 9600 / 140 = 68.5714... miles per hour.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the average speed for the entire trip is 480/7 miles per hour, or approximately 68.57 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{480}{7} \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]"
