        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. To create a basic command-line calculator in Golang that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, we'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up the Go environment:** Make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).\n\n2. **Create a new Go file:** Let's name it `calculator.go`.\n\n3. **Write the code:** We'll need to handle command-line arguments, parse them into numbers, perform the specified operation, and print the result.\n\n4. **Test the calculator:** Run the program with different operations to ensure it works correctly.\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n#### 1. Set Up the Go Environment\n\nEnsure Go is installed and set up properly. You can verify this by running:\n\n```sh\ngo version\n```\n\nThis should display the installed Go version.\n\n#### 2. Create a New Go File\n\nCreate a file named `calculator.go`:\n\n```sh\ntouch calculator.go\n```\n\n#### 3. Write the Code\n\nOpen `calculator.go` in your preferred text editor and add the following code:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"strconv\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tif len(os.Args) != 4 {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Usage: calculator.go operand1 operator operand2\")\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\toperand1, err := strconv.ParseFloat(os.Args[1], 64)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error: Invalid operand1\")\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\toperator := os.Args[2]\n\n\toperand2, err := strconv.ParseFloat(os.Args[3], 64)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error: Invalid operand2\")\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\tvar result float64\n\n\tswitch operator {\n\tcase \"+\":\n\t\tresult = operand1 + operand2\n\tcase \"-\":\n\t\tresult = operand1 - operand2\n\tcase \"*\":\n\t\tresult = operand1 * operand2\n\tcase \"/\":\n\t\tif operand2 == 0 {\n\t\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error: Division by zero\")\n\t\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t\t}\n\t\tresult = operand1 / operand2\n\tdefault:\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error: Invalid operator. Supported operators are +, -, *, /\")\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Result: %.2f\\n\", result)\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Test the Calculator\n\nSave the file and build the executable:\n\n```sh\ngo build calculator.go\n```\n\nThis will create an executable named `calculator` (or `calculator.exe` on Windows). You can now run it with different operations:\n\n- Addition:\n\n  ```sh\n  ./calculator 5 + 3\n  ```\n\n  Output:\n\n  ```\n  Result: 8.00\n  ```\n\n- Subtraction:\n\n  ```sh\n  ./calculator 10 - 4\n  ```\n\n  Output:\n\n  ```\n  Result: 6.00\n  ```\n\n- Multiplication:\n\n  ```sh\n  ./calculator 6 * 7\n  ```\n\n  Output:\n\n  ```\n  Result: 42.00\n  ```\n\n- Division:\n\n  ```sh\n  ./calculator 8 / 2\n  ```\n\n  Output:\n\n  ```\n  Result: 4.00\n  ```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Command-Line Arguments:** The program expects three arguments: two operands and one operator.\n- **Parsing Arguments:** We use `strconv.ParseFloat` to convert string arguments to floating-point numbers.\n- **Switch Statement:** Based on the operator, we perform the corresponding arithmetic operation.\n- **Error Handling:** We handle cases where the number of arguments is incorrect, operands are not valid numbers, or division by zero is attempted.\n\nThis simple calculator can be extended further to support more operations or handle more complex expressions, but this should give you a good starting point."
