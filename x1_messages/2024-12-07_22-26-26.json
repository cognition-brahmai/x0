        "content": "So there are 25 students in the class, and each has a different number of pencils, ranging from 1 to 25. So that means one student has 1 pencil, another has 2, and so on, up to 25 pencils.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that a randomly selected student has more than 20 pencils.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many students have more than 20 pencils. The numbers above 20 in that range are 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25. So, that's 5 students.\n\nTotal number of students is 25, and the number of students with more than 20 pencils is 5.\n\nProbability is usually calculated as the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, in this case, it should be 5 (students with more than 20 pencils) divided by 25 (total students).\n\nThat simplifies to 1/5, which is 0.2, or 20%.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe I should consider if the distribution is uniform, but since each student has a different number of pencils from 1 to 25, it is uniformly distributed.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as there are 25 possible numbers of pencils, and 5 of them are greater than 20.\n\nSo, again, 5/25 = 1/5 = 20%.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nIs there any chance that some students could have the same number of pencils? The problem says each student has a different number, so no.\n\nAre there any students who have no pencils? No, because the range starts at 1.\n\nSo, no, that seems straightforward.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list the numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25.\n\nNumbers greater than 20 are 21,22,23,24,25 \u2013 that's 5 numbers.\n\nSo, again, 5 out of 25.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.2} \\]"
