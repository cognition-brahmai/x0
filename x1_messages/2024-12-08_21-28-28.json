        "content": "Let's see. So, the store offers a discount, and the final price after the discount is 75% of the original price. That means the customer pays 75% of what the original price was. And we're told that this discounted price is $45. I need to find out what the original price was.\n\nHmm, percentage problems can sometimes tricky, but let's break it down step by step. So, if the final price is 75% of the original price, that means:\n\nFinal Price = 75% of Original Price\n\nWe know the final price is $45, so:\n\n$45 = 75% of Original Price\n\nNow, I need to find the original price. Let's denote the original price as \"O\". So, the equation becomes:\n\n$45 = 75% * O\n\nFirst, I should convert the percentage into a decimal to make the calculation easier. 75% is the same as 0.75 in decimal form. So, the equation is:\n\n$45 = 0.75 * O\n\nNow, to find O, I need to isolate it on one side of the equation. I can do that by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75. So:\n\nO = $45 / 0.75\n\nLet me do that division. 45 divided by 0.75. Well, 0.75 is the same as 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So:\n\nO = $45 * (4/3)\n\nLet's calculate that. 45 times 4 is 180, and 180 divided by 3 is 60. So, O = $60.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let's check. If the original price was $60 and the discount brings it down to 75% of that, then:\n\nFinal Price = 75% of $60 = 0.75 * $60 = $45\n\nYes, that matches the given information. So, the original price was $60.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of proportions. If 75% corresponds to $45, then 100% (the original price) would be what? I can set up a proportion:\n\n75% / $45 = 100% / O\n\nSo, O = (100% * $45) / 75%\n\nO = ($4500) / 75\n\nO = $60\n\nAgain, that confirms that the original price was $60.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to realize that 75% is three-quarters of the original price. So, if three-quarters is $45, then one-quarter is $15 (since 45 divided by 3 is 15). Therefore, the full price (four-quarters) would be $15 * 4 = $60.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same conclusion that the original price was $60.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe using algebra. Let's denote the original price as O again. The discount is such that the customer pays 75% of O, which equals $45.\n\nSo, 0.75O = $45\n\nTo find O, divide both sides by 0.75:\n\nO = $45 / 0.75 = $60\n\nSame answer again.\n\nI think it's clear that the original price was $60. The different methods all confirm this result, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
