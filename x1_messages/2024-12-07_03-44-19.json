        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a box containing red and blue balls. The problem states that there are 3 times as many red balls as blue balls. And if we pick two balls at random without putting them back, the probability that both are red is 1/2. We need to find out how many blue balls are in the box.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let\u2019s say the number of blue balls is B. Since there are 3 times as many red balls as blue balls, the number of red balls would be 3B.\n\nNow, the total number of balls in the box is the sum of the red and blue balls, which is B + 3B = 4B.\n\nNext, we need to find the probability of picking two red balls without replacement. The probability of an event is given by the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nWhen we pick the first ball, the probability that it\u2019s red is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. So, that\u2019s 3B / 4B, which simplifies to 3/4.\n\nNow, since we\u2019re not replacing the first ball, the total number of balls decreases by one for the second pick. So, the total number of balls left is 4B - 1.\n\nSimilarly, if the first ball was red, there are now 3B - 1 red balls left.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the second ball is also red, given that the first one was red, is (3B - 1) / (4B - 1).\n\nTo find the overall probability of both events happening (both picks being red), we multiply the probabilities of each event:\n\nProbability = (3B / 4B) * ((3B - 1) / (4B - 1))\n\nSimplifying the first fraction, 3B / 4B, the B's cancel out, so we have 3/4.\n\nSo, the probability becomes:\n\nProbability = (3/4) * ((3B - 1) / (4B - 1))\n\nNow, according to the problem, this probability is equal to 1/2.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n(3/4) * ((3B - 1) / (4B - 1)) = 1/2\n\nOur goal is to solve for B, the number of blue balls.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the left side of the equation.\n\nMultiply 3/4 by (3B - 1)/(4B - 1):\n\n(3(3B - 1)) / (4(4B - 1)) = 1/2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(9B - 3) / (16B - 4) = 1/2\n\nNow, to solve for B, we can cross-multiply:\n\n(9B - 3) * 2 = (16B - 4) * 1\n\nSo:\n\n18B - 6 = 16B - 4\n\nNow, let's get all the B terms on one side and the constants on the other.\n\nSubtract 16B from both sides:\n\n18B - 16B - 6 = -4\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2B - 6 = -4\n\nNow, add 6 to both sides:\n\n2B = 2\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 2:\n\nB = 1\n\nSo, according to this, there is 1 blue ball in the box.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's double-check this because it seems a bit suspicious. If there is only 1 blue ball, then there are 3 red balls, for a total of 4 balls.\n\nThe probability of picking two red balls without replacement would be:\n\nFirst pick: 3/4\n\nSecond pick: 2/3 (since one red ball is already picked, leaving 2 red balls out of 3 total balls)\n\nSo, the probability is (3/4) * (2/3) = 1/2, which matches the given probability.\n\nHmm, seems correct.\n\nBut let's consider if there could be more blue balls. Maybe there's more than one solution.\n\nSuppose B = 2.\n\nThen, red balls = 6, total balls = 8.\n\nProbability of picking two red balls:\n\nFirst pick: 6/8 = 3/4\n\nSecond pick: 5/7\n\nSo, overall probability: (3/4) * (5/7) = 15/28, which is less than 1/2.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier calculation, B = 1 is the only solution.\n\nBut let's see if B = 0 is possible. If B = 0, then red balls = 0, which doesn't make sense because we can't have zero balls and pick two balls from nothing.\n\nSo, B = 1 seems to be the only valid solution.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"balls,\" which implies there are multiple balls. With B = 1, total balls are 4, which seems plausible.\n\nLet me check if B = 1 satisfies the original equation.\n\nGiven B = 1,\n\nNumber of red balls = 3*1 = 3\n\nTotal balls = 4\n\nProbability of picking two red balls:\n\n(3/4) * (2/3) = 1/2\n\nWhich matches the given probability.\n\nIf B = 2,\n\nRed balls = 6\n\nTotal balls = 8\n\nProbability:\n\n(6/8) * (5/7) = 30/56 = 15/28, which is less than 1/2.\n\nIf B = 0.5, but since we can't have half a ball, B must be an integer.\n\nTherefore, B = 1 is the only integer solution that satisfies the given conditions.\n\nSo, the number of blue balls in the box is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
