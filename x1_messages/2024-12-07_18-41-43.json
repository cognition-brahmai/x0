        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about two trains moving towards each other from different towns. Town A and Town B are 450 miles apart. One train leaves Town A going towards Town B at 60 miles per hour, and the other train leaves Town B going towards Town A at 90 miles per hour. I need to find out how far apart they will be one hour before they meet.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand the situation. There are two trains moving towards each other, so their speeds will add up when calculating how quickly they're closing the distance between them.\n\nSo, the speed of the train from Town A is 60 mph, and the speed of the train from Town B is 90 mph. Together, they're approaching each other at a combined speed of 60 + 90 = 150 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the total distance between the two towns is 450 miles. I need to find out how far apart they are one hour before they meet.\n\nHmm, maybe I can first find out the total time it takes for them to meet.\n\nIf they're closing the distance at 150 miles per hour and the initial distance is 450 miles, then the time it takes for them to meet is distance divided by relative speed, which is 450 miles divided by 150 mph.\n\nSo, 450 \u00f7 150 = 3 hours. So, they will meet after 3 hours.\n\nNow, I need to find out how far apart they are one hour before they meet. That means I need to find the distance between them at t = 2 hours, since they meet at t = 3 hours.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to think about it.\n\nLet me consider what happens in the last hour before they meet.\n\nIn the last hour, both trains continue to move towards each other at their respective speeds. So, in that one hour, the train from Town A will cover 60 miles (since it's going at 60 mph), and the train from Town B will cover 90 miles (since it's going at 90 mph).\n\nTherefore, in that one hour, the total distance they cover together is 60 + 90 = 150 miles.\n\nWait a minute, that sounds familiar. So, one hour before they meet, they are 150 miles apart.\n\nIs that it? It seems almost too straightforward.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIf they are 150 miles apart one hour before they meet, and in that hour, they cover 150 miles together, then yes, they would meet exactly at the end of that hour.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about it in terms of time:\n\nTotal time to meet is 3 hours, as calculated earlier.\n\nOne hour before they meet would be at t = 2 hours.\n\nIn 2 hours, the train from Town A would have traveled 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nThe train from Town B would have traveled 90 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 180 miles.\n\nSo, the total distance they have covered together in 2 hours is 120 + 180 = 300 miles.\n\nThe initial distance was 450 miles, so the remaining distance at t = 2 hours is 450 - 300 = 150 miles.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier conclusion.\n\nSo, one hour before they meet, they are 150 miles apart.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the distance apart one hour before they meet, and according to this, it's 150 miles.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nMaybe considering their positions at different times.\n\nAt t = 0:\n\nDistance = 450 miles.\n\nAt t = 1 hour:\n\nTrain A has traveled 60 miles, Train B has traveled 90 miles.\n\nTotal distance covered together: 60 + 90 = 150 miles.\n\nSo, remaining distance: 450 - 150 = 300 miles.\n\nAt t = 2 hours:\n\nTrain A: 120 miles, Train B: 180 miles.\n\nTotal covered: 300 miles.\n\nRemaining: 450 - 300 = 150 miles.\n\nAt t = 3 hours:\n\nTrain A: 180 miles, Train B: 270 miles.\n\nTotal covered: 450 miles.\n\nRemaining: 0 miles. They meet.\n\nSo, indeed, one hour before they meet, they are 150 miles apart.\n\nAlternatively, since their relative speed is 150 mph, the distance decreases by 150 miles every hour.\n\nTherefore, one hour before meeting, they are exactly 150 miles apart.\n\nThis seems consistent across different approaches, so I think the answer is 150 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
