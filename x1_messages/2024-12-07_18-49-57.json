        "content": "So I've got this question about the difference between the Baroque and Classical periods in music. Let me see if I can wrap my head around this. First off, I know that the Baroque period was from around 1600 to 1750, and that's when composers like Bach and Vivaldi were active. Then, the Classical period followed, with composers like Mozart and Haydn. The question is asking which statement best describes the primary difference between these two periods.\n\nOption A says that the Baroque period focused on polyphonic texture, while the Classical period emphasized monophonic texture. Now, polyphonic means that there are multiple independent melodic lines happening at the same time, like in a fugue by Bach. Monophonic would mean a single melodic line, maybe with accompaniment. I think that's partially correct because the Baroque period did have a lot of polyphonic music, but the Classical period also had its share of polyphonic works. So, maybe that's not the best answer.\n\nOption B claims that the Classical period saw the establishment of major and minor keys, something not present in the Baroque period. Hmm, I know that the system of major and minor keys, also known as tonal harmony, was actually developed during the Baroque period. Composers like Bach used major and minor keys extensively. So, this statement seems incorrect because major and minor keys were already established in the Baroque period.\n\nOption C says that the Baroque period was characterized by complexity and ornamentation, while the Classical period emphasized clarity and balance. That sounds familiar. I've read that Baroque music often had intricate melodies and lots of ornamentation, like trills and turns. In contrast, Classical music is known for its cleaner, more balanced phrases and clearer structure, like the sonata form. This seems like a good candidate for the primary difference.\n\nOption D states that the Classical period was dominated by the use of the harpsichord, while the Baroque period saw the rise of the piano. Actually, that's the other way around, isn't it? The harpsichord was a prominent instrument in the Baroque period, and the piano started to become more common in the Classical period. So, this statement is incorrect.\n\nBased on this, it seems like option C is the best answer. The Baroque period was known for its complexity and ornamentation, while the Classical period emphasized clarity and balance in musical composition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
