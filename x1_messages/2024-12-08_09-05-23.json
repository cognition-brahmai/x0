        "content": "Albert Einstein famously said, \"Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.\" This quote underscores the profound role that imagination plays in human cognition and creativity, suggesting that it is a powerful tool for exploration and innovation beyond the confines of current understanding."
