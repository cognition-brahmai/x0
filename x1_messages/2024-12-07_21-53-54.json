        "content": "Let's see. I have this election problem here. Candidate A got 60% of the votes, and Candidate B got 40%, with a total of 12,000 votes cast. I need to find out how many more votes Candidate A received compared to Candidate B.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how many votes each candidate received. Since Candidate A had 60% of the votes, I can calculate that by taking 60% of 12,000. Similarly, Candidate B had 40% of the votes, so that's 40% of 12,000.\n\nLet me start by calculating Candidate A's votes:\n\n60% of 12,000 is (60/100) * 12,000.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n60 divided by 100 is 0.6.\n\n0.6 multiplied by 12,000 is 7,200.\n\nSo, Candidate A received 7,200 votes.\n\nNow, for Candidate B:\n\n40% of 12,000 is (40/100) * 12,000.\n\n40 divided by 100 is 0.4.\n\n0.4 multiplied by 12,000 is 4,800.\n\nSo, Candidate B received 4,800 votes.\n\nNow, to find out how many more votes Candidate A received than Candidate B, I need to subtract Candidate B's votes from Candidate A's votes.\n\nThat is: 7,200 - 4,800.\n\nLet me do that subtraction:\n\n7,200 minus 4,800 is 2,400.\n\nSo, Candidate A received 2,400 more votes than Candidate B.\n\nWait a minute, is there a simpler way to think about this? Since Candidate A had 60% and Candidate B had 40%, the difference between them is 20%. So, maybe I could have just calculated 20% of the total votes to find the difference.\n\nLet me check that:\n\n20% of 12,000 is (20/100) * 12,000.\n\n20 divided by 100 is 0.2.\n\n0.2 multiplied by 12,000 is 2,400.\n\nYes, that's the same answer I got earlier.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result: Candidate A received 2,400 more votes than Candidate B.\n\nI think that makes sense. It's always good to cross-verify using different approaches to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2400} \\]"
