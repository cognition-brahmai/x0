Taylor** - Received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1990 for his pioneering investigations concerning deep inelastic scattering of electrons on protons and bound neutrons, which have been of fundamental importance for the development of the quark model in particle physics.\n\n4. **Bertram N. Brockhouse** - Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1994 for his contributions to the development of neutron scattering techniques for studies of condensed matter.\n\nThese are just a few examples; there are more Canadian Nobel laureates in different fields."
