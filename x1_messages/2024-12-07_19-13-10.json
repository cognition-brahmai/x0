Welcome back to \"Late Night with Seth Meyers.\"  \n**Emma Watson:** Thank you so much for having me, Seth. I'm really excited to be here.  \n**Seth Meyers:** Now, Emma, you've had an incredible career spanning over two decades now, from your breakout role as Hermione Granger in the \"Harry Potter\" series to your recent films like \"Little Women\" and \"Paris Can Wait.\" How does it feel to look back on your journey so far?  \n**Emma Watson:** It's been an incredible ride, to be honest. Starting out as a child actor in \"Harry Potter\" and then transitioning into more adult roles has been both challenging and rewarding. Each project has taught me something new, and I'm grateful for every opportunity I've had.  \n**Seth Meyers:** Speaking of \"Harry Potter,\" it's hard to believe that the first film came out over 20 years ago. Do you ever get recognized or approached by fans about your time in the wizarding world?  \n**Emma Watson:** Oh, absolutely. \"Harry Potter\" is a part of my identity, and I'm proud of the impact those films had on so many people's lives. It's amazing to see how the series has become a cultural phenomenon, and I'm humbled by the love and support from fans around the globe.  \n**Seth Meyers:** Transitioning into more adult roles must have been daunting at first. Can you share any particular challenges you faced during that period?  \n**Emma Watson:** Definitely. Moving from being a young actress to taking on more mature roles required a lot of growth, both personally and professionally. There was a lot of pressure to prove myself beyond Hermione, and I had to work hard to establish myself as a serious actor. But I'm glad I took those risks, and it's been incredibly fulfilling to explore different characters and genres.  \n**Seth Meyers:** Your performance in \"Little Women\" was widely praised. What was it like working with such a talented ensemble cast, including Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, and Meryl Streep?  \n**Emma Watson:** It was truly a dream come true. Working with such incredible actors was inspiring and pushed me to bring my best performance. Greta Gerwig, the director, created a wonderful environment on set, and we all became like a family. It was a transformative experience, and I'm so grateful for being a part of that film.  \n**Seth Meyers:** You're also known for your activism and advocacy work, particularly for gender equality and women's rights through your work with HeForShe. Can you tell us more about that initiative and its impact?  \n**Emma Watson:** HeForShe is a solidarity movement for gender equality that engages men and boys as allies in changing attitudes and behaviors that perpetuate inequality. It's been incredible to see the support and participation from people all over the world. Through this platform, we aim to create a more inclusive and equal society for everyone.  \n**Seth Meyers:** Your dedication to social causes is truly inspiring. How do you balance your acting career with your activism?  \n**Emma Watson:** It's definitely a juggling act, but I believe that using my platform to raise awareness and effect positive change is an important part of being a public figure. I try to prioritize my time and choose projects that align with my values, whether it's through the roles I take on or the causes I support.  \n**Seth Meyers:** Shifting gears a bit, you've also dabbled in fashion and launched your own clothing line, \"MyCloset.\" Can you tell us about that venture and what inspired you to enter the fashion industry?  \n**Emma Watson:** Yes, \"MyCloset\" was a sustainable fashion collection that I co-designed with sustainable fashion brand Studio D' Arte. I've always been passionate about fashion, but I wanted to approach it in a way that was ethical and environmentally conscious. The collection focused on timeless pieces that could be worn for years to come, promoting a more sustainable approach to fashion consumption.  \n**Seth Meyers:** Sustainability is such an important issue, and it's great to see celebrities like you using your influence to promote eco-friendly practices. What message would you like to send to your fans regarding sustainable living?  \n**Emma Watson:** I think the most important thing is to start small and make conscious choices in our daily lives. Whether it's reducing plastic use, supporting ethical brands, or being mindful of our energy consumption, every little action counts. Together, we can create a significant impact and work towards a more sustainable future.  \n**Seth Meyers:** Before we wrap up, can you give us a sneak peek into any upcoming projects or ventures you're excited about?  \n**Emma Watson:** I'm always working on new things, but I can't reveal too much just yet. However, I can say that I have some exciting film projects in the pipeline, and I'm also continuing my advocacy work. So stay tuned!  \n**Seth Meyers:** We definitely will. Emma, it's been an absolute pleasure having you here tonight. Thank you so much for joining us on \"Late Night with Seth Meyers.\"  \n**Emma Watson:** Thank you, Seth. It's been a blast!  \n**Seth Meyers:** Ladies and gentlemen, give it up one more time for the incredible Emma Watson!  \n**[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS FROM THE AUDIENCE]**  \n**[OUTRO MUSIC FADES IN]**  \n**Announcer (Off-screen):** Don't forget to tune in next week for another edition of \"Late Night with Seth Meyers.\" Goodnight!  \n**[FADE OUT]**"
