        "content": "Riddles are always fun! Let's see, \"You hear it speak, for it has a hard tongue. But it cannot breathe, for it has not a lung.\" Hmm, so it makes sound, has something like a tongue, but isn't alive since it doesn't breathe or have lungs. Maybe it's an instrument or some kind of mechanical device.\n\nLet me think about instruments. Like a trumpet or a flute, they can make sounds, but they don't have tongues. Wait, maybe a xylophone or a piano, but again, no tongue. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's something that produces sound mechanically, like a bell or a clock. A clock ticks, but does it have a tongue? Well, clocks have bells, and bells have clappers, which could be considered a tongue of sorts. But not all clocks have bells.\n\nWait, what about a bell itself? Bells make sound when their clapper hits the side, so the clapper could be thought of as a tongue. And bells don't breathe; they're inanimate objects. That seems promising.\n\nBut let's consider other options. Maybe it's a telephone. Telephones have a receiver that can produce sound, and in older phones, there was a diaphragm that might be likened to a tongue. But telephones do require electricity to function, and they don't have lungs, that's for sure.\n\nAnother possibility could be a person's voice recorded on a device, like a phonograph. The phonograph plays back recorded sound, and the needle on the record could perhaps be considered a tongue. But again, the device itself doesn't breathe.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a type of horn, like a hunting horn or a car horn. Horns make sound, and some have internal mechanisms that could be termed a tongue. But again, they're not living and don't breathe.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe it's something that speaks in a mechanical or electronic way, like an old-style speaker or a loudspeaker. Speakers have diaphragms that vibrate to produce sound, but I'm not sure if that qualifies as a tongue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of alarm or buzzer. Buzzers make noise, but again, no breathing or lungs.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a specific type of musical instrument. For example, a marimba has bars that are struck by mallets, but that doesn't really have a tongue.\n\nLet me consider the wording again. \"You hear it speak, for it has a hard tongue.\" So, it has a hard tongue, which distinguishes it from living beings, whose tongues are soft.\n\nMaybe it's a type of tool or machine that makes sound incidentally, like a hammer hitting metal, but that seems like a stretch.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps it's a type of toy that makes noise, like a rattle or a xylophone. But again, no real tongue.\n\nWait, what about a type of musical instrument where a tongue vibrates to produce sound. For example, in a clarinet, the reed vibrates, acting like a tongue. But a clarinet has a reed, not a hard tongue.\n\nSimilarly, in a flute, the tongue of the player controls the airflow, but the flute itself doesn't have a tongue.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think about instruments where the tongue is part of the mechanism.\n\nWait a minute, what about a Jew's harp? That has a tongue that you pluck, and it vibrates to make sound. You hold it to your lips and vary the shape of your mouth to change the sound. So, it has a hard tongue, and it doesn't breathe.\n\nThat could be it! A Jew's harp fits the description perfectly.\n\nBut let's double-check. Does a Jew's harp have a hard tongue? Yes, it has a metal tongue that vibrates. Does it breathe? No, it's an inanimate object without lungs.\n\nAnd you hear it speak in the sense that it produces sound when the tongue vibrates.\n\nSo, I think the answer is a Jew's harp.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Jew's harp}} \\]"
