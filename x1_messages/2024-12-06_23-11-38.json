It's famous for its association with the Loch Ness Monster, often referred to as \"Nessie.\" Loch Ness is the second largest Scottish lake by surface area but holds more water than all the lakes in England and Wales combined due to its great depth. The loch is about 23 miles (37 kilometers) long and has a maximum depth of around 754 feet (230 meters). Its volume is approximately 264 billion cubic feet (7.5 trillion liters), which is indeed more than the combined volume of all lakes in England and Wales."
