        "content": "So if a car is going at an average speed of 45 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, right? I need to find out how far it's traveled. I remember that distance, speed, and time are related, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.\n\nLet me think... Is it distance equals speed multiplied by time, or maybe speed equals distance over time? Wait, I think it's distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, distance = speed \u00d7 time.\n\nOkay, so if speed is 45 mph and time is 2.5 hours, then distance should be 45 multiplied by 2.5. But let me make sure about the formula first.\n\nI recall that speed is the rate at which distance is covered per unit of time. So, speed = distance / time. That means distance = speed \u00d7 time. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo, plugging in the values: distance = 45 mph \u00d7 2.5 hours.\n\nNow, 45 multiplied by 2 is 90, and 45 multiplied by 0.5 is 22.5. So, 90 + 22.5 should be 112.5.\n\nTherefore, the car has traveled 112.5 miles.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using dimensions or something to confirm.\n\nSpeed is in miles per hour, and time is in hours, so when you multiply them, the hours unit cancels out, leaving miles. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use the formula for constant speed, where distance is equal to speed multiplied by time, yes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. The car has traveled 112.5 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{112.5 \\text{ miles}} \\]"
