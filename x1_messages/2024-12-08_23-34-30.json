While it may not offer direct answers, it frequently yields valuable contextual information.\nTextCondenser[input]: Condenses a piece of text into its essential points. Especially beneficial when handling voluminous information.\nInquiryResponder[input]: Responds to inquiries using ordinary wisdom, general awareness, or particular context derived from previous evidence.\n\nInputs to each function should be uncomplicated strings, void of quotation marks or \"+\" signs for string concatenation, e.g., InquiryResponder[Who wrote Pride and Prejudice, given :evidence2:?].\n\nEnsure that every stage in the plan matches up with precisely one evidence output.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [Initial action based on the question]\n:evidence0: = [Call to function with input parameter]\nPlan: [Subsequent action, bearing in mind the result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Call to next function with input parameter, possibly referring to earlier evidence like \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: containing the ultimate answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who was Jane Austen and what are her most famous works?"

        "content": "Alright, I need to find out who Jane Austen was and what her most famous works are. I have a few tools to help me with this: LibrarySearch, TextCondenser, and InquiryResponder. Let's see how I can use these step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably look up some information about Jane Austen. The LibrarySearch tool seems perfect for this because it can search an online library database for information related to her. So, I'll start by using LibrarySearch with the input \"Jane Austen.\"\n\n:evidence0: = LibrarySearch[Jane Austen]\n\nNow, :evidence0: should contain a lot of information about Jane Austen. Since it might be a big chunk of text, it's a good idea to condense it into the most important points. That's where TextCondenser comes in. I'll use TextCondenser on :evidence0: to get the key details about who she was.\n\n:evidence1: = TextCondenser[:evidence0:]\n\nWith :evidence1:, I should have a concise summary of Jane Austen's life and works. But to specifically answer who she was, I might need to ask a direct question based on this condensed information. InquiryResponder can help with that. I'll input \"Who was Jane Austen?\" along with the context from :evidence1:.\n\n:evidence2: = InquiryResponder[Who was Jane Austen? Given context :evidence1:]\n\nNow, :evidence2: should give me a clear answer to who Jane Austen was, based on the condensed information.\n\nNext, I need to find out what her most famous works are. I can probably find this information in the same sources where I found information about her life. But to be thorough, I might want to search specifically for her works. So, I'll use LibrarySearch again, this time with the input \"Jane Austen works.\"\n\n:evidence3: = LibrarySearch[Jane Austen works]\n\nThis should give me a list or descriptions of her works. Again, since it might be a lot of information, I'll use TextCondenser to get the essential points.\n\n:evidence4: = TextCondenser[:evidence3:]\n\nNow, :evidence4: should have a concise list of her works. To identify her most famous ones, I might need to analyze this information or ask a direct question. I'll use InquiryResponder to ask, \"What are Jane Austen's most famous works?\" using the context from :evidence4:.\n\n:evidence5: = InquiryResponder[What are Jane Austen's most famous works? Given context :evidence4:]\n\n:evidence5: should provide the answer to which of her works are considered the most famous.\n\nTo make sure I have a complete answer, I might want to combine the information from :evidence2: and :evidence5:. I can use InquiryResponder again to craft a final answer that includes both who she was and her most famous works.\n\n:evidence6: = InquiryResponder[Provide a summary of who Jane Austen was and her most famous works, given context :evidence2: and :evidence5:]\n\nFinally, :evidence6: should contain the comprehensive answer to the question.\n\n**Final Answer:** :evidence6:"
