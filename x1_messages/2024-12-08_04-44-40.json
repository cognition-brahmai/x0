        "content": "So there are 120 students and 8 teachers, and we need to divide the students equally among the teachers. To find out how many students each teacher gets, we should divide the total number of students by the number of teachers. So, that's 120 divided by 8. Let me do the math.\n\n120 \u00f7 8 = 15.\n\nSo, each teacher is assigned 15 students. But wait, let me check if that makes sense. If each teacher has 15 students, and there are 8 teachers, then 15 multiplied by 8 should give us back the total number of students.\n\n15 \u00d7 8 = 120.\n\nYes, that checks out. So, each teacher has 15 students in their group.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
