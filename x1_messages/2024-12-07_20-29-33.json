        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a rectangular room that measures 12 feet by 16 feet, and I need to cover the entire floor with square tiles that are 2 feet on each side. I need to figure out how many tiles I'll need.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out the area of the room and the area of one tile, and then see how many tiles fit into the room's area. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the area of the room is length times width, which is 12 feet times 16 feet. Let me calculate that: 12 times 16 is 192 square feet. So, the room's area is 192 square feet.\n\nNext, the tiles are square and each side is 2 feet. So, the area of one tile is 2 feet times 2 feet, which is 4 square feet.\n\nNow, to find out how many tiles I need, I can divide the room's area by the area of one tile. So, 192 square feet divided by 4 square feet per tile should give me the number of tiles required.\n\nLet me do that division: 192 divided by 4 is 48. So, I need 48 tiles.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Instead of calculating areas, perhaps I can think about how many tiles fit along the length and how many fit along the width, and then multiply those numbers.\n\nSo, the room is 12 feet wide and 16 feet long. Each tile is 2 feet on each side.\n\nFirst, along the width: 12 feet divided by 2 feet per tile is 6 tiles.\n\nAlong the length: 16 feet divided by 2 feet per tile is 8 tiles.\n\nSo, total tiles would be 6 times 8, which is also 48 tiles.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, it seems like 48 tiles are needed.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any waste or if the tiles don't fit perfectly. But in this problem, it says the room measures exactly 12 by 16 feet, and the tiles are 2 feet on each side, so they should fit perfectly without any need for cutting or anything like that.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm not missing any part of the floor. Is there any area that might be left uncovered with this calculation? I don't think so, because both methods give me the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can visualize it. If I imagine the room as a grid where each grid square is 2 feet by 2 feet, then the room is 6 tiles wide and 8 tiles long, totaling 48 tiles.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use a different size of tile, say 1 foot by 1 foot, I'd need more tiles, but in this case, the tiles are specifically 2 feet by 2 feet.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The calculation seems straightforward, and both methods give me the same answer.\n\nSo, the final answer is 48 tiles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
