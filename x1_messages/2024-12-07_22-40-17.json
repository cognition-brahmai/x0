        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 4 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. So, total number of balls is 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 balls. I need to draw three balls without replacement and find the probability that I get one ball of each color.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes when drawing three balls from nine. Since it's without replacement, the order doesn't matter here, so it's a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, total number of ways to choose 3 balls from 9 is C(9, 3). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(9, 3) = 9! / (3! * (9 - 3)!) = (9*8*7*6!) / (3! * 6!) = (9*8*7) / (3*2*1) = 84.\n\nSo, there are 84 possible ways to draw 3 balls from 9.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is getting one ball of each color. There are three colors: red, blue, and green. So, I need one red, one blue, and one green ball.\n\nLet's find out how many ways I can choose one red ball from four, one blue ball from three, and one green ball from two.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one red ball from four is C(4, 1) = 4.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one blue ball from three is C(3, 1) = 3.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one green ball from two is C(2, 1) = 2.\n\nSince these are independent choices, I can multiply them to get the total number of favorable outcomes.\n\nSo, total favorable outcomes = 4 * 3 * 2 = 24.\n\nNow, probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes.\n\nTherefore, probability = 24 / 84.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction. Both 24 and 84 are divisible by 12.\n\n24 \u00f7 12 = 2\n\n84 \u00f7 12 = 7\n\nSo, probability = 2/7.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal ways to choose 3 balls from 9: C(9, 3) = 84. That seems right.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one of each color: C(4,1) * C(3,1) * C(2,1) = 4 * 3 * 2 = 24. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, probability is 24/84, which simplifies to 2/7.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it step by step, considering the draws one at a time without replacement.\n\nFirst draw: Any color is fine, as long as the next two complement it.\n\nBut I think the combination approach is simpler and less error-prone.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate it using probabilities for each draw, considering the changing probabilities as balls are removed without replacement.\n\nLet's try that approach to verify.\n\nFirst draw: Probability of drawing any color is 1, since any ball is acceptable at this stage.\n\nSecond draw: Needs to be a different color from the first.\n\nThird draw: Needs to be the remaining color not yet drawn.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the colors as R (red), B (blue), G (green).\n\nPossible sequences for one of each color are R-B-G, R-G-B, B-R-G, B-G-R, G-R-B, G-B-R.\n\nSo, there are 6 possible sequences.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for one sequence and then multiply by 6.\n\nTake sequence R-B-G:\n\nProbability of first ball being red: 4/9\n\nSecond ball being blue: 3/8 (since one red ball is already drawn, total balls left are 8)\n\nThird ball being green: 2/7 (since two balls are already drawn, total balls left are 7)\n\nSo, probability for R-B-G is (4/9) * (3/8) * (2/7) = (4*3*2) / (9*8*7) = 24 / 504 = 1/21\n\nSimilarly, for any other sequence, the probability will be the same: 1/21\n\nSince there are 6 such sequences, total probability is 6 * (1/21) = 6/21 = 2/7\n\nOkay, this matches my earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of permutations.\n\nTotal number of ways to draw 3 balls from 9 is C(9,3) = 84, as before.\n\nNumber of favorable ways is C(4,1) * C(3,1) * C(2,1) = 24, as before.\n\nProbability is 24/84 = 2/7.\n\nAlternatively, considering the order:\n\nTotal permutations of drawing 3 balls from 9 is P(9,3) = 9*8*7 = 504.\n\nNumber of favorable permutations: 4 choices for red, 3 for blue, 2 for green, and 3! ways to arrange them.\n\nSo, 4 * 3 * 2 * 6 = 24 * 6 = 144.\n\nWait, but that would make probability 144/504 = 12/42 = 2/7, again the same answer.\n\nSo, all these different approaches lead to the same probability of 2/7.\n\nI think it's consistent now.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing one ball of each color is 2/7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{7}} \\]"
