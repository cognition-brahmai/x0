        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 apple trees in the garden, and each tree produces 10 apples. So, first, I need to find out the total number of apples. That should be straightforward: 5 trees times 10 apples per tree equals 50 apples. So, there are 50 apples in total.\n\nNow, the problem says that half of the apples are eaten by birds. So, I need to find out how many apples are left after the birds have eaten half. If half are eaten, that means the other half are left, right? So, half of 50 apples is 25. Therefore, 25 apples are eaten by birds, and 25 are left.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to interpret this? Let's think about it. The problem says \"half of the apples are eaten by birds.\" It doesn't say anything about the apples being eaten over time or anything like that. So, it's a straightforward calculation: total apples minus half eaten equals half left.\n\nBut maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing. Let's consider if any apples could be partially eaten or something, but the problem doesn't mention that. It says \"eaten by birds,\" so I think it's safe to assume that if a bird eats an apple, it's completely eaten.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether all the apples are accessible to the birds. The problem doesn't mention any apples being protected or anything like that, so I'll assume that all 50 apples are available for the birds to eat.\n\nSo, again, half of 50 is 25 eaten, and 25 left. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut let's think about it in another way. Suppose the birds eat apples from each tree individually. So, each tree has 10 apples, and half are eaten. That means 5 apples per tree are eaten, so 5 per tree times 5 trees equals 25 eaten, and again, 25 left.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, whether I look at it globally or per tree, I end up with the same number.\n\nIs there any other factor to consider? For example, maybe some apples are rotten or something, but the problem doesn't mention that. It seems like a simple scenario: there are 5 trees, each with 10 apples, and birds eat half of them.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I think the best answer is that there are 25 apples left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
