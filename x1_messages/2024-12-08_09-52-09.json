        "content": "So I have this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There are 4 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 5 green balls in a bag. So total, how many balls are there? Let's add them up: 4 red plus 3 blue plus 5 green equals 12 balls in total.\n\nNow, the question is, if I pick two balls at random without replacement, what's the probability that both are green. Okay, so without replacement means that once I pick the first ball, it stays out, and I pick the second ball from the remaining balls.\n\nProbability of both events happening is the probability of the first event multiplied by the probability of the second event given that the first one has already happened.\n\nSo, first, what's the probability that the first ball I pick is green? There are 5 green balls out of 12 total balls, so that's 5/12.\n\nNext, given that the first ball was green, there are now 4 green balls left and total balls are now 11, since we didn't replace the first ball. So, the probability that the second ball is also green is 4/11.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are green is (5/12) multiplied by (4/11).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n(5/12) * (4/11) = (5*4)/(12*11) = 20 / 132.\n\nNow, we can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n20 \u00f7 4 = 5\n\n132 \u00f7 4 = 33\n\nSo, 5/33.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are green is 5/33.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Is there another way to approach this problem to confirm?\n\nAnother way is to use combinations. Since we're picking two balls without regard to order, we can use combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 12 is C(12,2), which is 12 choose 2.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to pick 2 green balls out of 5 is C(5,2).\n\nSo, the probability is C(5,2) divided by C(12,2).\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nC(5,2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = (5*4*3!) / (2*1 * 3!) = (20) / 2 = 10.\n\nC(12,2) = 12! / (2!(12-2)!) = (12*11*10!) / (2*1 * 10!)) = (132) / 2 = 66.\n\nSo, probability is 10/66, which simplifies to 5/33.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, that makes sense.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Suppose I think about it in terms of permutations, where order matters.\n\nFirst, the number of ways to pick two green balls in order: first green, then green.\n\nProbability of first being green is 5/12, second being green given the first was green is 4/11, just like before.\n\nAlternatively, probability of first being green and second being green is (5/12)*(4/11) = 20/132 = 5/33.\n\nAlternatively, probability of first being green and second being green is the same as picking two green balls without regard to order.\n\nWait, no. If order matters, it would be permutations, if order doesn't matter, it's combinations.\n\nBut in this case, since we're picking without replacement and not specifying order, combinations are more appropriate.\n\nBut as long as we're consistent, both approaches give the same answer.\n\nSo, bottom line, the probability is 5/33.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any chance of making a mistake here.\n\nOne common mistake could be to assume that the probability is (5/12)*(5/12), but that would be incorrect because it doesn't account for not replacing the first ball.\n\nAnother mistake could be to think that after picking one green ball, there are still 5 green balls left, which is not the case since we're not replacing.\n\nAlternatively, someone might think that the total number of balls remains 12 for both picks, which would be wrong in the without replacement scenario.\n\nBut in this case, since we're picking without replacement, the total balls decrease by one after each pick.\n\nSo, yes, the correct approach is to consider the changing totals.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list all possible outcomes, but that's impractical with 12 balls.\n\nCombinations and permutations are more efficient for larger numbers.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability that both balls picked are green is 5/33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{33}} \\]\n"
