        "content": "In the field of biomedical engineering, a new technique has been developed for the non-invasive monitoring of glucose levels in diabetic patients. This technique uses a small, wearable device that uses near-infrared spectroscopy to measure glucose levels in the interstitial fluid beneath the skin. The device sends these measurements to a smartphone app, which alerts the user if their glucose levels are too high or too low. This technology has the potential to replace traditional finger-prick tests, which can be painful and inconvenient.\nWhich of the following best describes the primary function of the smartphone app in this new technique?\nA. To measure glucose levels in the interstitial fluid\nB. To use near-infrared spectroscopy to monitor glucose levels\nC. To alert the user if their glucose levels are too high or too low\nD. To replace traditional finger-prick tests"
