ECHO's testimony was crucial for preventing the weapon's deployment, which posed a significant threat to global security.\n\n**PRE-MISSION ASSESSMENT**\n\nIntelligence indicated that ECHO was being held in a high-security research facility located near the city of Novograd. The facility was guarded by elite troops loyal to the rogue faction, and access was strictly controlled. Additionally, the facility was equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance and security systems, making infiltration challenging.\n\n**MISSION PLAN**\n\nThe mission plan involved three key phases:\n\n1. **Infiltration:** Gain access to the facility without raising alarms.\n\n2. **Extraction:** Locate and extract ECHO from his holding cell.\n\n3. **Exfiltration:** Evade pursuing forces and rendezvous with extraction teams.\n\n**OPERATIONAL DETAILS**\n\n**Phase 1: Infiltration**\n\nUtilizing a combination of social engineering and technical expertise, I posed as a high-ranking official from the Kryzhmystani Ministry of Defense. With the assistance of a local contact, I obtained the necessary credentials and clearance to enter the facility.\n\nOnce inside, I employed stealth tactics to navigate through the facility, avoiding detection by security personnel and surveillance cameras. I made use of the facility's internal communication systems to monitor movements and adjust my route accordingly.\n\n**Phase 2: Extraction**\n\nUpon reaching the secured area where ECHO was being held, I encountered unexpected resistance. A group of heavily armed guards had been alerted to my presence, likely due to a breach in our operational security.\n\nI engaged the guards in a brief but intense firefight, eliminating threats while minimizing collateral damage. During the exchange, I sustained a minor injury to my left shoulder, which has since been treated.\n\nAfter securing the area, I located ECHO in a heavily guarded cell. He was in a weakened state due to prolonged interrogation and torture. I administered medical stabilizers and sedatives to ensure his condition was stable for transport.\n\n**Phase 3: Exfiltration**\n\nWith ECHO secured, we made our way to the extraction point. En route, we were ambushed by additional security forces. I engaged the enemy, utilizing hand-to-hand combat and strategic use of environment to gain the upper hand.\n\nWe reached the extraction point under heavy fire and boarded the pre-positioned helicopter, which lifted off immediately. Pursuing forces attempted to intercept but were outmaneuvered by our pilot's skilled evasive actions.\n\n**AFTER-ACTION REVIEW**\n\nThe operation was successful in extracting ECHO and preventing the weapon's deployment. However, there were several areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Operational Security:** There was a breach in our security protocols, leading to early detection by facility guards. A thorough investigation is recommended to identify the weak point.\n\n2. **Asset Condition:** ECHO's physical and mental state was poorer than intelligence reports indicated, which impacted his ability to provide immediate intelligence. Post-extraction rehabilitation and medical care are prioritized.\n\n3. **Extraction Timing:** The extraction window was narrower than anticipated due to increased security presence. Future missions should account for such variables.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nIn summary, despite encountering unforeseen challenges, the mission was accomplished with the successful extraction of ECHO. His testimony and expertise are now being utilized to neutralize the threat posed by the rogue weapon system.\n\nI remain at your disposal for any further assignments or debriefings.\n\n**END OF REPORT**\n\n**-Natasha Romanoff**\n\n**Black Widow**\n\n**S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent**"
