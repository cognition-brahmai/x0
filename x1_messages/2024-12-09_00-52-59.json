        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, John starts with 5 apples. He eats 2 apples and gives away 1 apple. The question is, how many apples does he have left?\n\nFirst, I'll consider the most straightforward scenario. If John eats 2 apples and gives away 1, that means he's reducing his apple count by 3 in total. So, starting with 5, minus 3, that leaves him with 2 apples. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are other interpretations. For example, perhaps the apples he gives away are from the ones he hasn't eaten yet. Does the order matter here? Let's think about that.\n\nScenario 1: John eats 2 apples first, then gives away 1.\n\nSo, he starts with 5, eats 2, leaving him with 3. Then he gives away 1 of those 3, leaving him with 2. That matches the straightforward approach.\n\nScenario 2: John gives away 1 apple first, then eats 2.\n\nStarting with 5, gives away 1, leaving him with 4. Then he eats 2, which leaves him with 2 again. Hmm, same result.\n\nSo, in both orders, he ends up with 2 apples. Does the order matter at all? In this case, it seems like it doesn't affect the final count.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any possibility that the apples are different or if there are any restrictions based on which apples he chooses to eat or give away. The problem doesn't specify anything about the apples being different, so we can assume they're all the same.\n\nAnother thought: maybe he eats 2 and gives away 1 simultaneously in some way. But that seems unlikely. The problem says he eats 2 and gives away 1, but it doesn't specify the timing, so perhaps there are multiple ways this could play out.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a chance that the apple he gives away is one of the ones he was going to eat. For example, maybe he picks 3 apples to eat and give away, but then decides to give one of them away instead of eating it. In that case, he's still reducing his total by 2 apples (since he was going to eat 3 but only eats 2), but that seems like a more complicated interpretation.\n\nLet me try to model that:\n\nSuppose John picks 3 apples to eat, but then decides to give one of those three away, so he only eats 2. In this case, he's still starting with 5, reducing by 3 (2 eaten and 1 given away), ending with 2.\n\nAlternatively, if he picks 2 to eat and 1 to give away separately, it's the same outcome.\n\nIt seems like no matter how I look at it, he ends up with 2 apples.\n\nIs there any possibility that he has more than 2 left? For example, maybe the apples he gives away are ones he wouldn't have eaten anyway, but that doesn't make sense because he only was going to eat 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he gives away an apple that he was saving for later, but again, since all apples are the same, it shouldn't make a difference.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a chance that he gives away an apple that he was planning to eat, which changes things. For instance, suppose he was going to eat 2 specific apples, but then he gives one of them away instead. So, he eats 1 and gives 1 away, leaving him with 3.\n\nBut that doesn't align with the problem statement, which says he eats 2 and gives away 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's consider the total change in the number of apples he has.\n\nHe starts with 5.\n\nHe eats 2: this reduces his count by 2.\n\nHe gives away 1: this reduces his count by 1.\n\nTotal reduction: 3 apples.\n\nTherefore, 5 - 3 = 2 apples left.\n\nThis seems straightforward and consistent across different scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a chance that giving away an apple affects the number he eats. For example, if he gives away an apple, he might feel bad and eat an extra one. But that's not suggested in the problem, so it's unwarranted to assume that.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps he eats 2 apples and then gives away 1 of the remaining apples. Again, that leads to the same conclusion.\n\nOr, he might give away 1 apple and then eat 2 of the remaining ones. Again, ends with 2 apples.\n\nI think no matter how I look at it, the answer is 2 apples left.\n\nMaybe I should consider if he eats the apples and then gives them away, but that doesn't make sense because you can't give away eaten apples.\n\nWait, no. If he eats 2 and gives away 1, those are both actions performed on the apples he has. He can't give away apples he has already eaten. So, the giving away must be from the remaining apples after eating.\n\nBut in the problem, it doesn't specify the order, so both scenarios are possible: eating first then giving away, or giving away first then eating.\n\nBut as we've seen, both lead to the same result.\n\nTherefore, the most likely and straightforward answer is that John has 2 apples left.\n\nI think I've considered all possible interpretations, and in each case, the result is the same. So, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
