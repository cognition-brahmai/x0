        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 150 widgets per hour, and it operates for 8 hours a day. So, first, I need to find out how many widgets it produces in one day. I think I should multiply the hourly production by the number of hours per day. So, that would be 150 widgets/hour times 8 hours/day. Let me do the math: 150 times 8 is 1,200. So, the factory produces 1,200 widgets in one day.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the total production over 5 days. So, I need to multiply the daily production by the number of days. That means 1,200 widgets/day times 5 days. Let's calculate that: 1,200 times 5 is 6,000. Therefore, the factory will produce 6,000 widgets in 5 days.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations. First, 150 widgets per hour for 8 hours: 150 times 8 is indeed 1,200. Then, over 5 days, 1,200 times 5 is 6,000. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem to confirm? Maybe I can calculate the total number of hours the factory operates in 5 days and then multiply by the hourly production. So, 8 hours/day times 5 days is 40 hours. Then, 150 widgets/hour times 40 hours is also 6,000 widgets. Okay, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how many widgets are produced per day and then sum them up for 5 days. As I already calculated, 1,200 widgets per day times 5 days is again 6,000.\n\nI think no matter which way I look at it, the answer is 6,000 widgets in 5 days.\n\nJust to be thorough, are there any other factors I should consider? The problem says the factory operates for 8 hours a day and produces 150 widgets per hour. It doesn't mention any breaks or downtime, so I can assume that it's a steady production rate.\n\nAlso, the question specifies \"in 5 days,\" so I don't need to worry about partial days or anything like that.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 6,000 widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6000} \\]"
