The \"orders\" table contains columns for order ID, customer ID, product ID, order date, and possibly other details.\n2. The \"customers\" table contains customer details, including customer ID and name.\n3. The \"products\" table contains product details, including product ID and price.\n\nGiven these assumptions, here's how you can structure the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    c.customer_id,\n    c.customer_name,\n    SUM(o.order_value) AS total_order_value,\n    MAX(p.product_price) AS most_expensive_product\nFROM \n    customers c\nJOIN \n    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id\nJOIN \n    products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id\nWHERE \n    o.order_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 30 DAY\nGROUP BY \n    c.customer_id, c.customer_name;\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Joins**: \n   - We join the \"customers\" table with the \"orders\" table on the customer ID to link customers with their orders.\n   - Then, we join the \"orders\" table with the \"products\" table on the product ID to link orders with the products they contain.\n\n2. **Filtering**:\n   - We use a WHERE clause to filter orders placed in the last 30 days. `CURDATE() - INTERVAL 30 DAY` calculates the date 30 days ago from the current date.\n\n3. **Aggregations**:\n   - `SUM(o.order_value)` calculates the total value of orders for each customer.\n   - `MAX(p.product_price)` finds the most expensive product purchased by each customer in the specified period.\n\n4. **Grouping**:\n   - We group the results by customer ID and customer name to aggregate the order values and find the maximum product price per customer.\n\nThis query provides a list of customers who have placed orders in the last 30 days, along with the total value of their orders and the most expensive product they purchased during this period."
