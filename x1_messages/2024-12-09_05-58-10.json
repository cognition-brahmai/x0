        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two trains: one leaving from New York City (NYC) heading towards Los Angeles (LA) at 100 mph, and another leaving from LA heading towards NYC at 200 mph, but it starts three hours later. We need to find out which train is closer to NYC when they meet.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the situation. There's a distance between NYC and LA, and two trains are moving towards each other, but they start at different times.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Train A: Leaves NYC at time t=0, speed 100 mph.\n\n- Train B: Leaves LA at time t=3 hours, speed 200 mph.\n\nWe need to find the point where they meet and determine which train is closer to NYC at that point.\n\nTo solve this, I think I need to find the time when they meet and then calculate their positions.\n\nBut wait, the distance between NYC and LA isn't given. Maybe I need to assume a distance, say D miles, and then proceed.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the distance between NYC and LA is D miles.\n\nNow, Train A has been traveling for t hours when they meet.\n\nSince Train B starts 3 hours later, it has been traveling for (t - 3) hours when they meet.\n\nThe distance covered by Train A when they meet is 100t miles.\n\nThe distance covered by Train B when they meet is 200(t - 3) miles.\n\nSince they are moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they've covered should equal the total distance D.\n\nSo:\n\n100t + 200(t - 3) = D\n\nLet\u2019s solve for t:\n\n100t + 200t - 600 = D\n\n300t - 600 = D\n\n300t = D + 600\n\nt = (D + 600)/300\n\nNow, the meeting time is t = (D + 600)/300 hours.\n\nAt this time, Train A has traveled 100t miles, and Train B has traveled 200(t - 3) miles.\n\nBut the question is, which train is closer to NYC when they meet?\n\nWait a minute, when they meet, they are at the same point, so they are equidistant from NYC at that instant.\n\nBut that can't be right because one train has traveled from NYC and the other from LA, so their distances from NYC should be different.\n\nWait, no. When they meet, they are at the same point, so their distances from NYC are the same.\n\nBut the question is asking which train is closer to NYC when they meet, but if they are at the same point, they should be at the same distance from NYC.\n\nThis seems confusing.\n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nPerhaps the question is about which train is closer to NYC at the moment they meet, considering their starting points and speeds.\n\nBut if they meet at a certain point, both are at that point, so their distances from NYC are equal.\n\nWait, maybe the question is trying to trick me into thinking about their positions relative to NYC.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking about their distances from NYC before they meet, but specifically at the time they meet.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the distance D between NYC and LA is known.\n\nLet\u2019s say D is 2400 miles (I\u2019m just assuming a number to make calculations easier).\n\nNow, Train A leaves NYC at t=0 at 100 mph.\n\nTrain B leaves LA at t=3 hours at 200 mph.\n\nWe need to find t when they meet.\n\nDistance covered by Train A: 100t miles.\n\nDistance covered by Train B: 200(t - 3) miles.\n\nTotal distance:\n\n100t + 200(t - 3) = 2400\n\n100t + 200t - 600 = 2400\n\n300t = 3000\n\nt = 10 hours.\n\nSo, they meet after 10 hours from when Train A left.\n\nAt that time:\n\nTrain A has traveled 100 mph * 10 h = 1000 miles from NYC.\n\nTrain B has traveled 200 mph * (10 - 3) h = 200 * 7 = 1400 miles from LA.\n\nSince the total distance is 2400 miles, Train B has traveled 2400 - 1000 = 1400 miles from LA, which matches.\n\nSo, when they meet, both are at the same point, which is 1000 miles from NYC and 1400 miles from LA.\n\nTherefore, at the meeting point, both trains are equidistant from NYC.\n\nWait, but the question is asking which train is closer to NYC when they meet.\n\nBut they are at the same point, so they are equally close to NYC at that instant.\n\nThis seems contradictory to the problem's phrasing.\n\nMaybe the problem expects a different interpretation.\n\nPerhaps it's about which train has covered less distance, hence is closer to NYC in terms of the journey traveled.\n\nBut in reality, when they meet, they are at the same point, so their distances from NYC are equal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that one train has come from NYC and the other from LA, and their positions relative to NYC.\n\nBut again, at the meeting point, the distances should be equal.\n\nI think there might be a trick in the wording.\n\nLet me consider the general case without assuming a specific distance D.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nt = (D + 600)/300 hours.\n\nDistance from NYC to the meeting point: 100t miles.\n\nBut t = (D + 600)/300, so distance from NYC: 100*(D + 600)/300 = (100/300)*(D + 600) = (1/3)(D + 600) miles.\n\nAlternatively, distance from LA: D - 100t = D - (1/3)(D + 600) = (3D - D - 600)/3 = (2D - 600)/3 miles.\n\nBut at the meeting point, both trains are at the same location, so their distances from NYC are equal.\n\nTherefore, when they meet, both trains are equally close to NYC.\n\nHence, neither train is closer; they are at the same distance.\n\nBut perhaps the question is expecting an answer based on their starting points or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose Train A has traveled for t hours, and Train B for (t - 3) hours.\n\nDistance covered by Train A: 100t miles.\n\nDistance covered by Train B: 200(t - 3) miles.\n\nTotal distance covered: 100t + 200(t - 3) = 100t + 200t - 600 = 300t - 600 miles.\n\nThis should equal the distance D between NYC and LA.\n\nSo, 300t - 600 = D.\n\nTherefore, t = (D + 600)/300 hours.\n\nNow, distance from NYC to the meeting point: 100t = 100*(D + 600)/300 = (100/300)*(D + 600) = (1/3)(D + 600) miles.\n\nSimilarly, distance from LA to the meeting point: 200(t - 3) = 200*((D + 600)/300 - 3) = 200*(D + 600 - 900)/300 = 200*(D - 300)/300 = (200/300)*(D - 300) = (2/3)(D - 300) miles.\n\nBut since they meet at the same point, these two distances should add up to D:\n\n(1/3)(D + 600) + (2/3)(D - 300) = D\n\nLet\u2019s check:\n\n(1/3)D + 200 + (2/3)D - 200 = D\n\n(1/3)D + (2/3)D + 200 - 200 = D\n\nD = D\n\nIt checks out.\n\nSo, the meeting point is (1/3)(D + 600) miles from NYC.\n\nNow, the question is, which train is closer to NYC when they meet?\n\nBut they are at the same point, so they are equally close to NYC.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about their positions relative to NYC before they meet.\n\nBut specifically, it's asking at the moment they meet.\n\nI think the answer is that both trains are equally close to NYC when they meet, as they are at the same point.\n\nMaybe the confusion arises from the different speeds and starting times, but logically, at the meeting point, their distances from NYC are equal.\n\nTherefore, neither train is closer; they are both at the same distance from NYC.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Both trains are equally close to New York City when they meet.}} \\]"
