        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a car that travels the first half of its journey at 80 km/h and the second half at 100 km/h. We need to find the average speed for the entire journey.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, if I can find the total distance and the total time, I can calculate the average speed.\n\nLet's denote the total distance of the journey as D kilometers. That means the first half of the journey is D/2 kilometers, and the second half is also D/2 kilometers.\n\nNow, for the first half, the car travels at 80 km/h. To find the time taken for the first half, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, time for the first half, t1 = (D/2) / 80 hours.\n\nSimilarly, for the second half, the car travels at 100 km/h. So, time for the second half, t2 = (D/2) / 100 hours.\n\nNow, the total time taken for the entire journey is t1 + t2.\n\nTherefore, total time, T = (D/2)/80 + (D/2)/100.\n\nI can simplify this expression. Let's factor out D/2:\n\nT = (D/2) * (1/80 + 1/100).\n\nNow, to add 1/80 and 1/100, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 80 and 100 is 400.\n\nSo, 1/80 = 5/400 and 1/100 = 4/400.\n\nTherefore, 1/80 + 1/100 = 5/400 + 4/400 = 9/400.\n\nSo, T = (D/2) * (9/400) = (9D)/800 hours.\n\nNow, the total distance is D kilometers.\n\nTherefore, average speed = total distance / total time = D / [(9D)/800] = D * (800)/(9D) = 800/9 km/h.\n\nSimplifying 800/9, it's approximately 88.89 km/h.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's see. The car travels the first half at 80 km/h and the second half at 100 km/h. Since the halves are equal in distance, the average should be somewhere between 80 and 100, and probably closer to the lower speed because spending more time at the lower speed.\n\nBut 88.89 km/h seems a bit high. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nTotal time T = (D/2)/80 + (D/2)/100 = (D/160) + (D/200).\n\nTo add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 800.\n\nSo, D/160 = 5D/800 and D/200 = 4D/800.\n\nTherefore, T = 5D/800 + 4D/800 = 9D/800 hours.\n\nThen, average speed = D / (9D/800) = D * (800)/(9D) = 800/9 \u2248 88.89 km/h.\n\nHmm, it seems correct. But intuitively, I would think the average would be less than 90 km/h.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the harmonic mean for average speed, since it's dealing with rates.\n\nThe harmonic mean for two speeds over equal distances is given by 2/(1/v1 + 1/v2).\n\nSo, plugging in v1 = 80 km/h and v2 = 100 km/h:\n\nAverage speed = 2 / (1/80 + 1/100).\n\nAgain, 1/80 + 1/100 = 9/400, as before.\n\nSo, 2 / (9/400) = 2 * (400)/9 = 800/9 \u2248 88.89 km/h.\n\nAlright, so both methods give me the same answer. Maybe my intuition is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of time.\n\nLet\u2019s assume a specific distance for easier calculation. Let\u2019s say the total distance D is 800 km.\n\nThen, first half is 400 km at 80 km/h, time = 400/80 = 5 hours.\n\nSecond half is 400 km at 100 km/h, time = 400/100 = 4 hours.\n\nTotal time = 5 + 4 = 9 hours.\n\nTotal distance = 800 km.\n\nAverage speed = 800/9 \u2248 88.89 km/h.\n\nHmm, again the same answer.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overthinking it. The answer seems consistent across different methods.\n\nAlternatively, if the speeds were for equal times, then the average would be the arithmetic mean, but in this case, it's for equal distances.\n\nSo, for equal distances, the average speed is the harmonic mean, which is what I calculated.\n\nTherefore, the average speed for the entire journey is 800/9 km/h, which is approximately 88.89 km/h.\n\nBut to be precise, I should leave it as a fraction.\n\nSo, the exact average speed is 800/9 km/h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\dfrac{800}{9} \\text{ km/h} \\approx 88.89 \\text{ km/h}}\\]"
