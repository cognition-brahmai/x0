        "content": "Upon the boughs where Summer's garland hung,\nNow Autumn's palette doth her colors fling;\nA vermillion blaze, a golden glow that clung,\nIn emerald fields now paints the trees in spring.\n\nThe leaves, like painted fans, do gently sway,\nEach one a sonnet to the fading light;\nTheir hues, a testament to Summer's sway,\nNow turned to amber, crimson, and to white.\n\nThe wind, a minstrel with his hollow song,\nDoth rustle through the branches overhead,\nAnd scatter forth the leaves in dancing throng,\nAs Nature's own celestial ballet's spread.\n\nO, Autumn! Thy beauty doth transfix the eye,\nIn thee, we see the fleetingness of time,\nYet in thy leaves, a promise doth lie,\nOf rebirth, and the circle of life's chime.\n\nSo let us wander 'neath the canopied way,\nWhere leaves like confetti softly lay,\nAnd in their beauty, find a moment's stay,\nTo marvel at the world in golden array.\n\nFor in this season, when the air grows crisp,\nAnd daylight wanes, yet beauty doth abound,\nWe find in Autumn's leaves a heart's own whisper,\nOf nature's art, in every hue unbound.\n\nThus, as the leaves descend in graceful fall,\nWe witness not destruction, but a call,\nTo appreciate the transient, to stand tall,\nAnd cherish each moment, for time doth not stall.\n\nSo here's to Autumn, with her leaves so fair,\nA season of change, yet beauty beyond compare."
