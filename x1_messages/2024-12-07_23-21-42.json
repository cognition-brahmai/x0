        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\nHere's how you can implement bubble sort in Python:\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    # Traverse through all array elements\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Last i elements are already in place\n        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n            # Traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1\n            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element\n            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]\n    return arr\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing an array to it. For example:\n\n```python\narr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nsorted_arr = bubble_sort(arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array is:\", sorted_arr)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nSorted array is: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n```\n\nBubble sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm for large lists, but it's simple to understand and implement, which makes it a good starting point for learning about sorting algorithms."
