It is often cited as the birth of the modern state system and the beginning of the concept of sovereignty. The treaty established a balance of power among the states of Europe, preventing any single state from dominating the others. This concept of balance of power has been a fundamental principle in international relations ever since. What political theory is most closely associated with the balance of power principle?\nA.

        "content": "The political theory most closely associated with the balance of power principle is C. Realism.\n\nRealism in international relations emphasizes the role of power and security in state behavior. According to realist theory, states exist in an anarchic international system where there is no overarching authority above them, and thus they must rely on their own capabilities to ensure their survival and security. The balance of power is a key concept in realism, as it suggests that states will align themselves in such a way as to prevent any one state from becoming too powerful and dominating the system.\n\nIn the context of the Treaty of Westphalia, the establishment of a balance of power among European states was aimed at preventing any single state, particularly the Habsburg Monarchy, from gaining hegemony over the continent. This balance was achieved through alliances and power distributions that checked the ambitions of potentially dominant states.\n\nWhile other theories like liberalism, Marxism, constructivism, and others also contribute to our understanding of international relations, it is realism that places the greatest emphasis on the balance of power as a central principle governing state interactions in an anarchic international system."
