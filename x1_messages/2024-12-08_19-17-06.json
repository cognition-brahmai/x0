        "content": "So the airport wants to expand its runway capacity to handle more flights. Let's see what they've got here.\n\nRight now, there are two runways, and each can handle 20 flights per hour. So, the current total capacity is 2 runways times 20 flights per hour each, which is 40 flights per hour.\n\nThey're planning to add one more runway, making it three runways in total. The new runway should also handle 20 flights per hour, just like the others, right? So, with three runways, the total capacity would be 3 times 20, which is 60 flights per hour.\n\nNow, the problem says that this expansion would increase the airport's flight capacity by 50%. Let's check if that's correct.\n\nThe current capacity is 40 flights per hour. A 50% increase would be 40 plus half of 40, which is 20, so 60 flights per hour. Yeah, that matches what we just calculated.\n\nSo, after the expansion, the airport can handle 60 flights per hour.\n\nNow, to determine the percentage increase in hourly flight capacity, we already know it's 50%, but let's verify that.\n\nThe formula for percentage increase is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{new value} - \\text{old value}}{\\text{old value}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage increase} = \\left( \\frac{60 - 40}{40} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{20}{40} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 0.5 \\times 100\\% = 50\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, yes, the percentage increase in hourly flight capacity is 50%.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says that constructing an additional runway would increase capacity by 50%, and we've confirmed that. But is there anything else to consider? For example, do all runways operate at the same efficiency? Is there any congestion or other factors that might affect the overall capacity?\n\nAssuming that all runways are identical and operate independently without any interference, then adding a third runway should indeed increase the capacity by 50%.\n\nBut in real life, there might be other factors like air traffic control limitations, airport design, or physical space constraints that could affect the actual capacity. However, for the purpose of this problem, we're assuming that adding one more runway will simply add another 20 flights per hour, leading to a total of 60 flights per hour.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Current capacity: 2 runways \u00d7 20 flights/hour = 40 flights/hour\n\n- After expansion (3 runways): 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 flights/hour\n\n- Percentage increase: 50%\n\nI think that's straightforward. Is there anything else I need to consider here?\n\nHmm, maybe I should think about the units. Flights per hour seems clear. Are there any other units or conversions I need to worry about? Nope, seems straightforward.\n\nAlso, is there a possibility that the new runway has different capacity than the existing ones? The problem says \"an additional runway, which would increase the airport's flight capacity by 50%,\" so it implies that the new runway adds capacity proportional to increase.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the new runway is designed to handle more or less flights per hour. But based on the information given, it seems that all runways handle 20 flights per hour.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the increase is 50%, so the new runway must be contributing that 50% increase.\n\nLet's think about it differently.\n\nIf the current capacity is 40 flights per hour, and adding one runway increases that by 50%, which is 20 flights per hour (since 50% of 40 is 20), then the new total capacity would be 40 + 20 = 60 flights per hour.\n\nTherefore, the new runway must be handling 20 flights per hour to achieve that 50% increase.\n\nSo, either way, it seems consistent.\n\nIs there another way to look at this?\n\nSuppose the capacity per runway is not 20 flights per hour, but something else. Let's denote the capacity per runway as R flights per hour.\n\nCurrently, with 2 runways, total capacity is 2R.\n\nAfter adding one more runway, total capacity becomes 3R.\n\nThe problem states that this increases capacity by 50%.\n\nSo, the increase is 3R - 2R = R, and this R is equal to 50% of the original capacity, which is 2R.\n\nWait, 50% of 2R is R, which matches the increase.\n\nSo, this confirms that the expansion leads to a 50% increase in capacity.\n\nBut the problem also gives specific numbers: current capacity is 2 runways at 20 flights per hour each.\n\nSo, 2R = 40 flights per hour.\n\nTherefore, R = 20 flights per hour.\n\nAfter expansion, 3R = 60 flights per hour.\n\nPercentage increase is (3R - 2R)/2R = R/2R = 0.5 = 50%.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nI think the answer is straightforward: after expansion, the airport can handle 60 flights per hour, which is a 50% increase from the original 40 flights per hour.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any constraints or if the runways are used for takeoffs and landings separately.\n\nIn reality, runways can be used for both takeoffs and landings, but there are safety separations and scheduling constraints.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume that each runway can handle 20 flights per hour, regardless of whether they are takeoffs or landings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 20 flights per hour include both takeoffs and landings.\n\nBut again, without specific information, I'll proceed with the given numbers.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after the expansion, the airport can handle 60 flights per hour, which is a 50% increase from the original capacity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60 \\text{ flights per hour, } 50\\% \\text{ increase}} \\]"
