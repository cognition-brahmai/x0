        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is (8^2 - 4) / (12 - 3 * 2). First, I need to calculate the numerator and the denominator separately, and then divide them.\n\nStarting with the numerator: 8^2 - 4.\n\n8^2 means 8 squared, which is 64. So, 64 - 4 equals 60.\n\nNow, the denominator: 12 - 3 * 2.\n\nI need to remember the order of operations, which is PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction).\n\nIn the denominator, there's multiplication before subtraction. So, 3 * 2 equals 6.\n\nThen, 12 - 6 equals 6.\n\nNow, the expression simplifies to 60 / 6, which equals 10.\n\nSo, the answer is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
