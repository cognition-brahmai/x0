Alright, let's start by recalling the definitions of compactness and sequential compactness.\n\nA set is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover. Sequential compactness, on the other hand, means that every sequence in the set has a convergent subsequence that converges to a point within the set.\n\nSo, the goal is to show that if a set is compact, then it's sequentially compact.\n\nLet's consider a compact set K in a metric space (X, d). Take any sequence {x_n} in K. We need to show that there exists a subsequence {x_{n_k}} that converges to some point in K.\n\nOne approach is to consider the closure of the set of points in the sequence. Since K is compact and closed sets in a metric space are closed, perhaps we can use that.\n\nWait, actually, in a metric space, compactness is equivalent to being complete and totally bounded. Maybe I can use that.\n\nBut I should stick to the definition. So, starting with an open cover.\n\nLet's think about open covers of K. Since K is compact, every open cover has a finite subcover.\n\nNow, consider the sequence {x_n} in K. If the sequence has only finitely many distinct points, then some point must repeat infinitely often, and we can take that as our convergent subsequence.\n\nBut if the sequence has infinitely many distinct points, things get trickier.\n\nSuppose {x_n} has infinitely many distinct points. I need to find a convergent subsequence.\n\nMaybe I can use the fact that in a compact metric space, every infinite subset has a limit point in K.\n\nYes, that sounds familiar. So, if {x_n} has infinitely many distinct points, then the set of these points has a limit point in K.\n\nLet's recall that in a metric space, a limit point of a set A is a point x such that every neighborhood of x contains a point of A different from x.\n\nSo, if I can show that the sequence {x_n} has a subsequence converging to this limit point, then I'm done.\n\nLet's denote the limit point as x \u2208 K.\n\nNow, I need to construct a subsequence {x_{n_k}} that converges to x.\n\nTo do this, for each k \u2208 N, choose n_k such that x_{n_k} \u2208 B(x, 1/k) and n_k > n_{k-1}, with n_0 = 0.\n\nSince x is a limit point, for each k, the ball B(x, 1/k) contains infinitely many points of the sequence {x_n}, because otherwise, there would be some neighborhood of x containing only finitely many points of the sequence, contradicting the fact that x is a limit point.\n\nTherefore, I can always find such n_k's inductively.\n\nThus, the subsequence {x_{n_k}} converges to x, as d(x_{n_k}, x) < 1/k for each k, and 1/k \u2192 0 as k \u2192 \u221e.\n\nHence, every sequence in K has a convergent subsequence in K, which means K is sequentially compact.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that this limit point x is in K. Since K is compact, and in a metric space, compact sets are closed, so K contains all its limit points. Therefore, x \u2208 K.\n\nSo, this completes the proof.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this using open covers directly.\n\nSuppose {x_n} is a sequence in K. Assume that {x_n} has no convergent subsequence in K.\n\nThen, for every point x \u2208 K, there exists a neighborhood U_x of x such that only finitely many x_n's are in U_x.\n\nNow, the collection {U_x : x \u2208 K} forms an open cover of K.\n\nSince K is compact, there exists a finite subcover, say U_{x1}, U_{x2}, ..., U_{xm}.\n\nBut then, the sequence {x_n} can have only finitely many points in each U_{xi}, and since there are finitely many U_{xi}, the entire sequence has only finitely many points in the union of these U_{xi}, which is K.\n\nBut {x_n} is a sequence in K, so it has infinitely many points, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that {x_n} has no convergent subsequence in K must be false.\n\nHence, every sequence in K has a convergent subsequence in K, which means K is sequentially compact.\n\nThis seems another way to prove it, using open covers directly.\n\nI think both approaches are valid, but the first one using limit points might be more straightforward.\n\nIn summary, in a metric space, compactness implies sequential compactness.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{In a metric space, a compact set is sequentially compact.}}"
