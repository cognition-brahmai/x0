        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a box with 8 red balls and 7 blue balls, and I need to find the probability of picking a red ball at random. Okay, probability is basically the chance of something happening, right? So in this case, the chance of picking a red ball.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of balls in the box. There are 8 red and 7 blue, so total balls would be 8 plus 7, which is 15 balls.\n\nNow, probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this scenario, the favorable outcome is picking a red ball, and the total outcomes are the total number of balls.\n\nSo, the probability P of picking a red ball is:\n\nP(red) = Number of red balls / Total number of balls\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nP(red) = 8 / 15\n\nThat's the simplest form, I think, because 8 and 15 don't have any common factors besides 1.\n\nTo double-check, I can think about it differently. If I have 15 balls and 8 of them are red, then each ball has an equal chance of being picked since it's random. So, the chance of getting a red ball is indeed 8 out of 15.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in percentages. To find the percentage chance, I could divide 8 by 15 and multiply by 100.\n\nLet's see:\n\n(8 \u00f7 15) \u00d7 100 \u2248 53.33%\n\nSo, there's approximately a 53.33% chance of picking a red ball.\n\nBut since the question asks for probability, I should stick with the fraction form, which is 8/15.\n\nI don't think there's anything else I need to consider here. The problem is straightforward: just finding the probability of one event with given numbers.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider whether the balls are being replaced or not, but the question says \"pick one ball,\" so it's just a single pick. No replacement involved.\n\nAlso, it says \"without looking,\" which confirms that it's a random pick, so each ball has an equal chance.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The probability is 8/15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{8}{15}} \\]"
