        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a square garden with an area of 256 square feet, and I need to figure out how much fencing I'll need to go around it. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, since it's a square garden, all four sides are equal in length. The area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one side, right? So, if the area is 256 square feet, that means the length of one side squared equals 256. Mathematically, that's side length times itself equals 256, or side\u00b2 = 256.\n\nTo find the side length, I need to take the square root of both sides. The square root of 256 should be... let's see, 16 times 16 is 256, so the side length is 16 feet.\n\nNow, to find out how much fencing is needed, I need to calculate the perimeter of the square. The perimeter of a square is the sum of all four sides. Since all sides are equal, it's just 4 times the side length.\n\nSo, perimeter = 4 \u00d7 side length = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 feet.\n\nTherefore, you'll need 64 feet of fencing to go around the entire garden.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Just to double-check. If the area is 256 square feet and it's a square, then yes, side length is 16 feet, and perimeter is 64 feet. That seems solid.\n\nAnother way to think about it: if you were to walk around the garden along the edges, covering the entire perimeter, you'd walk 64 feet. That makes sense.\n\nAlright, I think that's the answer. 64 feet of fencing is what you'll need.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{64} \\]"
