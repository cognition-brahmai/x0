        "content": "Given the scenario, the mathematician is dealing with a system of linear equations that is consistent, meaning there is at least one solution, and the equations are linearly independent, meaning no equation can be derived from the others. Additionally, the system is underdetermined, which means there are more variables than equations.\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Consistent System**: This means that the system has at least one solution. In other words, the equations do not contradict each other.\n\n2. **Linearly Independent Equations**: This means that each equation provides new information. None of the equations can be obtained by a linear combination of the others.\n\n3. **Underdetermined System**: This means that there are fewer equations than variables. For example, if there are 2 equations and 3 variables, the system is underdetermined.\n\nGiven these conditions, what can we say about the number of solutions?\n\n- In a system where the number of equations is equal to the number of variables, and the equations are linearly independent, there is typically a unique solution.\n\n- When there are more equations than variables, the system might be overdetermined, leading possibly to no solution if the equations are inconsistent.\n\n- However, in an underdetermined system, where there are fewer equations than variables, and the system is consistent and the equations are linearly independent, there are infinitely many solutions.\n\nThis is because with more variables than equations, there are degrees of freedom in the system. Some variables can be chosen freely, and the others can be expressed in terms of these free variables.\n\nTherefore, the likely outcome of her problem-solving process is that she will find infinitely many solutions.\n\nSo, the answer is B. She will find infinitely many solutions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
