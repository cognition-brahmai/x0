        "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you calculate the compound interest on your investment. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand what compound interest is. Compound interest is interest calculated on the initial principal, which also includes all of the accumulated interest from previous periods on a deposit or loan. Basically, it's \"interest on interest,\" and it makes a sum grow at a faster rate than simple interest, which is calculated only on the principal amount.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is:\n\nA = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.\n\nNow, let's plug in the values from your question:\n\n- P = $5,000\n\n- r = 4% per year, which is 0.04 in decimal form\n\n- n = quarterly compounding, which means 4 times a year\n\n- t = 5 years\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n\nA = 5000 (1 + 0.04/4)^(4*5)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the interest rate per compounding period:\n\nr/n = 0.04 / 4 = 0.01\n\nNext, calculate 1 + (r/n):\n\n1 + 0.01 = 1.01\n\nNow, raise this to the power of nt:\n\nnt = 4 * 5 = 20\n\nSo, (1.01)^20\n\nTo calculate this, you can use a calculator or a spreadsheet. Using a calculator, 1.01 to the power of 20 is approximately 1.22019.\n\nNow, multiply this by the principal amount:\n\nA = 5000 * 1.22019 = 6100.95\n\nSo, the total amount after 5 years is approximately $6,100.95.\n\nTo find the compound interest earned, subtract the principal from this amount:\n\nCompound Interest = A - P = 6100.95 - 5000 = $1,100.95\n\nTherefore, the compound interest earned on a $5,000 investment over five years with an annual interest rate of 4%, compounded quarterly, is approximately $1,100.95.\n\nIt's worth noting that if the interest was compounded annually, semi-annually, or monthly, the amount would be different because the frequency of compounding affects the total interest earned. In this case, since it's compounded quarterly, the interest is added four times a year, which leads to more frequent compounding and thus a higher final amount compared to less frequent compounding periods.\n\nI hope this step-by-step explanation helps you understand how to calculate compound interest.
