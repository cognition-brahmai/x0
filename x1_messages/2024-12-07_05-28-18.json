        "content": "So I've got this probability question here: \"You flip a fair coin three times. What is the probability that you get heads exactly twice? Include your logic.\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First off, I know that a fair coin has two sides: heads and tails, and each side has an equal chance of landing face up. So, the probability of getting heads in a single flip is 1/2, and the same for tails.\n\nNow, I need to flip the coin three times and find out the probability of getting exactly two heads. Okay, so let's think about all the possible outcomes when flipping a coin three times.\n\nEach flip is independent of the others, meaning the outcome of one flip doesn't affect the outcome of the next flip. So, for three flips, the total number of possible outcomes is 2 options for the first flip, times 2 for the second, times 2 for the third, which is 2^3 = 8 possible outcomes.\n\nLet's list them out to visualize it better:\n\n1. Heads, Heads, Heads (HHH)\n\n2. Heads, Heads, Tails (HHT)\n\n3. Heads, Tails, Heads (HTH)\n\n4. Heads, Tails, Tails (HTT)\n\n5. Tails, Heads, Heads (THH)\n\n6. Tails, Heads, Tails (THT)\n\n7. Tails, Tails, Heads (TTH)\n\n8. Tails, Tails, Tails (TTT)\n\nSo, there are 8 possible sequences of heads and tails in three flips.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of these sequences that have exactly two heads. Let's look at the list:\n\n- HHT: two heads, one tail\n\n- HTH: two heads, one tail\n\n- THH: two heads, one tail\n\n- HTT: one head, two tails\n\n- THT: one head, two tails\n\n- TTH: one head, two tails\n\n- HHH: three heads\n\n- TTT: three tails\n\nFrom this, I can see that there are three sequences that have exactly two heads: HHT, HTH, and THH.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 3, and the total number of possible outcomes is 8. Therefore, the probability of getting exactly two heads in three flips is 3/8.\n\nBut let's double-check this using another method to ensure I'm not missing anything. I can use the binomial probability formula for this. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(k successes in n trials) = (n choose k) * (p)^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 3 flips),\n\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 2 heads),\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial (for a fair coin, p = 1/2),\n\n- (n choose k) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose k successes out of n trials.\n\nFirst, let's calculate (n choose k), which is \"3 choose 2\". The formula for the binomial coefficient is:\n\n(n choose k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nSo, (3 choose 2) = 3! / (2!(3 - 2)!) = (6) / (2 * 1) = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nOkay, so there are 3 ways to get exactly 2 heads in 3 flips, which matches what I found earlier by listing out the sequences.\n\nNext, p = 1/2, and since it's a fair coin, 1 - p = 1/2.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nP(2 heads in 3 flips) = (3) * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^(3-2) = 3 * (1/4) * (1/2) = 3 * (1/8) = 3/8\n\nSo, again, I get 3/8.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to look at this. For example, could I consider the probability of getting heads twice and tails once in any order?\n\nWell, that's essentially what I did. I considered the number of ways to arrange two heads and one tail in three flips, which is the same as the binomial coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of each specific sequence that has exactly two heads. Since each flip is independent, the probability of any specific sequence of heads and tails is (1/2)^3 = 1/8.\n\nSince there are three such sequences (HHT, HTH, THH), the total probability is 3 * (1/8) = 3/8.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach it, I keep arriving at the same answer: 3/8.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting exactly two heads in three flips of a fair coin is 3/8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{8}} \\]"
