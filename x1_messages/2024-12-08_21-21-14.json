        "content": "So I've got this problem here: At a party, everyone shakes hands exactly once with every other person, and there were 66 handshakes in total. I need to figure out how many people were at the party. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I think about what's being asked. We have a group of people, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. The total number of handshakes is 66, and I need to find out how many people are in the group.\n\nI recall that this kind of problem is related to combinations. Specifically, it's about choosing pairs of people from a group, since a handshake involves two people. So, if there are n people at the party, the number of possible handshakes is the number of ways to choose 2 people out of n, which is denoted as C(n, 2) or \"n choose 2\".\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nIn this case, k is 2, since we're choosing pairs. So, C(n, 2) = n! / (2! * (n - 2)!) = (n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)! ) / (2 * 1 * (n - 2)! ) = (n * (n - 1)) / 2\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes is (n * (n - 1)) / 2 = 66\n\nNow, I need to solve for n in the equation:\n\n(n * (n - 1)) / 2 = 66\n\nFirst, I can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\nn * (n - 1) = 132\n\nNow, let's expand the left side:\n\nn\u00b2 - n = 132\n\nTo form a standard quadratic equation, I'll move 132 to the left side:\n\nn\u00b2 - n - 132 = 0\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for n. I can either factor it, complete the square, or use the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first.\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to -132 and add up to -1. Hmm, let's think:\n\nPossible factor pairs of 132 are:\n\n1 and 132\n\n2 and 66\n\n3 and 44\n\n4 and 33\n\n6 and 22\n\n11 and 12\n\nNow, considering the signs, since we have -132 and -1, we need one positive and one negative number that multiply to -132 and add to -1.\n\nLet's consider 11 and 12: 11 * 12 = 132. If I take -12 and 11, their product is -132 and their sum is -12 + 11 = -1. That works!\n\nSo, I can factor the quadratic as:\n\n(n - 12)(n + 11) = 0\n\nSetting each factor to zero gives:\n\nn - 12 = 0 => n = 12\n\nn + 11 = 0 => n = -11\n\nBut n represents the number of people, which can't be negative, so n = 12.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this. Maybe I can use another method to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the quadratic formula:\n\nn = [1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 528)] / 2 = [1 \u00b1 \u221a529] / 2 = [1 \u00b1 23] / 2\n\nSo, n = (1 + 23)/2 = 24/2 = 12\n\nOr n = (1 - 23)/2 = -22/2 = -11\n\nAgain, n = 12 is the valid solution.\n\nLet me verify this by plugging it back into the original equation.\n\nC(12, 2) = (12 * 11) / 2 = 66\n\nYes, that matches the given number of handshakes.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way is to think about the handshakes in a different manner. Imagine each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. So, if there are n people, each person shakes hands with (n - 1) others.\n\nBut since each handshake involves two people, we've double-counted if we simply do n * (n - 1). Therefore, the total number of unique handshakes is n * (n - 1) / 2, which again gives us the combination formula C(n, 2).\n\nSo, we're back to the same equation: n * (n - 1) / 2 = 66\n\nSolving this as before leads to n = 12.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a graph theory problem, where each person is a vertex and each handshake is an edge. The problem then becomes finding the number of vertices in a complete graph where the number of edges is 66.\n\nIn graph theory, the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is C(n, 2) = n(n - 1)/2, which again brings us to the same equation.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I arrive at n = 12.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other possible interpretation of the problem. For example, maybe some people didn't shake hands with everyone, or perhaps there's a restriction I'm missing. But the problem states that \"everyone shook hands exactly once with every other person,\" so it's a straightforward complete graph scenario.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list out the handshakes for smaller numbers and see if there's a pattern.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If there are 2 people, there's 1 handshake.\n\n- If there are 3 people, there are 3 handshakes.\n\n- If there are 4 people, there are 6 handshakes.\n\n- If there are 5 people, there are 10 handshakes.\n\n- If there are 6 people, there are 15 handshakes.\n\n- If there are 7 people, there are 21 handshakes.\n\n- If there are 8 people, there are 28 handshakes.\n\n- If there are 9 people, there are 36 handshakes.\n\n- If there are 10 people, there are 45 handshakes.\n\n- If there are 11 people, there are 55 handshakes.\n\n- If there are 12 people, there are 66 handshakes.\n\nYes, this matches our earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the sum of the first (n - 1) natural numbers, since each person shakes hands with all the others.\n\nThe sum of the first (n - 1) natural numbers is (n - 1) * n / 2, which is the same as C(n, 2).\n\nAgain, this confirms that n = 12.\n\nI think I've approached this problem from multiple angles and consistently arrived at the same answer: there were 12 people at the party.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider if there could be a different interpretation of the problem.\n\nSuppose that the handshakes didn't happen in a complete graph fashion, but perhaps there were some restrictions. But the problem specifically says \"everyone shook hands exactly once with every other person,\" so there are no restrictions; it's a complete graph.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether handshakes can happen between the same pair multiple times, but the problem says \"exactly once,\" so that's not the case.\n\nAlso, ensure that there are no redundant handshakes or any special conditions, but again, the problem is straightforward.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 12 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
