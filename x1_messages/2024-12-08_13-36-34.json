        "content": "So, I have this problem here: a train travels at an average speed of 80 miles per hour and takes 6 hours to complete its journey. I need to find out the distance traveled by the train. Hmm, I remember that there's a formula that connects speed, time, and distance. Is it something like distance equals speed multiplied by time? Let me think about that.\n\nOkay, so if speed is measured in miles per hour and time is in hours, then multiplying them should give me the distance in miles. So, 80 mph times 6 hours should be 480 miles. That seems straightforward. But wait, maybe I should double-check if there's any other factor I need to consider, like acceleration or something. But the problem says it's an average speed, so maybe constant speed is assumed.\n\nLet me recall the basic formula for distance when speed and time are known. Yeah, it's definitely distance equals speed multiplied by time, or d = s * t. So, plugging in the values, d = 80 mph * 6 h = 480 miles. That should be it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider the units to ensure they cancel out correctly. Speed is in miles per hour, and time is in hours, so when I multiply them, the hours unit cancels out, leaving miles, which is the unit for distance. That makes sense.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using graphs or something. I've heard that distance can be represented as the area under the speed-time graph. If I plot speed on the y-axis and time on the x-axis, then the area under the curve would give me the distance. In this case, since the speed is constant at 80 mph over 6 hours, the graph would be a rectangle with height 80 and width 6. The area of that rectangle is again 80 times 6, which is 480 miles. So, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlright, I think I'm confident with this answer. The train travels a distance of 480 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{480} \\]"
