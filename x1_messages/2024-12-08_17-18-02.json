        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a rectangular room is 15 feet long and 12 feet wide, and I need to find out what the area is in square yards. Okay, first things first, I know that area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, in this case, it would be 15 feet times 12 feet.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 15 times 12. Well, 15 times 10 is 150, and 15 times 2 is 30, so total is 180 square feet. That makes sense.\n\nBut the question asks for the area in square yards, not square feet. So, I need to convert square feet to square yards. I recall that 1 yard is equal to 3 feet. Therefore, 1 square yard would be 3 feet by 3 feet, which is 9 square feet.\n\nSo, to convert from square feet to square yards, I should divide the number of square feet by 9, right? Because there are 9 square feet in 1 square yard.\n\nSo, taking the area in square feet, which is 180, and dividing by 9 to get square yards: 180 divided by 9 is 20. So, the area should be 20 square yards.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Perhaps I can convert the measurements from feet to yards before multiplying.\n\nOkay, so the length is 15 feet, and since 1 yard is 3 feet, 15 feet divided by 3 is 5 yards. Similarly, the width is 12 feet, which divided by 3 is 4 yards.\n\nNow, multiplying the length and width in yards: 5 yards times 4 yards equals 20 square yards. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, that gives me more confidence that 20 square yards is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about the units. When I have feet times feet, I get square feet. To get to square yards, I need to divide by the number of square feet in a square yard, which is 9, as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, converting each dimension to yards first and then multiplying also gives me the same result. So, both methods confirm that the area is 20 square yards.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. Maybe the tricky part is remembering to convert the units correctly, especially since feet and yards are related by a factor of 3, but when it comes to area, it's squared, so it's a factor of 9.\n\nIt's always good to double-check the unit conversions to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. In this case, both methods give me the same answer, so I can be confident.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
