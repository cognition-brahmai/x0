        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with marbles: 5 red, 3 blue, and 7 green. So, total marbles in the bag are 5 + 3 + 7, which is 15 marbles.\n\nThe question is, if you pick two marbles without replacement, what's the probability that both are green. Okay, so without replacement means once you pick the first marble, it stays out, and you pick the second one from the remaining marbles.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many ways there are to pick two green marbles out of the seven that are green. And then, divide that by the total number of ways to pick any two marbles out of the 15.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose two green marbles from seven is combination of 7 taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number you're choosing.\n\nSo, C(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * (7 - 2)!) = (7 * 6 * 5!) / (2 * 1 * 5!) = (7 * 6) / 2 = 21.\n\nSo, there are 21 ways to choose two green marbles.\n\nNow, the total number of ways to choose any two marbles out of 15 is C(15, 2).\n\nC(15, 2) = 15! / (2! * 13!) = (15 * 14 * 13!) / (2 * 1 * 13!)= (15 * 14) / 2 = 105.\n\nSo, there are 105 ways to choose any two marbles from the bag.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both marbles are green is the number of ways to choose two green marbles divided by the total number of ways to choose any two marbles.\n\nSo, probability = 21 / 105 = 1/5 = 0.2.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of sequential probabilities.\n\nThe probability that the first marble picked is green is 7 out of 15, since there are 7 green marbles and 15 total marbles.\n\nSo, P(first green) = 7/15.\n\nNow, since we're not replacing the first marble, there are now 14 marbles left in the bag, and 6 of them are green.\n\nSo, P(second green | first green) = 6/14 = 3/7.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both marbles are green is P(first green) * P(second green | first green) = (7/15) * (3/7) = (7 * 3) / (15 * 7) = 21 / 105 = 1/5 = 0.2.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nWait a minute, I should check if there's another way to look at this to confirm.\n\nLet's see, another approach could be to use permutations instead of combinations.\n\nIf I consider the order in which I pick the marbles, then:\n\nThe probability that the first marble is green is 7/15, as before.\n\nThe probability that the second marble is green, given the first was green, is 6/14 = 3/7.\n\nMultiplying them gives (7/15) * (3/7) = 1/5, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the total number of ordered pairs of marbles, it's P(15, 2) = 15 * 14 = 210.\n\nThe number of ordered pairs where both are green is P(7, 2) = 7 * 6 = 42.\n\nSo, probability = 42 / 210 = 1/5 = 0.2.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there anything in the problem that could suggest dependency or any other condition that I haven't accounted for?\n\nThe problem says \"randomly pick two marbles without replacement.\" It doesn't mention any bias in the selection process or any other conditions regarding the marbles.\n\nSo, assuming each marble is equally likely to be picked, and the picks are independent except for the absence of replacement, my calculation should be correct.\n\nAlso, checking the total number of marbles: 5 red + 3 blue + 7 green = 15, which matches what I used.\n\nSo, I don't think there's anything missing here.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both marbles picked are green is 1/5 or 0.2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.2} \\]"
