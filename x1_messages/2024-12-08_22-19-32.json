Find the net profit by subtracting total expenses from total revenue.\n4. Calculate the profit margin by dividing the net profit by the total revenue and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.\n\nGiven data:\n\n- Annual revenue: $500,000\n\n- Expenses:\n\n- Salaries: $300,000\n\n- Rent: $50,000\n\n- Utilities: $20,000\n\n- Marketing: $80,000\n\nFirst, I'll add up all the expenses:\n\nTotal expenses = Salaries + Rent + Utilities + Marketing\n\nTotal expenses = $300,000 + $50,000 + $20,000 + $80,000\n\nTotal expenses = $450,000\n\nNext, I'll calculate the net profit:\n\nNet profit = Total revenue - Total expenses\n\nNet profit = $500,000 - $450,000\n\nNet profit = $50,000\n\nNow, I'll calculate the profit margin:\n\nProfit margin (%) = (Net profit / Total revenue) * 100\n\nProfit margin (%) = ($50,000 / $500,000) * 100\n\nProfit margin (%) = 0.1 * 100\n\nProfit margin (%) = 10%\n\nSo, the company's profit margin is 10%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10\\%} \\]"
