        "content": "So I've got this problem here about finding the surface area of a rectangular prism. The dimensions given are: length is 6 inches, width is 4 inches, and height is 2 inches. I need to find out what its surface area is.\n\nFirst off, I need to remember what a rectangular prism is. It's basically a box shape with six faces, all of which are rectangles. The surface area should be the total area of all these six faces combined.\n\nI recall that there's a formula for the surface area of a rectangular prism, but to be honest, I don't have it memorized. Maybe I can derive it or think about it logically. Let's see.\n\nThere are three pairs of identical faces on a rectangular prism:\n\n1. The front and back faces\n\n2. The left and right faces\n\n3. The top and bottom faces\n\nSo, if I can find the area of one face from each pair and then double it (since there are two of each), and finally add them all up, that should give me the total surface area.\n\nLet's identify each pair:\n\n1. Front and back faces: These are the faces that have the length and height as their dimensions. So, the area of one of these faces is length times height, which is 6 inches times 2 inches, equaling 12 square inches. Since there are two such faces, their combined area is 2 times 12, which is 24 square inches.\n\n2. Left and right faces: These faces have the width and height as their dimensions. So, the area of one of these faces is width times height, which is 4 inches times 2 inches, equaling 8 square inches. Again, there are two such faces, so their combined area is 2 times 8, which is 16 square inches.\n\n3. Top and bottom faces: These faces have the length and width as their dimensions. So, the area of one of these faces is length times width, which is 6 inches times 4 inches, equaling 24 square inches. And with two such faces, their combined area is 2 times 24, which is 48 square inches.\n\nNow, to find the total surface area, I need to add up the areas of all these pairs:\n\n24 square inches (front and back) + 16 square inches (left and right) + 48 square inches (top and bottom) = 88 square inches.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFront and back: 6 inches * 2 inches = 12 sq in each, times 2 is 24 sq in.\n\nLeft and right: 4 inches * 2 inches = 8 sq in each, times 2 is 16 sq in.\n\nTop and bottom: 6 inches * 4 inches = 24 sq in each, times 2 is 48 sq in.\n\nAdding them up: 24 + 16 + 48 = 88 square inches.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be sure, maybe I can recall the standard formula for the surface area of a rectangular prism.\n\nI think the formula is SA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh, where l is length, w is width, and h is height.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nSA = 2*(6*4) + 2*(6*2) + 2*(4*2) = 2*(24) + 2*(12) + 2*(8) = 48 + 24 + 16 = 88 square inches.\n\nOkay, that matches what I calculated earlier. Good, it's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that another way to think about the surface area of a rectangular prism is to imagine it as a net, which is the shape it would make if you unfolded it into a 2D figure. The net would consist of six rectangles: two of each pair as I mentioned before.\n\nIf I were to draw this net, I would have:\n\n- Two rectangles of 6 inches by 4 inches (top and bottom)\n\n- Two rectangles of 6 inches by 2 inches (front and back)\n\n- Two rectangles of 4 inches by 2 inches (left and right)\n\nAdding up their areas would again give me 2*(6*4) + 2*(6*2) + 2*(4*2) = 48 + 24 + 16 = 88 square inches.\n\nThis reinforces that my calculation is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can consider another approach. Let's think about the surface area in terms of the dimensions.\n\nThe formula SA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh is the standard one, and I've used it already. Alternatively, I could factor it differently: SA = 2(lw + lh + wh).\n\nPlugging in the values: SA = 2*(6*4 + 6*2 + 4*2) = 2*(24 + 12 + 8) = 2*(44) = 88 square inches.\n\nAgain, the same result. This gives me confidence that 88 square inches is the correct surface area.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Sometimes, people might confusion between volume and surface area, but in this case, the question clearly asks for surface area, so that's not an issue.\n\nAlso, ensure that all measurements are in the same units, which they are (all in inches), so no conversion is needed.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The surface area of the rectangular prism is 88 square inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{88} \\]"
