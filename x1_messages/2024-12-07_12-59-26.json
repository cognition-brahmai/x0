        "content": "Alright, I need to find out the population of Tokyo and some famous landmarks there. I have three tools: GoogleSearch, PageScraper, and QuestionSolver. I think I should start by searching for the information using GoogleSearch.\n\n**Step 1:** Use GoogleSearch to find the population of Tokyo and its famous landmarks.\n\nTo do this, I'll input a query like \"population of Tokyo and famous landmarks\" into GoogleSearch.\n\n#Evidence1 = GoogleSearch[\"population of Tokyo and famous landmarks\"]\n\nOnce I have the search results, I need to scrape the relevant pages for more detailed information. So, next, I'll use PageScraper on the top URLs from the search results.\n\n**Step 2:** Use PageScraper to extract information from the top URLs provided by GoogleSearch.\n\nI'll select the first few URLs from #Evidence1 and pass them to PageScraper.\n\n#Evidence2 = PageScraper[#Evidence1.urls[0:3]]\n\nNow, with the scraped text from these pages, I need to find specific answers to the user's questions. That's where QuestionSolver comes in. I'll use it to extract the population figure and list some famous landmarks.\n\n**Step 3:** Use QuestionSolver to find the population of Tokyo from the scraped text.\n\nInput: \"What is the population of Tokyo?\"\n\nContext: #Evidence2\n\n#Evidence3 = QuestionSolver[\"What is the population of Tokyo?\", context=#Evidence2]\n\n**Step 4:** Use QuestionSolver again to find famous landmarks in Tokyo.\n\nInput: \"What are some famous landmarks in Tokyo?\"\n\nContext: #Evidence2\n\n#Evidence4 = QuestionSolver[\"What are some famous landmarks in Tokyo?\", context=#Evidence2]\n\nFinally, I'll compile the answers from #Evidence3 and #Evidence4 to form a complete response to the user.\n\n**Answer:** According to my sources, the population of Tokyo is [population figure from #Evidence3], and some famous landmarks there include [list of landmarks from #Evidence4]."
