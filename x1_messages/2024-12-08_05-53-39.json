On average, each gate handles 6 flights per day, with an average of 150 passengers per flight. With the additional gates, the airport expects to increase the number of flights per gate to 8 per day. Calculate the total number of passengers the expanded airport can handle daily, as well as the percentage increase in passenger capacity compared to the current situation. Explain your reasoning."

        "content": "So the airport is expanding and they're adding more gates to handle more flights and passengers. Let's see what the question is asking and how to approach it.\n\nFirst, there are currently 20 gates, and they're adding 15 more, so the total number of gates after expansion will be:\n\n20 (current) + 15 (new) = 35 gates\n\nOkay, now, currently, each gate handles 6 flights per day, with an average of 150 passengers per flight. So, for the current setup:\n\nNumber of flights per day = 20 gates * 6 flights/gate = 120 flights/day\n\nNumber of passengers per day = 120 flights/day * 150 passengers/flight = 18,000 passengers/day\n\nNow, after the expansion, the number of flights per gate is increasing to 8 per day. So,\n\nNumber of flights per day after expansion = 35 gates * 8 flights/gate = 280 flights/day\n\nAssuming the average number of passengers per flight remains the same at 150, the total number of passengers after expansion would be:\n\n280 flights/day * 150 passengers/flight = 42,000 passengers/day\n\nSo, the expanded airport can handle 42,000 passengers daily.\n\nNow, to find the percentage increase in passenger capacity, we can use the formula:\n\nPercentage increase = (New capacity - Old capacity) / Old capacity * 100%\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nPercentage increase = (42,000 - 18,000) / 18,000 * 100% = (24,000 / 18,000) * 100% = 1.333... * 100% \u2248 133.33%\n\nSo, the passenger capacity is increasing by approximately 133.33%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nCurrent:\n\n20 gates * 6 flights/gate = 120 flights/day\n\n120 flights/day * 150 passengers/flight = 18,000 passengers/day\n\nAfter expansion:\n\n35 gates * 8 flights/gate = 280 flights/day\n\n280 flights/day * 150 passengers/flight = 42,000 passengers/day\n\nPercentage increase:\n\n(42,000 - 18,000) / 18,000 * 100% = 24,000 / 18,000 * 100% = 1.333... * 100% = 133.33%\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about it in terms of gate capacity.\n\nEach current gate handles 6 flights/day * 150 passengers/fligh t= 900 passengers/gate/day\n\nAfter expansion, each gate will handle 8 flights/day * 150 passengers/flight = 1,200 passengers/gate/day\n\nSo, per gate, there's an increase from 900 to 1,200 passengers per day, which is an increase of 300 passengers per gate.\n\nBut since the number of gates is also increasing, we need to calculate the total capacity.\n\nCurrent total capacity: 20 gates * 900 passengers/gate/day = 18,000 passengers/day\n\nExpanded total capacity: 35 gates * 1,200 passengers/gate/day = 42,000 passengers/day\n\nAgain, the percentage increase is (42,000 - 18,000)/18,000 * 100% = 133.33%\n\nSo, the expanded airport can handle 42,000 passengers daily, which is a 133.33% increase from the current capacity of 18,000 passengers per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{42000 \\text{ passengers/day, } 133.33\\% \\text{ increase}} \\]"
