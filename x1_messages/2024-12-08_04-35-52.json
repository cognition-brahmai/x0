        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have 100 houses, each numbered from 1 to 100. Every day, the postman delivers mail to exactly half of them, which is 50 houses, but with the condition that he never delivers mail to two consecutive houses on the same day. We need to find out the maximum number of days it would take for every house to receive mail at least once.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The postman delivers to 50 houses per day, but no two delivered houses are consecutive. So, in a way, he's selecting a subset of houses where no two are next to each other.\n\nI recall that in combinatorics, selecting items without choosing two consecutive ones is a common problem. For example, if you have a row of houses and you want to select some with no two adjacent, there's a formula for the number of ways to do that.\n\nBut here, we're not just counting the number of ways; we're trying to cover all houses over multiple days, ensuring that each house gets mail at least once, with the no-two-consecutive rule per day.\n\nLet me think about how to maximize the number of days. To maximize the number of days, I need to minimize the number of unique houses that receive mail each day. Wait, no. Actually, to maximize the number of days, I need to maximize the number of days the postman can keep delivering mail under the given constraints.\n\nBut the problem is a bit different. It's asking for the maximum number of days it would take for every house to receive mail at least once, given that each day he delivers to 50 non-consecutive houses.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to consider the worst-case scenario, where the postman delivers to as many new houses as possible each day, thereby maximizing the number of days.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive. If he delivers to as many new houses as possible each day, wouldn't that minimize the number of days? Conversely, if he repeats delivering to some houses, that might maximize the number of days.\n\nBut the problem says \"every house to receive mail at least once.\" So, we need to ensure that all houses have received mail at least once, and we're to find the maximum number of days it would take for that to happen.\n\nI think I need to consider the delivery schedule that takes the longest to cover all houses.\n\nLet me consider that each day, the postman chooses a different subset of 50 houses, none of which are consecutive.\n\nOne way to ensure that houses get mail slowly is to have overlapping subsets that cover the houses gradually.\n\nPerhaps the maximum number of days corresponds to the situation where the postman delivers to the minimum number of new houses each day.\n\nWait, that might be getting too vague.\n\nLet me try another approach. Suppose that on each day, the postman delivers to every second house, starting from house 1, then house 3, and so on, up to house 99. That's 50 houses, and none are consecutive.\n\nThen, the next day, he could deliver to houses 2, 4, 6, ..., 100. Again, 50 houses, none consecutive.\n\nIn this scenario, every house gets mail exactly once, and it takes 2 days.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the maximum number of days, not the minimum.\n\nSo, is 2 the minimum number of days, and is there a way to stretch this over more days?\n\nPerhaps by having overlapping delivery sets.\n\nLet's consider that on day 1, the postman delivers to houses 1, 3, 5, ..., 99.\n\nOn day 2, he could deliver to houses 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.\n\nOn day 3, he could deliver to houses 1, 3, 5, ..., 99 again.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"every house to receive mail at least once.\" So, once a house has received mail, additional deliveries to it on subsequent days don't change the fact that it has already received mail.\n\nTherefore, after two days in this scenario, all houses have received mail at least once.\n\nSo, the minimum number of days is 2.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the maximum number of days it would take.\n\nIs there a way to extend this over more days, perhaps by having some houses receive mail multiple times before all houses have received mail at least once?\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because once all houses have received mail at least once, the process stops.\n\nSo, maybe the maximum number of days is achieved by minimizing the number of new houses that receive mail each day.\n\nIn other words, maximizing the number of days would involve delivering to as few new houses as possible each day.\n\nBut he has to deliver to 50 houses each day, so he can't deliver to fewer than that.\n\nWait, but the condition is that he delivers to exactly 50 houses each day, none of which are consecutive.\n\nSo, if he delivers to the same 50 houses every day, but that wouldn't cover all houses.\n\nHe has to deliver to different subsets over time to cover all houses.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize the number of days before all houses have received mail at least once.\n\nPerhaps the maximum number of days is achieved by always delivering to exactly one new house each day, along with 49 houses that have already received mail.\n\nBut is that possible? Can he deliver to 49 previously delivered houses and one new house each day, while ensuring no two delivered houses are consecutive?\n\nLet me see.\n\nSuppose on day 1, he delivers to houses 1, 3, 5, ..., 99.\n\nOn day 2, he delivers to houses 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.\n\nWait, that's two days, and all houses have received mail.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to stretch this over more days by overlapping more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of days is when he delivers to one new house each day, along with 49 houses from the previous day.\n\nBut I need to ensure that no two delivered houses are consecutive each day.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose that on day 1, he delivers to houses 1, 3, 5, ..., 99.\n\nOn day 2, he delivers to houses 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.\n\nNow, all houses have received mail, and it took 2 days.\n\nIs there a way to make it take 3 days?\n\nFor example, on day 1, deliver to houses 1, 3, 5, ..., 99.\n\nOn day 2, deliver to houses 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.\n\nOn day 3, deliver to houses 1, 3, 5, ..., 99 again.\n\nBut houses 1, 3, 5, ..., 99 have already received mail on day 1, so for them, it's unnecessary, but the condition is just that every house receives mail at least once.\n\nSo, the maximum number of days would be the last day on which the last house receives mail for the first time.\n\nIn the above scenario, by day 2, all houses have received mail at least once, so day 3 doesn't add any new houses.\n\nTherefore, the process would stop at day 2.\n\nSo, is 2 the maximum number of days?\n\nWait, maybe not.\n\nWhat if the postman delivers to different subsets each day, such that some houses don't receive mail until later days.\n\nFor example, on day 1, deliver to houses 1, 3, 5, ..., 49, and 51, 53, ..., 99.\n\nWait, that's still 50 houses, non-consecutive.\n\nOn day 2, deliver to houses 2, 4, 6, ..., 50, and 52, 54, ..., 100.\n\nAgain, all houses have received mail by day 2.\n\nIs there a way to make it take 3 days?\n\nSuppose on day 1, deliver to houses 1, 3, 5, ..., 49, and 51, 53, ..., 99.\n\nOn day 2, deliver to houses 2, 4, 6, ..., 50, and then some houses from 52 to 100, but not all.\n\nWait, but he has to deliver to exactly 50 houses each day.\n\nSo, if he delivers to houses 2, 4, 6, ..., 50, that's 25 houses (since 2 to 50, step 2).\n\nWait, 2,4,6,...,50 is 25 houses.\n\nSo, he needs to deliver to 25 more houses.\n\nHe can't deliver to 52,54,...,100 all at once because that would be 25 houses, making 50 in total.\n\nBut then again, all houses have received mail by day 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he delivers to only some of the even-numbered houses above 50 on day 2.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing.\n\nLet me try to think of it in terms of graph theory.\n\nImagine the houses as nodes in a graph, with edges connecting consecutive houses.\n\nThe postman's delivery each day is an independent set of size 50.\n\nAn independent set is a set of nodes with no two nodes adjacent.\n\nSo, in this case, it's a set of houses with no two consecutive.\n\nThe problem is then to cover all nodes with multiple independent sets, each of size 50, and find the maximum number of days (i.e., the maximum number of independent sets needed to cover all nodes).\n\nBut in graph theory, covering all nodes with independent sets is related to the graph's coloring or covering number.\n\nWait, actually, it's more related to the concept of a cover.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's related to the idea of a schedule or a covering design.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider smaller cases to get an intuition.\n\nLet's consider a smaller number of houses, say 4 houses numbered 1,2,3,4.\n\nEvery day, the postman delivers to 2 houses, with no two consecutive.\n\nWhat's the maximum number of days it would take for all houses to receive mail at least once?\n\nOn day 1, he can deliver to houses 1 and 3.\n\nOn day 2, he can deliver to houses 2 and 4.\n\nNow, all houses have received mail.\n\nAlternatively, on day 1, deliver to houses 1 and 3.\n\nOn day 2, deliver to houses 1 and 4.\n\nOn day 3, deliver to houses 2 and 4.\n\nBut house 1 has already received mail on day 1, and house 4 on day 2.\n\nSo, by day 3, all houses have received mail.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's still 2 days because houses 1 and 3 got mail on day 1, houses 2 and 4 on day 2.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum number of days is 2.\n\nWait, but in this alternative scenario, house 2 gets mail on day 3, but house 4 already got mail on day 2.\n\nSo, the last house to receive mail is house 2 on day 3.\n\nTherefore, in this case, it took 3 days for all houses to receive mail at least once.\n\nWait, but is this possible?\n\nLet me check.\n\nOn day 1: houses 1 and 3.\n\nOn day 2: houses 1 and 4.\n\nOn day 3: houses 2 and 4.\n\nNow, house 1 got mail on day 1 and day 2.\n\nHouse 2 got mail on day 3.\n\nHouse 3 got mail on day 1.\n\nHouse 4 got mail on day 2 and day 3.\n\nSo, all houses have received mail at least once by day 3.\n\nIs there a way to make it take 4 days?\n\nFor example:\n\nDay 1: houses 1 and 3.\n\nDay 2: houses 2 and 4.\n\nDay 3: houses 1 and 3 again.\n\nDay 4: houses 2 and 4 again.\n\nBut in this case, all houses have received mail by day 2.\n\nSo, even though mail is delivered on days 3 and 4, it doesn't change the fact that all houses have already received mail by day 2.\n\nTherefore, the process would stop at day 2.\n\nWait, but in the earlier alternative scenario, it took 3 days.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum number of days is 3 for 4 houses.\n\nWait, but how is that possible?\n\nLet me see again.\n\nIn the alternative scenario:\n\nDay 1: houses 1 and 3.\n\nDay 2: houses 1 and 4.\n\nDay 3: houses 2 and 4.\n\nSo, house 2 receives mail only on day 3.\n\nTherefore, up to day 2, houses 1,3,4 have received mail, but house 2 hasn't.\n\nOn day 3, house 2 receives mail.\n\nHence, it takes 3 days for all houses to receive mail at least once.\n\nBut in the initial scenario:\n\nDay 1: houses 1 and 3.\n\nDay 2: houses 2 and 4.\n\nAll houses have received mail by day 2.\n\nSo, in this case, it takes only 2 days.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of days is 3.\n\nWait, but is there a way to make it take 4 days?\n\nSuppose:\n\nDay 1: houses 1 and 3.\n\nDay 2: house 2 and house 4.\n\nDay 3: house 1 and house 3 again.\n\nDay 4: house 2 and house 4 again.\n\nBut in this case, all houses have received mail by day 2.\n\nSo, even though mail is delivered on days 3 and 4, it doesn't change the fact that all houses have already received mail by day 2.\n\nTherefore, the process would stop at day 2.\n\nWait, but in the earlier alternative scenario, it took 3 days.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum number of days is 3.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the maximum number of days is achieved when the postman delivers to one new house each day, along with 49 houses that have already received mail.\n\nIn the 4-house example:\n\nDay 1: houses 1 and 3.\n\nDay 2: houses 1 and 4.\n\nDay 3: houses 2 and 4.\n\nIn this case, house 2 receives mail only on day 3.\n\nSo, it takes 3 days for all houses to receive mail at least once.\n\nIs there a way to make it take 4 days?\n\nNot really, because in any delivery on day 4, some house would have already received mail earlier.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the maximum number of days is 3 for 4 houses.\n\nSimilarly, for 100 houses, perhaps the maximum number of days is 3 as well.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nLet me consider another small case, say 6 houses: 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nEvery day, deliver to 3 houses, no two consecutive.\n\nWhat's the maximum number of days it would take for all houses to receive mail at least once?\n\nScenario 1:\n\nDay 1: houses 1,3,5.\n\nDay 2: houses 2,4,6.\n\nAll houses have received mail by day 2.\n\nScenario 2:\n\nDay 1: houses 1,3,5.\n\nDay 2: houses 1,4,6.\n\nDay 3: houses 2,4,6.\n\nNow, house 2 receives mail only on day 3.\n\nSo, all houses have received mail by day 3.\n\nIs there a way to make it take 4 days?\n\nFor example:\n\nDay 1: houses 1,3,5.\n\nDay 2: houses 1,4,6.\n\nDay 3: houses 2,4,6.\n\nDay 4: houses 1,3,5 again.\n\nBut in this case, all houses have received mail by day 3.\n\nSo, the maximum number of days is 3.\n\nWait, similar to the 4-house case.\n\nIs there a pattern here?\n\nFor 4 houses, maximum 3 days.\n\nFor 6 houses, maximum 3 days.\n\nDoes this suggest that for any even number of houses, the maximum number of days is 3?\n\nWait, but that seems too simplistic.\n\nLet me check with 2 houses: house 1 and house 2.\n\nEvery day, deliver to 1 house, no two consecutive.\n\nSo, day 1: house 1.\n\nDay 2: house 2.\n\nAll houses have received mail by day 2.\n\nIs there a way to make it take 3 days?\n\nFor example:\n\nDay 1: house 1.\n\nDay 2: house 2.\n\nDay 3: house 1 again.\n\nBut all houses have received mail by day 2.\n\nSo, the process stops at day 2.\n\nTherefore, for 2 houses, the maximum number of days is 2.\n\nWait, but in the 4-house case, it was 3 days, and in the 6-house case, also 3 days.\n\nWait, no, in the 4-house case, it was 3 days, but in the 2-house case, it's 2 days.\n\nIs there a pattern?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of days is equal to the ceiling of (number of houses divided by the number of houses delivered per day).\n\nBut no, because in the 4-house case, it's 4 houses, delivering 2 houses per day, ceiling of 4/2 is 2, but we had a scenario where it took 3 days.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's related to the number of days required to cover all houses, considering the overlapping deliveries.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I need to think in terms of graph coloring.\n\nIf I consider the houses as vertices in a graph, with edges connecting consecutive houses, then each day's delivery corresponds to an independent set of size 50.\n\nCovering all vertices with multiple independent sets is similar to finding a cover of the graph with these independent sets.\n\nThe minimum number of independent sets needed to cover all vertices is called the coloring number or something similar, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, actually, in graph theory, the chromatic index is related to edge coloring, not vertex covering with independent sets.\n\nPerhaps it's related to the concept of a cover or a hitting set.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's related to the idea of a schedule where each independent set represents a schedule for one day.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose that on each day, the postman delivers to 50 houses, none of which are consecutive.\n\nOver multiple days, some houses may receive mail multiple times, but we're interested in the point at which all houses have received mail at least once.\n\nTo maximize the number of days, we need to minimize the number of new houses that receive mail each day.\n\nIn other words, each day, the postman should deliver to as many houses as possible that have already received mail on previous days, while still delivering to some new houses.\n\nBut since he has to deliver to exactly 50 houses each day, and no two delivered houses are consecutive, there's a limit to how many previously delivered houses he can include.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the number of houses that have not yet received mail.\n\nLet's denote by U the set of houses that have not yet received mail.\n\nInitially, U contains all 100 houses.\n\nEach day, the postman must deliver to some subset of U, but with the constraint that no two delivered houses are consecutive.\n\nMoreover, he must deliver to exactly 50 houses that are either in U or have already received mail, but prioritizing those in U to minimize the number of new houses per day.\n\nWait, no, actually, he delivers to 50 houses without two being consecutive, and some of these may have already received mail.\n\nBut the goal is to cover all houses in U eventually.\n\nTo maximize the number of days, we need to minimize the number of new houses covered each day.\n\nSo, ideally, each day, the postman would deliver to as few new houses as possible, while still delivering to 50 houses.\n\nThe minimum number of new houses he can deliver to each day is when U has at least 50 houses remaining.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nLet me think carefully.\n\nSuppose that on day 1, the postman delivers to 50 houses, none of which are consecutive.\n\nThese 50 houses are all in U initially, since no mail has been delivered yet.\n\nSo, after day 1, 50 houses have received mail, and 50 haven't.\n\nOn day 2, the postman again delivers to 50 houses, none consecutive.\n\nHe can choose to deliver to 50 houses from the remaining 50 that haven't received mail yet, but then it would take only 2 days.\n\nAlternatively, he can deliver to some combination of houses that have and haven't received mail, but still, 50 houses per day, no two consecutive.\n\nTo maximize the number of days, he should deliver to as many houses as possible that have already received mail, while still covering the remaining houses gradually.\n\nSo, on day 2, if he delivers to 49 houses that have already received mail and 1 new house, then after day 2, only 49 houses remain that haven't received mail.\n\nBut wait, he has to deliver to 50 houses each day.\n\nSo, if he delivers to 49 previously delivered houses and 1 new house, that's 50 houses.\n\nThen, after day 2, 49 houses have received mail, and 51 have received mail at least once.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, on day 1, 50 houses receive mail.\n\nOn day 2, he delivers to 49 of those 50 again and 1 new house.\n\nSo, total houses that have received mail at least once: 50 (from day 1) plus 1 (new house on day 2) equals 51.\n\nThen, on day 3, he can deliver to 49 of the previously delivered houses and 1 new house again.\n\nSo, after day 3, 51 + 1 = 52 houses have received mail at least once.\n\nContinuing this way, each day, one new house receives mail.\n\nTherefore, to cover all 100 houses, it would take 50 days: 50 new houses on day 1, and then 1 new house each on the next 50 days.\n\nWait, but that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, on day 1, 50 houses receive mail.\n\nThen, on day 2, 49 of those 50 receive mail again, and 1 new house receives mail, total 51 houses have received mail.\n\nOn day 3, 49 of the previously delivered houses receive mail again, and 1 new house receives mail, total 52 houses have received mail.\n\nContinuing this way, on day 51, all 100 houses have received mail at least once.\n\nWait, but 50 (day 1) + 50 days of 1 new house each = 51 days.\n\nWait, no, 50 (day 1) plus 50 days of 1 new house each would be 100 houses, but that's 51 days.\n\nBut 50 (day 1) plus 50 days = 51 days.\n\nWait, but 50 + 50 = 100, but days are 1 to 51.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nLet me try to model this more carefully.\n\nDay 1: Deliver to houses 1 to 50.\n\nNow, houses 1 to 50 have received mail.\n\nHouses 51 to 100 haven't.\n\nDay 2: Deliver to houses 1 to 49, and house 51.\n\nNow, houses 1 to 51 have received mail.\n\nHouses 52 to 100 haven't.\n\nDay 3: Deliver to houses 1 to 49, and house 52.\n\nNow, houses 1 to 52 have received mail.\n\nHouses 53 to 100 haven't.\n\nContinue this pattern.\n\nOn day N, deliver to houses 1 to 49 and house (50 + N -1).\n\nSo, on day 51, deliver to houses 1 to 49 and house 100.\n\nAt this point, all houses have received mail at least once.\n\nTherefore, it takes 51 days to cover all houses in this scenario.\n\nBut is this the maximum number of days?\n\nWait, but in this scenario, on each day after day 1, only one new house receives mail.\n\nSo, after day 1, it takes one day per new house to cover the remaining 50 houses.\n\nHence, total days: 1 (for the first 50 houses) + 50 (one for each of the remaining 50 houses) = 51 days.\n\nIs there a way to make it take more than 51 days?\n\nSuppose that on day 2, instead of delivering to houses 1 to 49 and house 51, he delivers to houses 1 to 48, house 50, and house 51.\n\nThen, houses 1 to 51 have received mail.\n\nOn day 3, deliver to houses 1 to 48, house 50, and house 52.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is similar to the previous scenario, just with a slight adjustment in which houses are repeated.\n\nBut the outcome is the same: it takes 51 days to cover all houses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to stretch it over more days by delivering to fewer than 50 houses per day, but the problem states that he delivers to exactly 50 houses per day.\n\nWait, but he has to deliver to exactly 50 houses per day.\n\nSo, in the scenario above, he's delivering to 50 houses each day: 49 repeats and 1 new house.\n\nTherefore, it seems that 51 days is the maximum number of days it would take for all houses to receive mail at least once.\n\nBut is this feasible?\n\nI need to check if delivering to houses 1 to 49 and house 51 on day 2 satisfies the no-two-consecutive-deliveries condition.\n\nOn day 1, houses 1 to 50.\n\nOn day 2, houses 1 to 49 and house 51.\n\nWait, house 49 and house 50 were both delivered on day 1, but on day 2, house 50 isn't delivered, but house 51 is.\n\nSo, there are no two consecutive houses delivered on day 2.\n\nSimilarly, on day 3, houses 1 to 49 and house 52.\n\nAgain, no two consecutive houses.\n\nThis pattern can continue up to day 51.\n\nTherefore, 51 days seems possible.\n\nBut is there a way to make it take 52 days?\n\nIf on day 2, he delivers to houses 1 to 49 and house 51.\n\nOn day 3, houses 1 to 49 and house 52.\n\n...\n\nOn day 51, houses 1 to 49 and house 100.\n\nAt this point, all houses have received mail at least once.\n\nIf he tries to have a day 52, delivering to houses 1 to 49 and house X, but all houses have already received mail by day 51.\n\nTherefore, the process stops at day 51.\n\nHence, the maximum number of days is 51.\n\nWait, but is there a better way to arrange the deliveries to maximize the number of days?\n\nPerhaps by delivering to fewer new houses per day.\n\nFor example, on day 1, deliver to houses 1 to 50.\n\nOn day 2, deliver to houses 1 to 49 and house 51.\n\nOn day 3, deliver to houses 1 to 48, house 50, and house 52.\n\nWait, but this still follows the same pattern, leading to 51 days.\n\nAlternatively, on day 2, deliver to houses 1 to 49, house 51, and house 53.\n\nWait, but that's 51 houses, which exceeds the limit of 50 houses per day.\n\nNo, he can only deliver to 50 houses per day.\n\nSo, delivering to houses 1 to 49 and house 51 on day 2.\n\nThen, on day 3, houses 1 to 49 and house 52.\n\nAnd so on, up to day 51.\n\nTherefore, 51 days seems to be the maximum.\n\nBut let's check with smaller cases to confirm.\n\nTake 4 houses:\n\nDay 1: houses 1 and 3.\n\nDay 2: houses 1 and 4.\n\nDay 3: houses 2 and 4.\n\nTotal days: 3.\n\nSimilarly, for 100 houses, it's 51 days.\n\nIs there a general formula here?\n\nFor 2 houses: maximum 2 days.\n\nFor 4 houses: maximum 3 days.\n\nFor 6 houses: maximum 4 days.\n\nWait, no, earlier I thought for 6 houses, maximum 3 days.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine.\n\nFor 6 houses:\n\nDay 1: houses 1,3,5.\n\nDay 2: houses 1,4.\n\nWait, but houses 1,3,5 on day 1.\n\nThen, day 2: houses 1 and 4.\n\nWait, but he has to deliver to 3 houses each day.\n\nWait, maybe for 6 houses, delivering 3 houses per day.\n\nDay 1: houses 1,3,5.\n\nDay 2: houses 1,4,6.\n\nDay 3: houses 2,4,6.\n\nIn this case, house 2 receives mail on day 3.\n\nSo, all houses have received mail by day 3.\n\nIs there a way to make it take 4 days?\n\nFor example:\n\nDay 1: houses 1,3,5.\n\nDay 2: houses 1,4,6.\n\nDay 3: houses 2,4,6.\n\nDay 4: houses 1,3,5 again.\n\nBut all houses have already received mail by day 3.\n\nTherefore, the process stops at day 3.\n\nHence, for 6 houses, maximum 3 days.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 houses, maximum 3 days.\n\nFor 2 houses, maximum 2 days.\n\nFor 100 houses, maximum 51 days.\n\nIs there a pattern here?\n\nIt seems that for n houses, where n is even, the maximum number of days is (n/2) + 1.\n\nFor n=2: 1 +1 =2.\n\nFor n=4: 2 +1=3.\n\nFor n=6: 3 +1=4.\n\nFor n=100: 50 +1=51.\n\nYes, that seems to fit.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of days is (n/2) + 1, where n is even.\n\nBut let's confirm this.\n\nFor n=2: (2/2)+1=2.\n\nFor n=4: (4/2)+1=3.\n\nFor n=6: (6/2)+1=4.\n\nFor n=100: (100/2)+1=51.\n\nYes, this seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 51 days.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider n=8 houses.\n\nAccording to the formula, it should be (8/2)+1=5 days.\n\nLet's see:\n\nDay 1: houses 1,3,5,7.\n\nDay 2: houses 1,3,5,8.\n\nWait, but he has to deliver to exactly 4 houses each day, none consecutive.\n\nWait, houses 1,3,5,7 are fine.\n\nDay 2: houses 1,3,6,8.\n\nNow, houses 1,3,5,6,7,8 have received mail.\n\nHouse 2 and 4 haven't.\n\nDay 3: houses 1,3,4,6.\n\nNow, houses 1,3,4,5,6,7,8 have received mail.\n\nHouse 2 hasn't.\n\nDay 4: houses 1,3,4,2.\n\nNow, all houses have received mail.\n\nWait, that's 4 days, but according to the formula, it should be 5 days.\n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is not (n/2)+1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's ceil(n/2).\n\nFor n=2: ceil(2/2)=1, but earlier it was 2 days.\n\nNo, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps it's n/2 rounded up plus one.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIn the n=8 case, according to the earlier pattern:\n\nDay 1: houses 1,3,5,7.\n\nDay 2: houses 1,3,5,8.\n\nDay 3: houses 1,3,6,8.\n\nDay 4: houses 1,3,4,6.\n\nDay 5: houses 1,3,4,2.\n\nNow, all houses have received mail by day 5.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula holds for n=8.\n\nWait, but in my earlier attempt, I had all houses covered by day 4.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nDay 1: houses 1,3,5,7.\n\nDay 2: houses 1,3,5,8.\n\nDay 3: houses 1,3,6,8.\n\nDay 4: houses 1,3,4,6.\n\nDay 5: houses 1,3,4,2.\n\nNow, all houses have received mail by day 5.\n\nHence, for n=8, it takes 5 days, which is (8/2)+1=5.\n\nTherefore, the formula seems consistent.\n\nThus, for n=100 houses, the maximum number of days is (100/2)+1=51 days.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 51 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[
