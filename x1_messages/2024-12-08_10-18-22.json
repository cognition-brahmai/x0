        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 10 houses on one side of the street and 15 on the other, making a total of 25 houses. Each house has at least one dog, and there are 30 dogs in total. I need to find the minimum number of houses that have more than one dog.\n\nFirst, since every house has at least one dog, that accounts for 25 dogs (one per house). But there are 30 dogs in total, which means there are 30 - 25 = 5 extra dogs.\n\nThese 5 extra dogs must be distributed among some of the houses, meaning those houses will have more than one dog. I need to find the minimum number of houses that have more than one dog, so I should try to distribute these extra dogs in a way that minimizes the number of houses getting multiple dogs.\n\nTo minimize the number of houses with more than one dog, I should give as many extra dogs as possible to fewer houses. For example, if I give all 5 extra dogs to one house, then only that one house would have more than one dog. But is that possible?\n\nWait, the problem says each house has at least one dog, so it's allowed for a house to have more than one dog. So, yes, giving all 5 extra dogs to one house would mean only one house has more than one dog.\n\nBut maybe there's a restriction I'm missing. Let's think again.\n\nIf I give one extra dog to a house, that house will have two dogs. If I give two extra dogs to a house, it will have three dogs, and so on.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the number of houses that have more than one dog, which means I want as many of these extra dogs as possible to go to the same houses.\n\nSo, if I have 5 extra dogs, and I give one extra dog to each of five houses, then five houses will have two dogs each, and the remaining 20 houses will have one dog each.\n\nAlternatively, if I give two extra dogs to two houses, that accounts for 4 extra dogs, and then one extra dog to another house, that accounts for the fifth extra dog. In this case, two houses have three dogs each, and one house has two dogs, totaling three houses with more than one dog.\n\nWait, but that's more houses with more than one dog compared to the first scenario where only five houses have more than one dog.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the first scenario, five houses have two dogs each, and in the second scenario, three houses have more than one dog (two with three dogs and one with two dogs).\n\nSo the second scenario has fewer houses with more than one dog.\n\nBut I can do better. If I give three extra dogs to one house and two extra dogs to another house, that accounts for five extra dogs. In this case, one house has four dogs, and another has three dogs, so only two houses have more than one dog.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nLet me check: one house gets three extra dogs, so 1 + 3 = 4 dogs, and another house gets two extra dogs, so 1 + 2 = 3 dogs. Total extra dogs: 3 + 2 = 5. Total houses with more than one dog: two.\n\nIs there a way to have only one house with more than one dog?\n\nIf I give all five extra dogs to one house, then that house would have 1 + 5 = 6 dogs, and all other houses have one dog each. So only one house has more than one dog.\n\nDoes that work? Yes, that seems to satisfy the condition.\n\nSo, the minimum number of houses that have more than one dog is one.\n\nBut wait, is there a reason why I can't do that? Is there any restriction on the number of dogs a house can have?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify any upper limit on the number of dogs a house can have, so it seems allowed.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of houses with more than one dog is one.\n\nBut let me double-check. If I have one house with six dogs and the other 24 houses with one dog each, that totals 1*6 + 24*1 = 30 dogs, which matches the total.\n\nAlternatively, if I have two houses with, say, three and four dogs respectively, and the rest have one dog, that would be 3 + 4 + 23*1 = 30 dogs, which also works, but in this case, two houses have more than one dog, which is more than the previous scenario.\n\nSimilarly, if I have five houses with two dogs each and the remaining 20 houses with one dog each, that's 5*2 + 20*1 = 30 dogs, but that's five houses with more than one dog, which is worse.\n\nSo, the scenario with the fewest houses having more than one dog is when one house has six dogs, and the rest have one each.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number is one.\n\nWait, but I feel like maybe I'm missing something. Maybe there's a mathematical way to confirm this.\n\nLet me think in terms of averages. Total dogs are 30, total houses are 25, so average dogs per house is 30/25 = 1.2 dogs per house.\n\nSince each house has at least one dog, the excess dogs per house beyond one are 0.2 per house on average.\n\nBut since dogs are whole numbers, some houses must have more than one dog to make up for the houses that have exactly one.\n\nBut in reality, since we can't have a fraction of a dog, the distribution must account for the total of 30 dogs.\n\nTo minimize the number of houses with more than one dog, we should maximize the number of houses with exactly one dog.\n\nSo, if we have x houses with more than one dog, then the number of houses with exactly one dog is 25 - x.\n\nThe total number of dogs would be (25 - x)*1 + (sum of dogs in the x houses).\n\nWe know the sum of dogs in the x houses is 30 - (25 - x) = 5 + x.\n\nSo, each of the x houses has on average (5 + x)/x dogs beyond one.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, let's think in terms of excess dogs.\n\nWe have 5 extra dogs to distribute among the houses.\n\nTo minimize the number of houses getting extra dogs, we should give as many extra dogs as possible to fewer houses.\n\nSo, giving all 5 extra dogs to one house results in only one house having more than one dog.\n\nAlternatively, giving 4 extra dogs to one house and 1 to another results in two houses with more than one dog.\n\nSimilarly, giving 3 extra dogs to one house and 2 to another also results in two houses with more than one dog.\n\nGiving 2 extra dogs to two houses and 1 extra dog to another house results in three houses with more than one dog.\n\nSo, the scenario with the fewest houses having more than one dog is when one house gets all five extra dogs, making it have six dogs in total.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of houses with more than one dog is one.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
