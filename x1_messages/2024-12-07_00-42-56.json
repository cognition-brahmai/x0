        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a water tank that can hold 10,000 liters, and it's currently empty. There are two pipes filling it up: Pipe A adds 25 liters per minute, and Pipe B adds 40 liters per minute. If both pipes are working at the same time, how long will it take to fill the tank completely?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We need to find the time it takes for both pipes to fill the tank when they're working together.\n\nOkay, so pipe A fills the tank at 25 liters per minute, and pipe B fills it at 40 liters per minute. Since they're working simultaneously, their rates should add up. So, the combined rate would be 25 + 40 liters per minute.\n\nLet me calculate that: 25 + 40 = 65 liters per minute. So, together, they fill the tank at a rate of 65 liters per minute.\n\nNow, the tank's capacity is 10,000 liters. To find out how long it takes to fill the tank at this combined rate, I should divide the total volume by the rate.\n\nSo, time = total volume / combined rate\n\nPlugging in the numbers: time = 10,000 liters / 65 liters per minute\n\nLet me do that division. 10,000 divided by 65.\n\nHmm, 65 times 150 is 9,750. Subtract that from 10,000, and you get 250.\n\nThen, 65 goes into 250 three times because 65 times 3 is 195.\n\nSubtract 195 from 250, and you have 55.\n\nSo, 65 goes into 550 eight times because 65 times 8 is 520.\n\nSubtract 520 from 550, and you have 30.\n\nNext, 65 goes into 300 four times because 65 times 4 is 260.\n\nSubtract 260 from 300, and you have 40.\n\nSo, 65 goes into 400 six times because 65 times 6 is 390.\n\nSubtract 390 from 400, and you have 10.\n\nAt this point, it's getting pretty small, and since we're dealing with minutes, maybe we can round it off?\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way to handle this division. Maybe I can use a calculator for more precision.\n\nAssuming I have a calculator, 10,000 divided by 65 is approximately 153.846153 minutes.\n\nBut, perhaps it's better to express this in minutes and seconds.\n\nFirst, take the integer part: 153 minutes.\n\nThen, take the decimal part: 0.846153 minutes.\n\nTo convert that to seconds, multiply by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute).\n\n0.846153 * 60 \u2248 50.769 seconds.\n\nSo, roughly 153 minutes and 51 seconds.\n\nBut maybe the question expects the answer in minutes only, with decimal places.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express the time in hours and minutes.\n\nLet's see: there are 60 minutes in an hour.\n\nSo, 153 minutes divided by 60 is 2 hours and 33 minutes.\n\nWait, 2 hours times 60 is 120 minutes.\n\n153 minutes minus 120 minutes is 33 minutes.\n\nSo, 2 hours and 33 minutes.\n\nBut again, we have the additional 51 seconds.\n\nSo, the total time would be 2 hours, 33 minutes, and 51 seconds.\n\nBut I think the problem might expect the answer in minutes with decimals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should express the time in hours only.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nTotal time in hours: 153.846153 minutes divided by 60.\n\n153.846153 / 60 \u2248 2.5641 hours.\n\nAgain, that's 2 hours plus 0.5641 hours.\n\nConvert 0.5641 hours to minutes: 0.5641 * 60 \u2248 33.846 minutes.\n\nSo, approximately 2 hours, 33 minutes, and 51 seconds.\n\nWait a minute, this seems consistent with what I got earlier.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me check my initial calculation.\n\nTotal volume: 10,000 liters.\n\nCombined rate: 65 liters per minute.\n\nTime = 10,000 / 65 \u2248 153.846153 minutes.\n\nNow, to express this in hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\nFirst, convert minutes to hours and minutes.\n\n153 minutes divided by 60: 2 hours and 33 minutes (since 2*60=120, and 153-120=33).\n\nThen, take the decimal part: 0.846153 minutes.\n\nConvert that to seconds: 0.846153 * 60 \u2248 50.769 seconds, which we can round to 51 seconds.\n\nSo, the total time is approximately 2 hours, 33 minutes, and 51 seconds.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the answer in minutes only, with decimals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's acceptable to leave the answer in minutes with decimals.\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf I say approximately 153.85 minutes, that would be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to be more precise, I can say 153 minutes and 51 seconds.\n\nBut I think the problem is expecting the time in minutes, so 153.85 minutes would suffice.\n\nHowever, let's double-check the calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\nTotal volume: 10,000 liters.\n\nCombined rate: 25 + 40 = 65 liters per minute.\n\nTime = 10,000 / 65.\n\nLet me do the division again: 10,000 \u00f7 65.\n\n65 * 150 = 9,750.\n\n10,000 - 9,750 = 250.\n\n250 \u00f7 65 \u2248 3.84615 minutes.\n\nSo, total time is 150 + 3.84615 \u2248 153.84615 minutes.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the tank will be filled in approximately 153.85 minutes, or 2 hours, 33 minutes, and 51 seconds.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the desired format for the answer, I'll present it in minutes with two decimal places.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 153.85 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects a precise fractional answer, I can express it as a fraction.\n\nLet me calculate 10,000 divided by 65.\n\n10,000 \u00f7 65 = 2000/13 minutes.\n\nBecause 10,000 divided by 65 is equal to 10,000 / 65 = 2000 / 13.\n\nThat's an exact fraction.\n\nIf I convert 2000/13 to a decimal, it's approximately 153.846153 minutes, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the exact time is 2000/13 minutes.\n\nBut perhaps the problem wants the answer in hours.\n\nLet me convert 2000/13 minutes to hours.\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, hours = (2000/13)/60 = 2000/(13*60) = 2000/780 = 200/78 = 100/39 hours.\n\nSimplifying 100/39 hours.\n\nThat's approximately 2.5641 hours, which again matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, regardless of the format, the time required to fill the tank is consistent across different units.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is approximately 153.85 minutes, or exactly 2000/13 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2000}{13} \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
