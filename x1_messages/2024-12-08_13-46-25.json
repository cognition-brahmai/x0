        "content": "Certainly! Below is a Python script that calculates the factorial of a given positive integer using recursion:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        return \"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\"\n    elif n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n# Accepting input from the user\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a positive integer: \"))\n\n# Calculating factorial\nresult = factorial(num)\n\n# Displaying the result\nprint(f\"The factorial of {num} is {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The `factorial` function is defined to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.\n   - If the input number `n` is negative, it returns a message stating that factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n   - If `n` is 0, it returns 1 since 0! is 1.\n   - For positive integers, it recursively calls itself with `n-1` until it reaches the base case.\n\n2. **Input Handling**: The script prompts the user to enter a positive integer and reads the input using `input()`, converting it to an integer with `int()`.\n\n3. **Calculate and Display Result**: It calculates the factorial using the `factorial` function and prints the result.\n\nThis script ensures that the factorial is calculated correctly for positive integers and handles invalid cases gracefully."
