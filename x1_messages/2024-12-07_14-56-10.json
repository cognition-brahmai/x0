        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a man who spends parts of his salary on different things, and we need to find out his monthly salary based on what he spends on miscellaneous expenses.\n\nFirst, let's list out all his expenditures:\n\n- Rent: 1/3 of his salary\n\n- Groceries: 1/4 of his salary\n\n- Transportation: 1/5 of his salary\n\n- Miscellaneous expenses: $600\n\nAnd we need to find his total monthly salary.\n\nLet's denote his monthly salary as \"s\".\n\nSo, his total expenditures should equal his salary. That means:\n\nRent + Groceries + Transportation + Miscellaneous = Salary\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\n(1/3)s + (1/4)s + (1/5)s + 600 = s\n\nOur goal is to solve for s.\n\nFirst, let's find a common denominator for the fractions to combine them. The denominators are 3, 4, and 5. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is 60.\n\nSo, let's convert each fraction to have a denominator of 60:\n\n- 1/3 = 20/60\n\n- 1/4 = 15/60\n\n- 1/5 = 12/60\n\nNow, let's add these fractions:\n\n20/60 + 15/60 + 12/60 = 47/60\n\nSo, the total fraction of the salary spent on rent, groceries, and transportation is 47/60 of his salary.\n\nNow, the miscellaneous expenses are the remaining part of his salary after these expenditures. So, the fraction of the salary spent on miscellaneous is:\n\n1 - 47/60 = 13/60\n\nAnd we know that this amount is $600.\n\nSo, 13/60 of his salary is $600.\n\nMathematically, that's:\n\n(13/60)s = 600\n\nNow, to find s, we can solve for s by dividing both sides of the equation by 13/60. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.\n\nSo, s = 600 \u00f7 (13/60) = 600 * (60/13)\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, 600 * 60 = 36,000\n\nThen, 36,000 \u00f7 13 \u2248 2769.23\n\nSo, his monthly salary is approximately $2769.23\n\nBut let's double-check our calculations to make sure we didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the fractions:\n\n1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5\n\nConverting to sixtieths:\n\n20/60 + 15/60 + 12/60 = 47/60\n\nThen, 1 - 47/60 = 13/60\n\nSo, yes, miscellaneous is 13/60 of the salary.\n\nThen, (13/60)s = 600\n\nSo, s = 600 * (60/13) = 36,000 / 13 \u2248 2769.23\n\nWait a minute, but in financial calculations, it's important to handle decimals carefully, especially with money.\n\nLet's see if there's a more precise way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, we can set up the equation as:\n\n(1/3)s + (1/4)s + (1/5)s + 600 = s\n\nCombining the fractions:\n\n(20/60 + 15/60 + 12/60)s + 600 = s\n\n(47/60)s + 600 = s\n\nNow, subtract (47/60)s from both sides:\n\n600 = s - (47/60)s\n\n600 = (60/60)s - (47/60)s\n\n600 = (13/60)s\n\nNow, solve for s:\n\ns = 600 * (60/13) = 36,000 / 13 \u2248 2769.23076923\n\nRounding to two decimal places, s \u2248 $2769.23\n\nBut let's verify if this makes sense.\n\nIf s = $2769.23\n\nThen:\n\nRent: (1/3)*2769.23 \u2248 $923.08\n\nGroceries: (1/4)*2769.23 \u2248 $692.31\n\nTransportation: (1/5)*2769.23 \u2248 $553.85\n\nMiscellaneous: $600.00\n\nTotal: 923.08 + 692.31 + 553.85 + 600.00 = 2769.24\n\nWhich is approximately equal to the salary of $2769.23\n\nThe slight discrepancy is due to rounding.\n\nTherefore, the man's monthly salary is approximately $2769.23\n\nAlternatively, to avoid rounding errors, we can express the salary as a fraction:\n\ns = 36,000 / 13 = 2769 + 3/13 \u2248 2769.23076923\n\nBut for financial purposes, rounding to two decimal places is acceptable.\n\nSo, the final answer is $2769.23\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2769.23} \\]"
