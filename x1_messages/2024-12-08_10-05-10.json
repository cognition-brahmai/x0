        "content": "So John can paint a room in 6 hours, and Jane can do it in 8 hours. If they both start painting at the same time, how long will it take them to finish together?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much of the room each person can paint per hour. That way, I can see how much they can do together in one hour.\n\nJohn paints the room in 6 hours, so his painting rate is 1 room per 6 hours. That means per hour, he paints 1/6 of the room.\n\nJane paints the room in 8 hours, so her painting rate is 1 room per 8 hours. So per hour, she paints 1/8 of the room.\n\nNow, if they work together, their painting rates should add up. So, together, they paint 1/6 plus 1/8 of the room per hour.\n\nTo add those fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 8 is 24.\n\nSo, 1/6 is equal to 4/24, and 1/8 is equal to 3/24.\n\nAdding those together, 4/24 plus 3/24 is 7/24. So together, they paint 7/24 of the room per hour.\n\nNow, to find out how long it takes them to paint the whole room, I need to divide 1 (the whole room) by their combined rate of 7/24.\n\nSo, 1 divided by 7/24 is the same as 1 multiplied by 24/7.\n\nThat gives me 24/7 hours.\n\n24 divided by 7 is approximately 3.4286 hours.\n\nTo convert that to hours and minutes, the 3 is the hours, and the 0.4286 times 60 minutes gives approximately 25.71 minutes.\n\nSo, it's about 3 hours and 26 minutes.\n\nBut maybe I should leave it as a fraction for exactness.\n\n24/7 hours is 3 and 3/7 hours.\n\nAnd 3/7 of an hour is (3/7)*60 minutes, which is approximately 25.71 minutes, so roughly 26 minutes.\n\nSo, together, they can paint the room in 3 hours and 26 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{7} \\text{ hours}} \\]\n\nor approximately 3 hours and 26 minutes."
