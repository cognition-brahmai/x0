        "content": "Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. This modeling is not limited to any particular field of linguistics. Traditionally, computational linguistics was performed by computer scientists who had specialized in the application of computers to the processing of a natural language. Today, computational linguists often work as members of interdisciplinary teams, which can include regular linguists, experts in the target language, and computer scientists. In this context, what is the primary goal of computational linguistics?\nA. To develop algorithms for translating languages\nB. To create realistic artificial intelligence characters for video games\nC. To facilitate human-machine interaction in natural language\nD. To analyze the structure of different languages"

        "content": "The primary goal of computational linguistics is to facilitate human-machine interaction in natural language. This field focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both effective and efficient. By developing algorithms and models that can process and generate natural language, computational linguists aim to bridge the gap between human communication and machine understanding, making it easier for people to interact with computers using their native languages.\n\nOption A, developing algorithms for translating languages, is indeed a significant application within computational linguistics, but it is not the primary goal. Machine translation is one of the many areas where computational linguistics is applied, but the broader aim is to enable seamless communication between humans and machines through natural language.\n\nOption B, creating realistic artificial intelligence characters for video games, is another application of computational linguistics. These characters often need to understand and respond to player input in natural language, which requires linguistic models and algorithms. However, this is a specific use case and not the overarching goal of the field.\n\nOption D, analyzing the structure of different languages, is more aligned with theoretical linguistics. While computational linguistics does involve the analysis of language structure, its primary focus is on applying this knowledge to build computational models and systems that can process and generate language.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is C: to facilitate human-machine interaction in natural language. This encapsulates the core objective of computational linguistics, which is to make it possible for computers to understand and generate human language, thereby improving the way humans and machines communicate and interact."
