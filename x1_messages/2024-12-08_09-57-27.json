        "content": "Let's see. I have three machines producing items at different rates, and they all operate for 6 hours. I need to find out the total number of items produced by all of them together.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many items each machine produces individually in 6 hours, and then add those amounts together to get the total.\n\nStarting with Machine A: it produces 10 items per hour. So, in 6 hours, it would produce 10 items/hour times 6 hours, which is 60 items.\n\nNext, Machine B produces 15 items per hour. In 6 hours, it would produce 15 items/hour times 6 hours, which is 90 items.\n\nThen, Machine C produces 20 items per hour. In 6 hours, it would produce 20 items/hour times 6 hours, which is 120 items.\n\nNow, I need to add up the productions of all three machines: 60 items from A plus 90 items from B plus 120 items from C.\n\nLet's add 60 and 90 first: that's 150 items. Then add 120 to 150, which gives 270 items.\n\nSo, the total number of items produced by all three machines in 6 hours is 270.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a smarter way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, I could add up the production rates of all machines first and then multiply by the number of hours they operate.\n\nSo, Machine A is 10 items/hour, Machine B is 15 items/hour, and Machine C is 20 items/hour. Together, their combined production rate is 10 + 15 + 20, which is 45 items per hour.\n\nNow, if they operate for 6 hours, the total production would be 45 items/hour times 6 hours, which is also 270 items.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation. So, it seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can verify it another way.\n\nLet's think about it in terms of each machine's contribution.\n\nMachine A: 10 items/hour for 6 hours: 10 * 6 = 60.\n\nMachine B: 15 items/hour for 6 hours: 15 * 6 = 90.\n\nMachine C: 20 items/hour for 6 hours: 20 * 6 = 120.\n\nTotal: 60 + 90 + 120 = 270.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the production rates per hour and multiply by the number of hours, it's the same as summing the individual productions.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nI don't think there's any need for further calculation or consideration in this problem. The question is straightforward, and the answer is straightforward.\n\nTotal items produced: 270.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{270} \\]"
