        "content": "So, I've got this problem here about a hotel chain renovating its properties to increase room occupancy rates. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the current situation:\n\n- Average occupancy rate: 70%\n\n- Total rooms available: 10,000\n\n- Average room rate: $150 per night\n\nFrom this, we can calculate the current revenue. But before that, we should probably figure out the current occupancy in terms of rooms.\n\nCurrent occupied rooms = 70% of 10,000 = 0.7 * 10,000 = 7,000 rooms\n\nSo, current daily revenue = 7,000 rooms * $150/room = $1,050,000 per day\n\nNow, the hotel is planning to renovate and add extra rooms, which will increase the total rooms and also the occupancy rate.\n\nAfter renovation:\n\n- Total rooms: 10,000 + 2,000 = 12,000 rooms\n\n- Expected occupancy rate: 80%\n\nSo, new occupied rooms = 80% of 12,000 = 0.8 * 12,000 = 9,600 rooms\n\nNew daily revenue = 9,600 rooms * $150/room = $1,440,000 per day\n\nNow, to find the additional revenue generated by this project, we need to find the difference between the new revenue and the current revenue.\n\nAdditional daily revenue = New daily revenue - Current daily revenue = $1,440,000 - $1,050,000 = $390,000 per day\n\nBut, we also need to consider the renovation cost, which is $50 million. To find out how long it will take to recoup the renovation cost, we can divide the cost by the additional daily revenue.\n\nPayback period in days = Renovation cost / Additional daily revenue = $50,000,000 / $390,000 \u2248 128.21 days\n\nSo, it would take approximately 128 days to recoup the renovation cost based on the additional daily revenue.\n\nBut, perhaps the question is asking for the additional revenue generated, not considering the payback period. In that case, the additional revenue per day is $390,000.\n\nHowever, if we consider a specific period, say per year, we can calculate the annual additional revenue.\n\nAssuming 365 days per year:\n\nAdditional annual revenue = $390,000 * 365 = $142,350,000 per year\n\nBut since the payback period is around 128 days, in a year, the hotel would generate enough additional revenue to cover the renovation cost in about 128 days, and the rest of the year's additional revenue would be pure profit.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the payback period, the hotel would recover the $50 million in approximately 128 days.\n\nBut perhaps the question is simply asking for the additional revenue generated, assuming the renovation is completed and the new occupancy rates are achieved.\n\nIn that case, the additional revenue per day is $390,000, as calculated earlier.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this calculation assumes that the average room rate remains at $150 per night, which might not be the case after renovation. Perhaps the renovated rooms could command a higher rate, but based on the information provided, we'll stick with $150 per night.\n\nAdditionally, there might be other costs associated with the renovation, such as increased operating costs, but again, based on the information provided, we'll only consider the renovation cost of $50 million.\n\nSo, in summary, the additional revenue generated per day is $390,000, leading to a payback period of approximately 128 days for the $50 million renovation cost.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{390000} \\]"
