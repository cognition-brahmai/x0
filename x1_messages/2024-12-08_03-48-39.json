        "content": "So the train covers 120 miles in 3 hours, and I need to find its average speed in miles per hour. Average speed is usually calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time taken, right? So, in this case, it would be 120 miles divided by 3 hours. Let me do the math: 120 divided by 3 equals 40. So, the average speed is 40 miles per hour. But wait, is there anything else I should consider here? Like, is the train moving at a constant speed or is it accelerating and decelerating? The question doesn't specify, so I think assuming constant speed is fine for this calculation. Yeah, I think 40 miles per hour is the answer."
