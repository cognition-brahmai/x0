        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of people with an average age of 30 years, and one person who is 60 years old leaves the group. We need to find out what the new average age will be after this person leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an average is. The average age of a group is the sum of all the ages divided by the number of people in the group. So, if the average age is 30, that means the total sum of ages divided by the number of people equals 30.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let \\( n \\) be the original number of people in the group.\n\n- Then, the total sum of their ages is \\( 30n \\) because average = sum / n.\n\nNow, one person aged 60 leaves the group. So, the new sum of ages will be the original sum minus 60, which is \\( 30n - 60 \\).\n\nThe new number of people in the group is \\( n - 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the new average age should be the new sum divided by the new number of people, which is \\( \\frac{30n - 60}{n - 1} \\).\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward, but I wonder if there's a specific numerical answer or if it depends on the original number of people.\n\nWait a minute, the problem doesn't specify the original number of people in the group. Does that mean the new average depends on \\( n \\), or is there a way to find a specific value?\n\nLet me see if I can simplify the expression \\( \\frac{30n - 60}{n - 1} \\).\n\nI can factor out 30 in the numerator:\n\n\\( \\frac{30(n - 2)}{n - 1} \\).\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, the new average is \\( 30 \\times \\frac{n - 2}{n - 1} \\).\n\nBut without knowing \\( n \\), it seems like the new average depends on the original number of people.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to express this differently. Perhaps I can consider that the average age decreases by a certain amount when the 60-year-old leaves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the impact of removing one person's age from the total sum and how that affects the average.\n\nLet me consider a small example to see if that helps.\n\nSuppose the group originally has 3 people, with ages such that their average is 30. So, total sum is 90 years.\n\nIf one person aged 60 leaves, the new sum is 90 - 60 = 30, and the new number of people is 2.\n\nSo, the new average would be 15 years.\n\nThat seems quite young, but mathematically it makes sense.\n\nWait, but if the original group had an average age of 30, and one person aged 60 leaves, it's possible that the remaining people are much younger, hence the drop in average.\n\nAlternatively, if the group is larger, say 10 people, total sum is 300 years.\n\nIf one person aged 60 leaves, new sum is 240, and new number of people is 9.\n\nSo, new average is 240 / 9 \u2248 26.67 years.\n\nThat's still a drop, but not as drastic as in the smaller group.\n\nSo, it seems that the new average depends on the original number of people in the group.\n\nBut perhaps there's a general way to express the new average in terms of the original average and the age of the person who left.\n\nLet me try to generalize.\n\nOriginal average = 30 = sum / n \u21d2 sum = 30n.\n\nNew sum = 30n - 60.\n\nNew number of people = n - 1.\n\nNew average = (30n - 60) / (n - 1).\n\nAs I did earlier.\n\nIs there a way to simplify this further or to find a specific value without knowing \\( n \\)?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a relationship between the original average and the new average that I'm missing.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think in terms of the change in average.\n\nLet me denote the change in average.\n\nOriginal average: 30.\n\nNew average: (30n - 60) / (n - 1).\n\nLet me subtract the new average from the original average:\n\n30 - (30n - 60)/(n - 1).\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n30 - (30n - 60)/(n - 1) = [30(n - 1) - (30n - 60)] / (n - 1)\n\n= [30n - 30 - 30n + 60] / (n - 1)\n\n= (30n - 30n + 60 - 30) / (n - 1)\n\n= 30 / (n - 1).\n\nSo, the difference between the original average and the new average is 30 / (n - 1).\n\nTherefore, the new average is original average minus 30 / (n - 1).\n\nBut again, without knowing \\( n \\), this seems incomplete.\n\nWait, maybe the problem expects me to express the new average in terms of \\( n \\), or perhaps there's a specific value for \\( n \\) that I'm supposed to assume.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach to this problem.\n\nLet me think about it differently.\n\nSuppose the group has an average age of 30, and one person leaves who is older than the average.\n\nSince 60 is greater than 30, removing this person should decrease the average age.\n\nHow much it decreases depends on the size of the group.\n\nIn the earlier example with n=3, the average dropped to 15, which is a decrease of 15 years.\n\nWith n=10, it dropped to approximately 26.67, a decrease of about 3.33 years.\n\nSo, the change in average is inversely proportional to the size of the group.\n\nSpecifically, from the earlier calculation, the change in average is 30 / (n - 1).\n\nBut without knowing \\( n \\), I can't compute a numerical value.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects me to assume a specific value for \\( n \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to find \\( n \\) using the given information.\n\nIs there any other information provided that I can use to find \\( n \\)?\n\nLooking back at the problem, it says: \"a group of people have an average age of 30 years, and one person aged 60 leaves the group.\"\n\nThat's all the information given. There's no specific number of people in the group provided.\n\nSo, unless I can find another equation or piece of information to solve for \\( n \\), I'm stuck with an expression in terms of \\( n \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem implies that the person who left is the oldest or something like that, but it doesn't specify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's assuming that the group had a certain property before the person left, but again, no additional information is provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard method to handle such problems, and I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Original number of people: \\( n \\).\n\n- Original total age: \\( 30n \\).\n\n- After one person aged 60 leaves:\n\n- New total age: \\( 30n - 60 \\).\n\n- New number of people: \\( n - 1 \\).\n\n- New average: \\( \\frac{30n - 60}{n - 1} \\).\n\nNow, perhaps I can simplify \\( \\frac{30n - 60}{n - 1} \\).\n\nFactor out 30 in the numerator:\n\n\\( \\frac{30(n - 2)}{n - 1} \\).\n\nThis is the same as \\( 30 \\times \\frac{n - 2}{n - 1} \\).\n\nI can write this as \\( 30 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n - 1}\\right) \\), but that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that for large \\( n \\), the change in average is small, but for small \\( n \\), it's more significant.\n\nBut again, without knowing \\( n \\), I can't compute a numerical value.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to find \\( n \\) using the fact that the average age changes when the person leaves.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nSuppose the original sum of ages is \\( 30n \\).\n\nAfter removing one person aged 60, the new sum is \\( 30n - 60 \\), and the new average is \\( \\frac{30n - 60}{n - 1} \\).\n\nPerhaps I can set up an equation based on the properties of averages.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of weighted averages or something similar.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about the change in total age and how it affects the average.\n\nThe total age decreases by 60, and the number of people decreases by 1.\n\nThe change in average is the change in total age divided by the change in the number of people, but that's not exactly correct because the average is the total age divided by the number of people.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the expression I have: new average = \\( \\frac{30n - 60}{n - 1} \\).\n\nMaybe I can simplify this further.\n\nLet me try dividing numerator and denominator by n:\n\n\\( \\frac{30 - 60/n}{1 - 1/n} \\).\n\nAs n becomes large, this approaches 30, which makes sense because removing one person from a large group shouldn't affect the average much.\n\nBut again, without knowing n, this doesn't give me a specific numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the new average in terms of the original average and the age of the person who left.\n\nLet me denote the original average as A = 30, the age of the person who left as B = 60, and the new average as C.\n\nThen, C = (A*n - B)/(n - 1).\n\nBut again, without n, I can't find a numerical value for C.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's a way to eliminate n from the equation.\n\nFrom the original average, A = sum / n \u21d2 sum = A*n.\n\nAfter removing one person, sum' = sum - B = A*n - B.\n\nNew average C = sum' / (n - 1) = (A*n - B)/(n - 1).\n\nI need to solve for C in terms of A and B, without n.\n\nLet me try to express n in terms of A and C.\n\nFrom C = (A*n - B)/(n - 1), I can write:\n\nC(n - 1) = A*n - B \u21d2 C*n - C = A*n - B \u21d2 n(C - A) = -B + C \u21d2 n = (C - B)/(C - A).\n\nThis seems complicated and doesn't help much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that the group has a certain number of people, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, maybe the problem expects me to assume that the group has at least two people, since one is leaving, but that doesn't give me a specific value for n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard formula for this situation that I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think about the problem differently.\n\nLet me consider that the average age decreases by a certain amount when the oldest person leaves.\n\nBut again, without knowing how many people are in the group, I can't determine the exact new average.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo or is incomplete, and it was supposed to provide the original number of people in the group.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to test my understanding of how averages change when a value is removed.\n\nIn that case, the answer would be expressed in terms of n, as I have done.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is \\( \\frac{30n - 60}{n - 1} \\), where n is the original number of people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can simplify this expression further.\n\nLet me try performing the division:\n\n\\( \\frac{30n - 60}{n - 1} = \\frac{30(n - 2)}{n - 1} = 30 \\times \\frac{n - 2}{n - 1} \\).\n\nThis is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write it as:\n\n\\( 30 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n - 1}\\right) \\), but that's not exactly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that \\( n \\) must be at least 2, since one person is leaving, and probably more in a group.\n\nBut without a specific value for \\( n \\), I can't compute a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation of the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about a group where the average age is 30, and one person aged 60 leaves, and I need to find the new average, assuming that the group has a specific number of people.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is incomplete or missing some information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and there's a simpler way to look at it.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose the group has an average age of 30, and one person leaves who is 60 years old.\n\nThe difference between the age of the person who left and the average is 60 - 30 = 30 years.\n\nThis means that this person was 30 years above the average.\n\nWhen this person leaves, their \"excess\" age of 30 years is removed from the total sum.\n\nBut since the average is the total sum divided by the number of people, removing this excess affects the average.\n\nSpecifically, the change in average should be the excess age divided by the original number of people.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think in terms of the impact on the average.\n\nThe change in average when a person leaves is equal to the difference between the person's age and the original average, divided by the original number of people.\n\nIn formula terms:\n\nChange in average = (age of person who left - original average) / n.\n\nBut in this case, the person who left is older than the average, so the average decreases.\n\nSo, change in average = (60 - 30)/n = 30/n.\n\nTherefore, the new average = original average - change in average = 30 - 30/n.\n\nSo, new average = 30 - 30/n.\n\nThis is another way to express the new average, and it's equivalent to what I had earlier.\n\nBecause from earlier:\n\nNew average = (30n - 60)/(n - 1).\n\nLet me see if that's equal to 30 - 30/n.\n\nLet me compute 30 - 30/n:\n\n= (30n - 30)/n.\n\nWait, that's not the same as (30n - 60)/(n - 1).\n\nSo, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me recast this.\n\nIf change in average = 30/n, then new average = 30 - 30/n.\n\nBut according to earlier calculation, new average = (30n - 60)/(n - 1).\n\nAre these two expressions equal?\n\nLet me check:\n\n(30n - 60)/(n - 1) = 30(n - 2)/(n - 1).\n\nAnd 30 - 30/n = 30(1 - 1/n) = 30(n - 1)/n.\n\nThese two are not equal, so I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the change in average isn't simply 30/n.\n\nLet me revisit the calculation of change in average.\n\nOriginal average: 30 = sum / n \u21d2 sum = 30n.\n\nNew sum: 30n - 60.\n\nNew average: (30n - 60)/(n - 1).\n\nChange in average: new average - original average = (30n - 60)/(n - 1) - 30.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n= [30n - 60 - 30(n - 1)] / (n - 1)\n\n= [30n - 60 - 30n + 30] / (n - 1)\n\n= (-30) / (n - 1).\n\nWait, this is different from what I had before.\n\nSo, change in average = -30/(n - 1).\n\nTherefore, new average = original average + change in average = 30 - 30/(n - 1).\n\nSo, new average = 30 - 30/(n - 1).\n\nThis seems consistent with the expression I derived earlier: (30n - 60)/(n - 1).\n\nLet me verify this with an example.\n\nSuppose n = 3.\n\nThen, new average = 30 - 30/(3 - 1) = 30 - 30/2 = 30 - 15 = 15, which matches my earlier example.\n\nAnother example, n = 10.\n\nNew average = 30 - 30/(10 - 1) = 30 - 30/9 \u2248 30 - 3.33 \u2248 26.67, which also matches.\n\nSo, this seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the new average age is 30 - 30/(n - 1), where n is the original number of people.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify n, so perhaps the answer should be expressed in terms of n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to find n from other information.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a constraint or additional information that I can use to find n.\n\nLet me think about it.\n\nSuppose the group has n people with an average age of 30.\n\nOne person aged 60 leaves, and I need to find the new average.\n\nBut without knowing n, I can't find a numerical value for the new average.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to assume that the group has a certain number of people, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, and it was supposed to provide the original number of people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach to this problem that I'm missing.\n\nLet me try to think about it in terms of the total age.\n\nOriginal total age = 30n.\n\nAfter removing one person aged 60, new total age = 30n - 60.\n\nNew average = (30n - 60)/(n - 1).\n\nI can try to simplify this expression.\n\nLet me perform polynomial long division on (30n - 60)/(n - 1).\n\nDividing 30n by n gives 30.\n\nMultiply 30 by (n - 1) to get 30n - 30.\n\nSubtract this from 30n - 60: (30n - 60) - (30n - 30) = -30.\n\nSo, the expression becomes 30 - 30/(n - 1), which matches what I had earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that for the new average to be an integer, n - 1 must be a divisor of 30.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that the new average is an integer, so that may not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard formula for this situation that I'm unaware of.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the person who left is the oldest or the youngest, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to test my understanding that without knowing n, the new average can't be determined numerically.\n\nIn that case, the answer should be expressed in terms of n, as I have done.\n\nTherefore, the new average age is 30 - 30/(n - 1), where n is the original number of people in the group.\n\nAlternatively, expressed as a single fraction: (30n - 60)/(n - 1).\n\nSo, unless there's more information provided, this seems to be as far as I can go.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects me to express the new average in terms of n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation of the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about a group where one person leaves, and I need to find the new average, but maybe it's a trick question, and the new average remains the same.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because removing a person who is older than the average should decrease the average.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about a sample mean and there's a statistical formula to apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the group has a certain property, like all members having the same age, but that contradicts the presence of a 60-year-old in a group with average 30.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the problem in terms of the sum of ages.\n\nOriginal sum is 30n.\n\nNew sum is 30n - 60.\n\nNew average is (30n - 60)/(n - 1).\n\nI can't see any other way to simplify this without knowing n.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be expressed in terms of n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that n is a specific value, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard method to handle such problems, and I need to follow that method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the change in average is proportional to the difference between the age of the person who left and the original average, adjusted for the number of people.\n\nIn that case, the new average would be 30 - (60 - 30)/(n - 1), but that's different from what I had earlier.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nIf the age of the person who left is above the average, the average should decrease by an amount proportional to the difference divided by the number of remaining people.\n\nBut in my earlier calculation, the change in average was -30/(n - 1), which is consistent with the difference of 30 divided by n - 1.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the new average is 30 - 30/(n - 1).\n\nSo, unless I can find n from somewhere, this seems to be the final expression for the new average.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find n using the fact that the average age changes in a specific way when the person leaves.\n\nBut without additional information, that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to test my understanding that the new average depends on the original group size.\n\nIn that case, expressing the new average in terms of n is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the new average age is 30 - 30/(n - 1), where n is the original number of people in the group.\n\nAlternatively, expressed as a single fraction: (30n - 60)/(n - 1).\n\nSo, the final answer is (30n - 60)/(n - 1), where n is the original number of people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{30n - 60}{n - 1}}\n"
