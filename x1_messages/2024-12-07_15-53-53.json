        "content": "So I've got this riddle here, and I'm trying to figure out what it is. Let's see:\n\n\"I can be moved. I can be rolled. But nothing will I hold. I'm red and I'm blue, and I can be other colors too. Having no head, though similar in shape. I have no eyes - yet move all over the place.\"\n\nOkay, first clue: \"I can be moved. I can be rolled. But nothing will I hold.\" So, it's something that can be moved and rolled, but doesn't hold anything. Hmm, maybe it's a ball? Balls can be moved and rolled, and they don't hold anything inside.\n\nNext clue: \"I'm red and I'm blue, and I can be other colors too.\" So, it's something that comes in various colors, including red and blue. A ball fits this description because balls can be made in different colors.\n\nThen: \"Having no head, though similar in shape.\" This is a bit tricky. \"No head\" might mean it doesn't have a top or a bottom, or maybe it doesn't have a distinct feature like a head. \"Similar in shape\" could mean it's round like a head, but doesn't have features like eyes or a mouth.\n\nLastly: \"I have no eyes - yet move all over the place.\" So, it moves around but doesn't have eyes. If it's a ball, people can roll it or kick it, making it move around without having any eyes.\n\nWait a minute, but balls do have a kind of \"head\" in the sense that they have a top and a bottom. Maybe it's not a ball. Let's think of something else that can be moved and rolled, comes in various colors, has no head, and moves around without eyes.\n\nCould it be a marble? Marbles can be rolled, come in different colors, and don't have any features like eyes or a head. But marbles don't really move by themselves; someone has to roll them or knock them around.\n\nThe riddle says \"yet move all over the place.\" So, it's something that moves on its own, to some extent. Maybe it's a toy that can be rolled and moves around somewhat independently.\n\nIs it a roller skate? Roller skates can be rolled, come in different colors, and don't have a head or eyes. But they do hold something\u2014they hold a person's foot. That doesn't fit with \"nothing will I hold.\"\n\nWhat about a bowling ball? It can be rolled, comes in different colors, has no head or eyes, and doesn't hold anything. But it doesn't move all over the place on its own; it just rolls where you aim it.\n\nMaybe it's a beach ball? It can be moved and rolled, comes in various colors, has no head or eyes, and doesn't hold anything. But again, it doesn't move around by itself.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a balloon? A balloon can be moved, it can be rolled if it's on the ground, comes in different colors, has no head or eyes, and doesn't hold anything except the air inside, but since it's mostly empty, maybe that counts as \"nothing will I hold.\" And balloons can move around if you blow on them or if there's wind.\n\nBut balloons aren't typically rolled; they float or are carried by the wind. Maybe not the best fit.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe it's a wheel? A wheel can be moved and rolled, comes in different colors, has no head or eyes, and doesn't hold anything. And it can move all over the place if it's attached to a vehicle.\n\nBut wheels are usually part of something bigger, like a car or a bike. They don't move by themselves unless they're detached and rolling away.\n\nHmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, what about a coin? Coins can be moved and rolled, come in different colors (though mostly gold or silver, but some coins have colored patterns), have no head (unless it's a specific type like a coin with a head on it), and no eyes. They don't hold anything, and they can be rolled around.\n\nBut the \"having no head, though similar in shape\" is a bit confusing. Coins do have images on them, which might include heads.\n\nMaybe not a coin.\n\nWhat about a button? Some buttons are round and can be rolled, come in different colors, have no head or eyes, and don't hold anything. But they don't really move around by themselves.\n\nNot sure.\n\nLet me consider something more abstract. Maybe it's not a physical object. Could it be a concept or an idea that moves around but doesn't hold anything?\n\nBut the clues about being rolled and having colors make me think it's a physical object.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a bubble? Bubbles can be moved and rolled, come in different colors (from the reflection of light), have no head or eyes, don't hold anything (empty inside), and can move all over the place with the wind.\n\nBut bubbles aren't rolled; they float and drift with the air currents.\n\nMaybe not.\n\nWhat about a ball bearing? It can be moved and rolled, comes in different colors (though usually silver or black), has no head or eyes, doesn't hold anything, and can move around in machinery.\n\nBut ball bearings are typically one color and are used in machinery. The clue says \"I'm red and I'm blue, and I can be other colors too.\" So, maybe not.\n\nPerhaps it's a colored ball used in games, like a bouncy ball. These can be red, blue, or other colors, can be rolled or thrown, have no head or eyes, don't hold anything, and can be moved all over the place during play.\n\nThat seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, could it be a marble used in marbles game? Marbles can be rolled, come in various colors, have no head or eyes, don't hold anything, and can be moved around during the game.\n\nBut similar to the ball bearing, marbles aren't typically rolled around on their own; they need to be propelled by another marble or flicked with a finger.\n\nWait, maybe it's a toy car or a remote-controlled car. These can be moved and rolled, come in different colors, have no head or eyes, don't hold anything (unless they're designed to carry something, but many don't), and can move all over the place under remote control.\n\nBut toy cars do have a shape that resembles a car, with a front and back, so they do have a sort of \"head\" in terms of directionality.\n\nThe clue says \"having no head, though similar in shape,\" which might not fit perfectly.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think about something that is round and can be rolled, comes in different colors, has no head or eyes, doesn't hold anything, and can move around.\n\nMaybe it's a hula hoop? Hula hoops can be moved and rolled, come in various colors, have no head or eyes, don't hold anything, and can be moved all over the place when people spin them around their bodies.\n\nBut hula hoops are typically one color, and they are large rings, not spherical.\n\nNot sure.\n\nWhat about a yoyo? A yoyo can be moved and rolled, comes in different colors, has no head or eyes, doesn't hold anything, and can move up and down on a string.\n\nBut it's more about moving up and down rather than rolling around.\n\nMaybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a globe? A globe can be moved and rolled, comes in different colors (though mostly earth tones), has no head or eyes, doesn't hold anything, and can be moved around on a stand.\n\nBut globes are specific and might not come in red and blue regularly.\n\nMaybe not.\n\nWhat about a stress ball? It can be moved, rolled in hands, comes in different colors, has no head or eyes, doesn't hold anything (just stress, figuratively), and can be moved around.\n\nBut it's more of a stationary object unless you're moving it in your hand.\n\nNot sure.\n\nLet me consider something from nature. Maybe a fruit? Like a tomato? Tomatoes can be red or blue (though blue tomatoes are rare), can be moved and rolled, have no head or eyes, don't hold anything, and can roll around if on an inclined surface.\n\nBut tomatoes are organic and can hold seeds, but perhaps in the context of the riddle, \"nothing will I hold\" could mean they don't hold any inedible content.\n\nMaybe.\n\nAlternatively, a marble rock? A smooth, round rock that can be rolled, comes in different colors, has no head or eyes, doesn't hold anything, and can be moved around.\n\nBut rocks are natural and might not fit the \"similar in shape\" clue.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a pill? A pill can be moved and rolled, comes in different colors, has no head or eyes, doesn't hold anything, and can roll around if on a slanted surface.\n\nBut pills are small, and the \"similar in shape\" might not apply.\n\nMaybe not.\n\nWhat about a button? Some buttons are round and can be rolled, come in different colors, have no head or eyes, don't hold anything, and can be moved around if fallen.\n\nBut buttons are typically small and not usually rolled.\n\nNot likely.\n\nLet me think outside the box. Maybe it's a bubble gum? Bubble gum can be moved and rolled, comes in different colors, has no head or eyes, doesn't hold anything, and can be moved around when chewed or played with.\n\nBut bubble gum is more associated with chewing than rolling.\n\nMaybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a ball of yarn? Yarn balls can be rolled, come in different colors, have no head or eyes, don't hold anything, and can roll around if on a slope.\n\nBut yarn balls are somewhat irregular in shape, not perfectly round.\n\nMaybe not.\n\nWhat about a spinning top? It can be moved and rolled, comes in different colors, has no head or eyes, doesn't hold anything, and can spin and move around.\n\nBut spinning tops have a specific shape with a point at the bottom.\n\nThe clue says \"having no head, though similar in shape,\" which might not fit perfectly.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me consider something that is used in sports. Maybe a rugby ball? It can be moved and rolled, comes in different colors (usually brown or yellow), has no head or eyes, doesn't hold anything, and can be moved all over the place during the game.\n\nBut rugby balls are oval-shaped, not perfectly round.\n\nMaybe not.\n\nWhat about a soccer ball? It's round, can be moved and rolled, comes in different colors, has no head or eyes, doesn't hold anything, and moves all over the place during a game.\n\nThat seems to fit well.\n\nBut let's check the colors. Soccer balls are usually black and white, or other color combinations, including red and blue.\n\nAlso, they are used in games where they are kicked and moved around the field.\n\nThe clue \"having no head, though similar in shape\" could refer to the fact that it's round like a head but has no features like eyes or a mouth.\n\nSo, a soccer ball matches all the clues:\n\n- Can be moved and rolled.\n\n- Doesn't hold anything.\n\n- Comes in red, blue, and other colors.\n\n- Has no head or eyes.\n\n- Moves all over the place during a game.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer to the riddle is a soccer ball.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{soccer ball}} \\]"
