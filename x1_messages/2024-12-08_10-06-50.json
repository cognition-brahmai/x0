        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have three primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. The artist can use up to three colors at once, but without repeating any color in a single combination. We need to find out how many unique combinations they can make.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's about combinations, not permutations, because the order in which colors are mixed probably doesn't matter for creating shades. For example, mixing red and blue should give the same result as mixing blue and red.\n\nGiven that, let's consider the different possibilities based on how many colors are used in each combination.\n\n1. **Using one color:**\n\n   - Red alone\n\n   - Blue alone\n\n   - Yellow alone\n\n   That's three combinations.\n\n2. **Using two colors:**\n\n   - Red and blue\n\n   - Red and yellow\n\n   - Blue and yellow\n\n   So, three combinations here as well.\n\n3. **Using all three colors:**\n\n   - Red, blue, and yellow\n\n   That's one combination.\n\nAdding them up: 3 (one-color) + 3 (two-colors) + 1 (three-colors) = 7 unique combinations.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to calculate this without listing them out? Yes, actually, this is a classic combination problem, where we're choosing subsets of colors without regard to order.\n\nThe formula for combinations is given by:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items,\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose,\n\n- \\( n! \\) is the factorial of n.\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 3 \\) (red, blue, yellow), and \\( k \\) can be 1, 2, or 3.\n\nSo, the total number of unique combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(3,1) + C(3,2) + C(3,3)\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\( C(3,1) = \\frac{3!}{1!(3-1)!} = \\frac{6}{1 \\times 2} = 3 \\)\n\n- \\( C(3,2) = \\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \\frac{6}{2 \\times 1} = 3 \\)\n\n- \\( C(3,3) = \\frac{3!}{3!(3-3)!} = \\frac{6}{6 \\times 1} = 1 \\)\n\nAdding them up: 3 + 3 + 1 = 7\n\nSo, that matches my earlier count.\n\nBut let's think if there's another way to look at this. Since each color can either be included or not in a combination, and there are three colors, you might think that the total number of combinations is \\( 2^3 = 8 \\). However, that includes the empty set, where no colors are chosen, which doesn't make sense in this context. So, 8 - 1 = 7, which again confirms our previous result.\n\nAnother angle: If the artist can use up to three colors, without repeating any, it's equivalent to finding all non-empty subsets of the set of three colors, which again is \\( 2^3 - 1 = 7 \\).\n\nSo, all these methods point to seven unique combinations.\n\nWait, but let's double-check if there's any possibility of more combinations if we consider different proportions of colors. For example, if the artist uses red and blue in different ratios, would that create different shades? Strictly speaking, if we're considering combinations in terms of which colors are used, regardless of proportion, then no, because the problem doesn't specify anything about the proportions. It just asks for unique combinations of colors used.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, 7 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem that could lead to a different number.\n\nSuppose the artist can choose to use no colors at all, but that doesn't make sense in the context of creating shades, so it's reasonable to exclude the empty set.\n\nAnother consideration: The problem says \"up to three colors at once, but cannot repeat any color in a single combination.\" So, using the same color more than once isn't allowed, which is already accounted for in our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if the artist could use colors multiple times but in different proportions, that would complicate things significantly, but again, the problem doesn't suggest that.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the total number of unique combinations is 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
