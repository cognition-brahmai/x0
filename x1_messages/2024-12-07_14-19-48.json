        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a class of 40 students, and 60% of them are female. First, I need to find out how many female students there are.\n\nTo do that, I'll calculate 60% of 40. Percent means per hundred, so 60% is the same as 60/100 or 0.6. Multiplying that by 40 gives me:\n\n0.6 \u00d7 40 = 24\n\nSo, there are 24 female students in the class.\n\nNow, to find out how many male students there are initially, I can subtract the number of female students from the total number of students:\n\n40 - 24 = 16\n\nSo, there are 16 male students.\n\nThe problem states that 5 more male students join the class. So, the new number of male students will be:\n\n16 + 5 = 21\n\nNow, the total number of students in the class after these new students join will be:\n\n40 + 5 = 45\n\nWe're asked to find out what percentage of the class will be female after these new male students join. The number of female students remains the same, which is 24.\n\nTo find the percentage of female students in the new total, I'll use the formula:\n\nPercentage of female students = (Number of female students / Total number of students) \u00d7 100\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n(24 / 45) \u00d7 100\n\nFirst, I'll divide 24 by 45:\n\n24 \u00f7 45 = 0.5333...\n\nNow, multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n0.5333... \u00d7 100 = 53.333...\n\nSo, the percentage of female students in the class after the new male students join is approximately 53.33%.\n\nTo double-check, I can confirm that the number of male students is 21, and the total is 45, so the number of female students is indeed 24. The calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of proportions. Initially, there are 24 females out of 40. Adding 5 males makes the total 45. The females are still 24, so their percentage is 24/45 \u00d7 100, which again is about 53.33%.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to simplify the fraction 24/45. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 3:\n\n24 \u00f7 3 = 8\n\n45 \u00f7 3 = 15\n\nSo, 8/15 \u00d7 100. Calculating 8 divided by 15 is approximately 0.5333, and multiplying by 100 gives 53.33%.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, I arrive at the same conclusion. The percentage of female students in the class after 5 more male students join is approximately 53.33%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{53.\\overline{3}\\%} \\]"
