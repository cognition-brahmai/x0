He indeed received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development. The Carter Center, which he founded in 1982 with his wife Rosalynn, has been instrumental in his work towards these goals."
