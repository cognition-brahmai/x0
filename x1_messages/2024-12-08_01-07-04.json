        "content": "Let's see. The store sells bags of candy for $5 each, and if you buy 10 or more, you get a 15% discount on the total purchase. I need to find out how much it would cost to buy 12 bags with the discount.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total cost without the discount. Since each bag is $5 and I'm buying 12 bags, I can multiply 5 by 12.\n\n5 * 12 = 60\n\nSo, without the discount, it would cost $60.\n\nNow, since I'm buying 12 bags, which is more than 10, I qualify for the 15% discount. I need to calculate what 15% of $60 is and then subtract that from the total.\n\nFirst, find 15% of 60. To find a percentage of a number, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply.\n\n15% = 0.15\n\n0.15 * 60 = 9\n\nSo, the discount is $9.\n\nNow, subtract the discount from the original total:\n\n60 - 9 = 51\n\nTherefore, the total cost to buy 12 bags with the discount applied is $51.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I did this correctly. Sometimes I get confused with percentages.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that you can calculate the discounted price by multiplying the original price by (100% - discount percentage). So, in this case, it would be 100% - 15% = 85%.\n\nSo, 85% of $60 should give me the discounted total.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n85% of 60 is 0.85 * 60 = 51\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, $51 is indeed the correct total after applying the 15% discount.\n\nI think that's straightforward. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the discount per bag and then multiply by the number of bags.\n\nFirst, find the discount per bag:\n\n15% of $5 = 0.15 * 5 = $0.75\n\nSo, each bag is discounted by $0.75.\n\nTherefore, the price per bag after discount is:\n\n$5 - $0.75 = $4.25\n\nNow, for 12 bags:\n\n$4.25 * 12 = $51\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nIt's good that all these methods give me the same answer, which reinforces that $51 is correct.\n\nI don't think there's anything else I need to consider here. The problem seems straightforward, and I've verified the calculation using different methods.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{51} \\]"
