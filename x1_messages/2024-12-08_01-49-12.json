One of the key concepts in toxicology is the dose-response relationship, which describes the change in effect on an organism caused by differing levels of exposure to a toxin over a certain period. What does the dose-response relationship in toxicology primarily describe?\nA. The effect of a toxin on the genetic makeup of an organism\nB. The effect of a toxin on the lifespan of an organism\nC. The change in effect on an organism due to varying levels of exposure to a toxin\nD. The change in effect on an organism due to varying types of toxins"

So, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The change in effect on an organism due to varying levels of exposure to a toxin\n\nThis concept is fundamental in toxicology because it helps scientists understand how the severity of the adverse effects of a substance increases with the amount of exposure. It's not about the genetic makeup or the lifespan specifically, and it's focused on different levels of the same toxin, not different types of toxins."
