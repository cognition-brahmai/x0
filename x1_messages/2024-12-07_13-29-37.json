        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Golang serverless function that processes images uploaded to Azure Blob Storage. The goal is to resize these images to specific dimensions and then save the resized versions back into the storage account. I'm not super familiar with Azure's serverless offerings, but I've worked with AWS Lambda before, so I think the concepts might be similar.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand what Azure offers for serverless computing. I think Azure has Functions, which are their version of serverless computing. So, I should look into Azure Functions with Go support. According to Microsoft's documentation, Azure Functions does support Go, so that's a good start.\n\nOkay, so to get started, I need to set up an Azure Function using Go. I should probably create a new function app in Azure, and then within that, create a function that triggers when a new image is uploaded to the Blob Storage. That sounds like a Blob trigger.\n\nSo, step one: set up an Azure Function with a Blob trigger in Go. I need to make sure that the function gets invoked whenever a new image is uploaded to a specific container in the Blob Storage.\n\nNext, within that function, I need to handle the image processing. That means resizing the image to specific dimensions. I'll need to choose a Go library that can handle image processing. I recall that Go has an image package in its standard library, which might suffice for resizing images. But I should check if there are any additional packages that might make this easier.\n\nLet me look into the Go standard library for image processing. Yes, there's \"image\" and \"image/jpeg\" and \"image/png\" packages that can be used to read and write images. For resizing, I might need to use some resampling algorithm, like bilinear or bicubic interpolation. I wonder if the standard library provides that, or if I need to find a third-party package.\n\nHmm, looking at the standard library, it seems straightforward to decode and encode images, but resizing might require me to implement or find a suitable resampling method. Maybe I can look for Go libraries that handle image resizing more efficiently.\n\nAfter a quick search, I found a library called \"github.com/disintegration/imaging\" which seems to provide easy image processing functions, including resizing. It might be overkill, but if it simplifies things, it could be worth considering.\n\nBut, since I need to keep things as lightweight as possible for a serverless function, maybe implementing a simple resizing function using the standard library would be better. Serverless functions need to be efficient in terms of resources.\n\nLet me think about the steps involved in resizing an image using the standard library:\n\n1. Decode the uploaded image to an image.Image type.\n\n2. Create a new image with the desired dimensions.\n\n3. Copy the pixels from the original image to the new image, applying the resizing algorithm.\n\nThis sounds doable, but I need to make sure that the resizing algorithm is efficient and produces acceptable quality.\n\nAlternatively, if I use a library like \"disintegration/imaging,\" it might handle a lot of these details for me, including choosing an appropriate resizing algorithm.\n\nGiven that image processing can be computationally intensive, I need to ensure that the function can handle it within Azure's serverless constraints, such as memory and execution time limits.\n\nI should check what are the resource limits for Azure Functions, especially for the consumption plan, since serverless functions typically have constraints on memory and execution time.\n\nFrom a quick glance at the Azure Functions pricing page, it seems that the consumption plan has a maximum of 1.5 GB of memory and a maximum execution time of 10 minutes. That should be sufficient for image processing tasks.\n\nNow, back to the image processing. Let's assume I'll use the standard library for resizing. I need to decide on the resizing algorithm. Bilinear interpolation is a common choice for resizing images, as it's a good balance between quality and performance.\n\nI need to implement a function that takes an image and resizes it to the specified dimensions using bilinear interpolation. I recall that bilinear interpolation involves calculating the pixel values based on the nearest four pixels from the original image.\n\nThis might be a bit involved, but I think I can manage it. Alternatively, if I find that it's too time-consuming to implement a resizing function from scratch, I can consider using the \"disintegration/imaging\" library, accepting the additional overhead.\n\nWait a minute, serverless functions are optimized for code that is stateless and completes quickly. Image processing can be CPU-intensive, so I need to make sure that the function can handle it efficiently.\n\nMaybe I can optimize the image processing by resizing the image in chunks or using goroutines to parallelize the processing. However, given that Azure Functions have a maximum of 1.5 GB of memory, I need to be careful not to exceed memory limits.\n\nAnother consideration is the input and output bindings for the Azure Function. Since it's triggered by a new blob upload, I need to read the image from the Blob Storage, process it, and then upload the resized image back to another container in the same storage account.\n\nI need to set up the function to read the input blob, process it, and write the output blob. I should also consider whether to use different containers for original and resized images to keep them organized.\n\nLet's outline the steps for the function:\n\n1. The function is triggered by a new blob upload to a specific container, say \"uploads\".\n\n2. The function reads the image from the uploaded blob.\n\n3. It decodes the image and resizes it to the specified dimensions.\n\n4. It encodes the resized image back to the appropriate format (e.g., JPEG or PNG).\n\n5. It uploads the resized image to another container, say \"resized\".\n\nI need to make sure that the function has the necessary permissions to read from and write to the Blob Storage. In Azure Functions, this can be handled by setting up appropriate bindings and configuring the function's access rights to the storage account.\n\nAlso, I should consider error handling in case the uploaded file is not an image, or if there are issues with resizing or uploading the image.\n\nAdditionally, I need to think about the specific dimensions to which the images should be resized. The task mentions \"specific dimensions,\" so I assume these dimensions are predefined. I can set these dimensions as constants in the code or perhaps read them from configuration settings.\n\nLet me consider reading the dimensions from configuration, as it provides more flexibility. That way, if I need to change the resize dimensions in the future, I don't have to redeploy the function; I can just update the configuration.\n\nIn Azure Functions, configuration settings can be set in the function app's settings, and accessed in the code using the \"os\" package.\n\nSo, I'll define configuration settings for the target width and height, and retrieve them in the function.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure. In Azure Functions with Go, the entry point is a specific function, and the bindings are defined in a function.json file.\n\nI need to set up the function directory with the go code and the function.json file that defines the trigger and bindings.\n\nFor a Blob trigger, the function.json would specify the trigger as a Blob input, and possibly another Blob output binding for the resized image.\n\nWait, actually, in Azure Functions, for Go, the bindings are handled differently. According to the Azure Functions Go developer reference, bindings are handled via annotations in the function code.\n\nBut I should verify that. Let me check the official Azure Functions documentation for Go.\n\nAfter a quick look, it seems that for Azure Functions in Go, you define the trigger and bindings directly in the function code using comments that are interpreted by the functions host.\n\nFor example, a Blob trigger would be annotated like this:\n\n// func (req http.Request) (string, error)\n\nBut actually, for Blob triggers, it's more like:\n\n// func (context.Context, azureblob.InputStream) (azureblob.OutputBlob, error)\n\nI think I need to brush up on how Azure Functions bindings work with Go.\n\nLet me look for a example of a Blob trigger in Go.\n\nFound an example in the Azure Functions Go Quickstart:\n\nThe function signature looks like this:\n\nfunc MyBlobTrigger(ctx context.Context, in azureblob.InputStream) {\n\n}\n\nSo, it seems that for a Blob trigger, the input is an InputStream, which I can read to get the image data.\n\nThen, after processing, I need to write the output to another blob. I can use the standard Azure Blob Storage SDK for Go to upload the resized image.\n\nI need to make sure that I have the Azure Storage SDK for Go included in my project. I can import it using \"github.com/Azure/azure-storage-blob-go/azblob\".\n\nAlso, I need to set up the storage account credentials. In Azure Functions, it's common to use connection strings or access keys stored in environment variables.\n\nSo, in my function code, I can retrieve the storage account connection string from an environment variable, and use it to create a storage client.\n\nWait, but for serverless functions, it's better to use managed identities or other secure ways to access storage, rather than hardcoding credentials.\n\nI should look into how to authenticate Azure Functions to access Blob Storage securely.\n\nI think Azure Functions can be assigned managed identities, which can then be granted access to the storage account. This way, the function can access the storage without needing storage account keys.\n\nThis seems like a more secure approach. I should look into setting up managed identities for my function app.\n\nAlternatively, I can use Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication for storage, where the function app uses AAD credentials to access the storage account.\n\nI need to ensure that the function has the necessary permissions to read from and write to the Blob Storage.\n\nMoving forward, assuming I have the storage client set up, I can read the input blob, process it, and upload the output blob.\n\nNow, let's think about the image processing part again. I need to resize the image to specific dimensions.\n\nIf I decide to use the \"disintegration/imaging\" library, I can install it via Go modules and use its Resize function, which should make resizing straightforward.\n\nBut, I need to consider the impact on the function's cold start time and overall performance, as adding more dependencies can increase the deployment package size and potentially slow down the function's initialization.\n\nOn the other hand, implementing resizing from scratch might save some resources, but at the cost of development time and potential quality issues.\n\nGiven that image resizing is a common task and there are established libraries for it, I think using \"disintegration/imaging\" is acceptable, especially since serverless functions are designed to handle such workloads efficiently.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with using \"disintegration/imaging\" for resizing the images.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps in code:\n\n1. Read the input blob as a byte array.\n\n2. Decode the image using the image.Decode function from the standard library.\n\n3. Use \"disintegration/imaging\" to resize the image to the target dimensions.\n\n4. Encode the resized image back to bytes in the desired format (e.g., JPEG).\n\n5. Upload the resized image to the output container in Blob Storage.\n\nI need to make sure that the function can handle different image formats, such as JPEG, PNG, etc. The image.Decode function automatically detects the format based on the header, so that should work fine.\n\nAlso, when encoding the resized image, I need to preserve the original format. So, I have to detect the format of the input image and encode the resized image in the same format.\n\nThe \"image\" package in Go provides functions like image/jpeg.Decode and image/png.Decode, but image.Decode automatically selects the decoder based on the header.\n\nSimilarly, for encoding, I need to determine the format and use the appropriate encoder.\n\nTo make this easier, I can use the \"image/jpeg\" and \"image/png\" packages accordingly.\n\nBut, to detect the format, I might need to inspect the header or use the files' extensions, which might not be reliable since the blob names may not include extensions.\n\nWait, in Blob Storage, blobs can have metadata, including content type. So, I can retrieve the content type from the input blob's metadata to determine the image format.\n\nThat sounds like a better approach. For example, if the content type is \"image/jpeg,\" I can encode the resized image using JPEG encoding.\n\nSimilarly, for \"image/png,\" I'll use PNG encoding, and so on.\n\nThis way, I can handle different image formats dynamically based on the input blob's content type.\n\nNow, let's think about error handling. There are several points where errors can occur:\n\n- Failed to read the input blob.\n\n- Failed to decode the image.\n\n- Failed to resize the image.\n\n- Failed to encode the resized image.\n\n- Failed to upload the resized image to the output container.\n\nI need to handle these errors appropriately and log them for troubleshooting.\n\nIn Azure Functions, I can use the logger provided in the context.Context to log messages.\n\nAlso, I should consider whether to return an error from the function or to handle it internally and log it.\n\nAccording to the Azure Functions Go developer reference, functions should return an error if something goes wrong, which can then be logged by the functions host.\n\nSo, I should design my function to return an error if any step fails.\n\nNow, regarding the function's scalability, since Azure Functions can scale out to handle multiple invocations concurrently, I need to make sure that my function is stateless and can handle concurrent executions without issues.\n\nGiven that the function only reads from and writes to Blob Storage and doesn't maintain any local state, it should be fine.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that the resize operation doesn't consume too many resources, as that could impact the function's performance and increase costs.\n\nTo optimize performance, I can set appropriate limits on the image dimensions to prevent processing extremely large images that could consume too much memory or CPU.\n\nAdditionally, I can consider compressing the resized images to reduce their file size, but that might be unnecessary for now.\n\nAnother consideration is caching. If the same image is uploaded multiple times, I might want to cache the resized version to avoid redundant processing. However, implementing caching would add complexity, so perhaps I can skip it for now.\n\nMoving on, I need to set up the Azure Function's bindings.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the function should be triggered by a new blob upload to the \"uploads\" container and should write the resized image to the \"resized\" container.\n\nI need to configure the function to watch for new blobs in the \"uploads\" container and, upon detection, process and save the resized image to the \"resized\" container.\n\nIn the function.json file, I would define the trigger as a Blob input and the output as a Blob output.\n\nBut since I'm using Go, the bindings are defined in the function code using comments.\n\nWait, I need to confirm this again.\n\nLooking at the Azure Functions Go developer reference, it seems that for Go functions, the bindings are defined using annotations in the function code.\n\nFor example, a Blob trigger would look like this:\n\n// func (req http.Request) (string, error)\n\nBut for Blob input, it's more like:\n\n// func (context.Context, azureblob.InputStream) (azureblob.OutputBlob, error)\n\nI need to make sure I have the correct signature for a Blob trigger.\n\nUpon further inspection, it seems that in Go, the trigger type is specified via the function's input parameters.\n\nFor a Blob trigger, the function should have an azureblob.InputStream parameter, which represents the input blob.\n\nThen, to write the output blob, I can use the standard Azure Blob Storage SDK to upload the resized image.\n\nAlternatively, I can use an azureblob.OutputBlob parameter to bind the output blob directly.\n\nBut I need to confirm how output bindings work in Go.\n\nLooking at the Azure Functions Go developer reference, it seems that output bindings can be used by returning an azureblob.OutputBlob from the function.\n\nFor example:\n\nfunc MyBlobTrigger(ctx context.Context, in azureblob.InputStream) (azureblob.OutputBlob, error) {\n\n}\n\nThen, in the function.json, I need to define the output binding.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a combination of annotations in the code and configuration in the function.json.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for a concrete example.\n\nFound an example in the Azure Functions Go repository on GitHub.\n\nHere's a Blob trigger example:\n\ntype MyBlobTriggerHandler struct {\n\n}\n\nfunc (h *MyBlobTriggerHandler) Handle(ctx context.Context, in azureblob.InputStream) (azureblob.OutputBlob, error) {\n\n}\n\nSo, it seems that for Go, you define a handler struct with a Handle method that takes context.Context and azureblob.InputStream, and returns azureblob.OutputBlob and error.\n\nThen, in the function.json, you define the trigger and bindings accordingly.\n\nI need to make sure that I set up both the code and the function.json correctly.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that the Azure Blob Storage SDK for Go is included in my project's go.mod file.\n\nNow, let's think about the deployment. Azure Functions support Go, but I need to make sure that I package the function correctly for deployment.\n\nI can use the Azure Functions Core Tools to create a new function app and deploy it to Azure.\n\nAlternatively, I can use Azure DevOps or other CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment.\n\nFor now, I'll focus on writing the function code and testing it locally before deploying it to Azure.\n\nTo test the function locally, I can use the Azure Functions Core Tools, which allow me to run the function app on my local machine and simulate Azure's environment.\n\nI need to set up the local environment with the necessary tools and configure the function app locally.\n\nOnce I have the local setup, I can test the function by uploading images to a local development storage account and verifying that the resized images are produced correctly.\n\nSpeaking of storage, I need to set up a local development storage account for testing purposes.\n\nAzure provides Azure Storage Emulator for this, which allows me to run a local instance of Blob Storage.\n\nI can use this emulator to test the function locally without incurring costs on Azure's cloud storage.\n\nOnce I'm satisfied with the local testing, I can deploy the function app to Azure and configure it to use the actual storage account.\n\nNow, let's start sketching some code.\n\nFirst, I need to set up the function signature.\n\nAssuming I'm using the handler pattern, it would look like this:\n\ntype ImageResizeHandler struct {\n\n}\n\nfunc (h *ImageResizeHandler) Handle(ctx context.Context, in azureblob.InputStream) (azureblob.OutputBlob, error) {\n\n}\n\nWithin this function, I need to read the input stream, process the image, and prepare the output blob.\n\nBut, according to the Azure Functions Go developer reference, for Blob triggers, the output can be written using the standard Azure Blob Storage SDK, rather than returning an azureblob.OutputBlob.\n\nI need to clarify this.\n\nLooking at an example in the Azure Functions Go repository, it seems that for Blob triggers, you can write the output blob separately using the storage SDK.\n\nSo, perhaps I don't need to return an azureblob.OutputBlob; instead, I can just write to the output container using the storage client.\n\nThis might be simpler, as it allows me to handle the output blob separately.\n\nSo, I'll adjust the function signature accordingly.\n\nNow, to authenticate the storage client, I need to retrieve the storage account connection string or use managed identities.\n\nAssuming I'm using managed identities, I can use the Azure Identity library to get an access token and authenticate the storage client.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that the function app has a system-assigned managed identity enabled and that this identity has appropriate permissions on the storage account.\n\nThen, in the code, I can use the \"github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity\" package to get a token and authenticate the storage client.\n\nAlternatively, if I choose to use connection strings, I can retrieve the connection string from an environment variable and use it to create the storage client.\n\nFor security reasons, using managed identities is preferable, as it avoids hardcoding credentials.\n\nSo, I'll go with managed identities.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nI need to initialize the storage client once, preferably outside the function handler, to reuse it across multiple invocations.\n\nBut in serverless functions, the lifetime of the function app can be short, and the handler might be invoked multiple times.\n\nTo optimize performance, I should initialize the storage client once and reuse it.\n\nIn Azure Functions, global variables are preserved across invocations, so I can define the storage client as a global variable.\n\nHere's a rough sketch:\n\nvar blobClient *azblob.Client\n\nfunc init() {\n\ntoken, _ := azidentity.NewDefaultAzureCredential().GetToken(context.Background(), policy.TokenRequestOptions{Scopes: []string{\"https://storage.azure.com/.default\"}})\n\n// Use the token to create a storage client\n\n}\n\ntype ImageResizeHandler struct {\n\n}\n\nfunc (h *ImageResizeHandler) Handle(ctx context.Context, in azureblob.InputStream) error {\n\n// Read input blob\n\n// Process image\n\n// Write output blob using blobClient\n\n}\n\nWait, I need to make sure that the storage client is properly initialized with the access token.\n\nAlso, I need to handle any errors that occur during token retrieval.\n\nMoreover, I should ensure that the storage client is thread-safe, as the function might be invoked concurrently.\n\nAssuming that the azblob.Client is thread-safe, this should be okay.\n\nNow, let's think about the input and output containers.\n\nI need to define the output container name, perhaps as a configuration setting.\n\nSimilarly, I might want to define the target resize dimensions as configuration settings.\n\nIn the function code, I can retrieve these settings using os.Getenv.\n\nFor example:\n\nresizeWidth := os.Getenv(\"RESIZE_WIDTH\")\n\nresizeHeight := os.Getenv(\"RESIZE_HEIGHT\")\n\noutputContainerName := os.Getenv(\"OUTPUT_CONTAINER\")\n\nI should also provide default values in case these environment variables are not set.\n\nNow, within the Handle function, I need to read the input blob's data.\n\nThe azureblob.InputStream provides a Read method, which I can use to read the image data.\n\nI can read the entire input stream into a byte array.\n\nThen, I need to decode the image using the image.Decode function.\n\nBut image.Decode requires a reader, so I can use bytes.NewReader to create a reader from the byte array.\n\nAfter decoding, I'll have an image.Image object, which I can resize using \"disintegration/imaging\".\n\nThen, I need to encode the resized image back to bytes in the original format.\n\nTo determine the original format, I can look at the input blob's content type.\n\nThe azureblob.InputStream has a Properties field, which includes the content type.\n\nSo, I can check in.Properties.ContentType to determine the image format.\n\nBased on the content type, I can choose the appropriate encoding function, such as jpeg.Encode or png.Encode.\n\nOnce I have the resized image encoded as bytes, I can upload it to the output container using the blobClient.\n\nI need to construct the output blob's name. I can use the same name as the input blob but with a prefix or suffix indicating that it's resized.\n\nFor example, if the input blob is \"original/image1.jpg,\" the output blob could be \"resized/image1.jpg.\"\n\nTo achieve this, I can extract the blob name from the input stream's properties and construct the output blob's name accordingly.\n\nAlso, I need to set the content type for the output blob appropriately based on the image format.\n\nNow, let's think about error handling in detail.\n\nAt each step, I need to check for errors and log them appropriately.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If reading the input blob fails, log an error and return it.\n\n- If decoding the image fails, log an error and return it.\n\n- If resizing the image fails, log an error and return it.\n\n- If encoding the resized image fails, log an error and return it.\n\n- If uploading the resized image to the output container fails, log an error and return it.\n\nIn addition to logging errors, I might want to consider notifying or retrying failed operations, but for now, logging should suffice.\n\nNow, regarding the resize operation, I need to make sure that the target dimensions are valid and that the image isn't being upscaled unnecessarily.\n\nI should also consider maintaining the aspect ratio, but since the task specifies \"specific dimensions,\" I assume that the dimensions are fixed and don't need to maintain the aspect ratio.\n\nHowever, to handle images with different aspect ratios, I might need to decide how to handle the resizing, such as cropping or scaling with letterboxing.\n\nThis adds complexity, so perhaps I'll assume that the images are already of suitable aspect ratios or that scaling distortion is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, I can add configuration settings to define how to handle aspect ratios, but that might be overkill for this task.\n\nMoving forward, I'll assume that the images are scaled to the specified dimensions without regard for aspect ratio.\n\nNow, let's think about performance optimizations.\n\nSince image processing can be CPU-intensive, I need to make sure that the function can handle it efficiently.\n\nI can consider using Go's image.DrawImage function with appropriate resize options, but if I'm using \"disintegration/imaging,\" it should handle optimizations internally.\n\nAdditionally, I can set the number of CPU cores that the function can use, but in serverless environments, this is typically managed by the platform.\n\nI should also make sure that the function doesn't exceed the available memory, especially for large images.\n\nTo mitigate this, I can set limits on the image size or process images in chunks, but that complicates the code.\n\nFor now, I'll assume that the images are of manageable sizes.\n\nNow, let's think about the function's trigger settings.\n\nIn the function.json file, I need to define the Blob trigger, specifying the path to the input blob.\n\nFor example, the path might be \"uploads/{blob}\", where \"uploads\" is the container name and \"{blob}\" is a wildcard for the blob name.\n\nSimilarly, the output blob would be in the \"resized\" container with the same blob name.\n\nI need to make sure that the function is triggered only for new uploads, not for existing blobs or deletions.\n\nAlso, I should consider the blob's snapshot or versioning, but for simplicity, assume single versions of blobs.\n\nNow, regarding the code organization, I should consider breaking down the image processing into a separate function for better readability and testing.\n\nFor example, I can have a function like:\n\nfunc resizeImage(img image.Image, width, height int) (image.Image, error) {\n\n// Use disintegration/imaging to resize\n\n}\n\nThen, in the Handle function, I can call this function after decoding the image and before encoding the resized image.\n\nThis makes the code more modular and easier to test.\n\nI can write unit tests for the resizeImage function to ensure it works correctly for different input images and dimensions.\n\nSimilarly, I can write integration tests for the Handle function, but that might be more involved.\n\nNow, let's think about logging.\n\nIn Azure Functions, the logger can be accessed from the context.Context using the functions.GetLogger function.\n\nSo, within the Handle function, I can get the logger like this:\n\nlogger := functions.GetLogger(ctx)\n\nThen, I can use logger.Info, logger.Error, etc., to log messages.\n\nI should log relevant information, such as the blob name being processed, any errors encountered, and success messages.\n\nThis will help in monitoring and troubleshooting the function.\n\nNow, let's consider the deployment package.\n\nAzure Functions require the deployment package to include all necessary files, including the go executable and any dependencies.\n\nI need to make sure that the go.mod and go.sum files are present, and that all dependencies are properly managed.\n\nI can use Go modules to manage dependencies, and ensure that the \"disintegration/imaging\" and Azure SDK packages are listed in go.mod.\n\nWhen deploying the function, I need to compile the Go code into an executable and include it in the deployment package.\n\nThe Azure Functions Core Tools can handle building and packaging the function app, so I don't need to worry about compiling the Go code manually.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps for implementing this function:\n\n1. Set up an Azure Function app with Go support.\n\n2. Create a new function with a Blob trigger.\n\n3. Install necessary Go packages: Azure Storage SDK, Azure Identity, and \"disintegration/imaging.\"\n\n4. Write the Handle function to read the input blob, process the image, and upload the resized image to the output container.\n\n5. Configure the function's environment variables for resize dimensions and output container name.\n\n6. Test the function locally using the Azure Storage Emulator.\n\n7. Deploy the function to Azure and configure it to use the actual storage account.\n\n8. Monitor the function's performance and logging in Azure.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable plan. I'll start by setting up the function app and creating the Blob trigger function.\n\nI need to make sure that I have the Azure Functions Core Tools installed locally, as well as Go and the necessary Azure CLI tools.\n\nOnce I have the local environment set up, I can proceed to create the function and write the code.\n\nI should also ensure that I have an Azure subscription and the necessary permissions to create function apps and storage accounts.\n\nAssuming I have access to Azure, I can proceed with the implementation.\n\nIn summary, the task involves creating an Azure Function in Go that is triggered by new blob uploads to a specific container in Azure Blob Storage. The function reads the uploaded image, resizes it to predefined dimensions using the \"disintegration/imaging\" library, and saves the resized image to another container in the same storage account. The function is designed to be efficient, secure, and easily configurable through environment variables for dimensions and output container names. Testing is performed locally using the Azure Storage Emulator before deploying to Azure."
