        "content": "Let's see here. I'm trying to figure out which option is not a characteristic of prokaryotic cells. So, first things first, I need to remember what prokaryotic cells are like.\n\nI know that prokaryotic cells are the cells of bacteria and archaea. They're different from eukaryotic cells, which are found in animals, plants, and other organisms. One of the main things I remember is that prokaryotic cells don't have a nucleus. So, option A says \"Lack of nucleus,\" and that sounds right. That's a characteristic of prokaryotic cells.\n\nNext, option B says \"Presence of cell wall.\" I think most prokaryotic cells do have cell walls. For example, bacteria have cell walls made of peptidoglycan. So, that seems like a characteristic they have.\n\nOption C is \"Presence of mitochondria.\" Now, I recall that mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, where cellular respiration takes place. In eukaryotic cells, like our own, mitochondria are present. But in prokaryotes, I think they don't have mitochondria. So, maybe this is the option that's not a characteristic of prokaryotic cells.\n\nWait a minute, but I've heard of some prokaryotes that have structures similar to mitochondria, like bacterial cells can have invaginations in their plasma membrane that function somewhat like mitochondria. But I think overall, prokaryotes don't have true mitochondria like eukaryotes do.\n\nThen there's option D, \"Presence of ribosomes.\" Ribosomes are where proteins are synthesized in cells. I know that both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have ribosomes, but the ribosomes in prokaryotes are smaller and differ in some ways from those in eukaryotes. But they do have ribosomes, so that seems like a characteristic they have.\n\nSo, putting it all together: lack of nucleus\u2014yes, that's a characteristic of prokaryotes. Presence of cell wall\u2014generally yes, though I think some prokaryotes might lack cell walls, but most have them. Presence of mitochondria\u2014no, that's not a characteristic of prokaryotes. Presence of ribosomes\u2014yes, they have ribosomes.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C, presence of mitochondria, because prokaryotic cells do not have mitochondria.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I should consider if there are any exceptions. For example, are there prokaryotic cells that have mitochondria? From what I know, mitochondria are thought to have evolved from ancient prokaryotic cells through endosymbiosis, but in modern prokaryotes, they don't have true mitochondria.\n\nSo, I feel pretty confident that C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
