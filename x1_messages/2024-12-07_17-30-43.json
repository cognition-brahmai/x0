        "content": "The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ A = 4\\pi r^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( A \\) is the surface area and \\( r \\) is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the surface area \\( A \\) is 314 square centimeters, we can plug this value into the formula and solve for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ 314 = 4\\pi r^2 \\]\n\nFirst, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate \\( \\pi r^2 \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{314}{4} = \\pi r^2 \\]\n\n\\[ 78.5 = \\pi r^2 \\]\n\nNext, we can divide both sides by \\( \\pi \\) to solve for \\( r^2 \\):\n\n\\[ r^2 = \\frac{78.5}{\\pi} \\]\n\nUsing the approximation \\( \\pi \\approx 3.1416 \\):\n\n\\[ r^2 = \\frac{78.5}{3.1416} \\approx 25 \\]\n\nFinally, take the square root of both sides to find \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ r = \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the radius of the sphere is approximately 5 centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
