        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we know there are 100 students in total in the school choir. Out of these, 60% are girls. So, to find out how many girls there are, we can calculate 60% of 100.\n\nNumber of girls = 60% of 100 = 0.60 \u00d7 100 = 60 girls\n\nSince the total number of students is 100, the number of boys would be:\n\nNumber of boys = Total students - Number of girls = 100 - 60 = 40 boys\n\nDuring the performance, 20% of the girls were absent. So, let's find out how many girls were absent.\n\nAbsent girls = 20% of 60 = 0.20 \u00d7 60 = 12 girls\n\nSimilarly, 30% of the boys were absent.\n\nAbsent boys = 30% of 40 = 0.30 \u00d7 40 = 12 boys\n\nNow, to find out how many students were present during the performance, we need to subtract the absent students from the total number of students.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of absent students.\n\nTotal absent students = Absent girls + Absent boys = 12 + 12 = 24 students\n\nTherefore, the number of students present is:\n\nStudents present = Total students - Total absent students = 100 - 24 = 76 students\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the number of girls and boys present and then add them up.\n\nPresent girls = Total girls - Absent girls = 60 - 12 = 48 girls\n\nPresent boys = Total boys - Absent boys = 40 - 12 = 28 boys\n\nStudents present = Present girls + Present boys = 48 + 28 = 76 students\n\nEither way, we arrive at the same answer. So, 76 students were present during the performance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{76} \\]"
