        "content": "Let's see. The factory currently produces 1000 units per day, and each unit brings in a profit of $10. So, the current daily profit is 1000 units times $10 per unit, which is $10,000 per day.\n\nNow, the factory is planning to increase its production by 20%. So, the new production amount will be 1000 units plus 20% of 1000 units. 20% of 1000 is 200 units, so the new production will be 1200 units per day.\n\nBut, because of increased costs, the profit per unit decreases by $2. So, the new profit per unit will be $10 minus $2, which is $8 per unit.\n\nTo find the new daily profit, we multiply the new production amount by the new profit per unit. That's 1200 units times $8 per unit.\n\nLet me calculate that: 1200 times 8 is 9600.\n\nSo, the new daily profit will be $9,600.\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. So, even though they increased production by 20% and decreased profit per unit by $2, the overall profit went down from $10,000 to $9,600.\n\nMaybe I should check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, original production: 1000 units.\n\nIncrease by 20%: 1000 * 0.20 = 200 units.\n\nSo, new production: 1000 + 200 = 1200 units.\n\nOriginal profit per unit: $10.\n\nDecrease by $2: $10 - $2 = $8 per unit.\n\nNew daily profit: 1200 units * $8 = $9,600.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of percentages.\n\nOriginal profit: 1000 units * $10 = $10,000.\n\nNew production: 120% of original production.\n\nNew profit per unit: $10 - $2 = $8, which is 80% of the original profit per unit.\n\nSo, new profit: 120% * 80% of original profit.\n\n120% of 80% is 96% of original profit.\n\n96% of $10,000 is $9,600.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the new daily profit is $9,600.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9600} \\]"
