It's like when you're walking through the Hundred Acre Wood and you hear a funny noise, but you keep going anyway because you know that you can handle whatever comes your way. It's not about being without fear, but about moving forward despite it. And sometimes, just taking that first step when you're unsure is the bravest thing you can do. So, remember, even Pooh gets scared, but he always tries his best to be brave."
