        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of people consisting of engineers, doctors, and lawyers. The relationships between their numbers are given: there are twice as many engineers as doctors, and three times as many lawyers as engineers. We need to find out how many different ways we can arrange these professionals into groups of 6, with each group having at least one engineer, one doctor, and one lawyer.\n\nFirst, let's denote the number of doctors as d. According to the problem, there are twice as many engineers as doctors, so the number of engineers is 2d. Additionally, there are three times as many lawyers as engineers, which means the number of lawyers is 3 times 2d, which is 6d.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Doctors: d\n\n- Engineers: 2d\n\n- Lawyers: 6d\n\nTotal number of people is d + 2d + 6d = 9d.\n\nNow, we need to form groups of 6 from these 9d people, with each group having at least one engineer, one doctor, and one lawyer.\n\nFirst, let's consider the total number of ways to choose any group of 6 from 9d people, without any restrictions. That would be the combination of 9d people taken 6 at a time, which is C(9d, 6).\n\nHowever, we need to subtract the groups that don't meet the requirement of having at least one from each profession. So, we need to subtract the groups that are missing at least one profession.\n\nLet's use the inclusion-exclusion principle here.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of groups that have no engineers, no doctors, or no lawyers, and then adjust for overcounting.\n\n1. Number of groups with no engineers: these groups are formed only from doctors and lawyers, so C(d + 6d, 6) = C(7d, 6).\n\n2. Number of groups with no doctors: these groups are formed only from engineers and lawyers, so C(2d + 6d, 6) = C(8d, 6).\n\n3. Number of groups with no lawyers: these groups are formed only from engineers and doctors, so C(2d + d, 6) = C(3d, 6).\n\nHowever, if we simply subtract these three from the total, we'll subtract too much because groups that are missing two professions are subtracted in two different categories. So, we need to add back the groups that are missing two professions.\n\n4. Number of groups with no engineers and no doctors: only lawyers, so C(6d, 6).\n\n5. Number of groups with no engineers and no lawyers: only doctors, so C(d, 6).\n\n6. Number of groups with no doctors and no lawyers: only engineers, so C(2d, 6).\n\nFinally, we need to subtract the groups that are missing all three professions, but since it's impossible to have a group that doesn't have any of the three professions, that would be 0.\n\nSo, applying the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nTotal valid groups = C(9d, 6) - [C(7d, 6) + C(8d, 6) + C(3d, 6)] + [C(6d, 6) + C(d, 6) + C(2d, 6)] - 0.\n\nBut wait, this gives us the number of groups of 6 that have at least one from each profession. However, the problem might be interpreted as arranging people into multiple groups of 6, each satisfying the condition, and possibly partitioning all 9d people into such groups.\n\nIf that's the case, then we need to consider partitioning the entire set of 9d people into groups of 6, with each group having at least one from each profession.\n\nThis complicates things significantly because now we have to ensure that in every group of 6, there is at least one engineer, one doctor, and one lawyer, and that all people are assigned to some group.\n\nThis sounds like a problem in combinatorial design, possibly related to block designs or multinomial coefficients, but it's quite complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to select just one group of 6 from the entire pool, with the constraints mentioned.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll assume it's about selecting one group of 6 from the pool, with the constraints.\n\nSo, sticking to the earlier calculation:\n\nTotal valid groups = C(9d, 6) - [C(7d, 6) + C(8d, 6) + C(3d, 6)] + [C(6d, 6) + C(d, 6) + C(2d, 6)].\n\nHowever, this expression still contains the variable d, which is not specified. To get a numerical answer, we need a specific value for d.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects an expression in terms of d.\n\nBut let's consider if there's a smarter way to approach this.\n\nAnother way is to consider the number of ways to choose 6 people such that there is at least one from each profession.\n\nWe can categorize the possible distributions of professions in a group of 6:\n\n- 1 engineer, 1 doctor, 4 lawyers\n\n- 1 engineer, 2 doctors, 3 lawyers\n\n- 1 engineer, 3 doctors, 2 lawyers\n\n- 1 engineer, 4 doctors, 1 lawyer\n\n- 2 engineers, 1 doctor, 3 lawyers\n\n- 2 engineers, 2 doctors, 2 lawyers\n\n- 2 engineers, 3 doctors, 1 lawyer\n\n- 3 engineers, 1 doctor, 2 lawyers\n\n- 3 engineers, 2 doctors, 1 lawyer\n\n- 4 engineers, 1 doctor, 1 lawyer\n\nWe need to list all combinations where each profession is represented at least once.\n\nThen, for each category, calculate the number of ways to choose that specific distribution, and sum them up.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. 1 engineer, 1 doctor, 4 lawyers:\n\n- Choose 1 engineer from 2d: C(2d, 1)\n\n- Choose 1 doctor from d: C(d, 1)\n\n- Choose 4 lawyers from 6d: C(6d, 4)\n\n- Total for this category: C(2d, 1) * C(d, 1) * C(6d, 4)\n\nSimilarly, for each other category, calculate the product of combinations, and sum them all up.\n\nThis approach might be more straightforward than using inclusion-exclusion, especially since the inclusion-exclusion formula can get complicated with multiple terms.\n\nLet's list all possible distributions where each profession is represented at least once, and their sum is 6.\n\nLet e be the number of engineers, d be the number of doctors, and l be the number of lawyers in the group.\n\nWe have e + d + l = 6, with e \u2265 1, d \u2265 1, l \u2265 1.\n\nWe can find all integer solutions to this equation under the constraints.\n\nPossible distributions:\n\n- (1,1,4): 1 engineer, 1 doctor, 4 lawyers\n\n- (1,2,3): 1 engineer, 2 doctors, 3 lawyers\n\n- (1,3,2): 1 engineer, 3 doctors, 2 lawyers\n\n- (1,4,1): 1 engineer, 4 doctors, 1 lawyer\n\n- (2,1,3): 2 engineers, 1 doctor, 3 lawyers\n\n- (2,2,2): 2 engineers, 2 doctors, 2 lawyers\n\n- (2,3,1): 2 engineers, 3 doctors, 1 lawyer\n\n- (3,1,2): 3 engineers, 1 doctor, 2 lawyers\n\n- (3,2,1): 3 engineers, 2 doctors, 1 lawyer\n\n- (4,1,1): 4 engineers, 1 doctor, 1 lawyer\n\nNow, for each of these, calculate the number of ways to choose that specific distribution.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. (1,1,4): C(2d,1) * C(d,1) * C(6d,4)\n\n2. (1,2,3): C(2d,1) * C(d,2) * C(6d,3)\n\n3. (1,3,2): C(2d,1) * C(d,3) * C(6d,2)\n\n4. (1,4,1): C(2d,1) * C(d,4) * C(6d,1)\n\n5. (2,1,3): C(2d,2) * C(d,1) * C(6d,3)\n\n6. (2,2,2): C(2d,2) * C(d,2) * C(6d,2)\n\n7. (2,3,1): C(2d,2) * C(d,3) * C(6d,1)\n\n8. (3,1,2): C(2d,3) * C(d,1) * C(6d,2)\n\n9. (3,2,1): C(2d,3) * C(d,2) * C(6d,1)\n\n10. (4,1,1): C(2d,4) * C(d,1) * C(6d,1)\n\nNow, sum all these up to get the total number of valid groups.\n\nThis seems manageable, but it's important to note that without a specific value for d, we can only express the answer in terms of d.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a smarter way to compute this sum.\n\nWait a minute. Let's consider generating functions for this problem.\n\nGenerating functions can be useful for counting the number of ways to select items with certain constraints.\n\nIn this case, we can model the selection of engineers, doctors, and lawyers using generating functions.\n\nThe generating function for engineers is:\n\n1 + C(2d,1)x + C(2d,2)x^2 + ... + C(2d,2d)x^{2d}\n\nSimilarly for doctors:\n\n1 + C(d,1)x + C(d,2)x^2 + ... + C(d,d)x^d\n\nAnd for lawyers:\n\n1 + C(6d,1)x + C(6d,2)x^2 + ... + C(6d,6d)x^{6d}\n\nHowever, since we're dealing with exponents summing to 6, and we have constraints that e >=1, d >=1, l >=1, we can modify the generating functions to reflect that.\n\nAlternatively, since we're only interested in groups of 6, we can look at the coefficient of x^6 in the product of the generating functions, after adjusting for the minimum requirements.\n\nBut this might be more complicated than necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion directly on the number of ways to choose groups with at least one from each profession.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose any group of 6: C(9d, 6)\n\nNumber of ways to choose groups with no engineers: C(7d, 6)\n\nNumber of ways to choose groups with no doctors: C(8d, 6)\n\nNumber of ways to choose groups with no lawyers: C(3d, 6)\n\nNow, applying inclusion-exclusion:\n\nNumber of groups with at least one from each profession = Total - (no engineers + no doctors + no lawyers) + (no engineers and no doctors + no engineers and no lawyers + no doctors and no lawyers) - (no engineers and no doctors and no lawyers)\n\nSince it's impossible to have a group with no one from any of the professions, the last term is zero.\n\nSo:\n\nNumber of valid groups = C(9d, 6) - [C(7d, 6) + C(8d, 6) + C(3d, 6)] + [C(6d, 6) + C(2d, 6) + C(d, 6)]\n\nThis seems consistent with what I had earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can factor out d to simplify the expression, but without a specific value for d, it's hard to simplify further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider d=1 for simplicity, but that might not be general enough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that d is a variable; maybe the problem expects us to work with specific numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that d must be such that all the combinations make sense, i.e., d must be at least the maximum number required from any profession in any group.\n\nFor example, in the group compositions, the maximum number required from any profession is 4 (in the case of 1 engineer, 1 doctor, 4 lawyers). So d must be at least 4 for lawyers, since there are 6d lawyers, and we're choosing up to 4.\n\nBut actually, d must be at least 1, but to have at least 4 lawyers, d needs to be at least 1, since 6d >=4 implies d >= 4/6, which is d >= 1 (since d is an integer).\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider d=1 for simplicity.\n\nLet me assume d=1 and see what happens.\n\nThen:\n\n- Doctors: 1\n\n- Engineers: 2\n\n- Lawyers: 6\n\nTotal people: 9\n\nNow, we need to form groups of 6 from these 9 people, with each group having at least one engineer, one doctor, and one lawyer.\n\nFirst, total number of ways to choose any group of 6 from 9 people: C(9,6) = 84\n\nNow, number of groups with no engineers: choosing 6 from 7 (doctors and lawyers minus engineers), but there's only 1 doctor and 6 lawyers, so 7 people. C(7,6) = 7\n\nNumber of groups with no doctors: choosing 6 from 8 (engineers and lawyers), C(8,6) = 28\n\nNumber of groups with no lawyers: choosing 6 from 3 (engineers and doctors), but there are only 3 (2 engineers and 1 doctor), so C(3,6) = 0\n\nNow, number of groups with no engineers and no doctors: only lawyers, C(6,6) = 1\n\nNumber of groups with no engineers and no lawyers: only doctors, C(1,6) = 0\n\nNumber of groups with no doctors and no lawyers: only engineers, C(2,6) = 0\n\nSo, applying inclusion-exclusion:\n\nNumber of valid groups = 84 - (7 + 28 + 0) + (1 + 0 + 0) = 84 - 35 + 1 = 50\n\nSo, with d=1, there are 50 valid groups.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a general formula in terms of d.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the number of ways to arrange all 9d people into groups of 6, each satisfying the condition.\n\nThat would be much more complex, involving partitioning the set into groups of 6 with each group satisfying the constraints, which is a complicated combinatorial problem, possibly involving multinomial coefficients and inclusion-exclusion over multiple groups.\n\nGiven the potential complexity, I'll stick with the interpretation that we're choosing a single group of 6 from the pool, with the given constraints.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways is:\n\nC(9d, 6) - [C(7d, 6) + C(8d, 6) + C(3d, 6)] + [C(6d, 6) + C(2d, 6) + C(d, 6)]\n\nThis is the most simplified expression we can get without a specific value for d.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects a specific numerical answer, then perhaps d=1, as we considered earlier, leading to 50 ways.\n\nBut to be general, the expression above is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\dbinom{9d}{6} - \\left[ \\dbinom{7d}{6} + \\dbinom{8d}{6} + \\dbinom{3d}{6} \\right] + \\left[ \\dbinom{6d}{6} + \\dbinom{2d}{6} + \\dbinom{d}{6} \\right] }"
