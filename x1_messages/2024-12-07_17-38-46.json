        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a rectangular room that's 12 meters long and 8 meters wide, and I need to cover the floor with square tiles without cutting any of them. I'm supposed to find out the largest possible size for each tile. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a floor that's 12 meters by 8 meters, and I need to lay square tiles on it without cutting any tiles. That means the tiles should fit perfectly along both the length and the width of the room. So, the size of the tile must be a divisor of both the length and the width.\n\nWait, divisor? Yes, that makes sense. If the tile's side length is a divisor of both 12 and 8, then I can fit an integer number of tiles along both the length and the width without any need to cut them.\n\nSo, I need to find the largest possible square tile that fits perfectly into both dimensions. In other words, I need to find the largest number that divides both 12 and 8. That sounds like finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12 and 8.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD of two numbers. One way is to list all the divisors of each number and find the largest one that's common to both.\n\nLet's list the divisors:\n\nFor 12:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n\nFor 8:\n\n1, 2, 4, 8\n\nNow, the common divisors are 1, 2, and 4. So, the greatest common divisor is 4.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible size for each square tile is 4 meters on each side.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nIf I have tiles that are 4 meters by 4 meters, how many would I need along the length and the width?\n\nThe length of the room is 12 meters. So, 12 divided by 4 is 3 tiles.\n\nThe width is 8 meters. So, 8 divided by 4 is 2 tiles.\n\nSo, 3 tiles along the length and 2 along the width, totaling 6 tiles covering the entire floor without any need to cut tiles. That seems perfect.\n\nIs there a larger tile that could be used? Let's see, what if I tried 5-meter tiles?\n\n5 is larger than 4, but is 5 a divisor of both 12 and 8?\n\n12 divided by 5 is 2.4, which is not an integer, meaning I'd need to cut tiles along the length.\n\n8 divided by 5 is 1.6, again not an integer, so cutting would be required along the width as well.\n\nSo, 5-meter tiles don't work without cutting.\n\nHow about 6 meters?\n\n12 divided by 6 is 2, which is fine.\n\n8 divided by 6 is approximately 1.333, which isn't an integer, so cutting would be needed along the width.\n\nSo, 6-meter tiles don't work without cutting.\n\nWhat about 7 meters?\n\n12 divided by 7 is approximately 1.714, not an integer.\n\n8 divided by 7 is approximately 1.142, not an integer.\n\nSo, 7-meter tiles don't work either.\n\nAnd 4 meters is the largest tile size that divides both 12 and 8 evenly.\n\nWait, but is there a mathematical way to confirm that 4 is indeed the largest possible?\n\nYes, the GCD method seems correct, but maybe I can use another method to confirm.\n\nAnother way to find the GCD is to use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly applying the formula:\n\nGCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a mod b), where a mod b is the remainder of a divided by b.\n\nLet's apply that to 12 and 8.\n\nFirst step:\n\nGCD(12, 8) = GCD(8, 12 mod 8)\n\n12 mod 8 is 4, since 8 goes into 12 once with a remainder of 4.\n\nSo, GCD(8, 4)\n\nNext step:\n\nGCD(8, 4) = GCD(4, 8 mod 4)\n\n8 mod 4 is 0, since 4 divides 8 evenly.\n\nSo, GCD(4, 0)\n\nWhen we reach GCD(a, 0), it's equal to a.\n\nTherefore, GCD(4, 0) = 4.\n\nSo, the GCD of 12 and 8 is indeed 4.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible tile size is 4 meters on each side.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any larger common divisor that we might have missed.\n\nThe prime factors of 12 are 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3.\n\nThe prime factors of 8 are 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2.\n\nThe common prime factors are two 2's, so 2 \u00d7 2 = 4.\n\nAgain, confirming that 4 is the GCD.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nGCD(a, b) = (a \u00d7 b) / LCM(a, b)\n\nFirst, find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 8.\n\nMultiples of 12: 12, 24, 36, 48, ...\n\nMultiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, ...\n\nThe least common multiple is 24.\n\nSo, GCD(12, 8) = (12 \u00d7 8) / 24 = 96 / 24 = 4.\n\nAgain, confirming that the GCD is 4.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible tile size is 4 meters.\n\nBut let's think about this in terms of area too, just to make sure.\n\nThe area of the room is 12 meters \u00d7 8 meters = 96 square meters.\n\nIf I use 4-meter tiles, each tile has an area of 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 square meters.\n\nSo, 96 / 16 = 6 tiles, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nIs there a way to use larger tiles without cutting?\n\nWell, if I consider tiles larger than 4 meters, like 5 meters, but as I saw earlier, 5 doesn't divide both 12 and 8 evenly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using tiles of different sizes, but the problem specifies square tiles of the same size without cutting any.\n\nSo, sticking to the GCD approach seems to be the right method.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the largest possible tile size is 4 meters.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions \"square tiles,\" which implies that the tiles are square, so the length and width are equal.\n\nI've found that 4 meters is the largest size that divides both dimensions evenly.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider?\n\nPerhaps the thickness of the grout between tiles or something like that, but the problem doesn't mention any such details.\n\nSo, assuming that tiles can be placed edge-to-edge, the GCD approach seems appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to tile the floor with larger tiles by arranging them in a certain pattern, but given the constraints, I don't think that's possible without cutting tiles.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 4 meters.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me consider if there's any other common divisor larger than 4.\n\nLooking back at the list of divisors:\n\n12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n\n8: 1, 2, 4, 8\n\nCommon divisors: 1, 2, 4\n\nSo, no, 4 is the largest common divisor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering decimal sizes, but the problem doesn't specify that tile sizes have to be integers.\n\nWait a minute, does it say that tile sizes have to be integers?\n\nLet me check the problem statement: \"A rectangular room has a length of 12 meters and a width of 8 meters. If you want to place square tiles on the floor without cutting any tiles, what is the largest possible size for each tile?\"\n\nIt doesn't specify that tile sizes have to be integers, so maybe there's a larger tile size that's not an integer.\n\nFor example, maybe a tile size of 4.8 meters or something like that.\n\nLet me explore that idea.\n\nSuppose the tile size is x meters.\n\nThen, 12 divided by x should be an integer, and 8 divided by x should also be an integer.\n\nSo, x must be a divisor of both 12 and 8.\n\nBut in the context of tiling, it's standard to use tiles of integer sizes, but technically, x could be any common divisor, not necessarily integer.\n\nHowever, in practical terms, tile sizes are usually in standard measurements like meters, centimeters, etc., but for the sake of this problem, I'll consider any real number x that divides both 12 and 8 evenly.\n\nSo, x must satisfy:\n\n12 / x = integer, and 8 / x = integer.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nIf x divides both 12 and 8, then x must be a common divisor of 12 and 8.\n\nBut in real numbers, any real number that divides both 12 and 8 would have to be a multiple of the greatest common divisor.\n\nWait, that doesn't make complete sense.\n\nPerhaps I should think in terms of the GCD in real numbers.\n\nIn real numbers, the concept of GCD is different because any two real numbers have no greatest common divisor in the same sense as integers.\n\nBut in this context, since we're dealing with measurements in meters, and tile sizes that divide both dimensions evenly, it's still appropriate to consider the GCD in terms of the largest x that divides both 12 and 8.\n\nGiven that, the GCD approach still holds, and 4 meters is the largest such x.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider x to be 4 meters, as we've already established, it divides both 12 and 8 evenly.\n\nIf I try x = 4.8 meters:\n\n12 / 4.8 = 2.5, which is not an integer, so I'd need to cut tiles.\n\n8 / 4.8 \u2248 1.666, which is also not an integer, so again, cutting would be required.\n\nSimilarly, x = 4.5 meters:\n\n12 / 4.5 \u2248 2.666, not an integer.\n\n8 / 4.5 \u2248 1.777, not an integer.\n\nx = 4.2 meters:\n\n12 / 4.2 \u2248 2.857, not an integer.\n\n8 / 4.2 \u2248 1.905, not an integer.\n\nSo, no, non-integer sizes larger than 4 meters don't work without cutting tiles.\n\nTherefore, 4 meters is indeed the largest possible tile size.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using some tiling pattern where tiles are arranged in a non-standard way, but given the constraints, I don't think that's possible without cutting tiles.\n\nHence, the answer is 4 meters.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nMaybe the tiles don't have to be entirely within the room; perhaps some overhang is allowed.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as typically tiles are expected to cover the floor completely without overhanging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tiles can be arranged diagonally, but that would likely require cutting tiles to fit the edges, which is against the problem's constraints.\n\nTherefore, the best and largest tile size that fits perfectly without cutting is 4 meters.\n\nSo, the final answer is 4 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
