Trees have rings, but they don't have fingers. Yeah, that could be it. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there's another answer. Let me think some more. Maybe it's a ringed planet like Saturn? It has rings, but obviously, it's not a finger thing. But the riddle seems too simple for that. Maybe it is a tree after all. Yeah, I think the answer is a tree."
