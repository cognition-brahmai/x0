        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a TypeScript class for a \"Car\" with the specified properties and methods. Then, I'll show you how to create a test program to demonstrate its functionality.\n\nFirst, let's define the Car class. It should have properties for make, model, year, and color. We'll also include methods to start the engine, accelerate, brake, and display car information.\n\nHere's how you can structure the Car class in TypeScript:\n\n```typescript\nclass Car {\n    make: string;\n    model: string;\n    year: number;\n    color: string;\n    engineOn: boolean;\n    speed: number;\n\n    constructor(make: string, model: string, year: number, color: string) {\n        this.make = make;\n        this.model = model;\n        this.year = year;\n        this.color = color;\n        this.engineOn = false;\n        this.speed = 0;\n    }\n\n    startEngine(): void {\n        if (!this.engineOn) {\n            this.engineOn = true;\n            console.log(\"Engine started.\");\n        } else {\n            console.log(\"Engine is already running.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    stopEngine(): void {\n        if (this.engineOn) {\n            this.engineOn = false;\n            this.speed = 0;\n            console.log(\"Engine stopped.\");\n        } else {\n            console.log(\"Engine is already stopped.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    accelerate(amount: number): void {\n        if (this.engineOn) {\n            this.speed += amount;\n            console.log(`Accelerated by ${amount} km/h. Current speed: ${this.speed} km/h.`);\n        } else {\n            console.log(\"Cannot accelerate. Engine is not running.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    brake(amount: number): void {\n        if (this.engineOn && this.speed >= amount) {\n            this.speed -= amount;\n            console.log(`Braked by ${amount} km/h. Current speed: ${this.speed} km/h.`);\n        } else if (this.speed < amount) {\n            console.log(\"Cannot brake by that amount. Current speed is lower.\");\n            this.speed = 0;\n            console.log(\"Current speed: 0 km/h.\");\n        } else {\n            console.log(\"Cannot brake. Engine is not running.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    displayInfo(): void {\n        console.log(`Make: ${this.make}`);\n        console.log(`Model: ${this.model}`);\n        console.log(`Year: ${this.year}`);\n        console.log(`Color: ${this.color}`);\n        console.log(`Engine: ${this.engineOn ? \"On\" : \"Off\"}`);\n        console.log(`Speed: ${this.speed} km/h`);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's create a simple test program to demonstrate the functionality of the Car class.\n\n```typescript\nfunction main() {\n    const myCar = new Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2022, \"Silver\");\n\n    myCar.displayInfo();\n\n    myCar.startEngine();\n    myCar.accelerate(50);\n    myCar.brake(20);\n    myCar.stopEngine();\n\n    myCar.displayInfo();\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nIn this test program, we create an instance of the Car class, display its initial information, start the engine, accelerate, brake, stop the engine, and finally display the information again to see the changes.\n\nMake sure you have TypeScript installed to compile and run this code. You can install TypeScript using npm if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g typescript\n```\n\nThen, save your Car class and test program in a file, for example, `car.ts`, and compile it using:\n\n```bash\ntsc car.ts\n```\n\nThis will generate a JavaScript file (`car.js`) that you can run using Node.js:\n\n```bash\nnode car.js\n```\n\nThis should output the car's information and actions as defined in the test program.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
