        "content": "Let's see. The baker makes 12 loaves of bread every hour, and the bakery is open for 8 hours a day. I need to find out how many loaves the baker makes in a week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many loaves are made in one day. Since the baker makes 12 loaves per hour and works for 8 hours a day, I can multiply 12 by 8 to get the daily total.\n\n12 loaves/hour \u00d7 8 hours/day = 96 loaves/day\n\nSo, the baker makes 96 loaves each day.\n\nNow, to find out the weekly total, I need to know how many days the bakery is open in a week. Assuming the bakery is open every day of the week, that would be 7 days.\n\nSo, 96 loaves/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 672 loaves/week\n\nTherefore, the baker makes 672 loaves in a week.\n\nBut wait, maybe the bakery isn't open every day. The problem says \"the bakery is open for 8 hours a day,\" but it doesn't specify how many days a week it's open. If it's open every day, then my calculation is correct. If not, I need to adjust the number of days.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should check if there's any information about the number of days the bakery is open. Let me look back at the problem.\n\n\"A baker makes 12 loaves of bread every hour. If the bakery is open for 8 hours a day, how many loaves does the baker make in a week?\"\n\nIt doesn't specify the number of days the bakery is open, so maybe I should assume it's open every day. But in real life, bakeries might be closed on certain days.\n\nTo be safe, I'll assume it's open every day unless stated otherwise. So, my original calculation stands: 12 loaves/hour \u00d7 8 hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 672 loaves/week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it. Perhaps the baker works 8 hours each day but only works a certain number of days a week. But again, the problem doesn't specify, so I'll stick with 7 days.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the total hours worked in a week and then multiply by the hourly production rate.\n\nSo, hours per day: 8\n\nDays per week: 7\n\nTotal hours per week: 8 \u00d7 7 = 56 hours\n\nLoaves per hour: 12\n\nTotal loaves per week: 56 hours \u00d7 12 loaves/hour = 672 loaves\n\nSame result as before.\n\nI think 672 loaves is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{672} \\]\n"
