        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the city is planning to build a sports complex with a soccer field, some basketball courts, a swimming pool, and possibly a tennis court too. They have a total budget of $5 million for this project. My task is to figure out if there's enough money left after building the initial facilities to also build that tennis court.\n\nFirst, I need to know exactly how much each of these facilities costs. According to the information:\n\n- The soccer field costs $1.2 million.\n\n- There are three basketball courts, each costing $300,000.\n\n- The swimming pool costs $2 million.\n\n- The tennis court costs $500,000.\n\nBut the tennis court is not part of the initial plan; it's something they want to add if there's money left over.\n\nSo, I need to calculate the total cost of the initial facilities and then see what's left from the $5 million budget. Finally, I'll check if that remaining amount is enough for the tennis court.\n\nLet me start by calculating the cost of the basketball courts. There are three of them, each costing $300,000. So, I'll multiply 3 by $300,000:\n\n3 * $300,000 = $900,000.\n\nOkay, so the basketball courts together cost $900,000.\n\nNow, I'll add up the costs of all the initial facilities:\n\nSoccer field: $1,200,000\n\nBasketball courts: $900,000\n\nSwimming pool: $2,000,000\n\nLet's add these together:\n\n$1,200,000 + $900,000 = $2,100,000\n\nThen, $2,100,000 + $2,000,000 = $4,100,000.\n\nSo, the total cost for the initial facilities is $4.1 million.\n\nNow, the total budget is $5 million. To find out how much is left after building these facilities, I'll subtract the total cost from the budget:\n\n$5,000,000 - $4,100,000 = $900,000.\n\nOkay, so there's $900,000 left after building the soccer field, basketball courts, and swimming pool.\n\nNow, the question is, is there enough left to build an additional tennis court that costs $500,000.\n\nWell, $900,000 is greater than $500,000, so yes, there is enough money left to build the tennis court.\n\nTo be thorough, let's confirm this by subtracting the cost of the tennis court from the remaining budget:\n\n$900,000 - $500,000 = $400,000.\n\nSo, after building the tennis court, there would still be $400,000 left from the original $5 million budget.\n\nTherefore, not only is it possible to build the tennis court, but there would also be some money remaining.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the cost of the basketball courts: 3 courts at $300,000 each is indeed $900,000.\n\nTotal initial facilities cost: $1,200,000 (soccer) + $900,000 (basketball) + $2,000,000 (swimming) = $4,100,000.\n\nSubtracting from the $5,000,000 budget: $5,000,000 - $4,100,000 = $900,000 remaining.\n\nCost of tennis court: $500,000.\n\nRemaining after building tennis court: $900,000 - $500,000 = $400,000.\n\nEverything checks out. So, yes, there is enough money left to build the tennis court.\n\nIn fact, with $400,000 remaining, perhaps they can consider adding some additional amenities or setting aside funds for future expansions or maintenance.\n\nBut based on the question, the main goal was to see if the tennis court can be built within the remaining budget, and it seems that it can.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yes, there is enough money left to build the tennis court.}} \\]"
