        "content": "Let's see. The customer is buying three different types of fruits: apples, oranges, and bananas. Each fruit has a different price per pound. Apples are $2 per pound, oranges are $3 per pound, and bananas are $1 per pound. The customer is buying 4 pounds of apples, 5 pounds of oranges, and 6 pounds of bananas. I need to find out the total cost.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the cost for each type of fruit separately and then add them all up to get the total.\n\nStarting with apples:\n\nApples cost $2 per pound, and the customer is buying 4 pounds.\n\nSo, the cost for apples is 2 * 4 = $8.\n\nNext, oranges:\n\nOranges cost $3 per pound, and the customer is buying 5 pounds.\n\nSo, the cost for oranges is 3 * 5 = $15.\n\nThen, bananas:\n\nBananas cost $1 per pound, and the customer is buying 6 pounds.\n\nSo, the cost for bananas is 1 * 6 = $6.\n\nNow, I need to add up the costs of all three fruits to get the total amount spent.\n\nTotal cost = cost of apples + cost of oranges + cost of bananas\n\nTotal cost = 8 + 15 + 6\n\nLet's add those up: 8 + 15 is 23, and 23 + 6 is 29.\n\nSo, the total amount the customer will spend is $29.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nApples: 2 * 4 = 8, that's correct.\n\nOranges: 3 * 5 = 15, that's correct.\n\nBananas: 1 * 6 = 6, that's correct.\n\nTotal: 8 + 15 + 6 = 29, that seems right.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{29} \\]"
