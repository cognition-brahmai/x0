        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two teams, Team A and Team B, and Team A has one more person than Team B. Then, if 4 people switch from Team A to Team B, Team B will have twice as many members as Team A will have at that point. We need to find out how many people are in the group overall.\n\nFirst, let's assign some variables to make this easier. Let's say that Team B has \\(x\\) people. Since Team A has one more person than Team B, Team A has \\(x + 1\\) people.\n\nNow, if 4 people switch from Team A to Team B, then Team A will have \\(x + 1 - 4 = x - 3\\) people, and Team B will have \\(x + 4\\) people.\n\nAccording to the problem, after this switch, Team B will have twice as many members as Team A. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[x + 4 = 2(x - 3)\\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\(x\\):\n\nFirst, expand the right side:\n\n\\[x + 4 = 2x - 6\\]\n\nNow, let's move all the x terms to one side and the constants to the other side. Subtract \\(x\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[4 = x - 6\\]\n\nThen, add 6 to both sides:\n\n\\[10 = x\\]\n\nSo, Team B has 10 people, and Team A has \\(10 + 1 = 11\\) people.\n\nTo check, if 4 people switch from Team A to Team B, Team A will have \\(11 - 4 = 7\\) people, and Team B will have \\(10 + 4 = 14\\) people. Is 14 twice as many as 7? Yes, it is.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people in the group is \\(10 + 11 = 21\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]"
