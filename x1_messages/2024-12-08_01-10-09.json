        "content": "So the factory makes 100 widgets every hour, and each one has a 5% chance of being defective. It runs for 8 hours a day. I need to find out, on average, how many defective widgets are made in one day.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many widgets are produced in a whole day. Since it makes 100 per hour and operates for 8 hours, I can multiply those together:\n\n100 widgets/hour * 8 hours = 800 widgets per day.\n\nNow, each widget has a 5% chance of being defective. To find out how many are defective on average, I can take the total number of widgets and multiply by the probability of being defective.\n\nSo, 800 widgets * 5% defective.\n\nBut percent means per hundred, so 5% is the same as 5/100 or 0.05.\n\nSo, 800 * 0.05 = 40.\n\nTherefore, on average, 40 defective widgets are produced each day.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf each widget has a 5% chance of being defective, and there are 800 widgets in a day, then the expected number of defective ones would indeed be 800 times 0.05, which is 40.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it per hour. In one hour, 100 widgets are made, with each having a 5% chance of being defective. So per hour, the expected number of defective widgets is 100 * 0.05 = 5.\n\nSince the factory operates for 8 hours, then over the course of the day, it would be 5 defective widgets per hour times 8 hours, which also gives 40 defective widgets.\n\nSo, both ways, I end up with 40. That seems consistent.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using probabilities or statistics?\n\nWell, the number of defective widgets can be modeled using a binomial distribution, where each widget is a trial with two outcomes: defective or not defective. The probability of success (in this case, a defective widget, which is usually considered a failure, but in terms of probability, it's just the event occurring) is p = 0.05, and the number of trials is n = 800.\n\nThe expected value for a binomial distribution is given by E(X) = n * p.\n\nSo again, E(X) = 800 * 0.05 = 40.\n\nSo, no matter how I look at it, the average number of defective widgets per day is 40.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
