        "content": "So I've got this problem here about planning a sports complex. The city has allocated a total of 150,000 square feet for the project. This space needs to accommodate a soccer field, some basketball courts, and a swimming pool. The soccer field needs 80,000 square feet, each basketball court needs 5,000 square feet, and the swimming pool will take up 25,000 square feet. I need to figure out how many basketball courts can be built within the available space and also calculate the remaining open space after constructing all the facilities.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how much total space is needed for the soccer field and the swimming pool, since those are fixed sizes, and then see how much space is left for the basketball courts.\n\nSo, the soccer field is 80,000 square feet, and the swimming pool is 25,000 square feet. Adding those together:\n\n80,000 + 25,000 = 105,000 square feet.\n\nNow, the total allocated land is 150,000 square feet. So, the remaining space for basketball courts would be:\n\n150,000 - 105,000 = 45,000 square feet.\n\nEach basketball court requires 5,000 square feet, so to find out how many can be built, I'll divide the remaining space by the area needed per court:\n\n45,000 \u00f7 5,000 = 9.\n\nSo, they can build 9 basketball courts.\n\nNow, to find the remaining open space after constructing all the facilities, I need to calculate the total space used by the soccer field, swimming pool, and the 9 basketball courts, and then subtract that from the total allocated land.\n\nFirst, space used by basketball courts:\n\n9 courts \u00d7 5,000 square feet per court = 45,000 square feet.\n\nAdding that to the soccer field and swimming pool:\n\n45,000 + 80,000 + 25,000 = 150,000 square feet.\n\nSo, the total space used is 150,000 square feet, which is exactly the allocated land. That means there would be no remaining open space.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem might be expecting me to consider that there could be paths, landscaping, or other features that take up additional space, but based on the information given, it seems like all the space is accounted for by the facilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the total land is 150,000 square feet, and the facilities take up 105,000 + 45,000 = 150,000 square feet, so indeed, there's no open space left.\n\nBut perhaps I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nTotal land: 150,000 sq ft.\n\nSoccer field: 80,000 sq ft.\n\nSwimming pool: 25,000 sq ft.\n\nTotal for soccer and pool: 80,000 + 25,000 = 105,000 sq ft.\n\nRemaining for basketball courts: 150,000 - 105,000 = 45,000 sq ft.\n\nEach basketball court: 5,000 sq ft.\n\nNumber of basketball courts: 45,000 \u00f7 5,000 = 9.\n\nTotal space used by basketball courts: 9 \u00d7 5,000 = 45,000 sq ft.\n\nTotal space used overall: 80,000 + 25,000 + 45,000 = 150,000 sq ft.\n\nRemaining open space: 150,000 - 150,000 = 0 sq ft.\n\nSo, it seems correct. They can build 9 basketball courts, and there will be no remaining open space.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect this, like walkways or parking areas, but the problem doesn't mention anything about those. It only specifies the soccer field, basketball courts, and swimming pool.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the swimming pool takes up 25,000 square feet, but maybe it needs additional space around it for decks or areas, but again, the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nGiven the information provided, my answer remains that they can build 9 basketball courts with no remaining open space.\n\nWait, but in reality, there would probably need to be some open space for pathways, restrooms, changing rooms, etc., but since those aren't mentioned, I'll stick with the given figures.\n\nSo, final answer: 9 basketball courts and 0 remaining open space.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9 \\text{ basketball courts and } 0 \\text{ remaining open space}} \\]"
