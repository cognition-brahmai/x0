        "content": "The process of turning an mRNA sequence into a protein is called translation. So, the correct answer is C. Translation.\n\nTo elaborate a bit, let's consider the central dogma of molecular biology, which outlines the flow of genetic information in cells. It typically goes from DNA to RNA to proteins. Here's a brief overview of the relevant steps:\n\n1. **Replication**: This is the process where DNA makes a copy of itself before cell division. It ensures that each new cell gets an identical set of genetic instructions.\n\n2. **Transcription**: In this step, the genetic information from DNA is transcribed into mRNA (messenger RNA). This happens in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. The mRNA carries the code from the DNA to the ribosomes, which are the sites of protein synthesis.\n\n3. **Translation**: This is the process where the mRNA sequence is decoded to synthesize proteins. It occurs on ribosomes, which can be free in the cytoplasm or bound to the endoplasmic reticulum. During translation, the mRNA sequence is read in triplets called codons, each of which specifies a particular amino acid. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bring the corresponding amino acids to the ribosome, where they are linked together to form the polypeptide chain that will fold into a functional protein.\n\n4. **Mutation**: This refers to any change in the DNA sequence. Mutations can occur naturally due to errors in DNA replication or be induced by external factors like radiation or chemicals. Some mutations can affect the sequence of mRNA and, consequently, the proteins produced, potentially leading to genetic disorders or evolutionary changes.\n\nSo, in the context of your question, translation is the key process that converts the mRNA sequence into a protein.
