But maybe you're thinking about flowers that look like roses but aren't actually roses? There are definitely flowers that resemble roses, like some types of hydrangeas or climbing plants like the Rosa x Fortuniana, which is a hybrid between a rose and another plant. But those aren't true roses. So, in a way, there are \"roses\" that aren't actually roses, but they're imitations or hybrids."
