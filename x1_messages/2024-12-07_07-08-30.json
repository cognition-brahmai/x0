        "content": "So the factory makes 200 widgets every hour, but 5% of them are defective and have to be thrown away. It works for 8 hours a day, and I need to find out how many good widgets it makes each day.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many widgets are made in a day. Since it produces 200 widgets per hour and works for 8 hours, I can multiply 200 by 8 to get the total number of widgets produced daily.\n\n200 widgets/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 1,600 widgets per day.\n\nNow, out of these 1,600 widgets, 5% are defective. So, I need to find out what 5% of 1,600 is to know how many widgets are discarded.\n\nTo find 5% of 1,600, I can calculate it as (5/100) \u00d7 1,600.\n\n(5/100) \u00d7 1,600 = 0.05 \u00d7 1,600 = 80 widgets.\n\nSo, 80 widgets are defective and must be discarded.\n\nTo find the number of non-defective widgets, I subtract the defective ones from the total produced.\n\n1,600 widgets - 80 widgets = 1,520 widgets.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 1,520 non-defective widgets daily.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe I can calculate the percentage of non-defective widgets directly.\n\nIf 5% are defective, then 100% - 5% = 95% are non-defective.\n\nSo, I can find 95% of the total widgets produced to get the number of non-defective ones.\n\n95% of 1,600 is (95/100) \u00d7 1,600 = 0.95 \u00d7 1,600 = 1,520 widgets.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of non-defective widgets per hour and then multiply by the number of hours the factory operates.\n\nFirst, find the number of non-defective widgets per hour.\n\n200 widgets/hour - (5% of 200) = 200 - (0.05 \u00d7 200) = 200 - 10 = 190 widgets per hour.\n\nThen, multiply by 8 hours: 190 \u00d7 8 = 1,520 widgets per day.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think no matter which method I use, I end up with 1,520 non-defective widgets produced daily.\n\nIt's good to see that all approaches lead to the same answer, which reinforces that it's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1,520 non-defective widgets per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1520} \\]"
