What's the fifth daughter's name?\n\nHmm, it seems like the names are all variations of \"NAN\" with different vowels. Nana, Nene, Nini, Nono. So, following that pattern, the fifth daughter's name might be something like \"Nunu\" or \"Namo\". But that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait a minute, the question says Mary's father has five daughters, and it lists four names: Nana, Nene, Nini, Nono. So, the fifth daughter should be Mary herself, since Mary is also a daughter of the father.\n\nSo, the fifth daughter's name is Mary.\n\nBut let's think about it differently. Maybe it's a trick question. If the father has five daughters, and they are named Nana, Nene, Nini, Nono, and... well, the names all start with \"N\", but maybe one of them has a different name.\n\nBut the question specifies that these are the five daughters, named Nana, Nene, Nini, Nono, and... well, it's asking for the fifth one.\n\nWait, perhaps the names are Nana, Nene, Nini, Nono, and Mary.\n\nBut the question says Mary's father has five daughters: Nana, Nene, Nini, Nono. So, maybe Mary is the fifth daughter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the names are all supposed to be \"Nana\", \"Nene\", \"Nini\", \"Nono\", and \"Nana\"?\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the names are Nana, Nene, Nini, Nono, and another one with a different vowel, like \"Nunu\".\n\nBut I think the most logical answer is that the fifth daughter is Mary.\n\nSo, the answer is Mary.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Mary}} \\]"
