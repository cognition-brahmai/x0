        "content": "Certainly! Below is a Python function that generates the first 'n' terms of Pascal's triangle:\n\n```python\ndef generate_pascals_triangle(n):\n    triangle = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        row = [1] * (i+1)\n        for j in range(1, i):\n            row[j] = triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i-1][j]\n        triangle.append(row)\n    \n    return triangle\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 5\nresult = generate_pascals_triangle(n)\nfor row in result:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis function works by iteratively building each row of the triangle. It starts with the first row, which is always [1]. For each subsequent row, it calculates the elements based on the previous row. Each element in the row (except the first and last) is the sum of the two elements directly above it in the previous row.\n\nThe function takes an integer 'n' as input, which represents the number of rows to generate. It returns a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of Pascal's triangle.\n\nIn the example usage, we generate the first 5 rows of Pascal's triangle and print each row. The output will be:\n\n```\n[1]\n[1, 1]\n[1, 2, 1]\n[1, 3, 3, 1]\n[1, 4, 6, 4, 1]\n```\n\nThis matches the structure of Pascal's triangle, where each number is the sum of the two directly above it."
