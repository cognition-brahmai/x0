        "content": "I have this problem here. There are two boxes: one with 100 black marbles and another with 100 white marbles. I need to redistribute these marbles into the two boxes to maximize the probability of drawing a black marble. I have to pick a box at random and then draw a marble from that box.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current setup. Right now, one box has only black marbles, and the other has only white marbles. So, if I pick a box at random, I have a 50% chance of picking either box. If I pick the black marble box, I'm guaranteed to draw a black marble, and if I pick the white marble box, I'm guaranteed to draw a white marble.\n\nSo, the current probability of drawing a black marble is 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0 = 0.5 or 50%. I need to find a way to arrange the marbles to get a higher probability than that.\n\nLet me think about how to redistribute the marbles. I can put some black marbles in one box and some white marbles in the other, or maybe have a mix in both boxes. I need to see what arrangement gives me the highest probability of drawing a black marble.\n\nSuppose I move some black marbles to the white marble box and vice versa. Let's say I move x black marbles to the white marble box and x white marbles to the black marble box. Then, one box would have (100 - x) black marbles and x white marbles, and the other box would have x black marbles and (100 - x) white marbles.\n\nNow, if I pick a box at random, the probability of picking either box is still 0.5. So, the total probability of drawing a black marble would be:\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * (number of black marbles in box 1 / total marbles in box 1) + 0.5 * (number of black marbles in box 2 / total marbles in box 2)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * [(100 - x) / (100 - x + x)] + 0.5 * [x / (x + 100 - x)]\n\nSimplify the denominators:\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * [(100 - x) / 100] + 0.5 * [x / 100]\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * (100 - x)/100 + 0.5 * x/100\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * (1 - x/100) + 0.5 * (x/100)\n\nP(black) = 0.5 - 0.5x/100 + 0.5x/100\n\nP(black) = 0.5\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, moving an equal number of marbles between the boxes doesn't change the probability. It's still 50%. That's interesting.\n\nMaybe I need to try a different approach. What if I don't move an equal number of marbles? Suppose I move only one black marble to the white marble box and don't move any white marbles to the black marble box.\n\nSo, box 1 would have 99 black marbles, and box 2 would have 1 black marble and 100 white marbles.\n\nThen, the probability of drawing a black marble would be:\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * (99 / 99) + 0.5 * (1 / 101)\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (1/101)\n\nP(black) = 0.5 + 0.5/101\n\nP(black) = 0.5 + approximately 0.00495\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.50495 or about 50.495%\n\nThat's slightly better than before. Maybe I can maximize this by adjusting the number of black marbles in the second box.\n\nLet me generalize this. Suppose I put one black marble in one box and the rest of the marbles in the other box.\n\nSo, box 1: 1 black marble and 100 white marbles.\n\nBox 2: 99 black marbles.\n\nThen, P(black) = 0.5 * (1 / 101) + 0.5 * (99 / 99)\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * (1/101) + 0.5 * 1\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * 0.0099 + 0.5 * 1\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 * 0.0099 + 0.5\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.00495 + 0.5\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.50495\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe if I put more black marbles in one box.\n\nSuppose I put 2 black marbles in one box and 98 black marbles in the other box, with the 100 white marbles in the second box.\n\nWait, no. If I put 2 black marbles in the box with white marbles, then box 1 would have 2 black and 100 white, and box 2 would have 98 black.\n\nThen, P(black) = 0.5 * (2 / 102) + 0.5 * (98 / 98)\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * (2/102) + 0.5 * 1\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * (1/51) + 0.5\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 * 0.0196 + 0.5\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.0098 + 0.5\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5098\n\nHmm, that's slightly higher than before. Maybe if I put even more black marbles in the box with white marbles.\n\nLet me try putting 50 black marbles in the box with white marbles, so box 1 has 50 black and 100 white, and box 2 has 50 black.\n\nThen, P(black) = 0.5 * (50 / 150) + 0.5 * (50 / 50)\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * (1/3) + 0.5 * 1\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * 0.3333 + 0.5\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.1667 + 0.5\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.6667 or about 66.67%\n\nThat's a significant improvement from 50%. So, by putting 50 black marbles in the box with white marbles and leaving 50 black marbles in the other box, the probability of drawing a black marble becomes about 66.67%.\n\nIs there a way to get an even higher probability? Let's try putting 99 black marbles in the box with white marbles and leaving 1 black marble in the other box.\n\nSo, box 1: 99 black and 100 white.\n\nBox 2: 1 black.\n\nThen, P(black) = 0.5 * (99 / 199) + 0.5 * (1 / 1)\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * (99/199) + 0.5 * 1\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 * 0.4975 + 0.5\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.24875 + 0.5\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.74875 or about 74.875%\n\nThat's even better. It's higher than the previous arrangement.\n\nLet me try putting 999 black marbles in the box with white marbles and 1 black marble in the other box. Wait, but we only have 100 black marbles. Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, we have only 100 black marbles and 100 white marbles. So, if I put 99 black marbles in the box with white marbles, box 1 would have 99 black and 100 white, and box 2 would have 1 black marble.\n\nIn this case, P(black) = 0.5 * (99 / 199) + 0.5 * (1 / 1)\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 * 0.4975 + 0.5 * 1\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.24875 + 0.5\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.74875 or 74.875%\n\nIs there a way to get closer to 100%? What if I put only one black marble in the box with white marbles and leave the rest in the other box.\n\nSo, box 1: 1 black and 100 white.\n\nBox 2: 99 black.\n\nThen, P(black) = 0.5 * (1 / 101) + 0.5 * (99 / 99)\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * (1/101) + 0.5 * 1\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 * 0.0099 + 0.5\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.00495 + 0.5\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.50495 or about 50.495%\n\nThat's lower than the previous arrangements. So, it seems that putting more black marbles in the box with white marbles initially increases the probability, but too many decreases it.\n\nWait, in the earlier case with 50 black marbles in the box with white marbles, we had about 66.67%, and with 99 black marbles, about 74.875%, and with 1 black marble, about 50.495%. So, it seems that as I increase the number of black marbles in the box with white marbles, the probability increases.\n\nBut let's try with all 100 black marbles in one box and all 100 white marbles in the other.\n\nSo, box 1: 100 black.\n\nBox 2: 100 white.\n\nThen, P(black) = 0.5 * (100 / 100) + 0.5 * (0 / 100)\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0\n\nP(black) = 0.5\n\nThat's the same as the initial setup.\n\nWait, but earlier when I put 99 black marbles with 100 white marbles, I got about 74.875%, which is higher than 50%. So, maybe the optimal distribution is to put almost all black marbles in the box with white marbles.\n\nBut let's think differently. What if I put just one black marble in one box and all the white marbles in the other box.\n\nSo, box 1: 1 black.\n\nBox 2: 99 black and 100 white.\n\nThen, P(black) = 0.5 * (1 / 1) + 0.5 * (99 / 199)\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (99/199)\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.4975\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 + 0.24875\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.74875 or about 74.875%\n\nThat's the same as before.\n\nWait, is there a way to get closer to 100%? Maybe if I put a single black marble in one box and all the white marbles in the other box.\n\nWait, but that's similar to the previous arrangement. Alternatively, what if I put a single black marble in one box and the rest of the black marbles and all the white marbles in the other box.\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider having one box with a higher concentration of black marbles and the other with a lower concentration.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to have one box with as high a probability as possible of drawing a black marble, and the other box with some black marbles to still have a chance.\n\nWait, maybe putting one black marble in one box and the rest of the black marbles and all the white marbles in the other box is the way to go.\n\nSo, box 1: 1 black.\n\nBox 2: 99 black and 100 white.\n\nThen, P(black) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (99 / 199)\n\nAs calculated before, that's about 74.875%.\n\nIs there a way to get higher than that? Maybe if I put two black marbles in one box and the rest in the other box.\n\nSo, box 1: 2 black.\n\nBox 2: 98 black and 100 white.\n\nThen, P(black) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (98 / 198)\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (49/99)\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.4949\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 + 0.24745\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.74745 or about 74.745%\n\nThat's slightly lower than before.\n\nSo, putting one black marble in one box and the rest in the other seems better than putting two.\n\nWhat about putting three black marbles in one box and 97 in the other with white marbles.\n\nBox 1: 3 black.\n\nBox 2: 97 black and 100 white.\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (97 / 197)\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.4923\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 + 0.24615\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.74615 or about 74.615%\n\nThat's even lower.\n\nSo, it seems that putting only one black marble in one box and the rest in the other with white marbles maximizes the probability.\n\nAlternatively, what if I put more black marbles in the box with white marbles?\n\nWait, earlier when I put 99 black marbles in the box with white marbles, I got about 74.875%, which is higher than putting one black marble alone.\n\nWait, but in that case, box 1 has 99 black and 100 white, and box 2 has 1 black.\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * (99 / 199) + 0.5 * 1\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 * 0.4975 + 0.5\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.24875 + 0.5\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.74875 or about 74.875%\n\nThat's the same as putting one black marble in a box and 99 in the other with white marbles.\n\nWait, but in terms of percentage, it's the same.\n\nSo, perhaps the arrangement doesn't matter as long as one box has a high probability and the other has some black marbles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way.\n\nLet me consider the extreme case where one box has just one black marble and the other box has all the remaining marbles.\n\nSo, box 1: 1 black.\n\nBox 2: 99 black and 100 white.\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (99 / 199)\n\nAs calculated before, that's about 74.875%.\n\nNow, what if I put two black marbles in one box and the rest in the other box.\n\nBox 1: 2 black.\n\nBox 2: 98 black and 100 white.\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (98 / 198)\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.4949\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 + 0.24745\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.74745 or about 74.745%\n\nThat's slightly lower.\n\nSimilarly, if I put three black marbles in one box:\n\nBox 1: 3 black.\n\nBox 2: 97 black and 100 white.\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (97 / 197)\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.4923\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 + 0.24615\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.74615 or about 74.615%\n\nAgain, lower than the previous arrangement.\n\nSo, it seems that putting only one black marble in one box and the rest in the other with white marbles maximizes the probability.\n\nAlternatively, what if I put more black marbles in the box with white marbles?\n\nWait, earlier with 99 black marbles in the box with white marbles, I got about 74.875%, which is the same as putting one black marble in a separate box.\n\nSo, perhaps that's the maximum probability achievable.\n\nBut let's think differently. What if I don't distribute the marbles equally between the boxes? For example, what if I put more marbles in one box and fewer in the other?\n\nWait, but we have to pick a box at random, so each box has a 50% chance of being selected.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can manipulate the probabilities by having one box with a very high probability of drawing a black marble and the other with a lower probability, but still higher than zero.\n\nWait, in the earlier arrangement, one box has a 100% chance of drawing a black marble (if it has only black marbles), and the other box has, say, 99 black and 100 white marbles, which is about 49.75% chance of drawing a black marble.\n\nThen, the total probability is the average of these two, which is about 74.875%, as calculated.\n\nIs there a way to skew this further?\n\nSuppose I put, say, two black marbles in one box and 98 black and 100 white in the other.\n\nThen, P(black) = 0.5 * (2 / 2) + 0.5 * (98 / 198)\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (49 / 99)\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.4949\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 + 0.24745\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.74745 or about 74.745%\n\nStill slightly lower than the previous arrangement.\n\nWhat if I put three black marbles in one box and 97 black and 100 white in the other.\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * (3 / 3) + 0.5 * (97 / 197)\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0.4923\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 + 0.24615\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.74615 or about 74.615%\n\nAgain, lower.\n\nSo, it seems that putting only one black marble in one box and the rest in the other with white marbles gives a slightly higher probability.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider putting a single black marble in one box and all the white marbles in that box, and all the remaining black marbles in the other box.\n\nWait, no, that would be box 1: 1 black and 100 white; box 2: 99 black.\n\nThen, P(black) = 0.5 * (1 / 101) + 0.5 * (99 / 99)\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 * 0.0099 + 0.5 * 1\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.00495 + 0.5\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.50495 or about 50.495%\n\nThat's lower than the previous arrangement.\n\nWait, earlier when I put one black marble in a separate box and the rest in the other box with white marbles, I got about 74.875%.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the arrangements.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Box 1: 1 black marble.\n\n- Box 2: 99 black and 100 white marbles.\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * (1 / 1) + 0.5 * (99 / 199)\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0.4975\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 + 0.24875\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.74875 or about 74.875%\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Box 1: 1 black and 100 white marbles.\n\n- Box 2: 99 black marbles.\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * (1 / 101) + 0.5 * (99 / 99)\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 * 0.0099 + 0.5 * 1\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.00495 + 0.5\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.50495 or about 50.495%\n\nSo, Option 1 is better than Option 2.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I put 50 black marbles in one box with white marbles and 50 black marbles in the other box, I got about 66.67%, which is lower than Option 1.\n\nSo, it seems that Option 1 is the best so far.\n\nIs there a way to get higher than 74.875%?\n\nLet me consider putting multiple black marbles in one box and the rest in the other box.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Box 1: 2 black marbles.\n\n- Box 2: 98 black and 100 white marbles.\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * (2 / 2) + 0.5 * (98 / 198)\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (49 / 99)\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.4949\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 + 0.24745\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.74745 or about 74.745%\n\nSlightly lower than Option 1.\n\nSimilarly, if I put 3 black marbles in one box:\n\n- Box 1: 3 black.\n\n- Box 2: 97 black and 100 white.\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (97 / 197)\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.4923\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 + 0.24615\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.74615 or about 74.615%\n\nAgain, lower than Option 1.\n\nWhat if I put 99 black marbles in one box and 1 black marble in the other with white marbles.\n\nWait, but we only have 100 black marbles in total.\n\nWait, no, we have 100 black and 100 white marbles.\n\nSo, if I put 99 black marbles in one box and 1 black marble in the other box with white marbles.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, if I put 99 black marbles in one box and the other box has 1 black and 100 white marbles.\n\nThen, P(black) = 0.5 * (99 / 99) + 0.5 * (1 / 101)\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (1 / 101)\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.0099\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.5 + 0.00495\n\nP(black) \u2248 0.50495 or about 50.495%\n\nThat's lower than Option 1.\n\nSo, it seems that Option 1 is still the best.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better strategy.\n\nWait, maybe if I don't put any white marbles in the box with some black marbles.\n\nFor example, box 1: 1 black marble.\n\nBox 2: 99 black marbles and 100 white marbles.\n\nWait, that's Option 1.\n\nAlternatively, box 1: 1 black marble.\n\nBox 2: 99 black marbles and 100 white marbles.\n\nWait, that's the same as Option 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider having one box with only black marbles and the other with a mix of black and white marbles.\n\nWait, that's what Option 1 is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider having one box with a single black marble and the other with all the remaining marbles.\n\nWait, that's Option 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to arrange the marbles differently.\n\nWait, perhaps if I have one box with a higher proportion of black marbles, even if it's not 100%.\n\nFor example, box 1: 50 black and 0 white.\n\nBox 2: 50 black and 100 white.\n\nThen, P(black) = 0.5 * (50 / 50) + 0.5 * (50 / 150)\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 *

black and 100 white.\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0\n\nP(black) = 0.5\n\nThat's worse.\n\nWhat if I have box 1: 99 black.\n\nBox 2: 1 black and 100 white.\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * (99 / 99) + 0.5 * (1 /

1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if I have one box with a single black marble and 99 white marbles, and the other box with 99 black marbles and 1 white marble.\n\nWait, that's different.\n\nSo, box 1: 1 black and 99 white.\n\nBox 2: 99 black and 1 white.\n\nThen, P(black) = 0.5 * (1 / 100) + 0.5 * (99 / 100)\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * 0.01 + 0.5 * 0.99\n\nP(black) = 0.005 + 0.495\n\nP(black) = 0.5 or 50%\n\nThat's worse than Option 1.\n\nAlternatively, what if I have box 1: 1 black and 1 white.\n\nBox 2: 99 black and 99 white.\n\nThen, P(black) = 0.5 * (1 / 2) + 0.5 * (99 / 198)\n\nP(black) = 0.5 * 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.5\n\nP(black) = 0.25 + 0.25\n\nP(black) = 0.5 or 50%\n\nAgain, worse than Option 1.\n\nSo, it seems that Option 1 is indeed the best.\n\nTherefore, to maximize the probability of drawing a black marble, I should put one black marble in one box and the remaining 99 black marbles and all 100 white marbles in the other box.\n\nIn this arrangement, the probability of drawing a black marble is approximately 74.875%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Place one black marble in one box and the remaining 99 black marbles and all 100 white marbles in the other box.}}\\]"
