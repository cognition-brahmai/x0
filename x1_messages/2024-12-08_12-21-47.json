Each tool execution will generate an evidence value, which is the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be either the user's question or previous evidence values.\n\nHere are the tools you can use:\nBing[input]: A search engine tool that allows users to find information from various websites across the internet.\nPageReader[input]: Loads a website from the input URL and produces plain text containing the content of the webpage.\nLinkCollector[input]: Extracts links from plain text and generates a list of URLs.\nTextAnalyzer[input]: Analyzes a passage of text and answers questions based on it. The input must be a question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nEach function takes a plain string as input without quotes or \"+\" for concatenation with an evidence variable (for example, TextAnalyzer[What is the capital of France, given :evidence2:?]).\n\nThe output should follow this format:\nPlan: [first action]\n:evidence0: = [function call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function call and input parameter, potentially referencing previous evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What are some notable works by the author who wrote \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"?"
