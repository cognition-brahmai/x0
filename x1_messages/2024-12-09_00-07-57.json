        "content": "So you've got this investment scenario here. A person puts away $5000 at an annual interest rate of 4%, and it's compounded quarterly. You want to know how much that investment will be worth after 3 years. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, understanding the terms is key. Compounded quarterly means that the interest is calculated and added to the principal four times a year, every three months. The annual interest rate is 4%, but since it's compounded quarterly, we need to adjust that rate to reflect the quarterly compounding.\n\nTo find the quarterly interest rate, we take the annual rate and divide it by the number of compounding periods in a year. So, 4% divided by 4 (since there are four quarters in a year) gives us a quarterly rate of 1%. In decimal form, that's 0.01.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many times the interest is compounded over the 3-year period. Since it's quarterly, and there are 4 quarters in a year, over 3 years that would be 3 times 4, which equals 12 compounding periods.\n\nNow, the formula for compound interest is:\n\nA = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for, in years.\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\nP = $5000\n\nr = 4% or 0.04\n\nn = 4 (since it's compounded quarterly)\n\nt = 3 years\n\nSo,\n\nA = 5000 * (1 + 0.04/4)^(4*3)\n\nLet's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the rate per period:\n\n0.04 / 4 = 0.01\n\nThen, add 1 to that rate:\n\n1 + 0.01 = 1.01\n\nNow, raise that to the power of the total number of periods, which is 12:\n\n1.01^12\n\nLet me calculate that. Using a calculator, 1.01 to the power of 12 is approximately 1.126825.\n\nFinally, multiply that by the principal amount:\n\n5000 * 1.126825 = 5634.125\n\nSo, after 3 years, the investment would be worth approximately $5634.13.\n\nBut let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with $5000 at 4% annual interest, compounded quarterly for 3 years.\n\nUsing the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nP = 5000\n\nr = 0.04\n\nn = 4\n\nt = 3\n\nA = 5000 * (1 + 0.04/4)^(4*3) = 5000 * (1 + 0.01)^12 = 5000 * (1.01)^12\n\nAs calculated earlier, (1.01)^12 \u2248 1.126825\n\nSo, 5000 * 1.126825 = 5634.125, which rounds to $5634.13\n\nAlternatively, you can think about it year by year, but that would be more time-consuming and prone to error, especially over multiple periods.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the compound interest formula directly, which is what we did.\n\nIt's also worth noting that if the interest was compounded annually, semi-annually, or monthly, the final amount would be different due to the different compounding frequencies.\n\nIn this case, since it's compounded quarterly, the interest is added every three months, allowing for more frequent compounding and thus a slightly higher final amount compared to annual compounding.\n\nSo, to summarize, after 3 years, the investment of $5000 at 4% annual interest compounded quarterly will be worth approximately $5634.13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5634.13} \\]"
