        "content": "The 1973 album by Pink Floyd that features a prism on its cover is called \"The Dark Side of the Moon.\" This iconic album is known for its explorations of themes like mortality, conflict, time, and mental illness, and it's often regarded as one of the greatest rock albums of all time. The prism on the cover symbolizes the dispersion of light into its constituent colors, which is a powerful metaphor for the band's exploration of complex human emotions and experiences."
