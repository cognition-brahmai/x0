Neutrinos do have a tiny bit of mass, as we now know. So, perhaps a better joke is: Why did the neutrino go to the dance? To find some mass! Okay, maybe neutrino jokes aren't my strong suit. How about something else in physics? Like, why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything! There you go, a classic!"
