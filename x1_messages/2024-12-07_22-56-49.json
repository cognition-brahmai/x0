        "content": "So I've got this problem here about drawing a flush in a game of cards. Let me see if I can figure this out. First off, I know that a standard deck has 52 cards, divided into 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 ranks, from Ace through 10, and then Jack, Queen, and King.\n\nNow, the question is about the probability of drawing a flush, which means getting 5 cards all from the same suit. Okay, so I need to find the chance of that happening.\n\nI remember that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to draw any 5 cards from the deck.\n\nTo find that, I should use combinations because the order doesn't matter in card hands. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of possible 5-card hands from a 52-card deck is C(52, 5). Let me calculate that.\n\n52! / (5!(52 - 5)!) = (52! / (5! * 47!)).\n\nI don't need to compute the full factorials; I can simplify it:\n\n52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48 / (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48) / 120.\n\nLet me calculate the numerator first:\n\n52 \u00d7 51 = 2,652\n\n2,652 \u00d7 50 = 132,600\n\n132,600 \u00d7 49 = 6,500,400\n\n6,500,400 \u00d7 48 = 312,019,200\n\nNow, divide that by 120:\n\n312,019,200 / 120 = 2,600,160.\n\nSo, there are 2,600,160 possible 5-card hands.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the hands that consist of 5 cards all from the same suit. Since there are 4 suits, I'll calculate the number of ways to draw 5 cards from one suit and then multiply by 4.\n\nLet's take one suit, say hearts. There are 13 hearts in the deck. The number of ways to choose 5 hearts from 13 is C(13, 5).\n\nC(13, 5) = 13! / (5!(13 - 5)!) = (13! / (5! * 8!)).\n\nAgain, simplifying:\n\n(13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9) / (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (154,440) / 120 = 1,287.\n\nSo, there are 1,287 ways to choose 5 hearts from 13.\n\nSince there are 4 suits, the total number of ways to get a flush is 4 \u00d7 1,287 = 5,148.\n\nWait a minute, but I think I should consider that a straight flush or a royal flush is also a flush, but in probability calculations for flushes, sometimes they are excluded. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.\n\nActually, in standard poker hand rankings, a straight flush and a royal flush are ranked higher than a flush. So, depending on the context, sometimes flushes are considered excluding straight flushes and royal flushes.\n\nBut in the general sense of just all cards being the same suit, regardless of their ranks, I think the 5,148 figure is correct. However, to be thorough, I should consider whether to subtract the straight flushes and royal flushes.\n\nLet me check: a straight flush is 5 consecutive cards of the same suit, and a royal flush is a specific type of straight flush (Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace).\n\nIf the problem is asking for any 5 cards of the same suit, then including straight flushes and royal flushes, the total is 5,148.\n\nBut if it's asking for flushes excluding straight flushes and royal flushes, then I need to subtract those.\n\nI'll assume that the problem means any 5 cards of the same suit, without excluding straight flushes and royal flushes, unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with 5,148 favorable hands.\n\nNow, the probability is favorable outcomes divided by total possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = 5,148 / 2,600,160.\n\nLet me simplify that fraction.\n\nFirst, divide numerator and denominator by 12:\n\n5,148 \u00f7 12 = 429\n\n2,600,160 \u00f7 12 = 216,680\n\nSo, 429 / 216,680.\n\nCan this be simplified further? Let's check.\n\nLet's see if 429 and 216,680 have any common factors.\n\n429 divided by 3 is 143.\n\n216,680 divided by 3 is 72,226.666, which is not an integer, so 3 is not a common factor.\n\n429 divided by 11 is 39.\n\n216,680 divided by 11 is approximately 19,698.181, not an integer.\n\n429 divided by 13 is approximately 33, which is an integer.\n\n216,680 divided by 13 is approximately 16,667.692, not an integer.\n\nSo, it seems 429 and 216,680 don't have any common factors other than 1.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 429 / 216,680.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal for better understanding.\n\n429 divided by 216,680 is approximately 0.002.\n\nTo get a more precise value, let's calculate it:\n\n216,680 \u00f7 429 \u2248 505.0816.\n\nSo, 1 / 505.0816 \u2248 0.00198.\n\nTherefore, the probability is approximately 0.002, or 0.198%, which is roughly 1 in 505.\n\nBut to be precise, let's keep it as 429 / 216,680.\n\nAlternatively, I can double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me verify the total number of possible 5-card hands from 52 cards.\n\nC(52, 5) = 2,598,960.\n\nWait a second, I had calculated it as 2,600,160 earlier, but actually, the correct value is 2,598,960.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nSo, C(52, 5) = 2,598,960.\n\nNow, the number of ways to get a flush is 4 \u00d7 C(13, 5) = 4 \u00d7 1,287 = 5,148.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 5,148 / 2,598,960.\n\nSimplify this fraction.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 12:\n\n5,148 \u00f7 12 = 429\n\n2,598,960 \u00f7 12 = 216,580\n\nSo, 429 / 216,580.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 216,680. There must have been a typo.\n\nCorrecting that, it's 2,598,960 \u00f7 12 = 216,580.\n\nSo, probability is 429 / 216,580.\n\nAs a decimal, that's approximately 0.00198.\n\nSo, roughly 0.198%, or about 1 in 505.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a flush from a standard deck is about 1 in 505.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{429}{216580}} \\]"
