        "content": "So I have this problem about a train's journey, and I need to find the average speed for the entire trip. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, the train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours. So, the distance covered in this part of the journey should be speed multiplied by time, right? That would be 60 mph times 3 hours, which equals 180 miles.\n\nNext, the train stops for an hour. During this stop, it doesn't cover any distance, so the speed is zero for that hour. But I need to consider this time in the total time of the journey.\n\nAfter the stop, the train continues traveling at a constant speed of 80 mph for another 2 hours. Again, distance equals speed times time, so that's 80 mph times 2 hours, which is 160 miles.\n\nNow, to find the average speed for the entire journey, I need to divide the total distance traveled by the total time taken, including the stop.\n\nTotal distance is the sum of the distances from both parts of the trip: 180 miles plus 160 miles, which equals 340 miles.\n\nTotal time is the sum of all the time segments: 3 hours traveling at 60 mph, plus 1 hour stop, plus 2 hours traveling at 80 mph, which adds up to 6 hours.\n\nSo, average speed is total distance divided by total time: 340 miles divided by 6 hours. Let me do that calculation: 340 divided by 6 is approximately 56.67 mph.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? The train was moving faster in the second part of the trip, but because of the stop, the average speed is lower than both speeds. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations. First part: 60 mph times 3 hours equals 180 miles. That seems right. Second part: 80 mph times 2 hours equals 160 miles. That also seems correct. Total distance: 180 plus 160 equals 340 miles. Total time: 3 hours plus 1 hour plus 2 hours equals 6 hours. So, 340 miles in 6 hours is indeed about 56.67 mph.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Maybe weight the speeds by the time spent at each speed.\n\nSo, for the first 3 hours, the speed is 60 mph, and for the next 2 hours, it's 80 mph, with a 1-hour stop in between. But since the stop is part of the journey, I think including it in the total time is the correct approach.\n\nAnother way to look at it: average speed is the harmonic mean of the speeds, weighted by the time spent at each speed. But in this case, because there's a stop, I think the straightforward total distance divided by total time is the way to go.\n\nLet me consider if there's another approach. Maybe using the formula for average speed when there are different speeds for different durations.\n\nI recall that average speed is total distance over total time, which is what I already did. Alternatively, if the distances were equal, there's a formula involving the harmonic mean, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the stop as part of the travel time. So, if the train is stopped, it's still part of the journey, and its speed during that time is zero.\n\nSo, in the first 3 hours: 180 miles at 60 mph.\n\nThen, 1 hour stopped: 0 miles.\n\nThen, 2 hours at 80 mph: 160 miles.\n\nTotal distance: 180 + 0 + 160 = 340 miles.\n\nTotal time: 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 hours.\n\nAverage speed: 340 miles / 6 hours = 56.666... mph.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the weighted average of the speeds, with the weights being the time spent at each speed.\n\nSo, the average speed would be (60 mph * 3 hours + 0 mph * 1 hour + 80 mph * 2 hours) divided by total time of 6 hours.\n\nCalculating that: (180 + 0 + 160) / 6 = 340 / 6 \u2248 56.67 mph.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which reinforces that 56.67 mph is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there anything else that affects the average speed in this scenario?\n\nThe problem states that the train travels at a constant speed for each segment and stops for an hour. So, no acceleration or deceleration periods are mentioned, which means I don't need to account for any changes in speed beyond the constant speeds and the stop.\n\nTherefore, I believe that 56.67 mph is the correct average speed for the entire journey.\n\nWait, maybe I should express it as a fraction to be more precise. 340 divided by 6 is 170/3, which is approximately 56.666... mph. So, possibly better to write it as 170/3 mph or about 56.67 mph.\n\nAlternatively, in mixed numbers, that would be 56 and 2/3 mph.\n\nBut since the problem gives speeds in whole numbers, perhaps I should round it to two decimal places, making it 56.67 mph.\n\nHowever, in formal answers, it's often acceptable to leave it as a fraction, so 170/3 mph might be preferred.\n\nBut to confirm, let me see if the problem specifies any particular format for the answer.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the average speed of the entire journey?\"\n\nIt doesn't specify the format, so both the decimal and fractional forms are acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps the examiner expects the answer in miles per hour with decimal places.\n\nIn any case, I'm confident that the calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the average speed of the entire journey is approximately 56.67 miles per hour, or more precisely, 170/3 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{170}{3} \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]"
