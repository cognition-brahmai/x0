        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular method for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, especially when dealing with weighted edges. In this case, since the graph is directed and weighted, Dijkstra's algorithm is a perfect fit.\n\nTo implement this in Scala, we'll need to represent the graph in a way that allows us to efficiently access the neighbors of each node along with their edge weights. A common approach is to use an adjacency list, where each node points to a list of its neighboring nodes and the corresponding edge weights.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan for implementing Dijkstra's algorithm in Scala:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: Use a map where keys are nodes, and values are lists of tuples representing neighboring nodes and edge weights.\n\n2. **Priority Queue**: Use a priority queue to always expand the node with the smallest current distance.\n\n3. **Distance Tracking**: Keep track of the shortest known distance to each node from the start node.\n\n4. **Visited Set**: Keep track of nodes that have already been visited to avoid revisiting them.\n\n5. **Path Reconstruction**: Keep track of the previous node for each node to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\nLet's dive into the code. First, we need to define our graph representation.\n\n### Graph Representation\n\nWe'll represent the graph using a `Map[Int, List[(Int, Int)]]`, where:\n\n- Keys are node identifiers (Integers).\n\n- Values are lists of tuples, each containing a neighboring node and the weight of the edge to that neighbor.\n\n### Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation\n\nNow, let's implement Dijkstra's algorithm. We'll use a priority queue to always process the node with the smallest distance first. For the priority queue, we'll use `scala.collection.mutable.PriorityQueue` with a custom ordering to make it a min-heap.\n\n### Full Code\n\n```scala\nimport scala.collection.mutable\n\ndef dijkstra(graph: Map[Int, List[(Int, Int)]], start: Int, end: Int): (Option[Int], Option[List[Int]]) = {\n    // Initialize distances with infinity except for the start node\n    val distances = mutable.Map[Int, Int]()\n    graph.keys.foreach(node => distances(node) = Int.MaxValue)\n    distances(start) = 0\n\n    // Priority queue to hold nodes to visit, with their current distance\n    val queue = mutable.PriorityQueue[(Int, Int)]()(Ordering.by(_._2).reverse)\n    queue.enqueue((start, 0))\n\n    // Map to keep track of the previous node in the path\n    val previous = mutable.Map[Int, Option[Int]]()\n    graph.keys.foreach(node => previous(node) = None)\n\n    while (queue.nonEmpty) {\n        val (current, dist) = queue.dequeue()\n\n        // If we've found the end node, reconstruct the path and return\n        if (current == end) {\n            val path = reconstructPath(previous, end)\n            return (Some(dist), path)\n        }\n\n        // Skip if a shorter path has already been found\n        if (dist > distances(current)) continue\n\n        // Explore each neighbor\n        for ((neighbor, weight) <- graph.getOrElse(current, List.empty)) {\n            val newDist = dist + weight\n            if (newDist < distances(neighbor)) {\n                distances(neighbor) = newDist\n                previous(neighbor) = Some(current)\n                queue.enqueue((neighbor, newDist))\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // If end is not reachable\n    (None, None)\n}\n\ndef reconstructPath(prev: mutable.Map[Int, Option[Int]], end: Int): Option[List[Int]] = {\n    var path = List[Int](end)\n    var current = prev(end)\n    while (current.isDefined) {\n        path = current.get :: path\n        current = prev(current.get)\n    }\n    Some(path)\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nval graph = Map(\n    1 -> List((2, 7), (3, 9), (6, 14)),\n    2 -> List((1, 7), (3, 10), (4, 15)),\n    3 -> List((1, 9), (2, 10), (4, 11), (6, 2)),\n    4 -> List((2, 15), (3, 11), (5, 6)),\n    5 -> List((4, 6), (6, 9)),\n    6 -> List((1, 14), (3, 2), (5, 9))\n)\n\nval (distance, path) = dijkstra(graph, 1, 5)\nprintln(s\"Shortest distance: ${distance.getOrElse(\"None\")}\")\nprintln(s\"Shortest path: ${path.getOrElse(\"None\")}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Set all distances to infinity except the start node, which is set to 0.\n   - Use a priority queue to keep track of nodes to visit, ordered by their current known distance from the start.\n\n2. **Processing**:\n   - Dequeue the node with the smallest distance.\n   - If it's the end node, reconstruct and return the path.\n   - For each neighbor, calculate the new distance. If it's smaller than the current known distance, update the distance and the previous node, and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n3. **Path Reconstruction**:\n   - Start from the end node and follow the `previous` map back to the start node, constructing the path.\n\nThis implementation ensures that we efficiently find the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm in a weighted, directed graph."
