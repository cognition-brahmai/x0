        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. To create a Java application that interacts with a RESTful API to fetch weather data, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Choose a Weather API**: There are several weather APIs available, such as OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack, and AccuWeather. For this example, I'll use OpenWeatherMap because it's widely used and has a free tier.\n\n2. **Sign Up for an API Key**: Visit the OpenWeatherMap website, sign up for an account, and obtain an API key.\n\n3. **Set Up Your Java Project**: You can use any IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or even a simple text editor. Make sure you have Java installed on your machine.\n\n4. **Add Necessary Dependencies**: You'll need a library to make HTTP requests. One popular choice is `Unirest`, which simplifies HTTP operations.\n\n5. **Write the Code**: Create a Java class that takes a city name as input, constructs the API URL, makes the HTTP request, and parses the JSON response to extract the required weather data.\n\n6. **Run the Application**: Compile and run your Java application to see the weather data for the specified city.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n### Step 1: Choose a Weather API\n\nI've chosen OpenWeatherMap for this example. It provides current weather data, forecasts, and more.\n\n### Step 2: Sign Up for an API Key\n\n- Visit [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).\n- Sign up for a free account.\n- Once logged in, go to the API keys section to generate a new API key.\n\n### Step 3: Set Up Your Java Project\n\nYou can create a new Java project in your preferred IDE. For this example, I'll assume you're using a simple Java class.\n\n### Step 4: Add Necessary Dependencies\n\nTo make HTTP requests easily, we'll use Unirest. You'll need to add the Unirest dependency to your project.\n\nIf you're using Maven, add the following to your `pom.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>com.mashape.unirest</groupId>\n    <artifactId>unirest-java</artifactId>\n    <version>1.4.9</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nIf you're not using Maven, download the Unirest JAR and add it to your project's classpath.\n\n### Step 5: Write the Code\n\nCreate a Java class, say `WeatherApp`, and write the following code:\n\n```java\nimport com.mashape.unirest.http.Unirest;\nimport com.mashape.unirest.http.exceptions.UnirestException;\n\nimport org.json.JSONObject;\n\npublic class WeatherApp {\n\n    private static final String API_KEY = \"YOUR_API_KEY\";\n    private static final String URL = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=%s&appid=%s&units=metric\";\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        if (args.length == 0) {\n            System.out.println(\"Please provide a city name.\");\n            return;\n        }\n\n        String city = args[0];\n        String requestUrl = String.format(URL, city, API_KEY);\n\n        try {\n            String response = Unirest.get(requestUrl).asString().getBody();\n            JSONObject json = new JSONObject(response);\n\n            if (json.has(\"main\")) {\n                double temp = json.getJSONObject(\"main\").getDouble(\"temp\");\n                int humidity = json.getJSONObject(\"main\").getInt(\"humidity\");\n                String description = json.getJSONArray(\"weather\").getJSONObject(0).getString(\"description\");\n\n                System.out.println(\"Temperature: \" + temp + \"\u00b0C\");\n                System.out.println(\"Humidity: \" + humidity + \"%\");\n                System.out.println(\"Weather Description: \" + description);\n            } else {\n                System.out.println(\"City not found.\");\n            }\n        } catch (UnirestException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **API Key and URL**: Replace `\"YOUR_API_KEY\"` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key. The URL is formatted to include the city name and API key.\n\n2. **Input Handling**: The city name is taken from the command-line arguments.\n\n3. **HTTP Request**: Unirest is used to make a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API.\n\n4. **JSON Parsing**: The response is parsed as a JSON object to extract the temperature, humidity, and weather description.\n\n5. **Output**: The extracted data is printed to the console.\n\n### Step 6: Run the Application\n\nCompile and run your Java application from the command line or within your IDE.\n\nExample command:\n\n```sh\njava WeatherApp \"London\"\n```\n\nThis should display the current temperature, humidity, and weather description for London.\n\nThat's it! You've created a simple Java application that fetches and displays weather data using a RESTful API. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask."
