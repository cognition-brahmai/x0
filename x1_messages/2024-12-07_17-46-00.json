        "content": "In solid-state physics, the primary function of a semiconductor is to conduct electricity under certain conditions. Semiconductors are materials that have electrical conductivity between that of a conductor and an insulator. They are essential components in various electronic devices due to their unique properties.\n\nOption D is the correct answer because semiconductors do not conduct electricity under all conditions like conductors do, nor do they insulate against electricity like insulators. Instead, their conductivity can be precisely controlled by introducing impurities (doping), applying heat, or exposing them to light.\n\nTo elaborate, semiconductors have a band structure that includes a valence band and a conduction band, separated by a bandgap. At absolute zero temperature, the valence band is fully occupied by electrons, and the conduction band is empty. As temperature increases or when energy is applied (e.g., through electric fields or light), electrons can jump from the valence band to the conduction band, enabling conductivity.\n\nSemiconductors are the building blocks of modern electronics, used in transistors, diodes, solar cells, and integrated circuits, among other devices. Their ability to conduct electricity under specific conditions makes them incredibly versatile and indispensable in technology.\n\n**References:**\n\n1. Ashcroft, N. W., & Mermin, N. D.
