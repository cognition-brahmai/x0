        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a shop sells chocolates in boxes of 12, 18, and 24 pieces. I need to find the smallest number of chocolates I could buy if I want to have the same number of chocolates from each type of box. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it's asking. I want to buy some boxes of each size\u201412-piece, 18-piece, and 24-piece\u2014and I want the total number of chocolates from each type of box to be the same. So, for example, if I buy a certain number of 12-piece boxes, a certain number of 18-piece boxes, and a certain number of 24-piece boxes, the total chocolates from each type should be equal.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me rephrase it. Suppose I buy 'a' boxes of 12, 'b' boxes of 18, and 'c' boxes of 24. Then, the total chocolates from 12-piece boxes would be 12a, from 18-piece boxes would be 18b, and from 24-piece boxes would be 24c. The problem wants these totals to be equal, so 12a = 18b = 24c, and I need to find the smallest total number of chocolates, which would be 12a + 18b + 24c.\n\nBut hold on, if 12a = 18b = 24c, then each of these products is equal to some common value, say, k. So, k is a multiple of 12, 18, and 24. Therefore, k must be the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers for the smallest possible total.\n\nLet me confirm that. If k is the LCM of 12, 18, and 24, then it's the smallest number that's a multiple of each of them. So, 12a = k, 18b = k, and 24c = k. Therefore, a = k/12, b = k/18, and c = k/24. Since a, b, and c need to be integers (you can't buy a fraction of a box), k must be a multiple of each of these numbers, which is exactly what LCM ensures.\n\nSo, the smallest k is LCM of 12, 18, and 24. Once I have k, the total number of chocolates would be 3k, because there are three types of boxes, and each type contributes k chocolates.\n\nWait, is that right? Let's see: if 12a = k, 18b = k, and 24c = k, then the total chocolates are 12a + 18b + 24c = k + k + k = 3k. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, first step is to find the LCM of 12, 18, and 24.\n\nTo find LCM, I can factor each number into its prime factors:\n\n- 12 = 2^2 * 3\n\n- 18 = 2 * 3^2\n\n- 24 = 2^3 * 3\n\nThe LCM is the highest power of each prime present in the factorizations. So, for prime 2, the highest power is 2^3 from 24. For prime 3, the highest power is 3^2 from 18. Therefore, LCM = 2^3 * 3^2 = 8 * 9 = 72.\n\nSo, k = 72.\n\nTherefore, the smallest total number of chocolates is 3k = 3 * 72 = 216.\n\nBut let's double-check this to make sure.\n\nIf k = 72:\n\n- Number of 12-piece boxes: a = k / 12 = 72 / 12 = 6 boxes\n\n- Number of 18-piece boxes: b = k / 18 = 72 / 18 = 4 boxes\n\n- Number of 24-piece boxes: c = k / 24 = 72 / 24 = 3 boxes\n\nTotal chocolates: 12*6 + 18*4 + 24*3 = 72 + 72 + 72 = 216.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nIs there a smaller total possible? Let's see. If I tried a k smaller than 72 that's a multiple of 12, 18, and 24, but 72 is the LCM, so there isn't a smaller number that's a multiple of all three.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider buying different numbers of boxes but still achieving the same total from each type.\n\nFor example, suppose I buy 3 boxes of 12, 2 boxes of 18, and 1 box of 24.\n\nThen, total from 12-piece boxes: 3*12 = 36\n\nTotal from 18-piece boxes: 2*18 = 36\n\nTotal from 24-piece boxes: 1*24 = 24\n\nOh, wait, the totals from each type aren't equal in this case. The 12 and 18 give 36 each, but 24 gives only 24. So that doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nAnother attempt: buy 2 boxes of 12, 4 boxes of 18, and 3 boxes of 24.\n\nTotals:\n\n- 12*2 = 24\n\n- 18*4 = 72\n\n- 24*3 = 72\n\nAgain, not equal from each type.\n\nWait, the condition is that the total from each type is equal, not that the totals are equal across types. So, in the first attempt, all totals were 72, which is correct.\n\nI think my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to have smaller totals by buying fractions of boxes, but the problem says to buy whole boxes, so that's not possible.\n\nTherefore, the smallest total number of chocolates is 216.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{216} \\]"
