The construction budget is $10 million, and the cost breakdown is as follows: 40% for the soccer field, 30% for the basketball courts, and 20% for the swimming pool. The remaining 10% of the budget will be allocated for landscaping and parking lots. Calculate the individual budgets for each facility and determine how many square feet can be covered by each budget if the average construction cost per square foot is $200."

        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to calculate the individual budgets for each facility based on the percentages given. The total construction budget is $10 million.\n\n1. **Soccer Field:**\n   - Percentage of budget: 40%\n   - Budget: 40% of $10,000,000\n   - Calculation: 0.40 * 10,000,000 = $4,000,000\n\n2. **Basketball Courts:**\n   - Percentage of budget: 30%\n   - Budget: 30% of $10,000,000\n   - Calculation: 0.30 * 10,000,000 = $3,000,000\n\n3. **Swimming Pool:**\n   - Percentage of budget: 20%\n   - Budget: 20% of $10,000,000\n   - Calculation: 0.20 * 10,000,000 = $2,000,000\n\n4. **Landscaping and Parking Lots:**\n   - Percentage of budget: 10%\n   - Budget: 10% of $10,000,000\n   - Calculation: 0.10 * 10,000,000 = $1,000,000\n\nNow that we have the individual budgets, we need to determine how many square feet each facility can cover, given that the average construction cost per square foot is $200.\n\nTo find the square footage each budget can cover, we'll use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Square Footage} = \\frac{\\text{Budget}}{\\text{Cost per Square Foot}}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this for each facility.\n\n1. **Soccer Field:**\n   - Budget: $4,000,000\n   - Cost per Square Foot: $200\n   - Square Footage: \\(\\frac{4,000,000}{200} = 20,000\\) square feet\n\n2. **Basketball Courts:**\n   - Budget: $3,000,000\n   - Cost per Square Foot: $200\n   - Square Footage: \\(\\frac{3,000,000}{200} = 15,000\\) square feet\n\n3. **Swimming Pool:**\n   - Budget: $2,000,000\n   - Cost per Square Foot: $200\n   - Square Footage: \\(\\frac{2,000,000}{200} = 10,000\\) square feet\n\n4. **Landscaping and Parking Lots:**\n   - Budget: $1,000,000\n   - Cost per Square Foot: $200\n   - Square Footage: \\(\\frac{1,000,000}{200} = 5,000\\) square feet\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Soccer Field: $4,000,000 budget for 20,000 square feet\n- Basketball Courts: $3,000,000 budget for 15,000 square feet\n- Swimming Pool: $2,000,000 budget for 10,000 square feet\n- Landscaping and Parking Lots: $1,000,000 budget for 5,000 square feet\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text{Soccer Field:} & 20,000 \\text{ square feet} \\\\\n\\text{Basketball Courts:} & 15,000 \\text{ square feet} \\\\\n\\text{Swimming Pool:} & 10,000 \\text{ square feet} \\\\\n\\text{Landscaping and Parking Lots:} & 5,000 \\text{ square feet} \\\\\n\\end{array} } \\]"
