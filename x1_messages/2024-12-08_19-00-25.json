        "content": "So there are 7 people in this secret club, and each one knows a unique secret that no one else does. They want to share these secrets with each other using only letters. The goal is for everyone to know every secret. I need to figure out how many letters are needed for this to happen.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the starting point. Each of the 7 people has one unique secret. So, person A knows secret A, person B knows secret B, and so on up to person G knowing secret G. No one knows any other secrets besides their own.\n\nThey can only share secrets by writing letters to each other. When someone writes a letter, they can include any secrets they know in that letter. The recipient of the letter will then learn any new secrets that are in the letter.\n\nThe challenge is to minimize the number of letters sent while ensuring that everyone ends up knowing all seven secrets.\n\nOne way to approach this is to think about how information spreads through a network where communication is unidirectional (since letters are one-way communication).\n\nI recall that in information theory and graph theory, similar problems are studied to find efficient ways to disseminate information.\n\nLet me consider a central hub approach. Suppose one person collects all the secrets and then shares them with everyone else.\n\nFor example, person A could write to everyone else, but initially, person A only knows secret A. So, person A can't share all the secrets in one go.\n\nTherefore, person A would need to first get secrets from others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps multiple people can share their secrets iteratively.\n\nLet me try to model this step by step.\n\nStep 1: Initial state\n\n- A knows A\n\n- B knows B\n\n- C knows C\n\n- D knows D\n\n- E knows E\n\n- F knows F\n\n- G knows G\n\nStep 2: People start sharing their secrets.\n\nSuppose A writes to B, sharing secret A.\n\nNow, B knows B and A.\n\nSimilarly, C writes to D, sharing secret C.\n\nNow, D knows D and C.\n\nSimilarly, E writes to F, sharing secret E.\n\nNow, F knows F and E.\n\nG can write to A, sharing secret G.\n\nNow, A knows A and G.\n\nAt this point:\n\n- A knows A, G\n\n- B knows B, A\n\n- C knows C\n\n- D knows D, C\n\n- E knows E\n\n- F knows F, E\n\n- G knows G\n\nNot much progress yet.\n\nMaybe I need a different strategy.\n\nPerhaps one person can collect all the secrets and then disseminate them to everyone.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nStep 1: Everyone writes their secret to a central person, say A.\n\n- B writes B to A\n\n- C writes C to A\n\n- D writes D to A\n\n- E writes E to A\n\n- F writes F to A\n\n- G writes G to A\n\nNow, A knows A, B, C, D, E, F, G.\n\nStep 2: A writes to everyone else, sharing all the secrets.\n\n- A writes to B: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\n- A writes to C: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\n- A writes to D: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\n- A writes to E: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\n- A writes to F: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\n- A writes to G: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\nNow, everyone knows all the secrets.\n\nIn this approach, there are 6 letters sent to A in step 1, and then 6 letters sent from A in step 2, for a total of 12 letters.\n\nIs there a way to do it with fewer letters?\n\nLet me think about another method.\n\nMaybe using multiple rounds of communication.\n\nIn round 1:\n\n- A writes to B: A\n\n- C writes to D: C\n\n- E writes to F: E\n\n- G writes to A: G\n\nNow:\n\n- B knows A, B\n\n- D knows C, D\n\n- F knows E, F\n\n- A knows A, G\n\nIn round 2:\n\n- B writes to C: A, B\n\n- D writes to E: C, D\n\n- F writes to G: E, F\n\n- A writes to B: A, G\n\nAfter round 2:\n\n- C knows C, D, A, B (from B)\n\n- E knows E, F, C, D (from D)\n\n- G knows E, F, A, G (from F and A)\n\n- B knows A, B, A, G (no new info)\n\nWait, this seems inefficient.\n\nPerhaps I need to use a tree-like structure.\n\nLet me consider a binary tree where secrets are shared upwards.\n\nFor example:\n\n- B writes to A: B\n\n- C writes to A: C\n\n- D writes to E: D\n\n- F writes to E: F\n\n- G writes to E: G\n\nNow:\n\n- A knows A, B, C\n\n- E knows E, D, F, G\n\nIn the next round:\n\n- A writes to E: A, B, C\n\n- E writes to A: E, D, F, G\n\nNow, both A and E know all secrets.\n\nThen, A can write to B, C: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\nAnd E can write to D, F, G: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\nTotal letters:\n\n- B to A: 1\n\n- C to A: 1\n\n- D to E: 1\n\n- F to E: 1\n\n- G to E: 1\n\n- A to E: 1\n\n- E to A: 1\n\n- A to B: 1\n\n- A to C: 1\n\n- E to D: 1\n\n- E to F: 1\n\n- E to G: 1\n\nThat's 12 letters again.\n\nSame as the previous approach.\n\nIs there a better way?\n\nLet me consider that each letter can carry multiple secrets.\n\nBut in the initial setup, each person only knows one secret.\n\nSo, in the first letters, they can only share their own secret.\n\nOnly after receiving letters can they share additional secrets.\n\nPerhaps using a more interconnected network can reduce the number of letters.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the concept of gossip algorithms.\n\nIn gossip algorithms, each person exchanges all the secrets they know with another person in each round.\n\nIn each round, pairs of people are formed, and they exchange secrets.\n\nLet's see how that works.\n\nAssuming that in each round, pairs are formed, and each pair exchanges secrets.\n\nRound 1:\n\n- A and B exchange: A knows A,B; B knows A,B\n\n- C and D exchange: C knows C,D; D knows C,D\n\n- E and F exchange: E knows E,F; F knows E,F\n\n- G doesn't have anyone to exchange with, so G remains with G\n\nAfter round 1:\n\n- A knows A,B\n\n- B knows A,B\n\n- C knows C,D\n\n- D knows C,D\n\n- E knows E,F\n\n- F knows E,F\n\n- G knows G\n\nRound 2:\n\n- A and C exchange: A knows A,B,C,D; C knows A,B,C,D\n\n- B and D exchange: B knows A,B,C,D; D knows A,B,C,D\n\n- E and G exchange: E knows E,F,G; G knows E,F,G\n\n- F doesn't have anyone to exchange with, so F remains with E,F\n\nAfter round 2:\n\n- A knows A,B,C,D\n\n- B knows A,B,C,D\n\n- C knows A,B,C,D\n\n- D knows A,B,C,D\n\n- E knows E,F,G\n\n- F knows E,F\n\n- G knows E,F,G\n\nRound 3:\n\n- A and E exchange: A knows A,B,C,D,E,F,G; E knows A,B,C,D,E,F,G\n\n- B and F exchange: B knows A,B,C,D,E,F; F knows A,B,C,D,E,F\n\n- C and G exchange: C knows A,B,C,D,E,F,G; G knows A,B,C,D,E,F,G\n\n- D doesn't have anyone to exchange with, so D remains with A,B,C,D\n\nAfter round 3:\n\n- A knows A,B,C,D,E,F,G\n\n- B knows A,B,C,D,E,F\n\n- C knows A,B,C,D,E,F,G\n\n- D knows A,B,C,D\n\n- E knows A,B,C,D,E,F,G\n\n- F knows A,B,C,D,E,F\n\n- G knows A,B,C,D,E,F,G\n\nRound 4:\n\n- B and D exchange: B knows A,B,C,D,E,F; D knows A,B,C,D,E,F\n\n- F and D exchange: F knows A,B,C,D,E,F; D knows A,B,C,D,E,F\n\nAfter round 4:\n\n- B knows A,B,C,D,E,F\n\n- D knows A,B,C,D,E,F\n\n- F knows A,B,C,D,E,F\n\nEveryone now knows all secrets except B and F are missing G.\n\nWait, but G is already known by A, C, E, G.\n\nSo, perhaps one more exchange between someone who knows G and B or F.\n\nRound 5:\n\n- A writes to B: A,B,C,D,E,F,G\n\n- C writes to F: A,B,C,D,E,F,G\n\nNow, B and F know all secrets.\n\nTotal letters:\n\n- Round 1: 3 exchanges (6 letters)\n\n- Round 2: 3 exchanges (6 letters)\n\n- Round 3: 3 exchanges (6 letters)\n\n- Round 4: 2 exchanges (4 letters)\n\n- Round 5: 2 letters\n\nTotal: 6 + 6 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 24 letters\n\nWait, that seems worse than the previous approaches.\n\nMaybe I'm missing a more efficient way.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose we use a spanning tree approach.\n\nSelect one person as the root.\n\nOthers form a tree structure.\n\nFirst, everyone sends their secret to the root.\n\nThen, the root sends all secrets back to everyone.\n\nFor example, choose A as the root.\n\nStep 1: Everyone sends their secret to A.\n\n- B writes to A: B\n\n- C writes to A: C\n\n- D writes to A: D\n\n- E writes to A: E\n\n- F writes to A: F\n\n- G writes to A: G\n\nNow, A knows A, B, C, D, E, F, G.\n\nStep 2: A writes to everyone else, sharing all secrets.\n\n- A writes to B: A,B,C,D,E,F,G\n\n- A writes to C: A,B,C,D,E,F,G\n\n- A writes to D: A,B,C,D,E,F,G\n\n- A writes to E: A,B,C,D,E,F,G\n\n- A writes to F: A,B,C,D,E,F,G\n\n- A writes to G: A,B,C,D,E,F,G\n\nTotal letters: 6 (incoming) + 6 (outgoing) = 12 letters.\n\nIs this the minimum?\n\nIs there a way to do it with fewer than 12 letters?\n\nLet me consider that each letter can only carry one secret.\n\nWait, but in reality, a letter can carry multiple secrets.\n\nIn my previous approaches, I assumed that letters can carry multiple secrets.\n\nBut perhaps the problem intends that each letter can only carry one secret.\n\nIf that's the case, then the number of letters would be higher.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any limitation on the number of secrets per letter, so I think letters can carry multiple secrets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants each letter to carry only one secret.\n\nI need to clarify that.\n\nAssuming letters can carry multiple secrets, is there a way to reduce the number of letters below 12?\n\nLet me consider a different approach using multiple levels of sharing.\n\nSuppose we divide the group into smaller groups and have them share secrets incrementally.\n\nFor example:\n\nStep 1:\n\n- A writes to B: A\n\n- C writes to D: C\n\n- E writes to F: E\n\n- G writes to A: G\n\nNow:\n\n- B knows A, B\n\n- D knows C, D\n\n- F knows E, F\n\n- A knows A, G\n\nStep 2:\n\n- B writes to C: A, B\n\n- D writes to E: C, D\n\n- F writes to G: E, F\n\n- A writes to B: A, G\n\nNow:\n\n- C knows C, D, A, B\n\n- E knows E, F, C, D\n\n- G knows E, F, A, G\n\n- B knows A, B, A, G (no new info)\n\nStep 3:\n\n- C writes to D: A, B, C, D\n\n- E writes to F: C, D, E, F\n\n- G writes to A: A, G, E, F\n\n- B writes to C: A, B\n\nNow:\n\n- D knows A, B, C, D\n\n- F knows C, D, E, F\n\n- A knows A, G, E, F\n\n- C knows A, B, C, D\n\nStep 4:\n\n- D writes to E: A, B, C, D\n\n- F writes to G: C, D, E, F\n\n- A writes to B: A, G, E, F\n\n- C writes to D: A, B, C, D\n\nNow:\n\n- E knows A, B, C, D, E, F\n\n- G knows C, D, E, F, A, G\n\n- B knows A, B, A, G, E, F\n\n- D knows A, B, C, D\n\nStep 5:\n\n- E writes to F: A, B, C, D, E, F\n\n- G writes to A: A, G, E, F, C, D\n\n- B writes to C: A, B, A, G, E, F\n\n- D writes to E: A, B, C, D\n\nNow, everyone knows all secrets.\n\nBut this approach also seems to require many letters.\n\nIt doesn't seem better than the initial approach of 12 letters.\n\nPerhaps 12 is indeed the minimum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more efficient way using a flooding approach.\n\nIn flooding, each person, once they learn new secrets, shares all known secrets with others.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStart with each person knowing their own secret.\n\nRound 1:\n\n- A writes to B: A\n\n- C writes to D: C\n\n- E writes to F: E\n\n- G writes to A: G\n\nNow:\n\n- B knows A, B\n\n- D knows C, D\n\n- F knows E, F\n\n- A knows A, G\n\nRound 2:\n\n- A writes to B: A, G\n\n- B writes to C: A, B, G\n\n- C writes to D: A, B, C, D, G\n\n- D writes to E: A, B, C, D, E, G\n\n- E writes to F: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\n- F writes to G: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\n- G writes to A: A, G, E, F\n\nNow, everyone knows all secrets.\n\nLetters sent:\n\n- Round 1: 4 letters\n\n- Round 2: 7 letters\n\nTotal: 11 letters\n\nHmm, that's better than 12.\n\nIs there a way to reduce it further?\n\nLet me see.\n\nIn this approach, some letters might be overlapping.\n\nFor example, G writes to A in round 2: A, G, E, F\n\nBut A already knows A and G, and soon will know E and F from other letters.\n\nMaybe some letters can be omitted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a more optimized flooding approach can be used.\n\nBut 11 letters is still quite close to 12.\n\nIs there a way to get it down to 10 or less?\n\nI'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach of 12 letters is indeed the most efficient.\n\nLet me consider the general case.\n\nIn general, for n people each knowing a unique secret, the minimum number of letters required for everyone to know all secrets is 2(n - 1).\n\nIn this case, n = 7, so 2(7 - 1) = 12 letters.\n\nThis seems to align with my earlier approach.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of letters needed is 12.\n\nWait, but in my flooding approach, I got 11 letters.\n\nIs there a mistake in that approach?\n\nLet me recount.\n\nFlooding approach:\n\nRound 1:\n\n- A to B: A (now B knows A, B)\n\n- C to D: C (now D knows C, D)\n\n- E to F: E (now F knows E, F)\n\n- G to A: G (now A knows A, G)\n\nTotal: 4 letters\n\nRound 2:\n\n- A to B: A, G (now B knows A, B, G)\n\n- B to C: A, B, G (now C knows C, D, A, B, G)\n\n- C to D: A, B, C, D, G (now D knows A, B, C, D, E, G)\n\n- D to E: A, B, C, D, E, G (now E knows E, F, A, B, C, D, G)\n\n- E to F: A, B, C, D, E, F, G (now F knows A, B, C, D, E, F, G)\n\n- F to G: A, B, C, D, E, F, G (now G knows A, B, C, D, E, F, G)\n\n- G to A: A, G, E, F (but A already knows A, G, E, F from previous letters)\n\nTotal: 7 letters in round 2\n\nTotal letters: 4 + 7 = 11 letters\n\nWait, but in this approach, is it possible that some letters are redundant?\n\nFor example, G to A in round 2 might be unnecessary because A already knows A, G, and will soon know E and F from other letters.\n\nIf I omit that letter, total letters become 10.\n\nLet me check if that works.\n\nAdjusted flooding approach:\n\nRound 1:\n\n- A to B: A\n\n- C to D: C\n\n- E to F: E\n\n- G to A: G\n\nNow:\n\n- B knows A, B\n\n- D knows C, D\n\n- F knows E, F\n\n- A knows A, G\n\nRound 2:\n\n- A to B: A, G\n\n- B to C: A, B, G\n\n- C to D: A, B, C, D, G\n\n- D to E: A, B, C, D, E, G\n\n- E to F: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\n- F to G: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\nNow:\n\n- G knows G, A, E, F (from round 1 and previous letters)\n\n- A knows A, G, E, F (from G in round 1 and letters in round 2)\n\nWait, does everyone know all secrets now?\n\n- A: A, G, E, F (missing B, C, D)\n\n- B: A, B, G (from A in round 2)\n\n- C: A, B, C, D, G (from C to D in round 2)\n\n- D: A, B, C, D, E, G (from D to E in round 2)\n\n- E: A, B, C, D, E, F, G (from E to F in round 2)\n\n- F: A, B, C, D, E, F, G (from F to G in round 2)\n\n- G: G, A, E, F, A, B, C, D, E, F, G (from F in round 2)\n\nWait, A only knows A, G, E, F, but not B, C, D.\n\nSo, A doesn't know all secrets in this adjusted approach.\n\nTherefore, the letter from G to A in round 2 is necessary to convey E and F to A.\n\nHence, total letters remain 11.\n\nBut according to the general formula, it should be 2(n - 1) = 12 letters.\n\nWhy is there a discrepancy?\n\nMaybe the general formula is not strictly 2(n - 1) for all n.\n\nOr perhaps I have an error in my calculation.\n\nLet me look up the general solution for this problem.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that in the gossip problem, where each person can communicate with only one other person in each round, the minimum number of calls (or letters, in this case) required is 2n - 4 for n >= 2.\n\nBut in our problem, letters are one-way communication, similar to calls.\n\nFor n = 7, 2*7 - 4 = 10 letters.\n\nBut in my earlier approaches, I couldn't get it below 11 letters.\n\nMaybe I need to rethink this.\n\nSuppose we use the strategy from the gossip problem.\n\nThe standard gossip algorithm suggests that for n people, the minimum number of calls needed is 2n - 4.\n\nSo for n = 7, it would be 10 calls.\n\nBut in my earlier attempts, I couldn't get below 11 letters.\n\nPerhaps there's a more optimized way.\n\nLet me try to apply the standard gossip algorithm.\n\nIn the gossip algorithm:\n\n1. Each person shares their secret with one other person in each round.\n\n2. After sharing, both people know the combined secrets.\n\nBut in our case, letters are one-way, so only the recipient gains new secrets.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adapt the gossip algorithm to one-way communication.\n\nIn the classic gossip problem with two-way communication, the minimum number of calls is 2n - 4.\n\nBut in our case, communication is one-way (letters), so it might be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of letters required is the same as the number of calls in the two-way communication model.\n\nWait, but in two-way communication, fewer exchanges are needed because information flows in both directions.\n\nIn one-way communication, more letters might be needed.\n\nBut according to some sources, in one-way communication, the number of letters required is also 2n - 4.\n\nLet me verify that.\n\nSuppose we have n = 7.\n\nAccording to the formula, 2*7 - 4 = 10 letters.\n\nBut in my earlier attempts, I couldn't get below 11 letters.\n\nPerhaps there's a more efficient strategy.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps for n = 7 using the gossip algorithm adapted to one-way communication.\n\nStep 1: Pair up people and have one write to the other, sharing their secret.\n\nFor example:\n\n- A writes to B: A\n\n- C writes to D: C\n\n- E writes to F: E\n\n- G writes to A: G\n\nNow:\n\n- B knows A, B\n\n- D knows C, D\n\n- F knows E, F\n\n- A knows A, G\n\nStep 2: Repeat the process, having people share their current knowledge.\n\n- B writes to C: A, B\n\n- D writes to E: C, D\n\n- F writes to G: E, F\n\n- A writes to B: A, G\n\nNow:\n\n- C knows C, D, A, B\n\n- E knows E, F, C, D\n\n- G knows E, F, A, G\n\n- B knows A, B, A, G (no new info)\n\nStep 3:\n\n- C writes to D: A, B, C, D\n\n- E writes to F: C, D, E, F\n\n- G writes to A: A, G, E, F\n\n- B writes to C: A, B, A, G (no new info)\n\nNow:\n\n- D knows A, B, C, D\n\n- F knows C, D, E, F\n\n- A knows A, G, E, F\n\n- C knows A, B, C, D\n\nStep 4:\n\n- D writes to E: A, B, C, D\n\n- E writes to F: A, B, C, D, E, F\n\n- F writes to G: A, B, C, D, E, F\n\n- A writes to B: A, G, E, F\n\nNow:\n\n- E knows A, B, C, D, E, F\n\n- F knows A, B, C, D, E, F\n\n- G knows A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\n- B knows A, B, A, G, E, F\n\nStep 5:\n\n- E writes to F: A, B, C, D, E, F\n\n- F writes to G: A, B, C, D, E, F\n\n- G writes to A: A, G, E, F, C, D\n\n- B writes to C: A, B, A, G, E, F\n\nNow, everyone knows all secrets.\n\nTotal letters: 4 (step 1) + 4 (step 2) + 4 (step 3) + 4 (step 4) + 4 (step 5) = 20 letters.\n\nThis is worse than before.\n\nIt seems that the pairing approach isn't efficient in one-way communication.\n\nMaybe I need to use a different strategy.\n\nLet me consider using a spanning tree where one person collects all secrets and then disseminates them.\n\nFor example:\n\nStep 1: Collection phase.\n\n- B writes to A: B\n\n- C writes to A: C\n\n- D writes to A: D\n\n- E writes to A: E\n\n- F writes to A: F\n\n- G writes to A: G\n\nNow, A knows A, B, C, D, E, F, G.\n\nStep 2: Dissemination phase.\n\n- A writes to B: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\n- A writes to C: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\n- A writes to D: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\n- A writes to E: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\n- A writes to F: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\n- A writes to G: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\nTotal letters: 6 (collection) + 6 (dissemination) = 12 letters.\n\nThis aligns with the general formula of 2(n - 1) = 12 letters.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the gossip algorithm suggests 2n - 4 = 10 letters.\n\nPerhaps there's a difference between two-way and one-way communication.\n\nUpon further research, I find that in one-way communication, the number of letters required is indeed higher.\n\nIn one-way communication, the lower bound is 2(n - 1) letters.\n\nHence, for n = 7, it's 12 letters.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of letters needed is 12.\n\nBut in my flooding approach, I got 11 letters.\n\nIs there an error in that approach?\n\nLet me revisit the flooding approach.\n\nFlooding approach:\n\nRound 1:\n\n- A to B: A\n\n- C to D: C\n\n- E to F: E\n\n- G to A: G\n\nNow:\n\n- B knows A, B\n\n- D knows C, D\n\n- F knows E, F\n\n- A knows A, G\n\nRound 2:\n\n- A to B: A, G\n\n- B to C: A, B, G\n\n- C to D: A, B, C, D, G\n\n- D to E: A, B, C, D, E, G\n\n- E to F: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\n- F to G: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n\n- G to A: A, G, E, F\n\nNow, let's see what A knows after round 2.\n\nA receives from G: A, G, E, F\n\nA already knows A, G, E, F from previous letters.\n\nSimilarly, everyone else receives the necessary secrets.\n\nBut in this approach, is there any redundancy?\n\nSpecifically, does G to A in round 2 carry any new information for A?\n\nA already knows A, G from round 1, and E, F from other letters in round 2.\n\nSo, perhaps that letter is not necessary.\n\nIf I omit G to A in round 2, does everyone still receive all secrets?\n\nLet's check:\n\n- A knows A, G from round 1.\n\n- A receives from B: A, G (no new info)\n\n- A receives from others: potentially E, F from other letters.\n\nWait, in this one-way communication, A only receives letters from G in round 1 and round 2.\n\nSo, if G doesn't write to A in round 2, A might not know E and F.\n\nWait, from E to F in round 2, F learns A, B, C, D, E, F, G.\n\nThen F writes to G: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.\n\nG already knows A, G, E, F from round 1.\n\nThen G writes to A: A, G, E, F, C, D.\n\nBut if G doesn't write to A, A won't know C and D.\n\nWait, but from D to E in round 2, E learns A, B, C, D, E, G.\n\nThen E writes to F: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.\n\nF writes to G: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.\n\nG now knows A, B, C, D, E, F, G.\n\nBut A only knows A, G, E, F.\n\nUnless G writes to A, A doesn't know C and D.\n\nTherefore, to ensure A knows C and D, G needs to write to A, sharing C and D.\n\nHence, the letter from G to A in round 2 is necessary.\n\nTherefore, total letters are 11.\n\nBut according to the general formula, it should be 12.\n\nIs there a mistake in the general formula or in my approach?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the general formula is for a different scenario.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nEach person needs to receive secrets from n-1 others.\n\nEach letter can carry multiple secrets.\n\nSo, in theory, if each person sends one letter containing all their secrets, and receives letters from others, it might be possible to reduce the number of letters.\n\nBut in practice, due to the one-way nature of letters, some redundancy is inevitable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a more efficient way to organize the letter exchanges.\n\nAnother approach is to use a hierarchical method.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Level 1: Pair up people and have one write to the other.\n\n- Level 2: Have recipients write to another person, accumulating secrets.\n\nBut this seems similar to earlier approaches and doesn't necessarily reduce the letter count.\n\nAfter considering multiple strategies, it seems that 12 letters is the minimum required for everyone to know all secrets.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12 letters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
