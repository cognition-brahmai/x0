        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a company that produces widgets. They cost $8 to make each widget, and they sell each one for $12. On top of that, they have fixed costs of $2,000 per month. The question is, how many widgets do they need to sell in one month to break even?\n\nAlright, breaking even means that the total revenue equals the total costs. Total costs include both the fixed costs and the variable costs. Variable costs are the costs that change with the level of production, like the cost per widget, while fixed costs stay the same regardless of how many widgets are produced.\n\nSo, first, let's define the variables:\n\n- Let\u2019s let \\( x \\) be the number of widgets they need to sell to break even.\n\nThe total revenue (TR) from selling \\( x \\) widgets at $12 each would be:\n\n\\[ TR = 12x \\]\n\nThe total costs (TC) include the fixed costs of $2,000 plus the variable costs of $8 per widget:\n\n\\[ TC = 2000 + 8x \\]\n\nTo break even, total revenue equals total costs:\n\n\\[ 12x = 2000 + 8x \\]\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\( x \\). Let's subtract \\( 8x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 12x - 8x = 2000 + 8x - 8x \\]\n\n\\[ 4x = 2000 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{2000}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 500 \\]\n\nSo, they need to sell 500 widgets to break even.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach it differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to look at break-even analysis is to use the break-even point formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Break-even point (in units)} = \\frac{\\text{Fixed Costs}}{\\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \\text{Variable Cost per Unit}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Break-even point} = \\frac{2000}{12 - 8} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Break-even point} = \\frac{2000}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Break-even point} = 500 \\]\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, selling 500 widgets should cover both the fixed and variable costs.\n\nLet me just simulate this to make sure.\n\nIf they sell 500 widgets:\n\n- Total revenue: 500 * 12 = $6,000\n\n- Total variable costs: 500 * 8 = $4,000\n\n- Total costs: fixed costs + variable costs = 2,000 + 4,000 = $6,000\n\nYes, revenue equals costs at 500 widgets. Perfect.\n\nBut what if they sell more or less than 500 widgets?\n\nIf they sell less than 500, say 400 widgets:\n\n- Revenue: 400 * 12 = $4,800\n\n- Costs: 2,000 + (400 * 8) = 2,000 + 3,200 = $5,200\n\n- Profit: 4,800 - 5,200 = -$400 (loss)\n\nIf they sell more than 500, say 600 widgets:\n\n- Revenue: 600 * 12 = $7,200\n\n- Costs: 2,000 + (600 * 8) = 2,000 + 4,800 = $6,800\n\n- Profit: 7,200 - 6,800 = $400\n\nSo, indeed, 500 is the break-even point.\n\nWait, but let's consider if there are any other costs or factors that might affect this. Are there any taxes, additional variable costs, or anything else mentioned in the problem? Nope, the problem seems straightforward.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the selling price is indeed $12 per widget and the cost is $8 per widget, with fixed costs at $2,000 per month.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the contribution margin per unit, which is the selling price minus the variable cost per unit.\n\nContribution margin per unit = 12 - 8 = $4\n\nThen, the break-even point in units is fixed costs divided by contribution margin per unit:\n\n\\[ \\text{Break-even point} = \\frac{2000}{4} = 500 \\]\n\nAgain, confirming the same answer.\n\nLet me consider if the fixed costs include any other expenses. The problem states that fixed costs are $2,000 per month, so I'll assume that's all inclusive for the purpose of this calculation.\n\nAlso, assuming that the selling price and variable costs per unit remain constant, which they do in this scenario.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the company needs to sell 500 widgets in one month to break even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500} \\]"
