        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there are 20 different types of candy, and I want to buy exactly 5 different types. I need to find out how many possible combinations I can choose. Hmm, combinations, that means the order doesn't matter, right? It's not like I'm picking them in a specific sequence; I just want any 5 types out of the 20.\n\nOkay, so in math terms, this sounds like a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 20 and k = 5.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers: C(20, 5) = 20! / (5!(20 - 5)!) = 20! / (5! * 15!).\n\nNow, calculating factorials can get really big really fast, and 20! is a massive number. But maybe I can simplify this before calculating the entire factorials.\n\nI know that 20! = 20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 15!, so the 15! in the denominator will cancel out with the 15! in the numerator.\n\nSo, C(20, 5) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 15!) / (5! \u00d7 15!)) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 16) / 5!.\n\nNow, 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nSo, C(20, 5) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 16) / 120.\n\nLet me calculate the numerator first: 20 \u00d7 19 = 380.\n\nThen, 380 \u00d7 18 = 6840.\n\nNext, 6840 \u00d7 17 = 116280.\n\nThen, 116280 \u00d7 16 = 1,860,480.\n\nSo, the numerator is 1,860,480.\n\nNow, divide that by 120: 1,860,480 / 120.\n\nLet's see, 120 \u00d7 15,500 = 1,860,000, which is close to 1,860,480.\n\nWait, maybe I should do the division step by step.\n\nFirst, 120 \u00d7 15,500 = 1,860,000.\n\nSubtract that from 1,860,480: 1,860,480 - 1,860,000 = 480.\n\nNow, 120 \u00d7 4 = 480.\n\nSo, 15,500 + 4 = 15,504.\n\nTherefore, C(20, 5) = 15,504.\n\nSo, there are 15,504 possible combinations of 5 different types of candy that I can choose from 20 types.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check this calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me recalculate the numerator: 20 \u00d7 19 = 380.\n\n380 \u00d7 18 = 6,840.\n\n6,840 \u00d7 17 = 116,280.\n\n116,280 \u00d7 16 = 1,860,480.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, divide 1,860,480 by 120.\n\n1,860,480 \u00f7 120.\n\nWell, 120 \u00d7 15,504 = 1,860,480.\n\nYes, so 15,504 is indeed the correct number of combinations.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used a calculator or a combinations calculator online to verify this, but since I'm doing it manually, I think this is accurate.\n\nSo, the final answer is 15,504 possible combinations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15504} \\]"
