        "content": "Radio and broadcasting have a rich history that spans over a century. The invention of the radio in the late 19th century by Guglielmo Marconi paved the way for wireless communication. In the early 20th century, radio broadcasts began to emerge, with the first licensed radio station, KDKA in Pittsburgh, starting operations in 1920. The 1920s saw a rapid expansion of radio stations across the United States and Europe, bringing news, music, and entertainment into people's homes. The advent of television in the 1950s posed a challenge to radio, but it adapted by focusing on music, talk shows, and news. The 1960s and 1970s saw the rise of FM radio and the proliferation of specialty genres like rock, pop, and public broadcasting. In recent decades, digital radio and internet streaming have transformed the industry, offering unprecedented choices and global reach. Today, radio continues to evolve, integrating with smartphones and smart speakers, maintaining its relevance in the digital age."
