        "content": "So the company's revenue is growing at 8% each year, and right now it's at $500,000. We want to know what it will be in 5 years. To figure this out, we can use the formula for compound growth, which is similar to how interest works in a bank.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Future Revenue} = \\text{Current Revenue} \\times (1 + \\text{growth rate})^{\\text{number of years}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n- Current Revenue = $500,000\n\n- Growth Rate = 8% = 0.08\n\n- Number of Years = 5\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\text{Future Revenue} = 500,000 \\times (1 + 0.08)^5 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(1 + 0.08 = 1.08\\).\n\nThen, raise 1.08 to the power of 5:\n\n\\[1.08^5\\]\n\nLet me calculate that. 1.08 multiplied by itself five times.\n\n\\[1.08 \\times 1.08 = 1.1664\\]\\[1.1664 \\times 1.08 = 1.259712\\]\\[1.259712 \\times 1.08 = 1.359121\\]\\[1.359121 \\times 1.08 = 1.469328\\]\n\nSo, \\(1.08^5 \\approx 1.469328\\).\n\nNow, multiply that by the current revenue:\n\n\\[500,000 \\times 1.469328 = 734,664\\]\n\nTherefore, the company's revenue in 5 years will be approximately $734,664.\n\nBut let me check that again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting with $500,000.\n\nAfter year 1: \\(500,000 \\times 1.08 = 540,000\\)\n\nAfter year 2: \\(540,000 \\times 1.08 = 583,200\\)\n\nAfter year 3: \\(583,200 \\times 1.08 = 629,856\\)\n\nAfter year 4: \\(629,856 \\times 1.08 = 680,053.28\\)\n\nAfter year 5: \\(680,053.28 \\times 1.08 = 734,666.1664\\)\n\nOkay, so my initial calculation was a bit off. The correct future revenue after 5 years is approximately $734,666.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the formula directly:\n\n\\[ \\text{Future Revenue} = 500,000 \\times (1.08)^5 \\]\n\nCalculating \\(1.08^5\\):\n\n\\[1.08^5 = 1.4693280768\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[500,000 \\times 1.4693280768 = 734,664.0384\\]\n\nRounded to the nearest dollar, it's $734,664.\n\nWait a minute, in my step-by-step calculation, I got $734,666, but using the formula, it's $734,664. There's a slight discrepancy here.\n\nLet me check my step-by-step multiplication:\n\nYear 1: 500,000 * 1.08 = 540,000\n\nYear 2: 540,000 * 1.08 = 583,200\n\nYear 3: 583,200 * 1.08 = 629,856\n\nYear 4: 629,856 * 1.08 = 680,053.28\n\nYear 5: 680,053.28 * 1.08 = 734,666.1664\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 734,664.0384.\n\nHmm, the difference is likely due to rounding errors in the step-by-step method.\n\nTherefore, the more accurate answer is $734,664.\n\nSo, the company's revenue in 5 years will be approximately $734,664.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{734664} \\]"
