        "content": "Yes, that's correct. Antarctica is considered the least inhabited continent on Earth. It's a unique place governed by the Antarctic Treaty System, which ensures its protection for peaceful and scientific purposes. The population there is primarily made up of scientists and researchers who work in various research stations scattered across the continent. The number of people present at any given time is relatively small compared to other continents."
