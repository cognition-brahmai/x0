        "content": "So I've got this problem here about people speaking different languages in a room. There are 4 people who speak English, 3 who speak French, and 2 who speak both English and French. I need to find out how many people speak only one language. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many people speak only English and how many speak only French, and then add those two numbers together to get the total number of people who speak only one language.\n\nSo, if there are 4 people who speak English, and among them, 2 speak both English and French, that means that 4 minus 2 equals 2 people speak only English.\n\nSimilarly, for French, there are 3 people who speak French, and 2 of them speak both English and French, so 3 minus 2 equals 1 person who speaks only French.\n\nNow, to find the total number of people who speak only one language, I'll add the number of people who speak only English to those who speak only French: 2 + 1 equals 3.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check if there are any overlaps or if I'm missing something. The 2 people who speak both languages are already accounted for in the totals of English and French speakers, so I don't need to count them again.\n\nLet me visualize this with a Venn diagram in my mind. There's a circle for English speakers and a circle for French speakers. The overlapping part contains 2 people who speak both languages. The English circle has 4 people in total, so the part that doesn't overlap with French would be 4 - 2 = 2 people who speak only English. Similarly, the French circle has 3 people in total, so 3 - 2 = 1 person speaks only French.\n\nSo, only English speakers: 2\nOnly French speakers: 1\nTotal only one language: 2 + 1 = 3\n\nThat seems straightforward. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any people who don't speak either language, but the question doesn't mention anyone who doesn't speak either, so I'll assume that everyone in the room speaks at least one of the two languages.\n\nAlternatively, if there are people who speak neither English nor French, they wouldn't be included in the counts given, but since the question is only about how many speak only one language, and it doesn't provide information about people who speak neither, I can proceed with the assumption that all people in the room speak at least one of the two languages.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem states \"in the room there are 4 people who speak English, 3 who speak French, and 2 who speak both.\" It doesn't specify the total number of people in the room, so theoretically, there could be people who don't speak either language. However, since the problem only gives me information about English and French speakers, and the overlap between them, I should probably assume that these are the only groups present in the room, meaning that the total number of people in the room is the sum of those who speak only English, only French, and both.\n\nSo, total people in the room would be: only English (2) + only French (1) + both (2) = 5 people.\n\nBut the question is only asking for the number of people who speak only one language, which, as I calculated earlier, is 3.\n\nHmm, but let me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion principle states that to find the total number of elements in the union of two sets, you add the sizes of the individual sets and subtract the size of their intersection.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\nTotal speakers = English speakers + French speakers - both.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: Total speakers = 4 + 3 - 2 = 5.\n\nNow, out of these 5 speakers, 2 speak both languages, so the number of people who speak only one language would be total speakers minus those who speak both: 5 - 2 = 3.\n\nOkay, this matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of people who speak only English and only French separately and then add them up, as I did before:\n\nOnly English: English speakers - both = 4 - 2 = 2\n\nOnly French: French speakers - both = 3 - 2 = 1\n\nTotal only one language: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nEither way, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nI think that's solid. There doesn't seem to be any ambiguity in the problem statement, and the math is straightforward.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any possibility of people speaking other languages or if there's any overlapping beyond English and French. The problem specifies only English and French speakers and those who speak both, so I don't think there are other variables to consider.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who speak only one language is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
