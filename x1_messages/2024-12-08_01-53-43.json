If you read 2 chapters every day, and there are 30 days in the month, then the total number of chapters you'll have read is simply 2 chapters/day multiplied by 30 days.\n\nSo, that's 2 \u00d7 30.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n2 \u00d7 30 = 60.\n\nTherefore, you will have read 60 chapters after 30 days.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if the book has fewer than 60 chapters. For example, if the book only has 50 chapters, you can't read 60 chapters from it. But since the question doesn't specify the total number of chapters in the book, I'll assume that there are at least 60 chapters available to read.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any days off or if you read more or less on certain days, but the question says you read 2 chapters every day, so consistency is assumed.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the length of the chapters. If some chapters are longer than others, but since you're reading 2 chapters each day, regardless of length, the total should still be 60 chapters.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way to think about this. Let's consider that each day you read 2 chapters, and this continues for 30 days without any breaks. So, it's a straightforward multiplication: 2 chapters/day \u00d7 30 days = 60 chapters.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to look at it in terms of weeks, there are about 4 weeks in a month. Each week, you would read 2 chapters/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 14 chapters/week. Then, over 4 weeks, that would be 14 chapters/week \u00d7 4 weeks = 56 chapters. But since it's 30 days, which is a bit more than 4 weeks, you have to account for the extra days. 30 days - 28 days = 2 extra days. So, 56 chapters + (2 chapters/day \u00d7 2 days) = 56 + 4 = 60 chapters. This matches the earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to think about it in total hours spent reading or something, but since the question is purely about the number of chapters read based on a daily rate over a set number of days, the multiplication method seems sufficient.\n\nI think the answer is straightforward: 60 chapters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
