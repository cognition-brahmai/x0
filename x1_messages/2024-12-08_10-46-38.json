        "content": "So I've got this problem here about forming a committee with some specific conditions. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it.\n\nWe need to form a committee of 5 people from a group of 7 men and 6 women, and there must be at least 3 women on the committee. Okay, so the total number of people to choose from is 7 men plus 6 women, which is 13 people altogether.\n\nNow, the condition is that there must be at least 3 women. That means the committee can have 3 women and 2 men, or 4 women and 1 man, or even 5 women and no men. So, I need to consider all these possibilities.\n\nFirst, I recall that the number of ways to choose k people from a group of n is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\nSo, for each possible number of women on the committee, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose that many women and the corresponding number of men, and then add those up.\n\nLet's start with the case where there are 3 women and 2 men.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 3 women from 6 is C(6, 3).\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose 2 men from 7 is C(7, 2).\n\nSo, the total number of ways for this scenario is C(6, 3) * C(7, 2).\n\nNext, for 4 women and 1 man:\n\nNumber of ways to choose 4 women from 6 is C(6, 4).\n\nNumber of ways to choose 1 man from 7 is C(7, 1).\n\nTotal for this scenario: C(6, 4) * C(7, 1).\n\nLastly, for 5 women and 0 men:\n\nNumber of ways to choose 5 women from 6 is C(6, 5).\n\nNumber of ways to choose 0 men from 7 is C(7, 0), which is 1, since there's only one way to choose nothing.\n\nSo, total for this scenario: C(6, 5) * 1 = C(6, 5).\n\nNow, I need to calculate each of these combinations.\n\nFirst, C(6, 3):\n\n6! / (3! * (6 - 3)!) = (6 * 5 * 4 * 3!) / (3! * 3!) = (6 * 5 * 4) / (6) = (120) / 6 = 20.\n\nWait, actually, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 720 / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. Okay, that checks out.\n\nNext, C(7, 2):\n\n7! / (2! * 5!) = (7 * 6 * 5!) / (2! * 5!)) = (7 * 6) / 2 = 42 / 2 = 21.\n\nSo, for 3 women and 2 men: 20 * 21 = 420 ways.\n\nNow, C(6, 4):\n\n6! / (4! * 2!) = (720) / (24 * 2) = 720 / 48 = 15.\n\nC(7, 1) = 7.\n\nSo, for 4 women and 1 man: 15 * 7 = 105 ways.\n\nLastly, C(6, 5):\n\n6! / (5! * 1!) = (720) / (120 * 1) = 720 / 120 = 6.\n\nAnd C(7, 0) = 1.\n\nSo, for 5 women and 0 men: 6 * 1 = 6 ways.\n\nNow, I need to add up all these possibilities: 420 + 105 + 6.\n\nLet's see: 420 + 105 is 525, plus 6 is 531.\n\nTherefore, there are 531 different ways to form this committee with at least 3 women.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting over:\n\nC(6, 3) = 20\n\nC(7, 2) = 21\n\n20 * 21 = 420\n\nC(6, 4) = 15\n\nC(7, 1) = 7\n\n15 * 7 = 105\n\nC(6, 5) = 6\n\nC(7, 0) = 1\n\n6 * 1 = 6\n\nTotal: 420 + 105 = 525 + 6 = 531\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using the total number of possible committees and subtracting those that don't meet the condition.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose any 5 people from 13 is C(13, 5).\n\nNumber of ways to choose committees with fewer than 3 women, which would be 0, 1, or 2 women.\n\nBut the problem specifies at least 3 women, so perhaps my initial approach is more straightforward.\n\nStill, let's see:\n\nTotal committees: C(13, 5) = 1287.\n\nCommittees with fewer than 3 women: committees with 0, 1, or 2 women.\n\nCalculate the number of committees with 0 women (all men): C(7, 5) * C(6, 0) = 21 * 1 = 21.\n\nWith 1 woman: C(6, 1) * C(7, 4) = 6 * 35 = 210.\n\nWith 2 women: C(6, 2) * C(7, 3) = 15 * 35 = 525.\n\nTotal committees with fewer than 3 women: 21 + 210 + 525 = 756.\n\nThen, total committees with at least 3 women would be total committees minus committees with fewer than 3 women: 1287 - 756 = 531.\n\nOkay, this matches my earlier calculation. So, 531 is indeed the correct answer.\n\nI guess both approaches lead to the same result, which reassures me that 531 is correct.\n\nIt's always good to cross-verify using different methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nSo, the final answer is 531 ways.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{531} \\]"
