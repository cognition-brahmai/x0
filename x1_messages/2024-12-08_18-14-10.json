A fair six-sided die has numbers from 1 to 6, and each number has an equal chance of landing face up. The expected value is basically the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents. In other words, if you roll the die many, many times, what would you expect the average outcome to be?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what expected value means in probability. The expected value (often denoted as E(X)) of a discrete random variable X is calculated by taking the sum of all possible values, each multiplied by the probability of occurrence. The formula is:\n\n\\[ E(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\cdot p_i \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( x_i \\) is the value of the ith outcome,\n\n- \\( p_i \\) is the probability of the ith outcome.\n\nIn the case of a fair six-sided die:\n\n- The possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n- Since the die is fair, each outcome has an equal probability of \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n\nSo, plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ E(X) = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} + 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} + 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} + 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} + 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} \\]\n\nNow, let's do the math step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply each outcome by its probability:\n\n\\[ 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{6} \\]\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} \\]\n\n\\[ 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{3}{6} \\]\n\n\\[ 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{6} \\]\n\n\\[ 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6} \\]\n\n\\[ 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{6}{6} \\]\n\nNow, add all these fractions together:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{2}{6} + \\frac{3}{6} + \\frac{4}{6} + \\frac{5}{6} + \\frac{6}{6} \\]\n\nSince they all have the same denominator, we can add the numerators directly:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6}{6} = \\frac{21}{6} \\]\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{21}{6} = 3.5 \\]\n\nSo, the expected value of rolling a fair six-sided die is 3.5.\n\nBut wait a minute, 3.5 isn't even a possible outcome on the die! That's okay because expected value doesn't have to be one of the actual outcomes. It's just the average value you'd expect over many rolls.\n\nTo make sure this makes sense, let's think about it another way. If you roll the die many times and keep track of the total sum, then divide by the number of rolls, you should get close to 3.5.\n\nFor example, if you roll the die 6 times and get each number once (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), the total is 21, and the average is 21 divided by 6, which is 3.5.\n\nOf course, in reality, the results might vary, but over a large number of rolls, the average should approach 3.5.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula for the expected value of a uniform distribution, which a fair die is. For a discrete uniform distribution with n possible outcomes, the expected value is:\n\n\\[ E(X) = \\frac{n + 1}{2} \\]\n\nIn this case, n = 6, so:\n\n\\[ E(X) = \\frac{6 + 1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \\]\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, whether you use the definition of expected value or a formula for uniform distribution, you end up with the same answer: 3.5.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if something isn't clear."
