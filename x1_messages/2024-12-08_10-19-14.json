        "content": "So I have this problem: if a baker uses 2 eggs to make 3 cupcakes, how many eggs does she need to make 60 cupcakes? And I need to include my logic in the answer.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The problem gives me a ratio: 2 eggs for 3 cupcakes. I need to find out how many eggs are needed for 60 cupcakes. This sounds like a proportion problem.\n\nFirst, I should understand the relationship between eggs and cupcakes. The ratio is 2 eggs for every 3 cupcakes. So, for every 3 cupcakes, she uses 2 eggs.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many eggs are needed for 60 cupcakes. One way to approach this is to find out how many sets of 3 cupcakes are there in 60 cupcakes. Then, since each set requires 2 eggs, I can multiply the number of sets by 2 to get the total number of eggs needed.\n\nLet me calculate that. Number of sets of 3 cupcakes in 60 cupcakes is 60 divided by 3, which is 20. So, there are 20 sets of 3 cupcakes in 60 cupcakes.\n\nNow, since each set requires 2 eggs, total eggs needed would be 20 sets times 2 eggs per set, which is 40 eggs.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using proportions.\n\nYes, I can set up a proportion. If 2 eggs are needed for 3 cupcakes, then x eggs are needed for 60 cupcakes. So, the proportion would be:\n\n2/3 = x/60\n\nTo find x, I can cross-multiply:\n\n2 * 60 = 3 * x\n\n120 = 3x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 120 / 3\n\nx = 40\n\nSo, again, I get 40 eggs.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe using multiples.\n\nYes, I can think about scaling up the original ratio. The original ratio is 2 eggs for 3 cupcakes. To get to 60 cupcakes, I need to see how many times 3 goes into 60, which is 20 times. So, I need to multiply the number of eggs by the same factor.\n\n2 eggs * 20 = 40 eggs\n\nAgain, 40 eggs.\n\nLet me try another approach. What if I find out how many eggs are needed per cupcake, and then multiply by 60.\n\nSo, for 3 cupcakes, she uses 2 eggs. Therefore, per cupcake, she uses 2/3 eggs.\n\nNow, for 60 cupcakes, it would be 60 * (2/3) eggs.\n\nLet me calculate that: 60 * 2/3 = 120/3 = 40 eggs.\n\nOnce more, I get 40 eggs.\n\nIs there any other method I can use to confirm this?\n\nMaybe using dimensional analysis.\n\nStarting with the given rate: 2 eggs / 3 cupcakes.\n\nI need to find eggs per 60 cupcakes.\n\nSo, (2 eggs / 3 cupcakes) * 60 cupcakes = ?\n\nThe cupcakes unit cancels out, leaving eggs.\n\n2/3 * 60 = 40 eggs.\n\nAgain, 40 eggs.\n\nAlright, all these different methods are leading me to the same answer: 40 eggs.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that the relationship isn't directly proportional. Maybe there are economies of scale or some other factors that come into play when making a larger number of cupcakes.\n\nBut based on the problem statement, it seems like the relationship is directly proportional. There's no information suggesting that additional eggs are needed for larger batches or anything like that. So, I can safely assume that the ratio remains constant.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 40 eggs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
