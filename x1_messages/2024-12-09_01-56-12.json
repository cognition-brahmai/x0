        "content": "Let's see. The recipe says 2 cups of sugar make 24 cookies. But I need to make 60 cookies. Hmm, I need to figure out how much sugar is needed for that.\n\nFirst, maybe I should find out how much sugar is needed for one cookie. If 2 cups make 24 cookies, then one cookie would need 2 cups divided by 24 cookies. That would be 2/24, which simplifies to 1/12 cup per cookie.\n\nNow, if one cookie needs 1/12 cup of sugar, then 60 cookies would need 60 times that amount. So, 60 multiplied by 1/12. Let's see, 60 divided by 12 is 5. So, 5 cups of sugar.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If 24 cookies need 2 cups, then 60 cookies is 60/24 times more cookies. 60 divided by 24 is 2.5. So, 2.5 times the original 2 cups would be 5 cups. Yeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to set up a proportion. If 2 cups are to 24 cookies, then x cups are to 60 cookies. So, 2/24 = x/60. Solving for x, cross-multiplying, 24x = 2 * 60, which is 120. So, x = 120 / 24, which is 5 cups.\n\nOkay, all methods point to 5 cups of sugar needed for 60 cookies. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
