        "content": "So I have this problem here about students playing soccer and basketball. Let me see if I can figure this out. There are 40 students in total. Out of these, 12 play soccer, 15 play basketball, and 9 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a problem that can be solved using sets or maybe a Venn diagram. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's give it a try.\n\nFirst, I know that if some students play both sports, they are counted in both the soccer and basketball groups. So, to find out how many students play at least one of the sports, I need to add the number of soccer and basketball players and then subtract those who play both, so I don't double-count them.\n\nSo, the number of students who play at least one sport would be:\n\nNumber playing soccer + number playing basketball - number playing both.\n\nThat would be 12 + 15 - 9 = 18 students.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me check that calculation again. 12 plus 15 is 27, minus 9 is 18. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo, 18 students play at least one sport. Now, to find out how many don't play either, I subtract this number from the total number of students.\n\nTotal students - students playing at least one sport = students playing neither.\n\nThat would be 40 - 18 = 22 students.\n\nBut, I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct approach. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I recall that in set theory, the principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any two sets, the size of their union is the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of their intersection.\n\nSo, in this case, the number of students playing at least one sport is equal to the number playing soccer plus the number playing basketball minus the number playing both.\n\nWhich is again 12 + 15 - 9 = 18.\n\nThen, the number of students playing neither would be the total number minus those playing at least one sport, which is 40 - 18 = 22.\n\nThis seems consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can verify this by considering the number of students playing only soccer, only basketball, and neither.\n\nThe number playing only soccer would be total soccer players minus those who play both, which is 12 - 9 = 3.\n\nSimilarly, the number playing only basketball would be 15 - 9 = 6.\n\nThen, the number playing at least one sport would be those playing only soccer plus only basketball plus both, which is 3 + 6 + 9 = 18.\n\nAgain, this matches my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the number of students playing neither sport is 40 - 18 = 22.\n\nI think this is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I make a Venn diagram with two circles, one for soccer and one for basketball.\n\nThe overlap between the two circles represents students who play both sports, which is 9 students.\n\nThe part of the soccer circle outside the overlap represents students who play only soccer, which is 12 - 9 = 3.\n\nSimilarly, the part of the basketball circle outside the overlap represents students who play only basketball, which is 15 - 9 = 6.\n\nThen, the area outside both circles represents students who play neither sport.\n\nTotal students in the soccer or basketball circles are 3 + 6 + 9 = 18.\n\nSo, again, students playing neither sport would be 40 - 18 = 22.\n\nThis seems consistent across different methods, so I'm confident that the answer is 22 students.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22} \\]"
