        "content": "Sure, I can help you design a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. This game will allow two players to take turns entering their moves, and it will display the game state after each move. The game will check for a winner after each move and declare a draw if all spots are filled without a winner.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Board Representation:** Use a 3x3 char array to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board.\n2. **Player Turns:** Alternate between players 'X' and 'O'.\n3. **Input Handling:** Prompt players to enter their moves in the format \"row col\".\n4. **Win Conditions:** Check rows, columns, and diagonals after each move.\n5. **Draw Condition:** Check if the board is full and no winner is found.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int BOARD_SIZE = 3;\n\n// Function to initialize the game board\nvoid initializeBoard(char board[BOARD_SIZE][BOARD_SIZE]) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < BOARD_SIZE; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < BOARD_SIZE; j++) {\n            board[i][j] = ' ';\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to print the game board\nvoid printBoard(char board[BOARD_SIZE][BOARD_SIZE]) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < BOARD_SIZE; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < BOARD_SIZE; j++) {\n            cout << board[i][j];\n            if (j < BOARD_SIZE - 1) cout << \" | \";\n        }\n        cout << endl;\n        if (i < BOARD_SIZE - 1) cout << \"---------\" << endl;\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to check if a player has won\nbool checkWin(char board[BOARD_SIZE][BOARD_SIZE], char player) {\n    // Check rows\n    for (int i = 0; i < BOARD_SIZE; i++) {\n        if (board[i][0] == player && board[i][1] == player && board[i][2] == player)\n            return true;\n    }\n    // Check columns\n    for (int j = 0; j < BOARD_SIZE; j++) {\n        if (board[0][j] == player && board[1][j] == player && board[2][j] == player)\n            return true;\n    }\n    // Check diagonals\n    if (board[0][0] == player && board[1][1] == player && board[2][2] == player)\n        return true;\n    if (board[0][2] == player && board[1][1] == player && board[2][0] == player)\n        return true;\n    return false;\n}\n\n// Function to check if the board is full\nbool isFull(char board[BOARD_SIZE][BOARD_SIZE]) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < BOARD_SIZE; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < BOARD_SIZE; j++) {\n            if (board[i][j] == ' ') return false;\n        }\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    char board[BOARD_SIZE][BOARD_SIZE];\n    initializeBoard(board);\n    char current_player = 'X';\n    int row, col;\n\n    while (true) {\n        printBoard(board);\n        cout << \"Player \" << current_player << \", enter your move (row col): \";\n        cin >> row >> col;\n\n        // Check if the move is valid\n        if (row < 0 || row >= BOARD_SIZE || col < 0 || col >= BOARD_SIZE) {\n            cout << \"Invalid move. Try again.\" << endl;\n            continue;\n        }\n        if (board[row][col] != ' ') {\n            cout << \"Spot already taken. Try again.\" << endl;\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        // Make the move\n        board[row][col] = current_player;\n\n        // Check for win\n        if (checkWin(board, current_player)) {\n            printBoard(board);\n            cout << \"Player \" << current_player << \" wins!\" << endl;\n            break;\n        }\n\n        // Check for draw\n        if (isFull(board)) {\n            printBoard(board);\n            cout << \"It's a draw!\" << endl;\n            break;\n        }\n\n        // Switch players\n        current_player = (current_player == 'X') ? 'O' : 'X';\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Board Initialization and Display:**\n   - `initializeBoard`: Sets all positions on the board to empty spaces.\n   - `printBoard`: Prints the current state of the board in a 3x3 grid format.\n\n2. **Win and Draw Conditions:**\n   - `checkWin`: Checks all possible winning combinations for the current player.\n   - `isFull`: Checks if the board is completely filled, indicating a draw.\n\n3. **Game Loop:**\n   - Alternates between players 'X' and 'O'.\n   - Prompts players to enter their moves and validates the input.\n   - Updates the board with the player's move and checks for a win or draw after each move.\n\nThis simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game provides a basic implementation and can be extended with additional features like AI opponents or graphical interfaces."
