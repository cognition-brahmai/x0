        "content": "Let's see. So, Sarah baked cookies and left them on the kitchen counter to cool down. Then she went to pick up her kids from school. While she was away, her sister Emily came in and moved half of the cookies into an orange container and left the rest on the counter. Emily then went out to meet her friend. Later, David, Sarah's husband, came home and saw the cookies that were still on the counter. He decided to put those remaining cookies into a yellow container.\n\nNow, the question is, where will Sarah think the cookies are when she returns home?\n\nHmm, to answer this, I need to think about what Sarah knows and what she doesn't know. Sarah left the cookies on the counter and didn't know that Emily moved half of them into an orange container. So, from Sarah's perspective, she thinks all the cookies are still on the counter.\n\nThen, David came home and saw the cookies on the counter and put them into a yellow container. But again, Sarah doesn't know that David did this.\n\nSo, when Sarah comes back home, she would probably look for the cookies on the counter, right? Because that's where she left them. But when she goes to the counter, she'll find that some or all of the cookies are missing.\n\nWait a minute, Emily moved half of the cookies into an orange container, and then David put the remaining half into a yellow container. So, originally, Sarah left all the cookies on the counter. Emily took half and put them in an orange container, leaving the other half on the counter. Then David took that half that was left on the counter and put them into a yellow container.\n\nTherefore, all the cookies are now in two different containers: half in the orange container and half in the yellow container.\n\nBut Sarah doesn't know any of this because she was away picking up her kids.\n\nSo, where will Sarah think the cookies are? She thinks they are on the counter, right? Because that's where she left them.\n\nBut they're not there anymore. So, she might be confused or wonder what happened to them.\n\nMaybe she'll think that someone took them or that she forgot to account for something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a possibility that Sarah knows that Emily or David might move the cookies, but based on the story, it seems like she has no prior knowledge of them moving the cookies.\n\nWait, the story doesn't mention anything about Sarah being aware of Emily or David moving the cookies, so I think it's safe to assume that Sarah has no idea that they moved the cookies.\n\nTherefore, Sarah will probably think that the cookies are still on the counter where she left them.\n\nBut in reality, they are in two different containers: orange and yellow.\n\nSo, when she looks for them on the counter and doesn't find them, she might think that someone took them or that she misremembered where she left them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a possibility that Sarah assigned Emily to watch the cookies or something, but the story doesn't indicate that.\n\nGiven the information provided, I think the most likely scenario is that Sarah will think the cookies are on the counter, but they are actually in the orange and yellow containers.\n\nMaybe she'll look on the counter, don't find them, and then look around for the containers.\n\nBut the question is, where will she think the cookies are when she returns home.\n\nI think she will think they are on the counter.\n\nUnless there's something I'm missing.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that Sarah might have told Emily or David about the cookies, but the story doesn't mention that.\n\nIt seems like Sarah baked the cookies, left them on the counter, and didn't inform anyone about them.\n\nEmily then moved half without Sarah knowing, and David moved the remaining half without Sarah knowing.\n\nSo, Sarah's expectation is that the cookies are still on the counter.\n\nTherefore, she will look for them there.\n\nBut in reality, they are in the containers.\n\nSo, she might be surprised or confused when she doesn't find them on the counter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a possibility that Emily or David tells Sarah where the cookies are, but again, the story doesn't indicate that.\n\nSo, based on the information given, I think the answer is that Sarah will think the cookies are on the counter when she returns home.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{on the counter}} \\]"
