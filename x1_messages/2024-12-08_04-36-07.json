        "content": "**SQL Schema for Movie Rental System**\n\nTo design a SQL schema for a movie rental system, we need to consider the entities involved and their relationships. The main entities are Customers, Movies, Rentals, and Payments. Here's a suggested schema:\n\n### Tables\n\n1. **Customers**\n    - `customer_id` (Primary Key)\n    - `first_name`\n    - `last_name`\n    - `email`\n    - `phone`\n    - `address`\n\n2. **Movies**\n    - `movie_id` (Primary Key)\n    - `title`\n    - `release_year`\n    - `rating`\n    - `description`\n    - `genre`\n\n3. **Rentals**\n    - `rental_id` (Primary Key)\n    - `customer_id` (Foreign Key referencing Customers)\n    - `movie_id` (Foreign Key referencing Movies)\n    - `rental_date`\n    - `return_date`\n    - `rental_fee`\n\n4. **Payments**\n    - `payment_id` (Primary Key)\n    - `rental_id` (Foreign Key referencing Rentals)\n    - `payment_date`\n    - `amount`\n\n### Schema Diagram\n\n```plaintext\nCustomers (customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, address)\n          |\n          | 1\n          |---\n          |     Rentals (rental_id, customer_id, movie_id, rental_date, return_date, rental_fee)\n          |          |\n          |          | 1\n          |          |---\n          |                 Payments (payment_id, rental_id, payment_date, amount)\n          |\n          |     Movies (movie_id, title, release_year, rating, description, genre)\n```\n\n### SQL Statements\n\n#### 1. Find all movies rented by a specific customer within a given date range\n\nTo find all movies rented by a specific customer within a given date range, you can use the following query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT m.title, r.rental_date, r.return_date\nFROM Rentals r\nJOIN Movies m ON r.movie_id = m.movie_id\nWHERE r.customer_id = ?  -- Replace with specific customer_id\nAND r.rental_date BETWEEN ? AND ?;  -- Replace with date range\n```\n\n#### 2. Calculate the total revenue generated by a particular movie\n\nTo calculate the total revenue generated by a particular movie, you can use the following query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT m.title, SUM(p.amount) AS total_revenue\nFROM Payments p\nJOIN Rentals r ON p.rental_id = r.rental_id\nJOIN Movies m ON r.movie_id = m.movie_id\nWHERE m.movie_id = ?  -- Replace with specific movie_id\nGROUP BY m.title;\n```\n\n#### 3. Identify the top 10 most popular movies in terms of rental frequency\n\nTo identify the top 10 most popular movies based on rental frequency, you can use the following query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT m.title, COUNT(r.rental_id) AS rental_count\nFROM Rentals r\nJOIN Movies m ON r.movie_id = m.movie_id\nGROUP BY m.title\nORDER BY rental_count DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Find all movies rented by a specific customer within a given date range:**\n   - Join the `Rentals` table with the `Movies` table on `movie_id`.\n   - Filter by the specific `customer_id` and the rental dates within the given range.\n   - Select the movie titles along with rental and return dates.\n\n2. **Calculate the total revenue generated by a particular movie:**\n   - Join the `Payments` table with the `Rentals` table on `rental_id`, and then with the `Movies` table on `movie_id`.\n   - Filter by the specific `movie_id`.\n   - Sum the payment amounts for that movie.\n\n3. **Identify the top 10 most popular movies in terms of rental frequency:**\n   - Join the `Rentals` table with the `Movies` table on `movie_id`.\n   - Group by movie title and count the number of rentals for each movie.\n   - Order the results by rental count in descending order and limit to the top 10 movies.\n\nThis schema and the provided queries should effectively manage and query data for a movie rental system."
