        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains: one leaving Town A going towards Town B at 80 mph, and the other leaving Town B going towards Town A at 100 mph. The distance between the towns is 360 miles. I need to find out how long it will take for them to meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that since both trains are moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. So, the combined speed is 80 mph + 100 mph = 180 mph. This means that together, they are closing the distance between them at a rate of 180 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the total distance they need to cover before they meet is 360 miles. So, to find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 360 miles / 180 mph = 2 hours\n\nSo, it will take 2 hours for the trains to meet.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nLet's consider the position of each train over time. Let\u2019s denote the time in hours as t.\n\nThe distance covered by the train from Town A in time t is 80t miles.\n\nThe distance covered by the train from Town B in time t is 100t miles.\n\nWhen they meet, the sum of these distances should equal the total distance between the towns, which is 360 miles.\n\nSo, 80t + 100t = 360\n\nCombining like terms, 180t = 360\n\nNow, solving for t: t = 360 / 180 = 2 hours\n\nOkay, that matches my first answer.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe from the perspective of relative speed.\n\nIn relative speed, when two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds, which is again 180 mph. So, the time to meet would be the distance divided by the relative speed, which is 360 / 180 = 2 hours.\n\nAlright, every approach I take leads me to the same answer: 2 hours.\n\nI think this is confident. The trains will meet after 2 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
