        "content": "So the company makes 2000 products every day, and each product needs 15 minutes of labor time. I need to find out how many hours of labor the company needs daily. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should find out the total labor time in minutes for all the products. Since each product takes 15 minutes, and there are 2000 products, I can multiply 15 minutes by 2000. That should give me the total minutes of labor needed daily.\n\nSo, 15 minutes/product \u00d7 2000 products = 30,000 minutes.\n\nNow, I need to convert minutes into hours because the question asks for hours of labor. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so I should divide the total minutes by 60 to get hours.\n\nTherefore, 30,000 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes/hour = 500 hours.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nEach product requires 15 minutes.\n\nTotal products per day: 2000.\n\nTotal minutes: 15 \u00d7 2000 = 30,000 minutes.\n\nConvert to hours: 30,000 \u00f7 60 = 500 hours.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in another way. Maybe find out how many products can be made in an hour and then see how many hours are needed for 2000 products.\n\nFirst, find out how many minutes are in an hour: 60 minutes.\n\nEach product takes 15 minutes, so in 60 minutes, the number of products that can be made is 60 \u00f7 15 = 4 products per hour.\n\nNow, if the company makes 2000 products, and each hour they can make 4 products, then the total hours needed would be 2000 \u00f7 4 = 500 hours.\n\nOkay, this matches my previous calculation. So, the company requires 500 hours of labor daily.\n\nBut let me consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using rates or something.\n\nLet's see, labor time per product is 15 minutes, which is 15/60 = 0.25 hours per product.\n\nThen, for 2000 products, total labor hours would be 0.25 hours/product \u00d7 2000 products = 500 hours.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think this is straightforward. The company needs 500 hours of labor each day to produce 2000 products, given that each product requires 15 minutes of labor time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500} \\]"
