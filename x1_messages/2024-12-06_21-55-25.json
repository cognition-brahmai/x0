        "content": "Let's see. So, in this town, there are 100 houses in total. Out of these, 60 are blue houses, and all blue houses have red doors. That means the remaining houses must be green, and all green houses have yellow doors.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many houses are green. Since there are 100 houses in total and 60 of them are blue, the number of green houses would be:\n\n100 houses - 60 blue houses = 40 green houses\n\nNow, since all green houses have yellow doors, that means there are 40 houses with yellow doors.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. The question says: \"All the blue houses have red doors, and all the green houses have yellow doors.\" It doesn't mention any other colors, so presumably, all houses are either blue or green.\n\nGiven that, my calculation seems correct. There are 40 green houses, and all of them have yellow doors, so there are 40 houses with yellow doors.\n\nHowever, maybe there are houses that are neither blue nor green. But the problem says \"all the blue houses have red doors, and all the green houses have yellow doors,\" which suggests that there are only blue and green houses, but to be sure, perhaps I should consider the possibility of other colors.\n\nIf there are houses that are neither blue nor green, then those houses wouldn't fit into the categories given, and their door colors aren't specified. But since the problem doesn't mention any other colors, I think it's safe to assume that all houses are either blue or green.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some houses are both blue and green, but that seems unlikely. Probably, the houses are either blue or green.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial assumption, there are 40 green houses with yellow doors.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says \"all the blue houses have red doors, and all the green houses have yellow doors.\" It doesn't say that only blue houses have red doors or only green houses have yellow doors. Maybe there are other houses with red or yellow doors.\n\nBut based on the wording, it seems that blue houses have red doors, and green houses have yellow doors, implying that red doors are only for blue houses and yellow doors are only for green houses.\n\nIf that's the case, then the number of houses with yellow doors is equal to the number of green houses, which is 40.\n\nAlternatively, if other houses can have yellow doors, then the number could be higher, but the problem doesn't suggest that.\n\nGiven the information provided, I think the answer is 40 houses have yellow doors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
