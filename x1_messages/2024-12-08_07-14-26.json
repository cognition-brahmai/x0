        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company that starts with a monthly revenue of $50,000. Each month, their revenue increases by 10%. We need to find out what their total revenue will be for the first year.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 10% monthly increase means. If they make $50,000 in the first month, then in the second month, their revenue will be $50,000 plus 10% of $50,000. That sounds like compound growth, similar to how interest accrues in a bank account.\n\nSo, for the first month, revenue is $50,000.\n\nFor the second month, it's $50,000 + ($50,000 * 0.10) = $50,000 * 1.10.\n\nFor the third month, it's the second month's revenue plus 10%, which is ($50,000 * 1.10) * 1.10 = $50,000 * (1.10)^2.\n\nI see a pattern here. Each month, the revenue is the previous month's revenue multiplied by 1.10. So, for the nth month, the revenue would be $50,000 multiplied by 1.10 raised to the power of (n-1).\n\nSince we're looking at a year, that's 12 months. So, we need to calculate the revenue for each of the 12 months and then sum them up.\n\nAlternatively, this looks like a geometric series, where each term is multiplied by a common ratio, which in this case is 1.10.\n\nThe formula for the sum of a geometric series is:\n\nS = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)\n\nWhere:\n\n- S is the sum of the series\n\n- a is the first term\n\n- r is the common ratio\n\n- n is the number of terms\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- a = $50,000\n\n- r = 1.10\n\n- n = 12\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nS = 50,000 * (1.10^12 - 1) / (1.10 - 1)\n\nFirst, calculate 1.10^12.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\n1.10^1 = 1.10\n\n1.10^2 = 1.21\n\n1.10^3 = 1.331\n\n1.10^4 = 1.4641\n\n1.10^5 = 1.61051\n\n1.10^6 = 1.771561\n\n1.10^7 = 1.9487171\n\n1.10^8 = 2.14358881\n\n1.10^9 = 2.357947691\n\n1.10^10 = 2.5937424601\n\n1.10^11 = 2.85311670611\n\n1.10^12 = 3.138428376721\n\nSo, 1.10^12 is approximately 3.1384.\n\nNow, plug this back into the sum formula:\n\nS = 50,000 * (3.1384 - 1) / (1.10 - 1)\n\nS = 50,000 * (2.1384) / (0.10)\n\nS = 50,000 * 21.384\n\nS = $1,069,200\n\nSo, the total revenue for the first year would be approximately $1,069,200.\n\nBut let me double-check this calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirm the geometric series formula. Yes, S = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1) is correct for a geometric series.\n\nNext, verify 1.10^12. Using a calculator, 1.10^12 is approximately 3.138428376721, which seems correct.\n\nThen, S = 50,000 * (3.138428376721 - 1) / 0.10\n\n= 50,000 * 2.138428376721 / 0.10\n\n= 50,000 * 21.38428376721\n\n= 1,069,214.1883605\n\nRounded to the nearest dollar, it's $1,069,214.\n\nWait a minute, my initial calculation was $1,069,200, but now it's $1,069,214. There's a discrepancy of $14.\n\nPerhaps I made a rounding error earlier. Let me recalculate more precisely.\n\nFirst, compute 1.10^12 more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator, 1.10^12 = 3.138428376721000.\n\nThen, S = 50,000 * (3.138428376721 - 1) / 0.10\n\n= 50,000 * 2.138428376721 / 0.10\n\n= 50,000 * 21.38428376721\n\n= 1,069,214.1883605\n\nSo, the precise sum is approximately $1,069,214.\n\nTherefore, the total revenue for the first year would be around $1,069,214.\n\nAlternatively, to ensure accuracy, I can calculate the revenue for each month individually and sum them up.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nMonth 1: $50,000\n\nMonth 2: $50,000 * 1.10 = $55,000\n\nMonth 3: $55,000 * 1.10 = $60,500\n\nMonth 4: $60,500 * 1.10 = $66,550\n\nMonth 5: $66,550 * 1.10 = $73,205\n\nMonth 6: $73,205 * 1.10 = $80,525.50\n\nMonth 7: $80,525.50 * 1.10 = $88,578.05\n\nMonth 8: $88,578.05 * 1.10 = $97,435.855\n\nMonth 9: $97,435.855 * 1.10 = $107,179.4405\n\nMonth 10: $107,179.4405 * 1.10 = $117,897.38455\n\nMonth 11: $117,897.38455 * 1.10 = $129,687.123005\n\nMonth 12: $129,687.123005 * 1.10 = $142,655.8353055\n\nNow, sum all these amounts:\n\n$50,000 +\n\n$55,000 = $105,000\n\n$105,000 + $60,500 = $165,500\n\n$165,500 + $66,550 = $232,050\n\n$232,050 + $73,205 = $305,255\n\n$305,255 + $80,525.50 = $385,780.50\n\n$385,780.50 + $88,578.05 = $474,358.55\n\n$474,358.55 + $97,435.855 = $571,794.405\n\n$571,794.405 + $107,179.4405 = $678,973.8455\n\n$678,973.8455 + $117,897.38455 = $796,871.23005\n\n$796,871.23005 + $129,687.123005 = $926,558.353055\n\n$926,558.353055 + $142,655.8353055 = $1,069,214.1883605\n\nAgain, the total revenue sums up to approximately $1,069,214.\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation using the geometric series formula.\n\nTherefore, the total revenue for the first year would be about $1,069,214.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother method could be to use the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but adjusted for monthly contributions with compound interest.\n\nHowever, since the revenue is increasing by 10% each month starting from an initial amount, the geometric series approach is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, some might think to use the formula for compound interest, but that's typically for investments where the interest is added to the principal over time. In this case, since we're dealing with revenue amounts over discrete months, the geometric series is more directly applicable.\n\nIt's also important to note that the problem states the revenue increases by 10% each month, which is compound growth. If it were a fixed amount added each month, it would be linear growth, but here it's clearly exponential growth.\n\nSo, to summarize, using the geometric series formula or summing up each month's revenue individually both lead to the same conclusion: the total revenue for the first year is approximately $1,069,214.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is approximately $1,069,214.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1069214} \\]"
