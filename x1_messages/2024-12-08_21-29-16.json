Each step in your plan should have a corresponding evidence value that will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string which could be the user question, previous evidence values or both.\n\nHere are the tools you can use:\nWebSearch[input]: This tool allows users to search for information on the internet. The function doesn't directly answer the question; it finds a list of sites that may contain the answer.\nTextScraper[input]: This tool extracts text from one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links. Input is one or more links and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkExtractor[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nAIQA[input]: An artificial intelligence question answering model, useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What is the history of the Eiffel Tower and who were its main architects?"
