        "content": "Let's see here. So, three friends are splitting a $60 gift equally. But one of them has a $12 coupon that reduces the price. I need to figure out how much each friend pays after the coupon is applied.\n\nFirst, the original cost of the gift is $60. The coupon reduces this by $12, so the new total cost is $60 - $12 = $48.\n\nNow, this $48 needs to be split equally among the three friends. So, I should divide $48 by 3.\n\n$48 \u00f7 3 = $16.\n\nSo, each friend pays $16.\n\nWait a minute, is there something else I need to consider? Does the fact that one friend has the coupon affect how much each person pays? I don't think so, because the coupon is applied to the total price, and then the reduced price is split equally among all three friends.\n\nLet me double-check. The coupon reduces the total cost from $60 to $48. Then, $48 divided by 3 is indeed $16 per friend.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Each friend pays $16.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
