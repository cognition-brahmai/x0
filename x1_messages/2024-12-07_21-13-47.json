        "content": "So if 5 apples cost $3, then to find out how much 15 apples would cost, I can probably just multiply the cost by 3, right? Because 15 is three times 5. So, $3 times 3 is $9. Wait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I should calculate the price per apple first. So, if 5 apples are $3, then one apple would cost $3 divided by 5, which is $0.60. Then, 15 apples would cost 15 times $0.60, which is $9. Okay, that matches my first guess. So, it would cost $9 to buy 15 apples. But just to be sure, maybe I'll check it another way. If I use proportions, 5 apples is to $3 as 15 apples is to x dollars. So, 5/3 = 15/x. Wait, no, actually, it should be 5/3 = 15/x, but that doesn't seem right. Let me recall, in proportions, if a/b = c/d, then a*d = b*c. Maybe I should set it up as 5 apples cost $3, so 15 apples cost x dollars. So, 5/15 = 3/x. Wait, that doesn't seem right either. Let me think differently. If 5 apples cost $3, then 15 apples, which is three times more, should cost three times as much. So, 3 times $3 is $9. Yeah, that makes sense. Or, using the proportion, 5 apples is to 15 apples as $3 is to x dollars. So, 5/15 = 3/x. Then, cross-multiplying, 5x = 15*3, so 5x = 45, and x = 9. So, again, $9. Okay, I'm confident now. It would cost $9 to buy 15 apples."
