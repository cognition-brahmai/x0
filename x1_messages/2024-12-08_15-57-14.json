        "content": "Let's tackle this problem. So, the boy has $100 to spend on 100 animals at a pet store. The store sells dogs for $15 each, cats for $1 each, and rabbits for $0.25 each. He must buy at least one of each type of animal. We need to figure out how many of each animal he should buy to spend exactly $100.\n\nFirst, let's set up some variables to represent the number of each animal:\n\n- Let \\( d \\) be the number of dogs.\n\n- Let \\( c \\) be the number of cats.\n\n- Let \\( r \\) be the number of rabbits.\n\nWe have two main constraints here:\n\n1. The total number of animals is 100:\n\n\\[ d + c + r = 100 \\]\n\n2. The total cost is $100:\n\n\\[ 15d + 1c + 0.25r = 100 \\]\n\nAlso, we have the condition that \\( d \\geq 1 \\), \\( c \\geq 1 \\), and \\( r \\geq 1 \\).\n\nOkay, so we have two equations with three variables. This seems like we have one degree of freedom, meaning we can choose one variable and solve for the other two. But let's see if we can find integer solutions that satisfy both equations.\n\nFirst, to simplify the equations, maybe I can eliminate one of the variables. Let's try to express \\( r \\) in terms of \\( d \\) and \\( c \\) from the first equation:\n\n\\[ r = 100 - d - c \\]\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( r \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 15d + c + 0.25(100 - d - c) = 100 \\]\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n\\[ 15d + c + 25 - 0.25d - 0.25c = 100 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ (15d - 0.25d) + (c - 0.25c) + 25 = 100 \\]\n\n\\[ 14.75d + 0.75c + 25 = 100 \\]\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 14.75d + 0.75c = 75 \\]\n\nHmm, decimals are a bit messy. Maybe I can multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the decimals:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 14.75d = 59d \\]\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 0.75c = 3c \\]\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 75 = 300 \\]\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n\\[ 59d + 3c = 300 \\]\n\nThis looks better. Now, we need to find integer values for \\( d \\) and \\( c \\) that satisfy this equation, remembering that \\( d \\geq 1 \\), \\( c \\geq 1 \\), and \\( r = 100 - d - c \\geq 1 \\).\n\nSo, \\( d \\) and \\( c \\) have to be positive integers, and their sum must be less than 100.\n\nLet's try to solve for \\( c \\) in terms of \\( d \\):\n\n\\[ 3c = 300 - 59d \\]\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{300 - 59d}{3} \\]\n\nFor \\( c \\) to be an integer, \\( 300 - 59d \\) must be divisible by 3. That means \\( 300 - 59d \\) should be a multiple of 3.\n\nLet's check the divisibility:\n\n300 is divisible by 3, since 3 + 0 + 0 = 3, which is divisible by 3.\n\n59 is not divisible by 3, since 5 + 9 = 14, and 1 + 4 = 5, which is not divisible by 3.\n\nSo, \\( 300 - 59d \\) will be divisible by 3 if \\( 59d \\) leaves the same remainder as 300 when divided by 3.\n\nSince 300 is divisible by 3, we need \\( 59d \\) to be divisible by 3 as well.\n\nBut 59 is not divisible by 3, so \\( d \\) must be such that \\( 59d \\) is divisible by 3.\n\nAlternatively, since 59 mod 3 is 2 (because 5 + 9 = 14, 1 + 4 = 5, 5 mod 3 = 2), then \\( 59d \\) mod 3 is \\( 2d \\) mod 3.\n\nSo, \\( 2d \\) mod 3 must be 0, meaning \\( d \\) must be a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, no. If \\( 2d \\) is divisible by 3, then \\( d \\) must be such that 2d is a multiple of 3.\n\nSince 2 and 3 are coprime, this means \\( d \\) must be a multiple of 3.\n\nYes, so \\( d \\) must be a multiple of 3.\n\nLet's set \\( d = 3k \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive integer.\n\nNow, substitute \\( d = 3k \\) into the equation for \\( c \\):\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{300 - 59(3k)}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{300 - 177k}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ c = 100 - 59k \\]\n\nNow, since \\( c \\) must be at least 1:\n\n\\[ 100 - 59k \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 100 - 1 \\geq 59k \\]\n\n\\[ 99 \\geq 59k \\]\n\n\\[ k \\leq \\frac{99}{59} \\]\n\n\\[ k \\leq 1.678 \\]\n\nSince \\( k \\) must be a positive integer, the possible values for \\( k \\) are 1.\n\nSo, \\( k = 1 \\), which means \\( d = 3(1) = 3 \\).\n\nNow, \\( c = 100 - 59(1) = 41 \\).\n\nThen, \\( r = 100 - d - c = 100 - 3 - 41 = 56 \\).\n\nLet's check if this satisfies the cost equation:\n\n\\[ 15d + c + 0.25r = 15(3) + 41 + 0.25(56) = 45 + 41 + 14 = 100 \\]\n\nYes, it matches exactly.\n\nSo, the boy should buy 3 dogs, 41 cats, and 56 rabbits.\n\nWait a minute, is this the only solution? Let's see.\n\nEarlier, we found that \\( k \\leq 1.678 \\), and since \\( k \\) must be an integer, \\( k = 1 \\) is the only solution.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are other possible values for \\( k \\).\n\nIf \\( k = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ d = 3(2) = 6 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 100 - 59(2) = 100 - 118 = -18 \\]\n\nThis is not possible, since \\( c \\) cannot be negative.\n\nTherefore, \\( k = 1 \\) is the only possible solution.\n\nSo, the final answer is 3 dogs, 41 cats, and 56 rabbits.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ dogs}, 41 \\text{ cats}, 56 \\text{ rabbits}} \\]"
