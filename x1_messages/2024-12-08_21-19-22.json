        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a tree growing at an annual rate of 20%. The tree starts off as a sapling that's 2 meters tall, and I need to figure out how tall it will be after 5 years. Hmm, growth rates, percentages, time\u2014this seems like it might involve some exponential growth formula. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, what does it mean to grow at an annual rate of 20%? I think it means that each year, the tree increases its height by 20% of its height at the beginning of that year. So, it's not just adding a fixed amount each year, but the amount it grows each year depends on how tall it was at the start of that year.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Starting height is 2 meters. After the first year, it grows by 20% of 2 meters, which is 0.4 meters, so the new height would be 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 meters.\n\nNow, in the second year, it grows by 20% of 2.4 meters. 20% of 2.4 is 0.48 meters, so the height at the end of the second year would be 2.4 + 0.48 = 2.88 meters.\n\nContinuing this process for each of the 5 years seems tedious. Maybe there's a better way to calculate this without having to do it year by year.\n\nI recall that exponential growth can be modeled by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{final amount} = \\text{initial amount} \\times (1 + \\text{growth rate})^{\\text{time}} \\]\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is the starting height, which is 2 meters. The growth rate is 20%, which is 0.20 in decimal form. The time is 5 years.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{final height} = 2 \\times (1 + 0.20)^5 \\]\n\nLet me calculate that. First, 1 + 0.20 is 1.20. Then, 1.20 raised to the power of 5.\n\nI know that \\(1.2^2 = 1.44\\), and \\(1.2^3 = 1.728\\), and \\(1.2^4 = 2.0736\\), and \\(1.2^5 = 2.48832\\).\n\nSo, \\(2 \\times 2.48832 = 4.97664\\) meters.\n\nWait a minute, that seems pretty tall compared to the starting height. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting height: 2 meters.\n\nAfter year 1: 2 + 0.20*2 = 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 meters.\n\nAfter year 2: 2.4 + 0.20*2.4 = 2.4 + 0.48 = 2.88 meters.\n\nAfter year 3: 2.88 + 0.20*2.88 = 2.88 + 0.576 = 3.456 meters.\n\nAfter year 4: 3.456 + 0.20*3.456 = 3.456 + 0.6912 = 4.1472 meters.\n\nAfter year 5: 4.1472 + 0.20*4.1472 = 4.1472 + 0.82944 = 4.97664 meters.\n\nOkay, so both the step-by-step calculation and the exponential growth formula give me the same result: approximately 4.98 meters.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me make sure that the exponential growth formula is appropriate here. Exponential growth assumes that the growth rate is applied to the amount at the beginning of the period, which matches the description in the problem. So, yes, it's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as compound interest, where the principal is the initial height, the growth rate is the interest rate, and the time is the number of years. The formula is the same.\n\nSo, after 5 years, the sapling will be approximately 4.98 meters tall.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"after 5 years,\" and I've calculated it to be 4.97664 meters. Should I round it off? Maybe to two decimal places, which would be 4.98 meters.\n\nBut in real life, how precise is this growth rate? Trees don't grow at a constant percentage each year; growth can be affected by many factors like weather, soil quality, etc. But since this is a math problem, I'll stick with the formula.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using logarithms or some other method, but that seems unnecessary for this straightforward problem.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are correct. The initial height is in meters, and since no other units are mentioned, the final answer should also be in meters.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the growth is compounded annually. The problem says \"annual rate,\" so it's reasonable to assume that the growth is compounded once per year.\n\nIf the growth rate were compounded more frequently, like monthly, the final height would be slightly different, but based on the information given, annual compounding is appropriate.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the height of the tree after 5 years would be approximately 4.98 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4.98 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
