        "content": "Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that. Merge sort is an efficient, comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer approach. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to implementing merge sort in Python:\n\n1. **Understand the Algorithm**:\n   - **Divide**: Split the array into two halves.\n   - **Conquer**: Recursively sort the two halves.\n   - **Combine**: Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.\n\n2. **Base Case**:\n   - If the array has one or zero elements, it is already sorted.\n\n3. **Merge Function**:\n   - Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.\n\n4. **Implement the Merge Sort Function**:\n   - Recursively split the array and merge the sorted subarrays.\n\n5. **Take User Input**:\n   - Read a list of integers from the user.\n\n6. **Display the Sorted List**:\n   - Print the sorted list after performing merge sort.\n\nLet's write the code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement the merge sort algorithm in Python, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each part step by step. Here\u2019s a detailed explanation and the corresponding code:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Understand Merge Sort**:\n   - **Divide**: Split the array into two halves.\n   - **Conquer**: Recursively sort each half.\n   - **Combine**: Merge the two sorted halves back into a single sorted array.\n\n2. **Base Case**:\n   - If the array has zero or one element, it is already sorted.\n\n3. **Merge Function**:\n   - Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.\n\n4. **Merge Sort Function**:\n   - Recursively split the array and merge the sorted subarrays.\n\n5. **User Input**:\n   - Read a list of integers from the user.\n\n6. **Display Sorted List**:\n   - Print the sorted list after performing merge sort.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef merge(left, right):\n    \"\"\"Merge two sorted lists into one sorted list.\"\"\"\n    result = []\n    i = j = 0\n    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):\n        if left[i] < right[j]:\n            result.append(left[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            result.append(right[j])\n            j += 1\n    result.extend(left[i:])\n    result.extend(right[j:])\n    return result\n\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"Recursively split and merge the array.\"\"\"\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    mid = len(arr) // 2\n    left_half = merge_sort(arr[:mid])\n    right_half = merge_sort(arr[mid:])\n    return merge(left_half, right_half)\n\ndef main():\n    # Take input from the user\n    input_str = input(\"Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: \")\n    try:\n        nums = list(map(int, input_str.split()))\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Please enter valid integers.\")\n        return\n\n    # Perform merge sort\n    sorted_nums = merge_sort(nums)\n\n    # Display the sorted list\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_nums)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Merge Function**:\n   - Merges two sorted lists (`left` and `right`) into a single sorted list (`result`).\n   - Uses two pointers (`i` and `j`) to traverse the lists and append the smaller element to `result`.\n\n2. **Merge Sort Function**:\n   - Recursively splits the input list into two halves until each sub-list contains a single element.\n   - Conquers by sorting each sub-list (base case: single element is sorted).\n   - Combines the sorted sub-lists by merging them using the `merge` function.\n\n3. **Main Function**:\n   - Reads a list of integers from the user.\n   - Calls the `merge_sort` function to sort the list.\n   - Prints the sorted list.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the merge sort algorithm is correctly applied, providing a sorted list from the user's input."
