        "content": "So I've got this problem here: There's a pizza with a diameter of 16 inches, and it's cut into 8 equal slices. I need to find out what the area of one slice is. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that the area of a circle is given by the formula A equals pi times the radius squared, right? So, A = \u03c0r\u00b2. But here, I have a diameter of 16 inches, not the radius. Remember, the radius is half of the diameter, so r = d/2. That means the radius is 16 divided by 2, which is 8 inches.\n\nSo, plugging that into the formula, the area of the whole pizza is \u03c0 times 8 squared, which is \u03c0 times 64. So, A = 64\u03c0 square inches. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the pizza is cut into 8 equal slices. So, to find the area of one slice, I just need to take the total area and divide it by 8. So, area of one slice = 64\u03c0 / 8.\n\nLet's do the math: 64 divided by 8 is 8. So, the area of one slice is 8\u03c0 square inches.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Is there another way to approach this?\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the angle of each slice. Since the pizza is a circle, and it's divided into 8 equal slices, each slice would represent 360 degrees divided by 8, which is 45 degrees.\n\nSo, each slice is a sector of the circle with a central angle of 45 degrees. The area of a sector is given by (theta/360) times \u03c0r\u00b2, where theta is the central angle.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: (45/360) * \u03c0 * 8\u00b2 = (1/8) * \u03c0 * 64 = 8\u03c0 square inches.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, it seems like 8\u03c0 square inches is the correct area for one slice.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, does the thickness of the pizza affect the area of a slice? Well, area is a two-dimensional measurement, so thickness wouldn't affect it. Area is just length times width, and in this case, we're dealing with the top surface of the pizza.\n\nAlso, is there any information about the size of the crust or anything like that? The problem doesn't mention anything about crust, so I'm assuming it's a standard pizza where the entire circle is considered the pizza.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The area of one slice is definitely 8\u03c0 square inches.\n\nOh, and maybe I should consider if the answer needs to be in numerical terms or if leaving it in terms of \u03c0 is acceptable. The problem doesn't specify, so both options are possible.\n\nBut since the problem gives measurements in inches and doesn't specify to use a particular value for \u03c0, I'll leave the answer in terms of \u03c0.\n\nSo, the final answer is 8\u03c0 square inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8\\pi} \\]"
