        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a basket with 6 apples, 8 oranges, and 10 bananas. I need to find the probability of picking either an apple or a banana at random. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of fruits in the basket. There are 6 apples, 8 oranges, and 10 bananas. So, total fruits would be 6 + 8 + 10, which equals 24 fruits.\n\nNow, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either an apple or a banana.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of apples plus the number of bananas, which is 6 + 10, making 16.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be 16 (apples and bananas) divided by 24 (total fruits).\n\nBut I can simplify that fraction. Both 16 and 24 can be divided by 8.\n\n16 divided by 8 is 2, and 24 divided by 8 is 3. So, the simplified fraction is 2/3.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think about it another way.\n\nI know that the probability of mutually exclusive events can be added. Picking an apple and picking a banana are mutually exclusive events because you can't pick both at the same time in one pick.\n\nSo, the probability of picking an apple is 6/24, and the probability of picking a banana is 10/24. Adding these together should give me the total probability of picking either an apple or a banana.\n\nSo, 6/24 + 10/24 = 16/24, which again simplifies to 2/3.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation. But just to be thorough, maybe I can think in terms of percentages.\n\nSo, 16 out of 24 is what percentage? Well, 16 divided by 24 is approximately 0.6667, which is about 66.67%.\n\nSo, there's approximately a 66.67% chance of picking an apple or a banana.\n\nBut since the question asks for probability, it's better to express it as a fraction or a decimal. So, 2/3 or approximately 0.6667.\n\nWait, but in probability, we usually express it as a fraction in its simplest form, which is 2/3.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to approach this. Maybe using combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to pick an apple or a banana is the number of apples plus the number of bananas, which is 16.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick any fruit is 24.\n\nSo, the probability is indeed 16/24, which simplifies to 2/3.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of not picking an orange, since the only other options are apples and bananas.\n\nThere are 8 oranges out of 24 fruits, so the probability of picking an orange is 8/24, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not picking an orange (i.e., picking either an apple or a banana) is 1 - 1/3, which is 2/3.\n\nAgain, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, all these different approaches lead me back to 2/3.\n\nI feel confident about that.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's imagine actually picking fruits from the basket.\n\nIf I pick one fruit at random, there are 24 possible fruits I could pick.\n\nOut of those, 16 are either apples or bananas.\n\nSo, the chance that I pick one of those 16 is 16 out of 24, or 2/3.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here or anything I'm missing.\n\nSo, the probability is 2/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}} \\]"
