        "content": "So there are 10 people, and each one is voting on three different proposals. Each person can vote for or against each proposal independently. I need to find out how many possible outcomes there are for the votes on these three proposals.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. Each proposal can have two possible votes from each person: for or against. Since there are three proposals, and each person votes on each one independently, I need to figure out the total number of combinations of votes for all three proposals across all 10 people.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, consider one person. For each proposal, they have 2 choices: for or against. Since there are three proposals, the number of possible combinations of votes for one person is 2^3, which is 8.\n\nSo, one person can have 8 different combinations of votes for the three proposals.\n\nNow, there are 10 people, and each one can have any of those 8 combinations independently of the others.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible outcomes for all 10 people is 8^10.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it this way: each proposal is independent, and for each proposal, there are 10 people each making a binary choice.\n\nSo, for one proposal, the number of possible outcomes is 2^10, which is 1024.\n\nSince there are three proposals, and they are independent, the total number of possible outcomes should be (2^10)^3, which is 1024^3.\n\nBut wait, that seems different from my previous calculation.\n\nHold on, there must be a mistake here.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf I consider each proposal separately, for proposal A, there are 2^10 = 1024 possible combinations of votes from the 10 people.\n\nSimilarly for proposal B and proposal C.\n\nSince the proposals are independent, the total number of possible outcomes for all three proposals should be the product of the possible outcomes for each proposal.\n\nSo, total outcomes = outcomes for A * outcomes for B * outcomes for C = 1024 * 1024 * 1024 = 1024^3.\n\nBut earlier, I thought of it as each person having 8 possible combinations of votes for the three proposals, and then raising that to the power of 10: 8^10.\n\nBut 8^10 is not equal to 1024^3.\n\nWait, let's calculate both to see.\n\n8^10 = (2^3)^10 = 2^30.\n\n1024^3 = (2^10)^3 = 2^30.\n\nOh, they are actually the same!\n\nSo, 8^10 = 1024^3 = 2^30.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible outcomes is 2^30.\n\nBut to be more precise, let's calculate 2^30.\n\n2^10 = 1024.\n\n2^20 = 1024^2 = 1,048,576.\n\n2^30 = 1024 * 1,048,576 = 1,073,741,824.\n\nSo, there are 1,073,741,824 possible outcomes for the votes on the three proposals.\n\nBut let me confirm if this is the correct approach.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each of the 10 people is voting on each of the 3 proposals independently, with 2 choices for each vote.\n\nSo, total possible outcomes = number of ways all people can vote on all proposals.\n\nSince each person's votes on the three proposals are independent, and the people are independent of each other, the total number of possible outcomes is indeed 2^30.\n\nAlternatively, since there are 10 people and 3 proposals, that's a total of 30 individual votes, each with 2 possibilities: for or against.\n\nTherefore, total possible outcomes = 2^30 = 1,073,741,824.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1,073,741,824 possible outcomes for the votes on the three proposals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1073741824} \\]"
