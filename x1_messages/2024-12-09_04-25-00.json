        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python script that connects to a Memcached server, stores some key-value pairs, and then retrieves values based on keys. And, it should take the Memcached server's IP address and port number from the command line. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst things first, I need to make sure I have Memcached installed and running somewhere so I can test this script. Assume that the Memcached server is already set up and running on the specified IP and port.\n\nNow, for Python to interact with Memcached, I probably need a library that allows this connection. I recall there's a library called \"pymemcache\" that can be used for this purpose. So, I should probably install that using pip.\n\nLet me first create a new Python file, maybe call it \"memcached_client.py\" or something like that.\n\nNext, I need to accept command-line arguments for the IP address and port number. In Python, I can use the \"argparse\" module to handle command-line arguments. It's straightforward to set up.\n\nSo, I'll import argparse and set up the argument parser to expect two arguments: one for the IP address and one for the port number.\n\nOnce I have the IP and port, I can proceed to connect to the Memcached server using pymemcache.\n\nI need to install pymemcache. I can do this by running \"pip install pymemcache\" in my environment.\n\nAlright, assuming I have pymemcache installed, I can import the Client class from pymemcache.client.base.\n\nThen, I can create an instance of the Client class, passing the server's address and port.\n\nFor storing key-value pairs, Memcached typically deals with string values, so I'll have to make sure that the values are strings or can be easily converted to strings.\n\nMaybe I can hardcode some key-value pairs in the script for testing purposes. For example, store keys like \"name\" with value \"John\", \"age\" with value \"30\", etc.\n\nAfter storing some key-value pairs, I can retrieve them back using the keys and print out the retrieved values to verify that everything works correctly.\n\nAlso, it's a good practice to close the connection to the Memcached server once we're done.\n\nLet me think about error handling as well. What if the Memcached server is not running or not accessible at the specified IP and port? I should handle such scenarios gracefully, maybe by catching exceptions and printing a user-friendly error message.\n\nAdditionally, I should validate the command-line arguments to make sure that the IP address is in the correct format and the port number is a valid integer.\n\nWait, with argparse, I can specify the type of arguments, so for the port, I can set it to accept only integers.\n\nFor the IP address, I can keep it as a string, but maybe add some validation to ensure it's a valid IP address.\n\nBut to keep it simple, maybe I'll just assume that the user enters a valid IP address and port number.\n\nIf something is wrong with the arguments or the connection, pymemcache should raise an exception, which I can catch and handle.\n\nAlright, let's start writing some code.\n\nFirst, import the necessary modules:\n\nimport argparse\n\nfrom pymemcache.client.base import Client\n\nThen, set up the argument parser:\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Memcached Client')\n\nparser.add_argument('ip', type=str, help='Memcached server IP address')\n\nparser.add_argument('port', type=int, help='Memcached server port number')\n\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n\nSo, the user needs to provide the IP and port as command-line arguments.\n\nNext, try to connect to the Memcached server:\n\ntry:\n\nclient = Client((args.ip, args.port))\n\nprint(\"Connected to Memcached server\")\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n\nprint(f\"Error connecting to Memcached server: {e}\")\n\nexit(1)\n\nIf the connection is successful, print a message; otherwise, catch the exception and print an error message, then exit the script.\n\nAssuming the connection is successful, proceed to store some key-value pairs.\n\nLet's define a dictionary with some key-value pairs:\n\ndata = {\n\n'key1': 'value1',\n\n'key2': 'value2',\n\n'key3': 'value3'\n\n}\n\nThen, iterate over the dictionary and set each key-value pair in Memcached:\n\nfor key, value in data.items():\n\nclient.set(key, value)\n\nprint(f\"Stored {key}: {value}\")\n\nAfter storing the values, maybe retrieve them back to verify:\n\nfor key in data.keys():\n\nvalue = client.get(key)\n\nprint(f\"Retrieved {key}: {value.decode() if value else 'None'}\")\n\nWait, Memcached stores values as bytes, so when retrieving, I need to decode them to strings.\n\nAlso, check if the value is None in case the key doesn't exist.\n\nFinally, close the connection:\n\nclient.close()\n\nprint(\"Connection closed\")\n\nThat should be it.\n\nLet me think about adding some more features or making it more interactive.\n\nMaybe allow the user to specify key-value pairs via command-line arguments or read from a file.\n\nBut for now, keeping it simple with hardcoded key-value pairs is fine.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of Memcached not being able to store a key-value pair, although pymemcache should handle that.\n\nMaybe add some error checking after setting each key-value pair.\n\nFor example, check if the set operation was successful.\n\nBut pymemcache's set method returns None if successful, so I can check for that.\n\nWait, according to the pymemcache documentation, the set method returns True if the operation was successful, otherwise False.\n\nSo, I can check the return value and print a message accordingly.\n\nLet me adjust the code:\n\nfor key, value in data.items():\n\nsuccess = client.set(key, value)\n\nif success:\n\nprint(f\"Stored {key}: {value}\")\n\nelse:\n\nprint(f\"Failed to store {key}\")\n\nSimilarly, when retrieving, if the value is None, print a message indicating that the key was not found.\n\nAlso, ensure that the keys and values are strings, as Memcached handles strings.\n\nIf I want to store non-string data, I might need to serialize it first, but for simplicity, let's stick with strings.\n\nAlright, now, to test this script, I need to have Memcached running on a specific IP and port.\n\nAssuming Memcached is running on localhost at port 11211, which is the default.\n\nSo, I can run the script like this:\n\npython memcached_client.py 127.0.0.1 11211\n\nThe script should connect to the Memcached server, store the key-value pairs, retrieve them, and then close the connection.\n\nIf everything works correctly, I should see messages indicating successful connection, storage, retrieval, and disconnection.\n\nIf there are any issues, such as Memcached not running or incorrect IP/port, the script should catch the exception and print an error message.\n\nAlso, if there are issues with storing or retrieving, it should be handled appropriately.\n\nI think this covers the basic requirements.\n\nMaybe I can add some more error handling or make it more flexible, but for now, this should suffice.\n\nLet me write the complete code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Python script that connects to a Memcached server, stores key-value pairs, and retrieves values based on keys, you can follow the steps below. This script uses the `pymemcache` library and accepts the Memcached server's IP address and port number as command-line arguments.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport argparse\nfrom pymemcache.client.base import Client\n\ndef main():\n    # Set up argument parser\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Memcached Client')\n    parser.add_argument('ip', type=str, help='Memcached server IP address')\n    parser.add_argument('port', type=int, help='Memcached server port number')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Connect to Memcached server\n    try:\n        client = Client((args.ip, args.port))\n        print(\"Connected to Memcached server\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error connecting to Memcached server: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # Data to store\n    data = {\n        'key1': 'value1',\n        'key2': 'value2',\n        'key3': 'value3'\n    }\n\n    # Store key-value pairs\n    for key, value in data.items():\n        success = client.set(key, value)\n        if success:\n            print(f\"Stored {key}: {value}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Failed to store {key}\")\n\n    # Retrieve key-value pairs\n    for key in data.keys():\n        value = client.get(key)\n        print(f\"Retrieved {key}: {value.decode() if value else 'None'}\")\n\n    # Close the connection\n    client.close()\n    print(\"Connection closed\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Argument Parsing**:\n   - The script uses the `argparse` module to accept the Memcached server's IP address and port number from the command line.\n\n2. **Connecting to Memcached**:\n   - It uses the `pymemcache` library to connect to the Memcached server with the provided IP and port.\n   - If the connection fails, it catches the exception and prints an error message.\n\n3. **Storing Key-Value Pairs**:\n   - It defines a dictionary of key-value pairs to store in Memcached.\n   - It iterates over the dictionary, storing each pair in Memcached and printing the result of each operation.\n\n4. **Retrieving Key-Value Pairs**:\n   - It retrieves each value from Memcached using the keys and prints the retrieved values.\n   - Values are decoded from bytes to strings for display.\n\n5. **Closing the Connection**:\n   - It closes the connection to the Memcached server and prints a confirmation message.\n\nThis script provides a basic demonstration of interacting with a Memcached server using Python, handling both storage and retrieval operations."
