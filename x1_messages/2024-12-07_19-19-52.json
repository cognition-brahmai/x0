        "content": "So I have this problem here: a train takes 4 hours to travel between two cities with an average speed of 75 miles per hour. I need to find out the distance between the two cities. Hmm, I remember that distance, speed, and time are related, but I'm not sure exactly how. Maybe there's a formula that connects these three things.\n\nLet me think about it. I know that speed is probably related to how fast something is moving, and time is how long it takes to travel a certain distance. So, if the train is moving at an average speed of 75 miles per hour for 4 hours, I should be able to calculate the total distance it covers.\n\nWait a minute, I think the formula is distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, distance = speed \u00d7 time. Does that make sense? Let's see, if I go 50 miles per hour for 2 hours, I should cover 100 miles. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo, in this case, the speed is 75 miles per hour and the time is 4 hours. So, distance should be 75 multiplied by 4. Let me do the math: 75 times 4 is 300. So, the distance between the two cities is 300 miles.\n\nBut, just to make sure, maybe I should consider if there's anything else I need to account for. Is the train's speed constant, or is it averaging 75 miles per hour? The problem says \"average speed,\" so maybe the train was going faster at times and slower at other times, but on average, it's 75 miles per hour. But since it's average speed, and I'm given the total time, I think using the formula distance = average speed \u00d7 time should give me the correct distance.\n\nLet me double-check. If the train was going sometimes faster and sometimes slower, as long as the average over the whole journey is 75 miles per hour for 4 hours, the total distance should still be 300 miles. I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for speed, which is speed = distance divided by time. If I rearrange that, I get distance = speed \u00d7 time, which is the same formula I thought of earlier. So, that reinforces my idea.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I should consider units. The speed is in miles per hour, and time is in hours, so when I multiply them, the hours cancel out, and I'm left with miles, which is the unit for distance. That makes sense.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. Here, speed is in miles per hour and time is in hours, so no conversion is needed. If there were different units, I'd have to convert them to match, but in this case, it's all good.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor that might affect the distance, like stops or something, but the problem doesn't mention any stops, so I can assume the train is moving for the entire 4 hours, except maybe for brief stops which might be included in the total time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the definition of average speed. Average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, if I have average speed and total time, then distance is average speed multiplied by time. Yeah, that matches what I thought earlier.\n\nLet me try to calculate it again to be sure. 75 miles per hour times 4 hours equals 300 miles. Yeah, that seems straightforward.\n\nMaybe I can think of another way to approach this problem. For example, if I were to plot a graph of speed versus time, the area under the curve would give me the distance. But since the speed is constant at 75 miles per hour, the graph would be a horizontal line, and the area would be a rectangle: width is 4 hours, height is 75 miles per hour, and the area is again 300 miles. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that in each hour, the train covers 75 miles, then in 4 hours, it would cover 4 times 75, which is 300 miles. Same answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. Distance is 300 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
