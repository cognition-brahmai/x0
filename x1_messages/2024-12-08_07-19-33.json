Its location above the Earth's atmosphere allows it to capture images that are much clearer than those from ground-based telescopes. The telescope's data has significantly contributed to our understanding of the universe, including the rate of its expansion.

        "content": "Let's see. So, the Hubble Space Telescope is up in space, and because it's above Earth's atmosphere, it can take really clear pictures of things in space, like galaxies and stars. Ground-based telescopes are on Earth, right? So, I guess the main difference is that Hubble isn't affected by Earth's atmosphere, whereas ground-based telescopes are.\n\nI remember that Earth's atmosphere can cause light from space to bend or blur as it passes through. That's why stars seem to twinkle in the night sky. So, maybe that's a problem for ground-based telescopes. They have to look through all that air, and it can distort the images they capture.\n\nOption A says that ground-based techniques can't observe distant galaxies. But that doesn't sound right because we have some really big telescopes on Earth that have observed very distant galaxies. It's just that the images might not be as sharp as Hubble's.\n\nOption B says they can't capture images of stars. That's definitely not true because we've been observing stars from Earth for centuries.\n\nOption C is about atmospheric distortion affecting them. That seems plausible because of what I just thought about the atmosphere causing blurring.\n\nOption D says they can't contribute to our understanding of the universe. That can't be right because almost all of our astronomical knowledge was gained using ground-based telescopes before Hubble was launched.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the best answer is C: ground-based observational techniques are affected by atmospheric distortion. This makes sense because even though they can observe distant galaxies and stars, the quality of the images might not be as good as those from space telescopes like Hubble.\n\nBut, I also know that there are techniques now, like adaptive optics, that help ground-based telescopes compensate for atmospheric distortion. So, maybe in the future, this limitation will be less of an issue.\n\nStill, given the options, C seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
