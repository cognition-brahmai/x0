        "content": "That sounds delicious! So, you're thinking about an Italian dish that's made from thinly sliced raw meat or fish, and it's usually served as an appetizer. Hmm, let me think about this.\n\nI know that in Italy, there are various regional cuisines, and many of them feature raw meats or fish in some form. For example, in the northern parts of Italy, there's a dish called \"carnaroli,\" but that's actually a type of rice used in risotto. Not quite what we're looking for.\n\nWait, maybe it's \"prosciutto crudo.\" That's cured ham that's raw but safely consumable. It's often served thinly sliced, maybe with some melon or other accompaniments. But I'm not sure if that's exactly what you're thinking of.\n\nAnother possibility is \" carpaccio.\" I've heard of beef carpaccio, which is raw beef that's been beaten to tenderize it and then sliced thin. It's often served with a mustard sauce or some other dressing. I think carpaccio can also be made with fish, like raw tuna or salmon.\n\nSo, could it be carpaccio? It seems to fit the description: thinly sliced raw meat or fish, served as an appetizer. Maybe that's the one.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there another Italian dish that matches this description? Maybe something like \"ibiola,\" but I'm not familiar with that term.\n\nWait, perhaps it's \"sashimi,\" but that's a Japanese dish, not Italian. So, that can't be it.\n\nLet me try to recall. I remember watching a cooking show where they were making an appetizer with raw fish, maybe tuna, sliced paper-thin and arranged artfully on a plate with some citrus zest and maybe a drizzle of olive oil. That does sound Italian.\n\nYes, that must be carpaccio. It makes sense. So, to answer your question, the Italian dish consisting of thinly sliced raw meat or fish, typically served as an appetizer, is called \"carpaccio.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{carpaccio}} \\]"
