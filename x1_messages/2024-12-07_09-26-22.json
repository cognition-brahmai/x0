        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let me see if I can figure this out. There's a box with 5 red balls, 7 blue balls, and 3 green balls. So, total balls in the box are 5 + 7 + 3, which is 15 balls.\n\nI need to find the probability of drawing exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball when I draw 3 balls at random without replacement. Okay, so without replacement means once I draw a ball, it stays out of the box.\n\nFirst, I think I need to find the total number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 15. That should be the combination of 15 things taken 3 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, total ways to choose 3 balls from 15 is C(15, 3). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(15, 3) = 15! / (3! * (15 - 3)!) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 455.\n\nAlright, so there are 455 different ways to draw 3 balls from 15.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to get exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball. There are 5 red balls and 7 blue balls.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red balls from 5 is C(5, 2), and the number of ways to choose 1 blue ball from 7 is C(7, 1).\n\nLet me calculate those:\n\nC(5, 2) = (5 \u00d7 4) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 10.\n\nC(7, 1) = 7.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 2 red balls and 1 blue ball is 10 \u00d7 7 = 70.\n\nNow, to find the probability, I need to divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability P = number of favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 70 / 455.\n\nLet me simplify that fraction:\n\n70 \u00f7 35 = 2, and 455 \u00f7 35 = 13, so 70/455 = 2/13.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 2/13.\n\nWait a minute, but I think I should consider whether the order in which I draw the balls matters. In probability problems, sometimes order matters, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nIn this case, since we're drawing without replacement and we're interested in the combination of balls, not the order, it should be fine to use combinations.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this using permutations, but it should give the same result.\n\nLet me verify this another way. Maybe using probabilities step by step.\n\nFirst draw: probability of drawing a red ball is 5/15.\n\nAfter drawing one red ball, there are now 4 red balls left and 14 balls in total.\n\nSecond draw: probability of drawing another red ball is 4/14.\n\nNow, there are 3 red balls and 7 blue balls left, total 13 balls.\n\nThird draw: probability of drawing a blue ball is 7/13.\n\nSo, the probability of this sequence: red, red, blue is (5/15) \u00d7 (4/14) \u00d7 (7/13).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n(5/15) = 1/3\n\n(4/14) = 2/7\n\n(7/13) = 7/13\n\nSo, (1/3) \u00d7 (2/7) \u00d7 (7/13) = (1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 7) / (3 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 13) = 14 / 273 = 2/39.\n\nBut wait, this is just one possible sequence. The red balls can be drawn first and second, or first and third, or second and third. So, I need to consider all possible sequences where exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball are drawn.\n\nThe possible sequences are:\n\n1. Red, Red, Blue\n\n2. Red, Blue, Red\n\n3. Blue, Red, Red\n\nI need to calculate the probability for each sequence and then add them up.\n\nLet's do that.\n\nFirst sequence: Red, Red, Blue\n\nProbability: (5/15) \u00d7 (4/14) \u00d7 (7/13) = 2/39, as calculated earlier.\n\nSecond sequence: Red, Blue, Red\n\nProbability: (5/15) \u00d7 (7/14) \u00d7 (4/13)\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n(5/15) = 1/3\n\n(7/14) = 1/2\n\n(4/13) = 4/13\n\nSo, (1/3) \u00d7 (1/2) \u00d7 (4/13) = (1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 4) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 13) = 4 / 78 = 2/39.\n\nThird sequence: Blue, Red, Red\n\nProbability: (7/15) \u00d7 (5/14) \u00d7 (4/13)\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n(7/15)\n\n(5/14)\n\n(4/13)\n\nSo, (7/15) \u00d7 (5/14) \u00d7 (4/13) = (7 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4) / (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13) = 140 / 2730.\n\nSimplify that:\n\n140 \u00f7 70 = 2, and 2730 \u00f7 70 = 39, so 2/39.\n\nSo, each sequence has a probability of 2/39.\n\nSince there are 3 such sequences, total probability is 3 \u00d7 (2/39) = 6/39 = 2/13.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier result from using combinations.\n\nSo, the probability is 2/13.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should confirm that there are no other ways to get exactly 2 red and 1 blue ball, and that I've considered all possible sequences.\n\nYes, I think that's all. There are no other sequences possible for exactly 2 red and 1 blue ball in 3 draws.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2/13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{13}} \\]"
