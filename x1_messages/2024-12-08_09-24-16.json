        "content": "Certainly! Below is a simple Java program that creates a basic command-line chatbot. This chatbot greets the user, responds to specific keywords, and exits when the user types \"bye\" or \"exit\".\n\nFirst, make sure you have Java installed on your computer. You can download it from [oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) if you don't have it already.\n\nNow, let's write the code step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Project\n\nCreate a new Java file named `Chatbot.java`.\n\n### Step 2: Import Necessary Packages\n\nWe need to import `java.util.Scanner` to read user inputs.\n\n### Step 3: Create the Main Class and Method\n\nDefine the `Chatbot` class with the `main` method.\n\n### Step 4: Greet the User\n\nPrint a greeting message when the program starts.\n\n### Step 5: Read User Inputs\n\nUse a loop to continuously read user inputs until the user types \"bye\" or \"exit\".\n\n### Step 6: Respond to Specific Keywords\n\nCheck the user's input for specific keywords and respond accordingly.\n\n### Step 7: Exit the Program\n\nIf the user types \"bye\" or \"exit\", print a farewell message and terminate the program.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Chatbot {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Create a Scanner object to read user inputs\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        // Greet the user\n        System.out.println(\"Hello! I'm your basic chatbot. Type 'bye' or 'exit' to end the conversation.\");\n\n        // Loop to continue the conversation until the user types 'bye' or 'exit'\n        while (true) {\n            // Read user input\n            System.out.print(\"You: \");\n            String input = scanner.nextLine().toLowerCase();\n\n            // Check for exit commands\n            if (input.equals(\"bye\") || input.equals(\"exit\")) {\n                System.out.println(\"Chatbot: Goodbye!\");\n                break;\n            }\n\n            // Respond based on specific keywords\n            if (input.contains(\"hello\")) {\n                System.out.println(\"Chatbot: Hello there!\");\n            } else if (input.contains(\"how are you\")) {\n                System.out.println(\"Chatbot: I'm just a bot, but I'm here to help you!\");\n            } else if (input.contains(\"what's your name\")) {\n                System.out.println(\"Chatbot: I'm a basic chatbot.\");\n            } else if (input.contains(\"help\")) {\n                System.out.println(\"Chatbot: I can answer simple questions. Try asking about myself or say hello.\");\n            } else {\n                System.out.println(\"Chatbot: I'm not sure how to respond to that.\");\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Close the scanner\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Importing Scanner:** We use `Scanner` to read user inputs from the command line.\n2. **Greeting the User:** A initial message is printed to greet the user and inform them how to exit.\n3. **Reading Inputs in a Loop:** We use a `while (true)` loop to keep reading inputs until the user decides to exit.\n4. **Checking for Exit Commands:** If the user types \"bye\" or \"exit\", we print a farewell message and break out of the loop.\n5. **Responding to Keywords:** We check if the user's input contains certain keywords and respond accordingly.\n6. **Default Response:** If no keywords are matched, we provide a default response.\n\n### How to Run:\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `Chatbot.java`.\n2. Open a command prompt or terminal.\n3. Navigate to the directory containing `Chatbot.java`.\n4. Compile the Java file by running:\n   ```sh\n   javac Chatbot.java\n   ```\n5. Run the compiled program:\n   ```sh\n   java Chatbot\n   ```\n\nNow you can interact with the chatbot by typing messages and seeing its responses based on the predefined keywords."
