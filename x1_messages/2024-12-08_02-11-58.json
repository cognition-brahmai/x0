        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangle. It says the rectangle has a length of 12 cm and a width of 8 cm. I need to find the area of the rectangle, and then find out what the new area would be if both the length and the width were doubled. Okay, let's start with the first part.\n\nI know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, area equals length times width. In this case, the length is 12 cm and the width is 8 cm. So, area equals 12 cm times 8 cm. Let me do the multiplication: 12 times 8 is 96. So, the area is 96 square centimeters.\n\nNow, for the second part, I need to find the new area if both dimensions are doubled. Doubling the length means the new length is 12 cm times 2, which is 24 cm. Doubling the width means the new width is 8 cm times 2, which is 16 cm. So, the new area would be the new length times the new width, which is 24 cm times 16 cm.\n\nLet me calculate that. 24 times 16. I can break it down: 20 times 16 is 320, and 4 times 16 is 64. Adding those together, 320 plus 64 equals 384. So, the new area is 384 square centimeters.\n\nWait a minute, is there a shorter way to think about this? If both dimensions are doubled, the area should be quadrupled because area is a two-dimensional measurement. Let me check: the original area is 96 square centimeters, and quadrupling that would be 96 times 4, which is 384 square centimeters. Yeah, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, to summarize, the original area is 96 square centimeters, and the new area after doubling both dimensions is 384 square centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe original area of the rectangle is \\boxed{96 \\text{ square centimeters}}, and the new area after doubling both dimensions is \\boxed{384 \\text{ square centimeters}}."
