        "content": "So, if a car gets 30 miles per gallon and has a 12-gallon fuel tank, to find out how many miles it can travel on a full tank, you just need to multiply the miles per gallon by the number of gallons in the tank.\n\nSo, that would be 30 miles/gallon times 12 gallons. The gallons unit cancels out, leaving you with miles.\n\nSo, 30 times 12 is 360.\n\nTherefore, the car can travel 360 miles on a full tank.\n\nBut wait, is there anything else to consider? Like, is the fuel tank capacity always exactly full, or is there sometimes a reserve? Hmm, but the question says \"a full tank,\" so I think 360 miles is the answer.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
