The net profit is the additional revenue generated minus the cost of the advertising.\n\nGiven:\n- Additional revenue generated: $50,000\n- Cost of advertising: $5,000\n\nSo, the net profit is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit} = \\$50,000 - \\$5,000 = \\$45,000 \\]\n\nNext, we plug the net profit and the cost of investment into the ROI formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROI} = \\left( \\frac{\\$45,000}{\\$5,000} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nNow, perform the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\$45,000}{\\$5,000} = 9 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100% to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 9 \\times 100\\% = 900\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the return on investment (ROI) percentage for the advertising campaign is 900%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{900\\%} \\]"
