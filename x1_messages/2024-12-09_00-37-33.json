        "content": "In the depths where sunlight dares not tread,\nLies a city, forgotten, yet not dead.\nOnce it thrived, a beacon of mankind,\nNow, underwater, its story unwinds.\n\nTowers that reached for the heavens high,\nNow cradled by the ocean's lullaby.\nStreets that echoed with laughter and cries,\nNow silent, save for the fish that glide.\n\nLibraries that held wisdom's weight,\nTheir pages now nibbled by time's relentless wait.\nMarkets that bustled with life so bright,\nNow only moonlit shadows take flight.\n\nTemples where gods were worshipped with zeal,\nNow coral gardens, a new realm to reel.\nPalaces where kings and queens did reign,\nNow homes to schools of fish, in aquatic domain.\n\nFountains that sang with crystal spray,\nNow swallowed by the tide's endless display.\nTheatres that hosted plays of old,\nNow stage for seaweed's dance, young and bold.\n\nYet, in the hearts of those who dare to dream,\nThis city lives, a legend, a supreme.\nThrough myths and tales, it finds its voice,\nA testament to humanity's choice.\n\nTo build, to dream, to rise and fall,\nFor in the end, all empires must enthrall.\nThe ocean's embrace, a final repose,\nFor a city forgotten, yet forever composed.\n\nSo dive deep, if you dare, into the blue abyss,\nWhere history whispers in the language of the fish.\nFeel the pulse of a civilization past,\nIn the forgotten city, now nature's masterpiece, at last."
