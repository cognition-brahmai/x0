        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a triangle with sides of lengths 13, 14, and 15, and I need to find its area. Hmm, I remember there's a formula for finding the area of a triangle when you know all three sides, but I can't recall it off the top of my head. I think it's something called Heron's formula. Let me look that up.\n\nOkay, Heron's formula says that the area of a triangle with sides of length a, b, and c is square root of [s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle. The semi-perimeter is half of the perimeter, so s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo first, I need to calculate the semi-perimeter. Let's plug in the side lengths: a = 13, b = 14, c = 15.\n\ns = (13 + 14 + 15)/2 = 42/2 = 21.\n\nAlright, now plug s, a, b, and c into Heron's formula:\n\nArea = sqrt[21(21 - 13)(21 - 14)(21 - 15)] = sqrt[21 * 8 * 7 * 6].\n\nLet me calculate inside the square root:\n\n21 * 8 = 168\n\n168 * 7 = 1176\n\n1176 * 6 = 7056\n\nSo, area = sqrt[7056].\n\nNow, what's the square root of 7056? I know that 84 squared is 7056 because 80 squared is 6400 and 4 squared is 16, and the cross terms give 6400 + 640 + 640 + 16 = 7056. So, area = 84.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to find the area of this triangle? Maybe using base and height? For example, if I take the base as 14, can I find the height?\n\nTo find the height, I would need to use the Pythagorean theorem. Let's see, if I have a triangle with sides 13, 14, and 15, and I take the base as 14, then I can split the base into two parts using the height, say x and 14 - x.\n\nSo, from the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nheight\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 => height\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 169\n\nheight\u00b2 + (14 - x)\u00b2 = 15\u00b2 => height\u00b2 + (14 - x)\u00b2 = 225\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(14 - x)\u00b2 - x\u00b2 = 225 - 169 => 196 - 28x + x\u00b2 - x\u00b2 = 56 => 196 - 28x = 56 => -28x = -140 => x = 5\n\nNow, plug x back into the first equation:\n\nheight\u00b2 + 25 = 169 => height\u00b2 = 144 => height = 12\n\nSo, area = (base * height)/2 = (14 * 12)/2 = 84.\n\nOkay, that matches what I got using Heron's formula. Good to see consistency.\n\nIs there another method I can use to verify this? Maybe using trigonometry? For example, using the law of cosines to find one of the angles and then using the formula (1/2)ab sin(C).\n\nLet's try that. First, find one of the angles. Let's find the angle opposite the side of length 14, which we'll call angle A.\n\nBy the law of cosines:\n\ncos A = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/(2bc) = (13\u00b2 + 15\u00b2 - 14\u00b2)/(2*13*15) = (169 + 225 - 196)/(390) = (198)/(390) = 33/65.\n\nSo, angle A is arccos(33/65). Now, sin A = sqrt(1 - cos\u00b2 A) = sqrt(1 - (33/65)\u00b2) = sqrt(1 - 1089/4225) = sqrt(3136/4225) = 56/65.\n\nTherefore, area = (1/2) * b * c * sin A = (1/2) * 13 * 15 * (56/65) = (1/2) * 13 * 15 * (56/65).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, 13 * 15 = 195\n\n195 * 56 = 10800\n\n10800 / 65 = 166.153846... Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, 13 and 65 can both be divided by 13: 13/13 = 1, 65/13 = 5.\n\nSo, (1/2) * 13 * 15 * (56/65) = (1/2) * 1 * 15 * 56 / 5 = (1/2) * 15 * 56 / 5 = (1/2) * 3 * 56 = (1/2) * 168 = 84.\n\nThere we go, same answer again.\n\nAlright, so no matter which method I use, I keep getting the area as 84. That gives me confidence that 84 is the correct area of the triangle.\n\nJust to be thorough, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry?\n\nLet's try coordinate geometry. Let's place the triangle on a coordinate plane. Suppose I place one vertex at the origin (0,0), and another vertex along the x-axis at (14,0), since that's one of the sides. Then, the third vertex will be at some point (x,y) such that the distances to the other two vertices are 13 and 15, respectively.\n\nSo, let's denote the vertices as A(0,0), B(14,0), and C(x,y).\n\nThen, AC = 15 and BC = 13.\n\nSo, distance from A to C: sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 15 => x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 225\n\nDistance from B to C: sqrt((x - 14)\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 13 => (x - 14)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 169\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(x - 14)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 169 - 225 => x\u00b2 - 28x + 196 + y\u00b2 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -56 => -28x + 196 = -56 => -28x = -252 => x = 9\n\nNow, plug x = 9 back into the first equation:\n\n81 + y\u00b2 = 225 => y\u00b2 = 144 => y = 12 or y = -12\n\nSince area is positive, it doesn't matter which one we take; the absolute value will give the same area.\n\nSo, the height is 12, and the base is 14, so area = (1/2)*14*12 = 84.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it enough ways. The area of the triangle is 84.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{84} \\]"
