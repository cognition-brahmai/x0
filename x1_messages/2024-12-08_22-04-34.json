Each tool can be called with an input string and will produce an output that can be stored in a variable :evidence[n]: for use in subsequent steps.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nSearchEngine[input]: This tool allows you to search for information on the internet. The input should be a query related to the information you're looking for.\nTextAnalyzer[input]: Analyzes a text and extracts key pieces of information such as names, dates, places etc. It takes plain text as input.\nFactChecker[input]: Verifies factual claims by cross-referencing multiple sources. Input is a statement or claim to be checked.\nQA[input]: Can answer questions based on common sense, general world knowledge, and given context. Particularly useful when the answer is contained within a previous evidence variable.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who was the first person to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen and what year did it happen?"
