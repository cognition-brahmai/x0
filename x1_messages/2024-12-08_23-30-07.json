        "content": "That would be Antonio Vivaldi, the famous Baroque composer from Italy. His \"The Four Seasons\" is indeed a set of four violin concertos, each depicting a different season: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Each concerto is programmatic, meaning it tells a story or paints a scene through music, which was quite innovative for its time. Vivaldi even wrote sonnets to accompany each concerto, describing the scenes and emotions portrayed in the music. It's truly a masterpiece and one of the most popular pieces in classical music repertoire."
