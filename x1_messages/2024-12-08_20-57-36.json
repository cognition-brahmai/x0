        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, initially, there are four people in a room, and then one more person enters, making it a total of five people. Each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, and we need to find out how many handshakes occur in total.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario clearly. There are five people in total, and each one shakes hands with every other person only once. So, for example, person A shakes hands with person B, person C, person D, and person E, but not with themselves.\n\nOne way to approach this is to think about combinations. Specifically, since each handshake involves two people, we can think of this as choosing 2 people out of 5 to shake hands. The number of ways to choose 2 people out of 5 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose. In this case, \\( n = 5 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\), so:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \\frac{120}{2 \\times 6} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, there should be 10 handshakes in total.\n\nBut let me double-check this by thinking about it differently. Maybe I can consider each person and count the handshakes they make.\n\nStarting with person A: they shake hands with B, C, D, and E\u2014that's 4 handshakes.\n\nNext, person B has already shaken hands with A, so they shake hands with C, D, and E\u2014that's 3 additional handshakes.\n\nThen, person C has already shaken hands with A and B, so they shake hands with D and E\u2014that's 2 more handshakes.\n\nPerson D has already shaken hands with A, B, and C, so they shake hands with E\u2014that's 1 more handshake.\n\nFinally, person E has already shaken hands with A, B, C, and D, so they don't need to shake hands with anyone else.\n\nAdding these up: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 handshakes, which matches the combination approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the total number of possible handshakes if order didn't matter. Each handshake is between two people, and since the order doesn't matter (A shaking hands with B is the same as B shaking hands with A), we again have 5 choose 2, which is 10.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that each of the 5 people shakes hands with 4 others, which would initially seem like 5 \u00d7 4 = 20 handshakes. However, this counts each handshake twice (once for each participant), so we need to divide by 2 to correct for this, giving us 20 / 2 = 10 handshakes.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same conclusion: there are 10 handshakes in total.\n\nWait a minute, the problem mentions that one more person enters the room after there are already four people. Does this affect the total number of handshakes? Let's see.\n\nIf the fifth person enters after the initial four have already shaken hands among themselves, then we need to consider the handshakes in two parts:\n\n1. The handshakes among the initial four people.\n\n2. The handshakes involving the fifth person with each of the initial four.\n\nFirst, among the initial four people, the number of handshakes is 4 choose 2, which is:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\times 2} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 6 handshakes among the initial four.\n\nThen, when the fifth person enters, they shake hands with each of the four existing people, adding 4 more handshakes.\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes is 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nThis again confirms the earlier result.\n\nHowever, the problem states that each person shakes hands with every other person once, regardless of when they entered the room. So, whether the fifth person entered after the initial four had already shaken hands among themselves or not, the total number of unique pairs remains the same, which is 10.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Suppose we list all possible unique pairs of the five people:\n\nLet's label them A, B, C, D, and E.\n\nPossible handshakes:\n\nA-B\n\nA-C\n\nA-D\n\nA-E\n\nB-C\n\nB-D\n\nB-E\n\nC-D\n\nC-E\n\nD-E\n\nThat's a total of 10 unique pairs, so 10 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the sequence in which people enter the room, but still ensure that each pair shakes hands only once, we should still end up with the same total.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Start with A in the room. No handshakes yet.\n\n- B enters, shakes hands with A. Total handshakes: 1.\n\n- C enters, shakes hands with A and B. Total handshakes: 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n- D enters, shakes hands with A, B, and C. Total handshakes: 3 + 3 = 6.\n\n- E enters, shakes hands with A, B, C, and D. Total handshakes: 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nAgain, we arrive at 10 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, if all five people are present and each shakes hands with every other person exactly once, the total is still 10 handshakes.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the order in which people enter the room, as long as each pair shakes hands exactly once, the total number of handshakes is 10.\n\nIn conclusion, the total number of handshakes that occur is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
