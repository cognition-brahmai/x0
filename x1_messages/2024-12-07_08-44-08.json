        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces widgets in batches of 50, and at full capacity, it can produce up to 1200 widgets in a week. So, if they're operating at full capacity, they're making 1200 widgets.\n\nNow, each batch is 50 widgets, right? So, to find out how many full batches they can make, I should divide the total number of widgets by the batch size.\n\nSo, 1200 divided by 50. Let me do that calculation.\n\n1200 \u00f7 50 = 24.\n\nSo, they can make 24 full batches of 50 widgets each, which would be 24 \u00d7 50 = 1200 widgets.\n\nBut the question is asking for incomplete batches at the end of the week. If they've produced exactly 1200 widgets, which is a multiple of 50, then all batches are complete. There are no incomplete batches.\n\nWait a minute, the question says, \"if the factory operates at full capacity, how many incomplete batches will there be at the end of the week?\"\n\nBut according to this calculation, there are no incomplete batches because 1200 is perfectly divisible by 50.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something here. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"A factory produces widgets in batches of 50. In a week, the factory can produce at most 1200 widgets. If the factory operates at full capacity, how many incomplete batches will there be at the end of the week?\"\n\nSo, full capacity is 1200 widgets per week, and they produce in batches of 50. If they produce exactly 1200 widgets, which is 24 batches of 50, there should be no incomplete batches.\n\nBut perhaps the factory doesn't always produce in complete batches. Maybe they start a new batch even if they don't finish it. But the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory is limited by other factors and can't always produce complete batches.\n\nWait, the question says \"produces widgets in batches of 50,\" implying that they produce in complete batches.\n\nBut then, if they operate at full capacity, producing 1200 widgets, which is exactly 24 batches of 50, there should be no incomplete batches.\n\nUnless there's some other constraint or if the factory tries to produce more than 1200 but can't due to capacity limits.\n\nBut the question says \"at full capacity,\" meaning they're producing the maximum they can, which is 1200 widgets.\n\nSo, in that case, they would have produced 24 complete batches with no widgets left over.\n\nTherefore, the number of incomplete batches at the end of the week would be zero.\n\nI think the answer is zero incomplete batches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
