        "content": "So the telecommunications company wants to expand its fiber-optic network into rural areas. They currently have 5,000 miles of cable installed and they want to increase that by 50%. So first, I need to figure out how much new cable they need to install.\n\nTo find 50% of 5,000 miles, I can calculate:\n\n5,000 miles * 0.5 = 2,500 miles\n\nSo, they need to install an additional 2,500 miles of cable.\n\nNext, each mile of new cable installation costs $20,000. This cost includes labor, materials, and permits. So, the cost for the cable installation would be:\n\n2,500 miles * $20,000/mile = $50,000,000\n\nNow, in addition to the cable, they need to build new relay stations every 100 miles along the expanded network. Each relay station costs $1 million.\n\nFirst, I need to determine how many new relay stations are required for the 2,500 miles of new cable.\n\nTo find the number of relay stations, I can divide the total new miles by 100 miles per station:\n\n2,500 miles / 100 miles/station = 25 stations\n\nSo, they need to build 25 new relay stations.\n\nEach relay station costs $1 million, so the total cost for the relay stations is:\n\n25 stations * $1,000,000/station = $25,000,000\n\nNow, to find the total investment required for the entire expansion project, I need to add the cost of the cable installation and the cost of the relay stations:\n\n$50,000,000 (cable) + $25,000,000 (relay stations) = $75,000,000\n\nTherefore, the total investment required for this expansion project is $75 million.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, 50% of 5,000 miles is indeed 2,500 miles.\n\nThen, 2,500 miles times $20,000 per mile equals $50,000,000 for the cable.\n\nNext, 2,500 miles divided by 100 miles per station equals 25 stations.\n\n25 stations times $1,000,000 per station equals $25,000,000.\n\nAdding $50,000,000 and $25,000,000 gives $75,000,000.\n\nEverything seems to check out.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are any other costs involved that might not have been mentioned in the problem. For example, are there any costs associated with maintaining the new network, or permits and regulations beyond the initial installation permits?\n\nBut based on the information provided, the total investment required is $75 million.\n\nSo, the final answer is $75 million.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75000000} \\]"
