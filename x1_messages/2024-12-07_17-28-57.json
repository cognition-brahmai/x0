        "content": "So I have this problem: a book has 300 pages, and I read 20 pages a day. I need to find out how many days it will take to finish the book. Hmm, this seems like a division problem. I think I should divide the total number of pages by the number of pages I read each day.\n\nSo, total pages are 300, and I read 20 pages per day. So, 300 divided by 20 should give me the number of days. Let me do that calculation. 300 divided by 20 is 15. So, it should take 15 days to finish the book.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Suppose I read 20 pages every day for 15 days, that would be 20 times 15, which is 300 pages. Yes, that makes sense. Alternatively, if I think about it in terms of how many 20-page chunks there are in 300 pages, it's again 15 chunks.\n\nI wonder if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using multiplication. If I let the number of days be D, then 20 pages per day times D days should equal 300 pages. So, 20D = 300. Then, solving for D, I divide both sides by 20, and I get D = 15. Same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the rate at which I'm reading, which is 20 pages per day, and I want to know how many days for 300 pages, I can use the formula time = total amount / rate. So, time = 300 pages / 20 pages per day, which again gives me 15 days.\n\nI think this is straightforward. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this. For example, maybe some days I read more or less than 20 pages, but the problem says I read 20 pages a day, so I'll assume it's consistent.\n\nAlso, I should consider if the book has any pre-read pages or if I start from page 1. But since it's a standard book with 300 pages and I start reading from the beginning, I don't think that affects the calculation.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the number of pages per day is an average or a fixed number. The problem says \"20 pages a day,\" which sounds like a fixed number. So, I'll proceed with that.\n\nLet me also think about fractional days. If the division didn't come out to a whole number, would I need to round up or down? For example, if the book had 310 pages, 310 divided by 20 is 15.5 days. In that case, I couldn't read half a day, so I'd need to decide whether to round up to 16 days or down to 15 days. But since 15 days would only cover 300 pages, I'd need an additional day to cover the extra 10 pages. So, in that scenario, I'd round up.\n\nBut in this case, since 300 divided by 20 is exactly 15, there are no leftover pages, so 15 days is sufficient.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider another example. Suppose the book has 301 pages. Then, 301 divided by 20 is 15.05 days. Since I can't read a fraction of a day, I'd need 16 days to finish the book. Similarly, if it's 299 pages, 299 / 20 is 14.95 days, which would still take 15 days to finish.\n\nBut in this specific problem, it's exactly 300 pages, which divides evenly by 20, so 15 days is the exact amount of time needed.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here. The answer should be 15 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
