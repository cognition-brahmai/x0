        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 2000 widgets per day. Each widget costs $10 to produce, and they sell each one for $15. I need to find out the daily profit.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the total production cost per day. Since each widget costs $10 and they make 2000 of them, I can multiply 2000 by $10 to get the total cost.\n\nSo, total production cost = 2000 widgets * $10/widget = $20,000 per day.\n\nNext, I need to find out how much money they make from selling these widgets. They sell each widget for $15, so again, I'll multiply the number of widgets by the selling price.\n\nTotal revenue = 2000 widgets * $15/widget = $30,000 per day.\n\nNow, profit is typically calculated as total revenue minus total costs. So, in this case, it would be $30,000 minus $20,000.\n\nProfit = $30,000 - $20,000 = $10,000 per day.\n\nWait a minute, does that sound right? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal production cost: 2000 * $10 = $20,000. That seems correct.\n\nTotal revenue: 2000 * $15 = $30,000. That also seems correct.\n\nProfit: $30,000 - $20,000 = $10,000. Yeah, that looks good.\n\nBut maybe there are other costs involved that I'm not considering, like overhead or labor costs. The problem only mentions production cost per widget, which I assume includes all costs directly related to making each widget.\n\nIf there are additional fixed costs, like rent for the factory or salaries for workers, those would also need to be subtracted from the revenue to find the true profit. But since the problem doesn't mention any other costs, I'll assume that the $10 production cost per widget covers all expenses.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether all 2000 widgets are sold every day. The problem says they produce 2000 widgets per day and sell them at $15 each, so I'll assume they sell all of them.\n\nIf there were unsold widgets, that would affect the inventory and possibly the profit, but again, the problem doesn't mention any unsold items, so I'll proceed with the assumption that all widgets are sold.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Total production cost: $20,000 per day\n\n- Total revenue from sales: $30,000 per day\n\n- Daily profit: $10,000\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the profit per widget first and then multiply by the number of widgets.\n\nProfit per widget = selling price - production cost = $15 - $10 = $5\n\nThen, total daily profit = profit per widget * number of widgets = $5 * 2000 = $10,000\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, which is a good sign.\n\nI can also think about contribution margin or other financial metrics, but for the purpose of finding daily profit, this seems sufficient.\n\nIs there any other factor that could affect the profit? For example, taxes, subsidies, or variable costs. But again, the problem doesn't provide any information about these, so I'll stick with the given data.\n\nIn conclusion, the daily profit generated by the factory is $10,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10000} \\]"
