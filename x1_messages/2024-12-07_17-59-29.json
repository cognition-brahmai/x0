HAMMER: Tonight a SHOWBIZ TONIGHT special report, \"Bad girls, Bad Boys!\" Take a look at what`s going on in Hollywood. Really seems like bad behavior is now a girl thing. But why? The partying, drinking and driving, rehab, and jail. We want to know what`s really happening in Hollywood. Welcome back to SHOWBIZ TONIGHT on a hump night. It is 30 minutes past the hour. I`m A.J. Hammer New York. ANDERSON: I`m Brooke Anderson in Hollywood. You are watching TV`s most provocative entertainment news show. Tonight a SHOWBIZ TONIGHT special report, \"Bad Girls, Bad Boys!\". You know, we could barely go a day, A.J., without hearing about a Hollywood star crossing the line. Here`s the latest. \"Simple Life\" star Nicole Richie got a reprieve of sorts. Richie`s DUI hearing was delayed until August 16th. She did not appear in court today, but she`ll be required to appear next month. Richie was granted the hearing so a defense expert could testify to challenge the drug test being used against her. And the court spokesperson confirmed that Richie was offered a plea deal, but the terms of that deal have not been released. No word on whether or not she`ll accept it. Richie has a prior DUI conviction. If she`s convicted a second time, she faces a minimum of five days in jail. Richie recently told SHOWBIZ TONIGHT that she`s willing to face whatever consequences come her way. The controversy surrounding Richie`s \"Simple Life\" co-star Paris Hilton isn`t fading fast. Now Barbara Walters is speaking out about what she really thinks about Paris. BARBARA WALTERS, HOST, \"THE VIEW\": I have to start off by saying that I like Paris Hilton. Whatever she did or didn`t do, she`s basically a good kid. She`s a nice girl. She`s not a mean girl. HAMMER: So, Paris may not be a mean girl, but she`s certainly one of Hollywood`s best known bad girls, and all this talk of bad girls got us here at SHOWBIZ TONIGHT wondering where have all of Hollywood`s bad boys gone? Think about it, there used to be so many of them -- you had your Jack Nicholson, Russell Crowe, Colin Farrell . Now those guys, out of the picture. Bad girls are front and center. What is going on here? Our SHOWBIZ TONIGHT special report continues now with more bad girls. HAMMER (voice over): Bad boys come in all shapes and sizes. There`s the rock star bad boy, the 1980s bad boy, and even the angry bad boy. But these guys have gone away. Gone, pushed aside by bad girls, very bad girls. BRITNEY SPEARS: What`s up, Vegas? JO PIAZZA, ENTERTAINMENT JOURNALIST: I think the bad boys were so 2005-2006, and 2007 is really the year of the bad girl. HAMMER: From cat fights and DUIs with Paris Hilton, to head shaving and heavy duty partying with Britney Spears, SHOWBIZ TONIGHT can tell you Hollywood`s young leading ladies are doing enough misbehaving to out-bad the bad boys. DAVID CAPLAN, VH1`s 24 SIZZLER.COM: They just behave by a different code of conduct. In the past the guys who have been out of control when you look at Colin Farrell -- and even earlier like Cory Haim (ph) and all those guys in the `80s and `90s, you really saw them just plummet. The girls somehow, it always goes well for them. HOWARD BRAGMAN, FIFTEEN MINUTES PUBILC RELATIONS: I call it the cat pack right now. That`s Paris and Lindsay and Nicole. It shows that women can behave just as badly as men and be just as outrageous. HAMMER: So who is the most outrageous bad girl of them all? Let`s start with Nicole Richie. Rehab and rumored eating disorders were just the tip of the iceberg. Richie`s bad girl stock skyrocketed with this mug shot. CAPLAN: Nicole Richie is one of the baddest bad girls if Hollywood right now because she`s so unabashed about what makes her bad. HAMMER: Police arrested Nicole for DUI after driving the wrong way on a freeway in December. She had no problem allegedly telling cops she had been popping Vicodin and smoking pot before getting behind the wheel. From mug shots to mean girls. You can`t say the word`s Hollywood bad girl without bringing up Paris Hilton. Paris not only has her sex tapes, but also her DUI arrest, jail sentence, and dozens of cat fights. CAPLAN: Paris Hilton is one of young Hollywood`s meanest girls. She`s really the leader of this clique. You see her in nightclubs. She`s talking bad about everyone. PARIS HILTON: She`s a CAPLAN: But at the same time all these girls flock to her. When Britney Spears wanted to essentially come out after splitting with Kevin Federline, who did she go to? Paris Hilton. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We were nice. We just won. PIAZZA: It`s kind of like the bad girl that everyone wants the chance to be at one point in their life, but they can never do it. HAMMER: From Hollywood bad girls to beauty queen bad girls. Miss USA Tara Connor and former Miss Nevada Katie Reese gave pageants a bad name after admitting to underage drinking and drug use. TARA CONNER, FMR. MISS USA: I wouldn`t say that I`m an alcoholic. HAMMER: While Miss USA went to rehab, Miss Nevada gave up her crown after these racy party pictures made their way to the internet and to entertainment sites like TMZ.com. CAPLAN: It`s sort of good girl, gone bad. HAMMER: Why is this happening? SHOWBIZ TONIGHT can tell you the fascination with our bad girls is largely due to the lack of any good bad boys. PIAZZA: We just don`t have any bad boys on the scene. Colin Farrell has disappeared. HAMMER: A smoker, a heavy drinker, and a serial dater, Colin Farrell burst onto the Hollywood scene as one of the baddest boys since Jack Nicholson. COLIN FARRELL, ACTOR: I can`t. I`d have to strangle you. HAMMER: He famously told \"W\" magazine, quote, \"When I come to town CAPLAN: Colin Farrell was great. He really went to the extreme with his bad boy behavior. There was drinking. There was just full-on promiscuous out. There was violence, he had a bit of a temper. HAMMER: But Farrell`s full-throttle partying caught up with him. Colin checked into rehab from drinking and painkillers in 2005 after making the bad boy movie \"Miami Vice.\" FARRELL: You think I`m CAPLAN: He went into rehab, and he sort of saw the light. But with him, on a personal front, it also helped him, though, that he had a child to take care of. You see that with a lot of these pad boys, they have a kid and then they become this great, a doting dad. HAMMER: Doting dad? Doting dads don`t sell magazines. Bad girls do. Especially in the tabloids, where most of the readership is made up of women, and SHOWBIZ TONIGHT can now tell you that is why we`re seeing more of this. BRAGMAN: Every time a woman goes out, there`s -- you have her outfit you can judge. Does she look sober? There`s so many things, and a guy can put on a pair of jeans and T-shirt and pretty much go anywhere. If a woman goes out without makeup, it`s news, right? You`ll see that picture in the tabloids and go, look how bad she looks. ANDERSON: Well, from bad girls in Hollywood to funny girls making headlines on Capitol Hill. A new musical parody is singing its support for New York Senator Hillary Clinton. It`s the must-see video on the Internet these days, and it seems to have changed the rhythm of the political debate. Here`s CNN`s Jeanne Moos for SHOWBIZ TONIGHT. JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Obama girl -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Cuz, I`ve got a crush on Obama -- MOOS: Meet Hot for Hill. TARYN SOUTHERN, MUSIC VIDEO CREATOR (singing): I have a crush on a girl named Hill, but she`s not with me, she`s with a guy named Bill -- MOOS: Oh, he won`t mind. SOUTHERN (singing): Hillary, I think I need you! MOOS: Actress Taryn Southern was inspired by the \"I`ve Got a Crush on Obama\" video. SOUTHERN (speaking): I thought it was brilliant MOOS: So the former \"American Idol\" contestant did a parody of the parody. SOUTHERN (singing): I could be your maid, or your White House aide, or the soldier who marches in your first parade -- SOUTHERN (speaking): I would vote for Hillary. MOOS: But we`re not sure this is the best way to help her get elected. SOUTHERN (singing): H-I-L-L-A-R-Y, I know you`re not gay, but I`m hoping for bi -- MOOS: We opted for a bi-coastal chat (ph). (on camera): The whole angle of a girl writing about a crush on a girl, is it safe to assume you`re acting? SOUTHERN (speaking) I am actually straight. SOUTHERN (singing): The USA would be a better place if everyone could just get a taste -- of you -- SOUTHERN (speaking): When I was writing this, this video, I knew that the comedy would come from the fact that it`s a girl singing about how she has a crush on a girl. That`s what made the parody different from the \"Obama Girl\" video. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You`re into border security, let`s break this border between you and me -- MOOS (voice over): It`s hard to keep up. Not too long ago a Condoleezza Rice video was big. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Condi-licious -- MOOS: A Condi imitator rapped on subjects ranging from Iraq to her Condi-licious shoes. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I live my shoes so much I give them names like they were children -- MOOS: From Condi`s shoes to Hillary`s skin. SOUTHERN (singing): You`ve got great skin. MOOS: The gayness seemed to get under the skin of some, though most who commented online seemed amused. (on camera): She may be hot for Hill, but Hillary wasn`t hot to comment. The campaign had nothing to say about the video. ( Voice over): They never returned our call. There was competition between \"Hillary Girl\" and \"Obama Girl\". While \"Obama Girl\" featured bootie shorts. \"Hot for Hill\" focused on pantsuits. SOUTHERN (singing): I like your hair, the pants that you wear, and the shape of your derriere -- SOUTHERN (speaking): I do like her pant suits. MOOS: Derriere, was just a nice rhyme. ANDERSON: All right then. That was CNN`s Jeanne Moos for SHOWBIZ TONIGHT. HAMMER: Big question tonight, will he or won`t he? Will Harry Potter live on past this next book? Does the star of the movies even know his own fate? I asked Harry Potter, himself, Daniel Radcliffe. Will he be peaking at the end of the book? DANIEL RADCLIFFE, ACTOR: I will not be flipping to the back. Absolutely not. I want to get the whole story, no matter how long it takes me. HAMMER: Secrets from Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe, still ahead in the interview you`ll see only on SHOWBIZ TONIGHT. ANDERSON: Also, Steve Carell is the new Maxwell Smart. He is part of the hilarious ensemble cast that will definitely make you crack up. Coming up, we have the SHOWBIZ TONIGHT \"First Look\" at the movie \"Get Smart.\"\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 20 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
