        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a bag with different colored balls: 4 red, 6 blue, and 5 green. I need to find the probability of drawing either a red or a blue ball at random. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the basic formula for probability: the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are drawing either a red or a blue ball.\n\nSo, the number of red balls is 4, and the number of blue balls is 6. So, the total number of favorable outcomes should be 4 plus 6, which is 10.\n\nNow, what's the total number of possible outcomes? That should be the total number of balls in the bag. There are 4 red, 6 blue, and 5 green balls. So, 4 plus 6 plus 5 equals 15 balls in total.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a red or blue ball should be 10 divided by 15. But I can simplify that fraction. Both 10 and 15 are divisible by 5, so 10 divided by 5 is 2, and 15 divided by 5 is 3. So, the simplified fraction is 2/3.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think about it another way to confirm. The probability of drawing a red ball is 4/15, and the probability of drawing a blue ball is 6/15. So, the probability of drawing either red or blue should be the sum of these two probabilities, right?\n\nSo, 4/15 plus 6/15 is 10/15, which again simplifies to 2/3. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can consider the probability of not drawing a green ball, since the only other options are red and blue. The number of green balls is 5, so the probability of drawing a green ball is 5/15, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not drawing a green ball (i.e., drawing either red or blue) should be 1 minus 1/3, which is 2/3. Again, the same result.\n\nSo, it seems consistent no matter how I approach it. The probability of drawing a red or blue ball is 2/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}} \\]"
