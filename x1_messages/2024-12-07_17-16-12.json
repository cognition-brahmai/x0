        "content": "Alright, so the national sports league is thinking about expanding by adding two new teams. Each team needs a new stadium, and those stadiums cost $500 million each to build. Plus, there are other costs like paying players, coaches, and running the teams day to day. We need to figure out how much all this is going to cost in total and then see if it's worth it by looking at how much money they can make from ticket sales, selling merchandise, and broadcasting rights.\n\nFirst things first, let's tackle the costs.\n\n**1. Stadium Construction:**\n\nEach stadium costs $500 million, and they're building two of them. So, that's:\n\n\\( 500 \\, \\text{million} \\times 2 = 1,000 \\, \\text{million} \\)\n\nSo, $1 billion just for the stadiums.\n\n**2. Player Salaries:**\n\nThis is a bit tricky because player salaries can vary a lot depending on the sport and the league. Let's assume an average team salary cap for the league is, say, $100 million per year. Since they're adding two new teams, that would be:\n\n\\( 100 \\, \\text{million} \\times 2 = 200 \\, \\text{million} \\) per year.\n\nBut this is an annual cost. To get a sense of the total investment, we might want to consider how many years this expansion is expected to pay for itself. Let's assume a 10-year period for this analysis. So, over 10 years, that would be:\n\n\\( 200 \\, \\text{million} \\times 10 = 2,000 \\, \\text{million} \\)\n\nSo, another $2 billion for player salaries over 10 years.\n\n**3. Coaching Staff and Operational Expenses:**\n\nAgain, this can vary, but let's assume that for each team, coaching staff and other operational expenses amount to about $20 million per year. For two teams, that's:\n\n\\( 20 \\, \\text{million} \\times 2 = 40 \\, \\text{million} \\) per year.\n\nOver 10 years, that would be:\n\n\\( 40 \\, \\text{million} \\times 10 = 400 \\, \\text{million} \\)\n\nSo, an additional $400 million for coaching and operations over 10 years.\n\nNow, let's add up all these costs:\n\n- Stadiums: $1,000 million\n\n- Player salaries for 10 years: $2,000 million\n\n- Coaching and operations for 10 years: $400 million\n\nTotal investment:\n\n\\( 1,000 + 2,000 + 400 = 3,400 \\, \\text{million} \\)\n\nSo, $3.4 billion is the total investment required for the expansion over 10 years.\n\nNext, let's look at the potential revenue sources:\n\n**1. Ticket Sales:**\n\nAssuming each team plays, say, 80 home games per year (this number can vary by sport), with an average attendance of, say, 50,000 per game, and average ticket price of $50.\n\nSo, per game revenue from tickets:\n\n\\( 50,000 \\, \\text{tickets} \\times \\$50 = 2,500,000 \\)\n\nPer year per team:\n\n\\( 2,500,000 \\times 80 = 200,000,000 \\)\n\nFor two teams:\n\n\\( 200,000,000 \\times 2 = 400,000,000 \\)\n\nOver 10 years:\n\n\\( 400,000,000 \\times 10 = 4,000,000,000 \\)\n\nSo, $4 billion from ticket sales over 10 years.\n\n**2. Merchandise:**\n\nLet's assume each team generates $10 million per year from merchandise sales.\n\nFor two teams:\n\n\\( 10,000,000 \\times 2 = 20,000,000 \\)\n\nOver 10 years:\n\n\\( 20,000,000 \\times 10 = 200,000,000 \\)\n\nSo, $200 million from merchandise over 10 years.\n\n**3. Broadcasting Rights:**\n\nThis can be a significant source of revenue. Let's assume that with two more teams, the league can negotiate an additional $100 million per year in broadcasting rights.\n\nOver 10 years:\n\n\\( 100,000,000 \\times 10 = 1,000,000,000 \\)\n\nSo, $1 billion from broadcasting rights over 10 years.\n\nNow, let's add up all the revenue streams:\n\n- Ticket sales: $4,000 million\n\n- Merchandise: $200 million\n\n- Broadcasting rights: $1,000 million\n\nTotal revenue:\n\n\\( 4,000 + 200 + 1,000 = 5,200 \\, \\text{million} \\)\n\nSo, $5.2 billion in total revenue over 10 years.\n\nNow, to calculate the return on investment (ROI), we subtract the total investment from the total revenue:\n\n\\( 5,200 - 3,400 = 1,800 \\, \\text{million} \\)\n\nSo, there's a potential profit of $1.8 billion over 10 years.\n\nTo express this as a percentage ROI:\n\n\\( \\text{ROI} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{profit}}{\\text{investment}} \\right) \\times 100 \\)\n\n\\( \\text{ROI} = \\left( \\frac{1,800}{3,400} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 52.9\\% \\)\n\nSo, the potential ROI is approximately 52.9% over 10 years.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is a simplified analysis. There are many other factors to consider, such as:\n\n- Debt financing for stadium construction and the associated interest costs.\n\n- Maintenance and operational costs of the stadiums beyond the initial construction.\n\n- Potential increases in expenses over time due to inflation.\n\n- Competition from existing teams for fan base and revenue.\n\n- Economic fluctuations and their impact on consumer spending.\n\n- Legal and regulatory considerations, such as zoning laws and tax incentives.\n\n- Opportunity costs of investing in expansion versus other potential uses of the funds.\n\nDespite these complexities, based on this initial analysis, the expansion seems financially viable, with a potential profit of $1.8 billion and an ROI of about 52.9% over 10 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{52.9\\% \\text{ ROI over 10 years}}"
