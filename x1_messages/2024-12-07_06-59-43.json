        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Bob and Alice, and we're told that Bob has twice as many marbles as Alice. Also, together they have 18 marbles. We need to find out how many marbles each one has.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what's being said. If Alice has a certain number of marbles, let's say x, then Bob has twice that amount, which would be 2x. Together, their marbles add up to 18. So, Alice's marbles plus Bob's marbles equal 18.\n\nNow, let's write that down in a mathematical equation. Alice's marbles: x, Bob's marbles: 2x, and together: x + 2x = 18.\n\nCombining like terms, that's 3x = 18.\n\nTo find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3.\n\nSo, x = 18 / 3, which is x = 6.\n\nTherefore, Alice has 6 marbles.\n\nSince Bob has twice as many as Alice, Bob has 2 * 6 = 12 marbles.\n\nLet's double-check to make sure that adds up to 18: 6 + 12 = 18. Perfect, that checks out.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the total number of marbles divided among Alice and Bob in a ratio of 1:2, since Bob has twice as many as Alice.\n\nThe total parts are 1 + 2 = 3 parts.\n\nEach part represents 18 / 3 = 6 marbles.\n\nSo, Alice has 1 part, which is 6 marbles, and Bob has 2 parts, which is 12 marbles.\n\nEither way, we arrive at the same conclusion.\n\nI think that makes sense. Is there anything else we need to consider here?\n\nWait a minute, let's make sure there aren't any other constraints or interpretations we should consider.\n\nThe problem is pretty straightforward: Bob has twice as many marbles as Alice, and together they have 18 marbles.\n\nWe've set up an equation based on that information and solved for the number of marbles each has.\n\nIt seems solid.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nPerhaps using subtraction instead of addition.\n\nIf Bob has twice as many marbles as Alice, then the difference between Bob's and Alice's marbles is equal to Alice's marbles.\n\nSo, Bob's marbles minus Alice's marbles equals Alice's marbles.\n\nIn other words, 2x - x = x.\n\nAnd we know that together they have 18 marbles, so x + 2x = 18, which again leads us to x = 6.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, we end up with the same answer.\n\nI feel confident about this solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Alice has 6 marbles and Bob has 12 marbles.}} \\]"
