        "content": "No, rivers do not only flow from north to south. The direction in which a river flows depends on the topography and the location of its source and mouth. Rivers can flow in any direction, including north, south, east, west, or a combination of these directions. For example, the Mississippi River in the United States flows generally southward, while the Danube River in Europe flows primarily westward and then southward. The direction of river flow is determined by the slope of the land and the path of least resistance for the water to reach a lower elevation.\n"
