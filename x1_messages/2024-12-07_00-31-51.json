A species that has a disproportionately large effect on its environment relative to its abundance.\n\nKeystone species play a critical role in maintaining the structure of an ecological community, affecting many other organisms in the ecosystem and helping to determine the types and numbers of various other species in the community. Their impact is often greater than their abundance would suggest. For example, sea otters are considered a keystone species in kelp forest ecosystems because they control sea urchin populations, which in turn allows kelp to thrive. If sea otters are removed, sea urchins can overgraze the kelp, leading to a dramatic shift in the ecosystem.\n"
