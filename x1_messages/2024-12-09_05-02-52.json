        "content": "So I've got this problem here about two trains traveling from Town A to Town B at different speeds, and I need to figure out how long it takes for the second train to make the trip. Let's see.\n\nFirst, there's a train that travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, and it takes 5 hours to go from Town A to Town B. I need to find out the distance between Town A and Town B. I remember that distance is equal to speed multiplied by time, so:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo for the first train:\n\nDistance = 60 miles per hour \u00d7 5 hours = 300 miles\n\nOkay, so the distance between Town A and Town B is 300 miles.\n\nNow, there's another train that travels at a constant speed of 80 miles per hour. I need to find out how long it takes for this train to cover the same 300-mile distance.\n\nAgain, using the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nBut this time, I need to find the time, so I can rearrange the formula to:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nPlugging in the values for the second train:\n\nTime = 300 miles / 80 miles per hour\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n300 divided by 80 is 3.75 hours.\n\nSo, it takes the second train 3.75 hours to travel from Town A to Town B.\n\nBut maybe I should check if this makes sense. The first train is slower, at 60 mph, and it takes 5 hours. The second train is faster, at 80 mph, so it should take less time, which it does\u20143.75 hours is less than 5 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of proportions. Since speed and time are inversely proportional when distance is constant, the ratio of speeds should be inverse to the ratio of times.\n\nSo, speed1 / speed2 = time2 / time1\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n60 / 80 = time2 / 5\n\n60/80 simplifies to 3/4, so:\n\n3/4 = time2 / 5\n\nTherefore, time2 = (3/4) \u00d7 5 = 15/4 = 3.75 hours\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to express 3.75 hours in hours and minutes, 0.75 hours is 45 minutes, so it's 3 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify the format, 3.75 hours is fine.\n\nLet me just double-check the distance calculation to be sure. If the first train travels at 60 mph for 5 hours, distance is indeed 300 miles. And then, at 80 mph, time is 300 divided by 80, which is 3.75 hours. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI think that's the answer: 3.75 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3.75 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
