        "content": "So I've got this problem here about finding the surface area of a rectangular prism. The dimensions given are: length is 5 inches, width is 4 inches, and height is 6 inches. I need to find out what its surface area is.\n\nFirst off, I need to remember what a rectangular prism is. It's basically a box shape with six faces, all of which are rectangles. The surface area should be the total area of all these six faces combined.\n\nI recall that there's a formula for the surface area of a rectangular prism, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. I think it involves multiplying the length, width, and height in different combinations and then adding those areas up.\n\nLet me try to recall the formula. I think it's something like SA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. Does that sound right?\n\nOkay, let's plug in the values here. Length (l) is 5 inches, width (w) is 4 inches, and height (h) is 6 inches.\n\nSo, SA = 2*(5*4) + 2*(5*6) + 2*(4*6)\n\nLet me calculate each part step by step.\n\nFirst, 5 times 4 is 20, and then multiplied by 2 is 40.\n\nNext, 5 times 6 is 30, and multiplied by 2 is 60.\n\nThen, 4 times 6 is 24, and multiplied by 2 is 48.\n\nNow, I need to add these up: 40 + 60 + 48.\n\n40 plus 60 is 100, and then plus 48 is 148.\n\nSo, the surface area should be 148 square inches.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that formula to make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe there's another way to calculate it.\n\nI found a reference that confirms the formula for the surface area of a rectangular prism is indeed SA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh. So, I think I got it right.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about why this formula makes sense.\n\nA rectangular prism has six faces: front and back, left and right, top and bottom.\n\nThe front and back faces both have dimensions of length by height, so each has an area of l*h, and there are two of them, hence 2*l*h.\n\nSimilarly, the left and right faces have dimensions of width by height, so each has an area of w*h, and there are two of them, hence 2*w*h.\n\nThe top and bottom faces have dimensions of length by width, so each has an area of l*w, and there are two of them, hence 2*l*w.\n\nAdding all these up gives the total surface area: 2*l*w + 2*l*h + 2*w*h.\n\nSo, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I've seen sometimes people calculate the surface area by finding the area of one set of opposite faces and then multiplying by two for each set.\n\nSo, for example, find the area of the front face (l*h), double it for front and back; find the area of the left face (w*h), double it for left and right; find the area of the top face (l*w), double it for top and bottom; then add them all up.\n\nThat's essentially the same as the formula I used earlier.\n\nAnother way I thought about it is to think of the surface area as the sum of the areas of all six faces.\n\nSo, area of front + area of back + area of left + area of right + area of top + area of bottom.\n\nWhich again would be (l*h) + (l*h) + (w*h) + (w*h) + (l*w) + (l*w), which simplifies to 2*l*h + 2*w*h + 2*l*w.\n\nSame as the formula.\n\nSo, I'm confident now that the formula is correct.\n\nNow, plugging in the values:\n\nl = 5 inches\n\nw = 4 inches\n\nh = 6 inches\n\nSA = 2*(5*4) + 2*(5*6) + 2*(4*6)\n\nCalculate each part:\n\n5*4 = 20, multiplied by 2 is 40\n\n5*6 = 30, multiplied by 2 is 60\n\n4*6 = 24, multiplied by 2 is 48\n\nTotal SA = 40 + 60 + 48 = 148 square inches.\n\nWait, but just to be extra sure, maybe I can visualize this.\n\nImagine unfolding the rectangular prism into a net, which is a 2D representation of all its faces laid out flat.\n\nThe net would consist of:\n\n- Two rectangles of size 5 inches by 4 inches (top and bottom)\n\n- Two rectangles of size 5 inches by 6 inches (front and back)\n\n- Two rectangles of size 4 inches by 6 inches (left and right)\n\nNow, calculate the area of each:\n\n- Top and bottom: 5*4 = 20 each, total 40\n\n- Front and back: 5*6 = 30 each, total 60\n\n- Left and right: 4*6 = 24 each, total 48\n\nAdding them up: 40 + 60 + 48 = 148 square inches.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use a different approach, perhaps using the formula for the surface area of a rectangular prism in terms of its dimensions.\n\nI recall that sometimes surface area can also be calculated using the formula SA = 2(lw + lh + wh), which is essentially the same as before.\n\nSo, SA = 2*(5*4 + 5*6 + 4*6) = 2*(20 + 30 + 24) = 2*(74) = 148 square inches.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to approach this problem.\n\nMaybe using vectors or calculus, but that seems overly complicated for a simple rectangular prism.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to calculate it using the perimeter and height or something like that, but I don't think that would be applicable here.\n\nI think the formula I used is the most straightforward and appropriate method for this problem.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the surface area of this rectangular prism is 148 square inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{148} \\]"
