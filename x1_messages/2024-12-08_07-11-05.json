        "content": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x\u00b2 - 4x + 1 with respect to x, we'll use the basic rules of differentiation from calculus. Specifically, we'll apply the power rule, which states that if f(x) = x\u207f, where n is any real number, then the derivative f'(x) = n * x\u207f\u207b\u00b9.\n\nLet's break down the function into its individual terms and differentiate each one step by step.\n\n1. **First term: 3x\u00b2**\n\n- The power rule tells us that the derivative of x\u00b2 is 2x.\n\n- Since there's a coefficient of 3, we multiply the derivative by 3.\n\n- Therefore, the derivative of 3x\u00b2 is 3 * 2x = 6x.\n\n2. **Second term: -4x**\n\n- The derivative of x is 1.\n\n- Multiplying by the coefficient -4, the derivative of -4x is -4 * 1 = -4.\n\n3. **Third term: +1**\n\n- The derivative of a constant is zero.\n\n- Therefore, the derivative of +1 is 0.\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of all the terms to get the overall derivative of the function.\n\nf'(x) = 6x - 4 + 0 = 6x - 4\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = 3x\u00b2 - 4x + 1 with respect to x is f'(x) = 6x - 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6x - 4} \\]"
