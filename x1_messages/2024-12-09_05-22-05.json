        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I've got a rectangular room with an area of 300 square feet, and it's said that the length is twice its width. I need to find out the dimensions, which means finding both the length and the width.\n\nFirst, I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, area = length \u00d7 width. In this case, area is 300 square feet.\n\nNow, it's given that the length is twice the width. That means length = 2 \u00d7 width.\n\nLet me denote the width as 'w' for simplicity. So, width = w, and length = 2w.\n\nNow, plugging these into the area formula:\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width\n\n300 = 2w \u00d7 w\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n300 = 2w\u00b2\n\nNow, I need to solve for 'w'. Let's divide both sides by 2 to isolate w\u00b2:\n\n300 / 2 = w\u00b2\n\n150 = w\u00b2\n\nNow, to find 'w', I'll take the square root of both sides:\n\nw = \u221a150\n\nI know that \u221a150 can be simplified. Let's see:\n\n150 = 25 \u00d7 6, and \u221a25 = 5, so:\n\nw = 5\u221a6\n\nBut, it's probably better to get a decimal value. Let's calculate \u221a150 approximately.\n\n\u221a144 = 12, and \u221a169 = 13, so \u221a150 is between 12 and 13. Maybe around 12.25.\n\nWait, but let's be more precise. I can use a calculator for this.\n\nUsing a calculator, \u221a150 \u2248 12.247 feet.\n\nSo, width \u2248 12.247 feet.\n\nNow, since length is twice the width:\n\nLength = 2 \u00d7 12.247 \u2248 24.494 feet.\n\nWait, but let's check if this makes sense.\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width = 24.494 \u00d7 12.247.\n\nLet me multiply these:\n\n24.494 \u00d7 12.247 \u2248 300.00 square feet.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find exact values without using decimals.\n\nWe had w\u00b2 = 150, so w = \u221a150.\n\nAnd length = 2w = 2\u221a150.\n\nBut \u221a150 can be simplified further.\n\n150 = 25 \u00d7 6, so \u221a150 = \u221a(25 \u00d7 6) = 5\u221a6.\n\nSo, width = 5\u221a6 feet, length = 2 \u00d7 5\u221a6 = 10\u221a6 feet.\n\nNow, if I want to rationalize or present it differently, but I think this is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps the question expects numerical values.\n\nLet me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can solve it using equations.\n\nLet me set up the equation again.\n\nGiven:\n\nArea = 300 = length \u00d7 width\n\nAnd length = 2 \u00d7 width.\n\nSo, 300 = 2w \u00d7 w \u21d2 300 = 2w\u00b2 \u21d2 w\u00b2 = 150 \u21d2 w = \u221a150 = 5\u221a6 feet.\n\nThen, length = 2 \u00d7 5\u221a6 = 10\u221a6 feet.\n\nAlternatively, if I rationalize \u221a150.\n\nWait, \u221a150 = \u221a(25 \u00d7 6) = 5\u221a6, which is the simplified form.\n\nAlternatively, if I need to find numerical values, I can approximate \u221a6.\n\n\u221a4 = 2, \u221a9 = 3, so \u221a6 is approximately 2.45.\n\nSo, width = 5 \u00d7 2.45 \u2248 12.25 feet.\n\nLength = 10 \u00d7 2.45 \u2248 24.50 feet.\n\nThen, area = 24.50 \u00d7 12.25 \u2248 300.125 square feet, which is close enough to 300, considering rounding.\n\nAlternatively, for more precision, \u221a6 \u2248 2.44949, so width = 5 \u00d7 2.44949 \u2248 12.24749 feet, and length = 10 \u00d7 2.44949 \u2248 24.4949 feet, giving area = 24.4949 \u00d7 12.24749 \u2248 300.000 square feet.\n\nSo, the dimensions are approximately 12.25 feet in width and 24.50 feet in length.\n\nAlternatively, in exact terms, width = 5\u221a6 feet, and length = 10\u221a6 feet.\n\nBut I think the numerical approximation is more practical for real-world applications.\n\nSo, the room is about 12.25 feet wide and 24.50 feet long.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe dimensions of the room are \\boxed{12.25 \\text{ feet} \\times 24.50 \\text{ feet}}."
