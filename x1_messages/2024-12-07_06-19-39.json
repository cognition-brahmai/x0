The expression is:\n\n((3 * 4)^2 - (5 + 7) * 2) / 9\n\nFirst, I'll do the operations inside the parentheses.\n\nStarting with 3 * 4:\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nSo, (3 * 4)^2 = 12^2 = 144\n\nNext, 5 + 7:\n\n5 + 7 = 12\n\nThen, (5 + 7) * 2 = 12 * 2 = 24\n\nNow, plug these back into the expression:\n\n(144 - 24) / 9\n\nSubtract 144 - 24:\n\n144 - 24 = 120\n\nFinally, divide by 9:\n\n120 / 9 = 13.333...\n\nSo, the answer is approximately 13.333, or more precisely, 13 and one-third.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13.\\overline{3}} \\]"
