You mentioned that a dog has 4 legs and you have 3 cats, and then you asked how many birds you have. I'm a bit confused because dogs, cats, and birds are different types of animals, and having cats doesn't necessarily relate to having birds. Could you please clarify what you're asking? Maybe there's a specific relationship or a puzzle you're trying to solve involving these animals? I'm here to assist you, so feel free to provide more details."
