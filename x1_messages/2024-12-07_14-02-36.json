        "content": "Fireworks are a spectacular display of chemistry in action, combining principles from physics, chemistry, and engineering to create the dazzling arrays of colors and sounds that we enjoy during celebrations.\n\nAt their core, fireworks consist of shells that are launched into the air using a mortar system. These shells contain a variety of components, including gunpowder (also known as black powder), which is used both to propel the shell into the air and to ignite the effects within the shell.\n\nThe colors in fireworks are produced by the process of incandescence and luminescence. Incandescence occurs when a substance is heated to a high temperature and emits light as a result of its increased energy state. Different elements and compounds emit light at specific wavelengths when heated, which correspond to different colors.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Strontium salts produce red colors.\n\n- Calcium salts produce orange colors.\n\n- Sodium salts produce yellow colors.\n\n- Barium salts produce green colors.\n\n- Copper salts produce blue colors.\n\n- Aluminum, magnesium, and titanium produce white or silver colors.\n\nThese color-producing compounds are mixed with the fuel and oxidizer in the firework's payload. When ignited, the heat from the combustion reaction causes these compounds to reach high temperatures, resulting in the emission of colored light.\n\nIn addition to colors, fireworks also produce a variety of sounds. The primary source of the loud bangs and whistles comes from the rapid expansion of hot gases produced by the combustion of the firework's ingredients. This rapid expansion creates a shock wave in the air, which we perceive as sound.\n\nSome fireworks also contain additional chemicals that produce whistling or humming sounds. These are typically composed of a mixture of fuel and oxidizer that burns at a controlled rate, creating a high-pitched sound as the gas escapes through small holes in the firework casing.\n\nOverall, the science behind fireworks is a fascinating interplay of chemical reactions, heat, light, and sound, all carefully engineered to create a breathtaking visual and auditory experience.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n1. \"Fireworks: The Science and Spectacle of Pyrotechnics\" by John A.
