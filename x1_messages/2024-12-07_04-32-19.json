Here's a PowerShell script that lists all services running on a Windows machine, including their status and start type, sorted by service name:\n\n```powershell\nGet-Service | Select-Object Name, Status, StartType | Sort-Object Name\n```\n\nLet me explain what this script does:\n\n1. `Get-Service`: This cmdlet retrieves all services on the local computer.\n\n2. `Select-Object Name, Status, StartType`: This selects only the Name, Status, and StartType properties of each service.\n\n3. `Sort-Object Name`: This sorts the output by the service name in ascending order.\n\nYou can run this script in PowerShell to get the list of services sorted by name, showing their status and start type.\n\nIf you need any further customization or have any other questions, feel free to ask!"
