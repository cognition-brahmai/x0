        "content": "Tang is a powdered drink mix that was developed by General Foods in 1957, several years before the Apollo missions. It was not specifically created for NASA or the space program. However, Tang gained popularity and widespread recognition after it was used by astronauts during the Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s. The association with NASA and space exploration helped to boost Tang's sales and make it a household name."
