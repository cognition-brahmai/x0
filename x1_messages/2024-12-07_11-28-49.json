        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a group of 50 people, and 30% of them are left-handed. Then, 3 more left-handed people join the group, and I need to find out what percentage of the group will be left-handed after that.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many people are left-handed in the original group. Since 30% of 50 people are left-handed, I can calculate that by multiplying 50 by 30%.\n\nBut wait, percentages can be tricky sometimes. To make sure I'm doing this right, I recall that 30% is the same as 30 per 100, or 0.3 in decimal form. So, 50 times 0.3 should give me the number of left-handed people initially.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 50 times 0.3 is 15. So, there are 15 left-handed people in the original group.\n\nNow, 3 more left-handed people join the group. So, the new number of left-handed people will be 15 plus 3, which is 18.\n\nNext, I need to find out the total number of people in the group after these 3 people join. Originally, there were 50 people, so adding 3 more makes it 53 people in total.\n\nNow, to find the percentage of left-handed people in the new group, I need to divide the number of left-handed people by the total number of people and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nSo, that's 18 divided by 53, multiplied by 100.\n\nLet me calculate that. First, 18 divided by 53. I don't have a calculator right now, so I'll do this manually.\n\n18 divided by 53 is approximately 0.3396. Then, multiplying that by 100 gives me about 33.96%.\n\nSo, the percentage of left-handed people in the group after the 3 new people join is approximately 33.96%.\n\nBut maybe I should check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the initial number of left-handed people: 30% of 50 is indeed 15.\n\nThen, adding 3 more left-handed people brings it to 18.\n\nTotal number of people becomes 53.\n\nSo, 18 divided by 53 is approximately 0.3396, and multiplying by 100 gives 33.96%.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of proportions to see if it makes sense.\n\nInitially, 15 out of 50 were left-handed, which is 30%.\n\nAdding 3 left-handed people increases the number of left-handed people to 18, and the total people to 53.\n\nSo, the new percentage should be higher than 30%, which it is, at 33.96%.\n\nMoreover, to check if 33.96% is reasonable, I can estimate.\n\nIf the original group had 15 left-handed people out of 50, and we add 3 more left-handed people and 3 total people, the percentage should increase, but not by too much.\n\n3 out of the new total of 53 is roughly 5.66% (since 5% of 50 is 2.5, and 6% of 50 is 3), but that's not directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about it, the increase in left-handed people is 3 out of the new total of 53, which should increase the percentage by approximately 5.66%, but that doesn't directly help here.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way to think about it is to calculate the difference in percentages.\n\nOriginally, it was 30%, and now it's 33.96%, so the increase is about 3.96 percentage points.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nWell, adding 3 left-handed people to a group of 50 should increase the percentage of left-handed people.\n\nIf the group was 15 left-handed out of 50, that's 30%.\n\nAdding 3 left-handed people makes it 18 out of 53.\n\nIs there a way to calculate the new percentage without dividing 18 by 53 directly?\n\nMaybe using proportional reasoning.\n\nLet's see, originally, the ratio of left-handed to total people is 15:50.\n\nAfter adding 3 left-handed people, it becomes 18:53.\n\nI can express this as a fraction: 18/53.\n\nTo convert that to a percentage, I need to find equivalent fractions with denominator 100.\n\nBut that seems complicated without a calculator.\n\nAlternatively, I can perform the division 18 divided by 53.\n\nLet me try long division.\n\n53 goes into 18 zero times, so I'll consider 180 divided by 53.\n\n53 times 3 is 159, which is less than 180.\n\nSubtracting 159 from 180 gives 21.\n\nBring down a zero to make it 210.\n\n53 goes into 210 three times (53 times 3 is 159).\n\nSubtracting 159 from 210 gives 51.\n\nBring down a zero to make it 510.\n\n53 goes into 510 nine times (53 times 9 is 477).\n\nSubtracting 477 from 510 gives 33.\n\nBring down a zero to make it 330.\n\n53 goes into 330 six times (53 times 6 is 318).\n\nSubtracting 318 from 330 gives 12.\n\nSo, the decimal is approximately 0.3396.\n\nMultiplying by 100 gives 33.96%.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of left-handed people in the group after the 3 new people join is approximately 33.96%.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33.96\\%} \\]"
