In her quest to unlock the secrets of quantum mechanics, she inadvertently tears open a rift to a parallel universe\u2014a world where time flows in reverse.\n\nAs she crosses over, Elara finds herself in a chilling mirror of her own existence. Here, memories are forged in the future and lived in the past. History is rewritten daily, and the very concept of cause and effect is turned on its head.
