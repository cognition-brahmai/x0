        "content": "D. To resist lateral forces due to wind or seismic activity\n\nShear walls are an integral part of structural engineering, particularly in buildings designed to withstand lateral forces such as those caused by high winds or earthquakes. Their primary function is to provide stability and resistance against these horizontal loads, helping to prevent the building from swaying or collapsing under stress.\n\nOption A, supporting vertical loads, is typically the role of columns and beams in a building's structure. While shear walls can also support some vertical loads, their main purpose is to handle lateral forces.\n\nOption B, resisting wind forces, is indeed part of what shear walls do, but it's more accurate to say they resist lateral forces in general, which include both wind and seismic activities. Therefore, option D is more comprehensive.\n\nOption C, providing aesthetic appeal, is not related to the functional purpose of shear walls. While architectural design can incorporate shear walls in aesthetically pleasing ways, their primary role is structural.\n\nOption E, none of the above, is incorrect because option D accurately describes the primary purpose of shear walls.\n\nIn summary, shear walls are crucial for resisting lateral forces due to wind or seismic activity, ensuring the stability and safety of a structure."
