        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train traveling from City A to City B at a constant speed. It stops for 15 minutes halfway through the journey due to a technical issue, and the total travel time is 2 hours and 15 minutes. We need to find out how long the journey would take without any stops.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's given:\n\n- The train travels at a constant speed.\n\n- It stops for 15 minutes halfway through the journey.\n\n- Total travel time with the stop is 2 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nWe need to find the travel time without any stops.\n\nLet's denote the total travel time without stops as \\( t \\) hours.\n\nSince the train stops halfway through the journey, that means it has traveled half the distance when it stops for 15 minutes.\n\nNow, the total travel time with the stop is 2 hours and 15 minutes, which is 2.25 hours.\n\nSo, the equation considering the stop is:\n\n\\[ \\text{travel time without stop} + \\text{stop time} = \\text{total travel time} \\]\n\n\\[ t + \\frac{15}{60} = 2.25 \\]\n\nWait, but this seems too straightforward. Let me check.\n\nThe stop is 15 minutes, which is 0.25 hours. So:\n\n\\[ t + 0.25 = 2.25 \\]\n\nThen, \\( t = 2.25 - 0.25 = 2 \\) hours.\n\nBut, I feel like there's more to this problem. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the stop affects the total time, and I need to consider the constant speed.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the distance between City A and City B as \\( d \\) kilometers.\n\nSince the train travels at a constant speed, let's denote the speed as \\( v \\) km/h.\n\nWithout any stops, the travel time would be:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{d}{v} \\]\n\nWith the stop, the travel time is 2 hours and 15 minutes, which is 2.25 hours.\n\nNow, the train stops for 15 minutes halfway through the journey. Halfway means at \\( \\frac{d}{2} \\) kilometers.\n\nThe time to travel half the distance is:\n\n\\[ t_1 = \\frac{d/2}{v} = \\frac{d}{2v} \\]\n\nThen, it stops for 15 minutes, which is 0.25 hours.\n\nThen, it travels the remaining half distance:\n\n\\[ t_2 = \\frac{d/2}{v} = \\frac{d}{2v} \\]\n\nSo, the total travel time with the stop is:\n\n\\[ t_1 + \\text{stop time} + t_2 = \\frac{d}{2v} + 0.25 + \\frac{d}{2v} = \\frac{d}{v} + 0.25 \\]\n\nWe know that this total time is 2.25 hours:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{v} + 0.25 = 2.25 \\]\n\nBut \\( \\frac{d}{v} \\) is the travel time without stops, which is \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ t + 0.25 = 2.25 \\]\n\nSo, \\( t = 2.25 - 0.25 = 2 \\) hours.\n\nWait, this matches my earlier calculation. So, the travel time without stops is 2 hours.\n\nBut maybe the problem is trying to trick me into thinking that the stop affects the speed or something. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the train changes speed after the stop or something, but the problem says it travels at a constant speed.\n\nWait, the problem says \"at a constant speed,\" so the speed doesn't change.\n\nTherefore, my calculation seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 2 hours.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation.\n\nSuppose the train stops for 15 minutes at the halfway point in terms of time, not distance. But the problem says \"halfway through the journey,\" which probably refers to distance.\n\nAlternatively, if \"halfway through the journey\" refers to time, not distance, that could change things.\n\nLet me check.\n\nIf \"halfway through the journey\" means half the time, then the train stops after half the travel time.\n\nBut the problem says \"halfway through the journey,\" which typically means half the distance.\n\nAssuming it's half the distance, my previous calculation holds.\n\nAlternatively, let's assume it's half the time.\n\nSuppose the total travel time without stops is \\( t \\) hours.\n\nThen, halfway in time would be at \\( \\frac{t}{2} \\) hours.\n\nThe distance covered in that time is \\( v \\times \\frac{t}{2} \\).\n\nThen, it stops for 15 minutes, and then continues for the remaining \\( \\frac{t}{2} \\) hours.\n\nBut the total travel time with the stop is 2.25 hours:\n\n\\[ \\frac{t}{2} + 0.25 + \\frac{t}{2} = t + 0.25 = 2.25 \\]\n\nAgain, \\( t = 2 \\) hours.\n\nSo, regardless of whether \"halfway through the journey\" refers to distance or time, the calculation leads to the same result.\n\nTherefore, the travel time without stops is 2 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
