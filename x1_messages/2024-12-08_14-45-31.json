        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a plane flying between two cities, City A and City B. It says the plane flies at an average speed of 500 miles per hour on the way to City B, and it takes 10 hours for that journey. Then, on the return trip from City B to City A, the plane's average speed increases to 550 miles per hour, and I need to find out how long that return trip will take.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the distance between City A and City B. Since I know the speed and the time for the trip to City B, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, distance from City A to City B is 500 miles per hour \u00d7 10 hours = 5000 miles.\n\nNow, for the return trip, the speed increases to 550 miles per hour, and I need to find the time it takes to cover the same distance of 5000 miles.\n\nI can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance \u00f7 Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 5000 miles \u00f7 550 miles per hour\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n5000 \u00f7 550 = ?\n\nWell, 550 \u00d7 9 = 4950\n\n5000 - 4950 = 50\n\nSo, it's 9 hours plus 50 miles divided by 550 miles per hour.\n\n50 \u00f7 550 = 0.0909... hours\n\nTo convert that decimal to minutes, I can multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).\n\n0.0909 \u00d7 60 \u2248 5.4545 minutes\n\nSo, approximately 9 hours and 5.45 minutes.\n\nBut maybe I can express it in hours with decimals.\n\n50 \u00f7 550 = 5/55 = 1/11 hours\n\nSo, total time is 9 + 1/11 hours.\n\nAs a decimal, 1/11 \u2248 0.0909, so total time is approximately 9.0909 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I can keep it as a fraction: 9 1/11 hours.\n\nBut maybe I should check if there's a more precise way to calculate it.\n\nLet me divide 5000 by 550 directly.\n\n5000 \u00f7 550 = 5000 / 550 = 500 / 55 = 100 / 11 \u2248 9.0909 hours\n\nYes, that matches what I had earlier.\n\nSo, the return trip will take approximately 9.09 hours.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider if there are any other factors, like wind resistance or something, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It seems straightforward.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure that the distance is indeed 5000 miles. Let me double-check that.\n\nGiven: speed to City B is 500 mph, time is 10 hours.\n\nDistance = 500 \u00d7 10 = 5000 miles. That seems correct.\n\nNow, return speed is 550 mph.\n\nTime = distance / speed = 5000 / 550 = 5000 \u00f7 550.\n\nYes, that's approximately 9.0909 hours.\n\nAlternatively, 5000 \u00f7 550 = 500 \u00f7 55 = 100 \u00f7 11 \u2248 9.0909 hours.\n\nSo, the return trip will take approximately 9.09 hours.\n\nBut maybe I can express it in hours and minutes for better understanding.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, 0.0909 hours is approximately 5.45 minutes.\n\nSo, roughly 9 hours and 5 minutes.\n\nSo, the return trip will take about 9 hours and 5 minutes.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9.09 \\text{ hours}} \\]\n\nor approximately 9 hours and 5 minutes."
