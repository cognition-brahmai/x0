Instead, it's suspended in the muscles of the neck. The hyoid plays a crucial role in swallowing and, interestingly, also in speech, although its exact role in speech might be a bit more complex. It provides attachment points for muscles involved in moving the tongue and larynx, which are essential for both swallowing and speaking. So, while it's not directly involved in producing sound, it does support the structures that do."
