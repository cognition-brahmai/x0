        "content": "So the factory produces 400 cars every month, and each car needs 4 tires. I need to find out how many tires the factory needs in total each month.\n\nOkay, this seems straightforward. If each car requires 4 tires, then for 400 cars, I just need to multiply the number of cars by the number of tires per car.\n\nSo, that would be 400 cars times 4 tires per car. Let's do the multiplication.\n\n400 \u00d7 4 = 1600.\n\nSo, the factory needs 1600 tires monthly for its production.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I should consider? Is there any chance that some cars might need extra tires, or maybe some tires are defective and need to be replaced?\n\nBut according to the problem, each car requires 4 tires, and there's no mention of any extras or defects. So, I think 1600 is the straightforward and correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, let's think about it differently. If the factory produces 400 cars each month, and each car needs 4 tires, then the total number of tires needed is indeed 400 multiplied by 4, which is 1600.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that for every car produced, 4 tires are needed. So, for 400 cars, it's 400 sets of 4 tires each, totaling 1600 tires.\n\nI think that's clear. So, the factory needs 1600 tires monthly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1600} \\]"
