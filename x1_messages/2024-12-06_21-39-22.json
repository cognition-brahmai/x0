        "content": "So the garden is currently rectangular, with a length of 25 meters and a width of 10 meters. The owner wants to increase the area by 50% but only by making the garden longer, not wider. I need to find out what the new length should be to achieve that.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate the current area of the garden. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length by the width, right? So, current area equals length times width.\n\nCurrent area = 25 meters * 10 meters = 250 square meters.\n\nNow, the owner wants to increase this area by 50%. So, I need to find what 50% of the current area is and then add that to the current area to find the new area.\n\n50% of 250 square meters is 0.5 * 250 = 125 square meters.\n\nSo, the new area should be 250 + 125 = 375 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as multiplying the current area by 1.5 to increase it by 50%.\n\n250 * 1.5 = 375 square meters. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nNow, the owner wants to achieve this increased area only by increasing the length, not the width. The width stays the same at 10 meters.\n\nSo, the new area will be new length times the same width.\n\nLet\u2019s call the new length \u201cL\u201d.\n\nSo, L * 10 meters = 375 square meters.\n\nNow, I can solve for L.\n\nL = 375 square meters / 10 meters = 37.5 meters.\n\nSo, the new length should be 37.5 meters.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nOriginal area: 25 * 10 = 250 sq m.\n\nNew area: 37.5 * 10 = 375 sq m.\n\nThat\u2019s an increase of 125 sq m, which is indeed 50% of the original area.\n\nAlternatively, 375 is 1.5 times 250, which is also a 50% increase.\n\nSo, yes, the new length should be 37.5 meters.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there\u2019s another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I think about the percentage increase in length needed to achieve a 50% increase in area, given that only the length is changing.\n\nThe area is proportional to the length when the width is constant.\n\nSo, if I increase the length by some factor, the area increases by the same factor.\n\nI want the area to increase by 1.5 times, so the length should also increase by 1.5 times.\n\nOriginal length is 25 meters.\n\n1.5 * 25 = 37.5 meters.\n\nAgain, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation.\n\nLet L be the new length.\n\nThen, L * 10 = 1.5 * (25 * 10)\n\nL * 10 = 1.5 * 250\n\nL * 10 = 375\n\nL = 375 / 10\n\nL = 37.5 meters.\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think I\u2019m confident with this.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there\u2019s any other factor that could affect the area, like the shape changing or something, but the problem says it\u2019s still a rectangle with only the length increased.\n\nSo, no, that shouldn\u2019t be an issue.\n\nTherefore, the new length should be 37.5 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{37.5 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
