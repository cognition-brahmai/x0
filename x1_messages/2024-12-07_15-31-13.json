        "content": "To create a C++ program that reads a text file and counts the frequency of each word, sorted by frequency in descending order, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Include necessary headers**: You'll need headers for file I/O, string manipulation, and sorting.\n2. **Read the file**: Open and read the content of the text file.\n3. **Tokenize the text into words**: Split the text into individual words.\n4. **Count the frequency of each word**: Use a data structure to count how many times each word appears.\n5. **Sort the words by frequency**: Sort the words based on their frequency in descending order.\n6. **Output the results**: Print the words and their frequencies.\n\nHere's a sample implementation:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <string>\n#include <map>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n\n// Function to split the text into words\nstd::vector<std::string> splitTextIntoWords(const std::string& text) {\n    std::vector<std::string> words;\n    std::string word;\n    for (char ch : text) {\n        if (isalnum(ch)) {\n            word += tolower(ch);\n        } else if (!word.empty()) {\n            words.push_back(word);\n            word.clear();\n        }\n    }\n    if (!word.empty()) {\n        words.push_back(word);\n    }\n    return words;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::string fileName;\n    std::cout << \"Enter the name of the text file: \";\n    std::cin >> fileName;\n\n    // Open the file\n    std::ifstream file(fileName);\n    if (!file.is_open()) {\n        std::cerr << \"Error opening file: \" << fileName << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Read the entire content of the file\n    std::string content((std::istreambuf_iterator<char>(file)), std::istreambuf_iterator<char>());\n    file.close();\n\n    // Split the content into words\n    std::vector<std::string> words = splitTextIntoWords(content);\n\n    // Count the frequency of each word\n    std::map<std::string, int> wordFrequency;\n    for (const std::string& word : words) {\n        wordFrequency[word]++;\n    }\n\n    // Move the word-frequency pairs to a vector for sorting\n    std::vector<std::pair<std::string, int>> freqVec(wordFrequency.begin(), wordFrequency.end());\n\n    // Sort the vector by frequency in descending order\n    std::sort(freqVec.begin(), freqVec.end(), [](const auto& a, const auto& b) {\n        return a.second > b.second;\n    });\n\n    // Output the results\n    std::cout << \"Word frequencies sorted by frequency (descending):\" << std::endl;\n    for (const auto& pair : freqVec) {\n        std::cout << pair.first << \": \" << pair.second << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Headers Included**:\n   - `<iostream>` for input and output operations.\n   - `<fstream>` for file stream operations.\n   - `<string>` for string manipulation.\n   - `<map>` to store word frequencies.\n   - `<vector>` to store words and frequency pairs.\n   - `<algorithm>` for sorting.\n\n2. **Reading the File**:\n   - The user is prompted to enter the file name.\n   - The file is opened using `std::ifstream`, and its content is read into a string.\n\n3. **Tokenizing the Text**:\n   - The `splitTextIntoWords` function processes the text, splits it into words, converts them to lowercase, and stores them in a vector.\n\n4. **Counting Word Frequencies**:\n   - A `std::map<std::string, int>` is used to count the occurrences of each word.\n\n5. **Sorting by Frequency**:\n   - The word-frequency pairs are moved to a `std::vector` and sorted in descending order based on frequency.\n\n6. **Output**:\n   - The sorted list of words and their frequencies is printed.\n\nThis program provides a straightforward way to analyze word frequencies in a text file and present the results in a sorted manner."
