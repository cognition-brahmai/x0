Then, each of the remaining 4 people shakes hands with everyone else once.\n\nWait, but when I shake hands with someone, that's one handshake, and then if another person shakes hands with someone else, that's another handshake, and so on.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Maybe I can use the formula for the number of handshakes in a group of people. I think the formula is n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of people.\n\nSo, in this case, n is 5.\n\nSo, total handshakes would be 5*4/2 = 10.\n\nBut let's double-check that. If I shake hands with 4 people, and then each of the remaining 4 people shakes hands with 3 others (since they've already shaken hands with me), that would be 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as each person shaking hands with every other person exactly once, which again leads to n(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
