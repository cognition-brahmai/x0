        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a square has an area of 64 square meters, and I need to find the length of its diagonal. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one of its sides. So, if the area is 64 square meters, that means the length of one side squared equals 64. Mathematically, that's:\n\n\\[ \\text{side}^2 = 64 \\]\n\nTo find the length of the side, I need to take the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\text{side} = \\sqrt{64} \\]\n\nThe square root of 64 is 8, so the side length is 8 meters.\n\nNow, I need to find the length of the diagonal. I remember that in a square, the diagonal forms a right-angled triangle with the two sides of the square. So, I can use the Pythagorean theorem here. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (which would be the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nSo, if I denote the diagonal as \\( d \\), and the sides as \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), both of which are 8 meters, then:\n\n\\[ d^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\]\n\nSince \\( a = b = 8 \\), this becomes:\n\n\\[ d^2 = 8^2 + 8^2 \\]\n\\[ d^2 = 64 + 64 \\]\n\\[ d^2 = 128 \\]\n\nTo find \\( d \\), I take the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{128} \\]\n\nNow, 128 can be simplified. I know that 128 is 64 times 2, and since the square root of 64 is 8, this becomes:\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{64 \\times 2} \\]\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{64} \\times \\sqrt{2} \\]\n\\[ d = 8\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal is \\( 8\\sqrt{2} \\) meters.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe using the properties of a square's diagonals. I recall that in a square, the diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other at right angles. Also, the relationship between the side length and the diagonal is that the diagonal is equal to the side length multiplied by the square root of 2.\n\nSo, using that property directly:\n\n\\[ d = a\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nWhere \\( a \\) is the side length, which is 8 meters:\n\n\\[ d = 8\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nThat matches what I got earlier using the Pythagorean theorem. Good, it's consistent.\n\nIs there a way to rationalize the answer further? Well, \\( 8\\sqrt{2} \\) is already a simplified form. Unless I need a decimal approximation, this should be acceptable.\n\nBut just to check, what's the numerical value of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\)? It's approximately 1.414. So, multiplying that by 8:\n\n\\[ 8 \\times 1.414 = 11.312 \\]\n\nSo, the diagonal is approximately 11.312 meters, but since the problem likely expects an exact value, \\( 8\\sqrt{2} \\) meters is the precise answer.\n\nLet me double-check my steps to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. Found the side length by taking the square root of the area: \\( \\sqrt{64} = 8 \\) meters.\n\n2. Applied the Pythagorean theorem to find the diagonal: \\( d^2 = 8^2 + 8^2 = 128 \\), so \\( d = \\sqrt{128} = 8\\sqrt{2} \\) meters.\n\n3. Verified using the direct formula for the diagonal of a square: \\( d = a\\sqrt{2} = 8\\sqrt{2} \\) meters.\n\nEverything checks out. I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8\\sqrt{2}} \\]"
