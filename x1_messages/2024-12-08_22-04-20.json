Let's think about how to use these tools step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably search the web for information about the Eiffel Tower. So, I'll use the WebSearch tool with the query \"history of the Eiffel Tower and who was its architect.\" That should give me some relevant results.\n\nPlan: Search the web for information about the Eiffel Tower's history and architect.\n#E1 = WebSearch[\"history of the Eiffel Tower and who was its architect\"]\n\nOnce I have the search results, I need to extract the text from those pages to read and understand the information. So, I'll take the URLs from #E1 and use the TextExtractor tool on them.\n\nPlan: Extract text from the web pages obtained from the search.\n#E2 = TextExtractor[#E1]\n\nNow, with the text extracted, I need to find the specific answers to my questions: what is the history of the Eiffel Tower and who was its architect. This might be a lot of text, so I should use the QA tool to ask these questions directly, using the extracted text as context.\n\nPlan: Use the QA tool to answer questions based on the extracted text.\n#E3 = QA[\"What is the history of the Eiffel Tower?\", given context #E2]\n#E4 = QA[\"Who was the architect of the Eiffel Tower?\", given context #E2]\n\nFinally, I can compile the answers from #E3 and #E4 to give a complete response to the user's question.\n\nFinal Answer: Combining the information from #E3 and #E4 to provide a detailed history of the Eiffel Tower and identify its architect."
