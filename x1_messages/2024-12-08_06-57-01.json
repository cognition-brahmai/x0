        "content": "So the factory produces 200 units per day, and each unit costs $10 to make. It operates 25 days a month. To find the total monthly production cost, I need to calculate the total number of units produced in a month and then multiply that by the cost per unit.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many units are produced in a month. Since the factory produces 200 units per day and operates 25 days a month, the total monthly production would be:\n\n200 units/day \u00d7 25 days/month = 5,000 units/month\n\nNow, each unit costs $10 to produce. So, the total monthly production cost would be:\n\n5,000 units/month \u00d7 $10/unit = $50,000/month\n\nTherefore, the total monthly production cost is $50,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50000} \\]"
