        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a tree that doubles its height every year, and after 5 years, it's 32 feet tall. We need to find out how tall it was after the first year.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the tree to double its height every year. That means each year, the tree's height is twice what it was the year before. So, if I know the height in one year, I can find the height in the previous year by dividing by 2.\n\nGiven that after 5 years, the tree is 32 feet tall, I can work backwards to find the height in previous years.\n\nLet's denote the height of the tree after year n as h_n.\n\nSo, h_5 = 32 feet.\n\nSince the tree doubles its height every year, h_5 = 2 * h_4.\n\nTherefore, h_4 = h_5 / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16 feet.\n\nSimilarly, h_4 = 2 * h_3, so h_3 = h_4 / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8 feet.\n\nContinuing this pattern:\n\nh_3 = 2 * h_2 \u2192 h_2 = h_3 / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4 feet.\n\nh_2 = 2 * h_1 \u2192 h_1 = h_2 / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2 feet.\n\nSo, the height of the tree after the first year was 2 feet.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the growth pattern over the 5 years.\n\nLet's say the initial height of the tree was h_0 (before any years have passed).\n\nThen, each year, the height doubles:\n\nAfter 1 year: h_1 = 2 * h_0\n\nAfter 2 years: h_2 = 2 * h_1 = 4 * h_0\n\nAfter 3 years: h_3 = 2 * h_2 = 8 * h_0\n\nAfter 4 years: h_4 = 2 * h_3 = 16 * h_0\n\nAfter 5 years: h_5 = 2 * h_4 = 32 * h_0\n\nWe know that h_5 = 32 feet, so:\n\n32 * h_0 = 32 feet\n\nTherefore, h_0 = 32 / 32 = 1 foot.\n\nSo, the initial height was 1 foot.\n\nNow, the height after the first year is h_1 = 2 * h_0 = 2 * 1 = 2 feet.\n\nThis matches what I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of exponential growth, the height after n years is h_n = h_0 * 2^n.\n\nGiven h_5 = 32 feet, we have:\n\nh_5 = h_0 * 2^5 = 32 * h_0 = 32 feet\n\nSo, h_0 = 1 foot.\n\nThen, h_1 = 1 * 2^1 = 2 feet.\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier result.\n\nWait a minute, but let's consider if the tree doubles its height every year starting from year 1, or if the initial height is before year 1.\n\nSometimes, these problems can be a bit tricky with the timing.\n\nLet me re-express this.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- At year 0: initial height h_0\n\n- At year 1: h_1 = 2 * h_0\n\n- At year 2: h_2 = 2 * h_1 = 4 * h_0\n\n- At year 3: h_3 = 2 * h_2 = 8 * h_0\n\n- At year 4: h_4 = 2 * h_3 = 16 * h_0\n\n- At year 5: h_5 = 2 * h_4 = 32 * h_0\n\nGiven that h_5 = 32 feet, then h_0 = 1 foot.\n\nTherefore, h_1 = 2 feet.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if the tree doubles its height every year, and after 5 years it is 32 feet, we can think of it as:\n\nh_5 = h_0 * 2^5 = 32 feet\n\nSo, h_0 = 32 / 32 = 1 foot\n\nh_1 = 1 * 2 = 2 feet.\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about it another way.\n\nSuppose the tree's height sequence over the years is:\n\nYear 0: h_0\n\nYear 1: 2 * h_0\n\nYear 2: 4 * h_0\n\nYear 3: 8 * h_0\n\nYear 4: 16 * h_0\n\nYear 5: 32 * h_0\n\nGiven that at year 5, the height is 32 feet, then h_0 = 1 foot.\n\nTherefore, after the first year, the height was 2 feet.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the tree doubles its height at the end of each year, then starting from h_0, after year 1, it becomes 2 * h_0, which would be 2 feet if h_0 is 1 foot.\n\nThis all confirms that the height after the first year was 2 feet.\n\nI think this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
