        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nA factory produces 1000 widgets per day, and 5% of them are defective. So, out of 1000 widgets, 5% are defective. That means the number of defective widgets is 5% of 1000, which is 50 widgets. And the number of non-defective widgets is 950.\n\nNow, a customer buys 10 widgets at random. I need to find the probability that exactly 2 of them are defective.\n\nOkay, so this sounds like a hypergeometric distribution problem. Hypergeometric distribution is used when you're sampling without replacement from a finite population. Here, the population is the 1000 widgets, with 50 defective and 950 non-defective. The customer is sampling 10 widgets, and we want exactly 2 defective ones.\n\nThe formula for the hypergeometric probability is:\n\n\\[ P(k) = \\frac{ \\binom{K}{k} \\binom{N - K}{n - k} }{ \\binom{N}{n} } \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( N \\) is the total number of items in the population (1000 widgets),\n\n- \\( K \\) is the number of success states in the population (50 defective widgets),\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of items sampled (10 widgets),\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of observed successes (2 defective widgets).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ P(2) = \\frac{ \\binom{50}{2} \\binom{950}{8} }{ \\binom{1000}{10} } \\]\n\nFirst, I need to calculate \\( \\binom{50}{2} \\), which is the number of ways to choose 2 defective widgets out of 50.\n\n\\[ \\binom{50}{2} = \\frac{50!}{2!(50 - 2)!} = \\frac{50 \\times 49}{2 \\times 1} = 1225 \\]\n\nNext, \\( \\binom{950}{8} \\), which is the number of ways to choose 8 non-defective widgets out of 950.\n\nCalculating \\( \\binom{950}{8} \\) directly might be cumbersome, so I'll leave it for now.\n\nThen, \\( \\binom{1000}{10} \\), which is the total number of ways to choose 10 widgets out of 1000.\n\nAgain, calculating this directly is messy, so I'll keep it in terms of combinations.\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\n\\[ P(2) = \\frac{1225 \\times \\binom{950}{8}}{\\binom{1000}{10}} \\]\n\nAlternatively, since the population is large and the sample size is small compared to the population, I could approximate this with a binomial distribution, which might be easier to compute.\n\nIn the binomial distribution, the probability of exactly \\( k \\) successes in \\( n \\) trials is:\n\n\\[ P(k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k} \\]\n\nWhere \\( p \\) is the probability of success on a single trial. Here, \\( p = 0.05 \\), since 5% of the widgets are defective.\n\nSo, for \\( n = 10 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ P(2) = \\binom{10}{2} (0.05)^2 (0.95)^8 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( \\binom{10}{2} \\):\n\n\\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10!}{2! \\times 8!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = 45 \\]\n\nThen, \\( (0.05)^2 = 0.0025 \\)\n\nAnd \\( (0.95)^8 \\) is approximately 0.6634204312890625\n\nSo, plugging these in:\n\n\\[ P(2) = 45 \\times 0.0025 \\times 0.6634204312890625 \\]\n\nFirst, \\( 45 \\times 0.0025 = 0.1125 \\)\n\nThen, \\( 0.1125 \\times 0.6634204312890625 \\approx 0.07464188714671875 \\)\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.0746, or 7.46%.\n\nBut I should check how good this approximation is. Since the population is 1000 and the sample size is 10, the finite population correction factor could be considered, but in practice, when \\( n / N < 0.05 \\), the binomial approximation is acceptable. Here, \\( n / N = 10 / 1000 = 0.01 \\), which is less than 0.05, so the approximation should be pretty good.\n\nTo get a more exact answer using the hypergeometric formula, I could use a calculator or software that can handle large factorials or combinations, but for now, I'll stick with the binomial approximation.\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 2 out of 10 widgets are defective is approximately 7.46%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.0746} \\]"
