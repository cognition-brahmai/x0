        "content": "Let's see. So, we have buses leaving from station A to station B every 15 minutes and from station B to station A every 20 minutes. Both buses travel at the same speed and take 60 minutes to reach their destinations. I need to find out how long it will take for them to meet after they start traveling.\n\nFirst, I should understand the setup. Buses are leaving from A to B every 15 minutes and from B to A every 20 minutes. They travel at the same speed and take 60 minutes to cover the distance between A and B.\n\nSince they travel at the same speed and take 60 minutes to cover the distance, the distance between A and B is the same in both directions. Let's denote the distance between A and B as D. Since time is 60 minutes and speed is the same for both, let's denote the speed as S. So, D = S * 60.\n\nNow, I need to find out when these buses will meet after they start traveling. I think I need to consider their relative speeds and the time they start.\n\nWait, but there are multiple buses leaving at different times. Maybe I should consider one specific bus from A and one specific bus from B and see when they meet.\n\nLet\u2019s pick a specific bus leaving from A at time T=0. Then buses from B are leaving every 20 minutes, starting from T=0 as well.\n\nSince both buses travel at the same speed, S, and the distance is D = S * 60.\n\nNow, let's consider the bus from A and the bus from B both leaving at T=0.\n\nTheir combined speed is S + S = 2S.\n\nThe time it takes for them to meet is D / (2S) = (S*60) / (2S) = 30 minutes.\n\nWait, but that seems straightforward. Is there something I'm missing?\n\nOh, but there are multiple buses leaving at different times. Maybe I need to consider the schedule.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the time when any bus from A and any bus from B will meet.\n\nBut in the problem, it says \"how long will it take for them to meet after they start traveling?\" I think it's referring to the time after they start traveling for a specific pair of buses, one from A and one from B.\n\nIf that's the case, then the answer is 30 minutes, as calculated earlier.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Maybe I need to consider the schedules and find the time when a bus from A and a bus from B will meet, considering their departure times.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that buses from A leave at times T = 0, 15, 30, 45, etc. minutes.\n\nAnd buses from B leave at times T = 0, 20, 40, 60, etc. minutes.\n\nNow, let's consider the positions of these buses over time.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe I should stick to the initial approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of relative speed.\n\nSince both buses are moving towards each other, their relative speed is S + S = 2S.\n\nThe distance between them is D = S * 60.\n\nSo, time to meet is D / (2S) = 30 minutes.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the frequency of buses and find the least common multiple or something like that.\n\nBut I don't think that's necessary here, because we're dealing with the travel time of individual buses, not the schedule of multiple buses.\n\nWait, but the schedule might affect when buses from A and B cross paths.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nImagine a timeline where buses from A leave every 15 minutes and buses from B leave every 20 minutes.\n\nI need to find the first time when a bus from A and a bus from B have been traveling for some time and their positions coincide.\n\nWait, but since they travel at the same speed and take 60 minutes to reach the destination, their speeds are equal.\n\nSo, if they start at the same time, they will meet at the halfway point, which is at 30 minutes.\n\nBut what if they start at different times?\n\nFor example, a bus from A leaves at T=0, and a bus from B leaves at T=0.\n\nThey will meet at T=30.\n\nSimilarly, a bus from A leaves at T=15, and a bus from B leaves at T=20.\n\nWhen do they meet?\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider all possible pairs of buses and find the earliest time they meet.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is simply 30 minutes, assuming that we are considering buses that start simultaneously from A and B.\n\nI think that's the intended interpretation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 30 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
