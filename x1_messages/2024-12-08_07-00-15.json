Hurricane Sally now a dangerous Category 2 is crawling towards landfall with intense wind and torrential rain. The storm is moving at about three kilometers an hour, and experts warn some areas could now see months of rain in just two days, meaning potentially life-threatening flooding. Already, tens of thousands of people have lost power. Damage is being reported throughout the region. Mike Evans is the deputy director of Mobile County\\'s emergency management agency. He is with us this hour on the line. Mr. Evans, thank you for taking the time to be with us. If you look at the latest forecast, what are you expecting now from Sally in terms of the intensity of the winds and the rain in the coming hours and days? MIKE EVANS, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, MOBILE COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (via telephone): Good morning, John. Thank you for having me. We actually just got an update from our National Weather Service office here in Mobile. And Sally has intensified. They just informed us that it strengthened to a Category 2. So it is still moving very slowly. And it\\'s moving at a north-northeast movement at about two miles per hour. So strengthening, moving slowly, and we are just bracing for impact down here on the Gulf Coast. VAUSE: And Mike, while you are talking, it\\'s 33 minutes past midnight there in Mobile, Alabama and we\\'re looking at live pictures from where you are. We can see the wind which is, you know, really hammering those trees in the shot there. When you\\'ve been out, when you\\'ve had a look around, how would you describe the intensity of the effects already, at this early stage? EVANS: Yes. So we\\'ve -- especially our extreme coastal areas down in Mobile. We have Dauphin Island, which is our barrier island. They\\'ve been under the effects since really last night, John. And tropical storm force winds, you know, all through last night today, they\\'ve been experiencing a lot of surge, and also our communities right there on the coast like the city of Bayou La Batre. EVANS: We have also experienced some pretty good flooding in Mobile Bay along the interstate causeway. They shut the tunnel down, the Bankhead Tunnel, earlier today. So you know, a lot of effects right now in Mobile County. We have about 34,000 residents without power. That\\'s kind of developed over the day and, you know, it\\'s just -- with this thing moving slow, you know, it\\'s just going to continue to cause problems for us. VAUSE: Yes. When we\\'re talking about a storm surge and potential flash flooding measured, you know, in feet, what exactly do you do to prepare for that? EVANS: Well, you know, we share our surge maps. You know, we get updated surge maps through FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers on a yearly basis. And we share those with our residents that live in those coastal areas. We also have predetermined evacuation zones. And what we will do is when we see that surge that\\'s going to become a problem in those areas we invite -- or we actually suggest and even the elected officials can mandate that the citizens need to evacuate to an area with higher ground to just make them safe. You know, we have an old saying. It\\'s called \"run from the water, hide from the wind\". So under those surge conditions, when we give those evacuation orders, you know, we are asking them literally to run from the water. VAUSE: Mike, we thank you for being with us and taking the time to give us that update. And we wish you all the very best for the hours and days ahead. Mike Evans there. EVANS: Yes, sir. Thank you. VAUSE: Take care. Thank you. Well, the wildfires raging across the West Coast of the U.S. are pushing firefighters beyond exhaustion, and creating the worst air quality on the planet. So far, at least 36 people have died. Authorities are bracing for more fatalities. CNN\\'s Martin Savidge has the latest. MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: In Oregon, firefighters loading up and heading out, including a lead hot shot team trying to rein in the massive Riverside Fire outside Portland -- one of three dozen blazes burning in the state. The effects of the historic western wildfire is now spreading far beyond the region. Seen from space, smoke from the fires streaming across the country, reaching the skies of New York. The smoke even forced flight cancellations. Schools in northern Oregon remain closed as millions shelter in place from smoke-choked air classified a health hazard. SENATOR JEFF MERKLEY, (D-OR): These fires in Oregon, they\\'re apocalyptic. Going through a couple of towns that had been absolutely incinerated. SAVIDGE: Oregon\\'s governor says the state is stretched to its limits. Last week, it had 3,000 firefighters. This week, nearly double that number and still more are needed. And in an ominous sign for the first time in its history, Oregon is preparing to use its mobile morgue with a team of 75 forensic specialists. CAPT. TIM FOX, OREGON STATE POLICE: They will -- take those trailers up and send them in a central location. At this time, we are able to take in any fire victims from all the counties in this facility. SAVIDGE: With as many as 50 people listed as missing or unaccounted for, the state is bracing for a rising death toll, even after the flames subside. FOX: What\\'s behind this facility is so that we could give families closure. SAVIDGE: In neighboring California, where the fires have been even deadlier, the Campos family considers themselves fortunate to be alive. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is a fire coming down to burn all my barn. SAVIDGE: First trying to fight the flames on their farm before fleeing. On the outskirts of Los Angeles at the Bobcat Fire, a desperate battle is shaping up between firefighters and flames at the historic Mount Wilson Observatory. The next 24 hours could be decisive. CAPT. DAVE GILLOTTE, LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT: We\\'ve got a lot of dirty brush and dirty growth laddered and layered, and so it burns deep down in there and climbs through the trees and then it rolls with the hills. Luckily, we don\\'t have any wind driving the fire right now. SAVIDGE: Back outside Portland, in the near deserted neighborhoods of Estacada, volunteers deliver food to those refusing to leave. TONY DIFRANCISCO, ESTACADA RESIDENT: We all had a pretty grim outlook and the fact that the firefighters stopped it is nothing short of amazing. I think it\\'s a miracle. SAVIDGE: Across Oregon and much of the west, they will need a lot more miracles in the days and weeks to come. VAUSE: Thanks to Martin Savidge there reporting from Oregon. Louisville, Kentucky has agreed to pay a record settlement of $12 million to the family of Breonna Taylor, the young woman fatally shot by police as they mistakenly stormed her apartment in March. Taylor\\'s death led to months of protest across the United States. It\\'s all part of the Black Lives Matter movement protesting against police brutality. VAUSE: The city admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to institute sweeping police reforms -- all part of that settlement. Taylor\\'s family will continue to push for criminal charges against the officers involved. TAMIKA PALMER, BREONNA TAYLOR\\'S MOTHER: As significant as today is, it\\'s only the beginning of getting full justice for Breonna. It\\'s time to move forward with the criminal charges, because she deserves that and much more. Her beautiful spirit and personality is working through all of us on the ground. So please, continue to say her name. VAUSE: A warning, our next report contains images some viewers may find disturbing. It\\'s from an ambush of two L.A. County sheriff\\'s deputies. They were shot multiple times last weekend by an unknown assailant. And after that attack came some tremendous courage. Sara Sidner has details. SARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: An incredible show of bravery. A 31- year-old L.A. sheriff\\'s deputy profusely bleeding from a bullet to the face is seen helping save her 24-year-old partner. She applies a tourniquet to his bloodied arm and helps him move behind a pillar to avoid taking on more fire. Both have already been shot multiple times. Surveillance video shows the ambush. A shooter fires into their car while they sit in their vehicle outside a metro stop in Compton. MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI (D), LOS ANGELES: The female deputy, after getting shot both of them four or five times, with a broken jaw in the face, stepped out, gave a tourniquet to her fellow deputy who had been shot in the head as well, probably saved his life while calling for help. SIDNER: She and her partner had just become deputies 14 months ago. The mother of a six-year-old is seen here as she proudly graduated from the police academy in 2019. As they are recovering from their injuries at the hospital, a callous call for their death by a gathering of about five people outside the hospital. SIDNER: The leader of the group that calls itself L.A.\\'s Africa Town Coalition says he hopes the shooting is in retaliation for the shooting of black and brown people by the LASD, the most recent shooting sparked protests in Compton, when deputies shot Dijon Kizzee for an alleged bicycle violation. The family says Kizzee was shot in the back. An investigation is still underway. KEVIN WHARTON PRICE, AFRICA TOWN COALITION LOS ANGELES: So if this is the start of retribution then I think this is a very good start. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everybody is set to go, I assume. SIDNER: The LASD has faced serious controversy over the years. Its sheriff convicted of lying in 2016 was fire and jailed. There has also been a lawsuit brought accusing deputies of forming a gang inside the department. The most recent accusation and complaint by a deputy, a whistleblower said in a deposition, deputies formed a gang called The Executioners in Compton. He says they sported the same tattoos and used excessive force on suspects. ART GONZALEZ, FORMER L.A. SHERIFF\\'S DEPUTY: Me, being a field training officer, you know, I\\'m a supervisor and I have to report this behavior. SIDNER: The Sheriff Deputies Union responded to those claims. RON HERNANDEZ, ASSOCIATION OF LOS ANGELES DEPUTY SHERIFFS: The accusations of there being criminal gangs within the sheriff\\'s department, that\\'s ridiculous. SIDNER: California Congresswoman Karen Bass responding to the union and the horrific shooting. REP. KAREN BASS (D-CA): That was horrific that happened. But that gang issue is one that surfaces in the sheriff\\'s department every few years. And for the union to say that they don\\'t believe that exists, I think is a problem. SIDNER: But they both agree, even the idea of retaliation like this is sickening. HERNANDEZ: So the people -- the group that came out here and screamed \"we hope you die\", that in itself is also pathetic. Maybe not as bad as the guy that actually pulled the trigger, but it\\'s just as bad. SIDNER: The reward for anyone with information that leads to an arrest in this horrific shooting has now risen to $275,000. Sara Sidner, CNN -- Linwood, California. VAUSE: And with that a short break here. You are watching CNN. Back in a moment.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 10 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
