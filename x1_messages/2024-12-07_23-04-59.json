Let me try again.\n\nWhy did the dollar bill go to the doctor?\n\nBecause it was feeling a little crumpled!\n\nHmm, maybe not the best joke. How about this one?\n\nWhy did the banker go to art school?\n\nBecause he wanted to learn how to make money!\n\nOkay, that one is a bit old, but I hope it makes you smile. If you have any other questions or need more jokes, feel free to ask!"
