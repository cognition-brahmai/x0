        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the factory produces 250 units every day, and each unit sells for $35, with a production cost of $20 per unit. We need to find out the total profit after 30 days.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what profit is. Profit is basically the revenue from selling the products minus the cost of producing them. So, profit per unit would be the selling price minus the production cost.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nProfit per unit = Selling price per unit - Production cost per unit\n\nProfit per unit = $35 - $20 = $15\n\nSo, for each unit sold, the factory makes $15 in profit.\n\nNow, the factory produces 250 units every day. So, the daily profit would be:\n\nDaily profit = Profit per unit * Number of units produced per day\n\nDaily profit = $15 * 250 = $3,750\n\nThat means every day, the factory makes $3,750 in profit.\n\nNext, we need to find out the total profit after 30 days. So, we'll multiply the daily profit by the number of days.\n\nTotal profit = Daily profit * Number of days\n\nTotal profit = $3,750 * 30\n\nNow, let's calculate that:\n\n$3,750 * 30 = $112,500\n\nSo, the total profit after 30 days is $112,500.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I should consider? Are there any other costs involved, like overhead costs or something? The problem only mentions the production cost per unit and the selling price per unit, so I think this is sufficient.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total revenue and total cost over 30 days and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue to get the profit.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of units produced in 30 days:\n\nTotal units = Units per day * Number of days\n\nTotal units = 250 * 30 = 7,500 units\n\nNext, calculate the total revenue:\n\nTotal revenue = Selling price per unit * Total units\n\nTotal revenue = $35 * 7,500 = $262,500\n\nThen, calculate the total production cost:\n\nTotal production cost = Production cost per unit * Total units\n\nTotal production cost = $20 * 7,500 = $150,000\n\nNow, calculate the profit:\n\nProfit = Total revenue - Total production cost\n\nProfit = $262,500 - $150,000 = $112,500\n\nOkay, this matches the earlier calculation. So, the total profit after 30 days is indeed $112,500.\n\nI think that's clear. No other factors are mentioned in the problem, so I don't need to consider anything else.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{112500} \\]"
