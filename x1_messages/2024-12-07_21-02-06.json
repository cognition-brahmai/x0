        "content": "So the restaurant serves 20 tables every hour. It operates for 10 hours each day and 7 days a week. I need to find out how many tables it can serve in a whole week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many tables are served in one day. Since it serves 20 tables per hour and is open for 10 hours, I can multiply those two numbers to get the daily total.\n\nSo, 20 tables/hour \u00d7 10 hours/day = 200 tables/day.\n\nNow, to find out the weekly total, I need to multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:\n\n200 tables/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 1400 tables/week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the total number of hours the restaurant is open in a week and then multiply that by the number of tables served per hour.\n\nFirst, find the total operating hours in a week:\n\n10 hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 70 hours/week.\n\nThen, multiply the total hours by the number of tables served per hour:\n\n70 hours/week \u00d7 20 tables/hour = 1400 tables/week.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, the restaurant can serve 1400 tables in a week.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation. For example, are there any breaks or closing times within those 10 hours? The problem says it operates 10 hours a day, so I'll assume it's continuous operation during those hours without any breaks.\n\nAlso, it's important to make sure that the units are consistent. Here, we're dealing with tables per hour, hours per day, and days per week, so multiplying them step by step gives us the total tables per week.\n\nSo, my final answer is 1400 tables per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1400} \\]"
