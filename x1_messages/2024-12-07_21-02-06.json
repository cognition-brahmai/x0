        "content": "That's an interesting question! So, you're asking about a Scandinavian country that has the world's largest number of islands, specifically over 267,000 islands. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst off, when we talk about Scandinavian countries, we usually mean Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. These countries are known for their northern locations and beautiful landscapes, including many islands.\n\nNow, I know that Denmark has a lot of islands. In fact, Denmark consists of the Jutland peninsula and around 406 named islands, but I don't think that totals up to 267,000. So, probably not Denmark.\n\nFinland is another Scandinavian country with a long coastline and numerous lakes, which might have a lot of islands. But I'm not sure if it has that many.\n\nIceland is an island itself, but it doesn't have that many subsidiary islands. So, maybe not Iceland.\n\nNorway is known for its fjords and coastline, which is very indented, and it's said to have a lot of islands. I think Norway might be a candidate.\n\nSweden also has a lot of islands, especially in the Stockholm archipelago, which is famous for its thousands of islands.\n\nBut among these, I believe Norway has the most islands. I recall that Norway has a coastline that's incredibly long because of all the fjords and inlets, which likely contributes to a high number of islands.\n\nTo be precise, according to some sources, Norway has over 267,000 islands, which is more than any other country in the world. That sounds like a lot, but considering the length of its coastline and the fjord system, it makes sense.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the Scandinavian country with the world's largest number of islands, totaling over 267,000, is Norway.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Norway}} \\]"
