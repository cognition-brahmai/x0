        "content": "Let's see. So, we have three friends: Alice, Bob, and Carol, and they're playing a game. Alice has 3 times as many points as Bob, and Carol has half the number of points that Bob has. Together, they have a total of 72 points. I need to figure out how many points each one has.\n\nOkay, first, I should probably assign variables to represent their points. Let's say Bob has B points. Since Alice has 3 times as many points as Bob, Alice has 3B points. And Carol has half the points of Bob, so Carol has B/2 points.\n\nNow, the total points they have together is 72. So, Alice's points plus Bob's points plus Carol's points equal 72. That is:\n\n3B + B + B/2 = 72\n\nHmm, now I need to solve for B. Let's combine like terms. First, 3B + B is 4B, and then plus B/2.\n\nSo, 4B + B/2 = 72\n\nTo make it easier, maybe I can combine these terms. To add 4B and B/2, I need a common denominator. The common denominator for 1 and 2 is 2. So, 4B is the same as 8B/2.\n\nSo, 8B/2 + B/2 = 9B/2\n\nTherefore, 9B/2 = 72\n\nNow, to solve for B, I can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator:\n\n9B = 144\n\nThen, divide both sides by 9:\n\nB = 16\n\nSo, Bob has 16 points.\n\nNow, Alice has 3 times Bob's points, so Alice has 3 * 16 = 48 points.\n\nAnd Carol has half of Bob's points, so Carol has 16 / 2 = 8 points.\n\nLet me check if these add up to 72: 48 + 16 + 8 = 72. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, Alice has 48 points, Bob has 16 points, and Carol has 8 points.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Alice: } 48, \\text{ Bob: } 16, \\text{ Carol: } 8} \\]"
