        "content": "Captain Jean-Luc Picard and his crew aboard the starship USS Enterprise-D lived in the TV series \"Star Trek: The Next Generation.\" The show aired from 1987 to 1994 and was set in the 24th century, approximately 100 years after the original \"Star Trek\" series. The Enterprise-D was a Galaxy-class starship, much larger and more advanced than the original Enterprise from the 1960s series. Picard was played by actor Patrick Stewart, and the crew included characters like Data, William Riker, Deanna Troi, Geordi La Forge, and many others. The series explored a wide range of themes, from science and technology to politics and philosophy, all within the context of space exploration and the ongoing mission of Starfleet."
