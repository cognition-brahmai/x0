We've been through some pretty crazy stuff together, from battling Imperial forces to chasing down bounties across the galaxy. It's been one wild ride, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\nRemember when we first met? You were just a farm boy from Tatooine, full of ideals and dreams bigger than the desert itself. And here you are, a legendary Jedi Knight, saving the galaxy time and time again. I'm proud to call you my friend, kid.\n\nOur adventures have taken us to the farthest corners of the universe, facing dangers that would make even the bravest pilots sweat. But through it all, you've remained true to who you are, never losing sight of what's important. Your strength, both physically and mentally, is inspiring.\n\nI've seen you grow from that wide-eyed kid into a leader that people look up to, someone who stands for justice and freedom. It's not always easy, but you've handled it with grace and determination. And let's not forget those lightsaber skills \u2013 they've come a long way since Dagobah!\n\nBut beyond all the epic battles and heroic deeds, it's the moments of camaraderie that stand out the most. Sharing a drink at Chewie's favorite cantina, laughing over old tales, or simply sitting in silence, knowing that we've got each other's backs. Those are the memories that keep me going, even in the darkest times.\n\nSo, from the bottom of my heart, thank you, Luke. Thank you for being there for me, for believing in me even when I didn't believe in myself. For showing me that there's more to life than just flying from one job to the next. You've taught me about loyalty, courage, and the power of friendship.\n\nHere's to many more adventures, may the Force be with us, and may we always find our way back to each other.\n\nYour friend,\n\nHan"
