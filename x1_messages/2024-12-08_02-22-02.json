        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train going from City A to City B at a constant speed. It stops for 15 minutes right in the middle of the journey due to a technical issue and then continues at the same speed to reach City B. The total time for the journey with the stop is 2 hours and 15 minutes. We need to find out how long the journey would have taken without the stop.\n\nFirst, let's convert all the times to minutes to make calculations easier. 2 hours and 15 minutes is equal to (2 * 60) + 15 = 135 minutes.\n\nNow, let's denote the total time without the stop as T minutes. Since the train stops for 15 minutes halfway through the journey, the total time with the stop is T + 15 minutes. According to the problem, this equals 135 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nT + 15 = 135\n\nSolving for T, we get:\n\nT = 135 - 15 = 120 minutes\n\nSo, the journey without the stop would have taken 120 minutes, which is 2 hours.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's double-check this. The problem says the train stops halfway through the journey. Does this mean that the stop occurs after half the distance or after half the time? Since the train is traveling at a constant speed, half the distance would indeed be halfway in terms of time as well. So, my initial approach should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about it in terms of time segments. The journey can be divided into two equal parts in terms of time since the speed is constant. So, each half of the journey would take T/2 minutes.\n\nThe train stops for 15 minutes after the first half, and then continues for another T/2 minutes to reach the destination.\n\nSo, the total time with the stop is:\n\n(T/2) + 15 + (T/2) = T + 15 minutes\n\nAnd we know this equals 135 minutes:\n\nT + 15 = 135\n\nT = 120 minutes\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can approach it by considering the speed of the train. Let's denote the distance between City A and City B as D kilometers, and the speed of the train as S kilometers per minute.\n\nFirst half of the distance: D/2 kilometers at speed S, time = (D/2)/S = D/(2S) minutes.\n\nStop time: 15 minutes.\n\nSecond half of the distance: D/2 kilometers at speed S, time = D/(2S) minutes.\n\nTotal time with stop: D/(2S) + 15 + D/(2S) = D/S + 15 minutes.\n\nAccording to the problem, this equals 135 minutes:\n\nD/S + 15 = 135\n\nSo, D/S = 120 minutes.\n\nBut D/S is the total time without the stop, which again gives us T = 120 minutes.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, we arrive at the same conclusion that the journey without the stop would have taken 120 minutes, or 2 hours.\n\nI think this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
