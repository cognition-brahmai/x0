        "content": "Let's see. The company has an annual revenue of $1,200,000. It spends 30% on salaries, 20% on rent, and 10% on marketing. I need to find out how much money is left after these expenses.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how much is spent on each category.\n\nSalaries: 30% of $1,200,000.\n\nRent: 20% of $1,200,000.\n\nMarketing: 10% of $1,200,000.\n\nThen, I'll add up these expenses and subtract the total from the annual revenue to find out what's left.\n\nLet me start with salaries.\n\n30% of $1,200,000 is calculated as 0.30 multiplied by $1,200,000.\n\n0.30 \u00d7 1,200,000 = $360,000.\n\nNext, rent.\n\n20% of $1,200,000 is 0.20 \u00d7 1,200,000 = $240,000.\n\nThen, marketing.\n\n10% of $1,200,000 is 0.10 \u00d7 1,200,000 = $120,000.\n\nNow, I'll add up these expenses:\n\nSalaries: $360,000\n\nRent: $240,000\n\nMarketing: $120,000\n\nTotal expenses = $360,000 + $240,000 + $120,000 = $720,000.\n\nFinally, subtract the total expenses from the annual revenue:\n\n$1,200,000 - $720,000 = $480,000.\n\nSo, the company has $480,000 left after these expenses.\n\nWait a minute, is there a simpler way to calculate this?\n\nActually, yes. Since the company spends 30% on salaries, 20% on rent, and 10% on marketing, that adds up to 60% of the revenue.\n\n30% + 20% + 10% = 60%.\n\nSo, the remaining percentage of the revenue is 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nTherefore, the remaining money is 40% of $1,200,000.\n\n40% of $1,200,000 is 0.40 \u00d7 1,200,000 = $480,000.\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the company has $480,000 left after these expenses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{480000} \\]"
