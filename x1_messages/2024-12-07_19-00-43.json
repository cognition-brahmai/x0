        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the train first travels at 60 miles per hour for 2 hours. To find out how far it went during this time, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, for the first part:\n\nDistance1 = 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nThen, the train stops for 1 hour. During this time, it doesn't travel any distance, so:\n\nDistance2 = 0 miles\n\nAfter that, it continues traveling at 40 miles per hour for another 3 hours. Again, using the formula:\n\nDistance3 = 40 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 120 miles\n\nNow, to find the total distance traveled, I need to add up all the distances:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 + Distance3 = 120 miles + 0 miles + 120 miles = 240 miles\n\nSo, the train traveled a total of 240 miles.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. The train travels at different speeds and has a stop in between. Maybe I should consider the entire journey.\n\nFirst part: 60 mph for 2 hours \u2192 120 miles\n\nStop: 1 hour \u2192 0 miles\n\nSecond part: 40 mph for 3 hours \u2192 120 miles\n\nYes, adding them up gives 240 miles. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about the average speed or something, but I don't think that's necessary here because the speeds are given for specific intervals, and the stop is just a pause with no movement.\n\nSo, my final answer is 240 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
