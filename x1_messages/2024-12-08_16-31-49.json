Later, the manager realizes the room rate is only $25 and gives $5 to the bellboy to return to the guests. On the way to the room, the bellboy decides to keep $2 for himself and give each guest $1 back. So, each guest got $1 back: thus they each paid $9; bringing the total paid to $27. The bellboy has $2, totaling $29. Where is the missing dollar?"

        "content": "I've heard this puzzle before, and it's a classic one that tricks a lot of people. Let's break it down step by step to see where the misunderstanding lies.\n\nFirst, the three guests each pay $10, totaling $30. The manager realizes the room is only $25, so he gives $5 to the bellboy to return to the guests. The bellboy decides to keep $2 for himself and gives each guest $1 back, so each guest effectively paid $9, totaling $27.\n\nNow, the puzzle adds up the $27 paid by the guests and the $2 kept by the bellboy, making $29, and asks where the missing dollar is from the original $30.\n\nThe mistake here is in how the amounts are being added. The $27 includes the $25 for the room and the $2 the bellboy kept. You shouldn't add the $2 again to the $27 because it's already included in that amount.\n\nLet's look at it differently:\n\n- Total paid by guests: $27\n\n- This $27 goes to the hotel ($25) and the bellboy's pocket ($2).\n\nSo, $25 + $2 = $27.\n\nIf you want to account for the original $30:\n\n- $25 went to the hotel for the room.\n\n- $2 went to the bellboy.\n\n- $3 were returned to the guests ($1 each).\n\nSo, $25 + $2 + $3 = $30.\n\nThe error in the puzzle's accounting is that it adds the $27 (which already includes the $2 the bellboy kept) to the $2, making $29, which doesn't make sense because the $2 is already part of the $27.\n\nAnother way to think about it is:\n\nEach guest paid $9, totaling $27.\n\n- $25 goes to the hotel.\n\n- $2 goes to the bellboy.\n\nThere's no missing dollar; the math was just misapplied in the puzzle.\n\nI hope this clears up the confusion! This is a tricky one, but once you see how the amounts are being accounted for, it makes sense."
