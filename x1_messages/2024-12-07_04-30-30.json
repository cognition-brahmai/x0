        "content": "So the store has these bags that hold 4 apples each, and they've just gotten a big shipment of 1200 apples. They want to know how many full bags they can make from this shipment and if there are any apples left over that don't fill a whole bag.\n\nAlright, to figure this out, I think I need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag. So, that's 1200 apples divided by 4 apples per bag.\n\nLet me do the math: 1200 divided by 4.\n\nWell, 4 times 300 is 1200, right? So, 1200 divided by 4 equals 300. That means they can make 300 full bags of apples.\n\nBut the question also asks about any apples left over. Since 4 apples per bag times 300 bags equals exactly 1200 apples, there shouldn't be any apples left over.\n\nWait, just to double-check: 4 times 300 is indeed 1200. So, no remainder.\n\nTherefore, the store can make 300 full bags, and there will be 0 apples left over.\n\nI think that's the answer, but maybe I should consider if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of division with remainder. In mathematics, when you divide two numbers, you can express it as:\n\nDividend = (Divisor \u00d7 Quotient) + Remainder\n\nIn this case, the dividend is 1200 apples, the divisor is 4 apples per bag, the quotient would be the number of bags, and the remainder would be the leftover apples.\n\nSo, 1200 = (4 \u00d7 300) + 0\n\nYes, that matches what I thought earlier. 300 full bags and 0 leftover apples.\n\nI don't think there's anything else to consider here. It seems straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300 \\text{ full bags and } 0 \\text{ apples left over}} \\]"
