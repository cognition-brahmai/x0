        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. So, you want a Java application that calculates the factorial of a given number using both recursive and iterative methods. Right?\n\nFirst, let's understand what a factorial is. Factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It's denoted by n!. For example, 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nNow, there are two common ways to calculate factorial: recursively and iteratively.\n\nRecursive approach involves a function calling itself with a smaller value until it reaches a base case. For factorial, the base case is usually 0! = 1 or 1! = 1.\n\nIterative approach uses loops (like for or while) to calculate the product.\n\nI'll write a Java program that includes both methods and allows the user to choose which one to use.\n\nHere's a simple plan:\n\n1. Create a class, say, FactorialCalculator.\n\n2. Inside this class, define a recursive method to calculate factorial.\n\n3. Define an iterative method to calculate factorial.\n\n4. Write a main method to take user input and call the appropriate method based on user choice.\n\nLet's start by writing the recursive method.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Java application that calculates the factorial of a given number using both recursive and iterative approaches, follow the steps below:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Understanding Factorial**:\n   - The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. It is denoted by `n!`.\n   - For example, `5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120`.\n\n2. **Methods to Calculate Factorial**:\n   - **Recursive Approach**: A function calls itself with a smaller value until it reaches the base case (0! = 1 or 1! = 1).\n   - **Iterative Approach**: Uses a loop (for or while) to calculate the product.\n\n3. **Program Structure**:\n   - Create a class `FactorialCalculator`.\n   - Define a recursive method to calculate factorial.\n   - Define an iterative method to calculate factorial.\n   - Implement a `main` method to take user input and call the appropriate method based on user choice.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class FactorialCalculator {\n\n    // Recursive method to calculate factorial\n    public static long factorialRecursive(int n) {\n        if (n == 0) {\n            return 1;\n        } else {\n            return n * factorialRecursive(n - 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Iterative method to calculate factorial\n    public static long factorialIterative(int n) {\n        long result = 1;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n            result *= i;\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        try {\n            System.out.println(\"Enter a non-negative integer:\");\n            int number = scanner.nextInt();\n\n            if (number < 0) {\n                System.out.println(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\");\n                return;\n            }\n\n            System.out.println(\"Choose method to calculate factorial:\");\n            System.out.println(\"1. Recursive\");\n            System.out.println(\"2. Iterative\");\n            int choice = scanner.nextInt();\n\n            long result;\n            switch (choice) {\n                case 1:\n                    result = factorialRecursive(number);\n                    System.out.println(\"Factorial (Recursive): \" + result);\n                    break;\n                case 2:\n                    result = factorialIterative(number);\n                    System.out.println(\"Factorial (Iterative): \" + result);\n                    break;\n                default:\n                    System.out.println(\"Invalid choice.\");\n            }\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid input. Please enter a non-negative integer.\");\n        } finally {\n            scanner.close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Recursive Method**:\n   - Base case: If `n` is 0, return 1.\n   - Recursive case: Return `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n - 1`.\n\n2. **Iterative Method**:\n   - Initialize a result variable to 1.\n   - Use a for loop from 1 to `n`, multiplying the result by the loop variable in each iteration.\n\n3. **Main Method**:\n   - Take user input for the number and the method choice.\n   - Validate the input to ensure it's a non-negative integer.\n   - Call the appropriate factorial method based on user choice and display the result.\n   - Handle exceptions for invalid inputs.\n\nThis program provides a clear and straightforward way to calculate factorial using both recursive and iterative methods, allowing users to choose their preferred approach."
