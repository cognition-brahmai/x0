        "content": "So, there's this problem about bees in a beehive. It says that a bee enters an empty beehive and then doubles in number every minute. After 60 minutes, the beehive is full. And the question is, when was the beehive half full?\n\nOkay, let's try to understand this step by step. First, we have a beehive that starts empty, and at some point, one bee enters it. Then, every minute, the number of bees doubles. So, from that initial bee, the number goes like 1, 2, 4, 8, and so on, doubling each minute.\n\nNow, after 60 minutes, the beehive is full. That means that at the 60th minute, the number of bees reaches the maximum capacity of the beehive.\n\nThe question is asking when the beehive was half full. In other words, at what time was the number of bees half of the maximum capacity.\n\nHmm, doubling every minute, huh? That sounds like exponential growth. So, if the number of bees doubles every minute, that means that each minute, the beehive is twice as full as it was the minute before.\n\nSo, if at minute 60, the beehive is full, then at minute 59, it must have been half full. Because from minute 59 to minute 60, the number of bees doubles, going from half full to fully full.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. If at minute 59, the beehive was half full, and then in the next minute, the number of bees doubles, so it would become full. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any trick here. Maybe the initial bee entering the hive is at minute zero or something like that. Let's see.\n\nThe problem says \"a bee enters an empty beehive and then doubles in number every minute.\" So, the initial bee enters at time zero, and then every minute after that, the number of bees doubles.\n\nSo, at minute 0: 1 bee\n\nMinute 1: 2 bees\n\nMinute 2: 4 bees\n\n...\n\nMinute 60: 2^60 bees, which is the full capacity.\n\nSo, the full capacity is 2^60 bees.\n\nHalf of that would be 2^59 bees.\n\nNow, when was the beehive having 2^59 bees?\n\nLooking at the pattern:\n\nMinute 0: 1 = 2^0\n\nMinute 1: 2 = 2^1\n\nMinute 2: 4 = 2^2\n\n...\n\nMinute n: 2^n\n\nSo, at minute n, there are 2^n bees.\n\nWe need to find when there were 2^59 bees.\n\nSo, 2^n = 2^59\n\nTherefore, n = 59.\n\nSo, at minute 59, the beehive was half full.\n\nAnd then at minute 60, it doubled to 2^60, which is full.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"a bee enters an empty beehive and then doubles in number every minute.\"\n\nSo, the initial bee enters at time zero, and then each minute, the number doubles.\n\nSo, minute 0: 1 bee\n\nMinute 1: 2 bees\n\nMinute 2: 4 bees\n\n...\n\nMinute 59: 2^59 bees (half full)\n\nMinute 60: 2^60 bees (full)\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nBut maybe I should think about it differently to confirm.\n\nLet's think about the growth rate. Since the number of bees is doubling every minute, the beehive is also filling up at the same rate.\n\nSo, if it's full at minute 60, then one minute before that, it must have been half full, because doubling the number of bees from minute 59 to 60 would go from half to full.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the beehive's capacity to be C, then at minute 60, the number of bees is C.\n\nAt minute 59, it was C/2.\n\nAt minute 58, it was C/4.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, indeed, the beehive was half full at minute 59.\n\nWait, but let's think about the initial condition. The problem says \"a bee enters an empty beehive and then doubles in number every minute.\"\n\nSo, is the initial bee at time zero, or is there a different starting point?\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"a bee enters an empty beehive and then doubles in number every minute. After 60 minutes, the beehive is full.\"\n\nSo, if at time zero, there is 1 bee, and then every minute the number doubles.\n\nSo, time t (minutes) corresponds to number of bees: 2^t.\n\nWait, at time zero: 1 = 2^0.\n\nTime 1: 2 = 2^1.\n\nTime 2: 4 = 2^2.\n\n...\n\nTime 60: 2^60 = full beehive.\n\nYes, so at time t, number of bees is 2^t.\n\nTherefore, half full would be 2^60 / 2 = 2^59.\n\nSo, 2^t = 2^59 implies t = 59 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the beehive was half full at 59 minutes.\n\nBut let's consider if the doubling starts after the first bee enters.\n\nWait, the problem says \"a bee enters an empty beehive and then doubles in number every minute.\"\n\nSo, the initial bee enters at time zero, and then each minute, the number of bees doubles.\n\nSo, time 0: 1 bee\n\nTime 1: 2 bees\n\nTime 2: 4 bees\n\n...\n\nTime 59: 2^59 bees (half full)\n\nTime 60: 2^60 bees (full)\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if we think of the doubling as happening every minute starting from time zero, then at time zero, there is 1 bee.\n\nBut in exponential growth, sometimes the initial time is considered t=0 with initial value a, and at time t, the value is a * growth factor^t.\n\nIn this case, a=1, growth factor=2, so at time t, number of bees is 1 * 2^t.\n\nAt t=60, number of bees is 2^60, which is full.\n\nHalf full would be 2^59, which corresponds to t=59.\n\nSo, the beehive was half full at 59 minutes.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's think about the nature of exponential growth.\n\nIn exponential growth, the quantity doubles at regular intervals, so the beehive would be half full immediately before it becomes full.\n\nIn other words, since it doubles every minute, the beehive would go from half full to full in just one minute.\n\nTherefore, if it's full at 60 minutes, it must have been half full at 59 minutes.\n\nThis seems logical.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the number of bees at any minute is double the number in the previous minute.\n\nSo, if at minute 59 there are x bees, then at minute 60 there are 2x bees.\n\nIf at minute 60 the beehive is full, meaning 2x is the full capacity, then at minute 59, with x bees, the beehive was half full.\n\nTherefore, the beehive was half full at 59 minutes.\n\nSo, the answer should be that the beehive was half full at 59 minutes.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nMaybe the \"a bee enters an empty beehive\" is the starting point, and then \"doubles in number every minute\" starts after that.\n\nSo, perhaps at time t=0, one bee enters.\n\nThen, at t=1, the number doubles to 2.\n\nAt t=2, doubles to 4, and so on.\n\nIn this case, it's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial bee entering is considered as t=0, and then the first doubling happens at t=1.\n\nBut even then, it would still follow the same pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the doubling includes the initial bee.\n\nWait, let's try to model it mathematically.\n\nLet N(t) be the number of bees at time t minutes.\n\nN(0) = 1 (initial bee enters)\n\nN(1) = 2 * N(0) = 2\n\nN(2) = 2 * N(1) = 4\n\n...\n\nN(t) = 2^t\n\nGiven that N(60) = 2^60 = full beehive.\n\nHalf full would be 2^59.\n\nSo, N(t) = 2^59 when t=59.\n\nTherefore, the beehive was half full at 59 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the doubling happens at the end of each minute.\n\nSo, at t=0, 1 bee.\n\nAt the end of minute 1, it doubles to 2.\n\nAt the end of minute 2, it doubles to 4.\n\n...\n\nAt the end of minute 59, it doubles to 2^60, which is full.\n\nIn this case, at the end of minute 59, it becomes full.\n\nSo, at the end of minute 58, it was 2^59, which is half full.\n\nBut then, at the end of minute 59, it doubles to 2^60, becoming full.\n\nSo, in this interpretation, the beehive was half full at the end of minute 59, and full at the end of minute 60.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, if at the end of minute 59, it doubles to 2^60 and becomes full, then at the end of minute 58, it was 2^58, which is quarter full.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the timing.\n\nLet me clarify.\n\nIf doubling happens at the end of each minute, then:\n\nAt t=0: 1 bee\n\nEnd of minute 1: doubles to 2\n\nEnd of minute 2: doubles to 4\n\n...\n\nEnd of minute 59: doubles to 2^60, which is full.\n\nSo, at the end of minute 59, it becomes full.\n\nTherefore, at the end of minute 58, it was 2^59, which is half of 2^60.\n\nSo, in this case, the beehive was half full at the end of minute 58.\n\nBut the problem says \"after 60 minutes, the beehive is full.\"\n\nSo, if doubling happens at the end of each minute, then after 60 minutes (i.e., at the end of minute 60), the beehive is full.\n\nThat would mean:\n\nEnd of minute 60: full, which is 2^60.\n\nEnd of minute 59: 2^59, which is half full.\n\nTherefore, in this interpretation, the beehive was half full at the end of minute 59.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"after 60 minutes, the beehive is full.\"\n\nSo, if doubling happens at the end of each minute, then after 60 minutes, it's full, meaning at the end of minute 60, it's full.\n\nTherefore, at the end of minute 59, it was half full.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, in this case, the beehive was half full at the end of minute 59.\n\nAlternatively, if doubling happens continuously or instantly at the start of each minute, the conclusion remains the same.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the exact timing of the doubling, the beehive was half full exactly one minute before it became full.\n\nSo, if it's full at 60 minutes, it was half full at 59 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the beehive was half full at 59 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{59} \\]"
