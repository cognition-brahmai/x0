        "content": "So I have this question here: If I read at an average speed of 250 words per minute and I want to finish a book that has 80,000 words, how many hours will it take me to complete the book?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to find out how many minutes it will take to read the entire book. Since I read 250 words per minute, and the book has 80,000 words, I can find the total reading time in minutes by dividing the total number of words by my reading speed.\n\nSo, time in minutes = total words / reading speed\n\nThat would be:\n\ntime in minutes = 80,000 words / 250 words per minute\n\nLet me do that calculation.\n\n80,000 divided by 250 is... hmm, 250 times 320 is 80,000. So, 320 minutes.\n\nNow, I need to convert minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\ntime in hours = time in minutes / 60\n\nSo,\n\ntime in hours = 320 / 60\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\n320 divided by 60 is 5.333..., which is 5 hours and 0.333... of an hour.\n\nNow, 0.333... of an hour is 20 minutes, because 0.333... times 60 minutes is 20 minutes.\n\nSo, total time is 5 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nBut maybe I should express it in decimal form for hours. 20 minutes is one-third of an hour, so it's approximately 5.333 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to be more precise, 20 minutes is exactly one-third of an hour, so it's 5 and one-third hours.\n\nBut in decimal form, it's 5.333... hours.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total words are 80,000, reading speed is 250 words per minute.\n\nTime in minutes: 80,000 / 250 = 320 minutes.\n\nThen, time in hours: 320 / 60.\n\nYes, 320 divided by 60 is 5.333... hours.\n\nAlternatively, 5 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nSo, it will take me either 5.333 hours or 5 hours and 20 minutes to finish the book.\n\nI think both are acceptable, but perhaps the question expects the answer in hours.\n\nSo, approximately 5.33 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I can express it as 5 hours and 20 minutes, which might be more intuitive for some people.\n\nBut since the question asks for hours, I'll go with 5.33 hours.\n\nWait, but I should probably round it to two decimal places, so 5.33 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to be more precise, I can say 5.333 hours, but I think two decimal places are sufficient.\n\nSo, it will take approximately 5.33 hours to complete the book.\n\nLet me just confirm if there's another way to look at this.\n\nAnother approach could be to find out how many pages I read per minute, but since the question is in words, it's easier to stick with words per minute.\n\nAlternatively, if I know the average number of words per page, I could find out the number of pages and then calculate the time, but that seems unnecessary since the total words are already given.\n\nSo, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 5.33 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5.33} \\]"
