        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 men and 20 women in the room, so a total of 30 people. Half of the men have glasses, so that's 5 men with glasses. One-third of the women have glasses, which is about 6 women with glasses. So, total people with glasses are 5 men + 6 women = 11 people. Therefore, the number of people without glasses is the total people minus those with glasses: 30 - 11 = 19 people without glasses.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. One-third of 20 women is exactly 6.666, but you can't have a fraction of a person, so maybe it's 6 or 7 women with glasses. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that only whole persons have glasses. So, one-third of 20 is 20/3 = 6 and 2/3, but since we can't have two-thirds of a person, maybe it's 6 women with glasses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's rounded up to 7. But I think in such problems, fractions of people aren't considered, so maybe it's 6 women with glasses.\n\nSo, 5 men + 6 women = 11 with glasses, total people without glasses is 30 - 11 = 19.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that one-third of 20 is exactly 6 and 2/3, perhaps the problem allows for that, but I think it's safe to assume 6 women have glasses.\n\nSo, my final answer is 19 people without glasses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{19} \\]"
