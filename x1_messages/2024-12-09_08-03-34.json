        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, the car travels at an average speed of 50 miles per hour for 6 hours. To find the distance covered in that part of the trip, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo for the first part:\n\nDistance1 = 50 mph \u00d7 6 hours = 300 miles\n\nThen, the car stops for 2 hours. During this time, it's not moving, so it doesn't cover any distance. So, Distance2 = 0 miles.\n\nAfter the stop, the car continues traveling at 40 miles per hour for another 4 hours. Again, using the formula:\n\nDistance3 = 40 mph \u00d7 4 hours = 160 miles\n\nNow, to find the total distance covered, we add up all the distances:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 + Distance3 = 300 miles + 0 miles + 160 miles = 460 miles\n\nSo, the total distance covered is 460 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{460} \\]"
