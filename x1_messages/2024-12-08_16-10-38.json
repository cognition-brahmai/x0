        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the train first travels at 60 miles per hour for 2 hours. To find out how far it goes in that time, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, for the first part:\n\nDistance\u2081 = 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nThen, the train stops for an hour. During this hour, it doesn't travel any distance, so the distance added here is 0 miles.\n\nAfter that, the train starts again and travels at 40 miles per hour for another 2 hours. So, for this part:\n\nDistance\u2082 = 40 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 80 miles\n\nNow, to find the total distance traveled, I just need to add up all the distances:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance\u2081 + Distance\u2082 = 120 miles + 80 miles = 200 miles\n\nSo, the train has traveled a total of 200 miles.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. The train travels 60 mph for 2 hours, which is 120 miles. Then it stops for an hour, so no additional distance. Finally, it travels 40 mph for 2 hours, which is 80 miles. Adding those up gives 120 + 80 = 200 miles. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the entire journey in terms of time and speed. But since there's a stop, I have to consider the actual moving times.\n\nFirst segment: 2 hours at 60 mph \u2192 120 miles\n\nStop: 1 hour \u2192 0 miles\n\nSecond segment: 2 hours at 40 mph \u2192 80 miles\n\nTotal time traveled: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 hours\n\nBut the stop doesn't contribute to the distance, so only the moving times matter.\n\nTherefore, the total distance is indeed 200 miles.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
