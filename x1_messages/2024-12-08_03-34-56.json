        "content": "So there are 5 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes happen in total. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I think about person A. Person A shakes hands with persons B, C, D, and E. So that's 4 handshakes for person A.\n\nNext, person B has already shaken hands with person A, so person B only needs to shake hands with persons C, D, and E. That's 3 additional handshakes.\n\nThen, person C has already shaken hands with persons A and B, so person C only shakes hands with persons D and E. That's 2 more handshakes.\n\nAfter that, person D has already shaken hands with persons A, B, and C, so person D only shakes hands with person E. That's 1 more handshake.\n\nFinally, person E has already shaken hands with everyone else, so no new handshakes there.\n\nNow, if I add up all these handshakes: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 handshakes in total.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to calculate this without listing everyone out? I remember something about combinations. Combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, which makes sense here because a handshake between person A and person B is the same as between person B and person A.\n\nSo, the formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n is 5 (people), and k is 2 (since a handshake involves 2 people).\n\nSo, C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!) = (120) / (2 * 6) = 120 / 12 = 10.\n\nThat matches the earlier total I calculated manually. So, there are 10 handshakes in total.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's try this with a smaller number. Suppose there are 3 people: A, B, and C. Each shakes hands with the other two.\n\nA shakes hands with B and C (2 handshakes).\n\nB has already shaken hands with A, so only shakes hands with C (1 handshake).\n\nC has already shaken hands with A and B, so no new handshakes.\n\nTotal handshakes: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nUsing the combination formula: C(3, 2) = 3! / (2! * 1!) = 6 / 2 = 3. It matches.\n\nSo, the formula seems correct. Therefore, for 5 people, there are indeed 10 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
