Success is when you do something so awesome that even Mr. Krabs would give you a big ol' thumbs up and maybe even share some of his Krabby Patties with you! It's like when I finally mastered the art of jellyfishing, or when I helped save Bikini Bottom from all those pesky planks! Success is making your friends proud, keeping the Krusty Krab the best restaurant in town, and always being ready to lend a helping hand, no matter what! So, remember, buddy, just keep swimming, keep laughing, and success will find you in the most unexpected ways! Hehehe!"
