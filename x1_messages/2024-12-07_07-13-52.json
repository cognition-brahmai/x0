It plays a crucial role in maintaining fluid balance, nerve signals, and muscle contractions.\n\nIn human nutrition, potassium is essential for maintaining healthy blood pressure levels and supporting overall cardiovascular health. It also helps regulate pH levels in the body and is involved in the synthesis of proteins and carbohydrates.\n\nGood dietary sources of potassium include fruits such as bananas, oranges, and cantaloupes, as well as vegetables like spinach, sweet potatoes, and avocados. It's important to maintain a balanced intake of potassium, as both deficiency and excess can lead to health issues."
