        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a store sells 5 different types of candy, and I need to figure out how many ways I can choose 3 candies, with the condition that I can pick more than one of the same type. Hmm, that sounds like a problem involving combinations, but with a twist since I can pick the same type more than once.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basic principles of combinations. In standard combinations, order doesn't matter, and we don't allow repetition. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. But in this case, since I can pick the same type more than once, it's a bit different. I think this is a problem of combinations with repetition.\n\nI remember that the formula for combinations with repetition is C(n + k - 1, k), where n is the number of types and k is the number of items to choose. So, in this problem, n = 5 and k = 3.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers: C(5 + 3 - 1, 3) = C(7, 3).\n\nNow, I need to calculate C(7, 3). Using the combination formula:\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7 - 3)!) = (7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)).\n\nSimplifying this, I can cancel out the common terms in the numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, 7! is 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4!, and 4! is in both the numerator and denominator, so they cancel out.\n\nThat leaves me with (7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (210) / (6) = 35.\n\nWait, but I should double-check that. Let me make sure I'm using the right formula.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this problem in terms of stars and bars. The stars and bars theorem provides a way to distribute k identical items into n distinct groups.\n\nIn this case, the candies are the identical items (since we're just choosing them, not arranging them), and the types of candy are the distinct groups.\n\nThe formula for stars and bars is C(n + k - 1, k), which matches what I had earlier.\n\nSo, again, C(5 + 3 - 1, 3) = C(7, 3) = 35.\n\nBut maybe I should try to understand this intuitively. Let's say the five types of candy are A, B, C, D, and E.\n\nI need to choose 3 candies, and I can choose the same type more than once.\n\nSo, some possible combinations could be:\n\n- A, A, A\n\n- A, A, B\n\n- A, B, B\n\n- A, B, C\n\n- And so on.\n\nI need to list all possible combinations where order doesn't matter, and repetition is allowed.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to use the concept of multisets. A multiset is like a set, but it can contain multiple instances of the same element.\n\nThe number of multisets of size k from n types is given by C(n + k - 1, k).\n\nAgain, that's the same formula I have.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as solving the equation x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 = 3, where xi >= 0, and xi represents the number of candies of type i.\n\nThis is a standard stars and bars problem, and the number of non-negative integer solutions is C(n + k - 1, k) = C(5 + 3 - 1, 3) = C(7, 3) = 35.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should try to list them out to verify.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. AAA\n\n2. AAB\n\n3. AAC\n\n4. AAD\n\n5. AAE\n\n6. ABB\n\n7. ABC\n\n8. ABD\n\n9. ABE\n\n10. ACC\n\n11. ACD\n\n12. ACE\n\n13. ADD\n\n14. ADE\n\n15. AEE\n\n16. BBB\n\n17. BBC\n\n18. BBD\n\n19. BBE\n\n20. BCC\n\n21. BCD\n\n22. BCE\n\n23. BDD\n\n24. BDE\n\n25. BEE\n\n26. CCC\n\n27. CCD\n\n28. CCE\n\n29. CDD\n\n30. CDE\n\n31. CEE\n\n32. DDD\n\n33. DDE\n\n34. DEE\n\n35. EEE\n\nOkay, that's 35 combinations. It matches the formula's result.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to use a different approach, say, considering ordered selections and then adjusting for unordered.\n\nIf I were to choose 3 candies in order, with repetition allowed, it would be 5^3 = 125 possibilities.\n\nBut since order doesn't matter, I need to account for the fact that different ordered selections can correspond to the same combination.\n\nFor example, AAB,ABA,BAA are all the same combination.\n\nSimilarly, ABC is the same regardless of order.\n\nSo, to find the number of unordered selections with repetition, I can use the formula C(n + k - 1, k) = C(7, 3) = 35.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about partitioning the 3 candies into up to 5 types.\n\nThis again leads me back to the stars and bars method.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to choose 3 candies from 5 types, with repetition allowed, is 35.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{35} \\]"
