        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a car rental company with 150 cars in total. Right now, 40% of them are rented out. We need to find out how many more cars need to be rented to bring that percentage up to 75%.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many cars are currently rented. If 40% of 150 cars are rented, we can calculate that by multiplying 150 by 40% (or 0.40 in decimal form).\n\nSo, 150 * 0.40 = 60 cars are currently rented.\n\nNow, we want to have 75% of the cars rented. Again, we'll calculate 75% of 150 cars.\n\n150 * 0.75 = 112.5\n\nBut since we can't have half a car rented, we'll need to round this number. In most real-world scenarios, you can't rent half a car, so we'll probably need to round up to 113 cars to meet or exceed the 75% target.\n\nNow, to find out how many more cars need to be rented, we'll subtract the number of cars currently rented from the target number of rented cars.\n\n113 - 60 = 53 cars\n\nSo, they need to rent out 53 more cars to reach a 75% rental rate.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Perhaps using equations would be more straightforward.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of additional cars needed to be rented as x.\n\nThe total number of cars is 150.\n\nCurrently, 60 cars are rented.\n\nAfter renting x more cars, the total rented cars would be 60 + x.\n\nWe want this to be 75% of the total cars, so:\n\n60 + x = 0.75 * 150\n\n60 + x = 112.5\n\nAgain, since we can't have half a car, we'll round up to 113.\n\nSo, x = 113 - 60 = 53\n\nAlright, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut let's consider if the total number of cars changes when we rent more cars. Wait, no, the total number of cars is fixed at 150. So, renting more cars doesn't change the total number; it just changes the number of rented cars.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the difference between the desired number of rented cars and the current number.\n\nDesired rented cars: 113 (rounded up from 112.5)\n\nCurrent rented cars: 60\n\nDifference: 113 - 60 = 53\n\nSo, they need to rent out 53 more cars.\n\nAlternatively, if we don't round up, and accept that 112.5 is the target, then:\n\nx = 112.5 - 60 = 52.5\n\nBut since we can't rent half a car, we'd need to round up to 53 cars to meet the 75% target.\n\nWait, but percentages can have decimals, but the number of cars has to be whole numbers. So, it's acceptable to aim for 113 cars to achieve or surpass 75% rental rate.\n\nLet me confirm if 113 cars rented is indeed 75% or more.\n\n113 / 150 = 0.75333..., which is 75.333...%, which is slightly above 75%.\n\nIf we rent out only 52 cars, the total rented would be 60 + 52 = 112 cars.\n\n112 / 150 = 0.74666..., which is 74.666...%, slightly below 75%.\n\nTherefore, renting 52 cars wouldn't quite reach the 75% target, so we do need to rent out 53 cars to exceed 75%.\n\nAlternatively, if the company is okay with exactly 75%, and since 75% of 150 is 112.5, which is not achievable since we can't have half a car rented, then they would need to rent out 113 cars to exceed 75%.\n\nBut if they accept being slightly below, renting 112 cars would be 74.666...%, which is just under 75%.\n\nBut the question seems to imply that they want to reach 75%, which would require 113 cars, meaning 53 additional cars need to be rented.\n\nAlternatively, if the company can consider fractional cars in their calculations, which is unusual, but mathematically possible, then they would need to rent 52.5 cars additionally. But in practice, that doesn't make sense, so we'll stick with 53 cars.\n\nAnother approach could be to set up an equation where the number of rented cars divided by total cars equals 75%.\n\nLet r be the number of rented cars.\n\nr / 150 = 0.75\n\nr = 0.75 * 150 = 112.5\n\nAgain, leading us to the same conclusion.\n\nSo, the car rental company needs to rent out 53 more cars to reach or exceed a 75% rental rate.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a different interpretation. Maybe the total number of cars changes if more cars are rented. But no, the total number of cars is fixed at 150.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question means that the company has 150 cars, 40% of which are rented, and we need to find out how many more cars need to be rented to make the rented cars 75% of the total cars.\n\nBut that's exactly what we've already calculated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the number of additional cars needed to be rented in terms of the current number of rented cars, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that when more cars are rented, the total number of cars increases, but that doesn't apply here because the company has a fixed fleet of 150 cars.\n\nWait, unless the company is considering adding more cars to their fleet, but the question doesn't mention that.\n\nBased on the information given, the company has 150 cars, 40% of which are rented, and we need to find out how many more cars need to be rented to reach 75% of the total cars.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial calculation, the answer is 53 cars.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor we might have missed.\n\nFor example, are there any cars that cannot be rented, like maintenance or reserved cars? The question doesn't specify any such constraints, so we'll assume all 150 cars are available to be rented.\n\nAlso, the question says \"how many more cars need to be rented\", implying additional rentals on top of the current 60 rented cars.\n\nSo, again, 113 - 60 = 53 cars.\n\nAlternatively, if the company wants exactly 75% rented, and 75% of 150 is 112.5, which is not achievable, then they need to rent out either 112 or 113 cars.\n\nIf they rent out 112 cars, that's 112 / 150 = 74.666...%, which is just under 75%.\n\nIf they rent out 113 cars, that's 75.333...%, which exceeds 75%.\n\nSo, depending on whether they want to meet or exceed the 75% target, they would need to rent out either 52 or 53 additional cars.\n\nBut since the question says \"to reach the total percentage of rented cars to reach 75%\", it probably means to meet or exceed 75%, so renting 53 more cars would be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, if they are allowed to have exactly 75%, then since that's not possible with whole cars, they might need to consider adjusting their fleet size, but again, the question doesn't suggest that.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the car rental company needs to rent out 53 more cars to have at least 75% of their cars rented.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{53} \\]"
