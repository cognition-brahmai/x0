        "content": "So there's this problem about a school needing to provide notebooks for all the students. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, there are 8 classrooms, and each classroom has 25 students. So, to find out the total number of students in the school, I need to multiply the number of classrooms by the number of students per classroom. That should give me the total number of students.\n\nSo, 8 classrooms times 25 students per classroom: 8 \u00d7 25. Let's do that math. 8 times 25 is 200. So, there are 200 students in total.\n\nNow, each student needs 5 notebooks for the new semester. So, to find out the total number of notebooks needed, I should multiply the total number of students by the number of notebooks per student. That is, 200 students times 5 notebooks per student.\n\n200 \u00d7 5. That's straightforward. 200 times 5 is 1000. So, the school needs to provide 1000 notebooks.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm that my answer is correct.\n\nAnother way could be to find out how many notebooks are needed per classroom and then multiply by the number of classrooms.\n\nSo, each classroom has 25 students, and each student needs 5 notebooks. So, per classroom, the number of notebooks needed is 25 \u00d7 5. That's 125 notebooks per classroom.\n\nNow, there are 8 classrooms, so total notebooks needed would be 125 notebooks per classroom times 8 classrooms: 125 \u00d7 8.\n\nLet's do that math. 125 times 8. 125 times 8 is 1000. So, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of total notebooks needed directly.\n\nBut I think that's enough verification. Both methods give me the same answer, which is 1000 notebooks.\n\nSo, the school needs to provide 1000 notebooks for the new semester.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1000} \\]"
