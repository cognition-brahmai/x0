        "content": "So I've got this triangle with sides measuring 9 cm, 12 cm, and 15 cm, and I need to find its area. Hmm, I remember there are different ways to find the area of a triangle, like using base and height, or maybe Heron's formula. But I'm not sure which one to use here.\n\nFirst, I should check if this is a right-angled triangle because that might make things easier. In a right-angled triangle, the area is simply half the product of the two shorter sides. So, let's see if these sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, if we have sides a, b, and c, where c is the hypotenuse, then a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2.\n\nLet me arrange the sides in order: 9 cm, 12 cm, and 15 cm. The longest side should be the hypotenuse, so c = 15 cm. Now, let's check if 9\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 equals 15\u00b2.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n9\u00b2 = 81\n\n12\u00b2 = 144\n\n15\u00b2 = 225\n\nNow, 81 + 144 = 225, which matches 15\u00b2. So yes, this is a right-angled triangle with the right angle between the 9 cm and 12 cm sides.\n\nSince it's a right-angled triangle, I can use the formula for the area: area = (1/2) * base * height. Here, the base and height are the two sides perpendicular to each other, which are 9 cm and 12 cm.\n\nSo, area = (1/2) * 9 cm * 12 cm\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 9 * 12 = 108 cm\u00b2\n\nThen, half of that is 108 / 2 = 54 cm\u00b2\n\nWait, but I remember that in some cases, you can use Heron's formula, which is more general and works for any triangle. Maybe I should verify the area using Heron's formula to see if I get the same result.\n\nHeron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides of length a, b, and c is:\n\narea = \u221a[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nLet's apply this to our triangle.\n\nFirst, find the semi-perimeter s:\n\ns = (9 cm + 12 cm + 15 cm)/2 = (36 cm)/2 = 18 cm\n\nNow, plug into Heron's formula:\n\narea = \u221a[18(18 - 9)(18 - 12)(18 - 15)] = \u221a[18 * 9 * 6 * 3]\n\nLet's calculate inside the square root:\n\n18 * 9 = 162\n\n162 * 6 = 972\n\n972 * 3 = 2916\n\nSo, area = \u221a2916\n\nWhat's the square root of 2916? I know that 54 * 54 = 2916, so \u221a2916 = 54 cm\u00b2\n\nOkay, that matches the area I found using the right-angled triangle formula. Good, that makes sense.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to find the area of this triangle? Maybe using trigonometry, if I know an angle, but I don't have any angle measures here. Or maybe using vectors, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nSince I already have two methods giving me the same answer, I can be confident that the area is indeed 54 cm\u00b2.\n\nLet me just double-check the calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst method:\n\narea = (1/2) * 9 cm * 12 cm = (1/2)*108 cm\u00b2 = 54 cm\u00b2\n\nSecond method:\n\ns = 18 cm\n\narea = \u221a[18*(18-9)*(18-12)*(18-15)] = \u221a[18*9*6*3] = \u221a[18*9*18] = \u221a[18*162] = \u221a2916 = 54 cm\u00b2\n\nYes, both methods confirm the area is 54 cm\u00b2.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. Unless there's another approach I'm missing, but I think for this problem, finding the area using either the right-angled triangle formula or Heron's formula is sufficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{54} \\]\n"
