        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of friends who decided to split the cost of a $75 meal evenly. But then, two friends forget their wallets and can't pay. Because of this, each of the remaining friends has to pay an extra $5. We need to find out how many friends are in the group.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say there are \\( n \\) friends in total.\n\nInitially, they planned to split $75 evenly among all \\( n \\) friends. So, each friend was supposed to pay \\( \\frac{75}{n} \\) dollars.\n\nBut then, two friends couldn't pay, so only \\( n - 2 \\) friends are left to pay the bill. Now, each of these remaining friends has to pay an extra $5. So, the new amount each of these friends has to pay is \\( \\frac{75}{n - 2} \\) dollars, and this is $5 more than what they originally planned to pay.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{75}{n - 2} = \\frac{75}{n} + 5 \\]\n\nNow, we need to solve for \\( n \\).\n\nFirst, let's get rid of the denominators by finding a common denominator, which would be \\( n(n - 2) \\).\n\nMultiply both sides of the equation by \\( n(n - 2) \\):\n\n\\[ 75n = 75(n - 2) + 5n(n - 2) \\]\n\nLet's expand and simplify:\n\n\\[ 75n = 75n - 150 + 5n^2 - 10n \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. Let me double-check the multiplication.\n\nActually, when multiplying both sides by \\( n(n - 2) \\), each term should be multiplied properly.\n\nLet's try again:\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[ \\frac{75}{n - 2} = \\frac{75}{n} + 5 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( n(n - 2) \\):\n\n\\[ 75n = 75(n - 2) + 5n(n - 2) \\]\n\nOkay, now expand the right side:\n\n\\[ 75n = 75n - 150 + 5n^2 - 10n \\]\n\nWait, that still seems off. Let me check the multiplication again.\n\nActually, \\( 75(n - 2) = 75n - 150 \\), and \\( 5n(n - 2) = 5n^2 - 10n \\). So, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 75n = 75n - 150 + 5n^2 - 10n \\]\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\nSubtract \\( 75n \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 0 = -150 + 5n^2 - 10n \\]\n\nNow, let's rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[ 5n^2 - 10n - 150 = 0 \\]\n\nWe can simplify this by dividing every term by 5:\n\n\\[ n^2 - 2n - 30 = 0 \\]\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation: \\( n^2 - 2n - 30 = 0 \\)\n\nLet's solve this using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 120}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{124}}{2} \\]\n\nWait, that's not simplifying nicely. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me go back and check my steps.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{75}{n - 2} = \\frac{75}{n} + 5 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( n(n - 2) \\):\n\n\\[ 75n = 75(n - 2) + 5n(n - 2) \\]\n\nExpand:\n\n\\[ 75n = 75n - 150 + 5n^2 - 10n \\]\n\nWait, now let's move all terms to one side:\n\n\\[ 75n - 75n + 150 - 5n^2 + 10n = 0 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ -5n^2 + 10n + 150 = 0 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n\\[ 5n^2 - 10n - 150 = 0 \\]\n\nDivide by 5:\n\n\\[ n^2 - 2n - 30 = 0 \\]\n\nSo, quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 120}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{124}}{2} \\]\n\nWait, \\( \\sqrt{124} \\) is not a perfect square. Maybe I messed up the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the extra $5 is what each remaining friend has to pay over the original share.\n\nLet me try setting up the equation differently.\n\nLet \\( n \\) be the total number of friends.\n\nOriginal share per friend: \\( \\frac{75}{n} \\)\n\nNew share per remaining friend: \\( \\frac{75}{n - 2} \\)\n\nThe difference is $5:\n\n\\[ \\frac{75}{n - 2} - \\frac{75}{n} = 5 \\]\n\nOkay, that seems similar to what I did before.\n\nLet me solve this again.\n\nFind a common denominator for the left side: \\( n(n - 2) \\)\n\n\\[ \\frac{75n - 75(n - 2)}{n(n - 2)} = 5 \\]\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n\\[ \\frac{75n - 75n + 150}{n(n - 2)} = 5 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{150}{n(n - 2)} = 5 \\]\n\nNow, multiply both sides by \\( n(n - 2) \\):\n\n\\[ 150 = 5n(n - 2) \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n\\[ 30 = n(n - 2) \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ n^2 - 2n - 30 = 0 \\]\n\nAgain, the same quadratic equation.\n\nNow, solving:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 120}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{124}}{2} \\]\n\nWait, \\( \\sqrt{124} = 2\\sqrt{31} \\), so:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{31}}{2} = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{31} \\]\n\nBut \\( \\sqrt{31} \\) is approximately 5.567, so:\n\n\\[ n = 1 + 5.567 \\approx 6.567 \\]\n\nor\n\n\\[ n = 1 - 5.567 \\approx -4.567 \\]\n\nBut the number of friends can't be a fraction or negative. What's going on here?\n\nThis suggests that there might be an error in the setup of the equation.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSuppose there are \\( n \\) friends.\n\nOriginal share per friend: \\( \\frac{75}{n} \\)\n\nTwo friends can't pay, so \\( n - 2 \\) friends pay.\n\nNew share per paying friend: \\( \\frac{75}{n - 2} \\)\n\nThe problem says each remaining friend has to pay an extra $5, meaning:\n\n\\[ \\frac{75}{n - 2} = \\frac{75}{n} + 5 \\]\n\nThis is the same equation I set up earlier, leading to a non-integer solution for \\( n \\), which doesn't make sense because the number of friends should be a whole number.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that the quadratic equation doesn't factor nicely, suggesting that the number of friends isn't an integer, which is unrealistic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the total extra amount paid by the remaining friends equals the amount that the two absent friends should have paid.\n\nThe two absent friends would have paid \\( 2 \\times \\frac{75}{n} \\) in total.\n\nThis amount is now distributed among the remaining \\( n - 2 \\) friends, each paying an extra $5.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ 5(n - 2) = 2 \\times \\frac{75}{n} \\]\n\nLet's solve this equation.\n\n\\[ 5(n - 2) = \\frac{150}{n} \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( n \\):\n\n\\[ 5n(n - 2) = 150 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n\\[ n(n - 2) = 30 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ n^2 - 2n - 30 = 0 \\]\n\nAgain, the same quadratic equation.\n\nThis suggests that the solution isn't an integer, which is problematic because the number of friends should be a whole number.\n\nWait, maybe I can look for a value of \\( n \\) that makes \\( n^2 - 2n - 30 = 0 \\) true, even if it's not an integer.\n\nBut in the context of the problem, the number of friends has to be an integer.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or in my approach.\n\nLet me try plugging in some integer values for \\( n \\) to see if any satisfy the equation.\n\nLet's try \\( n = 5 \\):\n\n\\[ 5^2 - 2(5) - 30 = 25 - 10 - 30 = -15 \\neq 0 \\]\n\nNot zero.\n\nTry \\( n = 6 \\):\n\n\\[ 6^2 - 2(6) - 30 = 36 - 12 - 30 = -6 \\neq 0 \\]\n\nStill not zero.\n\nTry \\( n = 7 \\):\n\n\\[ 7^2 - 2(7) - 30 = 49 - 14 - 30 = 5 \\neq 0 \\]\n\nStill not.\n\nTry \\( n = 8 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^2 - 2(8) - 30 = 64 - 16 - 30 = 18 \\neq 0 \\]\n\nNot zero.\n\nHmm, none of these are giving zero. Maybe I need to consider that the number of friends isn't an integer, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number.\n\nFrom earlier, \\( n \\approx 6.567 \\), which is closer to 7.\n\nLet's check \\( n = 7 \\) again.\n\nOriginal share per friend: \\( \\frac{75}{7} \\approx 10.714 \\) dollars.\n\nTwo friends can't pay, so remaining friends: \\( 7 - 2 = 5 \\).\n\nNew share per paying friend: \\( \\frac{75}{5} = 15 \\) dollars.\n\nExtra amount paid by each remaining friend: \\( 15 - 10.714 \\approx 4.286 \\), which is not $5.\n\nThat's not matching.\n\nTry \\( n = 6 \\):\n\nOriginal share: \\( \\frac{75}{6} = 12.5 \\) dollars.\n\nRemaining friends: \\( 6 - 2 = 4 \\).\n\nNew share: \\( \\frac{75}{4} = 18.75 \\) dollars.\n\nExtra amount: \\( 18.75 - 12.5 = 6.25 \\), which is more than $5.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nTry \\( n = 5 \\):\n\nOriginal share: \\( \\frac{75}{5} = 15 \\) dollars.\n\nRemaining friends: \\( 5 - 2 = 3 \\).\n\nNew share: \\( \\frac{75}{3} = 25 \\) dollars.\n\nExtra amount: \\( 25 - 15 = 10 \\) dollars, which is way more than $5.\n\nNot matching.\n\nTry \\( n = 9 \\):\n\nOriginal share: \\( \\frac{75}{9} \\approx 8.333 \\) dollars.\n\nRemaining friends: \\( 9 - 2 = 7 \\).\n\nNew share: \\( \\frac{75}{7} \\approx 10.714 \\) dollars.\n\nExtra amount: \\( 10.714 - 8.333 \\approx 2.381 \\), which is less than $5.\n\nNot matching.\n\nTry \\( n = 10 \\):\n\nOriginal share: \\( \\frac{75}{10} = 7.5 \\) dollars.\n\nRemaining friends: \\( 10 - 2 = 8 \\).\n\nNew share: \\( \\frac{75}{8} = 9.375 \\) dollars.\n\nExtra amount: \\( 9.375 - 7.5 = 1.875 \\), which is less than $5.\n\nNot matching.\n\nHmm, none of these integer values for \\( n \\) seem to satisfy the condition that the extra amount is exactly $5.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the number of friends isn't an integer, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the quadratic equation solution.\n\nLet me revisit the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[ n^2 - 2n - 30 = 0 \\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 120}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{124}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{31}}{2} = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{31} \\]\n\nSince \\( \\sqrt{31} \\) is approximately 5.567, then:\n\n\\[ n \\approx 1 + 5.567 = 6.567 \\]\n\nBut the number of friends can't be a fraction.\n\nWait, maybe the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number, which would be 7.\n\nLet's check \\( n = 7 \\) again.\n\nOriginal share: \\( \\frac{75}{7} \\approx 10.714 \\) dollars.\n\nNew share: \\( \\frac{75}{5} = 15 \\) dollars.\n\nExtra amount: \\( 15 - 10.714 \\approx 4.286 \\), which is less than $5.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo or isn't realistic, as the solution isn't an integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the extra $5 is per original friend, not per remaining friend.\n\nWait, let's read the problem again: \"each of the remaining friends has to pay an extra $5.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the extra $5 is what each remaining friend pays on top of what they originally planned to pay.\n\nWait, that's how I set it up initially.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the total extra amount that each remaining friend pays.\n\nBut that seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the extra $5 is the total extra amount that each remaining friend pays, including the original amount.\n\nWait, let's try rephrasing the equation.\n\nLet me define:\n\nOriginal share: \\( s = \\frac{75}{n} \\)\n\nNew share: \\( s' = \\frac{75}{n - 2} \\)\n\nGiven that \\( s' = s + 5 \\), which is what I used before.\n\nBut leading to a non-integer \\( n \\), which is problematic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the extra $5 is the total extra amount that each remaining friend has to pay, not per original share.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem means that each remaining friend pays $5 more than they originally planned, in addition to their original share.\n\nWait, but that's what I thought before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the extra $5 is the total extra amount that each remaining friend has to pay, meaning that the additional amount per remaining friend is $5.\n\nBut that's essentially what I set up.\n\nI'm a bit stuck here.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the total extra amount collected is equal to the amount that the two absent friends should have paid.\n\nThe two absent friends should have paid \\( 2s = 2 \\times \\frac{75}{n} \\).\n\nThis extra amount is distributed among the remaining \\( n - 2 \\) friends, each paying an extra $5.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ 5(n - 2) = 2 \\times \\frac{75}{n} \\]\n\nThis is the equation I had before:\n\n\\[ 5(n - 2) = \\frac{150}{n} \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( n \\):\n\n\\[ 5n(n - 2) = 150 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n\\[ n(n - 2) = 30 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ n^2 - 2n - 30 = 0 \\]\n\nAgain, the same quadratic equation.\n\nThis suggests that the number of friends isn't an integer, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that the number of friends is 10.\n\nWait, let's test \\( n = 10 \\).\n\nOriginal share: \\( \\frac{75}{10} = 7.5 \\) dollars.\n\nRemaining friends: \\( 10 - 2 = 8 \\).\n\nNew share: \\( \\frac{75}{8} = 9.375 \\) dollars.\n\nExtra amount per remaining friend: \\( 9.375 - 7.5 = 1.875 \\), which is not $5.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem means that the remaining friends pay $5 each to cover the absent ones.\n\nBut that doesn't align with the original setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the extra $5 is the total extra amount that each remaining friend pays.\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nTotal extra amount needed is the amount that the two absent friends should have paid: \\( 2 \\times \\frac{75}{n} \\).\n\nThis total extra amount is divided among the remaining \\( n - 2 \\) friends, each paying an extra \\( \\frac{2 \\times \\frac{75}{n}}{n - 2} \\).\n\nBut the problem says each remaining friend pays an extra $5.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2 \\times \\frac{75}{n}}{n - 2} = 5 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ \\frac{150}{n(n - 2)} = 5 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( n(n - 2) \\):\n\n\\[ 150 = 5n(n - 2) \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n\\[ 30 = n(n - 2) \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ n^2 - 2n - 30 = 0 \\]\n\nAgain, the same quadratic equation.\n\nThis suggests that the number of friends isn't an integer, which is problematic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the meal cost is different, or the extra amount is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that the number of friends is 10, but as we saw, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that the extra amount paid by each remaining friend is $5, and the number of remaining friends is \\( n - 2 \\).\n\nSo, the total extra amount collected is \\( 5(n - 2) \\).\n\nThis total extra amount should equal the amount that the two absent friends should have paid, which is \\( 2 \\times \\frac{75}{n} \\).\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ 5(n - 2) = 2 \\times \\frac{75}{n} \\]\n\nThis is the same equation as before.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem is designed to have a non-integer solution, which doesn't make sense in this context, suggesting a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number.\n\nIf \\( n \\approx 6.567 \\), rounding to 7.\n\nBut as we saw, \\( n = 7 \\) doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that each remaining friend pays $5, not an extra $5.\n\nWait, let's read the problem again: \"each of the remaining friends has to pay an extra $5.\"\n\nSo, it's the extra amount over what they originally planned to pay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted as each remaining friend pays $5, in addition to their original share.\n\nWait, but that's not how it's worded.\n\nThe wording is: \"each of the remaining friends has to pay an extra $5.\"\n\nThis suggests that beyond their original share, they pay an extra $5.\n\nBut that's how I set up the equation initially.\n\nI'm starting to think that there might be an error in the problem itself, perhaps in the numbers provided, leading to a non-integer number of friends, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to interpret \"extra $5.\"\n\nPerhaps it's the total extra amount collected from the remaining friends.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, given the wording.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem means that each remaining friend pays $5 more than the original share, but the original share is included in that amount.\n\nBut that's what I thought before.\n\nI'm going to assume that the problem has a mistake, or that it's expecting a non-integer number of friends, which doesn't make sense.\n\nGiven that, I'll conclude that the number of friends is approximately 6.567, but since that's not possible, there might be an error in the problem setup.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The problem likely contains an error, as it leads to a non-integer number of friends.}} \\]"
