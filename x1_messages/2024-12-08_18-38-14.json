        "content": "Machu Picchu, often referred to as the \"Lost City of the Incas,\" was built by the Inca civilization. This ancient city is located in present-day Peru, high in the Andes Mountains. The Incas were one of the most advanced civilizations of the pre-Columbian era, known for their impressive architectural feats, complex social structure, and extensive empire that spanned much of western South America.\n\nMachu Picchu was likely constructed around the mid-15th century, during the reign of the Inca emperor Pachacuti. It was probably used as a royal estate or sacred religious site for Inca leaders and their entourage. The city was abandoned during the Spanish conquest in the 16th century, and its existence was unknown to the outside world until it was rediscovered by American historian Hiram Bingham in 1911.\n\nToday, Machu Picchu is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most visited tourist destinations in South America, renowned for its intricate stonework, panoramic views, and the mysterious aura surrounding its purpose and history."
