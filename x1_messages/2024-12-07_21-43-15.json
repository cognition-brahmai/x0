        "content": "So the factory makes 200 widgets every day, and on average, 5% of them don't pass the quality test. I need to find out how many widgets pass the test in a week, which is 7 days.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many widgets are produced in a week. Since they make 200 per day, I can multiply that by 7:\n\n200 widgets/day \u00d7 7 days = 1400 widgets in a week.\n\nNow, 5% of these widgets fail the test. So, to find out how many fail, I can calculate 5% of 1400:\n\n5% of 1400 = 0.05 \u00d7 1400 = 70 widgets.\n\nSo, 70 widgets fail the test in a week.\n\nTo find out how many pass, I can subtract the failed widgets from the total produced:\n\n1400 total widgets - 70 failed widgets = 1330 passing widgets.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to do this? Maybe I can calculate the passing rate directly.\n\nIf 5% fail, then 95% pass, right? Because 100% - 5% = 95%.\n\nSo, I can calculate 95% of the total weekly production to find out how many pass.\n\n95% of 1400 = 0.95 \u00d7 1400 = 1330 widgets.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier by subtracting the failed widgets.\n\nSo, either way, the number of widgets that pass the test in a week is 1330.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, daily production is 200 widgets.\n\nOver 7 days, that's 200 \u00d7 7 = 1400 widgets.\n\n5% failure rate means 5% of 1400 fail: 0.05 \u00d7 1400 = 70 failed widgets.\n\nTherefore, passing widgets = total - failed = 1400 - 70 = 1330.\n\nAlternatively, passing rate is 95%, so 0.95 \u00d7 1400 = 1330.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the daily passing widgets and then multiply by 7.\n\nDaily passing widgets = 200 - (5% of 200) = 200 - 10 = 190 widgets per day.\n\nThen, over 7 days: 190 \u00d7 7 = 1330 widgets.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I end up with 1330 passing widgets in a week.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1330} \\]"
