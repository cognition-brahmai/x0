However, I can provide you with some information about Rumi and his style of writing ghazals.\n\nRumi was a 13th-century Persian poet, theologian, and Sufi mystic whose works are widely read and admired for their spiritual depth and poetic beauty. His ghazals often explore themes of love, spirituality, and the human condition, and are known for their rhythmic beauty and emotional intensity.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, please let me know."
