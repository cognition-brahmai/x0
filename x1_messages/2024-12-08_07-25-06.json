        "content": "Let's tackle this equation step by step. The equation we have is:\n\n(5x\u00b2 - 8) + 3(2x\u00b2 + 4) =\n\nFirst, I need to handle the parentheses and the coefficient in front of them. I see that there's a 3 multiplying the second set of parentheses. So, I'll distribute that 3 to both terms inside those parentheses.\n\nSo, 3 times 2x\u00b2 is 6x\u00b2, and 3 times 4 is 12. So, the equation becomes:\n\n5x\u00b2 - 8 + 6x\u00b2 + 12 =\n\nNow, I need to combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. So, here, 5x\u00b2 and 6x\u00b2 are like terms, and -8 and 12 are also like terms.\n\nAdding 5x\u00b2 and 6x\u00b2 gives me 11x\u00b2.\n\nAdding -8 and 12 gives me 4.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the simplified equation is:\n\n11x\u00b2 + 4\n\nI think that's the final answer. But just to be sure, let me double-check my steps.\n\nStarting with (5x\u00b2 - 8) + 3(2x\u00b2 + 4), I distributed the 3 correctly to get 6x\u00b2 + 12. Then, combining like terms: 5x\u00b2 + 6x\u00b2 is indeed 11x\u00b2, and -8 + 12 is indeed 4. So, yes, 11x\u00b2 + 4 is the correct simplification.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11x^2 + 4} \\]"
