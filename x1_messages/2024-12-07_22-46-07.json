        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the bakery wants to produce 10,000 loaves of bread every day. They operate from 6 am to 6 pm, which is a 12-hour day. Each oven can bake 50 loaves per hour. We need to find out how many ovens they need to meet their daily production target and then calculate the total cost based on each oven costing $15,000.\n\nFirst, let's determine how many loaves one oven can produce in a day. Since each oven bakes 50 loaves per hour and the bakery operates for 12 hours, one oven can produce:\n\n50 loaves/hour * 12 hours = 600 loaves per day.\n\nNow, the bakery needs to produce 10,000 loaves daily. So, the number of ovens required would be:\n\nTotal loaves needed / Loaves per oven per day = 10,000 / 600.\n\nLet's do that calculation:\n\n10,000 \u00f7 600 = 16.666...\n\nSince you can't have a fraction of an oven, the bakery needs to round up to the next whole number. So, they need 17 ovens to meet their daily production goal.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these ovens. Each oven costs $15,000, so:\n\nNumber of ovens * Cost per oven = 17 * $15,000 = $255,000.\n\nTherefore, the bakery needs to purchase 17 ovens, costing a total of $255,000.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that 17 ovens are sufficient. If each oven produces 600 loaves per day, then 17 ovens would produce:\n\n17 * 600 = 10,200 loaves per day.\n\nThat's slightly more than the required 10,000 loaves, but it covers the need. If they had only 16 ovens, they would produce:\n\n16 * 600 = 9,600 loaves per day,\n\nwhich is less than 10,000, so 17 ovens are indeed necessary.\n\nAlso, it's worth considering if there are any efficiencies or constraints that might affect this calculation. For example, maybe the ovens need downtime for maintenance, or perhaps there are peak times when more bread is needed. But based on the information provided, assuming constant production rates, 17 ovens should suffice.\n\nAdditionally, the bakery might want to consider having some spare capacity for future expansion or increased demand. But again, based on the current requirements, 17 ovens should meet the daily production target.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the bakery needs to purchase 17 ovens, which will cost them a total of $255,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17 \\text{ ovens at a total cost of } \\$255,000} \\]"
