        "content": "So I've got this problem here about forming a committee with some specific conditions. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\n\"A committee of 5 people needs to be formed from a group of 9 men and 7 women. How many different committees can be formed if at least 3 women must be on the committee?\"\n\nAlright, so we have a total of 9 men and 7 women, making it 16 people in total. We need to form a committee of 5 people from these 16, but with the condition that at least 3 of them must be women.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how to calculate combinations because the order in which we select the committee members doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, without any restrictions, the total number of ways to choose 5 people from 16 would be \\( C(16, 5) \\). But here, there's a condition that at least 3 women must be on the committee. That means the committee can have 3 women and 2 men, or 4 women and 1 man, or 5 women and no men.\n\nSo, I need to calculate the number of ways for each of these scenarios and then add them up.\n\nLet's start with the first scenario: 3 women and 2 men.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 women from 7 is \\( C(7, 3) \\), and the number of ways to choose 2 men from 9 is \\( C(9, 2) \\). Since these are independent choices, the total number of ways for this scenario is \\( C(7, 3) \\times C(9, 2) \\).\n\nSimilarly, for 4 women and 1 man, it's \\( C(7, 4) \\times C(9, 1) \\).\n\nAnd for 5 women and 0 men, it's \\( C(7, 5) \\times C(9, 0) \\).\n\nFinally, I'll add up all these possibilities to get the total number of committees that satisfy the condition.\n\nLet me calculate each one step by step.\n\nFirst, \\( C(7, 3) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7 - 3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n\\]\n\nNext, \\( C(9, 2) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(9, 2) = \\frac{9!}{2!(9 - 2)!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8}{2 \\times 1} = 36\n\\]\n\nSo, for 3 women and 2 men, the number of ways is \\( 35 \\times 36 = 1260 \\).\n\nNow, \\( C(7, 4) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(7, 4) = \\frac{7!}{4!(7 - 4)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n\\]\n\nAnd \\( C(9, 1) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(9, 1) = \\frac{9!}{1!(9 - 1)!} = \\frac{9}{1} = 9\n\\]\n\nSo, for 4 women and 1 man, the number of ways is \\( 35 \\times 9 = 315 \\).\n\nNext, \\( C(7, 5) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(7, 5) = \\frac{7!}{5!(7 - 5)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21\n\\]\n\nAnd \\( C(9, 0) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(9, 0) = 1 \\quad \\text{(there's only one way to choose nothing)}\n\\]\n\nSo, for 5 women and 0 men, the number of ways is \\( 21 \\times 1 = 21 \\).\n\nNow, I'll add up all these possibilities:\n\n\\[\n1260 + 315 + 21 = 1596\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of different committees that can be formed with at least 3 women is 1596.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet's verify \\( C(7, 3) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35 \\quad \\text{Looks correct.}\n\\]\n\n\\( C(9, 2) = 36 \\), that seems right.\n\n\\( 35 \\times 36 = 1260 \\), correct.\n\nNext, \\( C(7, 4) = 35 \\), which is the same as \\( C(7, 3) \\) because \\( C(n, k) = C(n, n - k) \\). So that's correct.\n\n\\( C(9, 1) = 9 \\), correct.\n\n\\( 35 \\times 9 = 315 \\), correct.\n\nThen, \\( C(7, 5) = 21 \\), correct.\n\n\\( C(9, 0) = 1 \\), correct.\n\n\\( 21 \\times 1 = 21 \\), correct.\n\nAdding them up: \\( 1260 + 315 = 1575 \\), plus 21 is 1596. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total number of committees without any restrictions and subtract the number of committees that have fewer than 3 women, but since the problem specifies at least 3 women, I think the approach I took is accurate.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 1596 different committees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1596} \\]"
