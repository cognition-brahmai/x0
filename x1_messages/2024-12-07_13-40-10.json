        "content": "So, I've got this problem here. A person invests $5,000 at an annual interest rate of 6%, and it's compounded monthly. I need to find out how much the investment will be worth after 3 years. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for compound interest. I think it's something like:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount, which is the initial amount of money, so that's $5,000.\n\n- r is the annual interest rate, which is 6%, but I need to express that as a decimal, so that's 0.06.\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's compounded monthly, that's 12 times a year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for, in years, which is 3 years.\n\nSo, plugging in these values:\n\nA = 5000(1 + 0.06/12)^(12*3)\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the monthly interest rate:\n\n0.06 / 12 = 0.005\n\nThen, add 1 to that:\n\n1 + 0.005 = 1.005\n\nNow, raise that to the power of 12 times 3, which is 36:\n\n1.005^36\n\nI need to calculate 1.005 to the power of 36. Let me grab a calculator for that.\n\n[calculating]\n\n1.005^36 \u2248 1.19668\n\nNow, multiply that by the principal amount:\n\n5000 * 1.19668 \u2248 5983.40\n\nSo, after 3 years, the investment will be worth approximately $5,983.40.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with P = $5,000, r = 0.06, n = 12, t = 3.\n\nA = 5000(1 + 0.06/12)^(12*3)\n\nAgain, 0.06/12 = 0.005\n\n1 + 0.005 = 1.005\n\n1.005 raised to the 36th power is approximately 1.19668\n\nThen, 5000 * 1.19668 = 5983.40\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about simple interest to see if this makes sense. With simple interest, the interest earned would be P * r * t = 5000 * 0.06 * 3 = 900, so the total amount would be 5000 + 900 = 5900.\n\nBut since it's compounded monthly, I should get a little bit more than that, which I do\u2014$5,983.40 is greater than $5,900, as expected.\n\nSo, the final answer should be approximately $5,983.40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5983.40} \\]"
