        "content": "Let's see. There are 8 employees, each working 7 hours a day, and they get paid $15 per hour. We need to find out how much the company spends on salaries in a 5-day workweek.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many hours each employee works in a week. Since they work 7 hours a day for 5 days, it should be 7 hours/day times 5 days, right? So, 7 * 5 equals 35 hours per week per employee.\n\nNext, if each employee is paid $15 per hour, then their weekly salary would be 35 hours times $15 per hour. That should be 35 * 15. Let me calculate that: 35 * 15 is 525. So, each employee makes $525 per week.\n\nNow, there are 8 employees, so the total salary expenditure for the company would be 8 times $525. So, 8 * 525 is 4,200.\n\nTherefore, the company spends $4,200 on salaries in a 5-day workweek.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a easier way to think about it. Let's see:\n\nTotal hours worked by all employees in a day: 8 employees * 7 hours = 56 hours.\n\nThen, in a 5-day workweek, total hours would be 56 hours/day * 5 days = 280 hours.\n\nAt $15 per hour, total salary expense would be 280 hours * $15/hour = $4,200.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier. So, $4,200 is the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to look at this. Maybe multiplying the daily salary expenditure and then multiplying by 5 days.\n\nDaily salary expenditure: 8 employees * 7 hours/day * $15/hour.\n\nThat would be 8 * 7 * 15.\n\n8 * 7 is 56, and 56 * 15 is 840. So, $840 per day.\n\nThen, for 5 days, it would be 840 * 5 = 4,200.\n\nAgain, $4,200.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of total hours worked in a week by all employees, which is 8 * 7 * 5 = 280 hours, and then 280 * 15 = 4,200.\n\nHmm, seems consistent no matter how I approach it.\n\nI think $4,200 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4200} \\]"
