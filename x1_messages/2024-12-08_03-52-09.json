        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about a water tank. The tank can hold up to 500 liters, but right now it has 300 liters in it. There's a tap that's letting water out at a steady rate of 5 liters every minute. I need to figure out how long it will take for the tank to be completely empty.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. I need to find the time it takes for the tank to go from 300 liters to 0 liters, with water being released at a constant rate of 5 liters per minute.\n\nOkay, so the tank starts with 300 liters, and every minute, 5 liters are released. I need to find out how many minutes it will take to release all 300 liters.\n\nThis seems like a straightforward division problem. If I divide the total amount of water by the rate at which it's being released, that should give me the time.\n\nSo, time = total water / release rate\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\ntime = 300 liters / 5 liters per minute\n\ntime = 60 minutes\n\nWait, is that all? It seems too simple. Maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If the tap releases 5 liters every minute, then in one minute, the tank loses 5 liters. So, starting from 300 liters:\n\nAfter 1 minute: 300 - 5 = 295 liters\n\nAfter 2 minutes: 295 - 5 = 290 liters\n\n...\n\nI can see that this is a linear relationship. The amount of water in the tank decreases by 5 liters each minute.\n\nSo, the general formula for the amount of water left after t minutes would be:\n\nwater left = initial amount - (release rate * time)\n\nSet water left to 0 to find when the tank is empty:\n\n0 = 300 - 5t\n\nNow, solve for t:\n\n5t = 300\n\nt = 300 / 5\n\nt = 60 minutes\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the rate of change. The rate at which the water is decreasing is constant at -5 liters per minute. So, the time to empty would indeed be the total amount divided by the rate.\n\nI think 60 minutes is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this.\n\nIs there any possibility that the release rate changes over time? The problem says the release rate is constant at 5 liters per minute, so no, that's not an issue.\n\nIs there any refilling or other taps affecting the tank? The problem doesn't mention any other sources, so I can assume that the only change is due to this one tap.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The tank's capacity is given in liters, and the release rate is in liters per minute, so dividing liters by liters per minute gives minutes, which is a unit of time, which makes sense.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the tank can actually be emptied below 0 liters, but since the problem states it's currently filled with 300 liters, and the release rate is 5 liters per minute, it will reach 0 liters in 60 minutes, and stop there because you can't have negative water volume.\n\nSo, I don't think there's anything else to consider. The answer should be 60 minutes.\n\nWait, but maybe I should present it in a different unit, like hours. But since 60 minutes is 1 hour, it's probably fine to leave it as minutes, unless the problem specifies to use hours.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify the unit for the answer, so minutes are fine.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The tank will be empty in 60 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
