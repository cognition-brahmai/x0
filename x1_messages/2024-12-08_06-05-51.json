        "content": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. The expression is:\n\n((4 + 6)^2 - (3 * 5)) / (9 - 3)\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Calculate (4 + 6):\n\n4 + 6 = 10\n\nNow the expression becomes:\n\n(10^2 - (3 * 5)) / (9 - 3)\n\n2. Next, calculate the exponent:\n\n10^2 = 100\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n(100 - (3 * 5)) / (9 - 3)\n\n3. Then, perform the multiplication inside the parentheses:\n\n3 * 5 = 15\n\nNow it's:\n\n(100 - 15) / (9 - 3)\n\n4. Now, do the subtraction inside the parentheses:\n\n100 - 15 = 85\n\nAnd 9 - 3 = 6\n\nSo now it's:\n\n85 / 6\n\n5. Finally, perform the division:\n\n85 divided by 6 is 14.1666..., which can also be written as 14 and 1/6.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 14.17 if we round to two decimal places.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14.\\overline{16}} \\]"
