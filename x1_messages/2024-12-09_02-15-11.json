        "content": "So the factory normally works for 8 hours a day, making 200 widgets each hour. But if they work overtime, which is any time beyond those 8 hours, they make fewer widgets per hour\u2014only 150 each hour. Today, they worked a total of 10 hours. I need to find out how many widgets they made in that day.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many hours were overtime. If they worked 10 hours in total and the regular shift is 8 hours, then the overtime is 10 minus 8, which is 2 hours.\n\nSo, regular hours: 8 hours\nOvertime hours: 2 hours\n\nNow, during the regular hours, they make 200 widgets per hour. So, for 8 hours, it would be 200 times 8.\n\n200 * 8 = 1600 widgets\n\nDuring overtime, they make 150 widgets per hour. So, for 2 hours, it would be 150 times 2.\n\n150 * 2 = 300 widgets\n\nNow, to find the total widgets produced in the day, I need to add the widgets from regular hours and overtime hours together.\n\n1600 + 300 = 1900 widgets\n\nSo, the factory produced 1900 widgets that day.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nTotal hours worked: 10 hours\n\nRegular production rate: 200 widgets/hour for the first 8 hours\n\nOvertime production rate: 150 widgets/hour for any hour beyond 8\n\nSo, again, 8 hours at 200 widgets/hour is 1600 widgets.\n\nPlus 2 hours at 150 widgets/hour is 300 widgets.\n\nTotal: 1600 + 300 = 1900 widgets.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I could think of it as the average production rate over 10 hours, but that might be more complicated. Probably best to stick with the straightforward approach.\n\nSo, the answer is 1900 widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1900} \\]"
