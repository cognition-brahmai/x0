        "content": "So there are 5 red balls and 7 blue balls in a bag, and I need to find the probability of picking a red ball randomly. Alright, probability is basically the chance of something happening, right? So in this case, the chance of picking a red ball.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of balls in the bag. There are 5 red and 7 blue, so total balls would be 5 + 7 = 12 balls.\n\nNow, probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this scenario, the favorable outcome is picking a red ball, and the total possible outcomes are picking any ball from the bag.\n\nSo, the probability (P) of picking a red ball would be:\n\nP(red) = Number of red balls / Total number of balls\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nP(red) = 5 / 12\n\nSo, the probability is 5/12.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it differently. There are 12 balls in total, and 5 of them are red. So, if I pick one ball, there are 12 possible outcomes, and 5 of those outcomes are favorable (picking a red ball).\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 5/12.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in percentages. To convert the fraction 5/12 to a percentage, I can divide 5 by 12 and then multiply by 100.\n\n5 \u00f7 12 = 0.4167 (approximately)\n\n0.4167 \u00d7 100 = 41.67%\n\nSo, there's approximately a 41.67% chance of picking a red ball.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify to give the answer in a particular form, I can leave it as a fraction, which is 5/12.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using combinations or something like that.\n\nWell, combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, which is the case here since we're just picking one ball.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one red ball from five red balls is C(5,1), which is 5.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose one ball from twelve balls is C(12,1), which is 12.\n\nSo, the probability is C(5,1) / C(12,1) = 5/12.\n\nSo, again, I get the same answer.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward.\n\nIs there any chance I'm missing something here?\n\nLet me see. The question says \"randomly pick one ball out of the bag.\" Assume that each ball is equally likely to be picked, which is a standard assumption in such problems unless otherwise stated.\n\nSo, yes, the probability is indeed 5/12.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the colors had different weights or sizes or something, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It's just red and blue balls, and we're to assume they're identical except for color.\n\nTherefore, the probability remains 5/12.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to pick multiple balls, the probability would change based on whether I'm picking with replacement or without replacement, but since I'm picking only one ball, that doesn't apply here.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability of picking a red ball is 5/12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{12}} \\]"
