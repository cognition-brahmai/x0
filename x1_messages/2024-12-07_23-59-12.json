        "content": "So there's this problem here about houses on a street, and they have doors that are either blue or red depending on whether their house number is odd or even. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, there are 20 houses on one side of the street and 30 on the other, making a total of 50 houses, right? And each house is numbered from 1 to 50. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem says that odd-numbered houses have blue doors and even-numbered houses have red doors. So, to find out how many houses have blue doors, I need to count how many of these 50 houses have odd numbers.\n\nWell, numbers from 1 to 50 include both odd and even numbers. Let's see, starting from 1, which is odd, then 2 even, 3 odd, and so on, up to 50, which is even.\n\nI think a good way to count the odd numbers between 1 and 50 is to recognize that they form a sequence: 1, 3, 5, ..., 49. So, it's an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 1 and the common difference is 2.\n\nThe general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d\n\nwhere a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.\n\nIn this case, a_1 = 1, d = 2, and the last term a_n = 49.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n49 = 1 + (n - 1) * 2\n\nLet's solve for n:\n\n49 = 1 + 2n - 2\n\n49 = 2n - 1\n\nNow, add 1 to both sides:\n\n50 = 2n\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2:\n\nn = 25\n\nSo, there are 25 odd-numbered houses, which means 25 houses have blue doors.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Another way to think about it is that half of the numbers from 1 to 50 are odd, and half are even, since they alternate.\n\nSince there are 50 houses, half of that would be 25 houses with odd numbers and 25 with even numbers.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier using the arithmetic sequence formula.\n\nSo, the total number of houses with blue doors is 25.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nThe problem mentions that there are 20 houses on one side and 30 on the other, but it doesn't specify anything about how the numbering is distributed between the two sides. It just says that houses are numbered from 1 to 50.\n\nSo, it's safe to assume that the numbering is sequential, regardless of which side of the street the houses are on.\n\nTherefore, the total number of blue-door houses is indeed 25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
