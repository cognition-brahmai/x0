        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a rectangular garden that's 15 meters long and 10 meters wide. I need to build a walkway around the entire garden that's 1 meter wide. And I'm supposed to find out what the new dimensions of the garden will be including the walkway.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize this. I have a rectangle that's 15 meters long and 10 meters wide. Now, I'm adding a walkway that's 1 meter wide all around the garden. So, the walkway is like a border around the garden.\n\nTo find the new dimensions, I think I need to add the width of the walkway to both the length and the width of the garden. But since the walkway goes all around, I need to add it to both sides of each dimension.\n\nLet me think about the length first. The original length is 15 meters. The walkway is 1 meter wide on both ends of the length. So, I need to add 1 meter to each end. That means the total addition to the length is 1 meter + 1 meter, which is 2 meters. So, the new length should be 15 meters + 2 meters = 17 meters.\n\nNow, for the width. The original width is 10 meters. Again, the walkway is 1 meter wide on both sides of the width. So, I need to add 1 meter to each side. That's another 2 meters added to the width. So, the new width should be 10 meters + 2 meters = 12 meters.\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Maybe I can draw a diagram to make sure.\n\nImagine the garden is a rectangle: 15m by 10m. Now, the walkway is 1 meter wide around it. So, on the top side, the walkway adds 1 meter to the width on both ends, same for the bottom side. Similarly, on the left and right sides, the walkway adds 1 meter to the length on both sides.\n\nSo, overall, the garden plus the walkway should have a total length of 15m + 2m (1m on each end) = 17m, and a total width of 10m + 2m (1m on each side) = 12m.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using the concept of perimeter or area.\n\nIf I think about the perimeter, the walkway is added around the perimeter of the garden. But I'm not sure if that helps me find the new dimensions directly.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the walkway as increasing the garden's dimensions by 1 meter on all sides. So, in terms of length and width, it's increasing each by 2 meters in total (1 meter on each side).\n\nSo, again, that leads me back to the new length being 17 meters and the new width being 12 meters.\n\nIs there a formula for this? I'm not sure, but it seems like a basic addition of the walkway width to each side.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the garden and the walkway as a larger rectangle that encompasses both. The walkway is uniformly 1 meter wide around the garden.\n\nSo, the larger rectangle's length would be the garden's length plus twice the walkway width (once for each end). Similarly, the width would be the garden's width plus twice the walkway width.\n\nYes, that matches what I thought earlier: new length = 15m + 2*(1m) = 17m, and new width = 10m + 2*(1m) = 12m.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can calculate the area to see if that makes sense.\n\nOriginal garden area: 15m * 10m = 150 square meters.\n\nNew area with walkway: 17m * 12m = 204 square meters.\n\nSo, the area of the walkway alone would be 204 sq m - 150 sq m = 54 sq m.\n\nDoes that make sense? Let's see:\n\nThe walkway surrounds the garden, so it's like adding strips around the perimeter.\n\nThe walkway along the length would be 15m long and 1m wide on both the top and bottom, so that's 2*(15m*1m) = 30 sq m.\n\nThen, the walkway along the width would be 10m long and 1m wide on both sides, but since the corners are already included in the length strips, I need to subtract the corner areas to avoid double-counting.\n\nEach corner is a 1m by 1m square, so four corners total 4 sq m.\n\nSo, the walkway area would be:\n\n2*(15m * 1m) for the top and bottom + 2*(10m * 1m) for the sides - 4*(1m * 1m) for the corners.\n\nThat's 2*15 + 2*10 - 4*1 = 30 + 20 - 4 = 46 sq m.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated the walkway area as 54 sq m (204 - 150).\n\nThere's a discrepancy here. That means my earlier assumption might be wrong.\n\nLet me re-examine this.\n\nIf the new dimensions are 17m by 12m, that's an area of 204 sq m.\n\nOriginal garden is 15m by 10m, or 150 sq m.\n\nSo, walkway area is 204 - 150 = 54 sq m.\n\nBut when I calculate it separately, I get 46 sq m.\n\nSo, where is the mistake?\n\nAh, I think I see the error. When calculating the walkway area separately, I should not subtract the corner areas because the corners are part of the walkway.\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nThe walkway consists of two parts: the strips along the length and the strips along the width.\n\nThe strips along the length are 15m long and 1m wide, and there are two of them (top and bottom). So, 2*15 = 30 sq m.\n\nThe strips along the width are 10m long and 1m wide, and there are also two of them (sides). So, 2*10 = 20 sq m.\n\nHowever, where these strips meet at the corners, there is an overlap of 1m *1m squares.\n\nSince the corner areas are included in both the length and width strips, I've double-counted those areas.\n\nTherefore, I need to subtract the areas of the four corners to get the total walkway area.\n\nSo, total walkway area = 30 + 20 - 4*1 = 46 sq m.\n\nBut according to the overall area calculation, it should be 54 sq m.\n\nThere's an inconsistency here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my assumption about the new dimensions is incorrect.\n\nLet me consider drawing a diagram.\n\n[Imagine a rectangle with length 15m and width 10m. Around it, there's a 1m wide walkway.]\n\nSo, from the outer edges of the walkway, the total length should be:\n\nOriginal length + 2*(walkway width) = 15m + 2*1m = 17m.\n\nSimilarly, total width = 10m + 2*1m = 12m.\n\nArea of the larger rectangle: 17m * 12m = 204 sq m.\n\nArea of the garden: 15m * 10m = 150 sq m.\n\nTherefore, walkway area = 204 - 150 = 54 sq m.\n\nBut earlier, when I calculated the walkway area by adding the strips, I got 46 sq m.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy of 8 sq m.\n\nI must be missing something in the strip calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the walkway also covers the corners fully, not just the strips.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nImagine the walkway as a frame around the garden.\n\nThe area of the frame would be the area of the outer rectangle minus the area of the inner rectangle (the garden).\n\nThat is, 17m * 12m - 15m * 10m = 204 - 150 = 54 sq m.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the walkway consisting of the two side strips and the two end strips, plus the four corner squares.\n\nWait, in my earlier calculation, I had:\n\n2*(15m *1m) for the top and bottom strips = 30 sq m.\n\n2*(10m *1m) for the left and right strips = 20 sq m.\n\nBut the four corner squares are already included in both the length and width strips, so I need to subtract them to avoid double-counting.\n\nEach corner is 1m *1m = 1 sq m, and there are four corners, so 4 sq m.\n\nTherefore, total walkway area = 30 + 20 - 4 = 46 sq m.\n\nBut this doesn't match the 54 sq m from the overall area calculation.\n\nSo, there's a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the walkway is built outside the garden, adding 1 meter to each side, but perhaps affecting the dimensions differently.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the walkway surrounds the garden, so the new dimensions should be:\n\nLength: 15m + 2*(1m) = 17m.\n\nWidth: 10m + 2*(1m) = 12m.\n\nBut if I calculate the area difference, it's 204 - 150 = 54 sq m, which doesn't match the strip calculation of 46 sq m.\n\nThis suggests that my strip calculation is incorrect.\n\nLet me try to calculate the walkway area differently.\n\nThe walkway forms a path around the garden, 1 meter wide.\n\nSo, it's like a border around the garden.\n\nThe area of the walkway can be calculated as the area of the outer rectangle minus the area of the inner rectangle (the garden).\n\nThat is, 17m *12m - 15m *10m = 204 - 150 = 54 sq m.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the walkway consisting of four rectangles: two lengths and two widths, each 1 meter wide.\n\nBut as before, this gives me 2*(15m*1m) + 2*(10m*1m) = 30 + 20 = 50 sq m.\n\nWait, earlier I subtracted 4 sq m for the corners, but maybe I shouldn't.\n\nIf I consider the two length strips: 15m *1m each, total 30 sq m.\n\nTwo width strips: 10m *1m each, total 20 sq m.\n\nBut the corners are where the strips meet, and since each corner is 1m*1m, they are already included in the strips.\n\nSo, the total walkway area should be 30 + 20 = 50 sq m.\n\nBut according to the overall area calculation, it should be 54 sq m.\n\nNow, there's a discrepancy of 4 sq m.\n\nI must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the walkway also includes the areas at the corners beyond the strips.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf I have a garden that's 15m by 10m, and I add a 1m walkway around it, the new dimensions should be 17m by 12m.\n\nNow, the area of the walkway should be the area outside the garden but inside the outer rectangle.\n\nSo, the walkway consists of:\n\n- Two long strips along the length: each 15m *1m = 15 sq m, total 30 sq m.\n\n- Two wide strips along the width: each 10m *1m = 10 sq m, total 20 sq m.\n\n- Four corner squares: each 1m *1m = 1 sq m, total 4 sq m.\n\nWait, but the corner squares are already included in the strips.\n\nBecause each corner square is part of both a length strip and a width strip.\n\nSo, in the total of 30 + 20 = 50 sq m, the four corners are each counted twice.\n\nTherefore, to get the correct walkway area, I need to subtract the areas of the four corners once.\n\nSo, total walkway area = 50 sq m - 4 sq m = 46 sq m.\n\nBut this still doesn't match the overall area difference of 54 sq m.\n\nThis suggests that there's an error in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the walkway is built such that it extends beyond the garden on all sides, adding 1 meter to each side.\n\nIn that case, the new dimensions should indeed be 17m by 12m, and the walkway area is 204 - 150 = 54 sq m.\n\nBut according to the strip calculation, it's 50 sq m minus 4 sq m for the corners, which is 46 sq m.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the corner areas are not being double-counted in the strip calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the walkway is built such that it overlaps with itself at the corners.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose I have a garden that's 15m by 10m.\n\nI add a 1m walkway around it.\n\nSo, the new length is 15m + 2m (1m on each end) = 17m.\n\nSimilarly, the new width is 10m + 2m (1m on each side) = 12m.\n\nArea of the larger rectangle: 17m *12m = 204 sq m.\n\nArea of the garden: 15m *10m = 150 sq m.\n\nTherefore, walkway area: 204 - 150 = 54 sq m.\n\nThis seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the walkway is only built along the perimeter, not covering the corners fully.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense, because if it's 1m wide all around, it should cover the corners completely.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of the walkway as being built outside the garden, adding 1m to each side.\n\nIn that case, the new dimensions should indeed be 17m by 12m.\n\nTherefore, the new dimensions of the garden including the walkway are 17m in length and 12m in width.\n\nPerhaps the discrepancy in the area calculations is due to a miscalculation in the strip method.\n\nIn any case, based on adding the walkway width to each side, the new dimensions should be:\n\nLength: 15m + 2*(1m) = 17m.\n\nWidth: 10m + 2*(1m) = 12m.\n\nSo, the final answer should be that the new dimensions are 17 meters in length and 12 meters in width.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17 \\text{ meters in length and } 12 \\text{ meters in width}} \\]"
