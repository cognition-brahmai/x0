        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have 30 students in a class, and each student received either 3 or 4 pencils. The total number of pencils given out is 105. We need to find out how many students received 4 pencils.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what's being asked. We have two types of students: those who received 3 pencils and those who received 4 pencils. Let's denote the number of students who received 3 pencils as x, and the number of students who received 4 pencils as y.\n\nSo, we have two variables:\n\n- x = number of students who received 3 pencils\n\n- y = number of students who received 4 pencils\n\nWe know two things:\n\n1. The total number of students is 30.\n\n2. The total number of pencils is 105.\n\nThis gives us two equations:\n\n1. x + y = 30 (since the total number of students is 30)\n\n2. 3x + 4y = 105 (since each student who received 3 pencils contributes 3 pencils, and each who received 4 contributes 4 pencils, totaling 105 pencils)\n\nNow, we have a system of linear equations, and we need to solve for y, which represents the number of students who received 4 pencils.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for x:\n\nx = 30 - y\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n3(30 - y) + 4y = 105\n\nLet's expand this:\n\n90 - 3y + 4y = 105\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n90 + y = 105\n\nNow, subtract 90 from both sides:\n\ny = 105 - 90\n\ny = 15\n\nSo, 15 students received 4 pencils.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If y = 15, then x = 30 - 15 = 15. So, 15 students received 3 pencils, and 15 students received 4 pencils.\n\nTotal pencils would be:\n\n(15 students * 3 pencils) + (15 students * 4 pencils) = 45 + 60 = 105 pencils, which matches the total given.\n\nLooks good! So, the answer is 15 students received 4 pencils.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
