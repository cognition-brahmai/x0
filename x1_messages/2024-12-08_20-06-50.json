        "content": "Ah, you're referring to the iconic landmark in London that's often confused with Big Ben itself. The correct name for the clock tower is the \"Elizabeth Tower.\" It was renamed in 2012 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. However, many people still refer to it as \"Big Ben,\" which actually is the name of the largest bell housed within the tower. So, to clarify, Big Ben is the bell, and the tower it's in is called the Elizabeth Tower."
