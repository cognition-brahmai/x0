        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with 4 red balls and 6 green balls. So, total balls in the box are 4 red plus 6 green, that's 10 balls altogether.\n\nNow, the process is: I draw one ball, look at its color, and put it back in the box. I do this three times, and I need to find the probability that I see exactly two red balls in these three draws.\n\nAlright, since I'm putting the ball back each time, that means each draw is independent of the others. The outcome of one draw doesn't affect the next one because the conditions are reset each time I put the ball back.\n\nSo, this sounds like a binomial probability problem. Binomial probability is used when there are a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes: success or failure. In this case, drawing a red ball can be considered a success, and drawing a green ball a failure.\n\nThe formula for binomial probability is:\n\n\\[ P(k) = C(n,k) \\times (p)^k \\times (1-p)^{n-k} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of trials (in this case, 3 draws),\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of successes (exactly 2 red balls),\n\n- \\( p \\) is the probability of success on a single trial (probability of drawing a red ball in one draw),\n\n- \\( C(n,k) \\) is the combination of \\( n \\) things taken \\( k \\) at a time.\n\nFirst, I need to find \\( p \\), the probability of drawing a red ball in one draw.\n\nThere are 4 red balls out of 10 total balls, so:\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{4}{10} = 0.4 \\]\n\nThen, \\( 1 - p \\) is the probability of drawing a green ball:\n\n\\[ 1 - p = 0.6 \\]\n\nNow, \\( n = 3 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\).\n\nSo, plugging into the formula:\n\n\\[ P(2) = C(3,2) \\times (0.4)^2 \\times (0.6)^{1} \\]\n\nI need to calculate \\( C(3,2) \\), which is the number of ways to choose 2 successes out of 3 trials.\n\n\\[ C(3,2) = \\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \\frac{6}{2 \\times 1} = 3 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P(2) = 3 \\times (0.4)^2 \\times 0.6 \\]\n\nCalculating \\( (0.4)^2 \\):\n\n\\[ (0.4)^2 = 0.16 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 0.16 = 0.48 \\]\n\nFinally,\n\n\\[ 0.48 \\times 0.6 = 0.288 \\]\n\nSo, the probability of drawing exactly two red balls in three draws is 0.288, or 28.8%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach this problem differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to list all possible sequences where exactly two out of three draws are red.\n\nThe possible sequences are:\n\n1. Red, Red, Green\n\n2. Red, Green, Red\n\n3. Green, Red, Red\n\nEach of these sequences has the same probability, since draws are independent.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for one sequence, say Red, Red, Green.\n\nProbability of Red on first draw: 0.4\n\nProbability of Red on second draw: 0.4\n\nProbability of Green on third draw: 0.6\n\nSo, the probability of this sequence is:\n\n\\[ 0.4 \\times 0.4 \\times 0.6 = 0.096 \\]\n\nSimilarly, the other two sequences will each have the same probability of 0.096.\n\nSince these are mutually exclusive events (they can't happen at the same time), I can add their probabilities together to get the total probability of exactly two reds.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly two reds}) = 3 \\times 0.096 = 0.288 \\]\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to approach this problem.\n\nI could also use the binomial probability formula again, but let's see if I can use the general probability formula.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes in three draws, with replacement, is \\( 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 1000 \\), since there are 10 balls each time.\n\nBut that might not be the best way, because balls are distinguishable, but maybe I can think in terms of red and green.\n\nAlternatively, since we're dealing with colors and not individual ball identities, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of reds and greens.\n\nBut I think the binomial approach is the most straightforward here.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate it using combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red draws out of 3 is \\( C(3,2) = 3 \\).\n\nThe probability for each of these ways is \\( (0.4)^2 \\times 0.6 \\), which is 0.096, and multiplying by 3 gives 0.288 again.\n\nSo, no matter how I look at it, the answer remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing exactly two red balls in three draws is 0.288, or 28.8%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.288} \\]"
