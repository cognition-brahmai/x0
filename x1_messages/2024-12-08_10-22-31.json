        "content": "Let's see. The train is going from Town A to Town B, and the distance between them is 180 kilometers. The train's speed is constant at 60 kilometers per hour. It leaves Town A at 2 PM, and I need to find out when it arrives in Town B.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how long the journey takes. Since speed is distance divided by time, or v = d/t, I can rearrange that to find time, which is t = d/v.\n\nSo, plugging in the values, t = 180 km / 60 km/h. That should give me the time it takes for the train to travel from Town A to Town B.\n\nLet me do the math: 180 divided by 60 is 3. So, the journey takes 3 hours.\n\nNow, if the train leaves at 2 PM and takes 3 hours, I just need to add 3 hours to the departure time to get the arrival time.\n\n2 PM plus 3 hours is 5 PM.\n\nSo, the train should arrive in Town B at 5 PM.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check that. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nLet me think again. Distance is 180 km, speed is 60 km/h, so time is indeed 3 hours. Adding that to 2 PM gives 5 PM.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
