This tool is helpful in finding a list of sites that may or may not contain the answer to the user's question. The function does not directly answer the question; instead, it finds a list of sites that may have the answer.\nSiteLoader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline-delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkFinder[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline-delimited response of links.\nAIQA[input]: Artificial Intelligence Question Answering model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g. What color is the dog, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What is the population of Tokyo and how has it changed over the last decade?"

        "content": "Alright, I need to find out the population of Tokyo and how it has changed over the last decade. I have some tools to help me with this. Let's see how I can use them step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably look up the current population of Tokyo. I can use DuckDuckGo for that. So, I'll search \"population of Tokyo\" on DuckDuckGo. That should give me a list of websites that have information about Tokyo's population.\n\nOnce I have those websites, I need to load their content to read about the population. So, after getting the search results from DuckDuckGo, I can use SiteLoader to load the content of those websites.\n\nBut wait, SiteLoader needs links as input, and DuckDuckGo gives me a list of links. So, maybe I can directly pass the output of DuckDuckGo to SiteLoader. That should give me the text content of those pages.\n\nNow, with the text content, I need to find out the population figure. Maybe I can use AIQA to ask a question like \"What is the population of Tokyo?\" and provide the text content as evidence. That should give me the current population.\n\nNext, I need to find out how the population has changed over the last decade. Maybe I can search for \"Tokyo population change over the last decade\" on DuckDuckGo again. That should give me other websites with information about population trends in Tokyo.\n\nAgain, I'll need to load those websites using SiteLoader and then use AIQA to analyze the text and find out how the population has changed over the last 10 years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one of the initial websites already has information about both the current population and the changes over time. In that case, I might not need a separate search for the population change.\n\nLet me think about the sequence here.\n\nPlan:\n\n1. Use DuckDuckGo to search for \"population of Tokyo\".\n\n:evidence0: = DuckDuckGo[\"population of Tokyo\"]\n\n2. Use SiteLoader to load the content of the top search results.\n\n:evidence1: = SiteLoader[:evidence0:]\n\n3. Use AIQA to extract the current population from the loaded content.\n\n:evidence2: = AIQA[\"What is the population of Tokyo? Given context: \" + :evidence1:]\n\n4. Now, search for \"Tokyo population change over the last decade\".\n\n:evidence3: = DuckDuckGo[\"Tokyo population change over the last decade\"]\n\n5. Load the content of these search results.\n\n:evidence4: = SiteLoader[:evidence3:]\n\n6. Use AIQA to analyze this content and describe how the population has changed over the last decade.\n\n:evidence5: = AIQA[\"How has the population of Tokyo changed over the last decade? Given context: \" + :evidence4:]\n\n7. Finally, combine the current population and the population change information to form the complete answer.\n\nAnswer: :evidence2: and :evidence5:\n\nBut maybe I can optimize this a bit. Perhaps one search can give me both the current population and the population change over the last decade.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\n1. Search for \"Tokyo population over the last decade\".\n\n:evidence0: = DuckDuckGo[\"Tokyo population over the last decade\"]\n\n2. Load the content of these search results.\n\n:evidence1: = SiteLoader[:evidence0:]\n\n3. Use AIQA to extract both the current population and the population change over the last decade from this content.\n\n:evidence2: = AIQA[\"What is the current population of Tokyo and how has it changed over the last decade? Given context: \" + :evidence1:]\n\n4. If the information is not sufficient, perform a separate search for \"current population of Tokyo\".\n\n:evidence3: = DuckDuckGo[\"current population of Tokyo\"]\n\n5. Load the content of these search results.\n\n:evidence4: = SiteLoader[:evidence3:]\n\n6. Use AIQA to extract the current population.\n\n:evidence5: = AIQA[\"What is the current population of Tokyo? Given context: \" + :evidence4:]\n\n7. Combine the population change information from :evidence2: and the current population from :evidence5: to form the final answer.\n\nAnswer: :evidence5: and :evidence2:\n\nThis seems more efficient because it reduces the number of searches and loading operations. I'll go with this plan.\n\nSo, first, I'll search for \"Tokyo population over the last decade\" using DuckDuckGo, load the content of the search results, and then use AIQA to extract both the current population and the population change over the last decade. If the current population isn't adequately covered, I'll do a separate search for that and combine the information.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo generate an optimal response to the user's question about the population of Tokyo and its change over the last decade, we can use a combination of search, content loading, and AI question-answering tools. Here's a step-by-step plan to achieve this:\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Search for population data over the last decade:**\n   - Use the `DuckDuckGo` tool to search for \"Tokyo population over the last decade\".\n   - This will provide a list of websites that may contain the required information.\n\n2. **Load the content of the search results:**\n   - Use the `SiteLoader` tool to load the content of the top search results obtained from the DuckDuckGo search.\n   - This will give us plain text content that we can analyze further.\n\n3. **Extract both current population and population change using AIQA:**\n   - Use the `AIQA` tool to ask a question that requests both the current population of Tokyo and how it has changed over the last decade, based on the loaded content.\n   - This approach aims to gather all required information in one step if possible.\n\n4. **Handle insufficient information by performing a separate search for current population:**\n   - If the initial search and analysis do not provide sufficient data on the current population, conduct a separate search using DuckDuckGo for \"current population of Tokyo\".\n   - Load the content of these new search results using `SiteLoader`.\n\n5. **Extract the current population from the separate search:**\n   - Use `AIQA` to ask a question that extracts the current population of Tokyo based on the newly loaded content.\n\n6. **Combine the information:**\n   - Combine the population change information from the first AIQA response with the current population information from the second AIQA response to form a comprehensive answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```plaintext\nPlan: Search for \"Tokyo population over the last decade\" to get both current population and population change data.\n\n:evidence0: = DuckDuckGo[\"Tokyo population over the last decade\"]\n\nPlan: Load the content of the search results.\n\n:evidence1: = SiteLoader[:evidence0:]\n\nPlan: Use AIQA to extract both current population and population change over the last decade.\n\n:evidence2: = AIQA[\"What is the current population of Tokyo and how has it changed over the last decade? Given context: \" + :evidence1:]\n\nPlan: If :evidence2: does not provide sufficient information about the current population, perform a separate search for \"current population of Tokyo\".\n\n:evidence3: = DuckDuckGo[\"current population of Tokyo\"]\n\nPlan: Load the content of these new search results.\n\n:evidence4: = SiteLoader[:evidence3:]\n\nPlan: Use AIQA to extract the current population from the new context.\n\n:evidence5: = AIQA[\"What is the current population of Tokyo? Given context: \" + :evidence4:]\n\nPlan: Combine the information from :evidence2: and :evidence5: to form the final answer.\n\nAnswer: The current population of Tokyo is :evidence5:, and it has changed over the last decade as follows: :evidence2:\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initial Search and Content Loading:**\n   - By searching for \"Tokyo population over the last decade,\" we aim to find sources that discuss both the current population and its historical changes, optimizing the number of searches needed.\n\n2. **Information Extraction:**\n   - Using `AIQA`, we attempt to extract both pieces of information in one go, which is efficient if the sources provide comprehensive data.\n\n3. **Handling Insufficient Data:**\n   - If the initial approach does not yield sufficient data on the current population, a separate search for \"current population of Tokyo\" ensures that we can gather this specific information accurately.\n\n4. **Combining Results:**\n   - By combining the results from both AIQA queries, we ensure that the final answer is comprehensive and accurate, providing both the current population and the historical changes over the last decade."
