        "content": "So the company produces 1500 widgets every day, and it costs them $5 to make each one. Then they sell each widget for $8. We need to find out how much profit they make each day.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the total cost of production per day. Since they make 1500 widgets and each costs $5, we can multiply 1500 by 5.\n\n1500 \u00d7 5 = 7500\n\nSo, their total daily cost is $7500.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total revenue from selling these widgets. They sell each widget for $8, so we multiply the number of widgets by the selling price.\n\n1500 \u00d7 8 = 12000\n\nTheir total daily revenue is $12000.\n\nNow, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.\n\n12000 - 7500 = 4500\n\nTherefore, the company's daily profit is $4500.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else we should consider? Like overhead costs or other expenses? The question only mentions the production cost per widget and the selling price, so I think this is straightforward.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's double-check the calculations.\n\nTotal cost: 1500 widgets \u00d7 $5 = $7500\n\nTotal revenue: 1500 widgets \u00d7 $8 = $12000\n\nProfit: $12000 - $7500 = $4500\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could calculate the profit per widget first and then multiply by the number of widgets.\n\nProfit per widget: Selling price - Cost price = $8 - $5 = $3\n\nTotal profit: 1500 widgets \u00d7 $3 = $4500\n\nSame answer.\n\nSo, their daily profit is $4500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4500} \\]"
