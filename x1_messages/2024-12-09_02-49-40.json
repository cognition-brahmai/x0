        "content": "So, let's see here. There are 5 families in the town, and each family has 2 children. The total number of people in the town is 25. I need to find out how many adults there are.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many children there are in total. Since each family has 2 children and there are 5 families, that would be 5 families times 2 children per family, which is 10 children.\n\nNow, if the total number of people in the town is 25, and there are 10 children, then the number of adults should be the total number of people minus the number of children. So, 25 minus 10 equals 15 adults.\n\nWait a minute, but I'm wondering if there might be more to this. Maybe some families have more adults than others, or perhaps there are single-parent families. But according to the information given, each family has 2 children, but it doesn't specify anything about the number of adults per family. So, maybe I need to assume that each family has two parents, a mother and a father.\n\nIf that's the case, then each family has 2 adults and 2 children, making each family consist of 4 people. So, 5 families times 4 people per family would be 20 people in total. But the problem states that the total number of people in the town is 25. That means my assumption must be wrong.\n\nPerhaps some families have more than two adults. Let me think differently. If each family has 2 children, and the total number of children is 10, and the total population is 25, then the number of adults is 25 minus 10, which is 15, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut maybe there are some adults who don't belong to any family, like singles or something. The problem doesn't specify that all adults are part of families. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says \"each family has 2 children,\" but it doesn't specify how many adults are in each family. Maybe some families have one adult, some have two, or maybe more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are extended families where multiple generations live together, adding more adults.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should consider that each family has 2 children and an unspecified number of adults, and the total population is 25.\n\nLet me denote the number of adults in each family as A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 for families 1 through 5, respectively. Each family has 2 children, so the total population is the sum of all adults plus the total number of children.\n\nSo, total population = (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5) + (2*5) = (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5) + 10 = 25.\n\nTherefore, A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 = 25 - 10 = 15.\n\nSo, the total number of adults in the town is 15.\n\nBut perhaps there are adults who are not part of any family. The problem says \"each family has 2 children,\" but it doesn't say that all adults are part of families. Maybe there are single adults who don't have children and aren't part of any family.\n\nIf that's the case, then the number of adults in families would be less than 15, and the remaining adults would be singles.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't provide any information about singles or adults without families. So, perhaps it's safe to assume that all adults are part of families.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the families share adults, meaning that some adults are part of multiple families, but that seems unlikely.\n\nGiven the information provided, the straightforward approach is to calculate the number of children, which is 5 families times 2 children per family, equaling 10 children. Then, subtracting that from the total population of 25 gives 15 adults.\n\nTherefore, there are 15 adults in the town.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
