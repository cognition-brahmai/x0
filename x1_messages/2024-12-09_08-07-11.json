The user is looking to find documents related to \"Artificial Intelligence\" within a specific date range, from 2010 to 2020. This clearly aligns with searching for keywords within documents and filtering by date.\n\nHere's how I would structure the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"document_search\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"keyword\": \"Artificial Intelligence\",\n    \"date_range\": {\n      \"start\": \"2010\",\n      \"end\": \"2020\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON specifies the function to use and provides the necessary parameters as per the user's request. The \"keyword\" parameter is set to \"Artificial Intelligence\", and the \"date_range\" parameter is set with \"start\" as \"2010\" and \"end\" as \"2020\", which matches the user's criteria for the time frame."
