        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company that sells two products: Product X and Product Y. The profit per unit for Product X is $10, and for Product Y, it's $15. The company sold a total of 100 units and made a total profit of $1200. We need to find out how many units of each product were sold.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of units of Product X sold.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of units of Product Y sold.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of units sold is 100.\n\n2. The total profit from selling these units is $1200.\n\nSo, we can write two equations based on these pieces of information.\n\nThe first equation is about the total units sold:\n\n\\[ x + y = 100 \\]\n\nThe second equation is about the total profit:\n\n\\[ 10x + 15y = 1200 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nOne way to solve this is by using the substitution method. Let's solve the first equation for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = 100 - y \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 10(100 - y) + 15y = 1200 \\]\n\nLet's simplify and solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ 1000 - 10y + 15y = 1200 \\]\n\n\\[ 1000 + 5y = 1200 \\]\n\n\\[ 5y = 200 \\]\n\n\\[ y = 40 \\]\n\nNow that we have \\( y = 40 \\), we can substitute this back into the equation \\( x = 100 - y \\) to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = 100 - 40 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 60 \\]\n\nSo, the company sold 60 units of Product X and 40 units of Product Y.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If they sold 60 units of Product X at $10 profit each, that's:\n\n\\[ 60 \\times 10 = 600 \\]\n\nAnd 40 units of Product Y at $15 profit each:\n\n\\[ 40 \\times 15 = 600 \\]\n\nAdding those profits together:\n\n\\[ 600 + 600 = 1200 \\]\n\nYes, that matches the total profit given in the problem. Also, the total units sold are \\( 60 + 40 = 100 \\), which matches the total units sold. So, our solution seems correct.\n\nAnother way to approach this is using the elimination method. Let's see how that works.\n\nWe have the same two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 100 \\)\n\n2. \\( 10x + 15y = 1200 \\)\n\nTo eliminate one of the variables, we can manipulate the equations so that when we add or subtract them, one variable cancels out.\n\nLet's multiply the first equation by 10 to align the coefficients of \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ 10x + 10y = 1000 \\]\n\nNow, we have:\n\n1. \\( 10x + 10y = 1000 \\)\n\n2. \\( 10x + 15y = 1200 \\)\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n\\[ (10x + 15y) - (10x + 10y) = 1200 - 1000 \\]\n\n\\[ 5y = 200 \\]\n\n\\[ y = 40 \\]\n\nAgain, we find \\( y = 40 \\), and then \\( x = 60 \\), just like before.\n\nThis confirms our solution using a different method.\n\nAlternatively, we could graph the two equations and find the point where they intersect, but that might be more time-consuming and less precise than algebraic methods.\n\nIt's also worth considering if there are any other possible solutions. For example, could there be negative values for \\( x \\) or \\( y \\)? In this context, negative units sold don't make sense, so we can restrict our solution to non-negative integers.\n\nAdditionally, since the total units sold are 100, both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) must be less than or equal to 100.\n\nIn this case, our solution \\( x = 60 \\) and \\( y = 40 \\) satisfies all these conditions.\n\nLet's also consider if there's a way to solve this problem using matrices. The system of equations can be represented in matrix form as:\n\n\\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 10 & 15 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 100 \\\\ 1200 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nWe can solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) by finding the inverse of the coefficient matrix and multiplying it by the constants matrix.\n\nFirst, find the determinant of the coefficient matrix:\n\n\\[ \\text{det} = (1)(15) - (1)(10) = 15 - 10 = 5 \\]\n\nSince the determinant is not zero, the inverse exists.\n\nThe inverse of the coefficient matrix is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{\\text{det}} \\begin{bmatrix} 15 & -10 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{5} \\begin{bmatrix} 15 & -10 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 & -2 \\\\ -0.2 & 0.2 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nNow, multiply the inverse by the constants matrix:\n\n\\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 3 & -2 \\\\ -0.2 & 0.2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 100 \\\\ 1200 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 3(100) + (-2)(1200) \\\\ -0.2(100) + 0.2(1200) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 300 - 2400 \\\\ -20 + 240 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -2100 \\\\ 220 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nWait a minute, that can't be right. I must have messed up the matrix inversion or multiplication.\n\nLet me double-check the inverse matrix. The formula for the inverse of a 2x2 matrix \\( \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix} \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{ad - bc} \\begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\\\ -c & a \\end{bmatrix} \\).\n\nSo, for our coefficient matrix \\( \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 10 & 15 \\end{bmatrix} \\), \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), \\( c = 10 \\), \\( d = 15 \\), and the determinant is \\( 15 - 10 = 5 \\).\n\nThus, the inverse should be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{5} \\begin{bmatrix} 15 & -1 \\\\ -10 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 & -0.2 \\\\ -2 & 0.2 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nNow, multiplying this inverse by the constants matrix:\n\n\\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 3 & -0.2 \\\\ -2 & 0.2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 100 \\\\ 1200 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 3(100) + (-0.2)(1200) \\\\ -2(100) + 0.2(1200) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 300 - 240 \\\\ -200 + 240 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 60 \\\\ 40 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nAh, there we go. That gives us \\( x = 60 \\) and \\( y = 40 \\), which matches our previous solutions.\n\nIt's good to see that no matter which method we use\u2014substitution, elimination, or matrices\u2014we arrive at the same answer.\n\nJust to explore further, suppose the company wants to maximize its profit. Given that Product Y has a higher profit per unit ($15 vs. $10), selling more of Product Y would be beneficial. However, in this specific scenario, the total units sold are fixed at 100, and the total profit is $1200.\n\nIf the company could choose how many of each to sell, what would be the optimal number to maximize profit?\n\nWell, since Product Y has a higher profit per unit, the company should sell as many units of Product Y as possible, given any constraints.\n\nBut in this problem, the total units sold are fixed at 100, so to maximize profit, they should sell all 100 units as Product Y.\n\nProfit would be \\( 100 \\times 15 = 1500 \\) dollars.\n\nHowever, in our original scenario, selling 60 units of X and 40 units of Y gives a profit of $1200, which is less than the maximum possible profit of $1500.\n\nThis suggests that if the company can influence the mix of products sold, it should aim to sell more of the higher-profit product, Product Y.\n\nBut in this specific problem, the total units sold and the total profit are given, and we're just to find out how many of each were sold to achieve that profit.\n\nAnother angle to consider is break-even analysis. Suppose the company has certain fixed costs; how many units of each product need to be sold to cover those costs?\n\nBut since the problem doesn't provide information on fixed costs, we can't apply break-even analysis here.\n\nAlternatively, if there were constraints on production capacity or other resources, that could affect how many of each product could be sold.\n\nBut again, the problem doesn't specify any such constraints, so we don't need to consider them.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the profit per unit might not be constant in real-world scenarios. There could be economies of scale, where selling larger quantities leads to lower per-unit costs, or pricing strategies that affect profit margins.\n\nHowever, in this problem, we're given fixed profit per unit, so we can treat those as constants.\n\nLet's consider if there's a way to set up the problem using ratios.\n\nThe profit from Product X is $10 per unit, and from Product Y is $15 per unit.\n\nThe total profit is $1200 from 100 units.\n\nWe can think about the average profit per unit.\n\nAverage profit per unit = total profit / total units = 1200 / 100 = $12 per unit.\n\nNow, Product X gives $10 per unit, and Product Y gives $15 per unit.\n\nSo, the average profit per unit is $12, which is between $10 and $15.\n\nWe can set up a weighted average equation.\n\nLet \\( p \\) be the proportion of units that are Product X.\n\nThen, \\( 1 - p \\) is the proportion of units that are Product Y.\n\nThe average profit per unit is:\n\n\\[ 10p + 15(1 - p) = 12 \\]\n\nLet's solve for \\( p \\):\n\n\\[ 10p + 15 - 15p = 12 \\]\n\n\\[ -5p + 15 = 12 \\]\n\n\\[ -5p = -3 \\]\n\n\\[ p = 0.6 \\]\n\nSo, 60% of the units are Product X, and 40% are Product Y.\n\nGiven that the total units are 100, this again gives us \\( x = 60 \\) and \\( y = 40 \\), consistent with our earlier findings.\n\nThis ratio approach provides a different perspective and confirms our solution.\n\nLet's think about this in terms of linear combinations.\n\nWe have \\( 10x + 15y = 1200 \\), and \\( x + y = 100 \\).\n\nWe can express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\) from the second equation: \\( y = 100 - x \\).\n\nSubstituting into the first equation:\n\n\\[ 10x + 15(100 - x) = 1200 \\]\n\nWhich is the same as our earlier substitution method.\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ 10x + 1500 - 15x = 1200 \\]\n\n\\[ -5x + 1500 = 1200 \\]\n\n\\[ -5x = -300 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 60 \\]\n\nThen, \\( y = 100 - 60 = 40 \\).\n\nYet another confirmation of our solution.\n\nSuppose we didn't know the total units sold, only the total profit and the profit per unit for each product.\n\nCould we still find the number of units sold for each product?\n\nWell, no, because there would be infinite combinations of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that could satisfy the profit equation.\n\nFor example, if only \\( x \\) is sold:\n\n\\[ 10x = 1200 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 120 \\]\n\nBut that would require selling 120 units of Product X, which might not be possible if there are constraints on production or market demand.\n\nSimilarly, if only \\( y \\) is sold:\n\n\\[ 15y = 1200 \\]\n\n\\[ y = 80 \\]\n\nSo, without the total units sold, we can't determine the exact numbers.\n\nReturning to our original problem, it's clear that with the given constraints, the company sold 60 units of Product X and 40 units of Product Y.\n\nThis problem is a classic example of a system of linear equations, which is fundamental in algebra and has applications in various fields, including economics, engineering, and science.\n\nIt's always a good idea to verify the solution by plugging the values back into the original equations.\n\nLet's do that:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 60 + 40 = 100 \\) \u2705\n\n2. \\( 10x + 15y = 10(60) + 15(40) = 600 + 600 = 1200 \\) \u2705\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so we can be confident in our solution.\n\nIn conclusion, the company sold 60 units of Product X and 40 units of Product Y to achieve a total profit of $1200 from selling 100 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60 \\text{ units of Product X and } 40 \\text{ units of Product Y}} \\]"
