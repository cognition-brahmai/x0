        "content": "Alright, I've got this question to answer: \"Who directed the movie 'Inception', how was it rated on Rotten Tomatoes, how much did it earn at the box office, and what are people saying about it on Twitter?\" Okay, let's break this down into parts. The question has four main things to find out:\n\n1. Who directed \"Inception\"?\n\n2. What's its rating on Rotten Tomatoes?\n\n3. How much did it make at the box office?\n\n4. What are people saying about it on Twitter?\n\nI have some tools to help me with this:\n\n- IMDb: Good for movie-related information, so probably where I can find the director.\n\n- RottenTomatoes: Specifically for movie ratings and reviews.\n\n- BoxOfficeMojo: For box office data.\n\n- Twitter: To search for tweets about the movie.\n\n- AskAI: A general question-answering AI.\n\nLet's tackle each part one by one.\n\nFirst, finding out who directed \"Inception\". IMDb seems like the perfect tool for this since it has lots of movie data, including director information. So, I'll use IMDb[\"Inception director\"] to get that.\n\nEvidence0 = IMDb[\"Inception director\"]\n\nOkay, now that I have the director's name from Evidence0, I can move on to the next part.\n\nNext, I need to find out the rating on Rotten Tomatoes. RottenTomatoes is designed for this purpose, so I'll use RottenTomatoes[\"Inception rating\"] to get the rating.\n\nEvidence1 = RottenTomatoes[\"Inception rating\"]\n\nGreat, now I have the rating.\n\nNow, for the box office earnings, BoxOfficeMojo is the tool to use. So, I'll input \"Inception box office\" into BoxOfficeMojo.\n\nEvidence2 = BoxOfficeMojo[\"Inception box office\"]\n\nAlright, now I have the box office earnings.\n\nLastly, I need to see what people are saying about \"Inception\" on Twitter. For that, I'll use the Twitter tool with the input \"Inception movie\".\n\nEvidence3 = Twitter[\"Inception movie\"]\n\nNow, I have all four pieces of information:\n\n- Director: From Evidence0\n\n- Rotten Tomatoes rating: From Evidence1\n\n- Box office earnings: From Evidence2\n\n- Twitter comments: From Evidence3\n\nI should probably organize this information neatly for the user. Maybe something like:\n\n\"Inception was directed by [Director's Name]. It has a rating of [Rating] on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie earned [Box Office Earnings] at the box office. According to Twitter, people are saying [summary of Twitter comments].\"\n\nBut wait, the Twitter tool might give me a bunch of tweets, and I need to summarize them. Maybe I can use AskAI to help me summarize the Twitter comments.\n\nSo, I'll take Evidence3 and input it into AskAI, asking it to summarize the tweets about \"Inception\".\n\nEvidence4 = AskAI[\"Summarize these tweets about Inception: \" + Evidence3]\n\nNow, Evidence4 should have a summary of the Twitter comments.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\"Inception was directed by [Director's Name]. It has a rating of [Rating] on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie earned [Box Office Earnings] at the box office. According to Twitter, people are saying [Summary from Evidence4].\"\n\nI think that covers all the parts of the question. Let me just double-check:\n\n- Director: Covered by IMDb.\n\n- Rotten Tomatoes rating: Covered by RottenTomatoes.\n\n- Box office earnings: Covered by BoxOfficeMojo.\n\n- Twitter comments: Covered by Twitter and summarized by AskAI.\n\nEverything seems in place. Now, I just need to plug in the actual information from each evidence variable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nTo answer the question \"Who directed the movie 'Inception', how was it rated on Rotten Tomatoes, how much did it earn at the box office, and what are people saying about it on Twitter?\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Use IMDb to find the director of \"Inception\":\n   - Input: \"Inception director\"\n   - Evidence0: [Output from IMDb]\n\n2. Use RottenTomatoes to find the movie's rating:\n   - Input: \"Inception rating\"\n   - Evidence1: [Output from RottenTomatoes]\n\n3. Use BoxOfficeMojo to find the box office earnings:\n   - Input: \"Inception box office\"\n   - Evidence2: [Output from BoxOfficeMojo]\n\n4. Use Twitter to find recent tweets about the movie:\n   - Input: \"Inception movie\"\n   - Evidence3: [Output from Twitter]\n\n5. Use AskAI to summarize the Twitter comments:\n   - Input: \"Summarize these tweets about Inception: \" + Evidence3\n   - Evidence4: [Output from AskAI]\n\n6. Compile the information into a cohesive response:\n   - \"Inception was directed by [Director's Name]. It has a rating of [Rating] on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie earned [Box Office Earnings] at the box office. According to Twitter, people are saying [Summary from Evidence4].\""
