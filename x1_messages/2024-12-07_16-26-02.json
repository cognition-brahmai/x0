        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're told that the ratio of cats to dogs in a certain city is 5:4, and there are 9,000 more cats than dogs. We need to find out how many cats and dogs there are in total.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a ratio means. A ratio of 5:4 means that for every 5 cats, there are 4 dogs. It's like dividing them into groups where each group has 5 cats and 4 dogs.\n\nNow, let's denote the number of cats as C and the number of dogs as D. According to the ratio, C/D = 5/4. That means C = (5/4)D.\n\nBut we also know that there are 9,000 more cats than dogs, so C = D + 9,000.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. C = (5/4)D\n\n2. C = D + 9,000\n\nSince both expressions equal C, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n(5/4)D = D + 9,000\n\nNow, let's solve for D.\n\nFirst, subtract D from both sides:\n\n(5/4)D - D = 9,000\n\nTo make it easier, let's express D as (4/4)D:\n\n(5/4)D - (4/4)D = 9,000\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(1/4)D = 9,000\n\nNow, to find D, multiply both sides by 4:\n\nD = 9,000 * 4\n\nD = 36,000\n\nSo, there are 36,000 dogs.\n\nNow, let's find the number of cats using the second equation:\n\nC = D + 9,000\n\nC = 36,000 + 9,000\n\nC = 45,000\n\nTherefore, there are 45,000 cats and 36,000 dogs.\n\nTo check if this makes sense with the ratio:\n\n45,000 : 36,000 simplifies to 45:36, which further simplifies to 5:4, which matches the given ratio.\n\nAlso, 45,000 - 36,000 = 9,000, which matches the difference given.\n\nSo, the total number of cats and dogs is 45,000 + 36,000 = 81,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{81000} \\]"
