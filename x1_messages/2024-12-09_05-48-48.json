        "content": "Let's see. So, Sam starts by eating half of a pizza on Monday. That means there's half left after Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, he eats half of what remained from Monday, which is half of the half that was left, so that's a quarter of the whole pizza. Now, the amount left would be the half that was left minus the quarter he ate on Tuesday, which leaves a quarter.\n\nOn Wednesday, he eats half of what remained from Tuesday, which is half of the quarter left, so that's an eighth of the whole pizza. Now, the amount left would be the quarter that was left minus the eighth he ate on Wednesday, which leaves an eighth.\n\nI'm starting to see a pattern here. Each day, he's eating half of what's left from the previous day, which means the amount he eats each day is half of what he ate the day before.\n\nSo, on Monday, he ate 1/2.\n\nOn Tuesday, he ate 1/4.\n\nOn Wednesday, he ate 1/8.\n\nOn Thursday, he would eat 1/16.\n\nOn Friday, 1/32.\n\nOn Saturday, 1/64.\n\nAnd on Sunday, 1/128.\n\nTo find out how much he ate in total by Sunday, I need to add up all these fractions:\n\nTotal eaten = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64 + 1/128.\n\nThis looks like a geometric series where the first term a = 1/2 and the common ratio r = 1/2.\n\nThe sum S of the first n terms of a geometric series is given by:\n\nS = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nIn this case, a = 1/2, r = 1/2, and n = 7 (since from Monday to Sunday is 7 days).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nS = (1/2) * (1 - (1/2)^7) / (1 - 1/2)\n\nS = (1/2) * (1 - 1/128) / (1/2)\n\nS = (1/2) * (127/128) / (1/2)\n\nS = (1/2) * (127/128) * (2/1)\n\nS = (1/2) * (2/1) * (127/128)\n\nS = 1 * (127/128)\n\nS = 127/128\n\nSo, by Sunday, Sam has eaten 127/128 of the pizza.\n\nWait a minute, that makes sense because each day he's eating half of what's left, so the amount left keeps getting halved each day.\n\nStarting with 1 whole pizza:\n\nAfter Monday: 1/2 left\n\nAfter Tuesday: 1/4 left\n\nAfter Wednesday: 1/8 left\n\nAfter Thursday: 1/16 left\n\nAfter Friday: 1/32 left\n\nAfter Saturday: 1/64 left\n\nAfter Sunday: 1/128 left\n\nSo, the amount eaten is 1 - 1/128 = 127/128, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, adding up the fractions:\n\n1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64 + 1/128\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4\n\n3/4 + 1/8 = 7/8\n\n7/8 + 1/16 = 15/16\n\n15/16 + 1/32 = 31/32\n\n31/32 + 1/64 = 63/64\n\n63/64 + 1/128 = 127/128\n\nYes, same result.\n\nSo, by Sunday, Sam has eaten 127/128 of the pizza.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{127}{128}} \\]"
