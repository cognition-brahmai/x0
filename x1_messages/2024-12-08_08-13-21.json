        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a bag with 4 red balls and 6 blue balls, making a total of 10 balls. We're drawing 3 balls at random without replacement, and we want to find the probability that exactly 2 of them are red.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once we draw a ball, we don't put it back into the bag. So, each draw affects the remaining balls in the bag.\n\nNow, to find the probability of drawing exactly 2 red balls out of 3, we can use the concept of combinations. Combinations help us figure out how many ways we can choose a certain number of items from a larger set without regard to the order.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the total number of items, \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nIn this problem, we need to find two things:\n\n1. The number of ways to choose exactly 2 red balls out of 4.\n\n2. The number of ways to choose 1 blue ball out of 6 (since we're drawing 3 balls in total and 2 are red, the remaining one must be blue).\n\nThen, we'll divide the product of these two by the total number of ways to choose any 3 balls out of the 10.\n\nLet's calculate each part.\n\nFirst, the number of ways to choose 2 red balls from 4:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{2 \\times 1 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, the number of ways to choose 1 blue ball from 6:\n\n\\[\nC(6, 1) = \\frac{6!}{1!(6 - 1)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{1 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{720}{120} = 6\n\\]\n\nNow, we multiply these two results to find the number of favorable outcomes:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 6 = 36\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of ways to choose any 3 balls out of the 10:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 3) = \\frac{10!}{3!(10 - 3)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7!}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\times 7!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{6} = \\frac{720}{6} = 120\n\\]\n\nFinally, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{exactly 2 red}) = \\frac{36}{120} = \\frac{3}{10} = 0.3\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability of drawing exactly 2 red balls out of 3 is 0.3 or 30%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the combinations for 2 red balls from 4 are indeed 6.\n\nThen, combinations for 1 blue ball from 6 are also 6.\n\nMultiplying them gives 36 favorable outcomes.\n\nTotal combinations of 3 balls from 10 are 120.\n\nSo, 36 divided by 120 is indeed 0.3.\n\nAlternatively, we could think about the problem step by step, considering the\u987a\u5e8f of drawing the balls.\n\nFor example, the probability of drawing a red ball first, then another red ball, then a blue ball.\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter in this problem, using combinations is the more straightforward approach.\n\nAlternatively, if we did want to consider order, we would have to consider all possible sequences that result in exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball.\n\nThere are 3 such sequences: RRB, RBR, BRR.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for one sequence and then multiply by the number of sequences.\n\nTake the sequence RRB:\n\nProbability of first ball being red: 4/10\n\nThen, second ball being red: 3/9 (since one red ball has already been drawn)\n\nThird ball being blue: 6/8 (since two balls have already been drawn, one red and one red)\n\nSo, the probability for RRB is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{10} \\times \\frac{3}{9} \\times \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{4}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{4 \\times 1 \\times 3}{10 \\times 3 \\times 4} = \\frac{12}{120} = \\frac{1}{10}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, for RBR:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{10} \\times \\frac{6}{9} \\times \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{4}{10} \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{4 \\times 2 \\times 3}{10 \\times 3 \\times 8} = \\frac{24}{240} = \\frac{1}{10}\n\\]\n\nAnd for BRR:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{10} \\times \\frac{4}{9} \\times \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{6}{10} \\times \\frac{4}{9} \\times \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{6 \\times 4 \\times 3}{10 \\times 9 \\times 8} = \\frac{72}{720} = \\frac{1}{10}\n\\]\n\nAdding these up:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{3}{10} = 0.3\n\\]\n\nSo, we get the same result as before, which reinforces that our initial answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing exactly 2 red balls out of 3 is 0.3 or 30%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.3} \\]"
