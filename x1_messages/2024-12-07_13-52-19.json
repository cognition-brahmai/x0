        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a baker uses 2 eggs to make one cake, and he wants to bake 50 cakes. I need to figure out how many dozens of eggs he needs, and remember that one dozen equals 12 eggs. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total number of eggs required for 50 cakes. Since each cake requires 2 eggs, I can calculate the total eggs by multiplying the number of cakes by the eggs per cake. So, that's 50 cakes times 2 eggs per cake, which gives me 100 eggs in total.\n\nNow, I need to convert that total number of eggs into dozens. Since one dozen is 12 eggs, I can find out how many dozens are in 100 eggs by dividing 100 by 12. Let's do that division: 100 divided by 12 equals 8.333..., which means 8 dozens and a remainder.\n\nBut, in reality, you can't buy a fraction of a dozen eggs, at least not in most stores. So, the baker would need to purchase 9 dozens to have enough eggs for the 50 cakes. However, the question might be expecting a precise mathematical answer without considering practical constraints, so I should probably present the answer as 8.333... dozens.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check my calculations again to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's recalculate the total eggs: 50 cakes times 2 eggs per cake is indeed 100 eggs. Now, dividing 100 by 12: 12 times 8 is 96, and 100 minus 96 is 4, so there's a remainder of 4 eggs. That means the baker needs 8 full dozens plus 4 extra eggs.\n\nBut since eggs are often sold by the dozen, and you can't buy a partial dozen, the baker would need to buy 9 dozens to have enough eggs. However, the problem might be expecting the exact number of dozens, including the fraction. So, 100 divided by 12 is approximately 8.333, which can also be expressed as 8 dozen and 4 eggs.\n\nMaybe I should present both perspectives. Mathematically, it's 8.333 dozens, but practically, the baker needs to buy 9 dozens. But since the problem asks for how many dozens of eggs he needs, and considering that dozens are complete sets of 12, I think the answer should be rounded up to 9 dozens.\n\nLet me confirm this with unit conversion thinking. If 1 dozen = 12 eggs, then for 100 eggs, the number of dozens is 100/12, which is approximately 8.333. Since partial dozens aren't typically available, rounding up to the next whole number makes sense to ensure there are enough eggs.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of needing 100 eggs and knowing that 8 dozens give 96 eggs, which is 4 eggs short. Therefore, the baker must purchase an additional dozen to have a total of 108 eggs, which is more than enough.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to express this. Maybe the answer should be 8 dozen plus 4 eggs, but since the question specifies to answer in dozens, I need to stick to the dozen unit.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that 100 divided by 12 is 8 with a remainder of 4, which is equivalent to 8 and 4/12 dozens, which simplifies to 8 and 1/3 dozens. So, 8 1/3 dozens is another way to express the answer.\n\nHowever, in practical terms, the baker can't purchase a third of a dozen, so he'd need to buy 9 full dozens, which is 108 eggs, and have 8 eggs left over.\n\nBut the problem might be expecting the exact mathematical answer rather than the practical one. So, perhaps the best answer is that the baker needs 8 1/3 dozens of eggs.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this. If the baker uses 2 eggs per cake and is making 50 cakes, that's 100 eggs, as I calculated earlier. Now, to find out how many dozens that is, I divide by 12.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how many cakes can be made from one dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen is 12 eggs, and each cake requires 2 eggs, then one dozen can make 12 divided by 2, which is 6 cakes.\n\nSo, if one dozen makes 6 cakes, how many dozens are needed for 50 cakes? That would be 50 cakes divided by 6 cakes per dozen, which is approximately 8.333 dozens, matching my earlier calculation.\n\nAgain, since the baker can't use a fraction of a dozen, he'd need to purchase 9 dozens to have enough eggs for 50 cakes.\n\nBut to strictly answer the question as asked, which is to find out how many dozens of eggs he needs, and considering that dozens are complete units, I think the answer should be expressed as 9 dozens.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider if there's a way to purchase eggs that aren't in dozens, but the problem specifies \"dozens of eggs,\" so perhaps purchasing in partial dozens isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the baker can buy eggs individually, but the problem mentions \"dozens,\" so I think the expectation is to answer in terms of whole dozens.\n\nLet me consider the context again. The problem says, \"how many dozens of eggs does he need?\" It doesn't specify whether he can buy partial dozens or not, but since dozens are standard units of purchase, and partial dozens might not be available, it's reasonable to assume that he must buy whole dozens.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that 8 dozens provide 96 eggs (which is 4 short of the required 100), the baker must buy 9 dozens to have enough eggs.\n\nBut to be precise, 9 dozens is 108 eggs, which is 8 eggs more than needed. However, without the option to buy partial dozens, this is the only way to ensure he has sufficient eggs.\n\nAlternatively, if the baker can buy eggs in other units, such as by the ten or individually, the answer might be different, but the problem specifies \"dozens.\"\n\nTherefore, the baker needs to purchase 9 dozens of eggs to bake 50 cakes, each requiring 2 eggs.\n\nWait, but mathematically, 100 divided by 12 is 8.333..., which is 8 dozen and 4 eggs. So, technically, he needs 8 dozen plus 4 eggs. But since he can only buy in dozens, he has to round up to 9 dozens.\n\nAlternatively, if the baker can purchase eggs in other quantities, perhaps he could buy 8 dozens and 1 carton of 10 eggs, but the problem doesn't provide options beyond dozens.\n\nGiven the information provided, and sticking to purchasing in dozens, the baker needs to buy 9 dozens of eggs.\n\nBut to present the answer in terms of dozens, considering that dozens are the unit of purchase, I think 9 dozens is the way to go.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations one last time. 50 cakes times 2 eggs per cake equals 100 eggs. 100 divided by 12 equals 8.333..., which means 8 dozen and 4 eggs, but since only dozens can be purchased, the baker must buy 9 dozens.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 9 dozens of eggs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
