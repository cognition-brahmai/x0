        "content": "So the factory currently produces 450 units per day, and they're planning to increase that by 20%. I need to figure out how many units they'll produce after the increase.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out what 20% of 450 is, and then add that to the original 450 units. That makes sense.\n\nSo, to find 20% of 450, I can calculate it by multiplying 450 by 20% or 0.20. Let me do that.\n\n450 multiplied by 0.20 is... let's see, 450 times 0.20 is 90. So, 20% of 450 is 90 units.\n\nNow, I need to add that increase to the original production amount. So, 450 units plus 90 units equals 540 units.\n\nTherefore, after the increase, the factory will produce 540 units per day.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe instead of finding 20% and adding it, I could multiply the original amount by 1.20 to get the increased amount in one step. Let me try that.\n\nSo, 450 multiplied by 1.20. That should give me the same result.\n\n450 times 1.20 is... 450 times 1 is 450, and 450 times 0.20 is 90, so adding them up gives 540 again.\n\nOkay, good, that matches my first method. So, regardless of the approach, the factory will be producing 540 units per day after the 20% increase.\n\nI think that's straightforward. But just to be thorough, maybe I should check if there's any other factor I should consider. For example, are there any constraints or limitations mentioned that might affect production? Like, is the factory able to actually produce 540 units per day with their current resources?\n\nLooking back at the problem, it just says that the factory decides to increase production by 20% due to increased demand. It doesn't mention any constraints or limitations, so I think assuming that they can achieve this increase is reasonable for this problem.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies that this is a daily production rate, so the increase is also on a daily basis.\n\nLet me consider if the increase could be interpreted differently, like a one-time increase or something, but the wording says \"increase production by 20%,\" which typically means a\u6301\u7eed\u7684 increase in daily production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the increase is applied annually or over another period, but since the original production is given per day, it's most logical to assume that the increase is also on a daily basis.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the increase is compounded or something, but this seems like a straightforward percentage increase, not involving any compounding.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the factory will produce 540 units per day after increasing their production by 20%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{540} \\]"
