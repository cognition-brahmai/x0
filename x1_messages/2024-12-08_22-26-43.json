        "content": "So there's this problem here: In a class of 30 students, 60% passed an exam. Of those who passed, 20% scored distinction. I need to find out how many students scored a distinction. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many students passed the exam. Since 60% of the class passed, and there are 30 students in total, I can calculate the number of students who passed by finding 60% of 30.\n\nTo calculate 60% of 30, I can multiply 30 by 0.60 (since 60% equals 0.60 in decimal form).\n\nSo, 30 \u00d7 0.60 = 18 students passed the exam.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many of these passing students scored a distinction. It's given that 20% of those who passed scored a distinction. So, I need to find 20% of 18.\n\nAgain, to find 20% of 18, I can multiply 18 by 0.20 (since 20% equals 0.20 in decimal form).\n\nSo, 18 \u00d7 0.20 = 3.6\n\nNow, since the number of students can't be a decimal, I need to interpret this result. In reality, you can't have 0.6 of a student, so perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number.\n\nRounding 3.6 to the nearest whole number gives us 4.\n\nWait a minute, but 3.6 is closer to 4 than to 3, but in the context of counting students, we might need to consider if partial students are possible, which they're not. However, since the calculation gives 3.6, and we can't have a fraction of a student, we might need to reconsider our approach.\n\nMaybe there's a better way to approach this problem. Let's try calculating it using fractions to see if that gives a clearer picture.\n\nFirst, 60% of 30 students passed the exam. 60% can be written as 3/5 (since 60 \u00f7 100 = 0.6, and 0.6 = 3/5).\n\nSo, number of students who passed = 3/5 \u00d7 30 = (3 \u00d7 30)/5 = 90/5 = 18 students.\n\nNext, 20% of those who passed scored a distinction. 20% can be written as 1/5 (since 20 \u00f7 100 = 0.2, and 0.2 = 1/5).\n\nSo, number of students who scored a distinction = 1/5 \u00d7 18 = 18/5 = 3.6\n\nAgain, we end up with 3.6, which is the same as before.\n\nHmm, this suggests that there might be an issue with the problem's numbers, as it's leading to a fraction of a student, which doesn't make sense in reality.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to interpret 20% of 18 differently. Maybe it's expecting us to apply the percentage directly without converting to decimals.\n\nLet me try that.\n\n20% of 18 is equal to (20/100) \u00d7 18 = (1/5) \u00d7 18 = 18/5 = 3.6\n\nSame result again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants us to consider only whole students and round down, since you can't have part of a student.\n\nIn that case, 3.6 would be rounded down to 3 students.\n\nBut that seems arbitrary. Maybe the problem is set up in a way that expects us to accept a non-integer result, but in reality, the number of students should be a whole number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's setup, and the numbers don't align to give a whole number of students scoring a distinction.\n\nGiven that, and considering standard practice, I think the best approach is to round to the nearest whole number, which would be 4 students.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have exact numbers, and maybe I'm miscalculating somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst calculation: 60% of 30.\n\n60% of 30 = 0.60 \u00d7 30 = 18 students passed.\n\nSecond calculation: 20% of 18.\n\n20% of 18 = 0.20 \u00d7 18 = 3.6\n\nAgain, 3.6 students, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that only 18 students passed, and then 20% of those 18 scored a distinction, but since we can't have a fraction of a student, perhaps the problem expects us to interpret this as 3 students scoring a distinction.\n\nBut 3.6 is closer to 4, so maybe it's 4 students.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have whole numbers, and there's a mistake in the given percentages.\n\nIn any case, based on the given information, the calculation leads to 3.6 students scoring a distinction, which isn't possible in reality. Therefore, I would conclude that approximately 4 students scored a distinction, rounding to the nearest whole number.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
