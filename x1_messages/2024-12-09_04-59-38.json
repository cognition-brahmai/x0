        "content": "Dear Diary,\n\nSo, another day at school, another chance for me to avoid getting beaten up or humiliated. Let me just say, today was a total wash. I woke up late because my alarm didn't go off, which is strange because I set it extra early so I could avoid the morning chaos. But nope, sleep won that battle.\n\nI rushed out of the house, forgetting my lunch money again. Man, I need to get organized or something. Maybe if I had a system, like putting my stuff in the same place every day. But honestly, who has time for that? Anyway, I had to borrow money from Rodrick, my older brother, who, of course, charged me interest. Typical.\n\nAt school, the first period was math, which is always a blast because Mr. Kubrich loves to make us feel stupid. I swear, that man takes joy in watching us struggle with equations that make no sense. I managed to survive that, thanks to my secret weapon: copying off of Rowley during tests. He's not the brightest bulb, but he's got a heart of gold.\n\nLunchtime was eventful. There's this new kid, Manny, who thinks he's all that because his dad owns a bunch of car washes or something. He's trying to muscle in on our group, but I'm not having it. I mean, I'm already the bottom rung of the social ladder; I don't need some newcomer pushing me further down. So, I tried to ignore him, but he just keeps talking over everyone else.\n\nAfter lunch, it was science with Ms. Ribbons. She's okay, I guess, but her experiments always end up in a mess. Today, we were supposed to make volcanoes erupt using baking soda and vinegar, but of course, mine didn't work. Instead, it just fizzled out like my life ambitions. Great.\n\nThen came the highlight of my day: gym class. I say \"highlight\" because at least I get to wear comfy clothes and not think about schoolwork for a bit. We had basketball, and as usual, I ended up being the last one picked for a team. No surprises there. But this time, I actually managed to score a basket! Accidentally, of course, but still, it was something to brag about to my friends.\n\nOn the way home, I saw Rodrick sneaking out of the house with a bag full of what looked like girly magazines. Gross! I can't believe my own brother is into that stuff. I considered telling Mom and Dad, but then I thought, why give him more ammo? He'd probably turn it around and accuse me of something embarrassing.\n\nAnyway, I have homework to do, which means another evening of stress and last-minute cramming. I really need to find a better way to manage my time, but honestly, when you're as busy as I am trying to navigate through school without dying of embarrassment, it's hard to focus on studying.\n\nWell, that's my day in a nutshell. Tomorrow's another day, I guess. Or as Mom would say, \"Every cloud has a silver lining.\" Yeah, right. My clouds are more like dark, stormy clouds that just keep getting bigger.\n\nStay tuned for more adventures in middle school.\n\nGreg Heffley"
