Because each student is forming a group with 4 others, which makes 5 altogether.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many such groups will be formed. If each group has 5 students, and there are 25 students in total, then the number of groups should be 25 divided by 5, which is 5. So, there should be 5 groups.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is it possible that some students are in more than one group? The problem says each student forms a group with exactly 4 other students, but it doesn't specify whether those groups can overlap or not.\n\nIf the groups are overlapping, meaning some students are in more than one group, then the total number of groups could be more than 5. However, the problem seems to suggest that each student is in exactly one group, because it says \"form a group with exactly 4 other students.\" That sounds like each student is part of only one group.\n\nSo, in that case, the total number of groups should indeed be 25 divided by 5, which is 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the groups are being formed in such a way that each student is in multiple groups. But that seems unlikely based on the problem statement.\n\nLet me consider another approach. If each student is in a group with 4 others, and each group has 5 students, then the total number of group memberships is 25 students times 1 group each, which is 25 group memberships. Since each group has 5 students, the number of groups is 25 group memberships divided by 5 students per group, which again gives 5 groups.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 5 groups.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nSuppose that some students are in multiple groups. For example, student A is in group 1 and group 2, while student B is in group 2 and group 3, and so on. In that case, the total number of group memberships would be greater than 25, because some students belong to more than one group.\n\nHowever, the problem states that each student forms a group with exactly 4 other students. This seems to imply that each student is only in one group, because if they were in multiple groups, they would be forming groups with more than 4 other students.\n\nTherefore, my initial conclusion stands: there are 5 groups.\n\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
