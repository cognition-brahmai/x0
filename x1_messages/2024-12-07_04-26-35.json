        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a company has 6 managers and 24 employees, and they want to form a committee with 2 managers and 5 employees. I need to figure out how many different committees can be formed from these people. Hmm, sounds like a combination problem to me.\n\nFirst off, I know that combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, which makes sense here because the committee is just a group of people, and it doesn't matter who is picked first or last. So, I need to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 managers out of 6 and 5 employees out of 24.\n\nI recall that the formula for combinations is given by:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, for the managers, I have \\( n = 6 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\), and for the employees, \\( n = 24 \\) and \\( k = 5 \\). I need to calculate these two combinations separately and then multiply them together because these are independent choices. That means the way we choose managers doesn't affect how we choose employees, and vice versa.\n\nLet me first calculate the number of ways to choose 2 managers out of 6.\n\n\\[\nC(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(6 - 2)!} = \\frac{6!}{2! \\cdot 4!}\n\\]\n\nI know that \\( 6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720 \\), but I can also write it as \\( 6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4! \\), and since \\( 4! \\) appears in both the numerator and the denominator, they cancel out.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nC(6, 2) = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4!}{2! \\times 4!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2!} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n\\]\n\nOkay, there are 15 different ways to choose 2 managers from 6.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of ways to choose 5 employees out of 24.\n\n\\[\nC(24, 5) = \\frac{24!}{5!(24 - 5)!} = \\frac{24!}{5! \\cdot 19!}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, I can write \\( 24! = 24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20 \\times 19! \\), and the \\( 19! \\) cancels out.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nC(24, 5) = \\frac{24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20}{5!}\n\\]\n\nNow, \\( 5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120 \\). So,\n\n\\[\nC(24, 5) = \\frac{24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20}{120}\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate the numerator step by step:\n\nFirst, \\( 24 \\times 23 = 552 \\),\n\nThen, \\( 552 \\times 22 = 12144 \\),\n\nNext, \\( 12144 \\times 21 = 255024 \\),\n\nAnd finally, \\( 255024 \\times 20 = 5100480 \\).\n\nSo, the numerator is 5,100,480, and dividing by 120:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5100480}{120} = 42504\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 42,504 ways to choose 5 employees from 24.\n\nNow, since these are independent choices, the total number of different committees is the product of these two combinations:\n\n\\[\n15 \\times 42504 = 637560\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 637,560 different committees that can be formed consisting of 2 managers and 5 employees.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n15 times 42,504.\n\nFirst, 10 times 42,504 is 425,040.\n\nThen, 5 times 42,504 is half of that: half of 425,040 is 212,520.\n\nAdding them together: 425,040 + 212,520 = 637,560.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 637,560 different committees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{637560} \\]"
