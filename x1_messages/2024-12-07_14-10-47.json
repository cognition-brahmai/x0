        "content": "Let's see. So there's a train traveling from Station A to Station B at a constant speed, and halfway through its journey, it starts raining heavily, causing the train to reduce its speed by 50%. The total travel time was 3 hours, and I need to find out how long it took for the train to cover the first half of the distance.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem step by step. Let's denote the total distance between Station A and Station B as D. So, the first half of the distance is D/2, and the second half is also D/2.\n\nLet's assume the initial speed of the train is S. So, for the first half of the distance, the train travels at speed S, and for the second half, due to the rain, its speed reduces by 50%, which means its new speed is S/2.\n\nNow, I need to find the time taken for the first half of the distance.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Time taken for the first half: T1\n\n- Time taken for the second half: T2\n\nWe know that total travel time is T1 + T2 = 3 hours.\n\nWe also know that:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, for the first half:\n\nD/2 = S \u00d7 T1  =>  T1 = (D/2)/S = D/(2S)\n\nFor the second half:\n\nD/2 = (S/2) \u00d7 T2  =>  T2 = (D/2)/(S/2) = (D/2) \u00d7 (2/S) = D/S\n\nNow, total time is T1 + T2 = D/(2S) + D/S = 3 hours.\n\nLet's combine the terms:\n\nD/(2S) + D/S = 3\n\nTo combine these, let's find a common denominator, which is 2S:\n\n[D/(2S)] + [2D/(2S)] = 3\n\n=> (D + 2D)/(2S) = 3\n\n=> 3D/(2S) = 3\n\nNow, we can solve for D/S:\n\n3D/(2S) = 3\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nD/(2S) = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nD/S = 2\n\nSo, D/S = 2.\n\nNow, recall that T1 = D/(2S)\n\nBut we know D/S = 2, so T1 = 2 / 2 = 1 hour.\n\nWait, is that right? Let's double-check.\n\nGiven D/S = 2,\n\nThen T1 = D/(2S) = (D/S)/2 = 2/2 = 1 hour.\n\nSimilarly, T2 = D/S = 2 hours.\n\nSo, total time T1 + T2 = 1 + 2 = 3 hours, which matches the given total travel time.\n\nTherefore, the time taken to cover the first half of the distance is 1 hour.\n\nBut let me think again to make sure there are no mistakes.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the speeds and times directly.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Speed of the train initially: S\n\n- Speed after raining: S/2\n\n- Total distance: D\n\n- Time for first half: T1 = (D/2)/S = D/(2S)\n\n- Time for second half: T2 = (D/2)/(S/2) = (D/2)*(2/S) = D/S\n\n- Total time: T1 + T2 = D/(2S) + D/S = (D + 2D)/(2S) = 3D/(2S) = 3 hours\n\nFrom this, 3D/(2S) = 3 hours\n\nSimplify: D/S = 2 hours\n\nTherefore, T1 = D/(2S) = (D/S)/2 = 2/2 = 1 hour\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, think in terms of time ratios.\n\nSince the speed in the second half is half of the first half, the time taken for the second half will be twice that of the first half, because time is inversely proportional to speed for a given distance.\n\nSo, if T1 is the time for the first half, then T2 = 2*T1\n\nTotal time: T1 + T2 = T1 + 2*T1 = 3*T1 = 3 hours\n\nTherefore, T1 = 1 hour\n\nThis is a simpler way to see it.\n\nSo, the time taken to cover the first half of the distance is 1 hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 \\text{ hour}} \\]"
