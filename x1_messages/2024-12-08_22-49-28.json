        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a town with houses on both sides of the street: 10 houses on one side and 12 on the other, making a total of 22 houses. Each house has either a red or blue door. The condition is that there are more red doors than blue doors on both sides of the street. We need to find the minimum number of red doors required to satisfy this condition.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for there to be more red doors than blue doors on both sides. That means, on the side with 10 houses, the number of red doors must be greater than the number of blue doors. Similarly, on the side with 12 houses, the number of red doors must be greater than the number of blue doors.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- For the side with 10 houses:\n\n  - Let \\( r_1 \\) be the number of red doors.\n\n  - Let \\( b_1 \\) be the number of blue doors.\n\n  - So, \\( r_1 + b_1 = 10 \\).\n\n  - And, \\( r_1 > b_1 \\).\n\n- For the side with 12 houses:\n\n  - Let \\( r_2 \\) be the number of red doors.\n\n  - Let \\( b_2 \\) be the number of blue doors.\n\n  - So, \\( r_2 + b_2 = 12 \\).\n\n  - And, \\( r_2 > b_2 \\).\n\nOur goal is to minimize the total number of red doors, which is \\( r_1 + r_2 \\).\n\nTo minimize \\( r_1 + r_2 \\), we need to minimize each of \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\) individually, given their respective constraints.\n\nLet's start with the side that has 10 houses.\n\n### Minimizing \\( r_1 \\) for 10 houses:\n\nWe have \\( r_1 + b_1 = 10 \\) and \\( r_1 > b_1 \\).\n\nSince \\( r_1 > b_1 \\), and \\( b_1 = 10 - r_1 \\), we can write:\n\n\\( r_1 > 10 - r_1 \\)\n\n\\( 2r_1 > 10 \\)\n\n\\( r_1 > 5 \\)\n\nSince \\( r_1 \\) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \\( r_1 \\) is 6.\n\nSimilarly, for the side with 12 houses:\n\n### Minimizing \\( r_2 \\) for 12 houses:\n\nWe have \\( r_2 + b_2 = 12 \\) and \\( r_2 > b_2 \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( r_2 > 12 - r_2 \\)\n\n\\( 2r_2 > 12 \\)\n\n\\( r_2 > 6 \\)\n\nSo, the smallest integer value for \\( r_2 \\) is 7.\n\nTherefore, the minimum total number of red doors is \\( r_1 + r_2 = 6 + 7 = 13 \\).\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check if this is indeed the minimum.\n\nIs there a way to have fewer than 13 red doors while still satisfying the condition that there are more red doors than blue doors on both sides?\n\nLet's consider if we could have \\( r_1 = 6 \\) and \\( r_2 = 6 \\), making \\( r_1 + r_2 = 12 \\).\n\nBut according to our earlier calculation, for the side with 12 houses, \\( r_2 > 6 \\), which means \\( r_2 \\) must be at least 7. So, \\( r_2 = 6 \\) would not satisfy the condition on the side with 12 houses.\n\nTherefore, 13 is indeed the minimum total number of red doors.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider if there's a different distribution that could yield a lower total.\n\nSuppose we try to minimize \\( r_1 \\) further by setting \\( r_1 = 6 \\), which is the minimum for that side, and then see what \\( r_2 \\) would need to be.\n\nGiven \\( r_1 = 6 \\), for the side with 10 houses, \\( b_1 = 4 \\), satisfying \\( r_1 > b_1 \\).\n\nFor the side with 12 houses, to have \\( r_2 > b_2 \\), with \\( r_2 + b_2 = 12 \\), the smallest \\( r_2 \\) can be is 7, as previously determined.\n\nThus, total red doors = 6 + 7 = 13.\n\nIs there any way to have \\( r_2 = 7 \\) and \\( r_1 = 6 \\), which sums to 13, and confirm that this is the minimum.\n\nAlternatively, if we try to reduce \\( r_2 \\) to 7 and see if \\( r_1 \\) can be reduced below 6, but since \\( r_1 \\) cannot be less than 6 for the side with 10 houses, it's not possible.\n\nTherefore, the minimum total number of red doors is indeed 13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
