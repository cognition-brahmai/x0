The waitress, JESSICA, is new to the job, looking slightly overwhelmed but determined. She approaches a table occupied by MR. HARRIS, a regular customer with a reputation for being difficult.)\n\nJESSICA: (Approaching the table with a nervous smile) Good evening, Mr. Harris. I'm Jessica, your server for tonight. Can I start you off with something to drink?\n\nMR. HARRIS: (Looking up from his newspaper, eyes narrowing) Oh, it's you. New girl, huh? Well, let's see what you're made of. I'll have my usual\u2014 a dry martini, shaken, not stirred, with a twist of lemon. And make it snappy.\n\nJESSICA: (Nods, trying to hide her anxiety) Alright, a dry martini, shaken, not stirred, with a lemon twist. I'll get that right out for you.\n\n(Moves away to the bar to place the order, trying to remember the specifics.)\n\n(Bartender, TOM, notices her hesitation.)\n\nTOM: Need a hand there, Jessica? First day can be tough.\n\nJESSICA: Yeah, thanks, Tom. Mr. Harris wants a dry martini, shaken, not stirred, with a lemon twist.\n\nTOM: Got it. Don't worry about him; he's all talk. Just make sure you get his drink right, and the rest will fall into place.\n\nJESSICA: Okay, thanks. (Takes the drink back to Mr. Harris)\n\nJESSICA: Here's your martini, Mr. Harris. I hope it meets your standards.\n\nMR. HARRIS: (Tasting it) Hmm, not bad. You remember my preferences. Maybe you're not completely incompetent.\n\nJESSICA: (Trying to keep her composure) Thank you. I'll be back to take your dinner order in a bit.\n\n(Moves to another table to take orders, coming back to Mr. Harris.)\n\nJESSICA: Ready to order, Mr. Harris?\n\nMR. HARRIS: Actually, yes. I'll have the steak, rare, with a side of baked potatoes and steamed broccoli.\n\nJESSICA: Steak, rare, with baked potatoes and steamed broccoli. Anything else?\n\nMR. HARRIS: Oh, and make sure the steak is perfectly cooked. I don't like my meat overdone.\n\nJESSICA: No problem, I'll make sure the kitchen knows it's rare.\n\n(Makes a note and heads back to the kitchen to place the order.)\n\n(Kitchen is chaotic, with chefs shouting orders.)\n\nJESSICA: (To the chef) Steak for Mr. Harris, rare, baked potatoes, and steamed broccoli.\n\nCHEF: Got it, Jessica. We'll take care of it.\n\n(Jessica returns to Mr. Harris's table.)\n\nJESSICA: Your order has been placed, Mr. Harris. It should be out shortly.\n\nMR. HARRIS: Good. And make sure everything is up to my standards.\n\nJESSICA: Of course, sir.\n\n(As Jessica is attending to other tables, Mr. Harris calls her back.)\n\nMR. HARRIS: Hey, Jessica, I need some more water.\n\nJESSICA: (Hurrying over) Oh, sorry, I must have forgotten. Let me get that for you right now.\n\n(Brings water and checks on him periodically.)\n\n(Finally, the food is ready.)\n\nJESSICA: (Bringing the plate) Here's your steak, Mr. Harris. I hope you enjoy it.\n\nMR. HARRIS: (Cutting into the steak) Perfectly rare. You did well this time.\n\nJESSICA: I'm glad you like it. Is there anything else I can get for you?\n\nMR. HARRIS: No, for now, that's all.\n\n(Jessica moves to other tables, but Mr. Harris calls her back again.)\n\nMR. HARRIS: Jessica, my broccoli seems a bit overcooked.\n\nJESSICA: I'm sorry to hear that, sir. Let me get you a fresh side right away.\n\n(Makes a note and brings back new broccoli.)\n\nMR. HARRIS: That's better. Now, that's what I'm talking about.\n\nJESSICA: I'm glad you're satisfied, Mr. Harris.\n\n(Later, as the dinner rush starts to die down.)\n\nJESSICA: (Approaching Mr. Harris again) Is there anything else I can get for you before I close your check?\n\nMR. HARRIS: Actually, yes. I need my check, please.\n\nJESSICA: Right away, sir.\n\n(Brings the check.)\n\nMR. HARRIS: (Looking it over) This looks correct. (Pauses) You know, for a new girl, you did okay tonight.\n\nJESSICA: Thank you, sir. I appreciate the compliment.\n\nMR. HARRIS: Just remember, in this business, it's all about attention to detail and remembering the regulars' preferences.\n\nJESSICA: I will, thank you for the advice.\n\n(Mr. Harris leaves, and Jessica lets out a sigh of relief.)\n\nJESSICA: (To herself) That wasn't so bad.\n\n(Tom approaches her.)\n\nTOM: How'd it go with Mr. Harris?\n\nJESSICA: Surprisingly well, I think. He was tough, but I managed.\n\nTOM: See, I told you, he's all talk. You did great for your first day.\n\nJESSICA: Thanks, Tom. I couldn't have done it without your help.\n\nTOM: Anytime, kid. Welcome to the team.\n\n(They share a smile as the restaurant continues to buzz around them.)\n\n(End of Scene)"
