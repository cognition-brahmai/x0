        "content": "Let's see. I have a box of 50 chocolates, and I eat 2 pieces a day. My friend gives me 10 more pieces after I've eaten half of my original box. I need to find out how many days it will take to finish all the chocolates.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many pieces I eat before my friend gives me more. The original box has 50 pieces, and I eat 2 pieces a day. So, half of the original box is 25 pieces.\n\nTo find out how many days it takes to eat 25 pieces:\n\nDays to eat half = 25 pieces / 2 pieces per day = 12.5 days\n\nBut since I can't eat half a piece on a given day, I might need to adjust this, but for now, I'll keep it as 12.5 days.\n\nAfter eating 25 pieces, my friend gives me 10 more pieces. So, the total number of pieces I have now is:\n\nRemaining original pieces + additional pieces = (50 - 25) + 10 = 25 + 10 = 35 pieces\n\nNow, I continue eating 2 pieces a day from the remaining 35 pieces.\n\nDays to eat remaining = 35 pieces / 2 pieces per day = 17.5 days\n\nAgain, I have half a day, but for the sake of calculation, I'll keep it as 17.5 days.\n\nNow, the total days to finish all the chocolates would be the days to eat half the original box plus the days to eat the remaining after receiving additional pieces.\n\nTotal days = 12.5 days + 17.5 days = 30 days\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Maybe there's a better way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nTotal chocolates = original 50 pieces + 10 additional pieces = 60 pieces\n\nBut, the additional 10 pieces are given after I've eaten half of the original box, which is after 25 pieces.\n\nSo, actually, I have to consider the additional pieces are added after I've already eaten 25 pieces.\n\nSo, total chocolates to be eaten = original 50 - 25 (already eaten) + 10 (added) = 35 pieces\n\nDays to eat the remaining 35 pieces = 35 / 2 = 17.5 days\n\nBut, I also need to add the days I took to eat the first 25 pieces.\n\nDays to eat first 25 pieces = 25 / 2 = 12.5 days\n\nTotal days = 12.5 + 17.5 = 30 days\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\n\nTotal chocolates = original 50 + 10 = 60 pieces\n\nBut, the 10 pieces are added after I've eaten 25 pieces.\n\nSo, effectively, I have 60 - 25 = 35 pieces to eat after the first 12.5 days.\n\nBut, that's the same as above.\n\nWait, perhaps I can set up an equation.\n\nLet D be the total days to finish all chocolates.\n\nIn D days, I eat 2D pieces.\n\nBut, after eating 25 pieces, I get 10 more.\n\nSo, the total chocolates eaten are 2D pieces, which should equal the total chocolates available.\n\nTotal chocolates available = 50 + 10 = 60 pieces\n\nSo, 2D = 60\n\nD = 30 days\n\nBut, this doesn't account for the timing of when the 10 pieces are added.\n\nWait, perhaps this is too simplistic.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nAfter 12.5 days, I've eaten 25 pieces, and I get 10 more pieces.\n\nSo, at that point, I have 25 (remaining original) + 10 = 35 pieces left.\n\nThen, it takes me 35 / 2 = 17.5 days to eat those.\n\nTotal days = 12.5 + 17.5 = 30 days\n\nYes, this seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the rate of consumption.\n\nI eat 2 pieces per day.\n\nMy friend adds 10 pieces after I've eaten half the original box, which is after 12.5 days.\n\nSo, the additional 10 pieces extend the number of days I can continue eating.\n\nWithout the additional pieces, I would have 25 pieces left after 12.5 days, which would last me another 12.5 days.\n\nBut with the additional 10 pieces, I have 25 + 10 = 35 pieces left, which at 2 pieces per day is 17.5 days.\n\nSo, total days are 12.5 + 17.5 = 30 days.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the additional pieces as extending the number of days by 10 / 2 = 5 days.\n\nSo, without the additional pieces, it would be 25 pieces left after 12.5 days, which would take another 12.5 days to eat, totaling 25 days.\n\nBut with the additional 10 pieces, I have extra days.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try to approach it step by step.\n\nStep 1: Eat half the original box.\n\nHalf of 50 is 25 pieces.\n\nAt 2 pieces per day, this takes 25 / 2 = 12.5 days.\n\nStep 2: Friend gives me 10 more pieces.\n\nNow, I have the remaining 25 pieces from the original box plus 10 additional pieces, totaling 35 pieces.\n\nStep 3: Eat the remaining 35 pieces at 2 pieces per day.\n\nThis takes 35 / 2 = 17.5 days.\n\nStep 4: Total days is the sum of Step 1 and Step 3.\n\nTotal days = 12.5 + 17.5 = 30 days.\n\nThis seems straightforward and consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the total chocolates consumed being equal to the original chocolates plus the additional chocolates given.\n\nTotal chocolates consumed = original 50 + 10 = 60 pieces.\n\nEating rate = 2 pieces per day.\n\nTherefore, total days = 60 / 2 = 30 days.\n\nThis matches the previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 30 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
