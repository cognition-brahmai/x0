        "content": "Alright, I'm going to create a simple ATM simulation in C#. I need to make sure that users can check their balance, deposit money, withdraw money, and exit the program. Also, there are some important criteria to implement:\n\n1. Users must enter a valid PIN before accessing their account.\n\n2. Withdrawal amounts must not exceed the available balance.\n\n3. There should be a daily withdrawal limit enforced.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to structure this program. Since it's a simple simulation, I'll keep it console-based. I'll need to handle user input and validate it properly to ensure that the operations are performed correctly.\n\nLet me start by planning the steps:\n\n1. **User Authentication:**\n\n- Prompt the user to enter their PIN.\n\n- Validate the PIN. For simplicity, I'll hardcode a PIN, say \"1234\".\n\n- If the PIN is incorrect, prompt again or limit the number of attempts.\n\n2. **Main Menu:**\n\n- Once authenticated, display a menu with options: Check Balance, Deposit, Withdraw, Exit.\n\n- Use a loop to keep displaying the menu until the user chooses to exit.\n\n3. **Check Balance:**\n\n- Display the current balance.\n\n4. **Deposit:**\n\n- Prompt the user to enter the amount to deposit.\n\n- Add the amount to the balance.\n\n5. **Withdraw:**\n\n- Prompt the user to enter the amount to withdraw.\n\n- Check if the amount is less than or equal to the balance.\n\n- Also, check against the daily withdrawal limit.\n\n- If both checks pass, deduct the amount from the balance.\n\n6. **Exit:**\n\n- Confirm if the user wants to exit.\n\n- If yes, end the program.\n\nI also need to consider the daily withdrawal limit. Let's assume a daily limit of $500 for this simulation.\n\nI should keep track of the total withdrawals in a day to enforce this limit.\n\nLet me think about the variables I'll need:\n\n- `balance`: to store the current account balance.\n\n- `pin`: the hardcoded PIN for authentication.\n\n- `dailyWithdrawalLimit`: the maximum amount that can be withdrawn in a day.\n\n- `totalWithdrawnToday`: to keep track of the total amount withdrawn in the current session (assuming one session per day).\n\nI'll initialize `balance` with some value, say $1000, for testing purposes.\n\nNow, for the PIN validation, I should allow a limited number of attempts, say 3, before locking the account.\n\nI need to handle invalid inputs, like non-numeric inputs for amounts.\n\nLet me sketch a rough structure of the program:\n\n- Define constants for PIN and daily withdrawal limit.\n\n- Initialize balance and totalWithdrawnToday.\n\n- Prompt for PIN with a loop for 3 attempts.\n\n- If PIN is correct, proceed to the main menu loop.\n\n- In the main menu, based on user choice, perform the corresponding operation.\n\n- For withdrawal, check balance and daily limit before allowing the withdrawal.\n\n- Update the balance and totalWithdrawnToday accordingly.\n\n- Allow the user to exit the program.\n\nI should also format the currency amounts properly, maybe using two decimal places.\n\nLet me consider how to handle the menu selection. I can display the menu and read the user's choice as a character (e.g., '1' for Check Balance, '2' for Deposit, etc.).\n\nI'll use a switch statement to handle the choices.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the program handles incorrect choices gracefully, perhaps by displaying an error message and redisplaying the menu.\n\nFor the withdrawal limit, I need to ensure that `totalWithdrawnToday` does not exceed `dailyWithdrawalLimit`.\n\nIf the user tries to withdraw an amount that would exceed the limit, I should display a message and cancel the transaction.\n\nSimilarly, if the withdrawal amount exceeds the balance, I should display an insufficient funds message.\n\nFor the deposit and withdrawal amounts, I should accept only positive numbers.\n\nI should also consider that the user might enter zero or negative amounts and handle those cases appropriately.\n\nLet me think about the flow of the program:\n\n1. Start\n\n2. Display welcome message\n\n3. Prompt for PIN\n\n4. Validate PIN\n\n- If correct, proceed to main menu\n\n- If incorrect, allow up to 3 attempts, then lock the account and exit\n\n5. Main menu\n\n- Display options: Check Balance, Deposit, Withdraw, Exit\n\n- Read user choice\n\n- Based on choice, perform the corresponding operation\n\n6. Check Balance\n\n- Display current balance\n\n- Return to main menu\n\n7. Deposit\n\n- Prompt for deposit amount\n\n- Validate amount (positive number)\n\n- Add to balance\n\n- Display updated balance\n\n- Return to main menu\n\n8. Withdraw\n\n- Prompt for withdrawal amount\n\n- Validate amount (positive number)\n\n- Check if amount <= balance\n\n- Check if totalWithdrawnToday + amount <= dailyWithdrawalLimit\n\n- If both checks pass, deduct amount from balance and add to totalWithdrawnToday\n\n- Display updated balance\n\n- Else, display appropriate error message\n\n- Return to main menu\n\n9. Exit\n\n- Prompt to confirm exit\n\n- If yes, end the program\n\n- Else, return to main menu\n\n10. End\n\nI should also consider how to handle floating points for currency. In C#, using decimal is preferable for financial calculations to avoid precision issues.\n\nSo, I'll declare `balance` and amounts as decimal types.\n\nI need to handle input exceptions, like when the user enters non-numeric values for amounts.\n\nTo do this, I'll use try-catch blocks when reading decimal inputs.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nI can write a method for PIN validation, another for the main menu, and separate methods for each operation: check balance, deposit, withdraw.\n\nThis will make the code cleaner and more organized.\n\nAlso, I can create a method to read decimal inputs and handle exceptions.\n\nLet me outline the methods:\n\n- `bool ValidatePin()`: attempts to validate the PIN within 3 tries.\n\n- `void MainMenu()`: displays the main menu and handles user choices.\n\n- `void CheckBalance(decimal balance)`: displays the current balance.\n\n- `void Deposit(ref decimal balance)`: handles depositing money.\n\n- `void Withdraw(ref decimal balance, ref decimal totalWithdrawnToday)`: handles withdrawing money.\n\n- `decimal ReadDecimal(string prompt)`: reads a decimal input with error handling.\n\nI'll use ref keywords for balance and totalWithdrawnToday in Deposit and Withdraw methods since they modify these values.\n\nNow, let's think about the variables:\n\n- `const string VALID_PIN = \"1234\";`\n\n- `const decimal DAILY_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT = 500.00m;`\n\n- `decimal balance = 1000.00m;`\n\n- `decimal totalWithdrawnToday = 0.00m;`\n\nI'll use `m` suffix for decimal literals to specify that they are decimals.\n\nFor the PIN validation, I'll use a for loop that runs up to 3 times.\n\nIf the PIN is correct, proceed; else, after 3 attempts, display a lock message and exit.\n\nIn the main menu, I'll use a do-while loop to repeatedly display the menu until the user chooses to exit.\n\nLet me draft the menu options:\n\n1. Check Balance\n\n2. Deposit\n\n3. Withdraw\n\n4. Exit\n\nI'll prompt the user to enter the corresponding number.\n\nIn the Withdraw method, I need to check both the balance and the daily withdrawal limit.\n\nI'll display messages accordingly:\n\n- \"Insufficient funds.\"\n\n- \"Daily withdrawal limit exceeded.\"\n\n- \"Withdrawal successful.\"\n\nSimilarly, in the Deposit method, I'll confirm the deposit with a message like \"Deposit successful. New balance: $X.XX.\"\n\nI should also format the output to two decimal places.\n\nIn C#, I can use the \"F2\" format specifier for decimals.\n\nFor example, `balance.ToString(\"F2\")`.\n\nNow, let's consider how to handle the withdrawal limit.\n\nI'll keep track of `totalWithdrawnToday`, and each time a withdrawal is made, I'll add the withdrawal amount to it.\n\nI need to ensure that `totalWithdrawnToday` does not exceed `DAILY_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT`.\n\nIf the user tries to withdraw an amount that would exceed the limit, I'll prevent the transaction and inform the user.\n\nWhen the user exits and restarts the program, `totalWithdrawnToday` should reset, assuming each session is for one day.\n\nIn a real ATM, the daily limit would be tracked across multiple sessions, but for this simulation, it's acceptable to reset it each time.\n\nNow, let's think about the user interface.\n\nI need to display messages clearly and prompt the user for inputs appropriately.\n\nI should ensure that the program is user-friendly and handles errors gracefully.\n\nFor example, if the user enters a non-numeric value for amount, I should display an error message and prompt again.\n\nLet me consider writing a separate method to read decimal inputs with validation.\n\nSomething like:\n\ndecimal ReadDecimal(string prompt)\n\n{\n\nwhile (true)\n\n{\n\nConsole.Write(prompt);\n\nif (decimal.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out decimal amount))\n\n{\n\nreturn amount;\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThis method will keep prompting until a valid decimal is entered.\n\nSimilarly, for reading the menu choice, I can use:\n\nchar ReadMenuChoice()\n\n{\n\nConsole.Write(\"Enter your choice: \");\n\nreturn Console.ReadLine()[0];\n\n}\n\nAssuming the user enters a single character.\n\nI need to handle cases where the user enters more or less than one character, but for simplicity, I'll assume they enter one character.\n\nIn the main menu, I'll use a switch statement based on the user's choice.\n\nIf the choice is not between 1 and 4, display an error message and repeat the menu.\n\nFor the Exit option, I'll prompt for confirmation.\n\nSomething like:\n\nAre you sure you want to exit? (Y/N)\n\nIf Y, exit the program.\n\nElse, return to the main menu.\n\nI need to implement this confirmation to prevent accidental exits.\n\nNow, let's think about the scope of variables.\n\nI'll declare `balance` and `totalWithdrawnToday` in the Main method and pass them to other methods as needed.\n\nSince C# is pass-by-value, I'll use ref keywords to modify `balance` and `totalWithdrawnToday` in the Deposit and Withdraw methods.\n\nIn the CheckBalance method, since I'm not modifying the balance, I'll pass it by value.\n\nI should ensure that the balance and totalWithdrawnToday are not modified unexpectedly.\n\nNow, let's consider implementing the ValidatePin method.\n\nI'll use a for loop that runs up to 3 times.\n\nPrompt the user to enter the PIN each time.\n\nIf the entered PIN matches the valid PIN, return true.\n\nIf all 3 attempts fail, return false.\n\nI'll display a message like \"Incorrect PIN. Please try again.\" for each failed attempt.\n\nAfter 3 attempts, display \"Account locked. Please contact your bank.\" and exit the program.\n\nI'll use Environment.Exit(0) to terminate the program.\n\nNow, let's think about the main loop in the Main method.\n\nIf the PIN is validated successfully, enter the main menu loop.\n\nDisplay the menu and read the user's choice.\n\nBased on the choice, call the corresponding method.\n\nContinue this loop until the user chooses to exit.\n\nI'll use a do-while loop for this, with a boolean flag to control the loop.\n\nFor example:\n\nbool running = true;\n\ndo\n\n{\n\nDisplayMainMenu();\n\nchar choice = ReadMenuChoice();\n\nswitch (choice)\n\n{\n\ncase '1':\n\nCheckBalance(balance);\n\nbreak;\n\ncase '2':\n\nDeposit(ref balance);\n\nbreak;\n\ncase '3':\n\nWithdraw(ref balance, ref totalWithdrawnToday);\n\nbreak;\n\ncase '4':\n\nif (ConfirmExit())\n\n{\n\nrunning = false;\n\n}\n\nbreak;\n\ndefault:\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\");\n\n}\n\n} while (running);\n\nI'll write a ConfirmExit method that prompts the user for confirmation.\n\nSomething like:\n\nbool ConfirmExit()\n\n{\n\nConsole.Write(\"Are you sure you want to exit? (Y/N): \");\n\nstring response = Console.ReadLine().ToUpper();\n\nreturn response == \"Y\";\n\n}\n\nThis will handle the exit confirmation.\n\nNow, let's think about the Withdraw method in more detail.\n\nI need to:\n\n1. Prompt the user to enter the withdrawal amount.\n\n2. Read the amount using ReadDecimal method.\n\n3. Check if the amount is positive.\n\n4. Check if the amount is less than or equal to the balance.\n\n5. Check if the totalWithdrawnToday + amount is less than or equal to DAILY_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT.\n\n6. If all checks pass, deduct the amount from balance and add it to totalWithdrawnToday.\n\n7. Display a success message with the new balance.\n\n8. If any check fails, display an appropriate error message.\n\nI should ensure that the withdrawal amount is a positive number.\n\nSimilarly, in the Deposit method:\n\n1. Prompt the user to enter the deposit amount.\n\n2. Read the amount using ReadDecimal method.\n\n3. Check if the amount is positive.\n\n4. Add the amount to the balance.\n\n5. Display a success message with the new balance.\n\nI need to handle cases where the user enters zero or negative amounts.\n\nFor example, in withdrawal, if the amount is zero or negative, display \"Invalid amount. Please enter a positive number.\"\n\nSame for deposit.\n\nI should make sure that the program doesn't allow zero or negative deposits or withdrawals.\n\nNow, let's consider implementing the ReadDecimal method.\n\nI'll write it to keep prompting until a valid positive decimal is entered.\n\nSomething like:\n\ndecimal ReadDecimal(string prompt)\n\n{\n\ndecimal amount;\n\nwhile (true)\n\n{\n\nConsole.Write(prompt);\n\nif (decimal.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out amount) && amount > 0)\n\n{\n\nreturn amount;\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid input. Please enter a positive number.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThis ensures that only positive decimals are accepted.\n\nSimilarly, for the PIN validation, I'll use string comparison for the PIN.\n\nNow, let's think about the initial balance.\n\nI'll hardcode it for this simulation, say $1000.00.\n\nI'll declare it as a constant or initialize it in the Main method.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that the balance never goes negative, which should be handled by the withdrawal check.\n\nNow, let's consider writing the code step by step.\n\nFirst, define the constants and variables:\n\nconst string VALID_PIN = \"1234\";\n\nconst decimal DAILY_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT = 500.00m;\n\ndecimal balance = 1000.00m;\n\ndecimal totalWithdrawnToday = 0.00m;\n\nThen, write the ValidatePin method:\n\nbool ValidatePin()\n\n{\n\nfor (int attempt = 0; attempt < 3; attempt++)\n\n{\n\nConsole.Write(\"Enter your PIN: \");\n\nstring pin = Console.ReadLine();\n\nif (pin == VALID_PIN)\n\n{\n\nreturn true;\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Incorrect PIN. Please try again.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Account locked. Please contact your bank.\");\n\nreturn false;\n\n}\n\nNext, write the ReadDecimal method:\n\ndecimal ReadDecimal(string prompt)\n\n{\n\ndecimal amount;\n\nwhile (true)\n\n{\n\nConsole.Write(prompt);\n\nif (decimal.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out amount) && amount > 0)\n\n{\n\nreturn amount;\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid input. Please enter a positive number.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThen, write the ConfirmExit method:\n\nbool ConfirmExit()\n\n{\n\nConsole.Write(\"Are you sure you want to exit? (Y/N): \");\n\nstring response = Console.ReadLine().ToUpper();\n\nreturn response == \"Y\";\n\n}\n\nNow, the CheckBalance method:\n\nvoid CheckBalance(decimal balance)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Your current balance is: ${balance:F2}\");\n\n}\n\nThe Deposit method:\n\nvoid Deposit(ref decimal balance)\n\n{\n\ndecimal amount = ReadDecimal(\"Enter the deposit amount: \");\n\nbalance += amount;\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Deposit successful. New balance: ${balance:F2}\");\n\n}\n\nThe Withdraw method:\n\nvoid Withdraw(ref decimal balance, ref decimal totalWithdrawnToday)\n\n{\n\ndecimal amount = ReadDecimal(\"Enter the withdrawal amount: \");\n\nif (amount > balance)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Insufficient funds.\");\n\n}\n\nelse if (totalWithdrawnToday + amount > DAILY_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Daily withdrawal limit exceeded.\");\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nbalance -= amount;\n\ntotalWithdrawnToday += amount;\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Withdrawal successful. New balance: ${balance:F2}\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\nAnd finally, the MainMenu method:\n\nvoid MainMenu()\n\n{\n\nConsole.Clear();\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"ATM Simulation\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"1. Check Balance\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"2. Deposit\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"3. Withdraw\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"4. Exit\");\n\n}\n\nNow, in the Main method, I'll put it all together:\n\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n\n{\n\nconst string VALID_PIN = \"1234\";\n\nconst decimal DAILY_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT = 500.00m;\n\ndecimal balance = 1000.00m;\n\ndecimal totalWithdrawnToday = 0.00m;\n\nif (!ValidatePin())\n\n{\n\nreturn;\n\n}\n\nbool running = true;\n\ndo\n\n{\n\nMainMenu();\n\nchar choice = ReadMenuChoice();\n\nswitch (choice)\n\n{\n\ncase '1':\n\nCheckBalance(balance);\n\nbreak;\n\ncase '2':\n\nDeposit(ref balance);\n\nbreak;\n\ncase '3':\n\nWithdraw(ref balance, ref totalWithdrawnToday);\n\nbreak;\n\ncase '4':\n\nif (ConfirmExit())\n\n{\n\nrunning = false;\n\n}\n\nbreak;\n\ndefault:\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\");\n\n}\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Press any key to continue...\");\n\nConsole.ReadKey();\n\n} while (running);\n\n}\n\nThis should cover all the required functionalities.\n\nI need to make sure to handle all possible edge cases, like entering zero or negative amounts, exceeding limits, and invalid inputs.\n\nAlso, I should ensure that the program is user-friendly and provides clear instructions and feedback at each step.\n\nI might want to add some pauses after critical operations, like withdrawals and deposits, to give the user time to see the results before the screen clears or the menu redisplayed.\n\nI can achieve this by asking the user to press any key to continue, as I've already included in the Main method.\n\nAdditionally, I can improve the user interface by clearing the console screen at appropriate times, using Console.Clear(), to avoid clutter.\n\nI've already included Console.Clear() in the MainMenu method.\n\nNow, let's think about testing the program.\n\nI need to test various scenarios:\n\n1. Correct PIN entry on the first attempt.\n\n2. Incorrect PIN entries with locking the account after 3 attempts.\n\n3. Checking balance.\n\n4. Depositing money with valid and invalid amounts.\n\n5. Withdrawing money with amounts within balance and limits.\n\n6. Attempting to withdraw amounts exceeding balance.\n\n7. Attempting to withdraw amounts exceeding daily limit.\n\n8. Reaching the daily withdrawal limit and attempting to withdraw more.\n\n9. Exiting the program without any operations.\n\n10. Exiting the program after multiple operations.\n\nI should manually test each of these scenarios to ensure the program behaves as expected.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, like entering the minimum positive decimal value or the maximum allowed by the decimal type.\n\nHowever, for this simple simulation, sticking to basic tests should suffice.\n\nNow, I'll proceed to write the actual code based on the planned structure.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple ATM simulation in C#, we need to allow users to check their balance, deposit money, withdraw money, and exit the program. We must ensure that users enter a valid PIN, cannot withdraw more than their balance, and are subject to a daily withdrawal limit.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **User Authentication:**\n   - Prompt the user to enter their PIN.\n   - Validate the PIN with a hardcoded value.\n   - Limit the number of attempts to prevent misuse.\n\n2. **Main Menu:**\n   - Display options to Check Balance, Deposit, Withdraw, or Exit.\n   - Use a loop to keep displaying the menu until the user chooses to exit.\n\n3. **Transactions:**\n   - **Check Balance:** Display the current balance.\n   - **Deposit:** Add money to the balance.\n   - **Withdraw:** Deduct money from the balance if sufficient funds and within daily limits.\n\n4. **Validation:**\n   - Ensure withdrawal amounts do not exceed the balance or daily limit.\n   - Validate user inputs to handle invalid data entries.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        const string VALID_PIN = \"1234\";\n        const decimal DAILY_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT = 500.00m;\n        decimal balance = 1000.00m;\n        decimal totalWithdrawnToday = 0.00m;\n\n        if (!ValidatePin())\n        {\n            return;\n        }\n\n        bool running = true;\n        do\n        {\n            MainMenu();\n            char choice = ReadMenuChoice();\n            switch (choice)\n            {\n                case '1':\n                    CheckBalance(balance);\n                    break;\n                case '2':\n                    Deposit(ref balance);\n                    break;\n                case '3':\n                    Withdraw(ref balance, ref totalWithdrawnToday, DAILY_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT);\n                    break;\n                case '4':\n                    if (ConfirmExit())\n                    {\n                        running = false;\n                    }\n                    break;\n                default:\n                    Console.WriteLine(\"Invalid choice.

If unsuccessful, the account is locked.\n\n2. **Main Menu:**\n   - The `MainMenu` method displays options and reads user choices using `ReadMenuChoice`.\n\n3. **Transactions:**\n   - **Check Balance:** Displays the current balance.\n   - **Deposit:** Adds the deposited amount to the balance.\n   - **Withdraw:** Deducts the withdrawal amount from the balance if sufficient funds and within the daily limit.\n\n4. **Input Validation:**\n   - The `ReadDecimal` method ensures that only positive decimal numbers are accepted for amounts.\n\n5. **Exit Confirmation:**\n   - The `ConfirmExit` method prompts the user for confirmation before exiting the program.\n\nThis approach ensures a simple and secure ATM simulation with basic functionalities and validations."
