        "content": "So I've got this question about quicksort and its time complexity in the worst-case scenario. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst off, quicksort is a sorting algorithm that uses the divide and conquer approach. It works by choosing a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, based on whether they're less than or greater than the pivot. Then, it recursively sorts these sub-arrays.\n\nNow, time complexity is a measure of how the running time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input data. In big O notation, we describe the upper bound of this running time.\n\nQuicksort is generally efficient, but its performance can vary depending on how the pivot is chosen and the nature of the input data.\n\nSo, let's think about the worst-case scenario for quicksort.\n\nIn the worst case, the pivot selection is poor, leading to extremely unbalanced partitions. For example, if the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot, one sub-array will be empty, and the other will contain n-1 elements. This degenerates quicksort into something similar to selection sort, where you're making n comparisons for each element.\n\nIn such a case, the time complexity becomes O(n^2), because for each element, you're potentially comparing it to all other elements.\n\nBut, I remember that with good pivot selection strategies, like choosing the median as the pivot, the time complexity can be much better, closer to O(n log n).\n\nSo, considering the worst-case scenario, without any optimizations, quicksort can degrade to O(n^2) time complexity.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. O(n) - This would be linear time, which is very efficient, but quicksort doesn't typically have a linear time complexity in the worst case.\n\nB. O(n log n) - This is the average-case time complexity for quicksort, which is quite good.\n\nC. O(n^2) - This seems to match the worst-case scenario I was thinking about.\n\nD. O(log n) - This is logarithmic time, which is even better than linear, but not realistic for a sorting algorithm in the worst case.\n\nTherefore, the worst-case time complexity for quicksort is O(n^2).\n\nBut, to be thorough, maybe I should consider some variations or optimizations of quicksort that could affect its worst-case time complexity.\n\nFor instance, if you use randomized pivot selection, the likelihood of hitting the worst case decreases significantly, but in theory, the worst case is still possible.\n\nThere are also variations like introsort, which switches to heapsort when the recursion depth exceeds a certain level, to avoid the O(n^2) worst case.\n\nBut, assuming we're talking about standard quicksort without any modifications, the worst-case time complexity is O(n^2).\n\nSo, the answer should be C. O(n^2).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
