        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! To accomplish this task, we'll need to read data from a CSV file, filter out users who are under 18, and then write the filtered data to a new CSV file. We'll be using Ruby for this script.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Ruby installed on your system. You can download it from [ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) if you haven't already.\n\nWe'll also need the `csv` library in Ruby, which is part of the standard library, so you don't need to install anything extra.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to create the script:\n\n### Step 1: Prepare the CSV File\n\nAssume your CSV file is named `users.csv` and has the following columns: `name`, `age`, `email`.\n\nExample of `users.csv`:\n\n```\nname,age,email\nAlice,25,a@example.com\nBob,17,b@example.com\nCharlie,22,c@example.com\nDavid,15,d@example.com\nEve,30,e@example.com\n```\n\n### Step 2: Write the Ruby Script\n\nCreate a new Ruby file, for example, `filter_users.rb`, and add the following code:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'csv'\n\n# Define the input and output file names\ninput_file = 'users.csv'\noutput_file = 'filtered_users.csv'\n\n# Read the CSV file and filter users who are 18 or older\nfiltered_users = CSV.read(input_file, headers: true).select { |row| row['age'].to_i >= 18 }\n\n# Write the filtered data to a new CSV file\nCSV.open(output_file, 'w') do |csv|\n  csv << ['name', 'age', 'email']  # Write the headers\n  filtered_users.each do |row|\n    csv << [row['name'], row['age'], row['email']]\n  end\nend\n\nputs \"Filtered users have been saved to #{output_file}\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Require the CSV Library**:\n   - We need to require the `csv` library to handle CSV file operations.\n\n2. **Define File Names**:\n   - Specify the input CSV file (`users.csv`) and the output CSV file (`filtered_users.csv`).\n\n3. **Read and Filter Data**:\n   - Use `CSV.read` to read the CSV file with headers.\n   - Use `select` to filter rows where the `age` is 18 or older. We convert the `age` to an integer using `to_i`.\n\n4. **Write Filtered Data**:\n   - Open the output CSV file in write mode.\n   - Write the headers first.\n   - Iterate over the filtered users and write each row to the output file.\n\n5. **Confirmation Message**:\n   - Print a message to confirm that the filtered data has been saved.\n\n### Step 3: Run the Script\n\nOpen your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing your script, and run:\n\n```sh\nruby filter_users.rb\n```\n\nAfter running the script, you should see a new file named `filtered_users.csv` containing only the users who are 18 or older.\n\n### Example of `filtered_users.csv`:\n\n```\nname,age,email\nAlice,25,a@example.com\nCharlie,22,c@example.com\nEve,30,e@example.com\n```\n\nThat's it! This script efficiently filters users based on age and saves the filtered data to a new CSV file. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask."
