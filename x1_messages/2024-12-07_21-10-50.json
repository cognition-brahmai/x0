        "content": "So, in this town, every person has exactly two pets, and these pets are either cats or dogs. There are 100 people living in the town, and we need to find out the total number of legs from both humans and animals.\n\nFirst, let's think about the human legs. Each person has 2 legs, right? So, for 100 people, the total number of human legs would be:\n\n100 people * 2 legs/person = 200 legs\n\nNow, let's consider the pets. Each person has exactly two pets, so in total, there are:\n\n100 people * 2 pets/person = 200 pets\n\nThese pets are either cats or dogs. Both cats and dogs have 4 legs each. So, regardless of whether a pet is a cat or a dog, each pet has 4 legs.\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs from the pets is:\n\n200 pets * 4 legs/pet = 800 legs\n\nNow, to find the total number of legs in the town, we add the human legs and the pet legs together:\n\n200 human legs + 800 pet legs = 1000 legs\n\nSo, there are 1000 legs in total in the town.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Maybe there's something I'm missing. The problem says \"either cats or dogs,\" but does that mean that some pets could be cats and some could be dogs, or does it mean that each person has two cats or two dogs?\n\nHmm, probably it means that each person has two pets, which can be any combination of cats and dogs. But actually, the problem says \"either cats or dogs,\" which might be ambiguous.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"every person has exactly two pets - either cats or dogs.\"\n\nHmm, this could be interpreted in two ways:\n\n1. Each person has two pets, and both pets are either cats or both are dogs.\n\n2. Each person has two pets, and each pet is either a cat or a dog, regardless of the combination.\n\nI think the most straightforward interpretation is the second one, where each person has two pets, and each pet is independently either a cat or a dog.\n\nBut actually, in terms of calculating the total number of legs, it doesn't matter whether both pets are cats, both are dogs, or one of each, because both cats and dogs have 4 legs.\n\nSo, whether a pet is a cat or a dog, it still has 4 legs, so the total number of legs from the pets would be the same in any case.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation should be correct: 100 people with 2 legs each plus 200 pets with 4 legs each, totaling 200 human legs + 800 pet legs = 1000 legs.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor to consider. For example, are there any pets besides cats and dogs? The problem says \"either cats or dogs,\" so presumably, all pets are either cats or dogs, with no other types of pets.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies that every person has exactly two pets, so there are no people with more or fewer pets.\n\nAdditionally, we're to consider both human and animal legs, and we've accounted for all human legs and all pet legs.\n\nI don't think there's anything else to consider. So, the total number of legs in the town is 1000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1000} \\]"
