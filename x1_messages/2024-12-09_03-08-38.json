        "content": "So the restaurant serves about 200 customers each day, and on average, each customer spends $12 on their meal. We want to find out how much money the restaurant makes in one week.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the daily revenue. Since each of the 200 customers spends $12, I can multiply the number of customers by the average spending per customer to get the daily revenue.\n\nSo, daily revenue = number of customers per day \u00d7 average spending per customer = 200 \u00d7 $12.\n\nLet me calculate that: 200 \u00d7 12 = $2,400. So, the restaurant makes $2,400 each day.\n\nNow, to find out the weekly revenue, I need to multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so weekly revenue = daily revenue \u00d7 7 = $2,400 \u00d7 7.\n\nLet's do that multiplication: 2,400 \u00d7 7.\n\nWell, 2,000 \u00d7 7 is 14,000, and 400 \u00d7 7 is 2,800. So, 14,000 + 2,800 equals $16,800.\n\nTherefore, the restaurant will generate $16,800 in revenue in one week.\n\nBut wait, is there anything else I should consider? Is there any possibility that the number of customers or their spending changes on certain days? For example, maybe on weekends they have more customers or people spend more. But since the question says it's an average of 200 customers per day and an average spending of $12, I think it's safe to assume that's the daily average over the whole week.\n\nSo, my final answer is $16,800 per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16800} \\]"
