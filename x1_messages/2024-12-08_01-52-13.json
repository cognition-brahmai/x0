        "content": "If a bee loses its stinger, it typically dies shortly after. This is because the stinger is connected to the bee's digestive tract, and when the bee stings, it pulls out not only the stinger but also part of its internal organs. As a result, the bee suffers a fatal abdominal rupture and eventually dies from the injury. This is why honey bees, in particular, can only sting once, as the stinger is barbed and gets stuck in the skin of the victim, tearing away from the bee's body when it flies off."
