        "content": "Let's see. There are 3 doctors, and each has 4 patients who visit every day. Each patient's visit lasts 15 minutes, and the doctors work at the same time. I need to find out how long it takes for all the patients to be seen by their doctors.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many patients there are in total. Since there are 3 doctors and each has 4 patients, the total number of patients is 3 doctors times 4 patients per doctor, which is 12 patients.\n\nNow, each patient needs 15 minutes with their doctor. But since the doctors are working simultaneously, they can see their patients at the same time.\n\nSo, each doctor has 4 patients, and each patient takes 15 minutes. If the doctor sees one patient at a time, then for 4 patients, it would be 4 times 15 minutes, which is 60 minutes or 1 hour per doctor.\n\nBut since all doctors are working at the same time, the time it takes for all patients to be seen is the same as the time it takes for one doctor to see all their patients, assuming that each doctor is seeing their patients one after another.\n\nWait, but maybe the doctors can see multiple patients at once. Does the question specify whether a doctor can see only one patient at a time or multiple patients simultaneously?\n\nThe question says \"each patient visits the doctor for 15 minutes,\" which suggests that each patient gets individual attention from the doctor for that time period. So, likely, each doctor can see only one patient at a time.\n\nTherefore, each doctor needs 4 times 15 minutes to see all their patients, which is 60 minutes.\n\nSince all doctors are working simultaneously, the overall time required for all patients to be seen is still 60 minutes, because even though they are working at the same time, each doctor still needs 60 minutes to see all their patients.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. If all doctors are working at the same time, and each is seeing their patients one at a time, then the time is determined by the doctor who takes the longest, which in this case, all doctors take 60 minutes.\n\nSo, the total time required for all patients to be seen by their respective doctors is 60 minutes.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's another way to look at it. Maybe the doctors can see their patients in parallel.\n\nLet me consider that each doctor is seeing one patient at a time, and since there are 3 doctors, up to 3 patients can be seen simultaneously.\n\nEach doctor has 4 patients, so perhaps we can have overlapping sessions.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nIn the first 15 minutes:\n\n- Doctor 1 sees patient 1\n\n- Doctor 2 sees patient 1\n\n- Doctor 3 sees patient 1\n\nTotal patients seen: 3\n\nIn the next 15 minutes:\n\n- Doctor 1 sees patient 2\n\n- Doctor 2 sees patient 2\n\n- Doctor 3 sees patient 2\n\nTotal patients seen: 3 more, totaling 6\n\nIn the third 15 minutes:\n\n- Doctor 1 sees patient 3\n\n- Doctor 2 sees patient 3\n\n- Doctor 3 sees patient 3\n\nTotal patients seen: 3 more, totaling 9\n\nIn the fourth 15 minutes:\n\n- Doctor 1 sees patient 4\n\n- Doctor 2 sees patient 4\n\n- Doctor 3 sees patient 4\n\nTotal patients seen: 3 more, totaling 12\n\nSo, in this scenario, the total time is 4 intervals of 15 minutes each, which is 60 minutes.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if the doctors could see multiple patients at once, but the question seems to imply that each patient gets individual time with the doctor.\n\nSo, I think 60 minutes is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any overlapping or parallel processing that could reduce this time.\n\nSuppose that doctors could see more than one patient at a time, but the question suggests that each patient needs 15 minutes with the doctor, implying individual attention.\n\nTherefore, it's reasonable to assume that each doctor can see only one patient at a time.\n\nHence, the total time required is 60 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
