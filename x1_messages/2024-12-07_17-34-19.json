        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to create a chat server using Node.js and WebSockets. I've heard about WebSocket protocol, but I'm not super familiar with it, so this should be a good learning experience.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up a basic Node.js environment. I think I should start by creating a new directory for my project and initializing a new Node.js application there. So, I'll open my terminal and do something like:\n\n```bash\nmkdir chat-server\ncd chat-server\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nThis should create a new folder called \"chat-server\", navigate into it, and create a `package.json` file with default settings.\n\nNext, I need to install the necessary packages. For WebSockets in Node.js, I've heard that the `ws` library is pretty popular. So, I'll install that:\n\n```bash\nnpm install ws\n```\n\nAlright, now that I have the `ws` library installed, I need to understand how to set up a WebSocket server. From what I recall, a WebSocket server in Node.js listens for connections from clients and handles events like connection, disconnection, and message reception.\n\nLet me think about the basic structure of the server. I need to create a server that can handle multiple clients connecting simultaneously and allow them to send messages to each other in real-time.\n\nMaybe I can start by creating a new JavaScript file, say `server.js`, and require the `ws` module there.\n\nHere's a rough outline of what I think the code might look like:\n\n```javascript\nconst WebSocket = require('ws');\n\nconst wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });\n\nwss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {\n  ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {\n    console.log('received: %s', message);\n    // Broadcast the message to all connected clients\n    wss.clients.forEach(function each(client) {\n      if (client !== ws && client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {\n        client.send(message);\n      }\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nOkay, so in this code, I'm creating a new WebSocket server that listens on port 8080. When a client connects, it sets up event listeners for incoming messages. When a message is received, it logs the message and then broadcasts that message to all other connected clients, except the one who sent it.\n\nThis seems like a good starting point. But I need to consider a few things:\n\n1. **Error handling:** I should handle errors that might occur during connections or message transmissions.\n\n2. **Client identification:** It might be useful to assign unique identifiers to each client so that messages can include the sender's name or ID.\n\n3. **Room functionality:** Maybe allow clients to join different rooms and only receive messages from their respective rooms.\n\n4. **Message formatting:** Ensure that messages are properly formatted, perhaps including timestamps.\n\nLet me address these one by one.\n\nFirst, error handling. I can add event listeners for errors on both the server and the client connections.\n\nFor example, on the server level:\n\n```javascript\nwss.on('error', function error(err) {\n  console.error('Server error:', err);\n});\n```\n\nAnd on the client level:\n\n```javascript\nws.on('error', function error(err) {\n  console.error('Connection error:', err);\n});\n```\n\nNext, client identification. To assign unique identifiers to each client, I can generate a unique ID when a client connects and associate it with their connection.\n\nI can use the `uuid` library to generate unique IDs. So, I'll need to install that:\n\n```bash\nnpm install uuid\n```\n\nThen, in the code:\n\n```javascript\nconst uuid = require('uuid');\n\nwss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {\n  const clientId = uuid.v4();\n  ws.clientId = clientId;\n  console.log(`Client connected: ${clientId}`);\n\n  ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {\n    console.log(`Received from ${clientId}: ${message}`);\n    // Broadcast the message with the sender's ID\n    const broadcastMessage = `${clientId}: ${message}`;\n    wss.clients.forEach(function each(client) {\n      if (client !== ws && client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {\n        client.send(broadcastMessage);\n      }\n    });\n  });\n\n  ws.on('close', function close() {\n    console.log(`Client disconnected: ${clientId}`);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis way, each client has a unique ID, and messages include the sender's ID.\n\nNow, regarding room functionality. If I want to allow clients to join different rooms, I need to keep track of which clients are in which rooms.\n\nI can maintain a data structure, perhaps an object, where keys are room names and values are arrays of client connections in that room.\n\nFirst, I need a way for clients to join a room. Maybe when a client connects, they send a message with the room they want to join.\n\nFor example, when a client connects, they send a message like `{ \"action\": \"join\", \"room\": \"general\" }`.\n\nThen, on the server, I can handle this action to add the client to the specified room.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nI'll need to keep track of which rooms each client is in. Maybe each client has an array of rooms they belong to.\n\nAlso, I need to handle sending messages only to clients in the same room.\n\nHere's a rough idea:\n\n```javascript\nconst rooms = {};\n\nwss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {\n  const clientId = uuid.v4();\n  ws.clientId = clientId;\n  ws.rooms = []; // Array to hold rooms this client is in\n  console.log(`Client connected: ${clientId}`);\n\n  ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {\n    try {\n      const data = JSON.parse(message);\n      if (data.action === 'join') {\n        const room = data.room;\n        if (!rooms[room]) {\n          rooms[room] = new Set();\n        }\n        rooms[room].add(ws);\n        ws.rooms.push(room);\n        console.log(`Client ${clientId} joined room ${room}`);\n      } else if (data.action === 'leave') {\n        const room = data.room;\n        if (rooms[room] && rooms[room].has(ws)) {\n          rooms[room].delete(ws);\n          ws.rooms = ws.rooms.filter(r => r !== room);\n          console.log(`Client ${clientId} left room ${room}`);\n        }\n      } else if (data.action === 'send') {\n        const room = data.room;\n        const msg = data.message;\n        if (rooms[room] && rooms[room].has(ws)) {\n          rooms[room].forEach(client => {\n            if (client !== ws && client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {\n              client.send(`${clientId}: ${msg}`);\n            }\n          });\n        }\n      }\n    } catch (e) {\n      console.error('Error parsing message:', e);\n    }\n  });\n\n  ws.on('close', function close() {\n    console.log(`Client disconnected: ${clientId}`);\n    // Remove from all rooms\n    ws.rooms.forEach(room => {\n      if (rooms[room]) {\n        rooms[room].delete(ws);\n      }\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nIn this code, I'm using an object called `rooms`, where each key is a room name and the value is a Set of connected clients in that room.\n\nWhen a client sends a 'join' action, it adds itself to the specified room's Set and records the room in the client's rooms array.\n\nSimilarly, 'leave' action removes the client from the room's Set and updates the client's rooms array.\n\nWhen a client sends a 'send' action, it broadcasts the message to all other clients in the specified room.\n\nI'm using JSON parsing to handle the message data, assuming that messages are JSON strings with actions like 'join', 'leave', and 'send'.\n\nI also added error handling for parsing the JSON message.\n\nNext, message formatting. It might be useful to include timestamps with each message for better readability.\n\nI can modify the message broadcasting to include timestamps.\n\nHere's how I can do it:\n\n```javascript\nconst { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');\nconst WebSocket = require('ws');\nconst uuid = require('uuid');\n\nconst wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });\nconst rooms = {};\n\nwss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {\n  const clientId = uuidv4();\n  ws.clientId = clientId;\n  ws.rooms = []; // Array to hold rooms this client is in\n  console.log(`Client connected: ${clientId}`);\n\n  ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {\n    try {\n      const data = JSON.parse(message);\n      if (data.action === 'join') {\n        const room = data.room;\n        if (!rooms[room]) {\n          rooms[room] = new Set();\n        }\n        rooms[room].add(ws);\n        ws.rooms.push(room);\n        console.log(`Client ${clientId} joined room ${room}`);\n      } else if (data.action === 'leave') {\n        const room = data.room;\n        if (rooms[room] && rooms[room].has(ws)) {\n          rooms[room].delete(ws);\n          ws.rooms = ws.rooms.filter(r => r !== room);\n          console.log(`Client ${clientId} left room ${room}`);\n        }\n      } else if (data.action === 'send') {\n        const room = data.room;\n        const msg = data.message;\n        if (rooms[room] && rooms[room].has(ws)) {\n          const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();\n          const formattedMessage = `{ \"sender\": \"${clientId}\", \"timestamp\": \"${timestamp}\", \"message\": \"${msg}\" }`;\n          rooms[room].forEach(client => {\n            if (client !== ws && client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {\n              client.send(formattedMessage);\n            }\n          });\n        }\n      }\n    } catch (e) {\n      console.error('Error parsing message:', e);\n    }\n  });\n\n  ws.on('close', function close() {\n    console.log(`Client disconnected: ${clientId}`);\n    // Remove from all rooms\n    ws.rooms.forEach(room => {\n      if (rooms[room]) {\n        rooms[room].delete(ws);\n      }\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nwss.on('error', function error(err) {\n  console.error('Server error:', err);\n});\n```\n\nIn this updated code, when a client sends a 'send' action, I create a JSON string that includes the sender's ID, a timestamp, and the message content. This formatted message is then sent to all other clients in the same room.\n\nI'm using `new Date().toISOString()` to get a standardized timestamp.\n\nNow, I need to think about how clients will interact with this server.\n\nClients will need to establish a WebSocket connection to the server and then send JSON messages with specific actions.\n\nFor example, to join a room, a client would send:\n\n```json\n{ \"action\": \"join\", \"room\": \"general\" }\n```\n\nTo send a message in a room, a client would send:\n\n```json\n{ \"action\": \"send\", \"room\": \"general\", \"message\": \"Hello, world!\" }\n```\n\nClients should also be able to leave a room by sending:\n\n```json\n{ \"action\": \"leave\", \"room\": \"general\" }\n```\n\nI should also consider how to handle scenarios where a client tries to join a non-existent room or send a message to a room they're not in.\n\nIn the current implementation, if a client tries to join a non-existent room, the server creates the room automatically. That seems fine.\n\nIf a client tries to send a message to a room they're not in, the server doesn't broadcast the message. That might be acceptable, but perhaps I should send an error message back to the client in such cases.\n\nAdditionally, I might want to send messages back to clients to confirm actions like joining or leaving a room.\n\nLet me think about implementing some form of acknowledgement for actions.\n\nFor example, when a client joins a room, the server could send back a message like:\n\n```json\n{ \"type\": \"ack\", \"action\": \"join\", \"room\": \"general\", \"status\": \"success\" }\n```\n\nSimilarly, if there's an error, it could send:\n\n```json\n{ \"type\": \"ack\", \"action\": \"join\", \"room\": \"general\", \"status\": \"error\", \"message\": \"Room does not exist\" }\n```\n\nBut in our current implementation, the server creates rooms on the fly, so joining a non-existent room should succeed as the room is created when the first client joins.\n\nHowever, perhaps I should validate that the room exists before adding the client to it.\n\nWait, if I allow clients to create rooms dynamically, then there's no need for such validation.\n\nBut maybe some rooms should be restricted, and only certain rooms can be joined.\n\nFor now, I'll keep it simple and allow any room names.\n\nMoving forward, I should also consider how to list all available rooms or list clients in a room.\n\nThat might be useful features to implement.\n\nAnother thing to consider is handling large numbers of clients. With many clients connected, I need to ensure that the server can handle the load efficiently.\n\nWebSockets are designed to be scalable, but I need to make sure that my implementation doesn't have any bottlenecks.\n\nFor example, iterating over all clients in a room to broadcast messages should be efficient enough for a moderate number of clients.\n\nIf scalability becomes an issue, I might need to look into more advanced solutions like using a WebSocket library with built-in clustering or deploying the server across multiple instances.\n\nBut for now, I'll focus on getting the basic functionality working.\n\nI should also think about securing the WebSocket connection, perhaps using SSL/TLS to encrypt the data transmitted between the server and clients.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider authenticating clients to ensure that only authorized users can connect and send messages.\n\nBut for the sake of this exercise, I'll skip authentication and assume that all clients are trusted.\n\nIn a real-world scenario, authentication would be crucial, especially for a chat server.\n\nAnother aspect is rate limiting to prevent abuse, such as clients sending too many messages in a short period.\n\nImplementing rate limiting can help protect the server from being overloaded by malicious or misbehaving clients.\n\nBut again, for this basic implementation, I'll omit rate limiting.\n\nNow, I need to test this server to make sure it works as expected.\n\nI can use tools like `websocat` or write a simple client in JavaScript to connect to the server and send messages.\n\nFirst, I'll run the server by executing:\n\n```bash\nnode server.js\n```\n\nThen, in another terminal, I can use `websocat` to connect to the server:\n\n```bash\nwebsocat ws://localhost:8080\n```\n\nOnce connected, I can send JSON messages as specified earlier.\n\nFor example, to join the \"general\" room:\n\n```json\n{ \"action\": \"join\", \"room\": \"general\" }\n```\n\nThen, from another terminal, connect another client to the same room and send messages between them.\n\nI should verify that messages sent in a room are only received by clients in that room, and not by those in other rooms.\n\nAlso, test joining multiple rooms and sending messages to different rooms.\n\nFurthermore, I need to ensure that when a client disconnects, it is properly removed from all rooms it was in.\n\nI should also check for any memory leaks or lingering connections that could cause the server to consume more resources over time.\n\nTo make the server more robust, I can implement logging for connection and disconnection events, as well as message transmission.\n\nI might also want to send periodic ping frames to keep connections alive, especially in environments that might close inactive sockets.\n\nIn Node.js, the `ws` library handles pings and pongs automatically, so I might not need to do anything extra for that.\n\nHowever, I can set the `pingInterval` option when creating the WebSocket server to control how often pings are sent.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\nconst wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080, pingInterval: 30000 });\n```\n\nThis would send a ping every 30 seconds to keep connections alive.\n\nAnother consideration is handling binary data. In this chat server, we're dealing with text messages, so text frames should suffice.\n\nBut if there's a need to transmit binary data in the future, I need to make sure that the server and clients can handle binary frames appropriately.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure that the server can handle large messages without performance issues.\n\nWebSockets can handle messages of various sizes, but I might need to set message size limits to prevent abuse.\n\nIn the `ws` library, I can set the `maxPayload` option to limit the size of messages.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\nconst wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080, maxPayload: 1 * 1024 * 1024 }); // 1MB\n```\n\nThis would set the maximum message size to 1 megabyte.\n\nI should choose an appropriate limit based on the expected message sizes in the chat application.\n\nNow, thinking about the overall architecture, I might consider using middleware or decorators to handle different aspects of the WebSocket communications, such as authentication, logging, and error handling.\n\nThe `ws` library allows for registering event handlers directly on the server and socket instances, which is straightforward for a simple application like this.\n\nHowever, for more complex scenarios, I might look into using a framework that provides higher-level abstractions for WebSocket applications.\n\nBut for now, the `ws` library should suffice.\n\nI should also consider how to deploy this server in a production environment.\n\nNode.js applications can be run using process managers like PM2, which provide features like process monitoring, auto-restart, and load balancing.\n\nAdditionally, I might need to configure a reverse proxy, such as Nginx, to handle SSL termination and distribute traffic to multiple WebSocket server instances.\n\nBut for development and testing purposes, running the server directly with `node server.js` is sufficient.\n\nAnother aspect is documenting the API for clients to interact with the server.\n\nI need to define the expected message formats and available actions clearly so that clients can communicate correctly with the server.\n\nFor example, I can specify that clients must send JSON objects with an \"action\" field, and depending on the action, include additional fields like \"room\" and \"message\".\n\nI should also define possible error scenarios and how the server responds to invalid messages or actions.\n\nIn the current implementation, the server logs errors but doesn't send any error messages back to the client.\n\nPerhaps I should send error messages back to the client in response to invalid actions or malformed messages.\n\nFor instance, if a client sends a message that isn't valid JSON, or if it includes an unknown action, the server could send back an error message indicating the problem.\n\nHere's an example of how I might implement that:\n\n```javascript\nws.on('message', function incoming(message) {\n  try {\n    const data = JSON.parse(message);\n    if (typeof data.action !== 'string') {\n      throw new Error('Invalid action');\n    }\n    switch (data.action) {\n      case 'join':\n        // Handle join\n        break;\n      case 'leave':\n        // Handle leave\n        break;\n      case 'send':\n        // Handle send\n        break;\n      default:\n        throw new Error('Unknown action');\n    }\n  } catch (e) {\n    console.error('Error parsing message:', e);\n    ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'error', message: e.message }));\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn this code, if there's an error parsing the message or if the action is unknown, the server sends back an error message to the client.\n\nThis way, clients can handle errors appropriately.\n\nI should also consider implementing heartbeats or keep-alive mechanisms to detect disconnected clients more quickly.\n\nThe `ws` library has built-in support for ping and pong frames, which can be used for this purpose.\n\nI can set the `pingInterval` option when creating the WebSocket server to send periodic pings to clients.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\nconst wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080, pingInterval: 30000 });\n```\n\nThis would send a ping to each connected client every 30 seconds.\n\nClients are expected to respond with a pong frame, and if they don't, the server can close the connection.\n\nThis helps in cleaning up stale connections more efficiently.\n\nAnother enhancement could be to implement presence information, where clients can see who else is in the same room.\n\nFor that, when a client joins a room, the server could broadcast a message to all other clients in the room indicating that a new user has joined.\n\nSimilarly, when a client leaves a room or disconnects, the server could notify the other clients about the departure.\n\nHere's how I might implement that:\n\n```javascript\nwss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {\n  const clientId = uuidv4();\n  ws.clientId = clientId;\n  ws.rooms = []; // Array to hold rooms this client is in\n  console.log(`Client connected: ${clientId}`);\n\n  ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {\n    try {\n      const data = JSON.parse(message);\n      if (data.action === 'join') {\n        const room = data.room;\n        if (!rooms[room]) {\n          rooms[room] = new Set();\n        }\n        rooms[room].add(ws);\n        ws.rooms.push(room);\n        console.log(`Client ${clientId} joined room ${room}`);\n        // Notify other clients in the room that a new user has joined\n        const joinMessage = `{ \"type\": \"system\", \"message\": \"Client ${clientId} has joined.\" }`;\n        rooms[room].forEach(client => {\n          if (client !== ws && client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {\n            client.send(joinMessage);\n          }\n        });\n      } else if (data.action === 'leave') {\n        const room = data.room;\n        if (rooms[room] && rooms[room].has(ws)) {\n          rooms[room].delete(ws);\n          ws.rooms = ws.rooms.filter(r => r !== room);\n          console.log(`Client ${clientId} left room ${room}`);\n          // Notify other clients in the room that a user has left\n          const leaveMessage = `{ \"type\": \"system\", \"message\": \"Client ${clientId} has left.\" }`;\n          rooms[room].forEach(client => {\n            if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {\n              client.send(leaveMessage);\n            }\n          });\n        }\n      } else if (data.action === 'send') {\n        const room = data.room;\n        const msg = data.message;\n        if (rooms[room] && rooms[room].has(ws)) {\n          const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();\n          const formattedMessage = `{ \"sender\": \"${clientId}\", \"timestamp\": \"${timestamp}\", \"message\": \"${msg}\" }`;\n          rooms[room].forEach(client => {\n            if (client !== ws && client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {\n              client.send(formattedMessage);\n            }\n          });\n        }\n      }\n    } catch (e) {\n      console.error('Error parsing message:', e);\n      ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'error', message: e.message }));\n    }\n  });\n\n  ws.on('close', function close() {\n    console.log(`Client disconnected: ${clientId}`);\n    // Notify other clients in the same rooms that this client has left\n    ws.rooms.forEach(room => {\n      if (rooms[room]) {\n        const leaveMessage = `{ \"type\": \"system\", \"message\": \"Client ${clientId} has disconnected.\" }`;\n        rooms[room].forEach(client => {\n          if (client !== ws && client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {\n            client.send(leaveMessage);\n          }\n        });\n        rooms[room].delete(ws);\n      }\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nIn this updated code, when a client joins or leaves a room, the server broadcasts a system message to the other clients in the room, notifying them of the join or leave event.\n\nSimilarly, when a client disconnects, the server notifies other clients in all the rooms the disconnecting client was in.\n\nThis enhances the user experience by providing\u5b9e\u65f6 presence information.\n\nNow, I need to consider how to handle multiple messages from the same client in quick succession.\n\nIn the current implementation, each message triggers a separate broadcast to other clients.\n\nIf a client sends multiple messages in rapid succession, this could lead to a burst of messages being sent to other clients.\n\nTo smooth out the message flow, I might consider implementing some form of message batching or throttling.\n\nHowever, for a chat application, it's generally acceptable to send messages as they are received, assuming that clients can handle the message rate.\n\nAnother consideration is handling large messages or messages containing special characters.\n\nSince I'm using JSON to serialize messages, I need to ensure that messages are properly escaped to prevent JSON injection attacks.\n\nThe `JSON.stringify` method should handle most escaping automatically, but I need to be cautious when including user-provided data in JSON objects.\n\nIn the current implementation, I'm directly including the client ID and message content in the JSON string, which should be safe as long as these values don't contain any executable code.\n\nHowever, if messages can contain complex structures or if there's a possibility of embedding scripts, I need to be more careful.\n\nFor now, assuming that messages are plain text, this should suffice.\n\nI should also think about internationalization and supporting multiple languages.\n\nEnsuring that the server can handle Unicode characters properly is important for supporting non-English languages.\n\nIn Node.js, when working with WebSockets and text frames, Unicode characters should be handled correctly as long as the encoding is set to 'utf8'.\n\nThe `ws` library defaults to 'utf8' encoding for text frames, so this should be covered.\n\nAnother aspect is logging. In a production environment, I need to have comprehensive logging to monitor the server's activity, track issues, and analyze usage patterns.\n\nI can use a logging library like `winston` or `pino` to handle logging with different levels (e.g., info, warning, error) and possibly output logs to files or external logging services.\n\nFor development, console logging is sufficient, but for production, more robust logging is essential.\n\nI should also consider implementing metrics and monitoring to keep track of the number of connected clients, messages sent, and server performance.\n\nTools like Prometheus and Grafana can be used to collect and visualize metrics from the server.\n\nBut for this basic implementation, I'll stick with console logging.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that the server can handle concurrent connections efficiently.\n\nNode.js is designed to handle a high number of concurrent connections due to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that my code doesn't introduce any blocking operations or excessive memory usage that could degrade performance.\n\nIn the current implementation, all client connections are held in memory in the `rooms` object.\n\nFor a moderate number of clients, this should be fine, but if the number of clients scales up significantly, I need to ensure that the server can handle the memory load.\n\nAdditionally, iterating over all clients in a room to broadcast messages should be efficient enough for most use cases.\n\nIf performance becomes an issue with a large number of clients, I might need to look into optimizing the broadcasting mechanism or sharding the connections across multiple server instances.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume that the server can handle the expected load.\n\nAnother consideration is handling server restarts or downtime.\n\nWhen the server restarts, all existing connections are terminated, and any room data is lost.\n\nIf persistence is required, I need to implement a way to store room data and client connections across server restarts.\n\nThis could involve using a database to store room information and client associations.\n\nHowever, for a simple chat server, losing state on server restart might be acceptable.\n\nFinally, I need to think about how to extend this server in the future.\n\nFor example, adding features like private messaging, message history, user profiles, or emoticons.\n\nTo make the server more modular and easier to extend, I might consider organizing the code into separate modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the server's functionality.\n\nFor instance, having a module for handling room operations, another for message broadcasting, and another for client management.\n\nThis would make it easier to add new features or modify existing ones without affecting the entire codebase.\n\nIn summary, I've designed a basic WebSocket chat server in Node.js using the `ws` library.\n\nThe server allows multiple clients to connect, join rooms, send messages, and receive messages from other clients in the same room.\n\nIt includes features like client identification, room management, message broadcasting with timestamps, and basic error handling.\n\nWhile this implementation provides a solid foundation, there are several areas for improvement and expansion, such as authentication, authorization, scalability, security, and additional features to enhance the chat experience.\n\nFor now, I'll consider this a successful first step in building a real-time chat server using WebSockets in Node.js."
