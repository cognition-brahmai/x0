Let's see, \"If you drop me I'm sure to crack, but give me a smile and I'll always smile back.\" Hmm, okay, so the first part is about dropping it and it cracking. That suggests something fragile, maybe made of glass or ceramic. And the second part says that if you smile at it, it smiles back. So maybe it's a mirror? Because mirrors can reflect smiles, and if you drop a mirror, it could crack.\n\nWait, but mirrors are usually made of glass these days, which can crack if dropped. And older mirrors might have been made with glass backed by metal, which could also break. So yeah, that seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a smiley face or something like that, but a smiley face doesn't really crack when dropped. Maybe it's a porcelain doll with a smile, but that seems a bit off. No, I think a mirror makes the most sense here.\n\nSo, my answer is a mirror."
