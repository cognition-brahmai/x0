Electromagnetism studies the interactions between electric charges and currents, while quantum mechanics describes the behavior of particles at the smallest scales. Given this, which branch of physics would most likely be used to explain the phenomenon of light behaving both as a particle and a wave?\nA. Classical Mechanics\nB. Electromagnetism\nC.

        "content": "I think the answer is C. Quantum Mechanics. Here's why: Light behaving both as a particle and a wave is a concept that falls under wave-particle duality, which is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, particles like photons can exhibit both particle-like and wave-like properties, depending on the experiment. This is different from classical mechanics, which deals with the motion of macroscopic objects and doesn't account for wave-particle duality. Electromagnetism explains how electrically charged particles interact, and while light is an electromagnetic wave, the dual nature of light as both a particle and a wave is better explained by quantum mechanics. Thermodynamics deals with heat and energy, so that doesn't seem directly related to the behavior of light in this context. So, quantum mechanics seems to be the most appropriate choice here."
