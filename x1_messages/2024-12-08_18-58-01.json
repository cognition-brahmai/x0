        "content": "The term you're referring to in Environmental Science is the \"Competitive Exclusion Principle.\" This principle, also known as Gause's law, suggests that two species competing for the exact same resources cannot stably coexist. One species will outcompete the other, leading to the exclusion or extinction of the less competitive species. This concept is fundamental in understanding species distribution, biodiversity, and ecosystem dynamics.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. Competitive Exclusion Principle.\n\nTo provide some more context:\n\n- **Symbiosis** (Option A) is a close and long-term interaction between two different biological species. This can include various types of relationships such as mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism.\n\n- **Mutualism** (Option C) is a type of symbiotic relationship where both species benefit from the interaction.\n\n- **Commensalism** (Option D) is another type of symbiotic relationship where one species benefits and the other is neither helped nor harmed.\n\nUnderstanding these different interactions is crucial in ecology as they help explain how species coexist and influence each other's evolution and distribution.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"
