        "content": "To find the average speed for the entire round trip, we need to consider both the distance traveled and the time taken for each leg of the journey. The average speed is defined as the total distance divided by the total time.\n\nLet's denote the distance between City A and City B as \\( d \\) kilometers.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time taken for the trip from City A to City B. The speed is 60 km/h, so the time \\( t_1 \\) is:\n\\[\nt_1 = \\frac{d}{60} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the time taken for the return trip from City B to City A. The speed is 90 km/h, so the time \\( t_2 \\) is:\n\\[\nt_2 = \\frac{d}{90} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThe total distance for the round trip is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = d + d = 2d \\text{ kilometers}\n\\]\n\nThe total time for the round trip is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = t_1 + t_2 = \\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{d}{90}\n\\]\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 90 is 180. So we rewrite the fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{60} = \\frac{3d}{180}, \\quad \\frac{d}{90} = \\frac{2d}{180}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\frac{3d}{180} + \\frac{2d}{180} = \\frac{5d}{180} = \\frac{d}{36} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, the average speed \\( v_{\\text{avg}} \\) is:\n\\[\nv_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}} = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{36}} = 2d \\times \\frac{36}{d} = 72 \\text{ km/h}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the train's average speed for the entire round trip is 72 km/h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72 \\text{ km/h}} \\]"
