        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains, one leaving Station A going towards Station B, and the other leaving Station B going towards Station A. The distance between A and B is 300 miles. The first train goes at 70 mph, and the second at 80 mph. I need to find out when they meet.\n\nOkay, so both trains are moving towards each other. That means their speeds add up when calculating how quickly they'll meet. So, the combined speed is 70 + 80 = 150 miles per hour.\n\nNow, they're covering a total distance of 300 miles between them. So, time equals distance divided by speed. So, time = 300 miles / 150 mph.\n\nLet me calculate that: 300 divided by 150 is 2. So, they meet after 2 hours.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should approach it differently to confirm.\n\nLet's think about it in terms of each train's journey.\n\nTrain from A: traveling at 70 mph towards B.\n\nTrain from B: traveling at 80 mph towards A.\n\nThey leave at the same time and meet at some point.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time they travel until they meet as t hours.\n\nIn t hours, Train A covers a distance of 70t miles.\n\nIn the same t hours, Train B covers 80t miles.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they cover should equal the total distance between A and B, which is 300 miles.\n\nSo, 70t + 80t = 300.\n\nCombining like terms, that's 150t = 300.\n\nNow, solving for t: t = 300 / 150 = 2 hours.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation.\n\nMaybe I can try another approach to be extra sure.\n\nLet's think about their relative speed. Since they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is 70 + 80 = 150 mph.\n\nSo, again, time to meet would be the total distance divided by the relative speed: 300 / 150 = 2 hours.\n\nAlright, consistent again.\n\nAlternatively, I could find out how far each train travels in time t until they meet.\n\nFor Train A: distance = 70t miles.\n\nFor Train B: distance = 80t miles.\n\nSince the sum of these distances is 300 miles, 70t + 80t = 300, which simplifies to 150t = 300, so t = 2 hours.\n\nYou know what, I think I've confirmed it enough ways. They meet after 2 hours.\n\nI feel confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
