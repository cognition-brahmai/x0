To create a simple Node.js script that listens for HTTP requests and responds with the current date and time in JSON format, you'll need to use the built-in `http` module in Node.js.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Set up your project:**\n   - Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).\n   - Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.\n\n2. **Create the script:**\n   - Create a new file, let's call it `server.js`.\n\n3. **Write the code:**\n   - You'll need to create an HTTP server that listens on a specified port and sends back the current date and time in JSON format.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```javascript\nconst http = require('http');\n\nconst port = 3000; // You can change this to any port you prefer\n\nconst requestHandler = (request, response) => {\n  const currentTime = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();\n  const current_date = new Date().toLocaleDateString();\n  const data = {\n    date: current_date,\n    time: currentTime\n  };\n  response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });\n  response.end(JSON.stringify(data));\n};\n\nconst server = http.createServer(requestHandler);\n\nserver.listen(port, (err) => {\n  if (err) {\n    return console.log('something bad happened', err);\n  }\n\n  console.log(`Server is listening on ${port}`);\n});\n```\n\n4. **Run the script:**\n   - Open your terminal or command prompt.\n   - Navigate to your project directory.\n   - Run the script using the command: `node server.js`.\n\n5. **Test the server:**\n   - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.\n   - You should see a JSON response with the current date and time.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **http module:** This is a built-in Node.js module for handling HTTP requests.\n- **server.listen(port):** This makes the server start listening on the specified port.\n- **requestHandler:** This function is called whenever there is an incoming request. It creates an object with the current date and time, sets the response header to JSON, and sends the JSON string as the response.\n\nThis is a basic example, and in a real-world scenario, you might want to handle different types of requests, handle errors more gracefully, and perhaps use a framework like Express for more complex applications. But for your requirement, this should suffice.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!"
