John finished before Alice but after David.\n\n2. Emily finished before Charles but after Alice.\n\nOkay, so from the first clue, John is after David but before Alice. That means David finished before John, and John finished before Alice. So, the order so far is David, John, Alice.\n\nBut wait, the second clue says Emily finished before Charles but after Alice. So, Alice finished before Emily, and Emily finished before Charles.\n\nLet me try to put this all together.\n\nWe have:\n\n- David finished before John.\n\n- John finished before Alice.\n\n- Alice finished before Emily.\n\n- Emily finished before Charles.\n\nSo, the order seems to be:\n\n1. David\n\n2. John\n\n3. Alice\n\n4. Emily\n\n5. Charles\n\nDoes that make sense? Let me check again.\n\nAccording to the first clue: John finished before Alice but after David. Yes, in this order, John is after David and before Alice.\n\nAccording to the second clue: Emily finished before Charles but after Alice. Yes, Emily is after Alice and before Charles.\n\nLooks good!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{David, John, Alice, Emily, Charles}} \\]"
