        "content": "Riddle me this: \"By moon or by sun, I shall be found. Yet I am undone, if there's no light around.\" Hmm, interesting. So, it's something that can be seen whether it's daytime or nighttime, but disappears or ceases to exist without light. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, \"by moon or by sun,\" that suggests it's visible under both moonlight and sunlight. So, it's something that can be observed during the day and at night. Maybe it's a phenomenon that requires light to be seen, but what exactly?\n\nNext, \"I shall be found,\" meaning it's discoverable or observable under these conditions. And then, \"yet I am undone, if there's no light around.\" \"Undone\" could mean it disappears, ceases to exist, or can't be seen without light.\n\nSo, combining these clues, it seems like the answer is something that needs light to be perceived or to exist. It could be something as straightforward as \"shadow,\" but shadows exist because of light; without light, there are no shadows. Wait, but shadows are formed when an object blocks light, so in complete darkness, there are no shadows because there's no light to cast them.\n\nBut let's think differently. Maybe it's \"reflection.\" Reflections can be seen both in daylight and at night (like seeing the moon in water). However, without light, there can be no reflection. So, that fits the bill.\n\nAnother possibility is \"image\" or \"vision.\" We can see images by the light of the sun or the moon, but in complete darkness, without any light, we can't see anything. So, that could work too.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's something more specific, like \"photons\" or \"light particles.\" They are what make vision possible, but that seems a bit too abstract for a riddle.\n\nLet's consider something more tangible. Maybe it's \"photography.\" Photographs can be taken in daylight or at night with artificial light, but without light, you can't capture an image. That could be a possibility.\n\nWait, but the phrase \"I shall be found\" suggests something that exists naturally, not something created by humans. So, photography might not fit perfectly.\n\nHow about \"auroras\"? Auroras are visible at night, often by the light of the moon, and they require sunlight to occur, as they are caused by solar wind interacting with the Earth's magnetosphere. However, they don't necessarily disappear completely without light, as they are a light phenomenon themselves.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps it's something simpler, like \"echo.\" Echoes can be heard whether it's day or night, but they require sound waves, not light. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's \"heat.\" We can feel heat from the sun during the day and from the moon's reflection at night, but without light, heat might not be present. However, heat is not directly related to light, although sunlight does provide heat.\n\nI'm going back to the reflection idea. Reflections are visible both in day and night when there is light, and they disappear in complete darkness. That seems to fit the riddle well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's \"image\" in a more general sense. An image, whether in a mirror, on a screen, or in a photograph, requires light to be visible. In the dark, without light, the image can't be seen.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps it's \"light itself.\" Light is what allows us to see things both in the sun and by the moon. Without light, there is darkness, and thus, \"undone.\"\n\nBut the phrase \"I shall be found\" suggests that it's something that exists and can be discovered, not just light itself. Maybe it's more about the interaction of light with objects.\n\nWait, maybe it's \"shine\" or \"glow.\" Things shine or glow by the light of the sun or moon, but without light, they don't shine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's \"color.\" We see colors because of light; in darkness, colors can't be perceived.\n\nThat seems promising. Without light, colors don't exist to our eyes. So, color could be something that is \"undone\" without light.\n\nBut then again, colors are a property of objects as they interact with light. Without light, those properties can't be perceived, so in a sense, they are \"undone.\"\n\nAnother possibility: \"shadow.\" Shadows are created by the presence of light and objects blocking that light. Without light, there are no shadows. So, shadows could be something that is \"undone\" without light.\n\nBut earlier, I thought of reflections or images, which also require light to be seen. It's tricky to decide between these options.\n\nLet me look at the riddle again: \"By moon or by sun, I shall be found. Yet I am undone, if there's no light around.\"\n\nIf I consider \"moon\" and \"sun\" as sources of light, then it's something that requires light to be present or to be observed.\n\nAmong the options, reflection, image, color, and shadow all fit this description. Perhaps the answer is more towards something that is a result of light interacting with objects, like a reflection or a shadow.\n\nBut to narrow it down, maybe I should think about what is commonly associated with both sunlight and moonlight.\n\nReflections are visible in both daylight and moonlight, especially on water or shiny surfaces. Shadows are also present in both sunlight and moonlight, though moon shadows might be less distinct due to the weaker light.\n\nColors are visible in sunlight, but under moonlight, colors are less vibrant or may appear in different shades, but still, some color perception remains.\n\nHowever, reflections seem to be a strong candidate because they directly depend on light to be visible and are observable under both solar and lunar light.\n\nSo, I'm going to guess that the answer is \"reflection.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{reflection}} \\]"
