        "content": "Alright, I need to find out the average lifespan of a Galapagos tortoise and where they typically live. I think the best way to start is by searching for some general information about Galapagos tortoises. I can use the YahooSearch tool for that.\n\nSo, first step:\n\nPlan: Perform a Yahoo search to find information about Galapagos tortoises.\n\n#E1 = YahooSearch[Galapagos tortoise lifespan and habitat]\n\nOnce I have the search results, I'll need to look through the pages that come up to find the specific information about lifespan and habitat. Maybe I can extract the text from those pages to make it easier to read and analyze.\n\nPlan: Extract textual content from the top search results.\n\n#E2 = TextExtractor[#E1]\n\nNow, with the text extracted, I can look for the answers to my questions. But maybe it's too much text to go through manually. I can use the KnowledgeBase tool to ask specific questions based on the extracted text.\n\nPlan: Use KnowledgeBase to ask about the average lifespan and habitat of Galapagos tortoises, referring to the extracted text.\n\n#E3 = KnowledgeBase[What is the average lifespan of a Galapagos tortoise, given #E2?]\n\n#E4 = KnowledgeBase[Where do Galapagos tortoises typically live, given #E2?]\n\nFinally, I can compile the answers from #E3 and #E4 to give the final answer.\n\nFinal Answer: According to #E3 and #E4, the average lifespan of a Galapagos tortoise is [insert answer from #E3], and they typically live in [insert answer from #E4]."
