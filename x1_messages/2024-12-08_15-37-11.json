He's celebrated for discovering penicillin, which had a big impact on medicine, and his research led to significant advancements in healthcare.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't sound right. I know that Albert Einstein is famous, but I think there might be some confusion here. Let me double-check.\n\nFirst, Albert Einstein is actually known as a physicist, not a biologist. He's famous for his theory of relativity and contributions to the development of the atomic bomb, among other things. He was born in Ulm, Germany, in 1879, not in London in 1880.\n\nAnd penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928, not by Einstein.\n\nSo, it seems like there's some mix-up in the information provided here. Maybe the text is confusing Albert Einstein with someone else?\n\nLet me try to find more accurate information.\n\nUpon checking, Albert Einstein was indeed born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany. He is world-renowned for his contributions to physics, particularly the theory of relativity and the famous equation E=mc\u00b2. His work laid the foundation for the development of atomic energy and earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.\n\nOn the other hand, penicillin was discovered by Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming in 1928, which revolutionized the treatment of bacterial infections.\n\nSo, to answer your question accurately:\n\nAlbert Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany, on March 14, 1879. He is best known for his contributions to physics, including the theory of relativity and the mass-energy equivalence formula E=mc\u00b2.\n\nAs for penicillin, it was discovered by Alexander Fleming.\n\nI hope that clears things up!\n\n[Citation: Biography.com, \"Albert Einstein\" and other reliable sources]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany on March 14, 1879. He is best known for his contributions to physics, including the theory of relativity and the mass-energy equivalence formula } E=mc^2.} \\]"
