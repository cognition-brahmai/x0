        "content": "Let's see. The train goes from City A to City B at 60 miles per hour, and the distance is 120 miles. Then it comes back from City B to City A at 40 miles per hour. I need to find the average speed for the whole round trip.\n\nFirst, I should remember what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, for a round trip, the total distance would be twice the one-way distance, which is 2 \u00d7 120 miles = 240 miles.\n\nNow, I need to find the total time taken for the round trip. The time taken for each leg of the trip can be found using the formula: time = distance / speed.\n\nGoing from City A to City B:\n\nTime = 120 miles / 60 mph = 2 hours.\n\nComing back from City B to City A:\n\nTime = 120 miles / 40 mph = 3 hours.\n\nSo, the total time for the round trip is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.\n\nNow, average speed = total distance / total time = 240 miles / 5 hours = 48 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that when speeds are different for the same distance, the average speed isn't just the arithmetic mean. Maybe I should use the harmonic mean for speeds.\n\nLet me think about that. The harmonic mean is used when dealing with rates, like speeds, where the same distance is traveled at different speeds.\n\nThe formula for the harmonic mean of two speeds is:\n\nAverage speed = 2 \u00d7 (speed1 \u00d7 speed2) / (speed1 + speed2).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nAverage speed = 2 \u00d7 (60 \u00d7 40) / (60 + 40) = 2 \u00d7 2400 / 100 = 48 miles per hour.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer: 48 miles per hour.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I consider the entire journey. The train travels 120 miles at 60 mph and 120 miles at 40 mph.\n\nTotal distance: 240 miles.\n\nTotal time: 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.\n\nAverage speed: 240 miles / 5 hours = 48 mph.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the average of the two speeds: (60 + 40)/2 = 50 mph, but that's not correct for average speed, because the time spent at each speed is different.\n\nThe train travels slower on the way back, so it spends more time at the slower speed. Therefore, the average speed should be closer to the slower speed.\n\nIn this case, 48 mph is indeed closer to 40 mph than it is to 60 mph.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the weighted average, where the weights are the times spent at each speed.\n\nTime at 60 mph: 2 hours.\n\nTime at 40 mph: 3 hours.\n\nTotal time: 5 hours.\n\nAverage speed: (2/5)\u00d760 + (3/5)\u00d740 = (0.4\u00d760) + (0.6\u00d740) = 24 + 24 = 48 mph.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think 48 miles per hour is correct.\n\nWait, but sometimes people might think that average speed is just the average of the two speeds, which would be 50 mph, but that's a common mistake.\n\nIn reality, the correct average speed is 48 mph.\n\nLet me see if there's any other factor to consider, like stops or acceleration, but the problem doesn't mention any of that, so I assume the average speeds given include all such factors.\n\nSo, my final answer is 48 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
