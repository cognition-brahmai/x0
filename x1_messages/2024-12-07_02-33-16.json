        "content": "So the city wants to revamp its public parks, right? They've got ten parks now, covering 500 acres in total, and they want to increase that by 20%. Plus, they wanna add new stuff like playgrounds, sports courts, and picnic areas. Got it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much more land they need to acquire to reach that 20% increase. They have 500 acres now, so 20% of 500 is:\n\n20% of 500 acres = 0.20 * 500 = 100 acres\n\nSo they need to acquire an additional 100 acres.\n\nNow, acquiring new land costs $50,000 per acre. So for 100 acres, that would be:\n\n100 acres * $50,000/acre = $5,000,000\n\nThat's just for the land.\n\nNext, they need to develop each acre with amenities, and that costs an additional $100,000 per acre. So for the new 100 acres, that would be:\n\n100 acres * $100,000/acre = $10,000,000\n\nBut wait, they're also going to develop the existing 500 acres with new amenities, right? The question says \"revamp its public parks,\" so probably both the existing parks and the new land will get the new amenities.\n\nSo, for the existing 500 acres:\n\n500 acres * $100,000/acre = $50,000,000\n\nAnd for the new 100 acres:\n\n100 acres * $100,000/acre = $10,000,000\n\nSo total development cost is:\n\n$50,000,000 (existing) + $10,000,000 (new) = $60,000,000\n\nNow, adding the cost of acquiring the new land:\n\n$5,000,000 (land) + $60,000,000 (development) = $65,000,000\n\nSo, the total estimated cost for the project would be $65,000,000.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, the question says they want to increase the total park area by 20%, which is 100 acres, and add amenities to both existing and new parks. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlso, the costs are $50,000 per acre for land acquisition and $100,000 per acre for development.\n\nSo, land acquisition: 100 acres * $50,000 = $5,000,000\n\nDevelopment: (500 + 100) acres * $100,000 = 600 acres * $100,000 = $60,000,000\n\nTotal: $5,000,000 + $60,000,000 = $65,000,000\n\nYeah, that seems about right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{65000000} \\]"
