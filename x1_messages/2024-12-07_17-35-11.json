        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a class of 40 students, and there are 8 more girls than boys. We need to find out how many boys are there in the class.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what's being said. There are boys and girls in the class, and the total number of students is 40. Also, the number of girls is 8 more than the number of boys. So, if we can express the number of girls in terms of the number of boys, we might be able to set up an equation to solve for the number of boys.\n\nLet's use variables to represent the unknowns. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) represent the number of boys in the class.\n\n- Since there are 8 more girls than boys, the number of girls would be \\( b + 8 \\).\n\nNow, the total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and girls, which is 40. So, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ b + (b + 8) = 40 \\]\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n\\[ 2b + 8 = 40 \\]\n\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 2b = 32 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ b = 16 \\]\n\nSo, there are 16 boys in the class.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check this. If there are 16 boys, then the number of girls would be \\( 16 + 8 = 24 \\). Adding them together: \\( 16 + 24 = 40 \\), which matches the total number of students. So, our answer seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that if we had an equal number of boys and girls, the total would be even, but since there are 8 more girls, we need to account for that difference.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the difference method. Let\u2019s say the number of boys is \\( b \\), and the number of girls is \\( g \\). We know that:\n\n1. \\( b + g = 40 \\) (total students)\n\n2. \\( g = b + 8 \\) (8 more girls than boys)\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first:\n\n\\[ b + (b + 8) = 40 \\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 2b + 8 = 40 \\]\n\nThen, solving for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ 2b = 32 \\]\n\n\\[ b = 16 \\]\n\nAgain, we get 16 boys.\n\nAlternatively, we could think of it as:\n\nIf we subtract the difference (8) from the total (40), we get the total if the number of boys and girls were equal. So:\n\n\\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \\]\n\nNow, this 32 would be twice the number of boys, since \\( b + b = 2b \\). So:\n\n\\[ 2b = 32 \\]\n\n\\[ b = 16 \\]\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nLet\u2019s try one more approach to be thorough. Suppose we don\u2019t know the difference and just have the total. But in this case, we do know the difference, so maybe we can use ratios or something similar.\n\nWait, since there are 8 more girls than boys, the difference is 8, and the total is 40. This is a classic problem of finding two numbers when their sum and difference are known.\n\nThe formula for such problems is:\n\n- Larger number = (sum + difference)/2\n\n- Smaller number = (sum - difference)/2\n\nIn this case, the larger number is the number of girls, and the smaller is the number of boys.\n\nSo:\n\n- Number of girls = (40 + 8)/2 = 48/2 = 24\n\n- Number of boys = (40 - 8)/2 = 32/2 = 16\n\nAgain, we get 16 boys.\n\nSo, no matter which method we use, we keep arriving at 16 boys in the class.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 16 boys.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
