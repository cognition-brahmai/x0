        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are 800 students in total at the school. 60% of them participate in sports activities. Out of those who participate in sports, 30% also join the music club. I need to find out how many students participate in both sports and music.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many students participate in sports. Since 60% of 800 students participate in sports, I can calculate that by multiplying 800 by 60%.\n\nSo, 800 * 60% = 800 * 0.6 = 480 students participate in sports.\n\nNow, out of these 480 students who participate in sports, 30% also join the music club. So, I need to find 30% of 480.\n\nThat would be 480 * 30% = 480 * 0.3 = 144 students.\n\nTherefore, 144 students participate in both sports and music.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find the percentage of students who participate in both sports and music relative to the total number of students.\n\nFirst, 60% participate in sports, and of those, 30% also join music. So, the percentage of students who do both would be 60% * 30% = 18%.\n\nThen, 18% of 800 students would be 800 * 0.18 = 144 students.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, 144 students participate in both sports and music.\n\nAlternatively, I could use proportions or set theory, but I think this straightforward percentage calculation is sufficient for this problem.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this calculation. For example, are there students who join the music club but not sports? The question doesn't provide that information, and it's not needed for this particular problem since we're only interested in students who participate in both activities.\n\nAlso, the total number of students is 800, and the percentages given seem straightforward. There doesn't appear to be any trick or additional layer to this problem.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 144 students.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{144} \\]"
