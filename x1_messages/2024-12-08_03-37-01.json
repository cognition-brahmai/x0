        "content": "In the field of Environmental Science, the term \"keystone species\" refers to a species on which other species in an ecosystem largely depend. So, the correct answer is B. A keystone species plays a critical role in maintaining the structure of an ecological community, affecting many other organisms in an ecosystem and helping to determine the types and numbers of various other species in the community.\n\nFor example, sea otters are considered a keystone species in kelp forest ecosystems because they prey on sea urchins, which if left unchecked, can overgraze kelp forests, leading to their destruction. By controlling sea urchin populations, sea otters help maintain healthy kelp forests, which provide habitat for many other species.\n\nAnother example is the African elephant, which is a keystone species in savanna ecosystems. Elephants shape their habitat by knocking down trees and creating open spaces, which benefits a variety of other species that depend on the mixture of grasslands and woodlands.\n\nThe concept of a keystone species is important in conservation biology because protecting these species can have wide-ranging positive effects on the entire ecosystem. It's not just about saving one species; it's about maintaining the balance and health of the entire ecological community.\n\nSo, to sum it up, a keystone species is one that has a disproportionate effect on its environment relative to its abundance. Its removal would cause a significant disruption to the ecosystem, often leading to dramatic changes in the ecosystem's structure and function.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- **Ecological Roles:** Keystone species often fulfill unique roles in their ecosystems, such as predation, pollination, seed dispersal, or habitat creation.\n\n- **Biodiversity:** By maintaining the diversity of species in an ecosystem, keystone species help ensure the resilience of the ecosystem in the face of environmental changes.\n\n- **Conservation Priorities:** Identifying and protecting keystone species is crucial for effective conservation strategies, as their preservation can have cascading benefits for many other species and ecosystem processes.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the concept of keystone species!
