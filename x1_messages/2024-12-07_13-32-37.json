        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are 50 people in a group, and among them, 35 have a cat, 25 have a dog, and 15 have both a cat and a dog. I need to find out how many people don't have either a cat or a dog. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember there's something called the principle of inclusion-exclusion that might be useful here. It's a way to count things without double-counting when there's overlap. So, in this case, the overlap is the 15 people who have both a cat and a dog.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- C as the number of people who have a cat.\n\n- D as the number of people who have a dog.\n\n- Both as the number of people who have both a cat and a dog.\n\n- Total as the total number of people in the group.\n\n- Neither as the number of people who don't have either a cat or a dog.\n\nFrom the problem, I have:\n\nC = 35\n\nD = 25\n\nBoth = 15\n\nTotal = 50\n\nI need to find Neither.\n\nAccording to the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of people who have either a cat or a dog or both is equal to the number who have cats plus the number who have dogs minus the number who have both. So:\n\nNumber with cats or dogs = C + D - Both\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber with cats or dogs = 35 + 25 - 15 = 45\n\nSo, 45 people have either a cat or a dog or both.\n\nNow, to find the number of people who don't have either, I subtract this number from the total number of people:\n\nNeither = Total - Number with cats or dogs = 50 - 45 = 5\n\nTherefore, 5 people don't have either a cat or a dog.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Let's try using a Venn diagram approach.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents cat owners, and the other represents dog owners.\n\n- The cat circle has 35 people.\n\n- The dog circle has 25 people.\n\n- The overlap, where both circles intersect, has 15 people who have both a cat and a dog.\n\nSo, the number of people who only have a cat is C - Both = 35 - 15 = 20.\n\nThe number of people who only have a dog is D - Both = 25 - 15 = 10.\n\nThen, the total number of people who have at least one pet (either only a cat, only a dog, or both) is:\n\nOnly cats + Only dogs + Both = 20 + 10 + 15 = 45\n\nAgain, subtracting this from the total number of people gives:\n\nNeither = Total - (Only cats + Only dogs + Both) = 50 - 45 = 5\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, it seems consistent.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using probabilities or some other formula. Well, since we're dealing with counts of people in different categories, the inclusion-exclusion principle seems appropriately applied here.\n\nLet me consider if there's any chance that some people might have other pets, but the problem specifically talks about cat and dog owners, so I think we can assume that any pet ownership is limited to cats and dogs in this context.\n\nAlso, the problem states that 15 people have both a cat and a dog, which directly gives us the overlap between the two groups.\n\nSo, I think the approach is solid, and the answer should be 5 people who don't have either a cat or a dog.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of people having multiple pets beyond one cat and one dog. But the problem doesn't specify anything about multiple pets beyond having both a cat and a dog, so I think it's safe to assume that \"have a cat\" and \"have a dog\" include all instances of pet ownership for those types.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 5 people without any pets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
