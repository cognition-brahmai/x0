        "content": "So there are 120 students in Grade 9 and 150 in Grade 10, and the school wants to make sure each class has the same number of students, no matter the grade. We need to find out the maximum number of students that can be in one class for this to work.\n\nFirst, I think we need to find a number that can divide both 120 and 150 evenly. That way, each class will have the same number of students, and there won't be any students left out.\n\nI recall that the greatest common divisor, or GCD, is the largest number that can divide two or more numbers without leaving a remainder. So, maybe finding the GCD of 120 and 150 will give us the maximum number of students per class.\n\nLet me try to find the GCD of 120 and 150.\n\nOne way to find the GCD is to list all the divisors of each number and find the largest one that they have in common.\n\nFirst, list the divisors of 120:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.\n\nNow, list the divisors of 150:\n\n1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150.\n\nNow, find the common divisors:\n\n1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.\n\nThe largest common divisor is 30.\n\nSo, the GCD of 120 and 150 is 30.\n\nDoes that mean the maximum number of students per class is 30?\n\nLet me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf each class has 30 students, then for Grade 9 with 120 students, there would be 120 divided by 30, which is 4 classes.\n\nFor Grade 10 with 150 students, there would be 150 divided by 30, which is 5 classes.\n\nThat seems to work, and 30 is the largest number that can divide both 120 and 150 without leaving any students out.\n\nIs there another way to confirm this?\n\nMaybe I can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then repeating the process with the remainder until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\nSo, 150 divided by 120 is 1 with a remainder of 30.\n\nThen, 120 divided by 30 is 4 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSo, the GCD is 30, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could look at the prime factorization of both numbers and find the product of the common prime factors with the lowest exponents.\n\nThe prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^1.\n\nThe prime factorization of 150 is 2^1 * 3^1 * 5^2.\n\nThe common prime factors are 2, 3, and 5.\n\nTaking the lowest exponents, that's 2^1, 3^1, and 5^1.\n\nSo, 2 * 3 * 5 = 30.\n\nAgain, the GCD is 30.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students per class is 30.\n\nWait a minute, but let's think about it differently.\n\nSuppose we want to have the same number of students in each class, but maybe we can have different grades in the same class.\n\nBut the question says \"each class has the same number of students,\" but it doesn't specify that classes have to be single-grade classes.\n\nIf classes can have students from both grades, then maybe we can have larger class sizes.\n\nFor example, if we mix students from both grades, what's the maximum class size?\n\nWell, the total number of students is 120 + 150 = 270.\n\nNow, if we want to divide 270 students into classes of equal size, the class size would be a divisor of 270.\n\nBut the question is to have an equal number of students in each class, and it seems to imply that within each grade, the students are divided into classes of the same size.\n\nBut perhaps the classes can have students from both grades.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased, it's about creating an equal number of students in each class, regardless of grade.\n\nSo, maybe the classes can have a mix of grades.\n\nIn that case, the maximum class size would be the GCD of 120 and 150, which is 30, as I previously found.\n\nBut let's consider another approach.\n\nSuppose we want to have classes that have, say, 60 students each.\n\nBut 120 divided by 60 is 2 classes for Grade 9, and 150 divided by 60 is 2.5 classes for Grade 10.\n\nBut we can't have half a class, so that's not possible.\n\nWhat about 45 students per class?\n\n120 divided by 45 is approximately 2.666, which again is not a whole number.\n\nWait, but 120 divided by 45 is 2.666, which means we can't have classes of 45 students each because it doesn't divide evenly.\n\nSo, again, 30 seems to be the largest number that divides both 120 and 150 evenly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to have larger classes if we allow classes to have different numbers of students from each grade.\n\nBut the question seems to imply that all classes should have the same number of students in total.\n\nGiven that, I think the GCD approach is the correct one.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students per class is 30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
