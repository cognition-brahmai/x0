        "content": "So I've got this algebra problem to solve: 3x + 5 = 17. I need to find out what x is. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the goal is to isolate x on one side of the equation. That means I need to get rid of the 5 and the 3 that are being added to and multiplied by x, respectively.\n\nLet me start by dealing with the addition. I have +5 on the left side, so to cancel that out, I should subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. That way, the equation stays balanced.\n\nSo, if I subtract 5 from both sides:\n\n3x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5\n\nThe +5 and -5 on the left side cancel out, leaving me with:\n\n3x = 12\n\nNow, I have 3x = 12. I need to get x by itself, so I need to divide both sides by 3.\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\n3x / 3 = 12 / 3\n\nThe 3's on the left side cancel out, giving me:\n\nx = 4\n\nAlright, so x equals 4. But let me check if that's correct by plugging it back into the original equation.\n\nOriginal equation: 3x + 5 = 17\n\nSubstitute x = 4:\n\n3*(4) + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17\n\nYes, that matches the right side of the equation. So, x = 4 is the correct solution.\n\nI think that's it. If there's anything else I need to consider, please let me know.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{x=4} \\]"
