        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular room. The length is 18 feet and the width is 14 feet. I need to find two things: the area of the room in square feet and the length of the diagonal.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the area. I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, area equals length times width. Plugging in the numbers, that's 18 feet times 14 feet. Let me do the multiplication:\n\n18 \u00d7 14.\n\nI can break this down to make it easier. 18 \u00d7 10 is 180, and 18 \u00d7 4 is 72. Adding those together, 180 + 72 equals 252. So, the area is 252 square feet.\n\nNow, for the diagonal. I remember that in a rectangle, the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem because the diagonal forms a right triangle with the length and the width. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (which is the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nSo, diagonal squared equals length squared plus width squared. That is, diagonal = sqrt(length\u00b2 + width\u00b2).\n\nPlugging in the values, diagonal = sqrt(18\u00b2 + 14\u00b2).\n\nFirst, calculate 18 squared and 14 squared.\n\n18\u00b2 is 324, and 14\u00b2 is 196.\n\nNow, add those together: 324 + 196 equals 520.\n\nSo, diagonal = sqrt(520).\n\nLet me see if I can simplify that. 520 can be factored into 4 times 130, and since 4 is a perfect square, I can take it out of the square root.\n\nSqrt(520) = sqrt(4 \u00d7 130) = sqrt(4) \u00d7 sqrt(130) = 2 \u00d7 sqrt(130).\n\nAlternatively, I can leave it as sqrt(520), but 2 times sqrt(130) might be considered simpler.\n\nBut maybe I can simplify it further. Let's see: 130 can be factored into 10 times 13, and 10 can be factored into 2 times 5. None of these are perfect squares, so 2 times sqrt(130) is as simplified as it gets.\n\nAlternatively, if a decimal approximation is needed, I can calculate sqrt(520).\n\nLet me see, what's the square root of 520?\n\nI know that 22 squared is 484, and 23 squared is 529. So, sqrt(520) is going to be a bit less than 23.\n\nLet me try 22.8 squared.\n\n22.8 squared is 22.8 \u00d7 22.8.\n\n20 \u00d7 20 is 400, 20 \u00d7 2.8 is 56, so 400 + 56 is 456, plus 2.8 \u00d7 2.8 which is 7.84, so total is 456 + 7.84 = 463.84. That's less than 520.\n\nLet me try 22.9 squared.\n\n22.9 \u00d7 22.9.\n\n20 \u00d7 20 is 400, 20 \u00d7 2.9 is 58, so 400 + 58 is 458, plus 2.9 \u00d7 2.9 which is 8.41, so total is 458 + 8.41 = 466.41. Still less than 520.\n\n23 squared is 529, which is higher than 520.\n\nSo, sqrt(520) is between 22.8 and 23.\n\nMaybe I can try 22.85 squared.\n\n22.85 \u00d7 22.85.\n\n20 \u00d7 20 is 400, 20 \u00d7 2.85 is 57, so 400 + 57 is 457, plus 2.85 \u00d7 2.85.\n\n2.85 squared is 8.1225.\n\nSo, 457 + 8.1225 = 465.1225. Still less than 520.\n\nHmm, this is taking too long. Maybe I should use a calculator for a more precise value.\n\nAssuming I have a calculator, sqrt(520) is approximately 22.8035 feet.\n\nBut since the original measurements were given in whole numbers, maybe it's acceptable to leave it as 2 times sqrt(130) feet.\n\nAlternatively, I can round the decimal to two decimal places, which would be about 22.80 feet.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Area: 252 square feet\n\n- Diagonal: approximately 22.80 feet or exactly 2 times sqrt(130) feet.\n\nI think that covers both parts of the question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe area of the room is \\(\\boxed{252}\\) square feet, and the length of the diagonal is approximately \\(\\boxed{22.80}\\) feet."
