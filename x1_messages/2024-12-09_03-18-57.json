        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 3 red balls, 4 blue balls, and 5 green balls. So, in total, there are 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 balls in the bag. I need to find the probability of drawing either a red or a blue ball at random.\n\nFirst, I recall that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are drawing either a red or a blue ball.\n\nSo, the number of red balls is 3, and the number of blue balls is 4. Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 3 (red) + 4 (blue) = 7.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls, which is 12.\n\nTherefore, the probability P of drawing either a red or a blue ball is P = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 7/12.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using the addition rule of probability. The addition rule states that the probability of event A or event B occurring is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). In this case, event A is drawing a red ball, and event B is drawing a blue ball. Since a ball can't be both red and blue at the same time, P(A and B) is 0.\n\nSo, P(red or blue) = P(red) + P(blue) - P(red and blue) = (3/12) + (4/12) - 0 = 7/12.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier. Good, it's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of not drawing a green ball, since the only other options are red and blue.\n\nThe number of green balls is 5, so the probability of drawing a green ball is 5/12.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not drawing a green ball is 1 - 5/12 = 7/12.\n\nAgain, this matches my previous calculations.\n\nIt seems like no matter which way I approach it, I end up with 7/12 as the probability of drawing either a red or a blue ball.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's double-check the total number of balls. 3 red + 4 blue + 5 green = 12 balls. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nAnd the number of favorable outcomes is 3 red + 4 blue = 7.\n\nSo, yes, 7 favorable outcomes out of 12 total outcomes gives a probability of 7/12.\n\nI think that's the answer. But maybe I should consider if the balls are being drawn with or without replacement. Oh, wait, the problem says \"draw one ball at random,\" so it's just a single draw. So, no need to worry about replacement.\n\nAlso, assuming that each ball is equally likely to be drawn, which is a standard assumption in such problems unless otherwise stated.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability of drawing either a red or a blue ball is 7/12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{12}} \\]"
