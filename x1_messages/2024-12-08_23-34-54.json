        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! To create a Java program that reads a text file line by line and prints out the lines containing a specified keyword, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import necessary libraries**: You'll need to import classes for file handling and reading lines from a file.\n\n2. **Define the main class and method**: This is where your program starts execution.\n\n3. **Handle file input**: Use a `BufferedReader` to read the file line by line.\n\n4. **Search for the keyword**: Check each line to see if it contains the specified keyword.\n\n5. **Print matching lines**: Output the lines that contain the keyword.\n\nHere's a sample code that demonstrates this:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class KeywordSearch {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Specify the path to your text file\n        String filePath = \"path/to/your/textfile.txt\";\n        \n        // Specify the keyword to search for\n        String keyword = \"your_keyword\";\n        \n        // Call the method to search for the keyword in the file\n        searchKeywordInFile(filePath, keyword);\n    }\n    \n    public static void searchKeywordInFile(String filePath, String keyword) {\n        // Try-with-resources to ensure the reader is closed after use\n        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {\n            String line;\n            // Read the file line by line\n            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n                // Check if the line contains the keyword\n                if (line.contains(keyword)) {\n                    // Print the line if it contains the keyword\n                    System.out.println(line);\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            // Handle possible I/O errors\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Importing Libraries**:\n   - `java.io.BufferedReader`: For efficient reading of characters from a character-input stream.\n   - `java.io.FileReader`: Reads characters from a file.\n   - `java.io.IOException`: To handle I/O errors.\n\n2. **Main Class and Method**:\n   - `KeywordSearch` is the main class.\n   - `main` method is the entry point of the program.\n\n3. **File Handling**:\n   - `BufferedReader` is used with `FileReader` to read the file efficiently.\n   - `try-with-resources` ensures that the `BufferedReader` is closed automatically after use, even if an exception occurs.\n\n4. **Searching for Keyword**:\n   - The `readLine` method reads the file line by line.\n   - The `contains` method checks if the line contains the specified keyword.\n   - If a match is found, the line is printed.\n\n5. **Error Handling**:\n   - `IOException` is caught and handled to manage any issues that occur during file reading.\n\nMake sure to replace `\"path/to/your/textfile.txt\"` with the actual path to your text file and `\"your_keyword\"` with the keyword you want to search for.\n\nThis should get you started with reading a file and searching for a keyword in Java!
