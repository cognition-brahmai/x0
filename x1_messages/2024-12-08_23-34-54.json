        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this construction cost calculation step by step. So, we've got a residential complex with 100 apartments, spread across five buildings. Each apartment is on average 1,500 square feet, and the construction cost is $150 per square foot. Additionally, there's a need to allocate 10% of the total land area for parking spaces, with each space costing $5,000. We need to find the total construction cost, including the parking spaces.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total construction cost for the apartments. To do that, I'll multiply the number of apartments by the average size per apartment and then by the construction cost per square foot.\n\nSo, total construction cost for apartments = number of apartments \u00d7 average size per apartment \u00d7 construction cost per square foot.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 100 apartments \u00d7 1,500 sq ft/apartment \u00d7 $150/sq ft.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n100 \u00d7 1,500 = 150,000 sq ft.\n\nNow, 150,000 sq ft \u00d7 $150/sq ft = $22,500,000.\n\nSo, the construction cost for the apartments is $22,500,000.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost for the parking spaces. The problem says to allocate 10% of the total land area for parking spaces, and each space costs $5,000. However, it doesn't specify the total land area or the number of parking spaces required.\n\nWait a minute, I think there might be a missing piece here. Do I have enough information to determine the number of parking spaces?\n\nLet me see. The problem mentions that the company needs to allocate 10% of the total land area for parking spaces, but it doesn't say how many parking spaces that corresponds to or what the land area per parking space is.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe I need to make an assumption here or find another way to approach this.\n\nPerhaps the 10% of the land area is directly related to the number of parking spaces needed. Maybe each parking space requires a certain area, and the total area for parking is 10% of the total land area.\n\nBut without knowing either the total land area or the number of parking spaces, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, maybe the number of parking spaces is based on the number of apartments. It's common for residential complexes to have one parking space per apartment or some ratio like that.\n\nLet me check if that's a reasonable assumption. If each apartment comes with one parking space, then there would be 100 parking spaces for 100 apartments.\n\nThat seems plausible. Many residential complexes allocate one parking space per apartment.\n\nIf that's the case, then the cost for parking spaces would be 100 spaces \u00d7 $5,000/space = $500,000.\n\nBut I need to confirm if this assumption is reasonable. The problem says to allocate 10% of the total land area for parking spaces, which costs $5,000 per space.\n\nMaybe the 10% land area is used to determine how many parking spaces can be accommodated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cost of $5,000 per space includes the cost of the land area required for each space.\n\nBut without more information, I'll proceed with the assumption that there are 100 parking spaces, one for each apartment.\n\nTherefore, the cost for parking spaces is 100 \u00d7 $5,000 = $500,000.\n\nNow, to find the total construction cost, I'll add the construction cost of the apartments and the cost of the parking spaces.\n\nTotal construction cost = construction cost for apartments + cost for parking spaces.\n\nSo, $22,500,000 + $500,000 = $23,000,000.\n\nTherefore, the total construction cost for the residential complex, including parking spaces, is $23,000,000.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there are any other costs involved. The problem mentions that 10% of the total land area is allocated for parking spaces, but it doesn't specify if the land cost is already included in the construction cost or if it's an additional cost.\n\nLooking back, the construction cost is given per square foot of apartment space, but it doesn't mention whether the land cost is included in that or if it's separate.\n\nTo be thorough, I should consider whether the $150 per square foot includes land cost or not.\n\nIf the $150 per square foot includes land cost, then adding the parking cost separately might be sufficient.\n\nHowever, if the $150 per square foot only covers the construction cost and not the land cost, then I might need to account for the land cost separately.\n\nBut based on the information provided, it's not clear.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the assumption that the $150 per square foot includes the land cost for the apartment areas, and the parking spaces have an additional cost of $5,000 per space.\n\nTherefore, the total construction cost is $23,000,000.\n\nAlternatively, if the $150 per square foot includes land cost for the entire project, including parking, then perhaps the parking cost is already factored in, and adding $5,000 per space would be redundant.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider the total land area.\n\nSuppose the total land area is L.\n\nThen, 10% of L is allocated for parking, which is 0.1L.\n\nThe remaining 90% of L is for the apartments.\n\nNow, the total area for apartments is 100 apartments \u00d7 1,500 sq ft = 150,000 sq ft.\n\nSo, 0.9L = 150,000 sq ft.\n\nFrom this, L = 150,000 / 0.9 = 166,666.67 sq ft.\n\nTherefore, the parking area is 0.1L = 16,666.67 sq ft.\n\nNow, if each parking space requires a certain area, say A sq ft per space, then the number of parking spaces is 16,666.67 / A.\n\nBut the problem states that the cost per parking space is $5,000, but it doesn't specify the area per parking space.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $5,000 per space includes the cost of the land area required for each space.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the total cost for parking is number of spaces \u00d7 $5,000.\n\nBut without knowing the number of spaces, I'm still stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I can calculate the number of parking spaces based on the parking area and the area required per space.\n\nAssuming each parking space requires, say, 200 sq ft (this is an assumption; actual sizes may vary), then the number of spaces is 16,666.67 / 200 \u2248 83.33 spaces.\n\nBut since we can't have a fraction of a parking space, let's round down to 83 spaces.\n\nThen, the cost for parking would be 83 \u00d7 $5,000 = $415,000.\n\nBut this is based on the assumption that each parking space requires 200 sq ft, which may not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parking area is designed to accommodate a certain number of spaces based on standard parking space sizes.\n\nWithout specific information on the area per parking space, it's hard to proceed accurately.\n\nGiven that, maybe it's better to stick with the initial assumption of one parking space per apartment, totaling 100 spaces, costing $500,000.\n\nTherefore, the total construction cost would be $22,500,000 (apartments) + $500,000 (parking) = $23,000,000.\n\nAlternatively, if the parking spaces are based on the 10% land area, and each space requires a specific area, then the number of spaces would be determined by that area.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the area per parking space, I'll go with the first approach.\n\nSo, my final answer is $23,000,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{23000000} \\]"
