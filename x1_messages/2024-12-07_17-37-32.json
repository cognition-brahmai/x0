        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A factory produces 500 units per day, and each unit is inspected by three different inspectors. Each inspector finds defects in 5% of the units they inspect. I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen unit will have no defects found by any of the inspectors.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what's going on with the inspectors and the defect rates.\n\nEach inspector independently inspects each unit and has a 5% chance of finding a defect in any given unit. That means each inspector has a 95% chance of finding no defect in a unit.\n\nNow, since there are three inspectors, and they all inspect each unit independently, I need to find the probability that all three inspectors find no defect in a particular unit.\n\nSince the inspectors are independent, I can multiply their individual probabilities of finding no defect to get the overall probability that none of them find a defect.\n\nSo, the probability that one inspector finds no defect is 95%, or 0.95.\n\nTherefore, the probability that all three inspectors find no defect is 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025\n\nThen, 0.9025 * 0.95 = 0.857375\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen unit will have no defects found by any of the inspectors is approximately 0.8574, or 85.74%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my reasoning.\n\nEach inspector has a 5% defect rate, meaning each has a 95% chance of passing a unit as defect-free.\n\nSince the inspectors are independent, the probability that all three pass the unit (i.e., none find a defect) is indeed the product of their individual probabilities of passing the unit.\n\nSo, yes, 0.95^3 = 0.857375.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of complementary probabilities. The probability that at least one inspector finds a defect would be 1 minus the probability that none find a defect.\n\nBut the question asks for the probability that no defects are found by any inspector, which is what I calculated above.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using binomial probabilities?\n\nWell, since each inspector can be seen as a Bernoulli trial with success (no defect) probability of 0.95, and there are three independent inspectors, this is indeed a binomial situation.\n\nThe probability of all three inspectors succeeding (i.e., finding no defect) is simply 0.95^3, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the probability that at least one inspector finds a defect, it would be 1 - 0.95^3, which is approximately 0.1426, or 14.26%.\n\nBut again, the question is specifically asking for the probability that no defects are found by any of the inspectors, so 0.8574 seems correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might be missing. The fact that there are 500 units produced per day doesn't seem relevant to the probability calculation for a single unit. It's probably just there to set the context.\n\nAlso, the inspectors are different and independent, so their inspections don't influence each other.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"each inspector finds defects in 5% of the units they inspect.\" Does this mean that each inspector has a 5% chance of finding a defect in any unit they inspect, regardless of whether there actually is a defect or not?\n\nIn other words, is the 5% defect rate a false positive rate, or is it the actual rate at which inspectors find defects, whether they're true defects or not?\n\nThis could be important because if the inspectors are finding defects that aren't really there, that would affect the overall probability.\n\nAlternatively, if the 5% represents the probability that an inspector misses a defect when there is one, that would be a different scenario.\n\nWait, the problem says \"finds defects in 5% of the units they inspect.\" So, it seems like it's the rate at which inspectors identify defects, regardless of whether there are actual defects or not.\n\nIn other words, for any given unit, an inspector has a 5% chance of flagging it as defective, regardless of its true status.\n\nAssuming that the inspectors' decisions are independent and that they each have this 5% chance of flagging a unit as defective, then my previous calculation should hold.\n\nBut let's think about it differently. Suppose a unit is actually non-defective, and the inspectors have a 5% chance of incorrectly identifying it as defective.\n\nIn that case, the probability that an inspector correctly identifies a non-defective unit as non-defective is 95%.\n\nThen, the probability that all three inspectors correctly identify a non-defective unit as non-defective is 0.95^3, which is what I calculated.\n\nHowever, if the unit is actually defective, and inspectors have a certain probability of detecting the defect, then the calculation would be different.\n\nBut the problem says \"each inspector finds defects in 5% of the units they inspect.\" This seems to suggest that regardless of whether the unit is actually defective or not, an inspector will flag it as defective 5% of the time.\n\nWait, that doesn't make complete sense because if a unit is actually defective, an inspector should have a higher probability of correctly identifying it as defective.\n\nMaybe the 5% represents the probability that an inspector fails to detect a defect when there is one.\n\nBut the problem says \"finds defects in 5% of the units they inspect,\" which sounds like they flag 5% of units as defective.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5% represents the probability that an inspector incorrectly identifies a non-defective unit as defective.\n\nIn that case, if a unit is non-defective, the probability of being flagged as defective by an inspector is 5%, and the probability of being correctly identified as non-defective is 95%.\n\nIf a unit is defective, perhaps the inspector always finds the defect, or has a certain probability of finding it.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the true defect rate of the units.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the safest assumption is that each inspector independently flags a unit as defective with a probability of 5%, regardless of its actual status.\n\nUnder this assumption, the probability that a unit is not flagged as defective by any inspector is indeed 0.95^3 \u2248 0.8574.\n\nAlternatively, if the 5% represents the probability that an inspector misses a defect when there is one, then the calculation would be different.\n\nBut based on the problem statement, it seems more straightforward to assume that each inspector has a 5% chance of flagging any unit as defective, regardless of its actual status.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a unit is not flagged as defective by any inspector is 0.95^3 \u2248 0.8574.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 85.74%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.8574} \\]"
