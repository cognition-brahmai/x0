        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to find out how many units of each product are produced in an 8-hour shift.\n\nThe factory produces 500 units of product A per hour. So in 8 hours, it would produce:\n\n500 units/hour * 8 hours = 4000 units of product A\n\nSimilarly, it produces 300 units of product B per hour, so in 8 hours:\n\n300 units/hour * 8 hours = 2400 units of product B\n\nNext, we need to calculate the storage space required for each type of product.\n\nEach unit of product A requires 2 square meters of storage space. Therefore, for 4000 units:\n\n4000 units * 2 m\u00b2/unit = 8000 m\u00b2\n\nEach unit of product B requires 3 square meters of storage space. Therefore, for 2400 units:\n\n2400 units * 3 m\u00b2/unit = 7200 m\u00b2\n\nFinally, to find the total storage space needed for all products produced in the 8-hour shift, we add the storage spaces for products A and B:\n\n8000 m\u00b2 + 7200 m\u00b2 = 15,200 m\u00b2\n\nSo, the factory needs 15,200 square meters of storage space for all the products produced in an 8-hour shift.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15200} \\]"
