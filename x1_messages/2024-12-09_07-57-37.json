        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here, and I need to find the probability that when I pick one ball from box A and one from box B, both balls are the same color. Box A has 8 red and 4 green balls, and box B has 5 red and 7 green balls.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for both balls to be the same color. That can happen in two ways: both balls are red or both balls are green. So, I think I need to calculate the probability of both balls being red and the probability of both being green, then add those probabilities together to get the total probability of both balls being the same color.\n\nLet me start by finding the probability that both balls are red. To find that, I need to multiply the probability of picking a red ball from box A by the probability of picking a red ball from box B.\n\nBox A has 8 red balls and a total of 8 + 4 = 12 balls. So, the probability of picking a red ball from box A is 8/12, which simplifies to 2/3.\n\nBox B has 5 red balls and a total of 5 + 7 = 12 balls. So, the probability of picking a red ball from box B is 5/12.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are red is (2/3) * (5/12). Let me calculate that:\n\n(2/3) * (5/12) = (2*5)/(3*12) = 10/36, which simplifies to 5/18.\n\nNow, let's find the probability that both balls are green.\n\nBox A has 4 green balls out of 12, so the probability of picking a green ball from box A is 4/12, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nBox B has 7 green balls out of 12, so the probability of picking a green ball from box B is 7/12.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are green is (1/3) * (7/12).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n(1/3) * (7/12) = 7/36.\n\nNow, to find the total probability that both balls are the same color, I add the probability of both being red and both being green:\n\n5/18 + 7/36.\n\nHmm, to add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 18 and 36 is 36. So, I'll convert 5/18 to a fraction with a denominator of 36.\n\n5/18 = (5*2)/(18*2) = 10/36.\n\nNow, 10/36 + 7/36 = 17/36.\n\nSo, the probability that both balls are the same color is 17/36.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the total number of ways to pick two balls of the same color and divide by the total number of ways to pick any two balls, one from each box.\n\nFirst, the total number of ways to pick one ball from box A and one from box B is 12 (from A) * 12 (from B) = 144 possible outcomes.\n\nNow, the number of ways to pick two red balls: 8 (red from A) * 5 (red from B) = 40.\n\nThe number of ways to pick two green balls: 4 (green from A) * 7 (green from B) = 28.\n\nSo, the total number of favorable outcomes is 40 + 28 = 68.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 68/144.\n\nLet me simplify that: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 4.\n\n68 \u00f7 4 = 17, and 144 \u00f7 4 = 36. So, 68/144 simplifies to 17/36.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. Good, it's consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the probabilities of each event separately and then combine them.\n\nProbability both red: (8/12)*(5/12) = 40/144.\n\nProbability both green: (4/12)*(7/12) = 28/144.\n\nTotal probability: 40/144 + 28/144 = 68/144 = 17/36.\n\nSame answer again. I think 17/36 is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can consider the probability that the balls are different colors and subtract that from 1.\n\nProbability that ball from A is red and ball from B is green: (8/12)*(7/12) = 56/144.\n\nProbability that ball from A is green and ball from B is red: (4/12)*(5/12) = 20/144.\n\nTotal probability of different colors: 56/144 + 20/144 = 76/144.\n\nSimplify 76/144: both divisible by 4, so 19/36.\n\nThen, probability of same color is 1 - 19/36 = 17/36.\n\nAgain, the same answer. This gives me more confidence that 17/36 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of conditional probability, but that might be more complicated for this problem since the draws are independent.\n\nWait, actually, since the draws are independent, the probability of both balls being the same color is indeed the sum of the probabilities of both being red and both being green, which is what I calculated earlier.\n\nI don't think there's any need to involve conditional probability here.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the joint probability distribution of the two independent events (drawing from A and drawing from B), but that's essentially what I did already.\n\nI think I've confirmed the answer sufficiently from multiple angles.\n\nSo, the final answer is 17/36.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{17}{36}} \\]"
