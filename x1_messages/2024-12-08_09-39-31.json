        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with different colored balls: 4 red, 3 blue, and 5 green. The question is, what's the probability of picking a blue ball at random from this bag?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember the basic formula for probability. Probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcome is picking a blue ball, and the total outcomes are all the balls in the bag.\n\nLet me figure out the total number of balls. There are 4 red, 3 blue, and 5 green. So, total balls = 4 + 3 + 5 = 12 balls.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. 4 plus 3 is 7, plus 5 is 12. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of blue balls, which is 3.\n\nSo, probability of picking a blue ball should be 3 (blue balls) divided by 12 (total balls). That simplifies to 1/4.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at this. Could there be any dependency or something else I'm missing? The problem says \"randomly picking a blue ball,\" and it seems like a straightforward single draw from the bag.\n\nI think that's it. The probability is 3/12, which simplifies to 1/4, or 0.25, or 25%.\n\nWait, but probabilities are often expressed as fractions, so 1/4 is fine.\n\nLet me see if there's another approach. Maybe using combinations? The number of ways to choose 1 blue ball from 3 blue balls is C(3,1), and the total number of ways to choose any ball from all 12 balls is C(12,1). So, probability = C(3,1)/C(12,1) = 3/12 = 1/4. Same answer.\n\nAlright, I think I'm confident with this.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}} \\]"
