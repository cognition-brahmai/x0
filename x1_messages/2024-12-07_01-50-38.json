        "content": "So I have this problem here: If a car burns 7 liters of fuel for every 100 kilometers, how much fuel will it burn after driving 350 kilometers? And I need to provide step-by-step logic for it.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The car burns 7 liters for every 100 kilometers. So, first, I need to find out how much fuel it burns per kilometer, and then multiply that by 350 kilometers.\n\nWait, actually, maybe there's a better way. Since it's 7 liters for every 100 kilometers, I can set up a proportion.\n\nLet me think about proportions. If 7 liters is to 100 kilometers, then x liters is to 350 kilometers. So, 7/100 = x/350.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, to find x, I can cross-multiply and solve for x.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n7 liters / 100 kilometers = x liters / 350 kilometers\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n7 * 350 = 100 * x\n\nSo, 2450 = 100x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 100 to solve for x:\n\nx = 2450 / 100\n\nx = 24.5 liters\n\nOkay, so the car will burn 24.5 liters after driving 350 kilometers.\n\nWait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using multiplication.\n\nSince 350 kilometers is 3.5 times 100 kilometers (because 350 divided by 100 is 3.5), then the fuel burned should be 3.5 times the fuel burned for 100 kilometers.\n\nSo, 3.5 * 7 liters = 24.5 liters.\n\nThat matches what I got from the proportion method.\n\nLet me check again. 3.5 times 7 is indeed 24.5.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of fuel consumption rate.\n\nThe car burns 7 liters per 100 kilometers, which is a consumption rate of 7/100 liters per kilometer.\n\nSo, 7/100 = 0.07 liters per kilometer.\n\nThen, for 350 kilometers, the fuel burned would be 0.07 * 350 = 24.5 liters.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I end up with 24.5 liters.\n\nTherefore, the car will burn 24.5 liters of fuel after driving 350 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24.5} \\]"
