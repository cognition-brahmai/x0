        "content": "So I've got this problem here about bacteria population growth. It says that the population doubles every 3 hours and starts with 500 bacteria. I need to find out how many there will be after 24 hours. Hmm, growth problems usually involve exponential functions, right?\n\nFirst, I should recall the general formula for exponential growth. I think it's something like \\(N = N_0 \\times 2^{(t/T)}\\), where:\n\n- \\(N\\) is the final population size,\n\n- \\(N_0\\) is the initial population size,\n\n- \\(t\\) is the time elapsed,\n\n- \\(T\\) is the doubling time.\n\nIn this case, \\(N_0\\) is 500, \\(T\\) is 3 hours, and \\(t\\) is 24 hours. So plugging these values into the formula should give me the answer.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n\\(N = 500 \\times 2^{(24/3)}\\)\n\nSimplifying the exponent:\n\n\\(24\\) divided by \\(3\\) is \\(8\\), so:\n\n\\(N = 500 \\times 2^8\\)\n\nNow, \\(2^8\\) is \\(256\\), so:\n\n\\(N = 500 \\times 256\\)\n\nMultiplying that out:\n\n\\(500 \\times 256 = 128,000\\)\n\nSo, after 24 hours, there should be 128,000 bacteria.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. Starting with 500 bacteria, doubling every 3 hours:\n\n- After 3 hours: 500 \u00d7 2 = 1,000\n\n- After 6 hours: 1,000 \u00d7 2 = 2,000\n\n- After 9 hours: 2,000 \u00d7 2 = 4,000\n\n- After 12 hours: 4,000 \u00d7 2 = 8,000\n\n- After 15 hours: 8,000 \u00d7 2 = 16,000\n\n- After 18 hours: 16,000 \u00d7 2 = 32,000\n\n- After 21 hours: 32,000 \u00d7 2 = 64,000\n\n- After 24 hours: 64,000 \u00d7 2 = 128,000\n\nOkay, that matches the calculation. So, 128,000 bacteria after 24 hours.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using the continuous growth formula, like \\(N = N_0 e^{kt}\\)? Let's try that.\n\nFirst, I need to find the growth rate \\(k\\). I know that the population doubles every 3 hours, so:\n\n\\(2N_0 = N_0 e^{k \\times 3}\\)\n\nDividing both sides by \\(N_0\\):\n\n\\(2 = e^{3k}\\)\n\nTaking natural logarithm on both sides:\n\n\\(\\ln(2) = 3k\\)\n\nSo, \\(k = \\ln(2)/3\\)\n\nNow, plugging into the exponential growth formula for \\(t = 24\\) hours:\n\n\\(N = 500 \\times e^{(\\ln(2)/3) \\times 24}\\)\n\nSimplifying the exponent:\n\n\\((\\ln(2)/3) \\times 24 = 8 \\ln(2)\\)\n\nSo, \\(N = 500 \\times e^{8 \\ln(2)}\\)\n\nBut \\(e^{\\ln(2^8)} = 2^8 = 256\\), so:\n\n\\(N = 500 \\times 256 = 128,000\\)\n\nAgain, the same answer. Good, that reinforces the first method.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using the rule of 70 or something like that, but I don't think it's applicable here. The doubling time is 3 hours, and we're dealing with a precise calculation over a specific period.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the growth is really exponential over 24 hours. In real life, bacterial growth might slow down due to resource limitations or other factors, but according to the problem, it's doubling every 3 hours, so we can assume exponential growth for this scenario.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The doubling time is in hours, and the total time is in hours, so that's fine.\n\nOne more thing: is there a possibility that the population doesn't double exactly every 3 hours, but rather on a continuous basis? Well, the problem specifies \"doubles every 3 hours,\" which is a discrete doubling, so the first method is appropriate. But the second method, using the continuous growth formula, also gave the same result, which is consistent.\n\nI think I've confirmed the answer sufficiently. The population will be 128,000 bacteria after 24 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{128000} \\]"
