        "content": "That phrase is from William Shakespeare's famous play \"Romeo and Juliet.\" It's spoken by Juliet in Act 2, Scene 2, often referred to as the \"balcony scene.\" In this scene, Romeo and Juliet have just discovered each other's identities and realize that their love is forbidden because their families are enemies. As dawn approaches and they must part, Juliet says, \"Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I shall say good night till it be morrow.\" It's a poignant moment that captures the bittersweet nature of their love and the pain of their separation."
