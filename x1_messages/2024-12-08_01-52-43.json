        "content": "I'm here to help you with your question. Let's see, in 2020, there was a Democratic National Convention, and you're asking about the singer of \"All of Me\" who performed there and was also a coach on The Voice at that time.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who sang \"All of Me.\" I believe it's John Legend. Yes, John Legend is known for his song \"All of Me.\" Now, was he involved in The Voice at that time?\n\nI think John Legend was a coach on The Voice. I remember seeing him as one of the mentors on the show. So, if he performed at the Democratic National Convention in 2020 and was also a coach on The Voice, that would make sense.\n\nLet me double-check the year. The Democratic National Convention in 2020 was a bit unusual because of the pandemic; it was mostly virtual, right? I think John Legend did perform at that convention. I recall seeing performances by various artists during that time.\n\nAlso, The Voice was still airing in 2020, and John Legend was indeed one of the coaches on the show. So, it seems plausible that he maintained his role as a coach while also performing at the DNC.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about this?"
