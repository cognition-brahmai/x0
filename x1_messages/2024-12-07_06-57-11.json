The customer buys 10 pieces of the first type and 15 pieces of the second type. I need to find out how much they spend in total.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how much they spend on each type separately and then add those amounts together.\n\nSo, for the first type:\n\nThey buy 10 pieces at $2 each. So, 10 times 2 is 20. So, $20 for the first type.\n\nNext, for the second type:\n\nThey buy 15 pieces at $3 each. So, 15 times 3 is 45. So, $45 for the second type.\n\nNow, I add those two amounts together: 20 plus 45 is 65.\n\nTherefore, the total amount spent on candies is $65.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{65} \\]"
