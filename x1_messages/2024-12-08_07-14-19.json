They must be able to explain complex concepts in a clear and concise manner, adapting their teaching methods to suit different learning styles.\n\n3. **Patience:** Teaching can be challenging, especially when dealing with students who have varying levels of understanding and abilities. Patience allows teachers to remain calm and supportive, even in difficult situations.\n\n4. **Empathy:** Understanding and relating to students' emotions and perspectives helps teachers create a nurturing and inclusive learning environment.
