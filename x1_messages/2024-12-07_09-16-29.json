        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company with 120 employees in total, and these employees are divided into full-time and part-time workers. It's given that full-time workers make up 60% of the workforce. That means the remaining 40% are part-time workers, right?\n\nFirst, let's find out how many full-time workers there are. Since full-time workers are 60% of 120 employees:\n\nFull-time workers = 60% of 120 = 0.60 \u00d7 120 = 72 employees\n\nNow, to find the number of part-time workers, we subtract the full-time workers from the total employees:\n\nPart-time workers = Total employees - Full-time workers = 120 - 72 = 48 employees\n\nSo, there are 48 part-time workers.\n\nThe problem also states that there are twice as many female part-time workers as male part-time workers. Let's denote the number of male part-time workers as M and the number of female part-time workers as F.\n\nAccording to the given information:\n\nF = 2M\n\nAnd since the total number of part-time workers is 48:\n\nM + F = 48\n\nNow, we can substitute F from the first equation into the second equation:\n\nM + 2M = 48\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n3M = 48\n\nNow, solving for M:\n\nM = 48 / 3 = 16\n\nSo, there are 16 male part-time workers.\n\nTo double-check, if M = 16, then F = 2 \u00d7 16 = 32. Adding them up: 16 + 32 = 48, which matches the total number of part-time workers. Also, the full-time workers are 72, which is 60% of 120, and the part-time are 48, which is 40%, so that adds up correctly.\n\nTherefore, the company has 16 male part-time workers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
