        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to find out how many units the factory produces in 10 days. Since they produce 500 units every day, in 10 days they would produce:\n\n500 units/day * 10 days = 5,000 units\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total production cost for these 5,000 units. The production cost per unit is $20, so:\n\n5,000 units * $20/unit = $100,000\n\nNow, let's find out how much revenue they generate from selling all these units. They sell each unit for $35, so:\n\n5,000 units * $35/unit = $175,000\n\nTo find the profit, we subtract the total production cost from the total revenue:\n\n$175,000 - $100,000 = $75,000\n\nSo, the factory's profit after selling all the products produced in 10 days is $75,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75000} \\]"
