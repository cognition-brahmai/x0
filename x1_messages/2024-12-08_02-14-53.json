I'll walk you through a simple and efficient method using the built-in `sort` function.\n\nFirst, let's understand what sorting means. Sorting an array involves arranging its elements in a specific order, which could be either ascending (smallest to largest) or descending (largest to smallest). In your case, you want to sort the array in ascending order.\n\nJavaScript's array object has a method called `sort()`, which can be used to sort the elements of an array. However, by default, the `sort()` function converts the elements into strings and compares their sequences of UTF-16 code units, which may not give the expected results for numbers. For example, if you have an array `[10, 2, 20, 3]`, sorting it with just `sort()` would result in `[10, 2, 20, 3]` because '10' comes before '2' in string comparison.\n\nTo sort numbers correctly, you need to provide a comparison function to the `sort()` method. This function defines how two elements should be compared. For numerical sorting in ascending order, you can subtract the second number from the first. Here's how it works:\n\n- If the result is less than zero, the first number comes before the second.\n\n- If the result is zero, they are equal.\n\n- If the result is greater than zero, the first number comes after the second.\n\nSo, the comparison function for ascending order would look like this:\n\n```javascript\nfunction compareNumbers(a, b) {\n  return a - b;\n}\n```\n\nNow, you can use this function as the argument to the `sort()` method. Here's a complete example:\n\n```javascript\nfunction sortAscending(numArray) {\n  return numArray.sort(function(a, b) {\n    return a - b;\n  });\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nvar numbers = [5, 3, 9, 1, 11];\nvar sortedNumbers = sortAscending(numbers);\nconsole.log(sortedNumbers); // Output: [1, 3, 5, 9, 11]\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `sortAscending` is a function that takes an array of numbers as input.\n\n- It uses the `sort()` method with a comparison function that subtracts `b` from `a`.\n\n- This ensures that the array is sorted in ascending order.\n\n- The sorted array is then returned.\n\nYou can also use an arrow function for a more concise version:\n\n```javascript\nfunction sortAscending(numArray) {\n  return numArray.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nvar numbers = [5, 3, 9, 1, 11];\nvar sortedNumbers = sortAscending(numbers);\nconsole.log(sortedNumbers); // Output: [1, 3, 5, 9, 11]\n```\n\nThis achieves the same result but with less code.\n\nIt's important to note that the `sort()` method sorts the array in place, meaning it modifies the original array. If you want to preserve the original array, you should create a copy before sorting:\n\n```javascript\nfunction sortAscending(numArray) {\n  var copy = numArray.slice(); // Create a copy of the array\n  return copy.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nvar numbers = [5, 3, 9, 1, 11];\nvar sortedNumbers = sortAscending(numbers);\nconsole.log(sortedNumbers); // Output: [1, 3, 5, 9, 11]\nconsole.log(numbers); // Original array remains unchanged: [5, 3, 9, 1, 11]\n```\n\nIn this version, `slice()` is used to create a shallow copy of the array, ensuring the original array is not modified.\n\nAlternatively, if you're using modern JavaScript (ES6 and above), you can use the spread operator to create a copy:\n\n```javascript\nfunction sortAscending(numArray) {\n  return [...numArray].sort((a, b) => a - b);\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nvar numbers = [5, 3, 9, 1, 11];\nvar sortedNumbers = sortAscending(numbers);\nconsole.log(sortedNumbers); // Output: [1, 3, 5, 9, 11]\nconsole.log(numbers); // Original array remains unchanged: [5, 3, 9, 1, 11]\n```\n\nThis is another clean way to ensure the original array isn't altered.\n\nIn summary, to sort an array of numbers in ascending order in JavaScript, use the `sort()` method with a comparison function that subtracts the second number from the first. This will ensure the numbers are sorted correctly rather than being treated as strings.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further explanation, feel free to ask!"
