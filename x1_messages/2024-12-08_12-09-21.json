        "content": "So I've got this sequence defined by the formula A_n = 3n - 4, and I need to find the sum of the first 20 terms. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what kind of sequence this is. The formula A_n = 3n - 4 looks linear, with n being the term number. So, it's probably an arithmetic sequence, where each term is obtained by adding a constant difference to the previous term.\n\nTo confirm, let's calculate the first few terms:\n\nFor n = 1: A_1 = 3(1) - 4 = 3 - 4 = -1\n\nFor n = 2: A_2 = 3(2) - 4 = 6 - 4 = 2\n\nFor n = 3: A_3 = 3(3) - 4 = 9 - 4 = 5\n\nFor n = 4: A_4 = 3(4) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8\n\nSo, the sequence starts with -1, 2, 5, 8, and so on. Looking at these terms, it seems like each term is 3 more than the previous one. That confirms it's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3.\n\nNow, to find the sum of the first 20 terms, I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The general formula is:\n\nS_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- S_n is the sum of the first n terms\n\n- n is the number of terms\n\n- a_1 is the first term\n\n- a_n is the nth term\n\nIn this case, n = 20, a_1 = -1, and a_20 can be found using the sequence formula A_n = 3n - 4.\n\nSo, a_20 = 3(20) - 4 = 60 - 4 = 56\n\nNow, plug these values into the sum formula:\n\nS_20 = 20/2 * (-1 + 56) = 10 * 55 = 550\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to verify this? Maybe using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series that uses the first term and the common difference:\n\nS_n = n/2 * (2a_1 + (n - 1)d)\n\nWhere:\n\n- d is the common difference\n\nIn this sequence, a_1 = -1, d = 3, n = 20\n\nPlugging in:\n\nS_20 = 20/2 * (2(-1) + (20 - 1)3) = 10 * (-2 + 57) = 10 * 55 = 550\n\nOkay, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. So, the sum of the first 20 terms is 550.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another approach. Maybe summing the sequence directly using the formula A_n = 3n - 4.\n\nThe sum S_n = sum from k=1 to n of (3k - 4)\n\nThis can be split into:\n\nS_n = 3 * sum from k=1 to n of k - sum from k=1 to n of 4\n\nSum of the first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2, and sum of a constant n times is 4n.\n\nSo,\n\nS_n = 3*(n(n+1)/2) - 4n\n\nPlugging in n = 20:\n\nS_20 = 3*(20*21/2) - 4*20 = 3*(210) - 80 = 630 - 80 = 550\n\nAgain, the same result. So, no matter which method I use, I end up with 550.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the sum of the first 20 terms of the sequence A_n = 3n - 4 is 550.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{550} \\]"
