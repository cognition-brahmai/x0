        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a town where 60% of the men are married to 80% of the women. We need to find out what percentage of the overall population is married. Okay, let's start by understanding what's being asked here.\n\nFirst, I need to clarify what the problem is saying. It says that 60% of the men are married to 80% of the women. So, in this town, some men are married to some women. But, importantly, marriage is between one man and one woman in this context, I assume.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let\u2019s say the total number of men in the town is M.\n\n- And the total number of women in the town is W.\n\n- So, the total population P is M + W.\n\nNow, 60% of the men are married. That means 0.6M men are married.\n\nSimilarly, 80% of the women are married, which means 0.8W women are married.\n\nBut wait a minute, in reality, each marriage involves one man and one woman. So, the number of married men should equal the number of married women, right? Because each marriage pairs one man with one woman.\n\nHmm, but according to the problem, 0.6M men are married and 0.8W women are married. For these numbers to be equal, we must have 0.6M = 0.8W.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n0.6M = 0.8W\n\nI can simplify this equation. Dividing both sides by 0.2, I get:\n\n3M = 4W\n\nOr, M/W = 4/3\n\nSo, the ratio of men to women in the town is 4:3.\n\nThat\u2019s interesting. So, for every 4 men, there are 3 women.\n\nNow, let's find the actual numbers of men and women.\n\nLet\u2019s assume there are 4x men and 3x women, where x is a positive integer.\n\nSo, M = 4x and W = 3x.\n\nTherefore, the total population P = M + W = 4x + 3x = 7x.\n\nNow, the number of married men is 60% of M, which is 0.6 * 4x = 2.4x.\n\nSimilarly, the number of married women is 80% of W, which is 0.8 * 3x = 2.4x.\n\nSo, the total number of married people is the sum of married men and married women, which is 2.4x + 2.4x = 4.8x.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the population that is married is (4.8x / 7x) * 100%.\n\nSimplifying that, we get (4.8 / 7) * 100%.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n4.8 divided by 7 is approximately 0.6857.\n\nMultiplying by 100 gives approximately 68.57%.\n\nSo, roughly 68.57% of the population is married.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from M = 4x and W = 3x, total population P = 7x.\n\nMarried men: 0.6 * 4x = 2.4x\n\nMarried women: 0.8 * 3x = 2.4x\n\nTotal married people: 2.4x + 2.4x = 4.8x\n\nPercentage married: (4.8x / 7x) * 100% = (4.8 / 7) * 100% \u2248 68.57%\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nLet's try another method.\n\nSuppose the total population is 100 people.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of men as m and the number of women as w.\n\nSo, m + w = 100.\n\nFrom earlier, we know that M/W = 4/3, so m/w = 4/3.\n\nTherefore, m = (4/3)w.\n\nSubstituting into the first equation:\n\n(4/3)w + w = 100\n\n(4/3)w + (3/3)w = 100\n\n(7/3)w = 100\n\nw = (3/7)*100 \u2248 42.86 women\n\nThen, m = 100 - 42.86 \u2248 57.14 men\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because m should be a multiple of 4 and w a multiple of 3 if we're using the ratio 4:3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have chosen a total population that is a multiple of 7, given that M/W = 4/3, and M + W = 7 parts.\n\nSo, let's choose a total population of 70 people, for easier calculation.\n\nThen, M = 40 men and W = 30 women.\n\nNow, 60% of men are married: 0.6 * 40 = 24 men\n\n80% of women are married: 0.8 * 30 = 24 women\n\nTotal married people: 24 + 24 = 48\n\nPercentage married: (48 / 70) * 100% \u2248 68.57%\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nLet me try one more approach to confirm.\n\nSuppose the number of married men equals the number of married women, which makes sense since each marriage connects one man and one woman.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of married couples as C.\n\nThen, the number of married men is C, and the number of married women is also C.\n\nGiven that 60% of men are married, so C = 0.6M\n\nSimilarly, C = 0.8W\n\nTherefore, 0.6M = 0.8W\n\nWhich brings us back to M/W = 4/3\n\nSo, the ratio is consistent.\n\nNow, the percentage of the population that is married is (2C / (M + W)) * 100%\n\nSince C = 0.6M = 0.8W\n\nAnd M/W = 4/3\n\nSo, M = (4/3)W\n\nSubstituting into C = 0.6M:\n\nC = 0.6 * (4/3)W = 0.8W\n\nWhich checks out.\n\nNow, the total married people are 2C.\n\nSo, the percentage is (2C / (M + W)) * 100%\n\nSubstituting M = (4/3)W and C = 0.8W:\n\n(2 * 0.8W) / ((4/3)W + W) * 100% = (1.6W) / ((7/3)W) * 100% = (1.6 / (7/3)) * 100% = (1.6 * 3/7) * 100% = (4.8 / 7) * 100% \u2248 68.57%\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that approximately 68.57% of the population is married.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{68.57\\%} \\]"
