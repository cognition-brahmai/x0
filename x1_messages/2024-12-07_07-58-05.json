        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a class of 60 students. According to the problem, 75% passed their math exam, and 80% passed their science exam. Additionally, everyone who passed math also passed science. We need to find out how many students failed both exams.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many students passed each exam.\n\nFor math:\n\n75% of 60 students passed math.\n\nSo, number of students who passed math = 75/100 * 60 = 45 students.\n\nFor science:\n\n80% of 60 students passed science.\n\nSo, number of students who passed science = 80/100 * 60 = 48 students.\n\nNow, the problem states that everyone who passed math also passed science. That means all 45 students who passed math are included in the 48 students who passed science.\n\nSo, the number of students who passed only science would be the total who passed science minus those who passed both (which is the same as those who passed math, since all who passed math also passed science).\n\nTherefore, students who passed only science = 48 - 45 = 3 students.\n\nNow, to find the number of students who failed both exams, we need to subtract the number of students who passed at least one exam from the total number of students.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of students who passed at least one exam.\n\nThis would be the sum of those who passed only science and those who passed both math and science.\n\nSo, students who passed at least one exam = students who passed only science + students who passed both.\n\nWe have 3 students who passed only science and 45 who passed both.\n\nTherefore, students who passed at least one exam = 3 + 45 = 48 students.\n\nNow, total students are 60.\n\nSo, students who failed both exams = total students - students who passed at least one exam = 60 - 48 = 12 students.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nTotal students = 60.\n\nPassed math = 45, and all these 45 also passed science.\n\nPassed only science = 48 (total passed science) - 45 (passed both) = 3.\n\nSo, passed at least one = passed only science + passed both = 3 + 45 = 48.\n\nFailed both = 60 - 48 = 12.\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of sets.\n\nLet M be the set of students who passed math, and S be the set of students who passed science.\n\nGiven that M is a subset of S, since everyone who passed math also passed science.\n\nSo, the number of students who passed science is 48, and since M is a subset of S, the number of students who passed only science is 48 - 45 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who passed at least one exam is 45 (both) + 3 (only science) = 48.\n\nThus, failed both = 60 - 48 = 12.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the number of students who passed science, which is 48, and the number who passed math, which is 45, and since all who passed math also passed science, there's no overlap beyond what's already in S.\n\nSo, the number of students who passed at least one exam is still 48.\n\nTherefore, failed both is 60 - 48 = 12.\n\nI think 12 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
