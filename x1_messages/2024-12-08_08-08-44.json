        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have a book with 500 pages, and I start reading from page 1. Each day, I turn 10 pages. I need to find out on which day I'll reach page 250.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to \"turn 10 pages\" each day. Does this mean I read 10 pages per day, or that I advance by 10 pages each day? In this context, since I'm starting from page 1, and I turn 10 pages each day, it means that each day I move forward by 10 pages.\n\nSo, on day 1, I start at page 1 and turn 10 pages, which means I end up at page 11. On day 2, I start at page 11 and turn another 10 pages, ending up at page 21. And so on.\n\nI need to find out on which day I will reach page 250. To do this, I can think about the pattern of my reading progress.\n\nLet me try to generalize this. Each day, I add 10 pages to my previous position. So, my position on any given day can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPosition = Starting page + (Number of days \u00d7 Pages turned per day)\n\nBut wait, on day 1, I turn 10 pages and end up at page 11. So, after day 1, position = 1 + (1 \u00d7 10) = 11, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, after day 2, position = 1 + (2 \u00d7 10) = 21, which also matches.\n\nSo, the general formula is:\n\nPosition = 1 + (days \u00d7 10)\n\nNow, I need to find the number of days when the position is 250.\n\nSo, set position = 250:\n\n250 = 1 + (days \u00d7 10)\n\nNow, solve for days:\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n249 = days \u00d7 10\n\nThen, divide both sides by 10:\n\ndays = 249 / 10\n\ndays = 24.9\n\nBut days must be a whole number because I can't have a fraction of a day in this context. So, what does 24.9 days mean?\n\nWell, after 24 full days, my position would be:\n\nPosition = 1 + (24 \u00d7 10) = 1 + 240 = 241\n\nSo, on day 24, I end at page 241.\n\nThen, on day 25, I turn another 10 pages, which would take me from page 241 to page 251.\n\nBut I need to reach page 250. So, on day 25, I would pass page 250 when I turn 10 pages from 241 to 251.\n\nTherefore, I would reach page 250 on day 25.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check this.\n\nAfter day 24, I'm at page 241.\n\nOn day 25, I turn 10 pages: 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251.\n\nSo, yes, on day 25, I would pass page 250 when I turn to page 251, but I would have reached page 250 during that process.\n\nAlternatively, if I need to be exactly on page 250, and I turn 10 pages each day, then on day 25, I would have turned the pages to reach up to page 251, which includes page 250.\n\nTherefore, I would reach page 250 on day 25.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to calculate how many pages I need to turn to reach page 250 from page 1.\n\nPages to turn = 250 - 1 = 249 pages.\n\nSince I turn 10 pages per day, the number of days required is 249 / 10 = 24.9 days.\n\nSince I can't have a fraction of a day, I need to round up to the next whole day, which is day 25.\n\nYes, that confirms it.\n\nSo, the answer is day 25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
