        "content": "Let's see. The farmer starts with 15 sheep and 9 goats. Then he sells 5 sheep and buys 3 more goats. I need to find out how many legs all his animals have now.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many sheep and goats he has after these transactions.\n\nHe had 15 sheep and sold 5, so:\n\n15 - 5 = 10 sheep remaining.\n\nHe had 9 goats and bought 3 more, so:\n\n9 + 3 = 12 goats now.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total number of legs. Assuming that each sheep and each goat has 4 legs, which is usual for these animals.\n\nSo, for the sheep:\n\n10 sheep \u00d7 4 legs/sheep = 40 legs.\n\nFor the goats:\n\n12 goats \u00d7 4 legs/goat = 48 legs.\n\nNow, to find the total number of legs, I add these together:\n\n40 legs + 48 legs = 88 legs.\n\nWait a minute, but I should think about whether all these animals have exactly 4 legs. Sometimes, there might be exceptions, like an animal being born with fewer legs or having lost a leg, but in general, it's safe to assume that each sheep and goat has 4 legs.\n\nAlso, the problem doesn't mention any other animals, so I only need to consider the sheep and goats.\n\nSo, the total number of legs should be 88.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nStarting with sheep:\n\nOriginal: 15 sheep\n\nSold: 5 sheep\n\nRemaining: 15 - 5 = 10 sheep\n\nGoats:\n\nOriginal: 9 goats\n\nBought: 3 more goats\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 = 12 goats\n\nLegs from sheep: 10 \u00d7 4 = 40 legs\n\nLegs from goats: 12 \u00d7 4 = 48 legs\n\nTotal legs: 40 + 48 = 88 legs\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as:\n\nTotal animals now: 10 sheep + 12 goats = 22 animals\n\nIf each has 4 legs, then 22 \u00d7 4 = 88 legs.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think 88 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{88} \\]"
