        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a class of 40 students, and 60% of them are boys. First, I need to find out how many boys and how many girls are in the class.\n\nTo find the number of boys:\n\nNumber of boys = 60% of 40\n\n= (60/100) * 40\n\n= 0.6 * 40\n\n= 24 boys\n\nNow, since the total number of students is 40, the number of girls would be:\n\nNumber of girls = Total students - Number of boys\n\n= 40 - 24\n\n= 16 girls\n\nNext, we're told that 75% of the boys passed the test. So, let's calculate how many boys passed:\n\nBoys who passed = 75% of 24\n\n= (75/100) * 24\n\n= 0.75 * 24\n\n= 18 boys\n\nSimilarly, 50% of the girls passed the test. So, let's find out how many girls passed:\n\nGirls who passed = 50% of 16\n\n= (50/100) * 16\n\n= 0.5 * 16\n\n= 8 girls\n\nNow, to find the total number of students who passed the test, we add the number of boys who passed and the number of girls who passed:\n\nTotal passed = Boys who passed + Girls who passed\n\n= 18 + 8\n\n= 26 students\n\nFinally, to find the percentage of the class that passed the test, we use the formula:\n\nPercentage passed = (Total passed / Total students) * 100\n\n= (26 / 40) * 100\n\n= 0.65 * 100\n\n= 65%\n\nSo, 65% of the class passed the test.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{65\\%} \\]"
