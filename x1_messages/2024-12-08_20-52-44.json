        "content": "Let's see. I have this election problem here. There are three candidates: A, B, and C. Candidate A got 45% of the votes, Candidate B got 35%, and Candidate C got the remaining votes. The total number of votes cast is 80,000. I need to find out how many more votes Candidate A received compared to Candidate B.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how many votes each candidate received. Starting with Candidate A, who got 45% of the votes. To find out the actual number of votes, I can calculate 45% of 80,000.\n\nSo, votes for Candidate A = 45% of 80,000.\n\nI know that percentage can be converted to a decimal by dividing by 100. So, 45% is 0.45.\n\nTherefore, votes for Candidate A = 0.45 * 80,000.\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n0.45 * 80,000 = 36,000 votes.\n\nOkay, so Candidate A received 36,000 votes.\n\nNext, Candidate B received 35% of the votes. Let's calculate that.\n\nVotes for Candidate B = 35% of 80,000.\n\nAgain, converting 35% to a decimal: 35% = 0.35.\n\nSo, votes for Candidate B = 0.35 * 80,000.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n0.35 * 80,000 = 28,000 votes.\n\nAlright, Candidate B received 28,000 votes.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many more votes Candidate A received than Candidate B. That should be the difference between their vote counts.\n\nSo, difference = votes for Candidate A - votes for Candidate B.\n\nDifference = 36,000 - 28,000 = 8,000 votes.\n\nTherefore, Candidate A received 8,000 more votes than Candidate B.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe without calculating each candidate's votes separately.\n\nLet's think about it. The difference in their percentages is 45% - 35% = 10%. So, the difference in votes should be 10% of the total votes.\n\nLet me calculate 10% of 80,000.\n\n10% of 80,000 = 0.10 * 80,000 = 8,000 votes.\n\nOkay, that's the same answer I got earlier. So, this confirms that my initial calculation is correct.\n\nAlso, just to be thorough, let's check how many votes Candidate C received.\n\nCandidate C got the remaining votes. Since A had 45% and B had 35%, together they had 45% + 35% = 80%.\n\nTherefore, Candidate C had 100% - 80% = 20% of the votes.\n\nSo, votes for Candidate C = 20% of 80,000 = 0.20 * 80,000 = 16,000 votes.\n\nJust to verify, let's add up all the votes:\n\nA: 36,000 + B: 28,000 + C: 16,000 = 80,000 votes. That matches the total votes cast.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nIn conclusion, Candidate A received 8,000 more votes than Candidate B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8000} \\]"
