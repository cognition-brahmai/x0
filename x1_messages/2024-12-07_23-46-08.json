He was born on November 30, 1835, in Florida, Missouri, and grew up in Hannibal, Missouri, which served as the inspiration for the settings in many of his novels. Twain is often referred to as the \"father of American literature\" and is renowned for his use of humor, satire, and local color in his writing. His works not only captured the essence of life along the Mississippi River but also tackled complex social issues of his time, such as racism and injustice. His novels, including \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" and \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\" are considered classics of American literature and continue to be studied and enjoyed worldwide."
