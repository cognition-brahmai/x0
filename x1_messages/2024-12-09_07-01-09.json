        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces 500 units of a product every day, and its production rate increases by 5% each week. We need to find out how many units will be produced in total after 4 weeks.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a daily production rate that changes weekly by increasing 5%. So, each week, the daily production rate goes up by 5% compared to the previous week.\n\nLet me break it down week by week.\n\n**Week 1:**\n\n- Daily production: 500 units\n\n- Days in a week: 7\n\n- Total production in Week 1: 500 units/day * 7 days = 3,500 units\n\n**Week 2:**\n\n- Production increases by 5% from Week 1\n\n- New daily production: 500 units + (5% of 500) = 500 + 25 = 525 units/day\n\n- Total production in Week 2: 525 units/day * 7 days = 3,675 units\n\n**Week 3:**\n\n- Production increases by 5% from Week 2\n\n- New daily production: 525 units + (5% of 525) = 525 + 26.25 = 551.25 units/day\n\n- Total production in Week 3: 551.25 units/day * 7 days = 3,858.75 units\n\n**Week 4:**\n\n- Production increases by 5% from Week 3\n\n- New daily production: 551.25 units + (5% of 551.25) = 551.25 + 27.5625 = 578.8125 units/day\n\n- Total production in Week 4: 578.8125 units/day * 7 days = 4,051.6875 units\n\nNow, to find the total production after 4 weeks, I need to add up the production of all four weeks:\n\nTotal production = Week 1 + Week 2 + Week 3 + Week 4\n\nTotal production = 3,500 + 3,675 + 3,858.75 + 4,051.6875\n\nLet me add these up step by step:\n\n3,500 + 3,675 = 7,175\n\n7,175 + 3,858.75 = 11,033.75\n\n11,033.75 + 4,051.6875 = 15,085.4375 units\n\nSo, the total production after 4 weeks is 15,085.4375 units.\n\nBut, it's a bit unusual to have a fraction of a unit, especially in production counts, which are typically whole numbers. Maybe we should round it to the nearest whole number.\n\n15,085.4375 rounds to 15,085 units.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with Week 1:\n\n500 units/day * 7 days = 3,500 units - that seems correct.\n\nWeek 2:\n\n500 + (0.05 * 500) = 500 + 25 = 525 units/day\n\n525 units/day * 7 days = 3,675 units - correct.\n\nWeek 3:\n\n525 + (0.05 * 525) = 525 + 26.25 = 551.25 units/day\n\n551.25 units/day * 7 days = 3,858.75 units - correct.\n\nWeek 4:\n\n551.25 + (0.05 * 551.25) = 551.25 + 27.5625 = 578.8125 units/day\n\n578.8125 units/day * 7 days = 4,051.6875 units - correct.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n3,500 + 3,675 = 7,175\n\n7,175 + 3,858.75 = 11,033.75\n\n11,033.75 + 4,051.6875 = 15,085.4375 units - correct.\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number: 15,085 units.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the production increase is applied at the beginning of each week, so the increase is based on the previous week's daily production rate.\n\nWait, in my calculation, I increased the production rate at the start of each week based on the previous week's daily rate, which seems correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that each week's production is 1.05 times the previous week's production.\n\nLet me verify that approach.\n\n**Week 1:**\n\n- Production: 3,500 units\n\n**Week 2:**\n\n- Production: 3,500 * 1.05 = 3,675 units\n\n**Week 3:**\n\n- Production: 3,675 * 1.05 = 3,858.75 units\n\n**Week 4:**\n\n- Production: 3,858.75 * 1.05 = 4,051.6875 units\n\nTotal production: 3,500 + 3,675 + 3,858.75 + 4,051.6875 = 15,085.4375 units\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, since the production increases by 5% each week, it's like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 1.05.\n\nThe formula for the sum of a geometric series is:\n\nS = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)\n\nWhere:\n\n- S is the sum\n\n- a is the first term\n\n- r is the common ratio\n\n- n is the number of terms\n\nIn this case:\n\n- a = 3,500 units (Week 1 production)\n\n- r = 1.05 (5% increase each week)\n\n- n = 4 weeks\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nS = 3,500 * (1.05^4 - 1) / (1.05 - 1)\n\nFirst, calculate 1.05^4:\n\n1.05^4 = 1.21550625\n\nNow, S = 3,500 * (1.21550625 - 1) / (0.05)\n\nS = 3,500 * (0.21550625) / 0.05\n\nS = 3,500 * 4.310125\n\nS = 15,085.4375 units\n\nAgain, this matches my previous calculations.\n\nSo, the total production after 4 weeks is 15,085.4375 units, which rounds to 15,085 units.\n\nBut, perhaps there's another way to look at it. Maybe considering the daily production rate and the weekly increase.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nEach week, the daily production rate increases by 5% compared to the previous week.\n\nSo, Week 1: 500 units/day\n\nWeek 2: 500 * 1.05 = 525 units/day\n\nWeek 3: 525 * 1.05 = 551.25 units/day\n\nWeek 4: 551.25 * 1.05 = 578.8125 units/day\n\nNow, total production per week:\n\nWeek 1: 500 * 7 = 3,500 units\n\nWeek 2: 525 * 7 = 3,675 units\n\nWeek 3: 551.25 * 7 = 3,858.75 units\n\nWeek 4: 578.8125 * 7 = 4,051.6875 units\n\nTotal: 3,500 + 3,675 + 3,858.75 + 4,051.6875 = 15,085.4375 units\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can calculate the total production differently, but I think this is straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps we can calculate the total production over the 4 weeks using the formula for the sum of a geometric series directly on the daily production and then multiply by the number of days.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nThe daily production increases by 5% each week. So, the daily production over the 4 weeks is:\n\nWeek 1: 500 units/day\n\nWeek 2: 500 * 1.05 = 525 units/day\n\nWeek 3: 525 * 1.05 = 551.25 units/day\n\nWeek 4: 551.25 * 1.05 = 578.8125 units/day\n\nNow, the total daily production over 4 weeks is the sum of these daily rates multiplied by the number of days in each week.\n\nBut since each week has 7 days, we can calculate the total production as:\n\nTotal production = 7 * (500 + 525 + 551.25 + 578.8125) = 7 * 2,155.0625 = 15,085.4375 units\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, using the geometric series formula for the daily production:\n\nThe sum of daily production over 4 weeks:\n\nS_daily = 500 + 500*1.05 + 500*(1.05)^2 + 500*(1.05)^3\n\nS_daily = 500 * (1 - 1.05^4) / (1 - 1.05)\n\nCalculating 1.05^4 = 1.21550625\n\nS_daily = 500 * (1.21550625 - 1) / 0.05\n\nS_daily = 500 * 0.21550625 / 0.05\n\nS_daily = 500 * 4.310125\n\nS_daily = 2,155.0625 units/day\n\nNow, total production over 4 weeks:\n\nTotal production = S_daily * 7 days/week * 4 weeks\n\nWait, no. Actually, S_daily is the sum of daily production rates over 4 weeks, but we need to find the total production over 4 weeks, which is the sum of daily productions multiplied by the number of days.\n\nBut in this approach, it's a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to stick with the initial method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of the weekly production increasing by 5% each week, starting from 3,500 units in Week 1.\n\nThen, Week 2: 3,500 * 1.05 = 3,675 units\n\nWeek 3: 3,675 * 1.05 = 3,858.75 units\n\nWeek 4: 3,858.75 * 1.05 = 4,051.6875 units\n\nTotal: 3,500 + 3,675 + 3,858.75 + 4,051.6875 = 15,085.4375 units\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the sum of a geometric series for the weekly productions:\n\nS = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)\n\nWhere a = 3,500, r = 1.05, n = 4\n\nS = 3,500 * (1.05^4 - 1) / 0.05\n\nS = 3,500 * (1.21550625 - 1) / 0.05\n\nS = 3,500 * 0.21550625 / 0.05\n\nS = 3,500 * 4.310125\n\nS = 15,085.4375 units\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think it's clear that the total production after 4 weeks is 15,085.4375 units, which we can round to 15,085 units.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider if the production increase is compounded weekly or if there's a different interpretation.\n\nAnother way is to think of the production rate increasing by 5% each week, meaning that each week's production is 5% more than the previous week.\n\nSo, Week 1: 3,500 units\n\nWeek 2: 3,500 * 1.05 = 3,675 units\n\nWeek 3: 3,675 * 1.05 = 3,858.75 units\n\nWeek 4: 3,858.75 * 1.05 = 4,051.6875 units\n\nTotal: 15,085.4375 units\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production increases by 5% cumulatively over the 4 weeks.\n\nWait, in my calculations, it's already cumulative because each week's increase is based on the previous week's production.\n\nSo, I think the initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total production after 4 weeks is 15,085 units (rounded from 15,085.4375).\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the daily production increases by 5% each week, and we need to calculate the total production over 28 days (4 weeks), we can approach it differently.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nTotal days: 4 weeks * 7 days/week = 28 days\n\nDaily production on day n:\n\n- For days 1-7: 500 units\n\n- For days 8-14: 500 * 1.05 = 525 units\n\n- For days 15-21: 525 * 1.05 = 551.25 units\n\n- For days 22-28: 551.25 * 1.05 = 578.8125 units\n\nNow, total production:\n\n- Days 1-7: 500 * 7 = 3,500 units\n\n- Days 8-14: 525 * 7 = 3,675 units\n\n- Days 15-21: 551.25 * 7 = 3,858.75 units\n\n- Days 22-28: 578.8125 * 7 = 4,051.6875 units\n\nTotal: 3,500 + 3,675 + 3,858.75 + 4,051.6875 = 15,085.4375 units\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, the total production after 4 weeks is 15,085 units (rounded from 15,085.4375).\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the total production after 4 weeks is 15,085 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15085} \\]"
