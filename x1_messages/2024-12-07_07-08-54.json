        "content": "Let's break this down. The factory produces two types of products: A and B. Each day, it makes 200 units of A and 300 units of B. Now, product A takes 2 hours to produce each unit, and product B takes 3 hours per unit. I need to find out the total hours spent producing both products each day.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total production time for product A. Since each unit of A takes 2 hours and they make 200 units, I can multiply 2 hours by 200 units to get the total time for A.\n\nSimilarly, for product B, each unit takes 3 hours, and they produce 300 units, so I'll multiply 3 hours by 300 units to get the total time for B.\n\nFinally, I'll add the total times for A and B to get the overall production time per day.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\nFor product A: 2 hours/unit * 200 units = 400 hours\n\nFor product B: 3 hours/unit * 300 units = 900 hours\n\nTotal hours per day = 400 hours + 900 hours = 1300 hours\n\nSo, the factory spends 1300 hours producing products each day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1300} \\]"
