        "content": "I'm here to help! The Great Wall of China is a fascinating structure with a rich history. To answer your question, the Great Wall served multiple purposes throughout its existence. Primarily, it was built to protect the Chinese states and empires from invasions and raids by various nomadic groups. It also served as a means to control trade and migration.\n\nRegarding its length, the Great Wall is indeed very extensive. According to the World Heritage Centre, the combined lengths of all the walls built over different dynasties stretch over 21,000 miles (approximately 34,000 kilometers). However, it's important to note that not all parts of the wall are still standing today.\n\nAs for whether it can be seen from space, this is a common misconception. While the Great Wall is very long, it is not visible to the naked eye from space without the aid of magnification. This myth likely persists due to the wall's significant size and historical importance.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the History.com article on the Great Wall of China.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n- History.com.
