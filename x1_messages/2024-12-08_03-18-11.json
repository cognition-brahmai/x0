        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that sells apples and oranges with different prices, and a customer buys a combination of these fruits for a total cost. We need to figure out exactly how many of each they bought.\n\nFirst, let's note down what we know:\n\n- Price of one apple: $0.50\n\n- Price of one orange: $0.75\n\n- Total number of fruits bought: 10\n\n- Total cost of the fruits: $6.25\n\nWe need to find out how many apples and how many oranges were bought.\n\nLet's think about how to set this up. Since there are two types of fruits with different prices, this seems like a problem that can be solved using a system of equations.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- Let \\( a \\) be the number of apples bought.\n\n- Let \\( o \\) be the number of oranges bought.\n\nNow, we can set up two equations based on the information given.\n\nFirst equation: The total number of fruits is 10.\n\n\\[ a + o = 10 \\]\n\nSecond equation: The total cost of the fruits is $6.25.\n\nSince each apple costs $0.50 and each orange costs $0.75, the total cost can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ 0.50a + 0.75o = 6.25 \\]\n\nSo, we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\( a + o = 10 \\)\n\n2. \\( 0.50a + 0.75o = 6.25 \\)\n\nNow, we need to solve this system to find the values of \\( a \\) and \\( o \\).\n\nOne way to solve this is by the substitution method. Let's solve the first equation for one variable and substitute it into the second equation.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n\\[ a = 10 - o \\]\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( a \\) into equation 2:\n\n\\[ 0.50(10 - o) + 0.75o = 6.25 \\]\n\nLet's simplify this:\n\n\\[ 0.50 \\times 10 - 0.50o + 0.75o = 6.25 \\]\n\n\\[ 5 - 0.50o + 0.75o = 6.25 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 5 + ( -0.50o + 0.75o ) = 6.25 \\]\n\n\\[ 5 + 0.25o = 6.25 \\]\n\nNow, subtract 5 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.25o = 1.25 \\]\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 0.25 to solve for \\( o \\):\n\n\\[ o = \\frac{1.25}{0.25} \\]\n\n\\[ o = 5 \\]\n\nSo, the number of oranges bought is 5.\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expression we have for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ a = 10 - o \\]\n\n\\[ a = 10 - 5 \\]\n\n\\[ a = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.\n\nLet\u2019s double-check this to make sure it adds up.\n\nTotal number of fruits: 5 apples + 5 oranges = 10 fruits. That matches.\n\nTotal cost: (5 apples \u00d7 $0.50) + (5 oranges \u00d7 $0.75) = $2.50 + $3.75 = $6.25. That also matches.\n\nLooks good!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 \\text{ apples and } 5 \\text{ oranges}} \\]"
