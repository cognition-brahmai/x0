        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a company's payroll expense. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nThere are 100 employees in total. 60% of them work full-time, and the rest work part-time. Full-time employees earn an average of $50,000 per year, and part-time employees earn an average of $30,000 per year. I need to find out the total payroll expense for the company.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many employees are full-time and how many are part-time.\n\nIf 60% of the 100 employees are full-time, then:\n\nFull-time employees = 60% of 100 = 0.60 * 100 = 60 employees\n\nThat means the remaining 40% are part-time employees.\n\nPart-time employees = 40% of 100 = 0.40 * 100 = 40 employees\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total salary expense for full-time employees and for part-time employees separately, and then add them together to get the total payroll expense.\n\nFor full-time employees:\n\nTotal full-time salary = number of full-time employees * average salary per full-time employee = 60 * $50,000 = $3,000,000\n\nFor part-time employees:\n\nTotal part-time salary = number of part-time employees * average salary per part-time employee = 40 * $30,000 = $1,200,000\n\nNow, add these two amounts to get the total payroll expense:\n\nTotal payroll expense = total full-time salary + total part-time salary = $3,000,000 + $1,200,000 = $4,200,000\n\nSo, the total payroll expense for the company is $4,200,000 per year.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with the number of employees:\n\nFull-time: 60% of 100 = 60 employees\n\nPart-time: 40% of 100 = 40 employees\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, the total salary for full-time employees:\n\n60 employees * $50,000 = $3,000,000\n\nAnd for part-time employees:\n\n40 employees * $30,000 = $1,200,000\n\nAdding them up:\n\n$3,000,000 + $1,200,000 = $4,200,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the average salary per employee and multiply by the number of employees, but since the average salary is different for full-time and part-time employees, it's better to calculate them separately and then sum them up.\n\nI don't think there's any other factor to consider here, like bonuses or benefits, since the question only mentions salaries.\n\nSo, the total payroll expense is $4,200,000 per year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4200000} \\]"
