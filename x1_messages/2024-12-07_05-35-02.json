        "content": "So in this class, there are 40 students in total. And it's said that 70% of them scored above 80 on a test. I need to find out how many students scored below or equal to 80.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many students scored above 80. Since 70% of 40 students scored above 80, I can calculate that number by taking 70% of 40.\n\nTo calculate 70% of 40, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply:\n\n70% = 0.70\n\nSo, 0.70 \u00d7 40 = 28 students scored above 80.\n\nNow, to find out how many scored below or equal to 80, I can subtract the number of students who scored above 80 from the total number of students.\n\nTotal students = 40\n\nStudents who scored above 80 = 28\n\nTherefore, students who scored below or equal to 80 = 40 - 28 = 12\n\nSo, 12 students scored below or equal to 80.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe by calculating the percentage of students who scored below or equal to 80 directly.\n\nIf 70% scored above 80, then the remaining percentage must have scored below or equal to 80. Since the total percentage is 100%, then:\n\nPercentage who scored below or equal to 80 = 100% - 70% = 30%\n\nNow, to find 30% of 40 students:\n\n30% of 40 = 0.30 \u00d7 40 = 12 students\n\nSo, again, I get 12 students.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like either way, 12 students scored below or equal to 80.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can check if there's any other factor I should consider. Is there any possibility that some students scored exactly 80, and if so, how they are categorized. But according to the problem, \"below or equal to 80\" includes 80, so that should be fine.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the percentages add up correctly. 70% scored above 80, and 30% scored below or equal to 80, which totals 100%. That checks out.\n\nAdditionally, I can confirm the calculation by using fractions. 70% is equivalent to 7/10, so 7/10 of 40 is (7/10)\u00d740 = 28 students, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, 30% is 3/10, so 3/10 of 40 is (3/10)\u00d740 = 12 students.\n\nEverything seems consistent. I think 12 is the correct number of students who scored below or equal to 80.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
