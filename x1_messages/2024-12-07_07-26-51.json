        "content": "Alright, let's solve the equation 3x - 7 = 2x + 8. So, the goal here is to find the value of x that makes this equation true. To do that, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Let's see how we can do that step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at the equation: 3x - 7 = 2x + 8. I notice that there are x terms on both sides, so maybe I should get all the x terms on one side and the constant terms on the other side. Let's try to do that.\n\nI can start by subtracting 2x from both sides. That should help me get all the x terms on the left side. So, if I subtract 2x from both sides, I get:\n\n3x - 2x - 7 = 2x - 2x + 8\n\nSimplifying that, it becomes:\n\n(3x - 2x) - 7 = 0 + 8\n\nSo, that's:\n\nx - 7 = 8\n\nNow, I have x - 7 = 8. Okay, that seems simpler. Now, I need to get x by itself. To do that, I can add 7 to both sides of the equation. So, adding 7 to both sides:\n\nx - 7 + 7 = 8 + 7\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = 15\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me check my steps again. Starting with 3x - 7 = 2x + 8.\n\nI subtracted 2x from both sides and got x - 7 = 8. Then, I added 7 to both sides and got x = 15. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify by plugging x = 15 back into the original equation to see if it holds true.\n\nSo, plugging x = 15 into 3x - 7:\n\n3*(15) - 7 = 45 - 7 = 38\n\nAnd plugging x = 15 into 2x + 8:\n\n2*(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38\n\nOkay, both sides equal 38, so x = 15 is indeed the correct solution.\n\nAlternatively, I could have approached this differently. For example, I could have first added 7 to both sides to eliminate the -7 on the left side. Let's try that.\n\nStarting again with 3x - 7 = 2x + 8.\n\nAdd 7 to both sides:\n\n3x - 7 + 7 = 2x + 8 + 7\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3x = 2x + 15\n\nNow, subtract 2x from both sides:\n\n3x - 2x = 2x - 2x + 15\n\nWhich gives:\n\nx = 15\n\nSame answer as before. Good, it's consistent.\n\nI think that's straightforward enough. The key is to get all the x terms on one side and the constant terms on the other side, then solve for x. It's important to perform the same operation on both sides to keep the equation balanced.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other ways to approach this. For instance, what if I were to subtract 3x from both sides instead of subtracting 2x? Let's see.\n\nStarting with 3x - 7 = 2x + 8.\n\nSubtract 3x from both sides:\n\n3x - 3x - 7 = 2x - 3x + 8\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-7 = -x + 8\n\nNow, I can subtract 8 from both sides:\n\n-7 - 8 = -x + 8 - 8\n\nWhich is:\n\n-15 = -x\n\nThen, to solve for x, I can multiply both sides by -1:\n\n-1*(-15) = -1*(-x)\n\nSo, 15 = x\n\nAgain, the same result. So, no matter which approach I take, I end up with x = 15.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in all these steps, the operations are chosen to isolate x, and the key is to maintain equality by doing the same thing to both sides of the equation.\n\nI don't think there's anything else to add here. The solution is x = 15, and it's consistent across different methods. It's always a good idea to check the solution by plugging it back into the original equation, as I did earlier, to ensure it's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
