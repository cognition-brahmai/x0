        "content": "I'm excited to help you with this task! So, you want to create a RESTful API server in GoLang that handles CRUD operations for a collection of books. Each book should have a title, author, publication year, and ISBN number. You're open to using any database or data structure for storage. Great!\n\nFirst, let's break this down into manageable steps:\n\n1. **Set up the Go environment:** Make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).\n\n2. **Choose a database:** Since you're open to any database, I'll suggest using SQLite for simplicity. It's easy to set up and doesn't require a separate server. Alternatively, if you prefer a more robust solution, you could use PostgreSQL or MongoDB.\n\n3. **Define the book model:** Create a struct in Go that represents a book with the required fields: title, author, publication year, and ISBN.\n\n4. **Set up the database connection:** Write the code to connect to the database and create the necessary table for storing books.\n\n5. **Implement CRUD operations:** Create handlers for creating, reading, updating, and deleting books.\n\n6. **Set up routes:** Define the API endpoints for each CRUD operation.\n\n7. **Test the API:** Use tools like Postman or curl to test the API endpoints.\n\nLet's start with setting up the Go environment. Have you already installed Go on your machine? If not, I can guide you through the installation process."
