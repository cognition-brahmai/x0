        "content": "Let's see... So, there's this company that offers two types of discounts on their products: a flat discount of $50 or a percentage discount of 25%. A customer wants to buy something that costs $300 and is trying to figure out which discount option would save them more money. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each discount means in this context. A flat discount of $50 means that no matter what the original price is, the customer saves a fixed amount of $50. So, if the product is $300, subtracting $50 would make the final price $250.\n\nOn the other hand, a percentage discount of 25% means that the customer gets 25% off the original price. So, for a $300 item, 25% of $300 would be the discount amount, and then that amount is subtracted from the original price to get the final price.\n\nLet me calculate both options to see which one results in a lower final price, meaning more savings for the customer.\n\nFirst, the flat discount:\n\nOriginal price: $300\n\nFlat discount: $50\n\nFinal price: $300 - $50 = $250\n\nNow, the percentage discount:\n\nOriginal price: $300\n\nPercentage discount: 25%\n\nDiscount amount: 25% of $300 = (25/100) * $300 = $75\n\nFinal price: $300 - $75 = $225\n\nComparing the two final prices:\n\n- Flat discount: $250\n\n- Percentage discount: $225\n\nSo, the percentage discount results in a lower final price by $25 ($250 - $225 = $25).\n\nTherefore, the percentage discount saves the customer more money in this case.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this a bit more. Maybe there's a general way to determine which discount is better depending on the original price.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the original price as P, the flat discount as D ($50), and the percentage discount as R (25%).\n\nFor the flat discount, the final price is P - D.\n\nFor the percentage discount, the final price is P - (R/100)*P = P(1 - R/100).\n\nTo find out which one is better, we can set up an inequality:\n\nP - D < P(1 - R/100)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nP - D < P - (R/100)P\n\nSubtract P from both sides:\n\n- D < - (R/100)P\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (which reverses the inequality):\n\nD > (R/100)P\n\nSo, the flat discount is better when D > (R/100)P.\n\nSimilarly, the percentage discount is better when D < (R/100)P.\n\nAnd they are equal when D = (R/100)P.\n\nIn this specific case, D = $50 and R = 25%, and P = $300.\n\nSo, (R/100)P = (25/100)*$300 = $75.\n\nSince $50 < $75, the percentage discount is better.\n\nThis makes sense with our earlier calculation, where the percentage discount saved more money.\n\nSo, in general, the percentage discount will be better when (R/100)P > D, which in this case it is.\n\nTherefore, for a $300 product, the 25% discount saves more money compared to the $50 flat discount.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider another example.\n\nSuppose the product costs $200.\n\nFlat discount: $200 - $50 = $150\n\nPercentage discount: 25% of $200 = $50, so final price: $200 - $50 = $150\n\nIn this case, both discounts result in the same final price.\n\nAnd according to our earlier inequality, (R/100)P = (25/100)*$200 = $50, which is equal to D=$50, so the final prices are the same.\n\nIf the product costs $100,\n\nFlat discount: $100 - $50 = $50\n\nPercentage discount: 25% of $100 = $25, so final price: $100 - $25 = $75\n\nHere, the flat discount is better because $50 < $75.\n\nSo, it depends on the original price compared to the relationship between D and (R/100)P.\n\nIn the original question, with P=$300, D=$50, and R=25%, the percentage discount is better.\n\nTherefore, the customer should choose the percentage discount to save more money.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Percentage discount}} \\]"
