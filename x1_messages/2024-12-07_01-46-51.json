        "content": "A baby kangaroo is called a joey. In Australia, the term \"joey\" is sometimes used colloquially to refer to human children as well, much like how people might use terms such as \"bub\" or \"kid.\" However, it's more common to hear \"bub\" or \"kid\" in informal settings. The term \"joey\" for human children might be used in a playful or endearing way, but it's not as widespread as it is for baby kangaroos."
