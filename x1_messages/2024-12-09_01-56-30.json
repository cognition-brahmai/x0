Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\nHere's a simple implementation of the bubble sort algorithm in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfunction bubbleSort(arr) {\n    var len = arr.length;\n    for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n        for (var j = 0; j < len - i - 1; j++) {\n            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {\n                // Swap numbers\n                var temp = arr[j];\n                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];\n                arr[j + 1] = temp;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return arr;\n}\n\n// Test the function\nvar array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90];\nconsole.log(bubbleSort(array));\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The outer loop runs from the first element to the last element of the array.\n\n- The inner loop runs from the first element to the unsorted part of the array (length - i -1).\n\n- If the current element is greater than the next element, they are swapped.\n\n- This process continues until the array is sorted in ascending order.\n\nYou can test this function with different arrays to see how it works. Let me know if you have any questions or need further explanation!"
