        "content": "I'm going to try to tackle this problem. So, the question is to show that there's no continuous function h from the real numbers to the real numbers such that composing h with itself gives e^x for all real x. That is, h(h(x)) = e^x.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this is asking. We have a function h, and if you apply h twice, it's the same as exponentiating x with base e. So, h(h(x)) = e^x.\n\nI know that e^x is always positive for real x, and it's strictly increasing. Also, e^x is its own derivative, which might or might not be useful here.\n\nSince h is composed with itself to get e^x, maybe h is some sort of \"square root\" of the exponential function, but in the sense of function composition, not multiplication.\n\nI need to show that no such continuous function h exists. So, I should assume that such an h exists and try to find a contradiction.\n\nLet's assume h is continuous and h(h(x)) = e^x for all real x.\n\nFirst, since h is continuous, it must be monotonic because continuous functions can only change direction a finite number of times, but I'm not sure if that's immediately helpful.\n\nLet's think about the behavior of h.\n\nConsider h(0). Let's say h(0) = a.\n\nThen, h(h(0)) = h(a) = e^0 = 1.\n\nSo, h(a) = 1.\n\nNow, what about h(1)? Since h(h(a)) = e^a.\n\nBut h(1) = h(h(a)) = e^a.\n\nSo, h(1) = e^a.\n\nAlso, h(h(1)) = h(e^a) = e^1 = e.\n\nSo, h(e^a) = e.\n\nNow, I need to see if I can find some relationship or contradiction here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the iterates of h.\n\nWait, another approach: consider the function h iterated multiple times.\n\nLet\u2019s denote h^2(x) = h(h(x)) = e^x.\n\nThen h^3(x) = h(h^2(x)) = h(e^x).\n\nh^4(x) = h(h^3(x)) = h(h(e^x)) = e^{e^x}.\n\nSo, h^4(x) = e^{e^x}.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nLet\u2019s think about the inverse of h.\n\nIf h is continuous and strictly monotonic, it has an inverse.\n\nWait, but h is defined on all real numbers, so it must be strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\nBut e^x is strictly increasing, so maybe h is also strictly increasing.\n\nAssume h is strictly increasing.\n\nThen, h(h(x)) is strictly increasing because it's a composition of increasing functions.\n\nBut e^x is strictly increasing, so this is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if h is strictly decreasing, then h(h(x)) would be strictly increasing, since the composition of two decreasing functions is increasing.\n\nSo, in either case, h(h(x)) is increasing, which matches e^x.\n\nBut maybe I can find a contradiction based on fixed points or something like that.\n\nA fixed point of h is a point x where h(x) = x.\n\nIf h has a fixed point, then h(h(x)) = h(x) = x, but h(h(x)) = e^x, so e^x = x.\n\nBut e^x = x has no real solutions because e^x is always greater than x for all real x.\n\nWait, is that true?\n\nLet\u2019s check: for x=0, e^0 =1 >0.\n\nFor x=1, e^1 = e >1.\n\nFor x negative, e^x is positive, while x is negative, so e^x >x.\n\nSo, indeed, e^x > x for all real x, meaning e^x - x >0 always.\n\nTherefore, h cannot have any fixed points, since h(h(x)) = e^x \u2260 x.\n\nWait, but h itself might still have fixed points, but in this case, h(h(x)) = e^x, which is not equal to x, so maybe that's not directly useful.\n\nAlternatively, consider the function h(x) - x.\n\nIf h(x) - x has a zero, then h(x) = x, which we just saw is impossible because h(h(x)) = e^x \u2260 x.\n\nSo, h(x) - x is always positive or always negative.\n\nAssume h(x) > x for all x.\n\nThen, h(h(x)) > h(x) > x.\n\nBut h(h(x)) = e^x.\n\nSo, e^x > h(x) > x.\n\nSimilarly, if h(x) < x for all x, then h(h(x)) < h(x) < x, but h(h(x)) = e^x, which is greater than x, so this is impossible.\n\nTherefore, h(x) > x for all x.\n\nSo, h(x) > x for all real x.\n\nThat's interesting.\n\nNow, since h is continuous and h(x) > x for all x, h must be strictly increasing.\n\nIf h were strictly decreasing, then h(h(x)) would be increasing, which matches e^x, but h(x) > x for all x would not necessarily imply that h is increasing.\n\nWait, actually, if h is decreasing, and h(x) > x for all x, it's possible.\n\nFor example, consider h(x) = -x + c for some constant c.\n\nBut h(h(x)) = -(-x + c) + c = x.\n\nBut we need h(h(x)) = e^x, which is not equal to x.\n\nSo, maybe h can't be decreasing.\n\nWait, perhaps h must be increasing.\n\nLet\u2019s assume h is increasing.\n\nThen, since h(x) > x for all x, h is strictly increasing.\n\nNow, consider the limit as x approaches infinity.\n\nSince h is strictly increasing and continuous, it must approach some limit as x approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but e^x grows without bound, so h(h(x)) grows without bound, so h must also grow without bound as x approaches infinity.\n\nSimilarly, as x approaches negative infinity, h(x) must approach some limit.\n\nBut h is strictly increasing, so it must approach negative infinity as x approaches negative infinity.\n\nWait, because if h approached a finite limit as x approaches negative infinity, then h(h(x)) would approach h(L), where L is the limit, but e^x approaches 0 as x approaches negative infinity, so this doesn't match unless h(L) = 0.\n\nBut if h is strictly increasing, then h(x) approaches some limit L as x approaches negative infinity, and h(x) approaches infinity as x approaches infinity.\n\nBut then h(h(x)) would approach h(L) as x approaches negative infinity, which should be e^x approaching 0.\n\nSo, h(L) = 0.\n\nBut h is strictly increasing, so h(x) > x for all x, which would mean L > negative infinity.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe a different approach is needed.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the function h(x) - e^{h^{-1}(x)}.\n\nWait, that seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the derivative of h.\n\nIf h is continuous, maybe it's differentiable, but I don't know that.\n\nAssuming h is differentiable, maybe I can find a differential equation.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose h is differentiable.\n\nThen, differentiating both sides of h(h(x)) = e^x with respect to x, we get:\n\nh'(h(x)) * h'(x) = e^x.\n\nThis is interesting.\n\nSo, h'(h(x)) * h'(x) = e^x.\n\nBut I don't know if h is differentiable, so maybe this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the iterates of h and see if I can find a pattern or a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the function h(x) - e^{h^{-1}(x)}.\n\nWait, that seems too vague.\n\nAnother idea: since h(h(x)) = e^x, then h(x) must be a bijection.\n\nBecause if h is continuous and h(h(x)) is bijective (since e^x is bijective from R to (0, infinity)), then h must be bijective.\n\nWait, actually, e^x is bijective from R to (0, infinity), but h(h(x)) = e^x, which is bijective from R to (0, infinity).\n\nBut h is from R to R.\n\nWait, h is from R to R, and h(h(x)) maps R to (0, infinity).\n\nSo, h must map R onto (0, infinity), because h(h(x)) = e^x maps R to (0, infinity).\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, h maps R to some subset of R, and then h maps that subset to (0, infinity).\n\nSo, h must map R onto some set A, and h maps A onto (0, infinity).\n\nSo, h is a bijection from R to A, and from A to (0, infinity).\n\nTherefore, h is a bijection from R to (0, infinity).\n\nWait, but h is from R to R.\n\nSo, A must be (0, infinity), because h(h(x)) maps R onto (0, infinity).\n\nWait, maybe not.\n\nWait, if h maps R onto A, and h maps A onto (0, infinity), then composing them gives h(h(x)) maps R onto (0, infinity).\n\nBut h is from R to R, so A is a subset of R.\n\nSo, h maps R onto A, and A onto (0, infinity).\n\nTherefore, h maps R onto A, which is (0, infinity), because h(h(x)) maps R onto (0, infinity).\n\nWait, but h is from R to R, so A is (0, infinity).\n\nTherefore, h maps R onto (0, infinity).\n\nSo, h is a continuous bijection from R to (0, infinity), so it must be strictly monotonic.\n\nSince (0, infinity) is not closed, but R is, maybe that's an issue, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the intermediate value property of continuous functions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the behavior of h at 0 and at infinity.\n\nWe already have h(0) = a, h(a) = 1, h(1) = e^a, and so on.\n\nMaybe I can try to find a contradiction by assuming h is continuous and constructing a sequence.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the sequence defined by x_0 = 0, x_1 = h(0) = a, x_2 = h(a) =1, x_3 = h(1) = e^a, x_4 = h(e^a) = e^{e^a}, and so on.\n\nNow, since h is continuous and maps R onto (0, infinity), it must be strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\nBut earlier, we saw that h(x) > x for all x, which seems more consistent with h being strictly increasing.\n\nAssume h is strictly increasing.\n\nThen, since h(x) > x for all x, h must map R onto (0, infinity).\n\nWait, but if h is strictly increasing and h(x) > x for all x, then h must approach some positive limit as x approaches negative infinity, and approach infinity as x approaches infinity.\n\nBut earlier, we saw that h maps R onto (0, infinity), so h approaches 0 as x approaches negative infinity and approaches infinity as x approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but if h is strictly increasing and h(x) > x for all x, then as x approaches negative infinity, h(x) must approach some limit L >=0, but since h maps to (0, infinity), L must be 0.\n\nAnd as x approaches infinity, h(x) approaches infinity.\n\nOk, so h is a strictly increasing continuous function from R to (0, infinity), with h(x) > x for all x.\n\nNow, consider the function h(x) - x.\n\nThis function is always positive, and continuous, so h(x) > x for all x.\n\nNow, consider the function h(h(x)) = e^x.\n\nSince h is strictly increasing, h(h(x)) is strictly increasing, which matches e^x.\n\nNow, perhaps consider the growth rates.\n\nAs x approaches infinity, h(h(x)) = e^x, which grows exponentially.\n\nBut h(x) approaches infinity as x approaches infinity, so h must grow faster than linearly, but slower than exponentially.\n\nWait, but if h grows faster than linearly, then h(h(x)) would grow even faster.\n\nBut e^x grows faster than any polynomial or exponential function with base less than e.\n\nWait, actually, e^x grows faster than any exponential function with base less than e.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the inverse function.\n\nSince h is bijective, it has an inverse h^{-1}: (0, infinity) -> R.\n\nThen, from h(h(x)) = e^x, applying h^{-1} to both sides, we get h(x) = h^{-1}(e^x).\n\nSo, h(x) = h^{-1}(e^x).\n\nThis seems like a useful relationship.\n\nNow, since h is strictly increasing, h^{-1} is also strictly increasing.\n\nNow, perhaps consider the composition h(h^{-1}(x)) = x for x >0.\n\nBut from h(h(x)) = e^x, and h(h^{-1}(x)) = x, perhaps I can relate these.\n\nWait, h(h(x)) = e^x, and h(h^{-1}(x)) = x.\n\nThese are different compositions.\n\nMaybe I can express h in terms of itself.\n\nFrom h(x) = h^{-1}(e^x), and h^{-1}(x) = h(x), but that doesn't make sense unless h is its own inverse, which seems unlikely.\n\nWait, no, h(h(x)) = e^x, and h(h^{-1}(x)) =x.\n\nThese are different.\n\nWait, perhaps consider that h^{-1}(e^x) = h(x).\n\nSo, h(x) = h^{-1}(e^x).\n\nNow, perhaps apply h to both sides:\n\nh(h(x)) = h(h^{-1}(e^x)) = e^x.\n\nWhich is consistent.\n\nBut maybe I can differentiate this equation.\n\nAssuming h is differentiable, differentiate h(x) = h^{-1}(e^x) with respect to x:\n\nh'(x) = [h^{-1}]'(e^x) * e^x.\n\nBut [h^{-1}]'(x) = 1/h'(h^{-1}(x)).\n\nSo, h'(x) = [1/h'(h^{-1}(e^x))] * e^x.\n\nBut h^{-1}(e^x) = h(x), so:\n\nh'(x) = [1/h'(h(x))] * e^x.\n\nThis seems like a functional equation for h'.\n\nIt's getting complicated.\n\nMaybe differentiating isn't the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the behavior at specific points.\n\nWe have h(0) = a, h(a) =1, h(1) = e^a.\n\nMaybe try to find a consistent value for a.\n\nSuppose a is positive.\n\nSince h(x) > x for all x, a >0.\n\nNow, h(a) =1, so a must be less than 1, because h is increasing.\n\nWait, if h is increasing and h(a) =1, and h(0) =a, then since 0 < a <1, because h is increasing and h(0) =a <1= h(a).\n\nSo, a must be between 0 and 1.\n\nNow, h(1) = e^a.\n\nSince a is between 0 and 1, e^a is between 1 and e.\n\nNow, h(e^a) = e.\n\nSince e^a is between 1 and e, and h is increasing, h(e^a) = e.\n\nNow, consider that h is continuous and increasing, mapping R onto (0, infinity).\n\nTherefore, h has an inverse function h^{-1}: (0, infinity) -> R.\n\nNow, perhaps consider the function composition again.\n\nWait, maybe try to find an expression for h in terms of e^x.\n\nSuppose h(x) = e^{k(x)}, where k(x) is some function.\n\nThen, h(h(x)) = e^{k(e^{k(x)})} = e^x.\n\nTherefore, k(e^{k(x)}) = x.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps suppose h(x) = e^{a x}, but this might not work because h is from R to R, but e^{a x} is always positive.\n\nWait, but h is from R to (0, infinity), so this might be a possibility.\n\nAssume h(x) = e^{a x}, then h(h(x)) = e^{a e^{a x}} = e^x.\n\nTherefore, a e^{a x} =x.\n\nBut this equation a e^{a x} =x must hold for all x, which is impossible because it's transcendental and can't hold for all real x.\n\nTherefore, h(x) cannot be of the form e^{a x}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe h is linear, but h(x) = m x + b.\n\nThen h(h(x)) = m(m x + b) + b = m^2 x + m b + b = e^x.\n\nBut e^x is not a linear function, so this can't be.\n\nTherefore, h is not linear.\n\nSimilarly, h can't be quadratic or any polynomial, because composing two polynomials generally gives a higher degree polynomial, unless it's linear.\n\nBut e^x is not a polynomial.\n\nTherefore, h must be a non-polynomial function.\n\nAlternatively, maybe h is some kind of exponential function, but as we saw, assuming h(x) = e^{a x} leads to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps h is a composition of logarithms and exponentials.\n\nWait, maybe h(x) = ln(k x + c) for some constants k and c, but this might not cover the entire real line.\n\nWait, ln is only defined for positive x, so that wouldn't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps h has multiple parts, defined piecewise.\n\nBut the problem specifies that h is continuous from R to R, so it can't have discontinuities.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider the graph of h.\n\nSince h is continuous and maps R onto (0, infinity), and h(x) >x for all x, the graph of h must lie above the line y=x, and it must cross from approaching 0 as x approaches negative infinity to approaching infinity as x approaches infinity.\n\nNow, consider that h(h(x)) = e^x.\n\nSo, the composition of h with itself gives e^x.\n\nNow, perhaps consider the iterates.\n\nWait, maybe consider that h is a functional square root of e^x.\n\nThat is, h is a function such that applying it twice gives e^x.\n\nIn the theory of functional square roots and iterates, there are methods to construct such functions, but they might not be continuous or might have other pathologies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a theorem that says no such continuous function exists.\n\nI need to find a contradiction to the assumption that such a continuous h exists.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the intermediate value property.\n\nSince h is continuous, it satisfies the intermediate value property.\n\nNow, consider that h maps R onto (0, infinity), so for any y >0, there exists x such that h(x) =y.\n\nNow, since h is strictly increasing, it has an inverse.\n\nNow, perhaps consider the function h^{-1}(x).\n\nSince h is strictly increasing, h^{-1} is also strictly increasing.\n\nNow, from earlier, h(x) = h^{-1}(e^x).\n\nSo, h(x) = h^{-1}(e^x).\n\nNow, perhaps consider applying h to both sides:\n\nh(h(x)) = h(h^{-1}(e^x)) = e^x.\n\nWhich is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider applying h^{-1} to both sides of h(x) = h^{-1}(e^x):\n\nh(h(x)) = e^x, which we already have.\n\nThis doesn't seem to lead to a contradiction.\n\nMaybe consider the behavior as x approaches negative infinity.\n\nAs x approaches negative infinity, h(x) approaches 0, since h maps R onto (0, infinity).\n\nSimilarly, h(h(x)) = e^x approaches 0.\n\nBut h(x) approaches 0 as x approaches negative infinity.\n\nNow, consider that h is continuous and strictly increasing, with h(x) >x for all x.\n\nNow, perhaps consider the derivative again.\n\nAssuming h is differentiable, from h(h(x)) = e^x, differentiating both sides:\n\nh'(h(x)) * h'(x) = e^x.\n\nNow, as x approaches negative infinity, h(x) approaches 0, and e^x approaches 0.\n\nSo, h'(h(x)) * h'(x) approaches 0.\n\nBut h(x) approaches 0, so h'(h(x)) approaches h'(0).\n\nAssuming h is differentiable at 0, let\u2019s denote h'(0) = d.\n\nThen, as x approaches negative infinity, h'(x) approaches some limit, say l.\n\nThen, h'(h(x)) approaches h'(0) = d.\n\nSo, d * l =0.\n\nTherefore, either d=0 or l=0.\n\nNow, if d=0, then h'(0)=0.\n\nBut h is strictly increasing, so h'(x) >0 for all x.\n\nBut if h'(0)=0, that would contradict h being strictly increasing, because h' should be positive.\n\nWait, is that necessarily a contradiction?\n\nWait, actually, h could have h'(0)=0 and still be strictly increasing.\n\nFor example, h(x) = x^3 is strictly increasing, but h'(0)=0.\n\nSo, it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps h'(x) approaches 0 as x approaches negative infinity.\n\nBut if l=0, then h'(x) approaches 0 as x approaches negative infinity.\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nBut I need to find a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the second derivative.\n\nDifferentiate both sides of h'(h(x)) * h'(x) = e^x:\n\nUsing product rule and chain rule:\n\nh''(h(x)) * (h'(x))^2 + h'(h(x)) * h''(x) = e^x.\n\nThis seems too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the limit as x approaches infinity.\n\nAs x approaches infinity, h(x) approaches infinity, and e^x approaches infinity.\n\nBut this might not lead directly to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the function h(x) - e^{h^{-1}(x)}.\n\nWait, that seems too vague.\n\nAnother idea: since h is a continuous bijection from R to (0, infinity), it has a continuous inverse.\n\nNow, consider the function k(x) = h^{-1}(e^x).\n\nFrom earlier, h(x) = k(x).\n\nSo, h(x) = h^{-1}(e^x).\n\nNow, since h and h^{-1} are both strictly increasing, and e^x is strictly increasing, perhaps this equality leads to a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps consider that h(x) = h^{-1}(e^x).\n\nSince h and h^{-1} are strictly increasing, their composition should be strictly increasing.\n\nBut h(x) = h^{-1}(e^x), and e^x is strictly increasing, so h(x) is strictly increasing.\n\nThis is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h(h(x)) = e^x implies that h is its own inverse up to some transformation.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider plotting h and e^x and see if there's a contradiction.\n\nBut since both are continuous and strictly increasing, their graphs don't necessarily contradict each other.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the number of times h crosses y = e^x.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the function h o h - e^x.\n\nThis function is zero for all x, since h(h(x)) = e^x.\n\nBut since h is continuous, perhaps consider the intermediate value theorem applied to this function.\n\nBut it's already zero everywhere.\n\nWait, maybe consider that h(h(x)) is always positive, since e^x is always positive.\n\nBut h(x) is always positive, since h maps to (0, infinity).\n\nWait, but h(h(x)) is e^x, which is positive, so that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h(x) must be positive for all x, but h(h(x)) = e^x, which covers all positive real numbers.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is a homeomorphism from R to (0, infinity), since it's a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse.\n\nBut (0, infinity) is not closed, while R is, which might lead to a contradiction.\n\nWait, in topology, a homeomorphism preserves the topological properties, such as openness and closedness.\n\nBut R is closed and (0, infinity) is not closed in the standard topology on R.\n\nTherefore, there cannot be a homeomorphism between R and (0, infinity).\n\nWait, but h is a homeomorphism from R to (0, infinity), which would imply that (0, infinity) is homeomorphic to R.\n\nBut this is known to be true; for example, the function h(x) = e^x is a homeomorphism from R to (0, infinity).\n\nWait, but in this case, h is not exp(x), because h(h(x)) = e^x, which is different.\n\nBut the point is that there can be a homeomorphism between R and (0, infinity), so this doesn't lead to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the growth rates again.\n\nSince h is continuous and strictly increasing, with h(x) >x for all x, perhaps consider asymptotic behavior.\n\nAs x approaches infinity, h(x) must grow faster than x but slower than e^x.\n\nBut h(h(x)) = e^x, so if h(x) grows like some function faster than x but slower than e^x, then h(h(x)) would grow even faster.\n\nBut e^x grows faster than any polynomial or exponential with base less than e.\n\nWait, maybe consider taking logarithms.\n\nIf h(h(x)) = e^x, then taking natural log of both sides, assuming h(x) is positive, which it is, we get ln(h(h(x))) = x.\n\nSo, ln(h(h(x))) = x.\n\nThis is interesting.\n\nNow, perhaps consider that h(x) grows exponentially, but that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h(x) is convex or concave.\n\nBut I don't have enough information about the second derivative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that h is invertible and continuous, so it's monotonic.\n\nWe already established it's strictly increasing.\n\nNow, perhaps consider that h is convex or concave, but without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider specific values.\n\nWe have h(0) = a, h(a) =1, h(1) = e^a.\n\nNow, since h is strictly increasing, and h(a) =1, and h(1) = e^a, and a is between 0 and 1, as established earlier.\n\nNow, e^a is between 1 and e.\n\nSo, h(1) = e^a >1.\n\nAlso, h(a) =1.\n\nSince h is strictly increasing, and a <1, h(a) =1 < h(1) = e^a.\n\nThis is consistent.\n\nNow, perhaps consider h(e^a) = e.\n\nSince e^a >1, and h is strictly increasing, h(e^a) = e > e^a, since e > e^a would require a <1, which it is.\n\nWait, e^a < e when a <1, which is true.\n\nSo, h(e^a) = e > e^a.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is its own inverse up to some transformation.\n\nBut I don't see a direct way to use that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is a solution to the functional equation h(h(x)) = e^x, and try to find a property that no continuous function can satisfy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the Fourier transform or some other transform, but that seems too advanced for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the function iterates and see if they lead to a contradiction.\n\nFor example, h^3(x) = h(h(h(x))) = h(e^x).\n\nSimilarly, h^4(x) = h(h(e^x)) = e^{e^x}.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I don't see an immediate contradiction here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the function h(x) - e^{h^{-1}(x)} and look for zeros, but this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is a solution to the Schr\u00f6der's equation or Abel's equation, which deals with functional iterates.\n\nBut I don't have enough knowledge about those equations to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is conjugate to the exponential function.\n\nBut again, this might not lead to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is not differentiable, but the problem only requires continuity.\n\nSo, differentiability is not guaranteed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is infinitely differentiable, but that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the function h(x) - e^{h^{-1}(x)} and show that it can't be zero for all x, but this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is a homeomorphism, and consider the topological properties, but as earlier, that doesn't lead to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the function h o h - e^x, which is zero for all x, and try to derive a property that leads to a contradiction.\n\nBut since it's zero everywhere, it's always zero, so no contradiction there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the behavior of h at specific points and try to find inconsistent requirements.\n\nFor example, at x=0, h(h(0)) =1.\n\nAt x=a, h(1) = e^a.\n\nAt x=1, h(e^a) = e.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nPerhaps try to build a sequence and see if it leads to a contradiction.\n\nDefine a sequence by x_0 =0, x_1 = h(0) =a, x_2 = h(a) =1, x_3 = h(1) = e^a, x_4 = h(e^a) = e, x_5 = h(e) = e^{e^a}, and so on.\n\nNow, perhaps consider that this sequence must be consistent with h being continuous and strictly increasing.\n\nBut I don't see an immediate contradiction here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is its own functional square root, and see if that leads to any properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the function h o h o ... o h (n times) and see if that leads to a contradiction.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is a solution to a differential equation and see if that leads to a contradiction.\n\nBut earlier attempts at differentiating didn't lead to a useful contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is not unique, but the problem is only to show that no continuous h exists, so uniqueness might not be relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is bounded below by x, since h(x) >x for all x, and see if that leads to a contradiction.\n\nBut earlier, we saw that h(x) approaches 0 as x approaches negative infinity, while x approaches negative infinity, so h(x) >x still holds.\n\nThis doesn't lead to an immediate contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is unbounded above, since h approaches infinity as x approaches infinity.\n\nSimilarly, h is bounded below by 0.\n\nBut e^x is unbounded above and approaches 0 as x approaches negative infinity.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is convex or concave, but without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is infinitely differentiable, but again, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is analytic, but again, that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is nowhere analytic, but that might not lead to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is a homeomorphism, and consider the properties of homeomorphisms, but as earlier, that doesn't lead to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is a monotonic function, and consider properties of monotonic functions, but again, no immediate contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is not Lipschitz continuous, but I don't know if that's relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is uniformly continuous, but again, that might not lead to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is not differentiable at some points, but the problem only requires continuity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is differentiable only at certain points, but again, that might not lead to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is a strictly increasing homeomorphism from R to (0, infinity), and see if such a function can satisfy h(h(x)) = e^x.\n\nBut I don't see a direct contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is not invertible, but earlier, we saw that h is bijective, so it is invertible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is its own inverse, but earlier, that didn't seem to hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is an involution, meaning h(h(x)) =x, but in this case, h(h(x)) = e^x, which is not equal to x, so h is not an involution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is a half-iterate of e^x, and see if such a half-iterate can be continuous.\n\nBut I don't have enough knowledge about functional square roots to conclude that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is uniquely determined by its values at certain points, but I don't see how to use that here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is periodic, but since h is strictly increasing, it can't be periodic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h has no real fixed points, since h(x) >x for all x, but e^x has no real fixed points either, so that might not lead to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is bounded below by x and above by e^x, but h(h(x)) = e^x, which might not directly lead to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is log-convex or log-concave, but I don't know enough about that to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the Lambert W function, but that seems too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the natural logarithm, but again, that might not lead to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the inverse of e^x, but e^x is not invertible onto its entire range without restricting the domain.\n\nWait, e^x is invertible from R to (0, infinity), with inverse ln(x).\n\nBut h is not the inverse of e^x, since h(h(x)) = e^x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the square root of e^x in some sense, but again, that might not lead to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the function sqrt(e^x), but sqrt(e^x) = e^{x/2}, which is not equal to h(x).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the function e^{sqrt(x)}, but that's not defined for all real x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the function e^{k x} for some k, but as earlier, that leads to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the function k e^{k x}, but again, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the function x + ln(x), but that's not defined for all real x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the function x + e^x, but again, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the function e^x -x, but again, that might not lead to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the function e^x +x, but again, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the function e^{e^x}, but that grows too fast.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the function ln(e^x +1), but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the function arctan(x), but arctan(x) is bounded, while h is not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the function sinh(x) or cosh(x), but again, that might not lead to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the function e^{k x} + c, but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the function e^{k x} + k x, but again, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the function e^{k x} - k x, but again, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the function e^{k x} * x, but again, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the function e^{k x} / x, but that's not defined for x=0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the function e^{k x} + ln(x), but again, that's not defined for all real x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that h is related to the
