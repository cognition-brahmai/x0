Roads, routinely repaved, reflect radiant rainbows when rays refract through residual rain. Relaxed, folks read romance novels, savoring rich, robust coffee. Restaurants, resplendent with rustic decor, offer renowned, regional recipes. Recreation areas remain relatively remote, as residents revel indoors, reminiscing about past rendezvous under rainy skies.RAINT\n"
