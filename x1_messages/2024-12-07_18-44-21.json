        "content": "Let's calculate the total cost of the purchase. The store sells apples for $0.50 each and oranges for $0.75 each. The person buys 8 apples and 6 oranges.\n\nFirst, I'll find out how much the apples cost in total. Since each apple is $0.50 and they buy 8 apples, I'll multiply 0.50 by 8.\n\n0.50 * 8 = 4.00\n\nSo, the apples cost $4.00 in total.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total cost of the oranges. Each orange is $0.75, and they buy 6 oranges, so I'll multiply 0.75 by 6.\n\n0.75 * 6 = 4.50\n\nTherefore, the oranges cost $4.50 in total.\n\nNow, to find the total cost of both the apples and the oranges, I'll add the two amounts together.\n\n4.00 + 4.50 = 8.50\n\nSo, the total cost of the purchase is $8.50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8.50} \\]"
