        "content": "So if I have a cube and each side is 4 centimeters long, how do I find out how much space is inside it? I think that's what volume measures, right? The space inside the object. So for a cube, all sides are equal, which makes it easier, I guess.\n\nI remember that to find the volume of a cube, I need to multiply the length by the width by the height. But since all sides are the same in a cube, it should be just side times side times side, which is the same as side cubed. So if the side is 4 centimeters, the volume should be 4 cubed.\n\nLet me calculate that. 4 times 4 is 16, and then 16 times 4 is 64. So is the volume 64 cubic centimeters? That sounds right. But I should make sure I'm using the correct units. Since the side length is in centimeters, the volume should be in cubic centimeters, which is cm\u00b3.\n\nWait a minute, I've heard somewhere that volume can also be measured in milliliters, and 1 milliliter is equal to 1 cubic centimeter. So does that mean the volume is also 64 milliliters? But the question asks for cubic centimeters, so maybe I should stick with cm\u00b3.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll double-check the formula for the volume of a cube. Yes, it's V = a\u00b3, where 'a' is the length of any side of the cube. So in this case, a = 4 cm, so V = 4\u00b3 = 64 cm\u00b3.\n\nI think that's the answer. But maybe I should consider if there's any other way to look at this. For example, if I were to fill the cube with water, how much water would it hold? I think that would also be 64 milliliters, since 1 cm\u00b3 of water is 1 milliliter.\n\nBut again, since the question specifies cubic centimeters, I should probably go with 64 cm\u00b3.\n\nIs there any other aspect to this? Like, does the cube's volume change if it's made of a different material? I don't think so, because volume is just the space the object occupies, regardless of what it's made of.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it enough. The volume of the cube is 64 cubic centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{64} \\]"
