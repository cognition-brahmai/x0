        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train that goes from Station X to Station Y at 80 km/h and comes back at 100 km/h. The total time for the whole trip is 10 hours, and we need to find the distance between X and Y.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. We need to find the distance between two stations, X and Y, given the speeds in both directions and the total time for the round trip.\n\nLet's denote the distance between X and Y as D kilometers.\n\nNow, when the train goes from X to Y at 80 km/h, the time taken for this part of the journey can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, time from X to Y, let's call it T1, is:\n\nT1 = D / 80 hours\n\nSimilarly, on the return journey from Y to X at 100 km/h, the time taken, T2, is:\n\nT2 = D / 100 hours\n\nThe total time for the round trip is given as 10 hours, so:\n\nT1 + T2 = 10\n\nSubstituting the expressions for T1 and T2:\n\nD/80 + D/100 = 10\n\nNow, to solve for D, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 80 and 100. The least common multiple (LCM) of 80 and 100 is 400.\n\nSo, let's rewrite the equation with the common denominator:\n\n(D/80)*(5/5) + (D/100)*(4/4) = 10\n\nThis gives:\n\n(5D)/400 + (4D)/400 = 10\n\nNow, combine the fractions:\n\n(5D + 4D)/400 = 10\n\n(9D)/400 = 10\n\nNow, solve for D:\n\n9D = 10 * 400\n\n9D = 4000\n\nD = 4000 / 9\n\nD \u2248 444.44 kilometers\n\nSo, the distance between Station X and Station Y is approximately 444.44 kilometers.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nD/80 + D/100 = 10\n\nFind a common denominator for 80 and 100, which is 400.\n\nSo, D/80 = (5D)/400\n\nAnd D/100 = (4D)/400\n\nAdding them up: (5D + 4D)/400 = 10\n\n9D/400 = 10\n\nThen, 9D = 4000\n\nD = 4000 / 9\n\nD \u2248 444.44 km\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of average speed for the entire trip to find the distance.\n\nThe formula for average speed is total distance divided by total time.\n\nIn this case, the total distance for the round trip is 2D (going and returning).\n\nThe total time is 10 hours.\n\nSo, average speed = 2D / 10\n\nBut average speed can also be calculated using the harmonic mean of the two speeds, since it's a round trip with different speeds in each direction.\n\nThe formula for the average speed for a round trip is:\n\nAverage speed = (2 * speed1 * speed2) / (speed1 + speed2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nAverage speed = (2 * 80 * 100) / (80 + 100) = (16000) / (180) \u2248 88.89 km/h\n\nNow, since average speed = total distance / total time,\n\n88.89 = 2D / 10\n\n88.89 = 2D / 10\n\nMultiply both sides by 10:\n\n888.9 = 2D\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nD = 444.45 km\n\nThis matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, the distance between Station X and Station Y is approximately 444.44 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{444.44} \\]"
