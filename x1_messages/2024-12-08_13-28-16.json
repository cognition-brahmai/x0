        "content": "So there are 10 people in a room, and each person knows exactly three other people there. We need to figure out how many friendships that makes in total. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a friendship means here. If person A knows person B, does that mean person B also knows person A? I think so, because friendship is usually mutual. So, each friendship involves two people who know each other.\n\nNow, each of the 10 people knows exactly three others. So, if I just multiply 10 by 3, that would give me 30\u2014 but that counts each friendship twice, because each friendship is between two people. So, to get the actual number of unique friendships, I should divide that by 2.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal friendships = (10 people * 3 friendships per person) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15 friendships.\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should think about it differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that each friendship connects two people. So, if I have 10 people, and each has three connections, but each connection is shared between two people, then yes, dividing by 2 makes sense.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Imagine drawing a graph where each person is a node, and each friendship is an edge connecting two nodes. In this graph, each node has three edges coming out of it, because each person knows three others.\n\nIn graph theory, the sum of the degrees (number of edges per node) is equal to twice the number of edges. That's because each edge contributes to the degree of two nodes.\n\nSo, sum of degrees = 10 people * 3 = 30.\n\nTherefore, number of edges (friendships) = 30 / 2 = 15.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any overlaps or exceptions.\n\nIs it possible for someone to know the same person multiple times? I don't think so, because knowing someone is a binary thing\u2014 you either know them or you don't. So, no duplicates there.\n\nAlso, no one knows themselves, I assume, so no self-loops.\n\nAdditionally, since each person knows exactly three others, there are no\u5b64\u5c9bs or people with more or fewer connections.\n\nSo, in this perfectly balanced setup, with 10 people each having three connections, the total number of unique friendships should indeed be 15.\n\nLet me try to think of a real-world example to see if this makes sense.\n\nSuppose you have a book club with 10 members, and each member only knows three other members. If you were to map out who knows whom, you'd expect a certain network structure where each person is connected to three others.\n\nBut without any additional information about how these connections are arranged, the calculation should hold.\n\nWait, but is there a way to arrange such a network where each person knows exactly three others? Is such a configuration possible?\n\nIn graph theory terms, is there a 10-node graph where each node has degree three?\n\nI think so. Such graphs are called 3-regular graphs. And yes, they exist for an even number of nodes.\n\nWait, actually, for regular graphs of odd degree, the number of nodes must be even. But in this case, degree is three, which is odd, and there are 10 nodes, which is even, so it's possible.\n\nIn fact, the Petersen graph is a well-known example of a 3-regular graph with 10 nodes.\n\nSo, theoretically, this setup is possible.\n\nTherefore, based on both logical reasoning and graph theory, the number of friendships in the room is 15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
