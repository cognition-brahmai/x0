        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many boys and girls are in the class.\n\nThe class has 40 students, and 60% of them are boys. So, the number of boys is:\n\nNumber of boys = 60% of 40 = 0.60 \u00d7 40 = 24 boys\n\nNow, the remaining students are girls:\n\nNumber of girls = Total students - Number of boys = 40 - 24 = 16 girls\n\nNext, we need to find out how many boys and girls passed the exam.\n\n75% of the boys passed the exam, so:\n\nNumber of boys who passed = 75% of 24 = 0.75 \u00d7 24 = 18 boys\n\n80% of the girls passed the exam, so:\n\nNumber of girls who passed = 80% of 16 = 0.80 \u00d7 16 = 12.8\n\nWait, we can't have a fraction of a student, can we? Maybe there's a mistake here. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nNumber of girls who passed = 80% of 16 = 0.80 \u00d7 16 = 12.8\n\nHmm, that doesn't make sense because we can't have 12.8 students. Perhaps the numbers given lead to a fractional student, which isn't practical. But maybe I should consider that the percentages are approximate, or perhaps I made an error earlier.\n\nLet me verify the initial numbers.\n\nTotal students: 40\n\nPercentage of boys: 60%\n\nNumber of boys: 0.60 \u00d7 40 = 24\n\nNumber of girls: 40 - 24 = 16\n\nPercentage of boys passing: 75%\n\nNumber of boys passing: 0.75 \u00d7 24 = 18\n\nPercentage of girls passing: 80%\n\nNumber of girls passing: 0.80 \u00d7 16 = 12.8\n\nHmm, still getting 12.8. Maybe the problem expects us to round it off. Let's round it to 13 girls passing.\n\nSo, total passing students = Number of boys who passed + Number of girls who passed = 18 + 13 = 31\n\nNow, the overall passing percentage is:\n\nOverall passing percentage = (Total passing students / Total students) \u00d7 100 = (31 / 40) \u00d7 100\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n31 divided by 40 is 0.775\n\n0.775 multiplied by 100 is 77.5%\n\nSo, the overall passing percentage is 77.5%\n\nBut wait, I rounded 12.8 to 13. Maybe I should consider it as 12.8 for a more accurate calculation.\n\nLet's do that:\n\nTotal passing students = 18 boys + 12.8 girls = 30.8 students\n\nOverall passing percentage = (30.8 / 40) \u00d7 100\n\n30.8 divided by 40 is 0.77\n\n0.77 multiplied by 100 is 77%\n\nSo, the overall passing percentage is 77%\n\nBut since we can't have a fraction of a student, perhaps 77.5% is more appropriate if we round 12.8 to 13. However, in most cases, we should stick to the exact numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider the exact fractions.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nNumber of girls passing: 0.80 \u00d7 16 = 12.8\n\nPerhaps the problem wants us to consider that 12.8 is acceptable, and the overall percentage can have a decimal.\n\nSo, total passing students = 18 + 12.8 = 30.8\n\nOverall passing percentage = (30.8 / 40) \u00d7 100 = 77%\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should express it as 77.0%\n\nBut I think 77% is sufficient.\n\nSo, the overall passing percentage for the entire class is 77%\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{77\\%} \\]"
