        "content": "So the factory makes 500 units every day, but only 95% of them are good to use because of some defects. It's going to work for 30 days, and I need to find out how many usable units they'll have by the end of that time.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many usable units are produced each day. Since they make 500 units daily and 95% of them are usable, I can calculate the usable units per day by multiplying 500 by 95%.\n\nBut wait, percentages can be tricky. I remember that 95% is the same as 0.95 in decimal form. So, 500 units times 0.95 should give me the usable units per day.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 500 times 0.95. 500 times 0.9 is 450, and 500 times 0.05 is 25. So, 450 plus 25 equals 475. So, 475 usable units per day.\n\nNow, the factory works for 30 days. To find the total usable units over 30 days, I just need to multiply the daily usable units by the number of days.\n\nSo, 475 usable units per day times 30 days.\n\nLet's calculate that: 475 times 30. Well, 400 times 30 is 12,000, and 75 times 30 is 2,250. So, adding those together, 12,000 plus 2,250 equals 14,250.\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce 14,250 usable units over 30 days.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should verify this another way. Let's see:\n\nTotal units produced in 30 days would be 500 units per day times 30 days, which is 15,000 units.\n\nThen, if only 95% are usable, I can calculate 95% of 15,000.\n\nAgain, 95% is 0.95, so 15,000 times 0.95.\n\nLet's do that math: 15,000 times 0.95. 15,000 times 0.9 is 13,500, and 15,000 times 0.05 is 750. Adding those together, 13,500 plus 750 equals 14,250.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like 14,250 usable units will be produced in 30 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14250} \\]"
