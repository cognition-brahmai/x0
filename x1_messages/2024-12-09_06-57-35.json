Friends are like that extra pillow on your bed \u2013 you don't need them, but man, do they make life so much cozier!\n\nRemember that time when Chandler was all, \"Could you believe that?\" and Monica was all, \"No, I couldn't possibly!\" That's friendship right there. It's about being there for each other through thick and thin, even when they're driving you crazy with their jokes or their obsessive cleaning.\n\nFriends are like family, but better because you actually choose them. You know, like how I chose Gunther as my friend. Okay, maybe not the best example, but you get my point. They're people who accept you for who you are, even if you eat pizza with your hands or have a thing for waiters.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the support system. When Ross was going through his divorce, or when Phoebe was dealing with her past, their friends were there to listen, to joke, to make them feel less alone. It's that shoulder to cry on, or in my case, a ear to listen to my fabulous stories.\n\nPlus, friends make the good times even better. Parties, game nights, road trips \u2013 all way more fun with friends. Who else would you share your favorite quotes from Vito Corleone or discuss the merits of different types of meat with?\n\nSo, in conclusion, friendship is like a security blanket for adults. It's comforting, sometimes messy, and absolutely essential for a happy life. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find some breadsticks. Friends always need food, right?\n\n#FriendsForever #JoeyLove"
