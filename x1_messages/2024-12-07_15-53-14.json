        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Node.js script that connects to a MongoDB database, creates a \"users\" collection, and inserts three sample user documents with name, email, and age fields. I'm going to walk through this step by step, assuming that I have some basic knowledge of Node.js and MongoDB, but I'll explain everything as clearly as possible.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up a new Node.js project. If I don't already have one, I'll create a new directory for this project and initialize it with npm.\n\nSo, let's say I open my terminal and do:\n\n```bash\nmkdir mongo-node-example\ncd mongo-node-example\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nThis creates a new directory, changes to it, and initializes a new Node.js project with default settings.\n\nNext, I need to install the MongoDB driver for Node.js. This is the package that allows my Node.js application to connect to and interact with a MongoDB database. The official MongoDB driver is called `mongodb`, so I'll install that using npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install mongodb\n```\n\nNow, with the driver installed, I can start writing my script. I'll create a new JavaScript file, maybe call it `insertUsers.js`. This will be the script that runs our operations.\n\nBefore I start coding, I should have a MongoDB database to connect to. For this example, I'll assume that I have a MongoDB server running locally on the default port (27017). If I have a remote MongoDB instance, I'll need to adjust the connection string accordingly.\n\nAlright, let's open `insertUsers.js` and start coding.\n\nFirst, I need to import the MongoDB client from the `mongodb` package:\n\n```javascript\nconst { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');\n```\n\nNext, I need to define the connection URL. Since I'm connecting to a local MongoDB server, the URL will be:\n\n```javascript\nconst url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';\n```\n\nI also need to specify the name of the database I want to use. Let's call it `mydatabase` for this example:\n\n```javascript\nconst dbName = 'mydatabase';\n```\n\nNow, I'll create a function to perform the database operations. It's a good practice to wrap database operations in a function to keep the code organized.\n\n```javascript\nasync function main() {\n  const client = new MongoClient(url);\n\n  try {\n    await client.connect();\n    console.log('Connected successfully to server');\n\n    const db = client.db(dbName);\n\n    // Create users collection\n    const collection = db.collection('users');\n\n    // Insert sample users\n    const users = [\n      { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com', age: 30 },\n      { name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@example.com', age: 25 },\n      { name: 'Charlie', email: 'charlie@example.com', age: 35 }\n    ];\n\n    const result = await collection.insertMany(users);\n    console.log(`${result.insertedCount} users inserted`);\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(err);\n  } finally {\n    await client.close();\n  }\n}\n\nmain().catch(console.error);\n```\n\nLet me explain what's happening here:\n\n1. **Connecting to the database:** I create a new `MongoClient` instance with the connection URL and then call `connect()` to establish a connection.\n\n2. **Accessing the database:** Once connected, I access the database named `mydatabase` using `client.db(dbName)`.\n\n3. **Creating the collection:** I get a reference to the \"users\" collection using `db.collection('users')`. If this collection doesn't exist, MongoDB will create it automatically when I insert documents into it.\n\n4. **Inserting documents:** I define an array of user objects, each with name, email, and age fields. Then, I use `collection.insertMany()` to insert these documents into the \"users\" collection.\n\n5. **Error handling:** I wrap the operations in a try-catch block to handle any errors that might occur during connection or insertion.\n\n6. **Closing the connection:** Finally, I make sure to close the client connection using `client.close()`.\n\nThat's pretty much it! To run this script, I can use Node.js from the command line:\n\n```bash\nnode insertUsers.js\n```\n\nIf everything is set up correctly, this should connect to the MongoDB server, create the \"users\" collection (if it doesn't exist), insert the three sample user documents, and then close the connection.\n\nJust to make sure everything worked, I can check my MongoDB database. If I use the MongoDB shell, I can switch to the `mydatabase` database and list the collections:\n\n```bash\nmongo\nuse mydatabase\nshow collections\n```\n\nI should see \"users\" listed. Then, I can find the inserted documents:\n\n```bash\ndb.users.find().pretty()\n```\n\nThis should display the three user documents I inserted.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm using a MongoDB GUI tool like Compass, I can connect to the database and browse the \"users\" collection to verify that the documents are there.\n\nAlright, that's my approach to completing this task. It's a straightforward way to connect to a MongoDB database from Node.js and perform some basic operations like creating a collection and inserting documents.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo accomplish the task of connecting to a MongoDB database using a Node.js script, creating a \"users\" collection, and inserting three sample user documents with name, email, and age fields, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Ensure you have Node.js installed.\n- Have a running MongoDB server (locally or remotely).\n\n### Solution Code\n\n1. **Initialize the Node.js project:**\n   ```bash\n   mkdir mongo-node-example\n   cd mongo-node-example\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n\n2. **Install the MongoDB driver for Node.js:**\n   ```bash\n   npm install mongodb\n   ```\n\n3. **Create the script (`insertUsers.js`):**\n   ```javascript\n   const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');\n\n   const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';\n   const dbName = 'mydatabase';\n\n   async function main() {\n     const client = new MongoClient(url);\n\n     try {\n       await client.connect();\n       console.log('Connected successfully to server');\n\n       const db = client.db(dbName);\n\n       // Create users collection\n       const collection = db.collection('users');\n\n       // Insert sample users\n       const users = [\n         { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com', age: 30 },\n         { name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@example.com', age: 25 },\n         { name: 'Charlie', email: 'charlie@example.com', age: 35 }\n       ];\n\n       const result = await collection.insertMany(users);\n       console.log(`${result.insertedCount} users inserted`);\n     } catch (err) {\n       console.error(err);\n     } finally {\n       await client.close();\n     }\n   }\n\n   main().catch(console.error);\n   ```\n\n4. **Run the script:**\n   ```bash\n   node insertUsers.js\n   ```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Step 1:** Set up a new Node.js project directory and initialize it.\n- **Step 2:** Install the official MongoDB driver for Node.js.\n- **Step 3:** Write a script to connect to the MongoDB server, select the database, create a collection, insert sample user documents, and handle connections properly.\n- **Step 4:** Execute the script to perform the operations.\n\nThis script ensures that you connect to your MongoDB server, create a collection if it doesn't exist, and insert the specified user documents. You can verify the insertion by checking your MongoDB database using the shell or a GUI tool like Compass.\n"
