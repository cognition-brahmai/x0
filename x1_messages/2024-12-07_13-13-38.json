        "content": "So there's this problem here about probabilities and colored balls. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it. There's a box with 8 red balls and 6 blue balls. So, in total, there are 8 plus 6, which is 14 balls in the box. Now, the question is, if you pick one ball at random, what's the probability that it's a red ball?\n\nOkay, probability. I remember that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is picking a red ball, and the total outcomes are all the balls in the box.\n\nSo, the number of red balls is 8, and the total number of balls is 14. Therefore, the probability should be 8 divided by 14. But I think that can be simplified. If I divide both numerator and denominator by 2, I get 4 over 7. So, the probability is 4/7.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check. Total balls: 8 red + 6 blue = 14 balls. Probability of picking red: number of red balls divided by total balls, which is 8/14. Simplifying that fraction by dividing both top and bottom by 2 gives me 4/7. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about it another way. The probability of picking a blue ball would be 6/14, which simplifies to 3/7. And if I add the probabilities of picking red and blue, it should equal 1, because those are the only two colors available.\n\nSo, 4/7 plus 3/7 equals 7/7, which is 1. That makes sense. So, my initial calculation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of percentages. 4/7 is approximately 0.5714, which is about 57.14%. So, there's roughly a 57.14% chance of picking a red ball. But the question didn't ask for a percentage, so I'll stick with the fraction.\n\nI think that's the answer. Probability of picking a red ball is 4/7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{7}} \\]"
