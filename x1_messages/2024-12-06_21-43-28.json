        "content": "Classical mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the motion of bodies under the influence of forces. This branch of physics is often contrasted with quantum mechanics, which deals with phenomena on a very small scale, such as atoms and subatomic particles. Electromagnetism, on the other hand, is the study of the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. This force is responsible for phenomena such as light and magnetism. Based on the paragraph, which branch of physics is responsible for the study of light?\nA. Classical mechanics\nB. Quantum mechanics\nC. Thermodynamics\nD. Electromagnetism\nE. None of the above"
