        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the train starts at Town A, goes to Town B, then back to Town A, and finally to Town C. The distance from A to B is 150 miles, and from A to C is 200 miles. The average speed for the entire trip is 60 mph, and we need to find out how long the whole journey took.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total distance the train traveled. Let's see:\n\n- From A to B: 150 miles\n\n- From B back to A: another 150 miles\n\n- Then from A to C: 200 miles\n\nSo, total distance is 150 + 150 + 200 = 500 miles.\n\nNow, the average speed is 60 mph. To find the total time, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTime = 500 miles / 60 mph\n\nThat gives approximately 8.333 hours. But let's be precise. 500 divided by 60 is 8 hours and 20 minutes, because 0.333 of an hour is 20 minutes (since 0.333 * 60 minutes = 20 minutes).\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there's another way to look at this. Maybe there's something about the average speed that I'm missing.\n\nLet me think again. The train goes from A to B at 150 miles, back to A at 150 miles, and then to C at 200 miles. Total distance is indeed 500 miles. Average speed is 60 mph, so time should be total distance divided by average speed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the speeds between different legs are different, but the problem says the average speed for the entire trip is 60 mph. So, I think the approach is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the time for each leg separately and then add them up, but since the average speed is given for the entire trip, it's simpler to use the total distance and the average speed.\n\nSo, time = 500 miles / 60 mph = 8.333 hours, which is 8 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8 \\text{ hours and } 20 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
