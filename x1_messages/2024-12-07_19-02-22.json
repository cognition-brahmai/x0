        "content": "So the store is offering a discount where the price decreases by 10% each day for five consecutive days, and the original price is $100. I need to find out what the final price would be after these five days.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the discount works. A 10% discount each day means that each day the price is reduced by 10% of its current value. So, it's not just a single 10% discount applied once, but rather a compounded discount over five days.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nStarting with $100 on day one, a 10% discount would reduce the price by $10, making it $90.\n\nOn day two, another 10% discount is applied to the new price of $90. 10% of $90 is $9, so the price becomes $81.\n\nDay three: 10% discount on $81 is $8.10, so the price is now $72.90.\n\nDay four: 10% of $72.90 is $7.29, making the price $65.61.\n\nFinally, on day five: 10% of $65.61 is $6.561, so the price becomes $59.049.\n\nWait, that seems a bit tedious to calculate each day manually. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nI recall that when you have a repeated percentage decrease, it's similar to compounding interest, but in reverse. So, perhaps I can use the formula for exponential decay.\n\nThe formula for the final amount after a percentage decrease over multiple periods is:\n\nFinal Amount = Original Amount * (1 - rate)^number of periods\n\nIn this case, the original amount is $100, the rate is 10% (or 0.10), and the number of periods is 5 days.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nFinal Amount = 100 * (1 - 0.10)^5\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 1 - 0.10 = 0.90\n\nThen, 0.90 raised to the power of 5.\n\nI know that 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n0.9^3 = 0.729\n\n0.9^4 = 0.6561\n\n0.9^5 = 0.59049\n\nSo, Final Amount = 100 * 0.59049 = $59.049\n\nRounding to the nearest cent, that would be $59.05.\n\nBut earlier, when I calculated it day by day, I got $59.049, which matches this result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of geometric sequences. Each day, the price is multiplied by 0.90, so after five days, it's multiplied by 0.9^5, which again gives me the same result.\n\nI think using the formula Final Amount = Original Amount * (1 - rate)^periods is the most efficient way to calculate this.\n\nSo, the final price after five days would be approximately $59.05.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure.\n\nStarting at $100:\n\nDay 1: $100 - 10% = $100 - $10 = $90\n\nDay 2: $90 - 10% = $90 - $9 = $81\n\nDay 3: $81 - 10% = $81 - $8.10 = $72.90\n\nDay 4: $72.90 - 10% = $72.90 - $7.29 = $65.61\n\nDay 5: $65.61 - 10% = $65.61 - $6.561 = $59.049\n\nYes, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of multiplying by 0.9 each day:\n\n$100 * 0.9^5 = $100 * 0.59049 = $59.049\n\nSo, both methods give the same result.\n\nI think $59.05 is the correct final price after five days of 10% discounts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{59.05} \\]"
