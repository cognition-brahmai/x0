        "content": "The term you're referring to is \"refraction.\" Refraction occurs when light waves enter a new medium at an angle and change speed, causing them to bend or change direction. This is why a straw in a glass of water appears bent or broken; the light reflecting off the straw bends as it moves from the water (a denser medium) to the air (a less dense medium). The degree of bending depends on the indices of refraction of the two media involved and the angle at which the light hits the boundary between them. This principle is fundamental in optics and is utilized in various applications, including lenses and prisms."
