It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how quicksort works:\n\n1. **Choose a pivot element**: This can be any element from the array, but commonly it's the first or last element.\n\n2. **Partition the array**: Rearrange the array so that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position.\n\n3. **Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays**: Apply the same process to the sub-array of elements less than the pivot and the sub-array of elements greater than the pivot.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python. I'll write a function called `quicksort` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a sorted list.\n\n```python\ndef quicksort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    else:\n        pivot = arr[0]\n        less = [x for x in arr[1:] if x <= pivot]\n        greater = [x for x in arr[1:] if x > pivot]\n        return quicksort(less) + [pivot] + quicksort(greater)\n\n# Example usage:\nunsorted_list = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]\nsorted_list = quicksort(unsorted_list)\nprint(sorted_list)\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n\n- We first check if the list has one or no elements, in which case it's already sorted.\n\n- We choose the first element as the pivot.\n\n- We create two lists: `less` for elements less than or equal to the pivot, and `greater` for elements greater than the pivot.\n\n- We recursively sort the `less` and `greater` lists and combine them with the pivot to get the final sorted list.\n\nThis is a straightforward implementation of quicksort. There are more optimized versions that handle edge cases better, such as choosing a random pivot or using the median-of-three method, but this should give you a good starting point.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!"
