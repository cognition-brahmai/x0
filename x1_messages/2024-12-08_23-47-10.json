        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the zoo is planning to create a new exhibit featuring rare and endangered species. This is going to cost them $4 million upfront for habitat construction, acquiring the animals, and transporting them. Currently, the zoo makes $20 million a year, and they estimate that the new exhibit will increase visitor numbers by 10%. We need to figure out how much additional revenue this new exhibit will generate to cover that $4 million investment. Also, we have to think about the ongoing costs for maintaining and caring for these new animals.\n\nFirst, let's understand what additional revenue means in this context. It's the extra money the zoo will make because of the new exhibit, beyond what they're already making. The zoo expects a 10% increase in visitor numbers. So, if they currently have a certain number of visitors, they think that number will go up by 10% because people will want to see the new exhibit.\n\nBut to calculate the additional revenue, we need to know how much more money this 10% increase in visitors will bring in. Assuming that each visitor spends about the same amount as they do now, we can calculate the additional revenue.\n\nLet's see. Currently, the zoo has annual revenues of $20 million. If visitor numbers increase by 10%, that means they're getting 10% more visitors. So, the additional revenue would be 10% of the current revenue, right?\n\nWait, but that might not be entirely accurate. The revenue per visitor might not stay the same because the new exhibit could attract visitors who are more interested in seeing rare species, and they might spend more or less than the average visitor. But since we don't have specific information about that, maybe it's safe to assume that the revenue per visitor remains the same.\n\nSo, if the zoo currently has revenues of $20 million, and they expect a 10% increase in visitors, the additional revenue would be 10% of $20 million, which is $2 million.\n\nBut hold on, is that all? Do we need to consider anything else? Oh, yes, the ongoing maintenance and care costs for the new animals. The problem mentions that we should consider these costs associated with the new animals.\n\nSo, the additional revenue needs to not only cover the initial $4 million investment but also the ongoing costs of maintaining and caring for these animals.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify what these ongoing costs are. Maybe we need to assume something here or find a way to factor them into our calculation.\n\nPerhaps we should think about the payback period. How long will it take for the additional revenue to cover the initial investment and the ongoing costs?\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify a time frame for when this investment needs to be covered. Maybe it's expected to be covered over a certain number of years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zoo expects the additional revenue to cover the initial investment and ongoing costs in the first year itself. But that seems unlikely, given that the initial investment is $4 million and the additional revenue is $2 million, which is half of the investment. So, perhaps the expectation is that over two years, the additional revenue will cover the initial investment, assuming no ongoing costs.\n\nBut we have to consider ongoing costs, which aren't specified.\n\nMaybe we need to approach this differently. Perhaps calculate the additional revenue per year and then see how many years it would take to cover the initial investment, considering the ongoing costs.\n\nLet's try to outline the costs and revenues.\n\nInitial costs:\n\n- Habitat construction: part of $4 million\n\n- Animal acquisition: part of $4 million\n\n- Transportation: part of $4 million\n\nOngoing costs:\n\n- Maintenance of habitats\n\n- Care for the animals (food, veterinary costs, etc.)\n\nThese ongoing costs will persist year after year.\n\nAdditional revenue:\n\n- Increase in visitor numbers by 10%, leading to $2 million extra per year\n\nNow, to cover the initial investment, the additional revenue each year needs to cover both the portion of the initial investment and the ongoing costs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zoo is looking at a certain payback period, say, 5 years, and wants to know if the additional revenue will cover the initial investment and ongoing costs within that time frame.\n\nBut again, without a specified payback period, it's hard to give a precise answer.\n\nPerhaps the simplest approach is to calculate how much additional revenue is needed annually to cover the initial investment over a certain number of years, considering the ongoing costs.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the number of years or the ongoing costs, maybe we should just calculate the additional revenue based on the 10% increase in visitors and see how that relates to the $4 million investment.\n\nSo, with a 10% increase in visitors, leading to $2 million additional revenue per year, it would take $4 million / $2 million = 2 years to cover the initial investment, assuming no ongoing costs.\n\nBut we know there are ongoing costs, so actually, the net additional revenue per year would be $2 million minus the ongoing costs.\n\nIf we denote the ongoing costs as C per year, then the net additional revenue per year is $2 million - C.\n\nTo cover the initial investment of $4 million, it would take $4 million / ($2 million - C) years.\n\nBut since we don't know C, we can't calculate the exact number of years.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that the ongoing costs are covered by the additional revenue, then the net additional revenue would be $2 million - C, and this amount would contribute to covering the initial investment each year.\n\nBut without knowing C, we can't proceed further.\n\nMaybe the problem expects us to ignore the ongoing costs or assume they are already included in the current revenues and costs.\n\nBut that seems unlikely because introducing new species would likely have additional ongoing costs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the additional revenue without considering the ongoing costs, just to cover the initial investment.\n\nIn that case, with $2 million additional revenue per year, it would take 2 years to cover the $4 million investment.\n\nBut I feel like this is oversimplifying things, as ongoing costs are a significant factor in maintaining new exhibits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that the additional revenue will cover both the initial investment and the ongoing costs, and we need to find out what the ongoing costs are.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the additional revenue required to cover the investment, given the increase in visitor numbers and the ongoing costs.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet's consider that the additional revenue from the increased visitor numbers is $2 million per year, as calculated earlier.\n\nNow, to cover the initial investment of $4 million, it would take 2 years, assuming no ongoing costs.\n\nBut since there are ongoing costs, the net additional revenue per year would be less than $2 million.\n\nTherefore, it would take more than 2 years to cover the initial investment.\n\nBut without knowing the exact amount of ongoing costs, we can't calculate the exact number of years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to express the additional revenue required in terms of covering both the initial investment and the ongoing costs.\n\nIn that case, the additional revenue needed per year would be the initial investment divided by the number of years over which the investment is expected to be recovered, plus the ongoing costs.\n\nBut again, without knowing the expected payback period or the ongoing costs, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the additional revenue will cover both the initial investment and the ongoing costs in perpetuity.\n\nIn that case, the additional revenue needs to cover the ongoing costs each year, and the initial investment is a one-time cost that needs to be amortized over the expected lifespan of the exhibit.\n\nBut this seems too complicated for the given information.\n\nMaybe I should look at it differently.\n\nLet's consider that the additional revenue of $2 million per year is intended to cover the initial investment of $4 million and the ongoing costs.\n\nIf we assume that the ongoing costs are a certain amount per year, say C, then the net additional revenue per year available to pay back the initial investment is $2 million - C.\n\nTherefore, the number of years required to cover the initial investment is $4 million / ($2 million - C).\n\nWithout knowing C, we can't calculate a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that the ongoing costs are covered by the current revenues and costs, and the additional revenue is purely the $2 million from the increased visitor numbers, then it would take 2 years to cover the $4 million investment.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the additional revenue required to cover the initial investment and ongoing costs over a specific period, say, 5 years.\n\nIn that case, if the payback period is 5 years, then the annual additional revenue needed would be $4 million / 5 years = $800,000 per year, plus the ongoing costs per year.\n\nBut again, without knowing the ongoing costs, we can't give a precise answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to express the additional revenue required in terms of covering the initial investment and ongoing costs.\n\nFor example, if the ongoing costs are C per year, then the additional revenue R needed per year to cover the initial investment and ongoing costs over N years would be:\n\nR = ($4 million / N) + C\n\nBut since we don't have values for N and C, this is just a formula, not a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the additional revenue required assuming that the ongoing costs are a certain percentage of the initial investment or something like that.\n\nBut without specific guidance, that's speculative.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nPerhaps the problem simply wants the additional revenue from the increased visitor numbers, which is $2 million per year, and expects us to note that this will cover the $4 million investment in 2 years, ignoring ongoing costs.\n\nBut I feel like that's oversimplifying and not addressing the full picture.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a standard approach in zoo economics or exhibit planning that I'm not aware of, which would guide how to calculate this.\n\nIn real life, zoos would likely conduct a detailed financial analysis, including estimates of increased visitor numbers, additional revenue per visitor, costs of habitat construction, animal acquisition, transportation, and ongoing care and maintenance.\n\nThey would also consider the lifespan of the exhibit, potential changes in visitor behavior, and other factors.\n\nGiven that, they might calculate the net present value (NPV) of the additional revenues and costs over the exhibit's lifespan to determine if the investment is financially viable.\n\nBut for this problem, with the information provided, perhaps the expectation is a simpler calculation.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed with calculating the additional revenue from the increased visitor numbers.\n\nCurrent annual revenues: $20 million\n\nExpected increase in visitor numbers: 10%\n\nTherefore, additional revenue = 10% of $20 million = $2 million per year.\n\nNow, to cover the initial investment of $4 million, it would take $4 million / $2 million per year = 2 years, assuming no ongoing costs.\n\nHowever, since there are ongoing costs associated with the new animals, the net additional revenue per year would be less than $2 million, depending on the amount of these costs.\n\nTherefore, the actual time to cover the initial investment would be longer than 2 years, depending on the magnitude of the ongoing costs.\n\nWithout specific information on the ongoing costs, we can't calculate the exact additional revenue required or the payback period.\n\nIn conclusion, the additional revenue required to cover the initial investment, considering a 10% increase in visitor numbers leading to $2 million extra per year, would cover the $4 million investment in 2 years if there were no ongoing costs.\n\nHowever, given that there are ongoing maintenance and care costs for the new animals, the net additional revenue would be less than $2 million per year, extending the time needed to cover the initial investment.\n\nTo provide a precise answer, the ongoing costs need to be specified.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ million dollars additional revenue per year, covering the initial investment in 2 years without considering ongoing costs}} \\]"
