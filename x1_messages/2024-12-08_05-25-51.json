        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this step by step. First, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from selling all the units in the residential complex. Here's what we know:\n\n- There are 10 apartment buildings.\n\n- Each building has 50 units.\n\n- Each unit is 1,000 square feet.\n\n- The selling price is $300 per square foot.\n\nSo, to find the total revenue, we need to find out how many units there are in total, then find out how much each unit sells for, and finally multiply the number of units by the price per unit.\n\nFirst, total number of units:\n\n10 buildings * 50 units/building = 500 units\n\nNext, price per unit:\n\n1,000 sq ft * $300/sq ft = $300,000 per unit\n\nNow, total revenue:\n\n500 units * $300,000/unit = $150,000,000\n\nSo, the total revenue from selling all units is $150 million.\n\nNow, the second part is to determine the number of construction workers needed to complete the project within two years, given an average productivity rate of 500 square feet per worker per month, and accounting for holidays, sick days, and other time off.\n\nFirst, we need to find out the total construction volume, which is the total square footage of all units.\n\nTotal square footage:\n\n500 units * 1,000 sq ft/unit = 500,000 sq ft\n\nNext, we need to find out how much time is available for construction. The project is to be completed within two years. Assuming a standard month has about 30 days, two years would be:\n\n2 years * 12 months/year = 24 months\n\nNow, we need to consider the productivity rate per worker, which is 500 sq ft per worker per month.\n\nBut we also need to account for holidays, sick days, and other time off. Let's assume that a worker works about 20 days a month, considering holidays and time off. A standard month has about 20 working days, assuming 5 days a week and 4 weeks a month, minus holidays and time off.\n\nWait, but the productivity rate is given as 500 sq ft per worker per month, already accounting for average attendance and time off. So, perhaps we don't need to adjust further for holidays and sick days, as the productivity rate is an average that includes these factors.\n\nSo, if each worker can produce 500 sq ft per month, and we have 24 months to complete 500,000 sq ft, we can calculate the number of workers needed as follows:\n\nTotal square footage / (productivity per worker per month * number of months) = number of workers\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n500,000 sq ft / (500 sq ft/month(worker) * 24 months) = number of workers\n\nLet's do the math:\n\nDenominator: 500 * 24 = 12,000 sq ft per worker over 24 months\n\nNow, 500,000 / 12,000 = 41.666...\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a worker, we'll need to round up to 42 workers.\n\nHowever, it's often wise to have a buffer for various reasons, such as workers leaving or falling behind schedule. So, perhaps adding 10% extra workers would be advisable.\n\n10% of 42 is approximately 4.2, so adding 4 workers to the initial 42 gives us 46 workers.\n\nBut to keep it simple, and since 41.66 repeats, rounding up to 42 should suffice, assuming no major delays.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to be more precise, we could consider that 42 workers would complete 42 * 12,000 = 504,000 sq ft, which is slightly more than needed.\n\nSo, 42 workers should be sufficient to complete the project within two years.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check the assumptions here.\n\nWe assumed that the productivity rate of 500 sq ft per worker per month already accounts for holidays and time off. If that's the case, then our calculation is fine.\n\nHowever, if the 500 sq ft per month is based on full-time work without considering holidays and time off, then we need to adjust for the actual working days.\n\nLet's explore that possibility.\n\nAssume a worker works 20 days a month, and the productivity rate is 500 sq ft per month based on 20 days.\n\nIf we consider that the productivity rate already factors in the time off, then our initial calculation holds.\n\nBut if the productivity rate is based on a full month of work without considering time off, then we need to adjust it.\n\nWait, actually, if the productivity rate is 500 sq ft per worker per month, and that's an average that includes time off, then we don't need to adjust further.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial calculation, 42 workers should be sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that workers might not work all 24 months due to turnover or other reasons, it might be prudent to have a few extra workers.\n\nBut for the sake of this problem, I'll stick with 42 workers.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Total revenue: $150,000,000\n\n- Number of workers needed: 42\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150,000,000 \\text{ dollars and } 42 \\text{ workers}} \\]"
