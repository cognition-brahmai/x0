        "content": "Let's see. There are houses on both sides of the street: 10 on one side and 15 on the other, making a total of 25 houses. The problem says that even-numbered houses have red doors and odd-numbered houses have blue doors. Also, it's given that house number 1 has a blue door, which makes sense because 1 is odd.\n\nSo, first, I need to figure out how many houses have red doors. Since even-numbered houses have red doors, I need to count all the even numbers among the house numbers.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider that houses are numbered separately on each side of the street. The problem doesn't specify whether the numbering is continuous or separate for each side. Let's assume that houses on one side are numbered 1 to 10 and the other side 11 to 25, for a total of 25 houses.\n\nGiven that, house numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24 are even numbers. So, there are 12 even-numbered houses, meaning 12 houses have red doors.\n\nWait, but the problem says there are 10 houses on one side and 15 on the other, but it doesn't specify if the numbering is sequential from 1 to 25 or if each side has its own numbering scheme. Maybe the sides have separate numbering.\n\nLet me consider that possibility. If each side has its own numbering, then one side has houses 1 to 10, and the other has houses 1 to 15.\n\nIn that case, even-numbered houses on both sides would have red doors.\n\nSo, on the first side (10 houses): houses 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 have red doors. That's 5 houses.\n\nOn the second side (15 houses): houses 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 have red doors. That's 7 houses.\n\nTotal houses with red doors would be 5 + 7 = 12.\n\nWait, but earlier I assumed sequential numbering from 1 to 25 and got the same number, 12.\n\nHowever, the problem mentions \"houses on one side of the street and 15 houses on the other side,\" but it doesn't specify the numbering scheme. It's ambiguous.\n\nBut, given that house number 1 has a blue door, which is odd, and even-numbered houses have red doors, it's likely that numbering is such that odd numbers are on one side and even on the other.\n\nWait, but the problem says all even-numbered houses have red doors and odd have blue doors, regardless of which side they are on.\n\nBut, perhaps, the sides are divided based on odd and even numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all houses on one side are even-numbered and all on the other side are odd-numbered.\n\nBut the problem states that there are 10 houses on one side and 15 on the other, but it doesn't specify if the numbering is all odds on one side and evens on the other.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the sides have a mix of odd and even-numbered houses.\n\nWait, but if one side has 10 houses and the other has 15, that's a total of 25 houses.\n\nIf they are numbered from 1 to 25, with odd and even distributed among the sides.\n\nBut the problem seems to suggest that the sides have distinct sets of houses, but without specifying the numbering.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sides are divided such that one side has only odd-numbered houses and the other has only even-numbered houses.\n\nGiven that, if one side has 10 houses and the other has 15, and one side has only even-numbered houses and the other has only odd-numbered houses, then the side with even-numbered houses would have all red doors.\n\nBut, 10 even numbers would be houses 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20, but that's only up to 20, and there are 25 houses, so houses 21,22,23,24,25 would be on the other side.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approach is needed.\n\nLet's consider that regardless of which side they are on, even-numbered houses have red doors and odd have blue doors.\n\nGiven that, total houses are 25 (10 + 15).\n\nAmong numbers 1 to 25, there are 12 even numbers (2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24).\n\nTherefore, 12 houses have red doors.\n\nAlternatively, if sides have separate numbering, then:\n\nSide 1: houses 1-10\n\nEven numbers: 2,4,6,8,10 \u2192 5 red doors\n\nSide 2: houses 1-15\n\nEven numbers: 2,4,6,8,10,12,14 \u2192 7 red doors\n\nTotal: 5 + 7 = 12 red doors.\n\nSo, in either case, it seems there are 12 houses with red doors.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the problem says \"10 houses on one side and 15 houses on the other side.\" It doesn't specify if the houses are numbered from 1 to 25 sequentially or if each side has its own numbering sequence.\n\nIf each side has its own numbering, then side 1 has houses 1-10 and side 2 has houses 1-15.\n\nIn this case, even-numbered houses on both sides have red doors.\n\nSo, side 1: houses 2,4,6,8,10 \u2192 5 red doors\n\nSide 2: houses 2,4,6,8,10,12,14 \u2192 7 red doors\n\nTotal: 12 red doors.\n\nAlternatively, if houses are numbered from 1 to 25 sequentially, then even numbers are 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24 \u2192 12 red doors.\n\nSo, in both interpretations, the total number of houses with red doors is 12.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
