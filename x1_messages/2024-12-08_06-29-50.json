        "content": "So, the company originally has 20 employees, and they're planning to hire 5 more. You want to know what percentage increase that represents. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a percentage increase is. It's a way to express how much something has grown in relation to its original amount, expressed as a percentage.\n\nSo, the formula for percentage increase is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Increase}}{\\text{Original Amount}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the increase is 5 employees, and the original amount is 20 employees.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{5}{20} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nNow, let's do the math inside the parentheses first:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{20} = 0.25\n\\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to convert it to a percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.25 \\times 100 = 25\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, hiring 5 more employees represents a 25% increase in the number of employees.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to see what the new total number of employees will be after hiring the additional 5.\n\nNew total = original number + increase = 20 + 5 = 25 employees.\n\nNow, to find out what percentage 5 is of 20, which is essentially what we did above.\n\nAlternatively, you can think about the ratio of the new number to the original number.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{New Number}}{\\text{Original Number}} = \\frac{25}{20} = 1.25\n\\]\n\nTo express this ratio as a percentage, multiply by 100:\n\n\\[\n1.25 \\times 100 = 125\\%\n\\]\n\nThis means the new number is 125% of the original number. To find the increase, subtract 100% (the original percentage):\n\n\\[\n125\\% - 100\\% = 25\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, again, we get a 25% increase.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the company had, say, 100 employees and hired 25 more. The percentage increase would be:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{25}{100} \\right) \\times 100 = 25\\%\n\\]\n\nSame as above.\n\nWait a minute, is there a general rule here? It seems like dividing the increase by the original amount and then multiplying by 100 gives the percentage increase.\n\nLet me try another example. If the company had 50 employees and hired 10 more:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{10}{50} \\right) \\times 100 = 20\\%\n\\]\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nSo, applying the same formula to the original problem:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{5}{20} \\right) \\times 100 = 25\\%\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut let's consider if the question is asking for something else. Maybe it's a trick question or there's more to it.\n\nWait, perhaps the company has 20 employees and plans to hire 5 more, but maybe there are part-time employees or some other factors. However, the question seems straightforward: it's just about the number of employees increasing from 20 to 25.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the percentage of the new employees relative to the total number of employees after hiring.\n\nLet's explore that.\n\nIf the company hires 5 more employees, making the total 25, what percentage of the total are these new employees?\n\nThat would be:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{5}{25} \\right) \\times 100 = 20\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the new employees make up 20% of the total employees after hiring.\n\nBut the original question was about the percentage increase in the number of employees, which we already determined is 25%.\n\nI think the key here is to understand what is being asked: is it the percentage increase from the original number, or the percentage that the new employees represent of the total after hiring?\n\nBased on the wording, \"what percentage increase in the number of employees does this represent?\", it's about the increase from the original number, which is 25%.\n\nHowever, to cover all bases, maybe I should mention both.\n\nSo, hiring 5 more employees represents a 25% increase from the original 20 employees, and the new employees make up 20% of the total employee base after hiring.\n\nBut since the question specifically asks for the percentage increase in the number of employees, the answer should be 25%.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nPerhaps using proportions.\n\nIf 20 employees are 100%, then each employee represents 5% of the total (since 100% / 20 = 5%).\n\nHiring 5 more employees would be adding 5 employees, each representing 5%, so 5 x 5% = 25%.\n\nThat matches our earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if we think in terms of ratios.\n\nThe original number of employees is 20, and the increase is 5.\n\nSo, the ratio of increase to original amount is 5:20, which simplifies to 1:4.\n\nTo find the percentage, we can set up the proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{x}{100}\n\\]\n\nSolving for x:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{100}{4} = 25\\%\n\\]\n\nAgain, confirming the 25% increase.\n\nI think it's clear now that the answer is 25%.\n\nMaybe I should consider if the hiring is happening in phases or if there are any other variables, but the question seems straightforward.\n\nIt's important to read the question carefully and make sure I understand what is being asked.\n\nIn this case, it's a straightforward percentage increase calculation.\n\nSo, to summarize, the company is increasing its employees from 20 to 25, which is a 25% increase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25\\%} \\]"
