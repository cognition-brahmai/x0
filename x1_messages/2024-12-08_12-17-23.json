        "content": "So I have this problem here: a train goes from City A to City B at an average speed of 80 kilometers per hour, and the whole journey takes 3 hours and 45 minutes. I need to find out how far apart these two cities are. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nSo, if the speed is 80 kilometers per hour and the time is 3 hours and 45 minutes, I just need to plug these values into the formula.\n\nBut wait, the time is given in hours and minutes. I need to convert that into hours because the speed is in kilometers per hour. 3 hours is straightforward, but what about the 45 minutes?\n\nI know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so 45 minutes is 45/60 of an hour. Let me calculate that:\n\n\\[ 45 \\div 60 = 0.75 \\]\n\nSo, 45 minutes is 0.75 hours. Therefore, the total time in hours is:\n\n\\[ 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, I can plug the values into the distance formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 80 \\, \\text{km/h} \\times 3.75 \\, \\text{h} \\]\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\n\\[ 80 \\times 3.75 = 300 \\]\n\nSo, the distance between City A and City B is 300 kilometers.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way is to break down the time into hours and minutes separately and calculate the distance for each part then add them up.\n\nFirst, for the 3 hours:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance}_1 = 80 \\, \\text{km/h} \\times 3 \\, \\text{h} = 240 \\, \\text{km} \\]\n\nThen, for the 45 minutes, which is 0.75 hours:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance}_2 = 80 \\, \\text{km/h} \\times 0.75 \\, \\text{h} = 60 \\, \\text{km} \\]\n\nNow, add both distances:\n\n\\[ 240 \\, \\text{km} + 60 \\, \\text{km} = 300 \\, \\text{km} \\]\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, the distance is indeed 300 kilometers.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the entire time into minutes and then calculate the distance, but that might be more complicated since the speed is given in kilometers per hour. It's easier to keep the units consistent, which in this case is hours.\n\nSo, to summarize, the distance between City A and City B is 300 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
