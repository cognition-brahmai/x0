        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a clock that gains 5 minutes every hour. We need to find out how much time it will gain over a period of one day.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"gains 5 minutes every hour\" means. Does it mean that for every actual hour that passes, the clock ticks 65 minutes instead of 60? Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think differently.\n\nIf the clock gains 5 minutes every hour, that means that for every real hour, the clock adds an extra 5 minutes to its time. So, in one real hour, the clock shows 65 minutes instead of 60.\n\nBut to find out how much time it gains in a day, I need to calculate the total extra time the clock adds over 24 hours.\n\nLet's see:\n\n1. In one hour, the clock gains 5 minutes.\n\n2. In 24 hours, it would gain 24 times 5 minutes.\n\nSo, 24 hours * 5 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.\n\nTherefore, over a period of one day, the clock will gain 120 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of rates.\n\nThe clock gains 5 minutes per hour. There are 24 hours in a day.\n\nSo, the total gain in a day is 5 minutes/hour * 24 hours = 120 minutes.\n\nThat seems consistent with my previous calculation.\n\nBut let's consider another approach to ensure accuracy.\n\nWe know that in one hour, the clock shows 65 minutes instead of 60.\n\nSo, the ratio of clock time to actual time is 65:60, which simplifies to 13:12.\n\nThis means that for every 12 minutes of actual time, the clock shows 13 minutes.\n\nNow, over 24 hours, which is 24*60 = 1440 minutes of actual time.\n\nUsing the ratio, the clock time would be (13/12)*1440 minutes.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n(13/12)*1440 = 13*120 = 1560 minutes.\n\nSo, the clock shows 1560 minutes in 24 hours, while the actual time is 1440 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the clock gains 1560 - 1440 = 120 minutes in one day.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the gain per hour and multiply by the number of hours in a day.\n\nGain per hour = 5 minutes.\n\nNumber of hours in a day = 24.\n\nTotal gain = 5 * 24 = 120 minutes.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nMaybe the clock is gaining time continuously, not just at the end of each hour.\n\nBut since it's gaining 5 minutes every hour, that should be equivalent to a constant rate over the hour.\n\nBut in any case, the total gain over 24 hours should still be 120 minutes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the fact that the clock is running fast, so it might gain more than 5 minutes per hour in reality.\n\nWait, no, the problem states that it gains 5 minutes every hour.\n\nBut let's think about it carefully.\n\nIf the clock is running fast, does that affect how much time it gains over 24 hours?\n\nActually, no, because the gain is specified as 5 minutes per real hour.\n\nSo, for each real hour that passes, the clock adds an extra 5 minutes to its time.\n\nTherefore, over 24 real hours, it would add 24*5 = 120 minutes.\n\nSo, the total gain is 120 minutes in one day.\n\nAlternatively, if the clock is running fast, it might be measuring less real time in its own time, but the problem seems to specify the gain in terms of real time.\n\nI think the straightforward approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the clock gains 120 minutes in one day.\n\nTo put it in hours and minutes, 120 minutes is 2 hours.\n\nSo, the clock gains 2 hours in one day.\n\nBut since the question asks for the time gained, 120 minutes is acceptable, or 2 hours.\n\nBut perhaps I should present it in minutes, as per the initial units.\n\nTherefore, the clock gains 120 minutes in one day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
