        "content": "That sounds like an impressive creature! I think the bird you're referring to is the ostrich. Ostriches are indeed large, flightless birds native to Africa, and they are known for their incredible running speeds. Some sources suggest that they can reach speeds up to 60 miles per hour, which would make them the fastest birds on land. Their long legs and powerful muscles are adapted for running, allowing them to escape predators effectively in their open habitats. Is there something specific you'd like to know about ostriches or perhaps another aspect of African wildlife?"
