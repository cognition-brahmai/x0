        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is (6 * 3^2 - 4) / 2 + 10. First, I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This rule is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting with the exponent:\n\n3^2 = 9\n\nNow the expression is (6 * 9 - 4) / 2 + 10\n\nNext, multiplication inside the parentheses:\n\n6 * 9 = 54\n\nSo now it's (54 - 4) / 2 + 10\n\nThen subtraction inside the parentheses:\n\n54 - 4 = 50\n\nNow it's 50 / 2 + 10\n\nNext, division:\n\n50 / 2 = 25\n\nSo now it's 25 + 10\n\nFinally, addition:\n\n25 + 10 = 35\n\nTherefore, the answer is 35."
