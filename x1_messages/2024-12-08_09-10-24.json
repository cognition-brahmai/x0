        "content": "So, the car is going at a steady speed of 60 miles per hour, and it takes 2 hours to get to where it's going. You want to know how far the destination is from where it started, right?\n\nWell, to figure this out, we can use the basic formula for distance, which is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nIn this case, the speed is 60 miles per hour, and the time is 2 hours. So, plugging those values into the formula, we get:\n\nDistance = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 2 hours\n\nWhen you multiply those, the \"hours\" unit cancels out, leaving you with miles. So,\n\nDistance = 120 miles\n\nTherefore, the destination is 120 miles away from the starting point.\n\nBut let's double-check that to make sure we didn't make any mistakes. If the car is going at 60 miles per hour, that means it covers 60 miles every hour. So, in one hour, it would be 60 miles away, and in two hours, it would be twice that distance, which is 120 miles. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the definition of speed. Speed is basically how much distance is covered in a certain amount of time. So, if the speed is constant, as it is in this case, the distance should be directly proportional to the time traveled.\n\nAlternatively, if you were to plot this on a graph with time on one axis and distance on the other, you'd get a straight line with a slope equal to the speed. But that might be a bit more complicated than necessary for this problem.\n\nAlso, it's important to ensure that the units are consistent. Here, the speed is in miles per hour, and the time is in hours, so everything matches up nicely. If the units weren't consistent, you'd need to convert them accordingly.\n\nFor example, if the speed was given in kilometers per hour and the time in minutes, you'd need to convert either the speed to kilometers per minute or the time to hours to make the units compatible for multiplication.\n\nBut in this case, no such conversion is needed, which simplifies things.\n\nMoreover, since the car is traveling at a constant speed, we don't have to worry about acceleration or changes in speed that might complicate the calculation. It's a straightforward multiplication.\n\nLet me also consider if there's any other factor that might affect the distance, like wind resistance or the car's fuel efficiency, but since those aren't mentioned in the problem, we can assume they don't play a role here. We're dealing with an ideal scenario where speed is constant and unaffected by external factors.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the destination is 120 miles away from the starting point.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
