        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangle with a perimeter of 24 cm, and its length is twice its width. We need to find the dimensions, which means finding both the length and the width.\n\nFirst, I recall that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the formula for the perimeter is:\n\n\\[ P = 2l + 2w \\]\n\nwhere \\( l \\) is the length and \\( w \\) is the width.\n\nGiven that the perimeter is 24 cm, I can plug that into the formula:\n\n\\[ 2l + 2w = 24 \\]\n\nAlso, it's stated that the length is twice the width, so:\n\n\\[ l = 2w \\]\n\nNow, I can substitute \\( l \\) in the perimeter equation with \\( 2w \\):\n\n\\[ 2(2w) + 2w = 24 \\]\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\[ 4w + 2w = 24 \\]\n\n\\[ 6w = 24 \\]\n\nThen, solving for \\( w \\):\n\n\\[ w = 4 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\nNow, since \\( l = 2w \\):\n\n\\[ l = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\nSo, the dimensions are 8 cm for the length and 4 cm for the width.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense. If the length is 8 cm and the width is 4 cm, the perimeter would be:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 8 + 2 \\times 4 = 16 + 8 = 24 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\nThat matches the given perimeter. Also, the length is indeed twice the width, since 8 is twice 4. So, this seems correct.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to approach this. Perhaps using the formula for perimeter in terms of length and width and setting up equations.\n\nLet me try that again, but more systematically.\n\nLet\u2019s define the variables:\n\nLet \\( w \\) be the width.\n\nThen, length \\( l = 2w \\).\n\nPerimeter \\( P = 2l + 2w = 24 \\).\n\nSubstitute \\( l \\):\n\n\\[ 2(2w) + 2w = 24 \\]\n\n\\[ 4w + 2w = 24 \\]\n\n\\[ 6w = 24 \\]\n\n\\[ w = 4 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\n\\[ l = 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for perimeter in terms of length and width and solve for one variable in terms of the other.\n\nGiven \\( P = 2l + 2w = 24 \\), and \\( l = 2w \\), which is what we did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express it in terms of a ratio.\n\nSince length is twice the width, the ratio of length to width is 2:1.\n\nSo, the total parts are 2 + 1 = 3 parts.\n\nPerimeter is 24 cm, which encompasses all sides, so:\n\nEach part is \\( \\frac{24}{3} = 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n\nWait, no. That doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nIf the ratio of length to width is 2:1, then for every 2 units of length, there is 1 unit of width.\n\nBut in terms of perimeter, there are two lengths and two widths, so total parts are 2\u00d72 + 2\u00d71 = 4 + 2 = 6 parts.\n\nSo, each part is \\( \\frac{24}{6} = 4 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n\nTherefore, width is 1 part \u00d7 4 cm = 4 cm.\n\nLength is 2 parts \u00d7 4 cm = 8 cm.\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nAnother way could be to use the area, but we don't have the area given, so that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the diagonal or something, but that seems more complicated and unnecessary for this problem.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other information given that I might have missed.\n\nThe problem says the perimeter is 24 cm and the length is twice the width. That's all the information provided.\n\nSo, the straightforward approach is to set up equations based on the perimeter formula and the relationship between length and width.\n\nI think the first method is the most straightforward and least error-prone.\n\nLet me try to overcomplicate it just to see if I get the same answer.\n\nSuppose I let the width be \\( w \\), then length is \\( 2w \\).\n\nPerimeter is \\( 2l + 2w = 2(2w) + 2w = 4w + 2w = 6w = 24 \\).\n\nSo, \\( w = 4 \\) cm, and \\( l = 8 \\) cm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use simultaneous equations.\n\nLet \\( l = 2w \\) (equation 1)\n\nAnd \\( 2l + 2w = 24 \\) (equation 2)\n\nSubstitute equation 1 into equation 2:\n\n\\( 2(2w) + 2w = 24 \\)\n\n\\( 4w + 2w = 24 \\)\n\n\\( 6w = 24 \\)\n\n\\( w = 4 \\) cm\n\nThen, \\( l = 8 \\) cm\n\nSame answer again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can solve it graphically, but that seems unnecessary for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of proportion.\n\nSince length is twice the width, the width is half the length.\n\nSo, width \\( w = \\frac{l}{2} \\)\n\nThen, perimeter \\( P = 2l + 2w = 2l + 2(\\frac{l}{2}) = 2l + l = 3l = 24 \\)\n\nSo, \\( l = 8 \\) cm\n\nThen, \\( w = 4 \\) cm\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the average of length and width.\n\nBut that seems too vague and not as direct as the previous methods.\n\nI think the best approach is the first one, where I set up the perimeter equation and substitute the relationship between length and width directly.\n\nIt's clear, concise, and leads directly to the answer without any unnecessary steps.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangle are 8 cm in length and 4 cm in width.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{length } = 8 \\, \\text{cm}, \\, \\text{width } = 4 \\, \\text{cm}} \\]"
