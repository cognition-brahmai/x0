        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two types of cookies: chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin. The chocolate chip cookies are $1.50 each, and the oatmeal raisin are $2.00 each. The customer buys a total of 12 cookies and spends exactly $22. We need to find out how many of each type they bought.\n\nFirst, I think it would help to define variables for the number of each type of cookie. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( c \\) represent the number of chocolate chip cookies.\n\n- Let \\( o \\) represent the number of oatmeal raisin cookies.\n\nWe know two things:\n\n1. The total number of cookies is 12.\n\n2. The total cost is $22.\n\nSo, we can set up two equations based on this information.\n\nThe first equation will represent the total number of cookies:\n\n\\[ c + o = 12 \\]\n\nThe second equation will represent the total cost:\n\n\\[ 1.50c + 2.00o = 22 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. I think the best way to solve this is by using the substitution or elimination method. I'll go with the substitution method for this problem.\n\nFirst, I'll solve the first equation for one of the variables. Let's solve for \\( c \\):\n\n\\[ c = 12 - o \\]\n\nNow, I'll substitute this expression for \\( c \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 1.50(12 - o) + 2.00o = 22 \\]\n\nOkay, now let's simplify and solve for \\( o \\):\n\nFirst, distribute the 1.50:\n\n\\[ 1.50 \\times 12 = 18 \\]\n\n\\[ 1.50 \\times (-o) = -1.50o \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 18 - 1.50o + 2.00o = 22 \\]\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n\\[ 18 + (2.00o - 1.50o) = 22 \\]\n\n\\[ 18 + 0.50o = 22 \\]\n\nSubtract 18 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.50o = 4 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.50 to solve for \\( o \\):\n\n\\[ o = \\frac{4}{0.50} \\]\n\n\\[ o = 8 \\]\n\nSo, the customer bought 8 oatmeal raisin cookies.\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation for \\( c \\):\n\n\\[ c = 12 - o \\]\n\n\\[ c = 12 - 8 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 4 chocolate chip cookies and 8 oatmeal raisin cookies.\n\nTo double-check, let's calculate the total cost:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 1.50 = 6 \\]\n\n\\[ 8 \\times 2.00 = 16 \\]\n\n\\[ 6 + 16 = 22 \\]\n\nYes, that matches the total amount spent. Also, the total number of cookies is \\( 4 + 8 = 12 \\), which matches the given information.\n\nSo, the final answer is 4 chocolate chip cookies and 8 oatmeal raisin cookies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ chocolate chip cookies and } 8 \\text{ oatmeal raisin cookies}} \\]"
