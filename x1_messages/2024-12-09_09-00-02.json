The clean version is: \"Because they make up everything!\" while the dirty version is: \"Because they make up everything and they're always fucking around.\" Another example is the \"Why did the scarecrow win an award?\" joke. The clean version is: \"Because he was outstanding in his field!\" while the dirty version is: \"Because he was outstanding in his field, getting plowed all day long.\" These jokes play on double meanings and can be interpreted differently depending on the context and the audience's expectations."
