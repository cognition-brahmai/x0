        "content": "So I have this problem here: there are 12 red socks and 16 blue socks in a drawer, and it's dark so I can't see the colors. I need to figure out the minimum number of socks I have to pull out to guarantee that I have at least one matching pair. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to guarantee a matching pair. It means that no matter what, regardless of which socks I pick, I'll end up with at least two socks of the same color. So, I need to consider the worst-case scenario to ensure that even in the worst case, I still get a matching pair.\n\nLet's think about the possible colors: there are only red and blue socks. So, there are two colors in total. If I pick one sock, it can be either red or blue. If I pick a second sock, it could be the same color as the first or a different color.\n\nWait a minute, if I pick two socks, it's possible that they are both red, both blue, or one red and one blue. But it's not guaranteed that they match because they could be different colors.\n\nSo, to guarantee a matching pair, I might need to pick more than two socks. Let's consider picking three socks. If I pick three socks, possible combinations could be:\n\n- All three are red.\n\n- All three are blue.\n\n- Two red and one blue.\n\n- Two blue and one red.\n\nIn all these scenarios, there is at least one matching pair. For example, if I have two red and one blue, I have a matching pair of red socks. Similarly, if I have two blue and one red, I have a matching pair of blue socks.\n\nSo, picking three socks seems to guarantee that I have at least one matching pair. But is there a way to do it with fewer socks?\n\nLet's consider picking only two socks. As I thought earlier, it's possible to get one red and one blue sock, which doesn't give me a matching pair. Therefore, two socks don't guarantee a matching pair.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of socks I need to pick to guarantee at least one matching pair is three.\n\nWait, but let's double-check this. Maybe there's a smarter way to think about it.\n\nI've heard of the pigeonhole principle in mathematics, which might apply here. The pigeonhole principle states that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.\n\nIn this context, the \"pigeonholes\" are the colors, and the \"pigeons\" are the socks I pick. There are two colors (pigeonholes): red and blue.\n\nSo, if I pick three socks (pigeons), according to the pigeonhole principle, since there are only two colors, at least one color must have at least two socks. That is, there must be at least one matching pair.\n\nThis reinforces my earlier conclusion that picking three socks guarantees at least one matching pair.\n\nBut let's consider the worst-case scenario again to be absolutely sure. The worst-case scenario would be picking one sock of each color before picking a third sock.\n\nSo, first sock: red.\n\nSecond sock: blue.\n\nNow, if I pick a third sock, it must be either red or blue, but in either case, I'll have a matching pair.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If the third sock is red, then I have two red socks and one blue sock.\n\n- If the third sock is blue, then I have two blue socks and one red sock.\n\nIn both cases, there's a matching pair.\n\nTherefore, three socks are indeed sufficient to guarantee a matching pair.\n\nBut is there any way to guarantee it with fewer than three socks? Let's see.\n\nIf I pick only two socks, as I thought before, it's possible to have one red and one blue sock, which doesn't give me a matching pair.\n\nTherefore, two socks do not guarantee a matching pair, because there's a possibility of getting one of each color.\n\nHence, the minimum number of socks I need to pick to guarantee at least one matching pair is three.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if there are more colors involved. In this problem, there are only two colors: red and blue. If there were more colors, say three or four, would the answer change?\n\nFor example, if there were three colors, I would need to pick four socks to guarantee a matching pair, because in the worst case, I could pick one of each color first, and the fourth sock would match one of them.\n\nBut in this specific problem, there are only two colors, so picking three socks is sufficient.\n\nAlso, the number of socks of each color doesn't matter in this scenario, as long as there are at least two socks of each color. Here, there are 12 red and 16 blue, which is more than enough.\n\nSo, even if there were only two red and two blue socks, picking three socks would still guarantee a matching pair.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number is three.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let's think about another example. Suppose there are 10 red and 10 blue socks. Would the answer change? No, it would still be three socks.\n\nBecause in the worst case, I pick one red and one blue first, and the third sock must be either red or blue, giving me a matching pair.\n\nSimilarly, with 12 red and 16 blue, the answer remains three.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is three socks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
