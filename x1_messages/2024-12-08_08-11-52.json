        "content": "Let's see. I've got this paragraph about computational biology and its applications, especially in genomics and precision medicine. It mentions that computational biology helps in developing algorithms and statistical methods to understand biological data. One key area is sequencing and annotating genomes, which has improved our understanding of genetic diseases. Also, it's used in analyzing gene expression data to find new biomarkers for diseases.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the options is NOT a direct application based on what's mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Development of algorithms for biological data.\n\nWell, the paragraph starts by saying computational biology is instrumental in developing algorithms and statistical methods for understanding biological data. So, that's directly mentioned as an application.\n\nB. Studying the impact of climate change on marine life.\n\nHmm, this one doesn't seem to be directly mentioned in the paragraph. The text talks about genomics and gene expression, but nothing about climate change or marine life. So, maybe this is the one that's not a direct application based on the paragraph.\n\nC. Sequencing and annotating genomes.\n\nYes, the paragraph specifically mentions that computational biology is key in sequencing and annotating genomes, which is a direct application.\n\nD. Analysis of gene expression data.\n\nAgain, the paragraph explicitly states that computational biology is pivotal in analyzing gene expression data, leading to the discovery of new biomarkers for diseases.\n\nSo, comparing all these, option B seems to be the one that isn't directly supported by the information given in the paragraph.\n\nJust to make sure, let's think about it again. The paragraph focuses on computational biology's role in genomics and related areas like precision medicine and gene expression analysis. It doesn't mention anything about climate change or marine biology. Therefore, studying the impact of climate change on marine life isn't directly discussed as an application of computational biology in this paragraph.\n\nSo, the answer should be B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
