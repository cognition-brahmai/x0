        "content": "Let's see. The car rental company charges a flat fee of $25 plus an additional $0.10 per mile driven. So, if I drive 200 miles, I need to calculate the total cost.\n\nFirst, there's the flat fee, which is $25. That's straightforward; it doesn't change based on how many miles I drive.\n\nNext, there's the charge per mile. It's $0.10 for each mile driven. If I drive 200 miles, then the mileage charge would be 200 miles times $0.10 per mile.\n\nSo, let's calculate that: 200 miles * $0.10/mile = $20.\n\nNow, I need to add the flat fee to the mileage charge to get the total cost.\n\nTotal cost = flat fee + mileage charge = $25 + $20 = $45.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems pretty simple. But maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me make sure I didn't miss anything. The flat fee is $25, and the mileage rate is $0.10 per mile. Driving 200 miles would indeed be $20 for the miles.\n\nAdding those together, $25 + $20 equals $45.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other charges that might apply.\n\nFor example, sometimes car rental companies have additional fees for things like insurance, taxes, or additional drivers. But in this problem, it only mentions a flat fee and a per-mile charge. So, I think those are the only two components of the cost.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The mileage is in miles, and the charge is per mile, so that matches up.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the mileage charge is based on round trip miles or one way. But the problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume it's for the total miles driven, which is 200 miles.\n\nLet me also consider if there's a daily rate or any time-based charges, but again, the problem only mentions a flat fee for renting the car for a day, plus the per-mile charge.\n\nSo, sticking to the information provided, the total cost should be the sum of the flat fee and the mileage charge.\n\nTherefore, the total cost to rent the car for a day and drive 200 miles would be $45.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think about it differently. Suppose I drive 0 miles, the cost would be just the flat fee, which is $25.\n\nIf I drive 100 miles, it would be $25 plus $10 (100 miles * $0.10/mile), totaling $35.\n\nDriving 200 miles would be $25 plus $20, which is $45.\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the total cost as a linear equation, where cost = flat fee + (mileage rate * miles driven).\n\nSo, cost = $25 + ($0.10 * miles).\n\nPlugging in 200 miles: cost = $25 + ($0.10 * 200) = $25 + $20 = $45.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
