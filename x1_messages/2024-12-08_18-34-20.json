        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train that goes from City A to City B at 80 km/h and comes back at 120 km/h. We need to find the average speed for the whole trip.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, if I can find the total distance and the total time, I can calculate the average speed.\n\nLet me assume the distance between City A and City B is D kilometers. So, the total distance for the round trip is 2D kilometers.\n\nNow, for the trip from A to B at 80 km/h, the time taken would be D divided by 80 hours. Similarly, the return trip from B to A at 120 km/h would take D divided by 120 hours.\n\nSo, total time = D/80 + D/120.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. Let's see, 80 and 120 both divide into 240.\n\nSo, D/80 = (3D)/240, and D/120 = (2D)/240.\n\nTherefore, total time = (3D + 2D)/240 = 5D/240 = D/48 hours.\n\nNow, total distance is 2D kilometers, and total time is D/48 hours.\n\nSo, average speed = total distance / total time = 2D / (D/48) = 2D * (48/D) = 96 km/h.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But I've heard that average speed isn't always just the arithmetic mean of the two speeds. Maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider another method. Maybe using the formula for average speed when distances are equal.\n\nI recall that if the distances are equal, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the two speeds.\n\nThe harmonic mean of two speeds, V1 and V2, is given by 2V1V2 / (V1 + V2).\n\nSo, plugging in the values: 2 * 80 * 120 / (80 + 120) = 2 * 9600 / 200 = 19200 / 200 = 96 km/h.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 96 km/h is the average speed.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if the distances were not equal. Suppose the distance from A to B was different from B to A. But in this problem, it's a round trip, so the distances are equal. So, using the harmonic mean is appropriate.\n\nLet me also think about it in terms of time.\n\nTime taken for A to B: D/80 hours.\n\nTime taken for B to A: D/120 hours.\n\nTotal time: D/80 + D/120 = D(1/80 + 1/120) = D(3/240 + 2/240) = D(5/240) = D/48 hours.\n\nTotal distance: 2D kilometers.\n\nAverage speed: 2D / (D/48) = 96 km/h.\n\nAgain, 96 km/h.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of velocity, but since speed is scalar, and we're dealing with average speed, velocity isn't necessary here.\n\nWait, another thought: if the train stops at City B and doesn't return immediately, does that affect the average speed for the entire journey? But in this problem, it's a round trip, so I think we can assume immediate return.\n\nAlso, if the train takes breaks or stops along the way, that could affect the average speed, but since it's not mentioned, I'll assume the speeds given include all stops.\n\nLet me consider if the train travels at a different speed for different parts of the trip, but in this case, it's given as average speeds for each leg of the journey.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the concept of relative speed, but I don't think that's applicable here.\n\nAnother approach: let's assume specific distances. Suppose the distance between City A and City B is 240 km.\n\nThen, time to go from A to B: 240 / 80 = 3 hours.\n\nTime to return from B to A: 240 / 120 = 2 hours.\n\nTotal distance: 480 km.\n\nTotal time: 5 hours.\n\nAverage speed: 480 / 5 = 96 km/h.\n\nAgain, 96 km/h.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I keep getting 96 km/h as the average speed.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe if the train takes a different route on the way back, but the problem says it returns, so I think it's the same route.\n\nAlternatively, if the speeds are not constant, but average speeds are given, so I think using the harmonic mean or the total distance over total time is the correct approach.\n\nI think I've confirmed this enough ways. The average speed for the entire journey is 96 km/h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{96 \\text{ km/h}} \\]"
