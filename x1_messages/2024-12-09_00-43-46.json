        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a restaurant that sells hamburgers and hot dogs. In one week, they sold a total of 350 items and made $2,450 in revenue. The price of a hamburger is $8 and a hot dog is $5. We need to find out how many hamburgers and hot dogs they sold.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of hamburgers sold as H and the number of hot dogs sold as D.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of items sold is 350.\n\n2. The total revenue from these sales is $2,450.\n\nSo, we can write two equations:\n\n1. H + D = 350 (since the total items sold are 350)\n\n2. 8H + 5D = 2450 (since hamburgers are $8 each and hot dogs are $5 each, and the total revenue is $2,450)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the values of H and D.\n\nOne way to solve this is by the substitution method. Let's solve the first equation for one variable, say D:\n\nD = 350 - H\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for D into the second equation:\n\n8H + 5(350 - H) = 2450\n\nLet's simplify and solve for H:\n\n8H + 1750 - 5H = 2450\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n3H + 1750 = 2450\n\nNow, subtract 1750 from both sides:\n\n3H = 700\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\n8H + 5(350 - H) = 2450\n\nExpand the equation:\n\n8H + 1750 - 5H = 2450\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(8H - 5H) + 1750 = 2450\n\n3H + 1750 = 2450\n\nSubtract 1750 from both sides:\n\n3H = 700\n\nHmm, this gives H = 700 / 3, which is approximately 233.333. But the number of hamburgers sold has to be a whole number, right?\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nLet me check the problem again. \"They sold a total of 350 items and made $2,450 in revenue. A hamburger costs $8 and a hot dog costs $5.\"\n\nLet me try plugging in H = 233 and D = 350 - 233 = 117.\n\nCalculate the revenue: 233 * 8 + 117 * 5 = 1864 + 585 = 2449, which is almost 2450 but off by 1.\n\nIf H = 234, then D = 350 - 234 = 116.\n\nRevenue: 234 * 8 + 116 * 5 = 1872 + 580 = 2452, which is over by 2.\n\nHmm, it seems like there's a rounding issue here. Maybe the problem has a mistake or perhaps I need to consider that they sold fractional items, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I should use another method to solve the system of equations.\n\nLet's try the elimination method.\n\nWe have:\n\n1. H + D = 350\n\n2. 8H + 5D = 2450\n\nLet's multiply the first equation by 5:\n\n5H + 5D = 1750\n\nNow, subtract this from the second equation:\n\n(8H + 5D) - (5H + 5D) = 2450 - 1750\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3H = 700\n\nAgain, H = 700 / 3 \u2248 233.333\n\nThis suggests that H is approximately 233.333, which isn't possible since you can't sell a fraction of a hamburger.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or perhaps they allow for partial items, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the restaurant sold 233 hamburgers and 117 hot dogs, acknowledging that the revenue would be $2,449, which is $1 less than the stated $2,450.\n\nAlternatively, if they sold 234 hamburgers and 116 hot dogs, the revenue would be $2,452, which is $2 more than $2,450.\n\nIt seems like neither of these options exactly matches the given revenue.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the problem, or maybe they rounded the revenue to the nearest dollar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that some items are sold with additional items or there are other factors at play.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the prices include tax, but that would complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total items sold includes both hamburgers and hot dogs, and perhaps there are different types of hamburgers or hot dogs with different prices, but the problem seems to indicate that there are only two prices: $8 for hamburgers and $5 for hot dogs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the restaurant sold other items besides hamburgers and hot dogs, but the problem says \"a restaurant sells hamburgers and hot dogs,\" so presumably, those are the only items being considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me try solving the system of equations again.\n\nWe have:\n\nH + D = 350\n\n8H + 5D = 2450\n\nLet me solve the first equation for H:\n\nH = 350 - D\n\nNow, substitute into the second equation:\n\n8(350 - D) + 5D = 2450\n\nExpand:\n\n2800 - 8D + 5D = 2450\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2800 - 3D = 2450\n\nNow, subtract 2800 from both sides:\n\n-3D = -350\n\nDivide both sides by -3:\n\nD = 350 / 3 \u2248 116.666\n\nAgain, this gives a fractional number of hot dogs, which doesn't make sense.\n\nThis suggests that there's an inconsistency in the problem as stated.\n\nPerhaps the total revenue should have been different, or perhaps there's a mistake in the total number of items sold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the prices are not in dollars, or perhaps there's a different currency involved, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to round the numbers or consider that some items are sold in sets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed to have no solution, to teach us that real-world data may not always fit neatly into equations.\n\nHowever, I think it's more likely that there's a typo or mistake in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the restaurant sold 233 hamburgers and 117 hot dogs, acknowledging that the revenue doesn't exactly match $2,450.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the restaurant sold 235 hamburgers and 115 hot dogs.\n\nLet's check:\n\n235 * 8 = 1880\n\n115 * 5 = 575\n\nTotal revenue: 1880 + 575 = 2455, which is $5 more than $2,450.\n\nThis is still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 230 hamburgers and 120 hot dogs.\n\n230 * 8 = 1840\n\n120 * 5 = 600\n\nTotal revenue: 1840 + 600 = 2440, which is $10 less than $2,450.\n\nStill not a match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the restaurant sold 233 hamburgers and 117 hot dogs, accepting that the revenue is $2,449, which is close to $2,450.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to solving this problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to set up the equations and acknowledge that there's no integer solution, highlighting a real-world scenario where data may not perfectly align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my algebra.\n\nLet me try solving the system of equations again.\n\nWe have:\n\nH + D = 350\n\n8H + 5D = 2450\n\nLet me use the substitution method again.\n\nFrom the first equation: D = 350 - H\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\n8H + 5(350 - H) = 2450\n\n8H + 1750 - 5H = 2450\n\n3H + 1750 = 2450\n\n3H = 700\n\nH = 700 / 3 \u2248 233.333\n\nThis confirms my earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to express the answer in fractions.\n\nSo, H = 700 / 3 \u2248 233.333\n\nAnd D = 350 - H = 350 - 700 / 3 = (1050 - 700) / 3 = 350 / 3 \u2248 116.666\n\nBut selling a fraction of a hamburger or hot dog doesn't make practical sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the restaurant sold 233 hamburgers and 117 hot dogs, with the slight discrepancy in revenue being acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, and the total revenue should be $2,449 instead of $2,450.\n\nIn that case, with H = 233 and D = 117:\n\n233 * 8 = 1864\n\n117 * 5 = 585\n\nTotal revenue: 1864 + 585 = 2449\n\nAlternatively, if H = 234 and D = 116:\n\n234 * 8 = 1872\n\n116 * 5 = 580\n\nTotal revenue: 1872 + 580 = 2452\n\nStill not $2,450.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the restaurant sold 232 hamburgers and 118 hot dogs.\n\n232 * 8 = 1856\n\n118 * 5 = 590\n\nTotal revenue: 1856 + 590 = 2446, which is $4 less than $2,450.\n\nIt seems like none of these combinations give exactly $2,450.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using matrices or another method, but given the level of the problem, that seems unnecessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the problem, and the total items sold should be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the prices of hamburgers and hot dogs are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are different types of hamburgers or hot dogs with different prices, but the problem seems to indicate uniform prices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have no solution, to teach students that real-world data may not always fit perfectly into mathematical models.\n\nHowever, I think it's more likely that there's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the restaurant sold 233 hamburgers and 117 hot dogs, accepting that the revenue is $2,449 instead of $2,450.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the restaurant sold 234 hamburgers and 116 hot dogs, resulting in $2,452 in revenue.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given equations, the solution involves fractional numbers of hamburgers and hot dogs, which isn't practical. Therefore, it's likely that there's an error in the problem's data. However, if we were to choose the closest integer values, selling 233 hamburgers and 117 hot dogs would result in $2,449 in revenue, which is very close to the stated $2,450.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{233 \\text{ hamburgers and } 117 \\text{ hot dogs}} \\]"
