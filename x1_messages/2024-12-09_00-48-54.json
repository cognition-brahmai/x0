        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces 500 units of a product every day, and its production increases by 10% each week. We need to find out how many units it will produce in the fourth week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The factory's daily production is 500 units, and this production increases by 10% each week. So, each week, the daily production goes up by 10% compared to the previous week.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says \"production increases by 10% each week.\" Does that mean the total weekly production increases by 10% each week, or that the daily production rate increases by 10% each week?\n\nI think it's the daily production rate that increases by 10% each week. Because if it were the total weekly production that increases by 10%, that would be different.\n\nAssuming it's the daily production rate that increases by 10% each week, let's proceed.\n\nSo, in week 1, the daily production is 500 units. Therefore, the weekly production is 500 units/day * 7 days/week = 3500 units/week.\n\nIn week 2, the daily production increases by 10%, so the new daily production is 500 units * 1.10 = 550 units/day. Therefore, the weekly production for week 2 is 550 units/day * 7 days/week = 3850 units/week.\n\nIn week 3, the daily production increases by another 10% based on week 2's daily production. So, daily production is 550 units * 1.10 = 605 units/day. Weekly production is 605 units/day * 7 days/week = 4235 units/week.\n\nIn week 4, the daily production increases by another 10% based on week 3's daily production. So, daily production is 605 units * 1.10 = 665.5 units/day. Weekly production is 665.5 units/day * 7 days/week = 4658.5 units/week.\n\nBut since we're dealing with units of products, which are typically whole numbers, we might need to round this to the nearest whole number. So, 4658.5 units would round to 4659 units.\n\nWait, but in the calculation for week 4, I got 665.5 units per day. Is it possible to produce half a unit? Probably not, so maybe the daily production should be rounded to the nearest whole number each week.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nIn week 1: 500 units/day * 7 = 3500 units/week.\n\nWeek 2: 500 * 1.10 = 550 units/day * 7 = 3850 units/week.\n\nWeek 3: 550 * 1.10 = 605 units/day * 7 = 4235 units/week.\n\nWeek 4: 605 * 1.10 = 665.5 units/day. If we round this to 666 units/day, then 666 * 7 = 4662 units/week.\n\nAlternatively, if we don't round and keep it as 665.5 units/day, then 665.5 * 7 = 4658.5 units/week, which would round to 4659 units/week.\n\nBut perhaps the rounding should be done at the end, not intermediate steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to calculate this using the formula for percentage increase over weeks.\n\nLet's think about it differently.\n\nThe production increases by 10% each week, so each week's daily production is 1.10 times the previous week's daily production.\n\nSo, starting with week 1 daily production: 500 units/day.\n\nWeek 2 daily production: 500 * 1.10 = 550 units/day.\n\nWeek 3 daily production: 550 * 1.10 = 550 * 1.10 = 605 units/day.\n\nWeek 4 daily production: 605 * 1.10 = 605 * 1.10 = 665.5 units/day.\n\nThen, the weekly production in week 4 would be 665.5 * 7 = 4658.5 units/week, which rounds to 4659 units/week.\n\nAlternatively, since the production increases by 10% each week, the weekly production is multiplied by 1.10 each week.\n\nSo, week 1: 3500 units.\n\nWeek 2: 3500 * 1.10 = 3850 units.\n\nWeek 3: 3850 * 1.10 = 4235 units.\n\nWeek 4: 4235 * 1.10 = 4658.5 units, which rounds to 4659 units.\n\nWait, but this seems consistent with the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula to calculate the production in the nth week.\n\nSince the production increases by 10% each week, it's a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 1.10.\n\nSo, the weekly production in week n is: initial weekly production * (1.10)^(n-1).\n\nGiven that, week 1: 3500 * (1.10)^(1-1) = 3500 *1 = 3500 units.\n\nWeek 2: 3500 * (1.10)^(2-1) = 3500 *1.10 = 3850 units.\n\nWeek 3: 3500 * (1.10)^(3-1) = 3500 *1.21 = 4235 units.\n\nWeek 4: 3500 * (1.10)^(4-1) = 3500 *1.331 = 4658.5 units, which rounds to 4659 units.\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the daily production increases by 10% each week, and then multiply by 7 to get the weekly production, we get the same result.\n\nSo, the factory will produce approximately 4659 units in the fourth week.\n\nWait, but in the calculation, it's 4658.5 units, which would round to 4659 units.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects us to not round in intermediate steps and just leave it as 4658.5 units.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's acceptable to keep it in decimal, but since units are typically whole numbers, probably best to round to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce 4659 units in the fourth week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4659} \\]"
