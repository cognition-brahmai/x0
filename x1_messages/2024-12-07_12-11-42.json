Each plan should correspond to an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string. This string could be the user's question, one or more previous evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nHere are the tools at your disposal:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information using the DuckDuckGo search engine. This tool is useful in finding a suitable list of sites that may or may not contain the answer to the user's question. The function does not directly answer the question; instead, it locates a list of sites that might have the answer.\nPageLoader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline-delimited links. The input is one or more links, and the output is plain text containing the content of the links.\nHyperlinkExtractor[input]: Extracts hyperlinks from plain text and generates a plain text, newline-delimited response of links.\nKnowledgeModel[input]: A question-answering language model, particularly effective in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that refers to an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., What color is the dog, given :evidence1:?\n\nEach function requires a simple string as input, without quotation marks or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., KnowledgeModel[What is the population of New York City, given :evidence3:?]\n\nEnsure that there is only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should adhere to the following format:\nPlan: [First action to take based on the input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action to take, based on the result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: Containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who designed the Eiffel Tower and what other notable structures did they design?"
