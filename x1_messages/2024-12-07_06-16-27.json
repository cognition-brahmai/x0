        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, John reads 10 pages every day, and after 5 days, he has 75% of the book left to read. I need to find out the total number of pages in the book.\n\nFirst, I'll figure out how many pages John has read in those 5 days. Since he reads 10 pages daily, in 5 days he would have read:\n\n10 pages/day \u00d7 5 days = 50 pages\n\nNow, after reading 50 pages, he still has 75% of the book left to read. That means the 50 pages he has read so far correspond to 25% of the book, because 100% - 75% = 25%.\n\nSo, 50 pages represent 25% of the total pages in the book. To find the total number of pages, I can set up a proportion:\n\n25% : 50 pages\n\n100% : total pages\n\nLet me denote the total pages as T.\n\nSo, 25% of T is 50 pages.\n\nIn equation form, that's:\n\n0.25 \u00d7 T = 50\n\nNow, I'll solve for T:\n\nT = 50 / 0.25\n\nT = 200 pages\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf the book has 200 pages in total, and John has read 50 pages, then indeed he has 150 pages left, which is 75% of 200 pages.\n\nLet me verify:\n\n75% of 200 pages is 0.75 \u00d7 200 = 150 pages.\n\nYes, that matches the information given in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in another way. If after reading 50 pages, he has 75% left, that means the 50 pages are the first 25% of the book.\n\nSo, again, 25% corresponds to 50 pages, leading to the total pages being 200.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nBut let me consider if there's another approach to confirm this.\n\nSuppose the total pages are T.\n\nJohn reads 10 pages per day for 5 days, so he reads 50 pages.\n\nHe has 75% of the book left, which means he has read 25% of the book.\n\nSo, 50 pages is 25% of T.\n\nAgain, T = 50 / 0.25 = 200 pages.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation.\n\nLet T be the total pages.\n\nPages read = 50\n\nPages left = 75% of T\n\nSo, pages read + pages left = total pages\n\n50 + 0.75T = T\n\nNow, solve for T:\n\n50 = T - 0.75T\n\n50 = 0.25T\n\nT = 50 / 0.25\n\nT = 200 pages\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think it's consistent across different methods, so the total number of pages in the book is 200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
