        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a 6x6 grid, and an ant starts at the bottom left corner wanting to get to the top right corner. It can only move right or up. I need to figure out how many different paths the ant can take to get there. Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a 6x6 grid means. Is it 6 squares by 6 squares, or is it 6 lines by 6 lines? Wait, in grid path problems, a 6x6 grid usually means 6 rows and 6 columns, so it's like a chessboard with 6 squares in each direction. So, from the bottom left to the top right, the ant needs to move 6 steps to the right and 6 steps up, right?\n\nYes, so in total, the ant needs to make 12 moves: 6 right and 6 up. The order in which it makes these moves will determine the path it takes. So, the problem reduces to finding the number of distinct sequences of 6 right moves and 6 up moves.\n\nI recall that in combinatorics, the number of ways to arrange a certain number of items where some are identical is given by the formula for combinations. Specifically, the number of distinct sequences is the number of ways to choose positions for the right moves (or the up moves) in the sequence of 12 moves.\n\nSo, the formula should be the binomial coefficient \"12 choose 6\", which is written as C(12,6) or sometimes as C(12,6). This represents the number of ways to choose 6 positions out of 12 for the right moves (the remaining 6 will automatically be up moves).\n\nLet me recall the formula for the binomial coefficient: C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, C(12,6) = 12! / (6! * 6!).\n\nNow, I need to calculate this. First, let's compute 12!:\n\n12! = 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 479,001,600.\n\nWait, that seems too big. Maybe I can simplify the calculation by canceling out the 6! in the denominator earlier.\n\nLet me write 12! as 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6!.\n\nSo, C(12,6) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6!) / (6! \u00d7 6!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7) / (6!).\n\nOkay, now I need to compute 6!:\n\n6! = 720.\n\nSo, C(12,6) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7) / 720.\n\nLet me calculate the numerator step by step:\n\n12 \u00d7 11 = 132,\n\n132 \u00d7 10 = 1,320,\n\n1,320 \u00d7 9 = 11,880,\n\n11,880 \u00d7 8 = 95,040,\n\n95,040 \u00d7 7 = 665,280.\n\nSo, C(12,6) = 665,280 / 720.\n\nNow, 665,280 \u00f7 720:\n\nLet me see, 720 \u00d7 900 = 648,000,\n\n665,280 - 648,000 = 17,280,\n\n720 \u00d7 24 = 17,280,\n\nSo, 900 + 24 = 924.\n\nTherefore, C(12,6) = 924.\n\nWait, but I think I've made a mistake somewhere because I recall that C(12,6) is 924, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach to confirm this result. Let's think about it differently.\n\nIn a grid, the number of paths from the bottom left to the top right, moving only right or up, is equal to the number of ways to arrange a sequence of moves where the number of right moves equals the number of up moves.\n\nSo, again, it's about arranging 6 right moves and 6 up moves in some order.\n\nYes, that confirms that it's C(12,6).\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it recursively. Each path can be broken down into smaller paths. For example, the number of paths to a cell is equal to the number of paths to the cell directly below it plus the number of paths to the cell directly to the left of it.\n\nThis is similar to Pascal's triangle, where each entry is the sum of the two entries above and to the left of it.\n\nIn fact, the number of paths in an n x n grid is C(2n,n).\n\nSo, for a 6x6 grid, it's C(12,6), which is 924.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let's see what C(12,6) is.\n\nI can look it up or calculate it again.\n\nLet me calculate it again step by step.\n\nC(12,6) = 12! / (6! * 6!).\n\n12! = 479,001,600,\n\n6! = 720,\n\nSo, 720 * 720 = 518,400,\n\n479,001,600 / 518,400 = 924.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate C(12,6) step by step:\n\nC(12,6) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7) / (6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1).\n\nLet's compute numerator and denominator separately.\n\nNumerator: 12 \u00d7 11 = 132,\n\n132 \u00d7 10 = 1,320,\n\n1,320 \u00d7 9 = 11,880,\n\n11,880 \u00d7 8 = 95,040,\n\n95,040 \u00d7 7 = 665,280.\n\nDenominator: 6 \u00d7 5 = 30,\n\n30 \u00d7 4 = 120,\n\n120 \u00d7 3 = 360,\n\n360 \u00d7 2 = 720,\n\n720 \u00d7 1 = 720.\n\nSo, 665,280 / 720 = 924.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of different paths the ant can take is 924.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any restrictions or special cases in this problem.\n\nThe problem states that the ant can only move right or up, which means it can't move left or down, and it can't stay in place.\n\nAlso, the grid is 6x6, so it's a square grid.\n\nI assume that the grid lines are equally spaced, and the ant moves from intersection to intersection.\n\nMoreover, there are no obstacles or forbidden cells in the grid, so the ant can take any path that consists of 6 right moves and 6 up moves.\n\nTherefore, the calculation using the binomial coefficient is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, if the grid were larger or smaller, the formula would adjust accordingly.\n\nFor example, in an n x n grid, the number of paths would be C(2n,n).\n\nIn this case, n=6, so C(12,6)=924.\n\nSimilarly, for a 1x1 grid, C(2,1)=2 paths;\n\nfor a 2x2 grid, C(4,2)=6 paths;\n\nand so on.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that each path is a sequence of 12 moves, with 6 right and 6 up.\n\nThe number of such sequences is the number of ways to choose which 6 of the 12 moves are right (the others being up), which is C(12,6).\n\nAlternatively, it's the same as the number of ways to choose which 6 moves are up, which is also C(12,6).\n\nTherefore, the answer is indeed 924.\n\nSo, to summarize, the ant has 924 different paths it can take from the bottom left corner to the top right corner of a 6x6 grid, moving only right or up.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{924} \\]"
