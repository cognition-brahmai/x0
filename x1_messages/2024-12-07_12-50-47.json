        "content": "Let's see. The store has 2000 books, and each costs $12 on average. They sell them at a 25% markup. I need to find out the total revenue if they sell all the books.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a markup is. A markup is extra money added to the cost price to determine the selling price. So, if something costs $10 and there's a 20% markup, the selling price would be $10 plus 20% of $10, which is $12.\n\nIn this case, the cost price per book is $12, and the markup is 25%. So, the selling price per book would be $12 plus 25% of $12.\n\nLet me calculate 25% of $12. 25% is the same as 0.25 in decimal form. So, 0.25 times $12 is $3. Therefore, the selling price per book is $12 + $3 = $15.\n\nNow, if they sell all 2000 books at $15 each, the total revenue would be 2000 times $15.\n\nLet me do that multiplication. 2000 times 15 is 30,000.\n\nSo, the total revenue generated from selling all the books would be $30,000.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using the markup percentage directly on the total cost.\n\nLet's try that. The total cost of all books is 2000 times $12, which is $24,000.\n\nA 25% markup on the total cost would be 25% of $24,000.\n\n25% of $24,000 is 0.25 times $24,000, which is $6,000.\n\nSo, the total revenue would be the total cost plus the markup: $24,000 + $6,000 = $30,000.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. So, either way, the total revenue is $30,000.\n\nI think that makes sense. It's good to cross-verify using different methods to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30000} \\]"
