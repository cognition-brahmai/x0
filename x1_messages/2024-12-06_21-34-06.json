Curious creatures, they congregated near the cracked ceiling, contemplating the chipped cornice. Suddenly, a cacophony of chirping crickets caught their attention, leading them to the corner where a cage contained a captive canary. The cats circled the cage, their coats cascading in the crisp morning light. The canary, perceiving no danger, continued its cheerful song, unaware of the carnivorous company. The cats, captivated by the melody, calmed down, content to just listen. This communal moment highlighted the curious camaraderie between the feline and avian species, challenging the common conception of cats as mere hunters."

]uld think of it as adding 6 apples three times: 6 + 6 + 6 = 18.\n\nWait a minute, multiplication is just repeated addition, right? So, 3 times 6 is the same as adding 6 three times. That reinforces that the answer is 18.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using division or something else, but I think multiplication is the most straightforward method here.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should consider. For example, are there any apples that are bad or anything like that mentioned? No, the problem is straightforward: bags of 6 apples, 3 bags bought.\n\nSo, no need to worry about any additional factors. The calculation is straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the total number of apples John has is 18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
