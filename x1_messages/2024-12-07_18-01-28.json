Spiders generally avoid humans and wouldn't be interested in crawling into someone's mouth while they're asleep. It's just an urban legend that has been circulating for a long time, but there's no scientific evidence to support it. So, you can rest easy knowing that spiders aren't waiting to crawl into your mouth while you sleep."
