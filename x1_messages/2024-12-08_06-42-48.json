The theory suggests that frequent viewers of television may perceive the world as more violent than it actually is, especially if they consume a lot of violent content. This is because television often portrays a distorted version of reality, with higher rates of violence and crime than exist in real life. So, if someone watches a lot of TV, they might think that violence is more common in everyday life than it really is."
