Here's a Python script that implements the quicksort algorithm on a given list of numbers:\n\n```python\ndef quicksort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]\n    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]\n    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]\n    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [3,6,8,10,1,2,1]\nprint(\"Unsorted list:\", numbers)\nsorted_numbers = quicksort(numbers)\nprint(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_numbers)\n```\n\nThis script defines a function called `quicksort` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the numbers sorted in ascending order. The function works by selecting a pivot element from the list and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted and concatenated with the pivot to produce the sorted list.\n\nIn the example usage, we create a list of numbers and print it before and after sorting using the `quicksort` function."
