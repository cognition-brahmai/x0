        "content": "So the city uses 250 million gallons of water each day. We need to find out how much water it uses in a whole year, assuming a year has 365 days. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a daily water usage, and we need to convert that into annual usage. That means we'll have to multiply the daily usage by the number of days in a year.\n\nSo, daily usage is 250 million gallons. That can be written as 250,000,000 gallons per day.\n\nNext, the number of days in a year is 365.\n\nTherefore, annual usage = daily usage \u00d7 number of days in a year.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nAnnual usage = 250,000,000 gallons/day \u00d7 365 days/year.\n\nNow, before I dive into the multiplication, maybe there's a simpler way to handle these large numbers. Dealing with millions can be tricky, so perhaps I can work with the concept of millions to make it easier.\n\n250 million gallons is the same as 250 \u00d7 1,000,000 gallons.\n\nSo, annual usage = 250 \u00d7 1,000,000 gallons/day \u00d7 365 days/year.\n\nBut that seems a bit cumbersome. Maybe I can multiply 250 by 365 first and then append the million gallons part.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, multiply 250 by 365.\n\n250 \u00d7 365.\n\nWell, I know that 250 \u00d7 400 would be 100,000, but 365 is less than 400. Maybe I can calculate it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can break down 365 into smaller parts that are easier to multiply.\n\nFor example, 365 = 300 + 60 + 5.\n\nSo, 250 \u00d7 365 = 250 \u00d7 300 + 250 \u00d7 60 + 250 \u00d7 5.\n\nLet's calculate each part:\n\n250 \u00d7 300 = 75,000.\n\n250 \u00d7 60 = 15,000.\n\n250 \u00d7 5 = 1,250.\n\nNow, add them up: 75,000 + 15,000 + 1,250 = 91,250.\n\nSo, 250 \u00d7 365 = 91,250.\n\nBut wait a minute, that doesn't seem right. 250 \u00d7 365 should be larger than that. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\n250 \u00d7 300:\n\n250 \u00d7 300 = 250 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 100 = 750 \u00d7 100 = 75,000. That seems correct.\n\n250 \u00d7 60:\n\n250 \u00d7 60 = 250 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 10 = 1,500 \u00d7 10 = 15,000. That also seems correct.\n\n250 \u00d7 5:\n\n250 \u00d7 5 = 1,250. Correct.\n\nNow, adding them up: 75,000 + 15,000 = 90,000 + 1,250 = 91,250.\n\nWait, but 250 \u00d7 400 is 100,000, and 365 is 35 less than 400, so 250 \u00d7 365 should be 100,000 minus 250 \u00d7 35.\n\nLet me calculate 250 \u00d7 35:\n\n250 \u00d7 30 = 7,500.\n\n250 \u00d7 5 = 1,250.\n\nTotal: 7,500 + 1,250 = 8,750.\n\nNow, 100,000 - 8,750 = 91,250.\n\nOkay, so that matches my earlier calculation. So, 250 \u00d7 365 = 91,250.\n\nBut now, considering that the daily usage is 250 million gallons, the annual usage would be 91,250 million gallons.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think about the units.\n\nDaily usage: 250 million gallons/day.\n\nNumber of days: 365 days/year.\n\nSo, annual usage = 250 million gallons/day \u00d7 365 days/year = 91,250 million gallons/year.\n\nBut 91,250 million gallons can be expressed in a larger unit. Maybe in billion gallons.\n\nSince 1 billion = 1,000 million, then 91,250 million gallons = 91.25 billion gallons.\n\nThat seems more manageable.\n\nSo, the city uses 91.25 billion gallons of water in a year.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculation to be sure.\n\nStarting again:\n\n250,000,000 gallons/day \u00d7 365 days/year.\n\nFirst, multiply 250,000,000 by 365.\n\nAlternatively, 250 \u00d7 365 = 91,250, and then append the six zeros for the millions.\n\nWait, actually, 250 million is 250,000,000, which is 250 \u00d7 1,000,000.\n\nSo, 250 \u00d7 365 = 91,250.\n\nThen, 91,250 \u00d7 1,000,000 = 91,250,000,000 gallons.\n\nYes, that's 91.25 billion gallons.\n\nAlternatively, since 1 billion is 1,000,000,000, then 91,250,000,000 is 91.25 billion.\n\nSo, the city uses 91.25 billion gallons of water in a year.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{91.25 \\text{ billion gallons}} \\]"
