        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we've got a bag with 7 red balls and 3 blue balls, making a total of 10 balls. The question is, if you pick two balls at random without putting them back, what's the probability that both are red?\n\nFirst, I need to remember how probability works. Probability is all about finding the chance of something happening. It's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcome is picking two red balls. The total possible outcomes are all the different ways you can pick any two balls from the bag.\n\nLet's start by figuring out the total number of ways to pick two balls from ten. Since the order doesn't matter (picking ball A first and then ball B is the same as picking ball B first and then ball A), we should use combinations, not permutations.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items,\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose,\n\n- \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 balls from 10 is:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 2) = \\frac{10!}{2!(10 - 2)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 8!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = 45\n\\]\n\nOkay, so there are 45 possible pairs of balls you could pick.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many of those pairs are made up of two red balls. There are 7 red balls, so the number of ways to choose 2 red balls from 7 is:\n\n\\[\nC(7, 2) = \\frac{7!}{2!(7 - 2)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 5!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 21 pairs of red balls.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls picked are red is the number of red pairs divided by the total number of pairs:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both red}) = \\frac{21}{45} = \\frac{7}{15}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, can this fraction be simplified? Let's check. Both 21 and 45 are divisible by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{21 \\div 3}{45 \\div 3} = \\frac{7}{15}\n\\]\n\n7 and 15 have no common factors, so \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\) is the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem step by step, considering the probability of picking a red ball on the first draw and then another red ball on the second draw, without replacement.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball first is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{first red}) = \\frac{7}{10}\n\\]\n\nAfter picking one red ball, there are now 6 red balls left and a total of 9 balls remaining in the bag.\n\nSo, the probability of picking another red ball is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{second red} | \\text{first red}) = \\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, I multiply the probabilities:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both red}) = P(\\text{first red}) \\times P(\\text{second red} | \\text{first red}) = \\frac{7}{10} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{14}{30} = \\frac{7}{15}\n\\]\n\nAgain, I get \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\).\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign. But just to be thorough, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way is to consider the total probability using the concept of combinations. The probability is the ratio of the number of ways to choose 2 red balls to the number of ways to choose any 2 balls from the bag.\n\nWe already calculated that as \\(\\frac{21}{45} = \\frac{7}{15}\\).\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the positions of the balls being picked. For example, the first ball picked is red, and the second is also red.\n\nWait, that's similar to the step-by-step approach I did earlier.\n\nOr, I could consider that there are 7 red balls and 3 blue balls, and I'm picking two without replacement.\n\nBut I think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\).\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can plug in some numbers to see if it makes sense.\n\nSuppose I have 7 red balls and 3 blue balls.\n\nTotal pairs: 45.\n\nRed pairs: 21.\n\nSo, probability: \\(\\frac{21}{45} = \\frac{7}{15}\\).\n\nAlternatively, decimal form: \\(\\frac{7}{15} \\approx 0.4667\\), or 46.67%.\n\nDoes that make sense? Well, there are more red balls than blue balls, so it makes sense that the probability of picking two red balls is greater than picking two blue balls.\n\nFor comparison, the probability of picking two blue balls would be:\n\n\\[\nC(3, 2) = \\frac{3!}{2!(3 - 2)!} = \\frac{3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{2 \\times 1 \\times 1} = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, 3 pairs of blue balls.\n\nTherefore, probability of both blue:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both blue}) = \\frac{3}{45} = \\frac{1}{15} \\approx 0.0667 \\text{ or } 6.67\\%\n\\]\n\nWhich is indeed less than the probability of picking two red balls.\n\nAlternatively, the probability of picking one red and one blue ball would be:\n\nTotal pairs: 45.\n\nRed pairs: 21.\n\nBlue pairs: 3.\n\nTherefore, mixed pairs: 45 - 21 - 3 = 21.\n\nSo, probability of one red and one blue:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{one red, one blue}) = \\frac{21}{45} = \\frac{7}{15} \\approx 0.4667 \\text{ or } 46.67\\%\n\\]\n\nWait a second, that's the same as the probability of picking two red balls. That can't be right.\n\nWait, no. Let's see.\n\nTotal pairs: 45.\n\nRed pairs: 21.\n\nBlue pairs: 3.\n\nMixed pairs: 45 - 21 - 3 = 21.\n\nSo, yes, probability of mixed pairs is also \\(\\frac{21}{45} = \\frac{7}{15}\\).\n\nSo, the probabilities are:\n\n- Both red: \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\)\n\n- Both blue: \\(\\frac{1}{15}\\)\n\n- One red and one blue: \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\)\n\nWait, but \\(\\frac{7}{15} + \\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{7}{15} = \\frac{15}{15} = 1\\), which makes sense because these are the only possible outcomes.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the probability of one red and one blue should be higher than both red or both blue, but in this case, both red and one red one blue have the same probability of \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\), while both blue is lower at \\(\\frac{1}{15}\\).\n\nI guess that makes sense because there are more red balls, so the probability of picking two reds is higher than picking one of each, but in this specific case, it's equal to picking one of each.\n\nWait, but intuitively, I would think that with more red balls, picking two reds should be more likely than picking one of each. But according to the calculations, picking two reds and picking one of each are both \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\), while picking two blues is \\(\\frac{1}{15}\\).\n\nHmm, maybe my intuition is off here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the mixed pairs.\n\nLet me recalculate the number of mixed pairs.\n\nNumber of ways to pick one red and one blue:\n\nNumber of red balls: 7\n\nNumber of blue balls: 3\n\nSo, number of mixed pairs: 7 \u00d7 3 = 21\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTotal pairs: 45\n\nRed pairs: 21\n\nBlue pairs: 3\n\nMixed pairs: 21\n\nSo, probabilities:\n\n- Both red: \\(\\frac{21}{45} = \\frac{7}{15}\\)\n\n- Both blue: \\(\\frac{3}{45} = \\frac{1}{15}\\)\n\n- One red, one blue: \\(\\frac{21}{45} = \\frac{7}{15}\\)\n\nYes, that adds up to 1.\n\nSo, in this specific case, picking two reds is equally likely as picking one of each, and both are more likely than picking two blues.\n\nI guess that makes sense given the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about it in terms of percentages:\n\n\\(\\frac{7}{15} \\approx 46.67\\%\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{15} \\approx 6.67\\%\\)\n\nSo, 46.67% chance of both red, 46.67% chance of one red and one blue, and 6.67% chance of both blue.\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls picked are red is \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\).\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{15}} \\]"
