Ambrosia was considered the food or drink of the gods, and it was believed to sustain their immortal nature. It was often depicted as a fragrant, sweet substance that conferred longevity and divine qualities upon those who partook of it. In various myths, mortals who tasted ambrosia would be granted immortality or other supernatural abilities."
