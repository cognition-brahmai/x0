This is because when someone is drowning, they're using all their energy just to try to keep their head above water and breathe. So, they might not be able to call out or wave for help. This is known as the Instinctive Drowning Response. It's important to be aware of this so that you can recognize the signs of drowning and act quickly to help someone in distress.\n"
