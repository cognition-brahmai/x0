        "content": "So there are 100 people at this party, and everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total. Hmm, this sounds like a problem about combinations, where order doesn't matter.\n\nLet me think about smaller numbers first to get a grasp on the pattern. Suppose there are just 2 people at the party, Alice and Bob. They each shake hands with each other once, so there's only 1 handshake.\n\nNow, if there are 3 people\u2014Alice, Bob, and Carol\u2014Alice shakes hands with Bob and Carol, and Bob shakes hands with Carol. So that's 3 handshakes in total.\n\nWait, let's see: Alice-Bob, Alice-Carol, Bob-Carol. Yeah, that's 3.\n\nIf there are 4 people\u2014Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave\u2014Alice shakes hands with Bob, Carol, and Dave; Bob shakes hands with Carol and Dave; and Carol shakes hands with Dave. So that's 6 handshakes.\n\nLet's list them: Alice-Bob, Alice-Carol, Alice-Dave, Bob-Carol, Bob-Dave, Carol-Dave. Yep, 6 in total.\n\nI notice a pattern here. With 2 people, 1 handshake; 3 people, 3 handshakes; 4 people, 6 handshakes. It seems like with each additional person, the number of handshakes increases by the number of people already there.\n\nFor example, when you go from 2 to 3 people, you add 2 more handshakes (Alice-Carol and Bob-Carol). From 3 to 4 people, you add 3 more handshakes (Alice-Dave, Bob-Dave, Carol-Dave).\n\nSo, the number of handshakes seems to be the sum of the first (n-1) numbers, where n is the total number of people. For 2 people, 1; for 3 people, 1+2=3; for 4 people, 1+2+3=6, and so on.\n\nWait a minute, that sounds like the formula for combinations. Specifically, it's the number of ways to choose 2 people out of n to shake hands, which is denoted as \"n choose 2\" or C(n,2).\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nSo, for handshakes, k=2:\n\nC(n,2) = n! / (2!(n-2)!) = (n*(n-1)*(n-2)!)/(2*1*(n-2)!)) = (n*(n-1))/2\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes is n*(n-1)/2.\n\nIn this case, n=100.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nC(100,2) = 100*99 / 2 = 9900 / 2 = 4950.\n\nTherefore, there would be 4,950 handshakes at the party.\n\nBut let me double-check this logic. Maybe there's another way to approach it.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. So, for 100 people, each person shakes hands with 99 others.\n\nSo, at first glance, it might seem like there are 100*99 = 9,900 handshakes. But this counts each handshake twice\u2014once for each participant in the handshake.\n\nSo, to get the actual number of unique handshakes, we need to divide that number by 2.\n\nTherefore, 9,900 / 2 = 4,950.\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it sequentially. The first person shakes hands with 99 others. The second person has already shaken hands with the first, so they shake hands with 98 remaining people. The third person has already shaken hands with the first two, so they shake hands with 97 people, and so on.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be:\n\n99 + 98 + 97 + ... + 1\n\nThis is the sum of the first 99 positive integers.\n\nThe formula for the sum of the first k integers is k*(k+1)/2.\n\nBut wait, in this case, it's the sum from 1 to 99.\n\nSo, sum = 99*100/2 = 9,900/2 = 4,950.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach it, I end up with 4,950 handshakes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 4,950.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4950} \\]"
