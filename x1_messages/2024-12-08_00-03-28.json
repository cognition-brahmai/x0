        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have John and Jim, and we're told that John has twice as many marbles as Jim. Also, together they have 18 marbles. We need to find out how many marbles each one has.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what's being said. If John has twice as many marbles as Jim, that means for every marble Jim has, John has two. So, if Jim has, say, 1 marble, John has 2. If Jim has 2, John has 4, and so on.\n\nNow, together, their marbles add up to 18. So, if Jim has x marbles, John has 2x marbles, and the total is x + 2x = 18.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nJim's marbles: x\n\nJohn's marbles: 2x\n\nTotal marbles: x + 2x = 3x\n\nAnd we know that 3x = 18.\n\nSo, to find x, I can divide both sides by 3:\n\n3x / 3 = 18 / 3\n\nx = 6\n\nSo, Jim has 6 marbles.\n\nNow, since John has twice as many as Jim, John has 2 * 6 = 12 marbles.\n\nLet me check if that adds up to 18: 6 + 12 = 18. Yes, it does.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using different variables or equations.\n\nLet's see. Suppose I let J represent John's marbles and I represent Jim's marbles.\n\nWe know that J = 2I (John has twice as many as Jim)\n\nAnd J + I = 18 (Together they have 18 marbles)\n\nSo, I can substitute the first equation into the second:\n\n2I + I = 18\n\n3I = 18\n\nThen, I = 6\n\nSo, Jim has 6 marbles, and John has 2 * 6 = 12 marbles.\n\nSame answer as before. Good.\n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe using ratios.\n\nIf John has twice as many marbles as Jim, the ratio of John's marbles to Jim's marbles is 2:1.\n\nSo, for every 2 parts John has, Jim has 1 part. Together, they have 3 parts, which equal 18 marbles.\n\nSo, each part is 18 / 3 = 6 marbles.\n\nTherefore, Jim has 1 part, which is 6 marbles, and John has 2 parts, which is 12 marbles.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nLet me try one more way, just to be sure. Suppose I use Jim's marbles as the base.\n\nIf Jim has x marbles, John has 2x marbles.\n\nTotal: x + 2x = 3x = 18\n\nSo, x = 18 / 3 = 6\n\nJim: 6 marbles\n\nJohn: 2 * 6 = 12 marbles\n\nAlright, I'm convinced. No matter how I approach it, the answer is Jim has 6 marbles and John has 12.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any trick here that I'm missing. Is there any possibility that the numbers could be different but still satisfy the conditions?\n\nFor example, if John had 10 marbles and Jim had 8, but that doesn't satisfy the twice as many condition. 10 is not twice 8.\n\nOr if John had 14 and Jim had 4, but 14 is not twice 4.\n\nNo, it seems that 12 and 6 is the only pair that satisfies both conditions: John has twice as many as Jim, and together they have 18.\n\nLet me also consider if negative numbers are possible. Could Jim have negative marbles? That doesn't make sense in reality, so we can dismiss that.\n\nAlternatively, could one of them have zero marbles? Well, if Jim had 0, John would have 0, but together that's 0, not 18. So that doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, the only logical and sensible answer is Jim has 6 marbles and John has 12.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The problem is straightforward, and the answer is consistent across different methods I used to solve it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Jim has 6 marbles and John has 12 marbles.}} \\]"
