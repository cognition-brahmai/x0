        "content": "So the food processing company is looking to optimize its production line to reduce waste and improve efficiency. Currently, they're generating 10% waste, and they want to bring that down to 5%. They process 1000 tons of raw material per day, and each ton costs $200. The plant operates 300 days a year. I need to calculate the potential savings in raw materials and the annual savings.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the waste percentage means. If they have 10% waste, that means that out of the 1000 tons of raw material they process each day, 10% is wasted, and 90% is actually used in production. Their goal is to reduce this waste to 5%, which would mean only 5% of the raw material is wasted, and 95% is used in production.\n\nSo, the reduction in waste from 10% to 5% means they're improving their efficiency by 5 percentage points. I need to calculate how much raw material this improvement would save them per day and then annualize that savings.\n\nLet me first calculate the daily waste reduction:\n\nCurrent waste: 10% of 1000 tons = 100 tons per day\n\nTarget waste: 5% of 1000 tons = 50 tons per day\n\nReduction in waste: 100 tons - 50 tons = 50 tons per day\n\nSo, they aim to reduce waste by 50 tons per day.\n\nNow, since the raw material costs $200 per ton, the savings per day would be:\n\n50 tons * $200/ton = $10,000 per day\n\nNext, to find the annual savings, I need to multiply the daily savings by the number of operating days in a year. The plant operates 300 days a year, so:\n\n$10,000/day * 300 days/year = $3,000,000 per year\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how much raw material they would save by improving their efficiency from 90% to 95%.\n\nCurrent utilization: 90% of 1000 tons = 900 tons used in production\n\nTarget utilization: 95% of 1000 tons = 950 tons used in production\n\nIncrease in utilization: 950 tons - 900 tons = 50 tons per day\n\nAgain, that matches the earlier calculation of 50 tons per day saved.\n\nSo, the daily savings are $10,000, and annually, that's $3,000,000.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider if the 5% waste target is achievable and if there are any costs associated with achieving this reduction. However, based on the information provided, it seems that the company just wants to know the potential savings in raw materials by reducing waste from 10% to 5%, assuming they can achieve this.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the amount of raw material that would be saved per day and then find out the cost savings.\n\nAs I did before:\n\nCurrent waste: 10% of 1000 tons = 100 tons\n\nTarget waste: 5% of 1000 tons = 50 tons\n\nReduction in waste: 50 tons per day\n\nCost per ton: $200\n\nDaily savings: 50 tons * $200/ton = $10,000\n\nAnnual savings: $10,000/day * 300 days/year = $3,000,000 per year\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the amount of raw material needed to produce the same amount of product with less waste.\n\nLet's say they want to produce a certain amount of product. With current efficiency, they have 10% waste, meaning 90% of the raw material is used in the product.\n\nSo, for every ton of product, they need 1/0.9 \u2248 1.111 tons of raw material.\n\nIf they reduce waste to 5%, their efficiency increases to 95%, so they need 1/0.95 \u2248 1.053 tons of raw material per ton of product.\n\nTherefore, the reduction in raw material usage per ton of product is:\n\n1.111 - 1.053 = 0.058 tons per ton of product\n\nBut I'm not sure if this approach is necessary since the question seems to be focused on the raw material savings directly due to waste reduction.\n\nGiven that, I think the initial calculation is sufficient.\n\nSo, the potential daily savings in raw materials are $10,000, and the annual savings are $3,000,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3000000} \\]"
