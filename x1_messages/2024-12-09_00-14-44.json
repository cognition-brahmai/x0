        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with 8 red balls, 6 blue balls, and 4 green balls. So, in total, there are 8 + 6 + 4 = 18 balls in the box. The question is, if I pick one ball at random without looking, what's the probability that it's not green?\n\nOkay, probability. I remember that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls, which is 18.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the outcomes where I pick a ball that is not green. So, that means I can pick either a red ball or a blue ball.\n\nThere are 8 red balls and 6 blue balls, so the total number of non-green balls is 8 + 6 = 14.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a non-green ball is 14 (non-green balls) divided by 18 (total balls).\n\nSo, that's 14/18.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2.\n\n14 \u00f7 2 = 7\n\n18 \u00f7 2 = 9\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 7/9.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this in terms of complementary probabilities. The probability of an event not happening is 1 minus the probability of the event happening.\n\nIn this case, the probability of not picking a green ball is 1 minus the probability of picking a green ball.\n\nThe probability of picking a green ball is the number of green balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 4/18.\n\nSimplify that to 2/9.\n\nSo, 1 - 2/9 = 7/9.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nWait a minute, I should check if there's another way to look at this to confirm.\n\nLet's see, another approach could be to consider the proportions.\n\nTotal balls: 18\n\nGreen balls: 4\n\nNon-green balls: 14\n\nSo, the probability of picking a non-green ball is 14/18 = 7/9.\n\nOr, decimal wise, 7 divided by 9 is approximately 0.777..., which is about 77.78%.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify the format, fraction should be fine.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The probability of picking a non-green ball is 7/9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{9}} \\]"
