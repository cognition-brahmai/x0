It explores how traits are passed from parents to offspring, the structure and function of genes, and how genes interact with the environment. Microbiology, on the other hand, is the study of microscopic organisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. It investigates their structure, growth, and role in disease and the environment.

        "content": "The branch of biology that primarily focuses on the study of microscopic organisms is D. Microbiology.\n\nMicrobiology is the scientific discipline concerned with the study of microscopic organisms, which include bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and algae. These microorganisms are too small to be seen with the naked eye and require the use of microscopes for observation. Microbiology encompasses various sub-disciplines, such as bacteriology (study of bacteria), virology (study of viruses), mycology (study of fungi), and parasitology (study of parasites).\n\nMicrobiologists investigate the structure, function, growth, distribution, and interactions of these microorganisms, as well as their roles in both beneficial and harmful processes. This includes understanding how microbes contribute to ecosystems, industrial processes, and human health and disease.\n\nIn contrast, genetics is the branch of biology that deals with the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity in organisms. It focuses on how traits are passed from parents to offspring and the mechanisms of gene expression and regulation.\n\nZoology is the branch of biology that studies animals, including their classification, physiology, development, behavior, and evolution.\n\nBotany is the branch of biology that deals with the study of plants, including their structure, growth, reproduction, metabolism, and evolution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Microbiology."
