        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that Alice spent $10 at the bakery and bought a total of 8 items. The bakery sells donuts for $1 each and cookies for $2 each. We need to find out how many donuts she bought.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make things clearer. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( d \\) represent the number of donuts Alice bought.\n\n- Let \\( c \\) represent the number of cookies Alice bought.\n\nNow, we can set up some equations based on the information given.\n\nFirst equation: The total number of items is 8.\n\nSo, \\( d + c = 8 \\)\n\nSecond equation: The total amount spent is $10.\n\nSince donuts are $1 each and cookies are $2 each, the equation for the total cost is:\n\n\\( 1d + 2c = 10 \\)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( d + c = 8 \\)\n\n2. \\( d + 2c = 10 \\)\n\nWe can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. I'll use the substitution method here.\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( d = 8 - c \\)\n\nNow, substitute \\( d \\) in the second equation:\n\n\\( (8 - c) + 2c = 10 \\)\n\nSimplify and solve for \\( c \\):\n\n\\( 8 - c + 2c = 10 \\)\n\n\\( 8 + c = 10 \\)\n\n\\( c = 10 - 8 \\)\n\n\\( c = 2 \\)\n\nNow that we have \\( c = 2 \\), we can find \\( d \\) using the first equation:\n\n\\( d = 8 - c \\)\n\n\\( d = 8 - 2 \\)\n\n\\( d = 6 \\)\n\nSo, Alice bought 6 donuts and 2 cookies.\n\nLet's double-check to make sure this makes sense.\n\nTotal items: 6 donuts + 2 cookies = 8 items \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTotal cost: (6 donuts * $1) + (2 cookies * $2) = $6 + $4 = $10 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out. Therefore, Alice bought 6 donuts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
