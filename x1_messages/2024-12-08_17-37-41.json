        "content": "Let's see here. There are 25 students in the class, and each student has either a cat or a dog as a pet. So, that means every student has one pet, and it's either a cat or a dog. Got it.\n\nNow, it's said that there are a total of 12 cats among the students' pets. So, if there are 12 cats, and there are 25 students in total, then the rest of the students must have dogs.\n\nTo find out how many dogs there are, I can subtract the number of cats from the total number of pets, which is the same as the number of students since each student has one pet.\n\nSo, number of dogs = total number of students - number of cats.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of dogs = 25 - 12 = 13.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If there are 12 cats and 25 students, and each student has one pet, then yes, the remaining 13 must have dogs.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nTotal pets = total students = 25.\n\nNumber of cats = 12.\n\nNumber of dogs = total pets - number of cats = 25 - 12 = 13.\n\nYes, that seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it. Suppose some students have both a cat and a dog, but the problem says each student has either a cat or a dog, not both. So, no, it's either one or the other.\n\nWait, the problem says \"each student has either a cat or a dog as a pet.\" So, no overlapping.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pets is equal to the number of students, which is 25.\n\nGiven that 12 of these pets are cats, the remaining must be dogs.\n\nSo, again, dogs = 25 - 12 = 13.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use algebra, I could let:\n\nLet d = number of dogs.\n\nThen, number of cats = 12.\n\nTotal pets = d + 12 = 25.\n\nSo, d = 25 - 12 = 13.\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The number of dogs is 13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
