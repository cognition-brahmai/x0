        "content": "Let's tackle this coin problem step by step. I've got 100 coins in total, made up of nickels, dimes, and quarters, and their total value is $14.75. Also, there are more dimes than nickels and more quarters than dimes. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the value of each type of coin:\n\n- A nickel is worth $0.05.\n\n- A dime is worth $0.10.\n\n- A quarter is worth $0.25.\n\nOkay, so I have three unknowns: the number of nickels (let's call that n), the number of dimes (d), and the number of quarters (q). I need to set up equations based on the information given.\n\nFirst equation: the total number of coins is 100.\n\nSo, n + d + q = 100.\n\nSecond equation: the total value of the coins is $14.75.\n\nThat would be 0.05n + 0.10d + 0.25q = 14.75.\n\nAlso, I'm told that there are more dimes than nickels and more quarters than dimes. So, d > n and q > d.\n\nAlright, now I have to solve these equations while keeping those inequalities in mind.\n\nMaybe I can express everything in terms of one variable to make it simpler. Let's see.\n\nLet me try to solve the first equation for one variable, say, q.\n\nq = 100 - n - d.\n\nNow, plug this into the second equation:\n\n0.05n + 0.10d + 0.25(100 - n - d) = 14.75.\n\nLet's distribute the 0.25:\n\n0.05n + 0.10d + 25 - 0.25n - 0.25d = 14.75.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(0.05n - 0.25n) + (0.10d - 0.25d) + 25 = 14.75.\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n-0.20n - 0.15d + 25 = 14.75.\n\nNow, let's move the 25 over to the other side:\n\n-0.20n - 0.15d = 14.75 - 25.\n\nThat's:\n\n-0.20n - 0.15d = -10.25.\n\nI can multiply both sides by -1 to make the coefficients positive:\n\n0.20n + 0.15d = 10.25.\n\nHmm, dealing with decimals isn't my favorite, so maybe I can eliminate the decimals by multiplying everything by 100:\n\n20n + 15d = 1025.\n\nNow, I can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 5:\n\n4n + 3d = 205.\n\nAlright, so now I have:\n\n4n + 3d = 205.\n\nAnd I also have:\n\nn + d + q = 100.\n\nAnd q = 100 - n - d.\n\nAlso, d > n and q > d.\n\nI need to find integer values for n, d, and q that satisfy these equations and inequalities.\n\nSince d > n and q > d, and all are positive integers (you can't have negative coins), I need to find values where n < d < q, and n + d + q = 100, with 4n + 3d = 205.\n\nLet me try to solve for one variable in terms of another.\n\nFrom 4n + 3d = 205, let's solve for d:\n\n3d = 205 - 4n.\n\nd = (205 - 4n)/3.\n\nSince d has to be an integer, (205 - 4n) must be divisible by 3.\n\nSo, 205 - 4n \u2261 0 mod 3.\n\nLet me find n such that 205 - 4n is divisible by 3.\n\nAlternatively, I can test values of n that make d an integer and also satisfy n < d.\n\nAlso, since n, d, and q are all positive integers, and n + d + q = 100, n can't be more than 99, and similarly for the others.\n\nLet me consider the inequalities:\n\nn < d < q.\n\nAnd q = 100 - n - d.\n\nSince q > d, 100 - n - d > d.\n\nSo, 100 - n > 2d.\n\nOr, d < (100 - n)/2.\n\nAlso, since d > n, n < d < (100 - n)/2.\n\nThat gives me a range for d in terms of n.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should try plugging in possible values for n and see what d and q come out to.\n\nFirst, I need to find n such that d = (205 - 4n)/3 is an integer, and n < d < (100 - n)/2.\n\nLet me try n = 10.\n\nThen d = (205 - 4*10)/3 = (205 - 40)/3 = 165/3 = 55.\n\nThen q = 100 - 10 - 55 = 35.\n\nNow, check if d > n and q > d.\n\n55 > 10, and 35 > 55? Wait, 35 is not greater than 55. So q is not greater than d. Doesn't satisfy q > d.\n\nSo n = 10 doesn't work.\n\nNext, try n = 15.\n\nd = (205 - 4*15)/3 = (205 - 60)/3 = 145/3, which is approximately 48.333. Not an integer. Doesn't work.\n\nn = 16.\n\nd = (205 - 64)/3 = 141/3 = 47.\n\nq = 100 - 16 - 47 = 37.\n\nCheck inequalities: 47 > 16, and 37 > 47? No, 37 is not greater than 47.\n\ndoesn't work.\n\nn = 17.\n\nd = (205 - 68)/3 = 137/3, approximately 45.666. Not integer.\n\nn = 18.\n\nd = (205 - 72)/3 = 133/3, approximately 44.333. Not integer.\n\nn = 19.\n\nd = (205 - 76)/3 = 129/3 = 43.\n\nq = 100 - 19 - 43 = 38.\n\nCheck inequalities: 43 > 19, and 38 > 43? No.\n\ndoesn't work.\n\nn = 20.\n\nd = (205 - 80)/3 = 125/3, approximately 41.666. Not integer.\n\nn = 21.\n\nd = (205 - 84)/3 = 121/3, approximately 40.333. Not integer.\n\nn = 22.\n\nd = (205 - 88)/3 = 117/3 = 39.\n\nq = 100 - 22 - 39 = 39.\n\nCheck inequalities: 39 > 22, and 39 > 39? Well, q should be greater than d, but here q = d. Doesn't satisfy q > d.\n\ndoesn't work.\n\nn = 23.\n\nd = (205 - 92)/3 = 113/3, approximately 37.666. Not integer.\n\nn = 24.\n\nd = (205 - 96)/3 = 109/3, approximately 36.333. Not integer.\n\nn = 25.\n\nd = (205 - 100)/3 = 105/3 = 35.\n\nq = 100 - 25 - 35 = 40.\n\nCheck inequalities: 35 > 25, and 40 > 35. Yes, both conditions are satisfied.\n\nLet me check if the total value is $14.75.\n\n0.05*25 + 0.10*35 + 0.25*40 = 1.25 + 3.50 + 10.00 = 14.75.\n\nPerfect, it matches.\n\nSo, the solution is 25 nickels, 35 dimes, and 40 quarters.\n\nWait a minute, but earlier n = 25, d = 35, q = 40 satisfied all conditions. Let me see if there are other possible solutions.\n\nLet's try n = 26.\n\nd = (205 - 104)/3 = 101/3, approximately 33.666. Not integer.\n\nn = 27.\n\nd = (205 - 108)/3 = 97/3, approximately 32.333. Not integer.\n\nn = 28.\n\nd = (205 - 112)/3 = 93/3 = 31.\n\nq = 100 - 28 - 31 = 41.\n\nCheck inequalities: 31 > 28, and 41 > 31. Yes.\n\nCheck total value: 0.05*28 + 0.10*31 + 0.25*41 = 1.40 + 3.10 + 10.25 = 14.75.\n\nIt also works.\n\nSo, another solution is n = 28, d = 31, q = 41.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"more dimes than nickels and more quarters than dimes,\" which is satisfied here.\n\nLet me check n = 29.\n\nd = (205 - 116)/3 = 89/3, approximately 29.666. Not integer.\n\nn = 30.\n\nd = (205 - 120)/3 = 85/3, approximately 28.333. Not integer.\n\nn = 31.\n\nd = (205 - 124)/3 = 81/3 = 27.\n\nq = 100 - 31 - 27 = 42.\n\nCheck inequalities: 27 > 31? No, 27 is not greater than 31. Doesn't satisfy d > n.\n\nSo, n = 31 doesn't work.\n\nWait, d = 27 and n = 31, which violates d > n. So, n can't be 31.\n\nSimilarly, n = 29 and n = 30 don't give integer d.\n\nSo, possible solutions are n = 25, d = 35, q = 40 and n = 28, d = 31, q = 41.\n\nBut the problem says \"more dimes than nickels and more quarters than dimes,\" which both solutions satisfy.\n\nIs there any other possible solution?\n\nLet's check n = 24.\n\nd = (205 - 96)/3 = 109/3, which is not integer.\n\nn = 23: d = 113/3, not integer.\n\nn = 22: d = 39, q = 39, but q should be greater than d, which is not strictly satisfied since q = d.\n\nn = 21: d = 121/3, not integer.\n\nn = 20: d = 125/3, not integer.\n\nn = 19: d = 43, q = 38, which doesn't satisfy q > d.\n\nn = 18: d = 133/3, not integer.\n\nn = 17: d = 137/3, not integer.\n\nn = 16: d = 47, q = 37, which doesn't satisfy q > d.\n\nn = 15: d = 145/3, not integer.\n\nn = 14: d = (205 - 56)/3 = 149/3, not integer.\n\nn = 13: d = (205 - 52)/3 = 153/3 = 51.\n\nq = 100 - 13 - 51 = 36.\n\nCheck inequalities: 51 > 13, and 36 > 51? No.\n\ndoesn't work.\n\nSo, only two possible solutions: n = 25, d = 35, q = 40 and n = 28, d = 31, q = 41.\n\nBut let's see if there are more solutions for n less than 25.\n\nn = 26: d = 101/3, not integer.\n\nn = 27: d = 97/3, not integer.\n\nn = 28: works.\n\nWait, n = 25 and n = 28 are the only integers that work within the constraints.\n\nWait, no, n = 25 and n = 28 are the only ones that give integer d and satisfy q > d.\n\nSo, there are two possible solutions.\n\nBut the problem seems to expect a single solution. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem implies that q > d > n, and all are positive integers.\n\nBut in both cases, q > d > n is satisfied.\n\nSo, maybe there are two valid solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a unique solution, and I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me double-check the first solution: n = 25, d = 35, q = 40.\n\nTotal coins: 25 + 35 + 40 = 100.\n\nTotal value: 0.05*25 + 0.10*35 + 0.25*40 = 1.25 + 3.50 + 10.00 = 14.75.\n\nInequalities: 35 > 25 and 40 > 35. Good.\n\nSecond solution: n = 28, d = 31, q = 41.\n\nTotal coins: 28 + 31 + 41 = 100.\n\nTotal value: 0.05*28 + 0.10*31 + 0.25*41 = 1.40 + 3.10 + 10.25 = 14.75.\n\nInequalities: 31 > 28 and 41 > 31. Good.\n\nSo, both are valid solutions.\n\nMaybe the problem expects only one solution, but there are two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to find all possible solutions.\n\nIn that case, there are two solutions:\n\n- 25 nickels, 35 dimes, and 40 quarters.\n\n- 28 nickels, 31 dimes, and 41 quarters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a constraint I missed that would eliminate one of these solutions.\n\nLooking back at the problem, it says \"more dimes than nickels and more quarters than dimes.\" Both solutions satisfy these inequalities.\n\nSo, I think both are valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the solution with the least number of nickels, or something like that.\n\nBut as per the given conditions, both solutions are valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the number of each coin, assuming that there is a unique solution, but in reality, there are two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that n has to be less than d and d less than q.\n\nWait, the problem says \"more dimes than nickels and more quarters than dimes,\" which translates to d > n and q > d.\n\nBoth solutions satisfy these inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a solution where q > d > n, and both solutions satisfy that.\n\nSo, I think both are valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a unique solution, and I made an error in my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the number of each coin, and there is only one solution.\n\nBut in that case, I found two solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nWait, let me double-check the equations.\n\nWe have:\n\nn + d + q = 100.\n\n0.05n + 0.10d + 0.25q = 14.75.\n\nAnd d > n, q > d.\n\nI think the equations are set up correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the number of coins must be non-negative integers.\n\nWhich I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a constraint on the maximum number of certain coins.\n\nBut no, the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a solution where q > d > n, and both solutions satisfy that.\n\nSo, I think both are valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the combination with the maximum number of quarters, or something like that.\n\nBut as per the given conditions, both solutions are valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is misstated, and there's only one solution, but based on my calculations, there are two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the number of dimes is strictly greater than the number of nickels, and the number of quarters is strictly greater than the number of dimes, which is what I did.\n\nSo, I think both solutions are valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the solution with the least number of nickels, which would be n = 25.\n\nBut actually, n = 28 is more than n = 25, so n = 25 has fewer nickels.\n\nWait, n = 25 has fewer nickels than n = 28.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the solution with the most number of quarters, which would be q = 41.\n\nBut both solutions have different numbers of quarters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find one possible solution, and I can pick either one.\n\nIn that case, I can choose n = 25, d = 35, q = 40.\n\nAlternatively, I can present both solutions to the user.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects only one solution, and I found two, which might indicate a mistake on my part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has only one solution, and I made a mistake in finding two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has multiple solutions, and I need to find all of them.\n\nIn that case, there are two solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the number of dimes is strictly greater than the number of nickels, and the number of quarters is strictly greater than the number of dimes, which both solutions satisfy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a unique solution, and I made an error in my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the number of each coin, and there is only one combination that satisfies the conditions.\n\nBut based on my calculations, there are two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the combination with the least number of coins for one type, or something like that.\n\nBut the total number of coins is fixed at 100.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the combination where the number of quarters is minimized, or something like that.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any minimization or maximization.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the number of nickels, dimes, and quarters must be positive integers, which they are in both solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a constraint on the number of each type of coin that I'm missing.\n\nBut based on the problem statement, I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the number of each coin, and the solution is unique, but my calculations indicate two solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the number of dimes is as large as possible, or something like that.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find one possible solution, and I can pick either one.\n\nIn that case, I can present one of them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is incorrectly set up, and there are two solutions, but the problem implies there is only one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is only one solution, and I made a mistake in finding two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the number of dimes is strictly greater than the number of nickels, and the number of quarters is strictly greater than the number of dimes, which both solutions satisfy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a unique solution, and I need to find it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use a different approach to solve the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use matrices or another method to solve the system of equations.\n\nBut that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can graph the equations, but that might not be practical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the difference between the number of dimes and nickels, and the number of quarters and dimes.\n\nBut that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the total value in cents to avoid decimals.\n\nSo, total value is $14.75, which is 1475 cents.\n\nThen, the equations become:\n\n5n + 10d + 25q = 1475.\n\nAnd n + d + q = 100.\n\nAnd d > n, q > d.\n\nNow, I can divide the first equation by 5:\n\nn + 2d + 5q = 295.\n\nAnd I already have n + d + q = 100.\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from this:\n\n(n + 2d + 5q) - (n + d + q) = 295 - 100.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nd + 4q = 195.\n\nSo, d = 195 - 4q.\n\nNow, since d has to be greater than n, and q has to be greater than d, and all are positive integers.\n\nAlso, n = 100 - d - q.\n\nSo, n = 100 - d - q.\n\nNow, since d = 195 - 4q.\n\nSubstitute into n:\n\nn = 100 - (195 - 4q) - q = 100 - 195 + 4q - q = -95 + 3q.\n\nSo, n = -95 + 3q.\n\nNow, since n has to be positive, -95 + 3q > 0.\n\nSo, 3q > 95, which means q > 95/3, which is approximately 31.666.\n\nSince q has to be an integer, q >= 32.\n\nAlso, since q > d, and d = 195 - 4q, we have q > 195 - 4q.\n\nSo, q + 4q > 195, which is 5q > 195, so q > 39.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nq > d, which is q > 195 - 4q.\n\nSo, q > 195 - 4q.\n\nAdd 4q to both sides: 5q > 195.\n\nSo, q > 39.\n\nTherefore, q >= 40.\n\nAlso, since d = 195 - 4q, and d has to be positive, 195 - 4q > 0.\n\nSo, 4q < 195, which means q < 48.75.\n\nSince q has to be an integer, q <= 48.\n\nTherefore, q can be from 40 to 48 inclusive.\n\nNow, let's find corresponding d and n for q from 40 to 48.\n\nStarting with q = 40.\n\nd = 195 - 4*40 = 195 - 160 = 35.\n\nn = -95 + 3*40 = -95 + 120 = 25.\n\nCheck inequalities: d > n \u2192 35 > 25, and q > d \u2192 40 > 35. Good.\n\nNext, q = 41.\n\nd = 195 - 4*41 = 195 - 164 = 31.\n\nn = -95 + 3*41 = -95 + 123 = 28.\n\nCheck inequalities: 31 > 28, and 41 > 31. Good.\n\nq = 42.\n\nd = 195 - 4*42 = 195 - 168 = 27.\n\nn = -95 + 3*42 = -95 + 126 = 31.\n\nCheck inequalities: 27 > 31? No, 27 is not greater than 31. Violates d > n.\n\nSo, q = 42 doesn't work.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought q > d > n, but here d < n when q = 42.\n\nSo, q = 42 is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, q = 43.\n\nd = 195 - 4*43 = 195 - 172 = 23.\n\nn = -95 + 3*43 = -95 + 129 = 34.\n\n23 > 34? No.\n\nInvalid.\n\nq = 44.\n\nd = 195 - 4*44 = 195 - 176 = 19.\n\nn = -95 + 3*44 = -95 + 132 = 37.\n\n19 > 37? No.\n\nInvalid.\n\nq = 45.\n\nd = 195 - 4*45 = 195 - 180 = 15.\n\nn = -95 + 3*45 = -95 + 135 = 40.\n\n15 > 40? No.\n\nInvalid.\n\nq = 46.\n\nd = 195 - 4*46 = 195 - 184 = 11.\n\nn = -95 + 3*46 = -95 + 138 = 43.\n\n11 > 43? No.\n\nInvalid.\n\nq = 47.\n\nd = 195 - 4*47 = 195 - 188 = 7.\n\nn = -95 + 3*47 = -95 + 141 = 46.\n\n7 > 46? No.\n\nInvalid.\n\nq = 48.\n\nd = 195 - 4*48 = 195 - 192 = 3.\n\nn = -95 + 3*48 = -95 + 144 = 49.\n\n3 > 49? No.\n\nInvalid.\n\nSo, only q = 40 and q = 41 yield valid solutions.\n\nTherefore, there are two possible solutions:\n\n1. q = 40, d = 35, n = 25.\n\n2. q = 41, d = 31, n = 28.\n\nBoth satisfy the conditions:\n\n- n + d + q = 100.\n\n- 0.05n + 0.10d + 0.25q = 14.75.\n\n- d > n and q > d.\n\nTherefore, these are the only two possible combinations of nickels, dimes, and quarters that meet all the given criteria.\n\nSo, to answer the user's question, there are two possible solutions:\n\n- 25 nickels, 35 dimes, and 40 quarters.\n\n- 28 nickels, 31 dimes, and 41 quarters.\n\nBoth combinations satisfy the total number of coins being 100 and the total value being $14.75, with more dimes than nickels and more quarters than dimes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Two possible solutions: } (25 \\text{ nickels}, 35 \\text{ dimes}, 40 \\text{ quarters}) \\text{ and } (28 \\text{ nickels}, 31 \\text{ dimes}, 41 \\text{ quarters})} \\]"
