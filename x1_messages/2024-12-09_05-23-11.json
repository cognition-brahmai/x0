        "content": "So I've got this question here about a ship or airship that sank or crashed on its maiden voyage, and it's asking for the name of the vessel and how many casualties there were. From what I remember, the Titanic comes to mind immediately. Let me see if that fits the description.\n\nSo, the Titanic was a British luxury passenger liner that sank in 1912 on its first voyage from Southampton to New York City. It hit an iceberg and unfortunately, more than 1,500 people lost their lives. That sounds pretty matching to what the question is asking.\n\nBut just to make sure, I should consider if there are any other notable ships or airships that had a similar fate. For instance, the Hindenburg was a German zeppelin that infamously caught fire in 1937 while trying to dock in New Jersey. That was also on its maiden voyage of the season, although not necessarily its very first voyage ever. Still, it's known for the tragic loss of lives.\n\nWait, actually, the Hindenburg disaster was quite deadly, but I think the casualty count was lower than that of the Titanic. I think around 36 people died in the Hindenburg fire, but I might be mistaken. In any case, it's important to verify the details.\n\nAnother example might be the Space Shuttle Challenger, which exploded shortly after launch in 1986, killing all seven crew members aboard. That was a spaceflight, not a ship or airship per se, so maybe not relevant here.\n\nSimilarly, the Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated during re-entry in 2003, but again, that's not a ship or airship.\n\nLet me focus back on ships and airships. The Titanic seems to be the most well-known example of a vessel sinking on its maiden voyage with a high number of casualties.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check if there are any other notable incidents involving ships or airships that had a higher casualty count or were more infamous.\n\nFor ships, there was the Lusitania, which was sunk by a German submarine in 1915 during World War I, resulting in about 1,200 deaths. That's still tragic, but the Titanic had a higher death toll.\n\nThen there's the RMS Republic, which sank in 1909 after colliding with another ship, but I think the casualties were minimal compared to the Titanic.\n\nIn terms of airships, apart from the Hindenburg, there was the USS Akron, a US Navy airship that crashed in 1933, killing 73 people. That's a significant number, but again, lower than the Titanic's toll.\n\nSo, comparatively, the Titanic stands out as the most catastrophic in terms of loss of life on a maiden voyage.\n\nNow, to answer the question directly: the name of the ship was the Titanic, and there were more than 1,500 casualties.\n\nBut I should double-check the exact number of casualties to provide an accurate answer.\n\nFrom various sources, including the one you provided from History.com, it's stated that more than 1,500 people died. Some sources specify that 1,517 people died, but the exact number can vary slightly depending on the source.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Titanic carried about 2,224 passengers and crew, and only around 710 people survived, which aligns with the over 1,500 fatalities.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the Titanic was the ship that sank on its maiden voyage, resulting in more than 1,500 casualties.\n\nBut just to explore a bit further, was there any other vessel, perhaps less famous, that had a higher casualty count on its maiden voyage?\n\nAfter a quick search, I come across the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff, a German cruise ship that was sunk by a Soviet submarine in 1945, resulting in an estimated 9,000 deaths, mostly refugees. That's a staggering number, but it wasn't on its maiden voyage; it was actually at the end of World War II.\n\nSo, in terms of peacetime disasters, the Titanic remains the most deadly in terms of loss of life for a ship on its maiden voyage.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is that the Titanic was the ship that sank on its maiden voyage, with more than 1,500 casualties.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The Titanic, with more than 1,500 casualties.}} \\]\n\n**Explanation**\n\nThe Titanic was a British luxury passenger liner that tragically sank on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City in April 1912 after hitting an iceberg. This disaster resulted in the loss of more than 1,500 lives, making it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime catastrophes in history. The ship's demise has become synonymous with tragedy and is etched in history due to the combination of its opulence, the era's technological hubris, and the appalling loss of life."
