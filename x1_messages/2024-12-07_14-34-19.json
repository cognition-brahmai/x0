        "content": "Let's see. There are 3 red balls and 4 blue balls in a bag, so total balls are 3 + 4 = 7 balls.\n\nI need to pick two balls without replacement, and I want to find the probability that I pick one ball of each color. That means either a red first and then a blue, or a blue first and then a red.\n\nFirst, I can calculate the total number of ways to pick two balls out of seven. That's a combination problem, right? The number of combinations of 7 balls taken 2 at a time.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, C(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7 - 2)!) = (7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 5!) = (7 \u00d7 6) / 2 = 21.\n\nSo, there are 21 possible ways to pick two balls out of seven.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of ways to pick one red and one blue ball.\n\nThere are 3 red balls and 4 blue balls.\n\nThe number of ways to pick one red and one blue is the product of the number of red balls and the number of blue balls.\n\nSo, that's 3 \u00d7 4 = 12.\n\nTherefore, there are 12 favorable outcomes.\n\nSo, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n\nThat is, Probability = 12 / 21.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 3.\n\nSo, 12 \u00f7 3 = 4, and 21 \u00f7 3 = 7.\n\nTherefore, Probability = 4/7.\n\nWait, is there another way to approach this?\n\nMaybe using probabilities step by step.\n\nFirst, the probability of picking a red ball first is 3/7.\n\nThen, given that the first ball was red, the probability of picking a blue ball next is 4/6, because there are 4 blue balls left out of 6 total balls.\n\nSo, the probability of red first and then blue is (3/7) \u00d7 (4/6) = (3/7) \u00d7 (2/3) = 2/7.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking a blue ball first is 4/7.\n\nThen, given that the first ball was blue, the probability of picking a red ball next is 3/6 = 1/2.\n\nSo, the probability of blue first and then red is (4/7) \u00d7 (1/2) = 4/14 = 2/7.\n\nTherefore, the total probability of picking one of each color is the sum of these two probabilities: 2/7 + 2/7 = 4/7.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the probability is 4/7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{7}} \\]"
