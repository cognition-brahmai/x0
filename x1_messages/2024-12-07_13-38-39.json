        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: a group of people donated money for charity, the average donation per person was $40, and the total amount collected was $2,000. I need to find out how many people were in the group.\n\nOkay, so I know that the average donation is the total amount collected divided by the number of people. Right? So, average donation per person = total amount / number of people.\n\nIn this case, the average is $40, and the total is $2,000. So, I can set up the equation like this:\n\n40 = 2000 / number of people\n\nI need to solve for the number of people. So, I can rearrange the equation to find the number of people:\n\nNumber of people = 2000 / 40\n\nLet me do that calculation. 2000 divided by 40.\n\n40 times 50 is 2000. So, the number of people is 50.\n\nWait, is there another way to think about this to double-check? Maybe using the concept of total donations.\n\nIf each person donated an average of $40, and there were 50 people, then the total should be 40 times 50, which is 2000. That matches the total amount collected.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of summing up all the individual donations. If the average is $40, and there are 50 people, the sum would be 50 times 40, which is indeed $2,000.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that the total amount is the sum of all individual donations. If the average donation is $40, then the sum is $2,000, so the number of donations, which is the number of people, would be 2000 divided by 40, which again is 50.\n\nI think that makes sense. Is there any other angle I should consider to ensure I'm not missing something?\n\nMaybe I should consider if all donations were exactly $40. The problem says the average donation was $40, so some people might have donated more and some less, but on average, it's $40. But for the purpose of finding the number of people, the average should suffice.\n\nAlternatively, if I were given more information, like the distribution of donations or specific amounts donated by individual people, that might change things. But with the information provided, using the average to find the number of people seems correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's a possibility of fractional people, which doesn't make sense. The number of people should be a whole number, and in this case, 2000 divided by 40 is exactly 50, so that's perfect.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. All amounts are in dollars, and the average and total are consistent in units, so that's okay.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can plug the number back into the original equation to verify:\n\nAverage donation = total amount / number of people\n\n40 = 2000 / 50\n\n40 = 40\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. There are 50 people in the group.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]\n"
