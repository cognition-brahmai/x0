        "content": "So I need to prove that the determinant of a matrix A is equal to the product of its eigenvalues. Let's see, eigenvalues are special scalars associated with a matrix, and the determinant is a scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix. I think there's a connection here, but I need to figure out how they're related.\n\nFirst, I recall that eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of the matrix. The characteristic polynomial is defined as the determinant of (A - \u03bbI), where I is the identity matrix and \u03bb is a scalar. So, the eigenvalues \u03bb1, \u03bb2, ..., \u03bbn are the solutions to the equation det(A - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nNow, the determinant of a matrix is a product of its eigenvalues. That means det(A) = \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 * ... * \u03bbn. But how do I prove this?\n\nMaybe I can start by considering that A is a diagonalizable matrix. If A is diagonalizable, then there exists an invertible matrix P such that P\u207b\u00b9AP = D, where D is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues \u03bb1, \u03bb2, ..., \u03bbn on its diagonal.\n\nIf A is diagonalizable, then det(A) = det(PDP\u207b\u00b9). I know that the determinant of a product of matrices is the product of their determinants, so det(A) = det(P) * det(D) * det(P\u207b\u00b9).\n\nAlso, det(P\u207b\u00b9) = 1/det(P), so det(A) = det(P) * det(D) * (1/det(P)) = det(D).\n\nSince D is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues on the diagonal, det(D) = \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 * ... * \u03bbn.\n\nTherefore, det(A) = \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 * ... * \u03bbn.\n\nThat makes sense for diagonalizable matrices, but what about matrices that are not diagonalizable? Do they still satisfy this property?\n\nI think they do. Even if A is not diagonalizable, it can be transformed into its Jordan canonical form. In the Jordan form, the matrix is composed of Jordan blocks corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nEach Jordan block has the eigenvalue on the diagonal, and the determinant of a Jordan block is just the eigenvalue raised to the size of the block.\n\nSince the determinant of a block diagonal matrix is the product of the determinants of the blocks, the overall determinant would still be the product of all the eigenvalues, even with their algebraic multiplicities.\n\nWait, but in the Jordan form, some eigenvalues might have algebraic multiplicities greater than their geometric multiplicities, which is why the matrix isn't diagonalizable. But still, the determinant should account for all eigenvalues, including their multiplicities.\n\nLet me think about a 2x2 matrix for simplicity. Suppose A is a 2x2 matrix with eigenvalues \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nIf A is diagonalizable, then det(A) = \u03bb1 * \u03bb2.\n\nIf A is not diagonalizable, it might have a Jordan block like [\u03bb 1; 0 \u03bb], and the determinant of this block is \u03bb^2.\n\nBut in this case, both eigenvalues are \u03bb, so \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = \u03bb, and det(A) = \u03bb * \u03bb = \u03bb^2.\n\nSo it still holds.\n\nAlternatively, consider a nilpotent matrix, where all eigenvalues are zero. The determinant should be zero, which is the product of the eigenvalues.\n\nOkay, so it seems to work in these cases.\n\nAnother way to look at it is through the characteristic polynomial. The characteristic polynomial of A is p(\u03bb) = det(A - \u03bbI).\n\nThis is a polynomial of degree n, where n is the size of the matrix.\n\nThe eigenvalues are the roots of this polynomial, so p(\u03bb) = (\u03bb - \u03bb1)(\u03bb - \u03bb2)...(\u03bb - \u03bbn).\n\nOn the other hand, det(A - \u03bbI) is a polynomial in \u03bb, and when \u03bb = 0, det(A - 0I) = det(A).\n\nSo, p(0) = det(A).\n\nBut p(0) = (0 - \u03bb1)(0 - \u03bb2)...(0 - \u03bbn) = (-1)^n * \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 * ... * \u03bbn.\n\nTherefore, det(A) = (-1)^n * \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 * ... * \u03bbn.\n\nWait, that seems off. Because in the diagonalizable case, we had det(A) = \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 * ... * \u03bbn without the (-1)^n factor.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nLet me recall that the characteristic polynomial is p(\u03bb) = det(A - \u03bbI).\n\nFor a diagonal matrix, say A = diag(\u03bb1, \u03bb2, ..., \u03bbn), then A - \u03bbI = diag(\u03bb1 - \u03bb, \u03bb2 - \u03bb, ..., \u03bbn - \u03bb), and det(A - \u03bbI) = (\u03bb1 - \u03bb)(\u03bb2 - \u03bb)...(\u03bbn - \u03bb).\n\nSo p(\u03bb) = (\u03bb1 - \u03bb)(\u03bb2 - \u03bb)...(\u03bbn - \u03bb).\n\nTherefore, p(0) = \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 * ... * \u03bbn.\n\nBut earlier, I thought p(\u03bb) = (\u03bb - \u03bb1)(\u03bb - \u03bb2)...(\u03bb - \u03bbn), which is different.\n\nWait, no. Actually, p(\u03bb) = det(A - \u03bbI) = (\u03bb1 - \u03bb)(\u03bb2 - \u03bb)...(\u03bbn - \u03bb).\n\nBut sometimes, people define the characteristic polynomial as det(\u03bbI - A), which would be (\u03bb - \u03bb1)(\u03bb - \u03bb2)...(\u03bb - \u03bbn).\n\nSo, perhaps there is a sign difference depending on the convention.\n\nIn standard linear algebra, the characteristic polynomial is det(A - \u03bbI), which is (\u03bb1 - \u03bb)(\u03bb2 - \u03bb)...(\u03bbn - \u03bb).\n\nTherefore, p(0) = det(A) = \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 * ... * \u03bbn.\n\nBut in some texts, it's defined as det(\u03bbI - A), which is (-1)^n det(A - \u03bbI).\n\nSo, if p(\u03bb) = det(\u03bbI - A) = (\u03bb - \u03bb1)(\u03bb - \u03bb2)...(\u03bb - \u03bbn), then p(0) = (-1)^n det(A).\n\nTherefore, det(A) = (-1)^n * p(0) = (-1)^n * (0 - \u03bb1)(0 - \u03bb2)...(0 - \u03bbn) = (-1)^n * (-1)^n * \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 * ... * \u03bbn = \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 * ... * \u03bbn.\n\nSo, regardless of the convention, det(A) equals the product of its eigenvalues.\n\nTherefore, det(A) = \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 * ... * \u03bbn.\n\nThis seems consistent with what I found earlier for diagonalizable matrices and Jordan forms.\n\nLet me summarize the proof:\n\n1. The characteristic polynomial of A is p(\u03bb) = det(A - \u03bbI).\n\n2. The eigenvalues of A are the roots of p(\u03bb), i.e., p(\u03bb) = (\u03bb1 - \u03bb)(\u03bb2 - \u03bb)...(\u03bbn - \u03bb).\n\n3. Evaluating p(0) gives p(0) = det(A - 0I) = det(A) = \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 * ... * \u03bbn.\n\nTherefore, det(A) is equal to the product of its eigenvalues.\n\nAlternatively, if using the convention p(\u03bb) = det(\u03bbI - A), then p(\u03bb) = (\u03bb - \u03bb1)(\u03bb - \u03bb2)...(\u03bb - \u03bbn), and p(0) = (-1)^n det(A), so det(A) = (-1)^n p(0) = \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 * ... * \u03bbn.\n\nIn both conventions, det(A) equals the product of its eigenvalues.\n\nThis should hold for any square matrix, whether diagonalizable or not, because the characteristic polynomial is always defined and its roots are the eigenvalues.\n\nTherefore, the determinant of a matrix is equal to the product of its eigenvalues.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\det(A) = \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\cdots \\lambda_n} \\]"
