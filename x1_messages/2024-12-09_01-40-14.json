        "content": "To determine how many gallons of water a cylindrical tank can hold, we need to calculate its volume in cubic feet and then convert that volume to gallons. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the radius of the cylinder:**\n   The diameter of the tank is 6 feet, so the radius \\( r \\) is half of that:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{6 \\text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the volume of the cylinder:**\n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   where \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder. Given that the height \\( h \\) is 8 feet, we can plug in the values:\n   \\[\n   V = \\pi (3 \\text{ feet})^2 (8 \\text{ feet}) = \\pi (9 \\text{ square feet}) (8 \\text{ feet}) = 72\\pi \\text{ cubic feet}\n   \\]\n   Using the approximation \\( \\pi \\approx 3.14159 \\):\n   \\[\n   V \\approx 72 \\times 3.14159 \\approx 226.19472 \\text{ cubic feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert cubic feet to gallons:**\n   We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \\( G \\) is:\n   \\[\n   G = 226.19472 \\text{ cubic feet} \\times 7.48 \\text{ gallons per cubic foot} \\approx 1692.52 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the tank can hold approximately 1692.52 gallons of water.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1692.52} \\]"
