        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a company with 500 employees, and 60% of them are male. First, I need to find out how many male employees there are initially.\n\nTo find 60% of 500, I can calculate:\n\n0.60 \u00d7 500 = 300\n\nSo, there are 300 male employees initially.\n\nNow, the company hires an additional 100 employees, and 70% of these new hires are female. That means 30% of the new hires are male, right? Because 100% - 70% = 30%.\n\nSo, the number of new male employees is:\n\n0.30 \u00d7 100 = 30\n\nTherefore, the total number of male employees after the new hires is:\n\n300 (initial males) + 30 (new males) = 330 males\n\nNow, the total number of employees after hiring the additional 100 is:\n\n500 (original employees) + 100 (new hires) = 600 employees\n\nTo find the new percentage of male employees, I need to divide the number of male employees by the total number of employees and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nSo, the calculation is:\n\n(330 / 600) \u00d7 100 = ?\n\nFirst, divide 330 by 600:\n\n330 \u00f7 600 = 0.55\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n0.55 \u00d7 100 = 55%\n\nTherefore, the new percentage of male employees in the company is 55%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{55\\%} \\]"
