        "content": "So I've got this problem here: In a town, 60% of people own a car, 40% own a bicycle, and 20% own both a car and a bicycle. I need to find out what percentage own either a car or a bicycle. Okay, let's see.\n\nI remember there's a principle in set theory called the inclusion-exclusion principle that might be useful here. It's about adding the sizes of two sets and then subtracting the intersection to avoid double-counting. So, if I have set A as car owners and set B as bicycle owners, then the percentage that owns either a car or a bicycle would be A plus B minus the intersection of A and B.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nPercentage owning either a car or a bicycle = % owning cars + % owning bicycles - % owning both.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n60% + 40% - 20% = 80%.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to look at this to confirm?\n\nMaybe I can think about the Venn diagram. There would be two circles overlapping. One circle represents car owners, the other represents bicycle owners. The overlapping part is those who own both.\n\nSo, the car owners circle is 60%, bicycle owners circle is 40%, and the overlap is 20%.\n\nTo find those who own either, I need to add the parts of the circles without double-counting the overlap.\n\nSo, car owners only would be 60% - 20% = 40%.\n\nBicycle owners only would be 40% - 20% = 20%.\n\nThen, adding the car only, bicycle only, and both should give me the total owning either.\n\nSo, 40% (car only) + 20% (bicycle only) + 20% (both) = 80%.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier using the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nIs there any other angle I should consider? Maybe thinking about those who don't own either.\n\nIf 80% own either a car or a bicycle, then 20% own neither.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nWell, according to the numbers:\n\nTotal percentage = % owning only cars + % owning only bicycles + % owning both + % owning neither.\n\nPlugging in:\n\n40% (only cars) + 20% (only bicycles) + 20% (both) + % owning neither = 100%.\n\nSo, 40% + 20% + 20% = 80%, which means 20% own neither.\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula:\n\n% owning either a car or a bicycle = 100% - % owning neither.\n\nBut I already have 80% from the previous calculation, and 100% - 20% = 80%, which matches.\n\nSo, I think 80% is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of misunderstanding the problem.\n\nThe problem says \"own either a car or a bicycle.\" Does that include those who own both?\n\nIn logical terms, \"either A or B\" typically includes both A and B, as well as just A or just B.\n\nSo, yes, those who own both are included in \"either.\"\n\nTherefore, 80% seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use probabilities or proportions.\n\nIf I consider the town has 100 people for simplicity:\n\n- 60 own cars\n\n- 40 own bicycles\n\n- 20 own both\n\nThen, the number who own only cars is 60 - 20 = 40\n\nThe number who own only bicycles is 40 - 20 = 20\n\nSo, total owning either is 40 + 20 + 20 = 80\n\nTherefore, 80 out of 100, which is 80%.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same conclusion.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80\\%} \\]"
