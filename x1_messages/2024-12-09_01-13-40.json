        "content": "So I have this problem here about a rectangular garden that's 30 meters long and 20 meters wide. The owner wants to build a fence around the entire garden, but there's also going to be a 1-meter-wide walkway outside the fence. I need to find out what the perimeter of the fence will be.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize this setup. There's a rectangular garden that measures 30 meters in length and 20 meters in width. Around this garden, there's going to be a fence, and outside that fence, there's a 1-meter-wide walkway. So, the fence isn't right against the garden; there's a walkway that's 1 meter wide all around the fence.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says the walkway is outside the fence, which means the fence is right along the edge of the garden, and then there's a 1-meter walkway outside the fence. But, if that's the case, why would the fence not be just around the garden itself? Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"a rectangular garden has a length of 30 meters and a width of 20 meters. If the owner wants to build a fence around the entire garden with an additional 1-meter-wide walkway outside the fence, what will be the perimeter of the fence?\"\n\nOkay, so the fence is around the garden, and then there's a 1-meter walkway outside the fence. So, the fence is surrounding the garden, and the walkway is surrounding the fence.\n\nBut, to find the perimeter of the fence, do I need to consider the walkway at all? The perimeter of the fence should just be based on the dimensions of the garden, right?\n\nWait, but the fence is built around the garden, and then there's a walkway outside the fence. So, the fence's perimeter is directly related to the garden's dimensions.\n\nBut, if the walkway is outside the fence, and it's 1 meter wide, that shouldn't affect the perimeter of the fence, should it? Unless the walkway is built around the fence, making the fence larger.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the fence is built such that there's a 1-meter walkway between the garden and the fence. In that case, the fence would be 1 meter outside the garden on all sides.\n\nLet me consider that. If the garden is 30 meters long and 20 meters wide, and the fence is built 1 meter outside the garden on all sides, then the fence would encompass the garden plus an additional 1 meter on every side.\n\nSo, effectively, the length of the area enclosed by the fence would be the length of the garden plus 2 meters (1 meter on each end), and similarly for the width.\n\nSo, the total length enclosed by the fence would be 30 meters + 2 meters = 32 meters, and the total width would be 20 meters + 2 meters = 22 meters.\n\nThen, the perimeter of the fence would be the perimeter of this larger rectangle, which is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width.\n\nSo, perimeter = 2 * 32 meters + 2 * 22 meters.\n\nLet me calculate that: 2 * 32 is 64 meters, and 2 * 22 is 44 meters. So, total perimeter is 64 + 44 = 108 meters.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions that the walkway is outside the fence, not between the garden and the fence. Maybe I misinterpreted.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"build a fence around the entire garden with an additional 1-meter-wide walkway outside the fence.\"\n\nSo, the fence is around the garden, and then there's a walkway outside the fence. So, the fence is right against the garden, and the walkway is outside the fence.\n\nIn that case, the perimeter of the fence should still be based on the garden's dimensions, without considering the walkway, because the walkway is outside the fence.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the fence would simply be the perimeter of the garden, which is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width: 2*30 + 2*20 = 60 + 40 = 100 meters.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the fence is built 1 meter outside the garden on all sides, making the enclosed area larger, but according to the problem, the walkway is outside the fence, not between the garden and the fence.\n\nSo, perhaps the fence is built along the outer edge of the walkway.\n\nWait, if the walkway is outside the fence, then the fence must be between the garden and the walkway.\n\nSo, the garden is inside the fence, and the walkway is outside the fence.\n\nTherefore, the fence surrounds the garden, and the walkway surrounds the fence.\n\nIn that case, the fence is right against the garden, and the walkway is 1 meter wide around the fence.\n\nBut, to find the perimeter of the fence, I need to consider the dimensions of the area it encloses, which is the garden plus the walkway.\n\nWait, no. The fence encloses the garden, and the walkway is outside the fence.\n\nSo, the fence's perimeter should be based on the garden's dimensions.\n\nBut, if the walkway is outside the fence, and it's 1 meter wide, then the walkway extends 1 meter outside the fence on all sides.\n\nBut, the perimeter of the fence should still be based on the garden's dimensions, unless the walkway affects the fence's position.\n\nI'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try to sketch this out mentally.\n\n- There's a garden that's 30m by 20m.\n\n- Around the garden, there's a fence.\n\n- Around the fence, there's a 1m wide walkway.\n\nSo, the fence is between the garden and the walkway.\n\nTherefore, the fence follows the shape of the garden, but it's offset by the width of the walkway.\n\nWait, but the walkway is outside the fence, so the fence is right against the garden, and the walkway is around the fence.\n\nIn that case, the fence's perimeter is simply based on the garden's dimensions.\n\nSo, the perimeter is 2*(30 + 20) = 100 meters.\n\nBut, perhaps the problem intends for the fence to be built such that there's a 1-meter walkway between the garden and the fence.\n\nIn that case, the fence would be 1 meter away from the garden on all sides, making the enclosed area larger.\n\nIf that's the case, then the length of the area enclosed by the fence would be 30m + 2*1m = 32m, and the width would be 20m + 2*1m = 22m.\n\nThen, the perimeter would be 2*(32 + 22) = 2*54 = 108 meters.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the walkway is outside the fence, not between the garden and the fence.\n\nSo, perhaps the fence is built along the garden's edge, and the walkway is built outside the fence, adding an additional 1 meter on all sides.\n\nIn that case, the perimeter of the fence should still be based on the garden's dimensions, which is 100 meters.\n\nBut, if the walkway is outside the fence, and it's 1 meter wide, then the total area including the garden, fence, and walkway would be garden plus fence plus walkway.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the total area step by step.\n\nFirst, there's the garden: 30m by 20m.\n\nThen, there's the fence around the garden.\n\nFinally, there's a 1m wide walkway around the fence.\n\nSo, the fence is between the garden and the walkway.\n\nTherefore, the fence surrounds the garden, and the walkway surrounds the fence.\n\nSo, the fence's perimeter is based on the garden's dimensions, and the walkway adds an additional 1 meter on all sides outside the fence.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the fence should be 2*(length + width) = 2*(30 + 20) = 100 meters.\n\nBut, maybe the problem wants the perimeter of the outer edge of the walkway.\n\nWait, no, it specifically says \"the perimeter of the fence.\"\n\nSo, I should stick with the perimeter based on the garden's dimensions, which is 100 meters.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's confusion in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fence is built 1 meter outside the garden on all sides, and then the walkway is built outside the fence.\n\nIn that case, the fence would be 1 meter away from the garden on all sides, so the enclosed area by the fence would be 32m by 22m, and the perimeter would be 108 meters.\n\nBut according to the problem, the walkway is outside the fence, so perhaps this is the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the walkway is built outside the fence, adding an additional 1 meter on all sides, but the fence is built right against the garden.\n\nIn that case, the fence's perimeter is 100 meters, and the walkway adds another 1 meter on all sides outside the fence.\n\nBut since the question asks for the perimeter of the fence, it should be 100 meters.\n\nI'm getting conflicting interpretations here.\n\nMaybe I should consider both possibilities and see which one makes more sense.\n\nFirst possibility:\n\n- Fence is built right against the garden.\n\n- Walkway is built outside the fence, 1 meter wide.\n\nIn this case, the fence's perimeter is 2*(30 + 20) = 100 meters.\n\nSecond possibility:\n\n- Fence is built 1 meter outside the garden on all sides.\n\n- Walkway is built outside the fence, 1 meter wide.\n\nIn this case, the fence's perimeter is 2*(30 + 2 + 20 + 2) = 2*(32 + 22) = 108 meters.\n\nBut according to the problem, it says \"build a fence around the entire garden with an additional 1-meter-wide walkway outside the fence.\"\n\nThis seems to suggest that the fence is around the garden, and the walkway is outside the fence.\n\nTherefore, the fence is right against the garden, and the walkway is outside the fence.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the fence should be based on the garden's dimensions, which is 100 meters.\n\nBut, perhaps the problem wants the perimeter of the fence that includes the walkway.\n\nWait, no, it's clear: \"with an additional 1-meter-wide walkway outside the fence.\"\n\nSo, the fence is around the garden, and then there's a walkway outside the fence.\n\nTherefore, the fence's perimeter is independent of the walkway.\n\nThus, the perimeter is 100 meters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fence is built such that there's a 1-meter walkway between the garden and the fence.\n\nIn that case, the fence would be 1 meter outside the garden on all sides, making the enclosed area 32m by 22m, and the perimeter 108 meters.\n\nBut according to the problem, the walkway is outside the fence, not between the garden and the fence.\n\nTherefore, the fence is right against the garden, and the walkway is outside the fence.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter is 100 meters.\n\nI think that's the correct interpretation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
