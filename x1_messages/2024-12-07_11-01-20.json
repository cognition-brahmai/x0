        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 450 units every day, and each unit sells for $25. We need to find out how much revenue will be generated after 30 days.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate the daily revenue. That would be the number of units produced each day multiplied by the price per unit. So, 450 units times $25 per unit.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 450 times 25.\n\nWell, 450 times 20 is 9,000, and 450 times 5 is 2,250. Adding those together, 9,000 plus 2,250 equals 11,250. So, the daily revenue is $11,250.\n\nNow, to find the revenue after 30 days, I need to multiply the daily revenue by the number of days. So, $11,250 times 30.\n\nLet's calculate that: 11,250 times 30.\n\nWell, 11,250 times 10 is 112,500, so 11,250 times 30 would be three times that, which is 337,500.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 30 times 11,250 as 30 times 10,000, which is 300,000, plus 30 times 1,250, which is 37,500. Adding those together gives 337,500.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, the total revenue after 30 days would be $337,500.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me verify the initial steps again.\n\nWe have 450 units per day, each selling for $25.\n\n450 times 25 is indeed 11,250, as I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, 11,250 multiplied by 30 days equals 337,500.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach it by first calculating the total number of units produced in 30 days and then multiplying by the price per unit.\n\nSo, total units in 30 days would be 450 units/day times 30 days, which is 13,500 units.\n\nThen, 13,500 units times $25 per unit.\n\nLet's do that multiplication: 13,500 times 25.\n\n10,000 times 25 is 250,000.\n\n3,000 times 25 is 75,000.\n\n500 times 25 is 12,500.\n\nAdding those together: 250,000 plus 75,000 is 325,000, plus 12,500 is 337,500.\n\nSo, again, $337,500.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the revenue generated after 30 days would be $337,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{337500} \\]"
