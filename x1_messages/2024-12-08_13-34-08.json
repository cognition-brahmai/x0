        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. Developing a simple command-line calculator in Golang is a great way to get started with programming in Go. I'll guide you through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/). After installation, set up your workspace and ensure that your environment variables are correctly configured.\n\nNow, let's start building the calculator.\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Go File\n\nCreate a new file named `calculator.go`. You can do this using your preferred text editor or IDE.\n\n### Step 2: Import necessary packages\n\nIn Go, you need to import packages at the beginning of your file. For this calculator, we'll need the `fmt` package for input and output operations.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"strconv\"\n)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Define the main function\n\nEvery Go program starts with the `main` function. We'll write our code inside this function.\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n\tif len(os.Args) != 4 {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Usage: go run calculator.go num1 operator num2\")\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tnum1Str := os.Args[1]\n\toperator := os.Args[2]\n\tnum2Str := os.Args[3]\n\n\tnum1, err := strconv.ParseFloat(num1Str, 64)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error: Invalid number format for num1\")\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tnum2, err := strconv.ParseFloat(num2Str, 64)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error: Invalid number format for num2\")\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tvar result float64\n\n\tswitch operator {\n\tcase \"+\":\n\t\tresult = num1 + num2\n\tcase \"-\":\n\t\tresult = num1 - num2\n\tcase \"*\":\n\t\tresult = num1 * num2\n\tcase \"/\":\n\t\tif num2 == 0 {\n\t\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error: Division by zero\")\n\t\t\treturn\n\t\t}\n\t\tresult = num1 / num2\n\tdefault:\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error: Invalid operator. Use +, -, *, or /\")\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tfmt.Printf(\"%.2f %s %.2f = %.2f\\n\", num1, operator, num2, result)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Check Arguments:** Ensure that exactly three arguments are provided (num1, operator, num2). If not, print usage instructions.\n2. **Parse Numbers:** Convert the string arguments to floating-point numbers using `strconv.ParseFloat`. Handle any errors that occur during parsing.\n3. **Perform Operation:** Use a switch statement to perform the specified operation:\n   - Addition (+)\n   - Subtraction (-)\n   - Multiplication (*)\n   - Division (/)\n4. **Handle Division by Zero:** If the operator is '/' and num2 is zero, print an error message.\n5. **Print Result:** Format and print the result with two decimal places.\n\n### Step 4: Run the Program\n\nSave your file and run the program from the command line. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```sh\ngo run calculator.go 5 + 3\n```\n\nThis should output:\n\n```\n5.00 + 3.00 = 8.00\n```\n\nYou can test with other operations like subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n### Step 5: Handle Edge Cases\n\nMake sure to test your program with different inputs, including edge cases such as:\n\n- Non-numeric inputs\n- Division by zero\n- Invalid operators\n\nThis will help you ensure that your program handles errors gracefully.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCongratulations! You've built a simple command-line calculator in Golang. This is a great starting point for learning more about Go and command-line applications. You can expand this calculator by adding more features like handling more operators, supporting multiple arguments, or even creating a GUI version.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
