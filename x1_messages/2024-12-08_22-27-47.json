        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A company produces items, and for every 5 defective items, there are 95 non-defective ones. So, the total of items in this ratio is 5 plus 95, which is 100 items. Out of these 100 items, 5 are defective. Now, the company produces a total of 10,000 items. I need to find out how many of these are expected to be defective.\n\nFirst, I should understand the ratio of defective to total items. Since there are 5 defective items out of 100 total items, the defective rate is 5%. That makes sense because 5 divided by 100 is 0.05, which is 5%.\n\nSo, if the defective rate is 5%, and the company produces 10,000 items, then the number of defective items should be 5% of 10,000.\n\nLet me calculate that. 5% of 10,000 is 0.05 times 10,000, which is 500.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf there are 5 defective items in every 100 items, then in 10,000 items, there would be 10,000 divided by 100, which is 100 sets of 100 items. Each set has 5 defective items, so 100 sets times 5 defective items per set is 500 defective items.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could use proportions. If 5 defective items are in 100 total items, then x defective items are in 10,000 total items.\n\nSo, 5/100 = x/10,000.\n\nSolving for x, I can cross-multiply: 5 * 10,000 = 100 * x.\n\nThat gives me 50,000 = 100x.\n\nThen, x = 50,000 / 100 = 500.\n\nAgain, I get 500 defective items.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using decimals.\n\nThe defective rate is 5%, which is 0.05 in decimal form.\n\nSo, 0.05 times 10,000 is 500.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of fractions.\n\n5 defective out of 100 total is 5/100, which simplifies to 1/20.\n\nSo, one in every 20 items is defective.\n\nTherefore, in 10,000 items, the number of defective items is 10,000 divided by 20, which is 500.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIt seems like no matter which way I approach this, I keep getting 500 defective items.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nIs there any possibility that the defect rate changes with the number of items produced? The problem doesn't suggest that, so I can assume the defect rate remains constant.\n\nAlso, the problem says \"expected to be defective.\" That suggests an average or mean value, which aligns with the approach I've taken.\n\nSo, I think 500 is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me try one more approach to confirm.\n\nSuppose I use the concept of probabilities.\n\nThe probability that an item is defective is 5/100, which is 0.05.\n\nTherefore, for 10,000 items, the expected number of defective items is 10,000 times 0.05, which is 500.\n\nOnce again, the same answer.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the expected number of defective items is 500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500} \\]"
