        "content": "So the car rental company has 150 cars in total, and they've rented out 60% of them. I need to find out how many more cars they need to rent out to reach an 80% rental rate.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many cars they've already rented out. Since they have 150 cars and have rented out 60% of them, I can calculate that by multiplying 150 by 60%.\n\n150 * 60% = 150 * 0.6 = 90 cars\n\nSo, they've rented out 90 cars already.\n\nNow, I need to find out what 80% of 150 cars is, to know the target number of cars they want to rent out.\n\n150 * 80% = 150 * 0.8 = 120 cars\n\nSo, they want to rent out 120 cars in total.\n\nTo find out how many more cars they need to rent out to reach this target, I can subtract the number of cars already rented out from the target number.\n\n120 - 90 = 30 cars\n\nTherefore, they need to rent out 30 more cars to reach an 80% rental rate.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe in terms of percentages.\n\nThey want to go from 60% rented to 80% rented. The difference is 20%.\n\nSo, 20% of 150 cars is:\n\n150 * 20% = 150 * 0.2 = 30 cars\n\nThat matches the earlier calculation. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 30 more cars.\n\nIt's always good to cross-check with different methods to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
