        "content": "So I have this problem here about students playing sports. There are 30 students in total, and among them, 16 play football, 18 play basketball, and 8 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport. Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many students play at least one of the sports, and then subtract that number from the total number of students to find out how many don't play any sport.\n\nSo, there are 16 students who play football and 18 who play basketball. If I just add those two numbers together, that would be 16 + 18 = 34. But wait, that's more than the total number of students, which is 30. That can't be right. Oh, right, because some students play both sports. So, those 8 students who play both sports have been counted twice, once in football and once in basketball.\n\nTo correct that, I need to subtract the number of students who play both sports from the total who play at least one sport. So, it should be 16 + 18 - 8 = 26 students who play at least one sport.\n\nNow, since there are 30 students in total, the number of students who don't play either sport would be 30 - 26 = 4.\n\nLet me just double-check that. If 16 play football, 18 play basketball, and 8 play both, then the number who play only football is 16 - 8 = 8, and the number who play only basketball is 18 - 8 = 10. Then, adding those who play only football, only basketball, and both, that's 8 + 10 + 8 = 26 students. Yes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, 26 students play at least one sport, and 30 - 26 = 4 students don't play either sport.\n\nI think that makes sense."
