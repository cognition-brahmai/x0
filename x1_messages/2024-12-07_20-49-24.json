If there are 10 tables and 6 lamps in the room, that might take up some space, so there might be less room for chairs. But without knowing the exact dimensions of the room and the furniture, it's hard to say how many chairs can fit. Maybe if we knew the area of the room and the area occupied by each table and lamp, we could calculate the remaining space for chairs. But I don't have that information right now. Maybe you can provide more details?"
