        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here about apples in a store. There are three types: Red Delicious, Gala, and Granny Smith. And there are some relationships between the numbers of each type. Specifically, it says there are twice as many Red Delicious apples as Gala apples, and half as many Granny Smith apples as Red Delicious apples. Then, it tells me there are 24 Gala apples and asks for the total number of apples.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand the relationships between the quantities of these apples.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let G be the number of Gala apples.\n\n- Let R be the number of Red Delicious apples.\n\n- Let S be the number of Granny Smith apples.\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\n1. There are twice as many Red Delicious apples as Gala apples. So, R = 2G.\n\n2. There are half as many Granny Smith apples as Red Delicious apples. So, S = (1/2)R.\n\nAnd it's given that G = 24.\n\nSo, I can plug in the value of G into the first equation to find R.\n\nR = 2 * 24 = 48.\n\nNow, using the value of R to find S.\n\nS = (1/2) * 48 = 24.\n\nSo, now I have:\n\n- Gala apples: 24\n\n- Red Delicious apples: 48\n\n- Granny Smith apples: 24\n\nTo find the total number of apples, I just need to add these up.\n\nTotal apples = G + R + S = 24 + 48 + 24.\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\n24 + 48 is 72, and 72 + 24 is 96.\n\nSo, there are 96 apples in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I've interpreted the relationships correctly.\n\nIt says \"twice as many Red Delicious as Gala apples,\" which I translated to R = 2G, and that seems right because if there are twice as many Red Delicious compared to Gala, you multiply Gala by 2 to get Red Delicious.\n\nThen, \"half as many Granny Smith as Red Delicious apples\" translates to S = (1/2)R, meaning Granny Smith apples are half the number of Red Delicious apples, which also seems correct.\n\nGiven that G is 24, R is indeed 48, and S is 24.\n\nAdding them up: 24 + 48 + 24 = 96.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of ratios.\n\nIf G = 24, and R = 2G = 48, and S = (1/2)R = 24, then the ratio of G:R:S is 24:48:24, which simplifies to 1:2:1.\n\nSo, for every Gala apple, there are two Red Delicious and one Granny Smith.\n\nBut since G is 24, then R is 48, and S is 24, totaling 96.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the total in terms of Gala apples.\n\nSince R = 2G and S = (1/2)R = (1/2)*(2G) = G.\n\nSo, S = G.\n\nTherefore, total apples = G + R + S = G + 2G + G = 4G.\n\nGiven that G = 24, total apples = 4 * 24 = 96.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the total number of apples is 96.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{96} \\]"
