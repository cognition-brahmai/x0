        "content": "Alright, I'm going to build a simple web server in Golang that serves static files from a specified directory. It will have two main endpoints: one for uploading files via POST requests and another for downloading files via GET requests. I'll be using the Gorilla Mux router for handling these routes.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up my project structure. I'll create a new directory for my project, say `fileserver`, and inside it, I'll have the following:\n\n- `main.go`: This will contain the main function and set up the server.\n\n- `static/`: This directory will hold the static files that I want to serve.\n\nI should also make sure I have the necessary packages installed. Since I'm using Gorilla Mux, I need to install that package. I can do this using:\n\n```bash\ngo get -u github.com/gorilla/mux\n```\n\nNow, let's start by setting up the basic server that serves static files. I can use the `http.FileServer` handler for this purpose.\n\nHere's a rough outline of what `main.go` might look like:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"github.com/gorilla/mux\"\n    \"log\"\n    \"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    router := mux.NewRouter()\n\n    // Serve static files from the \"static\" directory\n    staticFiles := http.FileServer(http.Dir(\"static\"))\n    router.PathPrefix(\"/static/\").Handler(http.StripPrefix(\"/static/\", staticFiles))\n\n    // Start the server\n    log.Println(\"Starting server on :8080\")\n    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", router))\n}\n```\n\nThis sets up a server that listens on port 8080 and serves static files from the `static` directory, accessible via `/static/` URL path.\n\nNext, I need to add the endpoint for uploading files. I'll create a handler function for this purpose and register it with Gorilla Mux.\n\nFor file uploads, I'll expect the file to be sent as part of a multipart form. So, in my handler, I need to parse the form and save the uploaded file to the `static` directory.\n\nHere's how I might implement the upload handler:\n\n```go\nfunc uploadFileHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    r.ParseMultipartForm(10 << 20) // Set memory limit to 10MB\n\n    file, handler, err := r.FormFile(\"file\")\n    if err != nil {\n        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusBadRequest)\n        w.Write([]byte(\"Error retrieving file from form: \" + err.Error()))\n        return\n    }\n    defer file.Close()\n\n    // Create a new file in the static directory with the same name as the uploaded file\n    filepath := \"static/\" + handler.Filename\n    outFile, err := os.Create(filepath)\n    if err != nil {\n        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)\n        w.Write([]byte(\"Error creating file: \" + err.Error()))\n        return\n    }\n    defer outFile.Close()\n\n    // Copy the uploaded file to the new file\n    _, err = io.Copy(outFile, file)\n    if err != nil {\n        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)\n        w.Write([]byte(\"Error saving file: \" + err.Error()))\n        return\n    }\n\n    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)\n    w.Write([]byte(\"File uploaded successfully\"))\n}\n```\n\nI need to import the necessary packages:\n\n```go\nimport (\n    \"io\"\n    \"net/http\"\n    \"os\"\n\n    \"github.com/gorilla/mux\"\n    \"log\"\n)\n```\n\nAnd register this handler with the router:\n\n```go\nrouter.HandleFunc(\"/upload\", uploadFileHandler).Methods(\"POST\")\n```\n\nNow, for the download endpoint, I need a handler that takes the file name as a parameter and sends the corresponding file back to the client.\n\nI can achieve this by creating another handler that constructs the file path based on the provided file name and then serves that file using `http.ServeFile`.\n\nHere's a possible implementation:\n\n```go\nfunc downloadFileHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    vars := mux.Vars(r)\n    filename := vars[\"filename\"]\n\n    filepath := \"static/\" + filename\n\n    // Check if the file exists\n    _, err := os.Stat(filepath)\n    if os.IsNotExist(err) {\n        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusNotFound)\n        w.Write([]byte(\"File not found\"))\n        return\n    }\n\n    // Serve the file\n    http.ServeFile(w, r, filepath)\n}\n```\n\nI need to register this handler with a route that captures the filename parameter. For example:\n\n```go\nrouter.HandleFunc(\"/download/{filename}\", downloadFileHandler).Methods(\"GET\")\n```\n\nPutting it all together, my `main.go` would look something like this:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"io\"\n    \"net/http\"\n    \"os\"\n\n    \"github.com/gorilla/mux\"\n    \"log\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    router := mux.NewRouter()\n\n    // Serve static files from the \"static\" directory\n    staticFiles := http.FileServer(http.Dir(\"static\"))\n    router.PathPrefix(\"/static/\").Handler(http.StripPrefix(\"/static/\", staticFiles))\n\n    // Upload file endpoint\n    router.HandleFunc(\"/upload\", uploadFileHandler).Methods(\"POST\")\n\n    // Download file endpoint\n    router.HandleFunc(\"/download/{filename}\", downloadFileHandler).Methods(\"GET\")\n\n    // Start the server\n    log.Println(\"Starting server on :8080\")\n    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", router))\n}\n\nfunc uploadFileHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    r.ParseMultipartForm(10 << 20) // Set memory limit to 10MB\n\n    file, handler, err := r.FormFile(\"file\")\n    if err != nil {\n        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusBadRequest)\n        w.Write([]byte(\"Error retrieving file from form: \" + err.Error()))\n        return\n    }\n    defer file.Close()\n\n    // Create a new file in the static directory with the same name as the uploaded file\n    filepath := \"static/\" + handler.Filename\n    outFile, err := os.Create(filepath)\n    if err != nil {\n        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)\n        w.Write([]byte(\"Error creating file: \" + err.Error()))\n        return\n    }\n    defer outFile.Close()\n\n    // Copy the uploaded file to the new file\n    _, err = io.Copy(outFile, file)\n    if err != nil {\n        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)\n        w.Write([]byte(\"Error saving file: \" + err.Error()))\n        return\n    }\n\n    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)\n    w.Write([]byte(\"File uploaded successfully\"))\n}\n\nfunc downloadFileHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    vars := mux.Vars(r)\n    filename := vars[\"filename\"]\n\n    filepath := \"static/\" + filename\n\n    // Check if the file exists\n    _, err := os.Stat(filepath)\n    if os.IsNotExist(err) {\n        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusNotFound)\n        w.Write([]byte(\"File not found\"))\n        return\n    }\n\n    // Serve the file\n    http.ServeFile(w, r, filepath)\n}\n```\n\nThis should cover the basic requirements. However, there are a few things to consider for a more robust implementation:\n\n1. **Error Handling**: I've included basic error handling, but you might want to handle different types of errors more gracefully.\n\n2. **File Overwrites**: The upload handler will overwrite files with the same name. You might want to add logic to handle such cases, like generating unique filenames.\n\n3. **File Size Limits**: I've set a memory limit for parsing the form to 10MB, but you might need to adjust this based on your use case.\n\n4. **Security Considerations**: Ensure that users cannot upload or download files outside the intended directory to prevent directory traversal attacks. Using `http.Dir` and `http.StripPrefix` helps with this, but it's essential to validate filenames.\n\n5. **Concurrency**: Depending on the expected load, you might need to consider concurrency issues, especially when multiple uploads are happening simultaneously.\n\n6. **Logging**: Adding more detailed logging can help with debugging and monitoring the server's behavior.\n\n7. **Configuration**: Hardcoding paths and port numbers isn't ideal. Consider using environment variables or configuration files to make these parameters adjustable.\n\nOverall, this setup provides a straightforward way to serve static files, upload new files, and download existing ones using Golang and Gorilla Mux."
