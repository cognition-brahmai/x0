        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains moving towards each other. One leaves from Station A going at 60 miles per hour, and the other leaves from Station B going at 80 miles per hour. The distance between the two stations is 420 miles. I need to find out when they will meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that since both trains are moving towards each other, their speeds add up. So, the combined speed at which they are approaching each other is 60 mph plus 80 mph, which is 140 mph.\n\nNow, the total distance between the two stations is 420 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nIn this case, the distance is 420 miles, and the combined speed is 140 mph. So, plugging in the values:\n\nTime = 420 miles / 140 mph\n\nLet me calculate that. 420 divided by 140 is 3. So, the time is 3 hours.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If one train is going at 60 mph for 3 hours, it would cover 180 miles. The other train going at 80 mph for 3 hours would cover 240 miles. Adding those up, 180 plus 240 equals 420 miles, which is exactly the distance between the two stations. So, yes, it makes sense that they will meet after 3 hours.\n\nBut let's consider another way to approach this problem to confirm. Maybe I can think about how much distance they cover together each hour.\n\nEvery hour, the first train covers 60 miles, and the second train covers 80 miles. Together, they cover 140 miles per hour. So, to cover 420 miles, it would take them 420 divided by 140, which again is 3 hours. Okay, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation to find the time. Let\u2019s denote the time until they meet as t hours.\n\nIn t hours, the first train would have traveled 60t miles, and the second train would have traveled 80t miles. Since they are moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they travel should equal the total distance between the stations.\n\nSo, 60t + 80t = 420\n\nCombining like terms, that\u2019s 140t = 420\n\nNow, solving for t: t = 420 / 140 = 3 hours\n\nAgain, the same answer. It seems consistent across different methods.\n\nLet me think if there\u2019s any other way to look at this problem. Maybe using relative speed concepts.\n\nIf one object is moving towards another, the relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So, again, 60 mph + 80 mph = 140 mph.\n\nThen, time to meet would be the distance divided by the relative speed, which is 420 miles / 140 mph = 3 hours.\n\nHmm, keeps leading me back to the same answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let\u2019s consider the positions of the trains over time.\n\nAt time t=0:\n\n- Train from A is at Station A (0 miles)\n\n- Train from B is at Station B (420 miles)\n\nAt time t=1 hour:\n\n- Train from A has traveled 60 miles (position: 60 miles)\n\n- Train from B has traveled 80 miles (position: 420 - 80 = 340 miles)\n\nDistance between them: 340 - 60 = 280 miles\n\nAt t=2 hours:\n\n- Train from A: 120 miles\n\n- Train from B: 420 - 160 = 260 miles\n\nDistance between them: 260 - 120 = 140 miles\n\nAt t=3 hours:\n\n- Train from A: 180 miles\n\n- Train from B: 420 - 240 = 180 miles\n\nSo, both trains are at the 180-mile mark, meaning they meet at t=3 hours.\n\nAlright, no matter how I look at it, the answer is 3 hours.\n\nI think that\u2019s pretty much it. The trains will meet after 3 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
