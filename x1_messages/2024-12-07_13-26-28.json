        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a company with two types of employees: full-time and part-time. Full-time employees work 40 hours per week, and part-time employees work 20 hours per week. There are 25 employees in total, and together they work 800 hours per week. We need to find out how many full-time and part-time employees there are.\n\nFirst, I think it would help to define some variables. Let's let F represent the number of full-time employees and P represent the number of part-time employees. According to the problem, the total number of employees is 25, so we can write the equation:\n\nF + P = 25\n\nThat makes sense. Now, we also know that full-time employees work 40 hours per week and part-time employees work 20 hours per week. Together, they work 800 hours per week. So, we can set up another equation to represent the total hours worked:\n\n40F + 20P = 800\n\nOkay, now we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1) F + P = 25\n\n2) 40F + 20P = 800\n\nI need to solve for F and P. I'm familiar with different methods to solve systems of equations, like substitution or elimination. Maybe I'll try the elimination method here.\n\nFirst, I can simplify the second equation to make it easier. Notice that both terms in the second equation are divisible by 20. So, if I divide the entire equation by 20, I get:\n\n2F + P = 40\n\nNow, my system of equations looks like this:\n\n1) F + P = 25\n\n2) 2F + P = 40\n\nHmm, that's better. Now, to eliminate one of the variables, I can subtract the first equation from the second equation.\n\nSo, subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(2F + P) - (F + P) = 40 - 25\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n2F + P - F - P = 15\n\nWhich further simplifies to:\n\nF = 15\n\nAlright, so there are 15 full-time employees. Now, I can plug this value back into the first equation to find P.\n\nF + P = 25\n\n15 + P = 25\n\nSubtracting 15 from both sides:\n\nP = 25 - 15\n\nP = 10\n\nSo, there are 15 full-time employees and 10 part-time employees.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If there are 15 full-time employees working 40 hours each, that's 15 * 40 = 600 hours. Plus 10 part-time employees working 20 hours each, that's 10 * 20 = 200 hours. Total hours are 600 + 200 = 800 hours, which matches the total given in the problem.\n\nLooks good! I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15 \\text{ full-time employees and } 10 \\text{ part-time employees}} \\]"
