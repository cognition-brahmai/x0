        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're told that the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $1,200, and it increases by 5% each year. We need to find out what the average monthly rent will be after 3 years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 5% increase means. Percentage increase is calculated based on the current amount. So, each year, the rent will be 105% of the previous year's rent because it's increasing by 5%.\n\nLet me denote the initial rent as R0 = $1,200.\n\nAfter the first year, the rent R1 will be R0 increased by 5%, which is R0 * 1.05.\n\nAfter the second year, the rent R2 will be R1 increased by 5%, which is R1 * 1.05.\n\nAfter the third year, the rent R3 will be R2 increased by 5%, which is R2 * 1.05.\n\nSo, essentially, each year the rent is multiplied by 1.05.\n\nAlternatively, after 3 years, the rent R3 can be calculated as R0 * (1.05)^3.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, calculate 1.05 raised to the power of 3.\n\n1.05^3 = 1.05 * 1.05 * 1.05.\n\n1.05 * 1.05 = 1.1025.\n\n1.1025 * 1.05 = 1.157625.\n\nSo, 1.05^3 = 1.157625.\n\nNow, multiply this by the initial rent:\n\nR3 = $1,200 * 1.157625.\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n1200 * 1.157625 = 1200 * 1.157625.\n\nFirst, ignore the decimal and multiply 1200 by 1157625:\n\n1200 * 1157625 = 1,389,150,000.\n\nNow, count the decimal places in 1.157625. There are 6 decimal places.\n\nSo, place the decimal point in 1,389,150,000 to have 6 decimal places: 1389.150000.\n\nSo, $1,200 * 1.157625 = $1,389.15.\n\nTherefore, after 3 years, the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment in this city will be $1,389.15.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1200 * 1.157625:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1200 * 1 = 1200.\n\n1200 * 0.1 = 120.\n\n1200 * 0.05 = 60.\n\n1200 * 0.007 = 8.4.\n\n1200 * 0.0006 = 0.72.\n\n1200 * 0.00002 = 0.024.\n\n1200 * 0.000005 = 0.006.\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n1200 + 120 = 1320.\n\n1320 + 60 = 1380.\n\n1380 + 8.4 = 1388.4.\n\n1388.4 + 0.72 = 1389.12.\n\n1389.12 + 0.024 = 1389.144.\n\n1389.144 + 0.006 = 1389.15.\n\nSo, $1,389.15 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for compound interest, since this is similar to compound growth.\n\nThe formula is A = P * (1 + r)^n,\n\nwhere:\n\n- A is the amount after n periods,\n\n- P is the principal amount (initial rent),\n\n- r is the rate of increase per period,\n\n- n is the number of periods.\n\nIn this case:\n\nP = $1,200,\n\nr = 5% or 0.05,\n\nn = 3 years.\n\nSo, A = 1200 * (1 + 0.05)^3 = 1200 * (1.05)^3.\n\nWe already calculated (1.05)^3 = 1.157625,\n\nso A = 1200 * 1.157625 = $1,389.15.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the average monthly rent after 3 years will be $1,389.15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1389.15} \\]"
