        "content": "So, I've got this problem here: In a zoo, there are 4 lions, 3 tigers, and 2 bears. I need to find out how many animal legs there are in total. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many legs each type of animal has. Lions and tigers are both big cats, and bears are, well, bears. Typically, lions and tigers have 4 legs each, and bears also have 4 legs each. So, that's helpful.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n- Lions: 4 legs each\n\n- Tigers: 4 legs each\n\n- Bears: 4 legs each\n\nNow, there are 4 lions, so the total number of legs for lions would be 4 lions multiplied by 4 legs each, which is 16 legs.\n\nSimilarly, for tigers: 3 tigers times 4 legs each equals 12 legs.\n\nAnd for bears: 2 bears times 4 legs each equals 8 legs.\n\nNow, to find the total number of legs, I just need to add up these amounts.\n\nSo, 16 (lions) + 12 (tigers) + 8 (bears).\n\nLet's add those up: 16 plus 12 is 28, and then 28 plus 8 is 36.\n\nTherefore, the total number of animal legs in the zoo is 36.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to think about this? Maybe I can factor out the number of legs since each animal has 4 legs.\n\nSo, total animals are 4 lions + 3 tigers + 2 bears, which is 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 animals.\n\nEach animal has 4 legs, so 9 animals times 4 legs each equals 36 legs.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll double-check if any of these animals might have a different number of legs. For example, maybe some bears can walk on two legs, but no, bears have four legs. Lions and tigers are four-legged animals as well.\n\nAlso, considering that these are probably adult animals, so no baby animals with fewer legs or anything like that.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be 36 legs in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
