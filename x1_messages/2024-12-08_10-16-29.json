        "content": "In international relations, the concept of \"Realism\" is primarily focused on the view that states are primarily motivated by self-interest. So, the correct answer would be option C.\n\nRealism is a theory that emphasizes the role of power in international politics and suggests that states act in their own self-interest to ensure their survival and security. It's based on the idea that the international system is anarchic, meaning there is no overarching authority above states to enforce rules or resolve disputes. Therefore, states must rely on their own capabilities and pursue power to protect themselves and advance their interests.\n\nOptions A and D are more aligned with Liberalism in international relations, which emphasizes cooperation, institutions, and laws to manage international affairs and promote peace. Option B is more related to Idealism or Liberal Internationalism, which holds a positive view of human nature and believes in the possibility of achieving global peace and cooperation through moral and ethical principles.\n\nSo, in summary, Realism in international relations is all about states pursuing their self-interest in an anarchic international system, where power and security are paramount considerations."
