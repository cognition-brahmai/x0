        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a class of 30 students. Out of these, 18 play soccer, and 12 play basketball. But, there's a catch: 8 students play both sports. We need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many students play at least one of the sports, and then subtract that number from the total number of students to find those who don't play any sport.\n\nSo, if 18 students play soccer and 12 play basketball, that would initially suggest 18 + 12 = 30 students play some sport. But wait, that equals the total number of students, which would imply that every student plays at least one sport. However, we know that 8 students play both sports, meaning they've been counted twice in that addition\u2014once for soccer and once for basketball.\n\nTo correct this double-counting, I need to subtract the number of students who play both sports from the total who play at least one sport. So, the number of students who play at least one sport is 18 + 12 - 8 = 22 students.\n\nNow, if there are 30 students in total and 22 play at least one sport, then the number of students who don't play either sport is 30 - 22 = 8 students.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check. I used the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The formula for the number of students playing at least one sport is:\n\nNumber playing soccer + number playing basketball - number playing both = 18 + 12 - 8 = 22.\n\nThen, total students - those playing at least one sport = 30 - 22 = 8.\n\nThat seems correct. But just to be thorough, let's think about it another way.\n\nSuppose we have a Venn diagram with two circles: one for soccer and one for basketball. The overlap between the two circles represents students who play both sports, which is 8 students.\n\nSo, the number of students who play only soccer would be total soccer players minus those who play both, which is 18 - 8 = 10 students.\n\nSimilarly, the number of students who play only basketball would be 12 - 8 = 4 students.\n\nNow, adding up those who play only soccer, only basketball, and both, we get 10 + 4 + 8 = 22 students playing at least one sport.\n\nAgain, subtracting this from the total number of students gives us 30 - 22 = 8 students who don't play either sport.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula for the number of students who don't play any sport:\n\nTotal students - (number playing soccer + number playing basketball - number playing both) = 30 - (18 + 12 - 8) = 30 - 22 = 8.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion: 8 students do not play either sport.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to interpret the data. For example, could there be students who play more than two sports? The problem only mentions soccer and basketball, so we can assume that students play either soccer, basketball, both, or neither.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether all students play at least one sport, but clearly, from the numbers, that's not the case since 18 + 12 - 8 = 22 students play at least one sport, leaving 8 who don't.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's think about the maximum and minimum possible students who could play both sports.\n\nThe maximum number of students who can play both sports is the smaller of the two groups, which is 12 (since only 12 play basketball). The minimum is constrained by the total number of students.\n\nBut in this case, since 18 + 12 = 30, and the overlap is 8, which is within the possible range, our calculation holds.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who do not play either sport is 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
