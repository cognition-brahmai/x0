        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a company that makes $1,000,000 a year. That's their total revenue. Now, they spend some of that money on different things, like salaries, rent, and marketing. The question is asking for the profit at the end of the year. Profit is basically what's left after you subtract all the expenses from the revenue.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much they spend on each category. They spend 40% on salaries, 25% on rent, and 15% on marketing. Let's calculate each of these expenses based on the total revenue.\n\nStarting with salaries:\n\n40% of $1,000,000 is calculated as 0.40 \u00d7 $1,000,000 = $400,000.\n\nNext, rent:\n\n25% of $1,000,000 is 0.25 \u00d7 $1,000,000 = $250,000.\n\nAnd then, marketing:\n\n15% of $1,000,000 is 0.15 \u00d7 $1,000,000 = $150,000.\n\nNow, I need to add up all these expenses to find out the total amount spent.\n\nTotal expenses = salaries + rent + marketing = $400,000 + $250,000 + $150,000 = $800,000.\n\nFinally, to find the profit, I subtract the total expenses from the total revenue.\n\nProfit = revenue - total expenses = $1,000,000 - $800,000 = $200,000.\n\nSo, the company's profit at the end of the year is $200,000.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there are other expenses that aren't mentioned here. The problem only lists salaries, rent, and marketing as expenses, so assuming there are no other costs, this should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can look at the percentages to see if they add up to 100%. Salaries are 40%, rent is 25%, marketing is 15%. Adding those up: 40% + 25% + 15% = 80%. So, 80% of the revenue is spent on these expenses, which means that 20% is left as profit.\n\n20% of $1,000,000 is 0.20 \u00d7 $1,000,000 = $200,000, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the company's profit is $200,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200000} \\]"
