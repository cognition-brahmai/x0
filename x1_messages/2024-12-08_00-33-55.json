        "content": "A central concern of political science is the study of power, governance, and political ideologies. Therefore, the correct answer is C. The study of power, governance, and political ideologies.\n\nPolitical science is a social science that deals with the theory and practice of politics and the description and analysis of political systems and political behavior. It involves the study of governments, public policies, and political behavior, and it uses both humanistic and scientific perspectives and skills to understand political systems and political behavior.\n\nOption A, the biological basis of human behavior, is more related to fields like biology, psychology, or evolutionary psychology rather than political science. While political scientists might consider the impact of biological factors on political behavior, it is not their central concern.\n\nOption B, the cultural practices of different societies, is primarily the domain of anthropology and sociology. Although culture can influence politics and is sometimes studied by political scientists, it is not the central focus of the discipline.\n\nOption D, the economic principles underlying market systems, is the main concern of economics. While political science may intersect with economics, particularly in the study of public policy and political economy, economics is a separate social science with its own focus.\n\nTherefore, the core concern of political science is encapsulated in option C: the study of power, governance, and political ideologies."
