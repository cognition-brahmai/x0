        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 apples and 7 oranges in a basket, making a total of 12 fruits. I need to find the probability of picking 2 apples and 1 orange when I randomly select 3 fruits without looking.\n\nFirst, I should recall how to calculate probabilities in situations like this. Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to pick any 3 fruits out of the 12 available. And the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to pick 2 apples out of 5 and 1 orange out of 7.\n\nI think I need to use combinations here because the order in which I pick the fruits doesn't matter. Combinations are denoted by \"n choose k\" or C(n, k), which is equal to n! / (k!(n - k)!), where \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of ways to pick 3 fruits out of 12.\n\nTotal ways = C(12, 3) = 12! / (3! * (12 - 3)!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9!) / (3! \u00d7 9!)) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 1320 / 6 = 220.\n\nSo, there are 220 possible ways to pick any 3 fruits from the basket.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable ways, which is picking 2 apples and 1 orange.\n\nNumber of ways to pick 2 apples out of 5: C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!) = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3!) / (2! \u00d7 3!)) = (5 \u00d7 4) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 20 / 2 = 10.\n\nNumber of ways to pick 1 orange out of 7: C(7, 1) = 7! / (1! * (7 - 1)!) = (7 \u00d7 6!) / (1! \u00d7 6!)) = 7 / 1 = 7.\n\nNow, since these are independent events (picking apples and picking oranges), I need to multiply the number of ways to pick apples by the number of ways to pick oranges to get the total number of favorable outcomes.\n\nFavorable ways = C(5, 2) \u00d7 C(7, 1) = 10 \u00d7 7 = 70.\n\nTherefore, the probability is favorable ways divided by total ways:\n\nProbability = 70 / 220.\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 10:\n\n70 \u00f7 10 = 7\n\n220 \u00f7 10 = 22\n\nSo, probability = 7 / 22.\n\nWait, but I should check if this is the lowest terms. 7 and 22 have no common factors other than 1, so yes, it's 7/22.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal or percentage, but since the question didn't specify, I'll leave it as a fraction.\n\nSo, the probability of picking 2 apples and 1 orange is 7/22.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal ways: C(12, 3) = 220. That seems correct.\n\nFavorable ways: C(5, 2) = 10, C(7, 1) = 7, multiplied together give 70. That's correct.\n\nProbability: 70 / 220 = 7 / 22. Correct.\n\nYeah, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{22}} \\]"
