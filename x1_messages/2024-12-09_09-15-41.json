        "content": "Sure! Here's a JavaScript function that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion:\n\n```javascript\nfunction factorial(n) {\n  // Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1\n  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {\n    return 1;\n  }\n  // Recursive case: n * factorial of (n-1)\n  else {\n    return n * factorial(n - 1);\n  }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconsole.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120\n```\n\nIn this function, we have a base case that stops the recursion when `n` is either 0 or 1, as the factorial of both is 1. For any other positive integer, the function calls itself with `n-1` until it reaches the base case. This recursive approach effectively calculates the factorial by multiplying the number by the factorial of the number minus one, step by step."
