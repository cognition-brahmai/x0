        "content": "Let's see. There are 6 apples and 8 oranges in the basket, so in total, there are 6 + 8 = 14 fruits. If I take out 4 apples, then the number of apples left would be 6 - 4 = 2 apples. The number of oranges remains the same, which is 8. So, the total number of fruits left in the basket would be 2 apples + 8 oranges = 10 fruits.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check that. I started with 14 fruits and took out 4 apples, so 14 - 4 should indeed be 10 fruits left. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as there are 6 apples and 8 oranges, making 14 fruits. After taking out 4 apples, the apples left are 2, and the oranges are still 8, so total fruits left are 10.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can consider another approach. Let's see.\n\nSuppose I consider the fruits in the basket as two separate groups: apples and oranges. Initially, apples are 6 and oranges are 8. When I take out 4 apples, I'm only reducing the number of apples, not the oranges. So, the oranges stay the same at 8, and apples go down to 2. Therefore, the total fruits left are 2 + 8 = 10.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that I'm removing 4 apples from the basket, which affects only the apple count. The oranges are unaffected. So, the total fruits left would be the original number minus the 4 apples removed, which is 14 - 4 = 10.\n\nHmm, I'm getting the same answer with different approaches, which gives me more confidence that 10 is the correct number of fruits left in the basket.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. Maybe something about the fruits being taken out affecting the oranges in some way, but no, the problem says \"take out 4 apples,\" so only apples are being removed.\n\nAlso, just to make sure, perhaps there's a trick here that I'm missing. Like, maybe some apples are being replaced with oranges or something, but the problem doesn't say anything about that. It's a straightforward removal of 4 apples.\n\nSo, starting with 6 apples and 8 oranges, total 14 fruits. Remove 4 apples, leaving 2 apples and 8 oranges, totaling 10 fruits.\n\nI think that's the answer: 10 fruits are left in the basket.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
