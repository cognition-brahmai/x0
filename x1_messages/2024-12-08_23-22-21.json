        "content": "So, the car uses 8 gallons of gasoline to travel 240 miles, and I need to find out its fuel efficiency in miles per gallon, or mpg for short. Alright, fuel efficiency in mpg is basically how many miles the car can travel per gallon of gas. So, if it uses 8 gallons to go 240 miles, I need to figure out how many miles it can go on just one gallon.\n\nI think the way to do this is to divide the total miles by the gallons used. So, that would be 240 miles divided by 8 gallons. Let me do that calculation. 240 divided by 8 equals 30. So, the car's fuel efficiency is 30 mpg.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If the car uses 8 gallons to travel 240 miles, then per gallon, it should travel 30 miles. So, for 1 gallon, 30 miles; for 2 gallons, 60 miles; and so on, up to 8 gallons, which would be 240 miles. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see if the units make sense. Miles per gallon means miles divided by gallons. So, 240 miles divided by 8 gallons gives 30 miles per gallon. The units are correct, which is a good sign.\n\nI think I've got it right. The car's fuel efficiency is 30 mpg.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]\n"
