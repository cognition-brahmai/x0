Let's see how I can use them step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably search the web to find information about the highest peak in the Andes. I have the DuckDuckGo tool for searching the web. So, I'll use that to look for the highest peak in the Andes.\n\nPlan: Search for the highest peak in the Andes using DuckDuckGo.\n#E1 = DuckDuckGo[\"highest peak in the Andes\"]\n\nOnce I have the search results from DuckDuckGo, I need to look at the links provided to find the most relevant ones that can give me the information I need. I think the URLPicker tool can help me extract the URLs from the search results.\n\nPlan: Extract URLs from the DuckDuckGo search results.\n#E2 = URLPicker[#E1]\n\nNow, with the list of URLs, I need to visit these websites to read the content and find the answer to my question. The SiteReader tool can load the content from these URLs and give me the text.\n\nPlan: Read the content from the extracted URLs.\n#E3 = SiteReader[#E2]\n\nOnce I have the text content from these websites, I need to find the answer to my question: what is the highest peak in the Andes and its elevation. I can use the QAModel tool to ask a question based on the provided context.\n\nPlan: Ask the QAModel to find the highest peak in the Andes and its elevation, using the text from #E3 as context.\n#E4 = QAModel[\"What is the highest peak in the Andes and what is its elevation?\" Given context #E3]\n\nFinally, the answer should be in #E4.\n\nFinal Answer: #E4"
