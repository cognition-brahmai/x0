        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a simple chat server in Java using sockets that can handle multiple clients and broadcast messages to all connected clients. This is a classic network programming exercise, and it's a great way to understand how servers and clients communicate over networks.\n\n### Understanding the Requirements\n\n- **Server:** Accepts multiple clients.\n- **Broadcasting:** Messages from one client are sent to all other connected clients.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Server Setup:**\n   - Use a `ServerSocket` to listen for incoming client connections.\n   - Accept connections in a loop to handle multiple clients.\n   - For each connected client, start a new thread to handle communication.\n\n2. **Client Handling:**\n   - Each client connection is handled by a separate thread.\n   - Read messages from the client and broadcast them to all other clients.\n\n3. **Broadcast Mechanism:**\n   - Maintain a list of all connected clients.\n   - When a message is received from one client, send it to all other clients in the list.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class ChatServer {\n    private static final int PORT = 1234;\n    private static List<ClientHandler> clients = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(PORT);\n        System.out.println(\"Chat Server started on port \" + PORT);\n\n        while (true) {\n            Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();\n            ClientHandler client = new ClientHandler(socket);\n            clients.add(client);\n            new Thread(client).start();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void broadcastMessage(String message, ClientHandler excludeClient) {\n        for (ClientHandler client : clients) {\n            if (client != excludeClient) {\n                client.sendMessage(message);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    static class ClientHandler implements Runnable {\n        private Socket socket;\n        private BufferedReader in;\n        private PrintWriter out;\n\n        public ClientHandler(Socket socket) {\n            this.socket = socket;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void run() {\n            try {\n                in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\n                out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\n\n                String message;\n                while ((message = in.readLine()) != null) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Received: \" + message);\n                    broadcastMessage(message, this);\n                }\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            } finally {\n                try {\n                    socket.close();\n                } catch (IOException e) {\n                    e.printStackTrace();\n                }\n                clients.remove(this);\n            }\n        }\n\n        public void sendMessage(String message) {\n            out.println(message);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Server Setup:**\n   - The server listens on port `1234`.\n   - It accepts incoming client connections in a loop.\n\n2. **Client Handling:**\n   - For each client connection, a new `ClientHandler` thread is created.\n   - Each `ClientHandler` reads messages from its client and broadcasts them to all other clients.\n\n3. **Broadcast Mechanism:**\n   - The `broadcastMessage` method sends a message to all clients except the one from which the message originated.\n\n4. **ClientHandler Class:**\n   - Manages input and output streams for each client.\n   - Reads messages from the client and broadcasts them.\n   - Removes itself from the client list when the connection is closed.\n\nThis setup ensures that multiple clients can connect to the server, and any message sent by one client is received by all other connected clients. It's a basic chat server, and you can expand upon it by adding features like user authentication, private messaging, etc.\n\n### Testing the Server\n\nTo test the server, you can use any TCP client, such as `telnet` or `netcat`. Here\u2019s how you can use `telnet`:\n\n1. Start the server:\n   ```sh\n   java ChatServer\n   ```\n\n2. Open multiple terminal windows and connect to the server using `telnet`:\n   ```sh\n   telnet localhost 1234\n   ```\n\n3. Type messages in one `telnet` session and see them appear in the other sessions.\n\nThis should give you a basic understanding of how a multi-client chat server works using Java sockets."
