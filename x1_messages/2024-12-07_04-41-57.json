        "content": "I think the instrument you're referring to is the theremin. It was invented in the early 20th century by a Russian inventor named L\u00e9on Theremin. What's unique about the theremin is that it's one of the first electronic musical instruments, and it's played without any physical contact. The musician controls the pitch and volume by moving their hands in the air around two antennas. Because of its eerie, otherworldly sound, it's become closely associated with science fiction and horror film soundtracks. Some famous examples include the Beach Boys' \"Good Vibrations\" and the score for the movie \"Forbidden Planet.\""
