        "content": "Let's see. There are 40 students in the class, and 60% of them are boys. So, first I need to find out how many boys there are.\n\n60% of 40 is calculated as 0.6 times 40, which is 24. So, there are 24 boys in the class.\n\nNow, since the total number of students is 40, and there are 24 boys, the number of girls must be 40 minus 24, which is 16. So, there are 16 girls in the class.\n\nThe problem says that the number of girls increases by 50%. I need to find out what 50% of 16 is and then add that to the current number of girls.\n\n50% of 16 is 0.5 times 16, which is 8. So, if the number of girls increases by 50%, that means there are 8 more girls added to the class.\n\nTherefore, the new number of girls is 16 plus 8, which is 24.\n\nNow, to find the total number of students in the class after this increase, I need to add the number of boys and the new number of girls.\n\nThere are still 24 boys, and now there are 24 girls, so the total is 24 plus 24, which is 48.\n\nSo, the total number of students in the class will be 48.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nStarting with 40 students, 24 boys and 16 girls. Increasing the number of girls by 50% means adding 8 more girls, making it 24 girls. Adding those 8 girls to the original 40 students gives 48 students in total.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
