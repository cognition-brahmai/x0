        "content": "If a person consumes an average of 200 liters of water per day, to find out how much they consume in one year, we need to multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a year.\n\nFirst, we know that there are 365 days in a non-leap year. So, the calculation would be:\n\n200 liters/day \u00d7 365 days/year = 73,000 liters/year\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is a significant amount of water consumption per day, which seems unusually high for an individual's daily water usage. Typically, daily water usage per person varies depending on factors such as location, lifestyle, and water access, but it's generally much lower.\n\nFor example, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), an individual's daily water requirement for drinking is around 2 to 2.7 liters, depending on factors like age, sex, activity level, and climate. But this only accounts for drinking water, not total water usage, which includes water for cooking, washing, sanitation, etc.\n\nIn many countries, the average daily water usage per person can range from as low as 50 liters in some developing countries to over 300 liters in more developed nations. Therefore, a daily consumption of 200 liters per person is on the higher side but not impossible, especially in regions with higher standards of living and greater water access.\n\nMoreover, it's worth considering that water consumption can vary significantly based on personal habits, the efficiency of water appliances, and water conservation practices. For instance, taking shorter showers, fixing leaks promptly, and using water-efficient appliances can notably reduce water usage.\n\nIn summary, if a person consumes 200 liters of water per day, their annual consumption would be 73,000 liters. However, it's essential to consider the context and ensure sustainable water usage practices to conserve this vital resource."
