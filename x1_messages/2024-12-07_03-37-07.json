        "content": "Certainly! Below is a Python script that calculates the factorial of a given positive integer using iteration:\n\n```python\ndef factorial_iterative(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        return \"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\"\n    elif n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        factorial = 1\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            factorial *= i\n        return factorial\n\n# Example usage:\nnumber = int(input(\"Enter a positive integer: \"))\nresult = factorial_iterative(number)\nprint(f\"The factorial of {number} is {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `factorial_iterative(n)` is defined to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer `n`.\n2. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If `n` is negative, it returns a message indicating that factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n   - If `n` is 0, it returns 1 since 0! is defined as 1.\n3. **Iteration**:\n   - Initializes a variable `factorial` to 1.\n   - Uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and multiplies the current value of `factorial` by the loop variable `i`.\n4. **User Input and Output**:\n   - Asks the user to input a positive integer.\n   - Calls the `factorial_iterative` function with the user-provided number.\n   - Prints the result.\n\nThis script ensures that the factorial is calculated correctly for positive integers and handles edge cases appropriately."
