        "content": "So I've got this problem here about planning a new public transportation system for a city. The city wants to build bus, train, and tram stations, and also buy the respective vehicles, all within a $500 million budget. The goal is to maximize coverage while keeping an equal distribution between the three modes of transportation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"equal distribution\" means in this context. I think it means that the city wants to spend approximately the same amount on each mode of transportation. Since there are three modes, that would be about $500 million divided by 3, which is roughly $166.67 million per mode.\n\nBut wait, maybe \"equal distribution\" refers to the number of stations or vehicles, not necessarily the budget. The problem says \"equal distribution between the three modes,\" but it doesn't specify whether that's in terms of budget, stations, or vehicles. This could be ambiguous.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"determine the optimal number of stations and vehicles for each mode of transportation within the given budget, considering that the city wants to maximize coverage while maintaining an equal distribution between the three modes.\"\n\nI think \"equal distribution\" here likely refers to an equal number of stations for each mode, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it could mean an equal number of vehicles per mode, or perhaps an equal budget allocation.\n\nTo proceed, I'll make an assumption that \"equal distribution\" means an equal number of stations for each mode. That seems like a reasonable interpretation.\n\nSo, let's assume the city wants the same number of bus stations, train stations, and tram stations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of bus stations.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of train stations.\n\n- Let \\( z \\) be the number of tram stations.\n\nGiven the assumption of equal distribution in terms of stations, we have:\n\n\\( x = y = z \\)\n\nNow, we need to consider the costs associated with each station and the vehicles.\n\nThe cost to construct each type of station is:\n\n- Bus station: $2 million\n\n- Train station: $10 million\n\n- Tram station: $5 million\n\nAdditionally, the cost for vehicles is:\n\n- Bus: $300,000 per bus\n\n- Train: $2 million per train\n\n- Tram: $1 million per tram\n\nNow, we need to decide how many vehicles to purchase for each station. The problem doesn't specify how many vehicles per station, so we'll need to make another assumption here. Perhaps each station gets one vehicle, or maybe more.\n\nLet's consider that each station has at least one vehicle. That seems reasonable.\n\nSo, if there are \\( x \\) bus stations, we'll have \\( x \\) buses.\n\nSimilarly, \\( y \\) train stations would have \\( y \\) trains, and \\( z \\) tram stations would have \\( z \\) trams.\n\nGiven that \\( x = y = z \\), the total cost for stations and vehicles would be:\n\nTotal cost = (cost per bus station * x) + (cost per train station * y) + (cost per tram station * z) + (cost per bus * x) + (cost per train * y) + (cost per tram * z)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nTotal cost = (2,000,000 * x) + (10,000,000 * y) + (5,000,000 * z) + (300,000 * x) + (2,000,000 * y) + (1,000,000 * z)\n\nSince \\( x = y = z \\), let's denote \\( x = y = z = n \\)\n\nThen, total cost = (2,000,000 + 300,000) * n + (10,000,000 + 2,000,000) * n + (5,000,000 + 1,000,000) * n\n\nSimplify:\n\nTotal cost = (2,300,000 + 12,000,000 + 6,000,000) * n = 20,300,000 * n\n\nThe total budget is $500,000,000, so:\n\n20,300,000 * n \u2264 500,000,000\n\nSolving for n:\n\nn \u2264 500,000,000 / 20,300,000 \u2248 24.63\n\nSince n must be an integer, the maximum possible n is 24.\n\nSo, initially, it seems like the city can build 24 bus stations, 24 train stations, and 24 tram stations, each with one vehicle.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the city can maximize coverage by having more vehicles per station. The problem mentions \"maximizing coverage,\" which could mean serving more areas or having more frequent services. Having multiple vehicles per station could allow for more frequent services.\n\nLet's explore that possibility.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of buses per bus station.\n\n- Let \\( t \\) be the number of trains per train station.\n\n- Let \\( m \\) be the number of trams per tram station.\n\nThen, the total cost becomes:\n\nTotal cost = (2,000,000 * x) + (10,000,000 * y) + (5,000,000 * z) + (300,000 * b * x) + (2,000,000 * t * y) + (1,000,000 * m * z)\n\nGiven that \\( x = y = z = n \\), this simplifies to:\n\nTotal cost = (2,000,000 + 300,000 * b) * n + (10,000,000 + 2,000,000 * t) * n + (5,000,000 + 1,000,000 * m) * n\n\n= [2,000,000 + 300,000 b + 10,000,000 + 2,000,000 t + 5,000,000 + 1,000,000 m] * n\n\n= [17,000,000 + 300,000 b + 2,000,000 t + 1,000,000 m] * n\n\nThis needs to be less than or equal to $500,000,000.\n\nNow, to maximize coverage, we might want to maximize the total number of vehicles, which would be x*b + y*t + z*m = n*(b + t + m)\n\nBut we have to do this within the budget constraint.\n\nThis seems like an optimization problem where we need to maximize n*(b + t + m) subject to [17,000,000 + 300,000 b + 2,000,000 t + 1,000,000 m] * n \u2264 500,000,000.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the city should prioritize modes of transportation based on their cost-effectiveness in terms of coverage.\n\nFor example, buses are cheaper to purchase and station costs are lower compared to trains and trams. Maybe buses provide more coverage per dollar spent.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the cost per vehicle:\n\n- Bus: $300,000 per bus\n\n- Train: $2,000,000 per train\n\n- Tram: $1,000,000 per tram\n\nAlso, the station costs are:\n\n- Bus station: $2,000,000\n\n- Train station: $10,000,000\n\n- Tram station: $5,000,000\n\nIf we consider that each station requires at least one vehicle, then the total cost per station with one vehicle is:\n\n- Bus: $2,000,000 + $300,000 = $2,300,000\n\n- Train: $10,000,000 + $2,000,000 = $12,000,000\n\n- Tram: $5,000,000 + $1,000,000 = $6,000,000\n\nIn terms of cost per vehicle, buses are the cheapest, followed by trams, then trains.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that the city wants to maintain an equal distribution between the three modes, so we can't focus solely on the cheapest option.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the city should allocate the budget equally among the three modes, as I initially thought.\n\nLet's explore that.\n\nTotal budget: $500,000,000\n\nDivided equally among three modes: $500,000,000 / 3 \u2248 $166,666,666.67 per mode.\n\nNow, for each mode, we can calculate how many stations and vehicles can be purchased within that budget.\n\nStarting with buses:\n\nCost per bus station with one bus: $2,000,000 + $300,000 = $2,300,000\n\nSo, number of bus stations: $166,666,666.67 / $2,300,000 \u2248 72.46\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a station, the city can build 72 bus stations with one bus each.\n\nRemaining budget for buses: $166,666,666.67 - (72 * $2,300,000) = $166,666,666.67 - $165,600,000 = $1,066,666.67\n\nWith the remaining budget, the city can purchase additional buses.\n\nCost per bus: $300,000\n\nSo, additional buses: $1,066,666.67 / $300,000 \u2248 3.55\n\nThus, the city can purchase 3 additional buses.\n\nThese could be distributed among the 72 bus stations as needed.\n\nMoving on to trains:\n\nCost per train station with one train: $10,000,000 + $2,000,000 = $12,000,000\n\nNumber of train stations: $166,666,666.67 / $12,000,000 \u2248 13.89\n\nSo, the city can build 13 train stations with one train each.\n\nRemaining budget for trains: $166,666,666.67 - (13 * $12,000,000) = $166,666,666.67 - $156,000,000 = $10,666,666.67\n\nAdditional trains: $10,666,666.67 / $2,000,000 \u2248 5.33\n\nSo, the city can purchase 5 additional trains.\n\nThese can be distributed among the 13 train stations.\n\nNow, for trams:\n\nCost per tram station with one tram: $5,000,000 + $1,000,000 = $6,000,000\n\nNumber of tram stations: $166,666,666.67 / $6,000,000 \u2248 27.78\n\nThus, the city can build 27 tram stations with one tram each.\n\nRemaining budget for trams: $166,666,666.67 - (27 * $6,000,000) = $166,666,666.67 - $162,000,000 = $4,666,666.67\n\nAdditional trams: $4,666,666.67 / $1,000,000 = 4.67\n\nSo, the city can purchase 4 additional trams.\n\nThese can be distributed among the 27 tram stations.\n\nNow, summarizing:\n\n- Buses: 72 stations, 72 + 3 = 75 buses\n\n- Trains: 13 stations, 13 + 5 = 18 trains\n\n- Trams: 27 stations, 27 + 4 = 31 trams\n\nBut wait a minute, earlier I assumed equal budget allocation per mode, but the problem says \"equal distribution between the three modes.\" Maybe equal distribution refers to an equal number of stations per mode, not equal budget allocation.\n\nIf that's the case, then we need to find a number n such that the total cost for n bus stations, n train stations, and n tram stations, each with one vehicle, is within the $500 million budget.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, the total cost per station with one vehicle is:\n\n- Bus: $2,300,000\n\n- Train: $12,000,000\n\n- Tram: $6,000,000\n\nSo, total cost for n of each is:\n\nTotal cost = n * ($2,300,000 + $12,000,000 + $6,000,000) = n * $20,300,000\n\nSet this less than or equal to $500,000,000:\n\nn * $20,300,000 \u2264 $500,000,000\n\nn \u2264 $500,000,000 / $20,300,000 \u2248 24.63\n\nSo, n = 24\n\nThus, the city can build 24 bus stations, 24 train stations, and 24 tram stations, each with one vehicle.\n\nNow, with n = 24:\n\n- Bus stations: 24\n\n- Buses: 24\n\n- Train stations: 24\n\n- Trains: 24\n\n- Tram stations: 24\n\n- Trams: 24\n\nBut is this the optimal in terms of maximizing coverage?\n\nPerhaps not, because buses are cheaper, so allocating more budget to buses could allow for more vehicles and thus more coverage.\n\nBut the problem specifies maintaining an equal distribution between the three modes.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the approach of equal number of stations per mode is acceptable.\n\nHowever, to maximize coverage, maybe the city should have more stations of the cheaper modes and fewer of the expensive ones, but that contradicts the equal distribution requirement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the city can have equal number of stations per mode but allocate remaining budget to purchase additional vehicles for all modes.\n\nLet\u2019s explore that.\n\nWith n = 24:\n\nTotal cost = 24 * $20,300,000 = $487,200,000\n\nRemaining budget: $500,000,000 - $487,200,000 = $12,800,000\n\nNow, with this remaining budget, the city can purchase additional vehicles.\n\nThe cost per additional vehicle is:\n\n- Bus: $300,000\n\n- Train: $2,000,000\n\n- Tram: $1,000,000\n\nTo maximize coverage, it's likely best to purchase as many additional buses as possible, since they are the cheapest and can serve more areas.\n\nNumber of additional buses: $12,800,000 / $300,000 \u2248 42.67\n\nSo, the city can purchase 42 additional buses.\n\nThus, total buses: 24 (initial) + 42 = 66 buses\n\nTotal train stations: 24\n\nTotal trains: 24\n\nTotal tram stations: 24\n\nTotal trams: 24\n\nThis seems like a better distribution, as it maximizes the number of vehicles while maintaining an equal number of stations per mode.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to allocate the remaining budget.\n\nAlternatively, the city could allocate the remaining budget to purchase additional vehicles for all modes, proportional to their costs.\n\nHowever, given that buses are the cheapest, focusing on them would allow for more vehicles and thus potentially greater coverage.\n\nBut the problem specifies maintaining an equal distribution between the three modes.\n\nThis is a bit tricky.\n\nAnother approach could be to allocate the budget in a way that the total number of vehicles is maximized, while keeping the number of stations per mode equal.\n\nGiven that, perhaps we can set up an optimization problem.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- x = number of bus stations\n\n- y = number of train stations\n\n- z = number of tram stations\n\nWith the constraint that x = y = z = n\n\nLet\u2019s also define:\n\n- b = number of buses per bus station\n\n- t = number of trains per train station\n\n- m = number of trams per tram station\n\nThe total cost is:\n\nTotal cost = n * (2,000,000 + 300,000 b) + n * (10,000,000 + 2,000,000 t) + n * (5,000,000 + 1,000,000 m)\n\nSubject to total cost \u2264 $500,000,000\n\nThe objective is to maximize the total number of vehicles, which is n*b + n*t + n*m = n*(b + t + m)\n\nThis is a linear programming problem.\n\nTo solve this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or other optimization techniques, but that might be too complex for this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can assume that each station has at least one vehicle and allocate the remaining budget to purchase additional vehicles.\n\nAs I did earlier, with n = 24 stations per mode, total cost is $487.2 million, leaving $12.8 million for additional vehicles.\n\nGiven that, purchasing additional buses is the most cost-effective way to maximize the total number of vehicles.\n\nTherefore, purchasing 42 additional buses brings the total number of buses to 66, while keeping 24 train stations with one train each and 24 tram stations with one tram each.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the city could allocate the remaining budget to purchase additional vehicles for all modes, but given the costs, buses are the most efficient in terms of number of vehicles per dollar.\n\nTherefore, to maximize coverage, focusing on buses makes sense.\n\nHowever, the problem mentions \"maintaining an equal distribution between the three modes.\"\n\nThis could be interpreted in different ways:\n\n1. Equal number of stations per mode.\n\n2. Equal number of vehicles per mode.\n\n3. Equal budget allocation per mode.\n\nWe've already explored the first option.\n\nLet's consider the second option: equal number of vehicles per mode.\n\nIn this case, let\u2019s denote:\n\n- b = number of buses\n\n- t = number of trains\n\n- m = number of trams\n\nWith b = t = m = k\n\nNow, each bus station has one bus, each train station has one train, and each tram station has one tram.\n\nSo, the number of stations per mode would be equal to the number of vehicles per mode.\n\nTherefore, x = b, y = t, z = m, and x = y = z = k\n\nThen, the total cost is:\n\nTotal cost = k * (2,000,000 + 300,000) + k * (10,000,000 + 2,000,000) + k * (5,000,000 + 1,000,000) = k * (2,300,000 + 12,000,000 + 6,000,000) = k * 20,300,000\n\nSet this less than or equal to $500,000,000:\n\nk * 20,300,000 \u2264 500,000,000\n\nk \u2264 500,000,000 / 20,300,000 \u2248 24.63\n\nSo, k = 24\n\nThus, the city can have 24 buses, 24 trains, and 24 trams, each with their respective stations.\n\nRemaining budget: $500,000,000 - (24 * 20,300,000) = $500,000,000 - $487,200,000 = $12,800,000\n\nNow, with this remaining budget, the city can purchase additional vehicles.\n\nSince the goal is to maintain an equal number of vehicles per mode, the city needs to spend the remaining budget in a way that allows purchasing the same number of additional vehicles for each mode.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of additional vehicles per mode as m.\n\nThen, the cost for additional vehicles is:\n\nm * 300,000 (for buses) + m * 2,000,000 (for trains) + m * 1,000,000 (for trams) = m * (300,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,000,000) = m * 3,300,000\n\nSet this less than or equal to $12,800,000:\n\nm * 3,300,000 \u2264 12,800,000\n\nm \u2264 12,800,000 / 3,300,000 \u2248 3.88\n\nSo, m = 3\n\nTherefore, the city can purchase 3 additional buses, 3 additional trains, and 3 additional trams.\n\nThus, total vehicles per mode:\n\n- Buses: 24 + 3 = 27\n\n- Trains: 24 + 3 = 27\n\n- Trams: 24 + 3 = 27\n\nThis maintains the equal distribution in terms of the number of vehicles per mode.\n\nHowever, this seems suboptimal in terms of maximizing coverage because buses are cheaper, and more buses could be purchased with the remaining budget.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the city could consider having more stations for buses and fewer for trains, but that would contradict the equal distribution requirement.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in what \"equal distribution\" means, both approaches are possible.\n\nAnother way to interpret \"equal distribution\" is equal budget allocation per mode.\n\nIn that case, as I did earlier, allocating approximately $166.67 million to each mode.\n\nThen, for buses:\n\nCost per station with one bus: $2,300,000\n\nNumber of bus stations: $166,666,666.67 / $2,300,000 \u2248 72.46\n\nSo, 72 stations with one bus each.\n\nRemaining budget: $166,666,666.67 - (72 * $2,300,000) = $1,066,666.67\n\nAdditional buses: $1,066,666.67 / $300,000 \u2248 3.55, so 3 additional buses.\n\nTotal buses: 72 + 3 = 75\n\nSimilarly, for trains:\n\nCost per station with one train: $12,000,000\n\nNumber of train stations: $166,666,666.67 / $12,000,000 \u2248 13.89\n\nSo, 13 stations with one train each.\n\nRemaining budget: $166,666,666.67 - (13 * $12,000,000) = $10,666,666.67\n\nAdditional trains: $10,666,666.67 / $2,000,000 \u2248 5.33, so 5 additional trains.\n\nTotal trains: 13 + 5 = 18\n\nFor trams:\n\nCost per station with one tram: $6,000,000\n\nNumber of tram stations: $166,666,666.67 / $6,000,000 \u2248 27.78\n\nSo, 27 stations with one tram each.\n\nRemaining budget: $166,666,666.67 - (27 * $6,000,000) = $4,666,666.67\n\nAdditional trams: $4,666,666.67 / $1,000,000 = 4.67, so 4 additional trams.\n\nTotal trams: 27 + 4 = 31\n\nThis seems like a better distribution in terms of maximizing the number of vehicles, but it doesn't maintain an equal number of stations or vehicles per mode, which might contradict the \"equal distribution\" requirement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the city should aim for an equal number of stations per mode, but allocate the remaining budget to purchase additional vehicles for all modes.\n\nAs I did earlier, with n = 24 stations per mode, total cost $487.2 million, leaving $12.8 million for additional vehicles.\n\nThen, purchase additional vehicles in a way that maintains an equal number of vehicles per mode.\n\nAs calculated, m = 3 additional vehicles per mode.\n\nThus, total vehicles:\n\n- Buses: 24 + 3 = 27\n\n- Trains: 24 + 3 = 27\n\n- Trams: 24 + 3 = 27\n\nBut, compared to the equal budget allocation approach, where we had 75 buses, 18 trains, and 31 trams, this seems less optimal in terms of total vehicles.\n\nHowever, the equal budget allocation doesn't strictly maintain \"equal distribution between the three modes,\" as the number of stations and vehicles per mode differs.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to have an equal number of stations per mode, and use the remaining budget to purchase additional vehicles for all modes, maintaining an equal number of vehicles per mode.\n\nThis way, the distribution remains equal in terms of both stations and vehicles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to maximize coverage while keeping the number of stations equal.\n\nTo maximize coverage, the city might want to have as many vehicles as possible, especially cheaper ones like buses.\n\nHowever, the equal distribution requirement complicates this.\n\nMaybe the city can have more vehicles per station for buses, while having fewer for trains and trams.\n\nFor example, with n = 24 stations per mode:\n\n- Bus stations: 24, each with multiple buses\n\n- Train stations: 24, each with one train\n\n- Tram stations: 24, each with one tram\n\nThen, allocate the remaining budget to purchase additional buses.\n\nBut this might not maintain an equal distribution in terms of vehicles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the city can have 24 stations per mode, with multiple vehicles per station for buses, and one per station for trains and trams.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the cost for 24 stations per mode with one vehicle each:\n\nTotal cost: 24 * ($2,300,000 + $12,000,000 + $6,000,000) = 24 * $20,300,000 = $487,200,000\n\nRemaining budget: $500,000,000 - $487,200,000 = $12,800,000\n\nNow, if the city wants to maximize coverage, it should spend this remaining budget on the mode that provides the most additional coverage per dollar, which are buses.\n\nSo, purchasing additional buses: $12,800,000 / $300,000 \u2248 42.67, so 42 additional buses.\n\nThus, total buses: 24 (initial) + 42 = 66 buses\n\nTotal trains: 24\n\nTotal trams: 24\n\nThis way, the city has an equal number of stations per mode but more buses to maximize coverage.\n\nHowever, this doesn't maintain an equal number of vehicles per mode, which might not satisfy the \"equal distribution\" requirement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the city can have 24 stations per mode, with multiple vehicles per station for buses, and one per station for trains and trams.\n\nFor example, have 24 bus stations, each with 3 buses; 24 train stations, each with 1 train; and 24 tram stations, each with 1 tram.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the total cost for this scenario.\n\nCost for bus stations:\n\n24 * $2,000,000 (stations) + 24 * 3 * $300,000 (buses) = 24 * $2,000,000 + 72 * $300,000 = $48,000,000 + $21,600,000 = $69,600,000\n\nCost for train stations:\n\n24 * $10,000,000 (stations) + 24 * 1 * $2,000,000 (trains) = 24 * $10,000,000 + 24 * $2,000,000 = $240,000,000 + $48,000,000 = $288,000,000\n\nCost for tram stations:\n\n24 * $5,000,000 (stations) + 24 * 1 * $1,000,000 (trams) = 24 * $5,000,000 + 24 * $1,000,000 = $120,000,000 + $24,000,000 = $144,000,000\n\nTotal cost: $69,600,000 + $288,000,000 + $144,000,000 = $499,600,000, which is within the $500 million budget.\n\nIn this scenario, the city has:\n\n- 24 bus stations, each with 3 buses: total 72 buses\n\n- 24 train stations, each with 1 train: total 24 trains\n\n- 24 tram stations, each with 1 tram: total 24 trams\n\nThis maintains an equal number of stations per mode and has an equal number of vehicles for buses, trains, and trams, although the number of buses per station is higher.\n\nThis seems like a balanced approach that satisfies the equal distribution requirement while maximizing coverage through more buses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the city can have 24 stations per mode, with 2 buses per bus station, 1 train per train station, and 1 tram per tram station.\n\nTotal cost:\n\nBus stations: 24 * $2,000,000 + 24 * 2 * $300,000 = $48,000,000 + $14,400,000 = $62,400,000\n\nTrain stations: 24 * $10,000,000 + 24 * 1 * $2,000,000 = $240,000,000 + $48,000,000 = $288,000,000\n\nTram stations: 24 * $5,000,000 + 24 * 1 * $1,000,000 = $120,000,000 + $24,000,000 = $144,000,000\n\nTotal cost: $62,400,000 + $288,000,000 + $144,000,000 = $494,400,000\n\nRemaining budget: $500,000,000 - $494,400,000 = $5,600,000\n\nWith this remaining budget, the city can purchase additional buses: $5,600,000 / $300,000 \u2248 18.67, so 18 additional buses.\n\nThus, total buses: (24 * 2) + 18 = 48 + 18 = 66 buses\n\nTotal trains: 24\n\nTotal trams: 24\n\nThis is similar to the earlier scenario but with fewer buses per station initially.\n\nComparing the two scenarios:\n\n1. 24 bus stations with 3 buses each: 72 buses, 24 train stations with 1 train each: 24 trains, 24 tram stations with 1 tram each: 24 trams\n\nTotal cost: $499,600,000\n\n2. 24 bus stations with 2 buses each: 48 buses, plus 18 additional buses: total 66 buses; 24 train stations with 1 train each: 24 trains; 24 tram stations with 1 tram each: 24 trams\n\nTotal cost: $494,400,000 + $5,600,000 = $500,000,000\n\nIn both scenarios, the city has 24 stations per mode, with more buses to maximize coverage.\n\nHowever, in the first scenario, all additional budget is spent on buses, while in the second scenario, some budget is allocated to having two buses per bus station initially.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the first scenario is better because it results in more buses (72 vs. 66), although it's slightly under the budget.\n\nAlternatively, the city could adjust the number of buses per bus station to better utilize the budget.\n\nFor example, have 24 bus stations with 2 buses each: 48 buses\n\nCost: 24 * $2,000,000 + 48 * $300,000 = $48,000,000 + $14,400,000 = $62,400,000\n\nTrain stations: 24 * $10,000,000 + 24 * $2,000,000 = $240,000,000 + $48,000,000 = $288,000,000\n\nTram stations: 24 * $5,000,000 + 24 * $1,000,000 = $120,000,000 + $24,000,000 = $144,000,000\n\nTotal cost: $62,400,000 + $288,000,000 + $144,000,000 = $494,400,000\n\nRemaining budget: $500,000,000 - $494,400,000 = $5,600,000\n\nWith this, purchase additional buses: $5,600,000 / $300,000 \u2248 18.67, so 18 additional buses.\n\nTotal buses: 48 + 18 = 66\n\nAlternatively, perhaps allocate some of the remaining budget to purchase additional trains or trams, but given their higher costs, fewer additional vehicles can be purchased.\n\nFor example, with $5,600,000:\n\n- Additional buses: 18 buses at $300,000 each\n\n- Additional trains: 2 trains at $2,000,000 each, with $1,600,000 remaining\n\n- Additional trams: 5 trams at $1,000,000 each, with $600,000 remaining\n\nGiven that buses are the cheapest and provide the most coverage per dollar, it's still better to prioritize additional buses.\n\nTherefore, the optimal approach seems to be:\n\n- Build 24 bus stations, each with 2 buses: 48 buses\n\n- Build 24 train stations, each with 1 train: 24 trains\n\n- Build 24 tram stations, each with 1 tram: 24 trams\n\n- Use the remaining $5,600,000 to purchase 18 additional buses\n\nTotal buses: 48 + 18 = 66\n\nTotal trains: 24\n\nTotal trams: 24\n\nThis maintains an equal number of stations per mode while maximizing the number of buses, which should provide greater coverage due to their lower cost and higher numbers.\n\nAlternatively, if the city wants to have more vehicles per station, they could have 24 bus stations with 3 buses each: 72 buses, and use the remaining budget for additional buses or other vehicles.\n\nBut given the earlier calculation, with 24 bus stations and 3 buses each, total cost is $69,600,000, and similar for trains and trams, totaling $499,600,000, leaving $400,000, which isn't enough for another bus.\n\nThus, in that case, total buses would be 72, trains 24, trams 24.\n\nComparing the two options:\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Bus stations: 24, buses: 66\n\n- Train stations: 24, trains: 24\n\n- Tram stations: 24, trams: 24\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Bus stations: 24, buses: 72\n\n- Train stations: 24, trains: 24\n\n- Tram stations: 24, trams: 24\n\nOption 2 has more buses but uses the entire budget, while in Option 1, there is some remaining budget that can be used for other purposes or perhaps future expansions.\n\nGiven that, Option 1 might be more practical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the city can have 24 bus stations with 2 buses each: 48 buses, and use the remaining budget to purchase additional buses and perhaps some trams or trains.\n\nFor example, with $5,600,000 remaining:\n\n- Purchase 18 buses: $5,400,000\n\n- Remaining: $200,000\n\nThis would bring total buses to 66, trains to 24, trams to 24.\n\nAlternatively, purchase 17 buses: $5,100,000, and use the remaining $500,000 to purchase part of another vehicle, but since trams cost $1,000,000 each, it's not feasible.\n\nTherefore, the city can have 66 buses, 24 trains, and 24 trams, with 24 stations each for buses, trains, and trams.\n\nThis seems like a balanced approach that maintains an equal number of stations per mode while maximizing coverage through a higher number of buses.\n\nAnother consideration is the operational costs of each vehicle. Trains and trams might have lower operational costs per passenger than buses, so even if they are more expensive to purchase, they might be more cost-effective in the long run.\n\nHowever, the problem focuses on the initial construction and purchase costs, not operational costs.\n\nAdditionally, factors like maintenance costs, passenger capacity, and environmental impact should be considered, but again, these are not part of the problem's scope.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided, the optimal number of stations and vehicles for each mode of transportation within the $500 million budget, while maintaining an equal distribution between the three modes and maximizing coverage, appears to be:\n\n- 24 bus stations with 2 buses each: total 48 buses, plus 18 additional buses: total 66 buses\n\n- 24 train stations with 1 train each: total 24 trains\n\n- 24 tram stations with 1 tram each: total 24 trams\n\nThis distribution allows for a significant number of buses to maximize coverage, while still maintaining an equal number of stations for each mode of transportation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24 \\text{ bus stations with 2 buses each (total 48 buses) plus 18 additional buses; 24 train stations with 1 train each; 24 tram stations with 1 tram each}} \\]"
