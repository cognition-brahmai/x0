First, I need to calculate the exponent, then do the subtraction inside the parentheses, then multiplication, and finally division.\n\nSo, starting with the exponent: 4^2 is 16. Now the expression is (16 - 3) * 2 / (8 - 3).\n\nNext, subtraction inside the parentheses: 16 - 3 is 13, and 8 - 3 is 5. So now it's 13 * 2 / 5.\n\nNow, multiplication and division from left to right. 13 * 2 is 26, so it's 26 / 5.\n\nFinally, 26 divided by 5 is 5.2.\n\nSo, the answer is 5.2."
