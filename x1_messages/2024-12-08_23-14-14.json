        "content": "So the restaurant has 12 tables, and each table has 4 chairs. They want to increase their seating capacity by 50%. I need to figure out how many additional chairs they would need for that.\n\nFirst, I should understand what their current seating capacity is. Since there are 12 tables and each has 4 chairs, the total number of chairs, which represents the seating capacity, is 12 times 4. So, 12 times 4 is 48 chairs. That means they currently have space for 48 people.\n\nNow, they want to increase this capacity by 50%. To find out what 50% of 48 is, I can calculate half of 48. Half of 48 is 24. So, they want to add enough chairs to seat an additional 24 people.\n\nTherefore, they would need 24 additional chairs to increase their seating capacity by 50%.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If they want to increase their seating capacity by 50%, their new seating capacity should be 150% of their current capacity.\n\nSo, 150% of 48 chairs would be 1.5 times 48, which is 72 chairs.\n\nThat means, from their current 48 chairs, they need to reach 72 chairs. So, 72 minus 48 is indeed 24 additional chairs.\n\nAlright, that seems consistent.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider if the additional chairs need to be arranged in complete tables or if they can just add chairs wherever there's space.\n\nThe problem says \"each with 4 chairs,\" so it seems like they have tables set up with 4 chairs each. If they want to maintain that configuration, then adding chairs might involve adding entire tables.\n\nSo, if they need 24 additional chairs and each table has 4 chairs, then they would need 24 divided by 4, which is 6 additional tables.\n\nEach additional table comes with 4 chairs, but since they only need 24 chairs, and 6 tables provide exactly 24 chairs, that works out.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the number of additional chairs needed, not tables. So, the answer should be 24 additional chairs.\n\nHowever, if they have to add tables with 4 chairs each, and they need 24 more chairs, then they have to add 6 tables to get those 24 chairs.\n\nBut again, the question is about the number of additional chairs, not tables, so 24 chairs is the answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if all the chairs are currently in use or if there are any empty chairs. But the problem doesn't specify that, so I'll assume that all chairs are part of the seating capacity, regardless of whether they're currently being used or not.\n\nAlso, perhaps I should think about space constraints. Is there enough space to add 6 more tables? But again, the problem doesn't provide that information, so I'll assume that's not a issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some chairs are shared between tables, but the problem says each table has 4 chairs, so I think it's safe to assume that each table has its own 4 chairs.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the restaurant would need 24 additional chairs to increase their seating capacity by 50%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
