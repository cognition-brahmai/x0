        "content": "Let's see. So, the train is going at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour and it takes 4 hours to reach its destination. First, I need to find out what the distance is. Distance is speed multiplied by time, right? So, 60 miles per hour times 4 hours would be 240 miles.\n\nNow, the question is asking how long it would take for the same train to travel twice the distance at half the speed. Twice the distance would be 2 times 240 miles, which is 480 miles. And half the speed would be half of 60 miles per hour, which is 30 miles per hour.\n\nSo, I need to find out the time it takes to travel 480 miles at 30 miles per hour. Time is distance divided by speed, right? So, 480 miles divided by 30 miles per hour should give me the time.\n\nLet me do the calculation: 480 divided by 30. That's the same as 480 divided by 30. Let's see, 30 times 16 is 480. So, the time would be 16 hours.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. Original trip: 60 mph for 4 hours, distance 240 miles. New trip: 480 miles at 30 mph.\n\nTime = distance / speed = 480 / 30 = 16 hours. Yep, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
