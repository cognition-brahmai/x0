Here's a simple JavaScript function that calculates the sum of all numbers in an array:\n\n```javascript\nfunction sumArray(numbers) {\n    let sum = 0;\n    for (let number of numbers) {\n        sum += number;\n    }\n    return sum;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconsole.log(sumArray(numbers));  // Output: 15\n```\n\nThis function takes an array of numbers as input and iterates through each element, adding them up to a variable `sum`, which is then returned."
