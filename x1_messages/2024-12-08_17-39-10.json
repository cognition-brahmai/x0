        "content": "The term \"meme\" was coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book \"The Selfish Gene.\" Dawkins introduced the concept to describe how ideas and cultural phenomena can spread and evolve through a population in a way analogous to the spread of genes in biological evolution. The term is derived from the Greek word \"mimema,\" meaning \"something imitated.\" Over time, the meaning of \"meme\" has evolved, and it is now commonly used to refer to humorous images, videos, or texts that are shared and often modified by Internet users."
