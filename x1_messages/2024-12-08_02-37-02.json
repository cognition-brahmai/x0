The average speed is defined as the total distance divided by the total time.\n\nLet's denote the distance between point A and point B as \\( d \\) miles.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time taken to travel from point A to point B at 60 miles per hour:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time from A to B} = \\frac{d}{60} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the time taken to return from point B to A at 40 miles per hour:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time from B to A} = \\frac{d}{40} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThe total distance for the round trip is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = d + d = 2d \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThe total time for the round trip is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{d}{40} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 40 is 120:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{60} = \\frac{2d}{120}, \\quad \\frac{d}{40} = \\frac{3d}{120}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\frac{2d}{120} + \\frac{3d}{120} = \\frac{5d}{120} = \\frac{d}{24} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the average speed:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}} = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{24}} = 2d \\times \\frac{24}{d} = 48 \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average speed for the entire round trip is 48 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
