        "content": "So there are 100 light bulbs all turned off in a row. Every minute, someone flips the switch on every second bulb, then every third, then every fourth, and so on, up to every 100th bulb. We need to find out how many are left on after this process.\n\nHmm, let's see. Each bulb starts off. Then, for each pass, starting with every second bulb, then every third, and so on, the switch is flipped. So, for each bulb, we need to figure out how many times its switch is flipped.\n\nLet's think about bulb number k. On pass n, if n divides k, then the switch is flipped. So, the number of times the switch is flipped for bulb k is equal to the number of divisors of k.\n\nNow, if the switch is flipped an even number of times, it will end up off, because it started off. If it's flipped an odd number of times, it will end up on.\n\nSo, the question reduces to finding how many bulbs have an odd number of divisors.\n\nI recall that most numbers have an even number of divisors, but perfect squares have an odd number of divisors. Because for non-square numbers, divisors come in pairs, like 1 and n, 2 and n/2, etc. But for squares, one of the divisors is repeated, so the total is odd.\n\nTherefore, only the bulbs at positions that are perfect squares will be left on.\n\nSo, we need to find how many perfect squares are there between 1 and 100.\n\nWell, 1^2 = 1, 2^2 = 4, 3^2 = 9, ..., 10^2 = 100. So, there are 10 perfect squares between 1 and 100.\n\nTherefore, 10 bulbs will be left on.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. If bulb 1 is flipped only once, it should be on. Bulb 2 is flipped twice: on pass 1 and pass 2, so it's off. Bulb 3 is flipped twice: pass 1 and pass 3, so off. Bulb 4 is flipped three times: pass 1, 2, and 4, so it's on. And so on.\n\nYes, this matches the perfect square pattern.\n\nSo, the answer should be 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
