        "content": "So I have this problem about a rectangular garden. The length is 30 meters and the width is 20 meters. I need to find out two things: first, the area of the garden in square meters, and second, how much fencing is needed to enclose it completely.\n\nOkay, let's start with the area. I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, if the length is 30 meters and the width is 20 meters, the area should be 30 meters times 20 meters. Let me do the multiplication: 30 times 20 is 600. So, the area is 600 square meters.\n\nNow, for the fencing, I need to find out the perimeter of the rectangle because the perimeter is the total length around the garden. I recall that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides, or more specifically, by the formula: perimeter equals 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. So, perimeter equals 2 times 30 meters plus 2 times 20 meters. Let me calculate that: 2 times 30 is 60 meters, and 2 times 20 is 40 meters. Adding those together, 60 plus 40 equals 100 meters. So, you would need 100 meters of fencing to enclose the garden completely.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about the perimeter? I think I've heard somewhere that for a rectangle, you can also calculate the perimeter by adding the length and width and then multiplying by 2. Let me try that to double-check. So, length plus width is 30 meters plus 20 meters, which is 50 meters. Then, multiply by 2: 50 times 2 is 100 meters. Yep, that matches my earlier calculation. So, definitely, 100 meters of fencing is needed.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should make sure that I've used the correct units throughout. The measurements given are in meters, and since area is in square meters, and perimeter is in meters, I think I've got that right.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there's any other factor that might affect the amount of fencing needed, like gates or corners, but the problem doesn't specify anything beyond just enclosing the garden completely. So, I think assuming a standard rectangular fence is fine.\n\nAlright, so to summarize: the area of the garden is 600 square meters, and the amount of fencing needed is 100 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe area of the garden is \\(\\boxed{600}\\) square meters, and the amount of fencing needed is \\(\\boxed{100}\\) meters."
