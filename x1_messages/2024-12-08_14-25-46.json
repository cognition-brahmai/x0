        "content": "Let's see. The train goes from Town A to Town B, which is 120 miles, and then from Town B to Town C, which is 150 miles. So, the total distance from Town A to Town C is the sum of these two distances. That would be 120 miles plus 150 miles, which equals 270 miles.\n\nNow, the train travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes to travel 270 miles at that speed, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nTime = 270 miles / 60 miles per hour\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\nTime = 4.5 hours\n\nSo, it takes the train 4.5 hours to travel from Town A to Town C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. The train travels from A to B at 60 mph, which is 120 miles, so that would take:\n\nTime from A to B = 120 miles / 60 mph = 2 hours\n\nThen, from B to C, 150 miles at 60 mph:\n\nTime from B to C = 150 miles / 60 mph = 2.5 hours\n\nAdding those times together: 2 hours + 2.5 hours = 4.5 hours\n\nYeah, that matches my first calculation. So, the total time is indeed 4.5 hours.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, perhaps there's something I'm missing. Is there any other factor that could affect the travel time, like stops or speed changes? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I think it's safe to assume constant speed and no stops.\n\nSo, the final answer is 4.5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
