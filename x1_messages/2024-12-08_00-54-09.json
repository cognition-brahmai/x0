The company needs to determine the required capacity for water storage tanks, taking into account the average daily water consumption per person (150 liters), the average number of residents per unit (3 people), and the need for a 3-day emergency reserve. Calculate the total water storage capacity needed for the entire complex and provide step-by-step reasoning."

        "content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about figuring out how much water to store for a new residential complex. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are 10 apartment buildings, and each building has 50 units. So, the total number of units in the complex is:\n\n10 buildings * 50 units/building = 500 units\n\nNext, it says the average number of residents per unit is 3 people. So, the total number of residents in the entire complex would be:\n\n500 units * 3 residents/unit = 1500 residents\n\nNow, the average daily water consumption per person is 150 liters. Therefore, the total daily water consumption for all residents is:\n\n1500 residents * 150 liters/resident/day = 225,000 liters/day\n\nBut, we need to account for a 3-day emergency reserve. That means we need to store enough water for 3 days in addition to the regular daily consumption. So, the total water storage capacity required would be:\n\n225,000 liters/day * 3 days = 675,000 liters\n\nWait a minute, but actually, if we're already calculating the daily consumption for all residents, and we need a 3-day reserve, then the total storage should just be the daily consumption multiplied by 3 days. I don't think we need to add anything else here, as the reserve is beyond the regular consumption.\n\nSo, total water storage capacity needed = 675,000 liters\n\nBut, sometimes, reserves are calculated based on the maximum demand or other factors, but according to the problem, it's a 3-day emergency reserve of average daily consumption.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check the units:\n\n- Units: 10 buildings * 50 units/building = 500 units\n\n- Residents: 500 units * 3 residents/unit = 1500 residents\n\n- Daily consumption: 1500 residents * 150 liters/resident/day = 225,000 liters/day\n\n- Reserve: 225,000 liters/day * 3 days = 675,000 liters\n\nEverything seems to add up correctly.\n\nI think that's the answer: the total water storage capacity needed for the entire complex is 675,000 liters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{675000 \\text{ liters}} \\]"
