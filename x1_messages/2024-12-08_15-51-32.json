        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a company's revenue. The revenue function is given by R(x) = 100x - x^2, where x is the number of units sold. I need to find the maximum revenue and figure out how many units need to be sold to achieve that.\n\nFirst off, I know that revenue is typically calculated as the price per unit times the number of units sold. Here, it's given by this quadratic function: R(x) = 100x - x^2. Looking at this, it's a downward-opening parabola because the coefficient of x^2 is negative. That means it has a maximum point, which is what I'm looking for.\n\nI recall that for a quadratic function in the form R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, the vertex represents the maximum or minimum point. Since a is negative here, it's a maximum. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula x = -b/(2a).\n\nIn this case, R(x) = -x^2 + 100x. So, a = -1, b = 100, and c = 0 (though c doesn't affect the vertex location). Plugging into the formula, x = -100/(2*(-1)) = -100/-2 = 50.\n\nSo, the number of units that need to be sold to achieve maximum revenue is 50.\n\nNow, to find the maximum revenue, I plug x = 50 back into the revenue function: R(50) = 100*(50) - (50)^2 = 5000 - 2500 = 2500.\n\nTherefore, the maximum revenue is 2500, achieved by selling 50 units.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nI remember that another way to find the maximum of a function is to take its derivative and set it to zero. That might be a good way to verify my answer.\n\nSo, the derivative of R(x) with respect to x is R'(x) = 100 - 2x.\n\nSetting that equal to zero: 100 - 2x = 0 => 2x = 100 => x = 50.\n\nThat matches what I found earlier using the vertex formula.\n\nTo ensure this is a maximum, I can check the second derivative: R''(x) = -2, which is negative, confirming that it's indeed a maximum.\n\nSo, both methods agree that x = 50 is the point where maximum revenue occurs.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can graph this function in my mind. R(x) = -x^2 + 100x is a downward-opening parabola with vertex at (50, 2500). As x approaches 0, R(x) = 0, and as x approaches 100, R(x) = 100*100 - 100^2 = 10,000 - 10,000 = 0. So, it makes sense that the maximum is at x = 50.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Perhaps using completing the square.\n\nLet's try completing the square for R(x):\n\nR(x) = -x^2 + 100x\n\n= -(x^2 - 100x)\n\nTo complete the square, take half of -100, which is -50, then square it to get 2500.\n\nSo, R(x) = -(x^2 - 100x + 2500 - 2500)\n\n= -( (x - 50)^2 - 2500 )\n\n= -(x - 50)^2 + 2500\n\nSo, in vertex form, R(x) = - (x - 50)^2 + 2500.\n\nThis clearly shows that the vertex is at (50, 2500), which matches what I found earlier.\n\nI think I've confirmed this enough ways. The answer should be that the maximum revenue is 2500, achieved by selling 50 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2500 \\text{ at } x = 50} \\]"
