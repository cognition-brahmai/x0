        "content": "So I've got this problem here about two factories producing widgets, and I need to find out the combined daily production cost for both of them. Let's see, Factory X produces 300 widgets per day at a cost of $5 per widget, and Factory Y produces 200 widgets per day at a cost of $7 per widget. Okay, so to find the combined daily production cost, I think I need to calculate the daily cost for each factory separately and then add them together.\n\nFirst, let's tackle Factory X. It produces 300 widgets each day, and each widget costs $5 to make. So, the daily cost for Factory X should be 300 widgets multiplied by $5 per widget. Let me do that calculation: 300 times 5 is 1500. So, Factory X has a daily production cost of $1500.\n\nNext, Factory Y produces 200 widgets per day at a cost of $7 per widget. So, the daily cost for Factory Y would be 200 widgets times $7 per widget. That's 200 times 7, which equals 1400. Therefore, Factory Y's daily production cost is $1400.\n\nNow, to find the combined daily production cost for both factories, I need to add the two amounts together: $1500 from Factory X plus $1400 from Factory Y. Let's add those up: 1500 plus 1400 equals 2900.\n\nSo, the combined daily production cost for both factories is $2900.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe I can consider the total number of widgets produced by both factories and then find some average cost or something. Factory X produces 300 widgets at $5 each, and Factory Y produces 200 at $7 each. So, the total production is 300 plus 200, which is 500 widgets per day.\n\nIf I were to find the average cost per widget, it would be the total cost divided by the total number of widgets. We already know the total cost is $2900 for 500 widgets, so the average cost per widget would be 2900 divided by 500, which is $5.80 per widget. But the question is asking for the combined daily production cost, not the average cost per widget. So, sticking with the initial approach, $2900 is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of total cost. The total cost is the sum of the individual costs of each factory, which is what I calculated earlier. Unless there are other costs involved, like overhead or something, but the problem doesn't mention any additional costs beyond the production costs per widget.\n\nAnother way to verify this is to consider the total number of widgets and their respective costs. Factory X's 300 widgets at $5 each total $1500, and Factory Y's 200 widgets at $7 each total $1400. Adding those up gives $2900 again.\n\nI think that's straightforward enough. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but it's always good to double-check. Is there any other aspect to this problem that I might be missing? The question seems pretty straightforward: calculate the combined daily production cost based on the given production rates and costs per widget for each factory.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider if there are any economies of scale or discounts for producing larger quantities, but again, the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It just gives the production rates and costs per widget for each factory.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the combined daily production cost for both factories is $2900.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2900} \\]"
