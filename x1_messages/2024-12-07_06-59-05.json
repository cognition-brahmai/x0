        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of people, and 60% of them prefer coffee over tea. That means the remaining percentage prefers tea, right? Since there are only two options here\u2014coffee or tea\u2014the percentage that prefers tea would be 100% minus 60%, which is 40%.\n\nNow, we're told that there are 45 people who prefer tea. So, this 45 represents the 40% of the group that prefers tea. Our goal is to find out the total number of people in the group.\n\nTo find the total number of people, we can set up an equation where 40% of the total group equals 45. Let's denote the total number of people in the group as \\( x \\). Therefore, 40% of \\( x \\) is 45, which can be written as:\n\n\\[ 0.4x = 45 \\]\n\nNow, to find \\( x \\), we need to solve for it by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.4:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{45}{0.4} \\]\n\nCalculating that gives:\n\n\\[ x = 112.5 \\]\n\nWait a minute, that can't be right. We can't have half a person in a group; the number of people should be a whole number. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me double-check.\n\nAlright, let's try another approach. If 60% prefer coffee, then indeed 40% prefer tea. And 45 people represent that 40%. So, to find the total number of people, I can think of it as 40% corresponding to 45 people. Therefore, 1% would be \\( \\frac{45}{40} \\), which is 1.125 people. Then, to find 100%, I multiply 1.125 by 100, which gives me 112.5 again. Hmm, still getting 112.5.\n\nThis suggests that there might be an error in the problem statement or in my understanding of it. Perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that preferences are strictly between coffee and tea, with no one having a preference for both or neither. But based on the information given, that seems to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to consider that some people might not have a preference, but the wording says \"prefer coffee over tea,\" implying that everyone has a preference for one or the other.\n\nLet me try another method. If 60% prefer coffee and 40% prefer tea, and there are 45 people who prefer tea, then the number of people who prefer coffee would be larger. But we don't have that number directly. So, sticking to the information given, I think the calculation is correct, and the group should have 112.5 people.\n\nBut since we can't have half a person, maybe the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number, which would be 113 people.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me consider if there's another way to interpret the problem.\n\nWait a second, maybe the problem is that the group includes people who prefer coffee over tea, and perhaps some who prefer both or neither. But the problem states that 60% prefer coffee over tea, which typically means they prefer coffee to tea, implying that the remaining 40% prefer tea over coffee.\n\nGiven that, and given that there are 45 people who prefer tea, which is 40% of the total group, the calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the percentages don't add up to 100% because some people are neutral or prefer another beverage, but the problem specifies that 60% prefer coffee over tea, which implies that the rest prefer tea.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is indeed 112.5, but since we can't have half a person, it's likely that the problem expects us to round to 113.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup, and it should be that 60% prefer coffee and the rest prefer tea, with no overlapping preferences.\n\nIn any case, based on the information provided, the calculation is consistent, leading to 112.5 people, which should be rounded to 113.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{113} \\]"
