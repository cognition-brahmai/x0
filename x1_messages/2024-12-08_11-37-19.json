        "content": "The Riemann zeta function, denoted by \u03b6(s), is a significant function in mathematics, particularly in number theory and complex analysis. It is defined for complex numbers s with real part greater than 1 by the absolutely convergent infinite series:\n\n\u03b6(s) = \u2211_{n=1}^\u221e 1/n^s\n\nTo show that \u03b6(s) has a pole at s=1, we need to analyze the behavior of the function as s approaches 1.\n\nFirst, let's consider the harmonic series, which is the series:\n\nH_n = \u2211_{k=1}^n 1/k\n\nIt is well-known that the harmonic series diverges as n approaches infinity. Specifically, H_n grows logarithmically with n; more precisely:\n\nH_n ~ ln(n) + \u03b3 + O(1/n)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n\nNow, let's consider the zeta function \u03b6(s) for s approaching 1 from the right (i.e., s > 1). We can write:\n\n\u03b6(s) = \u2211_{n=1}^\u221e 1/n^s\n\nTo understand the behavior of this series as s approaches 1, we can compare it to the integral of 1/x^s from 1 to infinity. This integral can be computed as follows:\n\n\u222b_1^\u221e (1/x^s) dx = lim_{t\u2192\u221e} \u222b_1^t x^{-s} dx\n\n= lim_{t\u2192\u221e} [x^{1-s}/(1-s)]_1^t\n\n= lim_{t\u2192\u221e} [t^{1-s}/(1-s) - 1/(1-s)]\n\n= 1/(s-1)\n\nprovided that s > 1.\n\nThis suggests that \u03b6(s) behaves like 1/(s-1) as s approaches 1 from the right.\n\nTo make this more rigorous, we can use the Euler-Maclaurin formula, which relates sums to integrals. The Euler-Maclaurin formula states that:\n\n\u2211_{n=1}^N f(n) = \u222b_1^N f(x) dx + (f(1) + f(N))/2 + \u222b_1^N (x - floor(x) - 1/2) f'(x) dx\n\nFor f(x) = 1/x^s, we have:\n\n\u2211_{n=1}^N 1/n^s = \u222b_1^N (1/x^s) dx + (1 + 1/N^s)/2 + \u222b_1^N (x - floor(x) - 1/2)(-s/x^{s+1}) dx\n\nEvaluating the integral \u222b_1^N (1/x^s) dx, we get:\n\n\u222b_1^N x^{-s} dx = [x^{1-s}/(1-s)]_1^N = N^{1-s}/(1-s) - 1/(1-s)\n\nAs N approaches infinity, N^{1-s} approaches 0 if s > 1. Therefore:\n\n\u2211_{n=1}^\u221e 1/n^s = 1/(s-1) + C(s)\n\nwhere C(s) is a term that remains finite as s approaches 1.\n\nTo find C(s), we can consider the difference:\n\nC(s) = \u03b6(s) - 1/(s-1)\n\nWe can analyze the behavior of C(s) as s approaches 1. Using the Euler-Maclaurin formula, we see that C(s) includes terms involving the evaluation of the integral involving f'(x), which for f(x) = 1/x^s is -s/x^{s+1}. This integral converges to a finite value as s approaches 1.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n\u03b6(s) = 1/(s-1) + \u03b3 + O(s-1)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n\nThis shows that as s approaches 1, \u03b6(s) behaves like 1/(s-1) plus a finite term, indicating that \u03b6(s) has a simple pole at s=1 with residue 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the Riemann zeta function \u03b6(s) has a pole at s=1, and this pole is simple with residue 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The Riemann zeta function } \\zeta(s) \\text{ has a simple pole at } s=1 \\text{ with residue } 1.} \\]"
