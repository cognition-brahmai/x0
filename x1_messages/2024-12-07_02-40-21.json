        "content": "Let's see. So, there are five coworkers who are planning a surprise birthday party for their colleague, Susan. Each one of them brings a different item: balloons, cake, drinks, snacks, and decorations. They all leave the room to hide before Susan arrives. While they're away, the janitor comes in and rearranges everything, putting the items in different spots. Then, the coworkers come back into the room and see that everything has been moved. I need to think about how they might react to these changes.\n\nFirst, I should consider what the original setup was like. Since each coworker brought a specific item, they probably had a plan for where everything would go to create a nice atmosphere for Susan. Maybe they arranged the balloons around the room, placed the cake on a table, set up drinks and snacks on another table, and decorated the space with streamers, banners, or other decorative elements. They likely took some time to make sure everything looked perfect for the surprise.\n\nNow, the janitor comes in and rearranges everything. This could mean that the balloons are in a different spot, the cake might be moved, the drinks and snacks could be relocated, and the decorations are shifted. The janitor might not have known about the surprise or understood the thought that went into the arrangement. Perhaps the janitor was cleaning or reorganizing the room for another purpose, and in doing so, disturbed the setup.\n\nWhen the coworkers return to the room, they're expecting everything to be as they left it. They might walk in and immediately notice that something is off. For example, they could see that the balloons are no longer where they placed them, or that the cake is in a different location. This could cause confusion and perhaps even panic, as they realize that their carefully planned surprise has been disrupted.\n\nEach coworker might react differently based on their personalities and how invested they are in the surprise. Let's consider each one:\n\n1. **The one who brought the balloons:** This person might be responsible for the decorations in general. If they see that the balloons have been moved, they could feel frustrated or annoyed because they spent time arranging them just so. They might start to rearrange them back to their original places immediately.\n\n2. **The one who brought the cake:** This person could be particularly attached to the cake since it's a central part of the celebration. If they find that the cake has been moved or is not where they left it, they might check if it's still okay\u2014maybe making sure it hasn't been damaged or that it's still at the right temperature. They could be a bit stressed about any potential changes to the cake's presentation.\n\n3. **The one who brought the drinks:** This person might be in charge of beverages for the party. If they see that the drinks have been rearranged, they could take a moment to see if anything has been spilled or if the glasses are still intact. They might quickly straighten things up to ensure everything is ready for Susan's arrival.\n\n4. **The one who brought the snacks:** Similar to the drinks, this person is responsible for the food aspect. They might check if the snacks are still arranged attractively and that nothing has been disturbed or spilled. They could be focused on making sure everything looks appealing for Susan.\n\n5. **The one who brought additional decorations:** This person might have brought items like streamers, balloons, or a banner. If these items have been moved, they could spend time readjusting them to create the intended ambiance. They might be particular about the placement to make the room look festive.\n\nOverall, the coworkers' reactions would likely be a mix of surprise, confusion, and perhaps a bit of annoyance. However, since they are all working towards the same goal of surprising Susan, they would probably collaborate to quickly fix any disturbances caused by the janitor. They might assign tasks among themselves to reset the room to its original state before Susan arrives.\n\nAdditionally, one of them might consider finding the janitor to explain what happened and perhaps thank them for their help, although unintentional. They might also clarify the situation to prevent any further changes to the room setup.\n\nIn any case, their priority would be to ensure that the surprise is not spoiled and that everything is perfect for Susan when she enters the room. So, despite the inconvenience caused by the janitor's rearrangement, they would probably handle the situation professionally and efficiently, coming together to restore the room to their original plan.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The coworkers would likely be surprised and perhaps annoyed by the janitor's rearrangement, but they would collaborate to quickly restore the room to their original setup, ensuring the surprise party for Susan remains perfect.}} \\]"
