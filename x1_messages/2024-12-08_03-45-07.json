        "content": "Actually, the belief that Albert Einstein failed mathematics in school is a widespread myth. Einstein was actually talented in mathematics from a young age. In fact, he was self-taught in calculus and was able to solve complex differential equations by the age of 15. This misconception may have arisen because in Switzerland, where Einstein went to school, the grading system was different from that in Germany. In the Swiss school system, 6 was the lowest grade, equivalent to a failing grade in other systems, but Einstein received a 6 in French, not in mathematics. So, he did not fail in mathematics; rather, he excelled in it."
