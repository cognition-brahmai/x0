Wristwatches are human inventions designed for people to tell time. Rabbits, being animals, don't have the cognitive ability or physical attributes to use or wear such devices. However, in imaginative scenarios like cartoons or children's stories, animals are often anthropomorphized and portrayed wearing clothes or accessories, including wristwatches. But in the real world, rabbits don't wear wristwatches."
