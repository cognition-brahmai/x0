        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! In Go, you can create a function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. Recursion is a method where the function calls itself with a reduced problem size until it reaches a base case.\n\nFor factorials, the base case is when the number is 0 or 1, because the factorial of both is 1. For any other positive integer n, the factorial is n multiplied by the factorial of (n-1).\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Go:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\n// Factorial function calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion.\nfunc Factorial(n int) int {\n    if n == 0 || n == 1 {\n        return 1\n    }\n    return n * Factorial(n-1)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    var number int\n    fmt.Print(\"Enter a non-negative integer: \")\n    fmt.Scan(&number)\n    if number < 0 {\n        fmt.Println(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\")\n    } else {\n        result := Factorial(number)\n        fmt.Printf(\"The factorial of %d is %d\\n\", number, result)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Definition**:\n   - `Factorial(n int) int`: This function takes an integer `n` and returns its factorial as an integer.\n   \n2. **Base Case**:\n   - If `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns 1 because the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1.\n   \n3. **Recursive Case**:\n   - For any other positive integer `n`, the function returns `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n-1`.\n   \n4. **Main Function**:\n   - It prompts the user to enter a non-negative integer.\n   - It reads the input and checks if it's negative. If negative, it prints an error message.\n   - If the number is non-negative, it calculates the factorial using the `Factorial` function and prints the result.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n\n- **Stack Overflow**: Recursive functions can lead to a stack overflow if the depth of recursion is too high. In Go, the default stack size is relatively small, so for large values of `n`, you might encounter a stack overflow error. For such cases, an iterative approach is preferred.\n- **Input Validation**: The program checks if the input is negative and handles it appropriately since factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n\nThis should give you a good starting point for calculating factorials using recursion in Go.
