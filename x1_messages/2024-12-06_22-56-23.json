        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a company with 500 employees, and each employee uses an average of 10 paper sheets per day. We need to find out how many reams of paper the company needs to supply for one month, assuming there are 20 working days in that month. Also, each ream contains 500 sheets.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total number of paper sheets used by all employees in one day. Since there are 500 employees and each uses 10 sheets per day, I can multiply these two numbers to get the daily usage.\n\nTotal daily usage = Number of employees \u00d7 Sheets per employee per day\nTotal daily usage = 500 \u00d7 10 = 5,000 sheets per day\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total usage for one month. Given that there are 20 working days in the month, I can multiply the daily usage by the number of working days.\n\nTotal monthly usage = Total daily usage \u00d7 Number of working days\nTotal monthly usage = 5,000 \u00d7 20 = 100,000 sheets per month\n\nNow, I need to determine how many reams are required to supply 100,000 sheets. Since each ream contains 500 sheets, I can divide the total monthly usage by the number of sheets per ream.\n\nNumber of reams needed = Total monthly usage / Sheets per ream\nNumber of reams needed = 100,000 / 500 = 200 reams\n\nSo, the company needs to supply 200 reams of paper for one month.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, 500 employees times 10 sheets per employee per day equals 5,000 sheets per day. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 5,000 sheets per day times 20 working days equals 100,000 sheets per month. That also seems right.\n\nFinally, 100,000 sheets divided by 500 sheets per ream equals 200 reams. Yep, that appears to be correct.\n\nI think that's the answer: the company needs 200 reams of paper for one month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
