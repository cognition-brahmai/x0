The ship has a capacity of 2,000 passengers and offers various types of cabins: interior (500 available, $1,200 per person), ocean view (800 available, $1,500 per person), balcony (600 available, $2,000 per person), and suite (100 available, $3,500 per person). Calculate the total revenue generated from cabin sales if the ship sails at full capacity. Additionally, estimate the daily food and beverage costs based on an average spend of $75 per passenger per day."

        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. First, we need to calculate the total revenue from cabin sales if the ship sails at full capacity. The ship has different types of cabins with varying prices and availabilities. Here's the breakdown:\n\n- Interior cabins: 500 available, $1,200 per person\n\n- Ocean view cabins: 800 available, $1,500 per person\n\n- Balcony cabins: 600 available, $2,000 per person\n\n- Suite cabins: 100 available, $3,500 per person\n\nSince the ship has a capacity of 2,000 passengers, and the total available cabins add up to 500 + 800 + 600 + 100 = 2,000, it's sailing at full capacity with all cabins booked.\n\nTo find the total revenue from cabin sales, we need to multiply the number of cabins by the price per person for each type and then sum them all up.\n\nLet's calculate it:\n\nInterior cabins revenue: 500 cabins * $1,200 = $600,000\n\nOcean view cabins revenue: 800 cabins * $1,500 = $1,200,000\n\nBalcony cabins revenue: 600 cabins * $2,000 = $1,200,000\n\nSuite cabins revenue: 100 cabins * $3,500 = $350,000\n\nNow, add all these up to get the total revenue from cabin sales:\n\n$600,000 + $1,200,000 + $1,200,000 + $350,000 = $3,350,000\n\nSo, the total revenue from cabin sales is $3,350,000.\n\nNext, we need to estimate the daily food and beverage costs based on an average spend of $75 per passenger per day for a 7-day trip.\n\nFirst, calculate the total food and beverage cost per passenger for the entire trip:\n\n$75 per day * 7 days = $525 per passenger\n\nSince there are 2,000 passengers, the total food and beverage cost for all passengers is:\n\n2,000 passengers * $525 = $1,050,000\n\nTherefore, the estimated daily food and beverage costs for the entire trip are $1,050,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nTotal revenue from cabin sales: $\\boxed{3350000}$\n\nEstimated total food and beverage costs: $\\boxed{1050000}$"
