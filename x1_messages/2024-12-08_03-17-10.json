        "content": "So there are seven people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes occur in total. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I think about how many people there are and how many handshakes each person makes. There are seven people, and each shakes hands with every other person. So, for each person, how many handshakes do they make? Well, since there are seven people, and one person doesn't shake hands with themselves, each person shakes hands with six other people.\n\nSo, if each of the seven people shakes hands with six others, that would seem to suggest a total of 7 times 6, which is 42 handshakes. But wait, that can't be right because each handshake involves two people. So, in this count of 42, each handshake is being counted twice\u2014once for each person involved in the handshake.\n\nTo get the actual number of unique handshakes, I need to divide that number by 2. So, 42 divided by 2 is 21. Therefore, there should be 21 unique handshakes.\n\nLet me think about another way to approach this to confirm. I recall that the number of ways to choose two people out of seven to shake hands is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n is 7 (the seven people), and k is 2 (since a handshake involves two people). So, C(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7 - 2)!) = (7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)).\n\nSimplifying this, the 5!, which is 120, cancels out from the numerator and the denominator, leaving us with (7 \u00d7 6) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 42 / 2 = 21.\n\nSo, again, that gives me 21 handshakes.\n\nLet me try another approach to make sure. I can list out the handshakes manually, but with seven people, that might be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for a pattern with smaller numbers.\n\nSuppose there are 2 people: A and B. They shake hands once. So, total handshakes: 1.\n\nWith 3 people: A, B, C. A shakes with B and C; B shakes with C. So, total handshakes: 3.\n\nWith 4 people: A, B, C, D. A shakes with B, C, D; B shakes with C, D; C shakes with D. So, that's 6 handshakes.\n\nWith 5 people: A, B, C, D, E. A shakes with B, C, D, E; B shakes with C, D, E; C shakes with D, E; D shakes with E. So, that's 10 handshakes.\n\nI see a pattern here: 2 people -> 1 handshake, 3 people -> 3 handshakes, 4 people -> 6 handshakes, 5 people -> 10 handshakes.\n\nThese numbers look familiar; they're triangular numbers. The nth triangular number is given by n(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, for 7 people, it should be 7 \u00d7 6 / 2 = 42 / 2 = 21 handshakes.\n\nAlright, multiple methods are leading me to the same answer: 21 handshakes.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility of overlapping handshakes or some handshakes being counted multiple times, but since each handshake is unique and between two distinct people, and each pair shakes hands only once, 21 seems solid.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]"
