        "content": "Let's break this down. The car rental company charges $50 per day and an additional 25 cents per mile driven. I need to find out the total cost for renting the car for 4 days and driving it for 300 miles.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the cost for renting the car for 4 days. Since it's $50 per day, I'll multiply 50 by 4.\n\n50 * 4 = 200\n\nSo, the rental cost for 4 days is $200.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the cost for driving 300 miles. The charge is 25 cents per mile. So, I'll multiply 0.25 by 300.\n\n0.25 * 300 = 75\n\nTherefore, the cost for driving 300 miles is $75.\n\nNow, I'll add both costs to get the total cost.\n\n200 + 75 = 275\n\nSo, the total cost to rent the car for 4 days and drive it for 300 miles is $275.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps there's a daily mileage limit or some additional fees, but based on the information provided, it seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes rental companies have a package deal for a certain number of miles included in the daily rate, and then charge extra for miles beyond that. But here, it just says $50 per day plus 25 cents per mile driven, so no mention of any included miles.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the 25 cents per mile is for each mile driven, regardless of the number of days. I think that's the case here.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other costs that might be involved, like tax or insurance, but the question only mentions the daily rental fee and the per-mile charge. So, I'll stick with the calculation I did.\n\nTherefore, the total cost is $200 for the rental plus $75 for the miles, totaling $275.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{275} \\]"
