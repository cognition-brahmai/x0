        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a bag with 6 red balls, 4 blue balls, and 5 green balls. That's a total of 6 + 4 + 5 = 15 balls. We're drawing 3 balls at random without replacement, and we want to find the probability of drawing exactly 2 red balls and 1 ball of another color.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once we draw a ball, it stays out, and doesn't go back into the bag. So, the total number of balls decreases with each draw.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the probability of drawing exactly 2 red balls and 1 ball that's not red. The non-red balls could be either blue or green. So, I need to consider both possibilities for the third ball.\n\nOne way to approach this is to use combinations. Combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, which is the case here since we're just interested in the types of balls drawn, not the order in which they're drawn.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the total number of items,\n\n- k is the number of items to choose,\n\n- \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 15. That's C(15, 3).\n\nC(15, 3) = 15! / (3!(15 - 3)!) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 455\n\nSo, there are 455 different combinations of 3 balls that can be drawn from the bag.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is drawing exactly 2 red balls and 1 ball of another color.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of ways to draw 2 red balls out of 6.\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6 - 2)!) = (6 \u00d7 5) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 15\n\nSo, there are 15 ways to choose 2 red balls.\n\nNow, for the third ball, it needs to be either blue or green, but not red. There are 4 blue and 5 green balls, making a total of 4 + 5 = 9 non-red balls.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 1 non-red ball out of 9 is:\n\nC(9, 1) = 9! / (1!(9 - 1)!) = 9 / 1 = 9\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is the product of the two combinations:\n\nNumber of favorable outcomes = C(6, 2) \u00d7 C(9, 1) = 15 \u00d7 9 = 135\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes = 135 / 455\n\nLet's simplify that fraction. Both 135 and 455 are divisible by 5.\n\n135 \u00f7 5 = 27\n\n455 \u00f7 5 = 91\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 27/91.\n\nAlternatively, we can convert this to a decimal for better understanding.\n\n27 \u00f7 91 \u2248 0.2967\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.2967, or 29.67%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the different sequences in which we can draw the balls. For example, we could draw red first, then red again, and then a non-red ball. Or red, then non-red, then red. Or non-red, then red, then red.\n\nSince the order doesn't matter in combinations, but if I consider permutations, I need to account for the different orders.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability for one specific sequence, say, red, red, non-red.\n\nThe probability of drawing a red ball first is 6/15, since there are 6 red balls out of 15.\n\nAfter drawing one red ball, there are now 5 red balls left and a total of 14 balls.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing another red ball is 5/14.\n\nThen, for the third draw, we need a non-red ball. There are 9 non-red balls left out of 13 total balls.\n\nSo, the probability for this sequence is:\n\n(6/15) \u00d7 (5/14) \u00d7 (9/13)\n\nNow, let's calculate that:\n\nFirst, 6/15 = 0.4\n\nThen, 0.4 \u00d7 5/14 = 0.4 \u00d7 0.3571 \u2248 0.1429\n\nThen, 0.1429 \u00d7 9/13 \u2248 0.1429 \u00d7 0.6923 \u2248 0.0990\n\nSo, the probability for this specific sequence is approximately 0.0990.\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter, we need to consider all possible sequences where exactly 2 red balls and 1 non-red ball are drawn.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the possible sequences are:\n\n1. Red, red, non-red\n\n2. Red, non-red, red\n\n3. Non-red, red, red\n\nSo, there are 3 different sequences.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is 3 times the probability of one specific sequence.\n\nTotal probability = 3 \u00d7 0.0990 \u2248 0.2970\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation of approximately 0.2967. The slight difference is due to rounding errors.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.2967, or 29.67%.\n\nBut in fraction form, it's 27/91.\n\nWait, can this fraction be simplified further? Let's check.\n\n27 and 91 don't have any common factors other than 1, so 27/91 is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 27/91.\n\nAlternatively, some people might prefer to leave it as a decimal or a percentage.\n\nAs a decimal, it's approximately 0.2967.\n\nAs a percentage, it's approximately 29.67%.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify the format, I'll stick with the fraction 27/91.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider another approach using combinations.\n\nWe already did that, but let's see if there's a different way.\n\nWe could consider the total number of ways to draw exactly 2 red balls and 1 ball of another color, and then divide by the total number of ways to draw any 3 balls.\n\nWe already calculated that as C(6, 2) \u00d7 C(9, 1) / C(15, 3) = 15 \u00d7 9 / 455 = 135 / 455 = 27/91.\n\nAlternatively, we could think in terms of probabilities step by step, considering the changing probabilities with each draw without replacement.\n\nBut that's essentially what we did in the sequence approach earlier.\n\nAnother way is to use the hypergeometric distribution formula, which is used for calculating probabilities when sampling without replacement.\n\nThe hypergeometric distribution formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = [C(K, k) \u00d7 C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (total number of balls: 15)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (red balls: 6)\n\n- n is the number of draws (3)\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (2 red balls)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 2) = [C(6, 2) \u00d7 C(15 - 6, 3 - 2)] / C(15, 3) = [15 \u00d7 9] / 455 = 135 / 455 = 27/91\n\nSo, again, we get the same result.\n\nI think it's clear now that the probability is 27/91.\n\nJust to address any potential confusion, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nThe problem says \"exactly 2 red balls and 1 ball of another color.\" Another color refers to either blue or green, but not red.\n\nSo, we don't need to separately consider the cases where the third ball is blue or green because we've already accounted for that by subtracting the red balls from the total to get the non-red balls.\n\nBut, for completeness, let's consider separately the cases where the third ball is blue or green.\n\nFirst, probability of drawing exactly 2 red and 1 blue ball.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 red balls: C(6, 2) = 15\n\nNumber of ways to choose 1 blue ball: C(4, 1) = 4\n\nTotal favorable outcomes for this case: 15 \u00d7 4 = 60\n\nProbability for this case: 60 / 455 \u2248 0.1319\n\nSimilarly, probability of drawing exactly 2 red and 1 green ball.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 red balls: C(6, 2) = 15\n\nNumber of ways to choose 1 green ball: C(5, 1) = 5\n\nTotal favorable outcomes for this case: 15 \u00d7 5 = 75\n\nProbability for this case: 75 / 455 \u2248 0.1648\n\nNow, adding these two probabilities together:\n\n0.1319 + 0.1648 \u2248 0.2967\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, whether we consider the non-red balls as a single group of 9 or separately as blue and green, we arrive at the same probability.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 27/91, or approximately 0.2967, or 29.67%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{27}{91}} \\]"
