        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 10 red balls and 15 blue balls, making a total of 25 balls. I need to find the probability of drawing exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball when I draw 3 balls at random without replacement. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the formula for probability, which is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are the ways to draw exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball, and the total outcomes are all the ways to draw any 3 balls from the box.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to draw 3 balls from 25 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. Here, n = 25 and k = 3.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(25, 3) = 25! / (3!(25 - 3)!) = (25 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 23) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (25 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 23) / 6.\n\nLet's compute that step by step:\n\n25 \u00d7 24 = 600\n\n600 \u00d7 23 = 13,800\n\n13,800 / 6 = 2,300\n\nSo, there are 2,300 possible ways to draw 3 balls from 25.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is drawing exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball.\n\nThere are 10 red balls, so the number of ways to choose 2 red balls is C(10, 2).\n\nSimilarly, there are 15 blue balls, so the number of ways to choose 1 blue ball is C(15, 1).\n\nThen, the number of favorable outcomes is C(10, 2) \u00d7 C(15, 1).\n\nLet's calculate C(10, 2):\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10 - 2)!) = (10 \u00d7 9) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 45\n\nAnd C(15, 1) = 15! / (1!(15 - 1)!) = 15 / 1 = 15\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 45 \u00d7 15.\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n45 \u00d7 15 = 675\n\nTherefore, there are 675 favorable ways to draw exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = 675 / 2,300\n\nLet's simplify that fraction.\n\nFirst, see if 675 and 2,300 have any common factors.\n\n675 divided by 25 is 27, and 2,300 divided by 25 is 92.\n\nSo, 675 \u00f7 25 = 27\n\n2,300 \u00f7 25 = 92\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is 27/92.\n\nSo, the probability is 27/92.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of permutations since the order might matter, but in combinations, order doesn't matter, which is appropriate here.\n\nAlternatively, another way to calculate this is using the formula for hypergeometric distribution, since we're drawing without replacement.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = [C(K, k) \u00d7 C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (25 balls)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (10 red balls)\n\n- n is the number of draws (3 balls)\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (2 red balls)\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nP(2 red) = [C(10, 2) \u00d7 C(15, 1)] / C(25, 3)\n\nWhich is the same as what I calculated earlier: [45 \u00d7 15] / 2,300 = 675 / 2,300 = 27/92\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate it step by step considering the sequence of draws, but since the order doesn't matter in combinations, the above method is sufficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should verify it using the step-by-step approach for better understanding.\n\nSo, if I consider drawing 3 balls one by one without replacement, and I want exactly 2 red and 1 blue.\n\nThere are different sequences in which this can occur:\n\n1. Red, Red, Blue\n\n2. Red, Blue, Red\n\n3. Blue, Red, Red\n\nI'll calculate the probability for each sequence and then add them up.\n\nFirst sequence: Red, Red, Blue\n\nProbability of first ball being red: 10/25\n\nThen, second ball being red: 9/24 (since one red is already drawn)\n\nThird ball being blue: 15/23 (since two reds are already drawn, so 25 - 2 = 23 balls left)\n\nSo, probability for this sequence: (10/25) \u00d7 (9/24) \u00d7 (15/23)\n\nLet's compute that:\n\nFirst, 10/25 = 2/5\n\nThen, 9/24 = 3/8\n\nThen, 15/23 remains as is.\n\nSo, (2/5) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (15/23) = (2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 15) / (5 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 23) = 90 / 920 = 9/92\n\nOkay, so the probability for the first sequence is 9/92.\n\nNow, second sequence: Red, Blue, Red\n\nProbability of first ball being red: 10/25\n\nSecond ball being blue: 15/24 (since one red is already drawn)\n\nThird ball being red: 9/23 (since one red and one blue are already drawn, so 10 - 1 = 9 reds left and 25 - 2 = 23 balls left)\n\nSo, probability for this sequence: (10/25) \u00d7 (15/24) \u00d7 (9/23)\n\nCompute that:\n\n10/25 = 2/5\n\n15/24 = 5/8\n\n9/23 remains as is.\n\nSo, (2/5) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (9/23) = (2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 9) / (5 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 23) = 90 / 920 = 9/92\n\nSame as the first sequence.\n\nThird sequence: Blue, Red, Red\n\nProbability of first ball being blue: 15/25\n\nSecond ball being red: 10/24 (since one blue is already drawn)\n\nThird ball being red: 9/23 (since one red is already drawn, so 10 - 1 = 9 reds left and 25 - 2 = 23 balls left)\n\nSo, probability for this sequence: (15/25) \u00d7 (10/24) \u00d7 (9/23)\n\nCompute that:\n\n15/25 = 3/5\n\n10/24 = 5/12\n\n9/23 remains as is.\n\nSo, (3/5) \u00d7 (5/12) \u00d7 (9/23) = (3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 9) / (5 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 23) = 135 / 1,380 = 27/276\n\nWait, let's simplify 135 / 1,380.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 27 / 276\n\nFurther simplify by dividing by 3: 9 / 92\n\nSo, again, 9/92.\n\nTherefore, each sequence has a probability of 9/92.\n\nSince there are 3 such sequences, total probability is 3 \u00d7 (9/92) = 27/92.\n\nThis matches the previous result obtained using combinations.\n\nSo, the probability is indeed 27/92.\n\nAlternatively, I can confirm this using decimal conversion.\n\nFirst, 27 divided by 92.\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\n92 goes into 27 zero times, so 0.\n\nAdd decimal and a zero: 270 divided by 92 is 2 (since 92 \u00d7 2 = 184)\n\nSubtract: 270 - 184 = 86\n\nBring down a zero: 860 divided by 92 is 9 (since 92 \u00d7 9 = 828)\n\nSubtract: 860 - 828 = 32\n\nBring down a zero: 320 divided by 92 is 3 (since 92 \u00d7 3 = 276)\n\nSubtract: 320 - 276 = 44\n\nBring down a zero: 440 divided by 92 is 4 (since 92 \u00d7 4 = 368)\n\nSubtract: 440 - 368 = 72\n\nBring down a zero: 720 divided by 92 is 7 (since 92 \u00d7 7 = 644)\n\nSubtract: 720 - 644 = 76\n\nBring down a zero: 760 divided by 92 is 8 (since 92 \u00d7 8 = 736)\n\nSubtract: 760 - 736 = 24\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, 27/92 is approximately 0.29347826087, which is roughly 0.2935.\n\nAlternatively, using the initial combination method, 675 / 2,300.\n\nLet's check that:\n\n675 \u00f7 2,300.\n\nWell, 2,300 \u00d7 0.29347826087 is approximately 675.\n\nYes, it matches.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 27/92, or approximately 0.2935.\n\nSo, the final answer is 27/92.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{27}{92}} \\]\n"
