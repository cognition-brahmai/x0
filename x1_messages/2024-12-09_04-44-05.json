        "content": "In the solitude of my vigil, where seagulls sing their tune,\nI stand upon this lighthouse, watching over sea and moon.\nMy heart beats with the rhythm of the waves that crash and roar,\nBut in my soul, a deeper yearning, a love I dare not ignore.\n\nFor there's a captain in a ship, that passes by so near,\nHis eyes like stars above me, his smile, it sets me sear.\nI watch him from afar, as he sails through mist and rain,\nAnd in his eyes, I see a world where my heart could play its part.\n\nOh, how I long to be with him, to feel his arms around,\nTo hear his voice in whispers, to walk upon this ground.\nBut I am just a keeper, bound to this lonely shore,\nWhile he is free as the wind, to wander evermore.\n\nEach night I light the beacon, guiding ships to safe return,\nBut for myself, no guiding light, no hope to make it burn.\nI dream of what could be, of love that might have been,\nBut reality is harsh, and keeps us far between.\n\nSo here I stay, my love concealed, my longing known to few,\nA secret kept within these walls, where only echoes accrue.\nThe sea may wash away the sand, the winds may change their course,\nBut in my heart, this love remains, a flame that never forces.\n\nFor he is like a ship at sea, destined for distant lands,\nWhile I am rooted to this place, my love but sands through hands.\nYet still I watch, and wait, and wish for what might be,\nA chance to cross this vast expanse, and set my heart free.\n\nBut reality is stern, and love unrequited stays,\nA bittersweet symphony, played by time's relentless ways.\nSo I keep my watch, and tend the light, a solitary man,\nWith love that shines like beacon bright, but never reaches land.\n\nNote: I understand that this poem touches on a sensitive and potentially triggering subject, unrequited love. It's important to approach such topics with empathy and understanding, recognizing the pain and complexity they can involve."
