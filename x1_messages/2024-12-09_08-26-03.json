        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a telecom company upgrading their network. They're replacing old cell towers with new ones that have better coverage. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nSo, there are currently 2,000 cell towers, each with an average coverage radius of 5 miles. The new towers have a coverage radius of 7 miles. The goal is to maintain the same overall coverage area, and I need to calculate the percentage reduction in the number of cell towers needed after the upgrade.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how coverage area relates to the number of towers. I think it's safe to assume that the coverage area of a tower is a circle with a radius equal to the coverage radius. So, the area covered by one tower would be \u03c0 times the radius squared.\n\nFor the old towers:\n\nArea per old tower = \u03c0 * (5 miles)^2 = \u03c0 * 25 square miles\n\nFor the new towers:\n\nArea per new tower = \u03c0 * (7 miles)^2 = \u03c0 * 49 square miles\n\nNow, the total coverage area with the old towers is the number of old towers times the area each covers:\n\nTotal old coverage = 2000 * \u03c0 * 25\n\nBut since \u03c0 is a common factor, I can keep it in the equation for now.\n\nNow, to maintain the same total coverage area with the new towers, the number of new towers needed would be:\n\nNumber of new towers = Total old coverage / Area per new tower\n\nWhich is:\n\nNumber of new towers = (2000 * \u03c0 * 25) / (\u03c0 * 49)\n\nI see that \u03c0 cancels out:\n\nNumber of new towers = (2000 * 25) / 49\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 2000 * 25 = 50,000\n\nThen, 50,000 / 49 \u2248 1020.408\n\nSince you can't have a fraction of a tower, I'll round up to the next whole number, so 1021 new towers are needed.\n\nNow, the reduction in the number of towers is the old number minus the new number:\n\nReduction = 2000 - 1021 = 979 towers\n\nTo find the percentage reduction:\n\nPercentage reduction = (reduction / original number) * 100\n\nSo:\n\nPercentage reduction = (979 / 2000) * 100\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n979 / 2000 = 0.4895\n\nThen, 0.4895 * 100 = 48.95%\n\nSo, the percentage reduction is approximately 48.95%.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, area per old tower: \u03c0 * 5^2 = 25\u03c0\n\nArea per new tower: \u03c0 * 7^2 = 49\u03c0\n\nTotal old coverage: 2000 * 25\u03c0 = 50,000\u03c0\n\nNumber of new towers: 50,000\u03c0 / 49\u03c0 = 50,000 / 49 \u2248 1020.408\n\nRounding up to 1021 towers.\n\nReduction: 2000 - 1021 = 979 towers\n\nPercentage reduction: (979 / 2000) * 100 = 48.95%\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the ratio of the areas covered by each tower. Since the new towers cover more area, fewer towers are needed.\n\nThe ratio of the areas is (new area) / (old area) = 49\u03c0 / 25\u03c0 = 49/25 = 1.96\n\nThis means each new tower covers 1.96 times the area of an old tower.\n\nTherefore, the number of new towers needed should be the old number divided by 1.96:\n\n2000 / 1.96 \u2248 1020.408, which again rounds up to 1021 towers.\n\nSo, the percentage reduction calculation remains the same.\n\nI think this is the correct approach and answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48.95\\%} \\]"
