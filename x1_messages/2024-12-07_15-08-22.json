        "content": "Certainly! To calculate the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers, we can use a simple mathematical formula. The formula for the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers is:\n\n\\[ \\text{sum} = \\frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} \\]\n\nThis formula allows us to compute the sum directly without having to iterate through each number, which is efficient and straightforward.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(n):\n    return n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) // 6\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers. The use of integer division `//` ensures that the result is an integer, as the sum of squares of natural numbers is always an integer.\n\nFor example, if you call `sum_of_squares(3)`, it should return 14, because 1\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14.\n\nThis method is efficient with a time complexity of O(1), making it suitable for large values of n."
