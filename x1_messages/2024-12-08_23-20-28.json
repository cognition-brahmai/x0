        "content": "Let's see. The farmer has a rectangular field that's 300 meters long and 200 meters wide. He wants to plant trees around the perimeter, with each tree spaced 10 meters apart. I need to figure out how many trees he will need.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate the perimeter of the field since the trees are to be planted around the edge. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2*(length + width). So, plugging in the values:\n\nP = 2*(300 + 200) = 2*(500) = 1000 meters.\n\nThat means the total distance around the field is 1000 meters.\n\nNow, if trees are to be planted every 10 meters, I can find the number of trees by dividing the perimeter by the spacing between the trees.\n\nNumber of trees = Perimeter /Spacing = 1000 /10 = 100 trees.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that when placing objects at regular intervals around a closed path, you have to consider that the first and last tree will coincide, so you might need to adjust the calculation.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If the perimeter is 1000 meters and trees are every 10 meters, then indeed, dividing 1000 by 10 gives 100. But in a closed loop, the first tree and the last tree would be at the same point, so perhaps you don't need to count one of them.\n\nBut actually, in a closed loop, the number of intervals between trees is equal to the number of trees. So, in this case, 100 intervals of 10 meters each make up the 1000-meter perimeter, which means 100 trees are needed.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for a straight line, the number of trees would be (length / spacing) + 1, because you have trees at both ends. But since this is a closed loop, the ends meet, so you don't add an extra tree.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial calculation, 100 trees should be sufficient.\n\nBut let me double-check by thinking about one side of the rectangle.\n\nLet's take the length side, which is 300 meters. If trees are planted every 10 meters, starting from one end, the number of trees along one length would be 300 /10 = 30 trees.\n\nSimilarly, for the width side, which is 200 meters, the number of trees would be 200 /10 = 20 trees per side.\n\nNow, for the entire rectangle, there are two lengths and two widths.\n\nSo, total trees = 2*(30) + 2*(20) = 60 + 40 = 100 trees.\n\nWait, but in this approach, I'm adding up the trees on all four sides. However, at the corners, trees are shared by two sides. But since the spacing is 10 meters, and the corners are right angles, the trees at the corners are counted once for each side they are on.\n\nBut in reality, each corner tree is shared by two sides, so perhaps I'm overcounting.\n\nLet me think about it more carefully.\n\nStarting at one corner, let's say the bottom left, and move along the width to the bottom right. That's 200 meters, so number of trees is 200 /10 = 20 trees, including the starting corner tree.\n\nThen, moving up the length from bottom right to top right, that's 300 meters, so 30 trees, including the corner tree at the bottom right.\n\nWait, but the corner tree at the bottom right is already counted in the first 20 trees along the width, so should I subtract it to avoid double-counting?\n\nSimilarly, moving along the top width from top right to top left, 200 meters, 20 trees, including the corner tree at top right.\n\nAgain, the corner tree at top right is already included in the previous 30 trees along the length.\n\nAnd finally, moving down the length from top left to bottom left, 300 meters, 30 trees, including the corner tree at top left.\n\nBut the corner tree at top left is already included in the previous 20 trees along the top width.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe it's better to calculate the total perimeter and divide by the spacing, as I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for the number of objects placed at regular intervals around a closed path, which is indeed Perimeter /Spacing.\n\nIn this case, 1000 /10 = 100 trees.\n\nBut to confirm, let's consider a smaller scale example. Suppose the field is 10 meters by 10 meters, so perimeter is 40 meters. Trees every 10 meters.\n\nUsing the formula, number of trees = 40 /10 = 4 trees.\n\nIndeed, you would have one tree at each corner, totaling 4 trees, which makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, if the field is 5 meters by 5 meters, perimeter 20 meters, trees every 5 meters.\n\nNumber of trees = 20 /5 = 4 trees.\n\nAgain, one at each corner.\n\nSo, the formula seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, for the original problem, 1000 /10 = 100 trees is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the arrangement along the sides again.\n\nFor the length sides:\n\nEach length is 300 meters, trees every 10 meters.\n\nNumber of trees per length = 300 /10 +1 = 31 trees.\n\nWait, why did I add 1 this time? Because in a straight line, the number of trees is (distance /spacing) +1, including both ends.\n\nSimilarly, for the width sides:\n\nEach width is 200 meters, trees every 10 meters.\n\nNumber of trees per width = 200 /10 +1 = 21 trees.\n\nNow, for the entire rectangle:\n\nTwo lengths: 2*31 = 62 trees.\n\nTwo widths: 2*21 = 42 trees.\n\nTotal trees = 62 +42 = 104 trees.\n\nBut this seems to contradict my earlier calculation of 100 trees.\n\nWhat's going on here? The discrepancy arises because in this approach, I'm double-counting the corner trees where the sides meet.\n\nIn the first method, when I calculated perimeter /spacing, I got 100 trees, which doesn't account for the corner trees potentially needing extra consideration.\n\nIn the second method, adding trees along each side with +1 for each end, I get 104 trees, but this includes extra trees at the corners.\n\nLet me try to adjust for the double-counted corner trees.\n\nIn the second method, each corner tree is shared by two sides.\n\nSince there are four corners, four trees are double-counted.\n\nTherefore, I need to subtract these four extra trees from the total.\n\nSo, total trees = 104 - 4 = 100 trees.\n\nThis matches the first method's result.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of trees needed is 100.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to calculate the number of intervals between trees, which should equal the number of trees in a closed loop.\n\nGiven the perimeter is 1000 meters and spacing is 10 meters, number of intervals = 1000 /10 = 100.\n\nTherefore, number of trees = number of intervals = 100.\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nSo, the farmer needs 100 trees to plant around the perimeter of the field with 10 meters between each tree.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
