        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, the factory produces 1500 widgets every day, but only for 6 days a week. So, to find out how many widgets it produces in a week, I need to multiply the daily production by the number of days it operates in a week.\n\nWidgets per week = 1500 widgets/day \u00d7 6 days/week = 9000 widgets/week\n\nNow, there are 4 weeks in a month, so to find the monthly production, I'll multiply the weekly production by the number of weeks in a month.\n\nWidgets per month = 9000 widgets/week \u00d7 4 weeks/month = 36,000 widgets/month\n\nFinally, to find out the annual production, I need to know how many months there are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:\n\nWidgets per year = 36,000 widgets/month \u00d7 12 months/year = 432,000 widgets/year\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Is there anything I'm missing here? Oh, I remember that some factories might have holidays or shutdown days, but according to the problem, it's producing 6 days a week for 4 weeks a month, and we're to calculate based on that schedule.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so if the factory operates 6 days a week, the total number of operating days in a year would be:\n\nOperating days per year = 52 weeks/year \u00d7 6 days/week = 312 days/year\n\nThen, the annual production would be:\n\nWidgets per year = 1500 widgets/day \u00d7 312 days/year = 468,000 widgets/year\n\nHmm, that's different from my previous calculation. So, which one is correct?\n\nLet me see. The problem says \"4 weeks in a month,\" but we know that a year has 12 months, so that would suggest 4 weeks/month \u00d7 12 months/year = 48 weeks/year. But actually, there are 52 weeks in a year, so that's inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the \"4 weeks per month\" is an approximation, and the factory operates for 4 weeks each month, with 52 weeks in a year, meaning there are 52 weeks in a year, but with months of varying lengths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory doesn't operate for all 52 weeks; maybe it follows a 4-weeks-on, 1-week-off schedule, which would be 48 weeks a year.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet's consider that the factory operates 6 days a week for 4 weeks each month, and there are 12 months in a year.\n\nSo, total operating days in a year would be:\n\nOperating days per year = 6 days/week \u00d7 4 weeks/month \u00d7 12 months/year = 288 days/year\n\nThen, the annual production would be:\n\nWidgets per year = 1500 widgets/day \u00d7 288 days/year = 432,000 widgets/year\n\nBut wait, this is different from both of my previous calculations. Now I have three different answers: 432,000, 468,000, and again 432,000.\n\nI think the discrepancy comes from how many weeks are considered in a year. If we take the \"4 weeks per month\" approach, with 12 months, that's 48 weeks a year, leading to:\n\nWidgets per year = 9000 widgets/week \u00d7 48 weeks/year = 432,000 widgets/year\n\nBut actually, there are 52 weeks in a year, so if the factory operates 6 days a week for 52 weeks, that would be:\n\nWidgets per year = 1500 widgets/day \u00d7 6 days/week \u00d7 52 weeks/year = 1500 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 52 = 1500 \u00d7 312 = 468,000 widgets/year\n\nHowever, if the factory only operates for 4 weeks each month, that's 48 weeks a year, which would be:\n\nWidgets per year = 1500 widgets/day \u00d7 6 days/week \u00d7 48 weeks/year = 1500 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 48 = 1500 \u00d7 288 = 432,000 widgets/year\n\nSo, depending on whether we consider the factory operating for 4 weeks per month (48 weeks/year) or 52 weeks per year, we get different answers.\n\nI think the problem is trying to simplify things by assuming 4 weeks per month, which amounts to 48 weeks a year, leading to 432,000 widgets per year.\n\nBut to be precise, since there are actually 52 weeks in a year, the factory would operate for 52 weeks, producing 468,000 widgets per year.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects the first calculation, assuming 4 weeks per month.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory operates 6 days a week for 4 weeks each month, but there are months with extra weeks, but the problem specifies \"4 weeks in a month.\"\n\nThis is getting too complicated for what seems like a straightforward problem.\n\nMaybe I should just go with the initial calculation:\n\nDaily production: 1500 widgets\n\nOperating days per week: 6\n\nWeeks per month: 4\n\nMonths per year: 12\n\nSo, widgets per year = 1500 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 12 = 1500 \u00d7 288 = 432,000 widgets\n\nAlternatively, considering there are 52 weeks in a year, operating 6 days a week:\n\nWidgets per year = 1500 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 52 = 1500 \u00d7 312 = 468,000 widgets\n\nBut according to the problem's assumption of 4 weeks per month, it's 48 weeks a year, leading to 432,000 widgets.\n\nI think the problem expects the answer based on its own assumptions, which are:\n\n- 6 days a week\n\n- 4 weeks a month\n\n- 12 months a year\n\nTherefore, total operating days = 6 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 12 = 288 days\n\nTotal production = 1500 \u00d7 288 = 432,000 widgets per year\n\nSo, the factory produces 432,000 widgets in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{432000} \\]"
