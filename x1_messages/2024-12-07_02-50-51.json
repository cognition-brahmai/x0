        "content": "Sure! Below is a simple Java program that implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.\n\n```java\npublic class BubbleSort {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] array = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};\n        bubbleSort(array);\n        System.out.println(\"Sorted array in ascending order:\");\n        printArray(array);\n    }\n\n    // Method to perform bubble sort\n    public static void bubbleSort(int[] array) {\n        int n = array.length;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) {\n                if (array[j] > array[j+1]) {\n                    // swap array[j+1] and array[j]\n                    int temp = array[j];\n                    array[j] = array[j+1];\n                    array[j+1] = temp;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Method to print the array\n    public static void printArray(int[] array) {\n        for (int i : array) {\n            System.out.print(i + \" \");\n        }\n        System.out.println();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **bubbleSort Method:**\n   - This method takes an array of integers as input and sorts it using the bubble sort algorithm.\n   - It uses two nested loops:\n     - The outer loop runs from the first element to the second-to-last element.\n     - The inner loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n   - This process repeats until the entire array is sorted.\n\n2. **printArray Method:**\n   - This method is used to print the elements of the array.\n   - It iterates through the array and prints each element.\n\n3. **main Method:**\n   - This is the entry point of the program.\n   - It initializes an array with some integers.\n   - Calls the `bubbleSort` method to sort the array.\n   - Prints the sorted array using the `printArray` method.\n\nThis program demonstrates a basic implementation of the bubble sort algorithm in Java. Bubble sort is simple but not efficient for large datasets due to its O(n^2) time complexity. For larger datasets, more efficient sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort are preferred."
