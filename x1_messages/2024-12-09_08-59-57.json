        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a box with 12 defective light bulbs and 18 non-defective ones, making a total of 30 light bulbs. We're picking 4 bulbs at random without replacement, and we want to find the probability that exactly 2 of them are defective.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for probability in combinations since we're dealing with selections without replacement. The general formula for probability is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} \\]\n\nIn this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose 4 bulbs out of 30. That can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total combinations} = \\binom{30}{4} \\]\n\nSimilarly, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose exactly 2 defective bulbs out of 12 and 2 non-defective bulbs out of 18. So, that would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Favorable combinations} = \\binom{12}{2} \\times \\binom{18}{2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability should be:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly 2 defective}) = \\frac{\\binom{12}{2} \\times \\binom{18}{2}}{\\binom{30}{4}} \\]\n\nNow, I need to compute these combinations. Let's recall that the combination formula is:\n\n\\[ \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!} \\]\n\nSo, let's calculate each part:\n\nFirst, \\(\\binom{12}{2}\\):\n\n\\[ \\binom{12}{2} = \\frac{12!}{2!(12 - 2)!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 10!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} = 66 \\]\n\nNext, \\(\\binom{18}{2}\\):\n\n\\[ \\binom{18}{2} = \\frac{18!}{2!(18 - 2)!} = \\frac{18 \\times 17 \\times 16!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 16!} = \\frac{18 \\times 17}{2} = 153 \\]\n\nThen, \\(\\binom{30}{4}\\):\n\n\\[ \\binom{30}{4} = \\frac{30!}{4!(30 - 4)!} = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28 \\times 27 \\times 26!}{24 \\times 23!} = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28 \\times 27}{24} \\]\n\nWait, actually, I think I made a mistake there. Let's correct that. The correct calculation for \\(\\binom{30}{4}\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\binom{30}{4} = \\frac{30!}{4!(30 - 4)!} = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28 \\times 27 \\times 26!}{24 \\times 26!} = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28 \\times 27}{24} \\]\n\nNow, computing the numerator:\n\n\\[ 30 \\times 29 = 870 \\]\n\n\\[ 870 \\times 28 = 24,360 \\]\n\n\\[ 24,360 \\times 27 = 657,720 \\]\n\nThen, divided by 24:\n\n\\[ \\frac{657,720}{24} = 27,405 \\]\n\nSo, \\(\\binom{30}{4} = 27,405 \\)\n\nNow, going back to the probability formula:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly 2 defective}) = \\frac{66 \\times 153}{27,405} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n\n\\[ 66 \\times 153 = 10,098 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly 2 defective}) = \\frac{10,098}{27,405} \\]\n\nNow, we can simplify this fraction. Let's see if both numbers can be divided by 3:\n\n10,098 \u00f7 3 = 3,366\n\n27,405 \u00f7 3 = 9,135\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n\\[ \\frac{10,098}{27,405} = \\frac{3,366}{9,135} \\]\n\nCan we simplify further? Let's check if both are divisible by 3 again:\n\n3,366 \u00f7 3 = 1,122\n\n9,135 \u00f7 3 = 3,045\n\nSo now:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3,366}{9,135} = \\frac{1,122}{3,045} \\]\n\nAgain, divisible by 3:\n\n1,122 \u00f7 3 = 374\n\n3,045 \u00f7 3 = 1,015\n\nSo now:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,122}{3,045} = \\frac{374}{1,015} \\]\n\nAre 374 and 1,015 divisible by any common number? Let's check for 11:\n\n374 \u00f7 11 = 34\n\n1,015 \u00f7 11 = 92.2727... not an integer, so not divisible by 11.\n\nCheck for 2: 374 is even, 1,015 is odd, so not divisible by 2.\n\nCheck for 5: 374 doesn't end with 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5.\n\nCheck for 7: 374 \u00f7 7 = 53.4286, not an integer; 1,015 \u00f7 7 = 145, which is an integer.\n\nSo, both are divisible by 7:\n\n374 \u00f7 7 = 53.4286, wait, that's not an integer. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nActually, 374 \u00f7 7 = 53.4286, which is not an integer, and 1,015 \u00f7 7 = 145, which is an integer. Since 374 is not divisible by 7, we cannot divide both numerator and denominator by 7.\n\nSo, the fraction \\(\\frac{374}{1,015}\\) is in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly 2 defective}) = \\frac{374}{1,015} \\]\n\nAlternatively, we can convert this to a decimal for a different perspective.\n\nCalculating 374 \u00f7 1,015 \u2248 0.368473 approximately.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.3685 or 36.85%.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify to round or give a decimal, I'll leave it as the fraction \\(\\frac{374}{1,015}\\).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check if there's any further simplification possible.\n\nLet's check for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 374 and 1,015.\n\nPrime factors of 374: 2 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 17\n\nPrime factors of 1,015: 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 29\n\nNo common prime factors, so indeed, \\(\\frac{374}{1,015}\\) is the simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{374}{1,015} \\]\n\nOr, if preferred, approximately 0.3685.\n\nSo, there's roughly a 36.85% chance that exactly 2 out of 4 randomly picked light bulbs are defective.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{374}{1015}} \\]"
