Right now, I'm sitting in a caf\u00e9 that shouldn't exist, sipping coffee that tastes nothing like it should, and trying to make sense of the mess I've created.\n\nRemember that case you were working on a few months ago? The one involving the theft of the Crown Jewels? Well, it turns out that solving that case wasn't just about catching a thief; it was about preventing a temporal anomaly that could have reshaped history as we know it.\n\nHere's what happened: In your eagerness to catch the culprit, you interviewed a witness who gave you a crucial piece of information. Only, that witness was none other than a time traveler from the future\u2014me. In our conversation, I\u2014well, you\u2014let slip some details about future technologies and events that weren't supposed to be known yet. It was unintentional, but the damage was done.\n\nAs a result, the timeline has shifted. Small changes at first\u2014different fashion trends, altered political landscapes\u2014but now, major historical events are beginning to unravel. The world is slipping into chaos, and it's all because of that one conversation.\n\nSo, here's what you need to do to set things right:\n\n1. **Forget Our Conversation:** Yes, it's meta, but you need to convince yourself that the information you received was incorrect or misleading. Discredit the witness in your own mind and proceed with the case based on the evidence you had before our talk.\n\n2. **Alter Your Approach:** Instead of relying on the tip from the witness, dig deeper into the security footage and forensic evidence. There must be another way to track down the thief without involving future knowledge.\n\n3. **Prevent Future Leaks:** Be more cautious about who you talk to and what you say. Time travel is real, and\u4e0d\u5c0f\u5fc3\u6cc4\u9732\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u540e\u679c\u3002\n\n4. **Seek Help if Needed:** If you find yourself stuck or if history starts to shift again, look for a way to contact me\u2014or rather, yourself\u2014in the future. We need to establish a protocol for handling temporal discrepancies.\n\nThis might sound far-fetched, but trust me, the alternative is far worse. The world needs to remain as we know it, or at least as close as possible.\n\nGood luck, and remember: the past is delicate. Handle with care.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour Future Self"
