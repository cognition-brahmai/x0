        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got 100 people in a room. First, 75% of them wear glasses. That means 75 people are wearing glasses. Next, 45% of them have brown hair, which is 45 people. And the important part is that everyone with brown hair wears glasses. So, all 45 people with brown hair are included in those 75 people who wear glasses.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the percentage of people wearing glasses who have brown hair. So, we need to find out what portion of the glass-wearers have brown hair.\n\nTo find this, I think I should divide the number of people who have both brown hair and wear glasses by the total number of people who wear glasses, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nSince everyone with brown hair wears glasses, the number of people who have both brown hair and wear glasses is exactly the number of people with brown hair, which is 45.\n\nSo, the calculation would be:\n\n( Number of people with brown hair and glasses ) / ( Total number of people wearing glasses ) * 100\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n45 / 75 * 100\n\nLet me do that math.\n\n45 divided by 75 is 0.6.\n\nThen, 0.6 multiplied by 100 is 60%.\n\nSo, 60% of the people wearing glasses have brown hair.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nWe have 75 people wearing glasses, and 45 of them have brown hair. So, 45 is indeed 60% of 75.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of sets. The set of people with brown hair is a subset of the set of people wearing glasses, since everyone with brown hair wears glasses.\n\nSo, the percentage of glass-wearers who have brown hair is the size of the brown-haired set divided by the size of the glass-wearing set, times 100.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, the answer should be 60%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60\\%} \\]"
