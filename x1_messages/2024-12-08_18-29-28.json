        "content": "So the factory produces 200 widgets in 8 hours. If it operates for 12 hours a day, how many widgets can it produce in one week of 7 days? Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the production rate per hour. If the factory produces 200 widgets in 8 hours, then the hourly production rate should be 200 divided by 8. That is:\n\n200 widgets / 8 hours = 25 widgets per hour\n\nSo, the factory produces 25 widgets each hour.\n\nNow, if the factory operates for 12 hours a day, the daily production would be the hourly rate multiplied by the number of hours in a day. That is:\n\n25 widgets/hour * 12 hours/day = 300 widgets per day\n\nSo, the factory can produce 300 widgets in one day.\n\nFinally, to find out the weekly production, I need to multiply the daily production by the number of days in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week:\n\n300 widgets/day * 7 days/week = 2100 widgets per week\n\nTherefore, the factory can produce 2100 widgets in one week if it operates for 12 hours a day.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to find out how many widgets are produced per hour, then calculate the total number of hours in a week the factory operates, and then multiply the two.\n\nWe already know the production rate is 25 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, if the factory operates 12 hours a day for 7 days, the total operating hours in a week would be:\n\n12 hours/day * 7 days/week = 84 hours per week\n\nThen, the total production in a week would be:\n\n25 widgets/hour * 84 hours/week = 2100 widgets per week\n\nOkay, that matches the previous calculation. So, 2100 widgets per week seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of proportions. If 8 hours lead to 200 widgets, then 12 hours should lead to (12/8) times 200 widgets per day.\n\nLet's see:\n\n(12/8) * 200 = (1.5) * 200 = 300 widgets per day\n\nThen, over 7 days, it would be 300 * 7 = 2100 widgets per week.\n\nAgain, the same result. So, I'm confident that 2100 widgets per week is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider? For example, are there maintenance breaks or downtime in the factory that might affect production? The problem doesn't mention any, so I can assume that the factory operates continuously during its operating hours without any breaks.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the production rate is constant, meaning that the factory produces widgets at a steady rate of 25 widgets per hour, without any fluctuations.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the factory can actually sustain the higher production rate if it's operating for longer hours. But since the problem states that the factory produces 200 widgets in 8 hours, and doesn't mention any limitations on extending the operating hours to 12 hours a day, I can assume that the production rate remains constant.\n\nMoreover, the problem doesn't provide any information about the factory's production capacity or any constraints that might be reached at higher operating hours. Therefore, I can proceed with the calculation as is.\n\nSo, in conclusion, if the factory operates for 12 hours a day for 7 days, it can produce 2100 widgets in one week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2100} \\]"
