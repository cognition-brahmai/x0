The Western Roman Empire officially ended in 476 AD when the last emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed by the Germanic king Odoacer. However, the decline had been ongoing for many years due to various factors such as economic troubles, political corruption, military overspending, and invasions by barbarian tribes. The Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire, survived for another thousand years until Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 AD."
