        "content": "So you're going on a road trip or something? Let's see if I can help you figure out how far you've traveled.\n\nFirst, you drove at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours. To find out how far you went in that time, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo for the first part:\n\nDistance\u2081 = 60 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 180 miles\n\nThat seems straightforward. Then, you increased your speed to 75 miles per hour and drove for another 2 hours. Let's use the same formula for this part:\n\nDistance\u2082 = 75 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 150 miles\n\nNow, to find the total distance traveled, I just need to add these two distances together:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance\u2081 + Distance\u2082 = 180 miles + 150 miles = 330 miles\n\nSo, you've traveled a total of 330 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider, like stops or traffic? The question doesn't mention anything about that, so I think assuming constant speeds for those time periods is fine.\n\nAlso, I should make sure about the units. The speed is given in miles per hour and time in hours, so miles are the appropriate unit for distance.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations:\n\n60 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 180 miles\n\n75 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 150 miles\n\n180 + 150 = 330 miles\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the total distance traveled is 330 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{330} \\]"
