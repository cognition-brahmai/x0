        "content": "In the depths where the moon's pale light\nDares not to penetrate the night,\nWhere the ocean's ancient heart doth beat,\nLies a tale both dark and sweet.\n\nMermaids, they say, in waters cold,\nWith voices soft as any toll,\nSing to sailors, luring them,\nTo their doom upon the foam.\n\nOnce, in a ship so grand and high,\nSailed a captain with a curious eye.\nHe heard the siren's mournful song,\nAnd was drawn like iron to a throng.\n\nTheir bodies glisten, scale by scale,\nHalf woman, half fish, most frail.\nTheir eyes, like stars in darkest sea,\nHeld secrets that could set men free.\n\nBut freedom's price is often steep,\nAs the captain soon did perceive.\nFor every word the mermaids sang,\nWas a thread from life's frail hang.\n\nHe tried to resist their haunting call,\nBut their beauty had cast a spell so tall.\nHis crew, once strong and bold and true,\nNow nothing but shadows in the blue.\n\nOne mermaid, more fair than the rest,\nHer name was Lyri, with a voice caressed.\nShe offered him immortality,\nIn exchange for his soul's purity.\n\n\"Take my hand,\" she whispered low,\n\"Join us in our underwater glow.\nForever young, forever mine,\nIn this realm where time does not align.\"\n\nBut the captain, though tempted sore,\nRecalled his life on lands he bore.\nHis wife, his child, his home so dear,\nWere ties no mermaid's song could ear.\n\nWith tears in his eyes, he made his choice,\nTurning away from eternaloice.\nAnd as he did, the mermaids' song\nTurned to wails of loss and wrong.\n\nThe sea grew turbulent, wild and free,\nAs if the ocean itself cried for glee.\nLyri reached out, her voice a plea,\n\"But you cannot escape me!\"\n\nShe cast a spell of storm and strife,\nTo make him hers, taking his life.\nBut the captain, though battered and beat,\nRefused to yield, though near his defeat.\n\nAt dawn, when the sun broke through the strife,\nThe mermaids vanished from sight and life.\nThe captain, alone on the vast sea,\nPledged to return to his family.\n\nFrom that day forward, sailors beware,\nOf the mermaids' song, oh so fair.\nFor in their depths, both beauty and dread,\nLie the choices that define the dead.\n\nSo hoist the sail, set the course aright,\nAnd pray for strength in the darkest night.\nFor some tales are told in sorrow's tone,\nLike the captain's choice, forever alone."
