        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. So, a palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). For example, \"madam\" is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\nTo implement a JavaScript function that checks if a given word is a palindrome, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Normalize the Input:** Convert the entire string to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive.\n2. **Remove Non-Alphabetic Characters:** Remove any spaces, punctuation, or special characters so that we're only comparing letters.\n3. **Compare the String with Its Reverse:** Check if the normalized string is the same as its reverse.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n### Step 1: Normalize the Input\n\nConverting the string to lowercase ensures that the function is case-insensitive. For example, \"Madam\" should be considered a palindrome, even though it has uppercase letters.\n\n### Step 2: Remove Non-Alphabetic Characters\n\nWe need to remove any characters that are not letters because palindromes are typically defined based on letters only. This includes spaces, punctuation marks, and numbers.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the String with Its Reverse\n\nOnce the string is normalized (lowercased and stripped of non-alphabetic characters), we can check if it reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nHere's a JavaScript function that implements these steps:\n\n```javascript\nfunction isPalindrome(word) {\n    // Step 1: Convert to lowercase\n    const lowerCaseWord = word.toLowerCase();\n    \n    // Step 2: Remove non-alphabetic characters\n    const cleanedWord = lowerCaseWord.replace(/[^a-zA-Z]/g, '');\n    \n    // Step 3: Check if the cleaned word is equal to its reverse\n    const reversedWord = cleanedWord.split('').reverse().join('');\n    return cleanedWord === reversedWord;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconsole.log(isPalindrome(\"madam\")); // true\nconsole.log(isPalindrome(\"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama\")); // true\nconsole.log(isPalindrome(\"hello\")); // false\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Normalization:** `word.toLowerCase()` converts the input string to lowercase.\n2. **Cleaning:** `lowerCaseWord.replace(/[^a-zA-Z]/g, '')` removes any character that is not a letter.\n3. **Reversing and Comparing:** `cleanedWord.split('').reverse().join('')` reverses the cleaned string, and then we check if it's equal to the original cleaned string.\n\nThis function should work for most cases, including phrases with spaces and punctuation, as it cleans the input to only consider letters and makes the comparison case-insensitive."
