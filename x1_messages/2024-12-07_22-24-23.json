They were pretty popular back in the day, known for their unique sound and those iconic music videos. Now, as for which Scandinavian country they're from, I believe it's Norway. Yeah, A-ha hails from Norway. I remember seeing their videos on MTV when I was a kid. The \"Take On Me\" video was groundbreaking with its animated style. It's fascinating how music from that era still resonates with people today. Do you have a favorite song by them?"
