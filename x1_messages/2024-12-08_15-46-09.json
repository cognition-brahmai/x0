        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 employees in total. 70% of them are full-time, and the remaining 30% are part-time. Full-time employees work 40 hours per week, and part-time employees work 20 hours per week. I need to find out the total number of hours worked by all employees in a week.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many employees are full-time and how many are part-time. Since 70% are full-time, that means 70% of 100 employees are full-time. So, 70% of 100 is calculated as:\n\n70/100 * 100 = 70 employees are full-time.\n\nSimilarly, the rest are part-time, which is 30% of 100 employees:\n\n30/100 * 100 = 30 employees are part-time.\n\nNow, full-time employees work 40 hours per week. So, the total hours worked by full-time employees are:\n\n70 employees * 40 hours/week = 2800 hours/week.\n\nPart-time employees work 20 hours per week. So, the total hours worked by part-time employees are:\n\n30 employees * 20 hours/week = 600 hours/week.\n\nTo find the total hours worked by all employees, I need to add the hours worked by full-time and part-time employees:\n\n2800 hours/week + 600 hours/week = 3400 hours/week.\n\nSo, the total number of hours worked by all employees in a week is 3400 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3400} \\]"
