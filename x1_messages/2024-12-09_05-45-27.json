Peter goes to the restroom, leaving his books unattended. Meanwhile, Laura accidentally spills her coffee on her own books and quickly tries to clean up the mess. She mistakenly takes one of Peter's books in the process. A librarian then comes by and re-shelves the misplaced book. When Peter returns, where will he look for his missing book?"

Peter steps away to the restroom, and while he's gone, Laura spills her coffee and hurriedly tries to clean up. In the process, she accidentally takes one of Peter's books, thinking it's hers. Then, a librarian comes by and shelves that misplaced book. When Peter comes back, he'll probably look for his missing book on his table or around his spot, since that's where he last had it. He might check if it's still there or if someone moved it by accident. Since the book is now on the shelf, he might eventually find it there, but initially, he'd likely look around his table and maybe ask Laura or the librarian if they've seen it. It's a bit of a mix-up!"
