        "content": "So I've got this problem here: at a party, every guest shakes hands with every other guest exactly once, and there were a total of 66 handshakes. I need to figure out how many guests were at the party. Hmm, this seems like a classic problem in combinatorics, but I'm a bit rusty on the formulas. Let's see if I can work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a bunch of guests at a party, and each one shakes hands with every other guest exactly once. So, if there are n guests, how many unique handshakes happen in total?\n\nI recall that in such scenarios, the number of handshakes is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, 2), meaning the number of ways to choose 2 guests out of n to shake hands. The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nIn this case, k is 2, since a handshake involves 2 people. So, the total number of handshakes is:\n\nC(n, 2) = n! / (2!(n - 2)!) = (n(n - 1)(n - 2)!)/(2*1*(n - 2)!)) = (n(n - 1))/2\n\nSo, the formula simplifies to n(n - 1)/2. And we're told that this equals 66:\n\nn(n - 1)/2 = 66\n\nNow, I need to solve for n. Let's multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\nn(n - 1) = 132\n\nSo, n\u00b2 - n - 132 = 0\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: n\u00b2 - n - 132 = 0\n\nI need to solve for n. I can either factor this equation or use the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first.\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to -132 and add up to -1. Hmm, let's see:\n\nPossible factor pairs of 132:\n\n1 and 132\n\n2 and 66\n\n3 and 44\n\n4 and 33\n\n6 and 22\n\n11 and 12\n\nNow, since I need numbers that multiply to -132 and add to -1, I can consider:\n\n12 and -11: 12 * -11 = -132, and 12 + (-11) = 1, which is not what I need.\n\nWait, I need the sum to be -1. So maybe -12 and 11: -12 * 11 = -132, and -12 + 11 = -1. That works.\n\nSo, I can factor the quadratic as:\n\n(n - 12)(n + 11) = 0\n\nSetting each factor to zero gives:\n\nn - 12 = 0 => n = 12\n\nn + 11 = 0 => n = -11\n\nBut n represents the number of guests, which can't be negative. So, n = 12.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this. Maybe I can use the quadratic formula to confirm.\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\nn = [1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 528)] / 2\n\nWait, let's compute the discriminant:\n\nb\u00b2 - 4ac = 1 - 4(1)(-132) = 1 + 528 = 529\n\n\u221a529 = 23\n\nSo, n = [1 \u00b1 23]/2\n\nn = (1 + 23)/2 = 24/2 = 12\n\nn = (1 - 23)/2 = -22/2 = -11\n\nAgain, n = 12 is the valid solution.\n\nAlternatively, I can plug n = 12 back into the handshake formula to verify:\n\nC(12, 2) = 12*11/2 = 66\n\nYes, that matches the given number of handshakes.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using sequences or something else.\n\nAnother approach could be to think of the handshakes as the sum of a sequence. The first guest shakes hands with n-1 guests, the second with n-2, and so on, until the last guest who doesn't shake hands with anyone because they've already shaken hands with everyone.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes is:\n\n(n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 + 0\n\nThis is the sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers, which is (n-1)n/2\n\nWait, that's the same as C(n, 2), which is what I had earlier.\n\nSo, again, (n-1)n/2 = 66\n\nWhich is the same equation I solved before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use trial and error, especially since n is likely to be a smallish number.\n\nLet's try n = 10:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10*9/2 = 45, which is less than 66.\n\nn = 11:\n\nC(11, 2) = 11*10/2 = 55, still less than 66.\n\nn = 12:\n\nC(12, 2) = 12*11/2 = 66, perfect.\n\nSo, n = 12 is confirmed.\n\nBut let's think about it another way. Maybe using recursion or some other method.\n\nSuppose I consider that each new guest added to the party will shake hands with all the existing guests.\n\nSo, if there are k guests already, the new guest will shake hands with k people.\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes is the sum of all k from k=1 to k=n-1.\n\nWait, that's again the sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers, which is (n-1)n/2, bringing me back to the same formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about it in terms of graph theory, where each guest is a vertex and each handshake is an edge.\n\nThen, the problem reduces to finding the number of vertices in a complete graph with 66 edges.\n\nThe formula for the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2, which again brings me back to the same equation.\n\nIt seems no matter which way I approach this, I end up with the same formula and solution.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the number of guests at the party is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
