        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Java program that interacts with AWS S3 using the SDK. I need to make it do three things: upload a local file to an S3 bucket, list all the objects in that bucket, and download a specific object from it. I'm pretty new to AWS SDK, so I'll need to look up some documentation and maybe follow some tutorials.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up my development environment. I'll need to have Java installed, and I think I'll use Maven to handle dependencies, especially for the AWS SDK. So, I should create a new Maven project.\n\nOnce that's set up, I need to add the AWS SDK for S3 to my project's dependencies. According to the AWS documentation, I can do this by adding the following to my pom.xml file:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>\n    <artifactId>s3</artifactId>\n    <version>2.17.92</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nI should check for the latest version on the AWS SDK for Java documentation page.\n\nNext, I need to configure AWS credentials. AWS SDK supports several ways to provide credentials, such as through environment variables, system properties, or by using the AWS Credentials Profile file. For simplicity, I might set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` as environment variables.\n\nNow, let's think about the program structure. I probably want a single Java class with methods to handle each of the required operations: upload, list, and download. Maybe I can have a main method that takes commands as arguments to decide which operation to perform.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline:\n\n- Class name: S3Operations\n\n- Methods:\n\n- `uploadFile(String localPath, String bucketName, String keyName)`\n\n- `listObjects(String bucketName)`\n\n- `downloadFile(String bucketName, String keyName, String localPath)`\n\nI need to handle exceptions properly, especially AWS service exceptions, and provide meaningful messages to the user.\n\nStarting with the upload functionality. I need to create an S3 client, then use its `putObject` method to upload the file. I'll need to provide the local file path, bucket name, and the key name (which is the name the file will have in the bucket).\n\nFor listing objects, I can use the `listObjectsV2` method of the S3 client, which returns a list of objects in the bucket. I should iterate through the results and print out the object keys.\n\nFor downloading, I'll use the `getObject` method, specifying the bucket name and key name, and save it to a local path.\n\nI should also consider pagination for listing objects if there are many items in the bucket.\n\nAnother thing to consider is error handling. For example, if the bucket doesn't exist, or if there are permission issues, I need to catch those exceptions and inform the user appropriately.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the program can be run from the command line, accepting necessary parameters like local file paths, bucket names, and object keys.\n\nLet me think about the main method. Maybe I can have it accept commands like \"upload\", \"list\", or \"download\", followed by the required arguments.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `java S3Operations upload /path/to/local/file bucketName s3KeyName`\n\n- `java S3Operations list bucketName`\n\n- `java S3Operations download bucketName s3KeyName /path/to/save/local/file`\n\nI need to parse these arguments in the main method and call the corresponding methods with the provided parameters.\n\nI should also add some validation to ensure that the correct number of arguments are provided for each command.\n\nLet me start by setting up the Maven project and adding the AWS SDK dependency.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Java program that interacts with AWS S3 to upload a local file to an S3 bucket, list all objects in the bucket, and download a specified object from the bucket, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **AWS Account and S3 Bucket**: Ensure you have an AWS account and an S3 bucket set up.\n2. **AWS Credentials**: Set up your AWS credentials (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key). You can set them as environment variables or use the AWS Credentials Profile file.\n3. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure JDK is installed on your machine.\n4. **Maven**: Use Maven to manage project dependencies.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nCreate a new Maven project and add the AWS SDK for S3 as a dependency in your `pom.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\"\n         xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n         xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    <groupId>com.example</groupId>\n    <artifactId>aws-s3-demo</artifactId>\n    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n    <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n            <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>\n            <artifactId>s3</artifactId>\n            <version>2.17.92</version>\n        </dependency>\n    </dependencies>\n</project>\n```\n\nCreate a Java class `S3Operations` with methods to upload, list, and download S3 objects:\n\n```java\nimport software.amazon.awssdk.core.async.ResponseTransformer;\nimport software.amazon.awssdk.regions.Region;\nimport software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3.S3Client;\nimport software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3.model.*;\nimport software.amazon.awssdk.core.sync.RequestBody;\nimport software.amazon.awssdk.core.sync.ResponseTransformer;\n\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.nio.file.Files;\nimport java.nio.file.Path;\nimport java.util.Iterator;\n\npublic class S3Operations {\n\n    private S3Client s3;\n\n    public S3Operations(Region region) {\n        this.s3 = S3Client.builder().region(region).build();\n    }\n\n    public void uploadFile(String localPath, String bucketName, String keyName) {\n        try {\n            File file = new File(localPath);\n            s3.putObject(PutObjectRequest.builder()\n                    .bucket(bucketName)\n                    .key(keyName)\n                    .build(),\n                    RequestBody.fromFile(file));\n            System.out.println(\"Upload successful\");\n        } catch (S3Exception e) {\n            System.err.println(e.awsErrorDetails().errorMessage());\n            System.exit(1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void listObjects(String bucketName) {\n        try {\n            ListObjectsV2Request req = ListObjectsV2Request.builder()\n                    .bucket(bucketName)\n                    .build();\n\n            ListObjectsV2Iterable response = s3.listObjectsV2Paginator(req);\n\n            for (ListObjectsV2Response listResponse : response) {\n                for (S3Object object : listResponse.contents()) {\n                    System.out.println(object.key());\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (S3Exception e) {\n            System.err.println(e.awsErrorDetails().errorMessage());\n            System.exit(1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void downloadFile(String bucketName, String keyName, String localPath) {\n        try {\n            s3.getObject(GetObjectRequest.builder()\n                            .bucket(bucketName)\n                            .key(keyName)\n                            .build(),\n                    ResponseTransformer.toFile(Path.of(localPath)));\n            System.out.println(\"Download successful\");\n        } catch (S3Exception | IOException e) {\n            System.err.println(e.getMessage());\n            System.exit(1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        if (args.length < 2) {\n            System.err.println(\"Usage: java S3Operations [upload|list|download] [arguments]\");\n            System.exit(1);\n        }\n\n        String command = args[0];\n        Region region = Region.US_EAST_1; // Set your desired region\n        S3Operations ops = new S3Operations(region);\n\n        switch (command.toLowerCase()) {\n            case \"upload\":\n                if (args.length != 4) {\n                    System.err.println(\"Usage: java S3Operations upload /path/to/local/file bucketName s3KeyName\");\n                    System.exit(1);\n                }\n                String localPath = args[1];\n                String bucketName = args[2];\n                String keyName = args[3];\n                ops.uploadFile(localPath, bucketName, keyName);\n                break;\n            case \"list\":\n                if (args.length != 2) {\n                    System.err.println(\"Usage: java S3Operations list bucketName\");\n                    System.exit(1);\n                }\n                String bucket = args[1];\n                ops.listObjects(bucket);\n                break;\n            case \"download\":\n                if (args.length != 4) {\n                    System.err.println(\"Usage: java S3Operations download bucketName s3KeyName /path/to/save/local/file\");\n                    System.exit(1);\n                }\n                String bucketNameDownload = args[1];\n                String keyNameDownload = args[2];\n                String localPathDownload = args[3];\n                ops.downloadFile(bucketNameDownload, keyNameDownload, localPathDownload);\n                break;\n            default:\n                System.err.println(\"Invalid command. Use upload, list, or download.\");\n                System.exit(1);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Instructions\n\n1. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:\n   - Ensure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them as environment variables:\n     ```sh\n     export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key\n     export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key\n     ```\n\n2. **Compile the Project**:\n   - Run `mvn clean package` to compile and package the project.\n\n3. **Run the Program**:\n   - Use the following commands based on the operation:\n     - **Upload**:\n       ```sh\n       java -cp target/aws-s3-demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.S3Operations upload /path/to/local/file bucketName s3KeyName\n       ```\n     - **List Objects**:\n       ```sh\n       java -cp target/aws-s3-demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.S3Operations list bucketName\n       ```\n     - **Download**:\n       ```sh\n       java -cp target/aws-s3-demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.S3Operations download bucketName s3KeyName /path/to/save/local/file\n       ```\n\nReplace `com.example` with your actual package name if different. This program provides a straightforward way to perform basic S3 operations using the AWS SDK for Java."
