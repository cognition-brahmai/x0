        "content": "So, in this class, there are 20 students in total\u201412 boys and 8 girls. Half of the boys wear glasses, and one-third of the girls wear glasses. I need to find out how many students don't wear glasses.\n\nFirst, I'll figure out how many boys wear glasses. Since there are 12 boys and half of them wear glasses, that means 12 divided by 2, which is 6 boys wear glasses.\n\nNext, for the girls, there are 8 girls and one-third of them wear glasses. So, one-third of 8 is 8 divided by 3, which is approximately 2.666, but since we're dealing with people, it should be a whole number. Wait, 8 divided by 3 is actually 2 with a remainder of 2, but in terms of fractions, it's 8/3, which is 2 and 2/3. However, people can't be fractions, so maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that one-third of 8 is exactly 8/3, which is 2 and 2/3, but since we can't have a fraction of a person, maybe the problem expects us to round or consider only whole numbers. Maybe it's assumed that exactly 2 girls wear glasses, ignoring the fraction, or perhaps 3, but that wouldn't make sense because 8 divided by 3 is not a whole number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to interpret one-third as exactly 8/3, but since we can't have partial people, perhaps the scenario isn't meant to be taken with real numbers, but still, it's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the class has been described with numbers that don't quite fit perfectly, but probably the intent is that exactly 2 girls wear glasses, since 8 divided by 3 is 2 with a remainder of 2.\n\nSo, proceeding with that, 2 girls wear glasses.\n\nNow, the total number of students who wear glasses is the number of boys who wear glasses plus the number of girls who wear glasses, which is 6 + 2 = 8 students wear glasses.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who do not wear glasses is the total number of students minus those who wear glasses, which is 20 - 8 = 12 students.\n\nWait a minute, but earlier there was confusion about the number of girls wearing glasses. If one-third of 8 is not a whole number, perhaps the problem is hypothetical, or perhaps there's a mistake in the numbers provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the class has only 2 girls wearing glasses, and the remaining 6 girls do not wear glasses.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- 6 boys wear glasses\n\n- 2 girls wear glasses\n\n- Total wearing glasses: 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- Total not wearing glasses: 20 - 8 = 12\n\nTherefore, 12 students do not wear glasses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
