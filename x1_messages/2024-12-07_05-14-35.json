        "content": "So the factory produces 10,000 plastic bottles every day, and each bottle weighs 50 grams. It operates for 300 days a year. We need to find out how many metric tons of plastic it uses in a year.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the total number of bottles produced in a year. Since it produces 10,000 bottles per day and operates for 300 days, we can multiply these two numbers:\n\nTotal bottles per year = 10,000 bottles/day * 300 days/year\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n10,000 * 300 = 3,000,000 bottles/year\n\nSo, 3 million bottles are produced each year.\n\nNext, each bottle weighs 50 grams. To find the total weight, we need to multiply the number of bottles by the weight per bottle:\n\nTotal weight = 3,000,000 bottles * 50 grams/bottle\n\nLet's do the math:\n\n3,000,000 * 50 = 150,000,000 grams\n\nThat's 150 million grams.\n\nBut we need the weight in metric tons. I know that 1 metric ton equals 1,000 kilograms, and 1 kilogram equals 1,000 grams. So, 1 metric ton equals 1,000,000 grams.\n\nTo convert grams to metric tons, we divide the total grams by 1,000,000:\n\nMetric tons = 150,000,000 grams / 1,000,000 grams/metric ton\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n150,000,000 / 1,000,000 = 150 metric tons\n\nSo, the factory uses 150 metric tons of plastic annually.\n\nWait a minute, does that sound right? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 10,000 bottles/day * 300 days/year = 3,000,000 bottles/year.\n\nThen, 3,000,000 bottles * 50 grams/bottle = 150,000,000 grams.\n\nNow, converting grams to metric tons: 150,000,000 grams / 1,000,000 grams/metric ton = 150 metric tons.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the weight per bottle to kilograms first. Since 1 kilogram = 1,000 grams, 50 grams is equal to 0.05 kilograms.\n\nSo, total weight in kilograms would be:\n\n3,000,000 bottles * 0.05 kg/bottle = 150,000 kg\n\nAnd since 1 metric ton = 1,000 kg, then:\n\n150,000 kg / 1,000 kg/metric ton = 150 metric tons\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of daily production and then annual production.\n\nDaily plastic use: 10,000 bottles * 50 grams/bottle = 500,000 grams or 500 kilograms.\n\nAnnual plastic use: 500 kg/day * 300 days/year = 150,000 kg, which is 150 metric tons.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 150 metric tons is the correct annual plastic usage for the factory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
