        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here. There's a group of people, and we know that 65% have brown eyes and 35% have blue eyes. Then, among those with brown eyes, 40% wear glasses, and among those with blue eyes, 70% wear glasses. I need to find out, if I pick someone at random who wears glasses, what's the probability that they have brown eyes.\n\nOkay, so this seems like a conditional probability problem. I think I should use Bayes' theorem here. But let me make sure I understand all the parts.\n\nFirst, let's define the events:\n\n- Let B be the event that a person has brown eyes.\n\n- Let Blu be the event that a person has blue eyes.\n\n- Let G be the event that a person wears glasses.\n\nSo, we are given:\n\n- P(B) = 0.65\n\n- P(Blu) = 0.35\n\n- P(G|B) = 0.40\n\n- P(G|Blu) = 0.70\n\nAnd we need to find P(B|G), the probability that a person has brown eyes given that they wear glasses.\n\nBayes' theorem states that:\n\nP(B|G) = [P(G|B) * P(B)] / P(G)\n\nSo, I need to find P(G), the total probability of wearing glasses.\n\nTo find P(G), I can use the law of total probability:\n\nP(G) = P(G|B) * P(B) + P(G|Blu) * P(Blu)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(G) = (0.40 * 0.65) + (0.70 * 0.35)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 0.40 * 0.65 = 0.26\n\nThen, 0.70 * 0.35 = 0.245\n\nSo, P(G) = 0.26 + 0.245 = 0.505\n\nNow, plug back into Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(B|G) = (0.40 * 0.65) / 0.505 = 0.26 / 0.505\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.26 / 0.505 \u2248 0.51485\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.515 or 51.5%.\n\nWait a minute, does this make sense? Let's see.\n\nThere are more people with brown eyes, but a lower percentage of them wear glasses compared to those with blue eyes. So, even though there are more brown-eyed people wearing glasses, the higher proportion of blue-eyed people wearing glasses might make up for it.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Suppose there are 100 people in the group.\n\n- 65 have brown eyes\n\n- 35 have blue eyes\n\nAmong the brown-eyed people:\n\n- 40% wear glasses: 0.40 * 65 = 26 people\n\nAmong the blue-eyed people:\n\n- 70% wear glasses: 0.70 * 35 \u2248 24.5, say 25 people (since we can't have half a person, but I'll keep it as 24.5 for accuracy)\n\nSo, total number of people wearing glasses: 26 + 24.5 = 50.5\n\nNow, the probability that a glass-wearer has brown eyes is the number of brown-eyed glass-wearers divided by the total number of glass-wearers:\n\n26 / 50.5 \u2248 0.51485, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, approximately 51.5%.\n\nWait, but I feel like I should double-check this. Maybe I can use another approach to confirm.\n\nLet me try using the concept of conditional probability directly.\n\nWe know that P(B|G) = P(B and G) / P(G)\n\nWe already have P(G) = 0.505\n\nP(B and G) is the probability of having brown eyes and wearing glasses, which is P(G|B) * P(B) = 0.40 * 0.65 = 0.26\n\nSo, P(B|G) = 0.26 / 0.505 \u2248 0.51485\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use odds.\n\nThe odds of having brown eyes versus blue eyes among glass-wearers can be found by:\n\n(Odds of B|G) = [P(G|B) / P(G|Blu)] * [P(B)/P(Blu)]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n= (0.40 / 0.70) * (0.65 / 0.35)\n\n= (4/7) * (65/35)\n\n= (4/7) * (13/7)\n\n= 52 / 49\n\nNow, the probability P(B|G) = Odds / (1 + Odds)\n\nSo, P(B|G) = (52 / 49) / (1 + 52 / 49) = (52 / 49) / (101 / 49) = 52 / 101 \u2248 0.51485\n\nOnce again, the same result.\n\nI think it's consistent across different methods, so I can be confident that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.51485} \\]"
