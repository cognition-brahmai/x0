        "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you categorize these architectural styles. Each of these styles has unique characteristics and historical contexts that set them apart.\n\n1. **Gothic Architecture**: This style emerged in the mid-12th century in France and lasted until the 16th century. It's known for its pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses, which allowed for taller, more spacious buildings with large windows. Gothic architecture is often associated with cathedrals and churches, such as Notre-Dame in Paris and Chartres Cathedral.\n\n2. **Baroque Architecture**: Baroque emerged in the late 16th century in Italy and spread across Europe through the 17th and early 18th centuries. It's characterized by grandeur, drama, and rich ornamentation. Baroque buildings often feature curved forms, illusory effects, and a combination of painting, sculpture, and architecture. Examples include St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City and the Palace of Versailles in France.\n\n3. **Modernist Architecture**: This style emerged in the early 20th century and is characterized by a departure from traditional architectural styles. Modernist architects sought to create functional, minimalist structures that reflected the spirit of the modern age. Key features include open floor plans, the use of new materials like steel and concrete, and an emphasis on form following function. Famous modernist buildings include the Farnsworth House by Mies van der Rohe and the Villa Savoye by Le Corbusier.\n\n4. **Brutalist Architecture**: Brutalism emerged in the mid-20th century and is known for its raw, unadorned concrete surfaces and massive forms. The term \"brutal\" comes from the French word \"beton brut,\" meaning raw concrete. Brutalist buildings often feature exposed structural elements and a lack of ornamentation. Examples include the Barbican Centre in London and the Boston City Hall.\n\n5. **Neoclassical Architecture**: Neoclassicism developed in the 18th century as a reaction against the ornate Baroque and Rococo styles. It drew inspiration from the classical architecture of ancient Greece and Rome, featuring symmetrical designs, columns, and pediments. Neoclassical buildings often convey a sense of dignity and rationality. Examples include the White House in Washington, D.C., and the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.\n\nEach of these styles reflects the cultural, social, and artistic trends of their respective periods, and they continue to influence architectural design today."
