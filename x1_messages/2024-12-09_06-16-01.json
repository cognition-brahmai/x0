        "content": "So there's this problem here about a class of students and their handedness. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nWe have a class of 40 students, and 25% of them are left-handed. First, I need to find out how many students that is. To find 25% of 40, I can calculate 0.25 times 40.\n\n0.25 \u00d7 40 = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 left-handed students in the class initially.\n\nNow, the problem says that 5 more left-handed students join the class. So, the number of left-handed students will increase by 5.\n\n10 + 5 = 15\n\nSo, there will be 15 left-handed students.\n\nBut, since new students are joining, the total number of students in the class will also increase. Originally, there are 40 students, and 5 more join, so:\n\n40 + 5 = 45\n\nNow, the class has 45 students in total, out of which 15 are left-handed.\n\nThe question is asking for the new percentage of left-handed students in the class. To find the percentage, I need to divide the number of left-handed students by the total number of students and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nSo, percentage of left-handed students = (number of left-handed students / total number of students) \u00d7 100\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n(15 / 45) \u00d7 100\n\nFirst, 15 divided by 45 is 0.333..., and multiplying that by 100 gives 33.333...%\n\nSo, the percentage of left-handed students in the class after the new students join is approximately 33.3%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach this differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the ratio of left-handed students to the total number of students after the new students join.\n\nInitially, there are 10 left-handed students out of 40. After adding 5 left-handed students, there are 15 left-handed students out of 45 total students.\n\nSo, the ratio is 15:45, which simplifies to 1:3.\n\n1:3 means that for every 3 students, 1 is left-handed. To find the percentage, since percentage is per hundred, I can set up a proportion:\n\n1/3 = x/100\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = (1/3) \u00d7 100 = 33.333...\n\nSo, again, it's approximately 33.3%.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of decimals. 15 divided by 45 is 0.333..., which is recurring. Multiplying by 100 gives 33.333...%, which rounds to 33.3%.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. The problem states that 25% of the original 40 students are left-handed, which we've calculated as 10 students. Then, 5 more left-handed students join, making it 15 left-handed students, and the total number of students becomes 45.\n\nThe percentage of left-handed students is then (15/45) \u00d7 100 = 33.3%.\n\nI don't see any other way to interpret this. It seems straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if the 5 new students are all left-handed, as the problem says \"5 more left-handed students join.\" Yes, that's clear.\n\nSo, no ambiguity there.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that approximately 33.3% of the class will be left-handed after the new students join.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33.\\overline{3}\\%} \\]\n\n**Explanation**\n\n1. Calculate the initial number of left-handed students:\n   \\[\n   25\\% \\text{ of } 40 = 0.25 \\times 40 = 10\n   \\]\n2. Add the new left-handed students:\n   \\[\n   10 + 5 = 15\n   \\]\n3. Calculate the new total number of students:\n   \\[\n   40 + 5 = 45\n   \\]\n4. Determine the new percentage of left-handed students:\n   \\[\n   \\left( \\frac{15}{45} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 33.\\overline{3}\\%\n   \\]"
