        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a jar with 4 red marbles, 3 green marbles, and 5 blue marbles. So, total marbles in the jar are 4 + 3 + 5, which is 12 marbles.\n\nThe task is to pick two marbles without replacement and find the probability that exactly one of them is red. Okay, so without replacement means that once I pick the first marble, it stays out, and the second marble is picked from the remaining marbles.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"exactly one red marble\" means. It means that out of the two marbles I pick, one is red and the other is not red. So, it could be red first and then not red, or not red first and then red.\n\nProbably, the easiest way to approach this is to calculate the probability of each scenario and then add them up.\n\nSo, let's consider the first scenario: picking a red marble first and then a non-red marble.\n\nThe probability of picking a red marble first is the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles, which is 4 red out of 12 total, so 4/12 or 1/3.\n\nAfter picking one red marble, there are now 11 marbles left in the jar, and among them, there are 3 red marbles left (since we picked one already), and 8 non-red marbles (3 green + 5 blue).\n\nWait, no. Wait a minute. Originally, there were 4 red, 3 green, and 5 blue, totaling 12. After picking one red, there are 3 red left, and the non-red remain 3 green + 5 blue = 8 non-red.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a non-red marble second, given that the first was red, is 8/11.\n\nTherefore, the probability of first red and then non-red is (1/3) * (8/11) = 8/33.\n\nNow, the second scenario: picking a non-red marble first and then a red marble.\n\nThe probability of picking a non-red marble first is the number of non-red marbles divided by the total number of marbles. There are 3 green + 5 blue = 8 non-red marbles out of 12, so 8/12 or 2/3.\n\nAfter picking one non-red marble, there are now 11 marbles left, and among them, there are still 4 red marbles (since we didn't pick a red one first), and 7 non-red marbles (since we picked one non-red already).\n\nWait, wait. Originally, 4 red, 3 green, 5 blue = 12. If I pick one non-red first, say a green one, then I have 4 red, 2 green, and 5 blue left, totaling 11. So, the number of red marbles remains 4, and non-red are now 7.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a red marble second, given that the first was non-red, is 4/11.\n\nSo, the probability of first non-red and then red is (2/3) * (4/11) = 8/33.\n\nNow, since these two scenarios are mutually exclusive (either first red then non-red, or first non-red then red), I can add their probabilities to get the total probability of picking exactly one red marble.\n\nSo, total probability = 8/33 + 8/33 = 16/33.\n\nWait, but I should check if this is correct. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way is to use combinations. Since we're picking two marbles without replacement, the total number of ways to pick 2 marbles out of 12 is C(12,2), which is 12 choose 2.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to pick exactly one red marble is the number of ways to pick 1 red out of 4 and 1 non-red out of 8, which is C(4,1) * C(8,1).\n\nTherefore, the probability is [C(4,1) * C(8,1)] / C(12,2).\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nC(4,1) = 4\n\nC(8,1) = 8\n\nC(12,2) = 66\n\nSo, [4 * 8] / 66 = 32 / 66 = 16 / 33.\n\nOkay, that matches the previous result. So, the probability is 16/33.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can consider another approach.\n\nLet's think about the probability of picking two marbles where exactly one is red.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate 1 minus the probability of picking two red marbles minus the probability of picking two non-red marbles.\n\nSo, probability of exactly one red = 1 - P(two red) - P(two non-red).\n\nFirst, P(two red): number of ways to pick 2 red marbles out of 4 is C(4,2) = 6.\n\nTotal ways to pick any two marbles is C(12,2) = 66.\n\nSo, P(two red) = 6/66 = 1/11.\n\nP(two non-red): number of ways to pick 2 non-red marbles out of 8 is C(8,2) = 28.\n\nSo, P(two non-red) = 28/66 = 14/33.\n\nTherefore, P(exactly one red) = 1 - 1/11 - 14/33.\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nFirst, 1 - 1/11 = 10/11.\n\nThen, 10/11 - 14/33.\n\nTo subtract these, need a common denominator, which is 33.\n\n10/11 = 30/33.\n\n30/33 - 14/33 = 16/33.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I end up with 16/33.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking exactly one red marble is 16/33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{16}{33}} \\]"
