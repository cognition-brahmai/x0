        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a new roller coaster in an amusement park, and we need to figure out how many visitors can ride it each day and how much money the park can make from it.\n\nFirst, we need to know how many runs the roller coaster can do in a day. The ride takes 3 minutes per run, and it's going to operate for 12 hours a day. So, let's convert those hours into minutes to make it easier to calculate.\n\n12 hours \u00d7 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes per day.\n\nNow, each run takes 3 minutes, so the number of runs per day would be:\n\n720 minutes per day \u00f7 3 minutes per run = 240 runs per day.\n\nNext, we know that the roller coaster has a maximum capacity of 24 passengers per run. So, the total number of passengers per day would be:\n\n240 runs per day \u00d7 24 passengers per run = 5,760 passengers per day.\n\nNow, each ticket for the ride costs $5 per person. So, the potential revenue per day would be:\n\n5,760 passengers per day \u00d7 $5 per passenger = $28,800 per day.\n\nWait a minute, does that seem right? Let's double-check our calculations.\n\nFirst, 12 hours of operation per day, with each run taking 3 minutes.\n\n720 minutes per day divided by 3 minutes per run equals 240 runs per day. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 240 runs per day times 24 passengers per run equals 5,760 passengers per day. That also seems correct.\n\nFinally, 5,760 passengers per day times $5 per passenger equals $28,800 per day. That sounds like a lot, but given the high capacity and the number of runs, it might be accurate.\n\nBut let's think about it differently to confirm. If the roller coaster can carry 24 passengers every 3 minutes, that's 24 passengers every 3 minutes.\n\nSo, in one minute, the number of passengers would be 24 passengers / 3 minutes = 8 passengers per minute.\n\nOver 12 hours, which is 720 minutes, the total number of passengers would be 8 passengers per minute \u00d7 720 minutes = 5,760 passengers per day.\n\nThat matches our earlier calculation.\n\nNow, multiplying that by $5 per passenger gives us $28,800 per day.\n\nHmm, is there anything else we should consider? For example, is there a break time between runs, or any downtime for maintenance? The problem says the ride operates at full capacity for 12 hours per day, so I guess we can assume it's running continuously during those 12 hours.\n\nAlso, we should make sure that the park can actually handle 5,760 visitors per day on this single ride. But since the problem states that the ride will operate at full capacity, we can assume that there are enough visitors to fill all the runs.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether all visitors are paying just for this ride or if they are paying for\u5165\u56ed\u8d39 that includes multiple rides. However, the problem specifies that the ticket price is $5 per person for this ride, so perhaps it's an additional fee on top of the entrance ticket.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't provide details about that, we can proceed with the given information.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the number of visitors who can experience the ride daily is 5,760, and the potential revenue generated from this ride is $28,800 per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe number of visitors who can experience the ride daily is \\boxed{5760}, and the potential revenue generated from this ride is \\boxed{28800} dollars per day.\n"
