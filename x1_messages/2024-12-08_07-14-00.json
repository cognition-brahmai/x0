        "content": "Harper Lee, born Nelle Harper Lee, is the American author who wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" Published in 1960, the book is renowned for its portrayal of racial injustice in the American South and has become a classic in modern literature. The novel is set in Lee's hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, during the Great Depression and is narrated by a young girl named Scout Finch. Through her eyes, readers witness the moral growth and the complexities of human nature as her father, Atticus Finch, defends a black man falsely accused of rape.\n\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" has had a profound impact on American culture and education. It is widely taught in schools and continues to be celebrated for its themes of compassion, tolerance, and the destruction of innocence. Harper Lee's only other published book, \"Go Set a Watchman,\" was released in 2015 and is considered a predecessor to \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" offering insights into the characters' lives years after the events of the first novel."
