        "content": "So I've got this game here, and I need to figure out the expected value for playing it. Let me see if I understand what's being asked. There's a 50% chance I win $100, and a 50% chance I lose $50. Expected value is like, on average, how much I can expect to gain or lose per play, right?\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to recall the formula for expected value. I think it's the sum of each possible outcome multiplied by its probability. So, for this game, there are two possible outcomes: winning $100 with a probability of 50%, and losing $50 with a probability of 50%.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nExpected Value (EV) = (Probability of Winning \u00d7 Amount Won) + (Probability of Losing \u00d7 Amount Lost)\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nEV = (0.5 \u00d7 $100) + (0.5 \u00d7 (-$50))\n\nWait, losing $50 would be a negative amount, right? Yeah, because it's money going out.\n\nSo, EV = (0.5 \u00d7 100) + (0.5 \u00d7 (-50)) = 50 + (-25) = 25\n\nSo, the expected value is $25. That means, on average, I can expect to gain $25 per game played. Does that make sense?\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. 0.5 times 100 is 50, and 0.5 times -50 is -25. Adding those together gives 25. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, maybe I should consider the concept in a different way. Suppose I play this game many times, say 100 times. According to the probabilities, roughly half of the times I'll win $100, and the other half I'll lose $50.\n\nSo, in 50 wins: 50 \u00d7 $100 = $5,000\n\nIn 50 losses: 50 \u00d7 (-$50) = -$2,500\n\nTotal outcome: $5,000 - $2,500 = $2,500\n\nAverage per game: $2,500 / 100 = $25\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, expected value is indeed $25.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using the concept of mean or something. Well, expected value is similar to the mean in probability theory.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the average outcome over many trials, which is what I just did.\n\nI think I've got it. The expected value for playing this game is $25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
