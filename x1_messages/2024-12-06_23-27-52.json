        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! To create a Node.js script that reads a JSON file containing employee data and calculates the average age per department, we'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up the project**: Initialize a new Node.js project and install any necessary dependencies.\n2. **Read the JSON file**: Use Node's file system module to read the JSON file.\n3. **Parse the data**: Convert the JSON string into a JavaScript object.\n4. **Process the data**: Calculate the average age for each department.\n5. **Output the results**: Log the results to the console or write them to a new file.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Project\n\nFirst, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can check this by running:\n\n```bash\nnode -v\n```\n\nIf Node.js is not installed, download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).\n\nCreate a new directory for your project and navigate into it:\n\n```bash\nmkdir employee-age-avg\ncd employee-age-avg\n```\n\nInitialize a new Node.js project:\n\n```bash\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nThis will create a `package.json` file with default settings.\n\n### Step 2: Read the JSON File\n\nNode.js has a built-in module called `fs` (file system) that allows reading files. We'll use it to read the JSON file.\n\nFirst, create a sample JSON file named `employees.json` in your project directory with the following content:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"department\": \"HR\"},\n  {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25, \"department\": \"IT\"},\n  {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 35, \"department\": \"HR\"},\n  {\"name\": \"David\", \"age\": 28, \"department\": \"IT\"},\n  {\"name\": \"Eve\", \"age\": 22, \"department\": \"IT\"}\n]\n```\n\nNow, in your script, you can read this file using `fs.readFileSync` or `fs.promises.readFile`. For simplicity, we'll use the synchronous version.\n\n### Step 3: Parse the Data\n\nOnce the file is read, the content is a string that needs to be parsed into a JavaScript object using `JSON.parse()`.\n\n### Step 4: Process the Data\n\nWe need to group employees by their department and calculate the average age for each group.\n\n### Step 5: Output the Results\n\nFinally, log the results to the console or write them to a new JSON file.\n\n### Complete Script\n\nHere's the complete Node.js script that accomplishes all of the above:\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\n// Step 2: Read the JSON file\nconst data = fs.readFileSync('employees.json', 'utf8');\n\n// Step 3: Parse the data\nconst employees = JSON.parse(data);\n\n// Step 4: Process the data\nconst departmentAges = {};\n\nemployees.forEach(employee => {\n  const { department, age } = employee;\n  if (!departmentAges[department]) {\n    departmentAges[department] = { totalAge: 0, count: 0 };\n  }\n  departmentAges[department].totalAge += age;\n  departmentAges[department].count++;\n});\n\nconst departmentAvgs = {};\nfor (const department in departmentAges) {\n  const { totalAge, count } = departmentAges[department];\n  departmentAvgs[department] = totalAge / count;\n}\n\n// Step 5: Output the results\nconsole.log('Average ages per department:', departmentAvgs);\n\n// Optionally, write the results to a new JSON file\nfs.writeFileSync('department_avgs.json', JSON.stringify(departmentAvgs, null, 2));\nconsole.log('Results written to department_avgs.json');\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading the File**: We use `fs.readFileSync` to read the `employees.json` file synchronously.\n2. **Parsing JSON**: The read data is parsed into a JavaScript array of objects using `JSON.parse`.\n3. **Processing Data**: We iterate over each employee, grouping their ages by department. We maintain a running total of ages and count of employees per department.\n4. **Calculating Averages**: For each department, we calculate the average age by dividing the total age by the number of employees.\n5. **Outputting Results**: We log the average ages to the console and also write them to a new JSON file named `department_avgs.json`.\n\nThis script should give you the average age of employees in each department as required.
