        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a group of 40 people, and we're told that 25 like coffee, 15 like tea, and 5 like both coffee and tea. We need to find out how many people like neither coffee nor tea.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many people like either coffee or tea or both. To do that, I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The formula for the number of people who like either coffee or tea is:\n\nNumber liking coffee or tea = Number liking coffee + Number liking tea - Number liking both\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber liking coffee or tea = 25 + 15 - 5 = 35\n\nSo, 35 people like either coffee or tea or both.\n\nNow, since there are 40 people in total, the number of people who like neither coffee nor tea would be:\n\nTotal people - Number liking coffee or tea = 40 - 35 = 5\n\nTherefore, 5 people like neither coffee nor tea.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If 25 like coffee and 15 like tea, but 5 like both, then indeed, 35 people like at least one of them. So, yes, 40 minus 35 is 5.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of sets. Let\u2019s say set C is the set of people who like coffee, and set T is the set of people who like tea. We\u2019re given:\n\n- |C| = 25\n\n- |T| = 15\n\n- |C \u2229 T| = 5\n\nWe need to find the number of people who are not in set C or T, which is the complement of C union T.\n\nFirst, find |C \u222a T| = |C| + |T| - |C \u2229 T| = 25 + 15 - 5 = 35\n\nThen, the number of people who like neither is the total number of people minus those who like at least one of them:\n\n40 - |C \u222a T| = 40 - 35 = 5\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the Venn diagram. If 5 people like both coffee and tea, then the number who like only coffee is 25 - 5 = 20, and the number who like only tea is 15 - 5 = 10. So, the total number who like either or both is 20 + 10 + 5 = 35. Again, 40 - 35 = 5 people like neither.\n\nI think this is straightforward. The answer should be 5 people like neither coffee nor tea.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
