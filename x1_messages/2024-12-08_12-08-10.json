        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces 500 widgets per day. Each widget has to go through three quality control stations: A, B, and C. At each station, some widgets get rejected based on the percentages given. We need to find out how many widgets make it through all three stations and are approved for shipment.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's happening at each station.\n\n- Station A rejects 10% of the widgets.\n\n- Station B rejects 15% of the widgets.\n\n- Station C rejects 20% of the widgets.\n\nI need to find out how many widgets are approved at each station and then see how many make it through all three.\n\nLet's start with Station A.\n\nStation A rejects 10% of the widgets, which means that 90% are approved.\n\nSo, out of 500 widgets:\n\nApproved by Station A = 90% of 500 = 0.9 * 500 = 450 widgets.\n\nNow, these 450 widgets move on to Station B.\n\nStation B rejects 15% of the widgets, so 85% are approved.\n\nApproved by Station B = 85% of 450 = 0.85 * 450.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.85 * 450 = 382.5.\n\nHmm, we can't have half a widget, but since this is a theoretical calculation, I'll keep the decimal for now.\n\nSo, 382.5 widgets move on to Station C.\n\nAt Station C, 20% are rejected, which means 80% are approved.\n\nApproved by Station C = 80% of 382.5 = 0.8 * 382.5.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n0.8 * 382.5 = 306.\n\nSo, according to this, 306 widgets are approved by all three stations and are ready for shipment.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 500 widgets.\n\nAfter Station A: 90% of 500 = 450.\n\nAfter Station B: 85% of 450 = 382.5.\n\nAfter Station C: 80% of 382.5 = 306.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the overall probability of a widget passing all three stations.\n\nThe probability of passing Station A is 90% or 0.9.\n\nThe probability of passing Station B is 85% or 0.85.\n\nThe probability of passing Station C is 80% or 0.8.\n\nAssuming that the rejections at each station are independent, the overall probability of passing all three stations is:\n\n0.9 * 0.85 * 0.8.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 0.9 * 0.85 = 0.765.\n\nThen, 0.765 * 0.8 = 0.612.\n\nSo, the overall probability is 0.612, or 61.2%.\n\nTherefore, the number of widgets approved by all three stations is 61.2% of 500.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n0.612 * 500 = 306.\n\nAgain, I get 306 widgets.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nMaybe the rejections are not independent, or perhaps there's a different way to calculate the number of widgets that pass through all stations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the number of widgets rejected at each station and subtract those from the total.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nStarting with 500 widgets.\n\nAt Station A, 10% are rejected: 0.1 * 500 = 50 widgets rejected.\n\nSo, 500 - 50 = 450 widgets pass to Station B.\n\nAt Station B, 15% of the remaining 450 are rejected: 0.15 * 450 = 67.5 widgets rejected.\n\nSo, 450 - 67.5 = 382.5 widgets pass to Station C.\n\nAt Station C, 20% of the remaining 382.5 are rejected: 0.2 * 382.5 = 76.5 widgets rejected.\n\nTherefore, 382.5 - 76.5 = 306 widgets are approved by all three stations.\n\nAgain, I end up with 306 widgets.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach this, the answer remains the same.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that 306 widgets are approved and ready for shipment after passing through all three quality control stations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{306} \\]"
