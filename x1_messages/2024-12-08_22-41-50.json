        "content": "Let's see... So, there are two coins in a man's pocket that together make 30 cents. And it's said that one of them is not a nickel. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky at first, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what possible coins could add up to 30 cents. The common coins we have are pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents), dimes (10 cents), and quarters (25 cents). So, combinations of these that sum to 30 cents could be:\n\n- A quarter (25 cents) and a nickel (5 cents): 25 + 5 = 30 cents.\n\n- Three dimes (10 cents each): 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 cents. But wait, the problem says there are two coins, so this doesn't fit.\n\n- Two dimes (10 cents each) and a dime makes 20 cents, but that's still not enough. Wait, no, it's two coins, so two dimes would be 20 cents, which is less than 30.\n\n- A dime and a nickel: 10 + 5 = 15 cents. That's only 15 cents, not 30.\n\n- A dime and a quarter: 10 + 25 = 35 cents. That's too much.\n\n- Two nickels: 5 + 5 = 10 cents. Too little.\n\n- A nickel and a penny: 5 + 1 = 6 cents. Way too low.\n\n- A dime and a penny: 10 + 1 = 11 cents. Still too low.\n\n- A quarter and a penny: 25 + 1 = 26 cents. Closer, but still not 30.\n\n- Maybe two quarters: 25 + 25 = 50 cents. That's too much.\n\nSo, from these possibilities, the only combination that adds up to exactly 30 cents is a quarter and a nickel.\n\nBut there's a twist: one of them is not a nickel. Hmm, that seems contradictory because if one is not a nickel, but the other is a nickel, then the total would still be 30 cents. Wait, but the way the question is phrased, \"one of them is not a nickel,\" it could be interpreted differently.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. If I have two coins: a quarter and a nickel. One of them is a quarter, which is not a nickel, and the other is a nickel. So, indeed, one of them is not a nickel, and the other is. So, this seems to fit.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to interpret this. Perhaps both coins are something other than nickels. Let's explore that.\n\nIf neither coin is a nickel, what combinations do I have?\n\n- Two dimes: 10 + 10 = 20 cents. That's less than 30.\n\n- A dime and a quarter: 10 + 25 = 35 cents. That's too much.\n\n- A quarter and a penny: 25 + 1 = 26 cents. Not 30.\n\n- A dime and a penny: 10 + 1 = 11 cents. Too low.\n\n- Two quarters: 25 + 25 = 50 cents. Too high.\n\n- A penny and a nickel: 1 + 5 = 6 cents. Too low.\n\n- A penny and a dime: 1 + 10 = 11 cents. Too low.\n\nSo, without using a nickel at all, I can't seem to make 30 cents with two coins.\n\nWait, maybe using more than two coins, but the problem specifies two coins.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one coin is a nickel, and the other is not, as I thought earlier.\n\nBut let's consider if there's a trick here. Maybe one of the coins is not a nickel, but the other one could be.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"one of them is not a nickel,\" which could imply that the other one could be anything, including another nickel.\n\nBut if both are nickels, that's 10 cents, which is not 30 cents.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct interpretation is that one coin is definitely not a nickel, and the other can be anything.\n\nSo, in that case, the combination would be:\n\n- One coin is not a nickel, say a quarter (25 cents), and the other is a nickel (5 cents), totaling 30 cents.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- One coin is not a nickel, say a dime (10 cents), and the other is a twenty-cent coin. Wait, but we don't have a twenty-cent coin in standard currency.\n\n- Or, one coin is not a nickel, say a penny (1 cent), and the other is a 29-cent coin. Again, no such coin exists.\n\nSo, the only feasible combination seems to be a quarter and a nickel.\n\nBut wait, there might be a trick in the wording. Let's look at the statement again: \"One of them is not a nickel.\"\n\nThis could be interpreted as one specific coin is not a nickel, but the other one could be anything, including another nickel.\n\nBut if both are nickels, that's 10 cents, which doesn't add up to 30 cents.\n\nSo, that seems impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the way the statement is phrased is confusing.\n\nLet me consider the logical statement: \"One of them is not a nickel.\"\n\nThis is different from saying \"Neither of them is a nickel\" or \"Only one of them is a nickel.\"\n\nIf I say \"one of them is not a nickel,\" it means that at least one coin is not a nickel, but the other one could be anything.\n\nSo, in the combination of a quarter and a nickel, one is not a nickel (the quarter), and the other is a nickel.\n\nThat fits the condition.\n\nAlternatively, if both coins are not nickels, that would also satisfy \"one of them is not a nickel,\" but as we saw earlier, without using a nickel, I can't make 30 cents with two coins.\n\nSo, the only possible combination is a quarter and a nickel.\n\nBut perhaps there's a trick involving non-standard coins or different perspectives.\n\nWait a minute, maybe one of the coins is a nickel, and the other is a quarter, but the way it's worded, \"one of them is not a nickel,\" could be misleading.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coins are not standard U.S. coins.\n\nBut the problem seems to assume standard coins.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a play on words.\n\nWait, perhaps one of the coins is a nickel, and the other is a quarter, but the quarter is not a nickel, so \"one of them is not a nickel.\"\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the quarter is considered \"not a nickel,\" but the nickel is a nickel.\n\nSo, in that case, the quarter is the one that is not a nickel.\n\nThus, the two coins are a quarter and a nickel.\n\nBut let's think differently.\n\nSuppose one coin is a nickel, and the other is a quarter.\n\nThen, \"one of them is not a nickel\" would be true, because the quarter is not a nickel.\n\nBut the total is 30 cents.\n\nThat seems to fit.\n\nAlternatively, if both are quarters, then neither is a nickel, but 25 + 25 = 50 cents, which is not 30 cents.\n\nIf one is a quarter (not a nickel) and the other is a nickel, that's 25 + 5 = 30 cents.\n\nAlternatively, if one is a dime (not a nickel) and the other is a 20-cent coin, but we don't have a 20-cent coin.\n\nSo, that's not possible.\n\nSimilarly, if one is a penny (not a nickel) and the other is a 29-cent coin, which doesn't exist.\n\nTherefore, the only possible combination is a quarter and a nickel.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a trick involving the way the coins are presented.\n\nFor example, maybe one coin is a nickel standing up, or something like that.\n\nBut that seems too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the man has two coins that add up to 30 cents, one of which is not a nickel, and the other could be anything.\n\nBut as we've seen, the only combination that works is a quarter and a nickel.\n\nTherefore, the two coins are a quarter and a nickel.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{a quarter and a nickel}} \\]"
