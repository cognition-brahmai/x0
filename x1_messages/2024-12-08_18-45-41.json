        "content": "So the company currently has 150 employees, and they plan to hire an additional 20% of their current workforce. To find out how many new employees they will hire, I need to calculate 20% of 150.\n\nFirst, I'll find what 20% of 150 is. I know that percent means per hundred, so 20% is the same as 20/100 or 0.20.\n\nSo, 20% of 150 is 0.20 multiplied by 150.\n\nLet me do the multiplication: 0.20 \u00d7 150 = 30.\n\nSo, the company plans to hire 30 new employees.\n\nNow, to find the total number of employees after hiring, I need to add the new employees to the current workforce.\n\nCurrent employees: 150\n\nNew employees: 30\n\nTotal employees: 150 + 30 = 180\n\nTherefore, the company will hire 30 new employees, and the total number of employees after hiring will be 180.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe company will hire \\boxed{30} new employees, and the total number of employees after hiring will be \\boxed{180}."
