        "content": "So we have this train problem here. Let's see what we've got. There are two trains: one leaving Station A heading towards Station B, and the other leaving Station B heading towards Station A. The distance between Station A and Station B is 180 miles.\n\nTrain from Station A:\n\n- Speed: 60 mph\n\nTrain from Station B:\n\n- Speed: 80 mph\n\nThey both leave at the same time, and we need to find out when they meet.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"when they meet\" means. It means the point in time when both trains are at the same point between Station A and Station B.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, their speeds add up relative to each other. So, the combined speed at which they're approaching each other is:\n\n60 mph + 80 mph = 140 mph\n\nNow, the total distance between them is 180 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 180 miles / 140 mph\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n180 divided by 140 is 1.2857 hours\n\nBut that's not very precise. Maybe I can simplify it.\n\n180 / 140 = 1.2857 hours\n\nAlternatively, I can reduce the fraction:\n\n180 / 140 = 1.2857, which is 1 and 20/140 hours.\n\nSimplify 20/140:\n\n20 \u00f7 20 = 1\n\n140 \u00f7 20 = 7\n\nSo, 20/140 = 1/7\n\nTherefore, time = 1 and 1/7 hours, which is 1 hour and (1/7)*60 minutes.\n\n1/7 of 60 minutes is approximately 8.57 minutes.\n\nSo, they meet after about 1 hour and 8.57 minutes.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of relative speed.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is 140 mph, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, time = distance / relative speed = 180 / 140 = 1.2857 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the concept of closing the gap.\n\nEach hour, the trains close the distance between them by 140 miles (60 + 80).\n\nSo, to cover 180 miles, it would take 180 / 140 = 1.2857 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I can set up equations for the positions of the trains over time.\n\nLet's denote time in hours as t.\n\nDistance covered by train from A in time t: 60t miles\n\nDistance covered by train from B in time t: 80t miles\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they cover should equal the total distance between the stations.\n\nSo:\n\n60t + 80t = 180\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n140t = 180\n\nNow, solve for t:\n\nt = 180 / 140 = 1.2857 hours\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how much distance they cover together per hour.\n\nTogether, they cover 140 miles per hour.\n\nSo, to cover 180 miles, it takes 180 / 140 = 1.2857 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how long it takes for the combined distance to equal 180 miles.\n\nBut I keep getting the same answer. So, it must be correct.\n\nWait, maybe I can check it another way.\n\nLet's assume they meet after t hours.\n\nIn t hours, train from A covers 60t miles.\n\nTrain from B covers 80t miles.\n\nTotal distance covered: 60t + 80t = 140t miles.\n\nThis should equal 180 miles.\n\nSo, 140t = 180\n\nt = 180 / 140 = 1.2857 hours.\n\nAlternatively, t = 180 / 140 = 9/7 hours.\n\nBecause 180 divided by 140 simplifies to 9/7.\n\nSince 180 \u00f7 140 = 1.2857, which is indeed 9/7.\n\nBecause 9 divided by 7 is approximately 1.2857.\n\nSo, t = 9/7 hours.\n\nTo convert that to minutes, since there are 60 minutes in an hour:\n\n(9/7) hours * 60 minutes/hour = (9 * 60) / 7 = 540 / 7 \u2248 77.14 minutes.\n\nSo, they meet after approximately 77.14 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, 9/7 hours is 1 hour and 2/7 hours.\n\n2/7 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120/7 \u2248 17.14 minutes.\n\nSo, 1 hour and 17.14 minutes.\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nEarlier, I calculated 1 hour and 8.57 minutes, but now it's 1 hour and 17.14 minutes.\n\nThat doesn't make sense. There must be a mistake in one of these calculations.\n\nWait, let's check the fractions.\n\nEarlier, I said 180 / 140 = 1.2857, which is 9/7.\n\nBut then, 9/7 hours is indeed 1 hour and 2/7 hours.\n\n2/7 hours * 60 minutes = 120/7 \u2248 17.14 minutes.\n\nSo, it's 1 hour and approximately 17.14 minutes.\n\nWait, perhaps the earlier calculation was wrong.\n\nI thought 180 / 140 = 1.2857, which is 9/7.\n\nBut 180 divided by 140 is indeed 1.2857, which is 9/7.\n\nSo, t = 9/7 hours.\n\nTherefore, they meet after 9/7 hours, which is approximately 1 hour and 17.14 minutes.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier simplification.\n\nI thought 180 / 140 = 1.2857, which is 9/7.\n\nBut actually, 180 divided by 140 is 1.2857, which is 9/7.\n\nSo, t = 9/7 hours.\n\nTherefore, they meet after 9/7 hours.\n\nAlternatively, to convert 9/7 hours into minutes:\n\n9/7 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 540/7 \u2248 77.14 minutes.\n\nSo, they meet after approximately 77.14 minutes, or 1 hour and 17.14 minutes.\n\nWait, but 60 minutes plus 17.14 minutes is 77.14 minutes.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the distances each train covers in that time.\n\nIf t = 9/7 hours,\n\nThen, distance covered by train from A: 60 * (9/7) = 540/7 \u2248 77.14 miles.\n\nDistance covered by train from B: 80 * (9/7) = 720/7 \u2248 102.86 miles.\n\nTotal distance: 77.14 + 102.86 = 180 miles.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of relative speed again.\n\nRelative speed is 140 mph.\n\nTime to cover 180 miles at 140 mph is 180 / 140 = 9/7 hours.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about how much distance each train covers per hour.\n\nTrain A covers 60 miles per hour.\n\nTrain B covers 80 miles per hour.\n\nTogether, they cover 140 miles per hour.\n\nSo, in t hours, they cover 140t miles.\n\nSet that equal to 180 miles:\n\n140t = 180\n\nt = 180 / 140 = 9/7 hours.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the ratio of their speeds.\n\nThe trains are moving towards each other, so the point where they meet can be found by dividing the distance in proportion to their speeds.\n\nThe train from A is moving at 60 mph, and the train from B at 80 mph.\n\nThe ratio of their speeds is 60:80, which simplifies to 3:4.\n\nTherefore, the distance covered by train A to the total distance is 3/(3+4) = 3/7.\n\nSimilarly, the distance covered by train B is 4/7.\n\nTherefore, distance covered by train A: (3/7)*180 \u2248 77.14 miles.\n\nDistance covered by train B: (4/7)*180 \u2248 102.86 miles.\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, they meet after approximately 77.14 minutes, or 1 hour and 17.14 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, in exact terms, 9/7 hours.\n\nSo, the answer is that the trains meet after 9/7 hours, or approximately 1 hour and 17 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{7} \\text{ hours}} \\]"
