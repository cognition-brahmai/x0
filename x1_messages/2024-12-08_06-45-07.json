        "content": "Let's see. The car factory produces 500 cars per day, and each car needs 4 tires. I need to find out how many tires the factory needs in a week, which is 7 days.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how many tires are needed per day. Since each car needs 4 tires, and they produce 500 cars each day, I can multiply the number of cars by the number of tires per car:\n\n500 cars/day \u00d7 4 tires/car = 2,000 tires/day\n\nSo, the factory needs 2,000 tires every day to keep up with production.\n\nNow, to find out the weekly need, I need to multiply the daily tire usage by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:\n\n2,000 tires/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 14,000 tires/week\n\nTherefore, the factory needs 14,000 tires per week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to first calculate the total number of cars produced in a week and then multiply by the number of tires per car.\n\nFirst, find the weekly car production:\n\n500 cars/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 3,500 cars/week\n\nThen, multiply the total weekly car production by the number of tires per car:\n\n3,500 cars/week \u00d7 4 tires/car = 14,000 tires/week\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, the factory needs 14,000 tires per week.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can consider if there are any other factors that might affect the tire need. For example, are there any tires held in inventory, or are there any defects or spare tires to consider? But based on the information given, it seems like the factory needs exactly 4 tires per car, with no mention of extras or defects.\n\nSo, I think 14,000 tires per week is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14000} \\]"
