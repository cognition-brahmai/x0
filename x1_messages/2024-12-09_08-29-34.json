        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! In Python, determining whether a year is a leap year or not involves checking specific conditions based on the rules for leap years.\n\nA leap year is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400. So, for example, the year 2000 was a leap year because although it is divisible by 100, it is also divisible by 400. On the other hand, 1900 was not a leap year because it is divisible by 100 but not by 400.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a year as an argument. It will return `True` if the year is a leap year and `False` otherwise.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nprint(is_leap_year(2000))  # Output: True\nprint(is_leap_year(1900))  # Output: False\nprint(is_leap_year(2020))  # Output: True\nprint(is_leap_year(2021))  # Output: False\n```\n\nThis should help you determine leap years in Python.
