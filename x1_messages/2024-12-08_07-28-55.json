But tonight, it`s Charlie that might be in big trouble. LINCOLN TAYLOR, FATHER TO BE: Seriously honey, where is the baby? J. TAYLOR: Right in here. See? HAMMER: From baby joy to viral sensation. It`s that baby announcement that`s making all others bow down. Well, tonight the rapping parents are right here with the story behind the best baby video ever. SBT starts right now. Hello. I`m A.J. Hammer. Thank you so much for catching. I`m here with my guest co-host tonight, Natasha Curry, the anchor of \"WEEKEND EXPRESS\" here on HLN. Good to see you, Natasha. NATASHA CURRY, CO-HOST: You too, A.J. What`s up. You know, we`re kicking off our \"Top Ten Countdown\" of today`s must-see, must-share stories with No. 10. Charlie`s war goes nuclear. There are dramatic and -- I`ve got to say -- really disturbing new developments tonight in Charlie Sheen`s battle with his ex, Brooke Mueller, over their two children. Now, Charlie`s ex-wife, Denise Richards, is making some very chilling claims, A.J. HAMMER: That`s right, Natasha. Denise has been caring for the boys while Brooke got help for her reported substance abuse issues. Both TMZ and Radar reported today that Denise wrote a letter to child services, saying that the boys have gotten so out of control she can`t have them around anymore. Vinnie Politan, the co-host of HLN`s \"AFTER DARK\" is with us tonight. Vinnie, I want to watch together what Charlie just told \"TMZ Live\" about what happens when his boys are with Brooke. Let`s look. CHARLIE SHEEN, ACTOR: When they leave for the visits with her, they`re fine. And when they come back they`re completely incorrigible. They`re completely -- there`s no logic. There`s no rationale. They throw stuff at the girls. They kick the dogs. They attack Denise. It`s Jekyll and Hyde behavior that is a direct result from the visits at Brooke`s house. HAMMER: Obviously, a terrible thing to be happening, if it is happening, Vinnie. If what Charlie is alleging here is true, it does seem to me that these boys should be prevented from going anywhere near Brooke. VINNIE POLITAN, HOST, HLN`S \"AFTER DARK\": Yes, but what Charlie also said in that interview, he talked about the fact that the reports are glowing from family services. So without some sort of backup to these allegations -- and he even sort of admits there that \"I don`t have 100 percent proof of what exactly is going on there.\" The other part of this, though, is A.J., these children, 4 years old now, the twins. So they`re starting to get to the age where they`ll be able to start communicating exactly what`s going on, and that may be the best way to get to the bottom of all this. HAMMER: I don`t know if this serves as the back-up that you`re talking about, Vinnie, but Denise wrote this really unbelievable letter that was tough for me to even read, particularly as an animal lover, in which she says to child services that Charlie`s boys are being physically abusive to her and her daughters, and Natasha, this is some really disturbing stuff in this letter. CURRY: Yes. It really is, A.J. The letter was reportedly sent to L.A.`s Department of Children and Family Services. And Denise reportedly says that Charlie`s boys are out of control. Quote, \"Mine and Charlie`s daughters have been strangled, kicked in the head and stomach, scratched, bit, slapped, punched in the face and head, and spit on. Myself and anyone around them have also experienced this. The boys have also been waking up with nightmares. It`s become unsafe in my home at times with their behavior. I can`t risk anything happening to my daughters or anyone else in my home. For that I have to step aside at this time,\" A.J. And so some really chilling things coming from her. HAMMER: You know, we thought it was a great thing that Denise Richards was actually stepping in. How magnanimous that she was going to take care of the kids that Charlie had with Brooke. Entertainment journalist Maggie Furlong joins me from Hollywood right now. Maggie, things have to be extraordinarily desperate for Denise to effectively say, \"You know what? I give up. I can`t watch Charlie`s boys anyone.\" MAGGIE FURLONG, ENTERTAINMENT JOURNALIST: Well, yes, and I think the things that she`s saying are big indicators of what`s happening. They`re abusive toward animals. They`re abusive to her daughters. They`re abusive to her. They`re tearing things up. They`re having nightmares. These aren`t kid just being bad and lashing out. These are kids who are obviously very confused. I mean, think what it must be like. They leave their mom. They don`t go to their dad. They go to their dad`s ex-wife and his three other daughters from different marriages and adoptions. It`s got to be weighing on them, and obviously, they`re acting out because of it. So I feel sad for these boys. HAMMER: And Charlie pretty much backed up what Denise is reportedly saying about his boys in this interview with \"TMZ Live.\" He said that ever since they started having more of these visits with their mother, Brooke Mueller, they`ve been out of control. Watch this. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How badly damaged are these kids? SHEEN: They`re basically telling us that if the behavior does not improve, they`re going to have to be removed from the school that they`re at and probably homeschooled with somebody with a military background. HAMMER: OK. Vinnie, help me sort this out here. Because you mentioned that the Department of Children and Family Services has given glowing reports. Charlie says that that same department is dragging their feet. He`s really ticked off at them and saying they`re not doing enough. So now that this dispute has gone public, do you think that children services, who typically does not go public with these sorts of things, do you think they need to step up and defend themselves? POLITAN: Well, I think what they need to do is step up the investigation. I mean, if this is the behavior, they need to figure out the cause of the behavior. Is it just being in the middle of this terrible battle? Or is it -- is one parent or another to blame for all this behavior that`s being alleged? So I think that`s where it really has to go. It has to go towards the investigation into what is causing the children to act this way. And that`s where you need the experts, the child psychologists who can speak to these children and perhaps get it from them, now that they`re 4 years old. HAMMER: And meanwhile, all this is allegedly going on right next door to Charlie`s house, where Brooke lives. It`s just that he has some kind of an order in place where he`s not even allowed in that house. SHOWBIZ TONIGHT did reach out today to all the parties involved. Charlie Sheen`s rep told us, quote, \"No comment.\" And we didn`t hear back from Denise Richards and Brooke by our deadline. But Natasha, it is just an extraordinary thing to have seen, this interplay, especially involving Charlie Sheen, who prior to this, was the one who seemed to be causing all the problems. CURRY: Yes, A.J. Definitely. Needless to say, we`re all hoping for the best for these children, for sure. Well, a war over another big star`s child is next in our countdown of must- see, must-share stories. At No. 9, don`t dare even call Tom Cruise an absentee dad. Cruise is suing the publisher of \"Life + Style\" and \"InTouch\" magazine for reporting that he abandoned his daughter Suri following his divorce from actress Katie Holmes. Well, today, SHOWBIZ TONIGHT obtained Tom`s declaration. And in it, Cruise says, \"I have in no way cut Suri out of my life, whether it`s physically, emotionally, financially or otherwise, even during the times when I was working overseas and was not able to see Suri in person. We were and continue to be extremely close.\" So Vinnie, what do you think about this? A $50 million lawsuit. Is it excessive or do you think Cruise actually stands a chance to win this thing? POLITAN: Well, I think Tom Cruise is serious about this. And you know, this is the -- someone of his stature has the ability to take on a big company like this, a big publisher like this and take it very seriously. The bottom line here of him being a public figure makes it more difficult to get past the judge to the jury. But if Tom Cruise gets in front of a jury, advantage Tom Cruise. CURRY: Yes, and he`s taken on tabloids before, so he does have some experience in that, anyway. But Maggie, what do you think about this? How do you take it all? FURLONG: I mean, you kind of hope in a case like this sets a precedent. Obviously, he`s got the name, the star power and the money to file this lawsuit. But you hope that it sort of lets these tabloids know that kids should not be fair game. Just because their parents are famous, no matter what the situation is, you have to feel bad for Suri in all of this. She`s at the age where she understands what`s going on. She understands her parents are famous. Paparazzi follow them everywhere. He`s trying to be a good dad. He claims he`s never cut her out. I just think the story needs to remain away from Suri and more about, OK, Tom is just saying back off from kids in general. CURRY: Yes, you make a great point. I`m always concerned, too, about the kids. And we should note also, guys, that the publisher, the magazine`s publisher, is fighting back. It`s reportedly filed papers of its own, claiming that Cruise was away from Suri for a significant amount of time while filming. But they might have an uphill fight with Cruise. Over the years, he has successfully sued multiple parties for salacious reports about his marriages, his sex life. Vinnie, do you think the publisher of \"Life + Style\" and \"InTouch,\" should they be worried? POLITAN: I don`t know if they were. I think this is business as usual for them. And the bottom line, though, is they have to be careful if this thing gets in front of a jury, because the numbers could be astronomical. Because it`s about deterrence. The only way to deter behavior like this in the future is to hit them hard and hit them in the pocketbook, and that`s what they`re going to be going for. CURRY: We`ll see how it all shakes out. Vinnie, Maggie, guys, thank you so much -- A.J. HAMMER: Yes. I hear Tom Cruise getting involved in any kind of a lawsuit that involves any kind of a tabloid, Natasha, and I have to say you don`t mess around with Tom Cruise, because he does have a proven track record with this stuff. And he`s not going to fight them unless he has something to back him up. CURRY: Yes. He has a ton of pull in Hollywood, so we`ll see what happens. HAMMER: All right. As we move on tonight, we have Kerry Washington`s disturbing revelation to talk about. The \"Scandal\" star talks about her past binge eating until she passed out. Wow. Tonight Kerry`s eating disorder confession. Plus, this baby announcement really kicks all others in the Pampers. J. TAYLOR: Where my babies at? Where my babies at? Where my babies at? Where my babies at? L. TAYLOR: Seriously honey, where is the baby? J. TAYLOR: Right in here. See? HAMMER: This is just as good as a \"Saturday Night Live\" digital short, if you ask me. But it`s by two stoked parents who just wanted to share their baby joy. Very cool. Well, look at this, they rapping parents are right here tonight. They`re going to talk about their viral video fame and what made them want to break the news this way. We`re just getting warmed up on the countdown. What`s going to be No. 1 tonight? This is SBT on HLN.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 20 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
