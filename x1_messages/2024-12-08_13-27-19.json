        "content": "Let's calculate the total revenue from fruit sales for the store. They sell three types of fruits: apples, oranges, and bananas. Here are the quantities sold and their respective prices:\n\n- Apples: 150 sold at $1.50 each\n\n- Oranges: 200 sold at $1.00 each\n\n- Bananas: 250 sold at $0.50 each\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the revenue from each type of fruit separately and then add them up to get the total revenue.\n\nStarting with apples:\n\nNumber of apples sold = 150\n\nPrice per apple = $1.50\n\nRevenue from apples = 150 * 1.50 = ?\n\nTo calculate 150 * 1.50, I can think of it as 150 * (1 + 0.50) = (150 * 1) + (150 * 0.50) = 150 + 75 = 225\n\nSo, revenue from apples = $225\n\nNext, oranges:\n\nNumber of oranges sold = 200\n\nPrice per orange = $1.00\n\nRevenue from oranges = 200 * 1.00 = 200\n\nSo, revenue from oranges = $200\n\nNow, bananas:\n\nNumber of bananas sold = 250\n\nPrice per banana = $0.50\n\nRevenue from bananas = 250 * 0.50 = ?\n\n250 * 0.50 is the same as 250 / 2 = 125\n\nSo, revenue from bananas = $125\n\nFinally, to find the total revenue, I'll add up the revenues from all three fruits:\n\nTotal revenue = revenue from apples + revenue from oranges + revenue from bananas = 225 + 200 + 125\n\nLet's add them up:\n\n225 + 200 = 425\n\n425 + 125 = 550\n\nTherefore, the total revenue from fruit sales in one day is $550.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{550} \\]"
