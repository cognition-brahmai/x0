        "content": "So I've got this problem here: \"It takes 7 machines 7 minutes to make 7 widgets. How long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?\" Hmm, let's see. At first glance, it seems like a straightforward problem, but I want to make sure I think through it carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of machines, the time they take, and the number of widgets produced. The problem states that 7 machines take 7 minutes to make 7 widgets. So, if I have 7 machines, they can produce 7 widgets in 7 minutes. That means, per machine, how many widgets are being produced in that time?\n\nWell, if 7 machines make 7 widgets in 7 minutes, then each machine is making 1 widget in 7 minutes. So, one machine takes 7 minutes to make one widget.\n\nNow, if I have 100 machines, and each machine can make one widget in 7 minutes, then theoretically, 100 machines working simultaneously would each produce one widget in 7 minutes. Therefore, 100 machines could produce 100 widgets in 7 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, is it that simple? Let me double-check. The key here is that the machines are working simultaneously. So, if each machine takes 7 minutes to make one widget, and they all start at the same time, then after 7 minutes, all 100 machines would have each produced one widget, totaling 100 widgets.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any dependency or if the machines affect each other's production time. The problem doesn't suggest any such dependency, so I can assume that each machine operates independently.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find the rate of widget production per machine. If one machine takes 7 minutes to make one widget, its production rate is 1 widget per 7 minutes.\n\nSo, for 100 machines, the combined production rate would be 100 widgets per 7 minutes.\n\nTherefore, to produce 100 widgets, it would take 7 minutes with 100 machines working simultaneously.\n\nLet me try another approach to confirm. If 7 machines take 7 minutes to make 7 widgets, then the total machine-minutes required to make 7 widgets is 7 machines * 7 minutes = 49 machine-minutes.\n\nSo, for 7 widgets, it takes 49 machine-minutes. Therefore, for one widget, it would take 49 machine-minutes / 7 widgets = 7 machine-minutes per widget.\n\nNow, if I need to make 100 widgets, the total machine-minutes required would be 100 widgets * 7 machine-minutes per widget = 700 machine-minutes.\n\nIf I have 100 machines working simultaneously, the time required would be total machine-minutes divided by the number of machines, which is 700 machine-minutes / 100 machines = 7 minutes.\n\nSo, again, I arrive at the same answer: 7 minutes.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might be missing. Is there any setup time, or does the production time change with more machines? The problem doesn't indicate any such complications, so I'll stick with the assumption that each machine operates independently and takes 7 minutes to produce one widget.\n\nAnother angle: if I had only one machine, it would take 7 minutes to make one widget. To make 100 widgets, it would take 100 * 7 minutes = 700 minutes, if only one machine is working.\n\nBut with 100 machines, since they can work in parallel, the time is divided by the number of machines. So, 700 minutes / 100 machines = 7 minutes.\n\nThis matches my previous calculations.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's think about a smaller scale. Suppose I have 2 machines. If each machine takes 7 minutes to make one widget, then 2 machines can make 2 widgets in 7 minutes.\n\nSimilarly, 100 machines can make 100 widgets in 7 minutes.\n\nIt seems consistent.\n\nI think the answer is 7 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
