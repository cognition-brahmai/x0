        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a logistics company that needs to transport 100 tons of goods every day, and they have a budget of $2,000 per day for renting trucks. There are three types of trucks they can rent: small, medium, and large, with capacities of 10 tons, 20 tons, and 40 tons, respectively. The rental costs are $200, $300, and $500 per day for small, medium, and large trucks, respectively. I need to figure out the optimal combination of these trucks to meet the daily transportation requirement while staying within the budget and minimizing costs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints and the objectives. The main constraints are:\n\n1. The total transportation capacity must be at least 100 tons per day.\n\n2. The total cost of renting trucks must not exceed $2,000 per day.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the cost while satisfying the above constraints.\n\nLet me define some variables to make this easier. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( s \\) be the number of small trucks rented.\n\n- Let \\( m \\) be the number of medium trucks rented.\n\n- Let \\( l \\) be the number of large trucks rented.\n\nNow, the total capacity provided by these trucks would be:\n\n\\( 10s + 20m + 40l \\) tons.\n\nThis needs to be at least 100 tons, so:\n\n\\( 10s + 20m + 40l \\geq 100 \\).\n\nThe total cost would be:\n\n\\( 200s + 300m + 500l \\) dollars.\n\nThis needs to be less than or equal to $2,000, so:\n\n\\( 200s + 300m + 500l \\leq 2000 \\).\n\nOur goal is to minimize the total cost, which is \\( 200s + 300m + 500l \\).\n\nThis seems like a linear programming problem, but since the number of trucks rented has to be integers (you can't rent a fraction of a truck), it's actually an integer linear programming problem. However, for simplicity, I'll first consider it as a linear programming problem and then adjust for integer values.\n\nLet me consider the cost per ton for each type of truck to see which one is the most cost-effective.\n\n- For small trucks: $200 for 10 tons, so $20 per ton.\n\n- For medium trucks: $300 for 20 tons, which is $15 per ton.\n\n- For large trucks: $500 for 40 tons, which is $12.50 per ton.\n\nSo, the large trucks are the most cost-effective per ton of capacity. Therefore, it makes sense to rent as many large trucks as possible within the budget and capacity constraints.\n\nLet me see how many large trucks I can rent without exceeding the budget.\n\nEach large truck costs $500, so with a $2,000 budget, the maximum number of large trucks I can rent is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2000}{500} \\right\\rfloor = 4 \\) trucks.\n\nBut do I need 4 large trucks? Let's check the capacity.\n\n4 large trucks would provide \\( 4 \\times 40 = 160 \\) tons, which is more than the required 100 tons. The cost would be \\( 4 \\times 500 = 2000 \\) dollars, which exactly meets the budget.\n\nBut is there a way to meet the requirement with fewer large trucks and perhaps a combination of medium and small trucks to reduce the cost?\n\nLet me try renting 3 large trucks.\n\n3 large trucks would provide \\( 3 \\times 40 = 120 \\) tons, which is still more than 100 tons. The cost would be \\( 3 \\times 500 = 1500 \\) dollars.\n\nNow, I have room in the budget for additional trucks if needed, but since 120 tons already exceeds the requirement, I might not need more trucks. However, I should check if renting fewer large trucks and compensating with medium and small trucks could lead to a lower cost.\n\nLet me try with 2 large trucks.\n\n2 large trucks provide \\( 2 \\times 40 = 80 \\) tons, which is less than 100 tons. So, I need additional capacity of \\( 100 - 80 = 20 \\) tons.\n\nTo cover the additional 20 tons, I can rent one medium truck, which provides exactly 20 tons. The cost would be \\( 2 \\times 500 + 1 \\times 300 = 1000 + 300 = 1300 \\) dollars.\n\nThis is cheaper than the previous option of 3 large trucks for $1500.\n\nLet me check if renting 1 large truck and compensating with medium and small trucks can lead to a lower cost.\n\n1 large truck provides 40 tons, so I need an additional \\( 100 - 40 = 60 \\) tons.\n\nTo cover 60 tons, I could rent three medium trucks \\( 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\) tons, costing \\( 1 \\times 500 + 3 \\times 300 = 500 + 900 = 1400 \\) dollars.\n\nAlternatively, I could rent two medium trucks and two small trucks: \\( 2 \\times 20 + 2 \\times 10 = 40 + 20 = 60 \\) tons, costing \\( 2 \\times 300 + 2 \\times 200 = 600 + 400 = 1000 \\) dollars, plus the large truck's $500, totaling $1500.\n\nWait, that's $1500, which is more than the $1400 for three medium trucks.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's recalculate.\n\nWait, if I rent 1 large truck ($500), plus two medium trucks ($300 each), and two small trucks ($200 each), the total cost would be $500 + $600 + $400 = $1500.\n\nBut renting 1 large truck and three medium trucks would be $500 + $900 = $1400.\n\nSo, $1400 is cheaper.\n\nIs there a better combination?\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf I rent 1 large truck (40 tons), and two medium trucks (40 tons), that's total 80 tons, which is less than 100 tons. So, I need an additional 20 tons, which can be covered by one medium truck, but I already have two medium trucks, which is 40 tons, more than needed. So, perhaps renting one large and two medium trucks is sufficient, providing 80 tons, but I need 100 tons. Wait, no, two medium trucks provide 40 tons plus large truck's 40 tons equals 80 tons, which is less than 100 tons. So, I need more.\n\nWait, I need 100 tons, and one large and two medium trucks provide only 80 tons, so I need an additional 20 tons, which can be covered by one medium truck. So, in total, one large and three medium trucks, providing 40 + 60 = 100 tons, costing $500 + $900 = $1400.\n\nAlternatively, one large truck and two medium trucks plus two small trucks: 40 + 40 + 20 = 100 tons, costing $500 + $600 + $400 = $1500.\n\nSo, the first option is better.\n\nWhat if I rent one large truck and one medium truck and three small trucks: 40 + 20 + 30 = 90 tons, which is less than 100 tons. Not sufficient.\n\nWait, small trucks are 10 tons each, so three small trucks would be 30 tons, plus large and medium is 40 + 20 + 30 = 90 tons, which is less than 100 tons.\n\nI need to make sure the total capacity is at least 100 tons.\n\nSo, back to renting one large and three medium trucks: 40 + 60 = 100 tons, costing $1400.\n\nIs there a way to reduce the cost further by using small trucks?\n\nLet me try renting one large truck and two medium trucks: 40 + 40 = 80 tons, needing an additional 20 tons.\n\nI could rent two small trucks for 20 tons, costing $400, plus the $500 for the large truck and $600 for two medium trucks, totaling $1500, which is more than $1400.\n\nSo, not better.\n\nWhat if I rent one large truck and one medium truck and one small truck: 40 + 20 + 10 = 70 tons, which is less than 100 tons.\n\nNot sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, one large truck and one medium truck and three small trucks: 40 + 20 + 30 = 90 tons, still less than 100 tons.\n\nNot enough.\n\nSo, it seems that the combination of one large truck and three medium trucks is the minimal cost option that meets the requirements, costing $1400.\n\nBut let's check if I can do better by not using any large trucks.\n\nLet me try renting only medium and small trucks.\n\nIf I rent five medium trucks: 5 x 20 = 100 tons, costing 5 x $300 = $1500.\n\nThat's more than $1400.\n\nWhat about four medium trucks: 80 tons, needing an additional 20 tons, which can be covered by two small trucks, costing $1200 for medium trucks plus $400 for small trucks, totaling $1600, which is higher than $1400.\n\nThree medium trucks: 60 tons, needing four small trucks for 40 tons, totaling 100 tons, costing $900 + $800 = $1700, which is higher.\n\nTwo medium trucks: 40 tons, needing six small trucks for 60 tons, totaling 100 tons, costing $600 + $1200 = $1800, higher.\n\nOne medium truck: 20 tons, needing eight small trucks for 80 tons, totaling 100 tons, costing $300 + $1600 = $1900, higher.\n\nNo medium trucks: needing ten small trucks for 100 tons, costing $2000.\n\nSo, compared to these options, renting one large truck and three medium trucks for $1400 seems to be the most cost-effective.\n\nBut wait, let's see if I can rent two large trucks and one medium truck.\n\nTwo large trucks: 80 tons, one medium truck: 20 tons, total 100 tons, costing $1000 + $300 = $1300.\n\nOh, that's cheaper than $1400.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought renting three large trucks would cost $1500, which is more than $1300.\n\nSo, renting two large trucks and one medium truck: 80 + 20 = 100 tons, costing $1000 + $300 = $1300.\n\nThat's better than $1400.\n\nIs there a way to do better?\n\nLet me see.\n\nRenting two large trucks and one medium truck already gives me exactly 100 tons for $1300.\n\nCan I rent only two large trucks: 80 tons, which is less than 100 tons.\n\nSo, I need an additional 20 tons.\n\nI can rent one medium truck for $300, totaling $1300.\n\nAlternatively, I can rent two large trucks and two small trucks: 80 + 20 = 100 tons, costing $1000 + $400 = $1400, which is more than $1300.\n\nSo, sticking with two large trucks and one medium truck is better.\n\nAlternatively, renting three large trucks: 120 tons, costing $1500.\n\nThat's more expensive than $1300.\n\nSo, $1300 seems better.\n\nWait, is there a way to rent one large truck and some other combination to get to $1300 or less?\n\nLet me try.\n\nOne large truck: 40 tons, needing 60 more tons.\n\nRenting three medium trucks: 60 tons, costing $900, totaling $500 + $900 = $1400.\n\nAlternatively, renting two medium trucks and four small trucks: 40 + 40 = 80 tons, which is more than 60 tons, but costing $600 + $800 = $1400.\n\nNot better.\n\nWhat about renting one medium truck and four small trucks: 20 + 40 = 60 tons, costing $300 + $800 = $1100, plus the large truck's $500, totaling $1600.\n\nWait, that's $1600, which is higher than $1300.\n\nSo, still, two large trucks and one medium truck is better.\n\nIs there any other combination?\n\nWhat if I rent one large truck and one medium truck and two small trucks: 40 + 20 + 20 = 80 tons, which is less than 100 tons.\n\nNot sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, one large truck and two medium trucks and one small truck: 40 + 40 + 10 = 90 tons, still less.\n\nNot enough.\n\nSo, it seems that two large trucks and one medium truck is the most cost-effective option that meets the requirements.\n\nBut wait, let's check if I can rent partial trucks or not.\n\nWait, no, you can't rent partial trucks; trucks have to be whole numbers.\n\nAlso, perhaps there are constraints on the number of trucks available, but the problem doesn't specify any such constraints.\n\nAssuming there are enough trucks available, the optimal combination is two large trucks and one medium truck, providing exactly 100 tons for $1300.\n\nIs there any way to get the required capacity for less than $1300?\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf I rent one large truck and two medium trucks: 40 + 40 = 80 tons, needing an additional 20 tons.\n\nI can rent one medium truck, but that would make it three medium trucks and one large, which is more costly.\n\nAlternatively, renting one large truck and one medium truck and two small trucks: 40 + 20 + 20 = 80 tons, which is less than 100 tons.\n\nNot sufficient.\n\nWait, two small trucks provide 20 tons, so total 80 tons, still short by 20 tons.\n\nI need to rent another small truck, making it three small trucks: 30 tons, plus large and medium: 40 + 20 + 30 = 90 tons, still less than 100 tons.\n\nI need to rent a fourth small truck to make it 40 tons, plus large and medium: 40 + 20 + 40 = 100 tons, costing $500 + $300 + $800 = $1600, which is higher than $1300.\n\nSo, again, two large trucks and one medium truck is better.\n\nAlternatively, renting three large trucks: 120 tons, costing $1500.\n\nThat's more expensive than $1300.\n\nRenting two large trucks and one medium truck seems to be the sweet spot.\n\nIs there any other combination that can beat $1300?\n\nLet me consider renting one large truck and four medium trucks: 40 + 80 = 120 tons, costing $500 + $1200 = $1700, which is higher.\n\nRenting two large trucks and two medium trucks: 80 + 40 = 120 tons, costing $1000 + $600 = $1600, still higher than $1300.\n\nRenting one large truck and four small trucks: 40 + 40 = 80 tons, needing an additional 20 tons, which would require two more small trucks, totaling six small trucks: 60 tons, plus large truck's 40 tons: 100 tons, costing $500 + $1200 = $1700.\n\nAgain, higher than $1300.\n\nSeems like two large trucks and one medium truck is the optimal combination.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if renting three large trucks and negative one medium truck makes sense, but that's not possible.\n\nWait, no. Or renting fractional trucks, but again, not possible.\n\nSo, the minimal cost option is two large trucks and one medium truck, providing exactly 100 tons for $1300, which is within the budget of $2000.\n\nIs there a way to meet the requirement with exactly $2000?\n\nWell, renting three large trucks and one small truck: 120 + 10 = 130 tons, costing $1500 + $200 = $1700.\n\nStill higher than $1300.\n\nAlternatively, renting two large trucks and two medium trucks: 80 + 40 = 120 tons, costing $1000 + $600 = $1600.\n\nStill higher.\n\nSo, the best option is two large trucks and one medium truck for $1300.\n\nBut the problem also mentions that the company has a daily transportation requirement of 100 tons.\n\nDoes it mean that they need at least 100 tons, or exactly 100 tons?\n\nThe wording says \"at least 100 tons.\"\n\nSo, any combination that provides at least 100 tons and costs no more than $2000 is acceptable.\n\nBut our goal is to minimize the cost.\n\nSo, the combination that provides exactly 100 tons for $1300 is optimal.\n\nIs there a combination that provides more than 100 tons for less than $1300?\n\nLet me see.\n\nRenting two large trucks: 80 tons for $1000.\n\nNeed an additional 20 tons.\n\nRenting one medium truck: 20 tons for $300, totaling $1300.\n\nAlternatively, renting two large trucks and one small truck: 80 + 10 = 90 tons, which is less than 100 tons.\n\nNot sufficient.\n\nOr renting two large trucks and two small trucks: 80 + 20 = 100 tons for $1000 + $400 = $1400, which is more expensive than $1300.\n\nSo, again, two large trucks and one medium truck is better.\n\nIs there any combination that provides more than 100 tons for less than $1300?\n\nLet me try renting one large truck and three medium trucks: 40 + 60 = 100 tons for $500 + $900 = $1400.\n\nHigher than $1300.\n\nAlternatively, renting three medium trucks and two small trucks: 60 + 20 = 80 tons, which is less than 100 tons.\n\nNot sufficient.\n\nWait, no, three medium trucks provide 60 tons, plus two small trucks provide 20 tons, total 80 tons, which is less than 100 tons.\n\nNot enough.\n\nWhat if I rent two medium trucks and four small trucks: 40 + 40 = 80 tons, still less than 100 tons.\n\nNot sufficient.\n\nIt seems that the $1300 option is indeed the most cost-effective.\n\nBut let's consider if there is a way to utilize the budget more efficiently.\n\nWait, the budget is up to $2000, but we're staying at $1300, which is well within the budget.\n\nIs there any benefit in spending more to get more capacity?\n\nWell, the company might want to have some buffer capacity in case there are last-minute increases in demand.\n\nBut according to the problem, the daily requirement is 100 tons, so unless specified otherwise, we should stick to meeting exactly the requirement.\n\nMoreover, the objective is to minimize costs while meeting the requirements, so spending more than necessary wouldn't make sense unless there are additional benefits.\n\nIn this case, there don't seem to be any additional benefits mentioned for having extra capacity.\n\nTherefore, the optimal combination is two large trucks and one medium truck, providing exactly 100 tons for $1300.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if there are any other combinations that provide exactly 100 tons for $1300 or less.\n\nRenting two large trucks and one medium truck: 80 + 20 = 100 tons for $1000 + $300 = $1300.\n\nRenting one large truck and three medium trucks: 40 + 60 = 100 tons for $500 + $900 = $1400.\n\nRenting three large trucks: 120 tons for $1500.\n\nRenting two large trucks and two medium trucks: 80 + 40 = 120 tons for $1000 + $600 = $1600.\n\nRenting one large truck and two medium trucks and two small trucks: 40 + 40 + 20 = 100 tons for $500 + $600 + $400 = $1500.\n\nAll these options are either more expensive or provide more capacity than needed.\n\nTherefore, the most cost-effective option is two large trucks and one medium truck for $1300.\n\nSo, the optimal combination is:\n\n- 2 large trucks\n\n- 1 medium truck\n\n- 0 small trucks\n\nThis meets the daily transportation requirement of 100 tons and stays within the budget of $2000, actually well under it at $1300.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ large trucks and } 1 \\text{ medium truck}} \\]"
