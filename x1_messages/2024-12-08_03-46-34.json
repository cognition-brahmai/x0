        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an ant crawling along a tightrope, and it makes a few stops along the way. I need to figure out how far it has traveled in total.\n\nFirst, let's assume the total length of the rope is L. That way, I can work with variables and get a general solution.\n\n1. The ant travels one-third of the length of the rope.\n\nSo, the first part of its journey is (1/3)L.\n\nAfter this, the remaining distance is L - (1/3)L = (2/3)L.\n\n2. Then, it travels another quarter of the remaining distance.\n\nA quarter of the remaining distance is (1/4)(2/3)L = (2/12)L = (1/6)L.\n\nSo, the second part of its journey is (1/6)L.\n\nNow, the new remaining distance is (2/3)L - (1/6)L. To subtract these, I need a common denominator, which is 6.\n\n(2/3)L is the same as (4/6)L, so (4/6)L - (1/6)L = (3/6)L = (1/2)L.\n\n3. Finally, it travels another fifth of the remaining distance.\n\nA fifth of the remaining distance is (1/5)(1/2)L = (1/10)L.\n\nSo, the third part of its journey is (1/10)L.\n\nNow, to find out how far the ant has traveled in total, I need to add up all the parts it has traveled:\n\nTotal distance = (1/3)L + (1/6)L + (1/10)L.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 3, 6, and 10. The least common multiple of these numbers is 30.\n\nConvert each fraction:\n\n(1/3)L = (10/30)L\n\n(1/6)L = (5/30)L\n\n(1/10)L = (3/30)L\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n(10/30)L + (5/30)L + (3/30)L = (18/30)L\n\nSimplify (18/30)L:\n\n18 and 30 can both be divided by 6, so (18 \u00f7 6)/(30 \u00f7 6) = 3/5.\n\nTherefore, the ant has traveled (3/5)L along the rope.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider an example. Suppose the rope is 30 meters long (choosing 30 because it's a multiple of 3, 6, and 10, making calculations easier).\n\nFirst travel: (1/3)*30 = 10 meters. Remaining: 30 - 10 = 20 meters.\n\nSecond travel: (1/4)*20 = 5 meters. Remaining: 20 - 5 = 15 meters.\n\nThird travel: (1/5)*15 = 3 meters.\n\nTotal traveled: 10 + 5 + 3 = 18 meters.\n\nNow, 18 meters out of 30 meters is indeed 18/30, which simplifies to 3/5.\n\nSo, the ant is now 3/5 of the way along the rope.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{5} \\text{ of the rope's length}} \\]"
