        "content": "Let's see. I have $100 to spend on fruits and vegetables, and I need to figure out how many pounds of apples I can buy, given that apples cost $1.50 per pound and oranges cost $2 per pound. Also, I have to buy at least one pound of oranges.\n\nFirst, I should note down the costs:\n\n- Apples: $1.50 per pound\n\n- Oranges: $2 per pound\n\nTotal budget: $100\n\nAnd I must buy at least one pound of oranges.\n\nI need to maximize the pounds of apples I can buy, but I have to spend some money on oranges too.\n\nLet me think about this. If I buy one pound of oranges, that will cost me $2. Then, I can spend the remaining money on apples.\n\nSo, if I buy 1 pound of oranges:\n\nCost of oranges = 1 * $2 = $2\n\nRemaining money = $100 - $2 = $98\n\nNow, with $98, how many pounds of apples can I buy?\n\nApples cost $1.50 per pound, so:\n\nPounds of apples = $98 / $1.50 per pound\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, $98 divided by $1.50.\n\nWell, dividing 98 by 1.5.\n\nI can think of it as 98 divided by 1.5.\n\nAlternatively, multiplying both numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals:\n\n9800 / 150\n\nNow, simplify that fraction.\n\nBoth 9800 and 150 can be divided by 50.\n\n9800 \u00f7 50 = 196\n\n150 \u00f7 50 = 3\n\nSo, 196 / 3 = approximately 65.333...\n\nSo, 65.333 pounds of apples.\n\nBut since I can't buy a fraction of a pound, it would be 65 pounds of apples.\n\nWait, but maybe I can buy a fraction of a pound. Let's see.\n\nActually, in real life, you might be able to buy fractions of a pound, like 65.333 pounds.\n\nBut perhaps the store only sells whole pounds.\n\nAssuming they sell in fractions, then it's 65.333 pounds.\n\nBut let's check if there's a better way to maximize the apples.\n\nWait, maybe I can buy more than one pound of oranges and see if that affects the amount of apples I can buy.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize apples, so I should minimize the amount spent on oranges.\n\nSince I have to buy at least one pound of oranges, the minimum I can spend on oranges is $2.\n\nSo, by buying one pound of oranges, I maximize the money left for apples.\n\nTherefore, the maximum pounds of apples I can buy is $98 / $1.50 = 65.333 pounds.\n\nSo, approximately 65.33 pounds of apples.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if buying more pounds of oranges affects the total apples I can buy.\n\nSuppose I buy 2 pounds of oranges:\n\nCost of oranges = 2 * $2 = $4\n\nRemaining money = $100 - $4 = $96\n\nPounds of apples = $96 / $1.50 = 64 pounds\n\nThat's less than before.\n\nSimilarly, buying more oranges would leave less money for apples, resulting in fewer pounds of apples.\n\nTherefore, to maximize apples, I should buy only one pound of oranges and use the remaining $98 to buy apples.\n\nSo, the answer is approximately 65.33 pounds of apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{65.\\overline{3}} \\]"
