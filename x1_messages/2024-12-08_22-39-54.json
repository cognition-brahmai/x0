        "content": "So the farmer has 5 chickens, and each chicken lays 3 eggs per day. We need to find out how many eggs the farmer will have after one week.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many eggs all the chickens lay in one day. Since each chicken lays 3 eggs per day, and there are 5 chickens, we can multiply the number of chickens by the number of eggs each lays per day:\n\n5 chickens * 3 eggs/chicken/day = 15 eggs per day\n\nNow, we need to find out how many eggs are laid in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so we can multiply the number of eggs laid per day by the number of days in a week:\n\n15 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 105 eggs per week\n\nSo, after one week, the farmer will have 105 eggs.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm our answer.\n\nAnother way is to consider the total number of eggs laid by all chickens over the week. Each chicken lays 3 eggs per day, so in one week, one chicken would lay:\n\n3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs per week\n\nNow, with 5 chickens, the total number of eggs would be:\n\n5 chickens * 21 eggs/chicken/week = 105 eggs per week\n\nThat matches our previous calculation, so we can be confident that 105 eggs is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, we could think of it as the total number of eggs laid per day multiplied by the number of days:\n\n15 eggs/day * 7 days = 105 eggs\n\nEither way, we end up with 105 eggs.\n\nIs there any other factor we should consider? For example, are there any eggs that might be broken or lost? The problem doesn't mention any losses, so we can assume that all the eggs laid are collected and counted.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"after one week,\" which is a clear time frame of 7 days.\n\nSo, to summarize, with 5 chickens each laying 3 eggs per day, the total number of eggs after one week would be 105 eggs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]"
