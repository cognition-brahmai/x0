        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a hotel chain with 100 hotels, each averaging 200 rooms. They're planning to renovate all these rooms over the next three years, and the cost per room is estimated at $10,000, which includes both materials and labor. The company sets aside an annual budget of $50 million for these renovations. Our tasks are to figure out how many hotels can be renovated each year within this budget and to see if they can finish all renovations within three years.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total number of rooms across all hotels. Since there are 100 hotels, each with an average of 200 rooms, the total number of rooms is:\n\n\\[\n100 \\text{ hotels} \\times 200 \\text{ rooms/hotel} = 20,000 \\text{ rooms}\n\\]\n\nNext, the cost to renovate each room is $10,000, so the total renovation cost for all rooms would be:\n\n\\[\n20,000 \\text{ rooms} \\times \\$10,000/\\text{room} = \\$200,000,000\n\\]\n\nNow, the company has an annual budget of $50 million for renovations. Over three years, the total budget available would be:\n\n\\[\n\\$50,000,000/\\text{year} \\times 3 \\text{ years} = \\$150,000,000\n\\]\n\nComparing the total renovation cost to the total budget:\n\n\\[\n\\$200,000,000 \\text{ (total cost)} > \\$150,000,000 \\text{ (total budget)}\n\\]\n\nIt's clear that the total cost exceeds the total budget by \\$50 million. So, the company won't be able to renovate all 100 hotels within three years with the current budget.\n\nBut the question also asks how many hotels can be renovated each year within the budget constraints. Let's find out.\n\nFirst, let's determine how many rooms can be renovated each year with the \\$50 million budget. Since each room costs \\$10,000 to renovate, the number of rooms that can be renovated per year is:\n\n\\[\n\\$50,000,000 / \\$10,000/\\text{room} = 5,000 \\text{ rooms/year}\n\\]\n\nGiven that each hotel has an average of 200 rooms, the number of hotels that can be renovated each year is:\n\n\\[\n5,000 \\text{ rooms/year} \\div 200 \\text{ rooms/hotel} = 25 \\text{ hotels/year}\n\\]\n\nSo, the company can renovate 25 hotels each year within the budget constraints.\n\nNow, over three years, the total number of hotels that can be renovated is:\n\n\\[\n25 \\text{ hotels/year} \\times 3 \\text{ years} = 75 \\text{ hotels}\n\\]\n\nThis means that in three years, the company can renovate 75 hotels, leaving 25 hotels unrenovated within the planned timeframe.\n\nAlternatively, if the company still wants to renovate all 100 hotels within three years, they would need to increase their annual budget. Let's calculate the required annual budget to accomplish that.\n\nFirst, the total number of rooms is 20,000, and the cost per room is \\$10,000, so the total cost is \\$200 million, as previously calculated. To complete this over three years, the annual budget required would be:\n\n\\[\n\\$200,000,000 / 3 \\text{ years} = \\$66,666,666.67 \\text{ per year}\n\\]\n\nSince the current budget is \\$50 million per year, the company would need to increase their annual budget by:\n\n\\[\n\\$66,666,666.67 - \\$50,000,000 = \\$16,666,666.67 \\text{ per year}\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, if the budget cannot be increased, the company could extend the renovation period beyond three years to accommodate the \\$50 million annual budget.\n\nFor example, to renovate all 20,000 rooms at \\$10,000 per room, the total cost is \\$200 million. With an annual budget of \\$50 million, the number of years required would be:\n\n\\[\n\\$200,000,000 / \\$50,000,000/\\text{year} = 4 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\nSo, to renovate all 100 hotels, the company would need four years with the current budget, instead of three.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- With a \\$50 million annual budget, the company can renovate 25 hotels per year.\n\n- Over three years, they can renovate 75 hotels, leaving 25 hotels unrenovated.\n\n- To renovate all 100 hotels in three years, they need to increase their annual budget to approximately \\$66.67 million.\n\n- Alternatively, they can extend the renovation period to four years with the current budget to cover all hotels.\n\nI hope this helps in planning the renovations effectively!"
