        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the theme park has a budget of $20 million to build a new roller coaster. The construction cost is $10,000 per foot of track. They want to include at least three loops, two corkscrews, and one vertical drop in the design. Each loop costs $1 million, each corkscrew costs $500,000, and the vertical drop costs $2 million. We need to find out the maximum length of the roller coaster that can be built within this budget while including all these features.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the costs involved:\n\n- Each loop: $1 million\n\n- Each corkscrew: $500,000\n\n- Vertical drop: $2 million\n\n- Track construction: $10,000 per foot\n\nThe park wants at least:\n\n- Three loops\n\n- Two corkscrews\n\n- One vertical drop\n\nSo, let's calculate the total cost for these minimum required features.\n\nCost for loops:\n\n3 loops \u00d7 $1 million per loop = $3 million\n\nCost for corkscrews:\n\n2 corkscrews \u00d7 $500,000 per corkscrew = $1 million\n\nCost for vertical drop:\n\n1 vertical drop \u00d7 $2 million = $2 million\n\nNow, add up these costs:\n\n$3 million (loops) + $1 million (corkscrews) + $2 million (vertical drop) = $6 million\n\nSo, the total cost for the required features is $6 million.\n\nThe overall budget is $20 million. Therefore, the remaining budget for the track construction is:\n\n$20 million - $6 million = $14 million\n\nNow, the construction cost is $10,000 per foot. To find out how many feet of track can be built with the remaining $14 million, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per foot:\n\n$14 million \u00f7 $10,000 per foot = 1,400 feet\n\nTherefore, the maximum length of the roller coaster that can be built within the budget, while including the desired features, is 1,400 feet.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The budget is $20 million. The features cost $6 million in total. Subtracting that leaves $14 million for the track. At $10,000 per foot, $14 million divided by $10,000 is indeed 1,400 feet.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1,400 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1400 \\text{ feet}} \\]"
