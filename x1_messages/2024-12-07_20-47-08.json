        "content": "Let's see. There's a class of 80 students, and 60% are female while 40% are male. So first, I need to find out how many females and males there are.\n\nTo find the number of females, I can calculate 60% of 80. That would be 0.6 times 80, which is 48 females. Then, for males, it's 40% of 80, so 0.4 times 80, which is 32 males.\n\nNow, 70% of the females passed the exam. So, to find out how many females passed, I'll calculate 70% of 48. That's 0.7 times 48, which equals 33.6. But since we can't have a fraction of a person, maybe I should round it to 34 females passed.\n\nSimilarly, 50% of the males passed. So, 50% of 32 is 0.5 times 32, which is 16 males passed.\n\nNow, to find the total number of students who passed, I'll add the number of females who passed to the number of males who passed: 34 plus 16 equals 50 students passed.\n\nTo find the percentage of the total class that passed, I'll divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students and then multiply by 100. So, 50 divided by 80 is 0.625, and 0.625 times 100 is 62.5%.\n\nWait a minute, I remember that in percentage calculations, we don't usually round intermediate steps. Maybe I should redo the calculations without rounding.\n\nLet's start again.\n\nNumber of females: 60% of 80 is 0.6 * 80 = 48 females.\n\nNumber of males: 40% of 80 is 0.4 * 80 = 32 males.\n\nFemales who passed: 70% of 48 is 0.7 * 48 = 33.6.\n\nMales who passed: 50% of 32 is 0.5 * 32 = 16.\n\nTotal passed: 33.6 + 16 = 49.6.\n\nPercentage of total class passed: (49.6 / 80) * 100 = 62%.\n\nBut percentages can have decimals, so 62% is fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a quicker way to do this without finding the actual numbers.\n\nLet me try.\n\nTotal percentage passed equals the sum of the percentage of females who passed plus the percentage of males who passed, each weighted by their proportion in the class.\n\nSo, it's (percentage of females * percentage of females who passed) + (percentage of males * percentage of males who passed).\n\nWait, but percentages need to be converted to decimals for this.\n\nSo, (0.6 * 0.7) for females plus (0.4 * 0.5) for males.\n\nCalculating that: 0.6 * 0.7 = 0.42, and 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.20.\n\nAdding them up: 0.42 + 0.20 = 0.62.\n\nThen, 0.62 as a percentage is 62%.\n\nSo, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the total class that passed the exam is 62%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{62\\%} \\]"
