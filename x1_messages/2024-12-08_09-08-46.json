In one corner, two strangers, JEN and MIKE, have just arrived with their dogs. Jen has a small, energetic poodle named Luna, while Mike has a large, gentle golden retriever named Max.]**\n\n**Jen:** [Unclips Luna's leash, smiling as the dog races off to explore] Finally, a day off. Maybe Luna and I can make some new friends here.\n\n**[Meanwhile, Mike is setting up a water bowl for Max, who is patiently waiting.]**\n\n**Mike:** [Softly] Okay, boy, let's find you a spot to chill.\n\n**[Luna approaches Max, wagging her tail enthusiastically. Max tilts his head, curious, and approaches her.]**\n\n**Jen:** [Watching from a distance] Oh, look, Luna seems to hit it off with that big guy.\n\n**Mike:** [Noticing Luna] Hey, little one, is she friendly?\n\n**Jen:** [Approaches] Oh, yes! Luna loves making new friends. She's a poodle, full of energy.\n\n**Mike:** [Smiles] Max here is a golden retriever. He's pretty mellow, but he loves playing.\n\n**[Luna and Max start playing, running around and chasing each other.]**\n\n**Jen:** [Laughs] They seem to be getting along great!\n\n**Mike:** [Laughs] Looks like it! Maybe we can set up playdates for them.\n\n**Jen:** [Nods] That sounds wonderful. My number's in my pocket. [Pauses, realizing she hasn't introduced herself] Oh, I'm Jen, by the way.\n\n**Mike:** [Extends his hand] Mike. Nice to meet you, Jen.\n\n**[They shake hands, smiling.]**\n\n**Jen:** So, Mike, what brings you to this dog park?\n\n**Mike:** Just needed a place for Max to run around. Work's been crazy, so I thought a day at the park would do us both good.\n\n**Jen:** Same here. Luna deserves some fun after being cooped up all week.\n\n**[They watch their dogs play for a moment.]**\n\n**Mike:** So, what do you do for a living, Jen?\n\n**Jen:** I'm a graphic designer. How about you?\n\n**Mike:** I'm a high school math teacher.\n\n**Jen:** [Surprised] Really? Math teachers are always so smart.\n\n**Mike:** [Smiles] I try my best. It's not always easy, but I love it.\n\n**[Luna brings back a stick and drops it at Mike's feet, looking up expectantly.]**\n\n**Mike:** Looks like someone wants to play fetch.\n\n**Jen:** [Laughs] That's Luna for you. She loves fetch.\n\n**[Mike throws the stick, and both dogs chase after it.]**\n\n**Jen:** So, Mike, do you have any other pets besides Max?\n\n**Mike:** Just Max for now. He's my baby.\n\n**Jen:** Same here with Luna. Although, I've been thinking about getting another one, maybe a cat.\n\n**Mike:** Oh, cats and dogs can get along, but it depends on their personalities.\n\n**Jen:** Yeah, I've seen it work in some homes. Maybe someday.\n\n**[They continue chatting, their dogs playing happily in the background.]**\n\n**Jen:** So, Mike, are you single?\n\n**Mike:** [Laughs] Uh, yeah, why do you ask?\n\n**Jen:** Just curious. With all this talk about pets and playdates, I thought maybe there's something more here.\n\n**Mike:** [Smiles] Well, maybe there is. So, Jen, would you like to grab coffee sometime?\n\n**Jen:** [Smiles back] I'd like that.\n\n**[They exchange numbers, and their dogs come back, panting and covered in grass.]**\n\n**Jen:** Well, I think Luna's had enough play for today.\n\n**Mike:** Me too. Max looks exhausted.\n\n**[They clip their dogs' leashes and start walking towards the exit.]**\n\n**Jen:** So, coffee tomorrow?\n\n**Mike:** Sounds perfect. I'll text you the details.\n\n**Jen:** Great. Can't wait.\n\n**[They share a smile as they walk out of the dog park, their dogs trotting happily by their sides.]**\n\n**[Fade out.]**"
