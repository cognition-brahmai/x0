Since the speed is given in miles per hour, we should convert the time from minutes to hours.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is equal to:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{30 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes per hour}} = 0.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, plugging the values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 60 \\text{ mph} \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours} = 30 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the car has traveled 30 miles in 30 minutes at a constant speed of 60 mph."
