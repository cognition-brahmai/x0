It\u2019s a beauty, isn\u2019t it?\n\n**Clara:** Oh, Henry, it\u2019s magnificent! But aren\u2019t we stretching our budget a bit?\n\n**Henry:** Nonsense, Clara. With my business booming, we can afford it. Besides, we deserve a treat after all these years of hard work.\n\n*Scene 2: Tom and Lily are in their room, excited about their new gadgets.*\n\n**Tom:** Check out my new laptop, Lily. It\u2019s state-of-the-art!\n\n**Lily:** Wow, Tom! Dad must have spent a fortune on that.\n\n**Tom:** He did, but he says it\u2019s an investment in my future.\n\n**Lily:** I wish I had a new phone like yours.\n\n**Tom:** Maybe for your birthday.\n\n*Scene 3: Kitchen.

The family is having dinner, somber\u6c14\u6c1b.*\n\n**Lily:** Why is everyone so quiet?\n\n**Henry:** We\u2019re just thinking about the future, Lily.\n\n**Clara:** Your father\u2019s business isn\u2019t doing as well as before.\n\n**Henry:** And I\u2019m having trouble paying some bills.\n\n**Clara:** We need to cut back on expenses.\n\n**Tom:** Maybe I can get a part-time job.\n\n**Lily:** Me too.

You\u2019re already behind on payments.\n\n**Henry:** But I promise I\u2019ll pay it all back once things turn around.\n\n**Mr. Smith:** I understand, but the bank has its policies.\n\n**Henry:** Please, Mr. Smith.

Mrs. Clara is talking to Mrs. Johnson.*\n\n**Clara:** Mrs. Johnson, I\u2019m afraid we have to let you go.\n\n**Mrs. Johnson:** What? But why?\n\n**Clara:** We can no longer afford your services, I\u2019m sorry.\n\n**Mrs. Johnson:** Alright, Mrs. Clara. It was nice working here.\n\n**Clara:** Thank you for your understanding.\n\n*Scene 3: Tom\u2019s room. Tom is receiving a call from a collection agency.*\n\n**Collection Agent:** This is regarding your outstanding credit card debt.\n\n**Tom:** But I thought my parents were covering that.\n\n**Collection Agent:** Your parents are not responsible for your debts.\n\n**Tom:** I don\u2019t have the money right now.\n\n**Collection Agent:** We\u2019ll have to take legal action if you don\u2019t pay.\n\n**Tom:** Please, can I have some time?\n\n**Collection Agent:** I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s not possible.\n\n**Act 4: The Falling Apart**\n\n*Scene 1: Living room.

I\u2019ve tried everything.\n\n*Scene 2: Kitchen. Mrs. Clara is on the phone with a friend.*\n\n**Clara:** Susan, we\u2019re in trouble. The bank is taking our house.\n\n**Friend:** I\u2019m so sorry, Clara. Maybe you can rent a place.\n\n**Clara:** We don\u2019t have the money for rent and we\u2019re all out of options.\n\n**Friend:** Maybe you can apply for government assistance.\n\n**Clara:** I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s embarrassing to accept handouts.\n\n**Friend:** Your family\u2019s well-being is more important than pride, Clara.\n\n**Clara:** You\u2019re right. I\u2019ll look into it.\n\n*Scene 3: Tom\u2019s room. Tom is applying for government assistance online.*\n\n**Tom:** This is humiliating. But we need help.\n\n**Lily:** (entering) What are you doing?\n\n**Tom:** Trying to get some financial aid for the family.\n\n**Lily:** Can it really make a difference?\n\n**Tom:** Maybe. At least it\u2019s something.\n\n**Lily:** I hope it\u2019s enough.\n\n**Act 5: The Wake-Up Call**\n\n*Scene 1: Living room. The family is watching the news.*\n\n**News Reporter:** ...and in local news, many families are struggling due to the economic downturn. Experts advise practicing fiscal responsibility and avoiding unnecessary debts...\n\n**Henry:** (sighs) If only we had listened to that advice earlier.\n\n**Clara:** We were so blinded by our desires for a better life.\n\n**Tom:** It\u2019s not too late to turn things around, right?\n\n**Lily:** Yeah, we can learn from this and do better.\n\n**Henry:** You\u2019re right, kids. We need to be more responsible with our finances.\n\n*Scene 2: Kitchen. The family is discussing a budget.*\n\n**Clara:** First, we need to list all our incomes and expenses.\n\n**Henry:** And cut back on non-essential spending.\n\n**Tom:** I can start working part-time to contribute.\n\n**Lily:** I\u2019ll look for babysitting jobs after school.\n\n**Henry:** Good, every little bit helps.\n\n**Clara:** And we need to prioritize paying off our debts.\n\n**Henry:** Yes, starting with the highest interest rates.\n\n**Scene 3: Living room. The family is researching financial literacy online.*\n\n**Tom:** There are so many resources available online.\n\n**Lily:** Like budgeting tools and financial planning courses.\n\n**Clara:** We should consider taking some classes to improve our financial knowledge.\n\n**Henry:** Absolutely. Knowledge is power, and in this case, it can help us regain control of our finances.\n\n**Epilogue**\n\n*Scene: The family is sitting together, looking more hopeful.*\n\n**Henry:** It\u2019s been a tough year, but I think we\u2019ve learned valuable lessons.\n\n**Clara:** We\u2019re stronger because of this experience.\n\n**Tom:** I\u2019m glad we\u2019re all in this together.\n\n**Lily:** Me too. Let\u2019s make smarter choices from now on.\n\n**Henry:** Agreed. From now on, we\u2019ll practice fiscal responsibility and plan for the future.\n\n**Clara:** And maybe, one day, we\u2019ll be able to rebuild our lives and achieve our dreams in a smarter way.\n\n**Tom:** I believe we can do it.\n\n**Lily:** Yeah! Together, nothing can stop us.\n\n**[End of Play]**"
