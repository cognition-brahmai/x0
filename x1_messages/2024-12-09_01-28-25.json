        "content": "**Fibonacci Generator with Recursion and Iteration**\n\nIn this Python program, we will generate Fibonacci numbers up to a given limit using two different methods: recursion and iteration. We will also measure and compare the execution times of these methods to understand their performance characteristics.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Iteration Method:**\n   - Use a loop to generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively.\n   - This method is generally more efficient in terms of time and space complexity.\n\n2. **Recursion Method:**\n   - Use a recursive function to generate Fibonacci numbers.\n   - This method is simple but can be inefficient for large limits due to repeated calculations.\n\n3. **Timing Execution:**\n   - Use the `time` module to measure the execution time of each method.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef fibonacci_iterative(limit):\n    sequence = []\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    while a <= limit:\n        sequence.append(a)\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return sequence\n\ndef fibonacci_recursive(limit):\n    def fib(n):\n        if n <= 0:\n            return []\n        elif n == 1:\n            return [0]\n        elif n == 2:\n            return [0, 1]\n        else:\n            seq = fib(n-1)\n            seq.append(seq[-1] + seq[-2])\n            return seq\n    # Find the Fibonacci sequence up to the limit\n    n = 0\n    while True:\n        fib_n = fib(n)\n        if fib_n[-1] > limit:\n            return fib_n[:-1]\n        n += 1\n\ndef main():\n    limit = int(input(\"Enter the limit for Fibonacci numbers: \"))\n    \n    # Measure execution time for iterative method\n    start_time = time.time()\n    iterative_result = fibonacci_iterative(limit)\n    end_time = time.time()\n    iterative_time = end_time - start_time\n    print(\"Iterative Method - Fibonacci sequence up to\", limit, \":\", iterative_result)\n    print(\"Execution time:\", iterative_time, \"seconds\")\n    \n    # Measure execution time for recursive method\n    start_time = time.time()\n    recursive_result = fibonacci_recursive(limit)\n    end_time = time.time()\n    recursive_time = end_time - start_time\n    print(\"\\nRecursive Method - Fibonacci sequence up to\", limit, \":\", recursive_result)\n    print(\"Execution time:\", recursive_time, \"seconds\")\n    \n    # Compare execution times\n    if iterative_time < recursive_time:\n        print(\"\\nIterative method is faster by\", recursive_time - iterative_time, \"seconds\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nRecursive method is faster by\", iterative_time - recursive_time, \"seconds\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Iterative Method:**\n   - We initialize two variables, `a` and `b`, to 0 and 1 respectively.\n   - We use a while loop to generate Fibonacci numbers until the limit is reached.\n   - Each new number is calculated as the sum of the two preceding ones.\n\n2. **Recursive Method:**\n   - We define a helper function `fib(n)` that generates the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.\n   - We increment `n` until the last Fibonacci number exceeds the limit.\n   - This method is less efficient due to repeated calculations in the recursion tree.\n\n3. **Timing Execution:**\n   - We use `time.time()` to record the start and end times for each method.\n   - The execution time is calculated by subtracting the start time from the end time.\n\nBy comparing the execution times, we can observe that the iterative method is significantly faster than the recursive method for larger limits due to the overhead of recursive function calls."
