        "content": "To develop a SQL script that finds the most popular products in each category, we need to make some assumptions about the database schema. Let's assume we have the following tables:\n\n1. **Categories**:\n   - CategoryID (Primary Key)\n   - CategoryName\n\n2. **Products**:\n   - ProductID (Primary Key)\n   - ProductName\n   - CategoryID (Foreign Key referencing Categories(CategoryID))\n\n3. **Orders**:\n   - OrderID (Primary Key)\n   - ProductID (Foreign Key referencing Products(ProductID))\n   - Quantity\n   - OrderDate\n\nOur goal is to find the most popular product in each category, where popularity is determined by the total quantity sold.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Join Tables**: Join the Products and Orders tables to get the quantity sold for each product.\n2. **Group and Sum**: Group the results by product and sum the quantities to get total sales per product.\n3. **Rank Products**: For each category, rank the products based on their total sales.\n4. **Select Top Product**: Select the top-ranked product in each category.\n\n### Solution SQL Script\n\n```sql\nWITH ProductSales AS (\n    SELECT\n        p.ProductID,\n        p.ProductName,\n        p.CategoryID,\n        SUM(o.Quantity) AS TotalSales\n    FROM\n        Products p\n    JOIN\n        Orders o ON p.ProductID = o.ProductID\n    GROUP BY\n        p.ProductID, p.ProductName, p.CategoryID\n),\nRankedProducts AS (\n    SELECT\n        ps.CategoryID,\n        ps.ProductID,\n        ps.ProductName,\n        ps.TotalSales,\n        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ps.CategoryID ORDER BY ps.TotalSales DESC) AS SalesRank\n    FROM\n        ProductSales ps\n)\nSELECT\n    r.CategoryID,\n    c.CategoryName,\n    r.ProductID,\n    r.ProductName,\n    r.TotalSales\nFROM\n    RankedProducts r\nJOIN\n    Categories c ON r.CategoryID = c.CategoryID\nWHERE\n    r.SalesRank = 1;\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **ProductSales CTE**:\n   - Joins the Products and Orders tables.\n   - Groups the results by product and calculates the total quantity sold for each product.\n\n2. **RankedProducts CTE**:\n   - Uses the RANK() window function to assign a rank to each product within its category based on total sales.\n   - Products with higher total sales get a rank of 1.\n\n3. **Final SELECT**:\n   - Joins the RankedProducts CTE with the Categories table to get category names.\n   - Selects only the top-ranked products (rank = 1) in each category.\n\nThis script will provide a list of the most popular products in each category based on the total quantity sold."
