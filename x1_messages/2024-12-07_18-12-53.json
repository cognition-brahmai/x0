        "content": "So I have this problem here: find the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = |x - 3|. At first glance, I know that Fourier series are used to represent periodic functions as a sum of sines and cosines. But f(x) = |x - 3| doesn't look periodic. Hmm, maybe I need to consider it over a specific interval and then extend it periodically.\n\nLet me recall that a Fourier series for a function defined on an interval can be found by extending the function to be periodic outside that interval. So, I need to decide on a period for this function. Perhaps the problem expects me to consider f(x) over an interval like [-L, L] or [0, L], and then extend it periodically.\n\nWait, the function f(x) = |x - 3| is defined for all real x, but it's not periodic unless we make it so. Maybe I should assume that the function is periodic with some period, say 2L, and then find its Fourier series over one period.\n\nLet me choose to consider f(x) over the interval [0, 6], making it a period of 6. So, L = 3. Then, I can extend f(x) to be periodic with period 6 outside this interval.\n\nFirst, I need to sketch the function over one period to see its behavior. From x = 0 to x = 6, f(x) = |x - 3|, which is a V-shaped graph with its vertex at (3, 0). It decreases linearly from (0, 3) to (3, 0), and then increases linearly from (3, 0) to (6, 3).\n\nSince I've chosen a period of 6, I should define f(x) over one period and then extend it periodically.\n\nNow, to find the Fourier series, I need to compute the Fourier coefficients a\u2080, a\u2099, and b\u2099.\n\nThe general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a\u2080/2 + \u03a3 [a\u2099 cos(n\u03c9x) + b\u2099 sin(n\u03c9x)]\n\nwhere \u03c9 = 2\u03c0/L, and L = 3 in this case.\n\nSo, \u03c9 = 2\u03c0/3.\n\nThe coefficients are given by:\n\na\u2080 = (1/L) \u222b[f(x)]dx from 0 to 2L, but since L = 3, it's from 0 to 6.\n\na\u2099 = (1/L) \u222b[f(x) cos(n\u03c9x)]dx from 0 to 2L.\n\nb\u2099 = (1/L) \u222b[f(x) sin(n\u03c9x)]dx from 0 to 2L.\n\nWait, actually, for a function defined over [0, L], the Fourier series can be expressed in terms of cosines (Fourier cosine series) if extended evenly, or in terms of sines (Fourier sine series) if extended oddly. But since I'm choosing a period of 2L = 6, L = 3, I'll use the full Fourier series.\n\nBut looking back, f(x) = |x - 3| is an even function about x = 3 over the interval [0, 6]. That suggests that the Fourier series might have only cosine terms, because cosines are even functions.\n\nWait, let me check if f(x) is even about x = 3.\n\nAn even function satisfies f(a + x) = f(a - x). Here, a = 3.\n\nSo, f(3 + x) = |(3 + x) - 3| = |x| = x (since x >= 0 in [0, 6]).\n\nf(3 - x) = |(3 - x) - 3| = |-x| = x.\n\nSo, f(3 + x) = f(3 - x), which confirms that f(x) is even about x = 3.\n\nTherefore, the Fourier series should contain only cosine terms and possibly a constant term.\n\nThat means b\u2099 = 0 for all n.\n\nAnd a\u2099 can be calculated using the formula for even functions.\n\nActually, since the function is even about x = 3, and I'm extending it periodically with period 6, I can consider it as an even function over the interval [-3, 3], and then extend it periodically with period 6.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider a Fourier cosine series over [0, 3], but since I chose a period of 6, I'll stick with the full Fourier series approach.\n\nFirst, let's compute a\u2080:\n\na\u2080 = (1/3) \u222b[|x - 3|]dx from 0 to 6.\n\nI need to split the integral at x = 3, where the expression inside the absolute value changes.\n\nSo, a\u2080 = (1/3) [\u222b(3 - x)dx from 0 to 3 + \u222b(x - 3)dx from 3 to 6].\n\nLet's compute each part:\n\n\u222b(3 - x)dx from 0 to 3 = [3x - (x\u00b2)/2] from 0 to 3 = (9 - 9/2) - 0 = 9/2.\n\n\u222b(x - 3)dx from 3 to 6 = [ (x\u00b2)/2 - 3x ] from 3 to 6 = (18 - 18) - (9/2 - 9) = 0 - (-9/2) = 9/2.\n\nSo, a\u2080 = (1/3)(9/2 + 9/2) = (1/3)(9) = 3.\n\nNow, let's compute a\u2099:\n\na\u2099 = (1/3) \u222b[|x - 3| cos(n(2\u03c0/3)x)]dx from 0 to 6.\n\nAgain, split the integral at x = 3:\n\na\u2099 = (1/3) [\u222b(3 - x) cos(n(2\u03c0/3)x) dx from 0 to 3 + \u222b(x - 3) cos(n(2\u03c0/3)x) dx from 3 to 6].\n\nThese integrals look a bit tricky, but I can proceed by parts.\n\nLet me denote \u03c9 = 2\u03c0/3, so n\u03c9 = (2\u03c0n)/3.\n\nFirst integral: \u222b(3 - x) cos(n\u03c9x) dx from 0 to 3.\n\nLet me set u = 3 - x, dv = cos(n\u03c9x) dx.\n\nThen, du = -dx, v = (1/(n\u03c9)) sin(n\u03c9x).\n\nUsing integration by parts: uv - \u222bv du = (3 - x)(1/(n\u03c9)) sin(n\u03c9x) from 0 to 3 + \u222b(1/(n\u03c9)) sin(n\u03c9x) dx from 0 to 3.\n\nEvaluate the first term:\n\nAt x = 3: (0)(1/(n\u03c9)) sin(3n\u03c9) = 0.\n\nAt x = 0: (3)(1/(n\u03c9)) sin(0) = 0.\n\nSo, the first term is zero.\n\nNow, the integral \u222b(1/(n\u03c9)) sin(n\u03c9x) dx from 0 to 3.\n\nThis is (1/(n\u03c9)) [- (1/(n\u03c9)) cos(n\u03c9x)] from 0 to 3.\n\nSimplify: - (1/(n\u03c9))\u00b2 [cos(3n\u03c9) - cos(0)] = - (1/(n\u03c9)^2) [cos(2\u03c0n) - 1].\n\nSince cos(2\u03c0n) = 1 for all integer n, this becomes - (1/(n\u03c9)^2) [1 - 1] = 0.\n\nWait, that's interesting. The first part of a\u2099 seems to be zero.\n\nNow, the second integral: \u222b(x - 3) cos(n\u03c9x) dx from 3 to 6.\n\nSimilarly, set u = x - 3, dv = cos(n\u03c9x) dx.\n\nThen, du = dx, v = (1/(n\u03c9)) sin(n\u03c9x).\n\nIntegration by parts: uv - \u222bv du = (x - 3)(1/(n\u03c9)) sin(n\u03c9x) from 3 to 6 - \u222b(1/(n\u03c9)) sin(n\u03c9x) dx from 3 to 6.\n\nEvaluate the first term:\n\nAt x = 6: (3)(1/(n\u03c9)) sin(6n\u03c9) = 3/(n\u03c9) sin(4\u03c0n).\n\nSince sin(4\u03c0n) = 0 for all integer n, this is zero.\n\nAt x = 3: (0)(1/(n\u03c9)) sin(3n\u03c9) = 0.\n\nSo, again, the first term is zero.\n\nNow, the integral: - \u222b(1/(n\u03c9)) sin(n\u03c9x) dx from 3 to 6.\n\nThis is - (1/(n\u03c9)) [- (1/(n\u03c9)) cos(n\u03c9x)] from 3 to 6.\n\nSimplify: (1/(n\u03c9)^2) [cos(6n\u03c9) - cos(3n\u03c9)].\n\nNow, \u03c9 = 2\u03c0/3, so 6n\u03c9 = 4\u03c0n, and 3n\u03c9 = 2\u03c0n.\n\nThus, cos(4\u03c0n) - cos(2\u03c0n).\n\nBut cos(4\u03c0n) = cos(2*2\u03c0n) = 2cos\u00b2(2\u03c0n) - 1 = 2(1)^2 - 1 = 1.\n\nAnd cos(2\u03c0n) = 1.\n\nTherefore, 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nSo, this integral is also zero.\n\nWait, both parts of a\u2099 are zero? That can't be right, because then the Fourier series would only have a constant term, which is 3, but f(x) = |x - 3| is not a constant function.\n\nI must have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the integration by parts.\n\nFirst integral: \u222b(3 - x) cos(n\u03c9x) dx from 0 to 3.\n\nSet u = 3 - x, dv = cos(n\u03c9x) dx.\n\nThen, du = -dx, v = (1/(n\u03c9)) sin(n\u03c9x).\n\nIntegration by parts: uv - \u222bv du = (3 - x)(1/(n\u03c9)) sin(n\u03c9x) from 0 to 3 + \u222b(1/(n\u03c9)) sin(n\u03c9x) dx from 0 to 3.\n\nAt x = 3: 0.\n\nAt x = 0: 3*(1/(n\u03c9)) sin(0) = 0.\n\nSo, the first term is zero.\n\nNow, the integral \u222b(1/(n\u03c9)) sin(n\u03c9x) dx from 0 to 3.\n\nThis is (1/(n\u03c9)) [- (1/(n\u03c9)) cos(n\u03c9x)] from 0 to 3.\n\nWhich is - (1/(n\u03c9)^2) [cos(3n\u03c9) - cos(0)] = - (1/(n\u03c9)^2) [cos(2\u03c0n) - 1] = - (1/(n\u03c9)^2) [1 - 1] = 0.\n\nSimilarly, for the second integral: \u222b(x - 3) cos(n\u03c9x) dx from 3 to 6.\n\nSet u = x - 3, dv = cos(n\u03c9x) dx.\n\nThen, du = dx, v = (1/(n\u03c9)) sin(n\u03c9x).\n\nIntegration by parts: uv - \u222bv du = (x - 3)(1/(n\u03c9)) sin(n\u03c9x) from 3 to 6 - \u222b(1/(n\u03c9)) sin(n\u03c9x) dx from 3 to 6.\n\nAt x = 6: 3*(1/(n\u03c9)) sin(4\u03c0n) = 0.\n\nAt x = 3: 0.\n\nSo, the first term is zero.\n\nNow, the integral: - \u222b(1/(n\u03c9)) sin(n\u03c9x) dx from 3 to 6.\n\nThis is - (1/(n\u03c9)) [- (1/(n\u03c9)) cos(n\u03c9x)] from 3 to 6.\n\nWhich is (1/(n\u03c9)^2) [cos(6n\u03c9) - cos(3n\u03c9)] = (1/(n\u03c9)^2) [cos(4\u03c0n) - cos(2\u03c0n)] = (1/(n\u03c9)^2) [1 - 1] = 0.\n\nHmm, both integrals are zero, which implies that a\u2099 = 0 for all n.\n\nBut this can't be right because the Fourier series would only have a constant term, which doesn't match f(x) = |x - 3|.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the period is 6. Maybe I should choose a different period.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider f(x) over a different interval.\n\nLet me try considering f(x) over [-3, 3], which would make L = 3, and then extend it periodically with period 6.\n\nBut earlier, I saw that the function is even about x = 3. Maybe I need to shift the function to make it even about x = 0.\n\nLet me try making a substitution: let t = x - 3, then f(t) = |t|, and I can consider t \u2208 [-3, 3], which corresponds to x \u2208 [0, 6].\n\nNow, f(t) = |t| over [-3, 3], extended periodically with period 6.\n\nSince f(t) = |t| is even, its Fourier series will only contain cosine terms.\n\nSo, in terms of t, the Fourier series is:\n\nf(t) = a\u2080/2 + \u03a3 a\u2099 cos(n\u03c0t/L),\n\nwhere L = 3, and \u03c9 = n\u03c0/L = n\u03c0/3.\n\nThe coefficients are:\n\na\u2080 = (1/L) \u222b|t| dt from -L to L = (1/3) \u222b|t| dt from -3 to 3 = (2/3) \u222bt dt from 0 to 3 = (2/3)(9/2) = 3.\n\na\u2099 = (1/L) \u222b|t| cos(n\u03c0t/L) dt from -L to L = (2/L) \u222b|t| cos(n\u03c0t/L) dt from 0 to L.\n\nSince f(t) is even.\n\nSo, a\u2099 = (2/3) \u222bt cos(n\u03c0t/3) dt from 0 to 3.\n\nNow, let's compute this integral.\n\nLet me use integration by parts.\n\nSet u = t, dv = cos(n\u03c0t/3) dt.\n\nThen, du = dt, v = (3/(n\u03c0)) sin(n\u03c0t/3).\n\nIntegration by parts: uv from 0 to 3 - \u222bv du from 0 to 3.\n\nWhich is [t*(3/(n\u03c0)) sin(n\u03c0t/3)] from 0 to 3 - \u222b(3/(n\u03c0)) sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt from 0 to 3.\n\nEvaluate the first term:\n\nAt t = 3: 3*(3/(n\u03c0)) sin(n\u03c0) = 0.\n\nAt t = 0: 0.\n\nSo, the first term is zero.\n\nNow, the integral: - (3/(n\u03c0)) \u222bsin(n\u03c0t/3) dt from 0 to 3.\n\nThis is - (3/(n\u03c0)) [- (3/(n\u03c0)) cos(n\u03c0t/3)] from 0 to 3.\n\nSimplify: (9/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2)) [cos(n\u03c0) - cos(0)] = (9/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2)) [(-1)^n - 1].\n\nTherefore, a\u2099 = (2/3)*(9/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2))[(-1)^n - 1] = (6/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2))[(-1)^n - 1].\n\nNow, notice that for even n, (-1)^n - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nFor odd n, (-1)^n - 1 = -1 - 1 = -2.\n\nTherefore, a\u2099 = { -12/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) for odd n, 0 for even n }.\n\nSo, the Fourier series for f(t) = |t| is:\n\nf(t) = 3/2 - (12/\u03c0\u00b2) \u03a3 [1/n\u00b2 cos(n\u03c0t/3)] for n odd.\n\nNow, recalling that t = x - 3, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = |x - 3| as:\n\nf(x) = 3/2 - (12/\u03c0\u00b2) \u03a3 [1/n\u00b2 cos(n\u03c0(x - 3)/3)] for n odd.\n\nSimplify the argument of cosine:\n\ncos(n\u03c0(x - 3)/3) = cos(n\u03c0x/3 - n\u03c0).\n\nSince cos(\u03b8 - n\u03c0) = (-1)^n cos\u03b8, we have:\n\ncos(n\u03c0x/3 - n\u03c0) = (-1)^n cos(n\u03c0x/3).\n\nTherefore, the Fourier series becomes:\n\nf(x) = 3/2 - (12/\u03c0\u00b2) \u03a3 [1/n\u00b2 (-1)^n cos(n\u03c0x/3)] for n odd.\n\nBut (-1)^n for odd n is -1, so:\n\nf(x) = 3/2 + (12/\u03c0\u00b2) \u03a3 [1/n\u00b2 cos(n\u03c0x/3)] for n odd.\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of f(x) = |x - 3| with period 6 is:\n\nf(x) = 3/2 + (12/\u03c0\u00b2) \u03a3 [1/n\u00b2 cos(n\u03c0x/3)] for n = 1, 3, 5, ...\n\nThat seems more reasonable. Let me verify this by checking if it matches f(x) at a specific point.\n\nFor example, at x = 3, f(x) = 0.\n\nPlugging x = 3 into the series:\n\nf(3) = 3/2 + (12/\u03c0\u00b2) \u03a3 [1/n\u00b2 cos(n\u03c0)].\n\nSince cos(n\u03c0) = (-1)^n, this becomes:\n\nf(3) = 3/2 + (12/\u03c0\u00b2) \u03a3 [1/n\u00b2 (-1)^n] for n odd.\n\nWait, but n is odd, so (-1)^n = -1.\n\nThus, f(3) = 3/2 - (12/\u03c0\u00b2) \u03a3 [1/n\u00b2] for n odd.\n\nNow, the sum of 1/n\u00b2 for n odd is \u03c0\u00b2/8.\n\nSo, f(3) = 3/2 - (12/\u03c0\u00b2)(\u03c0\u00b2/8) = 3/2 - 12/8 = 3/2 - 3/2 = 0, which matches f(3) = 0.\n\nAnother check: at x = 0, f(0) = 3.\n\nPlugging x = 0 into the series:\n\nf(0) = 3/2 + (12/\u03c0\u00b2) \u03a3 [1/n\u00b2 cos(0)] for n odd.\n\nCos(0) = 1, so:\n\nf(0) = 3/2 + (12/\u03c0\u00b2) \u03a3 [1/n\u00b2] for n odd.\n\nAgain, \u03a3 [1/n\u00b2] for n odd is \u03c0\u00b2/8.\n\nSo, f(0) = 3/2 + (12/\u03c0\u00b2)(\u03c0\u00b2/8) = 3/2 + 12/8 = 3/2 + 3/2 = 3, which matches f(0) = 3.\n\nTherefore, the Fourier series seems correct.\n\nIn summary, the Fourier series representation of f(x) = |x - 3| with period 6 is:\n\nf(x) = 3/2 + (12/\u03c0\u00b2) \u03a3 [1/n\u00b2 cos(n\u03c0x/3)] for n = 1, 3, 5, ...\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{f(x) = \\dfrac{3}{2} + \\dfrac{12}{\\pi^2} \\sum_{n=1,3,5,\\ldots}^\\infty \\dfrac{\\cos\\left(\\dfrac{n\\pi x}{3}\\right)}{n^2}}"
