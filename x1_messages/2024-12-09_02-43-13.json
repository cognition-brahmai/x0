        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Let's go through each task one by one.\n\n1. **Find all records without duplicates.**\n\n   To find all unique records in a table, you can use the `DISTINCT` keyword in your SQL query. Suppose you have a table named `employees` with columns like `id`, `name`, `department`, etc., and you want to find all unique combinations of `name` and `department`, you can write:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT DISTINCT name, department FROM employees;\n   ```\n\n   If you want to select all columns but without duplicate records based on all columns, you can do:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT DISTINCT * FROM employees;\n   ```\n\n   However, using `DISTINCT` with multiple columns can be resource-intensive if the table is large, so use it wisely.\n\n2. **Count the number of records in each category.**\n\n   To count the number of records in each category, you can use the `GROUP BY` clause along with the `COUNT()` aggregate function. Assuming you have a table `sales` with columns `category` and `amount`, and you want to count how many sales records there are in each category, you can write:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT category, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM sales GROUP BY category;\n   ```\n\n   This will give you a list of categories along with the count of records in each.\n\n3. **Retrieve the average, minimum, and maximum values of a specific column.**\n\n   To calculate the average, minimum, and maximum values of a numeric column, you can use the `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()` aggregate functions respectively. For example, if you have a `products` table with a `price` column, and you want to find the average, minimum, and maximum prices, you can write:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT AVG(price) as average_price, MIN(price) as min_price, MAX(price) as max_price FROM products;\n   ```\n\n   This will return a single row with the average, minimum, and maximum prices.\n\n4. **Select records where a certain field matches a pattern.**\n\n   To select records based on a pattern in a text field, you can use the `LIKE` operator. Suppose you have a `customers` table with a `name` column, and you want to find all customers whose names start with 'A', you can write:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name LIKE 'A%';\n   ```\n\n   Here, `%` is a wildcard that matches any sequence of characters. So 'A%' matches any name that starts with 'A'.\n\n   If you want to match names that contain 'an' anywhere in the name, you can use:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name LIKE '%an%';\n   ```\n\n   You can also use the `NOT LIKE` operator to exclude records that match a certain pattern.\n\n5. **Update certain fields of selected records.**\n\n   To update specific fields of records that meet certain conditions, you can use the `UPDATE` statement along with the `SET` keyword and a `WHERE` clause to specify the conditions. For example, if you have an `employees` table and you want to update the `salary` of employees in the 'Sales' department to 50000, you can write:\n\n   ```sql\n   UPDATE employees SET salary = 50000 WHERE department = 'Sales';\n   ```\n\n   Be very careful with `UPDATE` statements, especially when omitting the `WHERE` clause, as it can modify all records in the table.\n\n   If you need to update multiple fields, you can list them separated by commas:\n\n   ```sql\n   UPDATE employees SET salary = 50000, position = 'Senior Sales Associate' WHERE department = 'Sales';\n   ```\n\n   Always make sure to backup your data or use transactions if possible, to avoid accidental data loss or corruption.\n\nI hope these examples help you with your SQL tasks! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask."
