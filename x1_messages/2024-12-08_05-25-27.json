        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a shirt that's originally $40, and it's on sale for 25% off. Then, after the discount, there's a 7% tax applied. I need to find out what the final cost of the shirt is after both the discount and the tax.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the discount. The shirt is 25% off, so I need to find out what 25% of $40 is and then subtract that from the original price.\n\nTo find 25% of $40, I can multiply 40 by 0.25 (since 25% equals 0.25 in decimal form).\n\nSo, 40 times 0.25 is 10. That means the discount is $10.\n\nNow, I subtract the discount from the original price: $40 minus $10 equals $30. So, the shirt costs $30 after the discount.\n\nNext, I need to apply the 7% tax to the discounted price. To find 7% of $30, I can multiply 30 by 0.07 (since 7% equals 0.07 in decimal form).\n\n30 times 0.07 is 2.1. So, the tax amount is $2.10.\n\nFinally, I add the tax to the discounted price: $30 plus $2.10 equals $32.10.\n\nTherefore, the final cost of the shirt after the discount and tax is $32.10.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that. Sometimes, taxes are applied before the discount, but in this case, it says the tax is applied after the discount, so I think I did it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it differently. Maybe there's a way to calculate it in fewer steps.\n\nLet's see: the shirt is 25% off, so the customer pays 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).\n\nSo, 75% of $40 is $30, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, applying a 7% tax to $30, which is $2.10, bringing the total to $32.10.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the final cost as the original price multiplied by the discount rate and then multiplied by 1 plus the tax rate.\n\nSo, that would be $40 times 0.75 (which is the discount rate) times 1.07 (which is 1 plus the tax rate).\n\nLet me calculate that: 40 times 0.75 is 30, and 30 times 1.07 is 32.10. So, same result.\n\nAlternatively, if I do it in one step: 40 times 0.75 times 1.07 equals 32.10.\n\nYes, that works too.\n\nI think $32.10 is the correct final cost of the shirt after the discount and tax.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32.10} \\]"
