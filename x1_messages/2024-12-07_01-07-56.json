        "content": "The theory that posits states are the primary actors in the international system, acting out of self-interest and that power is the primary determinant of international relations is Realism. So, the answer is A. Realism.\n\nRealism in international relations is a theory that emphasizes the role of power in global affairs. It assumes that states are the main actors in the international system and that they act according to their own interests, often defined in terms of power and security. Realists believe that the international system is anarchic, meaning there is no central authority above states to enforce rules or resolve disputes, so states must rely on their own capabilities to ensure their survival and security.\n\nThis perspective contrasts with other theories like Liberalism, which emphasizes the role of institutions, cooperation, and interdependence among states; Constructivism, which focuses on the influence of ideas, identities, and social constructs on state behavior; and Marxism, which analyzes international relations through the lens of economic class struggle and material inequalities.\n\nSo, in summary, if you're looking for the theory that highlights state interests and power as the key drivers in international relations, Realism is the one."
