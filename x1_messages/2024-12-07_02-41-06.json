        "content": "So the baker makes 12 loaves of bread every hour. We want to know how many loaves he makes in a week. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many hours the baker works in a week. But the problem doesn't specify how many hours he works each day or how many days he works. Maybe he works every hour of every day, or maybe he has a regular 8-hour workday. Since it's not specified, I'll have to make an assumption here.\n\nLet's assume the baker works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, which is a standard workweek. That seems reasonable for a baker. So, 8 hours a day times 5 days a week is 40 hours per week.\n\nNow, if he makes 12 loaves every hour, and he works 40 hours a week, then the total number of loaves per week would be 12 loaves/hour times 40 hours/week.\n\nLet me do the math: 12 times 40 is 480 loaves per week.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe he works more hours. Perhaps he works weekends too. Or maybe he works longer hours each day. The problem doesn't say, so maybe I should consider a full 24/7 operation.\n\nIf the baker works 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, then the total hours per week would be 24 hours/day times 7 days/week, which is 168 hours/week.\n\nThen, at 12 loaves per hour, the total weekly production would be 12 loaves/hour times 168 hours/week, which is 2,016 loaves per week.\n\nBut that seems like a lot. Maybe the baker doesn't work all hours of the day and every day of the week.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the baker works only during standard business hours, say 10 hours a day, 5 days a week. Then, 10 hours/day times 5 days/week is 50 hours/week.\n\nAt 12 loaves per hour, that would be 600 loaves per week.\n\nBut I'm just making assumptions here about his work schedule. Maybe I should consider that he might work different hours each day.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the baker works a certain number of hours each day, but takes some days off. Without specific information, it's hard to pin down exactly how many hours he works in a week.\n\nMaybe another approach is to consider that \"every hour\" means continuously, around the clock. In that case, he's making 12 loaves each hour, non-stop.\n\nIf that's the case, then in a week, which has 168 hours (24 hours/day times 7 days), he would make 12 loaves/hour times 168 hours/week, which again is 2,016 loaves per week.\n\nBut perhaps \"every hour\" doesn't mean continuously, non-stop. Maybe he only works certain hours each day.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the baker makes 12 loaves in an hour, but he doesn't work every hour. Maybe he has breaks or other tasks.\n\nThis is getting complicated because of the lack of specific information about his work schedule.\n\nMaybe I should consider that he makes 12 loaves per hour, and we're to assume that he works a certain number of hours per day or per week.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a more theoretical approach, without considering actual work hours.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simpler than I'm making it. Maybe it's assuming that the baker works constantly, producing 12 loaves every hour, with no breaks.\n\nIn that case, in a week, which has 168 hours, he would make 12 loaves each hour, so 12 times 168 is 2,016 loaves.\n\nBut that seems like a lot, and perhaps unrealistic for a single baker to work non-stop for a week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the baker works a standard number of hours per day, say 8 hours a day, and works 7 days a week.\n\nSo, 8 hours/day times 7 days/week is 56 hours/week.\n\nAt 12 loaves per hour, that would be 672 loaves per week.\n\nStill, without specific information about his work schedule, it's hard to give an exact answer.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects me to assume a certain number of hours worked per day or per week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to test my ability to handle units and conversions.\n\nLet's see: 12 loaves per hour, and we need to find out how many loaves in a week.\n\nFirst, there are 24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week, so 24 times 7 is 168 hours in a week.\n\nSo, if he makes 12 loaves every hour, then in 168 hours, he would make 12 times 168 loaves.\n\nLet me calculate that: 12 times 168.\n\nWell, 12 times 100 is 1,200, 12 times 60 is 720, and 12 times 8 is 96. So, 1,200 plus 720 is 1,920, plus 96 is 2,016 loaves.\n\nSo, 2,016 loaves per week.\n\nBut, like I thought earlier, that seems like a lot for one baker to produce in a week, working non-stop.\n\nMaybe the problem expects me to consider that the baker only works during certain hours.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"12 loaves every hour\" is an average production rate, considering his actual working hours.\n\nIn that case, maybe the 12 loaves per hour already factors in his working hours, breaks, etc.\n\nIf that's the case, then multiplying 12 loaves/hour by 168 hours/week would give 2,016 loaves per week.\n\nBut again, that seems high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the baker works a standard 40-hour workweek, in which case, 12 loaves/hour times 40 hours/week is 480 loaves per week.\n\nThat seems more reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the baker works 6 days a week, 10 hours each day, which is 60 hours/week.\n\nThen, 12 loaves/hour times 60 hours/week is 720 loaves per week.\n\nStill, without specific information about his work schedule, it's difficult to determine the exact number.\n\nPerhaps the problem is designed to make me realize that without knowing the work hours, I can't give a precise answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the baker works continuously, 24/7, in which case, 12 loaves/hour times 168 hours/week is 2,016 loaves per week.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"every hour\" means only during his working hours, and he doesn't work every hour of the day.\n\nThis is getting too confusing.\n\nMaybe I should just go with the multiplication of 12 loaves/hour times 168 hours/week, assuming continuous operation, which gives 2,016 loaves per week.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the baker cannot work more than a certain number of hours per day or per week.\n\nBut again, without specific information, it's hard to say.\n\nPerhaps I should look for another way to approach this problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is testing my understanding of units and conversions.\n\nSo, if the baker makes 12 loaves per hour, and there are 168 hours in a week, then the total loaves per week would be 12 times 168, which is 2,016 loaves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the baker doesn't work every hour of the week, and I need to consider his actual working hours.\n\nBut again, without knowing his work schedule, I can't adjust the calculation accordingly.\n\nMaybe the problem intends for me to assume that the baker works a standard 40-hour workweek, in which case, 12 loaves/hour times 40 hours/week is 480 loaves per week.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the baker works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, which is also 40 hours/week, leading to the same result.\n\nAlternatively, if he works 8 hours a day, 6 days a week, that's 48 hours/week, resulting in 576 loaves per week.\n\nAlternatively, 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, is 50 hours/week, resulting in 600 loaves per week.\n\nAlternatively, 12 hours a day, 5 days a week, is 60 hours/week, resulting in 720 loaves per week.\n\nAlternatively, if he works 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, that's 72 hours/week, resulting in 864 loaves per week.\n\nAlternatively, 14 hours a day, 6 days a week, is 84 hours/week, resulting in 1,008 loaves per week.\n\nAlternatively, if he works 16 hours a day, 7 days a week, that's 112 hours/week, resulting in 1,344 loaves per week.\n\nAlternatively, if he works 18 hours a day, 7 days a week, that's 126 hours/week, resulting in 1,512 loaves per week.\n\nAlternatively, if he works 20 hours a day, 7 days a week, that's 140 hours/week, resulting in 1,680 loaves per week.\n\nAlternatively, if he works 22 hours a day, 7 days a week, that's 154 hours/week, resulting in 1,848 loaves per week.\n\nFinally, if he works 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, that's 168 hours/week, resulting in 2,016 loaves per week.\n\nGiven these possibilities, the number of loaves per week could range from 480 to 2,016, depending on his work schedule.\n\nBut without specifying his work hours, it's impossible to pinpoint the exact number.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects me to assume that he works 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, making 2,016 loaves per week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a trick question, and the answer is simply 12 loaves per hour times 168 hours in a week, equaling 2,016 loaves.\n\nBut, realistically, it's unlikely that a single baker would work non-stop for an entire week.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is testing my ability to question the given information and consider realistic scenarios.\n\nIn any case, based on the information provided, the best answer is that the baker makes 2,016 loaves per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2016} \\]"
