        "content": "So I've got this problem here: In a town, 70% of the people speak English, 65% speak Spanish, and 45% speak both languages. I need to find out what percentage of the town speaks at least one of these two languages. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nI remember there's a principle in set theory called the inclusion-exclusion principle that might be useful here. It's a way to calculate the total number of elements in the union of two sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets and then subtracting the size of their intersection to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, if I let E be the set of people who speak English and S be the set of people who speak Spanish, then:\n\n- The percentage who speak English is |E| = 70%\n\n- The percentage who speak Spanish is |S| = 65%\n\n- The percentage who speak both is |E \u2229 S| = 45%\n\nI need to find the percentage who speak at least one of these languages, which is the union of E and S, or |E \u222a S|.\n\nAccording to the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n|E \u222a S| = |E| + |S| - |E \u2229 S|\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n|E \u222a S| = 70% + 65% - 45% = 90%\n\nSo, 90% of the town speaks at least one of the two languages.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If 70% speak English and 65% speak Spanish, and 45% speak both, then adding 70% and 65% would give me 135%, but that includes the people who speak both languages twice. So, to correct for that, I subtract the 45% who speak both, which brings it down to 90%. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the people who only speak English, only speak Spanish, and those who speak both. The percentage who only speak English would be 70% - 45% = 25%, and only speak Spanish would be 65% - 45% = 20%. Then, adding those who only speak English, only speak Spanish, and speak both: 25% + 20% + 45% = 90%, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nIs there another way to verify this? Maybe by considering the percentage who don't speak either language. If 90% speak at least one language, then 10% don't speak either. Is there a way to confirm that?\n\nWell, if I had information about people who don't speak either language, I could check, but the problem doesn't provide that directly. So, perhaps it's best to stick with the inclusion-exclusion approach.\n\nLet me consider if there's any overlapping or miscounting. Since the intersection is already given as 45%, and I've subtracted it once from the sum of individual percentages, it should be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a Venn diagram to visualize this. Let's draw imaginary circles for English and Spanish speakers. The overlap between the two circles is 45%, and the separate parts are 25% for English only and 20% for Spanish only. Adding those up: 25% + 20% + 45% = 90%.\n\nHmm, it's consistently coming to 90%. I think that's the answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility that some people might not speak either language. The problem doesn't specify that everyone speaks at least one of the two languages, so in theory, there could be a portion that doesn't speak either. But based on the inclusion-exclusion principle, 90% speak at least one, which implies that 10% don't speak either.\n\nUnless the problem states that everyone speaks at least one language, which it doesn't, 90% seems to be the correct answer.\n\nI don't see any errors in this reasoning. The inclusion-exclusion principle is a standard method for this type of problem, and the calculations are straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90\\%} \\]"
