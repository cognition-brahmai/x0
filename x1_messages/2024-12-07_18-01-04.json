        "content": "Let's see. The total cost of the gift is $60, and each person contributes $12. They want to split the cost equally among themselves. So, I need to find out how many friends are in the group.\n\nWell, if each person contributes $12, and the total is $60, I can probably find the number of friends by dividing the total cost by the amount each person contributes. So, that would be $60 divided by $12.\n\nLet me do the math: 60 divided by 12 equals 5. So, there are 5 friends in the group.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If there are 5 friends and each contributes $12, then 5 times 12 is indeed $60. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as finding the value of x in the equation 12x = 60, where x is the number of friends. Solving for x, I divide both sides by 12, which gives x = 5.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the group consists of 5 friends.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
