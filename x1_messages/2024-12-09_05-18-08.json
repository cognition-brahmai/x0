The term \"Pb\" comes from the Latin word \"plumbum,\" which is the origin of the word \"plumbing\" due to lead's historical use in pipes. Lead has indeed been utilized for centuries across various applications, including paints, piping systems, and as an additive in gasoline to improve engine performance.\n\nHowever, over time, it became evident that lead exposure could cause severe health issues, particularly affecting the nervous system and causing developmental problems in children. As a result, regulations have been implemented worldwide to restrict its use in these products. Today, lead is still used in some batteries, bullets, and other industrial applications, but its usage is strictly controlled to minimize human exposure and environmental impact."
