We'll do this by integrating each term separately.\n\nFirst, let's recall the power rule for integration, which states that the integral of x^n with respect to x is (x^{n+1})/(n+1) + C, where n is a constant and C is the constant of integration.\n\nApplying this rule to each term:\n\n1. Integral of 3x\u00b2:\n\nThe power rule gives us \u222b3x\u00b2 dx = 3 * (x^{2+1})/(2+1) = 3 * (x\u00b3)/3 = x\u00b3.\n\n2. Integral of -2x:\n\nSimilarly, \u222b-2x dx = -2 * (x^{1+1})/(1+1) = -2 * (x\u00b2)/2 = -x\u00b2.\n\n3. Integral of 1:\n\nThe integral of a constant is the constant times x, so \u222b1 dx = 1 * x = x.\n\nNow, we combine these results and add the constant of integration, C:\n\n\u222b(3x\u00b2 - 2x + 1) dx = x\u00b3 - x\u00b2 + x + C.\n\nSo, the indefinite integral of h(x) is x\u00b3 - x\u00b2 + x + C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{x^3 - x^2 + x + C} \\]"
