        "content": "In the hush of the night, when the world's in a snore,\nThe moon takes the stage, with a glow so galore.\nIt's a show, oh so bright, in the sky so serene,\nReflecting upon the ocean, in a dance so serene.\n\nThe waves are like pages, of a storybook old,\nFlip-flapping in rhythm, as the moon's light is told.\n\"Goodnight, little fishies,\" the moon seems to say,\n\"Drift off to sleep, in my silver play.\"\n\nThe seagulls are hushed, not a squawk to be heard,\nAs they tuck in their feathers, and turn to the third.\nThe third what? The third cup of tea? No, that's absurd!\nThe third chapter of night, where dreams are absurd.\n\nThe moonlight's so mellow, it turns the waves to cream,\nA milky way dancing, in the ocean's extreme.\nThe stars up above, they twinkle and wink,\nAs if playing a game, of celestial link.\n\nNow, the moon, she's a character, full of surprises,\nSometimes she's a crescent, sometimes she's all eyes.\nBut tonight, she's a beacon, so round and so bright,\nGuiding ships and hearts, through the night's endless might.\n\nThe sand on the shore, it's a canvas so wide,\nPainted silver by moonlight, where shadows reside.\nFootprints from the day, now glisten and gleam,\nAs if the moon's own fingers, are tracing the dream.\n\nThe breeze whispers secrets, to the rustling palm trees,\nTelling tales of the day, and the adventures it sees.\nThe ocean listens close, with its waves soft and low,\nA lullaby for the earth, as it drifts to and fro.\n\nSo here's to the moonlight, so magical and rare,\nTurning the ocean into a scene beyond compare.\nLet's raise a silent toast, to this nocturnal display,\nIn the style of Dr. Seuss, where imagination plays."
