        "content": "So I need to find the volume of a rectangular prism, and I have the dimensions: length is 10 cm, width is 5 cm, and height is 3 cm. I remember that the volume of a rectangular prism is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height together. So, it should be volume equals length times width times height.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nVolume = length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height\n\nNow, plugging in the values:\n\nVolume = 10 cm \u00d7 5 cm \u00d7 3 cm\n\nFirst, I'll multiply 10 cm by 5 cm, which is 50 cm\u00b2. Then, multiply that by 3 cm.\n\nSo, 50 cm\u00b2 \u00d7 3 cm = 150 cm\u00b3.\n\nWait, but I should be careful with the units. When you multiply centimeters together three times, you get cubic centimeters, which is cm\u00b3. So, 150 cm\u00b3 makes sense.\n\nLet me double-check my multiplication. 10 times 5 is 50, and 50 times 3 is 150. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe using the formula for the area of the base times the height. The base of a rectangular prism is a rectangle, so its area is length times width.\n\nSo, area of base = length \u00d7 width = 10 cm \u00d7 5 cm = 50 cm\u00b2.\n\nThen, volume = area of base \u00d7 height = 50 cm\u00b2 \u00d7 3 cm = 150 cm\u00b3.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the height times the length times the width, or any other order, because multiplication is commutative.\n\nSo, 3 cm \u00d7 10 cm \u00d7 5 cm = 30 cm\u00b2 \u00d7 5 cm = 150 cm\u00b3.\n\nSame result again.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like units or anything else. But since it's a straightforward rectangular prism, there shouldn't be any additional considerations.\n\nI should also make sure that all dimensions are in the same unit. Here, they're all in centimeters, so that's fine.\n\nIf any of them were in different units, like meters or millimeters, I'd need to convert them to the same unit before multiplying.\n\nBut in this case, everything is in centimeters, so no conversion is needed.\n\nAlright, I think 150 cm\u00b3 is the correct volume of the rectangular prism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150 \\text{ cm}^3} \\]"
