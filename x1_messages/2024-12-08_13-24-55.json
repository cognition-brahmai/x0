        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about a train traveling from station A to station C, with a stop in between at station B. The train moves at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.\n\nFirst, it travels from station A to station B in 2 hours. Since speed is constant at 60 mph, I can calculate the distance between A and B by multiplying speed by time. So, distance from A to B is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nDistance_AB = 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nThen, the train stops at station B for 30 minutes. This is just a stop, so no distance is covered during this time. It's just a pause before continuing the journey.\n\nAfter the stop, the train continues to station C, taking another 1.5 hours. Again, the speed is constant at 60 mph, so the distance from B to C can be calculated similarly:\n\nDistance_BC = 60 mph \u00d7 1.5 hours = 90 miles\n\nNow, to find the total distance traveled from station A to station C, I need to add the distances from A to B and from B to C:\n\nTotal distance = Distance_AB + Distance_BC\n\nTotal distance = 120 miles + 90 miles = 210 miles\n\nSo, the total distance traveled by the train from station A to station C is 210 miles.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there's anything I'm missing. The stop at station B is just a 30-minute halt, which doesn't affect the distance traveled; it only adds to the total travel time. So, my calculation should be correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the entire journey in terms of time and speed. The total time spent moving is 2 hours from A to B plus 1.5 hours from B to C, which is 3.5 hours. Multiplying this total moving time by the constant speed should also give the total distance:\n\nTotal moving time = 2 hours + 1.5 hours = 3.5 hours\n\nTotal distance = Speed \u00d7 Total moving time\n\nTotal distance = 60 mph \u00d7 3.5 hours = 210 miles\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that 210 miles is the correct total distance traveled from station A to station C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{210} \\]"
