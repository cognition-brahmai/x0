In reality, he prepared the speech well in advance, making several drafts and revisions before delivering it on November 19, 1863. The idea that he jotted it down quickly on an envelope likely originated as a romanticized tale to emphasize his humility and spontaneity, but historical evidence suggests otherwise."
