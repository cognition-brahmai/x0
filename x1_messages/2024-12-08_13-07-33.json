        "content": "So I've read up to page 30 in a book that has 150 pages in total, and I want to find out what percentage of the book I've read. Hmm, percentages have always been a bit tricky for me, but let's see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a percentage is. I think it's a way to express a part of something in terms of 100. So, if I have 100 apples, and I take 50 of them, that's 50%. Makes sense.\n\nIn this case, the total number of pages is 150, and I've read 30 pages. So, I need to find out what part 30 is of 150, and then express that as a percentage.\n\nI remember that to find a percentage, I can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{part}}{\\text{whole}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nHere, the \"part\" is the pages I've read, which is 30, and the \"whole\" is the total pages, which is 150.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{30}{150} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nHmm, 30 divided by 150. Let's see, 30 divided by 150. I think that's 0.2, because 150 times 0.2 is 30.\n\nSo, 0.2 times 100 would be 20%. So, I've read 20% of the book.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe I can think about it in terms of fractions.\n\n30 out of 150 is like the fraction 30/150. I can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 30.\n\n30 divided by 30 is 1, and 150 divided by 30 is 5. So, it's 1/5.\n\nNow, 1/5 as a decimal is 0.2, and 0.2 times 100 is again 20%. So, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there another way to verify this? Maybe using proportions.\n\nI know that percentage is parts per hundred, so I can set up a proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{150} = \\frac{x}{100}\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for x.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n30 * 100 = 150 * x\n\nSo, 3000 = 150x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 150:\n\nx = 3000 / 150\n\nLet's do the division: 150 times 20 is 3000. So, x = 20%.\n\nAgain, the same answer. Okay, I think I'm confident now that I've read 20% of the book.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to approach this problem.\n\nWhat if the book had different number of pages, or what if I've read a different number of pages? Is there a general method?\n\nYes, the general method is the formula I used earlier:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{part}}{\\text{whole}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSo, regardless of the numbers, as long as I have the part and the whole, I can find the percentage.\n\nIn this specific case, part is 30 and whole is 150, leading to 20%.\n\nI think I've covered it from multiple angles and keep getting the same answer, so I'm satisfied that 20% is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20\\%} \\]"
