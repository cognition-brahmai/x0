        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a bakery that sells three types of cookies: chocolate chip, oatmeal, and sugar. If a customer buys one of each type, they get a discount. On Monday, the bakery sold 24 chocolate chip cookies, 20 oatmeal cookies, and 28 sugar cookies. The problem assumes that every customer bought at least one of each type to get the discount, and it's asking how many customers visited the bakery on Monday.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what's being asked. It seems like every customer bought at least one of each type of cookie, meaning each customer bought at least one chocolate chip, one oatmeal, and one sugar cookie. So, if I can figure out how many sets of these three cookies were sold, that should give me the number of customers.\n\nLet me think about it. If every customer buys one of each type, then the number of chocolate chip cookies sold should be equal to the number of customers, same with oatmeal and sugar cookies. But here, the numbers are different: 24 chocolate chip, 20 oatmeal, and 28 sugar cookies. That seems inconsistent if each customer buys one of each.\n\nWait a minute, maybe some customers bought more than one set. Maybe some bought two sets, meaning two of each type, and so on. But the problem says \"at least one of each type to get the discount,\" but doesn't specify that they can't buy more. So perhaps some customers bought more than one set.\n\nBut that complicates things. Maybe I should consider the minimum number of sets required to account for all the cookies sold.\n\nLet me try to approach it differently. Let's denote the number of customers as n. Each customer buys at least one of each type, so at least n chocolate chip, n oatmeal, and n sugar cookies were sold.\n\nBut the bakery sold 24 chocolate chip, 20 oatmeal, and 28 sugar cookies. So, the number of customers n cannot be more than the smallest number of any type of cookie sold, because otherwise, some customers wouldn't have bought a cookie of the type with the smallest quantity.\n\nSo, the smallest number here is 20 oatmeal cookies. Therefore, the number of customers n is at most 20.\n\nBut wait, maybe some customers bought more than one of a particular type. For example, a customer could buy one of each to get the discount, and then buy extra cookies of any type without getting additional discounts.\n\nHmm, that complicates things. Maybe the problem assumes that each customer buys exactly one of each type and no more.\n\nBut that seems too simplistic, because then the numbers should be equal, which they're not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that to get the discount, a customer must buy at least one of each type, but can buy additional cookies as well, possibly of any type.\n\nIn that case, the number of customers would be equal to the number of unique sets of at least one of each type purchased.\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe I should look at the total cookies sold and see if there's a way to distribute them among customers who each get at least one of each type.\n\nLet's see: total cookies sold are 24 chocolate chip + 20 oatmeal + 28 sugar = 72 cookies in total.\n\nIf each customer buys at least three cookies (one of each type), then the minimum number of cookies per customer is three.\n\nSo, the maximum number of customers would be 72 divided by 3, which is 24. But that would only be possible if each customer bought exactly three cookies, one of each type.\n\nHowever, the numbers don't support that, because if each customer bought one of each type, then the number of each type should be equal to the number of customers. But here, we have 24, 20, and 28, which are different.\n\nSo, perhaps some customers bought more than one set.\n\nLet me consider that some customers bought more than one set. Let's say that some customers bought m sets, where m is at least 1.\n\nThen, the total number of chocolate chip cookies sold would be the sum over all customers of the number of sets they bought, same for the other types.\n\nBut that seems too vague. Maybe I need to think in terms of the least common multiple or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a system of equations.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet n be the number of customers.\n\nEach customer buys at least one of each type, so at least n chocolate chip, n oatmeal, and n sugar cookies were sold.\n\nBut actually, the bakery sold 24 chocolate chip, 20 oatmeal, and 28 sugar cookies.\n\nSo, if each customer buys at least one of each, then the number of customers n must satisfy:\n\nn \u2264 24 (for chocolate chip)\n\nn \u2264 20 (for oatmeal)\n\nn \u2264 28 (for sugar)\n\nTherefore, n \u2264 20, since oatmeal has the fewest sales.\n\nBut wait, maybe some customers bought extra cookies beyond the one set.\n\nFor example, a customer could buy one of each for the discount, and then buy extra cookies of any type.\n\nIn that case, the total number of cookies sold would be:\n\nFor chocolate chip: n + extra chocolate chip cookies\n\nSimilarly for oatmeal and sugar.\n\nBut without knowing how many extra cookies each customer bought, this seems impossible to solve.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each customer bought exactly one of each type and no more.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense, because then the numbers should match.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that some cookies were sold without being part of a set.\n\nBut the problem says \"assuming every customer bought at least one of each type to get the discount,\" which suggests that no cookies were sold outside of sets.\n\nBut that seems to contradict the different numbers sold for each type.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose that each customer buys exactly one set consisting of one of each type.\n\nThen, the number of customers would be equal to the number of sets sold.\n\nBut the numbers of each type sold are different, which suggests that this assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps not all cookies were sold in complete sets.\n\nBut the problem says every customer bought at least one of each type, implying that each set sold consists of at least one of each type.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider that each customer buys at least one of each type, but may buy additional cookies beyond that.\n\nSo, for each customer, they buy at least one chocolate chip, one oatmeal, and one sugar cookie, and may buy extra cookies.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor chocolate chip cookies:\n\nEach customer buys at least one, plus some extra.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nLet me denote for each customer:\n\n- c: number of extra chocolate chip cookies bought beyond the one in the set.\n\n- o: number of extra oatmeal cookies bought beyond the one in the set.\n\n- s: number of extra sugar cookies bought beyond the one in the set.\n\nThen, the total cookies sold would be:\n\nTotal chocolate chip: n + sum over all customers of c_i = 24\n\nSimilarly:\n\nTotal oatmeal: n + sum over all customers of o_i = 20\n\nTotal sugar: n + sum over all customers of s_i = 28\n\nBut without knowing the values of c_i, o_i, s_i, this seems unsolvable.\n\nMaybe I need to find the smallest n such that n \u2264 20, n \u2264 24, n \u2264 28, which is n \u2264 20.\n\nBut that doesn't take into account the extra cookies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of customers is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 24, 20, and 28.\n\nLet me check the GCD of 24, 20, and 28.\n\nThe GCD of 24 and 20 is 4.\n\nThe GCD of 4 and 28 is 4.\n\nSo, GCD is 4.\n\nDoes that mean there were 4 customers, each buying 6 sets (24/4=6 chocolate chip, 20/4=5 oatmeal, 28/4=7 sugar)?\n\nBut that doesn't make sense, because each customer can't buy a fraction of a set.\n\nWait, perhaps it's that each customer buys a certain number of sets, and the ratios match the numbers sold.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSuppose that each customer buys exactly one set consisting of one of each type.\n\nThen, the number of sets sold would be equal to the number of customers.\n\nBut then, the number of each type of cookie sold should be equal to the number of customers, which they're not (24, 20, 28).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sets include multiple cookies of each type.\n\nBut the problem says one of each type for the discount.\n\nWait, maybe some customers bought more than one set, meaning they bought multiple sets of one of each type.\n\nFor example, a customer could buy two sets, so two chocolate chip, two oatmeal, and two sugar cookies.\n\nIn that case, the total cookies sold would be multiples of the number of customers, depending on how many sets each customer bought.\n\nThis seems too vague.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the number of customers is the minimum number of cookies of any type, which is 20 oatmeal cookies.\n\nSo, perhaps there were 20 customers, each buying one oatmeal cookie, and the extra cookies of the other types could be from customers buying extra cookies.\n\nBut then, for chocolate chip, 24 sold, which would mean 20 plus 4 extra.\n\nSimilarly, for sugar, 28 sold, which would be 20 plus 8 extra.\n\nBut without knowing how the extras are distributed, this doesn't help much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of customers is the greatest number that divides into 24, 20, and 28, which is the GCD, which is 4, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut does that make sense in this context?\n\nIf there are 4 customers, and each buys 6 sets, but that would mean they bought 6 chocolate chip, 6 oatmeal, and 6 sugar cookies each, leading to 24, 24, and 24 cookies sold, which doesn't match the given numbers.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the customers bought different numbers of sets.\n\nFor example, some customers bought more sets than others.\n\nBut this seems too ambiguous to solve.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me consider that each customer must buy at least one of each type, but can buy extra cookies beyond that.\n\nSo, the minimum number of cookies per customer is three: one of each type.\n\nGiven that, the maximum number of customers is the total cookies divided by 3, which is 72/3=24.\n\nBut again, the numbers don't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of customers is limited by the type with the fewest sales, which is oatmeal with 20 cookies.\n\nSo, perhaps there were 20 customers, each buying one oatmeal cookie, and the extra cookies are additional purchases.\n\nIn that case, the chocolate chip cookies: 24 sold, so 20 plus 4 extra.\n\nSimilarly, sugar cookies: 28 sold, so 20 plus 8 extra.\n\nBut again, without knowing how the extras are distributed, I can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to assume that each customer bought exactly one set consisting of one of each type, and that all extra cookies were sold as part of additional sets.\n\nIn that case, the number of sets sold would be the minimum number of any type of cookie sold, which is 20 oatmeal cookies.\n\nSo, 20 sets were sold, meaning 20 customers.\n\nBut then, that would imply that only 20 chocolate chip and 20 sugar cookies were sold, which contradicts the given numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of sets is determined by the type with the fewest extra cookies.\n\nBut I'm going in circles here.\n\nMaybe I should look at it from the perspective of the type with the fewest sales, which is oatmeal with 20 cookies.\n\nIf each customer buys at least one oatmeal cookie, then there are 20 customers.\n\nThen, for chocolate chip, 24 sold, which means 20 plus 4 extra.\n\nSimilarly, for sugar, 28 sold, which is 20 plus 8 extra.\n\nSo, in this scenario, there are 20 customers, each buying one of each type, and some customers buying extra chocolate chip and sugar cookies.\n\nBut the problem is that it doesn't specify how many extra cookies each customer can buy, so I can't determine the exact number of customers based on the extra cookies.\n\nThis is frustrating.\n\nLet me try to think about it differently.\n\nSuppose that each customer buys exactly one set of one of each type, and some customers buy additional cookies beyond that.\n\nThen, the number of customers is equal to the number of sets sold, which is equal to the number of oatmeal cookies sold, since they have the fewest sold.\n\nSo, 20 customers bought one oatmeal cookie each.\n\nThen, for chocolate chip, 24 sold, which means 20 plus 4 extra.\n\nSimilarly, for sugar, 28 sold, which is 20 plus 8 extra.\n\nBut without knowing how many extra cookies each customer bought, I can't determine the number of customers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that all extra cookies were bought by the same customers who bought the sets.\n\nBut again, without knowing the distribution, it's impossible to say.\n\nMaybe the problem is simply that the number of customers is equal to the number of oatmeal cookies sold, which is 20, assuming that each customer bought exactly one oatmeal cookie.\n\nBut that seems too simplistic and doesn't account for the different numbers of other cookies sold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to find the greatest number of customers that could have visited, given the constraints.\n\nIn that case, it would be 20, based on the oatmeal cookies.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the least number of customers that could have visited, given the constraints.\n\nIn that case, I need to maximize the number of extra cookies per customer.\n\nFor example, if one customer buys all the extra cookies, then the number of customers would be minimized.\n\nBut again, without knowing the distribution, it's hard to say.\n\nThis problem seems unclear in its wording, and perhaps some information is missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overthinking this, and the answer is simply the number of oatmeal cookies sold, which is 20.\n\nBut I feel like that might be too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of customers is the GCD of the three numbers: 24, 20, and 28, which is 4.\n\nBut earlier, that didn't make sense in the context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to find the largest number n such that n divides into 24, 20, and 28, which again is 4.\n\nBut again, that doesn't align with the earlier thought process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of customers is the sum of the cookies sold divided by 3, which is 72/3=24.\n\nBut again, that doesn't align with the different numbers sold for each type.\n\nThis is really confusing.\n\nMaybe I should just accept that the problem is unclear and move on.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that there were 20 customers, each buying one oatmeal cookie, one chocolate chip cookie, and one sugar cookie, and the extra cookies were bought by some customers.\n\nBut again, without knowing how the extras are distributed, I can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that there were 20 customers, based on the oatmeal cookies, and the extra cookies were bought by some customers as extras.\n\nBut I still feel like that's not fully addressing the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that there were 24 customers, based on the chocolate chip cookies, since that's the next lowest number.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because oatmeal has fewer sales.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that there were 28 customers, based on the sugar cookies, but that seems inconsistent because chocolate chip and oatmeal have fewer sales.\n\nThis is really puzzling.\n\nMaybe the problem is that the number of customers is equal to the number of sets sold, and each set consists of one of each type.\n\nIn that case, the number of sets sold would be equal to the number of oatmeal cookies sold, which is 20, since that's the limiting factor.\n\nBut then, that would imply that only 20 chocolate chip and 20 sugar cookies were sold, which contradicts the given numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of sets sold is equal to the number of chocolate chip cookies sold, which is 24, and some customers bought more than one set.\n\nBut then, for oatmeal, only 20 were sold, which would mean that some customers bought additional chocolate chip and sugar cookies, but not additional oatmeal cookies.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some customers bought additional sets, which would require buying additional oatmeal cookies, but that contradicts the number of oatmeal cookies sold being only 20.\n\nThis is really confusing.\n\nMaybe I need to accept that the problem doesn't have a clear answer based on the given information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that there were 20 customers, each buying one oatmeal cookie, one chocolate chip cookie, and one sugar cookie, and some customers bought additional chocolate chip and sugar cookies.\n\nIn that case, the number of customers is 20.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that there were 24 customers, each buying one set, and some customers bought additional oatmeal cookies.\n\nBut again, that doesn't align with the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that there were 28 customers, each buying one set, but that doesn't match the other numbers.\n\nThis is really frustrating.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that each customer must buy at least one of each type, so the number of customers is less than or equal to the minimum number of any type of cookie sold, which is 20 oatmeal cookies.\n\nSo, n \u2264 20.\n\nBut perhaps some customers bought more than one set, meaning they bought additional sets of one of each type.\n\nIn that case, for each additional set, they would buy one more of each type.\n\nSo, if a customer buys m sets, they buy m chocolate chip, m oatmeal, and m sugar cookies.\n\nGiven that, the total cookies sold would be:\n\nTotal chocolate chip: sum over all customers of m_i = 24\n\nTotal oatmeal: sum over all customers of m_i = 20\n\nTotal sugar: sum over all customers of m_i = 28\n\nBut this seems impossible, because the sums should be equal if m_i is the same for each customer.\n\nBut they're not equal, so perhaps customers bought different numbers of sets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some customers bought only one set, and others bought more.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that there were 20 customers, each buying one set, and some customers bought additional chocolate chip and sugar cookies.\n\nIn that case, the number of customers is 20.\n\nBut again, without knowing how the extra cookies are distributed, I can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that all extra cookies were bought by the same customers who bought the sets.\n\nBut that still doesn't help determine the number of customers.\n\nThis problem seems to have insufficient information to determine the number of customers definitively.\n\nPerhaps the answer is that there were 20 customers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
