        "content": "To create a Python script that downloads HTML content from a given URL and counts the occurrences of each word on the page, you can use libraries such as `requests` for fetching the content and `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4` for parsing the HTML. Additionally, you can use the `collections` module to count word frequencies.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **Install Required Libraries**:\n   Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip if you haven't already:\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests beautifulsoup4\n   ```\n\n2. **Fetch the HTML Content**:\n   Use the `requests` library to download the HTML content from the provided URL.\n\n3. **Parse the HTML**:\n   Use `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML and extract the text content.\n\n4. **Clean and Tokenize the Text**:\n   Clean the text by removing punctuation and converting it to lowercase. Then, split the text into words.\n\n5. **Count Word Occurrences**:\n   Use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each word.\n\n6. **Display the Results**:\n   Print the word counts or handle them as needed.\n\nHere's a sample script that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport string\n\ndef fetch_html(url):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an error for bad statuses\n        return response.text\n    except requests.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching URL: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef extract_text(html):\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')\n    # Extract text from the HTML\n    text = soup.get_text()\n    return text\n\ndef count_words(text):\n    # Remove punctuation and convert to lowercase\n    translator = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)\n    clean_text = text.translate(translator).lower()\n    # Split text into words\n    words = clean_text.split()\n    # Count word frequencies\n    word_counts = Counter(words)\n    return word_counts\n\ndef main():\n    url = input(\"Enter the URL: \")\n    html = fetch_html(url)\n    if html:\n        text = extract_text(html)\n        word_counts = count_words(text)\n        # Print word counts\n        for word, count in word_counts.items():\n            print(f\"{word}: {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Fetching HTML**:\n   - The `fetch_html` function uses `requests.get` to download the HTML content from the specified URL. It handles basic error checking using `response.raise_for_status()`.\n\n2. **Extracting Text**:\n   - The `extract_text` function uses `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML and extract text using `soup.get_text()`.\n\n3. **Counting Words**:\n   - The `count_words` function cleans the text by removing punctuation and converting it to lowercase. It then splits the text into words and uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each word.\n\n4. **Main Function**:\n   - The `main` function orchestrates the process by getting user input for the URL, fetching the HTML, extracting text, counting words, and printing the results.\n\nThis script provides a straightforward way to analyze word frequencies on a web page. You can further enhance it by adding features like ignoring common stop words, handling different types of content, or providing more detailed output formats."
