        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. Let's start by creating the base class for a Vehicle in TypeScript. This class will have properties like make, model, year, and mileage. We'll also include methods to calculate fuel efficiency based on the mileage and to display vehicle information.\n\nFirst, here's the Vehicle class:\n\n```typescript\nclass Vehicle {\n    make: string;\n    model: string;\n    year: number;\n    mileage: number;\n\n    constructor(make: string, model: string, year: number, mileage: number) {\n        this.make = make;\n        this.model = model;\n        this.year = year;\n        this.mileage = mileage;\n    }\n\n    calculateFuelEfficiency(): number {\n        // For simplicity, let's assume fuel efficiency is calculated as 100 / mileage\n        // In real-world scenarios, this calculation would be more complex\n        return 100 / this.mileage;\n    }\n\n    displayInfo(): void {\n        console.log(`Make: ${this.make}`);\n        console.log(`Model: ${this.model}`);\n        console.log(`Year: ${this.year}`);\n        console.log(`Mileage: ${this.mileage} miles`);\n        console.log(`Fuel Efficiency: ${this.calculateFuelEfficiency().toFixed(2)} mpg`);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's create a subclass called ElectricVehicle that inherits from Vehicle and adds properties like battery capacity and charging status.\n\n```typescript\nclass ElectricVehicle extends Vehicle {\n    batteryCapacity: number; // in kWh\n    chargingStatus: boolean;\n\n    constructor(make: string, model: string, year: number, mileage: number, batteryCapacity: number, chargingStatus: boolean) {\n        super(make, model, year, mileage);\n        this.batteryCapacity = batteryCapacity;\n        this.chargingStatus = chargingStatus;\n    }\n\n    displayInfo(): void {\n        super.displayInfo();\n        console.log(`Battery Capacity: ${this.batteryCapacity} kWh`);\n        console.log(`Charging Status: ${this.chargingStatus ? 'Charging' : 'Not Charging'}`);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this setup:\n\n- The `Vehicle` class has properties for make, model, year, and mileage. It includes a method to calculate fuel efficiency (simplified for this example) and a method to display vehicle information.\n\n- The `ElectricVehicle` class extends `Vehicle` and adds properties for battery capacity and charging status. It overrides the `displayInfo` method to include the additional information about the electric vehicle.\n\nYou can create instances of these classes and test their methods like this:\n\n```typescript\n// Creating a Vehicle instance\nconst myCar = new Vehicle('Toyota', 'Camry', 2020, 30000);\nmyCar.displayInfo();\n\n// Creating an ElectricVehicle instance\nconst myEV = new ElectricVehicle('Tesla', 'Model S', 2021, 15000, 100, true);\nmyEV.displayInfo();\n```\n\nThis should give you a good starting point for working with vehicle classes in TypeScript.
