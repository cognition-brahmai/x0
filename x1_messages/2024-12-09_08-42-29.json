        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the online retailer currently has a warehouse that's 100,000 square feet and can store up to 1 million items. They want to double their storage capacity within three years. First, I need to figure out what doubling the storage capacity means.\n\nIf they can currently store 1 million items, doubling that would mean they want to store 2 million items in total. But they already have space for 1 million, so they need additional space for another 1 million items.\n\nNow, I need to find out how much additional warehouse space is required for these extra 1 million items. The problem mentions that the item density per square foot remains the same. So, I should first determine the current item density.\n\nItem density is the number of items that can be stored per square foot. So, with 1 million items in 100,000 square feet, the density is:\n\nItem density = number of items / area\n\nItem density = 1,000,000 items / 100,000 sq ft\n\nItem density = 10 items per sq ft\n\nSo, each square foot can hold 10 items.\n\nNow, if they want to store an additional 1 million items at the same density, I can calculate the required additional space.\n\nAdditional space required = additional items / item density\n\nAdditional space required = 1,000,000 items / 10 items per sq ft\n\nAdditional space required = 100,000 sq ft\n\nSo, they need an additional 100,000 square feet of warehouse space.\n\nNext, the problem asks me to estimate the cost of constructing this new warehouse. The construction cost is given as $200 per square foot.\n\nTotal cost = additional space required \u00d7 construction cost per sq ft\n\nTotal cost = 100,000 sq ft \u00d7 $200 per sq ft\n\nTotal cost = $20,000,000\n\nSo, the estimated cost of constructing the new warehouse is $20,000,000.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at this. If the current warehouse is 100,000 sq ft and they want to double their storage capacity by adding another 100,000 sq ft, that makes sense based on the item density.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider whether the new warehouse will have the same item density. The problem says to assume the same item density per square foot, so it's okay to use the same density for the new warehouse.\n\nAlso, the construction cost is straightforward: $200 per sq ft multiplied by the additional square footage needed.\n\nI think that's correct. The company needs to build another 100,000 sq ft of warehouse space, which will cost $20,000,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20000000} \\]"
