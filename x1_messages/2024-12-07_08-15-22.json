        "content": "So, the train is going at an average speed of 60 miles per hour and it takes 5 hours to reach its destination. I need to find out how far the train travels. I remember that distance, speed, and time are related, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.\n\nI think the formula is: distance equals speed multiplied by time, or something like that. So, if speed is 60 miles per hour and time is 5 hours, maybe I just need to multiply them together. Let me try that.\n\n60 miles per hour times 5 hours would be 60 times 5, which is 300. So, the train travels 300 miles. That seems straightforward, but I should make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that sometimes units can tricky. Here, the speed is in miles per hour and time is in hours, so when I multiply them, the hours unit should cancel out, leaving me with miles, which is what I want. So, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if the speed is constant or if it's just an average. The problem says \"average speed,\" so maybe the speed varies during the trip, but the average over the whole journey is 60 miles per hour. That should still work with the formula, right?\n\nI think so, because average speed is defined as total distance divided by total time. So, if I have average speed and time, I can find the total distance by rearranging the formula: distance equals average speed multiplied by time.\n\nSo, in this case, distance equals 60 miles per hour times 5 hours, which is 300 miles. That makes sense.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using conversion factors or something like that.\n\nWell, 60 miles per hour means that every hour, the train covers 60 miles. So, in 5 hours, it would cover 5 times 60 miles, which is again 300 miles. Same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to plot a graph of speed against time, the area under the curve would give me the distance traveled. But since the speed is constant, the graph would be a horizontal line at 60 miles per hour, and over 5 hours, the area would be a rectangle with height 60 and width 5, so area equals 300 miles. That matches my previous calculation.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. The train travels 300 miles to reach its destination.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
