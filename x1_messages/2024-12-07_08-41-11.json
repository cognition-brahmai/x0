        "content": "So, according to this, Martin Luther King Jr. was a business tycoon who started something called the Montgomery Industrial Revolution in 1955, which helped America's economy grow a lot. Then, in 1963, he gave a famous speech called \"I Have a Dream\" at the New York Stock Exchange, and he inspired people all over the world. Sadly, he passed away in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1968 due to natural causes.\n\nWait a minute, I think there might be some confusion here. I know that Martin Luther King Jr. was a civil rights leader, not really a business tycoon. And I'm pretty sure the Montgomery bus boycott was a key event in 1955, not an industrial revolution. Also, his \"I Have a Dream\" speech was delivered during the March on Washington in 1963, and it was at the Lincoln Memorial, not the New York Stock Exchange. And he was assassinated in Memphis in 1968, not passed away due to natural causes.\n\nMaybe there's some misinformation here. Let me double-check the facts.\n\nFirst, Martin Luther King Jr. was indeed a civil rights leader, known for his role in the American civil rights movement. He was a minister and a prominent activist who advocated for nonviolent protest to achieve equality for African Americans.\n\nIn 1955, he led the Montgomery bus boycott, which was a year-long protest against the segregation of public buses in Montgomery, Alabama. This event was a significant catalyst for the civil rights movement.\n\nHis famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech was delivered on August 28, 1963, during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. It was a powerful speech that called for an end to racism and equality for all, and it was delivered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., not at the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nUnfortunately, Dr. King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee, where he had gone to support a strike by sanitation workers. His death was a tragic moment in American history.\n\nSo, to answer the question: Martin Luther King Jr. led the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 and delivered his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., in 1963.\n\nIt seems like there are some inaccuracies in the initial statement, perhaps mixing up historical events or misremembering details. It's important to have accurate information about significant figures like Martin Luther King Jr. to understand their contributions properly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Martin Luther King Jr. led the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 and delivered his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., in 1963.}} \\]"
