        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the car rental company charges a flat fee of $20 per day and an additional 15 cents per mile driven. I need to find out the total cost for renting the car for three days and driving 200 miles.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the cost of renting the car for three days. Since the flat fee is $20 per day, I'll multiply $20 by 3 days.\n\n$20/day * 3 days = $60\n\nSo, the rental cost for three days is $60.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost for driving 200 miles. The charge is 15 cents per mile. To make it easier, I'll convert 15 cents to dollars. 15 cents is $0.15.\n\nSo, the cost for miles driven is $0.15 per mile * 200 miles.\n\n$0.15/mile * 200 miles = $30\n\nNow, I'll add the rental cost and the mileage cost to get the total cost.\n\n$60 (rental) + $30 (miles) = $90\n\nTherefore, the total cost to rent the car for three days and drive 200 miles is $90.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Some rental companies have a daily mileage allowance or other factors, but according to the problem, it's a flat fee per day plus a per mile charge with no mentions of any limits or additional fees.\n\nSo, the calculation seems straightforward. Still, I'll consider if there's any other cost that might be involved. For example, is there a one-time fee for renting the car, or does the daily fee already include a certain number of miles?\n\nBut based on the information given, there's no mention of any additional fees or included miles. It's just $20 per day plus 15 cents per mile.\n\nSo, sticking to the given data, my initial calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total cost using a different approach. Let's see.\n\nFirst, find the total number of days: 3 days.\n\nTotal rental cost: $20 * 3 = $60.\n\nTotal miles driven: 200 miles.\n\nCost per mile: $0.15.\n\nTotal mileage cost: 200 * $0.15 = $30.\n\nTotal cost: $60 + $30 = $90.\n\nYeah, that matches my first calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total cost per day including the mileage if I were to drive a certain number of miles each day, but that seems more complicated and unnecessary for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the cost per mile and per day separately and then sum them up, but that's essentially what I did already.\n\nI could also consider the cost per day and the cost per mile as separate components and confirm that there are no overlapping charges or discounts, but again, the problem doesn't mention any such complications.\n\nSo, I think $90 is the correct total cost.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let's consider if the mileage cost could be calculated differently. For example, some places might have a minimum charge or something like that, but again, according to the problem, it's just 15 cents per mile with no mention of a minimum charge.\n\nAlso, confirming the units: the daily fee is per day, and the mileage is per mile driven. No hours or other units mentioned.\n\nSo, I think $90 is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's try plugging in different numbers to see if the calculation makes sense.\n\nSuppose I rent the car for 1 day and drive 100 miles.\n\nRental cost: $20 * 1 = $20.\n\nMileage cost: $0.15 * 100 = $15.\n\nTotal: $20 + $15 = $35.\n\nThat seems logical.\n\nAnother scenario: 2 days and 150 miles.\n\nRental: $20 * 2 = $40.\n\nMileage: $0.15 * 150 = $22.50.\n\nTotal: $40 + $22.50 = $62.50.\n\nAgain, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to the original question: 3 days and 200 miles.\n\nRental: $20 * 3 = $60.\n\nMileage: $0.15 * 200 = $30.\n\nTotal: $60 + $30 = $90.\n\nYes, I'm confident with this answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at the total cost per mile and per day as a combined rate, but that's unnecessarily complex for this scenario.\n\nI could also consider graphing the cost as a function of days and miles, but that's probably overkill for this problem.\n\nIn conclusion, the total cost for renting the car for three days and driving 200 miles is $90.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]"
