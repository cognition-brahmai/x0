        "content": "So the factory produces 250 widgets in 5 days, and I need to find out how many it will produce in a month that has 30 days. Okay, first things first, I should figure out the daily production rate and then scale it up to 30 days.\n\nLet's see, if they produce 250 widgets in 5 days, then the daily production would be 250 divided by 5, right? So, 250 \u00f7 5 = 50 widgets per day.\n\nNow, if they produce 50 widgets each day, then in 30 days, they should produce 50 multiplied by 30. So, 50 \u00d7 30.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 50 \u00d7 30 = 1500 widgets.\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should consider if there are any holidays or weekends in those 30 days that might affect production. The problem doesn't mention anything about the factory shutting down on certain days, so I'll assume it operates every day.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the production rate is constant. The problem says the factory produces 250 widgets in 5 days, which implies a constant rate, so I'll go with that.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the month has exactly 30 days. The problem specifies \"a month of 30 days,\" so I don't need to worry about different month lengths.\n\nSo, based on this, the factory should produce 1500 widgets in 30 days.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this problem. For example, using proportions.\n\nIf 5 days correspond to 250 widgets, then 30 days would correspond to x widgets.\n\nSo, I can set up a proportion: 5 days / 250 widgets = 30 days / x widgets.\n\nWait, actually, that would be 5/250 = 30/x, but that doesn't make sense because it should be vice versa.\n\nLet me think again. If 5 days correspond to 250 widgets, then the ratio is days to widgets.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of units.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as widgets per day.\n\nSo, 250 widgets / 5 days = 50 widgets/day.\n\nThen, 50 widgets/day \u00d7 30 days = 1500 widgets.\n\nYes, that seems consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to use the proportion method correctly, it should be:\n\nWidgets produced is directly proportional to the number of days.\n\nSo, 250 widgets / 5 days = x widgets / 30 days.\n\nSo, 250/5 = x/30.\n\nNow, solving for x: x = (250/5) \u00d7 30 = 50 \u00d7 30 = 1500 widgets.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nMaybe I can approach it using unit rates.\n\nThe unit rate is 50 widgets per day.\n\nSo, for 30 days, it's 50 widgets/day \u00d7 30 days = 1500 widgets.\n\nOr, dimensional analysis:\n\n250 widgets / 5 days = 50 widgets/day.\n\nThen, 50 widgets/day \u00d7 30 days = 1500 widgets.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion: the factory will produce 1500 widgets in 30 days.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. There doesn't seem to be any complicating factors in the problem, like variable production rates or downtime, so the answer should be 1500 widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1500} \\]"
