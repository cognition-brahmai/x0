Remove the stinger: If the stinger is still embedded in your skin, scrape it off with a credit card or fingernail. Do not pinch it with tweezers, as this can release more venom.\n\n2. Clean the area: Wash the affected area with soap and water to prevent infection.\n\n3. Apply a cold compress: Apply a cold pack or cloth to the affected area to reduce swelling and pain.\n\n4. Take antihistamines: Over-the-counter antihistamines can help relieve itching and swelling.\n\n5. Seek medical attention: If you experience severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or dizziness, call emergency services immediately.\n\nIt's also a good idea to carry an epinephrine auto-injector if you have a known allergy to bee stings. This can help prevent a severe allergic reaction in case of future stings."
