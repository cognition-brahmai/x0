Why did the knight break up with his girlfriend?\n\nBecause he found out she was just going through a phase\u2014she was only into him for his armor! Haha, get it? Armor and phases? Alright, maybe that one was a bit of a stretch.\n\nHere's another one: Why did the knight bring a ladder to the table?\n\nBecause he heard it was a high-table! Oh, that's a bad one, isn't it? I should come up with better jokes. Maybe something about knights and round tables.\n\nOkay, try this: Why did King Arthur bring a ladder to the round table meetings?\n\nBecause he wanted to add some height to the discussions! Hmm, still not great. Let me think differently.\n\nWhat if I told you a joke about a knight who couldn't sit at the round table? Why couldn't he sit at the round table?\n\nBecause he was square! Okay, that's a classic, but maybe you've heard it before.\n\nLet me try to make it more interesting. Imagine a knight named Sir Lancelot going to a modern-day caf\u00e9 and trying to sit at a round table covered in glass. What happens?\n\nHe tries to pull out the chair, but since it's a glass table, he can't see the legs and knocks everything over! The other knights laugh at him, but then they realize they're all wearing shiny armor and reflect the light, making it hard to see the table legs too. So, they all end up knocking over chairs and spilling drinks. In the end, they decide to have their meetings in a well-lit room with clear table edges. Phew, that was messy!\n\nAlright, enough of that. Do you have any other topics you'd like to joke about? Maybe something less medieval?"
