        "content": "So there are 4 red balls, 6 blue balls, and 10 green balls in the bag. I need to find the probability of picking either a red ball or a blue ball. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the total number of balls in the bag. That would be the sum of red, blue, and green balls. So, total balls = 4 red + 6 blue + 10 green = 20 balls.\n\nNow, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue ball.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of red balls plus the number of blue balls, which is 4 + 6 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the probability P of picking a red or blue ball is P = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 10 / 20 = 0.5.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Is there another way to look at this?\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of not picking a green ball, since picking a red or blue ball is the same as not picking a green one.\n\nThe number of green balls is 10, so the probability of picking a green ball is 10/20 = 0.5.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not picking a green ball is 1 - 0.5 = 0.5, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like the probability is 0.5, or 50%.\n\nBut maybe I should express it as a fraction instead of a decimal. 10/20 simplifies to 1/2, so that's another way to write it.\n\nAlso, in probability, it's sometimes useful to consider the ratios. Here, red and blue together are 10 balls out of 20, which is indeed 1/2.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The probability of picking a red or blue ball from the bag is 1/2 or 0.5 or 50%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.5} \\]"
