        "content": "So the population of the city is currently 200,000 and it increases by 5% every year. I need to find out what the population will be after 3 years.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a 5% increase means. Percentage increase can be calculated by multiplying the original amount by the percentage (expressed as a decimal) and then adding that to the original amount. So, for each year, the population would increase by 5% of the population at the beginning of that year.\n\nLet me try to calculate it step by step for each year.\n\n**Year 1:**\n\nOriginal population: 200,000\n\nIncrease: 5% of 200,000\n\nTo find 5% of 200,000, I can calculate 0.05 \u00d7 200,000.\n\n0.05 \u00d7 200,000 = 10,000\n\nSo, the population increases by 10,000 in the first year.\n\nNew population at the end of Year 1: 200,000 + 10,000 = 210,000\n\n**Year 2:**\n\nNow, the original population for Year 2 is 210,000.\n\nIncrease: 5% of 210,000\n\n0.05 \u00d7 210,000 = 10,500\n\nSo, the population increases by 10,500 in the second year.\n\nNew population at the end of Year 2: 210,000 + 10,500 = 220,500\n\n**Year 3:**\n\nOriginal population for Year 3 is 220,500.\n\nIncrease: 5% of 220,500\n\n0.05 \u00d7 220,500 = 11,025\n\nSo, the population increases by 11,025 in the third year.\n\nNew population at the end of Year 3: 220,500 + 11,025 = 231,525\n\nTherefore, the population after 3 years will be 231,525.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for compound interest, since this is similar to compound growth.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Future Value} = \\text{Present Value} \\times (1 + \\text{rate})^\\text{time} \\]\n\nIn this case:\n\n- Present Value = 200,000\n\n- Rate = 5% or 0.05\n\n- Time = 3 years\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Future Population} = 200,000 \\times (1 + 0.05)^3 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(1 + 0.05 = 1.05\\)\n\nThen, \\(1.05^3\\)\n\n1.05 \u00d7 1.05 = 1.1025\n\n1.1025 \u00d7 1.05 = 1.157625\n\nNow, multiply by the present population:\n\n200,000 \u00d7 1.157625 = 231,525\n\nSo, again, the population after 3 years will be 231,525.\n\nThis matches the result I got from calculating yearly increases, which is good.\n\nI can also check if this makes sense. Each year, the population increases by 5%, so it's growing exponentially. After 3 years, a 5% annual increase should lead to a total increase of a little over 15%, but because of compounding, it's a bit more, which in this case is 15.7625%.\n\nSo, starting from 200,000, a 15.7625% increase would be approximately 31,525, making the total population 231,525, which matches my calculation.\n\nTherefore, the population after 3 years will be 231,525.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{231525} \\]"
