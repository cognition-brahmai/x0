        "content": "In physics, time is considered as a dimension that is used to sequence events, quantify durations, and compare the intervals between them. It's integral to concepts like velocity, gravity, and relativity. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, time can dilate or contract depending on the speed at which an observer is moving relative to something else. However, unlike spatial dimensions, time has directionality - from the past through the present into the future. What does the term 'time dilation' refer to according to Einstein's theory of relativity?\nA) Speeding up of time with increased velocity\nB) Slowing down of time with decreased velocity\nC) Slowing down of time with increased velocity\nD) Reversal of time with increased velocity"

        "content": "According to Einstein's theory of relativity, time dilation refers to the phenomenon where time appears to slow down for an object in motion compared to an object at rest, when observed from the perspective of the object at rest. This effect becomes more pronounced as the object approaches the speed of light. Therefore, the correct answer is C) Slowing down of time with increased velocity."
