        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Implementing a recursive function in Go to calculate the factorial of an integer is straightforward. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It's denoted by n!.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\n// factorial calculates the factorial of a given integer n recursively.\n// n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1\n// Note: Factorial is not defined for negative numbers, and 0! is 1.\nfunc factorial(n int) int {\n    if n < 0 {\n        // Handle negative input, perhaps return an error or a special value.\n        // For simplicity, we'll return -1 to indicate an error.\n        return -1\n    }\n    if n == 0 {\n        return 1\n    }\n    return n * factorial(n-1)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    // Test the factorial function\n    testValues := []int{5, 0, -1, 10}\n    for _, val := range testValues {\n        result := factorial(val)\n        if result == -1 {\n            fmt.Printf(\"factorial(%d) is undefined\\n\", val)\n        } else {\n            fmt.Printf(\"factorial(%d) = %d\\n\", val, result)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Function Definition**:\n   - `factorial(n int) int`: This function takes an integer `n` and returns its factorial as an integer.\n   \n2. **Base Cases**:\n   - If `n` is negative, factorial is undefined, so we return `-1` to indicate an error.\n   - If `n` is `0`, the factorial is `1`.\n\n3. **Recursive Case**:\n   - For positive integers, `n! = n * (n-1)!`. The function calls itself with `n-1` until it reaches the base case.\n\n4. **Main Function**:\n   - We test the `factorial` function with a list of test values: `5`, `0`, `-1`, and `10`.\n   - For each value, we print the result or a message indicating if the factorial is undefined.\n\nThis implementation is simple and demonstrates the basic concept of recursion in Go. However, for large values of `n`, this recursive approach may lead to a stack overflow because Go doesn't optimize tail recursion. For such cases, an iterative approach or using memoization techniques would be more appropriate."
