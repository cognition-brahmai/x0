        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to find the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle where the two legs measure 5 cm and 12 cm. And I'm supposed to use the Pythagorean theorem to do that, step by step. Alright, let's dive into it.\n\nFirst things first, I need to remember what the Pythagorean theorem is. I think it's something like a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse, and a and b are the legs of the triangle. Yeah, that sounds right. So, in this case, a is 5 cm, and b is 12 cm.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that I have the right formula. Let me recall: in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. So, yes, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2.\n\nAlright, so I have a = 5 cm and b = 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, that gives me:\n\n5\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n\nNow, I need to calculate 5 squared and 12 squared. 5 squared is 25, and 12 squared is 144. So, that's:\n\n25 + 144 = c\u00b2\n\nAdding those up, 25 plus 144 is 169. So, c\u00b2 = 169.\n\nNow, to find c, I need to take the square root of both sides. The square root of 169 is 13. So, c = 13 cm.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nLet me think again. Pythagorean theorem: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse. Yes, that's correct. And the square root of 169 is indeed 13. But, just to be thorough, maybe I should verify if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the properties of Pythagorean triples. I know that 5-12-13 is a Pythagorean triple, meaning that 5 and 12 are the legs, and 13 is the hypotenuse. So, that matches what I just calculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I could use trigonometry to find the angles and then find the hypotenuse, but that seems more complicated for this straightforward problem. The Pythagorean theorem is definitely the way to go here.\n\nLet me also consider if the triangle is drawn differently or if there's any trick here. But, since it's a right-angled triangle with legs 5 and 12, and I'm to find the hypotenuse, there shouldn't be any tricks involved. It's a straightforward application of the theorem.\n\nJust to be extra sure, maybe I can plug the values back into the theorem to verify.\n\nSo, a = 5, b = 12, c = 13.\n\nCheck: 5\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 = 25 + 144 = 169, and c\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169. Yes, it checks out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the triangle in terms of scaling. I know that 5-12-13 is a well-known Pythagorean triple, so unless there's some scaling factor, the hypotenuse should be 13 when the legs are 5 and 12.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the legs are exactly 5 cm and 12 cm, so no scaling is needed. Therefore, the hypotenuse is 13 cm.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways: directly through the theorem, by recognizing it as a Pythagorean triple, and by checking the calculations.\n\nJust to be comprehensive, maybe I should consider the units. The legs are given in centimeters, so the hypotenuse should also be in centimeters. So, 13 cm is correct.\n\nIs there any other aspect to this problem that I might have overlooked? Perhaps considering whether the triangle is drawn to scale or not, but since it's a right-angled triangle with given leg lengths, the hypotenuse is uniquely determined by the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The length of the hypotenuse is definitely 13 cm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13 \\text{ cm}} \\]"
