        "content": "So, I've got this problem here about a factory's production costs. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, the factory is producing 100 units per day, and each unit costs $10. So, the total cost for 100 units is 100 units times $10 per unit, which is $1,000. Got it.\n\nNow, if they increase production to 150 units per day, the cost per unit drops to $8. So, the total cost for 150 units is 150 units times $8 per unit, which is $1,200.\n\nI need to find the marginal cost of producing an additional 50 units. Marginal cost is the cost to produce one more unit, but since it's for 50 units, I'll calculate the total cost increase and then divide by the number of additional units.\n\nSo, the total cost increased from $1,000 to $1,200 when production increased by 50 units. The increase in total cost is $1,200 minus $1,000, which is $200.\n\nNow, to find the marginal cost per unit, I'll divide the total cost increase by the number of additional units produced. That's $200 divided by 50 units, which is $4 per unit.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that marginal cost can also be thought of as the change in total cost divided by the change in quantity. So, change in total cost is $200, and change in quantity is 50 units, which again gives $4 per unit.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another way to look at this. Maybe I should consider the average cost before and after the production increase.\n\nInitially, the average cost was $10 per unit, and after increasing production, it's $8 per unit. So, the average cost decreased by $2 per unit.\n\nBut marginal cost is not the same as average cost. Marginal cost is the cost of producing the next unit, which in this case, over 50 units, seems to be $4 per unit.\n\nHmm, maybe there's something I'm missing here. Let me see if there's another approach.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the total cost function. If I could express total cost as a function of quantity, then the marginal cost would be the derivative of total cost with respect to quantity.\n\nBut I don't have the exact functional form of the total cost curve. I only have two data points: at 100 units, total cost is $1,000, and at 150 units, it's $1,200.\n\nWith just these two points, I can calculate the average marginal cost between them, which is what I did earlier: $200 divided by 50 units, equaling $4 per unit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more precise way to calculate marginal cost, but with the information given, I think this is the straightforward approach.\n\nSo, the marginal cost of producing an additional 50 units is $4 per unit.\n\nWait, but I recall that marginal cost can vary with the level of production, especially if there are economies of scale or diseconomies of scale.\n\nIn this case, since the cost per unit decreases when production increases from 100 to 150 units, it suggests that there are economies of scale in this range.\n\nSo, the average cost decreases, which is consistent with decreasing marginal costs if the marginal cost is below the average cost.\n\nBut in my calculation, the marginal cost of $4 is less than the new average cost of $8, which seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, no. If marginal cost is below average cost, it pulls the average cost down. So, if marginal cost is $4 and average cost is $8, producing additional units will decrease the average cost, which is what happened here.\n\nInitially, average cost was $10, and after producing more, it's $8, so marginal cost must have been below $8.\n\nMy calculation shows marginal cost is $4 per additional unit, which is consistent with the average cost decreasing to $8.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the total cost increase and see if there's a fixed cost or variable cost component.\n\nSuppose there is a fixed cost and a variable cost. Let\u2019s denote total cost as TC = FC + VC(Q), where FC is fixed cost and VC is variable cost depending on quantity Q.\n\nFrom the first scenario:\n\nTC1 = FC + VC(100) = $1,000\n\nFrom the second scenario:\n\nTC2 = FC + VC(150) = $1,200\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\nVC(150) - VC(100) = $200\n\nSo, the increase in variable cost for producing an additional 50 units is $200.\n\nTherefore, the marginal cost per unit is $200 / 50 units = $4 per unit.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I assume that variable cost is linear, meaning VC(Q) = MC * Q, where MC is marginal cost, then:\n\nVC(100) = MC * 100\n\nVC(150) = MC * 150\n\nThen, TC1 = FC + MC * 100 = $1,000\n\nTC2 = FC + MC * 150 = $1,200\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\nMC * 50 = $200\n\nSo, MC = $200 / 50 = $4 per unit.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nBut perhaps variable cost is not linear, and there are economies of scale, meaning that marginal cost decreases as quantity increases.\n\nIn that case, marginal cost for the first 100 units might be higher, and for the next 50 units, it's lower.\n\nBut with the information given, I think assuming a linear variable cost is acceptable for this problem.\n\nTherefore, the marginal cost of producing an additional 50 units is $4 per unit.\n\nSo, the answer is $4 per unit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
