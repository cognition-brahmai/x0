The son decided to buy 100 animals for $100, with the condition that he must get at least one of each type of animal. He could only choose from cows, pigs, and sheep. Cows cost $10 each, pigs cost $3 each, and sheep cost $0.50 each. How many of each animal did the son buy?"

        "content": "Let's see. So, the son has $100 to spend on exactly 100 animals, and he must buy at least one of each type: cows, pigs, and sheep. The prices are $10 for a cow, $3 for a pig, and $0.50 for a sheep. Hmm, this seems like a bit of a puzzle.\n\nFirst, I need to set up equations based on the information given. Let's denote:\n\n- \\( c \\) as the number of cows,\n\n- \\( p \\) as the number of pigs,\n\n- \\( s \\) as the number of sheep.\n\nFrom the problem, we have two main conditions:\n\n1. The total number of animals is 100:\n\n\\[ c + p + s = 100 \\]\n\n2. The total cost is $100:\n\n\\[ 10c + 3p + 0.5s = 100 \\]\n\nAlso, we have the constraints:\n\n\\[ c \\geq 1, \\quad p \\geq 1, \\quad s \\geq 1 \\]\n\nSince we have two equations and three variables, we'll need to find a relationship between them to solve for the numbers.\n\nMaybe I can express one variable in terms of the others using one equation and substitute into the second equation.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ s = 100 - c - p \\]\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 10c + 3p + 0.5(100 - c - p) = 100 \\]\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n\\[ 10c + 3p + 50 - 0.5c - 0.5p = 100 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ (10c - 0.5c) + (3p - 0.5p) + 50 = 100 \\]\n\n\\[ 9.5c + 2.5p + 50 = 100 \\]\n\nSubtract 50 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 9.5c + 2.5p = 50 \\]\n\nHmm, dealing with decimals isn't too bad, but maybe I can eliminate them by multiplying the entire equation by 2:\n\n\\[ 19c + 5p = 100 \\]\n\nThat's better. Now, I have:\n\n\\[ 19c + 5p = 100 \\]\n\nAnd I need to find integer values for \\( c \\) and \\( p \\) since you can't buy a fraction of an animal.\n\nAlso, remember that \\( s = 100 - c - p \\), and \\( s \\) must be at least 1, so \\( c + p \\leq 99 \\).\n\nLet's solve for \\( p \\) in terms of \\( c \\):\n\n\\[ 5p = 100 - 19c \\]\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{100 - 19c}{5} \\]\n\nSince \\( p \\) must be an integer, \\( 100 - 19c \\) must be divisible by 5.\n\nLet's consider the possible values of \\( c \\). Since \\( c \\) is at least 1 and cows are $10 each, and we have $100, the maximum number of cows he can buy is \\( \\lfloor 100 / 10 \\rfloor = 10 \\).\n\nSo, \\( c \\) can be from 1 to 10.\n\nNow, we need \\( 100 - 19c \\) to be divisible by 5.\n\nLet's check each possible \\( c \\):\n\nFor \\( c = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ 100 - 19(1) = 81 \\]\n\n81 divided by 5 is 16.2, which is not an integer.\n\nFor \\( c = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ 100 - 19(2) = 100 - 38 = 62 \\]\n\n62 / 5 = 12.4, not an integer.\n\nFor \\( c = 3 \\):\n\n\\[ 100 - 19(3) = 100 - 57 = 43 \\]\n\n43 / 5 = 8.6, not an integer.\n\nFor \\( c = 4 \\):\n\n\\[ 100 - 19(4) = 100 - 76 = 24 \\]\n\n24 / 5 = 4.8, not an integer.\n\nFor \\( c = 5 \\):\n\n\\[ 100 - 19(5) = 100 - 95 = 5 \\]\n\n5 / 5 = 1, which is an integer.\n\nSo, \\( c = 5 \\) and \\( p = 1 \\).\n\nLet's check if this satisfies the original equations.\n\nFirst, \\( c + p + s = 100 \\):\n\n\\[ 5 + 1 + s = 100 \\]\n\n\\[ s = 94 \\]\n\nNow, check the cost:\n\n\\[ 10(5) + 3(1) + 0.5(94) = 50 + 3 + 47 = 100 \\]\n\nPerfect, it adds up.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says he must buy at least one of each animal, which he does: 5 cows, 1 pig, and 94 sheep.\n\nBut let's check if there are other possible values of \\( c \\) that might work.\n\nContinuing from earlier:\n\nFor \\( c = 6 \\):\n\n\\[ 100 - 19(6) = 100 - 114 = -14 \\]\n\nNegative value, which doesn't make sense.\n\nSimilarly, higher values of \\( c \\) will result in larger negative numbers, so \\( c = 5 \\) is the only feasible solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed something. Maybe I should consider that \\( p \\) could be zero, but the problem says at least one of each animal, so \\( p \\) must be at least 1.\n\nWait, no, the problem says he must buy at least one of each type: cows, pigs, and sheep.\n\nSo, \\( c \\geq 1 \\), \\( p \\geq 1 \\), and \\( s \\geq 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( c = 5 \\), \\( p = 1 \\), and \\( s = 94 \\) is the only solution that satisfies all conditions.\n\nLet me verify again.\n\nTotal animals: 5 + 1 + 94 = 100\n\nTotal cost: 5*10 + 1*3 + 94*0.5 = 50 + 3 + 47 = 100\n\nPerfect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another combination if we consider different values.\n\nWait, what if \\( c = 0 \\), but that's not allowed because he must buy at least one of each.\n\nSimilarly, \\( p = 0 \\) is not allowed.\n\nSo, indeed, the only solution is 5 cows, 1 pig, and 94 sheep.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 \\text{ cows}, 1 \\text{ pig}, 94 \\text{ sheep}} \\]"
