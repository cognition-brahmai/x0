        "content": "To calculate the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x\u00b2 + 4x - 5, we'll use the rules of differentiation. The derivative measures how the function changes as its input changes. In calculus, this is essential for understanding rates of change and slopes of tangent lines.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the function:**\n   f(x) = 3x\u00b2 + 4x - 5\n   This is a polynomial function consisting of three terms: 3x\u00b2, 4x, and -5.\n\n2. **Apply the power rule:**\n   The power rule states that if f(x) = x\u207f, where n is any real number, then the derivative f'(x) = n * x\u207f\u207b\u00b9.\n\n   - For the term 3x\u00b2:\n     Here, n = 2.\n     So, the derivative is 3 * 2 * x\u00b2\u207b\u00b9 = 6x.\n\n   - For the term 4x:\n     Here, n = 1.\n     So, the derivative is 4 * 1 * x\u00b9\u207b\u00b9 = 4.\n\n   - For the constant term -5:\n     The derivative of a constant is zero because constants don't change.\n\n3. **Combine the derivatives of each term:**\n   f'(x) = derivative of 3x\u00b2 + derivative of 4x + derivative of (-5)\n   f'(x) = 6x + 4 + 0\n   f'(x) = 6x + 4\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = 3x\u00b2 + 4x - 5 is f'(x) = 6x + 4.\n\n**Explanation:**\n- The power rule is applied to each term individually.\n- For 3x\u00b2, the exponent 2 is brought down as a coefficient and multiplied by 3, then the exponent is reduced by 1, resulting in 6x.\n- For 4x, the exponent 1 is brought down and multiplied by 4, then the exponent is reduced by 1, resulting in 4.\n- The derivative of -5 is 0 because it's a constant.\n\nThis method works for any polynomial function, where you can differentiate each term separately using the power rule and then sum them up to get the derivative of the entire function.\n\n**Additional Insight:**\nThe derivative f'(x) = 6x + 4 represents the instantaneous rate of change of f(x) at any point x. It also gives the slope of the tangent line to the curve of f(x) at that point. For example, if you want to find the slope at x = 1, you can plug x = 1 into f'(x):\n\nf'(1) = 6(1) + 4 = 10\n\nThis means that at x = 1, the slope of the tangent line to the curve f(x) is 10.\n\n**Graphical Interpretation:**\n- The original function f(x) = 3x\u00b2 + 4x - 5 is a parabola opening upwards.\n- Its derivative f'(x) = 6x + 4 is a straight line.\n- The value of f'(x) at any x gives the slope of the tangent to f(x) at that x.\n\n**Critical Points:**\nTo find critical points, set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n6x + 4 = 0\n6x = -4\nx = -4/6 = -2/3\n\nSo, x = -2/3 is a critical point. This could be a local minimum, maximum, or a point of inflection. For quadratic functions like this, it's a vertex.\n\n**Second Derivative Test:**\nTo determine the nature of the critical point, we can use the second derivative.\n\nFirst, find the second derivative f''(x):\n\nf'(x) = 6x + 4\nf''(x) = 6\n\nSince f''(x) = 6 > 0, the function is concave up at x = -2/3, indicating a local minimum.\n\n**Practical Application:**\nDerivatives are used in various fields such as physics, engineering, economics, and more. For instance, in physics, the derivative of position with respect to time is velocity, and the derivative of velocity is acceleration.\n\n**Common Mistakes:**\n- Forgetting to reduce the exponent by 1 when applying the power rule.\n- Misapplying the constant multiple rule (the derivative of c*f(x) is c*f'(x), where c is a constant).\n- Thinking that the derivative of a constant is not zero.\n\n**Practice Problem:**\nTry finding the derivative of g(x) = 5x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 + 7x - 3 using the power rule.\n\n**Solution:**\ng'(x) = 15x\u00b2 - 4x + 7\n\n**Explanation:**\n- Derivative of 5x\u00b3: 15x\u00b2\n- Derivative of -2x\u00b2: -4x\n- Derivative of 7x: 7\n- Derivative of -3: 0\n- Sum them up: 15x\u00b2 - 4x + 7\n\n**Conclusion:**\nUnderstanding how to compute derivatives of polynomial functions is fundamental in calculus. It lays the groundwork for more complex differentiation rules and applications. By practicing with various functions, you can reinforce your understanding and proficiency in this essential mathematical tool.\n\n**Further Reading:**\n- Chain rule\n- Product rule\n- Quotient rule\n- Implicit differentiation\n- Applications of derivatives in optimization and related rates problems.\n\n**Resources:**\n- Calculus textbooks (e.g., Stewart's Calculus)\n- Online tutorials and video lectures\n- Practice problem sets and worksheets\n\n**Note:**\nIf you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!\n\n**End of Explanation**"
