        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a cruise ship company that offers a 7-day trip with stops at three different ports: Port A, Port B, and Port C. The ship has a maximum capacity of 4,000 passengers and usually operates at 90% occupancy. That means, on average, there are 4,000 times 0.9 equals 3,600 passengers on board.\n\nNow, each port charges docking fees based on the number of passengers who go ashore. Port A charges $10 per passenger, Port B charges $12, and Port C charges $8. The problem says to assume that all passengers disembark at each port. So, for each port, the docking fee would be the number of passengers times the per passenger charge.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the docking fee for Port A:\n3,600 passengers times $10 per passenger equals $36,000.\n\nNext, for Port B:\n3,600 passengers times $12 per passenger equals $43,200.\n\nAnd for Port C:\n3,600 passengers times $8 per passenger equals $28,800.\n\nNow, to find the total docking fees for one round-trip voyage, we need to add up these amounts.\n\nSo, $36,000 plus $43,200 equals $79,200.\n\nThen, $79,200 plus $28,800 equals $108,000.\n\nTherefore, the total docking fees for one round-trip voyage would be $108,000.\n\nWait a minute, but the trip is a round trip, which means it goes out and comes back. Does that mean it visits the ports twice? The problem says it's a 7-day trip with stops at three different ports, and it's a round-trip voyage. Hmm, I need to make sure I understand this correctly.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"a 7-day trip with stops at three different ports.\" It doesn't specify if it's a round trip in terms of visiting the ports multiple times or if it's a round trip in terms of starting and ending at the same port.\n\nGiven that it's a round-trip voyage, it probably means the ship starts and ends at the same port, but it's not clear if it visits each port once or multiple times.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"a 7-day trip with stops at three different ports,\" and it asks for the total docking fees for one round-trip voyage, assuming all passengers disembark at each port.\n\nI think it's safe to assume that each port is visited once per voyage, and all passengers disembark at each port.\n\nSo, based on that, my initial calculation should hold: total docking fees equal $108,000.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if the ship makes multiple stops at each port during the voyage. The problem says \"stops at three different ports,\" which could imply three distinct stops, one at each port.\n\nGiven that, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a round-trip and it visits each port twice (once going out and once coming back), then I might need to double the docking fees.\n\nBut the problem specifies \"a 7-day trip with stops at three different ports,\" which likely means three stops, one at each port.\n\nAlso, it mentions \"one round-trip voyage,\" and it's a 7-day trip, so it's probably visiting each port once and then returning to the starting point without additional stops.\n\nTo be extra sure, let's consider the sequence:\n\nDay 1: Depart from home port.\n\nDay 2: Stop at Port A.\n\nDay 3: Stop at Port B.\n\nDay 4: Stop at Port C.\n\nDay 5: At sea.\n\nDay 6: At sea.\n\nDay 7: Return to home port.\n\nIn this scenario, the ship stops at each port once, and then returns home.\n\nTherefore, each port is visited only once per voyage, and thus the docking fees are calculated based on one visit per port.\n\nHence, the total docking fees are $108,000 for one round-trip voyage.\n\nBut just to cover all bases, let's consider another possibility: perhaps the round-trip voyage includes multiple rounds, visiting the ports multiple times.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies \"one round-trip voyage,\" which typically means a single journey out and back, with stops along the way.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation is correct.\n\nTotal docking fees = $36,000 (Port A) + $43,200 (Port B) + $28,800 (Port C) = $108,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{108000} \\]"
