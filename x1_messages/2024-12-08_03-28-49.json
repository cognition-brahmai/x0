        "content": "Let's see. There's a bus that leaves Town A for Town B every 20 minutes starting at 6:00 AM, and the distance between them is 60 miles. The bus goes at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour. I need to find out how many buses will have arrived in Town B by 12:00 PM.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how long it takes for one bus to travel from Town A to Town B. Given that the distance is 60 miles and the speed is 40 miles per hour, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, Time = 60 miles / 40 mph = 1.5 hours, which is 90 minutes.\n\nThat means each bus takes 90 minutes to get from Town A to Town B.\n\nNow, buses are leaving every 20 minutes starting at 6:00 AM. I need to find out how many of these buses will have completed their journey and arrived in Town B by 12:00 PM.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many buses leave between 6:00 AM and 12:00 PM.\n\nFrom 6:00 AM to 12:00 PM is 6 hours.\n\nEach hour has 60 minutes, so 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes.\n\nBuses leave every 20 minutes, so the number of buses that leave in 360 minutes is 360 / 20 = 18 buses.\n\nBut wait, that's the number of buses that leave between 6:00 AM and 12:00 PM. However, since each bus takes 90 minutes to arrive, not all of them will have arrived by 12:00 PM.\n\nI need to find out which of these buses have had enough time to complete their 90-minute journey by 12:00 PM.\n\nLet me think about this differently. I need to find out the latest time a bus can leave Town A and still arrive by 12:00 PM.\n\nSince the travel time is 90 minutes, or 1 hour and 30 minutes, the latest departure time would be 12:00 PM - 90 minutes = 10:30 AM.\n\nSo, any bus that leaves at or before 10:30 AM will arrive by 12:00 PM.\n\nNow, let's find out how many buses leave between 6:00 AM and 10:30 AM.\n\nFrom 6:00 AM to 10:30 AM is 4 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nConverting that to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes, plus 30 minutes = 270 minutes.\n\nBuses leave every 20 minutes, so the number of buses in 270 minutes is 270 / 20.\n\nBut 270 divided by 20 is 13.5.\n\nSince you can't have half a bus, I need to interpret this. It means that 13 full buses have left, and there's half of another bus's interval, but since buses leave at discrete times, I need to see if there's a bus at exactly 10:30 AM.\n\nLet's check the departure times.\n\nFirst bus at 6:00 AM.\n\nNext at 6:20 AM, 6:40 AM, 7:00 AM, 7:20 AM, 7:40 AM, 8:00 AM, 8:20 AM, 8:40 AM, 9:00 AM, 9:20 AM, 9:40 AM, 10:00 AM, 10:20 AM, and 10:40 AM.\n\nWait, but 10:40 AM is after 10:30 AM, so the bus at 10:20 AM is the last one that leaves before or at 10:30 AM.\n\nLet's confirm:\n\n6:00, 6:20, 6:40, 7:00, 7:20, 7:40, 8:00, 8:20, 8:40, 9:00, 9:20, 9:40, 10:00, 10:20, 10:40.\n\nSo, up to 10:20 AM.\n\nNow, from 6:00 AM to 10:20 AM is how many intervals of 20 minutes?\n\nLet's calculate the time between 6:00 AM and 10:20 AM.\n\nFrom 6:00 to 10:00 is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.\n\nPlus 20 minutes to reach 10:20, so total 260 minutes.\n\nNumber of buses: 260 / 20 = 13 buses.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 14 buses.\n\nLet me list them again:\n\n6:00, 6:20, 6:40, 7:00, 7:20, 7:40, 8:00, 8:20, 8:40, 9:00, 9:20, 9:40, 10:00, 10:20.\n\nThat's 14 buses.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier.\n\nLet me count again:\n\n6:00 (1), 6:20 (2), 6:40 (3), 7:00 (4), 7:20 (5), 7:40 (6), 8:00 (7), 8:20 (8), 8:40 (9), 9:00 (10), 9:20 (11), 9:40 (12), 10:00 (13), 10:20 (14).\n\nYes, 14 buses.\n\nSo, 14 buses leave between 6:00 AM and 10:20 AM, and each takes 90 minutes to arrive.\n\nSo, the bus that leaves at 10:20 AM will arrive at Town B at 10:20 AM + 90 minutes = 11:50 AM.\n\nWhich is before 12:00 PM, so all 14 buses will have arrived by 12:00 PM.\n\nBut wait, the bus that leaves at 10:20 AM arrives at 11:50 AM, which is before 12:00 PM, and the next bus at 10:40 AM would arrive at 12:10 PM, which is after 12:00 PM.\n\nSo, the bus at 10:40 AM arrives after 12:00 PM, so it doesn't count.\n\nTherefore, the number of buses that arrive by 12:00 PM is 14.\n\nWait, but let's double-check.\n\nBus departure times:\n\n6:00 AM -> arrives at 7:30 AM\n\n6:20 AM -> 8:00 AM\n\n6:40 AM -> 8:30 AM\n\n7:00 AM -> 9:00 AM\n\n7:20 AM -> 9:30 AM\n\n7:40 AM -> 10:00 AM\n\n8:00 AM -> 10:30 AM\n\n8:20 AM -> 11:00 AM\n\n8:40 AM -> 11:30 AM\n\n9:00 AM -> 12:00 PM\n\nWait, 9:00 AM + 90 minutes is 10:30 AM, not 12:00 PM.\n\nWait, no, 9:00 AM + 90 minutes is 10:30 AM.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me recalculate the arrival times:\n\nDeparture time + 90 minutes = arrival time.\n\nSo, 9:00 AM + 90 minutes = 10:30 AM\n\n10:00 AM + 90 minutes = 11:30 AM\n\n10:20 AM + 90 minutes = 11:50 AM\n\nYes, so the bus that departs at 10:20 AM arrives at 11:50 AM, which is before 12:00 PM.\n\nThe next bus at 10:40 AM would arrive at 12:10 PM, which is after 12:00 PM.\n\nSo, buses departing up to and including 10:20 AM arrive by 12:00 PM.\n\nNow, counting the buses from 6:00 AM to 10:20 AM in 20-minute intervals.\n\n6:00, 6:20, 6:40, 7:00, 7:20, 7:40, 8:00, 8:20, 8:40, 9:00, 9:20, 9:40, 10:00, 10:20.\n\nThat's 14 buses.\n\nTherefore, 14 buses arrive in Town B by 12:00 PM.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I need to consider that the first bus arrives at 7:30 AM, and the last relevant bus arrives at 11:50 AM, all within the time frame up to 12:00 PM.\n\nSo, yes, 14 buses arrive by 12:00 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
