        "content": "So, if every person has 2 parents, then in one generation back, that's 2 ancestors. In two generations back, each of those 2 parents has 2 parents of their own, so that's 4 grandparents. Then, in three generations back, each of those 4 grandparents has 2 parents, which would be 8 great-grandparents.\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n- Generation 1: 2 parents\n\n- Generation 2: 4 grandparents\n\n- Generation 3: 8 great-grandparents\n\nTotal ancestors in three generations: 2 + 4 + 8 = 14 ancestors.\n\nBut wait, is there any overlap here? For example, if some of your grandparents are related to each other, then some of your great-grandparents might be the same person. But assuming no overlap, which is the case if there's no intermarriage among relatives, then the total is 14.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that some ancestors might be shared, like if your mother and father share some ancestors, then the total number would be less than 14. But since the question doesn't specify any intermarriage or overlapping ancestors, I'll stick with the assumption that all ancestors are unique.\n\nSo, the answer is 14 ancestors in three generations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
