        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: In a room full of people, 40% are wearing glasses, 30% are wearing hats, and 10% are wearing both glasses and hats. I need to find out what percentage of people are not wearing either glasses or hats.\n\nOkay, so first, I should probably figure out how many people are wearing either glasses or hats or both. Then, I can subtract that from 100% to get the percentage of people wearing neither.\n\nI remember there's a principle in set theory called the inclusion-exclusion principle that might be useful here. It says that to find the total number of elements in two sets, you add the sizes of the sets and subtract the intersection to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, let's apply that here.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- G = percentage wearing glasses = 40%\n\n- H = percentage wearing hats = 30%\n\n- Both = percentage wearing both glasses and hats = 10%\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nPercentage wearing glasses or hats = G + H - Both\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n= 40% + 30% - 10% = 60%\n\nSo, 60% of the people are wearing either glasses or hats or both.\n\nNow, to find the percentage not wearing either, I subtract this from 100%:\n\n100% - 60% = 40%\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to look at this to confirm?\n\nMaybe I can think in terms of Venn diagrams. Imagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents people wearing glasses, and the other represents people wearing hats.\n\n- The glasses circle is 40%.\n\n- The hats circle is 30%.\n\n- The overlapping area, where people wear both, is 10%.\n\nSo, the total area covered by at least one of the circles is the sum of the individual areas minus the overlap.\n\nAgain, that's 40% + 30% - 10% = 60%.\n\nThen, the area outside both circles, which represents people not wearing either, is 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there any possibility of people wearing neither being less or more than 40% based on other interpretations?\n\nWait, another way to approach this could be to use the formula for the union of two sets:\n\nn(A \u222a B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \u2229 B)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n(A) is the number of people wearing glasses = 40%\n\n- n(B) is the number of people wearing hats = 30%\n\n- n(A \u2229 B) is the number of people wearing both = 10%\n\nSo, n(A \u222a B) = 40% + 30% - 10% = 60%\n\nAnd the complement of this, which is neither, would be 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nI keep getting 40%. Maybe I can try a different approach to verify.\n\nLet\u2019s assume there are 100 people in the room for simplicity.\n\n- 40 people are wearing glasses.\n\n- 30 people are wearing hats.\n\n- 10 people are wearing both.\n\nSo, the number of people wearing only glasses is 40 - 10 = 30.\n\nThe number of people wearing only hats is 30 - 10 = 20.\n\nThe number wearing both is 10.\n\nSo, total wearing either or both is 30 + 20 + 10 = 60.\n\nTherefore, the number wearing neither is 100 - 60 = 40.\n\nAgain, 40%.\n\nIs there any chance that some people might be wearing neither, but I haven't accounted for some overlap or something?\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider if there are people wearing only glasses, only hats, both, or neither. I think I've covered that in the above approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could use probability concepts. If I consider the probabilities:\n\n- P(Glasses) = 40%\n\n- P(Hats) = 30%\n\n- P(Glasses and Hats) = 10%\n\nThen, P(Glasses or Hats) = P(Glasses) + P(Hats) - P(Glasses and Hats) = 40% + 30% - 10% = 60%\n\nAnd P(Neither) = 1 - P(Glasses or Hats) = 1 - 60% = 40%\n\nSame result again.\n\nI think I'm consistently getting 40% through different methods, so I can confidently say that 40% of the people in the room are not wearing either glasses or hats.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40\\%} \\]"
