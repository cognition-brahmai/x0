        "content": "That's a fascinating question! The ancient city you're referring to is Pompeii. Located near modern Naples in the Italian region of Campania, Pompeii was indeed buried under volcanic ash and pumice in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D. This catastrophic event preserved the city in remarkable detail, providing an invaluable glimpse into Roman life during the 1st century.\n\nThe eruption was so devastating that it not only buried Pompeii but also nearby towns such as Herculaneum and Stabiae.
