        "content": "So I've got this problem here: If 50 workers can build 50 cars in 50 days, how long would it take 25 workers to build 25 cars? Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of workers, the number of cars, and the time it takes. It seems like a problem about work rates.\n\nIf 50 workers can build 50 cars in 50 days, that means each worker is building one car in 50 days, right? Because 50 workers divided by 50 cars is 1 car per worker.\n\nWait, but that might not be entirely accurate. Maybe I should think in terms of worker-days. Like, how many worker-days does it take to build one car?\n\nSo, 50 workers working for 50 days would be 50 workers * 50 days = 2500 worker-days to build 50 cars. Therefore, for one car, it would be 2500 / 50 = 50 worker-days per car.\n\nOkay, so each car requires 50 worker-days to be completed.\n\nNow, if I have 25 workers and they need to build 25 cars, how many worker-days would be needed in total?\n\nSince each car needs 50 worker-days, 25 cars would require 25 * 50 = 1250 worker-days.\n\nNow, if I have 25 workers, how many days would it take for them to accumulate 1250 worker-days?\n\nWell, if 25 workers work for D days, they would provide 25 * D worker-days.\n\nSet that equal to 1250: 25 * D = 1250.\n\nSolving for D: D = 1250 / 25 = 50 days.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If I halved the number of workers and halved the number of cars, why is it still taking the same amount of time?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf one car requires 50 worker-days, then 25 cars would require 25 * 50 = 1250 worker-days, as I calculated before.\n\nNow, with 25 workers, working D days, they provide 25D worker-days.\n\nSetting 25D = 1250, D = 50 days.\n\nBut intuitively, if I have half the workers and half the cars, it should take the same time, because each worker is still building one car, and it takes 50 days per car.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that each worker builds one car in 50 days, so with 25 workers building 25 cars, it should still take 50 days.\n\nBut let's check another way.\n\nSuppose we have 50 workers building 50 cars in 50 days.\n\nThat means, the rate of work is 50 cars / 50 days = 1 car per day for the entire group of 50 workers.\n\nSo, per worker, it's 1 car per day / 50 workers = 0.02 cars per day per worker.\n\nNow, if I have 25 workers, their combined rate is 25 workers * 0.02 cars/day/worker = 0.5 cars per day.\n\nNow, to build 25 cars at a rate of 0.5 cars per day, it would take 25 / 0.5 = 50 days.\n\nAgain, I'm getting 50 days.\n\nBut somehow, this doesn't feel right. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose one worker takes T days to build one car.\n\nThen, 50 workers working for 50 days can build 50 cars.\n\nSo, the total work is 50 workers * 50 days = 2500 worker-days for 50 cars.\n\nAs before, that's 50 worker-days per car.\n\nNow, for 25 workers to build 25 cars, it should be 25 cars * 50 worker-days per car = 1250 worker-days.\n\nWith 25 workers, it would take 1250 / 25 = 50 days.\n\nWait, I'm getting the same answer again.\n\nMaybe it is 50 days.\n\nBut intuitively, if I have half the workers and half the cars, the time remains the same.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLet me consider another example.\n\nIf 100 workers can build 100 cars in 50 days, then following the same logic, it would still take 50 days for 50 workers to build 50 cars.\n\nWait, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, in general, it seems that the time remains constant as long as the ratio of workers to cars remains the same.\n\nIn the original scenario, we have 50 workers for 50 cars in 50 days.\n\nIn the new scenario, 25 workers for 25 cars still takes 50 days.\n\nSo, the answer should be 50 days.\n\nBut let's confirm with another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s think in terms of work rate per worker.\n\nIf 50 workers build 50 cars in 50 days, then each worker is building one car in 50 days.\n\nSo, each worker's rate is 1 car per 50 days.\n\nNow, if I have 25 workers, each building one car in 50 days, then together they can build 25 cars in 50 days.\n\nTherefore, the time remains 50 days.\n\nAll these approaches are leading me to the same conclusion.\n\nSo, the answer should be 50 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
