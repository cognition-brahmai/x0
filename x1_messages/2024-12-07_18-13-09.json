        "content": "The 1976 Summer Olympics were held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The Games took place from July 17 to August 1, 1976, and were officially known as the Games of the XXI Olympiad. This was the second time that Canada hosted the Summer Olympics, the first being in Toronto in 1976 for the Pan American Games, but more notably, Montreal was the first city in Canada to host the Summer Olympics. The Games were marked by several notable events, including the men's basketball final, which was controversial, and the women's diving events. The Montreal Olympics also saw the introduction of women's roller skating as a demonstration sport. The organizing committee for the Games was led by Dr. Marcel Aubut, and the overall cost of the Games was estimated to be around $1.3 billion, which at the time was the most expensive Olympics ever held. The Games were also notable for being the first to be broadcast in Stereo sound."
