        "content": "Alright, let's dive into this project. I need to build a Golang application that listens to Twitter's streaming API for a specific keyword and then stores relevant tweet data into a PostgreSQL database. Sounds like a cool project to work on!\n\nFirst things first, I need to familiarize myself with Twitter's streaming API. I've used Twitter's API before, but mostly for searching and retrieving tweets, not for streaming. So, I should check out the documentation to understand how streaming works.\n\nFrom what I recall, Twitter's streaming API allows you to get real-time data based on certain filters, like keywords. That's perfect for this task. I need to set up a stream that listens for any tweet containing a specific keyword.\n\nNext, I need to handle authentication with Twitter's API. Twitter uses OAuth for authentication, and I think they require you to create a developer account and apply for access to their API. I should make sure that I have all the necessary credentials: consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret.\n\nOnce I have the streaming set up and authenticated, I need to process each tweet that comes through the stream. For each tweet containing the keyword, I should extract the text and some metadata like the timestamp and the user who posted it.\n\nNow, storing this data in a PostgreSQL database. I need to set up a database schema that can hold this information. Probably, a table with columns for tweet ID, text, timestamp, and user information. I should ensure that the schema is designed efficiently to handle a potentially large volume of data, especially if the keyword is popular.\n\nIn Golang, I'll need to use packages to handle HTTP streaming and database interactions. For HTTP, I can use the standard library's net/http package, and for PostgreSQL, I can use the popular package like \"database/sql\" with the \"lib/pq\" driver.\n\nI should also think about error handling and resilience. The stream might disconnect occasionally, or there might be issues with database connections. I need to implement retries and logging to make sure the application can handle these situations gracefully.\n\nAdditionally, since this is a streaming application, it needs to run continuously. I should consider how to deploy it and keep it running, maybe using a service like systemd on Linux or Docker containers.\n\nLet me outline the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Set up a Twitter developer account and get API credentials.\n\n2. Study Twitter's streaming API documentation to understand how to set up a stream for keyword tracking.\n\n3. Write Golang code to authenticate with Twitter's API using OAuth.\n\n4. Establish a streaming connection to Twitter's API and filter for the specific keyword.\n\n5. Design the PostgreSQL database schema to store tweet text, timestamp, and user information.\n\n6. Write Golang code to connect to the PostgreSQL database and insert tweet data.\n\n7. Implement error handling and retries for both the stream and database operations.\n\n8. Set up logging to monitor the application's performance and troubleshoot issues.\n\n9. Consider deployment options to keep the application running continuously.\n\nLet me start by setting up the Twitter developer account and applying for API access. Once I have the credentials, I can proceed to write the code.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Golang application that consumes Twitter's streaming API to track a specific keyword and stores the tweet's text and metadata in a PostgreSQL database, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **Twitter Developer Account and API Credentials:**\n   - Sign up for a Twitter developer account and create an app to obtain API keys and access tokens.\n\n2. **PostgreSQL Database:**\n   - Set up a PostgreSQL database and create a table to store tweet data.\n\n3. **Go Modules:**\n   - Ensure you have the necessary Go modules installed:\n     ```sh\n     go get github.com/dghubble/go-twitter/twitter\n     go get github.com/dghubble/oauth1\n     go get github.com/lib/pq\n     ```\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"database/sql\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"time\"\n\n\t\"github.com/dghubble/go-twitter/twitter\"\n\t\"github.com/dghubble/oauth1\"\n\t_ \"github.com/lib/pq\"\n)\n\nconst (\n\tdbHost     = \"localhost\"\n\tdbUser     = \"your_db_user\"\n\tdbPassword = \"your_db_password\"\n\tdbName     = \"your_db_name\"\n\tdbSSLMode  = \"disable\" // Adjust based on your setup\n\n\tconsumerKey    = \"your_consumer_key\"\n\tconsumerSecret = \"your_consumer_secret\"\n\taccessToken    = \"your_access_token\"\n\taccessSecret   = \"your_access_secret\"\n\n\tkeyword = \"golang\" // Keyword to track\n)\n\nvar db *sql.DB\n\nfunc main() {\n\tvar err error\n\tdb, err = sql.Open(\"postgres\", fmt.Sprintf(\"host=%s user=%s password=%s dbname=%s sslmode=%s\",\n\t\tdbHost, dbUser, dbPassword, dbName, dbSSLMode))\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Cannot connect to db: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\tdefer db.Close()\n\n\tconfig := oauth1.NewConfig(consumerKey, consumerSecret)\n\ttoken := oauth1.NewToken(accessToken, accessSecret)\n\thttpClient := config.Client(oauth1.NoContext, token)\n\n\tclient := twitter.NewClient(httpClient)\n\n\tstream, err := client.Streams.Filter(&twitter.StreamFilterParams{\n\t\tTrack: []string{keyword},\n\t})\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Error creating stream: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\tdefer stream.Stop()\n\n\tfor msg := range stream.Messages {\n\t\tswitch v := msg.(type) {\n\t\tcase *twitter.Tweet:\n\t\t\tsaveTweet(v)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc saveTweet(tweet *twitter.Tweet) {\n\tquery := `INSERT INTO tweets (tweet_id, text, created_at, user_name, user_screen_name) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5)`\n\t_, err := db.Exec(query,\n\t\ttweet.ID,\n\t\ttweet.Text,\n\t\ttweet.CreatedAt,\n\t\ttweet.User.Name,\n\t\ttweet.User.ScreenName,\n\t)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Printf(\"Error saving tweet: %v\", err)\n\t} else {\n\t\tlog.Printf(\"Saved tweet: %s\", tweet.Text)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Database Setup:**\n   - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.\n   - Create a database and a table named `tweets` with columns: `tweet_id`, `text`, `created_at`, `user_name`, and `user_screen_name`.\n\n2. **Twitter Authentication:**\n   - Use OAuth1 for authentication with Twitter's API.\n\n3. **Streaming API:**\n   - Use the `twitter` package to connect to Twitter's streaming API and track the specified keyword.\n\n4. **Storing Data:**\n   - For each tweet containing the keyword, extract relevant fields and insert them into the PostgreSQL database.\n\n5. **Error Handling:**\n   - Basic error handling is implemented for database operations and stream creation.\n\nThis application will continuously listen for tweets containing the specified keyword and store them in the database. Make sure to handle API rate limits and connection retries in a production environment."
