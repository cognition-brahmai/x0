        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a man who gives away half of his money to his wife, then half of what's left to his son, and finally half of the remaining amount to his daughter. After all these giveaways, he's left with $25. We need to find out how much money he had initially.\n\nOkay, let's denote the initial amount of money he had as X.\n\nFirst, he gives half of his money to his wife. So, he gives away (1/2)*X to his wife, and he's left with (1/2)*X.\n\nNext, he gives half of what's left to his son. Half of what's left is half of (1/2)*X, which is (1/4)*X. So, after giving this to his son, he's left with (1/2)*X - (1/4)*X = (1/4)*X.\n\nFinally, he gives half of the remaining amount to his daughter. Half of (1/4)*X is (1/8)*X. So, after giving this to his daughter, he's left with (1/4)*X - (1/8)*X = (1/8)*X.\n\nAccording to the problem, after all these transactions, he's left with $25. So, (1/8)*X = $25.\n\nTo find X, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 8:\n\nX = $25 * 8\n\nX = $200\n\nSo, the man initially had $200.\n\nLet me just double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with $200:\n\nGives half to his wife: $200 / 2 = $100, so he's left with $100.\n\nGives half of what's left to his son: $100 / 2 = $50, so he's left with $50.\n\nGives half of the remaining amount to his daughter: $50 / 2 = $25, and he's left with $25.\n\nYes, that matches the problem statement. So, the initial amount was indeed $200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
