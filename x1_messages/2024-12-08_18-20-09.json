        "content": "So I've got this problem about a rectangular garden. It says that the length is 5 meters more than twice its width, and the perimeter is 46 meters. I need to find the dimensions, which means both the length and the width. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that for a rectangle, the perimeter is the total distance around the edge. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width. So, in this case, P is 46 meters.\n\nNow, the problem relates the length to the width. It says the length is 5 meters more than twice its width. So, if I let the width be W, then the length L would be 2W + 5 meters.\n\nSo, I can substitute these expressions into the perimeter formula:\n\n46 = 2(2W + 5) + 2W\n\nAlright, let's simplify that equation step by step.\n\nFirst, distribute the 2 into the parentheses:\n\n46 = 4W + 10 + 2W\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n46 = 6W + 10\n\nNext, subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the terms with W:\n\n36 = 6W\n\nThen, divide both sides by 6 to solve for W:\n\nW = 6 meters\n\nOkay, so the width is 6 meters. Now, to find the length, I can plug this value back into the expression for L:\n\nL = 2W + 5 = 2(6) + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17 meters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden are 6 meters in width and 17 meters in length.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can use another method to confirm this answer.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to set up a system of equations. Let's see.\n\nLet W be the width and L be the length.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n1) L = 2W + 5\n\n2) 2L + 2W = 46 (the perimeter)\n\nSo, I can substitute the expression for L from equation 1 into equation 2:\n\n2(2W + 5) + 2W = 46\n\nWhich is the same equation I had earlier. So, following the same steps, I get W = 6 meters and L = 17 meters.\n\nHmm, that matches my first answer. That's a good sign.\n\nMaybe I can also check if these dimensions indeed give a perimeter of 46 meters.\n\nPerimeter = 2L + 2W = 2(17) + 2(6) = 34 + 12 = 46 meters. Perfect, it checks out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the relationship between length and width differently.\n\nThe problem says the length is 5 meters more than twice its width. So, if the width is W, then length is 2W + 5.\n\nI can also think of the perimeter as twice the sum of length and width: P = 2(L + W)\n\nSo, 46 = 2(L + W)\n\nDivide both sides by 2: 23 = L + W\n\nBut from the first equation, L = 2W + 5\n\nSo, substitute that into the perimeter equation:\n\n23 = (2W + 5) + W\n\nSimplify: 23 = 3W + 5\n\nSubtract 5: 18 = 3W\n\nDivide by 3: W = 6 meters\n\nThen, L = 2(6) + 5 = 17 meters\n\nAgain, the same answer. This reinforces that my solution is correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this problem. Maybe using ratios or something else, but it seems straightforward with the approach I've taken.\n\nI could also graph the equations to find the intersection point, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the difference between length and width. Since L = 2W + 5, the length is longer than twice the width by 5 meters.\n\nGiven that, and knowing the perimeter, I can solve for W as I did earlier.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps using the area, but the problem doesn't provide the area, so that's not helpful here.\n\nOr, maybe using the diagonal of the rectangle, but again, no information about the diagonal is given.\n\nIt seems like the perimeter is the key piece of information here, along with the relationship between length and width.\n\nSo, sticking with my initial solution: width is 6 meters, length is 17 meters.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any possibility of multiple solutions.\n\nGiven that both L and W must be positive real numbers (since they're dimensions of a garden), and the relationships are linear, there should be only one solution.\n\nSolving the equations confirms that there's only one solution: W = 6 meters, L = 17 meters.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the garden are 6 meters in width and 17 meters in length.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{width} = 6 \\text{ meters}, \\text{ length} = 17 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
