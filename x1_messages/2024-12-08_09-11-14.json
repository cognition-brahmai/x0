        "content": "So I've got this problem here about chocolates. There are 6 dark chocolates and 8 milk chocolates in a box, making a total of 14 chocolates. The question is, if I pick two chocolates at random at the same time, what's the probability that both are dark?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to pick two chocolates \"at once.\" I think it's similar to picking two chocolates without replacement, meaning I'm not putting the first one back before picking the second.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to pick 2 chocolates out of 14 is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number, and k is the number we're choosing.\n\nSo, total ways = C(14, 2).\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to pick 2 dark chocolates out of 6 is C(6, 2).\n\nThe probability that both chocolates are dark is then the number of favorable outcomes (both dark) divided by the total number of outcomes (any two chocolates).\n\nSo, probability = C(6, 2) / C(14, 2).\n\nLet me calculate C(6, 2) and C(14, 2).\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6 - 2)!) = (6 * 5 * 4!) / (2 * 1 * 4!) = (6 * 5) / 2 = 15.\n\nC(14, 2) = 14! / (2! * (14 - 2)!) = (14 * 13 * 12!) / (2 * 1 * 12!)) = (14 * 13) / 2 = 91.\n\nSo, probability = 15 / 91.\n\nWait, but I should check if this is the simplest form. Let's see, 15 and 91.\n\n15 divided by 5 is 3, 91 divided by 7 is 13. No common factors, so 15/91 is already simplified.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of sequential picking without replacement.\n\nThe probability that the first chocolate is dark is 6/14.\n\nGiven that the first is dark, the probability that the second is also dark is 5/13.\n\nSo, the combined probability is (6/14) * (5/13) = (3/7) * (5/13) = 15/91.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I end up with 15/91.\n\nIs there another way to look at this to confirm?\n\nMaybe using permutations.\n\nIf I consider the order matters, then total ways to pick two chocolates in order is P(14, 2) = 14 * 13 = 182.\n\nNumber of ways to pick two dark chocolates in order is P(6, 2) = 6 * 5 = 30.\n\nSo, probability = 30 / 182 = 15/91.\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of probability directly.\n\nThe probability that the first chocolate is dark is 6/14.\n\nGiven that the first is dark, the probability that the second is dark is 5/13.\n\nMultiplying them gives (6/14)*(5/13) = 15/91.\n\nConsistent again.\n\nWhat if I consider that picking at once is different from picking sequentially?\n\nBut in reality, picking two at once is equivalent to picking without replacement and without regard to order.\n\nSince all these methods give me the same answer, I'm confident that 15/91 is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any condition or additional information in the problem that I haven't considered?\n\nThe problem says \"randomly pick two chocolates at once without looking,\" which aligns with my assumption of picking without replacement.\n\nAlso, since they're picked at once, order doesn't matter, which is why combinations are appropriate.\n\nI don't think there's anything else to consider.\n\nSo, the probability that both chocolates are dark is 15/91.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{91}} \\]"
