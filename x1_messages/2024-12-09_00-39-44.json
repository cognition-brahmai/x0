        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. To create a Python script that fetches weather data from a REST API, we'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Choose a Weather API**: There are several weather APIs available, such as OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack, and AccuWeather. For this example, I'll use OpenWeatherMap because it's widely used and has a free tier.\n\n2. **Sign Up for an API Key**: You'll need to sign up on the OpenWeatherMap website to get an API key. This key will be used to authenticate your requests.\n\n3. **Install Required Libraries**: We'll use the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the API. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip.\n\n4. **Write the Python Script**: The script will take a location as input, make a request to the API, and display the current temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n### Step 1: Choose a Weather API\n\nI've selected OpenWeatherMap for this example. It provides comprehensive weather data and has a straightforward API.\n\n### Step 2: Sign Up for an API Key\n\nVisit the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/) and sign up for a free account. Once you're logged in, you can find your API key on your account page.\n\n### Step 3: Install Required Libraries\n\nYou'll need the `requests` library to make HTTP requests. If it's not already installed, you can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install requests\n```\n\n### Step 4: Write the Python Script\n\nHere's a sample Python script that fetches and displays weather data:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(api_key, location):\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n    params = {\n        \"q\": location,\n        \"appid\": api_key,\n        \"units\": \"metric\"  # Use \"imperial\" for Fahrenheit\n    }\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    \n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        data = response.json()\n        temperature = data[\"main\"][\"temp\"]\n        humidity = data[\"main\"][\"humidity\"]\n        conditions = data[\"weather\"][0][\"description\"]\n        \n        print(f\"Weather in {location}:\")\n        print(f\"Temperature: {temperature}\u00b0C\")\n        print(f\"Humidity: {humidity}%\")\n        print(f\"Conditions: {conditions}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Error fetching weather data. Status code: {response.status_code}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\"\n    location = input(\"Enter city name: \")\n    get_weather(api_key, location)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Import the requests library**: This library allows us to send HTTP requests easily.\n2. **Define the `get_weather` function**: This function takes an API key and a location as parameters.\n3. **Set up the API request**:\n   - Use the base URL for the OpenWeatherMap API.\n   - Define parameters including the location, API key, and units (metric for Celsius).\n4. **Make the API request**: Use `requests.get` to fetch the data.\n5. **Process the response**:\n   - If the status code is 200 (OK), extract and print the temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.\n   - If there's an error, print the status code.\n6. **Main block**:\n   - Set your API key.\n   - Prompt the user to enter a city name.\n   - Call the `get_weather` function with the provided location.\n\n### Notes\n\n- Replace `\"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\"` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.\n- The `units` parameter is set to `\"metric\"` for Celsius. If you prefer Fahrenheit, set it to `\"imperial\"`.\n- This script fetches current weather data. OpenWeatherMap also provides forecasts and other data types.\n\nThis should give you a good starting point for fetching and displaying weather data using a REST API in Python.
