        "content": "Earth rotates around its axis once every 24 hours, which we experience as one day. In a year, which is approximately 365.25 days (accounting for leap years), Earth rotates around its axis about 365.25 times. However, because Earth also orbits around the Sun, the actual number of rotations is slightly more than 365.25. This is because as Earth moves around the Sun, it has to rotate a little extra to bring the Sun back to the same position in the sky each day. This extra rotation is about 1 extra rotation per year. So, the total number of rotations Earth makes around its axis in a year is approximately 366.25 times."
