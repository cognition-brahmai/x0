        "content": "So I have this problem here: \"If it takes 6 men to dig a hole in 4 hours, how long would it take for 12 men to dig the same hole?\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a task: digging a hole. We know that 6 men can do it in 4 hours. Now, we're supposed to find out how long it would take if we double the number of men to 12.\n\nI think this is a problem about work and how work relates to the number of workers and the time they take. There's probably a relationship between the number of men and the time required to complete the task.\n\nLet me recall, in work problems, often the concept of \"man-hours\" is used. A man-hour is the amount of work one person can do in an hour. So, if 6 men work for 4 hours, the total man-hours spent on digging the hole would be 6 men * 4 hours = 24 man-hours.\n\nSo, the total work required to dig the hole is 24 man-hours.\n\nNow, if we have 12 men, and we want to find out how long it would take them to dig the same hole, we can set up an equation.\n\nLet's let t be the time in hours it takes for 12 men to dig the hole.\n\nThen, the total work done by 12 men in t hours would be 12 men * t hours = 12t man-hours.\n\nSince the total work required is 24 man-hours, we can set up the equation:\n\n12t = 24\n\nNow, solving for t:\n\nt = 24 / 12\n\nt = 2 hours\n\nSo, it would take 12 men 2 hours to dig the same hole.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. But let's double-check if this makes sense.\n\nIf 6 men take 4 hours, and we double the number of men to 12, which is twice as many, then logically, it should take half the time, assuming all men work at the same rate. Half of 4 hours is 2 hours, which matches our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of work rates. The work rate of one man would be the fraction of the job he can do per hour.\n\nIf 6 men take 4 hours to complete the job, then the combined work rate of 6 men is 1 job per 4 hours, or 1/4 job per hour.\n\nTherefore, the work rate of one man would be (1/4) / 6 = 1/24 job per hour.\n\nNow, if we have 12 men, their combined work rate would be 12 * (1/24) = 12/24 = 1/2 job per hour.\n\nSo, if they can complete half the job in one hour, they would complete the whole job in 2 hours. Again, that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using proportions.\n\nIf 6 men take 4 hours, then the product of men and hours is 6 * 4 = 24.\n\nNow, if we have 12 men, and we let h be the hours they take, then 12 * h should equal the same work, which is 24.\n\nSo, 12h = 24\n\nh = 24 / 12\n\nh = 2 hours\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? For example, do the men get in each other's way if there are too many? Or maybe there are limitations on the space where they can work simultaneously.\n\nBut in standard work problems like this, we assume that all workers can work independently without interfering with each other, and that doubling the number of workers halves the time required, assuming all other things are equal.\n\nSo, in this idealized scenario, the answer should be 2 hours.\n\nWait, but the question says \"to dig the same hole.\" Is there any trick here, like perhaps the hole doesn't get bigger with more men? But no, the hole is the same size, so the total work required is the same.\n\nTherefore, with more men, it should take less time to complete the same amount of work.\n\nAlternatively, if it were a different size hole, that would change things, but in this case, it's the same hole.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to conclude that it would take 12 men 2 hours to dig the same hole.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
