        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Let's assume we have a simple database for a library, with a table named `Books` that has the following columns:\n\n- `BookID` (integer, primary key)\n- `Title` (text)\n- `Author` (text)\n- `YearPublished` (integer)\n- `IsAvailable` (boolean)\n\nI'll provide examples for each of the tasks you mentioned using this `Books` table.\n\n### 1. Insert new records into a table\n\nTo insert a new book into the `Books` table, you can use the `INSERT INTO` statement. Here's an example:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO Books (Title, Author, YearPublished, IsAvailable)\nVALUES ('The Great Gatsby', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', 1925, TRUE);\n```\n\nThis query inserts a new book titled \"The Great Gatsby\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald, published in 1925, and sets its availability to true.\n\n### 2. Update certain records based on some condition\n\nSuppose you want to update the availability of a book based on its title. For example, if you want to mark \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" as not available, you can use the `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE Books\nSET IsAvailable = FALSE\nWHERE Title = 'To Kill a Mockingbird';\n```\n\nThis query sets the `IsAvailable` field to false for the book titled \"To Kill a Mockingbird\".\n\n### 3. Delete records matching a particular criterion\n\nIf you need to remove books from the table that are published before a certain year, say 1900, you can use the `DELETE FROM` statement with a `WHERE` clause:\n\n```sql\nDELETE FROM Books\nWHERE YearPublished < 1900;\n```\n\nThis query deletes all books published before the year 1900 from the `Books` table.\n\n### 4. Retrieve data from the tables satisfying specific conditions\n\nTo retrieve a list of all available books by a specific author, say \"J.K. Rowling\", you can use the `SELECT` statement with appropriate conditions:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM Books\nWHERE Author = 'J.K. Rowling' AND IsAvailable = TRUE;\n```\n\nThis query selects all columns from the `Books` table where the author is \"J.K. Rowling\" and the book is available.\n\nThese examples should give you a good starting point for performing basic CRUD operations in SQL.
