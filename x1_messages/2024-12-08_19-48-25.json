        "content": "I've got this task to find three phrases or words that came from pop culture\u2014like movies, music, or TV shows\u2014and are now part of everyday language. I need to explain where they came from and how their meanings have changed over time. Okay, let's dive into this.\n\nFirst up, I think \"Google\" is a great example. Now, Google started as a search engine, but it's become so ubiquitous that it's turned into a verb. People say, \"Just google it\" when they want to find information online. The term originated from the company Google, which was founded in 1998. The name itself is a play on the word \"googol,\" which is a 1 followed by a hundred zeros, symbolizing the vast amount of information they aim to organize. Over time, \"google\" has evolved from being just the name of a company to a general term for searching the internet, regardless of the search engine used.\n\nNext, I think \"bling\" is another interesting one. \"Bling\" refers to flashy, expensive jewelry, often covered in diamonds or other precious stones. The term gained popularity in the 1990s through hip-hop culture and music. Rappers like Jay-Z and Lil' Kim used the term in their songs, and it quickly spread beyond the music industry to become a common term in everyday language. Initially, it was more associated with the glittering appearance of jewelry, but over time, it's come to represent a lifestyle or attitude associated with wealth and luxury.\n\nLastly, I'll go with \"YOLO,\" which stands for \"You Only Live Once.\" This phrase has become a mantra for seizing the moment and not dwelling on past mistakes or future uncertainties. It originated from a song called \"The Motto\" by American rapper Drake in 2011. The chorus includes the line, \"We stay out late, cause we YOLO.\" Since then, YOLO has been widely used on social media and in everyday conversations to justify impulsive decisions or to encourage others to take risks. Its meaning has evolved to encompass a broader sense of carpe diem, or living in the moment, influenced by various cultural and social trends.\n\nSo, these are three examples of how pop culture has shaped our language. Each of these terms started in a specific context\u2014 a search engine, hip-hop music, and a rap song\u2014 and has since become integrated into mainstream language, evolving in meaning as they spread.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n1. **Google:**\n   - **Origin:** Named after the number \"googol\" (1 followed by 100 zeros), coined by Milton Sirotta, nephew of American mathematician Edward Kasner, and popularized in the company founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998.\n   - **Evolution:** From being the name of a specific search engine, it has become a generic verb meaning to search for information on the internet, regardless of the search engine used.\n\n2. **Bling:**\n   - **Origin:** Emerged in African American vernacular English, particularly in hip-hop culture in the 1990s, used to describe flashy, expensive jewelry.\n   - **Evolution:** Initially referred specifically to the sparkle and shine of jewelry, but has expanded to symbolize a lifestyle associated with wealth, luxury, and ostentation.\n\n3. **YOLO (You Only Live Once):**\n   - **Origin:** Coined in the song \"The Motto\" by Drake in 2011, promoting a carefree and adventurous approach to life.\n   - **Evolution:** Became a widespread meme and cultural phenomenon, used to justify impulsive actions and to encourage others to embrace the present moment without regret."
