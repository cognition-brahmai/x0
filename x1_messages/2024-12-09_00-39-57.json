I need to find the total cost.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the cost for each type of item separately and then add them up.\n\nStarting with item X:\n\nItem X costs $5 each, and the customer buys 4 of them.\n\nSo, the total cost for X is 4 * $5 = $20.\n\nNext, item Y:\n\nItem Y costs $10 each, and the customer buys 3 of them.\n\nSo, the total cost for Y is 3 * $10 = $30.\n\nThen, item Z:\n\nItem Z costs $15 each, and the customer buys 2 of them.\n\nSo, the total cost for Z is 2 * $15 = $30.\n\nNow, I need to add up the costs for X, Y, and Z to get the total purchase cost.\n\nTotal cost = cost of X + cost of Y + cost of Z = $20 + $30 + $30.\n\nLet's add those up: $20 + $30 = $50, and then $50 + $30 = $80.\n\nSo, the total cost of the purchase is $80.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. Is there any other way to look at this? Maybe I can double-check my calculations.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nFor X: 4 items * $5 = $20. That seems correct.\n\nFor Y: 3 items * $10 = $30. That also seems correct.\n\nFor Z: 2 items * $15 = $30. That's correct as well.\n\nAdding them up: $20 + $30 = $50, and $50 + $30 = $80. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of total items and average cost or something, but that might be unnecessary for this straightforward calculation.\n\nI don't think there are any hidden costs or discounts mentioned, so the total should just be the sum of the individual costs.\n\nTherefore, the total cost is $80.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
