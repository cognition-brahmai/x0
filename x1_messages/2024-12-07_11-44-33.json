        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is (3^2 * 4) - (6 + 8) / 2.\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\nInside the first set of parentheses, I have 3^2 * 4.\n\nWait, but 3^2 is an exponent, so maybe I should handle that first.\n\nActually, according to PEMDAS, exponents come before multiplication and division.\n\nSo, 3^2 is 9.\n\nThen, 9 * 4 is 36.\n\nSo, the first part simplifies to 36.\n\nNow, the second set of parentheses: 6 + 8, which is 14.\n\nThen, 14 divided by 2 is 7.\n\nSo, now the expression is 36 - 7.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 29.\n\nWait, let me double-check.\n\nOriginal expression: (3^2 * 4) - (6 + 8) / 2\n\nFirst, exponents: 3^2 = 9\n\nSo, 9 * 4 = 36\n\nNext, parentheses: 6 + 8 = 14\n\nThen, division: 14 / 2 = 7\n\nFinally, subtraction: 36 - 7 = 29\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{29} \\]"
