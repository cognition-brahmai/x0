        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that sells apples in bags, and each bag contains 8 apples. They just received a big shipment of 2,400 apples. We need to figure out how many full bags they can make from these apples and how many apples will be left over.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a full bag means. Since each bag holds 8 apples, a full bag is one that contains exactly 8 apples. Any apples that don't make up a complete set of 8 will be left over.\n\nSo, to find out how many full bags we can make, I should divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag. That is, 2,400 apples divided by 8 apples per bag.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 2,400 divided by 8.\n\nWell, 8 times 300 is 2,400. So, 2,400 divided by 8 equals 300. That means we can make 300 full bags of apples.\n\nNow, what about the leftover apples? Since 8 apples make a full bag, and 2,400 is exactly divisible by 8, there shouldn't be any apples left over.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If 8 times 300 is 2,400, then yes, all apples are used up in making full bags, and there are no leftovers.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I can use the modulo operation to find the remainder when 2,400 is divided by 8. If there's no remainder, then there are no leftover apples.\n\nSo, 2,400 modulo 8 equals... well, since 8 divides 2,400 perfectly, the remainder is 0.\n\nTherefore, there are 300 full bags and 0 apples left over.\n\nWait, but let's think about this another way. Maybe there's a different approach to confirm this result.\n\nSuppose we have 2,400 apples and we're putting them into bags of 8. Each bag takes 8 apples, so to find out how many bags we can fill, we divide the total number of apples by the number per bag.\n\nAlternatively, we could subtract 8 apples at a time until we can't subtract anymore without going into negative numbers. But that would be time-consuming for such a large number.\n\nAlternatively, we could think about how many groups of 8 are there in 2,400.\n\nAgain, that brings us back to division: 2,400 divided by 8.\n\nAnd as I calculated earlier, that's 300.\n\nSo, it seems consistent that there are 300 full bags and no leftovers.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this. For example, are there any apples that are damaged or cannot be placed in bags? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so we can assume all 2,400 apples are good and can be bagged.\n\nAlso, is there any restriction on the bag size? The problem says each bag contains 8 apples, so we don't have to worry about partial bags or anything like that.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 300 full bags and 0 apples left over.\n\nWait, but just to be extra sure, let's try another calculation method.\n\nWe can multiply the number of bags by the number of apples per bag and see if it matches the total.\n\nSo, 300 bags times 8 apples per bag equals 2,400 apples.\n\nYes, that matches the total number of apples received.\n\nTherefore, there are no apples left over.\n\nAlternatively, if we had a different total, say 2,401 apples, then 300 bags would account for 2,400 apples, leaving 1 apple left over.\n\nBut in this case, with 2,400 apples, it's perfectly divisible by 8.\n\nSo, the final answer is 300 full bags and 0 apples left over.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300 \\text{ full bags and } 0 \\text{ apples left over}} \\]"
