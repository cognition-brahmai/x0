        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. The length is 12 meters and the width is 6 meters, and I need to find the perimeter. Okay, first things first, I need to remember what a perimeter is. Perimeter is the total distance around the edge of a shape. So, for a rectangle, that would be the sum of all its sides.\n\nNow, a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides: the lengths and the widths. So, there are two sides that are 12 meters each and two sides that are 6 meters each. To find the perimeter, I can add up all these sides together.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nPerimeter = length + length + width + width\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nPerimeter = 12m + 12m + 6m + 6m\n\nNow, adding those up:\n\n12 + 12 is 24, and 6 + 6 is 12. So, 24 + 12 equals 36 meters.\n\nWait a minute, is there a formula for the perimeter of a rectangle that could make this quicker? I think there is. I recall that the perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (length + width)\n\nLet me check if that gives me the same answer.\n\nSo, using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (12m + 6m) = 2 \u00d7 18m = 36 meters\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier by adding all the sides individually. Good, that makes sense.\n\nIs there another way to think about this just to double-check? Maybe using the area or something, but no, perimeter is just the boundary, so area wouldn't help here.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to walk around the garden, the total distance I'd walk would be the perimeter. So, walking the length, then the width, then the length again, and then the width again, that would be 12 + 6 + 12 + 6, which is indeed 36 meters.\n\nAlternatively, since opposite sides are equal, I could also think of it as twice the length plus twice the width, which is the same as the formula I used.\n\nSo, in both methods, I'm getting 36 meters as the perimeter of the garden.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's make sure the units are correct. The length and width are given in meters, so the perimeter should also be in meters. Yes, that checks out.\n\nAlso, ensuring that I didn't miss anything in the problem. It's a rectangular garden, so all angles are right angles, and opposite sides are equal. No tricky bits here.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the garden is 36 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36 \\text{ meters}} \\]\n"
