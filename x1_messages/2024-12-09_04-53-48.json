        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about a train traveling between Town A and Town B. It goes to Town B at 60 mph and takes 3 hours, then stops for 30 minutes, and comes back at 90 mph. I need to find the average speed for the whole round trip.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, I need to find the total distance and the total time for the round trip.\n\nLet me start by finding the distance between Town A and Town B. The train goes to Town B at 60 mph and takes 3 hours. So, distance equals speed multiplied by time, so distance is 60 mph times 3 hours, which is 180 miles.\n\nNow, the train stops at Town B for 30 minutes. I need to remember to include this stop time in the total time for the round trip.\n\nThen, it returns to Town A at 90 mph. I need to find out how long this return trip takes. Since the distance is the same, 180 miles, and the speed is 90 mph, time equals distance divided by speed, so time is 180 miles divided by 90 mph, which is 2 hours.\n\nNow, let's add up the total distance and the total time.\n\nTotal distance is going to Town B and back, so 180 miles each way, totaling 360 miles.\n\nTotal time is the time to go to Town B (3 hours), plus the stop time (0.5 hours), plus the time to return (2 hours). So, 3 + 0.5 + 2 equals 5.5 hours.\n\nNow, average speed is total distance divided by total time, so 360 miles divided by 5.5 hours.\n\nLet me calculate that. 360 divided by 5.5.\n\nFirst, 5.5 times 65 is 357.5, which is slightly less than 360. The difference is 360 minus 357.5, which is 2.5.\n\nSo, 5.5 times 0.45 is 2.475, which is almost 2.5. So, the total would be approximately 65.4545... mph.\n\nWait, maybe I should do it more precisely.\n\n360 divided by 5.5 is the same as 3600 divided by 55, because I can multiply numerator and denominator by 10.\n\n3600 divided by 55.\n\n55 times 65 is 3575.\n\n3600 minus 3575 is 25.\n\nSo, 55 goes into 250 approximately 4.545 times.\n\nSo, the average speed is approximately 65.45 mph.\n\nBut maybe I can express it exactly.\n\n360 divided by 5.5 is 360 divided by 11/2, which is 360 multiplied by 2/11, which is 720/11, which is approximately 65.4545 mph.\n\nSo, the average speed is about 65.45 mph.\n\nWait a minute, but I think in some cases, especially with round trips with different speeds, there might be a simpler formula to find the average speed.\n\nI recall that for round trips, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the two speeds, but only if the distances are the same.\n\nThe formula for the harmonic mean of two speeds is 2*(speed1*speed2)/(speed1 + speed2).\n\nBut, in this case, there is also a stop time, so I think I have to include that in the total time.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the stop time separately.\n\nLet me try both ways to see if I get the same answer.\n\nFirst way: total distance over total time, which I already did: 360 miles / 5.5 hours = approximately 65.45 mph.\n\nSecond way: using the harmonic mean formula for the two speeds, but considering the stop time.\n\nSo, the harmonic mean formula for two speeds is 2*(v1*v2)/(v1 + v2), where v1 and v2 are the two speeds.\n\nIn this case, v1 is 60 mph and v2 is 90 mph.\n\nSo, 2*(60*90)/(60 + 90) = 2*5400/150 = 10800/150 = 72 mph.\n\nBut wait, that's different from what I got earlier (65.45 mph). So, why the difference?\n\nAh, because the harmonic mean formula doesn't account for the stop time. In the first method, I included the stop time in the total time, which decreased the average speed.\n\nSo, the correct way is to include all the time, including the stop time, which gives a lower average speed.\n\nTherefore, the first method is correct, and the average speed is approximately 65.45 mph.\n\nBut maybe I should express it as a fraction.\n\n720/11 mph is the exact value.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert it to a decimal: approximately 65.4545 mph.\n\nAlternatively, I can express it in miles per hour with minutes, but that might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if there's another way to look at it.\n\nLet me think about the total time again.\n\nTime going to Town B: 3 hours.\n\nStop time: 0.5 hours.\n\nTime returning: 2 hours.\n\nTotal time: 5.5 hours.\n\nTotal distance: 360 miles.\n\nAverage speed: 360 / 5.5 = 720/11 \u2248 65.4545 mph.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express it in terms of hours and minutes.\n\nBut I think the fractional form is acceptable.\n\nSo, the average speed for the entire round trip is approximately 65.45 mph, or exactly 720/11 mph.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{720}{11} \\text{ mph}} \\]"
