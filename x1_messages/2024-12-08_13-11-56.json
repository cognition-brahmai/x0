        "content": "So the factory makes 200 cars each week, and it works all 52 weeks in a year. I need to find out how many cars it makes in a whole year. Hmm, this seems like a multiplication problem. I think I should multiply the number of cars made per week by the number of weeks in a year.\n\nSo, that would be 200 cars/week times 52 weeks/year. Let me write that down:\n\nCars per year = 200 cars/week \u00d7 52 weeks/year\n\nNow, multiplying 200 by 52. I can break this down to make it easier. I know that 200 times 50 is 10,000, because 200 times 5 is 1,000, and 1,000 times 10 is 10,000. Then, 200 times 2 is 400. So, adding those together, 10,000 plus 400 equals 10,400.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check another way. I could think of 52 as 50 plus 2, so:\n\n200 \u00d7 50 = 10,000\n\n200 \u00d7 2 = 400\n\nThen, 10,000 + 400 = 10,400\n\nYeah, that makes sense. Alternatively, I could multiply 200 by 52 directly. Let's see:\n\n200 \u00d7 52\n\n2 times 52 is 104, and since there are two zeros in 200, it's 10,400.\n\nOkay, so the factory produces 10,400 cars in a year.\n\nBut wait, does the factory really operate 52 weeks a year? Aren't there some weeks with holidays or maintenance? The question says to assume it operates 52 weeks a year, so I guess I should go with that.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Like, does it produce the same number of cars every week? The question says it produces 200 cars every week, so I think it's constant.\n\nSo, my final answer is 10,400 cars per year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10400} \\]"
