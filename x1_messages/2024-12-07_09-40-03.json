        "content": "To determine how long it will take for the car to reach its destination, we can use the formula for time, which is derived from the relationship between distance, speed, and time. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} \\]\n\nGiven that the car is traveling at a constant speed of 65 miles per hour and needs to cover a distance of 520 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{520 \\text{ miles}}{65 \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]\n\nNow, let's perform the division:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{520}{65} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = 8 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take the car 8 hours to reach its destination when traveling at a constant speed of 65 miles per hour over a distance of 520 miles.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- It's important to ensure that the units for distance and speed are consistent. In this case, both are in miles and miles per hour, respectively, so the time is correctly calculated in hours.\n\n- If the speed were not constant, the calculation would be more complex and might require integration or other methods to account for changes in speed over time.\n\n- In real-world scenarios, factors such as stops for fuel, breaks, or traffic can affect the total travel time.\n\n- For planning purposes, it's often wise to add some buffer time to account for unforeseen delays.\n\n**Alternative Calculation Method:**\n\nAnother way to approach this problem is to think about how many 65-mile segments are there in 520 miles. Since the car covers 65 miles every hour, the number of hours required would be the number of 65-mile segments in 520 miles.\n\n\\[ \\text{number of segments} = \\frac{520}{65} = 8 \\]\n\nThus, it takes 8 hours to cover 8 segments of 65 miles each.\n\n**Verification:**\n\nTo verify the correctness of the calculation, we can multiply the time by the speed to see if we get back the original distance.\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 65 \\text{ mph} \\times 8 \\text{ hours} = 520 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nSince this matches the original distance, the calculation is confirmed to be correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe car will take 8 hours to reach its destination when traveling at a constant speed of 65 miles per hour over a distance of 520 miles."
