        "content": "So the factory originally produces 120 widgets per hour. Then there's this increase in demand, and they boost their production by 25%. I need to find out how many widgets they produce in a day now.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the new production rate per hour after the increase. A 25% increase on 120 widgets per hour.\n\nSo, 25% of 120 is calculated as (25/100) * 120 = 0.25 * 120 = 30 widgets.\n\nTherefore, the new production rate is 120 + 30 = 150 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many widgets are produced in a day. Assuming a standard day has 24 hours.\n\nSo, 150 widgets per hour * 24 hours = 3600 widgets per day.\n\nWait, but is that accurate? Maybe I should consider if the factory operates for fewer hours in a day.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify, so perhaps it's safe to assume it operates 24 hours a day.\n\nSo, 150 widgets per hour * 24 hours = 3600 widgets per day.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory has shifts or downtime, but since it's not mentioned, I'll go with 24 hours.\n\nTherefore, the factory now produces 3600 widgets in a day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3600} \\]"
