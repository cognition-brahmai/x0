        "content": "To evaluate the profitability of the product line consisting of smartphones, tablets, and laptops, we need to calculate the profit margin for each product type and then rank them based on their contribution to the overall company profits. Here's a step-by-step methodology along with sample calculations using hypothetical data.\n\n### Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection:**\n   - Gather production costs, retail prices, and sales volumes for each product category: smartphones, tablets, and laptops.\n\n2. **Calculate Profit per Unit:**\n   - For each product, subtract the production cost from the retail price to find the profit per unit.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Profit for Each Product:**\n   - Multiply the profit per unit by the sales volume for each product to get the total profit.\n\n4. **Calculate Profit Margin:**\n   - Profit margin is calculated as (profit per unit / retail price) * 100%.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Company Profits:**\n   - Sum the total profits from all product categories.\n\n6. **Determine Contribution to Overall Profits:**\n   - Calculate the percentage contribution of each product\u2019s total profit to the overall company profits.\n\n7. **Rank Products Based on Contribution:**\n   - Rank the products from highest to lowest based on their contribution to overall profits.\n\n### Sample Calculations\n\nLet's assume the following hypothetical data:\n\n#### Smartphones\n- Production cost per unit: $200\n- Retail price per unit: $500\n- Sales volume: 10,000 units\n\n#### Tablets\n- Production cost per unit: $150\n- Retail price per unit: $300\n- Sales volume: 8,000 units\n\n#### Laptops\n- Production cost per unit: $400\n- Retail price per unit: $800\n- Sales volume: 5,000 units\n\n#### Step-by-Step Calculations\n\n**1. Profit per Unit**\n\n- **Smartphones:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Profit per unit} = \\$500 - \\$200 = \\$300\n  \\]\n\n- **Tablets:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Profit per unit} = \\$300 - \\$150 = \\$150\n  \\]\n\n- **Laptops:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Profit per unit} = \\$800 - \\$400 = \\$400\n  \\]\n\n**2. Total Profit for Each Product**\n\n- **Smartphones:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total profit} = 10,000 \\times \\$300 = \\$3,000,000\n  \\]\n\n- **Tablets:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total profit} = 8,000 \\times \\$150 = \\$1,200,000\n  \\]\n\n- **Laptops:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total profit} = 5,000 \\times \\$400 = \\$2,000,000\n  \\]\n\n**3. Profit Margin**\n\n- **Smartphones:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Profit margin} = \\left( \\frac{300}{500} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 60\\%\n  \\]\n\n- **Tablets:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Profit margin} = \\left( \\frac{150}{300} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 50\\%\n  \\]\n\n- **Laptops:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Profit margin} = \\left( \\frac{400}{800} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 50\\%\n  \\]\n\n**4. Total Company Profits**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total company profits} = \\$3,000,000 + \\$1,200,000 + \\$2,000,000 = \\$6,200,000\n\\]\n\n**5. Contribution to Overall Profits**\n\n- **Smartphones:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Contribution} = \\left( \\frac{3,000,000}{6,200,000} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 48.39\\%\n  \\]\n\n- **Tablets:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Contribution} = \\left( \\frac{1,200,000}{6,200,000} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 19.35\\%\n  \\]\n\n- **Laptops:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Contribution} = \\left( \\frac{2,000,000}{6,200,000} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 32.26\\%\n  \\]\n\n**6. Ranking Based on Contribution**\n\n1. **Smartphones:** 48.39%\n2. **Laptops:** 32.26%\n3. **Tablets:** 19.35%\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the sample calculations, smartphones contribute the most to the overall company profits, followed by laptops and then tablets. This ranking can help the electronics manufacturer focus on optimizing production and sales strategies for smartphones to maximize profits, while also considering the significant contributions from laptops and the relatively lower contribution from tablets."
