        "content": "So, if a family uses 15 gallons of water every day, and we want to know how much they use in a whole year, right? Okay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that there are 365 days in a year, mostly. Wait, but actually, sometimes there are 366 days in a leap year. But to keep it simple, maybe we can assume it's not a leap year, so 365 days.\n\nSo, if they use 15 gallons each day, and there are 365 days in a year, then the total water consumption in a year would be 15 gallons multiplied by 365 days.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal water consumption = daily consumption \u00d7 number of days in a year\n\nSo, Total water consumption = 15 gallons/day \u00d7 365 days\n\nNow, let's do the math.\n\n15 multiplied by 365.\n\nWell, 15 times 300 is 4500, and 15 times 65 is 975. So, 4500 plus 975 equals 5475.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, I can break it down differently.\n\nI know that 15 times 365 is the same as 15 times (300 + 60 + 5), which is (15\u00d7300) + (15\u00d760) + (15\u00d75).\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n15 \u00d7 300 = 4500\n\n15 \u00d7 60 = 900\n\n15 \u00d7 5 = 75\n\nNow, adding those up: 4500 + 900 = 5400, and then 5400 + 75 = 5475.\n\nOkay, so total water consumption is 5475 gallons in a year.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider that some years have 366 days. If it's a leap year, then the consumption would be slightly higher.\n\nSo, for a leap year:\n\nTotal water consumption = 15 gallons/day \u00d7 366 days\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n15 times 366.\n\nAgain, breaking it down:\n\n15 \u00d7 300 = 4500\n\n15 \u00d7 60 = 900\n\n15 \u00d7 6 = 90\n\nAdding them up: 4500 + 900 = 5400, plus 90 equals 5490.\n\nSo, in a leap year, they would consume 5490 gallons.\n\nBut since leap years don't happen every year, maybe we can stick with the 365-day year for this calculation, unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, to get a more accurate average, we could consider the average length of a year, accounting for leap years.\n\nI know that leap years occur every 4 years, so the average length of a year is 365.25 days.\n\nSo, using that:\n\nTotal water consumption = 15 gallons/day \u00d7 365.25 days/year\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\n15 \u00d7 365.25 = ?\n\nWell, 15 \u00d7 365 = 5475, and 15 \u00d7 0.25 = 3.75\n\nSo, 5475 + 3.75 = 5478.75 gallons per year.\n\nSo, on average, considering leap years, the family would consume 5478.75 gallons per year.\n\nBut perhaps that level of precision isn't necessary for this problem. Maybe the question assumes a non-leap year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should consider the exact average, which is 365.2425 days per year, based on the Gregorian calendar.\n\nUsing that:\n\nTotal water consumption = 15 gallons/day \u00d7 365.2425 days/year\n\nCalculating that:\n\n15 \u00d7 365.2425 = 15 \u00d7 365.2425\n\nFirst, 15 \u00d7 365 = 5475\n\n15 \u00d7 0.2425 = 3.6375\n\nSo, 5475 + 3.6375 = 5478.6375 gallons per year.\n\nBut again, maybe that's more precise than needed.\n\nGiven that the original figure is 15 gallons per day, which is likely an estimate, using 365 days per year is probably sufficient.\n\nSo, I'll go with 15 gallons/day \u00d7 365 days/year = 5475 gallons/year.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to account for leap years, we can use 5478.75 gallons per year.\n\nBut to keep it simple, 5475 gallons per year seems adequate.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check my multiplication again to be sure.\n\n15 \u00d7 365:\n\n10 \u00d7 365 = 3650\n\n5 \u00d7 365 = 1825\n\nAdding them up: 3650 + 1825 = 5475\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the family consumes 5475 gallons of water in a year.\n\nBut, perhaps we should consider the context. Is there any other information we need to take into account?\n\nFor example, are there any seasonal variations in water consumption? Or is the consumption constant throughout the year?\n\nIf the consumption varies seasonally, then our calculation would only be an average.\n\nBut since the question states a constant daily consumption of 15 gallons, we can assume it's constant throughout the year.\n\nTherefore, 5475 gallons per year is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express it in a different unit, like gallons per month or something, but the question asks for yearly consumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the cost of water, but since that information isn't provided, it's not necessary for this calculation.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the family consumes 5475 gallons of water in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5475} \\]"
