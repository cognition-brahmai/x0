        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of 36 people consisting of men, women, and children. The problem states that there are twice as many men as women and three times as many children as women. I need to find out how many men, women, and children there are.\n\nFirst, I should probably define variables for the number of men, women, and children. Let's say:\n\n- Let W represent the number of women.\n\n- Since there are twice as many men as women, the number of men will be 2W.\n\n- There are three times as many children as women, so the number of children will be 3W.\n\nNow, the total number of people in the group is the sum of men, women, and children, which is 36. So, I can write the equation:\n\nW + 2W + 3W = 36\n\nCombining like terms, that's:\n\n6W = 36\n\nNow, to find W, I'll divide both sides by 6:\n\nW = 36 / 6\n\nW = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 women in the group.\n\nNow, since there are twice as many men as women, the number of men is:\n\n2 * 6 = 12 men\n\nAnd there are three times as many children as women, so the number of children is:\n\n3 * 6 = 18 children\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure this adds up to 36:\n\n6 (women) + 12 (men) + 18 (children) = 36\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the group consists of 12 men, 6 women, and 18 children.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12 \\text{ men},\\ 6 \\text{ women},\\ 18 \\text{ children}} \\]"
