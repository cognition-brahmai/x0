        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this problem about three children who are supposed to share $180 based on their ages. The oldest gets twice as much as the middle child, and the middle child gets twice as much as the youngest. Also, the sum of their ages is 14. The question is asking for the age of the youngest child.\n\nHmm, okay. First, I need to understand how the money is being divided. It's according to their ages, with specific ratios given. So, if the youngest gets a certain amount, the middle child gets twice that, and the oldest gets twice what the middle child gets, which means the oldest gets four times the youngest.\n\nLet me try to express that mathematically. Let's denote the amount the youngest gets as x. Then, the middle child gets 2x, and the oldest gets 4x. The total amount is $180, so:\n\nx + 2x + 4x = 180\n\nThat simplifies to 7x = 180.\n\nSo, x = 180 / 7 \u2248 25.7142857, which is approximately $25.71.\n\nBut wait, the question is about their ages, not directly about how much money they get. It says to divide the money according to their ages, so perhaps their shares are proportional to their ages.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let's denote the ages of the children as a (oldest), b (middle), and c (youngest). According to the problem:\n\na = 2b\n\nb = 2c\n\nAnd a + b + c = 14\n\nSo, substituting a and b in terms of c:\n\na = 2*(2c) = 4c\n\nb = 2c\n\nc = c\n\nSo, 4c + 2c + c = 14\n\nThat is, 7c = 14\n\nTherefore, c = 2\n\nSo, the youngest child is 2 years old.\n\nBut let me check if this makes sense with the money division.\n\nIf ages are a=8, b=4, c=2, and they share $180 according to their ages, then the ratio is 8:4:2, which simplifies to 4:2:1.\n\nSo, the total parts are 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 parts.\n\nEach part is $180 / 7 \u2248 $25.7142857\n\nThus:\n\nOldest gets 4 parts \u2248 4 * 25.71 \u2248 $102.86\n\nMiddle gets 2 parts \u2248 2 * 25.71 \u2248 $51.43\n\nYoungest gets 1 part \u2248 $25.71\n\nTotal: 102.86 + 51.43 + 25.71 = $180\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, considering the money division directly as per the initial approach, but it seems I arrived at the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the youngest child is 2 years old.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
