        "content": "So, the factory makes 1500 units of product A and 2500 units of product B each week. We need to find out how many weeks it will take to produce 30,000 units of A and 50,000 units of B. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many weeks it takes to produce each product separately and then see which one takes longer, because the factory is producing both products at the same time. Maybe.\n\nWait, but if the factory is making both products simultaneously each week, I need to consider both productions together. So, each week, it produces 1500 A's and 2500 B's. I need to reach 30,000 A's and 50,000 B's.\n\nLet me calculate the number of weeks needed for product A alone. If they make 1500 A's per week, to make 30,000 A's, it would be 30,000 divided by 1500. Let me do that math.\n\n30,000 \u00f7 1500 = 20 weeks. So, it would take 20 weeks to make 30,000 A's.\n\nNow, for product B, they make 2500 B's per week. To make 50,000 B's, it would be 50,000 divided by 2500.\n\n50,000 \u00f7 2500 = 20 weeks as well.\n\nHmm, interesting. Both products take 20 weeks to reach their respective targets. So, if the factory continues to produce both products each week, it would take 20 weeks to meet both production goals.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. In 20 weeks, they would have produced:\n\nFor A: 1500 units/week \u00d7 20 weeks = 30,000 units.\n\nFor B: 2500 units/week \u00d7 20 weeks = 50,000 units.\n\nPerfect, that matches the targets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to produce both together more efficiently, but since the weeks required are the same for both products, it seems straightforward.\n\nI think the answer is 20 weeks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
