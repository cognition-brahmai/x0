        "content": "Sure! Implementing the Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming in Java is an efficient way to avoid the exponential time complexity associated with the naive recursive approach. Dynamic programming allows us to store the results of subproblems to reuse them later, which significantly reduces the computation time.\n\n## Approach\n\n1. **Memoization**: Use an array to store previously computed Fibonacci numbers.\n2. **Bottom-Up Approach**: Start from the base cases and build up the solution for the desired value.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\npublic class FibonacciDP {\n    public static int fibonacci(int n) {\n        if (n <= 1) {\n            return n;\n        }\n        \n        int[] memo = new int[n + 1];\n        memo[0] = 0;\n        memo[1] = 1;\n        \n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n            memo[i] = memo[i - 1] + memo[i - 2];\n        }\n        \n        return memo[n];\n    }\n    \n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int n = 10; // Example: Compute the 10th Fibonacci number\n        System.out.println(\"Fibonacci number at position \" + n + \" is: \" + fibonacci(n));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Base Cases**: \n   - `fibonacci(0) = 0`\n   - `fibonacci(1) = 1`\n\n2. **Memoization Array**:\n   - An array `memo` is created to store the Fibonacci numbers from 0 to n.\n   - `memo[0]` and `memo[1]` are initialized to 0 and 1 respectively.\n\n3. **Filling the Memoization Array**:\n   - Using a for loop from 2 to n, each Fibonacci number is computed using the sum of the two preceding numbers and stored in the `memo` array.\n\n4. **Time Complexity**:\n   - The time complexity is O(n) because each Fibonacci number from 2 to n is computed exactly once.\n\n5. **Space Complexity**:\n   - The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage required for the `memo` array.\n\nThis approach ensures that we avoid redundant calculations by storing and reusing previously computed results, making it efficient for large values of n."
