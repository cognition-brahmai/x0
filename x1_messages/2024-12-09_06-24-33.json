        "content": "In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, there are 4 Aces and 4 Kings. So, the total number of favorable outcomes is 4 Aces + 4 Kings = 8 cards.\n\nThe probability of drawing an Ace or a King on your first draw is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 8 / 52.\n\nThis can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4, which gives 2 / 13.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 2/13 or approximately 0.1538 or 15.38%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{13}} \\]"
