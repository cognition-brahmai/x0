        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 5 red balls, 7 blue balls, and 8 green balls. That means the total number of balls is 5 + 7 + 8, which is 20 balls.\n\nI need to find the probability that if I pick two balls at random without replacement, both of them are red. Okay, so without replacement means that once I pick the first ball, it doesn't go back into the box, so the total number of balls decreases by one after the first pick.\n\nFirst, I need to find the probability that the first ball I pick is red. Since there are 5 red balls out of 20 total balls, the probability for the first ball being red is 5/20, which simplifies to 1/4.\n\nNow, given that the first ball was red, there are now 4 red balls left and a total of 19 balls remaining in the box. So, the probability that the second ball is also red, given that the first one was red, is 4/19.\n\nTo find the probability that both events happen\u2014that both balls are red\u2014I need to multiply the probability of the first event by the conditional probability of the second event given the first. So, that's (1/4) times (4/19).\n\nLet's calculate that: (1/4) * (4/19) = (1 * 4) / (4 * 19) = 4 / 76 = 1 / 19.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this to verify the answer? Maybe using combinations.\n\nYes, I can use combinations to find the probability. The total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 20 is \u201c20 choose 2\u201d, which is calculated as 20! / (2! * (20 - 2)!) = (20 * 19) / (2 * 1) = 190.\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 red balls out of 5 is \u201c5 choose 2\u201d, which is (5 * 4) / (2 * 1) = 10.\n\nSo, the probability that both balls are red is the number of favorable outcomes (both red) divided by the total number of outcomes (any two balls), which is 10 / 190 = 1 / 19.\n\nThat matches the earlier result. So, the probability is 1/19.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should make sure that I haven\u2019t made any mistakes. Let\u2019s see:\n\n- Total balls: 5 red + 7 blue + 8 green = 20 balls.\n\n- Probability first ball red: 5/20 = 1/4.\n\n- Given first ball red, probability second ball red: 4/19.\n\n- Multiply: (1/4) * (4/19) = 1/19.\n\n- Using combinations: (5 choose 2) / (20 choose 2) = 10 / 190 = 1/19.\n\nBoth methods give the same answer, so I\u2019m confident that\u2019s the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{19}} \\]"
