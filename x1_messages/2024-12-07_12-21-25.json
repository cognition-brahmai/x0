        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company with 100 employees. There are male and female employees, and we're told that there are twice as many male employees as female employees. Also, the average salary for male employees is $60,000 per year, and for female employees, it's $50,000 per year. We need to find out the total annual payroll for the company.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many male and female employees there are. Let's let the number of female employees be F. Since there are twice as many male employees as female employees, the number of male employees would be 2F. The total number of employees is 100, so F + 2F = 100. That means 3F = 100. So, F = 100 / 3. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 100 divided by 3 is not a whole number, but the number of employees should be a whole number.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try again. If there are twice as many male employees as female employees, then for every female employee, there are two male employees. So, the ratio of male to female employees is 2:1. That means, for every three employees, two are male and one is female.\n\nSo, if we have 100 employees in total, the number of female employees would be one-third of 100, and the number of male employees would be two-thirds of 100. But again, 100 divided by 3 is approximately 33.333, which isn't a whole number. But the number of employees has to be a whole number.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should consider that the total number of employees is 100, and the ratio is 2:1 for male to female. So, let's denote the number of female employees as F and the number of male employees as M. We know that M = 2F and M + F = 100.\n\nSo, substituting M with 2F in the second equation: 2F + F = 100 \u2192 3F = 100 \u2192 F = 100 / 3 \u2248 33.333. But that can't be right because you can't have a fraction of an employee.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or in my approach. Let me double-check. The problem says there are twice as many male employees as female employees, and there are 100 employees in total.\n\nLet me try solving it again. If M = 2F and M + F = 100, then substituting, 2F + F = 100 \u2192 3F = 100 \u2192 F = 100 / 3. But 100 isn't divisible by 3, so perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem means that for every male employee, there are two female employees, but that would make M: F = 1:2, which is different from what's stated. The problem clearly says \"twice as many male employees as female employees,\" which translates to M = 2F.\n\nI think I need to proceed with M = 2F and M + F = 100, even though it leads to a fraction. Maybe the problem expects us to round or consider a decimal salary.\n\nSo, F = 100 / 3 \u2248 33.333 employees, and M = 2 * 33.333 \u2248 66.666 employees.\n\nNow, the average salary for male employees is $60,000, so the total salary for male employees would be 66.666 * 60,000.\n\nSimilarly, the total salary for female employees would be 33.333 * 50,000.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 66.666 * 60,000 = 4,000,000 (since 66.666 * 60k is like 66.666 * 60,000).\n\nWait, 66.666 * 60,000 = 4,000,000?\n\nLet me check: 66.666 * 60,000 = 4,000,000.\n\nSimilarly, 33.333 * 50,000 = 1,666,650.\n\nWait, 33.333 * 50,000 = 1,666,650.\n\nThen, the total payroll would be 4,000,000 + 1,666,650 = 5,666,650.\n\nBut this seems off because 100 employees with average salaries between 50 and 60k should have a total payroll around 5 million, not 5.6 million.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the number of employees.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's assume the number of female employees is F, and male employees is M = 2F. Then M + F = 100 \u2192 2F + F = 100 \u2192 3F = 100 \u2192 F = 100 / 3 \u2248 33.333.\n\nSo, female employees: 33.333, male employees: 66.666.\n\nNow, total salary for females: 33.333 * 50,000 = 1,666,650.\n\nTotal salary for males: 66.666 * 60,000 = 4,000,000.\n\nTotal payroll: 1,666,650 + 4,000,000 = 5,666,650.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to calculate this without dealing with fractions of employees.\n\nLet me consider that the ratio is 2:1, so for every group of 3 employees (2 males and 1 female), the total salary would be (2 * 60,000) + (1 * 50,000) = 120,000 + 50,000 = 170,000.\n\nNow, with 100 employees, the number of such groups would be 100 / 3 \u2248 33.333 groups.\n\nSo, total payroll would be 33.333 * 170,000 = 5,666,600.\n\nThis is consistent with the previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of weighted averages.\n\nThe average salary of all employees would be the weighted average of the male and female averages, weighted by the number of males and females.\n\nSo, average salary = (M * 60,000 + F * 50,000) / (M + F)\n\nBut since M + F = 100, and M = 2F, then F = 100 / 3 \u2248 33.333, and M = 66.666.\n\nSo, average salary = (66.666 * 60,000 + 33.333 * 50,000) / 100\n\nCalculating numerator: 66.666 * 60,000 = 4,000,000; 33.333 * 50,000 = 1,666,650; sum = 5,666,650.\n\nThen, average salary = 5,666,650 / 100 = 56,666.50.\n\nSo, total payroll would be average salary * number of employees = 56,666.50 * 100 = 5,666,650.\n\nThis matches the previous calculations.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the average salary is a weighted average:\n\naverage salary = (2/3 * 60,000) + (1/3 * 50,000) = (2/3 * 60,000) + (1/3 * 50,000) = (120,000 / 3) + (50,000 / 3) = (120,000 + 50,000) / 3 = 170,000 / 3 \u2248 56,666.67.\n\nThen, total payroll = 56,666.67 * 100 = 5,666,667.\n\nThis is consistent with the earlier calculations.\n\nTherefore, the total annual payroll for the company is approximately $5,666,667.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5666666.\\overline{6}} \\]"
