Now, regarding your question about taxis in New York: taxis are private vehicles for hire and are not scheduled like public transportation. They operate on demand, meaning you can hail one when you need it, but their availability and travel time can be affected by traffic and other factors. So, they are not always on schedule in the way that buses or trains might be. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask!"
