        "content": "Let's see. The baker uses 2 eggs to make 3 cupcakes. I need to find out how many eggs he needs to make 18 cupcakes. Hmm, this seems like a proportion problem.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many eggs are needed for one cupcake. If 2 eggs make 3 cupcakes, then for one cupcake, it would be 2/3 eggs. Wait, that sounds a bit funny because you can't really use a fraction of an egg in practice, but in theory, it works for the calculation.\n\nSo, eggs per cupcake = 2 eggs / 3 cupcakes = 2/3 eggs per cupcake.\n\nNow, to find out how many eggs are needed for 18 cupcakes, I can multiply the eggs per cupcake by the number of cupcakes:\n\nEggs needed = (2/3 eggs per cupcake) * 18 cupcakes.\n\nLet me do the math: 2/3 times 18 is (2*18)/3 = 36/3 = 12 eggs.\n\nSo, the baker needs 12 eggs to make 18 cupcakes.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using ratios.\n\nIf 2 eggs make 3 cupcakes, then the ratio of eggs to cupcakes is 2:3.\n\nI need to find out how many eggs (let's call it x) are needed for 18 cupcakes, so the ratio should stay the same: x:18.\n\nSince the ratios must be equal: 2/3 = x/18.\n\nTo solve for x, I can cross-multiply: 2*18 = 3*x => 36 = 3x => x = 36/3 = 12 eggs.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation.\n\nIs there another way to look at it? Maybe thinking in terms of multiples.\n\nIf 3 cupcakes require 2 eggs, then to find out how many sets of 3 cupcakes are in 18 cupcakes, I can divide 18 by 3, which is 6.\n\nThen, since each set of 3 cupcakes requires 2 eggs, for 6 sets, I would need 6*2 = 12 eggs.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlright, I think no matter how I approach it, the answer is 12 eggs.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor to consider, like maybe the baker needs extra eggs for different recipes or something, but the problem seems straightforward. It's just about cupcakes.\n\nSo, my final answer is 12 eggs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
