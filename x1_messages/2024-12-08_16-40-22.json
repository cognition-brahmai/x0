        "content": "Well, I'm not Albert Einstein, but I can try to explain time travel in a way that a five-year-old might understand. So, imagine time is like a river, and we're all little boats floating along it. We can't really choose to go upstream or downstream; we just go with the flow. That's kind of like how time works for us\u2014it just keeps moving forward.\n\nNow, time travel is like wishing you could row your boat backward upstream to see something that already happened or row really fast to get to tomorrow before it arrives. But in real life, we don't have boats for time, and scientists aren't sure if time travel is possible yet. Some think maybe, in the future, we'll figure out a way to travel through time, but for now, it's still just a dream and a fun topic in stories and movies.\n\nSo, to sum it up, time travel would be going back in time to the past or jumping ahead to the future, but right now, we can only move forward in time, just like our boat on the river."
