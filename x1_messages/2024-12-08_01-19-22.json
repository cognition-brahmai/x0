The remaining 10% will be allocated for landscaping and other amenities. Calculate the individual budgets for each facility and estimate the number of soccer fields, basketball courts, and swimming pools that can be built based on average construction costs ($1 million per soccer field, $500,000 per basketball court, and $2 million per swimming pool). Explain your reasoning."

        "content": "So I've got this problem here about planning a new sports complex. The city has a budget of $10 million, and they want to allocate it among a soccer field, basketball courts, and a swimming pool, with some leftover for landscaping and other amenities. The percentages given are 40% for the soccer field, 30% for basketball courts, 20% for the swimming pool, and 10% for landscaping and amenities.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the individual budgets for each facility based on these percentages.\n\nStarting with the soccer field:\n\n40% of $10 million is calculated as:\n\n0.40 * 10,000,000 = $4,000,000\n\nSo, the soccer field gets $4 million.\n\nNext, the basketball courts:\n\n30% of $10 million is:\n\n0.30 * 10,000,000 = $3,000,000\n\nSo, $3 million for basketball courts.\n\nThen, the swimming pool:\n\n20% of $10 million is:\n\n0.20 * 10,000,000 = $2,000,000\n\nSo, $2 million for the swimming pool.\n\nFinally, landscaping and other amenities get the remaining 10%:\n\n0.10 * 10,000,000 = $1,000,000\n\nSo, $1 million for landscaping and amenities.\n\nNow, I need to estimate how many of each facility can be built based on the average construction costs provided.\n\nFor soccer fields:\n\nEach soccer field costs $1 million, and we have $4 million allocated.\n\nSo, number of soccer fields = $4,000,000 / $1,000,000 = 4\n\nTherefore, 4 soccer fields can be built.\n\nFor basketball courts:\n\nEach basketball court costs $500,000, and we have $3 million allocated.\n\nNumber of basketball courts = $3,000,000 / $500,000 = 6\n\nSo, 6 basketball courts can be built.\n\nFor swimming pools:\n\nEach swimming pool costs $2 million, and we have $2 million allocated.\n\nNumber of swimming pools = $2,000,000 / $2,000,000 = 1\n\nTherefore, 1 swimming pool can be built.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- 4 soccer fields\n\n- 6 basketball courts\n\n- 1 swimming pool\n\nAnd $1 million for landscaping and other amenities.\n\nThis seems straightforward based on the given percentages and costs. However, it's important to consider that these are average costs, and actual costs might vary depending on specific requirements, location, and other factors. Also, the landscaping and amenities budget might need to cover various items, so it's essential to plan accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, there might be other constraints or considerations, such as space availability, demand for each facility, and long-term maintenance costs. But based solely on the information provided, this is how the budget should be allocated and the number of facilities estimated.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ soccer fields},\\ 6 \\text{ basketball courts},\\ 1 \\text{ swimming pool}} \\]"
