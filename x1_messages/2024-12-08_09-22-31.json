        "content": "So the city wants to increase its public transportation ridership by 25% over the next three years by improving service frequency and capacity. They have 500 buses, each with a capacity of 50 passengers, and 200 train cars, each with a capacity of 100 passengers. The goal is to figure out how many additional buses and train cars they need to acquire, assuming equal increases in both modes of transportation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the current capacity is. For buses, there are 500 buses with 50 passengers each, so the total bus capacity is 500 * 50 = 25,000 passengers. For trains, there are 200 train cars with 100 passengers each, so the total train capacity is 200 * 100 = 20,000 passengers. Therefore, the total current capacity is 25,000 (buses) + 20,000 (trains) = 45,000 passengers.\n\nThe city wants to increase ridership by 25%. So, the target increase is 25% of 45,000, which is 0.25 * 45,000 = 11,250 additional passengers.\n\nTherefore, the total target capacity is 45,000 + 11,250 = 56,250 passengers.\n\nNow, the problem states that the increases should be equal in both modes of transportation. I need to interpret what \"equal increases\" means. It could mean that the percentage increase is the same for both buses and trains, or that the numerical increase in capacity is the same for both.\n\nLet me consider both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: equal percentage increase for both buses and trains.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that both buses and trains will have the same percentage increase in capacity.\n\nLet the percentage increase be x%.\n\nThen, the new bus capacity would be 25,000 * (1 + x/100), and the new train capacity would be 20,000 * (1 + x/100).\n\nThe total new capacity would be 25,000*(1 + x/100) + 20,000*(1 + x/100) = 45,000*(1 + x/100).\n\nWe want this to be equal to 56,250.\n\nSo, 45,000*(1 + x/100) = 56,250.\n\nDividing both sides by 45,000: 1 + x/100 = 56,250 / 45,000 = 1.25.\n\nTherefore, x/100 = 1.25 - 1 = 0.25.\n\nSo, x = 25%.\n\nTherefore, both buses and trains need to increase their capacity by 25%.\n\nNow, for buses:\n\nCurrent capacity: 25,000.\n\nIncrease needed: 25% of 25,000 = 0.25 * 25,000 = 6,250 passengers.\n\nSimilarly, for trains:\n\nCurrent capacity: 20,000.\n\nIncrease needed: 25% of 20,000 = 0.25 * 20,000 = 5,000 passengers.\n\nWait a minute, but the total increase is 6,250 (buses) + 5,000 (trains) = 11,250, which matches the target.\n\nBut the problem says \"equal increases in both modes of transportation.\" However, in this case, the increases are not equal in number: 6,250 for buses and 5,000 for trains.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"equal increases\" means the same number of additional passengers for each mode.\n\nIf that's the case, then let's denote the additional capacity for buses as y and for trains as y.\n\nSo, total increase would be y (buses) + y (trains) = 2y.\n\nWe know that 2y = 11,250.\n\nTherefore, y = 11,250 / 2 = 5,625 passengers.\n\nSo, both buses and trains need to increase their capacity by 5,625 passengers each.\n\nNow, for buses:\n\nCurrent capacity: 25,000.\n\nIncrease needed: 5,625.\n\nTherefore, new bus capacity: 25,000 + 5,625 = 30,625 passengers.\n\nSimilarly, for trains:\n\nCurrent capacity: 20,000.\n\nIncrease needed: 5,625.\n\nNew train capacity: 20,000 + 5,625 = 25,625 passengers.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many additional buses and train cars are needed to achieve these new capacities.\n\nFirst, for buses:\n\nEach bus has a capacity of 50 passengers.\n\nCurrent number of buses: 500.\n\nCurrent capacity: 500 * 50 = 25,000.\n\nNew capacity needed: 30,625.\n\nTherefore, additional capacity needed: 30,625 - 25,000 = 5,625 passengers.\n\nSince each additional bus provides 50 passengers, the number of additional buses needed is 5,625 / 50 = 112.5.\n\nBut we can't have half a bus, so the city needs to acquire 113 additional buses.\n\nSimilarly, for trains:\n\nEach train car has a capacity of 100 passengers.\n\nCurrent number of train cars: 200.\n\nCurrent capacity: 200 * 100 = 20,000.\n\nNew capacity needed: 25,625.\n\nAdditional capacity needed: 25,625 - 20,000 = 5,625 passengers.\n\nEach additional train car provides 100 passengers, so the number of additional train cars needed is 5,625 / 100 = 56.25.\n\nAgain, can't have a fraction of a train car, so the city needs to acquire 57 additional train cars.\n\nTherefore, the city needs to acquire 113 additional buses and 57 additional train cars.\n\nBut wait, let's check if this adds up to the required total increase.\n\nAdditional bus capacity: 113 buses * 50 passengers/bus = 5,650 passengers.\n\nAdditional train capacity: 57 train cars * 100 passengers/car = 5,700 passengers.\n\nTotal additional capacity: 5,650 + 5,700 = 11,350 passengers.\n\nBut the required increase was 11,250 passengers.\n\nSo, this is slightly over the target, but since we can't have fractions of vehicles, rounding up is necessary.\n\nAlternatively, if the city acquires 112 buses and 56 train cars:\n\nAdditional bus capacity: 112 * 50 = 5,600.\n\nAdditional train capacity: 56 * 100 = 5,600.\n\nTotal additional capacity: 5,600 + 5,600 = 11,200 passengers.\n\nThis is slightly under the target of 11,250.\n\nTherefore, to be safe, acquiring 113 buses and 57 train cars, totaling 11,350 additional passengers, is better.\n\nAlternatively, the city could consider a combination that more precisely meets the 11,250 additional passengers requirement.\n\nFor example, if they acquire 112 buses and 57 train cars:\n\nAdditional bus capacity: 112 * 50 = 5,600.\n\nAdditional train capacity: 57 * 100 = 5,700.\n\nTotal: 5,600 + 5,700 = 11,300.\n\nStill slightly over but closer to the target.\n\nOr 113 buses and 56 train cars:\n\nAdditional bus capacity: 113 * 50 = 5,650.\n\nAdditional train capacity: 56 * 100 = 5,600.\n\nTotal: 5,650 + 5,600 = 11,250.\n\nWait, that's exactly the target.\n\nSo, 113 additional buses and 56 additional train cars would give exactly 11,250 additional passengers.\n\nTherefore, that seems to be the optimal solution.\n\nSo, the city should acquire 113 additional buses and 56 additional train cars.\n\nBut earlier, when I calculated, I thought 113 buses and 57 train cars would be needed.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, for buses:\n\nAdditional capacity needed: 5,625 passengers.\n\nEach bus provides 50 passengers.\n\nNumber of buses required: 5,625 / 50 = 112.5.\n\nSince we can't have half a bus, round up to 113 buses.\n\nSimilarly, for trains:\n\nAdditional capacity needed: 5,625 passengers.\n\nEach train car provides 100 passengers.\n\nNumber of train cars required: 5,625 / 100 = 56.25.\n\nRound up to 57 train cars.\n\nBut according to the last combination, 113 buses and 56 train cars give:\n\n113 * 50 = 5,650 (buses)\n\n56 * 100 = 5,600 (trains)\n\nTotal: 5,650 + 5,600 = 11,250.\n\nPerfect, that meets the target exactly.\n\nTherefore, the city should acquire 113 additional buses and 56 additional train cars.\n\nAlternatively, if they acquire 112 buses and 57 train cars:\n\n112 * 50 = 5,600 (buses)\n\n57 * 100 = 5,700 (trains)\n\nTotal: 5,600 + 5,700 = 11,300, which is slightly over the target.\n\nSo, the first option is more precise.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 113 additional buses and 56 additional train cars.\n\nBut let me consider if there is a way to interpret \"equal increases\" differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"equal increases\" means that the number of additional vehicles is the same for both buses and trains.\n\nIn that case, the city would acquire the same number of additional buses and train cars.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of additional vehicles as z.\n\nThen, additional bus capacity: z * 50.\n\nAdditional train capacity: z * 100.\n\nTotal additional capacity: z * 50 + z * 100 = z * 150.\n\nWe need z * 150 = 11,250.\n\nTherefore, z = 11,250 / 150 = 75.\n\nSo, the city would need to acquire 75 additional buses and 75 additional train cars.\n\nBut this results in:\n\nAdditional bus capacity: 75 * 50 = 3,750.\n\nAdditional train capacity: 75 * 100 = 7,500.\n\nTotal: 3,750 + 7,500 = 11,250.\n\nThis also meets the target exactly.\n\nHowever, this interpretation of \"equal increases\" as equal numbers of additional vehicles seems less likely, because it leads to unequal increases in capacity (3,750 for buses and 7,500 for trains).\n\nIn contrast, in the previous interpretation, the increases in capacity are equal (5,600 for buses and 5,650 for trains, or close to equal).\n\nTherefore, the first interpretation, where the additional capacity is equal for both modes, seems more appropriate.\n\nHence, the city should acquire 113 additional buses and 56 additional train cars.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another angle.\n\nPerhaps \"equal increases\" means that the proportional increase in capacity is the same for both buses and trains.\n\nIn other words, the percentage increase in capacity is the same for both modes.\n\nEarlier, I considered a 25% increase for both, but that led to different numerical increases (6,250 for buses and 5,000 for trains), which aren't equal.\n\nWait, that's not correct. If both increase by the same percentage, the numerical increases would be proportional to their current capacities, not equal.\n\nGiven that the current bus capacity is higher than the train capacity, a equal percentage increase would lead to a larger numerical increase for buses than for trains.\n\nBut in the first interpretation, the numerical increases were 6,250 and 5,000, which aren't equal.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies \"equal increases in both modes of transportation,\" which seems to imply equal numerical increases.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach is correct.\n\nThus, the city needs to acquire 113 additional buses and 56 additional train cars to achieve the desired increase in ridership.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{113 \\text{ additional buses and } 56 \\text{ additional train cars}} \\]"
