        "content": "So the farmer has 100 acres of land, and he wants to plant three types of crops: corn, wheat, and soybeans. He's planning to allocate 40% of his land to corn, 30% to wheat, and the remaining area to soybeans. I need to calculate how many acres each crop will get.\n\nFirst, I'll find out how many acres are allocated to corn. Since 40% of the land is for corn, I can calculate that by taking 40% of 100 acres. To find a percentage of a number, I multiply the percentage by the total amount, and since percentages can be expressed as decimals, 40% is the same as 0.40.\n\nSo, acres for corn = 40% of 100 acres = 0.40 * 100 = 40 acres.\n\nNext, for wheat, which is 30% of the land. Similarly, 30% is 0.30 in decimal form.\n\nAcres for wheat = 30% of 100 acres = 0.30 * 100 = 30 acres.\n\nNow, for soybeans, it's the remaining area after allocating for corn and wheat. Since the total land is 100 acres, and corn and wheat take up 40 acres and 30 acres respectively, I can subtract those from the total to find the soybean acreage.\n\nAcres for soybeans = total acres - (acres for corn + acres for wheat) = 100 - (40 + 30) = 100 - 70 = 30 acres.\n\nAlternatively, I could have calculated the percentage allocated to soybeans first. Since corn is 40% and wheat is 30%, together they account for 70% of the land. Therefore, the remaining percentage for soybeans is 100% - 70% = 30%. Then, acres for soybeans = 30% of 100 acres = 0.30 * 100 = 30 acres. Which matches the previous calculation.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Corn: 40 acres\n\n- Wheat: 30 acres\n\n- Soybeans: 30 acres\n\nI double-checked my calculations to make sure everything adds up correctly. 40 + 30 + 30 equals 100 acres, which matches the total land available. Also, the percentages add up to 100%: 40% + 30% + 30% = 100%. Everything seems consistent.\n\nI think that's the correct allocation based on the farmer's plan."
