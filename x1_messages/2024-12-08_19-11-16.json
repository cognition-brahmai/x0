        "content": "Let's see. I have this election problem with three candidates: A, B, and C. Candidate A got 40% of the votes, candidate B got 35%, and C got the rest. There were 10,000 votes in total, and I need to find out how many more votes candidate A got compared to candidate B.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how many votes each candidate got. Since the total votes are 10,000, and A has 40%, I can calculate A's votes by taking 40% of 10,000. Similarly, B's votes would be 35% of 10,000. Then, to find out how many more votes A got than B, I just subtract B's votes from A's votes.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nVotes for A = 40% of 10,000\n\nVotes for B = 35% of 10,000\n\nDifference = Votes for A - Votes for B\n\nAlright, now calculating 40% of 10,000. Percentage means per hundred, so 40% is 40 per 100. So, 40/100 times 10,000.\n\nSimilarly, 35% is 35/100 times 10,000.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\nVotes for A = (40/100) * 10,000 = 0.4 * 10,000 = 4,000 votes\n\nVotes for B = (35/100) * 10,000 = 0.35 * 10,000 = 3,500 votes\n\nNow, the difference:\n\n4,000 - 3,500 = 500 votes\n\nSo, candidate A received 500 more votes than candidate B.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe without calculating each candidate's votes separately.\n\nLet's see, A has 40%, B has 35%, so the difference between A and B is 40% - 35% = 5%.\n\nSo, 5% of the total votes is the difference.\n\nTotal votes are 10,000, so 5% of 10,000 is (5/100) * 10,000 = 0.05 * 10,000 = 500 votes.\n\nThat's the same answer I got earlier. So, either way, the answer is 500 votes.\n\nI think that makes sense. Percentages are always about parts of a whole, and here the whole is the total votes cast, which is 10,000.\n\nJust to double-check, let's see what candidate C got.\n\nC received the remaining votes. Since A had 40% and B had 35%, together they had 75% (40% + 35% = 75%). So, C must have had 25% (100% - 75% = 25%).\n\nSo, C's votes would be 25% of 10,000, which is (25/100) * 10,000 = 0.25 * 10,000 = 2,500 votes.\n\nJust to make sure, let's add up all the votes:\n\nA: 4,000\n\nB: 3,500\n\nC: 2,500\n\nTotal: 4,000 + 3,500 + 2,500 = 10,000. Yes, that matches the total votes cast.\n\nSo, everything checks out. The difference between A and B is indeed 500 votes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500} \\]"
