        "content": "So, let's see here. We have one train traveling at 60 miles per hour and it takes 3 hours to reach its destination. Now, if two trains are traveling at the same speed but in opposite directions, starting at the same time, how long will it take for both of them to reach their destinations?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The question is about time taken for two trains to reach their destinations, given that they're traveling in opposite directions but at the same speed and starting at the same time.\n\nI know that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, time = distance / speed.\n\nFrom the first part, one train travels at 60 mph and takes 3 hours to reach its destination. So, the distance to the destination can be calculated as:\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time = 60 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 180 miles.\n\nSo, each train has to cover 180 miles to reach its destination.\n\nNow, since both trains are traveling at the same speed of 60 mph and each has to cover 180 miles to reach their respective destinations, the time taken for each train should be the same, right?\n\nSo, time taken for each train = distance / speed = 180 miles / 60 mph = 3 hours.\n\nBut the question is about two trains traveling in opposite directions. Does the direction affect the time taken to reach their destinations?\n\nI don't think so. Because each train is independent of the other's direction. They are just moving away from each other, but each is still covering its own 180 miles to reach its own destination.\n\nSo, regardless of the direction, each train will take 3 hours to reach its destination.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think differently.\n\nIf two trains are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So, relative speed = 60 mph + 60 mph = 120 mph.\n\nBut what is relative speed relevant here? Relative speed is used to determine how fast the distance between two objects is changing. In this case, since they're moving in opposite directions, the distance between them increases at 120 mph.\n\nHowever, the question is about the time taken for each train to reach its own destination, not about the distance between them.\n\nSo, the direction should not affect the time each train takes to reach its own destination. Each train is still covering its own 180 miles at 60 mph, so each will take 3 hours.\n\nMaybe the question is trying to trick me by introducing the opposite directions. But logically, the time should remain the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's something about them starting at the same time and traveling in opposite directions that affects the overall time, but I don't see how.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Suppose both trains start from point A, one going east and the other going west. Each has its own destination 180 miles away in their respective directions.\n\nSo, the eastbound train is going from A to B (180 miles east), and the westbound train is going from A to C (180 miles west).\n\nThe time taken for each train is distance divided by speed, which is 180 miles / 60 mph = 3 hours for each.\n\nSo, both trains will reach their destinations after 3 hours, regardless of their directions.\n\nAlternatively, if they start at the same time and travel in opposite directions, and if their destinations are such that one is 180 miles in one direction and the other is 180 miles in the opposite direction, then yes, each will take 3 hours to reach their destination.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the time when both have reached their destinations, considering they start at the same time.\n\nBut since each takes 3 hours, they will both reach their destinations after 3 hours.\n\nSo, the answer should be 3 hours.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The direction doesn't affect the time each train takes to reach its own destination. Each train's journey is independent of the other's direction.\n\nTherefore, the time taken for both trains to reach their destinations is 3 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
