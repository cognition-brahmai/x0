        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Let's create a simple command-line calculator in Python that can handle basic arithmetic expressions including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and it will respect the order of operations.\n\nFirst, we need to think about how to approach this. The calculator should take an arithmetic expression as input from the user and then evaluate it correctly. We need to consider the precedence of operations, meaning that multiplication and division should be performed before addition and subtraction.\n\nOne way to handle this is by using the `eval()` function in Python, which can evaluate expressions directly. However, using `eval()` can be dangerous because it can execute arbitrary code, which is a security risk. So, for a safer approach, we can write our own expression parser.\n\nBut for simplicity, and since this is a controlled environment, we'll use `eval()` with some safety measures.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Get user input:** We'll prompt the user to enter an arithmetic expression.\n2. **Validate the input:** Ensure that the input contains only numbers and the operators +, -, *, / to avoid executing dangerous code.\n3. **Evaluate the expression:** Use `eval()` to compute the result.\n4. **Display the result:** Print the result to the console.\n5. **Handle errors:** Catch any exceptions that might occur during evaluation, such as division by zero or invalid expressions.\n\nLet's consider how to validate the input to make it safer. We can check that the input string contains only digits, operators, and parentheses.\n\nHere's a possible implementation:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    print(\"Simple Command-Line Calculator\")\n    print(\"Supported operations: +, -, *, /\")\n    print(\"Enter 'quit' to exit.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"Enter an expression: \")\n        if user_input.lower() == 'quit':\n            break\n        if validate_input(user_input):\n            try:\n                result = eval(user_input, {\"__builtins__\": None}, {})\n                print(\"Result:\", result)\n            except ZeroDivisionError:\n                print(\"Error: Division by zero.\")\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(\"Error:\", e)\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please use only numbers and operators: +, -, *, /\")\n\ndef validate_input(input_str):\n    allowed_chars = set(\"0123456789()+-*/ \")\n    return set(input_str) <= allowed_chars\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Main Loop:**\n   - The program runs in a loop, prompting the user to enter expressions until they type 'quit'.\n   \n2. **Validation:**\n   - The `validate_input` function checks if the input contains only allowed characters (digits, parentheses, operators, and space).\n   \n3. **Evaluation:**\n   - The `eval` function is used with restricted global and local environments to prevent executing arbitrary code.\n   - We pass `{\"__builtins__\": None}` to disable built-in functions and classes.\n   \n4. **Error Handling:**\n   - Specific exceptions like `ZeroDivisionError` are caught and handled gracefully.\n   - A general exception catch-all is present to handle other potential errors.\n\nThis should give us a simple and safe command-line calculator. However, keep in mind that while this validation reduces risks, it's not foolproof. For a more robust solution, consider using a parsing library designed for expression evaluation.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple command-line calculator in Python that can handle basic arithmetic expressions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) while respecting the order of operations, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Input Handling:** Prompt the user to enter an arithmetic expression.\n2. **Input Validation:** Ensure the input contains only numbers and the operators (+, -, *, /) to prevent executing arbitrary code.\n3. **Expression Evaluation:** Use Python's `eval()` function to compute the result, with safety measures in place.\n4. **Error Management:** Handle potential errors such as division by zero or invalid expressions.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    print(\"Simple Command-Line Calculator\")\n    print(\"Supported operations: +, -, *, /\")\n    print(\"Enter 'quit' to exit.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"Enter an expression: \")\n        if user_input.lower() == 'quit':\n            break\n        if validate_input(user_input):\n            try:\n                # Using eval with restricted global and local environments\n                result = eval(user_input, {\"__builtins__\": None}, {})\n                print(\"Result:\", result)\n            except ZeroDivisionError:\n                print(\"Error: Division by zero.\")\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(\"Error:\", e)\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please use only numbers and operators: +, -, *, /\")\n\ndef validate_input(input_str):\n    # Allowed characters: digits, parentheses, operators, and space\n    allowed_chars = set(\"0123456789()+-*/ \")\n    return set(input_str) <= allowed_chars\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Main Loop:**\n   - The program runs in a loop, continuously prompting the user to enter expressions until they decide to quit by typing 'quit'.\n\n2. **Validation:**\n   - The `validate_input` function checks if the user's input consists solely of allowed characters (digits, operators, parentheses, and space). This helps in ensuring that only safe expressions are evaluated.\n\n3. **Evaluation:**\n   - The `eval` function is used to compute the result of the arithmetic expression.\n   - To enhance security, `eval` is called with restricted global and local environments by passing `{\"__builtins__\": None}` to prevent access to built-in functions and potential security risks.\n\n4. **Error Handling:**\n   - Specific exceptions like `ZeroDivisionError` are caught and handled to provide user-friendly error messages.\n   - A general exception handler is in place to catch and display other potential errors that may occur during expression evaluation.\n\nThis approach provides a straightforward and secure way to create a command-line calculator in Python, ensuring that only valid arithmetic expressions are evaluated."
