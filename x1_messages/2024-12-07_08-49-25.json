        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! To create a Java program that reads a text file line by line and counts the number of words in each line, and then prints the total word count at the end, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import necessary libraries**: You'll need to import classes for file handling and reading lines from a file.\n\n2. **Open the file**: Use a `File` object to represent the file and a `BufferedReader` to read it line by line.\n\n3. **Read each line**: Use a loop to read each line from the file.\n\n4. **Count words in each line**: Split each line into words using spaces as delimiters and count the number of elements in the resulting array.\n\n5. **Sum the word counts**: Keep a running total of the word counts from all lines.\n\n6. **Handle exceptions**: Make sure to handle any exceptions that might occur when opening or reading the file.\n\nHere's a sample code that demonstrates these steps:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class WordCounter {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String fileName = \"sample.txt\"; // Specify your file name here\n        int totalWords = 0;\n\n        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {\n            String line;\n            int lineCount = 0;\n            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n                lineCount++;\n                int wordCount = countWordsInLine(line);\n                totalWords += wordCount;\n                System.out.println(\"Line \" + lineCount + \": \" + wordCount + \" words\");\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Total word count: \" + totalWords);\n    }\n\n    private static int countWordsInLine(String line) {\n        if (line == null || line.trim().isEmpty()) {\n            return 0;\n        }\n        String[] words = line.trim().split(\"\\\\s+\");\n        return words.length;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Import Statements**: Import necessary classes for file reading and exception handling.\n\n2. **Main Method**:\n   - Specify the file name you want to read.\n   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the total word count.\n   - Use a `BufferedReader` to read the file line by line.\n   - For each line, count the words using the `countWordsInLine` method and add to the total.\n   - Print the word count for each line.\n   - Handle any `IOException` that might occur.\n\n3. **countWordsInLine Method**:\n   - Trim the line to remove leading and trailing spaces.\n   - Split the line into words using one or more spaces as delimiters.\n   - Return the number of words.\n\nMake sure to replace `\"sample.txt\"` with the path to your actual text file. This program will read the file line by line, count the words in each line, print the word count for each line, and finally print the total word count."
