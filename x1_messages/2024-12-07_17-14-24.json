It's particularly efficient for sorting large datasets. In this case, we'll be applying it to sort a list of strings alphabetically.\n\nBefore we dive into the code, let's briefly understand how merge sort works:\n\n1. **Divide**: The list is repeatedly divided into two halves until we have sublists that contain only one element. This is because a list with a single element is considered sorted.\n\n2. **Conquer (Merge)**: The smaller sorted sublists are then merged back together in a manner that results in a new sorted list. This process continues until the entire list is sorted.\n\nNow, let's translate this into Python code. We'll write a function called `merge_sort` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list containing those strings sorted alphabetically.\n\nHere's the step-by-step implementation:\n\n1. **Base Case**: If the list has one or zero elements, it's already sorted, so we can return it as is.\n\n2. **Divide**: Find the midpoint of the list and divide it into two halves.\n\n3. **Recursively Sort**: Recursively apply the merge sort to both halves.\n\n4. **Merge**: Merge the two sorted halves back into a single sorted list.\n\nThe merging process is crucial. We'll need a helper function, say `merge`, which takes two sorted lists and combines them into one sorted list. This is done by comparing the elements from both lists and appending the smaller one to the result list.\n\nLet's write the code accordingly:\n\n```python\ndef merge_sort(strings):\n    # Base case: a list of zero or one elements is sorted\n    if len(strings) <= 1:\n        return strings\n    \n    # Divide the list into two halves\n    mid = len(strings) // 2\n    left_half = strings[:mid]\n    right_half = strings[mid:]\n    \n    # Recursively sort both halves\n    left_sorted = merge_sort(left_half)\n    right_sorted = merge_sort(right_half)\n    \n    # Merge the sorted halves\n    return merge(left_sorted, right_sorted)\n\ndef merge(left, right):\n    # Initialize pointers for both lists\n    i = j = 0\n    merged = []\n    \n    # Merge the two lists by comparing elements\n    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):\n        if left[i] < right[j]:\n            merged.append(left[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            merged.append(right[j])\n            j += 1\n    \n    # If there are remaining elements in left or right, append them\n    merged.extend(left[i:])\n    merged.extend(right[j:])\n    \n    return merged\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    sample_list = [\"banana\", \"apple\", \"cherry\", \"date\"]\n    sorted_list = merge_sort(sample_list)\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_list)\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n- The `merge_sort` function handles the division of the list and the merging of the sorted sublists.\n\n- The `merge` function takes two sorted lists and merges them into a single sorted list.\n\n- We have an example usage in the `main` block to demonstrate how to use the `merge_sort` function.\n\nThis should give you a clear understanding of how merge sort works with a list of strings.
