        "content": "So if a tree grows 2 inches every year, and we want to know how much taller it'll be after 25 years, right? Well, that seems straightforward. I think I can just multiply the growth per year by the number of years.\n\nSo, growth per year is 2 inches, and the number of years is 25. So, 2 inches/year times 25 years should give me the total growth over that period.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal growth = growth per year \u00d7 number of years\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal growth = 2 inches/year \u00d7 25 years\n\nNow, when I multiply those, the \"years\" unit should cancel out, leaving me with inches.\n\nSo, 2 \u00d7 25 = 50 inches.\n\nWait, that seems too simple. Is there anything I'm missing here? Like, does the tree grow consistently every year, or is there any factor that might affect its growth rate over time?\n\nThe problem says \"grows 2 inches taller every year,\" which implies a constant growth rate. So, no need to consider variables like environmental changes or age affecting growth.\n\nSo, yes, total growth over 25 years would be 50 inches.\n\nBut maybe I should double-check. Let's think about it differently. If the tree grows 2 inches each year, after one year it's 2 inches taller, after two years it's 4 inches taller, and so on.\n\nSo, after 25 years, it should be 2 inches \u00d7 25 = 50 inches taller.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as an arithmetic sequence where the common difference is 2 inches per year, and I'm looking for the sum up to 25 years.\n\nBut in that case, the sum S of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\nS = n/2 \u00d7 (2a + (n - 1)d)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the number of terms\n\n- a is the first term\n\n- d is the common difference\n\nIn this scenario, a = 2 inches (growth in the first year), d = 2 inches (since it grows by 2 inches each year), and n = 25 years.\n\nPlugging in:\n\nS = 25/2 \u00d7 (2\u00d72 + (25 - 1)\u00d72)\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\n\n2\u00d72 = 4\n\n(25 - 1)\u00d72 = 24\u00d72 = 48\n\nSo, 4 + 48 = 52\n\nNow, 25/2 \u00d7 52 = (12.5) \u00d7 52\n\n12.5 \u00d7 52 = 12.5 \u00d7 50 + 12.5 \u00d7 2 = 625 + 25 = 650 inches\n\nWait, that can't be right. If I use the arithmetic sequence formula, I'm getting 650 inches, but earlier I got 50 inches by simply multiplying 2 inches by 25 years.\n\nThere's clearly a mistake here. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nOh, I think I misapplied the arithmetic sequence formula. The formula I used is for the sum of the first n terms, assuming the difference is constant, which it is, but in this case, the growth is constant each year, so it's not actually an arithmetic sequence where the difference changes.\n\nWait, no, in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. In this case, the tree grows 2 inches each year, so the growth each year is the same, which is 2 inches.\n\nSo, the total growth over 25 years would be the sum of 25 terms, each being 2 inches.\n\nSo, S = n \u00d7 a = 25 \u00d7 2 = 50 inches.\n\nAlternatively, using the arithmetic sequence sum formula:\n\nS = n/2 \u00d7 (2a + (n - 1)d)\n\nBut since d = 0 (because the growth is constant, not increasing by 2 inches each year, but staying at 2 inches per year), the formula simplifies to:\n\nS = n/2 \u00d7 (2a + (n - 1)\u00d70) = n/2 \u00d7 2a = n \u00d7 a = 25 \u00d7 2 = 50 inches.\n\nAh, so my initial approach was correct. The tree will be 50 inches taller after 25 years.\n\nI think I got confused because I mistakenly set d = 2, but in reality, since the growth is constant at 2 inches per year, the common difference d is 0.\n\nSo, the correct total growth is 50 inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
