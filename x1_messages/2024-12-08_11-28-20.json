        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 cats in the room, and each cat catches 3 mice per day. So, first, I need to find out how many mice all the cats catch in one day.\n\nIf one cat catches 3 mice per day, then 5 cats would catch 5 times 3, which is 15 mice per day.\n\nNow, they do this for 4 days, so the total number of mice caught by all the cats over 4 days would be 15 mice per day times 4 days, which equals 60 mice.\n\nBut the problem also says that after catching the mice, each cat gives one mouse to its owner and keeps the rest for itself. However, the question is asking for the total number of mice caught by all the cats after 4 days, not how many they give away or keep.\n\nSo, the total number of mice caught by all the cats after 4 days is 60.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check that. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, number of cats: 5\n\nMice caught per cat per day: 3\n\nSo, per day, total mice caught: 5 cats * 3 mice/cat = 15 mice\n\nOver 4 days: 15 mice/day * 4 days = 60 mice\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the part about giving one mouse to the owner and keeping the rest is probably just additional information that doesn't affect the total number of mice caught. It might be relevant if the question was asking how many mice the owner receives or how many each cat keeps, but since it's asking for the total caught, it's not necessary for that calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 60 mice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
