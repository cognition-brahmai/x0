        "content": "So I've got this cubic equation here: f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6, and I need to find all the values of x that make f(x) equal to zero. Basically, I need to solve for x in the equation x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0.\n\nFirst off, I remember that for polynomial equations, especially cubics, there are a few methods to solve them: factoring, using the rational root theorem, synthetic division, and so on. Since the equation seems manageable, maybe I can try factoring it.\n\nLet me see if I can factor this cubic polynomial. I know that if I can find one root, I can then factor out the corresponding linear term and be left with a quadratic, which is easier to solve.\n\nThe rational root theorem might be helpful here. It states that any possible rational root of the polynomial equation is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is -6, and the leading coefficient is 1.\n\nSo, the possible rational roots are the factors of -6 divided by the factors of 1. That gives me possible roots of \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, and \u00b16.\n\nI'll test these possible roots by plugging them into the polynomial to see if any of them yield zero.\n\nLet's start with x = 1:\n\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 6*(1)^2 + 11*(1) - 6 = 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0.\n\nHey, x = 1 is a root! That means (x - 1) is a factor of the polynomial.\n\nNow, I can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out (x - 1) from the cubic polynomial.\n\nI'll use synthetic division for simplicity.\n\nSo, setting up the synthetic division with x = 1:\n\nCoefficients of the polynomial: 1 (for x^3), -6 (for x^2), 11 (for x), and -6 (constant term).\n\nBring down the leading coefficient:\n\n1\n\nNow, multiply by the root (1) and add to the next coefficient:\n\n1 * (-6) = -6\n\n-6 + 11 = 5\n\nThen, multiply by the root again:\n\n1 * 5 = 5\n\n5 + (-6) = -1\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my synthetic division.\n\nActually, synthetic division for x = 1 should look like this:\n\nCoefficients: 1, -6, 11, -6\n\nBring down the 1.\n\n1 * 1 = 1, add to -6: -6 + 1 = -5\n\n-5 * 1 = -5, add to 11: 11 + (-5) = 6\n\n6 * 1 = 6, add to -6: -6 + 6 = 0\n\nOkay, so the result of the synthetic division is 1, -5, 6, 0.\n\nThis means that the polynomial can be factored as (x - 1)(x^2 - 5x + 6).\n\nNow, I need to factor the quadratic x^2 - 5x + 6.\n\nLooking at x^2 - 5x + 6, I can look for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to -5.\n\nThose numbers are -2 and -3.\n\nSo, x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3).\n\nTherefore, the complete factorization of the original polynomial is:\n\nf(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3).\n\nNow, to find the roots, I set each factor equal to zero:\n\nx - 1 = 0 \u21d2 x = 1\n\nx - 2 = 0 \u21d2 x = 2\n\nx - 3 = 0 \u21d2 x = 3\n\nSo, the solutions are x = 1, x = 2, and x = 3.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check if these are indeed roots by plugging them back into the original equation.\n\nFirst, x = 1:\n\nf(1) = 1^3 - 6*1^2 + 11*1 - 6 = 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0. Correct.\n\nx = 2:\n\nf(2) = 2^3 - 6*2^2 + 11*2 - 6 = 8 - 24 + 22 - 6 = 0. Good.\n\nx = 3:\n\nf(3) = 3^3 - 6*3^2 + 11*3 - 6 = 27 - 54 + 33 - 6 = 0. Perfect.\n\nSo, all three values satisfy the equation f(x) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are x = 1, x = 2, and x = 3.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using the cubic formula, but that seems more complicated for this case since we were able to factor it easily.\n\nAlternatively, I could have tried to graph the function to estimate the roots and then refined them using numerical methods, but given that we have exact solutions here, factoring was the way to go.\n\nAlso, since all the roots are real and distinct, I don't need to worry about complex roots or multiple roots.\n\nIn summary, the values of x for which f(x) = 0 are x = 1, x = 2, and x = 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1, \\ 2, \\ 3} \\]"
