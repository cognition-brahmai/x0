        "content": "So, in this problem, there are 30 students in a class, and each student shakes hands with every other student exactly once. We need to find out how many handshakes take place in total.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's a problem about counting the number of unique handshakes when every student shakes hands with every other student only once. So, no student shakes hands with the same student more than once, and of course, a student doesn't shake hands with themselves.\n\nOne way to approach this is to think about how many choices each student has for shaking hands. For example, the first student can shake hands with any of the other 29 students. Then, the second student has already shaken hands with the first student, so they can shake hands with the remaining 28 students. The third student has already shaken hands with the first two, so they can shake hands with the remaining 27 students, and so on.\n\nSo, if we add up all these possibilities, it would be 29 + 28 + 27 + ... + 1. This is an arithmetic series where the first term is 29 and the last term is 1, with a common difference of -1. The number of terms in this series is 29.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)\n\nwhere n is the number of terms.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nSum = (29/2) * (29 + 1) = (29/2) * 30 = (29 * 30)/2 = 870/2 = 435\n\nSo, there are 435 handshakes in total.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this problem? Maybe using combinations?\n\nYes, actually, this is a classic problem in combinatorics. The number of handshakes is equivalent to the number of ways to choose 2 students out of 30 to shake hands, since each handshake involves 2 students.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 30 and k = 2.\n\nSo, C(30, 2) = 30! / (2! * (30 - 2)!) = (30!)/(2! * 28!) = (30 * 29 * 28!)/(2 * 1 * 28!)) = (30 * 29)/2 = 870/2 = 435\n\nAgain, we get 435 handshakes.\n\nIs there a way to verify this answer? Maybe by trying a smaller number of students and seeing if the formula holds.\n\nLet's say there are 3 students: A, B, and C.\n\nPossible handshakes:\n\nA shakes hands with B\n\nA shakes hands with C\n\nB shakes hands with C\n\nTotal handshakes: 3\n\nUsing the formula, C(3, 2) = 3! / (2! * (3 - 2)!) = (6)/(2 * 1)) = 3\n\nIt matches.\n\nAnother example: 4 students: A, B, C, D\n\nPossible handshakes:\n\nA-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, C-D\n\nTotal handshakes: 6\n\nUsing the formula, C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * 2!) = 24 / (2 * 2) = 24/4 = 6\n\nAgain, it matches.\n\nSo, the formula seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, going back to the arithmetic series approach, for n students, the number of handshakes would be (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1, which is the sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers, equal to (n-1)*n/2.\n\nFor n=30, it's (29*30)/2 = 435, which matches the combination formula.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 435 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{435} \\]"
