Wait, no, subtraction is inside the parentheses, so I should do that first.\n\nSo, inside the parentheses, we have (6 - 2), which is 4. So, (6 - 2)^2 is 4^2, which is 16.\n\nNow, the expression simplifies to (4^2 * 3) / 16.\n\nNext, 4^2 is 16, so it's (16 * 3) / 16.\n\n16 * 3 is 48, so now it's 48 / 16.\n\n48 divided by 16 is 3.\n\nSo, the final answer is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
