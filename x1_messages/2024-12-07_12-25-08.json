        "content": "Let's solve the equation step by step. The equation given is:\n\n3x - 7 = 2(x - 4) + 5\n\nFirst, I need to expand the right side of the equation. There's a 2 multiplied by (x - 4), so I'll distribute the 2 to both x and -4.\n\n2 * x = 2x\n\n2 * (-4) = -8\n\nSo, 2(x - 4) equals 2x - 8.\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n3x - 7 = 2x - 8 + 5\n\nNext, I'll combine like terms on the right side. -8 + 5 equals -3.\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n\n3x - 7 = 2x - 3\n\nNow, I need to get all the x terms on one side and the constant terms on the other side.\n\nI can subtract 2x from both sides to eliminate x from the right side.\n\n3x - 2x - 7 = 2x - 2x - 3\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx - 7 = -3\n\nNow, to isolate x, I'll add 7 to both sides.\n\nx - 7 + 7 = -3 + 7\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = 4\n\nSo, the solution is x = 4.\n\nTo verify, I can plug x = 4 back into the original equation to check if both sides are equal.\n\nLeft side: 3(4) - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5\n\nRight side: 2(4 - 4) + 5 = 2(0) + 5 = 0 + 5 = 5\n\nYes, both sides equal 5, so the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
