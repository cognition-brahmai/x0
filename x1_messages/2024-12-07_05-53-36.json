        "content": "So I have this problem here: a sphere has a volume of 36\u03c0 cubic inches, and I need to find the radius in inches. Okay, I remember that the formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where V is the volume and r is the radius. So, I have V = 36\u03c0, and I need to solve for r.\n\nLet me write down the formula again: V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3.\n\nGiven that V = 36\u03c0, I can substitute that into the formula:\n\n36\u03c0 = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3.\n\nHmm, I need to solve for r. First, I can probably simplify this equation by getting rid of \u03c0 since it appears on both sides. Yes, I can divide both sides by \u03c0:\n\n36\u03c0 / \u03c0 = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 / \u03c0,\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n36 = (4/3)r\u00b3.\n\nAlright, now I need to isolate r\u00b3. To do that, I can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 4/3, which is 3/4:\n\n36 * (3/4) = (4/3)r\u00b3 * (3/4),\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n27 = r\u00b3.\n\nOkay, so r\u00b3 = 27. To find r, I need to take the cube root of both sides:\n\nr = \u00b3\u221a27.\n\nI know that 3\u00b3 = 27, so r = 3.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. If r = 3, then V = (4/3)\u03c0(3)^3 = (4/3)\u03c0(27) = (4/3)*27*\u03c0 = 36\u03c0, which matches the given volume.\n\nSo, the radius is 3 inches.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if there's any other possible solution. Since the radius can't be negative in a physical context, r = 3 is the only valid solution.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's go through the steps again.\n\nStarting with V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3,\n\nSubstitute V = 36\u03c0:\n\n36\u03c0 = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3.\n\nDivide both sides by \u03c0:\n\n36 = (4/3)r\u00b3.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3/4:\n\n36 * (3/4) = r\u00b3,\n\nWhich is 27 = r\u00b3.\n\nCube root of 27 is 3, so r = 3.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for r in terms of V: r = \u00b3\u221a(3V / (4\u03c0)).\n\nSubstituting V = 36\u03c0:\n\nr = \u00b3\u221a(3*(36\u03c0) / (4\u03c0)) = \u00b3\u221a(108\u03c0 / 4\u03c0) = \u00b3\u221a(27) = 3.\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
