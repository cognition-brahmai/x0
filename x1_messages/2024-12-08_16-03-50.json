        "content": "Certainly! I'd be happy to help you with that. So, you need a JavaScript function that takes two arrays as input: one containing names and the other containing ages. The function should create an array of objects, where each object has a \"name\" and an \"age\" property corresponding to the elements from the input arrays. Additionally, if the two input arrays have different lengths, the function should throw an error.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, we need to define a function that accepts two parameters: one for the names array and one for the ages array. We'll call them, say, `names` and `ages`.\n\nNext, we need to check if the lengths of these two arrays are equal. If they're not, we should throw an error. We can use a simple if statement for this:\n\n```javascript\nif (names.length !== ages.length) {\n  throw new Error(\"Arrays must be of the same length.\");\n}\n```\n\nIf the lengths are equal, we can proceed to create the array of objects. We'll initialize an empty array, say `people`, and then loop through the arrays, pushing objects with \"name\" and \"age\" properties into this array.\n\nWe can use a for loop for this purpose. Here's how it might look:\n\n```javascript\nlet people = [];\nfor (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {\n  people.push({ name: names[i], age: ages[i] });\n}\nreturn people;\n```\n\nPutting it all together, the function would look like this:\n\n```javascript\nfunction createPeopleObjects(names, ages) {\n  if (names.length !== ages.length) {\n    throw new Error(\"Arrays must be of the same length.\");\n  }\n  let people = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {\n    people.push({ name: names[i], age: ages[i] });\n  }\n  return people;\n}\n```\n\nYou can test this function by passing in two arrays of the same length:\n\n```javascript\nconst names = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"];\nconst ages = [25, 30, 35];\nconsole.log(createPeopleObjects(names, ages));\n// Output: [{ name: 'Alice', age: 25 }, { name: 'Bob', age: 30 }, { name: 'Charlie', age: 35 }]\n```\n\nIf you pass arrays of different lengths, it should throw an error:\n\n```javascript\nconst names = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"];\nconst ages = [25, 30, 35];\nconsole.log(createPeopleObjects(names, ages));\n// Throws: Error: Arrays must be of the same length.\n```\n\nThis should accomplish what you're looking for.
