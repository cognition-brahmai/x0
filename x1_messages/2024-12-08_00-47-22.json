There are four types of deserts based on temperature: hot and dry, semiarid, coastal, and cold. Cold deserts, also known as frigid deserts, can be found in high-latitude areas and have low temperatures, sometimes even below freezing. So, while many deserts are hot, there are also deserts that experience cold temperatures."
