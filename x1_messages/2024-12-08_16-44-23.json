        "content": "So the theme park is thinking about adding a new roller coaster, and they've estimated that it's going to cost $20 million to build. They expect that this new roller coaster will bring in an extra $3 million each year from ticket sales. The question is, how many years will it take for the park to recover the initial $20 million investment, assuming that there are no additional maintenance costs and that ticket prices stay the same?\n\nOkay, so to figure this out, I need to determine how long it will take for the additional revenue from the roller coaster to equal the initial cost of building it. It seems like a straightforward break-even analysis.\n\nFirst, I should note down the numbers we're working with:\n\n- Initial investment: $20,000,000\n\n- Annual additional revenue: $3,000,000\n\nThe goal is to find out how many years it will take for the total additional revenue to equal the initial investment.\n\nSo, I can set up an equation where the total revenue equals the initial investment:\n\nTotal revenue = Annual revenue \u00d7 Number of years\n\nLet\u2019s let \u201cn\u201d represent the number of years. Then:\n\n$3,000,000 \u00d7 n = $20,000,000\n\nNow, I need to solve for n:\n\nn = $20,000,000 / $3,000,000\n\nLet\u2019s do the division:\n\nn = 6.6667 years\n\nSince we're dealing with years, and likely can't have a fraction of a year in this context, I might need to round this to a whole number.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this. In reality, the park probably won't get the full $3 million in the seventh year, so it might take a little over six years but less than seven years to recover the cost.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of how much revenue is generated each year and see when the cumulative revenue equals or exceeds the initial investment.\n\nLet\u2019s make a quick table to see the cumulative revenue over the years:\n\n- End of Year 1: $3,000,000\n\n- End of Year 2: $6,000,000\n\n- End of Year 3: $9,000,000\n\n- End of Year 4: $12,000,000\n\n- End of Year 5: $15,000,000\n\n- End of Year 6: $18,000,000\n\n- End of Year 7: $21,000,000\n\nSo, at the end of year 6, the cumulative revenue is $18,000,000, which is still $2,000,000 short of the $20,000,000 investment. Therefore, it will take part of the seventh year to generate the remaining $2,000,000.\n\nTo find out exactly when in the seventh year the park will recover the investment, I can calculate the fraction of the year needed to generate $2,000,000 at a rate of $3,000,000 per year.\n\nFraction of year = $2,000,000 / $3,000,000 = 2/3 \u2248 0.6667\n\nSo, it will take 6 full years plus approximately two-thirds of a seventh year to recover the investment.\n\nIf we convert that to years, it's 6 + 0.6667 \u2248 6.6667 years, which is what I got earlier.\n\nBut maybe it's better to express it in years and months. Since 0.6667 of a year is roughly 8 months (because 0.6667 \u00d7 12 months \u2248 8 months), it would take 6 years and 8 months to recover the investment.\n\nAlternatively, if the park gets revenue on a monthly basis, I could calculate it more precisely.\n\nAssuming that the annual revenue is evenly distributed throughout the year, the monthly additional revenue would be:\n\n$3,000,000 / 12 = $250,000 per month\n\nAt the end of year 6, the park has accumulated $18,000,000. It needs an additional $2,000,000 to reach $20,000,000.\n\nSo, the number of months needed to generate $2,000,000 at $250,000 per month is:\n\n$2,000,000 / $250,000/month = 8 months\n\nTherefore, it will take 6 years and 8 months to recover the initial investment.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any other costs involved, like maintenance or operational costs. However, the problem states to assume no additional maintenance costs or changes in ticket prices, so I don't need to factor those in.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that this is a simplified analysis. In reality, there might be other factors to consider, such as the time value of money, inflation, increases in operational costs, or changes in visitor numbers. But based on the information provided, I can ignore those factors.\n\nSo, in conclusion, it will take the theme park approximately 6.67 years, or 6 years and 8 months, to recover the initial $20 million investment in the new roller coaster, given that it generates an additional $3 million in annual revenue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6.\\overline{6} \\text{ years}} \\]"
