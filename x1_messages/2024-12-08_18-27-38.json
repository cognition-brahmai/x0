But tonight, I've made the difficult decision to hang up the cape and cowl.\n\nIt's not that the job is done \u2013 far from it. Gotham still faces countless threats, both from within and without. But I've reached a point where I can no longer give everything I have to this fight. I need to step back and focus on other aspects of my life.\n\nBeing Batman has been all-consuming. It's taken a toll on my body, my mind, and my relationships. I've pushed myself to the limit, and sometimes beyond. I've faced unimaginable dangers, fought some of the most notorious villains in the world, and barely escaped with my life more times than I can count.\n\nBut despite all that, I've never regretted putting on the cape and cowl. Gotham needs someone to stand up to the forces of darkness, to protect the innocent and bring justice to those who deserve it. And for as long as I could, I did just that.\n\nBut now, I have to pass the torch to someone else. Someone who is ready to take on the responsibility, someone who is willing to make the sacrifices that come with being Batman.\n\nI know that Gotham will always need a symbol of hope in the face of despair, a champion who will never give up in the fight against crime and corruption. And I believe that there are people out there who are capable of carrying on that legacy.\n\nSo tonight, I say goodbye to Batman. But rest assured, Gotham, that the spirit of Batman will live on, inspiring others to fight for what is right, to never back down from a challenge, and to always believe that good can triumph over evil.\n\nThis is Bruce Wayne, signing off as Batman."
