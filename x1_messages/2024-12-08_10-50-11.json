        "content": "So the company has an annual revenue of $5 million. That means every year, they bring in $5,000,000. Now, they spend money on different things, right? Like salaries, rent and utilities, and marketing. Let's see how much they spend on each of these and then figure out what's left as profit.\n\nFirst, they spend 40% on salaries. So, 40% of $5 million is how much?\n\nWell, 40% of 5,000,000 is calculated as 0.40 times 5,000,000, which is $2,000,000. So, they spend $2 million on salaries.\n\nNext, they spend 30% on rent and utilities. So, 30% of $5 million is?\n\n30% of 5,000,000 is 0.30 times 5,000,000, which equals $1,500,000. So, $1.5 million on rent and utilities.\n\nThen, they spend 20% on marketing. 20% of $5 million is?\n\n20% of 5,000,000 is 0.20 times 5,000,000, which is $1,000,000. So, $1 million on marketing.\n\nNow, let's add up all their expenses:\n\nSalaries: $2,000,000\n\nRent and utilities: $1,500,000\n\nMarketing: $1,000,000\n\nTotal expenses = $2,000,000 + $1,500,000 + $1,000,000 = $4,500,000.\n\nSo, they spend a total of $4.5 million.\n\nNow, to find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total revenue.\n\nProfit = Revenue - Expenses = $5,000,000 - $4,500,000 = $500,000.\n\nTherefore, the company makes an annual profit of $500,000.\n\nBut wait a minute, I think I should check if there are any other expenses. The problem mentions spends on salaries, rent and utilities, and marketing, but maybe there are other costs like taxes, supplies, etc. However, based on the information given, these are the only expenses mentioned. So, probably, $500,000 is the operating profit before other expenses.\n\nAlternatively, if there are no other expenses, then $500,000 would be the net profit.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider if there are any implicit expenses. For example, are there costs like goods sold, depreciation, or interest? The problem doesn't mention any, so perhaps it's just these three expenses.\n\nSo, sticking to the given data, the profit is $500,000 annually.\n\nLet me just double-check the calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst, 40% of 5 million is indeed 2 million for salaries.\n\n30% of 5 million is 1.5 million for rent and utilities.\n\n20% of 5 million is 1 million for marketing.\n\nTotal expenses: 2 + 1.5 + 1 = 4.5 million.\n\nRevenue minus expenses: 5 million - 4.5 million = 500,000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of percentages.\n\nTotal percentage spent: 40% + 30% + 20% = 90%.\n\nSo, 90% of 5 million is spent, which is 0.90 times 5 million = 4.5 million.\n\nTherefore, the remaining 10% is the profit: 0.10 times 5 million = 500,000.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, the company makes an annual profit of $500,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500000} \\]"
