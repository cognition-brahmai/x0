        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that currently produces 1200 units per day. Because of increased demand, they need to produce 25% more units each day. We need to find out how many additional workers are required, given that each worker can produce 40 units per day.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate what 25% more than 1200 units is. To find 25% of 1200, I can multiply 1200 by 0.25:\n\n1200 * 0.25 = 300 units\n\nSo, the factory needs to produce an additional 300 units per day to meet the increased demand.\n\nNow, each worker can produce 40 units per day. To find out how many additional workers are needed to produce these extra 300 units, I can divide the additional units required by the number of units each worker can produce:\n\n300 / 40 = 7.5\n\nSince you can't have half a worker, the factory would need to hire 8 additional workers to meet the increased production demand.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. If 7 workers are hired, they can produce 7 * 40 = 280 units, which is less than the required 300 units. So, indeed, 8 workers are needed to produce at least 320 units, which covers the extra 300 units needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way to look at this. Maybe the factory wants to increase overall production by 25%, meaning the new total production should be 1200 + 300 = 1500 units per day.\n\nIf each worker produces 40 units per day, the total number of workers needed to produce 1500 units would be:\n\n1500 / 40 = 37.5 workers\n\nAgain, since you can't have half a worker, they would need 38 workers in total.\n\nBut, to find the additional workers needed, we should subtract the current number of workers from this total.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many workers are currently employed. If the factory is producing 1200 units per day and each worker produces 40 units, then the current number of workers is:\n\n1200 / 40 = 30 workers\n\nSo, if they need a total of 38 workers to meet the new production target, the additional workers needed would be:\n\n38 - 30 = 8 workers\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward way to calculate this. Since the production needs to increase by 25%, and each worker can increase production by 40 units per day, we can calculate the number of additional workers needed directly.\n\nWe already did that by dividing the additional units needed (300) by the production per worker (40), which gave us 7.5, rounding up to 8 workers.\n\nI think both methods confirm that the factory needs to hire 8 additional workers.\n\nBut let's consider if there are any other factors to consider. For example, are there any constraints on hiring, like maximum working hours or factory capacity? The problem doesn't mention any such constraints, so we can assume that hiring additional workers is the only variable.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the factory can't hire half a worker, so we need to round up to the next whole number, which is 8.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the total production capacity needed and see how many workers are required to reach that capacity.\n\nCurrent production: 1200 units\n\nRequired increase: 25% of 1200 = 300 units\n\nNew total production required: 1200 + 300 = 1500 units\n\nEach worker produces 40 units per day.\n\nNumber of workers needed = total units required / units per worker = 1500 / 40 = 37.5\n\nSince we can't have half a worker, we round up to 38 workers.\n\nCurrent number of workers: 30\n\nAdditional workers needed: 38 - 30 = 8 workers\n\nThis reinforces our previous conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory chooses to work overtime or improve worker productivity, but the problem specifies that each worker can produce 40 units per day, and doesn't mention any possibilities for increasing productivity beyond that, we should assume that the only way to increase production is by hiring more workers.\n\nTherefore, the factory needs to hire 8 additional workers.\n\nWait, but let's think about this again. If each worker can produce 40 units per day, and the factory needs an additional 300 units, then 7 workers would produce 280 units, which is less than 300. So, indeed, 8 workers are needed to produce 320 units, which exceeds the required 300 units.\n\nBut perhaps the factory could hire fewer workers and have existing workers work overtime to make up the difference. However, since the problem doesn't mention any possibilities for overtime or productivity improvements, and simply asks for the number of additional workers needed, assuming each produces 40 units per day, we should stick with the calculation that 8 additional workers are needed.\n\nAnother angle to consider: if the factory hires 7 workers, they can produce 280 additional units, falling short by 20 units. But since the factory needs to meet the entire demand, they can't fall short; hence, they must hire the 8th worker to cover the extra 20 units.\n\nTherefore, the factory needs to hire 8 additional workers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
