        "content": "To design a SQL query that returns the average salary of employees grouped by department, along with the total number of employees in each department, you can use the following approach:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The \"employee\" table has columns such as \"emp_id\", \"name\", \"dept_id\", etc.\n- The \"department\" table has columns like \"dept_id\", \"dept_name\", etc.\n- The \"salary\" table has columns like \"emp_id\", \"salary_amount\", etc.\n- There are relationships between these tables based on \"emp_id\" and \"dept_id\".\n\nGiven these assumptions, you would need to join these tables appropriately and then group the results by department to calculate the average salary and count the number of employees in each department.\n\nHere's a sample SQL query that achieves this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    d.dept_name,\n    AVG(s.salary_amount) AS average_salary,\n    COUNT(e.emp_id) AS total_employees\nFROM \n    department d\nJOIN \n    employee e ON d.dept_id = e.dept_id\nJOIN \n    salary s ON e.emp_id = s.emp_id\nGROUP BY \n    d.dept_name;\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Select Clause**: We select the department name, the average salary amount, and the count of employees.\n2. **From Clause**: We start with the \"department\" table.\n3. **Join Clauses**:\n   - Join the \"employee\" table on the department ID to link employees to their departments.\n   - Join the \"salary\" table on the employee ID to link salaries to employees.\n4. **Group By Clause**: Group the results by department name to calculate averages and counts per department.\n\nThis query assumes that each employee has exactly one salary record. If there are multiple salary records per employee, you might need to aggregate the salary data appropriately, possibly using a subquery to get the latest or average salary per employee.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that there are no NULL values in the columns used for calculations, or handle them appropriately using functions like COALESCE or IFNULL.\n\n**Note**: Adjust the column names and table names as per your actual database schema.\n"
