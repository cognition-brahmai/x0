        "content": "So if I'm driving at an average speed of 50 miles per hour for 3 hours and 30 minutes, I need to find out how far I'll have gone, right? Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, distance = speed \u00d7 time.\n\nMy speed is 50 miles per hour, and time is 3 hours and 30 minutes. But, I need to make sure that the units match, right? Since speed is in miles per hour, time should be in hours.\n\nSo, 3 hours and 30 minutes is 3.5 hours, because 30 minutes is half an hour.\n\nNow, plugging in the values:\n\nDistance = 50 miles/hour \u00d7 3.5 hours.\n\nLet me calculate that. 50 multiplied by 3 is 150, and 50 multiplied by 0.5 is 25. So, 150 + 25 equals 175 miles.\n\nTherefore, I would have traveled 175 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this to confirm? Maybe using the formula for time, which is time = distance/speed.\n\nBut, in this case, I have speed and time, and I'm solving for distance. So, the first method should suffice.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of how far I travel each hour.\n\nIn one hour, at 50 mph, I travel 50 miles.\n\nSo, in 3 hours, I would travel 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 miles.\n\nThen, in 30 minutes, which is half an hour, I would travel half of 50 miles, which is 25 miles.\n\nAdding those together, 150 + 25 = 175 miles.\n\nYeah, that matches my first calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to be more precise, I could convert everything to minutes.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 50 miles per hour is 50/60 miles per minute.\n\nBut that seems more complicated, and I might introduce errors.\n\nI think sticking with the first method is best.\n\nSo, final answer: 175 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{175} \\]"
