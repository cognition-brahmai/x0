        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have four boxes with apples, and we're given some relationships between the number of apples in each box, along with the total number of apples. I need to find out how many apples are in each box.\n\nFirst, I should assign variables to represent the number of apples in each box. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of apples in the second box.\n\nThen, according to the problem:\n\n- The first box has 10 more apples than the second box, so it has \\( x + 10 \\) apples.\n\n- The third box has 15 fewer apples than the first box, so it has \\( (x + 10) - 15 = x - 5 \\) apples.\n\n- The fourth box has twice as many apples as the third box, so it has \\( 2(x - 5) \\) apples.\n\nNow, the total number of apples in all four boxes is 85. So, I can set up an equation that adds up the apples in all boxes and sets them equal to 85:\n\n\\[ (x + 10) + x + (x - 5) + 2(x - 5) = 85 \\]\n\nLet me simplify this equation step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the terms:\n\n\\[ x + 10 + x + x - 5 + 2x - 10 = 85 \\]\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n\\[ x + x + x + 2x + 10 - 5 - 10 = 85 \\]\n\n\\[ 5x - 5 = 85 \\]\n\nNext, add 5 to both sides to isolate the terms with \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ 5x - 5 + 5 = 85 + 5 \\]\n\n\\[ 5x = 90 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{90}{5} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 18 \\]\n\nSo, the second box has 18 apples.\n\nNow, I can find the number of apples in the other boxes:\n\n- First box: \\( x + 10 = 18 + 10 = 28 \\) apples\n\n- Third box: \\( x - 5 = 18 - 5 = 13 \\) apples\n\n- Fourth box: \\( 2(x - 5) = 2(13) = 26 \\) apples\n\nLet me check if these numbers add up to 85:\n\n\\[ 28 + 18 + 13 + 26 = 85 \\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of apples in each box is:\n\n- First box: 28 apples\n\n- Second box: 18 apples\n\n- Third box: 13 apples\n\n- Fourth box: 26 apples\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28, 18, 13, 26} \\]"
