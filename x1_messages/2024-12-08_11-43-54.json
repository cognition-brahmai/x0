So, I would have five apples.\n\nNow, if you take away one apple from me, that means I lose one apple. So, five minus one would be four apples left. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nBut wait a minute, is there any trick here or something I'm missing? It seems like a basic addition and subtraction problem. Two apples, plus three apples, equals five apples. Then, taking away one apple leaves me with four apples.\n\nHmm, maybe it's testing my understanding of basic arithmetic operations. Or perhaps it's a setup for a more complicated problem later on.\n\nIn any case, based on the information given, I have four apples left after you take one away.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
