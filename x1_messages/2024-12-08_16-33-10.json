        "content": "Let's see. I walk at a speed of 3 miles per hour for 2 hours and 30 minutes. I need to find out how far I've traveled. Okay, distance is usually speed multiplied by time, right? So, distance = speed \u00d7 time.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that the time is in the same units as the speed. The speed is in miles per hour, so I should convert the time into hours.\n\nI have 2 hours and 30 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is half an hour. Therefore, 2 hours and 30 minutes is equal to 2.5 hours.\n\nNow, I can calculate the distance:\n\ndistance = 3 miles per hour \u00d7 2.5 hours = 7.5 miles.\n\nSo, I would have traveled 7.5 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using fractions. 30 minutes is 0.5 hours, so 2 hours plus 0.5 hours is indeed 2.5 hours. Multiplying that by 3 miles per hour gives me 7.5 miles.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 30 minutes is 150 minutes total. But my speed is in miles per hour, so it might be better to keep it in hours.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the speed to miles per minute. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 miles per hour is 3/60 miles per minute, which is 0.05 miles per minute.\n\nThen, over 150 minutes, the distance would be 0.05 miles per minute \u00d7 150 minutes = 7.5 miles.\n\nSo, either way, I end up with 7.5 miles.\n\nIs there any other way to check this? Maybe using the formula for distance again, but I think that's straightforward.\n\nWait, another thought: if I walk at 3 miles per hour for 2 hours, that's 6 miles. Then, for the additional 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours, at 3 miles per hour, that's 1.5 miles. So, 6 miles plus 1.5 miles is 7.5 miles.\n\nAgain, the same answer. So, I'm confident that 7.5 miles is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the units. Speed is in miles per hour, time is in hours, so miles per hour multiplied by hours gives miles, which is the unit for distance. That makes sense.\n\nAlso, thinking about real life, if I walk at 3 miles per hour, which is a reasonable walking speed, for 2.5 hours, covering 7.5 miles seems about right.\n\nI don't think there are any tricks in this problem, like considering rest stops or changes in speed, so I think 7.5 miles is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.5} \\]"
