The company currently operates 15 ships, each with a maximum capacity of 10,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units). They plan to replace five older ships with new ones, each having a capacity of 12,000 TEUs. Calculate the overall change in the company's cargo capacity and determine how many additional containers they can transport on their busiest route, which typically utilizes 75% of the available capacity.

        "content": "So the shipping company wants to optimize its cargo distribution by replacing some of its older ships with newer ones that have higher capacities. Let's break down the information given and calculate the overall change in cargo capacity, and then figure out how many additional containers they can transport on their busiest route.\n\nFirst, the company currently operates 15 ships, each with a maximum capacity of 10,000 TEUs. So, the total current capacity is:\n\n\\[\n15 \\text{ ships} \\times 10,000 \\text{ TEUs/ship} = 150,000 \\text{ TEUs}\n\\]\n\nThey plan to replace five of these older ships with new ones, each having a capacity of 12,000 TEUs. So, the capacity of the new ships is:\n\n\\[\n5 \\text{ ships} \\times 12,000 \\text{ TEUs/ship} = 60,000 \\text{ TEUs}\n\\]\n\nThe capacity of the remaining ten older ships remains the same:\n\n\\[\n10 \\text{ ships} \\times 10,000 \\text{ TEUs/ship} = 100,000 \\text{ TEUs}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the new total capacity after the replacement is:\n\n\\[\n100,000 \\text{ TEUs} + 60,000 \\text{ TEUs} = 160,000 \\text{ TEUs}\n\\]\n\nThe overall change in the company's cargo capacity is:\n\n\\[\n160,000 \\text{ TEUs} - 150,000 \\text{ TEUs} = 10,000 \\text{ TEUs}\n\\]\n\nSo, the company's cargo capacity increases by 10,000 TEUs.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many additional containers they can transport on their busiest route, which typically utilizes 75% of the available capacity.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the utilized capacity before and after the replacement.\n\nBefore replacement, the utilized capacity is:\n\n\\[\n150,000 \\text{ TEUs} \\times 0.75 = 112,500 \\text{ TEUs}\n\\]\n\nAfter replacement, the utilized capacity is:\n\n\\[\n160,000 \\text{ TEUs} \\times 0.75 = 120,000 \\text{ TEUs}\n\\]\n\nThe additional containers that can be transported on the busiest route are:\n\n\\[\n120,000 \\text{ TEUs} - 112,500 \\text{ TEUs} = 7,500 \\text{ TEUs}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the company can transport an additional 7,500 TEUs on their busiest route after replacing five older ships with newer ones.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7500} \\]"
