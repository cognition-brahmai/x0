        "content": "I believe the rock you're referring to is granite. Granite is a common type of intrusive, felsic igneous rock that is widely used in construction due to its strength and durability. It's composed mainly of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase feldspar. The famous American monument you mentioned is Mount Rushmore, which is located in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The mountain is made largely of granite, which made it a suitable choice for the carving of the presidential faces.\n\nGranite has been valued for its beauty and durability for centuries. It's not only used in construction but also in sculptures and monuments. The fact that Mount Rushmore is carved into granite speaks to the rock's resistance to weathering and erosion, ensuring that the sculptures can withstand the test of time.\n\nI hope this answers your question! If you have any more, feel free to ask."
