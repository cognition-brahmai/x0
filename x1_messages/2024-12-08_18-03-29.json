        "content": "So I have this problem here about a garden and a fence with a walkway. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a rectangular garden that's 20 meters long and 15 meters wide. I need to build a fence around it, and there's also going to be a 3-meter-wide walkway outside the fence. So, I guess the fenced area includes both the garden and the walkway.\n\nWait, no. The fence is around the garden, and then there's a walkway outside the fence. So, the fence is right around the garden, and the walkway is outside the fence.\n\nBut the problem says \"build a fence around the entire garden with an additional 3-meter-wide walkway outside the fence.\" So, the walkway is outside the fence.\n\nBut I think I need to find the perimeter of the fenced area. So, the fenced area is just the garden plus the walkway.\n\nWait, no. The fence is around the garden, and the walkway is outside the fence. So, the fenced area is just the garden, and the walkway is outside the fence.\n\nBut the problem says \"build a fence around the entire garden with an additional 3-meter-wide walkway outside the fence.\" So, the fence is around the garden, and then there's a walkway outside the fence.\n\nSo, the fenced area is just the garden, and the walkway is beyond the fence.\n\nBut I think maybe I need to consider the total area that's fenced, including the walkway.\n\nWait, maybe I need to visualize this.\n\nLet me draw a rectangle for the garden: length 20m, width 15m.\n\nThen, around the garden, there's a fence.\n\nOutside the fence, there's a 3m walkway.\n\nSo, the fence is right against the garden, and the walkway is outside the fence.\n\nSo, the fenced area is the garden plus the walkway.\n\nWait, but the walkway is outside the fence, so the fence doesn't include the walkway.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the fenced area should just be the perimeter of the garden.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because the walkway is outside the fence, so maybe the fence is expanded to include the walkway.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nGarden: 20m by 15m.\n\nFence around the garden.\n\nThen, outside the fence, there's a 3m walkway.\n\nSo, the fence is around the garden, and the walkway is around the fence.\n\nSo, the total area enclosed would be the garden plus the walkway.\n\nWait, but the walkway is outside the fence.\n\nSo, the fence is around the garden, and then there's a walkway around the fence.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the fenced area would be the perimeter of the garden plus the walkway.\n\nSo, effectively, the fenced area is the garden plus the walkway.\n\nSo, I need to find the perimeter of the garden plus the walkway.\n\nSo, since the walkway is 3m wide all around, it adds 3m to each side.\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, since the walkway is outside the fence, which is around the garden, the walkway adds to both the length and the width.\n\nBut wait, the fence is around the garden, so the walkway is outside the fence, meaning it's outside the fence on all sides.\n\nSo, the total length would be the garden's length plus twice the walkway width (because the walkway is on both sides).\n\nSimilarly for the width.\n\nSo, total length = 20m + 2*(3m) = 26m.\n\nTotal width = 15m + 2*(3m) = 21m.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the fenced area, which includes the garden and the walkway, would be 2*(length + width) = 2*(26m + 21m) = 2*(47m) = 94m.\n\nWait, but is the fenced area including the walkway?\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"build a fence around the entire garden with an additional 3-meter-wide walkway outside the fence.\"\n\nSo, the fence is around the garden, and then there's a walkway outside the fence.\n\nSo, the fenced area is just the garden, and the walkway is outside the fence.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the fenced area should be just the perimeter of the garden, which is 2*(20m + 15m) = 2*(35m) = 70m.\n\nBut that doesn't include the walkway.\n\nBut maybe the problem is asking for the perimeter of the entire area, including the walkway.\n\nThe problem says: \"what is the perimeter of the fenced area?\"\n\nSo, if the fence is around the garden and the walkway is outside the fence, then the fenced area is just the garden.\n\nBut perhaps the fence includes the walkway.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose the garden is 20m by 15m.\n\nFence is built around the garden.\n\nThen, outside the fence, there's a 3m walkway.\n\nSo, the walkway is surrounding the fence.\n\nSo, the total area enclosed by the fence plus the walkway would be the garden plus the walkway.\n\nBut the fence is only around the garden.\n\nSo, perhaps the perimeter of the fenced area is just the perimeter of the garden.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fence is built to include the walkway, meaning the fence is around the garden plus the walkway.\n\nIn that case, the total length would be 20m + 2*3m = 26m.\n\nTotal width would be 15m + 2*3m = 21m.\n\nThen, the perimeter would be 2*(26m + 21m) = 2*47m = 94m.\n\nBut the problem says \"build a fence around the entire garden with an additional 3-meter-wide walkway outside the fence.\"\n\nSo, the fence is around the garden, and then the walkway is outside the fence.\n\nSo, the fence is around the garden only, and the walkway is beyond the fence.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the fenced area is just the perimeter of the garden, which is 70m.\n\nBut perhaps the problem intends for the fence to enclose both the garden and the walkway.\n\nIn that case, the fenced area would be garden plus walkway, and the perimeter would be 94m.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the problem is expecting the perimeter of the fence that includes both the garden and the walkway.\n\nSo, I'll go with the perimeter being 94 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{94} \\]"
