Here's a possible set of lyrics for a song about finding solace and strength in times of despair.)\n\n**Title: Shelter in the Storm**\n\n*(Verse 1)*  \nWhen the world feels like it's crashing down,  \nAnd darkness tries to steal your crown,  \nRemember there's a love that never fades,  \nIn Jesus' arms, your soul is saved.\n\n*(Chorus)*  \nOh, find your shelter in the storm,  \nIn the Lord of life, where love is warm.  \nWith every step, He walks beside,  \nIn His presence, all fears subside.\n\n*(Verse 2)*  \nThrough the valleys deep and mountains high,  \nHis grace will see you through the sky.  \nWhen tears fall like rain and hope seems lost,  \nHis word is a lamp that guides you most.\n\n*(Chorus)*  \nSo find your shelter in the storm,  \nIn the Savior's hands, where peace is warm.  \nWith every trial, He makes you strong,  \nIn His embrace, you belong.\n\n*(Bridge)*  \nLift up your eyes, behold the dawn,  \nFor His mercy endures till morn.  \nNo wave too high, no wind too wild,  \nIn His bosom, you're reconciled.\n\n*(Chorus)*  \nFind your shelter in the storm,  \nIn the Master's care, where hearts transform.  \nWith every challenge, He refines,  \nIn His kingdom, joy aligns.\n\n*(Outro)*  \nSo sing aloud, let praises ring,  \nFor in Christ, our victory's won.  \nIn the storm, in the calm, in the night,  \nHis love is our guiding light.\n\n***(End of Lyrics)***\n\nThis song is meant to be a source of comfort and encouragement, reminding believers that no matter how dark things may seem, God is always present and ready to provide solace and strength. The imagery of a shelter in the storm is a common theme in gospel music, symbolizing the security and peace found in faith during trying times."
