        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a car rental company. They charge a flat fee of $50 per day plus an additional $0.25 per mile driven. The customer rents a car for 3 days and drives 200 miles, and I need to find out the total cost of the rental. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a flat fee per day. The customer rents the car for 3 days, so I need to calculate the total flat fee for those 3 days. The flat fee is $50 per day, so for 3 days, it would be 3 times $50. Let me do that multiplication: 3 * 50 equals $150. So, the total flat fee is $150.\n\nNext, there's an additional charge of $0.25 per mile driven. The customer drove 200 miles, so I need to calculate the cost for those 200 miles. To do this, I'll multiply the number of miles by the cost per mile. That's 200 miles times $0.25 per mile. Let's do that multiplication: 200 * 0.25 equals $50. So, the cost for the miles driven is $50.\n\nNow, to find the total cost of the rental, I need to add the total flat fee and the cost for the miles driven. That's $150 plus $50, which equals $200.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should consider if there's any other charge or if I've missed something in the problem. The problem says there's a flat fee of $50 per day plus $0.25 per mile driven. The customer rents the car for 3 days and drives 200 miles. I've calculated the flat fee for 3 days and the mileage charge for 200 miles, and added them together to get $200. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can think of it as the total cost being the sum of the daily charges and the mileage charges. So, daily charges would be 3 days * $50/day = $150, and mileage charges are 200 miles * $0.25/mile = $50. Adding those up gives $200 again.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total cost formula, which would be: Total Cost = (Number of Days * Flat Fee per Day) + (Number of Miles * Cost per Mile). Plugging in the numbers: Total Cost = (3 * 50) + (200 * 0.25) = 150 + 50 = 200.\n\nI'm getting the same answer using different methods, which makes me more confident that $200 is the correct total cost.\n\nLet me consider if there might be any extra fees or if there's something in the problem that I've overlooked. The problem doesn't mention any additional charges, taxes, or fees beyond the daily flat fee and the per-mile charge. So, I think $200 is the total cost.\n\nJust for extra clarity, I can also think about it in terms of the cost per day including the miles driven. But that might complicate things unnecessarily, since the charges are separately defined.\n\nIn conclusion, the total cost of the car rental for 3 days and 200 miles driven is $200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
