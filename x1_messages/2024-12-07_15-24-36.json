        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 250 widgets per day, and each widget sells for $12. To find out the total revenue for one month, assuming there are 30 days in that month, I need to calculate the daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days in the month.\n\nFirst, the daily revenue would be the number of widgets produced per day multiplied by the selling price per widget. So, that's 250 widgets/day times $12/widget.\n\n250 * 12 = 3,000\n\nSo, the factory makes $3,000 per day from selling widgets.\n\nNow, to find out the monthly revenue, I need to multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in the month. Assuming the month has 30 days:\n\n3,000 * 30 = 90,000\n\nTherefore, the total revenue generated by selling all the widgets produced in one month is $90,000.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. For example, perhaps there are other factors to consider, like production costs or selling expenses, but based on the information provided, it seems like it's just a straightforward calculation of revenue from sales.\n\nSo, revenue is typically calculated as the number of units sold multiplied by the price per unit. In this case, it's the number of widgets produced in a month multiplied by the selling price per widget.\n\nFirst, find out how many widgets are produced in a month:\n\n250 widgets/day * 30 days = 7,500 widgets\n\nThen, multiply the total number of widgets by the selling price per widget:\n\n7,500 widgets * $12/widget = $90,000\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the total revenue is $90,000.\n\nI think that's straightforward enough. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect the revenue. For example, are there any discounts or variations in the selling price? Does the factory sell all the widgets it produces, or is there any unsold inventory? However,\u6839\u636e provided information, it seems like none of these factors are in play here. The question states that each widget sells for $12, and we're to assume that all widgets produced in the month are sold.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the month is assumed to have 30 days. In reality, months have varying numbers of days, but since the question specifies to assume 30 days, that's what I've used.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the total revenue generated by selling all the widgets produced in one month is $90,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90000} \\]"
