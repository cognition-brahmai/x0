        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a car rental company with two types of cars: economy and luxury. The ratio of economy cars to luxury cars is 3:2, and there are 50 more economy cars than luxury cars. We need to find out the total number of cars the company has.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a ratio means. A ratio of 3:2 means that for every 3 economy cars, there are 2 luxury cars. It's like for every group of 3 economy cars, there is a corresponding group of 2 luxury cars.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of economy cars as E and the number of luxury cars as L. According to the ratio, E/L = 3/2.\n\nBut we also know that there are 50 more economy cars than luxury cars, so E = L + 50.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. E/L = 3/2\n\n2. E = L + 50\n\nWe can use these two equations to solve for E and L.\n\nLet\u2019s substitute the second equation into the first one.\n\nSo, (L + 50)/L = 3/2\n\nNow, we can solve for L.\n\nMultiply both sides by L to get rid of the denominator:\n\nL + 50 = (3/2)L\n\nNow, let's get all terms involving L on one side.\n\nSubtract L from both sides:\n\n50 = (3/2)L - L\n\n50 = (1/2)L\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 2 to solve for L:\n\nL = 100\n\nSo, there are 100 luxury cars.\n\nNow, plug this back into the second equation to find E:\n\nE = L + 50 = 100 + 50 = 150\n\nTherefore, there are 150 economy cars and 100 luxury cars.\n\nTo find the total number of cars, add E and L together:\n\nTotal cars = E + L = 150 + 100 = 250\n\nLet\u2019s double-check to make sure this makes sense.\n\nIf there are 150 economy cars and 100 luxury cars, the ratio is 150:100, which simplifies to 3:2, matching the given ratio.\n\nAlso, 150 is indeed 50 more than 100, so that condition is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the company has a total of 250 cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{250} \\]"
