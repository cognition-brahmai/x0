Astrophysics, a branch of astronomy, uses the principles of physics to explain these observations. For instance, the study of starlight allows astrophysicists to determine a star's composition, temperature, and velocity. Observational techniques, such as spectroscopy, are crucial tools in this process, enabling scientists to analyze the light emitted or absorbed by celestial bodies.\nBased on the information provided, what is the primary purpose of spectroscopy in astronomy?\nA. To visually observe celestial bodies.\nB. To measure the distance between stars.\nC. To analyze the light emitted or absorbed by celestial bodies.\nD. To predict the future positions of celestial bodies.\nE. None of the above."

So, the correct answer is C.\n\nSpectroscopy is a fundamental tool in astronomy and astrophysics because it allows scientists to gather detailed information about celestial objects without directly observing them. By analyzing the spectrum of light from a star, for example, astronomers can determine its chemical composition, temperature, density, mass, distance, luminosity, and velocity. This is possible because different elements absorb and emit light at specific wavelengths, creating a unique spectral fingerprint.\n\nFor instance, when light passes through a prism, it separates into its component colors, forming a spectrum. In spectroscopy, this spectrum is analyzed to identify the presence of specific elements or to understand the physical conditions of the light source or the medium through which the light has traveled.\n\nSo, to summarize, spectroscopy is crucial in astronomy because it provides a way to study the properties of celestial bodies by examining their light."
