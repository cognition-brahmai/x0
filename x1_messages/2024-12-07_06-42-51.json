        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. To create a simple web server in Go that serves static files and has a specific route to return the current server time in JSON format, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up your Go environment**: Make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).\n\n2. **Create a new Go file**: Let's name it `main.go`.\n\n3. **Import necessary packages**: You'll need `net/http` for the web server and `time` to get the current time.\n\n4. **Define the static file server**: Use `http.FileServer` to serve files from a specified directory.\n\n5. **Create a handler for the time route**: This handler will respond with the current time in JSON format.\n\n6. **Set up the routes**: Map the static file server to a specific path and the time handler to another path.\n\n7. **Start the server**: Listen on port 8080.\n\nHere's a sample code that accomplishes this:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"encoding/json\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Serve static files from the \"static\" directory\n\tfs := http.FileServer(http.Dir(\"static\"))\n\thttp.Handle(\"/\", fs)\n\n\t// Handle GET requests to /time\n\thttp.HandleFunc(\"/time\", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\t\tif r.Method == \"GET\" {\n\t\t\tcurrentTime := time.Now().Format(time.RFC3339)\n\t\t\tresponse := map[string]string{\"time\": currentTime}\n\t\t\tjsonResponse, err := json.Marshal(response)\n\t\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\t\thttp.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)\n\t\t\t\treturn\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tw.Header().Set(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n\t\t\tw.Write(jsonResponse)\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\thttp.Error(w, \"Method not allowed\", http.StatusMethodNotAllowed)\n\t\t}\n\t})\n\n\t// Start the server on port 8080\n\terr := http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Static File Server**:\n   - `http.FileServer(http.Dir(\"static\"))` creates a handler that serves files from the `static` directory.\n   - `http.Handle(\"/\", fs)` maps this handler to the root URL `/`, so any request to the root or subpaths will serve files from the `static` directory.\n\n2. **Time Route Handler**:\n   - `http.HandleFunc(\"/time\", handler)` sets up a handler for the `/time` endpoint.\n   - Inside the handler, check if the request method is GET.\n   - Get the current time formatted as RFC3339.\n   - Create a map with the time and marshal it into JSON.\n   - Set the response content type to `application/json` and write the JSON response.\n\n3. **Starting the Server**:\n   - `http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil)` starts the server on port 8080.\n\n### Steps to Run:\n\n1. **Create a `static` directory**: Place your static files (like HTML, CSS, JS) in this directory.\n\n2. **Save the above code in `main.go`**.\n\n3. **Run the server**:\n   ```sh\n   go run main.go\n   ```\n\n4. **Access the server**:\n   - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to see your static files.\n   - Go to `http://localhost:8080/time` to see the current server time in JSON format.\n\nThis setup provides a basic web server in Go that serves static files and has a simple API endpoint to get the current time.
