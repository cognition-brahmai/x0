        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the bakery sells 4 loaves of bread every 15 minutes, and we need to find out how many loaves they sell in 2 hours. First, I need to understand the relationship between time and the number of loaves sold.\n\nOkay, so 15 minutes is a quarter of an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 60 divided by 15 is 4. That means there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour. Since the bakery sells 4 loaves in each 15-minute interval, in one hour, they would sell 4 loaves multiplied by 4 intervals, which is 16 loaves.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many loaves are sold in 2 hours. If in one hour they sell 16 loaves, then in 2 hours, it should be 16 loaves multiplied by 2, which equals 32 loaves.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. For example, instead of calculating per hour and then multiplying by 2, I could calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in 2 hours directly.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 120 minutes. If each interval is 15 minutes, then the number of intervals in 120 minutes is 120 divided by 15, which is 8 intervals. Since they sell 4 loaves per interval, total loaves sold in 2 hours would be 4 loaves times 8 intervals, which is also 32 loaves.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. But let's consider if there could be any other factors affecting the sales. For example, maybe the bakery has different sales rates during peak times or if they have limited stock.\n\nBut based on the information given, there's no mention of varying sales rates or limited stock, so I'll assume that the sales rate is constant throughout the 2 hours.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the rate of loaves sold per minute and then multiply by the total number of minutes in 2 hours.\n\nSo, 4 loaves in 15 minutes mean that the rate is 4 loaves divided by 15 minutes, which is approximately 0.2667 loaves per minute.\n\nThen, in 2 hours, which is 120 minutes, the total loaves sold would be 0.2667 loaves per minute times 120 minutes, which equals 32 loaves.\n\nAgain, the same answer. It seems consistent across different methods.\n\nLet me consider if the question might be trying to trick me or if there's any ambiguity in the wording.\n\nThe question says \"sells 4 loaves of bread every 15 minutes,\" which is clear, and \"how many loaves would they sell in 2 hours,\" which is also straightforward. There doesn't seem to be any trick here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bakery can't sell more than a certain number due to stock limitations, but again, the question doesn't mention any constraints.\n\nSo, based on the information provided and the consistent results from different calculation methods, I'm confident that the bakery would sell 32 loaves in 2 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]"
