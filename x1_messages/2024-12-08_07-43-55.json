        "content": "So, the car rental company has 200 cars in total, and they've rented out 60% of them. I need to find out how many cars are still available for rent.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many cars have been rented out. If they have 200 cars and 60% are rented, I can calculate the number of rented cars by multiplying 200 by 60%.\n\nBut, I need to remember that 60% is the same as 0.6 in decimal form. So, 200 multiplied by 0.6 should give me the number of rented cars.\n\nLet me do that: 200 times 0.6 is 120. So, 120 cars have been rented out.\n\nNow, to find out how many cars are still available, I need to subtract the number of rented cars from the total number of cars.\n\nThat is, 200 minus 120.\n\nSo, 200 minus 120 equals 80.\n\nTherefore, there are 80 cars still available for rent.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe instead of finding 60% and then subtracting, I can find out what percentage of cars are still available.\n\nIf 60% are rented, then 100% minus 60% equals 40% are still available.\n\nSo, 40% of 200 should also give me the number of cars available for rent.\n\nLet me calculate that to double-check.\n\n40% of 200 is 0.4 times 200, which is 80.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, definitely, there are 80 cars available for rent.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about it in fractions.\n\n60% is equivalent to 3/5, since 60 divided by 20 is 3, and 100 divided by 20 is 5.\n\nSo, 3/5 of the cars are rented.\n\nTherefore, 3/5 of 200 is (3/5)*200 = (3*200)/5 = 600/5 = 120, which again confirms that 120 cars are rented.\n\nThen, 200 minus 120 is indeed 80.\n\nAlternatively, if 40% are available, and 40% is 2/5 (since 40 divided by 20 is 2 and 100 divided by 20 is 5), then 2/5 of 200 is (2/5)*200 = (2*200)/5 = 400/5 = 80.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer is definitely 80 cars available for rent.\n\nIt's always good to check your work multiple ways to make sure you're correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
