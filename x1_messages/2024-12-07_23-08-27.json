        "content": "So, let's see. There are about 7.9 billion people on Earth, and each person has two hands with five fingers on each hand. I need to find out how many total fingers all these people have.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many fingers one person has. Since each person has two hands and each hand has five fingers, that means one person has 2 hands \u00d7 5 fingers per hand = 10 fingers.\n\nNow, if one person has 10 fingers, then for 7.9 billion people, I just need to multiply 7.9 billion by 10.\n\nBut wait, 7.9 billion is a big number. To make sure I'm doing this correctly, maybe I should write it out. 7.9 billion is 7,900,000,000.\n\nSo, 7,900,000,000 people \u00d7 10 fingers per person.\n\nMultiplying that out, it's 79,000,000,000 fingers.\n\nThat seems straightforward. But just to be thorough, maybe I should check my calculations again.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n- Each person has 2 hands.\n\n- Each hand has 5 fingers.\n\n- Therefore, fingers per person = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10.\n\n- Total people = 7,900,000,000.\n\n- Total fingers = 7,900,000,000 \u00d7 10 = 79,000,000,000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of exponents to make it easier. Billion is 10^9, so 7.9 billion is 7.9 \u00d7 10^9.\n\nThen, total fingers = 7.9 \u00d7 10^9 people \u00d7 10 fingers/person.\n\nMultiplying that, it's 7.9 \u00d7 10^10 fingers.\n\nAnd 10^10 is 10 billion, so 7.9 \u00d7 10 billion is 79 billion.\n\nSo, 79 billion fingers in total.\n\nWait a minute, but I know that some people might have fewer than five fingers on a hand due to accidents or birth defects. Does that mean the total would be less than 79 billion?\n\nHmm, the question says \"each person has two hands with five fingers on each hand,\" so perhaps it's assuming that everyone has the full complement of fingers.\n\nBut in reality, not everyone does. So, if we're going by actual numbers, the total might be slightly less.\n\nHowever, since the question specifies \"each person has two hands with five fingers on each hand,\" I think it's safe to assume that everyone has 10 fingers.\n\nSo, the total number of fingers is 79 billion.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any people who have more than five fingers on a hand, like polydactylism, where someone is born with extra fingers.\n\nIf that's the case, then the total would be higher.\n\nBut again, the question specifies \"five fingers on each hand,\" so perhaps it's assuming that no one has extra fingers.\n\nTherefore, sticking with the given information, the total number of fingers is 79 billion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that some people wear prosthetic fingers or have implants, but I think that's getting too complicated.\n\nThe question seems straightforward: given that each person has two hands with five fingers on each hand, calculate the total number of fingers for 7.9 billion people.\n\nSo, 7.9 billion people \u00d7 10 fingers per person = 79 billion fingers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 79,000,000,000 fingers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{79,000,000,000} \\]"
