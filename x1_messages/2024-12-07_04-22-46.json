        "content": "Let's see, I need to find the sum of all prime numbers between 10 and 50. First, I should list out all the prime numbers in that range. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n\nStarting from 11, which is a prime number, then 13 is also prime. Next is 17, that's prime too. Then 19, that's prime. Now, 23, that's prime. 29 is prime. 31 is prime. 37 is prime. 41 is prime. 43 is prime. And finally, 47 is prime.\n\nSo, the prime numbers between 10 and 50 are: 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47.\n\nNow, I need to add them all up. Let's do this step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\nFirst, add 11 and 13: 11 + 13 = 24.\n\nThen, add 17: 24 + 17 = 41.\n\nNext, add 19: 41 + 19 = 60.\n\nThen, add 23: 60 + 23 = 83.\n\nAdd 29: 83 + 29 = 112.\n\nAdd 31: 112 + 31 = 143.\n\nAdd 37: 143 + 37 = 180.\n\nAdd 41: 180 + 41 = 221.\n\nAdd 43: 221 + 43 = 264.\n\nFinally, add 47: 264 + 47 = 311.\n\nSo, the sum of all prime numbers between 10 and 50 is 311.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{311} \\]"
