        "content": "Given that the study of Spanish involves understanding gender agreement, where nouns and their corresponding adjectives must agree in gender and number, and that studying literature provides insights into culture and history, what is likely to be a challenge for an English speaker learning Spanish?\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA. Understanding the concept of verb tenses.\n\nEnglish has verb tenses, so English speakers are already familiar with the concept of changing verb forms to indicate time. While Spanish verb conjugations might be more complex with more variations, the basic concept is similar to English. Therefore, understanding the concept might not be as challenging as mastering the specifics.\n\nB. Mastering the pronunciation of Spanish words.\n\nPronunciation can be challenging due to differences in phonetics between English and Spanish. Spanish has a more phonetic spelling, but sounds like the rolled 'r' or the pronunciation of 'j' as 'h' might be difficult for English speakers. However, pronunciation, while important, might not be the primary grammatical challenge.\n\nC. Learning the Spanish alphabet.\n\nThe Spanish alphabet is similar to the English one, with only a few additional letters like '\u00f1' and letters with diacritics like '\u00e1', '\u00e9', etc. While there might be some initial confusion, it's generally not a major hurdle for English speakers.\n\nD. Grasping the concept of gender agreement.\n\nIn English, nouns do not have gender, whereas in Spanish, almost all nouns are either masculine or feminine. This requires English speakers to memorize the gender for each noun and ensure that adjectives agree in gender and number. This is a fundamental aspect of Spanish grammar that doesn't exist in English, making it a significant challenge.\n\nConsidering these points, option D, grasping the concept of gender agreement, is likely to be a notable challenge for English speakers learning Spanish.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
