        "content": "So you're asking about the probability of getting heads three times in a row when flipping a coin. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand that each coin flip is an independent event. That means the outcome of one flip doesn't affect the outcomes of the others. For a fair coin, the probability of getting heads (H) on a single flip is 1/2, and the same goes for tails (T).\n\nNow, when you flip the coin three times, you're looking for the specific sequence H-H-H. Since each flip is independent, you can find the total probability by multiplying the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, the probability of getting heads on the first flip is 1/2.\n\nThe probability of getting heads on the second flip is also 1/2.\n\nAnd the probability of getting heads on the third flip is again 1/2.\n\nTo find the probability of all three events happening together, you multiply these probabilities:\n\nProbability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8\n\nSo, the probability of getting heads all three times is 1/8, or 0.125, which is the same as 12.5%.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider all possible outcomes when flipping a coin three times. Each flip has 2 possible outcomes (H or T), so for three flips, there are 2^3 = 8 possible sequences:\n\n1. H-H-H\n\n2. H-H-T\n\n3. H-T-H\n\n4. H-T-T\n\n5. T-H-H\n\n6. T-H-T\n\n7. T-T-H\n\n8. T-T-T\n\nOnly one of these eight sequences is H-H-H, so again, the probability is 1 out of 8, or 1/8.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the probability would be the same for any other specific sequence, like T-H-T or H-T-H, because each sequence is equally likely.\n\nI hope this helps clarify how to calculate the probability for multiple independent events like coin flips. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!"
