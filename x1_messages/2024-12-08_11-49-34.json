        "content": "So I've got this problem here about optimizing housekeeping operations for a hotel chain. They want to implement a new scheduling system, and they've given me some data to work with. Let's see what they've provided:\n\n- There are 10 hotels in the chain.\n\n- Each hotel has 200 rooms.\n\n- On average, 70% of the rooms are occupied daily.\n\n- Each room requires 30 minutes of cleaning time.\n\nThey're asking me to calculate the total number of housekeeping hours required per day across all hotels, and then estimate the number of full-time housekeepers needed if each works an 8-hour shift.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many rooms are occupied on average each day across all hotels.\n\nEach hotel has 200 rooms, and 70% of them are occupied daily. So, the number of occupied rooms per hotel per day is:\n\n200 rooms * 70% = 200 * 0.7 = 140 rooms\n\nSince there are 10 hotels, the total number of occupied rooms across all hotels per day is:\n\n140 rooms/hotel * 10 hotels = 1400 rooms\n\nNow, each occupied room requires 30 minutes of cleaning time. So, the total cleaning time required per day is:\n\n1400 rooms * 30 minutes/room = 42,000 minutes\n\nBut since we want the total in hours, we need to convert minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\n42,000 minutes \u00f7 60 = 700 hours\n\nSo, the total number of housekeeping hours required per day across all hotels is 700 hours.\n\nNext, I need to estimate the number of full-time housekeepers needed. Each housekeeper works an 8-hour shift.\n\nTo find out how many housekeepers are needed, I'll divide the total housekeeping hours required by the number of hours each housekeeper works per day:\n\n700 hours \u00f7 8 hours/housekeeper = 87.5 housekeepers\n\nSince you can't have half a housekeeper, you'd need to round up to the next whole number. So, they would need 88 full-time housekeepers.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe I should consider whether housekeepers can work in shifts or if there are multiple shifts per day. The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume that all housekeeping is done during one shift per day.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are multiple shifts. For example, if there are two shifts per day, then the number of housekeepers needed per shift would be half.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't mention multiple shifts, I'll stick with the initial calculation of 88 full-time housekeepers.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, number of occupied rooms per hotel: 200 * 0.7 = 140 rooms.\n\nTotal occupied rooms across 10 hotels: 140 * 10 = 1400 rooms.\n\nTotal cleaning time: 1400 rooms * 30 minutes = 42,000 minutes.\n\nConvert minutes to hours: 42,000 \u00f7 60 = 700 hours.\n\nNumber of housekeepers: 700 hours \u00f7 8 hours per housekeeper = 87.5, rounded up to 88.\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that some rooms may need less or more cleaning time, but since it's an average of 30 minutes per room, I think using that average is fine.\n\nAlso, assuming that all cleaning is done in one shift per day.\n\nSo, my final answer is that the hotel chain needs approximately 88 full-time housekeepers working 8-hour shifts to cover the daily cleaning requirements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{88} \\]"
