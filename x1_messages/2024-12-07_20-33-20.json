First, I need to simplify the equation as much as possible before solving for x.\n\nStarting with 4(2x - 3) + 6 = 10. I see that there's a 4 multiplied by the parentheses, so I should probably distribute that 4 into the terms inside the parentheses. That means I'll multiply 4 by 2x and then 4 by -3.\n\nSo, 4 times 2x is 8x, and 4 times -3 is -12. So, after distributing, the equation becomes:\n\n8x - 12 + 6 = 10.\n\nNext, I can combine like terms. There are constants -12 and +6 that can be combined.\n\n-12 + 6 equals -6. So now the equation is:\n\n8x - 6 = 10.\n\nAlright, now I need to isolate the term with x. To do that, I can add 6 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -6 on the left side.\n\nSo, adding 6 to both sides:\n\n8x - 6 + 6 = 10 + 6.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n8x = 16.\n\nNow, to solve for x, I need to divide both sides by 8.\n\nSo, 8x / 8 = 16 / 8.\n\nThis gives me:\n\nx = 2.\n\nOkay, let me just double-check that. I'll plug x = 2 back into the original equation to make sure it holds true.\n\nStarting with 4(2x - 3) + 6 = 10.\n\nPlug in x = 2:\n\n4(2*2 - 3) + 6 = 4(4 - 3) + 6 = 4(1) + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10.\n\nYes, it checks out. So, the solution is x = 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
