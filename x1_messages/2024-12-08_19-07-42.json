        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a car rental company. They charge a flat fee of $20 for renting a car, and then an additional $0.15 for every mile you drive. The question is asking how much it would cost to rent the car and drive it for 200 miles.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. There are two parts to the cost:\n\n1. The flat fee: This is a fixed amount you have to pay just for renting the car, regardless of how many miles you drive. In this case, it's $20.\n\n2. The per-mile charge: This is an additional cost that depends on how many miles you drive. It's $0.15 per mile.\n\nSo, to find the total cost, I need to add the flat fee to the cost of driving 200 miles.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost for the miles driven. The charge is $0.15 per mile, and you're driving 200 miles. So, I'll multiply 0.15 by 200.\n\n0.15 \u00d7 200 = ?\n\nWell, 0.15 is the same as 15 cents. So, 15 cents per mile for 200 miles would be:\n\n0.15 \u00d7 200 = 30\n\nSo, the cost for the miles driven is $30.\n\nNow, I need to add that to the flat fee of $20.\n\nTotal cost = flat fee + mileage cost\n\nTotal cost = 20 + 30 = 50\n\nTherefore, the total cost to rent the car and drive it for 200 miles would be $50.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach it differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to think of it as a linear equation, where the total cost (C) is a function of the miles driven (m).\n\nThe general form would be:\n\nC = flat fee + (cost per mile) \u00d7 m\n\nIn this case:\n\nC = 20 + 0.15 \u00d7 m\n\nAnd m = 200 miles.\n\nPlugging in the value:\n\nC = 20 + 0.15 \u00d7 200\n\nC = 20 + 30\n\nC = 50\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of units to make sure I'm doing the right operations.\n\nThe flat fee is in dollars: $20\n\nThe per-mile charge is in dollars per mile: $0.15/mile\n\nThe miles driven are in miles: 200 miles\n\nSo, the cost for miles is ($0.15/mile) \u00d7 200 miles = $30\n\nThen, total cost is $20 + $30 = $50\n\nEverything seems consistent.\n\nI can also consider if there are any other fees or factors that might affect the total cost, but according to the problem, there are only two components: the flat fee and the per-mile charge. So, I don't think there's anything else to consider.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's think about real-world implications. Sometimes, car rental companies have additional fees like taxes, insurance, etc. But in this problem, it's clearly stated that there's only a flat fee and a per-mile charge. So, I don't need to worry about additional factors.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the per-mile charge is for each mile over a certain threshold, or if it's for every mile driven. In this case, it says \"plus an additional $0.15 per mile driven,\" so it's for every mile driven, without any initial free miles.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm using the correct units. The problem gives the flat fee in dollars and the per-mile charge in dollars per mile, and the miles are given in miles, so the units are consistent and compatible for calculation.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The calculation seems straightforward, and both methods I used give me the same answer.\n\nSo, the final answer is $50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
