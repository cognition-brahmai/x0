He wasn't always brave, but he found the strength within himself to keep going, even when things looked really dark.\n\nI think courage is about doing what you think is right, even when it's hard or scary. For Harry, that meant standing up to Voldemort and his Death Eaters, even when he was just a kid. For us, it might be standing up for what we believe in, or trying something new even if we're afraid of failing.\n\nRemember, Harry had friends like Ron and Hermione who supported him and helped him find his courage. Sometimes, all it takes is having someone believe in you to give you the strength to keep going.\n\nSo, if you're looking for courage, maybe think about what's really important to you, and remember that it's okay to be scared \u2013 even the bravest people are scared sometimes. But what makes them brave is that they keep going anyway.\n\nJust like Harry did."
