        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a fair six-sided die being rolled three times, and we want to find the probability that at least one of those rolls shows a 4.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand what \"at least one\" means in probability. It means one or more. So, we're looking for the probability of getting a 4 on one roll, or two rolls, or all three rolls.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the complementary event. The complementary event of \"at least one 4\" is \"no 4s at all\" in the three rolls. Calculating the probability of the complementary event can sometimes be easier, and then we can subtract that probability from 1 to get the probability of the original event.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\n- P(at least one 4) = 1 - P(no 4s in three rolls)\n\nNow, let's find P(no 4s in three rolls).\n\nSince the die is fair, each roll is independent of the others, and the probability of not rolling a 4 on a single roll is 5/6 (because there are five other outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6).\n\nBecause the rolls are independent, the probability of not rolling a 4 in all three rolls is the product of the probabilities of not rolling a 4 on each individual roll.\n\nTherefore:\n\nP(no 4s in three rolls) = (5/6) \u00d7 (5/6) \u00d7 (5/6) = (5/6)^3\n\nCalculating that:\n\n(5/6)^3 = 125 / 216\n\nNow, P(at least one 4) = 1 - 125/216 = (216 - 125) / 216 = 91 / 216\n\nSo, the probability is 91/216.\n\nAlternatively, we could calculate this directly by finding the probability of getting exactly one 4, exactly two 4s, and exactly three 4s, and then summing those probabilities.\n\nThe formula for the probability of exactly k successes (rolling a 4) in n trials (rolls) is given by the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time, also written as nCk or \"n choose k\"\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial (rolling a 4), which is 1/6\n\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (not rolling a 4), which is 5/6\n\n- n is the number of trials (3 rolls)\n\n- k is the number of successes (1, 2, or 3 rolls showing a 4)\n\nSo, P(at least one 4) = P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X=3)\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n\nP(X=1) = C(3,1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^2\n\nP(X=2) = C(3,2) * (1/6)^2 * (5/6)^1\n\nP(X=3) = C(3,3) * (1/6)^3 * (5/6)^0\n\nFirst, calculate the combinations:\n\nC(3,1) = 3\n\nC(3,2) = 3\n\nC(3,3) = 1\n\nNow, calculate each probability:\n\nP(X=1) = 3 * (1/6) * (25/36) = 3 * (1/6) * (25/36) = 3 * (25/216) = 75/216\n\nP(X=2) = 3 * (1/36) * (5/6) = 3 * (5/216) = 15/216\n\nP(X=3) = 1 * (1/216) * 1 = 1/216\n\nNow, sum them up:\n\nP(at least one 4) = 75/216 + 15/216 + 1/216 = 91/216\n\nWhich matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, the probability is 91/216, which can also be expressed as a decimal or a percentage if needed. To convert it to a decimal:\n\n91 \u00f7 216 \u2248 0.4213\n\nAnd to a percentage:\n\n0.4213 \u00d7 100 \u2248 42.13%\n\nTherefore, there's approximately a 42.13% chance of rolling at least one 4 when rolling a fair six-sided die three times.\n\nIt's worth noting that this approach using the complementary event is often simpler and less error-prone, especially when dealing with \"at least one\" scenarios, because it reduces the number of calculations needed.\n\nAlso, this problem is a classic example of the binomial distribution, which is used to find the probability of a certain number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success.\n\nIn summary, the probability of rolling at least one 4 in three rolls of a fair six-sided die is 91/216, or approximately 42.13%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{91}{216}} \\]"
