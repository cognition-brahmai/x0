        "content": "Let's calculate the total revenue from sandwich sales for the restaurant. They sell two types of sandwiches: turkey and ham. The turkey sandwich costs $6.50, and they sold 35 of them. The ham sandwich costs $5.25, and they sold 45 of them.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the revenue from turkey sandwiches. That would be the number of turkey sandwiches sold multiplied by the price per turkey sandwich. So, 35 sandwiches at $6.50 each.\n\nSimilarly, for ham sandwiches, it's 45 sandwiches at $5.25 each.\n\nThen, I'll add both amounts to get the total revenue.\n\nLet me do the math.\n\nFor turkey sandwiches:\n\n35 \u00d7 6.50 = ?\n\nI can calculate 35 \u00d7 6 = 210, and 35 \u00d7 0.50 = 17.50. So, 210 + 17.50 = 227.50.\n\nFor ham sandwiches:\n\n45 \u00d7 5.25 = ?\n\n45 \u00d7 5 = 225, and 45 \u00d7 0.25 = 11.25. So, 225 + 11.25 = 236.25.\n\nNow, adding both revenues:\n\n227.50 + 236.25 = ?\n\n227.50 + 236.25 = 463.75.\n\nSo, the total revenue from sandwich sales for that day is $463.75.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{463.75} \\]"
