        "content": "I've got this problem here: If there's a 25% chance of winning a game, what's the probability that I'll win at least once in four attempts? Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, a 25% chance of winning means that for each game I play, there's a 1 in 4 chance that I'll win. So, the probability of winning a single game is 0.25.\n\nNow, I need to find out the probability of winning at least once in four attempts. \"At least once\" means that I could win once, twice, three times, or even all four times. Calculating each of these probabilities separately would be pretty tedious, especially since there are multiple ways to win multiple games.\n\nThere has to be a smarter way to approach this. Hmm.\n\nWait a minute, probability has some useful rules that can simplify this. One thing I remember is that the probability of an event happening at least once is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not happening at all.\n\nSo, in this case, the probability of winning at least once in four attempts is equal to 1 minus the probability of not winning any of the four attempts.\n\nThat makes sense. Let's denote:\n\n- P(win at least once) = 1 - P(lose all four attempts)\n\nAlright, now I need to find P(lose all four attempts).\n\nSince each game is independent (I assume), the probability of losing all four games is the product of the probabilities of losing each individual game.\n\nThe probability of losing a single game is 1 - P(win) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75.\n\nTherefore, P(lose all four attempts) = 0.75 ^ 4.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n0.75 ^ 4 = 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75.\n\nFirst, 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625.\n\nThen, 0.5625 * 0.75 = 0.421875.\n\nFinally, 0.421875 * 0.75 = 0.31640625.\n\nSo, P(lose all four attempts) = 0.31640625.\n\nTherefore, P(win at least once) = 1 - 0.31640625 = 0.68359375.\n\nThat's the probability of winning at least once in four attempts.\n\nBut maybe I should double-check this approach. Is there another way to confirm this result?\n\nAnother way to calculate P(win at least once) is to calculate the sum of the probabilities of winning exactly once, exactly twice, exactly three times, and exactly four times.\n\nThis would involve using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(k wins in n attempts) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- C(n,k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\n- p is the probability of winning a single game.\n\n- n is the number of attempts.\n\n- k is the number of wins.\n\nSo, P(win at least once) = P(k=1) + P(k=2) + P(k=3) + P(k=4)\n\nLet's calculate each term.\n\nFirst, P(k=1):\n\nC(4,1) * 0.25^1 * 0.75^(4-1) = 4 * 0.25 * 0.75^3\n\nCalculate 0.75^3 = 0.421875\n\nSo, 4 * 0.25 * 0.421875 = 4 * 0.10546875 = 0.421875\n\nNext, P(k=2):\n\nC(4,2) * 0.25^2 * 0.75^2 = 6 * 0.0625 * 0.5625 = 6 * 0.03515625 = 0.2109375\n\nThen, P(k=3):\n\nC(4,3) * 0.25^3 * 0.75^1 = 4 * 0.015625 * 0.75 = 4 * 0.01171875 = 0.046875\n\nFinally, P(k=4):\n\nC(4,4) * 0.25^4 * 0.75^0 = 1 * 0.00390625 * 1 = 0.00390625\n\nNow, sum them up:\n\n0.421875 + 0.2109375 + 0.046875 + 0.00390625 = 0.68359375\n\nLook at that! It's the same result I got earlier: 0.68359375.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the probability of winning at least once in four attempts is 0.68359375, or approximately 68.36%.\n\nIs there another way to look at this?\n\nPerhaps using the concept of geometric distribution, which deals with the number of trials needed to get the first success in a sequence of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm interested in at least one win in four attempts, the approach I used earlier seems more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the cumulative distribution function of the binomial distribution, which gives the probability of getting at most k successes in n trials.\n\nBut since I'm looking for at least one success, it's easier to calculate 1 - P(k=0), which is what I did initially.\n\nWait, actually, in my earlier calculation, P(lose all four attempts) is P(k=0), which is 0.31640625, and 1 - P(k=0) = P(k>=1) = 0.68359375.\n\nSo, yes, that checks out.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see how this probability changes with more attempts.\n\nFor example, what if I have five attempts? What's the probability of winning at least once then?\n\nUsing the same logic:\n\nP(win at least once in five attempts) = 1 - P(lose all five attempts) = 1 - 0.75^5\n\nCalculate 0.75^5:\n\n0.75 * 0.75^4 = 0.75 * 0.31640625 = 0.2373046875\n\nSo, P(win at least once in five attempts) = 1 - 0.2373046875 = 0.7626953125, or about 76.27%.\n\nInteresting, the probability increases as the number of attempts increases, which makes sense.\n\nComing back to the original problem, with four attempts and a 25% chance of winning each time, the probability of winning at least once is approximately 68.36%.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.6836} \\]"
