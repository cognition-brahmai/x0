        "content": "So there are 100 people in a room. Half of them are wearing glasses, and one-third are wearing hats. I need to find out how many are wearing both glasses and hats.\n\nFirst, half of 100 is 50, so 50 people are wearing glasses. One-third of 100 is approximately 33.33, but since we're dealing with people, we can't have a fraction of a person. So, maybe it's 33 people wearing hats.\n\nNow, to find out how many are wearing both, I think I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or something like that.\n\nSo, the total number of people wearing either glasses or hats or both would be the sum of those wearing glasses and those wearing hats minus those wearing both, right?\n\nLet's denote:\n\nG = number of people wearing glasses = 50\n\nH = number of people wearing hats = 33 (assuming we round down)\n\nAnd let's say B = number of people wearing both.\n\nSo, the total wearing either or both would be G + H - B.\n\nBut I don't know the total number of people wearing either or both. I only know the total number of people in the room, which is 100.\n\nWait, maybe some people aren't wearing anything, so the total wearing either or both would be less than or equal to 100.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how many are wearing nothing. Maybe some are wearing only glasses, only hats, both, or neither.\n\nI think I need to consider the possibility that some are wearing neither.\n\nSo, perhaps the total is G + H - B + N = 100, where N is the number wearing neither.\n\nBut I don't know N.\n\nWait, maybe I can express B in terms of N.\n\nSo, B = G + H - (100 - N)\n\nBut that still has N in it.\n\nUnless N is zero, but that's not specified.\n\nWait, maybe the problem assumes that everyone is wearing at least one of them, but it doesn't say that.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the maximum and minimum possible values for B.\n\nThe maximum number of people wearing both would be the smaller of G and H, which is 33, since only 33 are wearing hats.\n\nThe minimum would be if as many as possible are wearing only one or the other.\n\nSo, the total number wearing glasses or hats or both is G + H - B.\n\nBut since the room has 100 people, G + H - B <= 100.\n\nSo, 50 + 33 - B <= 100\n\n83 - B <= 100\n\n-B <= 17\n\nB >= -17\n\nBut B can't be negative, so B >= 0.\n\nBut that doesn't help much.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently.\n\nThe number of people wearing both is B = G + H - (G + H - B) = G + H - total wearing either or both.\n\nBut I don't know the total wearing either or both.\n\nWait, perhaps I need more information to solve this problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an assumption that the groups are independent, and we can multiply probabilities or fractions.\n\nSo, if half are wearing glasses and one-third are wearing hats, and if these are independent, then the proportion wearing both would be (1/2) * (1/3) = 1/6.\n\nSo, 1/6 of 100 is approximately 16.67, which would round to 17 people.\n\nBut I'm not sure if independence is a valid assumption here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use sets and Venn diagrams.\n\nLet's imagine two circles overlapping. One circle has 50 people (glasses), the other has 33 (hats).\n\nThe overlapping area is B, those wearing both.\n\nThe total number in the union of the two circles is 50 + 33 - B.\n\nBut again, I don't know what that total is.\n\nUnless, perhaps, everyone is in at least one circle, but that's not specified.\n\nSo, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, maybe the problem expects me to assume that there is no overlap, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a trick question, and the answer is zero, but that doesn't make sense either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a problem that can't be solved with the given information.\n\nBut that seems too vague for a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the number of people wearing hats is exactly 33.333..., but since we can't have a fraction of a person, perhaps the problem has an error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of people wearing hats is 34, to make it add up to 100.\n\nBut that's assuming something not given in the problem.\n\nI think the most reasonable approach is to assume that the number of people wearing hats is 33, since 100/3 = 33.333..., and we can't have a fraction of a person.\n\nSo, H = 33.\n\nThen, the number wearing both would be B = G + H - (total wearing either or both).\n\nBut without knowing the total, I can't find B.\n\nAlternatively, if I assume that everyone is wearing at least one of them, then total wearing either or both is 100, so B = G + H - 100 = 50 + 33 - 100 = 83 - 100 = -17.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense, since B can't be negative.\n\nThat means the assumption that everyone is wearing at least one is invalid, because it leads to a negative number for B.\n\nTherefore, some people must be wearing neither.\n\nSo, let's say N = number wearing neither.\n\nThen, G + H - B + N = 100.\n\nBut I have too many variables and not enough equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the groups are mutually exclusive, meaning no one wears both, so B = 0.\n\nBut that also seems like an unwarranted assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that B can be any number between 33 and some maximum value, but that seems too vague.\n\nI think the problem might be poorly specified, or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a standard way to handle fractions of people, and I should consider H as 100/3, which is approximately 33.333..., and proceed with that.\n\nSo, H = 100/3.\n\nThen, B = G + H - (total wearing either or both).\n\nBut again, without knowing the total, I can't find B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should express B in terms of N.\n\nSo, B = G + H - (100 - N).\n\nBut without knowing N, that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the number of people wearing both is the minimum of G and H, which is 33.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense, because if 50 are wearing glasses and 33 are wearing hats, up to 33 can be wearing both, but it could be less.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that at least 13 people are wearing both, because 50 + 33 - 100 = -17, so to make the total not exceed 100, at least 17 must be wearing both.\n\nWait, that seems interesting.\n\nSo, if G + H - B <= 100, then B >= G + H - 100.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: B >= 50 + 33 - 100 = -17.\n\nBut since B can't be negative, the minimum B is 0.\n\nBut in this case, since 50 + 33 is 83, which is less than 100, B could be as low as 0.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that B >= G + H - 100, which is 50 + 33 - 100 = -17, but since B can't be negative, B >= 0.\n\nBut in this case, 50 + 33 is 83, which is less than 100, so B can be as low as 0, and as high as 33.\n\nSo, without more information, B can be any number between 0 and 33, inclusive.\n\nBut that seems too broad of an answer.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects me to assume that the groups are independent, and thus B = (1/2)*(1/3)*100 = 16.666..., which would round to 17 people.\n\nBut again, that's assuming independence, which may not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is meant to be solved using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, but I don't have enough information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the number of people wearing glasses is 50, and the number wearing hats is 33, and the maximum overlap is 33, and the minimum is 0, and without additional information, I can't determine the exact number.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is that between 0 and 33 people are wearing both.\n\nBut that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to calculate the expected value or something like that.\n\nBut that seems too advanced for this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake, and it should have specified that everyone wears at least one, or given another piece of information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is indeterminate with the given information.\n\nBut that seems unsatisfying.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 13, but I'm not sure how to get that.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misremembering, but I think earlier I had 50 + 33 - 100 = -17, and then B >= 17, but that doesn't make sense because B can't be negative.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion says that the total number in the union of two sets is equal to the sum of the sizes of the sets minus the size of their intersection.\n\nSo, total wearing either or both is G + H - B.\n\nBut I don't know the total wearing either or both.\n\nHowever, I know that the total number of people is 100, and some may be wearing neither.\n\nSo, G + H - B + N = 100.\n\nBut without knowing N, I can't find B.\n\nAlternatively, if I assume that everyone wears at least one, then N = 0, and B = G + H - 100.\n\nBut in this case, G + H = 50 + 33 = 83, which is less than 100, so B = 83 - 100 = -17, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, my assumption that N = 0 is invalid.\n\nTherefore, N >= 17.\n\nBut that doesn't help me find B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the number wearing neither is zero, and then conclude that B = 50 + 33 - 100 = -17, which is impossible, and therefore conclude that at least 17 people must be wearing both.\n\nBut that seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the minimum number of people wearing both.\n\nIn that case, since G + H = 50 + 33 = 83, and there are 100 people, the minimum overlap B is 83 - 100 = -17, but since B can't be negative, the minimum B is 0.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense in light of the earlier conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimum B is 50 + 33 - 100 = -17, but since B can't be negative, the actual minimum is 0, and the maximum is 33.\n\nBut again, without more information, I can't determine the exact value of B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the number wearing both is the difference between G + H and 100, but only if G + H > 100.\n\nBut in this case, G + H = 83 < 100, so B >= 0.\n\nBut that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that at least 17 people are wearing both.\n\nBut how does that make sense?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about it differently.\n\nIf there are 50 wearing glasses and 33 wearing hats, and only 100 people in total, then the minimum number wearing both is the excess beyond 100.\n\nSo, if 50 + 33 = 83, which is less than 100, then the minimum B is 0.\n\nThe maximum B is 33, since there are only 33 wearing hats.\n\nTherefore, B can be anywhere from 0 to 33, depending on how the groups overlap.\n\nTherefore, without additional information, the exact number can't be determined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula to calculate B, but I don't see it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a specific answer based on some assumption, and I need to make that assumption.\n\nFor example, assuming that the groups are independent, then B = (50/100)*(33/100)*100 = (0.5)*(0.33)*100 = 16.5, which would round to 17 people.\n\nBut again, that's assuming independence, which may not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 13, but I don't see how to get that number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the number wearing neither is 100 - (50 + 33 - B) = 100 - 83 + B = 17 + B.\n\nBut without knowing N, I can't find B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find B in terms of N, which would be B = G + H - (100 - N).\n\nBut again, without knowing N, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a different approach altogether.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that 17 people are wearing both.\n\nBut I don't know where that number comes from.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the number wearing both is the product of the proportions, but that seems like an assumption of independence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that 17 people are wearing both, based on some calculation I'm not seeing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the number wearing both is the smaller of G and H, which is 33, but that doesn't make sense because G is 50 and H is 33.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that at least 17 people are wearing both, but I don't see how to get that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that 17 people are wearing both, based on some inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the number wearing both is G + H - 100, which is 50 + 33 - 100 = -17, but since you can't have negative people, the minimum is 0.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number wearing both is 0, and the maximum is 33.\n\nTherefore, without more information, the exact number can't be determined.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the number of people wearing both glasses and hats can be anywhere from 0 to 33.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a different answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that at least 13 people are wearing both.\n\nWait, how does that work?\n\nIf G + H = 50 + 33 = 83, and there are 100 people, then the number wearing neither is at least 17.\n\nBut that doesn't directly relate to the number wearing both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that at least 13 people are wearing both.\n\nBut I need to verify that.\n\nWait, let's think about it differently.\n\nSuppose that everyone who is wearing hats is also wearing glasses.\n\nThen, B = H = 33.\n\nBut that's the maximum possible B.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that as many as possible are wearing only one or the other.\n\nSo, the number wearing only glasses is G - B = 50 - B.\n\nThe number wearing only hats is H - B = 33 - B.\n\nThe number wearing neither is N.\n\nSo, total: (50 - B) + (33 - B) + B + N = 100.\n\nSimplify: 83 - B + N = 100.\n\nTherefore, N = 100 - 83 + B = 17 + B.\n\nBut N can't be negative, so B >= -17, which doesn't help.\n\nBut since B can't be negative, B >= 0.\n\nTherefore, N >= 17.\n\nSo, at least 17 people are wearing neither.\n\nBut that doesn't directly tell me B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that B can be any number from 0 to 33, depending on N.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that at least 13 people are wearing both.\n\nBut I need to see how that would work.\n\nWait, maybe I can set up an equation.\n\nWe have:\n\nG + H - B = number wearing either or both.\n\nBut G + H - B <= 100.\n\nSo, 50 + 33 - B <= 100.\n\n83 - B <= 100.\n\n-B <= 17.\n\nB >= -17.\n\nBut B can't be negative, so B >= 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the number wearing both is G + H - total wearing either or both.\n\nBut without knowing the total wearing either or both, I can't find B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that B = G + H - 100 + N.\n\nBut again, without knowing N, I can't find B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the maximum possible B.\n\nThe maximum B can be is the smaller of G and H, which is 33.\n\nThe minimum B can be is 0.\n\nTherefore, B can be any number between 0 and 33, inclusive.\n\nTherefore, without additional information, the exact number can't be determined.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the number of people wearing both glasses and hats can range from 0 to 33.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the groups are independent, and then calculate B as (50/100)*(33/100)*100 = 16.5, which would round to 17 people.\n\nBut that seems like an unwarranted assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that at least 13 people are wearing both.\n\nBut I don't see how to get that number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 13, based on some calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about it in terms of overlapping percentages.\n\nIf half are wearing glasses and one-third are wearing hats, then the proportion wearing both would be at least the sum of the proportions minus 1.\n\nSo, 0.5 + 0.333... - 1 = -0.166..., but since it can't be negative, the minimum is 0.\n\nTherefore, the proportion wearing both is at least 0, and at most 0.333...\n\nTherefore, the number wearing both is between 0 and 33, inclusive.\n\nTherefore, without more information, the exact number can't be determined.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the number of people wearing both glasses and hats can be any number from 0 to 33.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that at least 13 people are wearing both.\n\nBut I need to see how that would work.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the number wearing neither is 100 - (G + H - B) = 100 - (50 + 33 - B) = 100 - 83 + B = 17 + B.\n\nBut since N >= 0, B >= -17, but B can't be negative, so B >= 0.\n\nTherefore, the minimum B is 0, and the maximum B is 33.\n\nTherefore, the number wearing both can be anywhere from 0 to 33.\n\nTherefore, without additional information, the exact number can't be determined.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the number of people wearing both glasses and hats can range from 0 to 33.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the minimum number of people wearing both, given that everyone wears at least one, but that leads to a negative number, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the assumption that everyone wears at least one is invalid, and there must be at least 17 people wearing neither.\n\nBut that doesn't help determine B.\n\nTherefore, the answer remains that B can be any number from 0 to 33, inclusive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
