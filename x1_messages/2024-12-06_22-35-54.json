        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train traveling from Town A to Town B at 60 miles per hour, and then it travels back from Town B to Town A at 90 miles per hour, and this return trip takes 3 hours. We need to find out how far apart these two towns are.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basic formula that relates distance, speed, and time. I think it's:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nThat should be useful here.\n\nSo, for the trip from Town A to Town B, the speed is 60 mph, but we don't know the time it takes for that part of the journey. Let's call the distance between Town A and Town B \"D\" miles.\n\nUsing the formula, for the trip to Town B:\n\nD = 60 \u00d7 T1\n\nWhere T1 is the time taken to go from Town A to Town B.\n\nNow, for the return trip from Town B to Town A, the speed is 90 mph, and the time taken is 3 hours.\n\nSo, using the formula again:\n\nD = 90 \u00d7 3\n\nWait a minute, that would give us D = 270 miles directly. But that seems too straightforward, and it doesn't take into account the first part of the trip where the speed is different.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nThe train goes from Town A to Town B at 60 mph, and back from Town B to Town A at 90 mph, taking 3 hours for the return trip.\n\nSo, for the return trip, we can indeed calculate the distance using:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nD = 90 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 270 miles\n\nSo, the distance between Town A and Town B is 270 miles.\n\nBut let me double-check if this makes sense.\n\nIf the train goes from A to B at 60 mph, and the distance is 270 miles, then the time taken for that part would be:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed = 270 miles / 60 mph = 4.5 hours\n\nThen, for the return trip, at 90 mph, time taken is 3 hours, which matches the given information.\n\nSo, the total time for the round trip would be 4.5 hours + 3 hours = 7.5 hours.\n\nBut the question only asked for the distance between the two towns, which is 270 miles.\n\nWait, is there another way to approach this problem, maybe using average speed or something?\n\nLet's see. The average speed for the entire journey would be the total distance divided by the total time.\n\nTotal distance is 2D (going to B and coming back to A), which is 2 \u00d7 270 = 540 miles.\n\nTotal time is 4.5 hours + 3 hours = 7.5 hours.\n\nSo, average speed is 540 miles / 7.5 hours = 72 mph.\n\nBut do we need this for the problem? I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the concept of harmonic mean for the speeds, since the distances are the same but the speeds are different.\n\nThe formula for the average speed over two equal distances is:\n\nAverage speed = (2 \u00d7 Speed1 \u00d7 Speed2) / (Speed1 + Speed2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nAverage speed = (2 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 90) / (60 + 90) = (2 \u00d7 5400) / 150 = 10800 / 150 = 72 mph\n\nWhich matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nBut again, I think that's not necessary for finding the distance between the two towns.\n\nSo, sticking to the initial approach:\n\nD = 90 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 270 miles\n\nAnd verifying that with the trip to Town B:\n\nTime = 270 miles / 60 mph = 4.5 hours\n\nWhich all checks out.\n\nTherefore, the two towns are 270 miles apart.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{270} \\]"
