        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a basketball player has a free throw success rate of 80%, and I need to find out the probability that they'll make exactly 4 out of 5 free throws in a game. Hmm, probability can be a bit tricky, but let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that each free throw is an independent event. That means the outcome of one free throw doesn't affect the others. The player's success rate is 80%, or 0.8, for each individual free throw. So, for each throw, there's a 0.8 chance of making it and a 0.2 chance of missing it.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability of making exactly 4 out of 5 throws. That means the player makes 4 throws and misses 1. The order in which this happens doesn't matter, as long as there are exactly 4 made throws and 1 miss.\n\nThis sounds like a binomial probability problem. The binomial probability formula is:\n\n\\[ P(k) = C(n,k) \\times p^k \\times (1-p)^{n-k} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of trials (in this case, 5 free throws),\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of successes (4 made throws),\n\n- \\( p \\) is the probability of success on a single trial (0.8),\n\n- \\( C(n,k) \\) is the combination of \\( n \\) things taken \\( k \\) at a time.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate \\( C(5,4) \\), which is the number of ways to choose 4 successes out of 5 trials. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[ C(n,k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ C(5,4) = \\frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = \\frac{120}{24 \\times 1) } = \\frac{120}{24} = 5 \\]\n\nSo, there are 5 different ways to make 4 out of 5 free throws.\n\nNext, I need to calculate \\( p^k \\), which is \\( 0.8^4 \\):\n\n\\[ 0.8^4 = 0.8 \\times 0.8 \\times 0.8 \\times 0.8 = 0.4096 \\]\n\nThen, \\( (1-p)^{n-k} \\), which is \\( 0.2^{5-4} = 0.2^1 = 0.2 \\)\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\n\\[ P(4) = 5 \\times 0.4096 \\times 0.2 \\]\n\nFirst, multiply 0.4096 by 0.2:\n\n\\[ 0.4096 \\times 0.2 = 0.08192 \\]\n\nThen multiply by 5:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 0.08192 = 0.4096 \\]\n\nSo, the probability of making exactly 4 out of 5 free throws is 0.4096, or 40.96%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\n- \\( C(5,4) = 5 \\), that seems correct.\n\n- \\( 0.8^4 = 0.4096 \\), that's right.\n\n- \\( 0.2^{5-4} = 0.2 \\), correct.\n\n- Multiplying them together: \\( 5 \\times 0.4096 \\times 0.2 \\)\n\nLet me do that step by step:\n\nFirst, \\( 5 \\times 0.4096 = 2.048 \\)\n\nThen, \\( 2.048 \\times 0.2 = 0.4096 \\)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of permutations. Since there are 5 different positions where the miss can occur, and the rest are made, it's like choosing which one of the 5 throws is the miss.\n\nSo, probability is indeed 5 times the probability of any specific sequence where 4 are made and 1 is missed.\n\nFor example, one sequence is: make, make, make, make, miss.\n\nThe probability of this sequence is \\( 0.8^4 \\times 0.2 \\times 1 = 0.08192 \\)\n\nSince there are 5 such sequences, total probability is \\( 5 \\times 0.08192 = 0.4096 \\)\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the binomial probability formula directly in a calculator or software, but doing it manually helps ensure I understand the process.\n\nSo, the final answer is 0.4096, or 40.96%.\n\nI think that's the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.4096} \\]"
