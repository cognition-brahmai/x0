When it was first built for the 1889 World's Fair, many people didn't like its looks and even criticized its design. But over time, it has become an iconic symbol of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world. It's amazing how something that was initially met with criticism can eventually become so beloved and culturally significant.\n"
