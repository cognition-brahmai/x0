        "content": "Let's tackle this train speed problem. So, the train goes at 60 mph for 2 hours, then slows down to 30 mph for another 3 hours. I need to find the average speed over the entire journey.\n\nFirst, I remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time. That seems straightforward. So, I need to find the total distance the train traveled and the total time it took.\n\nAlright, for the first part, traveling at 60 mph for 2 hours, the distance would be speed times time, so 60 times 2, which is 120 miles. Then, for the second part, at 30 mph for 3 hours, that's 30 times 3, which is 90 miles. So, total distance is 120 plus 90, which is 210 miles.\n\nNow, total time is 2 hours plus 3 hours, which is 5 hours.\n\nSo, average speed is total distance over total time, that's 210 miles over 5 hours, which is 42 mph.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that when speeds are different for different parts of the journey, there might be another way to calculate average speed, maybe using harmonic mean or something like that.\n\nLet me think about that. The harmonic mean is used when dealing with rates, like speeds, but I think in this case, since we have the times for each speed, the total distance over total time method should be correct.\n\nMaybe I should check with another approach to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the weighted average of the speeds, weighted by the time spent at each speed. So, the average speed would be the sum of (speed multiplied by time) for each segment, divided by the total time.\n\nSo, for the first segment: 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 mile-hours\n\nFor the second segment: 30 mph * 3 hours = 90 mile-hours\n\nTotal mile-hours is 120 + 90 = 210 mile-hours\n\nTotal time is 5 hours\n\nSo, average speed is 210 mile-hours / 5 hours = 42 mph\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the distances were equal instead of times. If the train traveled the same distance at two different speeds, then the average speed would be the harmonic mean of the speeds. But in this problem, the times are given, not the distances, so it's correct to use the total distance over total time method.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to mistake this for a problem where distances are equal, I might incorrectly use the harmonic mean. For example, if the train traveled 60 miles at one speed and then 60 miles at another speed, then the average speed would be the harmonic mean of the two speeds. But that's not the case here.\n\nIn this problem, since times are given, total distance over total time is the right approach.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor to consider, like acceleration or stops, but the problem doesn't mention any of that, so I assume the train is moving at the given speeds for the given times without any changes in between.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. Speed is in miles per hour, and time is in hours, so that's fine.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to plot speed against time. If I were to draw a graph, the area under the speed-time graph would give me the total distance. So, a rectangle of 60 mph high and 2 hours wide, giving 120 miles, and another rectangle of 30 mph high and 3 hours wide, giving 90 miles, totaling 210 miles over 5 hours, again leading to 42 mph average speed.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple ways now. The average speed of the train is 42 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{42} \\]"
