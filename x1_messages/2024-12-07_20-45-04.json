So, you want to create a GoLang application that can listen for HTTP requests, parse the headers and body, and then respond with some custom headers and a JSON payload that includes information about the received request. Sound good?\n\nFirst things first, make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can check this by running `go version` in your terminal. If it's not installed, you can download it from golang.org.\n\nAlright, let's start by setting up a new Go module. Open your terminal and create a new directory for your project, then navigate into it:\n\n```bash\nmkdir http-server\ncd http-server\n```\n\nNow, initialize a new Go module:\n\n```bash\ngo mod init httpserver\n```\n\nThis will create a `go.mod` file that manages your project's dependencies.\n\nNext, we'll create a new Go file, let's call it `main.go`. You can do this with your favorite text editor. For example, using VSCode:\n\n```bash\ncode main.go\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer nano:\n\n```bash\nnano main.go\n```\n\nIn this file, we'll start by importing the necessary packages. For handling HTTP requests, we'll need the `net/http` package. Additionally, we'll need `encoding/json` for JSON serialization and maybe `fmt` for some basic formatting.\n\nSo, at the top of your `main.go`, add:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"encoding/json\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"net/http\"\n)\n```\n\nNow, we need to set up an HTTP server that listens on a specific port. For development purposes, port 8080 is commonly used. We'll use `http.ListenAndServe` for this.\n\nBut before that, we need to define a handler function that will process incoming requests. This function will parse the request headers and body, and then construct a response with custom headers and a JSON payload.\n\nLet's define a simple handler function:\n\n```go\nfunc requestHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    // Your code to handle the request will go here\n}\n```\n\nWe'll register this handler for a specific route, say `/request`. You can do this using `http.HandleFunc`:\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n    http.HandleFunc(\"/request\", requestHandler)\n    fmt.Println(\"Starting server at port 8080\")\n    if err := http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil); err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(err)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's focus on implementing the `requestHandler` function. First, we need to parse the request headers. In Go, request headers are accessed via `r.Header.Get(\"HeaderName\")` or `r.Header[\"HeaderName\"]`.\n\nTo parse the request body, we can read from `r.Body`. But be cautious, as reading from `r.Body` consumes it, so if you need to read it multiple times, you might need to buffer it.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the request body is in JSON format. We'll read it into a map.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```go\nfunc requestHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    // Read request body\n    var bodyMap map[string]interface{}\n    if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&bodyMap); err != nil {\n        http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)\n        return\n    }\n    defer r.Body.Close()\n\n    // Get request headers\n    headers := make(map[string]string)\n    for name, values := range r.Header {\n        headers[name] = values[0]\n    }\n\n    // Create response payload\n    response := map[string]interface{}{\n        \"headers\": headers,\n        \"body\":    bodyMap,\n    }\n\n    // Set custom headers in response\n    w.Header().Set(\"Custom-Header\", \"Value\")\n    w.Header().Set(\"Another-Header\", \"AnotherValue\")\n\n    // Write JSON response\n    w.Header().Set(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n    if err := json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(response); err != nil {\n        http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We decode the request body into a map.\n- We iterate over the request headers and store them in another map.\n- We create a response map that includes both headers and body.\n- We set custom headers in the response using `w.Header().Set`.\n- Finally, we set the `Content-Type` to `application/json` and encode the response map into JSON, writing it to the response writer.\n\nThat's pretty much it! Now, you can run your server with:\n\n```bash\ngo run main.go\n```\n\nAnd it will start listening on port 8080. You can test it using tools like `curl` or Postman by sending a POST request to `http://localhost:8080/request` with some JSON in the body and custom headers.\n\nFor example, with curl:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/request -H \"Custom-Header: Test\" -d '{\"key\":\"value\"}'\n```\n\nYou should see a JSON response containing the headers and body you sent, along with the custom headers in the response.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
