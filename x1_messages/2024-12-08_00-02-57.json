        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Ruby script that downloads the HTML content from a given URL and then parses it to extract all the links, saving them into a text file. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I cover all the steps correctly.\n\nFirst things first, I need to handle command-line arguments in Ruby. I recall that Ruby has an ARGV array that holds the command-line arguments passed to the script. So, I'll need to check if a URL is provided as an argument. If not, I should probably output an error message and exit.\n\nNext, I need to download the HTML content from the provided URL. For this, I can use Ruby's built-in Net::HTTP library, which allows making HTTP requests. I'll need to require 'net/http' at the beginning of my script.\n\nOnce I have the HTML content, I need to parse it to extract all the href attributes from the anchor tags (<a>). For parsing HTML in Ruby, I can use the Nokogiri gem, which is very powerful and easy to use. However, since the user might not have Nokogiri installed, I should probably include a check to see if it's installed and install it if necessary. But to keep things simple, I'll assume that Nokogiri is available.\n\nAfter parsing the HTML with Nokogiri, I can select all the <a> tags and extract their href attributes. I need to make sure that I handle both absolute and relative URLs correctly. Relative URLs should be converted to absolute URLs based on the base URL provided.\n\nFinally, I need to save all the extracted links into a text file, with each link on a new line. I can use Ruby's File class to write to a file.\n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\n1. Check if a URL is provided as a command-line argument.\n\n2. Use Net::HTTP to download the HTML content from the URL.\n\n3. Use Nokogiri to parse the HTML.\n\n4. Extract all href attributes from <a> tags.\n\n5. Convert relative URLs to absolute URLs.\n\n6. Write the links to a text file, one per line.\n\nI should also consider error handling, such as checking if the URL is valid, if the website is reachable, and handling any exceptions that might occur during downloading or parsing.\n\nAlright, let's start writing some code.\n\nFirst, I'll handle the command-line arguments:\n\nif ARGV.empty?\n\nputs \"Please provide a URL as a command-line argument.\"\n\nexit\n\nend\n\nurl = ARGV[0]\n\nNext, I need to download the HTML content. I'll use Net::HTTP for this:\n\nrequire 'net/http'\n\nrequire 'uri'\n\nuri = URI(url)\n\nresponse = Net::HTTP.get_response(uri)\n\nif response.is_a?(Net::HTTPSuccess)\n\nhtml_content = response.body\n\nelse\n\nputs \"Failed to retrieve the web page. Status code: #{response.code}\"\n\nexit\n\nend\n\nNow, I need to parse the HTML with Nokogiri:\n\nrequire 'nokogiri'\n\ndocument = Nokogiri::HTML(html_content)\n\nThen, extract all the href attributes from <a> tags:\n\nlinks = document.css('a').map { |a| a['href'] }.compact\n\nBut I need to convert relative URLs to absolute URLs. I can use the URI class for this:\n\nbase_uri = URI(url)\n\nabsolute_links = links.map do |link|\n\nbegin\n\nuri = URI(link)\n\nuri = base_uri.merge(uri) unless uri.absolute?\n\nrescue URI::InvalidURIError\n\nnil\n\nend\n\nend.compact\n\nNow, I need to write these links to a text file. I'll call the file \"links.txt\":\n\nFile.open(\"links.txt\", \"w\") do |file|\n\nabsolute_links.each do |link|\n\nfile.puts(link)\n\nend\n\nend\n\nputs \"Links have been saved to links.txt\"\n\nI should also add some comments to the code for clarity.\n\nPutting it all together, the script would look like this:\n\n```ruby\n\n# This script downloads the HTML content from a given URL and extracts all links (href attributes),\n\n# saving them into a text file named \"links.txt\", one link per line.\n\nrequire 'net/http'\n\nrequire 'uri'\n\nrequire 'nokogiri'\n\n# Check if a URL is provided as a command-line argument\n\nif ARGV.empty?\n\nputs \"Please provide a URL as a command-line argument.\"\n\nexit\n\nend\n\nurl = ARGV[0]\n\n# Download the HTML content\n\nuri = URI(url)\n\nresponse = Net::HTTP.get_response(uri)\n\nif response.is_a?(Net::HTTPSuccess)\n\nhtml_content = response.body\n\nelse\n\nputs \"Failed to retrieve the web page. Status code: #{response.code}\"\n\nexit\n\nend\n\n# Parse the HTML with Nokogiri\n\ndocument = Nokogiri::HTML(html_content)\n\n# Extract all href attributes from <a> tags\n\nlinks = document.css('a').map { |a| a['href'] }.compact\n\n# Convert relative URLs to absolute URLs\n\nbase_uri = URI(url)\n\nabsolute_links = links.map do |link|\n\nbegin\n\nuri = URI(link)\n\nuri = base_uri.merge(uri) unless uri.absolute?\n\nrescue URI::InvalidURIError\n\nnil\n\nend\n\nend.compact\n\n# Write the links to a text file\n\nFile.open(\"links.txt\", \"w\") do |file|\n\nabsolute_links.each do |link|\n\nfile.puts(link)\n\nend\n\nend\n\nputs \"Links have been saved to links.txt\"\n\n```\n\nI should test this script with a sample URL to ensure it works as expected. I'll use a known website and check if the links are correctly extracted and saved to the file.\n\nAdditionally, I might want to handle more edge cases, such as URLs with query parameters, fragments, or different schemes (http vs https). I should also consider any potential errors that might occur during URL parsing or file writing and add appropriate error handling.\n\nOverall, this should accomplish the task effectively.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo accomplish the task of downloading the HTML content from a given URL and extracting all links (href attributes) to save them into a text file, you can use the following Ruby script. This script uses the `net/http` library to download the HTML content and the `nokogiri` gem to parse the HTML and extract the links.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```ruby\n# This script downloads the HTML content from a given URL and extracts all links (href attributes),\n# saving them into a text file named \"links.txt\", one link per line.\n\nrequire 'net/http'\nrequire 'uri'\nrequire 'nokogiri'\n\n# Check if a URL is provided as a command-line argument\nif ARGV.empty?\n  puts \"Please provide a URL as a command-line argument.\"\n  exit\nend\n\nurl = ARGV[0]\n\n# Download the HTML content\nuri = URI(url)\nresponse = Net::HTTP.get_response(uri)\n\nif response.is_a?(Net::HTTPSuccess)\n  html_content = response.body\nelse\n  puts \"Failed to retrieve the web page. Status code: #{response.code}\"\n  exit\nend\n\n# Parse the HTML with Nokogiri\ndocument = Nokogiri::HTML(html_content)\n\n# Extract all href attributes from <a> tags\nlinks = document.css('a').map { |a| a['href'] }.compact\n\n# Convert relative URLs to absolute URLs\nbase_uri = URI(url)\nabsolute_links = links.map do |link|\n  begin\n    uri = URI(link)\n    uri = base_uri.merge(uri) unless uri.absolute?\n  rescue URI::InvalidURIError\n    nil\n  end\nend.compact\n\n# Write the links to a text file\nFile.open(\"links.txt\", \"w\") do |file|\n  absolute_links.each do |link|\n    file.puts(link)\n  end\nend\n\nputs \"Links have been saved to links.txt\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Command-Line Argument Check**:\n   - The script checks if a URL is provided as a command-line argument. If not, it prompts the user to provide one and exits.\n\n2. **Downloading HTML Content**:\n   - Uses `net/http` to send an HTTP request to the provided URL and retrieves the HTML content.\n   - Checks if the response is successful (HTTP 200). If not, it informs the user and exits.\n\n3. **Parsing HTML**:\n   - Uses `nokogiri` to parse the retrieved HTML content.\n\n4. **Extracting Links**:\n   - Extracts all `href` attributes from `<a>` tags.\n   - Converts any relative URLs to absolute URLs based on the base URL.\n\n5. **Saving Links to a File**:\n   - Writes the extracted and converted links to a text file named \"links.txt\", with each link on a new line.\n   - Informs the user that the links have been saved.\n\nThis script provides a robust way to extract and save links from a web page, handling both relative and absolute URLs appropriately."
