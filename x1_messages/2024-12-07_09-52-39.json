        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about five machines that produce widgets. Each machine produces 20% more widgets per hour than the one before it, and the first machine makes 100 widgets per hour. I need to find out how many widgets all five machines produce together in one hour.\n\nOkay, so starting with the first machine: it produces 100 widgets per hour. Now, the second machine produces 20% more than the first one. So, how do I calculate 20% more than 100?\n\nWell, 20% of 100 is 20, so the second machine produces 100 + 20 = 120 widgets per hour.\n\nNext, the third machine produces 20% more than the second machine. So, 20% of 120 is 24, right? Because 10% of 120 is 12, so 20% is 24. Therefore, the third machine produces 120 + 24 = 144 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, the fourth machine produces 20% more than the third machine. 20% of 144 is... let's see, 10% is 14.4, so 20% is 28.8. So, the fourth machine produces 144 + 28.8 = 172.8 widgets per hour.\n\nWait, but machines can't produce a fraction of a widget, can they? Maybe I should keep the decimals for now and round off at the end if needed.\n\nMoving on, the fifth machine produces 20% more than the fourth machine. So, 20% of 172.8 is... 10% is 17.28, so 20% is 34.56. Therefore, the fifth machine produces 172.8 + 34.56 = 207.36 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, to find the total production per hour of all five machines, I need to add up the individual productions:\n\nFirst machine: 100\n\nSecond machine: 120\n\nThird machine: 144\n\nFourth machine: 172.8\n\nFifth machine: 207.36\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n100 + 120 = 220\n\n220 + 144 = 364\n\n364 + 172.8 = 536.8\n\n536.8 + 207.36 = 744.16\n\nSo, all five machines together produce 744.16 widgets per hour.\n\nBut again, since we're dealing with whole widgets, maybe it's better to round this to the nearest whole number. So, 744.16 rounds to 744 widgets per hour.\n\nWait a minute, but the fifth machine is producing 207.36 widgets, which has two decimal places. Maybe the company allows for fractional widgets, or perhaps there's a better way to approach this problem.\n\nLet me think differently. Since each machine produces 20% more than the previous one, this seems like a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by a common ratio.\n\nIn a geometric sequence, the nth term is given by a * r^(n-1), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, a = 100 (first machine), and r = 1.20 (since 20% more means multiplying by 1.20).\n\nSo, the production of each machine is:\n\n1st machine: 100 * (1.20)^0 = 100\n\n2nd machine: 100 * (1.20)^1 = 120\n\n3rd machine: 100 * (1.20)^2 = 144\n\n4th machine: 100 * (1.20)^3 = 172.8\n\n5th machine: 100 * (1.20)^4 = 207.36\n\nAdding these up again gives the same total: 100 + 120 + 144 + 172.8 + 207.36 = 744.16\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence: S_n = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)\n\nPlugging in the values: a = 100, r = 1.20, n = 5\n\nS_5 = 100 * (1.20^5 - 1) / (1.20 - 1)\n\nFirst, calculate 1.20^5:\n\n1.20^1 = 1.20\n\n1.20^2 = 1.44\n\n1.20^3 = 1.728\n\n1.20^4 = 2.0736\n\n1.20^5 = 2.48832\n\nSo, S_5 = 100 * (2.48832 - 1) / (0.20) = 100 * (1.48832) / 0.20 = 100 * 7.4416 = 744.16\n\nAgain, the total is 744.16 widgets per hour.\n\nPerhaps it's acceptable to have a fractional number of widgets, or maybe I should consider that each machine produces whole widgets and the fractions are accumulated over time. But for the purpose of this problem, I think 744.16 is the accurate total production per hour.\n\nIf I were to round it to the nearest whole number, it would be 744 widgets per hour.\n\nAlternatively, if the company only deals in whole widgets, they might produce 744 widgets some hours and 745 in others, averaging out to 744.16 over time.\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify, I'll go with the precise calculation of 744.16 widgets per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{744.16} \\]"
