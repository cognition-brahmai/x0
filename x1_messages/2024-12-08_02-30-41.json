        "content": "Sure! Here's a Python program that implements the quicksort algorithm on a list of integers:\n\n```python\ndef quicksort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]\n    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]\n    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]\n    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_list = [3,6,8,10,1,2,1]\nsorted_list = quicksort(input_list)\nprint(sorted_list)\n```\n\nThis program defines a function called `quicksort` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that is sorted in ascending order. The function works by selecting a pivot element from the list and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively and combined with the pivot to produce the sorted list.\n\nIn the example usage, we create a list of integers called `input_list` and pass it to the `quicksort` function. The sorted list is then printed to the console.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."
