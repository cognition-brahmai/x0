        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a train's average speed. Let me see if I can figure this out. The train travels at 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, and then at 80 miles per hour for another 2 hours. I need to find the average speed for the whole trip.\n\nFirst, I think I need to understand what average speed means. I remember that average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. So, if I can find the total distance and the total time, I can calculate the average speed.\n\nLet me calculate the distance for each part of the trip first. For the first part, the train travels at 60 miles per hour for 2 hours. So, distance is speed multiplied by time, right? So, 60 miles per hour times 2 hours is 120 miles.\n\nThen, for the second part, the train travels at 80 miles per hour for another 2 hours. So, 80 miles per hour times 2 hours is 160 miles.\n\nNow, the total distance traveled is the sum of these two distances: 120 miles plus 160 miles, which is 280 miles.\n\nNext, the total time taken is 2 hours for the first part plus 2 hours for the second part, which is 4 hours.\n\nSo, the average speed should be the total distance divided by the total time, which is 280 miles divided by 4 hours. That equals 70 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Sometimes when speeds are different for different parts of the trip, but the times are the same, the average speed is just the average of the speeds.\n\nIn this case, the speeds are 60 mph and 80 mph, so the average would be (60 + 80)/2 = 70 mph. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if the times were different. For example, if the train traveled at different speeds for different amounts of time, I would need to weight the speeds by the time spent at each speed. But in this case, since the time spent at each speed is the same (2 hours each), averaging the speeds directly works fine.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the times were different. Suppose the train traveled at 60 mph for 1 hour and 80 mph for 3 hours. Then, the total distance would be (60*1) + (80*3) = 60 + 240 = 300 miles, and the total time would be 1 + 3 = 4 hours. So, the average speed would be 300 miles / 4 hours = 75 mph.\n\nIf I were to average the speeds directly, (60 + 80)/2 = 70 mph, which is not the correct average speed in this hypothetical scenario where times are different. So, in that case, averaging the speeds directly wouldn't work.\n\nBut in the original problem, the times are the same for each speed, so averaging directly is fine and gives the correct average speed of 70 mph.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of harmonic mean, but I think that's more applicable when the distances are the same rather than the times.\n\nLet me confirm with another approach. If I use the formula for average speed when times are equal:\n\nAverage speed = (speed1 + speed2)/2\n\nIn this case, (60 + 80)/2 = 70 mph.\n\nAnd using the total distance over total time: 280 miles / 4 hours = 70 mph.\n\nBoth methods agree, so I'm confident that 70 mph is the correct average speed for the entire trip.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]"
