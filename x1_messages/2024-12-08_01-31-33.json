System 1 is often responsible for our initial reactions and quick decisions, while System 2 is engaged when we need to think carefully about something. However, System 2 requires more cognitive resources and is therefore more tiring for the brain. Which of the following tasks would primarily engage System 2?\nA.

        "content": "Let's see. I have this question about the dual-process theory in cognitive psychology. It talks about System 1 and System 2, which are two types of cognitive processes. System 1 is fast, automatic, and intuitive, while System 2 is slow, deliberate, and analytical. The question is asking which task among the options would primarily engage System 2.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each system does. System 1 is responsible for quick decisions and initial reactions, stuff that we do almost without thinking. Like, for example, recognizing a friend's face in a crowd or driving a car on a familiar route. These are tasks that we can do almost automatically, without much conscious effort.\n\nOn the other hand, System 2 is engaged when we need to think carefully and deliberately. It's the more effortful and resource-intensive system. So, tasks that require concentration, problem-solving, or making complex decisions would fall under System 2.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Recognizing a friend's face in a crowd.\n\nThis seems like something that happens quickly and automatically. I don't have to think much about it; I just see someone and instantly recognize them. So, that sounds like System 1.\n\nB. Solving a complex mathematical problem.\n\nThis one requires a lot of thought, concentration, and step-by-step analysis. It's not something I can do quickly or automatically, especially if it's complex. So, this seems like it would engage System 2.\n\nC. Driving a car on a familiar route.\n\nAgain, this is something that can be done relatively automatically, especially if it's a route I take often. I don't have to think too much about how to drive or where to turn; my mind can be on other things while I'm driving. So, probably System 1.\n\nD. Listening to a catchy song.\n\nListening to music is generally an automatic and enjoyable activity. Unless I'm analyzing the song deliberately, which isn't specified, it's likely a System 1 process.\n\nE. None of the above.\n\nWell, this is just in case none of the other options fit.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that option B, solving a complex mathematical problem, would primarily engage System 2. It requires deliberate, analytical thinking and a lot of cognitive effort, which aligns with the characteristics of System 2.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nOption A, recognizing a friend's face, is definitely a System 1 task. It's fast and automatic, thanks to processes like facial recognition that are highly developed in humans.\n\nOption C, driving on a familiar route, is also mostly System 1, especially if it's a routine task. However, if there are unusual circumstances, like heavy traffic or navigating a new route, System 2 might be more engaged. But in this case, it specifies \"a familiar route,\" so probably System 1.\n\nOption D, listening to a catchy song, is generally an automatic process. Enjoying music is something that can happen without much conscious thought. Unless I'm analyzing the musical structure or trying to learn the lyrics, which isn't specified here, it's likely a System 1 activity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B, solving a complex mathematical problem, as it requires the deliberate, effortful processing typical of System 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
