Each plan will correspond to an evidence value, which will be the outcome of one of the accessible functions given an input string that could be the user's question, one or more preceding evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nAvailable tools to be used:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: A tool that enables the user to search for information via the DuckDuckGo search engine. It assists in locating a suitable list of sites that might have the answer to the user's inquiry.\nWebReader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string consisting of newline separated links. The input is one or more links, and it generates a plain text output containing the link contents.\nHyperlinkFinder[input]: Extracts hyperlinks from plain text and delivers a plain text, newline-separated response of links.\nASKER[input]: A question-answering language model, especially effective at answering queries based on an input text passage. The input has to be a textual question that refers to an :evidence[n]: variable, like 'What is the population of Tokyo, given :evidence1:?'.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [First action based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action based on the result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to call and input parameter, possibly referencing previous evidence, such as \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer]\n\nQuestion: What is the current market capitalization of Amazon and how did it change over the last year?"
