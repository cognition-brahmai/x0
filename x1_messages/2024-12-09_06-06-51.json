        "content": "So I have this investment question here. Let's see what it's asking. I need to invest $5,000 at an annual interest rate of 4%, and it's compounded quarterly. I need to find out how much the investment will be worth after 3 years.\n\nFirst, I should recall the formula for compound interest. I think it's something like A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount, which is the initial amount of money, so that's $5,000.\n\n- r is the annual interest rate, which is 4%, but I need to express that as a decimal, so that's 0.04.\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's compounded quarterly, that's 4 times a year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years, which is 3 years.\n\nSo, plugging in these values into the formula:\n\nA = 5000(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*3)\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the interest rate per quarter:\n\n0.04 / 4 = 0.01\n\nThen, add 1 to that:\n\n1 + 0.01 = 1.01\n\nNow, raise that to the power of 4 times 3, which is 12:\n\n1.01^12\n\nI need to calculate 1.01 to the power of 12. Let me see:\n\n1.01^12 \u2248 1.126825\n\nNow, multiply that by the principal amount:\n\n5000 * 1.126825 = 5634.125\n\nSo, the investment would be worth approximately $5,634.13 after 3 years.\n\nBut let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. The formula seems right, and I plugged in the numbers correctly. Yes, that looks good.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it differently to confirm. Since the interest is compounded quarterly, each quarter the investment grows by 1% (because 4% annual rate divided by 4 is 1% per quarter).\n\nSo, over 3 years, there are 12 quarters. Each quarter, the investment is multiplied by 1.01.\n\nSo, starting with $5,000:\n\nAfter 1 quarter: 5000 * 1.01 = 5050\n\nAfter 2 quarters: 5050 * 1.01 = 5100.50\n\nAfter 3 quarters: 5100.50 * 1.01 = 5151.51\n\n... and so on, up to 12 quarters.\n\nBut doing this manually would take a while, and it's prone to error. That's why the compound interest formula is so handy.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest to confirm:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nPlugging in the numbers again:\n\nA = 5000(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*3) = 5000(1.01)^12 \u2248 5000 * 1.126825 = 5634.125\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI can also estimate to see if this makes sense. If the interest was simple interest, the amount after 3 years would be:\n\n5000 + (5000 * 0.04 * 3) = 5000 + 600 = 5600\n\nBut since it's compounded quarterly, I should get a little bit more than that due to the interest on interest effect. Indeed, $5,634.13 is slightly more than $5,600, so that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I had compounded annually, the amount would be:\n\nA = 5000(1 + 0.04)^3 = 5000(1.124864) = 5624.32\n\nWhich is less than the quarterly compounding amount, as expected.\n\nSo, yes, I'm confident that $5,634.13 is the correct amount after 3 years with quarterly compounding.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5634.13} \\]"
