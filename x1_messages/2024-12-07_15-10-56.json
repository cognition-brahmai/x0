        "content": "Let's see. The company has a revenue of $1,000,000 per year. It spends 40% on salaries, 30% on rent and utilities, and 15% on marketing. To find the annual profit, I need to subtract all these expenses from the total revenue.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate each expense:\n\n1. Salaries: 40% of $1,000,000\n\n   40/100 * $1,000,000 = $400,000\n\n2. Rent and utilities: 30% of $1,000,000\n\n   30/100 * $1,000,000 = $300,000\n\n3. Marketing: 15% of $1,000,000\n\n   15/100 * $1,000,000 = $150,000\n\nNow, I'll add up all these expenses:\n\nTotal expenses = Salaries + Rent and utilities + Marketing\n\n               = $400,000 + $300,000 + $150,000\n\n               = $850,000\n\nFinally, to find the annual profit, I'll subtract the total expenses from the revenue:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Total expenses\n\n       = $1,000,000 - $850,000\n\n       = $150,000\n\nSo, the annual profit of the company is $150,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150000} \\]"
