According to the information you provided, he was born on January 15, 1949, in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nSecond, you wanted to know what movement he led. The text says he was a significant figure in the Women's Suffrage Movement.\n\nNow, about the citation, you mentioned this information comes from a URL: https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1964/king/facts/. That's the Nobel Prize organization's page on Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nHowever, I have to note that some of the details seem incorrect. Let me verify the facts.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was actually born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, not Birmingham, Alabama in 1949. He was a key leader in the African American Civil Rights Movement, not the Women's Suffrage Movement. The Women's Suffrage Movement was primarily about securing voting rights for women, which was achieved with the 19th Amendment in 1920, decades before King's leadership.\n\nKing was indeed awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his nonviolent resistance to racial prejudice in America. He was involved in various campaigns for civil rights, including voting rights for African Americans, which culminated in the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nThe Equal Rights Amendment, which you mentioned, is related to gender equality and was first proposed in 1923, long before King's time. It was passed by Congress in 1972 but never ratified by the required number of states.\n\nSo, there seem to be some inaccuracies in the information provided. It's important to cross-verify facts from reliable sources.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Martin Luther King Jr. was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, and was a leader in the African American Civil Rights Movement.}} \\]"
