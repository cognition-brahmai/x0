        "content": "So I've got this probability question here: \"A man has two children. At least one of them is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?\" Hmm, probability can be tricky, but let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem clearly. There's a man with two children, and we know that at least one of them is a boy. We need to find the probability that both are boys.\n\nOkay, so let's think about all the possible scenarios for two children. Each child can be either a boy or a girl, assuming that there are only two possibilities and that twins aren't involved, so no identical genders in the same pregnancy or anything like that.\n\nSo, the possible combinations for two children are:\n\n1. Boy and Boy (BB)\n\n2. Boy and Girl (BG)\n\n3. Girl and Boy (GB)\n\n4. Girl and Girl (GG)\n\nWait, but the problem says that at least one is a boy, so the GG combination is out. That leaves us with BB, BG, and GB.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that both are boys, given that at least one is a boy. So, among these three remaining possibilities, only one of them is BB.\n\nSo, intuitively, it seems like the probability should be 1/3.\n\nBut, I remember that in probability, especially in conditional probability, intuition can sometimes lead us astray. Maybe I should approach this more formally.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Event A: Both children are boys (BB)\n\n- Event B: At least one child is a boy (which is BB, BG, or GB)\n\nWe need to find P(A|B), the probability that both are boys given that at least one is a boy.\n\nUsing the formula for conditional probability:\n\nP(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n\nNow, A is a subset of B, because if both are boys, then certainly at least one is a boy. So, P(A and B) is just P(A).\n\nAssuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal, which is 1/2 for each.\n\nSo, P(A) = P(BB) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nNow, P(B) is the probability of having at least one boy, which is 1 minus the probability of having no boys (i.e., both girls).\n\nP(B) = 1 - P(GG) = 1 - (1/2)*(1/2) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n\nTherefore, P(A|B) = (1/4) / (3/4) = 1/3\n\nOkay, that matches my initial intuition. So, the probability is 1/3.\n\nBut wait, I've heard this problem before, and I think there might be some debate or different interpretations based on how the information is presented.\n\nFor example, sometimes the way the problem is worded can affect the sample space. Let's consider if the problem was something like: \"A man has two children. The older one is a boy. What is the probability that both are boys?\"\n\nIn that case, the sample space would be reduced differently. If the older one is a boy, then the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Boy (older) and Boy (younger) (BB)\n\n2. Boy (older) and Girl (younger) (BG)\n\nSo, only two possibilities, and only one of them is BB. So, the probability would be 1/2.\n\nBut in our original problem, we only know that at least one is a boy, without specifying which one, so the sample space includes BB, BG, and GB.\n\nI think the key here is the phrasing \"at least one is a boy.\" It doesn't specify which one, so we have to consider all possibilities where at least one is a boy.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the total number of possible gender combinations for two children, which is 4 (BB, BG, GB, GG), each with equal probability assuming independence and equal chances for boys and girls.\n\nGiven that at least one is a boy, we eliminate GG, leaving us with BB, BG, and GB. Only one of these is BB, so the probability is 1/3.\n\nBut, to make sure, maybe I can approach it differently. Suppose we list all possible gender sequences:\n\n1. Boy, Boy (BB)\n\n2. Boy, Girl (BG)\n\n3. Girl, Boy (GB)\n\n4. Girl, Girl (GG)\n\nEach has a probability of 1/4.\n\nGiven that at least one is a boy, we condition on the event B = {BB, BG, GB}, which has probability 3/4.\n\nThe probability of both being boys given that at least one is a boy is P(BB | B) = P(BB and B)/P(B) = P(BB)/P(B) = (1/4)/(3/4) = 1/3.\n\nAlright, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of conditional probability using definitions.\n\nP(BB | at least one boy) = Number of ways to have BB given at least one boy / Number of ways to have at least one boy.\n\nNumber of ways to have BB: 1 (BB)\n\nNumber of ways to have at least one boy: 3 (BB, BG, GB)\n\nSo, again, 1/3.\n\nHmm, seems solid.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem that might change the probability.\n\nFor instance, what if the man randomly tells us about one of his children, and it happens to be a boy. Then, what is the probability that the other one is also a boy?\n\nIn that case, the sample space might be different. If he randomly selects one to tell us about, and it's a boy, then the possibilities are:\n\n- If he has BB, he could mention either boy.\n\n- If he has BG, he would mention the boy.\n\n- If he has GB, he would mention the boy.\n\n- If he has GG, he would mention neither, but since he mentioned a boy, this is excluded.\n\nSo, in BB, there are two possibilities where he mentions a boy.\n\nIn BG and GB, there is one possibility each where he mentions the boy.\n\nSo, total number of ways he could mention a boy:\n\n- BB: 2 ways\n\n- BG: 1 way\n\n- GB: 1 way\n\nTotal: 4 ways.\n\nNumber of those ways where both are boys is 2 (both from BB).\n\nTherefore, the probability is 2/4 = 1/2.\n\nInteresting, that's different from the previous answer. So, in this interpretation, the probability is 1/2.\n\nThis shows that the way the information is obtained can affect the probability.\n\nIn the original problem, it says, \"a man has two children. At least one of them is a boy.\" It doesn't specify how we obtained this information, just that it's given.\n\nSo, in that case, the sample space is reduced to BB, BG, GB, and the probability is 1/3.\n\nBut if the information is obtained by the man randomly mentioning one child, and it happens to be a boy, then the probability that the other is also a boy is 1/2.\n\nThis is a subtle but important difference in probability based on the method of obtaining information.\n\nGiven the wording of the original problem, I think the intended interpretation is the first one, where we simply know that at least one is a boy without any specific reference to which one, so the probability should be 1/3.\n\nHowever, it's essential to be clear about the conditions and how the information is obtained when dealing with probability problems.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the concept of conditional probability and the importance of defining the sample space correctly.\n\nIn some variations of this problem, additional information is provided, which can change the probability.\n\nFor example, if we know that one of the boys has a specific characteristic, like being born on a Tuesday, that can affect the calculation.\n\nBut in this basic formulation, with no additional information, the probability is 1/3.\n\nTo summarize, the probability that both children are boys, given that at least one is a boy, is 1/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
