        "content": "So I have this problem here: a factory produces 2500 units of product A in 8 hours, and I need to find out how long it will take to produce 3750 units at the same production rate. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the production rate is. The production rate is basically how many units the factory can produce per hour. So, if they produce 2500 units in 8 hours, I can calculate the rate by dividing the number of units by the number of hours. That makes sense.\n\nSo, production rate = number of units / time in hours. Plugging in the numbers, that's 2500 units / 8 hours. Let me do that calculation.\n\n2500 divided by 8. 8 times 312 is 2496, which is close to 2500. So, 8 times 312.5 would be 2500. Yeah, so the production rate is 312.5 units per hour.\n\nNow, I need to find out how long it will take to produce 3750 units at this rate. So, time required would be the number of units divided by the production rate.\n\nTime = number of units / production rate.\n\nSo, time = 3750 units / 312.5 units per hour.\n\nLet me do that division.\n\n3750 divided by 312.5.\n\nHmm, 312.5 times 12 is 3750. Let me check that.\n\n312.5 times 10 is 3125.\n\n312.5 times 2 is 625.\n\nSo, 3125 plus 625 is 3750.\n\nYes, so 312.5 times 12 equals 3750.\n\nTherefore, it will take 12 hours to produce 3750 units at the same production rate.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can set up a proportion.\n\nIf 2500 units take 8 hours, then 3750 units will take x hours.\n\nSo, 2500/8 = 3750/x.\n\nNow, solve for x.\n\nCross-multiplying: 2500x = 8 times 3750.\n\n8 times 3750 is 30,000.\n\nSo, 2500x = 30,000.\n\nNow, x = 30,000 / 2500.\n\n30,000 divided by 2500 is 12.\n\nSo, again, x = 12 hours.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of unit rates.\n\nThe factory produces 2500 units in 8 hours, which is 312.5 units per hour.\n\nTo produce 3750 units at 312.5 units per hour, it would take 3750 / 312.5 = 12 hours.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see that 3750 is 1.5 times 2500, because 2500 times 1.5 is 3750.\n\nSimilarly, if time is proportional, then the time required would be 8 hours times 1.5, which is 12 hours.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same conclusion that it will take 12 hours to produce 3750 units at the same production rate.\n\nSo, the answer is 12 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
