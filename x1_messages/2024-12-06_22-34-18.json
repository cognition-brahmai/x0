        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a luxury hotel chain that's opening a new resort on a tropical island. The resort will have 200 rooms, each with an ocean view. The hotel wants to maintain an occupancy rate of no more than 90% to maximize guest satisfaction. Each room can house up to 4 guests. We need to calculate the maximum number of guests that can be accommodated at any given time, and also estimate the annual revenue if the average room rate is $500 per night and the resort operates year-round.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many rooms can be occupied at maximum occupancy. The hotel wants to maintain an occupancy rate of no more than 90%. So, we need to calculate 90% of 200 rooms.\n\nNumber of rooms that can be occupied = 200 rooms * 90% = 200 * 0.9 = 180 rooms.\n\nNow, each of these 180 rooms can house up to 4 guests. So, the maximum number of guests that can be accommodated at any given time is:\n\nMaximum guests = 180 rooms * 4 guests(room) = 720 guests.\n\nNext, we need to estimate the annual revenue. The average room rate is $500 per night, and the resort operates year-round. Assuming that all occupied rooms are paid at this rate every night, we can calculate the daily revenue and then extend it to annual revenue.\n\nFirst, daily revenue:\n\nDaily revenue = number of occupied rooms * average room rate.\n\nWe already know that up to 180 rooms can be occupied.\n\nSo, daily revenue = 180 rooms * $500/night = $90,000 per night.\n\nNow, to find annual revenue, we need to multiply the daily revenue by the number of nights in a year. There are 365 days in a year, assuming it's not a leap year.\n\nAnnual revenue = daily revenue * 365.\n\nAnnual revenue = $90,000/night * 365 nights/year = $32,850,000 per year.\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a straightforward calculation, but let's double-check if there are any other factors we should consider.\n\nFirst, the occupancy rate is set at 90%, but in reality, it might fluctuate based on seasons, promotions, etc. However, since the problem specifies to assume the resort operates year-round at this occupancy rate, we can proceed with this assumption.\n\nAlso, the average room rate is given as $500 per night, and we're to assume this is consistent throughout the year. In reality, room rates might vary based on demand, but again, we'll stick to the given information.\n\nAnother consideration is that some rooms might be unavailable for booking at certain times due to maintenance or other reasons, but since the problem doesn't mention that, we'll proceed with the 90% occupancy of all 200 rooms.\n\nAdditionally, the problem mentions that each room can house up to 4 guests, but for the purpose of revenue calculation, the number of guests per room doesn't directly affect the room rate, assuming that the room rate is per room, regardless of how many guests occupy it.\n\nTherefore, our calculations seem appropriate based on the given information.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Maximum number of guests at any given time: 720 guests.\n\n- Estimated annual revenue: $32,850,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{720 \\text{ guests}, \\$32,850,000 \\text{ annual revenue}} \\]"
