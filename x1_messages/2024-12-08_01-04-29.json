        "content": "Let's see. There are 24 students in total, and the ratio of boys to girls is 3:5. I need to find out how many boys and girls there are.\n\nFirst, I understand that a ratio tells us about the proportion of one quantity to another. So, in this case, for every 3 boys, there are 5 girls.\n\nTo find the actual numbers, I can think of the ratio as parts. So, boys are 3 parts and girls are 5 parts, making a total of 3 + 5 = 8 parts.\n\nNow, these 8 parts represent the total number of students, which is 24.\n\nSo, to find the value of one part, I can divide the total number of students by the total number of parts:\n\nOne part = 24 students \u00f7 8 parts = 3 students per part.\n\nNow, to find the number of boys, I can multiply the number of parts for boys by the value of one part:\n\nBoys = 3 parts \u00d7 3 students per part = 9 boys.\n\nSimilarly, for girls:\n\nGirls = 5 parts \u00d7 3 students per part = 15 girls.\n\nLet me check if this adds up to the total:\n\n9 boys + 15 girls = 24 students. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the ratio to set up an equation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of boys as b and the number of girls as g.\n\nAccording to the ratio, b/g = 3/5.\n\nAnd we know that b + g = 24.\n\nFrom the ratio, I can express b in terms of g:\n\nb = (3/5) * g.\n\nNow, substitute this into the total equation:\n\n(3/5) * g + g = 24.\n\nTo solve for g, first combine like terms:\n\n(3/5)g + (5/5)g = 24,\n\n(8/5)g = 24.\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 5/8 to solve for g:\n\ng = 24 * (5/8) = 15.\n\nSo, there are 15 girls.\n\nNow, substitute back to find b:\n\nb = (3/5)*15 = 9.\n\nSo, again, 9 boys and 15 girls.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using fractions.\n\nThe fraction of the class that is boys is 3/8, since boys are 3 parts out of total 8 parts.\n\nSimilarly, the fraction that is girls is 5/8.\n\nSo, number of boys = (3/8) * 24 = 9.\n\nNumber of girls = (5/8) * 24 = 15.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same answer: 9 boys and 15 girls.\n\nIt's good to verify the answer using different approaches to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9 \\text{ boys and } 15 \\text{ girls}} \\]"
