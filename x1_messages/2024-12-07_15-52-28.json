        "content": "So there's this problem about a box containing red and blue balls. It says that there are twice as many red balls as blue balls, and there are 15 blue balls. I need to find out how many balls there are in total in the box.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I know that there are blue balls and red balls in the box. The number of blue balls is given as 15. Now, it's stated that there are twice as many red balls as blue balls. So, if there are 15 blue balls, then the number of red balls should be twice that amount.\n\nLet me calculate that. Twice 15 is 2 times 15, which is 30. So, there are 30 red balls.\n\nNow, to find the total number of balls in the box, I need to add the number of blue balls and the number of red balls together. That would be 15 blue balls plus 30 red balls.\n\nLet's add those up: 15 + 30 equals 45.\n\nSo, there are 45 balls in the box altogether.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything I'm missing here? Let me double-check. The problem says there are twice as many red balls as blue balls, and there are 15 blue balls. I multiplied 15 by 2 to get 30 red balls, and then added them together to get 45. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any other colors or any other factors mentioned in the problem. The problem only mentions red and blue balls, so I think I'm safe assuming that those are the only colors in the box.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use variables. Let's say the number of blue balls is B, and the number of red balls is R. According to the problem, R = 2B, and B = 15.\n\nSo, R = 2 * 15 = 30.\n\nThen, the total number of balls, T, is B + R = 15 + 30 = 45.\n\nThis matches what I got earlier.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also check if the ratio makes sense. If there are twice as many red balls as blue balls, then for every blue ball, there are two red balls. So, the ratio of red to blue is 2:1.\n\nGiven that there are 15 blue balls, the number of red balls should be 2 for each blue ball, which is 30, as I calculated.\n\nAdding them up gives 45 balls in total.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. There are 45 balls in the box altogether.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
