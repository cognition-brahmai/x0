        "content": "So we have a classroom with 30 students seated in 5 rows, each containing 6 seats. Each student needs to shake hands with all the other students in their row, but they can't shake hands with themselves. We need to find out how many total handshakes occur.\n\nFirst, let's understand the setup. There are 5 rows, each with 6 students. So, in each row, students only shake hands with the other students in that same row.\n\nLet's consider one row. In a single row, there are 6 students, and each student shakes hands with every other student in that row except themselves. So, for one row, how many handshakes occur?\n\nTo find the number of handshakes in one row, we can use the formula for combinations since the order of shaking hands doesn't matter (i.e., shaking hands is a mutual action). The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial.\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 6 \\) (students in a row), and \\( k = 2 \\) because a handshake involves two students.\n\nSo, the number of handshakes in one row is:\n\n\\[\nC(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(6 - 2)!} = \\frac{720}{2 \\times 24} = \\frac{720}{48} = 15\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 15 handshakes in one row.\n\nNow, since there are 5 rows, and each row has 15 handshakes, the total number of handshakes would be:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 15 = 75\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Is there any possibility that students from different rows are shaking hands? The problem states that each student shakes hands only with all other students in their row, so no handshakes occur between students of different rows.\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes is indeed 75.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as each row being a complete graph where every vertex (student) is connected to every other vertex in the same row, and the number of edges (handshakes) in a complete graph with \\( n \\) vertices is \\( C(n, 2) \\), which is what we calculated.\n\nSo, the final answer is 75 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
