        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a group of 25 people, and among them, 15 are musicians and 10 are athletes. Additionally, we're told that 6 of the musicians also play sports, which I assume means they are both musicians and athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many people are exclusively musicians or exclusively athletes, not counting those who are both.\n\nLet's define some terms to make this clearer:\n\n- Let M be the set of musicians.\n\n- Let A be the set of athletes.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- The total number of people is 25.\n\n- The number of musicians, |M|, is 15.\n\n- The number of athletes, |A|, is 10.\n\n- The number of people who are both musicians and athletes is 6.\n\nWe can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of people who are either musicians or athletes or both.\n\nThe formula for the union of two sets is:\n\n|M \u222a A| = |M| + |A| - |M \u2229 A|\n\nWhere:\n\n- |M \u222a A| is the number of people who are musicians or athletes or both.\n\n- |M \u2229 A| is the number of people who are both musicians and athletes.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n|M \u222a A| = 15 + 10 - 6 = 19\n\nSo, 19 people are either musicians or athletes or both.\n\nBut the total number of people in the group is 25. Therefore, the number of people who are neither musicians nor athletes is:\n\n25 - 19 = 6\n\nBut the question is asking for the number of people who are exclusively musicians or exclusively athletes.\n\nTo find the number of exclusive musicians, we subtract the number of people who are both from the total number of musicians:\n\nExclusive musicians = |M| - |M \u2229 A| = 15 - 6 = 9\n\nSimilarly, the number of exclusive athletes is:\n\nExclusive athletes = |A| - |M \u2229 A| = 10 - 6 = 4\n\nTherefore, the total number of people who are exclusively musicians or exclusively athletes is:\n\n9 (exclusive musicians) + 4 (exclusive athletes) = 13\n\nAlternatively, we could have arrived at the same answer by subtracting the number of people who are both from the total number who are musicians or athletes:\n\n|M \u222a A| - |M \u2229 A| = 19 - 6 = 13\n\nThis confirms our previous result.\n\nSo, the number of people who are exclusively musicians or exclusively athletes is 13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
