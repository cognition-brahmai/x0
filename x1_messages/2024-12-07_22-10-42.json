        "content": "Consuming salty foods can be risky for people with hypertension because sodium can cause the body to retain fluid, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure. It's generally recommended that individuals with hypertension limit their sodium intake to manage their condition effectively. However, the exact amount of sodium that is safe can vary based on individual health status and other factors, so it's best for people with hypertension to consult with their healthcare provider for personalized advice."
