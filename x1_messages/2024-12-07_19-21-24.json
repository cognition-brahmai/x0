        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a swimming pool holds 25,000 gallons of water, and it takes 5 hours to fill it completely. I need to find out the flow rate of the hose in gallons per minute. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what flow rate means. Flow rate is basically how much water is flowing through the hose per unit of time. In this case, we want to know the rate in gallons per minute.\n\nSo, I have the total volume of the pool, which is 25,000 gallons, and the total time it takes to fill the pool, which is 5 hours. To find the flow rate in gallons per minute, I need to find out how many gallons are flowing per minute.\n\nFirst, I should probably convert the time from hours to minutes because the rate is wanted in gallons per minute. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 5 hours is 5 times 60, which is 300 minutes.\n\nNow, I have 25,000 gallons being filled in 300 minutes. So, to find the flow rate, I can divide the total volume by the total time in minutes.\n\nFlow rate = Total volume / Total time in minutes\n\nSo, flow rate = 25,000 gallons / 300 minutes\n\nNow, let's do the math.\n\n25,000 divided by 300.\n\nWell, 300 times 80 is 24,000.\n\n25,000 minus 24,000 is 1,000.\n\nSo, 300 times 3 is 900, which is less than 1,000.\n\n300 times 3 is 900, so 1,000 minus 900 is 100.\n\nSo, 300 times 83 is 24,900.\n\n25,000 minus 24,900 is 100.\n\nSo, 300 times 83.333... is 24,999.999..., which is essentially 25,000.\n\nWait, maybe I should just divide 25,000 by 300 directly.\n\n25,000 \u00f7 300.\n\nI can simplify this by dividing both numerator and denominator by 100.\n\n25,000 \u00f7 100 is 250.\n\n300 \u00f7 100 is 3.\n\nSo, now it's 250 \u00f7 3.\n\n250 divided by 3 is approximately 83.333...\n\nSo, the flow rate is approximately 83.333 gallons per minute.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's check the units.\n\nWe have 25,000 gallons in 300 minutes, so dividing gallons by minutes gives gallons per minute.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of hours first.\n\n5 hours is 5 hours.\n\n25,000 gallons in 5 hours.\n\nFirst, find the flow rate in gallons per hour.\n\n25,000 gallons / 5 hours = 5,000 gallons per hour.\n\nNow, there are 60 minutes in an hour, so to find gallons per minute, divide gallons per hour by 60.\n\nSo, 5,000 gallons per hour \u00f7 60 minutes per hour = 5,000 \u00f7 60 = 83.333... gallons per minute.\n\nSame answer.\n\nSo, the flow rate of the hose is approximately 83.33 gallons per minute.\n\nWait, does that seem too high? Let's think about it realistically.\n\nI know that household hoses usually have flow rates of about 5 to 10 gallons per minute.\n\nBut this is a swimming pool, which is a large volume, so maybe the hose is bigger.\n\nBut even commercial hoses don't typically go up to 83 gallons per minute.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\n25,000 gallons in 5 hours.\n\n5 hours is 300 minutes.\n\n25,000 \u00f7 300 = 83.333... gallons per minute.\n\nAlternatively, 25,000 gallons in 5 hours is 5,000 gallons per hour.\n\n5,000 gallons per hour \u00f7 60 = 83.333... gallons per minute.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the time conversion.\n\nWait, maybe the time is in hours, and I need to convert it properly to minutes.\n\nYes, 5 hours is indeed 5 times 60, which is 300 minutes.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct.\n\nPerhaps the issue is that the hose is not a single hose but multiple hoses filling the pool simultaneously.\n\nBut the problem says \"the hose,\" implying a single hose.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pool is being filled by a pump with a higher flow rate.\n\nBut regardless, based on the information given, the calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the flow rate is approximately 83.33 gallons per minute.\n\nAlternatively, it could be exact if we express it as a fraction.\n\n25,000 divided by 300 is 250 divided by 3, which is 83 and 1/3 gallons per minute.\n\nSo, 83.333... gallons per minute is the same as 83 and 1/3 gallons per minute.\n\nPerhaps expressing it as a fraction is more precise.\n\nSo, the flow rate is 83 and 1/3 gallons per minute.\n\nAlternatively, in decimal form, it's approximately 83.33 gallons per minute.\n\nDepending on the required precision, either is acceptable.\n\nBut since the problem gives measurements in whole numbers, perhaps the answer should be in decimal form.\n\nSo, I'll go with approximately 83.33 gallons per minute.\n\nBut to be precise, it's 83 and 1/3 gallons per minute.\n\nSo, the hose has a flow rate of 83 and 1/3 gallons per minute.\n\nThat's pretty high for a single hose, but maybe for large pools, such flow rates are possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, maybe the time is in minutes instead of hours.\n\nBut the problem says 5 hours.\n\nYes, it's 5 hours.\n\nSo, unless that's a typo and it's meant to be 5 minutes, but that would be unusual for filling a 25,000-gallon pool.\n\nIn 5 minutes, that would be a huge flow rate.\n\nWait, no, wait, let's think.\n\nIf it's 5 hours, which is 300 minutes, and 25,000 gallons, then the flow rate is 83.33 gallons per minute, as calculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pool volume is in liters, but the problem specifies gallons.\n\nSo, I think the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the flow rate of the hose is approximately 83.33 gallons per minute.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{83.\\overline{3} \\text{ gallons per minute}} \\]"
