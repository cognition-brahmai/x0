        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a store that sells three types of items: X, Y, and Z. Each has different profit margins, and the store has sold different amounts of each. I need to find out the total profit made from all these sales. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what profit margin means. Profit margin is the percentage of the selling price that is profit. So, for item X, which has a 25% profit margin, that means that for every dollar sold, 25 cents is profit. Similarly, for item Y, it's 30 cents profit per dollar, and for item Z, it's 35 cents per dollar.\n\nNow, the store has sold $10,000 worth of item X, $15,000 worth of item Y, and $20,000 worth of item Z. To find the profit from each type of item, I need to calculate the profit based on their respective profit margins.\n\nLet's start with item X:\n\nSales of X: $10,000\n\nProfit margin for X: 25%\n\nProfit from X = Sales of X * Profit margin for X\n\nSo, Profit from X = $10,000 * 0.25 = $2,500\n\nNext, item Y:\n\nSales of Y: $15,000\n\nProfit margin for Y: 30%\n\nProfit from Y = Sales of Y * Profit margin for Y\n\nProfit from Y = $15,000 * 0.30 = $4,500\n\nNow, item Z:\n\nSales of Z: $20,000\n\nProfit margin for Z: 35%\n\nProfit from Z = Sales of Z * Profit margin for Z\n\nProfit from Z = $20,000 * 0.35 = $7,000\n\nFinally, to find the total profit, I need to add up the profits from all three items:\n\nTotal profit = Profit from X + Profit from Y + Profit from Z\n\nTotal profit = $2,500 + $4,500 + $7,000 = $14,000\n\nSo, the total profit made by the store from selling these items is $14,000.\n\nJust to double-check, let's make sure that the calculations are correct.\n\nFor item X: $10,000 * 25% = $2,500 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor item Y: $15,000 * 30% = $4,500 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor item Z: $20,000 * 35% = $7,000 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTotal: $2,500 + $4,500 + $7,000 = $14,000 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything seems to add up correctly. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14000} \\]"
