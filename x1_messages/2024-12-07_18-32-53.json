        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 12 black socks and 8 white socks in a box, making a total of 20 socks. I need to find the probability that if I pick two socks at random without looking, both of them will be black.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to remember the basic formula for probability, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} \\]\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcomes are the ways to pick two black socks, and the total possible outcomes are all the ways to pick any two socks from the box.\n\nSo, let's calculate the total number of possible outcomes. Since there are 20 socks and I'm picking 2, I need to find out how many combinations of 2 socks can be made from 20. I recall that the formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose 2 socks from 20 is:\n\n\\[ C(20, 2) = \\frac{20!}{2!(20 - 2)!} = \\frac{20!}{2! \\times 18!} \\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the \\( 18! \\) in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[ C(20, 2) = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 18!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = \\frac{380}{2} = 190 \\]\n\nSo, there are 190 possible ways to pick any 2 socks from the box.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to pick 2 black socks from the 12 black socks available.\n\nUsing the combinations formula again:\n\n\\[ C(12, 2) = \\frac{12!}{2!(12 - 2)!} = \\frac{12!}{2! \\times 10!} \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ C(12, 2) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 10!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} = \\frac{132}{2} = 66 \\]\n\nSo, there are 66 ways to pick 2 black socks from the 12 available.\n\nNow, to find the probability, I'll divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{66}{190} \\]\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n\\[ \\frac{66 \\div 2}{190 \\div 2} = \\frac{33}{95} \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that both socks picked will be black is \\( \\frac{33}{95} \\).\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Another way to approach probability problems like this is to consider the probabilities step by step, especially since the picks are without replacement, meaning the probability changes after the first pick.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nFirst, the probability of picking a black sock on the first draw. There are 12 black socks out of 20 total socks, so:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{first black}) = \\frac{12}{20} = \\frac{3}{5} \\]\n\nNext, given that the first sock picked was black, there are now 11 black socks left and a total of 19 socks remaining in the box. So, the probability of picking another black sock is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{second black} | \\text{first black}) = \\frac{11}{19} \\]\n\nTo find the overall probability of both events happening, I multiply the probabilities:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{both black}) = P(\\text{first black}) \\times P(\\text{second black} | \\text{first black}) = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{11}{19} = \\frac{33}{95} \\]\n\nOkay, so I get the same answer using this method, which reinforces that \\( \\frac{33}{95} \\) is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the total probabilities without using combinations. The total number of ways to pick two socks in sequence is 20 for the first pick and 19 for the second, giving 20 \u00d7 19 = 380 possible ordered pairs. However, since the order doesn't matter in this problem, I would need to account for that by dividing by 2, which would bring it back to 190 total possible outcomes, matching my earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to pick two black socks in sequence would be 12 for the first pick and 11 for the second, giving 12 \u00d7 11 = 132 ordered pairs. Again, since order doesn't matter, dividing by 2 gives 66 favorable outcomes, which is consistent with the combinations approach.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I arrive at the same probability of \\( \\frac{33}{95} \\).\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also calculate the probability of picking two white socks and see if it makes sense.\n\nFirst, the number of ways to pick 2 white socks from 8:\n\n\\[ C(8, 2) = \\frac{8!}{2!(8 - 2)!} = \\frac{8!}{2! \\times 6!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2} = 28 \\]\n\nSo, there are 28 ways to pick 2 white socks.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking two white socks is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{28}{190} = \\frac{14}{95} \\]\n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking one black and one white sock can be calculated.\n\nFirst, the number of ways to pick one black and one white sock. This can be done in two ways: black first then white, or white first then black.\n\nUsing combinations:\n\n\\[ C(12, 1) \\times C(8, 1) = 12 \\times 8 = 96 \\]\n\nAlternatively, using probabilities:\n\nProbability of black first and white second:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12}{20} \\times \\frac{8}{19} = \\frac{96}{380} = \\frac{48}{190} = \\frac{24}{95} \\]\n\nProbability of white first and black second:\n\n\\[ \\frac{8}{20} \\times \\frac{12}{19} = \\frac{96}{380} = \\frac{48}{190} = \\frac{24}{95} \\]\n\nTotal probability for one black and one white sock:\n\n\\[ \\frac{24}{95} + \\frac{24}{95} = \\frac{48}{95} \\]\n\nNow, if I add up all the probabilities:\n\nProbability both black: \\( \\frac{33}{95} \\)\n\nProbability both white: \\( \\frac{14}{95} \\)\n\nProbability one black and one white: \\( \\frac{48}{95} \\)\n\nTotal:\n\n\\[ \\frac{33}{95} + \\frac{14}{95} + \\frac{48}{95} = \\frac{95}{95} = 1 \\]\n\nThis confirms that all possible outcomes are accounted for, and their probabilities sum to 1, which is a good check that my calculations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability of picking two black socks using permutations if I consider the order of picking, but since the order doesn't matter in this problem, combinations are the way to go.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the generalized probability formula for without replacement:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{both black}) = \\frac{12}{20} \\times \\frac{11}{19} = \\frac{33}{95} \\]\n\nWhich again confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here and can confidently say that the probability of picking two black socks at random from the box is \\( \\frac{33}{95} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{33}{95}} \\]"
