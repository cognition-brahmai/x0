        "content": "So the baker uses 3 eggs for every cake, and he has 30 eggs in total. I need to find out how many cakes he can bake with those 30 eggs.\n\nFirst, I should understand the relationship between the number of eggs and the number of cakes. Since each cake requires 3 eggs, I can think of this as a ratio: 3 eggs per cake.\n\nTo find out how many cakes he can bake with 30 eggs, I need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs required per cake. So, that would be 30 eggs divided by 3 eggs per cake.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of cakes = Total eggs / Eggs per cake\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of cakes = 30 / 3\n\nNow, 30 divided by 3 is 10. So, the baker can bake 10 cakes with 30 eggs.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If he bakes 10 cakes and each cake requires 3 eggs, then the total eggs used would be 10 cakes times 3 eggs per cake, which equals 30 eggs. That matches the total number of eggs he has, so it makes sense.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider? For example, does the baker need eggs for something else, or are there any restrictions on the use of eggs? The problem doesn't mention anything else, so I'll assume that all the eggs are being used for baking cakes.\n\nAlso, I should consider whether there are any leftover eggs. In this case, since 30 divided by 3 is exactly 10, there are no leftover eggs. If the number of eggs weren't a multiple of 3, I'd have to see how many cakes he can bake and how many eggs would be left over, but here it's straightforward.\n\nSo, the final answer is that the baker can bake 10 cakes with 30 eggs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
