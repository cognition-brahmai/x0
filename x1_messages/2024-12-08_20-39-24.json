        "content": "So if the store sells 60% more apples on Saturday than on Friday, and it sells 500 apples on Friday, how many does it sell on Saturday?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"60% more\" means. If something is 60% more than another amount, it means you take the original amount and add 60% of that amount to it.\n\nSo, on Friday, the store sells 500 apples. On Saturday, it sells 60% more than that.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate 60% of 500.\n\nPercentage calculations: to find 60% of 500, I can multiply 500 by 0.60.\n\n500 * 0.60 = 300.\n\nSo, 60% of 500 is 300.\n\nNow, since it's 60% more, I need to add that 300 to the original 500.\n\n500 + 300 = 800.\n\nTherefore, the store sells 800 apples on Saturday.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that \"60% more\" can also be calculated by multiplying the original amount by 1 plus the percentage increase in decimal form.\n\nSo, 60% is 0.60, so 1 + 0.60 = 1.60.\n\nThen, 500 * 1.60 = 800.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the store sells 800 apples on Saturday.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I think of it as the ratio of Saturday sales to Friday sales is 160%, since it's 60% more.\n\nSo, 160% of 500 should be the Saturday sales.\n\n160% of 500 is 1.60 * 500 = 800.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think it's clear that the store sells 800 apples on Saturday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{800} \\]"
