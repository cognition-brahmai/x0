Implementing a function to find the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two strings is a classic problem in computer science, and it's definitely doable in Python. The LCS problem involves finding the longest sequence of characters that appear left-to-right (but not necessarily in contiguous order) in both strings.\n\nTo solve this, we can use dynamic programming, which is an efficient method for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and utilizing the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solution to its subproblems.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have two strings, let's call them `str1` and `str2`.\n   - We need to find the longest sequence of characters that appear in both strings in the same order, but not necessarily contiguously.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Table:**\n   - We'll create a 2D array (or a list of lists in Python) to store the lengths of the longest common subsequences of substrings of `str1` and `str2`.\n   - The number of rows in this table will be `len(str1) + 1`, and the number of columns will be `len(str2) + 1`. We add 1 to handle the case when one of the strings is empty.\n\n3. **Filling the Table:**\n   - We'll iterate through each character of both strings.\n   - If characters match, we'll take the value from the diagonal cell (i.e., the cell corresponding to the LCS length without including these characters) and add one.\n   - If characters don't match, we'll take the maximum value from the cell just above or the cell just to the left.\n\n4. **Reconstructing the LCS:**\n   - Once the table is filled, we can backtrack from the bottom-right corner to collect the characters of the LCS.\n\nLet's translate this into Python code.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve the longest common subsequence (LCS) problem between two strings, we can use dynamic programming. This approach efficiently computes the LCS by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and building up a solution.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Create a 2D list (`dp_table`) with dimensions `(len(str1) + 1) x (len(str2) + 1)` to store the lengths of LCS for all substrings of `str1` and `str2`.\n   \n2. **Filling the DP Table:**\n   - Iterate through each character of `str1` and `str2`.\n   - If characters match, set `dp_table[i][j]` to `dp_table[i-1][j-1] + 1`.\n   - If characters do not match, set `dp_table[i][j]` to the maximum of `dp_table[i-1][j]` and `dp_table[i][j-1]`.\n\n3. **Reconstructing the LCS:**\n   - Backtrack from `dp_table[len(str1)][len(str2)]` to collect characters that are part of the LCS.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2):\n    m = len(str1)\n    n = len(str2)\n    \n    # Create a table to store lengths of longest common suffixes of substrings\n    dp_table = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n    \n    # Fill dp_table in bottom-up fashion\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n                dp_table[i][j] = dp_table[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp_table[i][j] = max(dp_table[i - 1][j], dp_table[i][j - 1])\n    \n    # Reconstruct the LCS\n    lcs = []\n    i, j = m, n\n    while i > 0 and j > 0:\n        if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n            lcs.append(str1[i - 1])\n            i -= 1\n            j -= 1\n        elif dp_table[i - 1][j] > dp_table[i][j - 1]:\n            i -= 1\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n    lcs.reverse()\n    \n    return ''.join(lcs)\n\n# Example usage:\nstr1 = \"ABCDAF\"\nstr2 = \"ACBCF\"\nprint(longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2))  # Output: \"ABCF\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **DP Table Construction:**\n  - The `dp_table` is initialized to zero.\n  - For each character in `str1` and `str2`, if they match, the corresponding `dp_table` cell is set to the value of the diagonal cell plus one.\n  - If they don't match, the cell is set to the maximum value from the cell above or to the left.\n\n- **Reconstructing the LCS:**\n  - Starting from the bottom-right corner of the `dp_table`, if characters match, they are part of the LCS.\n  - If they don't match, move to the cell with the higher value (either above or to the left).\n  - Finally, reverse the collected characters to form the LCS.\n\nThis method ensures that we efficiently compute the LCS using dynamic programming principles, achieving both time and space efficiency."
