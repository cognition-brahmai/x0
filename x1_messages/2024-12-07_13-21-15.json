        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a class of 40 students, and 65% of them passed the exam. First, I need to find out how many students passed.\n\nTo find 65% of 40, I can calculate it as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students who passed} = \\frac{65}{100} \\times 40 = 26\n\\]\n\nSo, 26 students passed the exam.\n\nNext, it's given that each student who passed scored at least 70 points, and the maximum score was 100 points. We need to find the minimum total score for all the students in the class.\n\nTo find the minimum total score, we should assume that the students who passed scored the minimum possible score to pass, which is 70 points each, and the students who didn't pass scored the minimum possible score, which is 0 points each.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total score for the students who passed:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total score for passed students} = 26 \\times 70 = 1820\n\\]\n\nNow, the number of students who didn't pass is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students who didn't pass} = 40 - 26 = 14\n\\]\n\nAssuming these 14 students scored 0 points each, their total score would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total score for failed students} = 14 \\times 0 = 0\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum total score for all the students in the class would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Minimum total score} = 1820 + 0 = 1820\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, but I should consider if there's any possibility that the students who didn't pass could have scored some points above 0, but since the problem doesn't specify any lower bound for the failing scores, I think assuming 0 is acceptable for minimizing the total score.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this problem. Let's think about it again.\n\nWe have 26 students who passed, each scoring at least 70 points, and 14 students who didn't pass. The problem is to find the minimum total score for all students.\n\nIf we want to minimize the total score, we should minimize the scores of both the passed and failed students.\n\nFor the passed students, the minimum score each can have is 70, so the total for them is 26 * 70 = 1820, as calculated before.\n\nFor the failed students, since they didn't pass, they must have scored less than 70 points. But to minimize the total score, we should assume they scored as little as possible, which is 0, assuming that scores can be 0.\n\nTherefore, the minimum total score for the class is indeed 1820.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any constraint on the maximum score affecting the total? The maximum score is 100 points, but since we're trying to minimize the total, having some passed students score higher than 70 wouldn't help in minimizing the total; in fact, it would increase the total score.\n\nSimilarly, for the failed students, scoring any points above 0 would increase the total score, which again goes against our goal of minimizing the total.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach seems correct.\n\nSo, the minimum total score for all the students in the class is 1820.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1820} \\]"
