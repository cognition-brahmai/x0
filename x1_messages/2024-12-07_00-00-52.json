        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this game where a group of people sits in a circle, and each person starts with 3 cards. In each round, everyone passes one card to the left and receives one card from the right. We need to figure out how many cards each person has after three rounds.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what happens in each round. So, in every round, each player gives away one card to the left and receives one card from the right. That means, for each player, the number of cards they have shouldn't change because they're giving away one and getting one.\n\nWait, but let's think about it step by step. Let's say there are n players in the circle, and each starts with 3 cards.\n\nIn round 1:\n\n- Everyone passes one card to the left.\n\n- Everyone receives one card from the right.\n\nSo, for any player, they give away one card and receive one card. Therefore, their total number of cards remains the same, which is 3.\n\nSimilarly, in round 2:\n\n- Again, everyone passes one card to the left.\n\n- And receives one card from the right.\n\nAgain, giving away one and receiving one, so the total remains 3.\n\nThe same logic applies to round 3:\n\n- Pass one card to the left.\n\n- Receive one card from the right.\n\nAgain, no change in the total number of cards.\n\nSo, after three rounds, each person still has 3 cards.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's something I'm missing here. Maybe the question is trying to trick me or there's some other aspect to consider.\n\nLet me consider a smaller example to verify. Suppose there are 3 players: A, B, and C. Each starts with 3 cards.\n\nRound 1:\n\n- A passes one card to B and receives one from C.\n\n- B passes one card to C and receives one from A.\n\n- C passes one card to A and receives one from B.\n\nAfter round 1:\n\n- A gave away one to B and received one from C, so A still has 3 cards.\n\n- B gave away one to C and received one from A, so B still has 3 cards.\n\n- C gave away one to A and received one from B, so C still has 3 cards.\n\nRound 2:\n\n- A passes one card to B and receives one from C.\n\n- B passes one card to C and receives one from A.\n\n- C passes one card to A and receives one from B.\n\nAfter round 2:\n\n- Again, each player gives away one and receives one, so still 3 cards each.\n\nRound 3:\n\n- Same as above.\n\n- After round 3, each still has 3 cards.\n\nOkay, so in this small example, it's clear that the number of cards per player doesn't change.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in each round, the total number of cards in the game remains the same, and since each player is exchanging one card, their individual counts remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, after three rounds, each person still has 3 cards.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
