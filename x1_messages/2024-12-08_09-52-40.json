        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 7 red balls and 5 green balls in a bag, making a total of 12 balls. I need to find the probability that if I pick one ball, put it back, and then pick another ball, both balls are red.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes. Since I'm picking one ball and then another, and I'm putting the first one back before picking the second, each pick is independent. That means the outcome of the first pick doesn't affect the outcome of the second pick.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball on the first pick is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. So, that's 7 red balls out of 12 total balls. So, the probability for the first pick is 7/12.\n\nNow, because I'm putting the ball back, the total number of balls remains the same for the second pick. So, the probability of picking a red ball on the second pick is also 7/12.\n\nSince the two events are independent, the probability of both events happening is the product of their individual probabilities. So, I need to multiply the probability of the first pick being red by the probability of the second pick being red.\n\nSo, that's (7/12) * (7/12). Let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, 7 multiplied by 7 is 49.\n\nThen, 12 multiplied by 12 is 144.\n\nSo, the probability is 49/144.\n\nWait, but I should check if this fraction can be simplified. Let's see, 49 and 144 don't have any common factors other than 1, so 49/144 is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls picked are red is 49/144.\n\nAlternatively, I could express this as a decimal to get a better sense of it. Let's divide 49 by 144.\n\n49 divided by 144 is approximately 0.3402777..., which is roughly 0.34 or 34%.\n\nSo, there's about a 34% chance that both balls picked are red.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal balls: 7 red + 5 green = 12 balls.\n\nProbability of first pick being red: 7/12.\n\nSince I'm putting it back, the total remains the same.\n\nProbability of second pick being red: also 7/12.\n\nMultiplying them: (7/12) * (7/12) = 49/144.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of combinations, but since the picks are with replacement, the formula I used is appropriate.\n\nSo, the final answer is 49/144.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{49}{144}} \\]"
