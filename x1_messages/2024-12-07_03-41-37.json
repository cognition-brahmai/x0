        "content": "Let's see. There's this snail climbing up a 30-foot wall. Each day, it climbs up 3 feet, but at night, it slips back 2 feet. I need to find out how many days it takes for the snail to reach the top.\n\nFirst, I should understand the net progress the snail makes each day. During the day, it climbs up 3 feet, but at night, it slips back 2 feet. So, the net gain each day is 3 feet minus 2 feet, which is 1 foot per day.\n\nIf it were just 1 foot per day, then for a 30-foot wall, it would take 30 days. But I think there's more to it because on the last day, when it reaches the top, it wouldn't slip back.\n\nLet me think about that. Suppose on the final day, the snail climbs the remaining distance and reaches the top without slipping back at night because it has already reached the destination.\n\nSo, I need to consider that on the last day, the snail climbs the remaining distance without slipping back.\n\nLet me calculate how much it needs to climb on the last day to reach the top.\n\nLet's say that on the day before the last day, the snail is at a certain height. Then on the last day, it climbs 3 feet and doesn't slip back, reaching the top.\n\nI need to find out when the snail would be just below the top such that in the next day's climb, it can reach 30 feet.\n\nLet's see, if the snail climbs 3 feet on the last day and reaches 30 feet, then it must have been at 27 feet at the start of the last day because 27 + 3 = 30.\n\nBut wait, each day it climbs 3 feet during the day and slips back 2 feet at night, making a net progress of 1 foot per day.\n\nSo, up to the day before the last day, it's making a net progress of 1 foot per day.\n\nSo, to reach 27 feet, with a net progress of 1 foot per day, it would take 27 days to reach 27 feet.\n\nThen, on the 28th day, it climbs 3 feet to reach 30 feet and doesn't slip back.\n\nTherefore, it takes 28 days for the snail to reach the top of the wall.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as each day the snail makes a net gain of 1 foot, except for the last day.\n\nSo, for the first 27 days, it makes a net gain of 1 foot per day, totaling 27 feet.\n\nOn the 28th day, it climbs 3 feet to reach 30 feet and stays there.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that every day, it makes a net gain of 1 foot, except on the last day, where it makes a gain of 3 feet.\n\nSo, total height is 30 feet.\n\nIf it makes a net gain of 1 foot per day for the first few days, and then 3 feet on the last day.\n\nSo, if I let d be the number of days where it makes a 1-foot net gain, and then 1 day where it makes a 3-foot climb.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n\nd * 1 + 3 = 30\n\nSo, d = 27 days of net 1-foot gain, plus 1 day of 3-foot climb, totaling 28 days.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, some people might think that since it makes a net gain of 1 foot per day, it would take 30 days to reach 30 feet. But that doesn't account for the fact that on the last day, it climbs the remaining distance without slipping back.\n\nSo, in reality, it takes 28 days.\n\nLet me consider another example to verify.\n\nSuppose the wall is 5 feet.\n\nEach day, it climbs 3 feet and slips back 2 feet.\n\nSo, net gain is 1 foot per day, except for the last day.\n\nOn day 1: climbs 3 feet, slips back 2 feet, at end of day 1, it's at 1 foot.\n\nDay 2: climbs 3 feet from 1 foot to 4 feet, and since it has reached beyond the top, it doesn't slip back.\n\nSo, it reaches 4 feet at the end of day 2, which is more than the wall height of 5 feet.\n\nWait, but in this case, it actually reaches 4 feet at the end of day 2, which is less than 5 feet.\n\nWait, let me recast this example.\n\nSuppose wall is 5 feet.\n\nDay 1: climbs 3 feet during the day, slips back 2 feet at night, ends at 1 foot.\n\nDay 2: climbs 3 feet during the day, reaches 4 feet, which is still less than 5 feet, then slips back 2 feet at night, ending at 2 feet.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, once it reaches or surpasses the top, it doesn't slip back.\n\nSo, in this case, since at the end of day 2, it only reached 4 feet, which is less than 5 feet, so it slips back to 2 feet.\n\nThen, on day 3: climbs 3 feet to 5 feet, and stays there because it has reached the top.\n\nSo, it takes 3 days for a 5-foot wall.\n\nUsing the earlier formula:\n\nd * 1 + 3 = 5\n\nd = 2 days of net 1-foot gain, plus 1 day of 3-foot climb, totaling 3 days.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, for a 30-foot wall, it would be 27 days of net 1-foot gain, plus 1 day of 3-foot climb, totaling 28 days.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as the snail needs to reach a point where, on the next day, it can climb the remaining distance in the day's climb without slipping back.\n\nSo, it needs to be at a point where the remaining distance is less than or equal to 3 feet.\n\nSo, 30 feet - 3 feet = 27 feet.\n\nSo, it needs to reach 27 feet, and then on the next day, it can climb the remaining 3 feet to reach the top.\n\nGiven that it makes a net gain of 1 foot per day, it would take 27 days to reach 27 feet, and then 1 more day to climb the last 3 feet, totaling 28 days.\n\nYes, I think 28 days is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]"
