        "content": "So the amusement park is planning to add a new roller coaster to bring in more visitors. The roller coaster has some exciting features like loops, sharp turns, and steep drops, but there's a minimum height requirement of 48 inches for safety reasons. According to past data, 65% of the park's attendees are tall enough to ride it. The park anticipates 10,000 visitors per day during the busy season, and they're thinking of charging $10 per ride. I need to estimate how many people can ride the roller coaster and how much money the park could make from it each day.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many of those 10,000 daily visitors meet the height requirement. Since 65% of attendees are tall enough, I can calculate the number of potential riders by taking 65% of 10,000.\n\nLet me do that:\n\nNumber of potential riders = 65% of 10,000\n\nTo find 65% of 10,000, I can multiply 10,000 by 0.65.\n\n10,000 \u00d7 0.65 = 6,500\n\nSo, there are potentially 6,500 riders per day.\n\nNext, I need to estimate the daily revenue from the roller coaster. If each ride costs $10, then the total revenue would be the number of rides multiplied by $10.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider how many times each rider might go on the roller coaster in a day. Do they ride it only once, or multiple times?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify how many times each rider would ride the roller coaster, so maybe I should assume each rider goes on it once per day.\n\nIf that's the case, then the daily revenue would be:\n\nRevenue = Number of potential riders \u00d7 Price per ride\n\nRevenue = 6,500 \u00d7 $10 = $65,000\n\nSo, the park could make $65,000 per day from the roller coaster.\n\nBut is that a realistic assumption? Maybe some riders would want to go on the roller coaster more than once. For example, families might have multiple members who meet the height requirement and want to ride together multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, some people might not want to ride it more than once. It could be a thrilling experience that they're satisfied with after one go.\n\nPerhaps I should consider a range. Let's say each rider goes on the roller coaster anywhere from 1 to 3 times per day.\n\nIf each rider goes once, revenue is $65,000.\n\nIf each rider goes twice, revenue is 6,500 \u00d7 $10 \u00d7 2 = $130,000.\n\nIf each rider goes three times, revenue is 6,500 \u00d7 $10 \u00d7 3 = $195,000.\n\nSo, the daily revenue could be between $65,000 and $195,000, depending on how many times each rider chooses to go on the roller coaster.\n\nBut maybe that's too broad. Maybe I can find a more precise estimate.\n\nPerhaps I should look at industry standards or average ride frequencies for roller coasters.\n\nFrom what I've read, customers at amusement parks might ride a popular attraction between 1 and 2 times per visit on average.\n\nLet's assume an average of 1.5 rides per rider per day.\n\nThen, the daily revenue would be:\n\nRevenue = Number of potential riders \u00d7 Average rides per rider \u00d7 Price per ride\n\nRevenue = 6,500 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 $10 = 6,500 \u00d7 15 = $97,500\n\nSo, $97,500 per day.\n\nBut wait, that seems high. Is it realistic to assume that each rider would go on the roller coaster 1.5 times per day?\n\nMaybe I should consider that not all riders are equally enthusiastic about the roller coaster.\n\nSome might ride it multiple times, while others might only go once.\n\nPerhaps I can think about it differently.\n\nLet's say that 50% of the potential riders go on the roller coaster once, and the other 50% go twice.\n\nThen, the total number of rides would be:\n\n(6,500 \u00d7 0.5) \u00d7 1 + (6,500 \u00d7 0.5) \u00d7 2 = 3,250 \u00d7 1 + 3,250 \u00d7 2 = 3,250 + 6,500 = 9,750 rides per day.\n\nThen, revenue would be 9,750 \u00d7 $10 = $97,500.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only 30% go once, and 70% go twice.\n\nThen, total rides would be:\n\n(6,500 \u00d7 0.3) \u00d7 1 + (6,500 \u00d7 0.7) \u00d7 2 = 1,950 \u00d7 1 + 4,550 \u00d7 2 = 1,950 + 9,100 = 11,050 rides.\n\nRevenue: 11,050 \u00d7 $10 = $110,500.\n\nOr, if 70% go once and 30% go twice:\n\n(6,500 \u00d7 0.7) \u00d7 1 + (6,500 \u00d7 0.3) \u00d7 2 = 4,550 \u00d7 1 + 1,950 \u00d7 2 = 4,550 + 3,900 = 8,450 rides.\n\nRevenue: 8,450 \u00d7 $10 = $84,500.\n\nSo, depending on the distribution of ride frequencies, the revenue can vary between $84,500 and $110,500.\n\nMaybe I can take the average of these two scenarios.\n\nAverage revenue = ($84,500 + $110,500)/2 = $97,500.\n\nAgain, $97,500.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some riders go three times.\n\nLet's say 40% go once, 40% go twice, and 20% go three times.\n\nTotal rides:\n\n(6,500 \u00d7 0.4) \u00d7 1 + (6,500 \u00d7 0.4) \u00d7 2 + (6,500 \u00d7 0.2) \u00d7 3 = 2,600 \u00d7 1 + 2,600 \u00d7 2 + 1,300 \u00d7 3 = 2,600 + 5,200 + 3,900 = 11,700 rides.\n\nRevenue: 11,700 \u00d7 $10 = $117,000.\n\nAnother variation.\n\nThis suggests that the revenue could be higher if a significant portion of the riders choose to go multiple times.\n\nBut, I need to consider whether the park can handle that many rides in a day.\n\nIs there a limit to how many times the roller coaster can operate in a day?\n\nI should think about the capacity of the roller coaster.\n\nHow many people can ride it per hour, for example.\n\nIf the roller coaster has a certain capacity, say, 1,000 people per hour, and the park is open for, let's say, 10 hours a day, then the total daily capacity would be 1,000 \u00d7 10 = 10,000 rides per day.\n\nBut wait, our earlier estimates of total rides per day are higher than that.\n\nFor example, in the last scenario, we had 11,700 rides per day, but the capacity is only 10,000.\n\nThat means not all riders who want to ride multiple times can do so, because the roller coaster can't accommodate that many rides in a day.\n\nTherefore, I need to consider the capacity constraints.\n\nLet's assume the roller coaster can handle 1,000 rides per hour and is open for 10 hours a day, so 10,000 rides per day.\n\nBut we have 6,500 potential riders.\n\nIf all 6,500 riders want to go on the roller coaster at least once, but some want to go multiple times, the total demand could exceed the supply.\n\nIn that case, some riders might have to be turned away or wait in long lines, which could affect their experience and potentially reduce the number of times they ride.\n\nAlternatively, the park might manage the rides in a way that maximizes revenue or customer satisfaction.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nMaybe I should assume that the park can only accommodate up to 10,000 rides per day, regardless of demand.\n\nIn that case, the maximum revenue would be 10,000 \u00d7 $10 = $100,000 per day.\n\nBut not all of the 6,500 potential riders would get to ride if the total rides exceed 10,000.\n\nWait, but 6,500 riders could potentially take up more than 10,000 rides if they ride multiple times.\n\nBut the capacity is only 10,000 rides per day.\n\nSo, perhaps the park needs to manage the number of rides per person to not exceed the capacity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the park will have a\u6392\u961f\u7cfb\u7edf, where riders wait in line and get on the roller coaster as soon as it's their turn, until the park closes.\n\nIn that case, the number of rides per person would depend on how long they're willing to wait and how many rides are available.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should simplify it by assuming that the park can handle all the rides demanded by the riders, up to its capacity.\n\nSo, if the total demand is less than or equal to 10,000 rides, all riders can ride as many times as they want, up to their desired number.\n\nIf the total demand exceeds 10,000 rides, then some riders might not get all the rides they want.\n\nBut for estimation purposes, perhaps I can assume that the park's capacity is sufficient to meet the demand.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the capacity constraint in my calculations.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nAssume the roller coaster can operate 10,000 rides per day.\n\nWith 6,500 potential riders, if each rider wants to go on the roller coaster once, the total rides would be 6,500, which is less than the capacity of 10,000.\n\nTherefore, all riders can go once, and there's still capacity left for additional rides.\n\nSo, some riders can go multiple times.\n\nIf we assume that the remaining capacity is 10,000 - 6,500 = 3,500 rides, then up to 3,500 riders can go a second time.\n\nIf each of those 3,500 riders goes twice, that would be 3,500 \u00d7 2 = 7,000 rides, but that exceeds the capacity.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIf 3,500 riders go a second time, that would be an additional 3,500 rides, bringing the total to 6,500 + 3,500 = 10,000 rides.\n\nSo, 3,500 riders can go twice, and the remaining 3,000 riders can go once.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nTotal rides: 6,500 (first rides) + 3,500 (second rides) = 10,000 rides.\n\nSo, 3,500 riders go twice, and 3,000 riders go once.\n\nTotal revenue would be:\n\n(3,500 riders \u00d7 2 rides \u00d7 $10) + (3,000 riders \u00d7 1 ride \u00d7 $10) = (3,500 \u00d7 20) + (3,000 \u00d7 10) = $70,000 + $30,000 = $100,000.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the daily revenue is $100,000.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable estimate, considering the capacity constraints.\n\nBut perhaps there are other factors to consider.\n\nFor example, not all riders might want to ride the roller coaster multiple times.\n\nSome might be satisfied with one ride, while others might want to ride it several times.\n\nAlso, the waiting time could be a deterrent for some riders who don't want to wait in long lines.\n\nMoreover, the park might implement a system where riders are limited to a certain number of rides per day to manage the demand.\n\nAlternatively, they might allow unlimited rides for a higher ticket price.\n\nBut based on the information provided, it seems reasonable to estimate the daily revenue from the roller coaster at around $100,000, assuming a capacity of 10,000 rides per day at $10 per ride.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that not all potential riders will necessarily want to ride the roller coaster.\n\nWhile 65% of attendees meet the height requirement, it's possible that some of them might not be interested in riding the roller coaster for various reasons, such as fear of heights, motion sickness, or preference for other attractions.\n\nTherefore, the actual number of riders might be lower than the potential 6,500.\n\nMaybe I should apply another factor to account for this.\n\nSuppose that only 80% of the potential riders actually choose to ride the roller coaster.\n\nThen, the number of actual riders would be 6,500 \u00d7 0.8 = 5,200 riders.\n\nAssuming each rider goes once, and with remaining capacity of 10,000 - 5,200 = 4,800 rides, some riders could go multiple times.\n\nIf all 5,200 riders go once, and 4,800 of them go a second time, that would exceed the total capacity.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIf 5,200 riders go once, that's 5,200 rides, leaving 4,800 rides available.\n\nThose 4,800 rides could be distributed among some of the 5,200 riders who want to ride again.\n\nSo, up to 4,800 riders could go a second time.\n\nBut that's more riders than the initial number, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nIf there are 5,200 riders and 10,000 available rides, then each rider could, in theory, ride up to 10,000 / 5,200 \u2248 1.92 times.\n\nBut since riders can't ride a fraction of a time, perhaps on average, each rider could go about twice.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, total rides are 10,000, and riders are 5,200, so average rides per rider = 10,000 / 5,200 \u2248 1.92 times.\n\nSo, on average, each rider could go almost twice.\n\nTherefore, revenue would be 10,000 rides \u00d7 $10 = $100,000.\n\nAgain, $100,000.\n\nIt seems like, regardless of how I slice it, the daily revenue hovers around $100,000, considering the capacity constraints.\n\nPerhaps that's a reasonable estimate.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should also consider other factors that could affect revenue.\n\nFor example, the price elasticity of demand.\n\nIf the ticket price is set at $10, would some potential riders decide not to ride if the price were higher?\n\nAlternatively, could the park charge more than $10 per ride and still attract customers?\n\nThis might be relevant for pricing strategy, but since the problem specifies a ticket price of $10, I don't need to worry about that for this estimation.\n\nAnother factor is seasonality.\n\nThe park expects 10,000 visitors per day during peak season.\n\nBut what about off-peak seasons?\n\nIf the park wants to estimate annual revenue, they'd need to consider varying daily visitor numbers throughout the year.\n\nHowever, since the question focuses on peak season and daily revenue, I can stick to the given figures.\n\nAlso, I should consider operating costs.\n\nWhile the problem asks only for revenue, not profit, it's worth noting that revenue is not the same as profit.\n\nThe park will have to subtract operating costs, maintenance costs, labor costs, etc., from the revenue to determine the profit.\n\nBut again, since the question is about revenue, I don't need to delve into costs.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided data and considering capacity constraints, the new roller coaster could generate approximately $100,000 in daily revenue during peak season.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100000} \\]"
