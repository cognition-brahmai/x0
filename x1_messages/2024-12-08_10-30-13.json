        "content": "So I have this problem about building a fence around a rectangular garden. The garden is 20 feet long and 15 feet wide, and I need to add a fence around it with a gate that's 4 feet wide. I need to figure out how much fencing I'll need in total.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate the perimeter of the garden since the fence is going around the entire thing. For a rectangle, the perimeter is calculated by adding up all the sides, or more specifically, by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: Perimeter = 2 * (20 feet + 15 feet) = 2 * 35 feet = 70 feet.\n\nNow, there's a gate that's 4 feet wide. Does that mean I need to subtract the width of the gate from the total perimeter because the gate won't have fencing?\n\nWait, but the gate is part of the fence, right? So, I think I need fencing for the entire perimeter, and the gate is just a section that has a different component, but still needs fencing on either side.\n\nActually, maybe I need to consider that the gate is a separate piece that is included in the fencing. So, perhaps the total fencing needed is still the perimeter plus the gate.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think differently.\n\nIf the gate is 4 feet wide, and it's part of the fence, then perhaps the fencing needed is the perimeter minus the width of the gate, because the gate will be installed in place of that section of the fence.\n\nSo, total fencing needed = Perimeter - width of gate = 70 feet - 4 feet = 66 feet.\n\nBut then again, if the gate is in addition to the perimeter, maybe I need to add the gate's width to the perimeter.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. The gate is probably replacing a section of the fence, so I should subtract the width of the gate from the total perimeter.\n\nLet me consider this: when you have a fence with a gate, the gate is a movable section that allows access, but the framing of the gate still requires fencing on both sides to hinge it to.\n\nSo, actually, the fencing needs to cover the entire perimeter, including the gate's width, because the gate is attached to the fence.\n\nWait, no. If the gate is 4 feet wide, and it's installed within the fence, then the fencing would need to be continuous around the perimeter, including the gate.\n\nI think the best way to look at it is that the fence goes all around the garden, and the gate is a part of that fence that opens.\n\nSo, the total fencing needed should still be the perimeter of the garden, which is 70 feet, plus the gate's width, because the gate is an additional piece.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the gate is installed within the perimeter, replacing a section of the fence.\n\nSo, the total fencing needed is the perimeter minus the width of the gate, plus the gate itself.\n\nBut the gate has its own framing, so perhaps it's perimeter minus the width of the gate opening, plus the gate's framing.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider that the gate is a separate piece that is attached to the fence, and it has its own framing, so I need to add the gate's width to the perimeter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gate is simply a section of the fence that is movable, but still requires fencing on both sides.\n\nI think I need to simplify this.\n\nLet's assume that the gate is a 4-foot wide section that is hinged to the fence, and it requires fencing on both sides to hinge to.\n\nSo, the total fencing needed would be the perimeter minus the width of the gate (since the gate covers that section), plus the gate's own framing.\n\nBut then, the gate's framing would include the two sides that hinge to the fence, so perhaps I need to add the height of the gate twice (for the two sides).\n\nWait, but the problem is about the length of the fencing, not the height.\n\nI'm getting off track.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nImagine the garden is a rectangle with sides 20 feet and 15 feet.\n\nThe perimeter is 2*(20 + 15) = 70 feet.\n\nNow, if I want to install a gate that is 4 feet wide, I need to place it on one of the sides.\n\nLet's say I place it on the longer side, which is 20 feet.\n\nSo, on one of the 20-foot sides, instead of having solid fencing for the entire 20 feet, I have fencing on (20 - 4) = 16 feet, and the gate covers the remaining 4 feet.\n\nBut the gate itself has two sides that are attached to the fence, so I need to account for those.\n\nWait, but in terms of linear feet of fencing, the gate probably has its own framing that needs to be included in the total fencing length.\n\nThis is getting too confusing.\n\nMaybe I should look for a simpler way to think about it.\n\nPerhaps the total fencing needed is the perimeter of the garden minus the width of the gate, because the gate is installed in place of that section of the fence.\n\nSo, total fencing = perimeter - gate width = 70 feet - 4 feet = 66 feet.\n\nAlternatively, if the gate is in addition to the perimeter fencing, then it would be perimeter + gate width = 74 feet, but that doesn't make sense because the gate is part of the fence.\n\nI think the first option makes more sense: total fencing = perimeter - gate width = 66 feet.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the gate is a separate piece that is attached to the fence, and it has its own framing, so perhaps I need to add the gate's width to the perimeter.\n\nWait, but that would mean more fencing is needed, which doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gate is simply a break in the fence, and the fencing continues on both sides of the gate.\n\nIn that case, the total fencing would still be the perimeter minus the width of the gate.\n\nI'm going to go with that.\n\nSo, total fencing needed = perimeter - gate width = 70 feet - 4 feet = 66 feet.\n\nTherefore, I need 66 feet of fencing.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider that the gate has its own framing, which might require additional fencing material.\n\nIf the gate is hinged to the fence on both sides, then perhaps I need to add the height of the gate twice (for the two sides), but since we're dealing with linear feet, and the problem doesn't specify the height, maybe it's safe to assume that the gate's framing is included in the gate's width.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial calculation, total fencing needed is 66 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{66} \\]"
