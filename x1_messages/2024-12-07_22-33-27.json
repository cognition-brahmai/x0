Each letter tile has a point value based on its frequency in the English language, and players aim to score points by forming words horizontally or vertically adjacent to existing words on the board. The game was indeed invented by Alfred Mosher Butts during the Great Depression, and it has since become a beloved pastime for millions around the world."
