        "content": "The term that describes an economy where production, investment, prices, and incomes are determined centrally by a government is called a \"planned economy\" or \"command economy.\" In such an economic system, the government makes decisions about what goods and services should be produced, how much should be produced, and at what price they should be sold. This is in contrast to a market economy, where these decisions are made through the interactions of buyers and sellers in the marketplace."
