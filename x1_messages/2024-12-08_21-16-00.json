However, based on descriptions and common experiences, an old book might have a rough or brittle cover due to aging paper or leather. The pages could feel thin and easily crumpled, with yellowed edges from time. There might also be a slight musty odor associated with aged books. But remember, every old book is unique, and their textures can vary greatly depending on factors like materials used, storage conditions, and age."
