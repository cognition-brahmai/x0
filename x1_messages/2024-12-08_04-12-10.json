        "content": "Let's see. So, five friends went to a restaurant and ordered three pizzas. They decided to divide the cost equally among themselves. The total bill was $60, which included a $6 tip. We need to find out what was the cost of each pizza.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total cost and what it includes. The total bill is $60, and this includes a $6 tip. So, the cost of the pizzas themselves would be the total bill minus the tip.\n\nSo, cost of pizzas = total bill - tip\nCost of pizzas = $60 - $6 = $54\n\nNow, they ordered three pizzas, and they are dividing the cost equally among themselves. But I need to find the cost of each pizza, not how much each person pays.\n\nWait, actually, the question is asking for the cost of each pizza. So, if the total cost of the pizzas is $54 and they ordered three pizzas, then the cost per pizza would be:\n\nCost per pizza = total cost of pizzas / number of pizzas\nCost per pizza = $54 / 3 = $18\n\nSo, each pizza cost $18.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another way to look at this. The total bill is $60, which includes a $6 tip, so the pizzas cost $54 in total. Dividing that by three pizzas gives $18 per pizza.\n\nAlternatively, if the five friends are dividing the total bill equally, each person would pay $60 / 5 = $12. But that's not what the question is asking. The question is about the cost of each pizza, not how much each person pays.\n\nSo, my answer should be that each pizza costs $18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
