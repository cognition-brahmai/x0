I'll guide you through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what a command-line calculator does. It's a program that takes input from the user, performs a calculation based on the input, and then displays the result. In this case, our calculator will support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nHere's a plan for our program:\n\n1. **Welcome Message**: Display a welcome message to the user.\n2. **Input Handling**: Ask the user to input two numbers and the operation they want to perform.\n3. **Operation Selection**: Based on the operation selected, perform the corresponding calculation.\n4. **Result Display**: Show the result of the calculation.\n5. **Error Handling**: Make sure to handle any possible errors, like division by zero.\n\nLet's start by writing the code step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Welcome Message\n\nWe'll begin by displaying a welcome message to the user.\n\n```python\nprint(\"Welcome to the Simple Command-Line Calculator!\")\n```\n\n### Step 2: Input Handling\n\nNext, we need to get input from the user. We'll ask for two numbers and the operation they want to perform.\n\n```python\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\noperator = input(\"Enter operator (+, -, *, /): \")\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n```\n\nHere, we're using `float` to handle decimal numbers as well.\n\n### Step 3: Operation Selection\n\nNow, we'll use conditional statements to determine which operation to perform based on the operator entered by the user.\n\n```python\nif operator == \"+\":\n    result = num1 + num2\nelif operator == \"-\":\n    result = num1 - num2\nelif operator == \"*\":\n    result = num1 * num2\nelif operator == \"/\":\n    if num2 != 0:\n        result = num1 / num2\n    else:\n        result = \"Error! Division by zero.\"\nelse:\n    result = \"Invalid operator!\"\n```\n\n### Step 4: Result Display\n\nAfter calculating the result, we'll display it to the user.\n\n```python\nprint(\"Result: \", result)\n```\n\n### Step 5: Error Handling\n\nWe've already handled division by zero in the operation selection step. It's also a good idea to handle cases where the user enters invalid inputs, but for simplicity, we'll assume the user enters valid inputs for now.\n\n### Complete Program\n\nPutting it all together, here's the complete code for our simple command-line calculator:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Welcome to the Simple Command-Line Calculator!\")\n\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\noperator = input(\"Enter operator (+, -, *, /): \")\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\nif operator == \"+\":\n    result = num1 + num2\nelif operator == \"-\":\n    result = num1 - num2\nelif operator == \"*\":\n    result = num1 * num2\nelif operator == \"/\":\n    if num2 != 0:\n        result = num1 / num2\n    else:\n        result = \"Error! Division by zero.\"\nelse:\n    result = \"Invalid operator!\"\n\nprint(\"Result: \", result)\n```\n\n### Testing the Program\n\nTo test this program, you can run it in your Python environment and enter different numbers and operators to see if it performs the calculations correctly. For example:\n\n- Enter first number: 10\n- Enter operator (+, -, *, /): +\n- Enter second number: 5\n- Result: 15.0\n\n- Enter first number: 10\n- Enter operator (+, -, *, /): /\n- Enter second number: 0\n- Result: Error! Division by zero.\n\nThis should give you a good starting point for creating a simple command-line calculator in Python. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
