        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train going from Town A to Town B at 60 mph, and it takes 30 minutes to get there. Then it comes back to Town A at 90 mph. We need to find the average speed for the whole round trip.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, if I can find the total distance and the total time, I can calculate the average speed.\n\nOkay, let's find the distance from Town A to Town B. The train goes at 60 mph and takes 30 minutes. But wait, 30 minutes is 0.5 hours, so the distance is speed times time, which is 60 mph times 0.5 hours, which equals 30 miles. So, Town A to Town B is 30 miles apart.\n\nNow, the round trip would be going to Town B and back to Town A, so the total distance is twice that, which is 60 miles.\n\nNext, I need to find the total time taken for the round trip. We already know the time to go from A to B is 0.5 hours. Now, for the return trip from B to A, the train travels at 90 mph, and the distance is still 30 miles. Time is distance divided by speed, so that's 30 miles divided by 90 mph, which is 1/3 hours, or about 20 minutes.\n\nSo, total time for the round trip is 0.5 hours plus 1/3 hours. To add these, it's better to convert them to fractions. 0.5 is the same as 1/2, and 1/2 plus 1/3 is (3/6 + 2/6) which equals 5/6 hours.\n\nNow, total distance is 60 miles, total time is 5/6 hours. So, average speed is total distance divided by total time, which is 60 miles divided by 5/6 hours. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so that's 60 miles times 6/5, which equals 72 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to check this? Maybe using the formula for average speed when two speeds are different for equal distances.\n\nI recall that for a round trip where the distances are equal, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the two speeds. The formula is (2 * speed1 * speed2) / (speed1 + speed2).\n\nLet's plug in the values: (2 * 60 mph * 90 mph) / (60 mph + 90 mph) = (2 * 5400) / 150 = 10800 / 150 = 72 mph.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the average speed for the entire round trip is 72 mph.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Suppose I calculate the time taken for each leg again and ensure there are no mistakes.\n\nFrom A to B: 30 miles at 60 mph, time = 30 / 60 = 0.5 hours.\n\nFrom B to A: 30 miles at 90 mph, time = 30 / 90 = 1/3 hours.\n\nTotal time = 0.5 + 1/3 = 5/6 hours.\n\nTotal distance = 30 + 30 = 60 miles.\n\nAverage speed = total distance / total time = 60 / (5/6) = 60 * 6/5 = 72 mph.\n\nEverything checks out. So, the answer should be 72 mph.\n\nI think that's correct. Sometimes intuition might suggest just taking the average of the two speeds, which would be (60 + 90)/2 = 75 mph, but that's not how average speed works. It's the total distance over total time, which in this case is 72 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72 \\text{ mph}} \\]"
