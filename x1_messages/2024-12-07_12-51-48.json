        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this problem about a farmer who has ducks and cows, and he counts 50 heads and 136 legs. I need to figure out how many ducks there are.\n\nFirst, I should probably set up some equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of ducks as D and the number of cows as C.\n\nSince each animal has one head, the total number of heads is the sum of the number of ducks and cows. So:\n\nD + C = 50\n\nNow, for the legs. Ducks have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 136, so:\n\n2D + 4C = 136\n\nOkay, now I have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1) D + C = 50\n\n2) 2D + 4C = 136\n\nI need to solve for D and C.\n\nOne way to solve this is by using the substitution method. I can solve the first equation for one variable and substitute it into the second equation.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for D:\n\nD = 50 - C\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation:\n\n2(50 - C) + 4C = 136\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n100 - 2C + 4C = 136\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n100 + 2C = 136\n\nNow, subtract 100 from both sides:\n\n2C = 36\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nC = 18\n\nNow that I have the number of cows, I can find the number of ducks by plugging C back into the first equation:\n\nD = 50 - 18\n\nD = 32\n\nSo, there are 32 ducks and 18 cows.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nIf there are 32 ducks and 18 cows:\n\nTotal heads: 32 + 18 = 50 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTotal legs: (32 \u00d7 2) + (18 \u00d7 4) = 64 + 72 = 136 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]"
