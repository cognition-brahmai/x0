        "content": "So the factory produces widgets at a rate of 50 per hour, and each widget needs 3 minutes of quality control inspection. The factory operates for 8 hours each day, and I need to find out how many widgets can be inspected and shipped in one day.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many widgets are produced in one day. Since the factory produces 50 widgets per hour and operates for 8 hours, I can multiply 50 by 8 to get the total production.\n\n50 widgets/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 400 widgets\n\nSo, 400 widgets are produced in one day.\n\nNow, each widget requires 3 minutes of inspection. To find out how much total inspection time is needed for 400 widgets, I can multiply the number of widgets by the inspection time per widget.\n\n400 widgets \u00d7 3 minutes/widget = 1200 minutes\n\nBut, I need to see how many widgets can actually be inspected in the available time in one day. Wait, but the factory operates for 8 hours, which is the same time available for inspection, right? Or is there a separate inspection team working simultaneously?\n\nLet me assume that the inspection is done by a separate team that works at the same time as the production. So, if the factory operates for 8 hours, that's 8 hours available for inspection.\n\nFirst, I need to convert the 8 hours into minutes because the inspection time is in minutes.\n\n8 hours \u00d7 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes\n\nSo, there are 480 minutes available for inspection each day.\n\nNow, if each widget requires 3 minutes of inspection, then the number of widgets that can be inspected in 480 minutes is:\n\n480 minutes \u00f7 3 minutes/widget = 160 widgets\n\nWait a minute, that suggests only 160 widgets can be inspected in a day, but the factory produces 400 widgets in that same day. That doesn't make sense because the production rate is higher than the inspection rate.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that inspection can happen simultaneously while production is ongoing. Maybe there are multiple inspectors or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the inspection is done after the production is complete, but that seems unlikely because the widgets need to be inspected before shipping.\n\nLet me think differently. If the factory produces widgets at 50 per hour and each widget takes 3 minutes to inspect, then perhaps I need to calculate the inspection rate per hour.\n\nFirst, find out how many minutes are in an hour: 60 minutes.\n\nThen, determine how many widgets can be inspected in one hour.\n\n60 minutes/hour \u00f7 3 minutes/widget = 20 widgets/hour\n\nSo, the inspection team can inspect 20 widgets per hour.\n\nSince the factory operates for 8 hours, the total number of widgets that can be inspected in a day is:\n\n20 widgets/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 160 widgets\n\nBut the production is 50 widgets per hour \u00d7 8 hours = 400 widgets.\n\nThis suggests that only 160 widgets can be inspected and shipped, while the remaining 240 widgets would have to wait until the next day for inspection.\n\nBut maybe there are multiple inspection teams or the inspection is done concurrently with production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inspection time is integrated into the production process, meaning that the production rate already accounts for the inspection time.\n\nWait, the problem says that each widget requires 3 minutes of quality control inspection before it can be shipped. It doesn't specify whether this inspection time is included in the production time or not.\n\nIf the inspection time is included in the production rate, then the production rate of 50 widgets per hour already accounts for the inspection, meaning that the inspection is done as part of the production process.\n\nIn that case, the 50 widgets produced per hour have already been inspected, and thus, in 8 hours, 400 widgets can be shipped.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify whether the inspection time is included in the production rate or not. It just says the factory produces widgets at 50 per hour and each requires 3 minutes of inspection before shipping.\n\nThis might imply that the inspection is an additional step after production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production rate is limited by the inspection capacity.\n\nWait, if the inspection can only handle 20 widgets per hour (as calculated earlier), but the production rate is 50 per hour, there's a bottleneck at the inspection stage.\n\nIn such a case, only 20 widgets per hour can be shipped, because the inspection is the limiting factor.\n\nOver 8 hours, that would be 20 widgets/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 160 widgets.\n\nBut this seems contradictory because the factory is producing 50 per hour but only inspecting 20 per hour.\n\nPerhaps there is a queue of widgets waiting to be inspected.\n\nIn that case, the number of widgets that can be shipped is limited by the inspection rate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are multiple inspection teams, each handling a certain number of widgets.\n\nBut the problem doesn't provide that information.\n\nPerhaps I need to assume that there is only one inspection team that can inspect widgets at a rate of 20 per hour.\n\nGiven that, the number of widgets that can be inspected and shipped in one day is 160.\n\nHowever, this seems too low compared to the production rate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inspection time is parallelized, meaning multiple widgets are inspected simultaneously.\n\nBut again, without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the production and inspection processes more carefully.\n\nLet's think in terms of time.\n\nEach hour, the factory produces 50 widgets.\n\nEach widget takes 3 minutes to inspect.\n\nSo, for 50 widgets, the total inspection time needed is 50 \u00d7 3 = 150 minutes.\n\nBut there are only 60 minutes in an hour.\n\nThis means that in one hour, the inspection time required is 150 minutes, but only 60 minutes are available for inspection.\n\nThis suggests that the inspection cannot keep up with the production.\n\nIn one hour, 50 widgets are produced, but only 60 / 3 = 20 widgets can be inspected.\n\nSo, at the end of each hour, 50 - 20 = 30 widgets are added to the inspection queue.\n\nOver 8 hours, the inspection queue would grow by 30 widgets per hour \u00d7 8 hours = 240 widgets.\n\nBut, the inspection team can inspect 20 widgets per hour, so in 8 hours, they can inspect 160 widgets.\n\nTherefore, the number of widgets that can be inspected and shipped in one day is 160.\n\nThe remaining 240 widgets would need to be inspected the next day.\n\nAlternatively, if the inspection is done continuously alongside production, the inspection team can inspect 20 widgets per hour, while 50 are produced per hour.\n\nThus, the number of widgets that can be shipped in one day is limited by the inspection rate, which is 20 per hour \u00d7 8 hours = 160 widgets.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 160 widgets.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nCalculate the total production in one day: 50 widgets/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 400 widgets.\n\nCalculate the total inspection time required: 400 widgets \u00d7 3 minutes/widget = 1200 minutes.\n\nConvert the total available time for inspection: 8 hours \u00d7 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.\n\nSince 1200 minutes of inspection are needed but only 480 minutes are available, the number of widgets that can be inspected is:\n\n480 minutes \u00f7 3 minutes/widget = 160 widgets.\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the number of widgets that can be inspected and shipped in one day is 160.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{160} \\]"
