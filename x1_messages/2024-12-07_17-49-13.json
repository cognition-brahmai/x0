        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a company's net profit. Let me see if I can figure this out. The company has an annual revenue of $4,500,000. That's the total money it brings in over a year, right? Then it spends $2,200,000 on salaries, $1,800,000 on rent, and $600,000 on utilities. So, to find the net profit, I need to subtract all these expenses from the revenue.\n\nFirst, I should add up all the expenses. Salaries are $2,200,000, rent is $1,800,000, and utilities are $600,000. Let's add those together:\n\n2,200,000 + 1,800,000 = 4,000,000\n\nThen, 4,000,000 + 600,000 = 4,600,000\n\nSo, total expenses are $4,600,000.\n\nNow, revenue is $4,500,000, and expenses are $4,600,000. To find net profit, I subtract expenses from revenue:\n\n4,500,000 - 4,600,000 = -100,000\n\nWait, that can't be right. The company has a negative profit? That means they lost $100,000 for the year. But the question asks for net profit, and negative profit is a loss.\n\nMaybe I did something wrong. Let me double-check the additions.\n\nSalaries: $2,200,000\n\nRent: $1,800,000\n\nUtilities: $600,000\n\nTotal expenses: 2,200,000 + 1,800,000 = 4,000,000; then 4,000,000 + 600,000 = 4,600,000. That seems correct.\n\nRevenue is $4,500,000, so subtracting $4,600,000 from $4,500,000 indeed gives - $100,000.\n\nHmm, maybe the company is not doing so great this year. Or perhaps there are more expenses that aren't accounted for in this problem.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there are other expenses that I'm not considering. But according to the problem, these are the only expenses mentioned: salaries, rent, and utilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some of these expenses should be categorized differently, but in straightforward terms, these are all expenses that need to be subtracted from revenue.\n\nSo, if the total expenses exceed the revenue, the company operates at a loss, which is represented by negative net profit.\n\nTherefore, the company's net profit for the year is - $100,000, indicating a loss of $100,000.\n\nI think that's the answer, unless there's something I'm missing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-100000} \\]"
