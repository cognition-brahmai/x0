        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a group of 50 people, divided into vegetarians and non-vegetarians. Specifically, there are 20 vegetarians and 30 non-vegetarians. Among these, 10 vegetarians and 15 non-vegetarians like pizza. The question is, what percentage of pizza lovers are vegetarians?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to find out the total number of pizza lovers. That would be the sum of vegetarians who like pizza and non-vegetarians who like pizza. So, that's 10 plus 15, which equals 25 people who like pizza.\n\nNow, out of these 25 pizza lovers, 10 are vegetarians. I need to find what percentage 10 is of 25. To find a percentage, I use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{part}}{\\text{whole}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the \"part\" is the number of vegetarian pizza lovers, which is 10, and the \"whole\" is the total number of pizza lovers, which is 25.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{10}{25} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nFirst, divide 10 by 25:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{25} = 0.4\n\\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.4 \\times 100 = 40\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, 40% of pizza lovers are vegetarians.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. There are 25 pizza lovers in total, and 10 of them are vegetarians. So, indeed, 10 divided by 25 is 0.4, and 0.4 times 100 is 40%. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to think about proportions. If there are 10 vegetarians who like pizza out of 25 total pizza lovers, then the proportion of vegetarian pizza lovers is 10/25, which simplifies to 2/5. To convert that to a percentage, I can multiply by 100, which again gives me 40%.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of percentages from the beginning. 10 out of 20 vegetarians like pizza, which is 50%, and 15 out of 30 non-vegetarians like pizza, which is 50% as well. So, both groups have the same percentage of pizza lovers. But the question is not about the percentage of each group that likes pizza; it's about the percentage of pizza lovers who are vegetarian.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a different approach using probabilities or something, but I think the straightforward method is the most reliable here.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Is there a chance that some people might be both vegetarians and non-vegetarians? No, that doesn't make sense. The groups are mutually exclusive: one is either a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian.\n\nAlso, the total number of people is 50, with 20 vegetarians and 30 non-vegetarians, which adds up correctly. Among them, 10 vegetarians and 15 non-vegetarians like pizza, leading to 25 pizza lovers in total.\n\nSo, the percentage of pizza lovers who are vegetarians is indeed 40%.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of overlap or if some people might be counted twice, but given the information, it seems straightforward.\n\nAnother angle: if I were to use a Venn diagram, I could have one circle for vegetarians and another for pizza lovers. The intersection would be the vegetarians who like pizza, which is 10 people. The total pizza lovers would be the sum of vegetarian pizza lovers and non-vegetarian pizza lovers, which is 10 plus 15, again 25.\n\nSo, the percentage is still 10 out of 25, which is 40%.\n\nI feel confident with this answer. There doesn't seem to be any trick or additional layer to this problem. It's a straightforward percentage calculation based on the given numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40\\%} \\]"
