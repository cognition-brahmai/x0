        "content": "So I've got this problem here: \"In how many ways can 6 different books be arranged on a shelf if one specific book must always be in the middle?\" Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on permutations, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nFirst off, I know that if there were no restrictions, the number of ways to arrange 6 different books would be 6 factorial, which is 6! = 720. But there's a condition here that one specific book must always be in the middle. So, that changes things.\n\nLet me visualize the shelf. If there are 6 spots on the shelf, like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6, then the middle position would be position 3 and position 4, right? Wait, no. For an even number of positions, the middle is between 3 and 4. But the problem says \"one specific book must always be in the middle.\" So, perhaps it's positioned between 3 and 4, or maybe it's in position 3 or position 4 specifically. But the wording seems to suggest that there is one specific middle position.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that for 6 positions, the middle position is the third position. Let me confirm that. If I have positions 1 through 6, then the middle would be between positions 3 and 4, but maybe the problem considers position 3 as the middle. Or perhaps it's position 4. I need to clarify this.\n\nActually, in a shelf with an even number of positions, there isn't a single middle position, but two central positions. But since the problem specifies that one specific book must always be in the middle, maybe it means that this book is placed in the third position, assuming that positions are numbered from left to right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shelf has positions 1 through 6, and the middle is position 3 or position 4, but the problem considers only one specific position as the middle. I think I need to assume that the middle position is position 3 for the sake of this problem.\n\nSo, if position 3 is fixed with this specific book, then I only need to arrange the remaining 5 books in the other 5 positions.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in 6 positions, the middle would be between 3 and 4, but perhaps in this context, position 3 is considered the middle.\n\nLet me try that approach. If position 3 is fixed with the specific book, then the number of ways to arrange the remaining 5 books in the other 5 positions would be 5! = 120.\n\nBut maybe the middle position is position 4. If that's the case, and position 4 is fixed with the specific book, then again, the remaining 5 books can be arranged in 5! = 120 ways.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the middle is considered as position 3.5, but since we can't have a book there, maybe the problem means that the specific book must be in position 3 or position 4.\n\nIf that's the case, then there are two possible positions for the specific book, and for each of those positions, the remaining 5 books can be arranged in 5! ways.\n\nSo, total arrangements would be 2 * 5! = 2 * 120 = 240.\n\nBut the problem says \"one specific book must always be in the middle,\" which might imply that there is only one middle position. Maybe in a shelf of 6 positions, the middle is position 3 or position 4, but the problem considers only one of them as the middle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shelf is arranged such that there is a clear middle position, perhaps position 3 or position 4, but the problem specifies only one position as the middle.\n\nI think I need to consider that there is only one specific position that is considered the middle, either position 3 or position 4, and the problem is specifying that the specific book must be in that one middle position.\n\nIn that case, if there are 6 positions and one specific position is designated as the middle, then fixing the specific book in that middle position, the remaining 5 books can be arranged in the other 5 positions in 5! = 120 ways.\n\nBut the problem is that I don't know which position is considered the middle. Is it position 3 or position 4?\n\nWait, maybe the shelf is arranged such that position 3 is considered the middle for an even number of positions. Or perhaps position 4 is considered the middle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shelf is arranged with positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and the middle is between positions 3 and 4, but for the purpose of this problem, one specific position is designated as the middle.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem is considering position 3 as the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe position 4 is considered the middle.\n\nTo make things simpler, perhaps I should assume that position 3 is the middle, as it is the third position in a six-position shelf.\n\nSo, if position 3 is fixed with the specific book, then the remaining 5 books can be arranged in the other 5 positions in 5! = 120 ways.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the middle position is position 4. If I assume that position 4 is the middle, then again, fixing the specific book in position 4, the remaining 5 books can be arranged in 5! = 120 ways.\n\nSo, depending on which position is considered the middle, the answer would be 120.\n\nBut maybe the problem is considering both positions 3 and 4 as potential middle positions, and the specific book can be in either of them.\n\nIn that case, there would be 2 choices for the middle position, and for each choice, 5! arrangements of the remaining books, totaling 2 * 120 = 240 arrangements.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"one specific book must always be in the middle,\" which suggests that there is only one specific middle position.\n\nTherefore, it's more likely that there is only one middle position, either position 3 or position 4, and the specific book must be in that one position.\n\nThus, the number of arrangements would be 5! = 120.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst scenario: only one middle position (either position 3 or position 4), specific book must be there.\n\nNumber of arrangements: 5! = 120.\n\nSecond scenario: two middle positions (positions 3 and 4), specific book must be in one of them.\n\nNumber of arrangements: 2 * 5! = 240.\n\nGiven the wording of the problem, \"one specific book must always be in the middle,\" it seems to imply that there is only one middle position, and the specific book must be in that position.\n\nTherefore, the first scenario is more appropriate, leading to 120 arrangements.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem allowed the specific book to be in either of two middle positions, it would likely state something like \"one specific book must be in one of the middle positions.\"\n\nSince it says \"in the middle,\" it probably refers to a single position.\n\nHence, the answer should be 5! = 120.\n\nBut to double-check, perhaps I should consider the general rule for permutations with restrictions.\n\nIn general, if you have n distinct items and one specific item must be in a fixed position, the number of arrangements is (n-1)!.\n\nIn this case, n = 6, one specific book is fixed in the middle position, so the number of arrangements is (6-1)! = 5! = 120.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the middle consists of two positions and the specific book can be in either, then it would be 2 * 5! = 240.\n\nBut based on the problem statement, it seems like there is only one middle position.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
