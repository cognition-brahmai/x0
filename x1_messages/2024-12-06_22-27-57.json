        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains, one leaving Town A going towards Town B at 60 km/h, and the other leaving Town B going towards Town A at 90 km/h. The distance between the towns is 300 km. I need to find out how far from Town A they will meet.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how their speeds relate to the distance they cover over time. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up when calculating how quickly the distance between them closes.\n\nSo, the combined speed is 60 km/h plus 90 km/h, which is 150 km/h. That means they're closing the 300 km distance at a rate of 150 km per hour.\n\nTo find the time it takes for them to meet, I can divide the total distance by their combined speed: time = distance / speed = 300 km / 150 km/h = 2 hours.\n\nNow, to find out how far from Town A they meet, I can calculate the distance the first train covers in that time. Since it's traveling at 60 km/h for 2 hours, distance = speed * time = 60 km/h * 2 h = 120 km.\n\nSo, they meet 120 km from Town A.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to use relative speed. Since they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds, which is again 150 km/h. The time until they meet would be the same, 2 hours, and then the distance from Town A would be the same as before, 120 km.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up equations based on the distances each train travels. Let\u2019s denote the distance from Town A to the meeting point as x km. Then, the distance from Town B to the meeting point would be (300 - x) km.\n\nThe time taken by the first train to cover x km is x / 60 hours, and the time taken by the second train to cover (300 - x) km is (300 - x) / 90 hours. Since they start at the same time and meet at the same time, these times should be equal.\n\nSo, x / 60 = (300 - x) / 90.\n\nNow, solve for x.\n\nCross-multiplying: 90x = 60(300 - x)\n\n90x = 18000 - 60x\n\nNow, add 60x to both sides: 150x = 18000\n\nThen, divide both sides by 150: x = 18000 / 150 = 120 km.\n\nSo, again, the meeting point is 120 km from Town A.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using proportions based on their speeds.\n\nThe trains are moving towards each other, and their speeds are 60 km/h and 90 km/h. The ratio of their speeds is 60:90, which simplifies to 2:3.\n\nThat means, for every 2 parts the first train travels, the second train travels 3 parts. The total parts are 2 + 3 = 5 parts.\n\nThe total distance is 300 km, so each part is 300 / 5 = 60 km.\n\nTherefore, the first train travels 2 parts, which is 120 km, and the second train travels 3 parts, which is 180 km.\n\nSo, they meet at 120 km from Town A.\n\nYet another confirmation that the answer is 120 km.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like acceleration or deceleration, but the problem doesn't mention any change in speed, so I can assume they're traveling at constant speeds.\n\nAlso, the problem states that both trains start at the same time and travel towards each other, so no need to consider any time difference.\n\nI think 120 km is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
