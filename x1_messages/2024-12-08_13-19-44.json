        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a class of 40 students. Here's what we know:\n\n- 70% passed the math exam.\n\n- 80% passed the science exam.\n\n- 50% passed both exams.\n\nWe need to find out how many students failed both exams.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many students passed each exam and both exams in numbers, since percentages can sometimes be confusing in this context.\n\nTotal students = 40\n\nPassed math = 70% of 40 = 0.7 * 40 = 28 students\n\nPassed science = 80% of 40 = 0.8 * 40 = 32 students\n\nPassed both = 50% of 40 = 0.5 * 40 = 20 students\n\nNow, to find out how many students failed both exams, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion helps us find the number of students who passed at least one exam, and then we can subtract that from the total number of students to find those who failed both.\n\nNumber who passed at least one exam = (Passed math) + (Passed science) - (Passed both)\n\nSo, that's 28 + 32 - 20 = 40 students\n\nWait a minute, that's equal to the total number of students. Does that mean everyone passed at least one exam? If that's the case, then zero students failed both exams.\n\nBut let's double-check because that seems a bit counterintuitive. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet's consider the percentages again:\n\n- 70% passed math: 28 students\n\n- 80% passed science: 32 students\n\n- 50% passed both: 20 students\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion:\n\nPassed at least one = 28 + 32 - 20 = 40\n\nTotal students = 40\n\nSo, 40 - 40 = 0 students failed both exams.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way to look at this. Maybe some students are only failing one exam, but not both.\n\nWait, according to the numbers, since 20 students passed both, then:\n\n- Students who passed only math: 28 - 20 = 8\n\n- Students who passed only science: 32 - 20 = 12\n\n- Students who passed both: 20\n\n- Students who failed both: total students - (only math + only science + both)\n\nSo, failed both = 40 - (8 + 12 + 20) = 40 - 40 = 0\n\nAgain, zero students failed both exams.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe using percentages directly.\n\nTotal percentage who passed at least one exam = percentage who passed math + percentage who passed science - percentage who passed both\n\nSo, 70% + 80% - 50% = 100%\n\nTherefore, 100% of students passed at least one exam, which means 0% failed both exams.\n\nIn terms of numbers, 100% of 40 students is 40 students passed at least one exam, so 0 students failed both.\n\nHmm, but maybe there's a mistake in the way I'm applying the inclusion-exclusion principle. Let me look it up quickly.\n\nOkay, inclusion-exclusion principle states that for any two sets, the size of their union is the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of their intersection.\n\nIn this case, passing at least one exam is the union of passing math and passing science.\n\nSo, P(math or science) = P(math) + P(science) - P(math and science)\n\nWhich is 70% + 80% - 50% = 100%\n\nGiven that the total percentage is 100%, that means all students passed at least one exam, hence none failed both.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the class has 40 students, and the number who passed at least one exam is 40, then indeed, no one failed both exams.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake in the given percentages. If 70% passed math and 80% passed science, and 50% passed both, it seems like the numbers are consistent, leading to zero students failing both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in the problem statement, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait a second, maybe the percentages are not directly applicable because they might not add up correctly. Let me try calculating the number of students who failed each exam.\n\nStudents who failed math: 30% of 40 = 12 students\n\nStudents who failed science: 20% of 40 = 8 students\n\nBut, some students might have failed both. To find the number who failed both, we need to find the intersection of those who failed math and failed science.\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle again:\n\nNumber who failed at least one exam = (failed math) + (failed science) - (failed both)\n\nBut we don't know (failed both) yet. Let's denote it as x.\n\nSo, number who failed at least one exam = 12 + 8 - x = 20 - x\n\nBut we also know that the number who passed at least one exam is 40 - (number who failed at least one exam)\n\nEarlier, we calculated that 40 students passed at least one exam, which would imply that zero students failed at least one exam. But that contradicts the numbers above.\n\nWait, no. If 40 students passed at least one exam, then the number who failed at least one exam is zero.\n\nTherefore, 20 - x = 0, which means x = 20.\n\nBut that would mean 20 students failed both exams, which contradicts the earlier calculation.\n\nHmm, there's clearly a mistake here.\n\nLet me re-examine this approach.\n\nThe number who failed at least one exam is equal to the number who failed math plus the number who failed science minus the number who failed both.\n\nSo, failed at least one = failed math + failed science - failed both\n\nBut we also know that the number who passed at least one exam is 40, which means the number who failed at least one exam is 0.\n\nTherefore:\n\n0 = 12 + 8 - x\n\nSo, x = 20\n\nBut wait, that would mean 20 students failed both exams. However, earlier calculations suggested that 40 students passed at least one exam, which would leave no room for students who failed both.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try to reconcile these two approaches.\n\nFirst approach:\n\nPassed at least one exam = passed math + passed science - passed both = 28 + 32 - 20 = 40\n\nTherefore, failed both = total students - passed at least one = 40 - 40 = 0\n\nSecond approach:\n\nFailed at least one exam = failed math + failed science - failed both = 12 + 8 - x = 20 - x\n\nBut since passed at least one exam = 40, failed at least one exam = 0\n\nTherefore, 20 - x = 0, so x = 20\n\nBut if x = 20, that would mean 20 students failed both exams, but that contradicts the first approach.\n\nThere must be a mistake in the second approach.\n\nWait, the mistake is in interpreting the failed at least one exam. If failed at least one exam is zero, that means no one failed even one exam, which contradicts the number of students who failed math and science individually.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the initial percentages are overlapping in a way that doesn't allow for 20 students to fail both exams.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the percentages given are not possible together. Let's check the feasibility of the given percentages.\n\nWe have:\n\n- 70% passed math \u2192 30% failed math\n\n- 80% passed science \u2192 20% failed science\n\n- 50% passed both\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle for passing at least one exam:\n\nPassed at least one = 70% + 80% - 50% = 100%\n\nSo, 100% passed at least one exam, which means 0% failed both exams.\n\nBut according to the failed exam perspective:\n\nFailed at least one = failed math + failed science - failed both\n\nWe have failed at least one = 30% + 20% - x% = 50% - x%\n\nBut since 100% passed at least one exam, failed at least one exam should be 0%.\n\nTherefore, 50% - x% = 0%, which implies x% = 50%\n\nBut that would mean 50% failed both exams, which contradicts the earlier calculation that 0% failed both.\n\nWait, now I'm getting conflicting results. Let's try to sort this out.\n\nIf 100% passed at least one exam, then failed at least one exam is 0%.\n\nSo, failed math + failed science - failed both = 0%\n\nTherefore, 30% + 20% - failed both = 0%\n\nSo, failed both = 50%\n\nBut, if 50% failed both, but we also have that 50% passed both.\n\nWait, that can't be right because passing both and failing both are mutually exclusive.\n\nIf a student passes both, they cannot have failed both.\n\nSo, there's a contradiction here.\n\nPerhaps the mistake is in assuming that failed both is equal to the intersection of failed math and failed science.\n\nLet's think differently.\n\nThe number of students who failed both exams should be equal to the number of students who failed math and also failed science.\n\nGiven that:\n\n- Number who failed math = 12\n\n- Number who failed science = 8\n\n- Number who passed both = 20\n\nWait, but passing both means they didn't fail both.\n\nSo, the number who failed both should be the number who did not pass both.\n\nWait, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the concept that:\n\nTotal students = passed at least one exam + failed both exams\n\nWe already calculated passed at least one exam = 40\n\nTotal students = 40\n\nTherefore, failed both exams = 40 - 40 = 0\n\nThis suggests that zero students failed both exams.\n\nBut earlier, using failed exam percentages, I got failed both = 50%, which would be 20 students.\n\nThis inconsistency is puzzling.\n\nLet me look up the principle of inclusion-exclusion for failed exams.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to apply inclusion-exclusion to the failed exams correctly.\n\nThe formula for the number of students who failed at least one exam is:\n\nFailed math + failed science - failed both\n\nWe also know that the number who failed at least one exam should be equal to the total students minus the number who passed at least one exam.\n\nFrom earlier, passed at least one exam = 40\n\nTotal students = 40\n\nTherefore, failed at least one exam = 40 - 40 = 0\n\nSo, failed math + failed science - failed both = 0\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n12 + 8 - failed both = 0\n\nTherefore, failed both = 20\n\nBut, passed both = 20 students\n\nSo, 20 students passed both, and 20 students failed both.\n\nBut that would mean that the number of students who passed at least one exam is 40 - 20 = 20, which contradicts the earlier calculation of 40.\n\nThis is confusing. Let's try another angle.\n\nLet's consider a Venn diagram.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- A as the set of students who passed math.\n\n- B as the set of students who passed science.\n\nGiven:\n\n- |A| = 28\n\n- |B| = 32\n\n- |A \u2229 B| = 20\n\nThen, the number of students who passed at least one exam is |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B| = 28 + 32 - 20 = 40\n\nTherefore, all 40 students passed at least one exam, which implies that zero students failed both exams.\n\nBut earlier, using failed exam percentages, I got 20 students failed both, which contradicts this.\n\nThere must be a mistake in the way I'm applying the failed exam percentages.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that failed both is simply failed math plus failed science minus failed at least one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to think in terms of passing and failing being complements.\n\nLet me try calculating the number of students who failed both exams using the formula:\n\nFailed both = total students - (passed math + passed science - passed both)\n\nSo, failed both = 40 - (28 + 32 - 20) = 40 - 40 = 0\n\nThis again suggests that zero students failed both exams.\n\nBut earlier, using failed percentages, I got 20 students failed both.\n\nSo, perhaps the error is in interpreting the failed percentages.\n\nLet me calculate the number of students who failed both exams using the failed percentages.\n\nFailed math = 12 students\n\nFailed science = 8 students\n\nIf we assume that all students who failed math also failed science, then the number who failed both would be 12, but that's more than the 8 who failed science, which isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that all students who failed science also failed math, then the number who failed both would be 8.\n\nBut in reality, the number who failed both could be anywhere from 0 to the smaller of the two failure numbers, which is 8.\n\nHowever, based on the earlier calculations, it seems that failed both = 20, which exceeds the number of students who failed science (8), which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, there must be an error in the initial assumptions or given data.\n\nPerhaps the given percentages are inconsistent and can't all be true at the same time.\n\nLet's check the feasibility of the given percentages.\n\nWe have:\n\n- 70% passed math\n\n- 80% passed science\n\n- 50% passed both\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion for passing at least one exam:\n\nPassed at least one = 70% + 80% - 50% = 100%\n\nSo, 100% passed at least one exam, which implies 0% failed both exams.\n\nBut according to the failed exam percentages:\n\nFailed math = 30%\n\nFailed science = 20%\n\nIf we assume that the failure in one exam is independent of the other, the maximum percentage that could have failed both is 20% (since only 20% failed science), but according to inclusion-exclusion, failed both = failed math + failed science - failed at least one.\n\nGiven that failed at least one = 0%, then failed both = 30% + 20% - 0% = 50%\n\nBut this is impossible because only 20% failed science; the number who failed both can't exceed that.\n\nThis suggests that the given percentages are inconsistent and can't all be true simultaneously.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nLet me look up the principle again.\n\nInclusion-exclusion for two sets:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nIn this context:\n\n- A is the set of students who passed math.\n\n- B is the set of students who passed science.\n\n- |A \u222a B| is the set of students who passed at least one exam.\n\nGiven that, and with the numbers provided, it correctly calculates to 40 students.\n\nTherefore, zero students failed both exams.\n\nHowever, the alternative approach using failed exams leads to a contradiction, suggesting that the given percentages are not possible simultaneously.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that the percentage of students who passed both exams is too low relative to the individual passing rates.\n\nIf 70% passed math and 80% passed science, the minimum percentage that could have passed both is 70% + 80% - 100% = 50%, which matches the given 50%.\n\nTherefore, the given data is consistent, and the calculation that zero students failed both exams is correct.\n\nThe apparent contradiction arises from misapplying the inclusion-exclusion principle to the failed exams, where the failed exams are not independent events.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that zero students failed both exams.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
