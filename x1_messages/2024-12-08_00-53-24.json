        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Let's develop a Python script using the Keras library to build and train a simple neural network model. For this example, we'll use the popular Iris dataset, which is a classic dataset in pattern recognition. The dataset consists of 150 observations from four features of iris flowers, and the goal is to classify them into three different species.\n\n### Step 1: Import necessary libraries\n\nFirst, we need to import the required libraries. We'll use pandas for data manipulation, sklearn for data splitting and preprocessing, and keras for building and training the neural network.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, StandardScaler\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\n```\n\n### Step 2: Load and preprocess the data\n\nNext, we'll load the Iris dataset. You can download it from the UCI Machine Learning Repository or use it directly from a URL. Then, we'll split the data into features (X) and labels (y), and further split it into training and testing sets.\n\n```python\n# Load the dataset\nurl = \"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data\"\nnames = ['sepal-length', 'sepal-width', 'petal-length', 'petal-width', 'class']\ndataset = pd.read_csv(url, names=names)\n\n# Split into features and labels\nX = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values\ny = dataset.iloc[:, 4].values\n\n# Encode the labels\nencoder = LabelEncoder()\ny = encoder.fit_transform(y)\n\n# Split the data into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)\n\n# Feature scaling\nscaler = StandardScaler()\nX_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)\nX_test = scaler.transform(X_test)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Define the model architecture\n\nNow, we'll define the architecture of our neural network. For this simple example, we'll use a sequential model with two dense layers.\n\n```python\n# Define the model\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(10, input_dim=4, activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))\n```\n\n### Step 4: Compile the model\n\nBefore training, we need to compile the model by specifying the loss function, optimizer, and metrics.\n\n```python\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])\n```\n\n### Step 5: Train the model\n\nNow, we'll train the model on the training data.\n\n```python\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=10, verbose=1)\n```\n\n### Step 6: Evaluate the model\n\nFinally, we'll evaluate the model's performance on the test data.\n\n```python\n# Evaluate the model\nloss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)\nprint(f'Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%')\n```\n\n### Complete Script\n\nHere's the complete script for your reference:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, StandardScaler\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\n\n# Load the dataset\nurl = \"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data\"\nnames = ['sepal-length', 'sepal-width', 'petal-length', 'petal-width', 'class']\ndataset = pd.read_csv(url, names=names)\n\n# Split into features and labels\nX = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values\ny = dataset.iloc[:, 4].values\n\n# Encode the labels\nencoder = LabelEncoder()\ny = encoder.fit_transform(y)\n\n# Split the data into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)\n\n# Feature scaling\nscaler = StandardScaler()\nX_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)\nX_test = scaler.transform(X_test)\n\n# Define the model\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(10, input_dim=4, activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=10, verbose=1)\n\n# Evaluate the model\nloss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)\nprint(f'Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%')\n```\n\nThis script covers the entire process from data preprocessing to model evaluation using Keras. You can run this script in your Python environment to see the results. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
