        "content": "So I've got this problem here about widgets from a factory. There are three types: Type A, Type B, and Type C. They produced 500 of Type A, 300 of Type B, and 200 of Type C. Each widget has a unique serial number, and I need to find the probability that a randomly selected widget is either a Type A or Type C with an even serial number.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of widgets produced. That should be the sum of all the types:\n\nTotal widgets = Type A + Type B + Type C = 500 + 300 + 200 = 1000 widgets.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the probability that a randomly selected widget is either Type A or Type C, and it has an even serial number. So, it seems like I need to find the widgets that are either Type A or Type C, and among those, count how many have even serial numbers.\n\nWait a minute, but the way the problem is phrased, \"either a Type A or Type C widget with an even serial number,\" it could be interpreted in two ways:\n\n1. The widget is either (Type A) or (Type C with an even serial number).\n\n2. The widget is either (Type A with an even serial number) or (Type C with an even serial number).\n\nI think the second interpretation makes more sense because it's about selecting a widget that is either Type A and has an even serial number, or Type C and has an even serial number.\n\nSo, I'll go with interpretation 2.\n\nNow, to find the probability, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nFavorable outcomes are the widgets that are either:\n\n- Type A with an even serial number, or\n\n- Type C with an even serial number.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of Type A widgets with even serial numbers.\n\nAssuming that serial numbers are assigned sequentially starting from 1, and they're unique, then half of them should be even and half odd, right? Because in a sequence of numbers, half are even and half are odd.\n\nSo, for Type A: 500 widgets, half should have even serial numbers.\n\nNumber of Type A with even serial numbers = 500 / 2 = 250.\n\nSimilarly, for Type C: 200 widgets, half should have even serial numbers.\n\nNumber of Type C with even serial numbers = 200 / 2 = 100.\n\nNow, since these are mutually exclusive categories (a widget can't be both Type A and Type C), I can just add these together to get the total number of favorable outcomes.\n\nTotal favorable = Type A even + Type C even = 250 + 100 = 350.\n\nTotal possible outcomes = total widgets = 1000.\n\nTherefore, probability = favorable / total = 350 / 1000 = 0.35 or 35%.\n\nBut wait, is it that straightforward? Let me double-check.\n\nAssumption: Serial numbers are sequentially assigned starting from 1, and they're unique. So, for Type A, serial numbers 1 to 500; Type B, 501 to 800; Type C, 801 to 1000.\n\nWait, but the problem says each widget has a unique serial number, but it doesn't specify how they're assigned or distributed among the types. Maybe they're randomly assigned, or maybe assigned based on type.\n\nIf serial numbers are assigned sequentially by type, then Type A: 1-500, Type B: 501-800, Type C: 801-1000.\n\nIn that case, for Type A (1-500), number of even serial numbers is 250 (2,4,6,...,500).\n\nFor Type C (801-1000), number of even serial numbers would be from 802,804,...,1000.\n\nLet's see, from 801 to 1000, the even numbers are 802,804,...,1000.\n\nThe number of even numbers in this range is (1000 - 802)/2 + 1 = (198)/2 + 1 = 99 + 1 = 100.\n\nSo, yes, 100 even serial numbers for Type C.\n\nTherefore, total favorable is 250 (Type A even) + 100 (Type C even) = 350.\n\nTotal widgets = 1000.\n\nProbability = 350/1000 = 0.35 or 35%.\n\nAlternatively, if serial numbers are randomly assigned, but still unique, then still, for any given type, half of them should have even serial numbers, assuming a large enough number and random distribution.\n\nBut in this case, since the problem states unique serial numbers and doesn't specify random assignment, I think the sequential assignment is a reasonable assumption.\n\nSo, I think 35% is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.35} \\]"
