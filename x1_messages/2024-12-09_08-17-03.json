        "content": "Let's see. The car rental company has a total of 120 cars in its fleet. According to the information provided, 40% of these are compact cars, 30% are sedans, and the remaining are SUVs. The company plans to increase its number of SUVs by 50%. I need to find out how many more SUVs they should add to achieve this.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many compact cars and sedans there are, and then determine how many SUVs are currently in the fleet.\n\nStarting with the compact cars:\n\n40% of 120 cars are compact cars.\n\nSo, number of compact cars = 40% of 120 = (40/100) * 120 = 48 cars.\n\nNext, the sedans:\n\n30% of 120 cars are sedans.\n\nNumber of sedans = 30% of 120 = (30/100) * 120 = 36 cars.\n\nNow, to find the number of SUVs, I can subtract the number of compact cars and sedans from the total number of cars.\n\nNumber of SUVs = Total cars - (Compact cars + Sedans) = 120 - (48 + 36) = 120 - 84 = 36 SUVs.\n\nThe company wants to increase its number of SUVs by 50%. So, I need to calculate 50% of the current number of SUVs and then add that to the current number to find out how many more SUVs they should add.\n\nFirst, calculate 50% of 36 SUVs:\n\n50% of 36 = (50/100) * 36 = 18 SUVs.\n\nTherefore, the company should add 18 more SUVs to increase its SUV fleet by 50%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If they have 36 SUVs and they want to increase that number by 50%, then adding 18 SUVs would bring the total number of SUVs to 36 + 18 = 54 SUVs. Is that indeed a 50% increase?\n\nLet me verify:\n\nIncrease = 50% of 36 = 18.\n\nNew total = 36 + 18 = 54.\n\nPercentage increase = (increase / original number) * 100% = (18 / 36) * 100% = 50%.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the company should add 18 more SUVs to increase its SUV fleet by 50%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
