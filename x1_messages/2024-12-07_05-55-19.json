It takes an array of integers as input and returns an object where each property is a unique number from the array, and the value is how many times that number appears in the array.\n\n```javascript\nfunction countFrequencies(arr) {\n    var frequencyCounter = {};\n    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\n        var num = arr[i];\n        if (frequencyCounter[num]) {\n            frequencyCounter[num]++;\n        } else {\n            frequencyCounter[num] = 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return frequencyCounter;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nvar numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4];\nconsole.log(countFrequencies(numbers));\n// Output: { '1': 1, '2': 2, '3': 3, '4': 4 }\n```\n\nThis function works by initializing an empty object `frequencyCounter`. It then iterates over each element in the input array `arr`. For each number, it checks if that number is already a property in the `frequencyCounter` object. If it is, it increments the value associated with that property by 1. If it's not, it adds the number as a new property with a value of 1. Finally, it returns the `frequencyCounter` object which now contains the frequency of each number in the array."
