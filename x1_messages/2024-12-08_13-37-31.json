        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: there are 5 consecutive odd numbers, and their sum is 225. I need to find the smallest number among them. Okay, first things first, I need to understand what consecutive odd numbers are.\n\nSo, consecutive odd numbers are numbers that come one after another, and they're all odd. Like, for example, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on. Each number is 2 more than the previous one, and they're all odd.\n\nNow, I need to find 5 such numbers that add up to 225. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nOne way is to let the smallest number be some variable, say x. Then, since they're consecutive odd numbers, the next one would be x + 2, then x + 4, then x + 6, and then x + 8. So, the five numbers are:\n\n1. x\n\n2. x + 2\n\n3. x + 4\n\n4. x + 6\n\n5. x + 8\n\nNow, their sum is given as 225. So, I can write an equation:\n\nx + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8) = 225\n\nLet me simplify this equation. Combining like terms:\n\nx + x + x + x + x + 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 225\n\nThat's 5x + 20 = 225\n\nNow, I can solve for x:\n\n5x + 20 = 225\n\nSubtract 20 from both sides:\n\n5x = 205\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\n\nx = 41\n\nSo, the smallest number is 41.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this. If x is 41, then the numbers are 41, 43, 45, 47, and 49. Let's add them up: 41 + 43 is 84, plus 45 is 129, plus 47 is 176, plus 49 is 225. Yes, that adds up correctly.\n\nAlternatively, I could have thought about the average of these numbers. Since there are 5 numbers, the average would be 225 divided by 5, which is 45. Now, in a set of consecutive odd numbers, the average is the middle number. So, the middle number is 45. Then, the numbers are 41, 43, 45, 47, 49. Again, the smallest is 41.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum S of n terms is S = n/2 * (first term + last term). Here, n is 5, S is 225, so:\n\n225 = 5/2 * (x + (x + 8))\n\nBecause the last term is x + 8.\n\nSimplify:\n\n225 = (5/2) * (2x + 8)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2/5:\n\n90 = 2x + 8\n\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\n\n82 = 2x\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nx = 41\n\nAgain, the same answer. Seems consistent.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the smallest number is 41.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{41} \\]"
