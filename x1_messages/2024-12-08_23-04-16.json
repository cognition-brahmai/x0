        "content": "So I've got this problem here. Let's break it down step by step. The city has a population of 500,000 people, and currently, 0.5% of them are infected with a contagious disease. We need to find out how many people need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, and the required vaccination rate for that is 90%.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what herd immunity means. Herd immunity is when a significant portion of a population is immune to a contagious disease, either through vaccination or previous infections, thereby providing indirect protection to those who are not immune. The idea is that if enough people are immune, the disease can't spread easily, protecting vulnerable individuals who can't be vaccinated or who haven't developed immunity.\n\nIn this case, the requirement is that 90% of the population needs to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. So, regardless of the current infection rate, the goal is to have 90% of the total population vaccinated.\n\nGiven that the population is 500,000, I can calculate 90% of that to find out how many people need to be vaccinated.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n90% of 500,000 is calculated as:\n\n0.90 * 500,000 = 450,000\n\nSo, 450,000 people need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that 0.5% of the population is already infected. I need to consider whether these infected individuals are already immune or not. If they are, then they might already be contributing to the herd immunity, which could affect the number of vaccinations needed.\n\nLet me check:\n\n0.5% of 500,000 is:\n\n0.005 * 500,000 = 2,500 people infected.\n\nIf these infected individuals recover and gain immunity, then they are already immune and don't need vaccination. So, they are part of the immune population.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who still need to be vaccinated would be the total required for herd immunity minus those who are already immune due to infection.\n\nSo, total vaccinations needed = 450,000 (herd immunity threshold) - 2,500 (already immune) = 447,500.\n\nTherefore, 447,500 people need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.\n\nBut, I should consider if the infection confers immunity. Maybe not all infected people will gain immunity. Or perhaps there's a chance they could be reinfected. However, for the sake of this problem, I'll assume that anyone who has been infected is immune.\n\nAlso, I should consider if the vaccination rate required for herd immunity changes based on the infection rate. But the problem states that the vaccination rate required is 90%, so I'll stick with that.\n\nSo, my final answer is 447,500 people need to be vaccinated.\n\nWait a second, maybe I should double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal population: 500,000\n\nHerd immunity threshold: 90% of 500,000 = 450,000\n\nCurrently infected: 0.5% of 500,000 = 2,500\n\nAssuming these 2,500 gain immunity from infection, so they don't need vaccination.\n\nTherefore, vaccinations needed: 450,000 - 2,500 = 447,500\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider that only vaccinations contribute to herd immunity, and not immunity from infection. In that case, the number would be the full 450,000 vaccinations needed.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that immunity from infection doesn't count towards herd immunity. In reality, both vaccinated and recovered individuals contribute to herd immunity.\n\nSo, to be precise, the number of vaccinations needed would be 447,500, assuming that the immune population from infection is already contributing to the herd immunity threshold.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem assumes that only vaccinations count towards herd immunity, then the number would be 450,000.\n\nI need to clarify this.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"how many people would need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity if the vaccination rate required for herd immunity is 90%?\"\n\nIt specifies that the vaccination rate required is 90%. Therefore, it's likely that the expectation is to calculate 90% of the population needs to be vaccinated, without considering immunity from infection.\n\nIn that case, the answer would be 450,000 vaccinations needed.\n\nHowever, in reality, herd immunity is achieved when a certain proportion of the population is immune, regardless of how they became immune. But since the problem specifies the vaccination rate required is 90%, perhaps it's focusing solely on vaccinations.\n\nGiven that, I should probably go with 450,000 as the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants me to consider that the infected people are already immune and therefore don't need vaccination, so the number of vaccinations needed is less.\n\nBut according to the problem's wording, it's the vaccination rate that needs to be 90%, so perhaps infections are not considered in this context.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll stick with the straightforward calculation: 90% of 500,000 is 450,000 vaccinations needed.\n\nSo, the final answer is 450,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{450000} \\]"
