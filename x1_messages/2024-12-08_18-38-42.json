        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many students prefer coffee and how many prefer tea.\n\nThe class has 40 students, and 60% of them prefer coffee. So, the number of students who prefer coffee is:\n\n60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 students\n\nThe rest of the students prefer tea. So, the number of students who prefer tea is:\n\n40 - 24 = 16 students\n\nNow, each student drinks an average of 2 cups per day. So, the number of cups of coffee consumed per day is:\n\n24 students * 2 cups/student = 48 cups\n\nSimilarly, the number of cups of tea consumed per day is:\n\n16 students * 2 cups/student = 32 cups\n\nNow, we need to find out how many cups are consumed over a week. Assuming a week has 7 days, the total cups of coffee consumed in a week would be:\n\n48 cups/day * 7 days = 336 cups\n\nAnd the total cups of tea consumed in a week would be:\n\n32 cups/day * 7 days = 224 cups\n\nSo, overall, the class consumes 336 cups of coffee and 224 cups of tea in a week.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check these calculations to make sure we didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the number of students who prefer coffee and tea:\n\n60% of 40 is indeed 24, and the remaining 16 prefer tea. That seems correct.\n\nEach student drinks 2 cups per day, so:\n\nCoffee: 24 students * 2 cups = 48 cups per day\n\nTea: 16 students * 2 cups = 32 cups per day\n\nOver 7 days:\n\nCoffee: 48 cups/day * 7 days = 336 cups\n\nTea: 32 cups/day * 7 days = 224 cups\n\nEverything checks out. So, the final answer is that the class consumes 336 cups of coffee and 224 cups of tea in a week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{336 \\text{ cups of coffee and } 224 \\text{ cups of tea}} \\]"
