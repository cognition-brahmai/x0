        "content": "Alright, I'm here to help you with developing a GoLang utility that monitors a specific directory for changes and logs those events with timestamps. Sounds like a useful tool!\n\nFirst, let's understand what we need to achieve:\n\n1. **Monitor a Directory:** We need to watch a specific folder on the file system for any changes.\n2. **Detect Changes:** Identify when files are added, modified, or deleted within that folder.\n3. **Log Events:** Record these changes along with timestamps.\n\nGo has a built-in package called `fsnotify` that can help us monitor file system events. We'll use this package to watch the directory for changes.\n\n## Approach\n\n1. **Set Up the Watcher:** Use `fsnotify.NewWatcher()` to create a new file watcher.\n2. **Add the Directory to Watch:** Use `watcher.Add(path)` to specify the directory to monitor.\n3. **Listen for Events:** Set up a loop to listen for events from the watcher.\n4. **Log Events with Timestamps:** When an event is received, log the event type and file name along with the current timestamp.\n\n## Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"time\"\n\n\t\"github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tif len(os.Args) != 2 {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Usage: go run main.go /path/to/directory\")\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\tdir := os.Args[1]\n\n\twatcher, err := fsnotify.NewWatcher()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\tdefer watcher.Close()\n\n\tdone := make(chan bool)\n\n\tgo func() {\n\t\tfor {\n\t\t\tselect {\n\t\t\tcase event, ok := <-watcher.Events:\n\t\t\t\tif !ok {\n\t\t\t\t\treturn\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\ttimestamp := time.Now().Format(time.RFC3339)\n\t\t\t\tlog.Printf(\"%s: %s %s\\n\", timestamp, event.Name, event.Op)\n\t\t\tcase err, ok := <-watcher.Errors:\n\t\t\t\tif !ok {\n\t\t\t\t\treturn\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tlog.Println(\"error:\", err)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}()\n\n\terr = watcher.Add(dir)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\n\t<-done\n}\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n1. **Command-Line Argument:** The directory path to monitor is passed as a command-line argument.\n2. **Watcher Setup:** We create a new file watcher using `fsnotify.NewWatcher()`.\n3. **Event Handling:** We set up a goroutine to handle events and errors from the watcher.\n   - For each event, we log the timestamp, file name, and the operation (create, write, remove, etc.).\n   - For errors, we log them accordingly.\n4. **Adding the Directory:** We add the specified directory to the watcher using `watcher.Add(dir)`.\n5. **Infinite Loop:** The main function blocks on `<-done` to keep the program running indefinitely, allowing continuous monitoring.\n\nThis utility will continuously monitor the specified directory and log any file system events with timestamps, making it easy to track changes over time.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- **Permissions:** Ensure the application has the necessary permissions to access the directory being monitored.\n- **Performance:** Monitoring large directories or directories with frequent changes may impact performance.\n- **Recursion:** If you need to monitor subdirectories as well, you might need to set up recursive watching, though `fsnotify` watches subdirectories by default when adding a parent directory.\n\nThis should cover the basics of creating a file system monitor in Go.
