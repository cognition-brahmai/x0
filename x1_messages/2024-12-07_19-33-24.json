        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a tree grows at a rate of 1.5 inches per month, and I need to find out how tall it will be after 3 years. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the growth rate and the time period. The tree grows 1.5 inches every month, and I need to know its height after 3 years. Assuming that a year has 12 months, 3 years would be 3 times 12, which is 36 months.\n\nSo, if the tree grows 1.5 inches each month for 36 months, I can find the total growth by multiplying the monthly growth rate by the number of months.\n\nTotal growth = growth rate per month \u00d7 number of months\nTotal growth = 1.5 inches/month \u00d7 36 months\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n1.5 \u00d7 36\n\nWell, 1.5 is the same as 3/2, so 3/2 \u00d7 36 is (3 \u00d7 36)/2 = 108/2 = 54 inches.\n\nSo, the tree will grow 54 inches over 3 years.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the height after 3 years, not just the growth over that period. Does that mean I need to consider the initial height of the tree?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify the initial height, so maybe it's assumed to be zero. If that's the case, then the height after 3 years would simply be the total growth, which is 54 inches.\n\nHowever, in reality, trees have an initial height even before they start growing at a certain rate. But since it's not mentioned, I'll proceed with the assumption that the initial height is zero.\n\nSo, the height after 3 years is 54 inches.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider converting that into feet, since 12 inches make a foot.\n\n54 inches divided by 12 equals 4.5 feet.\n\nSo, the tree will be 4.5 feet tall after 3 years.\n\nWait a minute, that seems pretty tall for a tree growing only 1.5 inches per month. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\n1.5 inches per month for 36 months is indeed 54 inches, and 54 inches is 4.5 feet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the growth rate is given in inches, but perhaps it should be in feet or something else. But the problem clearly states 1.5 inches per month.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the time period isn't 3 years, or maybe there's a different number of months in a year being assumed. But standardly, a year has 12 months, so 3 years would be 36 months.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the growth isn't constant, but since the problem states a constant rate of 1.5 inches per month, I can assume linear growth.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are different growth rates in different months, but again, the problem states a constant rate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are leap years to consider, but since we're dealing with months, and a month is roughly 30 days, and a year is 12 months, I don't think leap years affect the monthly growth rate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the growth rate includes the initial height, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the growth rate is compounded, like compound interest, but that seems unlikely for a growth rate given in linear terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the growth rate decreases over time, but again, the problem doesn't suggest that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the tree has a maximum height it can reach, but again, no information is given about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the growth rate is seasonal, but without specific information, I can't account for that.\n\nGiven that, I think my initial calculation is correct: 1.5 inches per month for 36 months is 54 inches, or 4.5 feet.\n\nBut let's consider if the tree could realistically grow that much in 3 years.\n\nWell, some trees grow faster than others. For example, some fast-growing trees can grow several feet per year, while others grow much slower.\n\n1.5 inches per month is 18 inches per year (since 1.5 \u00d7 12 = 18), which is 1.5 feet per year.\n\nSo, in 3 years, that would be 4.5 feet, as I calculated.\n\nThat seems plausible for some types of trees, especially in their early years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the growth rate is in centimeters, and I need to convert it to inches.\n\nBut the problem clearly states inches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, and it should be 1.5 feet per month, not inches.\n\nBut that would make the tree grow incredibly tall in 3 years: 1.5 feet per month for 36 months would be 54 feet, which is very tall for a tree in just 3 years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 1.5 inches per day, not per month.\n\nBut that would be significantly faster growth.\n\nWait, let's calculate that.\n\nIf it's 1.5 inches per day, then in 3 years (assuming 365 days per year), total days would be 3 \u00d7 365 = 1095 days.\n\nTotal growth would be 1.5 inches/day \u00d7 1095 days = 1642.5 inches.\n\nThat's 1642.5 inches divided by 12 is about 136.875 feet.\n\nThat's over 136 feet, which is extremely tall for a tree in just 3 years.\n\nThat's taller than many fully grown trees.\n\nSo, no, it's probably not per day.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's per year, but then the growth rate would be 1.5 inches per year, which is very slow for a tree.\n\nIn that case, in 3 years, the tree would grow 4.5 inches, which is only 0.375 feet.\n\nThat seems too slow for a tree.\n\nTherefore, the original interpretation seems correct: 1.5 inches per month for 36 months equals 54 inches, or 4.5 feet.\n\nSo, the tree will be 4.5 feet tall after 3 years.\n\nBut just to be thorough, perhaps I should consider if the growth is cumulative each month.\n\nMeaning, does the growth rate increase over time?\n\nThe problem states a constant growth rate of 1.5 inches per month, so no, it's not cumulative in that sense.\n\nIt's a linear growth rate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the growth rate is per cumulative height, but that would make it exponential growth, which isn't suggested by the problem.\n\nGiven that, I think my initial calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the tree will be 4.5 feet tall after 3 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4.5 \\text{ feet}} \\]"
