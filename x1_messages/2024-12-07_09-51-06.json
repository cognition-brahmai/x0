        "content": "So I've got this problem here about tiling a rectangular room with square tiles, and I need to figure out the largest possible size for each tile without having to cut any of them. The room is 12 meters long and 8 meters wide. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have a rectangular floor that's 12 meters by 8 meters, and I want to cover it entirely with square tiles, each of the same size, and without cutting any tiles. So, the tiles should fit perfectly within the dimensions of the room.\n\nSince the tiles are square, their length and width are equal. Let's denote the side length of each tile as 's' meters. Now, the number of tiles that can fit along the length of the room would be 12 divided by s, and the number of tiles that can fit along the width would be 8 divided by s. But since I can't have fractions of tiles, both 12/s and 8/s need to be whole numbers. That means 's' has to be a divisor of both 12 and 8.\n\nSo, essentially, I'm looking for the largest number 's' that divides both 12 and 8 completely, without leaving any remainder. In other words, 's' is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12 and 8.\n\nTo find the GCD of 12 and 8, I can list out the divisors of each number and find the largest one that's common to both.\n\nThe divisors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\nThe divisors of 8 are: 1, 2, 4, 8.\n\nLooking at both lists, the common divisors are 1, 2, and 4. Among these, the greatest one is 4.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible side length for each square tile is 4 meters.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If I use tiles that are 4 meters on each side, how many would I need along the length and the width?\n\nAlong the 12-meter length: 12 divided by 4 is 3 tiles.\n\nAlong the 8-meter width: 8 divided by 4 is 2 tiles.\n\nSo, 3 tiles along the length and 2 tiles along the width would cover the entire floor perfectly without any need to cut tiles. That seems correct.\n\nBut is there a larger tile that could be used? Let's see, if I tried a 5-meter tile, for example:\n\n12 divided by 5 is 2.4, which is not a whole number, so I'd need to cut tiles, which is not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, 6 meters:\n\n12 divided by 6 is 2, which is fine, but 8 divided by 6 is approximately 1.333, which is not a whole number, so again, cutting would be necessary.\n\n7 meters:\n\n12 divided by 7 is approximately 1.714, and 8 divided by 7 is approximately 1.142, neither of which are whole numbers.\n\n8 meters:\n\n12 divided by 8 is 1.5, and 8 divided by 8 is 1, but 1.5 is not a whole number.\n\n9 meters and above would not even fit once in the 12-meter length.\n\nSo, indeed, 4 meters is the largest possible tile size that fits perfectly without needing to be cut.\n\nAlternatively, I could have approached this using the concept of the greatest common divisor (GCD) right from the start, as I initially thought. The GCD of the length and width of the room will give me the largest tile size possible.\n\nTo find the GCD of 12 and 8, I can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is more efficient, especially for larger numbers.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly applying the following step:\n\nDivide the larger number by the smaller number and take the remainder. Then replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder. Repeat this until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\nSo, for 12 and 8:\n\n12 divided by 8 is 1 with a remainder of 4.\n\nNow, replace 12 with 8 and 8 with 4.\n\n8 divided by 4 is 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 4.\n\nThis confirms my earlier result.\n\nI think that's the correct approach and answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there a possibility that using a tile size that's not a divisor of both dimensions could still work without cutting tiles? For example, if the tiles don't align perfectly with the room's dimensions but still cover the floor completely.\n\nI don't think that's possible without cutting tiles. Each tile must fit entirely within the room's boundaries, and since the room is rectangular, the tile sizes need to divide both the length and the width evenly.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the problem in terms of the least common multiple (LCM). But I'm not sure that directly applies here.\n\nWait, actually, if I consider the tile size 's', and I want both 12/s and 8/s to be integers, then 's' must be a common divisor of 12 and 8, which brings me back to the GCD.\n\nI think the GCD is indeed the way to go.\n\nJust to explore a bit more, suppose the room dimensions were larger or more complicated. How would I approach it then?\n\nFor example, if the room was 24 meters by 36 meters, the GCD of 24 and 36 is 12, so the largest tile size would be 12 meters.\n\nBut in that case, 24 divided by 12 is 2, and 36 divided by 12 is 3, so you'd have a grid of 2 by 3 tiles.\n\nSimilarly, in my original problem, 12 by 8 meters, GCD is 4 meters, and 12/4=3, 8/4=2, so 3 by 2 tiles.\n\nIt seems consistent.\n\nLet me consider if the room dimensions were not whole numbers, say 12.5 meters by 8.2 meters. How would that affect the tile size?\n\nIn that case, I'd probably need to convert the measurements to centimeters to avoid decimals, making it 1250 cm by 820 cm.\n\nThen, find the GCD of 1250 and 820.\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nFirst, find the GCD of 1250 and 820.\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n1250 divided by 820 is 1 with a remainder of 430.\n\n820 divided by 430 is 1 with a remainder of 390.\n\n430 divided by 390 is 1 with a remainder of 40.\n\n390 divided by 40 is 9 with a remainder of 30.\n\n40 divided by 30 is 1 with a remainder of 10.\n\n30 divided by 10 is 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSo, the GCD is 10 cm.\n\nTherefore, the largest tile size would be 10 cm by 10 cm.\n\nConverting back to meters, that's 0.1 meters.\n\nBut in my original problem, the dimensions are in meters and are whole numbers, so sticking with meters is fine.\n\nI think I've confirmed that the largest tile size is 4 meters by 4 meters.\n\nJust one more thing: ensure that the tiles cover the entire floor without any gaps or overlaps.\n\nGiven that the tiles are square and their sizes divide both the length and width of the room, there should be no gaps or overlaps, assuming the tiles are placed properly.\n\nSo, I'm confident with the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
