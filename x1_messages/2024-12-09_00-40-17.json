        "content": "Let's tackle this expression step by step. The expression given is (3^2 * 4) / (2 * 6 - 4). Okay, so first things first, I need to remember the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nStarting with the numerator: 3^2 * 4.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the exponent: 3^2. That's 3 multiplied by itself, which is 9. So, 3^2 = 9.\n\nNow, multiply that by 4: 9 * 4 = 36.\n\nSo, the numerator simplifies to 36.\n\nNow, let's look at the denominator: 2 * 6 - 4.\n\nAccording to PEMDAS, I need to do multiplication before subtraction. So, first, multiply 2 by 6: 2 * 6 = 12.\n\nThen, subtract 4 from 12: 12 - 4 = 8.\n\nSo, the denominator simplifies to 8.\n\nNow, the expression is simply 36 / 8.\n\nDividing 36 by 8 gives me 4.5.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\n36 divided by 8 is indeed 4.5.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 36 divided by 8 is 4 with a remainder of 4, which is 4 and 4/8, which simplifies to 4.5.\n\nSo, the final answer is 4.5.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet's go through it again.\n\nNumerator: 3^2 * 4.\n\n3^2 is 9, 9 * 4 is 36. That seems correct.\n\nDenominator: 2 * 6 - 4.\n\n2 * 6 is 12, 12 - 4 is 8. That's correct.\n\nThen, 36 / 8 is 4.5. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can simplify 36/8 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4, which gives 9/2, and 9 divided by 2 is 4.5.\n\nSo, definitely, the answer is 4.5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4.5} \\]"
