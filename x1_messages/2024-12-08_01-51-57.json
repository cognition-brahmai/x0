        "content": "Alright, I'm going to guide you through creating a simple Node.js application that fetches weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API for a specified city and displays the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Sounds good?\n\nFirst things first, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed yet, you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Make sure to install the LTS version for stability.\n\nOnce you have Node.js installed, let's set up a new project. Open your terminal or command prompt and create a new directory for your project. Let's call it \"weather-app\".\n\n```bash\nmkdir weather-app\ncd weather-app\n```\n\nNow, initialize a new Node.js project by running:\n\n```bash\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nThis command creates a `package.json` file with default settings, which helps manage your project's dependencies.\n\nNext, you'll need to install some dependencies. For making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API, we can use the `axios` library, which is promises-based and easy to use. Additionally, we'll need the `dotenv` package to manage environment variables, which is a good practice for handling API keys.\n\nInstall these packages by running:\n\n```bash\nnpm install axios dotenv\n```\n\nNow, sign up for a free account on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to get an API key. Once you have your API key, create a `.env` file in your project directory to store it.\n\nCreate a `.env` file:\n\n```plaintext\nOPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n```\n\nReplace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.\n\nNext, create an `index.js` file in your project directory. This will be the main entry point for your application.\n\nOpen `index.js` and require the necessary modules:\n\n```javascript\nrequire('dotenv').config();\nconst axios = require('axios');\n```\n\nNow, let's write a function to fetch the weather data. We'll need to make an HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API endpoint.\n\nFirst, define the base URL for the API:\n\n```javascript\nconst baseUrl = 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather';\n```\n\nThen, create an asynchronous function to fetch the weather data:\n\n```javascript\nasync function getWeather(city) {\n  try {\n    const response = await axios.get(baseUrl, {\n      params: {\n        q: city,\n       appid: process.env.OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY,\n        units: 'metric' // Use 'imperial' for Fahrenheit\n      }\n    });\n    return response.data;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error fetching weather data:', error.message);\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this function, we're using `axios.get` to make a request to the API with the city name and API key as query parameters. We're also specifying the units as 'metric' for Celsius; if you prefer Fahrenheit, you can change it to 'imperial'.\n\nNow, let's write a function to display the weather information:\n\n```javascript\nfunction displayWeather(data) {\n  if (data) {\n    console.log(`Temperature: ${data.main.temp}\u00b0C`);\n    console.log(`Humidity: ${data.main.humidity}%`);\n    console.log(`Wind Speed: ${data.wind.speed} m/s`);\n  } else {\n    console.log('Failed to fetch weather data.');\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis function checks if the data is fetched successfully and then logs the temperature, humidity, and wind speed to the console.\n\nFinally, let's put it all together. You can ask the user for a city name and then call the `getWeather` function with that city and display the results.\n\nHere's how you can do it using the `readline` module, which is a built-in Node.js module for reading input synchronously:\n\nFirst, require the `readline` module:\n\n```javascript\nconst readline = require('readline').createInterface({\n  input: process.stdin,\n  output: process.stdout\n});\n```\n\nThen, ask the user for the city name:\n\n```javascript\nreadline.question('Enter the city name: ', async (city) => {\n  const weatherData = await getWeather(city);\n  displayWeather(weatherData);\n  readline.close();\n});\n```\n\nThis code creates an interface for reading from stdin and writing to stdout. It prompts the user to enter a city name, awaits the input, calls the `getWeather` function with the provided city, and then displays the weather data.\n\nPutting it all together, your `index.js` should look like this:\n\n```javascript\nrequire('dotenv').config();\nconst axios = require('axios');\nconst readline = require('readline').createInterface({\n  input: process.stdin,\n  output: process.stdout\n});\n\nconst baseUrl = 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather';\n\nasync function getWeather(city) {\n  try {\n    const response = await axios.get(baseUrl, {\n      params: {\n        q: city,\n        appid: process.env.OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY,\n        units: 'metric' // Use 'imperial' for Fahrenheit\n      }\n    });\n    return response.data;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error fetching weather data:', error.message);\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n\nfunction displayWeather(data) {\n  if (data) {\n    console.log(`Temperature: ${data.main.temp}\u00b0C`);\n    console.log(`Humidity: ${data.main.humidity}%`);\n    console.log(`Wind Speed: ${data.wind.speed} m/s`);\n  } else {\n    console.log('Failed to fetch weather data.');\n  }\n}\n\nreadline.question('Enter the city name: ', async (city) => {\n  const weatherData = await getWeather(city);\n  displayWeather(weatherData);\n  readline.close();\n});\n```\n\nTo run your application, simply execute the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nnode index.js\n```\n\nYou should see a prompt asking for a city name. Enter the name of the city, and the application will fetch and display the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed for that city.\n\nThat's it! You've created a simple Node.js command-line application that fetches and displays weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API.\n\nIf you want to enhance this application, you could add error handling for invalid city names, support for multiple units, or even extend it to display more detailed weather information. The OpenWeatherMap API offers a wealth of data, so the possibilities are endless.\n\nHappy coding!"
