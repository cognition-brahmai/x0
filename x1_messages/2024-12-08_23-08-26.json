        "content": "The toy you're referring to is Barbie, a fashion doll created by Ruth Handler in 1959. The doll was named after Handler's daughter, Barbara, and was inspired by a German doll called Bild Lilli. Barbie's full name is Barbara Millicent Roberts, and she was introduced at the New York Toy Fair in 1959 as a 11.5-inch fashion doll with adult features, which was a departure from the baby dolls that were popular at the time. Barbie was designed to encourage girls to imagine and plan for future careers and adult lifestyles. Over the years, Barbie has become one of the best-selling toys worldwide and has been subject to various controversies and criticisms regarding body image and gender roles."
