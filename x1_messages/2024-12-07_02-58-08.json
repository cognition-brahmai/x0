        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a class of 40 students, and 60% of them are female. First, I need to find out how many female students there are.\n\nTo do that, I'll calculate 60% of 40. Percentage means per hundred, so 60% is the same as 60/100 or 0.6. Multiplying 0.6 by 40 gives me the number of female students.\n\n0.6 * 40 = 24\n\nSo, there are 24 female students in the class.\n\nNext, I'm told that 75% of these females have brown eyes. Now, I need to find out how many that is. Again, percentage means per hundred, so 75% is 75/100 or 0.75. I'll multiply 0.75 by the number of female students, which is 24.\n\n0.75 * 24 = 18\n\nTherefore, 18 female students have brown eyes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of fractions. 60% is the same as 3/5, since 60 divided by 20 is 3, and 100 divided by 20 is 5. So, 3/5 of the class are females.\n\nSimilarly, 75% is the same as 3/4. So, 3/4 of the female students have brown eyes.\n\nFirst, find the number of females: 3/5 of 40 is (3/5)*40 = 24, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, 3/4 of 24 is (3/4)*24 = 18.\n\nSo, again, 18 female students have brown eyes.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find 75% of 60%. So, what's 75% of 60%? Well, that's 0.75 times 0.6, which is 0.45, or 45%. So, 45% of the total class are female students with brown eyes.\n\nNow, 45% of 40 is 0.45*40 = 18.\n\nOnce more, I get 18.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any other approach. Let's consider the total number of students with brown eyes, but wait, the question only asks for the number of female students with brown eyes, not total students with brown eyes. So, I don't need to consider the males for this part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use proportions. If 60% are female, and 75% of those have brown eyes, then the proportion of female students with brown eyes is 0.75*0.6 = 0.45, or 45% of the total class, which is 45/100*40 = 18.\n\n\u53c8\u4e00\u904d\uff0c\u6211\u8fd8\u662f\u5f97\u523018\u3002\n\n\u6216\u8005\uff0c\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbe\u672a\u77e5\u6570\u6765\u89e3\u3002\u8bbe\u603b\u5b66\u751f\u6570\u4e3ax\uff0cx=40\u3002\n\n\u5973\u6027\u5b66\u751f\u6570 = 0.6x\n\n\u5973\u6027\u4e2d\u68d5\u8272\u773c\u775b\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b = 0.75\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u4e2d\u68d5\u8272\u773c\u775b\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6570 = 0.75 * 0.6x = 0.45x\n\n\u4ee3\u5165x=40\uff0c0.45*40=18\u3002\n\n\u8fd8\u662f18\u3002\n\n\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b54\u6848\u662f\u5bf9\u7684\u3002\n\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u6ca1\u6709\u54ea\u91cc\u9519\u4e86\uff0c\u8ba9\u6211\u518d\u68c0\u67e5\u4e00\u4e0b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u603b\u5b66\u751f\u6570\u662f40\u3002\n\n60%\u662f\u5973\u6027\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5973\u6027\u5b66\u751f\u6570\u662f0.6*40=24\u3002\n\n\u7136\u540e\uff0c75%\u7684\u5973\u6027\u6709\u68d5\u8272\u773c\u775b\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u68d5\u8272\u773c\u775b\u7684\u5973\u6027\u5b66\u751f\u6570\u662f0.75*24=18\u3002\n\n\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u6ca1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\n\u6216\u8005\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u603b\u5171\u670924\u4e2a\u5973\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d75%\u6709\u68d5\u8272\u773c\u775b\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u6ca1\u6709\u68d5\u8272\u773c\u775b\u7684\u5973\u6027\u662f25%\uff0c\u53730.25*24=6\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u5b66\u751f\u4e2d\uff0c18\u6709\u68d5\u8272\u773c\u775b\uff0c6\u6ca1\u6709\u3002\n\n\u603b\u52a0\u8d77\u6765\u662f24\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u524d\u9762\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u5e94\u8be5\u662f18\u3002\n\n\u6211\u786e\u5b9a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b54\u6848\u662f\u5bf9\u7684\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
