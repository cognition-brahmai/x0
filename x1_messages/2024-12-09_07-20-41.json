        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is (5 * 4^2 - 8) / (3 * 2 + 1). First, I need to handle the exponentiation, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction, following the order of operations, often remembered by PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).\n\nSo, starting with the exponentiation:\n\n4^2 = 16\n\nNow, plug that back into the expression:\n\n(5 * 16 - 8) / (3 * 2 + 1)\n\nNext, perform the multiplications:\n\n5 * 16 = 80\n\n3 * 2 = 6\n\nSo now the expression is:\n\n(80 - 8) / (6 + 1)\n\nThen, do the subtraction and addition inside the parentheses:\n\n80 - 8 = 72\n\n6 + 1 = 7\n\nSo now it's:\n\n72 / 7\n\nDividing 72 by 7 gives approximately 10.2857, or in fraction form, it's 72/7.\n\nSo, the final answer is 72/7 or approximately 10.2857."
