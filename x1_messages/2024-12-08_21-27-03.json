        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of items: Item A costs $4 each and Item B costs $7 each. The customer buys a total of 15 items and spends $72. We need to find out how many of each item they bought.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of Item A bought.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of Item B bought.\n\nNow, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of items bought is 15. That means:\n\n\\[ x + y = 15 \\]\n\n2. The total amount spent is $72. Since Item A costs $4 each and Item B costs $7 each, we can write:\n\n\\[ 4x + 7y = 72 \\]\n\nSo, now we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 15 \\)\n\n2. \\( 4x + 7y = 72 \\)\n\nWe need to solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nOne way to solve this is by using the substitution method. Let's solve the first equation for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = 15 - y \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 4(15 - y) + 7y = 72 \\]\n\nLet's simplify this:\n\n\\[ 60 - 4y + 7y = 72 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 60 + 3y = 72 \\]\n\nNow, subtract 60 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 3y = 12 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ y = 4 \\]\n\nSo, the number of Item B bought is 4.\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation \\( x = 15 - y \\):\n\n\\[ x = 15 - 4 = 11 \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 11 items of Item A and 4 items of Item B.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it's correct. If they bought 11 items of Item A at $4 each, that's:\n\n\\[ 11 \\times 4 = 44 \\]\n\nAnd 4 items of Item B at $7 each:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 7 = 28 \\]\n\nAdding these together:\n\n\\[ 44 + 28 = 72 \\]\n\nThat matches the total amount spent. Also, the total number of items is:\n\n\\[ 11 + 4 = 15 \\]\n\nWhich matches the total number of items bought. So, our solution is correct.\n\nAnother way to solve this is by using the elimination method. Let's see how that works.\n\nWe have the same two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 15 \\)\n\n2. \\( 4x + 7y = 72 \\)\n\nLet's multiply the first equation by 4 to make the coefficients of \\( x \\) the same:\n\n\\[ 4x + 4y = 60 \\]\n\nNow, subtract this new equation from the second equation:\n\n\\[ (4x + 7y) - (4x + 4y) = 72 - 60 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ 3y = 12 \\]\n\nSo, \\( y = 4 \\), which matches what we found earlier.\n\nThen, substitute \\( y = 4 \\) back into the first equation:\n\n\\[ x + 4 = 15 \\]\n\nThus, \\( x = 11 \\).\n\nAgain, we get the same result: 11 items of Item A and 4 items of Item B.\n\nSo, no matter which method we use, we end up with the same answer. That gives us more confidence that it's correct.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using matrices?\n\nYes, we can represent the system of equations using matrices. The system is:\n\n\\[ \\begin{cases} x + y = 15 \\\\ 4x + 7y = 72 \\end{cases} \\]\n\nIn matrix form, this is:\n\n\\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 4 & 7 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 15 \\\\ 72 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we can find the inverse of the coefficient matrix and multiply both sides by it.\n\nFirst, find the determinant of the coefficient matrix:\n\n\\[ \\text{det} = (1)(7) - (1)(4) = 7 - 4 = 3 \\]\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse exists.\n\nThe inverse of a 2x2 matrix \\( \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix} \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{ad - bc} \\begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\\\ -c & a \\end{bmatrix} \\).\n\nSo, the inverse is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{bmatrix} 7 & -1 \\\\ -4 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nNow, multiply both sides by this inverse matrix:\n\n\\[ \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{bmatrix} 7 & -1 \\\\ -4 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 15 \\\\ 72 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nPerform the matrix multiplication:\n\nFirst row:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} (7 \\times 15 + (-1) \\times 72) = \\frac{1}{3} (105 - 72) = \\frac{1}{3} (33) = 11 \\]\n\nSecond row:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} (-4 \\times 15 + 1 \\times 72) = \\frac{1}{3} (-60 + 72) = \\frac{1}{3} (12) = 4 \\]\n\nSo, again, we get \\( x = 11 \\) and \\( y = 4 \\).\n\nThis is consistent with our previous methods, which is reassuring.\n\nLet me consider if there's a way to solve this problem without algebra, maybe using logic or trial and error.\n\nSuppose we assume all 15 items are Item A. Then the total cost would be:\n\n\\[ 15 \\times 4 = 60 \\]\n\nBut the actual total is $72, which is $12 more than $60.\n\nNow, each time we replace an Item A with an Item B, we gain $3 (since Item B costs $7 and Item A costs $4, the difference is $3).\n\nSo, to make up the $12 difference, we need to replace \\( \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\) items of A with B.\n\nTherefore, the number of Item B is 4, and the number of Item A is \\( 15 - 4 = 11 \\), which matches our previous results.\n\nThis is a nice straightforward logical approach that doesn't require algebra.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume all 15 items are Item B, the total cost would be:\n\n\\[ 15 \\times 7 = 105 \\]\n\nBut the actual total is $72, which is $33 less than $105.\n\nEach time we replace an Item B with an Item A, we lose $3 (since Item A costs $4 and Item B costs $7, the difference is $3).\n\nSo, to make up the $33 difference, we need to replace \\( \\frac{33}{3} = 11 \\) items of B with A.\n\nTherefore, the number of Item A is 11, and the number of Item B is \\( 15 - 11 = 4 \\), which again confirms our previous answers.\n\nThis logical approach is useful for understanding the relationship between the prices and the quantities.\n\nNow, let's think about whether there could be other solutions or if this is the only possible combination.\n\nGiven that the number of items must be non-negative integers, and from the equations, there's only one solution that satisfies both equations: 11 items of A and 4 items of B.\n\nTo see why, consider that if we try to buy a different number of Item B, say 3, then the number of Item A would be 12 (since \\( x + y = 15 \\)), and the total cost would be:\n\n\\[ 12 \\times 4 + 3 \\times 7 = 48 + 21 = 69 \\]\n\nWhich is less than $72.\n\nSimilarly, if we buy 5 items of B, then 10 items of A:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 4 + 5 \\times 7 = 40 + 35 = 75 \\]\n\nWhich is more than $72.\n\nSo, only 11 items of A and 4 items of B give the total of $72.\n\nTherefore, the solution is unique.\n\nAnother way to confirm this is to look at the equations. Since the two equations are linearly independent (one is not a multiple of the other), they intersect at exactly one point, which is the solution we found.\n\nNow, let's consider if there's a way to generalize this problem. Suppose we have two items costing \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) dollars, and we buy \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) of them respectively, with a total of \\( n \\) items and a total cost of \\( c \\) dollars.\n\nThe system would be:\n\n1. \\( x + y = n \\)\n\n2. \\( p x + q y = c \\)\n\nWe can solve this system similarly to find \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nIn our specific case, \\( p = 4 \\), \\( q = 7 \\), \\( n = 15 \\), and \\( c = 72 \\).\n\nSo, the general solution would be:\n\nFrom the first equation: \\( x = n - y \\)\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\n\\( p(n - y) + q y = c \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( p n - p y + q y = c \\)\n\n\\( (q - p) y = c - p n \\)\n\nThen:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{c - p n}{q - p} \\)\n\nAnd:\n\n\\( x = n - y \\)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{72 - 4 \\times 15}{7 - 4} = \\frac{72 - 60}{3} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\)\n\n\\( x = 15 - 4 = 11 \\)\n\nWhich again confirms our solution.\n\nThis general form is useful for solving similar problems with different prices and totals.\n\nNow, let's think about possible variations or extensions of this problem.\n\nFor example, what if there were more than two types of items? Then, we would have more variables and more equations, making the system more complex.\n\nOr, what if the number of items wasn't specified, only the total cost? Then, there would be multiple solutions depending on the combination of items bought.\n\nAlso, in real-life scenarios, there might be constraints such as limited stock or minimum purchase requirements, which would add additional constraints to the system.\n\nMoreover, if there were discounts or special offers, the cost equations could become more complicated.\n\nBut for this specific problem, we've found the solution: 11 items of Item A and 4 items of Item B.\n\nI hope this detailed explanation helps in understanding how to approach and solve such problems.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11 \\text{ items of Item A and } 4 \\text{ items of Item B}} \\]"
