        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here. It says that in a town, 60% of the population are vegetarians and 40% are non-vegetarians. Among the vegetarians, 70% prefer tea over coffee, and among the non-vegetarians, 80% prefer coffee over tea. I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen person from the town prefers tea.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand the information given:\n\n- Vegetarians: 60% of the population\n\n- Non-vegetarians: 40% of the population\n\nAmong vegetarians:\n\n- Prefer tea: 70%\n\n- Prefer coffee: 30% (since 100% - 70% = 30%)\n\nAmong non-vegetarians:\n\n- Prefer coffee: 80%\n\n- Prefer tea: 20% (since 100% - 80% = 20%)\n\nI need to find the overall probability that a randomly chosen person prefers tea.\n\nI think I can use the law of total probability for this. The law of total probability allows me to calculate the total probability of an event by considering all possible scenarios.\n\nSo, in this case, the two scenarios are:\n\n1. The person is a vegetarian.\n\n2. The person is a non-vegetarian.\n\nThe probability that a person prefers tea is the sum of the probabilities of preferring tea in each scenario, weighted by the probability of each scenario.\n\nMathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nP(Tea) = P(Tea | Vegetarian) * P(Vegetarian) + P(Tea | Non-vegetarian) * P(Non-vegetarian)\n\nWhere:\n\n- P(Tea | Vegetarian) is the probability of preferring tea given that the person is a vegetarian.\n\n- P(Vegetarian) is the probability of being a vegetarian.\n\n- P(Tea | Non-vegetarian) is the probability of preferring tea given that the person is a non-vegetarian.\n\n- P(Non-vegetarian) is the probability of being a non-vegetarian.\n\nFrom the information given:\n\n- P(Vegetarian) = 60% = 0.6\n\n- P(Non-vegetarian) = 40% = 0.4\n\n- P(Tea | Vegetarian) = 70% = 0.7\n\n- P(Tea | Non-vegetarian) = 20% = 0.2\n\nNow, plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(Tea) = (0.7 * 0.6) + (0.2 * 0.4)\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n\n0.7 * 0.6 = 0.42\n\n0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n0.42 + 0.08 = 0.50\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen person prefers tea is 0.50, or 50%.\n\nWait a minute, does this make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nFirst, 60% of the population are vegetarians, and 70% of them prefer tea. So, 0.7 * 0.6 = 0.42, which means 42% of the total population are vegetarians who prefer tea.\n\nNext, 40% of the population are non-vegetarians, and 20% of them prefer tea. So, 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08, which means 8% of the total population are non-vegetarians who prefer tea.\n\nAdding these two groups together: 42% + 8% = 50% of the total population prefers tea.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of actual numbers to verify. Suppose the town has 1000 people.\n\n- Vegetarians: 60% of 1000 = 600 people\n\n- Non-vegetarians: 40% of 1000 = 400 people\n\nAmong vegetarians:\n\n- Prefer tea: 70% of 600 = 420 people\n\n- Prefer coffee: 30% of 600 = 180 people\n\nAmong non-vegetarians:\n\n- Prefer coffee: 80% of 400 = 320 people\n\n- Prefer tea: 20% of 400 = 80 people\n\nTotal people who prefer tea: 420 (vegetarians) + 80 (non-vegetarians) = 500 people\n\nTotal population: 1000 people\n\nProbability that a randomly chosen person prefers tea: 500/1000 = 0.50 or 50%\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.50} \\]"
