        "content": "Let's see what's going on here. So, Emily and Sarah are sisters who share a room with two closets: one pink and one purple. Emily keeps her favorite dress in the pink closet, and Sarah keeps hers in the purple closet. Then, their mom decides to switch the contents of the closets without telling them. Later, they both need to get dressed for a party, and we need to figure out where each girl will look for her favorite dress and where they will actually find them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the initial setup. There are two closets: pink and purple. Emily's favorite dress is in the pink closet, and Sarah's is in the purple closet. Simple enough.\n\nNow, their mom switches the contents of the closets. So, what does that mean? If the contents are switched, that probably means that everything from the pink closet is moved to the purple closet, and everything from the purple closet is moved to the pink closet. So, after the switch, Emily's favorite dress, which was in the pink closet, is now in the purple closet, and Sarah's favorite dress, which was in the purple closet, is now in the pink closet.\n\nOkay, so after the switch:\n\n- Pink closet now has Sarah's favorite dress.\n\n- Purple closet now has Emily's favorite dress.\n\nNow, later that evening, both girls need to get dressed for a party. They haven't been told about the switch, so they still think their dresses are in their usual places.\n\nSo, Emily will look in the pink closet for her favorite dress, because that's where she always keeps it. But since the contents were switched, her dress is actually in the purple closet now.\n\nSimilarly, Sarah will look in the purple closet for her favorite dress, because that's where she always keeps hers. But again, due to the switch, her dress is now in the pink closet.\n\nSo, to sum it up:\n\n- Emily will look in the pink closet but will find Sarah's dress there.\n\n- Sarah will look in the purple closet but will find Emily's dress there.\n\nThen, I guess they might be confused and realize something is amiss. They might check the other closet to see if their dress is there instead.\n\nSo, if Emily doesn't find her dress in the pink closet, she might think, \"Wait, maybe I misremembered and put it in the purple closet.\" So she goes to the purple closet and finds her dress there.\n\nSimilarly, Sarah doesn't find her dress in the purple closet, so she might think, \"Maybe I left it in the pink closet by mistake.\" So she goes to the pink closet and finds her dress there.\n\nAlternatively, they might check the other closet immediately upon not finding it in the usual place.\n\nBut based on the initial question, it's just about where they will look and where they will actually find their dresses.\n\nSo, to answer:\n\nEach girl will look in their usual closet for their favorite dress, but due to the switch, they will find the other's dress there. They will then need to look in the other closet to find their own dress.\n\nSo, Emily looks in the pink closet, finds Sarah's dress, then looks in the purple closet and finds her own dress.\n\nSarah looks in the purple closet, finds Emily's dress, then looks in the pink closet and finds her own dress.\n\nUnless, of course, they communicate with each other or their mom tells them about the switch. But the question doesn't mention any communication, so I'll assume they figure it out on their own.\n\nWait a minute, maybe their mom told them about the switch, but the question doesn't specify. Let me check the question again.\n\n\"No, their mom switches the contents without telling them.\" So, the girls are unaware of the switch.\n\nTherefore, they will look in their usual closets, not finding their own dresses, and then have to look in the other closet to find them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a system or know that their mom might have switched things, but again, the question doesn't indicate that.\n\nSo, in conclusion:\n\n- Emily looks in the pink closet, finds Sarah's dress, then looks in the purple closet and finds her own dress.\n\n- Sarah looks in the purple closet, finds Emily's dress, then looks in the pink closet and finds her own dress.\n\nUnless they decide to look in the other closet first or communicate with each other, but based on the information provided, that's the likely sequence of events.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Emily looks in the pink closet for her dress but finds Sarah's; she then looks in the purple closet and finds her own dress. Sarah looks in the purple closet for her dress but finds Emily's; she then looks in the pink closet and finds her own dress.}} \\]"
