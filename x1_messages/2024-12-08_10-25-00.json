        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a farmer has a rectangular field that's 300 meters long and 200 meters wide, and he wants to divide it into square plots with equal side lengths, without wasting any land. I need to figure out the largest possible size for each square plot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to divide the field into square plots without wasting any land. That means that each square plot should fit perfectly into the field, both in length and width, without any leftover space.\n\nSo, the side length of each square plot has to be a divisor of both the length and the width of the field. In other words, it needs to be a common divisor of 300 and 200.\n\nAnd since the farmer wants the largest possible square plots, I'm looking for the largest common divisor of 300 and 200.\n\nAh, so this is about finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 300 and 200.\n\nI remember that the GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.\n\nSo, to find the GCD of 300 and 200, I can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient way to compute the GCD.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly applying the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.\n\nLet me try applying it here.\n\nFirst, divide 300 by 200. 300 divided by 200 is 1, with a remainder of 100.\n\nThen, replace 300 with 200 and 200 with the remainder, which is 100.\n\nNow, divide 200 by 100. 200 divided by 100 is 2, with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the GCD is the divisor at this step, which is 100.\n\nSo, the GCD of 300 and 200 is 100.\n\nThat means the largest possible size for each square plot is 100 meters by 100 meters.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf each square plot is 100 meters on each side, then the number of square plots along the length of the field would be 300 divided by 100, which is 3.\n\nAlong the width, it would be 200 divided by 100, which is 2.\n\nSo, the field would be divided into 3 times 2, which is 6, square plots of 100 meters by 100 meters.\n\nAnd since 100 is the GCD, there shouldn't be any wasted land.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's consider if there's a larger square size that could be used.\n\nSuppose I choose a square plot size of 200 meters. But 200 meters doesn't divide evenly into the length of 300 meters because 300 divided by 200 is 1.5, which is not an integer.\n\nSo, that would leave unused land, which we don't want.\n\nSimilarly, if I choose 150 meters, 300 divided by 150 is 2, which is fine, but 200 divided by 150 is approximately 1.333, which is not an integer, so again, land would be wasted.\n\nWait, but 150 is not a divisor of 200, so that makes sense.\n\nWhat about 50 meters? 300 divided by 50 is 6, and 200 divided by 50 is 4. That would work, but 50 is smaller than 100, so 100 is indeed larger.\n\nWhat about 200 meters? As I thought earlier, it doesn't divide evenly into 300 meters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at the prime factors of 300 and 200 to confirm the GCD.\n\nLet's factorize both numbers.\n\n300 can be factored into 2 times 150, which is 2 times 2 times 75, which is 2 times 2 times 3 times 25, which is 2 times 2 times 3 times 5 times 5, so 300 = 2^2 * 3 * 5^2.\n\nSimilarly, 200 can be factored into 2 times 100, which is 2 times 2 times 50, which is 2 times 2 times 2 times 25, which is 2 times 2 times 2 times 5 times 5, so 200 = 2^3 * 5^2.\n\nThe GCD is the product of the lowest powers of the common prime factors, which are 2 and 5.\n\nSo, GCD = 2^2 * 5^2 = 4 * 25 = 100.\n\nYes, that confirms that the GCD is indeed 100.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible size for each square plot is 100 meters by 100 meters.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
