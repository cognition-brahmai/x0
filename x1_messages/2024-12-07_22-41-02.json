        "content": "So the total cost of the vacation rental is $1200, and each friend is contributing $150. We need to find out how many friends are in the group.\n\nTo solve this, we can set up a simple equation. Let's let \\( n \\) represent the number of friends. Since the cost is being split evenly, each person pays the same amount, which is $150.\n\nSo, the total cost is equal to the number of friends multiplied by the contribution per friend:\n\n\\[\n\\text{total cost} = n \\times \\text{contribution per friend}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\[\n1200 = n \\times 150\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to solve for \\( n \\). To isolate \\( n \\), we can divide both sides of the equation by 150:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{1200}{150}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the right side:\n\n\\[\nn = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 8 friends in the group.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure. If 8 friends each contribute $150, the total would be:\n\n\\[\n8 \\times 150 = 1200\n\\]\n\nYes, that matches the total cost. So, the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could think of it in terms of division. The total cost is $1200, and each person pays $150, so the number of people is the total cost divided by the individual contribution:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{1200}{150} = 8\n\\]\n\nSame result.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider how many $150 contributions make up $1200. Again, dividing 1200 by 150 gives us 8.\n\nSo, no matter which approach we take, we end up with 8 friends in the group.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
