        "content": "To find the area of the room in square meters, we first need to calculate the area in square feet and then convert that to square meters.\n\nThe area in square feet is calculated by multiplying the length by the width:\n\n\\[ \\text{area}_{\\text{sq ft}} = 15 \\, \\text{ft} \\times 20 \\, \\text{ft} = 300 \\, \\text{sq ft} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert square feet to square meters. We know that:\n\n\\[ 1 \\, \\text{square foot} = 0.092903 \\, \\text{square meters} \\]\n\nSo, to convert 300 square feet to square meters:\n\n\\[ \\text{area}_{\\text{sq m}} = 300 \\, \\text{sq ft} \\times 0.092903 \\, \\text{sq m/sq ft} \\]\n\nLet's do the multiplication:\n\n\\[ \\text{area}_{\\text{sq m}} = 300 \\times 0.092903 = 27.8709 \\, \\text{sq m} \\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the room is approximately 27.87 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{27.87} \\]"
