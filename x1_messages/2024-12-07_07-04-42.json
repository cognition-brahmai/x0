        "content": "So there's this car rental company with 12 cars in total. Out of these, 4 are red, 6 are blue, and 2 are green. Now, if a customer picks a car at random, we need to find out the probability that they choose either a red or a green car.\n\nFirst, I think I should recall what probability means. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are picking a red or a green car, and the total outcomes are picking any car from the 12 available.\n\nLet me note down the numbers:\n\n- Total cars: 12\n\n- Red cars: 4\n\n- Blue cars: 6\n\n- Green cars: 2\n\nNow, the customer wants either a red or a green car. So, the number of favorable cars is the red cars plus the green cars, which is 4 + 2 = 6.\n\nSo, the probability should be the number of favorable cars divided by the total number of cars, which is 6 divided by 12. That simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Is there another way to look at this?\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the probability of not picking a blue car, since the only other colors are red and green. So, if I calculate the probability of not picking a blue car, that should be the same as picking a red or green car.\n\nThe number of blue cars is 6, so the probability of picking a blue car is 6/12, which is also 1/2 or 0.5. Therefore, the probability of not picking a blue car would be 1 minus 0/2, which is also 1/2 or 0.5.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. So, it looks like the probability is 1/2.\n\nBut let me make sure I haven't missed anything. Is there any other factor that could affect the probability? For example, are there any restrictions on renting certain cars or anything like that? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I think it's safe to assume that all cars are equally likely to be chosen.\n\nAlso, I should confirm that the colors are mutually exclusive. That is, a car can't be both red and green or any other combination. The way it's presented, it seems like each car is only one color: 4 red, 6 blue, 2 green, adding up to 12.\n\nSo, no overlaps there.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the car is replaced or not after being chosen. But since it's a rental, once a car is chosen, it's rented out, so it's not replaced immediately. However, since the problem says \"at random\" and doesn't specify any conditions about multiple rentals or anything like that, I think it's safe to assume that it's a single selection from the available pool.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is that the probability of choosing a red or green car is 1/2 or 50%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
