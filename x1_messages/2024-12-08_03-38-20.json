        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 4 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. I need to find the probability of drawing two balls without replacement, and both balls should be the same color. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of balls in the box. There are 4 red, 3 blue, and 2 green, so total balls are 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 balls.\n\nNow, I'm drawing two balls without replacement, meaning once I draw the first ball, it doesn't go back into the box, so the second draw is from the remaining balls.\n\nI need both balls to be the same color, which means either both are red, both are blue, or both are green.\n\nSo, probably, I should calculate the probability for each case separately and then add them up.\n\nLet's start with both balls being red.\n\nThere are 4 red balls out of 9 total balls. So, the probability of drawing a red ball first is 4/9.\n\nAfter drawing one red ball, there are now 3 red balls left and total balls are 8.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a second red ball is 3/8.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both balls being red is (4/9) * (3/8).\n\nSimilarly, for both balls being blue:\n\nProbability of first ball being blue is 3/9, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nAfter drawing one blue ball, there are 2 blue balls left and total balls are 8.\n\nSo, the probability of second ball being blue is 2/8, which is 1/4.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both balls being blue is (1/3) * (1/4) = 1/12.\n\nNext, for both balls being green:\n\nProbability of first ball being green is 2/9.\n\nAfter drawing one green ball, there is 1 green ball left and total balls are 8.\n\nSo, the probability of second ball being green is 1/8.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both balls being green is (2/9) * (1/8) = 2/72, which simplifies to 1/36.\n\nNow, I need to add up these probabilities: red + blue + green.\n\nSo, (4/9)*(3/8) + (1/3)*(1/4) + (1/36).\n\nFirst, calculate (4/9)*(3/8):\n\n(4*3)/(9*8) = 12/72 = 1/6.\n\nThen, (1/3)*(1/4) = 1/12.\n\nAnd, (1/36) remains as is.\n\nNow, add them up: 1/6 + 1/12 + 1/36.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6, 12, and 36 is 36.\n\nSo, convert each fraction:\n\n1/6 = 6/36,\n\n1/12 = 3/36,\n\n1/36 = 1/36.\n\nNow, add them: 6/36 + 3/36 + 1/36 = 10/36.\n\nThis can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: 5/18.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing two balls of the same color without replacement is 5/18.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the total number of ways to draw two balls of the same color and divide by the total number of ways to draw any two balls.\n\nFirst, total number of ways to draw any two balls from 9 is C(9,2), which is 36.\n\nNow, number of ways to draw two red balls: C(4,2) = 6.\n\nTwo blue balls: C(3,2) = 3.\n\nTwo green balls: C(2,2) = 1.\n\nSo, total number of favorable outcomes: 6 + 3 + 1 = 10.\n\nTherefore, probability is 10/36, which simplifies to 5/18.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the final answer is 5/18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{18}} \\]"
