        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular garden that's currently 10 meters by 15 meters. That means its area is 10m * 15m = 150 square meters. The task is to increase this area by 50% while keeping the shape as a rectangle. So, first things first, what's 50% of 150 square meters? Well, 50% of 150 is 75 square meters. Therefore, the new area should be 150 + 75 = 225 square meters.\n\nNow, the garden has to remain a rectangle, which means that both length and width have to be positive real numbers, and importantly, they have to be proportional in some way if we're to maintain the rectangular shape. But the problem doesn't specify that the proportions have to stay the same, just that it should remain a rectangle. So, I think we have some flexibility here.\n\nLet me think about this. If we're to increase the area to 225 square meters while keeping it rectangular, we need to find pairs of numbers (length and width) that multiply to 225. Essentially, we're looking for all positive real number pairs (l, w) such that l * w = 225.\n\nBut, in practical terms, there might be constraints based on the available space or other factors, but since the problem doesn't mention any, I'll assume that any rectangular dimensions that give an area of 225 square meters are acceptable.\n\nLet me start by considering that we might want to keep one of the dimensions the same and change the other to achieve the new area.\n\n**Option 1: Keeping the width the same**\n\nIf we keep the width at 10 meters, then we can solve for the new length:\n\nNew area = length * width\n\n225 = length * 10\n\nLength = 225 / 10 = 22.5 meters\n\nSo, one possible new dimension is 22.5 meters by 10 meters.\n\n**Option 2: Keeping the length the same**\n\nAlternatively, if we keep the length at 15 meters, then:\n\n225 = width * 15\n\nWidth = 225 / 15 = 15 meters\n\nSo, another possible dimension is 15 meters by 15 meters. Wait a minute, that's actually a square, which is a special type of rectangle where length and width are equal.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, a square is acceptable since it's still a rectangle.\n\n**Option 3: Changing both dimensions proportionally**\n\nIf we want to maintain the same shape, meaning the ratio of length to width remains constant, then we need to scale both dimensions by the same factor.\n\nThe original ratio is 10:15, which simplifies to 2:3.\n\nSo, if we maintain that ratio, then the new dimensions should be in the same 2:3 ratio.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the new width as 2x and the new length as 3x.\n\nThen, the area would be:\n\n2x * 3x = 6x\u00b2 = 225\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 225 / 6 = 37.5\n\nx = sqrt(37.5) \u2248 6.124 meters\n\nTherefore, new width = 2x \u2248 12.248 meters\n\nAnd new length = 3x \u2248 18.372 meters\n\nSo, approximately 12.25 meters by 18.37 meters.\n\n**Option 4: Changing dimensions without maintaining the aspect ratio**\n\nWe could choose any two positive real numbers that multiply to 225, as long as they form a rectangle.\n\nFor example, let's say we want the new width to be 12 meters.\n\nThen, new length = 225 / 12 = 18.75 meters\n\nSo, 12 meters by 18.75 meters is another possible dimension.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose a new length of 20 meters, then:\n\nWidth = 225 / 20 = 11.25 meters\n\nSo, 20 meters by 11.25 meters is yet another option.\n\nIn fact, there are infinitely many such pairs, but these are a few examples.\n\n**Option 5: Maximizing one dimension while minimizing the other**\n\nSuppose we want to maximize the length while keeping the width as small as possible, or vice versa.\n\nFor example, if we make the width approach zero, the length would have to approach infinity to maintain the area of 225 square meters. However, this is not practical, so we can dismiss this as a feasible option.\n\nSimilarly, making the length very short would require an extremely wide garden, which might not be desirable or possible depending on the available space.\n\n**Option 6: Choosing dimensions based on practical considerations**\n\nIn reality, there might be constraints such as the available land, fencing requirements, or aesthetic preferences.\n\nFor instance, if the garden is against a wall, one dimension might be fixed.\n\nOr, if there are existing features in the garden that need to be preserved, the new dimensions might need to accommodate those.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't specify any such constraints, I'll proceed without considering them.\n\n**Option 7: Using geometric mean for balanced dimensions**\n\nAnother approach could be to choose dimensions that are as close as possible to each other, which would make the rectangle more square-like.\n\nThis might be desirable for aesthetic reasons or for efficient use of space.\n\nIn this case, the geometric mean of the area gives the side of a square with the same area.\n\nSo, side = sqrt(225) = 15 meters\n\nTherefore, a 15m by 15m square is one option, as already mentioned in Option 2.\n\n**Option 8: Considering perimeter minimization**\n\nIf we want to minimize the perimeter for a given area, the shape should be as close to a square as possible.\n\nThis is because, for a given area, the square has the smallest perimeter among all rectangles.\n\nSo, in this case, the 15m by 15m square would have the smallest perimeter: 4 * 15 = 60 meters.\n\nAny other rectangular dimensions would result in a larger perimeter.\n\nFor example, 10m by 22.5m would have a perimeter of 2*(10 + 22.5) = 65 meters.\n\nSimilarly, 12m by 18.75m would have a perimeter of 2*(12 + 18.75) = 61.5 meters.\n\nSo, if minimizing the perimeter is a goal, then the square dimensions are the best choice.\n\n**Option 9: Considering perimeter maximization**\n\nOn the other hand, if for some reason we wanted to maximize the perimeter, we could choose dimensions that are as different as possible, within the constraints of the area.\n\nFor example, making one dimension very long and the other very short.\n\nBut again, this seems impractical and unlikely to be a real-world requirement.\n\n**Option 10: Maintaining integer dimensions**\n\nSometimes, for construction or measurement purposes, it's desirable to have dimensions that are integer values.\n\nSo, among the possible pairs, we can look for pairs of integers that multiply to 225.\n\nFactors of 225 are: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 25, 45, 75, 225.\n\nSo, possible integer dimensions are:\n\n- 1m x 225m\n\n- 3m x 75m\n\n- 5m x 45m\n\n- 9m x 25m\n\n- 15m x 15m\n\n- 25m x 9m\n\n- 45m x 5m\n\n- 75m x 3m\n\n- 225m x 1m\n\nMost of these are not practical for a garden, as they would be either too narrow or too long, but in theory, they are possible.\n\n**Ranking the options:**\n\nNow, let's rank these options based on feasibility and practicality.\n\n1. **Option 3: Changing both dimensions proportionally**\n\n   - This maintains the original shape, which might be desirable.\n\n   - The new dimensions are approximately 12.25m by 18.37m, which seems balanced and practical.\n\n2. **Option 2: Keeping the length the same and making it a square**\n\n   - Results in a 15m by 15m square.\n\n   - This minimizes the perimeter, which might be advantageous for fencing or boundary considerations.\n\n   - However, changing the shape to a square might not be desirable if the original rectangular shape was preferred for some reason.\n\n3. **Option 1: Keeping the width the same**\n\n   - New dimensions: 10m by 22.5m.\n\n   - This could be practical if the width is constrained by some boundary, but the length can be extended.\n\n   - However, this makes the garden longer and narrower compared to the original.\n\n4. **Option 4: Changing dimensions without maintaining the aspect ratio**\n\n   - For example, 12m by 18.75m or 20m by 11.25m.\n\n   - These options provide flexibility in choosing dimensions based on specific needs or available space.\n\n   - However, they don't maintain the original shape, which might or might not be acceptable.\n\n5. **Option 7: Choosing dimensions based on geometric mean**\n\n   - This is essentially the same as Option 2, resulting in a square.\n\n6. **Option 8: Minimizing the perimeter**\n\n   - Again, this aligns with Option 2.\n\n7. **Option 9: Maximizing the perimeter**\n\n   - Not practical and unlikely to be desired.\n\n8. **Option 10: Maintaining integer dimensions**\n\n   - Possible, but many options are impractical.\n\n   - The 15m by 15m square is both integer and practical.\n\n**Best option:**\n\nBased on the above analysis, the best option is **Option 3: Changing both dimensions proportionally** to maintain the original shape while achieving the desired area increase.\n\nThis results in new dimensions of approximately 12.25 meters by 18.37 meters, which preserves the original 2:3 width-to-length ratio and provides a balanced expansion of both dimensions.\n\nThis approach is practical, maintains the aesthetic of the original garden shape, and doesn't require extreme extensions in one direction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{New dimensions: approximately } 12.25 \\text{ meters by } 18.37 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
