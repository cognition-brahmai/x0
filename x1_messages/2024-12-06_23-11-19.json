        "content": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. The expression is:\n\n((8 - 4)^2 * 5 + 6 / 2) - 3 * 7\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This rule is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n(8 - 4) = 4\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n(4^2 * 5 + 6 / 2) - 3 * 7\n\nNext, I need to calculate the exponent:\n\n4^2 = 16\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n(16 * 5 + 6 / 2) - 3 * 7\n\nNext, I'll perform the multiplication and division from left to right.\n\nFirst, 16 * 5:\n\n16 * 5 = 80\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n(80 + 6 / 2) - 3 * 7\n\nNext, 6 / 2:\n\n6 / 2 = 3\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n(80 + 3) - 3 * 7\n\nNext, addition inside the parentheses:\n\n80 + 3 = 83\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n83 - 3 * 7\n\nNext, multiplication:\n\n3 * 7 = 21\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n83 - 21\n\nFinally, subtraction:\n\n83 - 21 = 62\n\nSo, the final answer is 62.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{62} \\]"
