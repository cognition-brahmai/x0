        "content": "Let's see. There are 3 red balls and 7 blue balls in the box, making a total of 10 balls. I need to find the probability that both balls drawn are red, and it's without replacement. So, the first draw and the second draw are dependent events.\n\nFirst, I should find the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw. There are 3 red balls out of 10 total balls, so the probability is 3/10.\n\nNext, since I'm not replacing the first ball, the total number of balls decreases by one for the second draw. So, if the first ball was red, there are now 2 red balls left and a total of 9 balls.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a second red ball is 2/9.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, I need to multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\nSo, the probability of both balls being red is (3/10) * (2/9).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n(3/10) * (2/9) = (3*2)/(10*9) = 6/90.\n\nI can simplify 6/90 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 6, which gives 1/15.\n\nWait, but I can check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use combinations to calculate the probability.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 3 is C(3,2) = 3.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 10 is C(10,2) = 45.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 3/45, which simplifies to 1/15.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, so I'm confident that 1/15 is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{15}} \\]"
