        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we've got a classroom with 8 boys and 12 girls, making a total of 20 students. We need to find the probability that when we select 4 students at random, all of them are girls.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand what probability is. Probability is a measure of the likelihood that a specific event will occur. It's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the event we're interested in is selecting 4 girls out of the 12 girls available, from a total of 20 students.\n\nSo, the probability \\( P \\) that all 4 students selected are girls can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{all girls}) = \\frac{\\text{number of ways to choose 4 girls}}{\\text{total number of ways to choose 4 students}} \\]\n\nNow, to find these numbers, we need to use combinations because the order in which we select the students doesn't matter. Combinations are used when the order is irrelevant.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items,\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose,\n\n- \\( n! \\) is the factorial of \\( n \\), which is the product of all positive integers up to \\( n \\).\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to choose 4 students out of 20.\n\n\\[ C(20, 4) = \\frac{20!}{4!(20 - 4)!} = \\frac{20!}{4! \\times 16!} \\]\n\nWe can simplify this by canceling out \\( 16! \\) in the numerator and denominator:\n\n\\[ C(20, 4) = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17 \\times 16!}{4! \\times 16!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17}{4!} \\]\n\nNow, \\( 4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24 \\), so:\n\n\\[ C(20, 4) = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17}{24} \\]\n\nLet's calculate the numerator:\n\n\\[ 20 \\times 19 = 380 \\]\n\n\\[ 380 \\times 18 = 6840 \\]\n\n\\[ 6840 \\times 17 = 116280 \\]\n\nNow, divide by the denominator:\n\n\\[ \\frac{116280}{24} = 4845 \\]\n\nSo, there are 4,845 ways to choose any 4 students out of 20.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to choose 4 girls out of 12.\n\n\\[ C(12, 4) = \\frac{12!}{4!(12 - 4)!} = \\frac{12!}{4! \\times 8!} \\]\n\nAgain, simplify by canceling out \\( 8! \\):\n\n\\[ C(12, 4) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8!}{4! \\times 8!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{4!} \\]\n\nWe already know \\( 4! = 24 \\), so:\n\n\\[ C(12, 4) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{24} \\]\n\nCalculate the numerator:\n\n\\[ 12 \\times 11 = 132 \\]\n\n\\[ 132 \\times 10 = 1320 \\]\n\n\\[ 1320 \\times 9 = 11880 \\]\n\nNow, divide by the denominator:\n\n\\[ \\frac{11880}{24} = 495 \\]\n\nSo, there are 495 ways to choose 4 girls out of 12.\n\nNow, we can find the probability:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{all girls}) = \\frac{495}{4845} \\]\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by 15:\n\n\\[ \\frac{495 \\div 15}{4845 \\div 15} = \\frac{33}{323} \\]\n\nSo, the probability is \\( \\frac{33}{323} \\).\n\nAlternatively, we can express this as a decimal or a percentage.\n\nTo convert to a decimal:\n\n\\[ \\frac{33}{323} \\approx 0.1022 \\]\n\nTo convert to a percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.1022 \\times 100\\% \\approx 10.22\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that all 4 students selected are girls is approximately 10.22%.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check our calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nFirst, verifying \\( C(20, 4) \\):\n\n\\[ C(20, 4) = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{116280}{24} = 4845 \\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNext, \\( C(12, 4) \\):\n\n\\[ C(12, 4) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{11880}{24} = 495 \\]\n\nThat also seems correct.\n\nNow, the probability:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{495}{4845} \\]\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 15:\n\n\\[ \\frac{495 \\div 15}{4845 \\div 15} = \\frac{33}{323} \\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, confirming the decimal:\n\n\\[ 33 \\div 323 \\approx 0.1022 \\]\n\nAnd as a percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.1022 \\times 100\\% \\approx 10.22\\% \\]\n\nSo, the probability is indeed approximately 10.22%.\n\nAnother way to approach this problem is to think about selecting students one by one, without replacement, and calculate the probability at each step.\n\nLet's try that method to verify.\n\nThe probability that the first student selected is a girl is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12}{20} \\]\n\nGiven that the first student is a girl, the probability that the second student is also a girl is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{11}{19} \\]\n\nGiven that the first two are girls, the probability that the third is a girl is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{10}{18} \\]\n\nAnd given that the first three are girls, the probability that the fourth is a girl is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{9}{17} \\]\n\nSo, the overall probability is:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{12}{20} \\times \\frac{11}{19} \\times \\frac{10}{18} \\times \\frac{9}{17} \\]\n\nLet's calculate this step by step.\n\nFirst:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12}{20} = 0.6 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{11}{19} \\approx 0.5789 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{10}{18} \\approx 0.5556 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{9}{17} \\approx 0.5294 \\]\n\nNow, multiplying these together:\n\n\\[ 0.6 \\times 0.5789 \\approx 0.3473 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.3473 \\times 0.5556 \\approx 0.1931 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.1931 \\times 0.5294 \\approx 0.1022 \\]\n\nSo, again, we get approximately 0.1022, or 10.22%.\n\nThis matches our previous result, which is a good sign that our calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate it without converting to decimals:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{12}{20} \\times \\frac{11}{19} \\times \\frac{10}{18} \\times \\frac{9}{17} \\]\n\nFirst, simplify each fraction where possible:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12}{20} = \\frac{3}{5} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{11}{19} \\] (already simplest)\n\n\\[ \\frac{10}{18} = \\frac{5}{9} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{9}{17} \\] (already simplest)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{11}{19} \\times \\frac{5}{9} \\times \\frac{9}{17} \\]\n\nNow, look for common factors to cancel out.\n\nNotice that 5 in the numerator of the third fraction cancels with 5 in the denominator of the first fraction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{\\cancel{5}} \\times \\frac{11}{19} \\times \\frac{\\cancel{5}}{9} \\times \\frac{9}{17} = \\frac{3}{1} \\times \\frac{11}{19} \\times \\frac{1}{9} \\times \\frac{9}{17} \\]\n\nNext, 9 in the numerator of the fourth fraction cancels with 9 in the denominator of the third fraction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{1} \\times \\frac{11}{19} \\times \\frac{1}{\\cancel{9}} \\times \\frac{\\cancel{9}}{17} = \\frac{3}{1} \\times \\frac{11}{19} \\times \\frac{1}{1} \\times \\frac{1}{17} = 3 \\times \\frac{11}{19} \\times \\frac{1}{17} \\]\n\nNow, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{3 \\times 11 \\times 1 \\times 1}{1 \\times 19 \\times 1 \\times 17} = \\frac{33}{323} \\]\n\nAgain, we arrive at \\( \\frac{33}{323} \\), which is approximately 0.1022 or 10.22%.\n\nSo, regardless of the method we use, we get the same result, confirming that our calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability that all 4 students selected are girls is \\( \\frac{33}{323} \\), or approximately 10.22%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{33}{323}} \\]"
