        "content": "So I've got this limit to find: the limit as x approaches infinity of (x^2 + 3x) divided by (2x^2 - x). Hmm, okay, let's see how to tackle this.\n\nFirst off, when you're dealing with limits as x approaches infinity, especially with rational functions like this one, where both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials, there's a general approach you can take.\n\nI remember that in such cases, the degree of the polynomials in the numerator and the denominator plays a crucial role. The degree is just the highest power of x in the polynomial.\n\nHere, both the numerator and the denominator have x squared as the highest power, so they're both degree 2 polynomials. That's good to know.\n\nNow, I recall that when the degrees of the numerator and the denominator are the same, the limit as x approaches infinity is equal to the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\nIn this case, the leading coefficient of the numerator is 1 (from x squared) and the leading coefficient of the denominator is 2 (from 2x squared). So, intuitively, the limit should be 1/2.\n\nBut let's make sure. Maybe there's another way to confirm this.\n\nOne common method is to divide both the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of x in the denominator. Since the denominator has x squared, I'll divide both the top and the bottom by x squared.\n\nSo, let's do that:\n\nNumerator: (x^2 + 3x) / x^2 = 1 + 3/x\n\nDenominator: (2x^2 - x) / x^2 = 2 - 1/x\n\nNow, the expression becomes (1 + 3/x) / (2 - 1/x).\n\nNow, as x approaches infinity, what happens to 3/x and -1/x? Well, as x gets larger and larger, these fractions get smaller and smaller, approaching zero.\n\nSo, the limit as x approaches infinity would be (1 + 0) / (2 - 0) = 1/2.\n\nThat seems straightforward. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try plugging in some large values for x and see if the expression gets closer to 1/2.\n\nLet's try x = 100:\n\n(100^2 + 3*100) / (2*100^2 - 100) = (10000 + 300) / (20000 - 100) = 10300 / 19900 \u2248 0.5176.\n\nNow, x = 1000:\n\n(1000^2 + 3*1000) / (2*1000^2 - 1000) = (1,000,000 + 3,000) / (2,000,000 - 1,000) = 1,003,000 / 1,999,000 \u2248 0.50175.\n\nAnd x = 10,000:\n\n(10,000^2 + 3*10,000) / (2*10,000^2 - 10,000) = (100,000,000 + 30,000) / (200,000,000 - 10,000) = 100,030,000 / 199,990,000 \u2248 0.50015.\n\nYeah, it's getting closer and closer to 0.5 as x gets larger, which confirms my earlier conclusion.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at this. Perhaps using L'H\u00f4pital's Rule, since when x approaches infinity, both the numerator and the denominator approach infinity, which is an indeterminate form \u221e/\u221e.\n\nL'H\u00f4pital's Rule says that if you have an indeterminate form, you can take the derivative of the numerator and the derivative of the denominator and then take the limit of that ratio.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nThe derivative of the numerator: d/dx (x^2 + 3x) = 2x + 3\n\nThe derivative of the denominator: d/dx (2x^2 - x) = 4x - 1\n\nSo now, the limit as x approaches infinity of (2x + 3)/(4x - 1)\n\nHmm, this is still an indeterminate form \u221e/\u221e, so maybe I can apply L'H\u00f4pital's Rule again.\n\nTaking the derivative of the numerator again: d/dx (2x + 3) = 2\n\nDerivative of the denominator: d/dx (4x - 1) = 4\n\nSo now, the limit is 2/4 = 1/2.\n\nAgain, I get the same answer. That's reassuring.\n\nBut I should note that in this case, since the degrees are the same, dividing the leading coefficients directly is faster and more efficient than using L'H\u00f4pital's Rule. L'H\u00f4pital's Rule is more useful when the degrees aren't the same or when dealing with other indeterminate forms.\n\nAlternatively, I could factor out x squared from both the numerator and the denominator and then simplify.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFactoring x squared:\n\nNumerator: x^2 (1 + 3/x)\n\nDenominator: x^2 (2 - 1/x)\n\nSo, the expression becomes [x^2 (1 + 3/x)] / [x^2 (2 - 1/x)] = (1 + 3/x) / (2 - 1/x)\n\nAgain, as x approaches infinity, 3/x and -1/x approach 0, leaving me with 1/2.\n\nSame answer yet again.\n\nI think it's clear that the limit is 1/2.\n\nJust to be extra sure, maybe I can consider the behavior of the function for very large x.\n\nAs x gets really big, the x squared terms dominate both the numerator and the denominator, and the 3x and -x terms become negligible in comparison.\n\nSo, essentially, for very large x, the expression behaves like x^2 / 2x^2, which is 1/2.\n\nAgain, this aligns with my previous conclusions.\n\nI don't think there's any other angle I need to consider here. The limit as x approaches infinity of (x^2 + 3x)/(2x^2 - x) is definitely 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
