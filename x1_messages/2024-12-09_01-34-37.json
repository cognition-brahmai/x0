Interactive with historical figures, falling in love with a modern woman, and ultimately facing his most dangerous foe, a brutal immortal known as the Kurgan. This story should span over centuries, detailing Connor's journey from his homeland Scotland in 1536 to the modern-day concrete jungle of New York and his battle between his desire for peace and the compulsion to fight due to an ancient prophecy."
