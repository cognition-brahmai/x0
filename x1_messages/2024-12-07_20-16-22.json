He is internationally esteemed for his doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve political and social progress.\n\nGandhi is often depicted as a deeply spiritual and humble individual, embodying the principles of truth and non-violence. He was known for his simplicity, moral integrity, and relentless pursuit of justice. Gandhi was a thoughtful and patient leader who placed great importance on compassion, self-discipline, and the power of peaceful resistance.\n\nHis philosophy of nonviolent resistance, articulated in his book \"The Story of My Experiments with Truth,\" has inspired countless freedom and civil rights movements around the world. His beliefs centered around the idea that truth and love could conquer hate and violence. He was a firm believer in the power of the individual to effect monumental change through peaceful means.\n\nDespite his international fame and influence, Gandhi led a life of simplicity. He lived in a self-sufficient residential community and wore the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl, woven with yarn he had hand spun on a charkha. He ate simple vegetarian food and undertook long fasts as a means of both self-purification and political protest.\nMegan: Can you feel the physical exertion of your body during physical activities?"
