        "content": "Here's a simple Python script that creates a server listening on a specified port and sends back the current server time to each connected client. This example uses the `socket` module for networking and the `datetime` module to get the current time.\n\n```python\nimport socket\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef main():\n    host = '0.0.0.0'  # Listen on all available interfaces\n    port = 12345      # Specify your port here\n\n    # Create a socket object\n    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n\n    # Bind the socket to the host and port\n    server_socket.bind((host, port))\n\n    # Listen for incoming connections\n    server_socket.listen(5)\n    print(f\"Server listening on {host}:{port}\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Accept a connection\n        client_socket, addr = server_socket.accept()\n        print(f\"Connection from {addr}\")\n\n        # Get the current server time\n        current_time = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\n\n        # Send the current time to the client\n        client_socket.sendall(current_time.encode('utf-8'))\n\n        # Close the connection\n        client_socket.close()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Import Modules**:\n   - `socket`: For creating and managing network sockets.\n   - `datetime`: For getting the current date and time.\n\n2. **Server Setup**:\n   - Define the host and port for the server to listen on.\n   - Create a socket object using `socket.AF_INET` (IPv4) and `socket.SOCK_STREAM` (TCP).\n   - Bind the socket to the specified host and port.\n   - Start listening for incoming connections with a backlog of 5 connections.\n\n3. **Handling Connections**:\n   - Use a infinite loop to accept incoming connections.\n   - For each connection, accept the connection request to get a client socket and the client's address.\n   - Get the current server time using `datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')`.\n   - Send the current time to the client by encoding it to bytes and using `sendall()`.\n   - Close the client socket after sending the time.\n\nThis script sets up a basic TCP server that responds with the current server time to any client that connects to it."
