        "content": "Let's see. The company has 500 employees, and each is getting a 10% salary increase. The average monthly salary is $3,000. I need to find out how much more the company will spend on salaries every month after this increase.\n\nFirst, I should find out what the total current monthly salary expenditure is. Since there are 500 employees and the average salary is $3,000, the total current monthly salary expenditure should be 500 times $3,000. That would be 500 * 3000 = $1,500,000.\n\nNow, each employee is getting a 10% increase. So, each employee's salary will increase by 10% of their current salary. Since the average salary is $3,000, the average increase per employee would be 10% of $3,000, which is 0.10 * 3000 = $300.\n\nSo, each employee's salary increases by $300 on average. With 500 employees, the total increase in salary expenditure would be 500 * $300 = $150,000.\n\nTherefore, the company will spend an additional $150,000 on salaries every month after the increase.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Another way to look at it is that the overall salary expenditure is increasing by 10%, since each employee's salary is increasing by 10%. The total current salary expenditure is $1,500,000, so a 10% increase would be 0.10 * 1,500,000 = $150,000, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, yes, the company will spend $150,000 more on salaries every month after the 10% increase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150000} \\]"
