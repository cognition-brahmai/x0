        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nThere are 100 houses in a town, and each house has either a red or blue door. So, two possibilities for each house: red or blue. The problem says that if you walk past 10 houses with red doors in a row, what is the probability that the next house will have a blue door.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There are 100 houses, each with a door that's either red or blue. The problem doesn't specify how many houses have red doors and how many have blue doors, so I'm assuming that each house has an equal probability of having a red or blue door, unless stated otherwise.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem might be implying that the door colors are randomly assigned with equal probability, but it doesn't explicitly say that. However, in probability problems involving binary choices like this, it's common to assume that each outcome is equally likely unless otherwise specified.\n\nSo, let's assume that for each house, the probability of having a red door is 0.5 and the probability of having a blue door is 0.5, and that the colors are independently assigned.\n\nNow, the problem states that you walk past 10 houses with red doors in a row. So, we've observed 10 consecutive red doors. The question is, given this information, what is the probability that the next house will have a blue door.\n\nSince the door colors are independently assigned, the color of one house's door doesn't affect the color of another house's door. Therefore, the fact that the previous 10 houses have red doors shouldn't influence the probability of the next house having a blue door.\n\nIn other words, the probability should still be 0.5 that the next house has a blue door.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's some conditional probability here. Let me think again.\n\nIf the door colors are independent, then yes, the probability remains 0.5. However, if there is some dependency or pattern in the door colors, then the previous 10 red doors might affect the probability of the next door being blue.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any dependency or pattern. It just says that each house has either a red or blue door, and we're to find the probability that the next house has a blue door given that the previous 10 had red doors.\n\nGiven the lack of information about any pattern or dependency, I think the safe assumption is that the door colors are independently assigned, each with a probability of 0.5.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the next house has a blue door is 0.5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me into thinking about sequences or runs of red doors.\n\nBut again, if the assignments are independent, the probability shouldn't change based on previous observations.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another way to look at it. Maybe the problem is considering the total number of red and blue doors in the town.\n\nIf there are 100 houses, and each has either a red or blue door, then there are a fixed number of red and blue doors in total. In that case, observing some red doors might affect the probability of the next door being blue, because there are a finite number of doors.\n\nFor example, if there are only 10 red doors in total, and I've already seen 10, then the next door must be blue.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the total number of red or blue doors. It just says each house has either red or blue door.\n\nTherefore, it's more appropriate to assume that the door colors are independently assigned, each with probability 0.5.\n\nHence, the probability that the next house has a blue door is 0.5.\n\nAlternatively, if the door colors are not independent, and there is some underlying pattern or distribution, then the problem becomes more complex.\n\nFor instance, if the door colors alternate, or if there are clusters of red or blue doors, that would affect the probability.\n\nBut again, the problem doesn't provide any information about such patterns.\n\nTherefore, under the assumption of independence, the probability is 0.5.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.5} \\]"
