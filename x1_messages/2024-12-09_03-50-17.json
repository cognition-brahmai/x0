The exact percentage can vary depending on factors such as age, fitness level, and overall health, but it's generally estimated that we use around 5-10% of our total lung capacity during regular breathing. This is because our bodies are highly efficient at extracting the oxygen we need from the air we inhale, so there's no need to utilize the full capacity of our lungs under normal circumstances."
