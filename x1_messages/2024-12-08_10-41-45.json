        "content": "If I read at a speed of 300 words per minute, to find out how long it would take to read a book with 90,000 words, I would divide the total number of words by my reading speed.\n\nSo, 90,000 words divided by 300 words per minute equals 300 minutes.\n\nTo convert minutes into hours, I know there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 300 minutes divided by 60 equals 5 hours.\n\nTherefore, it would take me 5 hours to read a 90,000-word book at a speed of 300 words per minute.\n\nBut wait, is that accounting for things like breaks or changes in reading speed depending on complexity? Hmm, the question seems straightforward, assuming constant reading speed without breaks.\n\nSo, my final answer is 5 hours."
