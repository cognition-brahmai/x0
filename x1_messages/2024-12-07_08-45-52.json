        "content": "So I've got this task here to categorize some '90s snacks into sweet or savory. The snacks are Dunkaroos, Gushers, Bagel Bites, Pop Rocks, and Combos. Okay, let's tackle this one by one.\n\nFirst up, Dunkaroos. I remember these! They were these little cookie things that you dip into some kind of frosting or something. Was it frosting? I think it was more like a sweet powder that you'd dip the cookie into. So, definitely sweet, right? Yeah, that sounds about right.\n\nNext, Gushers. Gushers were those fruit snacks that had a jelly center with a fruity coating. They came in different flavors like grape, cherry, and apple. Totally sweet. No question there.\n\nNow, Bagel Bites. Hmm, Bagel Bites are those mini pizza bagels. You know, you have a bagel base, and then tomato sauce and cheese on top. Sometimes you could get ones with pepperoni or other toppings. That sounds savory to me. It's like a small pizza, which is definitely not sweet.\n\nPop Rocks. Oh man, Pop Rocks were so much fun! You'd drop them into your mouth, and they'd fizzle and make popping sounds. They were sugar cubes with carbonation inside, I think. Each flavor had a different color and taste, but they were all sweet. Especially the cherry and grape flavors were popular.\n\nLastly, Combos. Combos were these snack chips that had a crispy exterior and a soft, cheese-filled center. They came in different flavors like cheddar, sour cream and onion, and others. I think they were considered savory because of the cheese flavor, but some people might argue that the cheese can be slightly sweet. However, overall, I'd classify them as savory.\n\nSo, to sum it up:\n\n- Dunkaroos: Sweet\n\n- Gushers: Sweet\n\n- Bagel Bites: Savory\n\n- Pop Rocks: Sweet\n\n- Combos: Savory\n\nI think that's how they go. Do you agree?\n"
