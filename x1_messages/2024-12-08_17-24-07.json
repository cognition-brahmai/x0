        "content": "So if a bee visits 5 flowers every minute, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, then to find out how many flowers it visits in an hour, I just need to multiply the number of flowers it visits per minute by the number of minutes in an hour. So that would be 5 flowers/minute times 60 minutes/hour.\n\nLet me calculate that: 5 times 60 is 300. So the bee would visit 300 flowers in an hour.\n\nBut wait, is there anything else I should consider? Like, maybe the bee takes breaks or something. But according to the problem, it's visiting 5 flowers every minute, so I think assuming constant rate is fine here.\n\nSo, the answer is 300 flowers per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
