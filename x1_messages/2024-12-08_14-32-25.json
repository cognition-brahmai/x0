The total costs include both the fixed costs and the variable costs (cost per widget).\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Identify the selling price per widget (P):** $8\n\n2. **Identify the variable cost per widget (V):** $5\n\n3. **Identify the fixed costs (F):** $2,000\n\n4. **Calculate the contribution margin per widget (CM):** This is the amount of money each widget contributes to covering the fixed costs after covering its own variable cost.\n\n   \\[\n   CM = P - V = 8 - 5 = 3 \\text{ dollars per widget}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the break-even point in units (Q):** This is the number of widgets needed to cover the fixed costs.\n\n   \\[\n   Q = \\frac{F}{CM} = \\frac{2000}{3} \\approx 666.67\n   \\]\n\nSince the company can't sell a fraction of a widget, they need to sell at least 667 widgets to cover their fixed costs and break even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{667} \\]"
