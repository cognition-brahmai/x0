        "content": "So I've got this problem here: If you invest $10,000 in an account that earns 5% annual interest compounded monthly, how much will the account be worth after 2 years?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what all these terms mean. So, investment is $10,000, that's straightforward. The annual interest rate is 5%, and it's compounded monthly. Compounded monthly means that the interest is calculated and added to the principal every month. And we want to know the total amount after 2 years.\n\nI recall there's a formula for compound interest. Let me try to remember it. I think it's A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount, which is the initial amount of money.\n\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for, in years.\n\nDoes that sound right? Let me double-check that. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, in this problem:\n\nP = $10,000\n\nr = 5% per year, which is 0.05 as a decimal.\n\nn = 12, because interest is compounded monthly, and there are 12 months in a year.\n\nt = 2 years.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nA = 10000 * (1 + 0.05/12)^(12*2)\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the monthly interest rate:\n\n0.05 / 12 = 0.00416666...\n\nThen, add 1 to that:\n\n1 + 0.00416666... = 1.00416666...\n\nNext, raise that to the power of 24 (since 12 months/year * 2 years = 24 months):\n\n(1.00416666...)^24\n\nI'll need to calculate that. Let me grab a calculator for this part.\n\nSo, 1.00416666... to the power of 24.\n\nLet me enter that into the calculator.\n\nFirst, 0.05 divided by 12 is 0.00416666...\n\nThen, 1 plus that is 1.00416666...\n\nNow, raise that to the 24th power.\n\nCalculating 1.00416666...^24 gives approximately 1.10494029...\n\nNow, multiply that by the principal amount, which is $10,000.\n\nSo, 10000 * 1.10494029... = 11049.4029...\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that would be $11,049.40.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me check my calculations again.\n\nStarting with P = $10,000\n\nr = 5% = 0.05\n\nn = 12\n\nt = 2\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nA = 10000 * (1 + 0.05/12)^(12*2)\n\nCalculate inside the parentheses first:\n\n0.05 / 12 = 0.00416666...\n\n1 + 0.00416666... = 1.00416666...\n\nThen, raise to the 24th power:\n\n1.00416666...^24 \u2248 1.10494029...\n\nThen, multiply by P:\n\n10000 * 1.10494029... = 11049.4029...\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can verify this by calculating the interest manually for each month, but that would be time-consuming. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nLet me see if there's another formula or a different approach that can confirm this result.\n\nAnother way to look at compound interest is to use the formula for compound interest with different compounding periods. But I think the formula I used is standard and should be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for continuous compounding, but in this case, it's compounded monthly, not continuously.\n\nThe formula for continuous compounding is A = Pe^(rt), where e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nBut since it's compounded monthly, the formula I used is appropriate.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Are there any fees or additional deposits? The problem doesn't mention any, so I can assume it's just the initial investment with compound interest.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the interest rate is indeed 5% per year, compounded monthly, and not 5% per month or something else.\n\nGiven that, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nSo, after 2 years, the account should be worth approximately $11,049.40.\n\nLet me just check one more thing. Sometimes, interest rates can be nominal or effective. But in this case, since it's compounded monthly, the annual interest rate is 5%, and we're using that in the formula, so I think it's fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the effective annual rate to see if that makes sense.\n\nThe effective annual interest rate is given by (1 + r/n)^n - 1.\n\nSo, (1 + 0.05/12)^12 - 1 \u2248 (1.00416666...)^12 - 1 \u2248 1.05116189... - 1 = 0.05116189..., or about 5.116%.\n\nSo, the effective annual rate is approximately 5.116%.\n\nThen, over 2 years, the amount would be P*(1 + effective rate)^t.\n\nWait, but that might not be directly applicable here, since we're already using the compound interest formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as compounds every month, so over 2 years, it's 24 compounding periods.\n\nEach period, the interest is 0.05/12 \u2248 0.00416666...\n\nSo, each month, the amount increases by that percentage.\n\nTherefore, after 24 months, the amount should be P*(1 + r/n)^(nt), which is what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate it step by step for a few months to see if the pattern holds.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nStarting with P = $10,000\n\nFirst month:\n\nInterest = P * (r/n) = 10000 * (0.05/12) \u2248 10000 * 0.00416666... \u2248 41.666...\n\nNew amount = 10000 + 41.666... \u2248 10041.666...\n\nSecond month:\n\nInterest = new amount * (r/n) \u2248 10041.666... * 0.00416666... \u2248 42.013...\n\nNew amount = 10041.666... + 42.013... \u2248 10083.679...\n\nAnd so on, for 24 months.\n\nThis seems tedious, but it confirms that each month, the interest is calculated on the new principal, which includes the previous interest.\n\nGiven that, my original formula should account for this compound growth correctly.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that after 2 years, the account will be worth approximately $11,049.40.\n\nLet me just check if there's any other aspect I might have missed.\n\nIs the interest rate fixed, or is it variable? The problem doesn't specify, so I'm assuming it's a fixed rate.\n\nAlso, assuming that there are no withdrawals or additional deposits during these 2 years.\n\nGiven that, my calculation should hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a financial calculator or an online compound interest calculator to verify this result.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, I think the formula I used is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final amount is $11,049.40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11049.40} \\]"
