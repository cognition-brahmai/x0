Happening now: This could be the hour when Barack Obama finally reveals his running mate. We\\'re following all the key players, including Hillary Clinton. She\\'s speaking out about her chances for the job. The best political team on television is standing by to bring you the big announcement at any time. Also, new progress toward bringing U.S. troops home from Iraq. It could dramatically change the presidential campaign debate over the war. And he was invited to lead a prayer at the Democratic Convention -- why a young evangelical said, thanks, but no thanks. We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. I\\'m Wolf Blitzer. You\\'re in THE SITUATION ROOM. Barack Obama may be trying to compete with the Beijing Olympics by creating enormous suspense about his vice presidential choice. Our vice presidential watch right now way into overdrive. Our cameras are trained on the homes of Obama\\'s possible running mates and on the Chicago airport where his number two might land, literally, at any time. We have heard some of the top prospects today about whether or not they\\'re running or not running, including from Hillary Clinton. QUESTION: Do you still want the job? SEN. HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D), NEW YORK: I have never said I did. I have always said that I will do whatever I can, because I feel so strongly in making sure that we elect Senator Obama our next president. REP. CHET EDWARDS (D), TEXAS: I have been considered throughout this process. And Speaker Pelosi has been a strong advocate in my behalf. But I respected the process from day one. And I want to continue to do that today and allow any details about the process and the final decisions to be made by Senator Obama and their campaign, not by anyone else. GOV. KATHLEEN SEBELIUS (D), KANSAS: I don\\'t really comment on my phone calls. And as I have told you for months, all the comments about this process and the discussions are really coming from the campaign. BLITZER: Let\\'s go straight to our senior political correspondent. She\\'s in Chicago. Candy Crowley is there. That\\'s where -- Barack Obama is there. We\\'re all waiting, Candy. You have been speaking to these folks nonstop. What do we know? CANDY CROWLEY, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, what we know is, they are running out of the window before they\\'re having the rally in Springfield, at which the vice presidential choice will appear. We do know that this is a Herculean task, because what they want to do is to text message and e-mail supporters and volunteers, kind of to bring them into this process. They want them to know first. And they have millions of people that have signed up for this text message. So, there\\'s a logistical problem there that they need to work around. One would have thought, if you were looking at this from the classic political sense, that they might have done that before the broadcast networks had their Friday evening news. We seem to be very close, if not past that point. So, what they are doing here, Wolf, is doing a very slow roll into the convention. Those four days are the time that the Democrats sort of strut their stuff for the rest of the nation, saying, here\\'s what the Democratic Party is about. What you have to do is get people to watch. This is part of the drumroll. This is part of building kind of the excitement, trying to get people into the process, saying, who is it going to be? Who is it going to be? And as long as they can draw that out, the more attention that the campaign gets. I mean, the less information people have, the more attention that this is bringing to the Obama campaign. It\\'s precisely what they want. BLITZER: And the more the suspense, the more they\\'re hoping they can bring in, entice people to sign up for those text message alerts from the Barack Obama campaign, get some more people on their lists. CROWLEY: Right, absolutely. It\\'s a treasure trove of information. You -- you have people who were interested enough to want to know who your vice presidential candidate was. Those are potential donors. Those are potential volunteers. Those are, most importantly, potential voters. This campaign has been amazing at gathering information in a number of ways. They have taken technology to a whole new level. And, remember, who uses text messages, primarily? It\\'s young people. That is the voting bloc that Barack Obama needs to keep interested, needs to keep involved. It is there that he hopes to bring in a base of support that has not always been there for either Democrats or Republicans to offset maybe the more traditional voters that he might not be able to win. So, this is directed at, A, gathering information and having as much as possible for future use, but also at keeping the excitement level going for the young people who came out and voted for him in droves during the primaries. BLITZER: Good point, Candy. Thanks very much. We also know that some of those who aren\\'t going to be the vice president, they have already been informed by Senator Obama that they didn\\'t get picked. But they\\'re not saying yet, because the suspense is building. By the way, a little bit later, we are going to be hearing directly from Senator Hillary Clinton on whether or not her primary supporters will vote for Barack Obama in the November election. And she spoke extensively today. You are going to see that. That\\'s coming up shortly right here in THE SITUATION ROOM. Meantime, John McCain is enjoying some downtime at his home in Arizona. His campaign is just as eager as the rest of us to learn the name of Barack Obama\\'s vice presidential choice. Let\\'s bring in CNN\\'s Ed Henry. He\\'s working this part of the story for us. How are they, the McCain campaign, preparing for this big announcement? ED HENRY, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, you said eager. They\\'re also anxious. They keep calling reporters, saying, what are you hearing? They want to know who Barack Obama is going to choose. It is going to obviously have an impact on who John McCain chooses. But it\\'s an impact on what they\\'re going to do. And they\\'re promising to be just as aggressive in their rapid response to whoever the running mate is as the Obama camp in how they role this out. So, they are going to have surrogates on television all weekend reacting. And they also have been working behind the scenes for months now digging up information on every single possibility, one example, Joe Biden. He\\'s been in the Senate since 1972. There\\'s a lot to pore over, obviously. And they have gone through everything from, for example, the debate last summer, in which Joe Biden raised questions about Barack Obama\\'s experience, whether he could be commander in chief. But, also, they have gone all the way back to Joe Biden\\'s own first presidential campaign in 1988. Take a listen. GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, MODERATOR: You were asked, is he ready? You said, \"I think he can be ready, but, right now, I don\\'t believe he is. The presidency is not something that lends itself to on-the-job training.\" SEN. JOSEPH BIDEN (D), DELAWARE: I think I stand by the statement. NARRATOR: The White House isn\\'t the place to learn how to deal with international crises, the balance of power, war and peace, and the economic future of the next generation. A president has got to know the territory. But that\\'s not enough. HENRY: Now, you heard right there, in the first debate, ABC\\'s debate with George Stephanopoulos, pressed on whether George Bush had the experience one year ago, Joe Biden said he did not. And then, in his very first presidential campaign in 1988, Joe Biden basically saying experience in dealing with a foreign crisis is critical for a commander in chief. That\\'s an ad John McCain that could have written. In fact, he\\'s already written ads like that, Wolf. BLITZER: What do we know about John McCain\\'s selection process? We expect one week from today, the day after the Democratic Convention, he is going to roll out his vice presidential candidate. \"TIME\" magazine was saying he has basically selected Mitt Romney. HENRY: What is interesting -- the McCain campaign shot that down pretty quickly, saying that John McCain has not decided it\\'s going to be Mitt Romney. Frankly, he hasn\\'t decided it\\'s going to be anyone just yet, that basically Romney is still in the mix. Tim Pawlenty, the Minnesota governor, is still in the mix. And even Tom Ridge, the moderate who has raised a lot of concerns among conservatives, he\\'s still in the mix as well. Bottom line is, the McCain campaign is saying, we have the luxury of going second. We\\'re not going to rush into this. John McCain is taking a little time off in Arizona. He\\'s thinking about all of this. And he\\'s going to see who Obama picks. That may have an impact. If Obama picks really well, he gets a strong bounce out of his convention, that might mean that John McCain decides he\\'s got to really get someone who is going to rally the conservative troops. If the race is as close as it is now, he may make a different choice -- Wolf. BLITZER: We will see. Thanks very much, Ed Henry, for that. Ed Henry is working his sources. An important new development today could change this presidential campaign debate. And it involves the Iraq war, the U.S. and Iraq right now moving forward with a plan to withdraw American troops by 2011. The White House says the leaders of both sides spoke by secure video on the proposal hammered out by U.S. and Iraqi negotiators. It\\'s not a done deal by any means, at least not yet. But it does set a course for U.S. combat troops to leave major Iraqi cities by June of next year. And a broader withdrawal would come two years later. The dates could be adjusted if the military and political situation deteriorate. Our Brian Todd has been looking into the possible impact of all of this on the McCain/Obama race. Brian, what are the campaigns saying? BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, they are both claiming vindication, both saying that, on the Iraq issue, at least, this deal takes the wind out of the other guy\\'s sails. TODD (voice-over): For both John McCain and Barack Obama, there is spin for the taking out of the proposed agreement for a complete U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq by the end of 2011. SEN. BARACK OBAMA (D-IL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Looks like the plan that I had talked about two years ago to start pulling our troops out in a responsible way. TODD: Obama\\'s aides and Democratic strategists also tell us they believe this isolates John McCain. Even the Bush administration has come around to a timetable for withdrawal, they say, and McCain\\'s the only one who hasn\\'t. Obama has long favored a timetable, but his is quicker -- withdrawal within 16 months from when he would take office. McCain\\'s supporters say, far from isolating him, this agreement justifies a stand he took when it wasn\\'t popular. LESLIE SANCHEZ, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: He was one of the people that said the surge was necessary, and it plays very much to the fact that his strategy worked. And in essence, it was trying to create stability and security in Iraq so that U.S. forces could come home sooner. TODD: Still, McCain\\'s aides say he\\'s sticking to his position against what they call an artificial timetable with a date certain. So who\\'s really got the advantage from this deal? Analysts who don\\'t take a position say it all may depend on whether this agreement resolves the Iraq issue for voters. LARRY SABATO, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA: What voters are thinking about Iraq, it may play to McCain\\'s strengths. If they\\'re thinking about the economy, it will almost certainly play to Obama\\'s strengths. TODD: And that may depend on whether security conditions on the ground deteriorate between now and November 4. Of course, that is the crux of both candidates\\' positions on Iraq at the moment -- Wolf. BLITZER: Brian, thank you. So, which states are red? Which states are blue? Which states are up for grabs? Our own John King, he is already at the Democratic Convention. He\\'s there with our magic map. Stay tuned for that. And meet a man who said no to Barack Obama -- why an up-and- coming evangelist turned down a chance to speak at the convention. Plus, is Hillary Clinton still in the running for running mate? Is she doing enough to help out Barack Obama? His former rival is speaking out -- Hillary Clinton at length, that\\'s coming up next.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 20 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
