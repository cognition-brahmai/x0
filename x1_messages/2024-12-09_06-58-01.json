        "content": "So I've got this problem here about tiling a rectangular room. The room is 30 feet long and 20 feet wide, and I need to cover the entire floor with square tiles that are each 2 feet by 2 feet. I need to figure out how many tiles I'll need in total.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out the area of the room and the area of one tile, and then see how many tiles fit into the room's area. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the area of the room is length times width, right? So, that would be 30 feet times 20 feet, which is 600 square feet.\n\nNow, each tile is 2 feet by 2 feet, so the area of one tile is 2 times 2, which is 4 square feet.\n\nTo find out how many tiles I need, I can divide the total area of the room by the area of one tile. So, 600 square feet divided by 4 square feet per tile should give me the number of tiles required.\n\nLet me do the math: 600 divided by 4 is 150. So, I need 150 tiles.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should think about it differently. Maybe instead of using area, I can think about how many tiles fit along the length and how many fit along the width, and then multiply those numbers.\n\nThe room is 30 feet long, and each tile is 2 feet long, so along the length, I can fit 30 divided by 2, which is 15 tiles.\n\nSimilarly, the room is 20 feet wide, and each tile is 2 feet wide, so along the width, I can fit 20 divided by 2, which is 10 tiles.\n\nSo, if I multiply the number of tiles along the length by the number of tiles along the width, I get 15 times 10, which is also 150 tiles.\n\nHey, both methods give me the same answer, which is good. It means I probably didn't make any mistakes.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any waste or if I need to account for cutting tiles around the edges or something. But the problem says to cover the entire floor with square tiles that are 2 feet by 2 feet, and since both the length and width of the room are multiples of 2 feet, there shouldn't be any need to cut tiles.\n\nSo, I think 150 tiles is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
