        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a shipping company wanting to optimize its delivery routes to save on fuel and transportation costs. They have 100 trucks, each driving an average of 200 miles a day, and each truck gets 6 miles per gallon of diesel, which costs $3 per gallon. They're thinking about buying new routing software that promises to reduce their total mileage by 15%. I need to figure out how much they could save annually on fuel and then see how long it would take for that savings to cover the cost of the software, which is $500,000.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what their current fuel consumption is and then see what it would be after the reduction from the new software. From there, I can calculate the savings.\n\nSo, starting with the current situation:\n\nNumber of trucks: 100\n\nAverage daily miles per truck: 200 miles\n\nTotal daily miles for all trucks: 100 trucks * 200 miles/truck = 20,000 miles\n\nNow, fuel consumption:\n\nMiles per gallon: 6 mpg\n\nSo, gallons of diesel used per day: Total miles / mpg = 20,000 miles / 6 mpg = 3,333.33 gallons\n\nCost per gallon: $3\n\nTherefore, daily fuel cost: 3,333.33 gallons * $3/gallon = $10,000\n\nOkay, that's the daily fuel cost. Now, to find the annual cost, I need to know how many days they operate in a year. Typically, businesses might operate 365 days a year, but sometimes they might have days off or maintenance days. The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume they operate 365 days a year.\n\nAnnual fuel cost: $10,000/day * 365 days/year = $3,650,000\n\nNow, the new software promises to reduce total mileage by 15%. So, let's calculate the reduced mileage.\n\nCurrent total daily miles: 20,000 miles\n\nReduction: 15% of 20,000 = 0.15 * 20,000 = 3,000 miles\n\nSo, new total daily miles: 20,000 - 3,000 = 17,000 miles\n\nNow, recalculate fuel consumption with the new mileage.\n\nNew gallons of diesel per day: 17,000 miles / 6 mpg = 2,833.33 gallons\n\nNew daily fuel cost: 2,833.33 gallons * $3/gallon = $8,500\n\nAnnual fuel cost with new software: $8,500/day * 365 days/year = $3,102,500\n\nNow, to find the annual savings:\n\nCurrent annual fuel cost: $3,650,000\n\nNew annual fuel cost: $3,102,500\n\nAnnual savings: $3,650,000 - $3,102,500 = $547,500\n\nSo, they could save $547,500 per year on fuel.\n\nNow, the software costs $500,000. I need to find out how long it would take for the savings to cover that cost.\n\nTime to pay off the investment: Cost of software / annual savings = $500,000 / $547,500 \u2248 0.91 years\n\nTo express that in months: 0.91 years * 12 months/year \u2248 10.92 months\n\nSo, it would take a little over 10 months for the savings to pay off the cost of the software.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with the daily miles: 100 trucks * 200 miles/truck/day = 20,000 miles/day\n\nFuel consumption: 20,000 miles / 6 mpg = 3,333.33 gallons/day\n\nCost: 3,333.33 gallons * $3/gallon = $10,000/day\n\nAnnual cost: $10,000/day * 365 days/year = $3,650,000/year\n\nWith 15% reduction: 20,000 miles/day * 0.15 = 3,000 miles/day reduction\n\nNew daily miles: 20,000 - 3,000 = 17,000 miles/day\n\nNew fuel consumption: 17,000 miles / 6 mpg = 2,833.33 gallons/day\n\nNew daily cost: 2,833.33 gallons * $3/gallon = $8,500/day\n\nAnnual new cost: $8,500/day * 365 days/year = $3,102,500/year\n\nSavings: $3,650,000 - $3,102,500 = $547,500/year\n\nPayback period: $500,000 / $547,500 \u2248 0.91 years or about 10.92 months\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But is there anything else I should consider?\n\nWell, perhaps the efficiency of the trucks could change with new routing, or maybe there are other costs involved beyond just fuel. But based on the information provided, this seems to be the direct savings from reduced fuel consumption.\n\nAlso, assuming that the reduction in mileage doesn't affect the delivery times or other constraints, which might be a factor in reality.\n\nBut for the purpose of this calculation, it seems straightforward.\n\nSo, the potential annual savings from reduced fuel consumption is $547,500, and the payback period for the $500,000 investment in routing software is approximately 10.92 months.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{10.92\\ \\text{months}}"
