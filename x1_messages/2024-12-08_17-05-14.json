Each tool should correspond with an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the functions given an input string that can be the user's question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools you have at your disposal:\nBing[input]: This tool allows the user to search for information using Bing search engine. It is useful in finding relevant sites that may contain the answer to the user's query.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts plain text from a webpage given its URL. The input must be a link and the output will be the content of the page in plain text.\nLinkCollector[input]: Collects all links present on a web page. Input is a single URL and output is a list of URLs found on the page.\nQAModel[input]: A model capable of answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe function inputs should be simple strings without quotes or \"+\" for concatenation. For example: QAModel[What is the capital of France, given :evidence1:?]\n\nEach plan step should only include one evidence output.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nPlan: [first action based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function call and input parameter, referencing previous evidence if necessary]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What is the history behind the construction of the Eiffel Tower and who were the main architects involved?"
