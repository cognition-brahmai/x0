        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular garden, and we're given two pieces of information: the perimeter is 50 meters, and the length is twice the width. We need to find the dimensions, which means we need to find both the length and the width of the garden.\n\nFirst, let's recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. The perimeter (P) is the sum of all its sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the formula is:\n\n\\[ P = 2l + 2w \\]\n\nwhere \\( l \\) is the length and \\( w \\) is the width.\n\nWe're told that the perimeter is 50 meters, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 2l + 2w = 50 \\]\n\nNext, we're given that the length is twice the width. That means:\n\n\\[ l = 2w \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( l \\) into the perimeter equation to solve for \\( w \\):\n\n\\[ 2(2w) + 2w = 50 \\]\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\[ 4w + 2w = 50 \\]\n\n\\[ 6w = 50 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 6 to solve for \\( w \\):\n\n\\[ w = \\frac{50}{6} \\]\n\n\\[ w = 8.\\overline{3} \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let's check our steps again.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[ 2l + 2w = 50 \\]\n\nAnd \\( l = 2w \\), so substituting:\n\n\\[ 2(2w) + 2w = 50 \\]\n\n\\[ 4w + 2w = 50 \\]\n\n\\[ 6w = 50 \\]\n\n\\[ w = \\frac{50}{6} \\]\n\nHmm, \\( \\frac{50}{6} \\) is approximately 8.333 meters, but I feel like there might be a mistake because the width should be a whole number or at least a more straightforward fraction. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nLet's consider that the perimeter is the total distance around the rectangle, which is 50 meters. If the length is twice the width, maybe I can think in terms of units. Let's say the width is one unit, then the length is two units. So, the perimeter would be 2 times the length plus 2 times the width, which is 2(2) + 2(1) = 6 units. But actually, the perimeter is 50 meters, so each unit corresponds to \\( \\frac{50}{6} \\) meters, which again gives us the same result as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the perimeter and solve for one variable in terms of the other.\n\nStarting again:\n\n\\[ P = 2l + 2w = 50 \\]\n\nAnd \\( l = 2w \\)\n\nSubstitute \\( l \\):\n\n\\[ 2(2w) + 2w = 50 \\]\n\n\\[ 4w + 2w = 50 \\]\n\n\\[ 6w = 50 \\]\n\n\\[ w = \\frac{50}{6} = \\frac{25}{3} \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nSo, the width is \\( \\frac{25}{3} \\) meters, which is approximately 8.333 meters.\n\nNow, to find the length, which is twice the width:\n\n\\[ l = 2 \\times \\frac{25}{3} = \\frac{50}{3} \\text{ meters} \\]\n\napproximately 16.666 meters.\n\nLet me verify if these dimensions indeed give us a perimeter of 50 meters.\n\nPerimeter = 2l + 2w = 2(\\frac{50}{3}) + 2(\\frac{25}{3}) = \\frac{100}{3} + \\frac{50}{3} = \\frac{150}{3} = 50 meters.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden are:\n\nLength: \\( \\frac{50}{3} \\) meters or approximately 16.666 meters\n\nWidth: \\( \\frac{25}{3} \\) meters or approximately 8.333 meters\n\nBut, to present it more cleanly, I can leave it in fractional form.\n\nTherefore, the exact dimensions are:\n\nLength: \\( \\frac{50}{3} \\) meters\n\nWidth: \\( \\frac{25}{3} \\) meters\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Length: } \\frac{50}{3} \\text{ meters}, \\text{ Width: } \\frac{25}{3} \\text{ meters}} \\]"
