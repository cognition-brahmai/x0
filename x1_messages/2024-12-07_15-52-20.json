        "content": "So there's a class with 30 students, and 60% of them are boys. I need to find out how many girls are in the class. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many boys there are. If 60% of the class are boys, then I can calculate the number of boys by taking 60% of 30.\n\nTo calculate 60% of 30, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. 60% is the same as 0.60. So, 0.60 times 30 should give me the number of boys.\n\nLet me do the multiplication: 0.60 \u00d7 30 = 18. So, there are 18 boys in the class.\n\nNow, to find the number of girls, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students.\n\nTotal students are 30, and boys are 18, so 30 - 18 = 12.\n\nTherefore, there are 12 girls in the class.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother way could be to calculate the percentage of girls first. If 60% are boys, then the remaining percentage must be girls. So, 100% - 60% = 40% are girls.\n\nNow, to find 40% of 30, I can convert 40% to a decimal, which is 0.40, and then multiply by 30.\n\nSo, 0.40 \u00d7 30 = 12.\n\nAgain, I get 12 girls in the class.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign. I think 12 is the correct number of girls in the class.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me confirm if the numbers make sense.\n\nIf there are 18 boys and 12 girls, that adds up to 30 students, which matches the total given. Also, 18 boys out of 30 is indeed 60%, since 18 divided by 30 is 0.60, or 60%.\n\nSimilarly, 12 girls out of 30 is 0.40, or 40%.\n\nEverything checks out. I'm confident that the answer is 12 girls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
