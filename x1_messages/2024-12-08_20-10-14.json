        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're trying to find three consecutive odd integers that add up to 63. First off, I need to remember what consecutive odd integers are. Consecutive odd integers are odd numbers that come one after the other without any even numbers in between. For example, 1, 3, 5 or 11, 13, 15, things like that.\n\nNow, how do I set this up to solve it? I think I should represent the three integers in terms of a variable. Let's say the first odd integer is x. Since they're consecutive odd numbers, the next one would be x + 2, and the one after that would be x + 4. So, the three integers are x, x + 2, and x + 4.\n\nNext, I need to set up an equation that says the sum of these three integers is 63. So, x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 63.\n\nNow, I'll simplify the left side: x + x + 2 + x + 4 = 63. Combining like terms, that's 3x + 6 = 63.\n\nThen, I'll subtract 6 from both sides to isolate the terms with x: 3x = 57.\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 19.\n\nSo, the first integer is 19, the second is 19 + 2 = 21, and the third is 19 + 4 = 23.\n\nLet me check if these are indeed consecutive odd integers and if their sum is 63.\n\n19, 21, 23 are all odd and consecutive.\n\nNow, 19 + 21 + 23 = 63.\n\nLet's add them up: 19 + 21 = 40, and 40 + 23 = 63. Perfect, it checks out.\n\nSo, the three integers are 19, 21, and 23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{19, 21, 23} \\]"
