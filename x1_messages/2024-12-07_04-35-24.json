        "content": "So, the train is going at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, and we need to find out how far it travels. Okay, let's think about this.\n\nI remember that when we talk about speed, distance, and time, there's a formula that connects them. The formula is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nIn this case, the speed is 60 miles per hour, and the time is 3 hours. So, if I plug these values into the formula, it should give me the distance.\n\nLet me write it down:\n\nDistance = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 3 hours\n\nNow, when I multiply miles per hour by hours, the hours cancel out, and I'm left with miles. So, it makes sense dimensionally.\n\nSo, 60 multiplied by 3 is 180. Therefore, the train travels 180 miles.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If the train is going 60 miles every hour, then in one hour it covers 60 miles. So, in two hours, it would cover 120 miles, and in three hours, it should be 180 miles. Yeah, that matches what I got from the formula.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Hmm. Maybe using conversion factors or something like that, but I think the formula is the most straightforward method.\n\nLet me consider if the speed is constant. The problem says the train travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour, and it's constant for 3 hours. So, no acceleration or changes in speed.\n\nAlternatively, if the speed was not constant, we might need to use calculus or average speed, but in this case, it's constant, so the formula works fine.\n\nAlso, just to be thorough, let's consider the units. Speed is in miles per hour, and time is in hours, so multiplying them gives miles, which is the unit for distance. So, that's correct.\n\nI think 180 miles is the right answer. I'm confident about this one.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]"
