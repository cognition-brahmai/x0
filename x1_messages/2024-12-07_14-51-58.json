        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a car dealership that starts with 200 cars in their inventory. Each month, they sell 20% of what they have and then add 50 new cars. We need to find out how many cars they'll have after 6 months.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the process that happens each month. They sell 20% of their current inventory and then add 50 cars. So, each month, the inventory changes in two steps: selling and restocking.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Maybe I can calculate the number of cars after each month, one at a time, for 6 months.\n\nStarting with month 1:\n\n- They have 200 cars.\n\n- They sell 20% of 200, which is 40 cars.\n\n- So, after selling, they have 200 - 40 = 160 cars.\n\n- Then, they add 50 new cars, so 160 + 50 = 210 cars.\n\nNow, for month 2:\n\n- They have 210 cars.\n\n- They sell 20% of 210, which is 42 cars.\n\n- After selling, they have 210 - 42 = 168 cars.\n\n- Add 50 new cars: 168 + 50 = 218 cars.\n\nMonth 3:\n\n- Start with 218 cars.\n\n- Sell 20% of 218, which is 43.6 cars. Since we're dealing with whole cars, I'll need to decide whether to round up or down. For now, I'll assume they sell 44 cars.\n\n- After selling: 218 - 44 = 174 cars.\n\n- Add 50: 174 + 50 = 224 cars.\n\nMonth 4:\n\n- Start with 224 cars.\n\n- Sell 20% of 224, which is 44.8 cars. Round to 45 cars.\n\n- After selling: 224 - 45 = 179 cars.\n\n- Add 50: 179 + 50 = 229 cars.\n\nMonth 5:\n\n- Start with 229 cars.\n\n- Sell 20% of 229, which is 45.8 cars. Round to 46 cars.\n\n- After selling: 229 - 46 = 183 cars.\n\n- Add 50: 183 + 50 = 233 cars.\n\nMonth 6:\n\n- Start with 233 cars.\n\n- Sell 20% of 233, which is 46.6 cars. Round to 47 cars.\n\n- After selling: 233 - 47 = 186 cars.\n\n- Add 50: 186 + 50 = 236 cars.\n\nSo, after 6 months, they would have 236 cars in inventory.\n\nWait a minute, I noticed that each month, after selling and restocking, the inventory seems to be increasing. Is there a pattern here? Maybe there's a way to calculate this without going through each month step by step.\n\nLet me think about it mathematically. Each month, they sell 20% of their inventory and add 50 cars. So, if I let I_n be the inventory at the start of month n, then the inventory at the start of month n+1 would be:\n\nI_{n+1} = I_n - 0.2 * I_n + 50 = 0.8 * I_n + 50\n\nThis is a recursive formula. So, I can apply this formula iteratively for 6 months, starting with I_0 = 200.\n\nLet me try calculating again using this formula to see if I get the same result.\n\nMonth 1:\n\nI_1 = 0.8 * 200 + 50 = 160 + 50 = 210\n\nMonth 2:\n\nI_2 = 0.8 * 210 + 50 = 168 + 50 = 218\n\nMonth 3:\n\nI_3 = 0.8 * 218 + 50 = 174.4 + 50 = 224.4 \u2248 224 cars (assuming we can't have a fraction of a car)\n\nMonth 4:\n\nI_4 = 0.8 * 224 + 50 = 179.2 + 50 = 229.2 \u2248 229 cars\n\nMonth 5:\n\nI_5 = 0.8 * 229 + 50 = 183.2 + 50 = 233.2 \u2248 233 cars\n\nMonth 6:\n\nI_6 = 0.8 * 233 + 50 = 186.4 + 50 = 236.4 \u2248 236 cars\n\nSo, again, I get 236 cars after 6 months.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to calculate this without iterating each month, especially if the number of months is larger. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for the inventory after n months.\n\nGiven the recursive formula:\n\nI_{n+1} = 0.8 * I_n + 50\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. I think I can solve it to find a general formula for I_n.\n\nFirst, let's find the steady-state inventory, which is the inventory level where I_{n+1} = I_n = I. So:\n\nI = 0.8 * I + 50\n\nSolving for I:\n\nI - 0.8*I = 50 => 0.2*I = 50 => I = 250\n\nSo, the steady-state inventory is 250 cars.\n\nNow, let's find the general solution for I_n. For linear recurrence relations of the form I_{n+1} = a*I_n + b, the general solution is:\n\nI_n = c * a^n + d\n\nWhere c and d are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nIn our case, a = 0.8 and b = 50.\n\nFrom the steady-state, we have d = 250.\n\nSo, I_n = c * (0.8)^n + 250\n\nNow, apply the initial condition: at n=0, I_0 = 200.\n\nSo:\n\n200 = c * (0.8)^0 + 250 => 200 = c * 1 + 250 => c = 200 - 250 = -50\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\nI_n = -50 * (0.8)^n + 250\n\nNow, let's find I_6:\n\nI_6 = -50 * (0.8)^6 + 250\n\nFirst, calculate (0.8)^6:\n\n0.8^1 = 0.8\n\n0.8^2 = 0.64\n\n0.8^3 = 0.512\n\n0.8^4 = 0.4096\n\n0.8^5 = 0.32768\n\n0.8^6 = 0.262144\n\nSo,\n\nI_6 = -50 * 0.262144 + 250 = -13.1072 + 250 \u2248 236.8928\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, I_6 \u2248 237 cars.\n\nWait, earlier I got 236 cars by iterating monthly, but now with the closed-form formula, I get approximately 237 cars. There's a discrepancy of one car. Probably due to rounding errors in the iterative approach.\n\nLet me check my earlier iterative calculations:\n\nMonth 1: 200 -> 160 - 40 = 160 + 50 = 210\n\nMonth 2: 210 - 42 = 168 + 50 = 218\n\nMonth 3: 218 - 43.6 \u2248 44 -> 174 + 50 = 224\n\nMonth 4: 224 - 44.8 \u2248 45 -> 179 + 50 = 229\n\nMonth 5: 229 - 45.8 \u2248 46 -> 183 + 50 = 233\n\nMonth 6: 233 - 46.6 \u2248 47 -> 186 + 50 = 236\n\nSo, the iterative approach gave 236, while the formula gave approximately 237. The difference is likely due to rounding in the iterative approach, especially since we're dealing with fractions of cars.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should not round the number of sold cars each month and keep them as decimals until the final answer.\n\nLet me try the iterative approach again without rounding:\n\nMonth 1:\n\nSell 20% of 200 = 40 -> Inventory: 200 - 40 = 160 + 50 = 210\n\nMonth 2:\n\nSell 20% of 210 = 42 -> Inventory: 210 - 42 = 168 + 50 = 218\n\nMonth 3:\n\nSell 20% of 218 = 43.6 -> Inventory: 218 - 43.6 = 174.4 + 50 = 224.4\n\nMonth 4:\n\nSell 20% of 224.4 = 44.88 -> Inventory: 224.4 - 44.88 = 179.52 + 50 = 229.52\n\nMonth 5:\n\nSell 20% of 229.52 = 45.904 -> Inventory: 229.52 - 45.904 = 183.616 + 50 = 233.616\n\nMonth 6:\n\nSell 20% of 233.616 = 46.7232 -> Inventory: 233.616 - 46.7232 = 186.8928 + 50 = 236.8928\n\nRounding 236.8928 gives 237 cars, which matches the closed-form formula result.\n\nSo, the more accurate answer should be 237 cars after 6 months.\n\nTherefore, the dealership will have approximately 237 cars in their inventory after 6 months.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{237} \\]"
