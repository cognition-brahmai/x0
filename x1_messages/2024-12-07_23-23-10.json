        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a box with 5 red balls and 7 blue balls. That means there are a total of 5 + 7 = 12 balls in the box initially.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of drawing 2 red balls followed by 1 blue ball without replacement. Without replacement means that once we draw a ball, we don't put it back into the box. So, the total number of balls decreases with each draw.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **First draw: Red ball**\n\n- There are 5 red balls out of 12 total balls.\n\n- So, the probability of drawing a red ball first is 5/12.\n\n2. **Second draw: Red ball**\n\n- Since we didn't replace the first red ball, there are now 4 red balls left.\n\n- The total number of balls is now 11 (since one ball has been removed).\n\n- So, the probability of drawing a second red ball is 4/11.\n\n3. **Third draw: Blue ball**\n\n- We've already drawn two red balls without replacement, so now there are still 7 blue balls.\n\n- The total number of balls is now 10 (since two balls have been removed).\n\n- So, the probability of drawing a blue ball third is 7/10.\n\nSince these are sequential events without replacement, we need to multiply these probabilities together to get the overall probability.\n\nSo, the overall probability is:\n\n(5/12) * (4/11) * (7/10)\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, multiply the numerators: 5 * 4 * 7 = 140\n\nThen, multiply the denominators: 12 * 11 * 10 = 1320\n\nSo, the probability is 140/1320.\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 20:\n\n140 \u00f7 20 = 7\n\n1320 \u00f7 20 = 66\n\nSo, it's 7/66.\n\nAlternatively, we can leave it as a decimal. Let's calculate that:\n\n140 \u00f7 1320 \u2248 0.10606\n\nSo, approximately 0.106, or 10.6%.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing 2 red balls followed by 1 blue ball without replacement is 7/66 or approximately 10.6%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{66}} \\]"
