        "content": "So, I've got this problem here: a rectangular room has an area of 200 square feet and a width of 10 feet. I need to find out what its length is. Okay, let's see. I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, area equals length times width, right? That makes sense because area is basically the space inside the rectangle, and multiplying the length and width gives you that.\n\nSo, if area = length \u00d7 width, and I know the area and the width, I should be able to rearrange this formula to solve for the length. Let's do that. If area = length \u00d7 width, then to find the length, I can divide both sides of the equation by the width. That should give me length = area \u00f7 width.\n\nAlright, plugging in the numbers I have: length = 200 square feet \u00f7 10 feet. When I do that division, the feet in the denominator and numerator will cancel out, right? Wait, no, actually, square feet divided by feet is feet, because square feet is feet squared, so feet squared divided by feet is feet to the power of two minus one, which is just feet. So, the units work out.\n\nSo, length = 200 \u00f7 10 = 20 feet. That seems straightforward. But let me double-check if I'm missing anything. Is there any other factor I should consider, like units or something else?\n\nOh, the problem gives the area in square feet and the width in feet, and I've calculated the length in feet, which seems consistent. I don't think there are any tricks here, like converting units or anything like that, because everything's already in feet.\n\nWait a minute, is there a possibility that the room isn't a perfect rectangle? Maybe it's a bit irregular, but the problem says it's rectangular, so I can assume it's a perfect rectangle.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent throughout the calculation. Since both area and width are in feet units (square feet and feet, respectively), dividing them should give me feet, which makes sense for length.\n\nLet me visualize this. If I have a rectangle that's 10 feet wide and 20 feet long, that would indeed give an area of 200 square feet. That seems correct.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using formulas for other shapes, but no, it's specified as a rectangle, so the area formula for a rectangle is the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of algebra. Let\u2019s say length is L and width is W, and area is A. So, A = L \u00d7 W. Given A and W, solve for L. So, L = A / W. Plugging in the values, L = 200 / 10 = 20 feet. Same answer.\n\nI could also consider if there's any real-world application or consideration, like wall thickness or anything like that, but in mathematical terms, for a perfect rectangle, the calculation is straightforward.\n\nSo, I think the length of the room is 20 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
