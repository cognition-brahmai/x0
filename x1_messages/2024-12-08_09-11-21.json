        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a car rental company with 120 cars, and they rent out 75% of them on a given day. Each rented car brings in $50 per day. We need to find out how much income they generate from the rentals that day.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many cars are rented out. Since they have 120 cars and rent out 75% of them, I can calculate the number of rented cars by multiplying 120 by 75%.\n\nBut wait, percentages can sometimes be tricky. I remember that 75% is the same as 75/100 or 0.75 in decimal form. So, to find 75% of 120, I can multiply 120 by 0.75.\n\nLet me do that: 120 \u00d7 0.75.\n\nWell, 120 times 0.75. I can break it down: 120 times 0.7 is 84, and 120 times 0.05 is 6. So, 84 plus 6 equals 90.\n\nAlternatively, I know that 75% is three-quarters (since 75 divided by 100 is 0.75, and 0.75 is the same as 3/4). So, three-quarters of 120 would be 120 divided by 4, which is 30, and then multiplied by 3, which is 90.\n\nOkay, so 90 cars are rented out.\n\nNext, each rented car brings in $50 per day. To find the total income, I need to multiply the number of rented cars by the income per car.\n\nSo, that's 90 cars times $50 per car.\n\n90 \u00d7 50.\n\nWell, 90 times 50. I can think of it as 90 times 50 equals 4,500.\n\nAlternatively, 9 times 5 is 45, and since there are two zeros in total (one from 50 and one from 90), it's 4,500.\n\nTherefore, the total income generated from the rentals that day is $4,500.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, number of cars rented: 120 times 75%, which is 90. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 90 cars times $50 per car: 90 \u00d7 50 = 4,500. Yeah, that looks right.\n\nSo, the income is $4,500.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect the income. For example, are there any additional costs or fees? But according to the problem, each rented car brings in $50 per day, and that's the only income mentioned. So, I think $4,500 is the correct total income for that day.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4500} \\]"
