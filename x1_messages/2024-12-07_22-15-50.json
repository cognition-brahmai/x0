        "content": "So I have this question here: a honey bee flaps its wings about 200 times per second. I need to find out how many times it flaps its wings in one hour. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the units involved. I have flaps per second, and I want to find out flaps per hour. So, I need to convert seconds into hours.\n\nI know that there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. So, to find out how many seconds are in an hour, I can multiply 60 seconds by 60 minutes.\n\nLet me calculate that: 60 seconds \u00d7 60 minutes = 3,600 seconds in one hour.\n\nNow, if the honey bee flaps its wings 200 times every second, then in one hour, it would flap its wings 200 times per second multiplied by the number of seconds in an hour.\n\nSo, that would be 200 flaps/second \u00d7 3,600 seconds/hour.\n\nLet me do the multiplication: 200 \u00d7 3,600.\n\nHmm, 200 times 3,600. I can simplify this calculation by breaking it down.\n\nI know that 200 \u00d7 3,000 is 600,000, and 200 \u00d7 600 is 120,000. So, adding those together: 600,000 + 120,000 = 720,000.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, 200 \u00d7 3,600:\n\nI can think of it as 2 \u00d7 3,600 \u00d7 100, since 200 is 2 \u00d7 100.\n\nSo, 2 \u00d7 3,600 = 7,200, and then 7,200 \u00d7 100 = 720,000.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that 200 \u00d7 3,600 is the same as 200 \u00d7 36 \u00d7 100.\n\nWait, no, better to stick with the first method.\n\nSo, 200 \u00d7 3,600 = 720,000.\n\nTherefore, the honey bee flaps its wings 720,000 times in one hour.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nI started with flaps per second and converted seconds to hours by multiplying by the number of seconds in an hour.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of units:\n\nflaps/second \u00d7 seconds/hour = flaps/hour.\n\nSo, 200 flaps/second \u00d7 3,600 seconds/hour = 720,000 flaps/hour.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{720000} \\]"
