        "content": "So there's a class with 40 students, and 55% of them are girls. I need to find out how many boys there are. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many girls there are. If 55% of the class are girls, then I can calculate the number of girls by taking 55% of 40.\n\nTo calculate that, I can multiply 40 by 55% or 0.55. So, 40 times 0.55 equals... let's see, 40 times 0.5 is 20, and 40 times 0.05 is 2, so adding those together, 20 plus 2 equals 22. So, there are 22 girls in the class.\n\nNow, to find out how many boys there are, I can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students. So, 40 minus 22 equals 18.\n\nTherefore, there are 18 boys in the class.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Since 55% are girls, then the remaining percentage must be boys. So, 100% minus 55% equals 45%. So, boys make up 45% of the class.\n\nNow, to find 45% of 40, I can multiply 40 by 0.45. That's 40 times 0.4 is 16, and 40 times 0.05 is 2, so 16 plus 2 equals 18.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, there are indeed 18 boys in the class.\n\nAlternatively, I could have thought of it in terms of fractions. 55% is the same as 55/100, which simplifies to 11/20. So, the number of girls is 11/20 of 40, which is (11/20) * 40 = (11 * 40)/20 = 440/20 = 22. Again, confirming that there are 22 girls.\n\nThen, subtracting 22 from 40 gives me 18 boys.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to set up an equation. Let G be the number of girls and B be the number of boys. We know that G + B = 40, and G = 0.55 * 40.\n\nSo, G = 22, and plugging that back into the first equation, 22 + B = 40. Solving for B, B = 40 - 22 = 18.\n\nThis confirms again that there are 18 boys in the class.\n\nI think I've approached this from a few different angles and keep arriving at the same answer, so I'm confident that 18 is the correct number of boys in the class.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
