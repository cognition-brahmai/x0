        "content": "So here's this puzzle about a man building a house that's rectangular and has all sides facing south, and there's a big bear walking by. The question is, what color is the bear and why?\n\nHmm, okay, first things first. The house is rectangular and all sides face south. That sounds a bit tricky because normally, in a rectangle, each side faces a different direction. But here, all sides face south. So, there must be something unique about the location of this house.\n\nI think this has something to do with geography, specifically about directions and locations on Earth. Let me think about directions. If you're standing somewhere on Earth, the direction south is always towards the South Pole.\n\nNow, if all sides of the house face south, that means no matter which wall you're next to, you're facing south. That seems impossible in most places because walls are usually facing different directions.\n\nBut wait, there might be a specific point on Earth where this is possible. Let's consider the North Pole. At the North Pole, every direction is south. So, if the house is built right at the North Pole, then all sides of the house would face south.\n\nThat makes sense. So, the house is built at the North Pole.\n\nNow, there's a big bear walking by. Bears come in different colors, but in the context of the North Pole, the most likely bear would be a polar bear, which is white.\n\nSo, the bear is white because it's a polar bear, and polar bears are found in the Arctic region, which includes the North Pole.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is \"what color is the bear? Why?\" So, the color is white because it's a polar bear, and polar bears are white to blend in with the snow and ice in their environment.\n\nBut let's double-check if there are other types of bears that could be in that area. For example, there are grizzly bears or brown bears, but they're not typically found at the North Pole. They're more common in lower latitudes or different climates.\n\nSo, the most logical answer is that the bear is white, and it's a polar bear because it's at the North Pole.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other possible location where all sides of a house could face south. Is there any other place on Earth where this could happen?\n\nWell, if you think about it, the only place where all directions are south is the North Pole. Similarly, at the South Pole, all directions are north. But in this case, the house has all sides facing south, so it must be the North Pole.\n\nTherefore, the bear is a polar bear, which is white.\n\nI think that's the answer. Simple yet clever, using geography and understanding of directions and animal habitats.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{white}} \\]"
