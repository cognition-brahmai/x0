        "content": "To find the area of the garden in square feet, I need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the area in square meters:**\n   The garden is rectangular, so the area in square meters is length multiplied by width.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area in square meters} = 20 \\, \\text{meters} \\times 15 \\, \\text{meters} = 300 \\, \\text{square meters}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert the area from square meters to square feet:**\n   I know that 1 meter is equal to 3.28084 feet. However, since we're dealing with area, I need to convert square meters to square feet. The conversion factor for area is the square of the linear conversion factor.\n   \\[\n   1 \\, \\text{square meter} = (3.28084 \\, \\text{feet})^2 = 10.7639 \\, \\text{square feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the area in square meters by the conversion factor:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area in square feet} = 300 \\, \\text{square meters} \\times 10.7639 \\, \\text{square feet per square meter} = 3229.17 \\, \\text{square feet}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the area of the garden is approximately 3229.17 square feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\[ \\boxed{3229.17} \\]"
