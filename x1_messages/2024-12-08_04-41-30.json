        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I have a rectangular garden that's currently 20 feet by 30 feet, and I want to increase its area by 50% by adding some extra width to one side and some extra length to the other side. The tricky part is that I need to add an equal amount to both the width and the length. Hmm, that sounds a bit confusing at first, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to find out what the current area of the garden is. Since it's a rectangle, area is just length times width, right? So, 20 feet times 30 feet equals 600 square feet. That's the original area.\n\nNow, I want to increase this area by 50%. So, what's 50% of 600 square feet? Well, 50% of 600 is 300 square feet. Therefore, the new area should be 600 plus 300, which is 900 square feet.\n\nOkay, so the new area needs to be 900 square feet. The problem says I need to add an equal amount of width to one side and length to the other side. Wait, that seems a bit unclear. Let me make sure I understand this.\n\nI think it means that I'll be adding a certain amount, let's say x feet, to the width of one side and to the length of the other side. But actually, since it's a rectangle, adding to the width affects both sides, and same with the length. Hmm, maybe I need to visualize this.\n\nLet me draw a diagram to make this clearer. I have a rectangle that's 20 feet by 30 feet. Let's say the width is 20 feet and the length is 30 feet.\n\nNow, I need to add an equal amount, say x feet, to one side's width and to the other side's length. Wait, I'm still a bit confused.\n\nPerhaps it means that I'm adding x feet to the width and x feet to the length, but not necessarily to both sides of each. Maybe it's adding x feet to just one width side and x feet to just one length side.\n\nLet me try to interpret it as adding x feet to the width and x feet to the length, making the new dimensions (20 + x) feet in width and (30 + x) feet in length.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"adding an equal amount of width on one side and length on the other side.\" Maybe it means adding x to the width and x to the length, making it a new rectangle with dimensions (20 + x) by (30 + x).\n\nIf that's the case, then the new area would be (20 + x)(30 + x), and that should equal 900 square feet.\n\nSo, let's set up the equation:\n\n(20 + x)(30 + x) = 900\n\nNow, I need to solve for x.\n\nFirst, expand the left side:\n\n20*30 + 20*x + 30*x + x^2 = 900\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n600 + 50x + x^2 = 900\n\nNow, bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\nx^2 + 50x + 600 - 900 = 0\n\nx^2 + 50x - 300 = 0\n\nAlright, now I have a quadratic equation: x^2 + 50x - 300 = 0.\n\nI can solve this using the quadratic formula, which is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a), where a = 1, b = 50, and c = -300.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discriminant: b^2 - 4ac = 50^2 - 4*1*(-300) = 2500 + 1200 = 3700.\n\nNow, sqrt(3700) is... let's see, 3700 is 100*37, so sqrt(3700) = sqrt(100)*sqrt(37) = 10*sqrt(37).\n\nSo, x = [-50 \u00b1 10*sqrt(37)] / 2.\n\nSimplify this:\n\nx = [-50 + 10*sqrt(37)] / 2 or x = [-50 - 10*sqrt(37)] / 2.\n\nDivide both terms by 2:\n\nx = -25 + 5*sqrt(37) or x = -25 - 5*sqrt(37).\n\nNow, since we're dealing with physical dimensions, x has to be a positive value. So, we can discard the negative solution.\n\nTherefore, x = -25 + 5*sqrt(37).\n\nLet me calculate the numerical value of this.\n\nFirst, find sqrt(37). 37 is between 25 and 36, so sqrt(37) is between 5 and 6. More precisely, sqrt(37) is approximately 6.0828.\n\nSo, x = -25 + 5*(6.0828) = -25 + 30.414 = 5.414 feet.\n\nTherefore, I need to add approximately 5.414 feet to both the width and the length.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nOriginal area: 20*30 = 600 sq ft.\n\nNew dimensions: 20 + 5.414 = 25.414 ft and 30 + 5.414 = 35.414 ft.\n\nNew area: 25.414 * 35.414 \u2248 899.99 sq ft, which is approximately 900 sq ft, which is a 50% increase from 600 sq ft.\n\nSo, that checks out.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says \"adding an equal amount of width on one side and length on the other side.\" Maybe it's not adding x to both width and length, but adding x to just one side of the width and one side of the length.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nPerhaps, it means that I'm adding x to the width, making the new width 20 + x, and adding x to the length, making the new length 30 + x, but only adding to one side each.\n\nWait, that's similar to what I did before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it means adding x to one width side and x to one length side, but not to both sides.\n\nWait, that might not change the overall dimensions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it means adding x to the width, so the width becomes 20 + 2x (since both sides would be widened by x), and adding x to the length, making the length 30 + 2x.\n\nWait, that might make more sense.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nIf I add x to one width side, the width increases by x, but since a rectangle has two width sides, maybe I need to add x to both sides, making the width increase by 2x.\n\nSimilarly, adding x to one length side would make the length increase by x, but since there are two length sides, maybe it's adding x to both sides, making it an increase of 2x.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look up how adding to one side of a rectangle affects its dimensions.\n\nActually, in standard rectangle dimension problems, adding x to one side typically means adding x to that dimension, not necessarily to both sides.\n\nFor example, if I have a garden that's 20 ft wide and 30 ft long, and I add x ft to the width, the new width is 20 + x ft.\n\nSimilarly, if I add x ft to the length, the new length is 30 + x ft.\n\nSo, the area would be (20 + x)(30 + x).\n\nThat's what I did earlier.\n\nBut maybe the problem means adding x to just one side of the width and one side of the length, which might not directly affect the overall dimensions.\n\nWait, that's getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps I should stick with my initial approach.\n\nOriginal area: 20 * 30 = 600 sq ft.\n\nDesired new area: 600 * 1.5 = 900 sq ft.\n\nSet up the equation: (20 + x)(30 + x) = 900.\n\nSolve for x: x^2 + 50x + 600 - 900 = 0 \u2192 x^2 + 50x - 300 = 0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: x = [-50 \u00b1 sqrt(2500 + 1200)] / 2 = [-50 \u00b1 sqrt(3700)] / 2.\n\nSimplify: x = -25 \u00b1 5*sqrt(37).\n\nTake the positive root: x \u2248 -25 + 5*(6.0828) \u2248 5.414 ft.\n\nSo, adding approximately 5.414 feet to both the width and the length should achieve the desired area increase.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nLet me consider that I add x to the width and y to the length, with x = y, since it's an equal amount.\n\nSo, new dimensions: (20 + x) and (30 + y), but since x = y, it's (20 + x) and (30 + x).\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's adding x to one width side and x to one length side, resulting in new dimensions of 20 + x and 30 + x.\n\nAgain, same as before.\n\nI think my initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is to add approximately 5.414 feet to both the width and the length.\n\nBut to be precise, it's x = -25 + 5*sqrt(37) feet.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem meant something else, perhaps adding x to only one side of the width and one side of the length, affecting the overall dimensions differently, but I think that would complicate things further.\n\nI think sticking with the initial interpretation is best.\n\nSo, the final answer is to add approximately 5.414 feet to both the width and the length of the garden.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5.414 \\text{ feet}} \\]"
