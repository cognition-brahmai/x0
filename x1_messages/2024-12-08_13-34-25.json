        "content": "So there are 12 red balls and 8 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 20 balls. We want to find the probability of picking two red balls without replacement. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the probability of picking a red ball on the first draw. There are 12 red balls out of 20 total balls, so the probability is 12/20, which simplifies to 3/5.\n\nNow, since we're not replacing the first ball, there are now 11 red balls left and a total of 19 balls in the bag. So, the probability of picking another red ball is 11/19.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, we multiply the probabilities together. So, it's (3/5) * (11/19).\n\nLet me calculate that. 3/5 times 11/19 is (3*11)/(5*19) = 33/95.\n\nSo, the probability of picking two red balls without replacement is 33/95.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think about it another way. The total number of ways to pick 2 red balls out of 12 is combinations of 12 choose 2, which is (12*11)/2 = 66.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick any 2 balls out of 20 is 20 choose 2, which is (20*19)/2 = 190.\n\nSo, the probability should be 66/190, which simplifies to 33/95. Yeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the hypergeometric distribution, but since we're just picking without replacement, the method I used should be sufficient.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using permutations instead of combinations.\n\nIf I consider the order matters, then for the first pick, the probability of getting a red ball is 12/20. For the second pick, it's 11/19, just like before. Multiplying them gives 33/95 again.\n\nAlternatively, if order doesn't matter, using combinations gives the same result. So, regardless of the approach, the answer remains 33/95.\n\nI think that's the correct probability. Unless I made a calculation error, but both methods give me the same answer, so I'm confident.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{33}{95}} \\]"
