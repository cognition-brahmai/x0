        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 cats in the room. Each cat is supposed to catch 3 mice, but one cat is lazy and only catches 1 mouse. So, I need to find out how many mice were caught in total.\n\nFirst, if all 5 cats caught 3 mice each, the total would be 5 times 3, which is 15 mice. But one cat only caught 1 mouse instead of 3. So, I need to adjust for that.\n\nMaybe I can think of it this way: four cats caught the full 3 mice each, and one cat caught only 1 mouse. So, four cats times 3 mice is 12 mice, plus 1 mouse from the lazy cat, which totals 13 mice.\n\nAlternatively, starting from the initial total of 15 mice, if one cat caught 2 mice fewer than it should have (since 3 minus 1 is 2), then I can subtract those 2 mice from the initial total. So, 15 minus 2 equals 13 mice.\n\nWait, is there another way to look at this? Let me see. If I consider that each of the 5 cats caught 3 mice, that's 15 mice, but since one cat only caught 1, I need to adjust for the difference.\n\nThe difference for that one cat is 3 minus 1, which is 2 mice fewer. So, subtracting 2 from the total of 15 gives me 13 mice, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI can also think about it by calculating the total mice caught by the diligent cats and adding the mice caught by the lazy cat. There are 4 diligent cats (since one is lazy), and each catches 3 mice, so 4 times 3 is 12 mice. The lazy cat catches 1 mouse. Therefore, 12 plus 1 equals 13 mice in total.\n\nAnother way to verify this is to consider that the average number of mice caught per cat is slightly less than 3 because one cat caught fewer. But I'm not sure if that's necessary for this problem.\n\nLet me check my calculations again to be sure. Four cats catch 3 mice each: 4 * 3 = 12 mice. One cat catches 1 mouse: 1 * 1 = 1 mouse. Total mice caught: 12 + 1 = 13 mice.\n\nAlternatively, if all five cats caught 3 mice, it would be 15 mice, but since one cat only caught 1 mouse, it's 15 - 2 = 13 mice.\n\nYes, I think 13 is the correct total number of mice caught.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
