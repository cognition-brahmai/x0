        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the farmer has 15 acres of land and wants to plant a mix of corn and soybeans. The ratio of corn to soybeans is 3 acres of corn for every 2 acres of soybeans. Okay, so we need to figure out how many acres of each crop he will plant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio of 3:2 for corn to soybeans means that for every 3 parts of corn, there are 2 parts of soybeans. So, the total parts of land being used are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nNow, the farmer has 15 acres in total. If 5 parts represent the whole land, then each part must be equal to 15 acres divided by 5 parts. So, each part is 15 / 5 = 3 acres.\n\nNow, since corn is 3 parts, the acres of corn would be 3 parts times 3 acres per part, which is 9 acres. And for soybeans, it's 2 parts times 3 acres per part, which is 6 acres.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't add up to 15 acres because 9 + 6 = 15. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check. The ratio is 3:2, and we've allocated 9 acres of corn and 6 acres of soybeans. So, 9 divided by 3 is 3, and 6 divided by 2 is also 3. So, the ratio holds.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of variables. Let\u2019s say the number of acres of corn is 3x and soybeans is 2x. Then, 3x + 2x = 15. So, 5x = 15, which means x = 3. Therefore, corn is 3*3 = 9 acres, and soybeans is 2*3 = 6 acres.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the fraction of the total land that each crop occupies. For corn, it's 3 parts out of 5, so 3/5 of 15 acres is 9 acres. For soybeans, it's 2 parts out of 5, so 2/5 of 15 acres is 6 acres.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion: the farmer should plant 9 acres of corn and 6 acres of soybeans.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this. Suppose the farmer plants only corn. At the ratio of 3:2, if he plants 3 acres of corn, he should plant 2 acres of soybeans. So, for every 3 acres of corn, there are 2 acres of soybeans.\n\nBut the total land is 15 acres. So, how many sets of 5 acres (3+2) can he fit into 15 acres? Well, 15 divided by 5 is 3. So, he can have 3 sets of 3 acres of corn and 2 acres of soybeans.\n\nTherefore, 3 sets times 3 acres of corn per set equals 9 acres of corn. And 3 sets times 2 acres of soybeans per set equals 6 acres of soybeans.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think I've confirmed it thoroughly. The farmer should plant 9 acres of corn and 6 acres of soybeans.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9 \\text{ acres of corn and } 6 \\text{ acres of soybeans}} \\]"
