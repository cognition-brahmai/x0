        "content": "Reversing a singly linked list without using any additional data structures is a classic problem in computer science, often encountered in interviews and algorithm courses. The challenge lies in manipulating the pointers of the nodes to reverse the direction of the list efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n\nTo reverse a singly linked list in-place, we need to adjust the pointers of each node so that each node points to its previous node instead of its next node. This requires careful manipulation of pointers to avoid losing the reference to the nodes.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - We need three pointers: `previous`, `current`, and `next`.\n   - Initialize `previous` to `null` and `current` to the head of the list.\n\n2. **Traversal and Pointer Adjustment:**\n   - Traverse the list by updating the `next` pointer of the `current` node to point to the `previous` node.\n   - Move the `previous` and `current` pointers forward by setting `previous` to `current` and `current` to `next`.\n\n3. **Termination:**\n   - The loop continues until `current` becomes `null`, which means the end of the original list has been reached.\n   - At this point, the `previous` pointer will be at the new head of the reversed list.\n\n4. **Update Head:**\n   - Set the head of the list to the `previous` pointer.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```javascript\nclass ListNode {\n    constructor(val = 0, next = null) {\n        this.val = val;\n        this.next = next;\n    }\n}\n\nfunction reverseLinkedList(head) {\n    let previous = null;\n    let current = head;\n    \n    while (current !== null) {\n        const next = current.next; // Temporarily store the next node\n        current.next = previous;   // Reverse the pointer\n        previous = current;        // Move previous forward\n        current = next;            // Move current forward\n    }\n    \n    return previous; // New head of the reversed list\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - `previous` starts as `null` because the new tail of the reversed list should point to `null`.\n   - `current` starts at the head of the list.\n\n2. **Traversal and Pointer Adjustment:**\n   - For each node, we first store the next node in a temporary variable `next`.\n   - We then reverse the `next` pointer of the current node to point to `previous`.\n   - We move `previous` to the current node and `current` to the next node.\n\n3. **Termination:**\n   - When `current` becomes `null`, the list has been fully traversed.\n   - `previous` now points to the new head of the reversed list.\n\nThis method ensures that the list is reversed in-place with O(1) extra space and O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of nodes in the list."
