        "content": "To create a Python-based command-line tool that interacts with the GitHub API to retrieve and display information about a user's repositories, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up your development environment:**\n   - Ensure Python is installed on your system.\n   - Install necessary libraries: `requests` for making HTTP requests and `click` for creating command-line interfaces.\n\n2. **Install required libraries:**\n   You can install the required libraries using pip:\n   ```sh\n   pip install requests click\n   ```\n\n3. **Understand the GitHub API:**\n   - The GitHub API endpoint for user repositories is `https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos`.\n   - You may need to handle authentication if you're accessing private repositories or rate-limited data.\n\n4. **Design the command-line tool:**\n   - Use the `click` library to create a simple CLI.\n   - Allow the user to input their GitHub username.\n   - Retrieve and display repository information such as name, description, and number of stars.\n\n5. **Implement the tool:**\n   - Make a GET request to the GitHub API.\n   - Parse the JSON response to extract repository details.\n   - Handle potential errors, such as invalid usernames or network issues.\n\n6. **Test the tool:**\n   - Run the tool with different usernames to ensure it works correctly.\n   - Handle edge cases, such as users with no repositories or large numbers of repositories.\n\nHere's a sample implementation to get you started:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport click\n\n@click.command()\n@click.argument('username')\ndef main(username):\n    url = f\"https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos\"\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    \n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        repos = response.json()\n        if not repos:\n            click.echo(f\"No repositories found for user: {username}\")\n            return\n        for repo in repos:\n            click.echo(f\"Name: {repo['name']}\")\n            click.echo(f\"Description: {repo['description'] or 'No description provided'}\")\n            click.echo(f\"Stars: {repo['stargazers_count']}\")\n            click.echo(\"-\" * 40)\n    else:\n        click.echo(f\"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Click Library:** Used to create a command-line interface that takes a username as an argument.\n- **Requests Library:** Used to make a GET request to the GitHub API.\n- **Error Handling:** Checks the response status code and handles errors accordingly.\n- **Output:** Displays repository names, descriptions, and star counts in a formatted manner.\n\n### Running the Tool:\nSave the script to a file, for example, `github_repos.py`, and run it from the command line:\n```sh\npython github_repos.py <username>\n```\nReplace `<username>` with the desired GitHub username.\n\nThis tool provides a straightforward way to retrieve and display GitHub repository information using Python and the GitHub API.\n"
