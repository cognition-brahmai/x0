        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a car dealership that starts with 200 cars in their inventory. Each month, they sell 20% of what they have and then add 50 new cars. We need to find out how many cars they'll have after 6 months.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the monthly cycle:\n\n1. They sell 20% of their current inventory.\n\n2. Then, they restock with 50 new cars.\n\nThis process repeats every month for 6 months. Since the amount they sell each month depends on the current inventory, which changes every month, this seems like it might require calculating the inventory month by month.\n\nLet me try to break it down month by month.\n\n**Month 0 (starting inventory):** 200 cars\n\n**Month 1:**\n\n- Sell 20% of 200: 0.20 * 200 = 40 cars sold\n\n- Remaining cars: 200 - 40 = 160 cars\n\n- Restock: +50 cars\n\n- New inventory: 160 + 50 = 210 cars\n\n**Month 2:**\n\n- Sell 20% of 210: 0.20 * 210 = 42 cars sold\n\n- Remaining cars: 210 - 42 = 168 cars\n\n- Restock: +50 cars\n\n- New inventory: 168 + 50 = 218 cars\n\n**Month 3:**\n\n- Sell 20% of 218: 0.20 * 218 = 43.6 cars sold\n\n- Since we can't sell a fraction of a car, I'll need to decide how to handle this. Maybe round to the nearest whole number?\n\n- Let's round 43.6 to 44 cars sold\n\n- Remaining cars: 218 - 44 = 174 cars\n\n- Restock: +50 cars\n\n- New inventory: 174 + 50 = 224 cars\n\n**Month 4:**\n\n- Sell 20% of 224: 0.20 * 224 = 44.8 cars sold\n\n- Rounding 44.8 to 45 cars sold\n\n- Remaining cars: 224 - 45 = 179 cars\n\n- Restock: +50 cars\n\n- New inventory: 179 + 50 = 229 cars\n\n**Month 5:**\n\n- Sell 20% of 229: 0.20 * 229 = 45.8 cars sold\n\n- Rounding 45.8 to 46 cars sold\n\n- Remaining cars: 229 - 46 = 183 cars\n\n- Restock: +50 cars\n\n- New inventory: 183 + 50 = 233 cars\n\n**Month 6:**\n\n- Sell 20% of 233: 0.20 * 233 = 46.6 cars sold\n\n- Rounding 46.6 to 47 cars sold\n\n- Remaining cars: 233 - 47 = 186 cars\n\n- Restock: +50 cars\n\n- New inventory: 186 + 50 = 236 cars\n\nSo, after 6 months, the dealership would have 236 cars in their inventory.\n\nWait a minute, I noticed that each month, after selling and restocking, the inventory seems to be increasing. Is there a pattern here? Let me see if there's a way to model this mathematically instead of calculating each month separately.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the inventory at the start as \\( I_0 = 200 \\) cars.\n\nEach month, the following happens:\n\n1. Sell 20% of the current inventory: \\( 0.20 \\times I_n \\)\n\n2. Remaining cars: \\( I_n - 0.20 \\times I_n = 0.80 \\times I_n \\)\n\n3. Restock: \\( +50 \\) cars\n\nSo, the new inventory for the next month is: \\( I_{n+1} = 0.80 \\times I_n + 50 \\)\n\nThis is a recursive formula. To find the inventory after 6 months, I can apply this formula iteratively for 6 times.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n**Month 1:**\n\n\\( I_1 = 0.80 \\times 200 + 50 = 160 + 50 = 210 \\)\n\n**Month 2:**\n\n\\( I_2 = 0.80 \\times 210 + 50 = 168 + 50 = 218 \\)\n\n**Month 3:**\n\n\\( I_3 = 0.80 \\times 218 + 50 = 174.4 + 50 = 224.4 \\)\n\n**Month 4:**\n\n\\( I_4 = 0.80 \\times 224.4 + 50 = 179.52 + 50 = 229.52 \\)\n\n**Month 5:**\n\n\\( I_5 = 0.80 \\times 229.52 + 50 = 183.616 + 50 = 233.616 \\)\n\n**Month 6:**\n\n\\( I_6 = 0.80 \\times 233.616 + 50 = 186.8928 + 50 = 236.8928 \\)\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, \\( I_6 \\approx 237 \\) cars.\n\nWait, earlier I got 236 cars, but now it's 237. Probably, I rounded differently in the first approach. To be precise, I should avoid rounding until the final step.\n\nLet me try to calculate it again without rounding intermediate steps.\n\n**Month 1:**\n\n\\( I_1 = 0.80 \\times 200 + 50 = 160 + 50 = 210 \\)\n\n**Month 2:**\n\n\\( I_2 = 0.80 \\times 210 + 50 = 168 + 50 = 218 \\)\n\n**Month 3:**\n\n\\( I_3 = 0.80 \\times 218 + 50 = 174.4 + 50 = 224.4 \\)\n\n**Month 4:**\n\n\\( I_4 = 0.80 \\times 224.4 + 50 = 179.52 + 50 = 229.52 \\)\n\n**Month 5:**\n\n\\( I_5 = 0.80 \\times 229.52 + 50 = 183.616 + 50 = 233.616 \\)\n\n**Month 6:**\n\n\\( I_6 = 0.80 \\times 233.616 + 50 = 186.8928 + 50 = 236.8928 \\)\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number gives 237 cars.\n\nSo, the final inventory after 6 months is approximately 237 cars.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to find a closed-form solution for this recursive formula? It might be more efficient, especially for larger numbers of months.\n\nThe recursive formula is:\n\n\\( I_{n+1} = 0.80 \\times I_n + 50 \\)\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. I think it can be solved to find a direct formula for \\( I_n \\).\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\n\\( I_n = a \\times (0.80)^n + b \\)\n\nWhere \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are constants to be determined.\n\nFirst, we need to find the particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (50), we can assume that the particular solution is also a constant, say \\( I_n = c \\).\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\n\\( c = 0.80 c + 50 \\)\n\nSolving for \\( c \\):\n\n\\( c - 0.80 c = 50 \\)\n\n\\( 0.20 c = 50 \\)\n\n\\( c = 250 \\)\n\nSo, the particular solution is \\( I_n = 250 \\).\n\nThe homogeneous solution is \\( I_n = a \\times (0.80)^n \\)\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\n\\( I_n = a \\times (0.80)^n + 250 \\)\n\nNow, we use the initial condition to find \\( a \\).\n\nAt \\( n = 0 \\), \\( I_0 = 200 \\):\n\n\\( 200 = a \\times (0.80)^0 + 250 \\)\n\n\\( 200 = a \\times 1 + 250 \\)\n\n\\( 200 = a + 250 \\)\n\n\\( a = 200 - 250 = -50 \\)\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n\\( I_n = -50 \\times (0.80)^n + 250 \\)\n\nNow, let's find \\( I_6 \\):\n\n\\( I_6 = -50 \\times (0.80)^6 + 250 \\)\n\nFirst, calculate \\( (0.80)^6 \\):\n\n\\( 0.80^1 = 0.80 \\)\n\n\\( 0.80^2 = 0.64 \\)\n\n\\( 0.80^3 = 0.512 \\)\n\n\\( 0.80^4 = 0.4096 \\)\n\n\\( 0.80^5 = 0.32768 \\)\n\n\\( 0.80^6 = 0.262144 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( I_6 = -50 \\times 0.262144 + 250 \\)\n\n\\( I_6 = -13.1072 + 250 \\)\n\n\\( I_6 = 236.8928 \\)\n\nAgain, rounding to the nearest whole number, \\( I_6 \\approx 237 \\) cars.\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, since the dealership is selling 20% of its inventory each month and then adding 50 cars, it seems like the inventory is approaching a steady state.\n\nFrom the closed-form solution, as \\( n \\) approaches infinity, \\( (0.80)^n \\) approaches 0, so \\( I_n \\) approaches 250 cars.\n\nAfter 6 months, with starting inventory at 200, the inventory has increased to approximately 237 cars, moving towards the steady state of 250 cars.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is approximately 237 cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{237} \\]"
