        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 widgets per day, and each widget weighs 2 pounds. So, first, I need to find out the total weight of the widgets produced in one day. That should be 500 widgets multiplied by 2 pounds per widget, right? So, 500 times 2 is 1000 pounds. Now, each box can hold a maximum of 50 pounds. To find out how many boxes are needed to ship 1000 pounds of widgets, I need to divide the total weight by the capacity of each box. So, 1000 divided by 50 is 20. Therefore, the factory needs 20 boxes to ship one day's production.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If each box holds 50 pounds, and the total weight is 1000 pounds, then 20 boxes times 50 pounds per box equals 1000 pounds. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how many widgets each box can hold. Since each widget is 2 pounds, and each box can hold 50 pounds, then each box can hold 50 divided by 2, which is 25 widgets. So, with 500 widgets, divided by 25 widgets per box, that also gives me 20 boxes. So, both methods lead to the same answer, which is a good sign.\n\nI think that's the correct number of boxes needed. [Final Answer]"
