        "content": "So you have $1000 and you're spending $50 every day. You want to know after how many days you'll run out of money. Let's figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"running out of money\" means in this context. Does it mean you have exactly $0 left, or does it mean you can't make another $50 spending? For simplicity, let's assume you run out of money when you can't make another $50 spending, so effectively when you have less than $50 left.\n\nBut actually, if you have exactly $0, you can't spend another $50, so maybe it's better to consider that you run out when you have less than $50. But to make it straightforward, let's just see how many full $50 spends you can make with $1000.\n\nSo, you start with $1000 and spend $50 each day. To find out how many days this will last, you can divide the total amount by the daily spending.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal money = $1000\n\nDaily spending = $50\n\nNumber of days = Total money / Daily spending\n\nSo, number of days = 1000 / 50\n\nLet me do the division:\n\n1000 divided by 50 is 20.\n\nSo, 20 days.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.\n\nIf you spend $50 each day, after 1 day you have $950 left.\n\nAfter 2 days, $900 left.\n\nAfter 3 days, $850 left.\n\n...\n\nAfter 19 days, $1000 - (19 * 50) = $1000 - $950 = $50 left.\n\nAfter 20 days, $50 - $50 = $0 left.\n\nAfter 21 days, you would need to spend another $50, but you have $0, so you can't.\n\nTherefore, you run out of money after 20 days.\n\nAlternatively, you can think of it as the number of $50 increments in $1000.\n\nSince 50 * 20 = 1000, it's exactly 20 days.\n\nSo, the answer is 20 days.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose you plot your money over time.\n\nStarting at $1000, decreasing by $50 each day.\n\nSo, money = 1000 - 50 * days.\n\nYou want to find when money <= 0.\n\nSet up the inequality:\n\n1000 - 50 * days <= 0\n\nSolve for days:\n\n1000 <= 50 * days\n\nDivide both sides by 50:\n\n1000 / 50 <= days\n\n20 <= days\n\nSo, days >= 20.\n\nMeaning, on the 20th day, you reach $0, and can't spend another $50.\n\nTherefore, you run out of money after 20 days.\n\nAlternatively, if you consider that on the 20th day, you spend the last $50 and have $0 left, and on the 21st day, you can't spend because you have less than $50, then you run out on the 21st day.\n\nBut logically, you run out when you can't make the next spending, which would be on the 21st day.\n\nBut in terms of how many full days you can spend $50, it's 20 days.\n\nSo, the answer is 20 days.\n\nAlternatively, you can think of it as the total number of $50 increments in $1000, which is exactly 20.\n\nTherefore, after 20 days, you will have spent all $1000.\n\nSo, the final answer is 20 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
