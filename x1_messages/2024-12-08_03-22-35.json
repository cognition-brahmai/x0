        "content": "So, the question is: A tree produces 15 oranges every year. How many oranges does it produce in a decade? And I need to show my work.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a decade is. I know that a decade is 10 years. So, if the tree produces 15 oranges every year, and I want to find out how many it produces in 10 years, I should multiply the number of oranges per year by the number of years in a decade.\n\nSo, that's 15 oranges/year times 10 years.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nOranges in a decade = 15 oranges/year \u00d7 10 years\n\nNow, when I multiply these, the 'years' unit will cancel out, leaving me with just oranges.\n\nOranges in a decade = 15 \u00d7 10 oranges\n\nNow, 15 multiplied by 10 is 150.\n\nSo, the tree produces 150 oranges in a decade.\n\nBut, to make sure I'm not missing anything, let's think about it differently. Suppose I list out the number of oranges produced each year for 10 years:\n\nYear 1: 15 oranges\n\nYear 2: 15 oranges\n\nYear 3: 15 oranges\n\nYear 4: 15 oranges\n\nYear 5: 15 oranges\n\nYear 6: 15 oranges\n\nYear 7: 15 oranges\n\nYear 8: 15 oranges\n\nYear 9: 15 oranges\n\nYear 10: 15 oranges\n\nNow, if I add all these up: 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15\n\nThat's adding 15 ten times, which should also give me 150.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign that I'm correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of multiplication as repeated addition. Multiplying 15 by 10 is the same as adding 15 to itself 10 times, which is exactly what I just did.\n\nSo, the final answer is 150 oranges in a decade.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
