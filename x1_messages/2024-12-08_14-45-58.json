        "content": "In the great cosmic zoo,\nWhere stars and planets frolic too,\nThere lived a star named Zippity Zong,\nWith a twinkle in his light and a song.\n\nZippity Zong was born in a cloud of gas,\nIn the Milky Way, where stars do pass,\nA protostar he started his days,\nWith a big BANG and a lot of blaze.\n\nHe grew and grew, like a cosmic balloon,\nFusing hydrogen, his fuel so soon,\nInto helium, with a cheerful grin,\nShining bright, in the vast cosmic kin.\n\nZippity Zong had friends galore,\nRed giants and white dwarfs, and even more,\nThey'd dance in the sky, in a ballet so fine,\nWith nebulae curtains and black holes divine.\n\nOne day, Zippity Zong felt a little blue,\nHis hydrogen fuel was running low, what to do?\nHe pondered and thought, with a cosmic frown,\n\"Is this the end of my stellar town?\"\n\nBut no! For stars like Zippity Zong,\nHave a plan, when their fuel is gone,\nThey expand, turn red, and get quite large,\nA red giant they become, with a heavenly charge.\n\nZippity Zong swelled up, so big and bright,\nHis planets gasped, in the cosmic night,\n\"Mamma mia!\" cried planet Pizza Pie,\n\"As I orbit wider, don't ask me why!\"\n\nThen, Zippity Zong shed his outer layers,\nLike a snake sheds its skin, in cosmic affairs,\nA planetary nebula, so beautiful and rare,\nA masterpiece of light, beyond compare.\n\nAt last, Zippity Zong's core did shine,\nA white dwarf, small but oh so fine,\nCooling down, through the eons long,\nA ember of his once mighty song.\n\nYet, in the universe, where time is vast,\nZippity Zong's story would never last,\nFor in the end, the universe expands,\nAnd stars like him, in darkness lands.\n\nBut for now, Zippity Zong rests in peace,\nA quiet star, in the cosmic release,\nHis story told, in the fabric of space,\nA testament to the universe's grace.\n\nSo remember Zippity Zong, the star so bright,\nWho danced in the sky, with all his might,\nFor in the cosmos, each star has a tale,\nA journey through time, in the grandest scale."
