Every plan should have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the output of one of the accessible functions given an input string that could be the user's question, one or more prior evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nTools at your disposal:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: A tool that enables users to conduct internet searches using the DuckDuckGo search engine. It does not directly provide answers but offers a list of sites that might contain the needed information.\nTextExtractor[input]: Retrieves all text from the supplied URL(s), where the input is one or more URLs, and generates a plaintext output containing the site's content.\nHyperlinkDetector[input]: Identifies hyperlinks within plaintext and returns a plaintext, newline-separated list of links.\nAIML[input]: An AI-driven language model adept at answering queries based on a provided text passage. The input should be a textual question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable, such as What is the dog's breed, given :evidence1:?\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [initial action based on the input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [subsequent action, based on the outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, potentially referring to prior evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the ultimate answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who wrote the book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and what other books did they write?"
