He had invested heavily in a typesetting machine called the Paige Compositor, which was supposed to be more efficient than existing machines but ended up being too expensive and impractical. This investment, along with others, led to his financial troubles. However, Twain managed to recover from bankruptcy through a combination of writing, lecturing, and business acumen."
