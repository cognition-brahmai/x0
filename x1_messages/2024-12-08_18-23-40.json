        "content": "So there are 120 students in grade 9 and 150 students in grade 10. That means, altogether, there are 120 plus 150 students. Let me calculate that: 120 plus 150 is 270 students in total across both grades.\n\nNow, 60% of grade 9 students passed the exam, and 80% of grade 10 students passed. I need to find out how many students from each grade passed and then add those numbers together to get the total number of students who passed.\n\nFirst, for grade 9: there are 120 students, and 60% of them passed. To find 60% of 120, I can multiply 120 by 0.60. Let me do that: 120 times 0.60 is 72. So, 72 students from grade 9 passed the exam.\n\nNext, for grade 10: there are 150 students, and 80% of them passed. To find 80% of 150, I can multiply 150 by 0.80. Let's calculate that: 150 times 0.80 is 120. So, 120 students from grade 10 passed the exam.\n\nNow, to find the total number of students who passed, I need to add the number of students who passed from both grades: 72 plus 120. Let's add those up: 72 plus 120 is 192.\n\nTherefore, 192 students in total passed the exam.\n\nBut wait, just to be sure, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 60% of 120: 120 times 0.60 is indeed 72.\n\nSecond, 80% of 150: 150 times 0.80 is indeed 120.\n\nAdding 72 and 120 gives 192.\n\nSo, yes, 192 students passed the exam in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{192} \\]"
