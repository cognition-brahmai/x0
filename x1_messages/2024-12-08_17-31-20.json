Particularly useful for obtaining knowledge about people, places, events, etc. The input should be a search string helping locate the right page.\nQAEngine[input]: A tool able to answer questions based on common sense, general world knowledge, or given input context containing the answer.\nFactChecker[input]: A tool designed to verify facts by cross-referencing multiple sources. \n\nRemember to limit yourself to one evidence output per plan step.\n\nYour output should follow this format:\nPlan: [initial action based on input question]\n#Evidence1 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [subsequent action, based on outcome of #Evidence1]\n#Evidence2 = [next function to call with input parameter, potentially referring back to prior evidence, e.g., \"Given context #Evidence1\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: #EvidenceN (where N represents the final piece of evidence)\n\nQuestion: What was Albert Einstein's contribution to quantum theory and how has it been verified?"
