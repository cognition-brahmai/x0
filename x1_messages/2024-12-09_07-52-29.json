        "content": "Certainly! I'd be happy to help you develop a simple command-line calculator in C++ that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We'll create a program that takes two numbers and an operator as input and then displays the result of the operation.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Input Handling**: \n   - Read two numbers from the user.\n   - Read the operator (+, -, *, /) from the user.\n\n2. **Operation Based on Operator**:\n   - Use conditional statements (if-else) to determine which operation to perform based on the operator provided.\n\n3. **Perform Calculation**:\n   - For addition (+), add the two numbers.\n   - For subtraction (-), subtract the second number from the first.\n   - For multiplication (*), multiply the two numbers.\n   - For division (/), divide the first number by the second, handling the case where the second number is zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n\n4. **Display the Result**:\n   - Output the result of the operation.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    double num1, num2;\n    char operator_;\n\n    // Input: Two numbers and the operator\n    cout << \"Enter first number: \";\n    cin >> num1;\n    cout << \"Enter second number: \";\n    cin >> num2;\n    cout << \"Enter operator (+, -, *, /): \";\n    cin >> operator_;\n\n    // Perform the operation based on the operator\n    switch (operator_) {\n        case '+':\n            cout << \"Result: \" << num1 + num2 << endl;\n            break;\n        case '-':\n            cout << \"Result: \" << num1 - num2 << endl;\n            break;\n        case '*':\n            cout << \"Result: \" << num1 * num2 << endl;\n            break;\n        case '/':\n            if (num2 != 0) {\n                cout << \"Result: \" << num1 / num2 << endl;\n            } else {\n                cout << \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\" << endl;\n            }\n            break;\n        default:\n            cout << \"Error: Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.\" << endl;\n            break;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Input Handling**:\n   - We use `cin` to read the two numbers and the operator from the user.\n\n2. **Operation Based on Operator**:\n   - A `switch` statement is used to handle different operators.\n   - For addition, subtraction, and multiplication, the operations are straightforward.\n   - For division, we check if the second number is zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n\n3. **Display the Result**:\n   - The result is printed using `cout`. If there is an error (invalid operator or division by zero), an appropriate error message is displayed.\n\nThis simple calculator handles basic arithmetic operations and includes error checking for invalid operators and division by zero, making it robust and user-friendly."
