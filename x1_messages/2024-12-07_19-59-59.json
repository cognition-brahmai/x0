Carol finishes after Bob.\n\nSo, we need to determine the order in which they finish: who is first, second, and third.\n\nLet me try to arrange their finishing order based on the given information.\n\nFirst, since Alice finishes before Bob, Alice must be ahead of Bob in the order.\n\nSecond, Carol finishes after Bob, which means Bob finishes before Carol.\n\nSo, combining these two pieces of information:\n\n- Alice finishes before Bob.\n\n- Bob finishes before Carol.\n\nTherefore, the order should be Alice first, Bob second, and Carol third.\n\nWait a minute, is there any possibility of another arrangement?\n\nLet me think. If Alice finishes before Bob, and Carol finishes after Bob, there doesn't seem to be any other way to arrange them.\n\nLet me consider their finishing times relatively.\n\n- Alice < Bob (Alice finishes before Bob)\n\n- Bob < Carol (Carol finishes after Bob)\n\nTherefore, Alice < Bob < Carol.\n\nSo, the sequence is Alice, Bob, Carol.\n\nHence, Alice finishes first, Bob finishes second, and Carol finishes third.\n\nI think that's the only possible order based on the given information.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Alice finishes first, Bob finishes second, and Carol finishes third.}} \\]"
