        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a store selling apples and oranges, and we need to figure out how many pounds of each a customer bought based on the total weight and the total cost.\n\nFirst, let's lay out what we know:\n\n- Apples cost $1.50 per pound.\n\n- Oranges cost $2.00 per pound.\n\n- The customer bought a total of 10 pounds of fruit.\n\n- The customer spent a total of $18.00.\n\nWe need to find out how many pounds of apples and how many pounds of oranges were bought.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to set up a system of equations. We can let:\n\n- Let \\( a \\) represent the pounds of apples.\n\n- Let \\( o \\) represent the pounds of oranges.\n\nFrom the information given, we can create two equations.\n\nThe first equation will be based on the total weight of the fruit:\n\n\\[ a + o = 10 \\]\n\nThe second equation will be based on the total cost:\n\n\\[ 1.50a + 2.00o = 18 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( a + o = 10 \\)\n\n2. \\( 1.50a + 2.00o = 18 \\)\n\nI need to solve for \\( a \\) and \\( o \\).\n\nOne way to solve this system is by using the substitution method. I can solve the first equation for one variable and substitute it into the second equation.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ a = 10 - o \\]\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( a \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 1.50(10 - o) + 2.00o = 18 \\]\n\nNow, let's simplify and solve for \\( o \\):\n\n\\[ 1.50 \\times 10 - 1.50o + 2.00o = 18 \\]\n\n\\[ 15 - 1.50o + 2.00o = 18 \\]\n\n\\[ 15 + 0.50o = 18 \\]\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.50o = 3 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.50:\n\n\\[ o = 6 \\]\n\nSo, the customer bought 6 pounds of oranges.\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ a = 10 - 6 \\]\n\n\\[ a = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 4 pounds of apples and 6 pounds of oranges.\n\nTo double-check, let's verify these amounts with the total cost:\n\n\\[ 1.50 \\times 4 + 2.00 \\times 6 = 6 + 12 = 18 \\]\n\nYes, that matches the total amount spent. So, the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe customer bought 4 pounds of apples and 6 pounds of oranges."
