        "content": "So I have this problem here: if it takes 5 workers 3 days to complete a job, how long would it take for 10 workers to complete the same job? Hmm, this seems like a problem about work and rates. I think I've seen similar problems before, but I need to make sure I approach it correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a job that 5 workers can complete in 3 days. Now, if we double the number of workers to 10, how does that affect the time required to complete the same job? Intuitively, it makes sense that if you have more workers, the job should get done faster. So, probably the time will decrease.\n\nBut I need to find out exactly how much faster. Is it half the time? Let me think about that. If 5 workers take 3 days, then 10 workers might take half the time, which would be 1.5 days. Does that make sense?\n\nWait a minute, let me try to think about this more methodically. Maybe I should consider the total amount of work required and how that relates to the number of workers and the time they work.\n\nI've heard that work is equal to the number of workers multiplied by the time they work. So, work (W) = number of workers (N) multiplied by time (T). So, W = N * T.\n\nIn this case, the work is the same in both scenarios because it's the same job. So, W is constant.\n\nSo, for the first scenario: W = 5 workers * 3 days = 15 worker-days.\n\nNow, for the second scenario with 10 workers, we have W = 10 workers * T days.\n\nSince W is the same in both cases, I can set them equal to each other:\n\n5 * 3 = 10 * T\n\n15 = 10T\n\nNow, solving for T: T = 15 / 10 = 1.5 days.\n\nOkay, so that matches my initial intuition. But let me double-check if this is the right way to approach it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of work rates. Each worker has a certain work rate, say R work per day. So, the total work done by 5 workers in 3 days would be 5R * 3 = 15R.\n\nSimilarly, for 10 workers, the total work would be 10R * T = 10R T.\n\nAgain, since the total work is the same, 15R = 10R T.\n\nDividing both sides by R (assuming R is not zero), we get 15 = 10T, which again gives T = 1.5 days.\n\nAlright, so both methods give me the same answer. That makes me more confident.\n\nBut let me consider another angle. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of problem. I recall something about inverse proportionality. If you increase the number of workers, the time decreases inversely. So, time is inversely proportional to the number of workers.\n\nMathematically, T \u221d 1/N, which means T = k/N, where k is a constant.\n\nFrom the first scenario, T = 3 days when N = 5, so k = T * N = 3 * 5 = 15.\n\nNow, for N = 10, T = k/N = 15/10 = 1.5 days.\n\nAgain, the same result. It seems consistent across different methods.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for. Are there any constraints or dependencies that might affect this relationship? For example, maybe beyond a certain number of workers, additional workers don't help because they get in each other's way. But in this problem, it doesn't specify any such constraints, so I think assuming linear relationships is fair.\n\nAnother way to think about it is in terms of the total amount of work. If 5 workers take 3 days, then the job requires 15 worker-days of work. So, regardless of how many workers you have, the total worker-days needed remains the same.\n\nSo, if you have 10 workers, you can complete the 15 worker-days of work in T days, where 10 * T = 15, thus T = 1.5 days.\n\nThis aligns with all the previous methods.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another example. Suppose 1 worker would take how many days to complete the job? Using the same logic, 1 worker would take W / R = 15R / R = 15 days.\n\nSimilarly, if you had 15 workers, T = 15 / 15 = 1 day.\n\nThat makes sense: more workers mean less time, inversely proportional.\n\nSo, in conclusion, 10 workers would take 1.5 days to complete the job.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.5} \\]"
