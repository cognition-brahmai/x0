        "content": "So, the train usually travels at 60 miles per hour, and it takes 2 hours to go from station A to station B. Now, when it goes back from B to A, its speed is increased by 20%. I need to find out how long it will take to go back.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out the distance between station A and station B. Since speed is 60 miles per hour and time is 2 hours, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, distance from A to B is 60 miles/hour \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nNow, on the way back from B to A, the speed is increased by 20%. So, the new speed is:\n\nIncreased speed = Original speed + (20% of Original speed)\n\nThat is, Increased speed = 60 miles/hour + (0.20 \u00d7 60 miles/hour) = 60 + 12 = 72 miles/hour.\n\nNow, I need to find out the time it takes to travel back 120 miles at 72 miles per hour.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, Time = 120 miles / 72 miles per hour.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n120 divided by 72 is... hmm, 72 goes into 120 one time, with 48 left over. Then, 72 goes into 480 six times (since 72 \u00d7 6 = 432), leaving 480 - 432 = 48 again. So, it's 1.666... hours.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should simplify it differently.\n\nAlternatively, 120 divided by 72 is the same as 120/72, which can be reduced by dividing numerator and denominator by 12: 120 \u00f7 12 = 10, and 72 \u00f7 12 = 6, so it's 10/6, which is 1 and 4/6, which simplifies to 1 and 2/3 hours.\n\nSo, 1 and 2/3 hours is the same as 1 hour and 40 minutes, because 2/3 of 60 minutes is 40 minutes.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n2/3 \u00d7 60 = 40 minutes.\n\nSo, total time is 1 hour and 40 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert 1.666... hours directly to minutes: 1 hour is 60 minutes, and 0.666... hours is 0.666... \u00d7 60 \u2248 40 minutes. So, again, 1 hour and 40 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, for more precision, since 0.666... is exactly 2/3, and 2/3 of 60 is exactly 40 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the train will take 1 hour and 40 minutes to travel back from station B to station A at the increased speed of 72 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 \\text{ hour and } 40 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
