        "content": "So the factory makes 250 widgets each day, and it works every day of the year, which is 365 days. To find out how many widgets it makes in a year, I need to multiply the daily production by the number of days in a year.\n\nSo, that's 250 widgets per day times 365 days.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\nFirst, 250 times 300 is 75,000.\n\nThen, 250 times 65 is, let's see, 250 times 60 is 15,000, and 250 times 5 is 1,250. So, 15,000 plus 1,250 is 16,250.\n\nNow, add that to the 75,000: 75,000 plus 16,250 is 91,250.\n\nSo, the factory produces 91,250 widgets in a year.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me check my calculations again.\n\n250 times 300 is indeed 75,000.\n\n250 times 65: 250 times 60 is 15,000, and 250 times 5 is 1,250, which adds up to 16,250.\n\nAdding 75,000 and 16,250 gives 91,250.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as 250 times 365.\n\nI know that 250 is a quarter of 1,000, so 1,000 times 365 is 365,000.\n\nThen, a quarter of that would be 365,000 divided by 4, which is 91,250.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the factory produces 91,250 widgets in a year.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let me consider if there are any other factors that might affect this.\n\nThe question assumes the factory operates 365 days a year, so no days off for maintenance or holidays.\n\nAlso, it doesn't mention any variations in daily production.\n\nSo, based on the information given, 91,250 widgets per year is the answer.\n\nI think that's straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{91250} \\]"
