        "content": "Sure, I can help you set up a Node.js Express server with endpoints for uploading and downloading files. We'll use the `express` framework along with the `multer` middleware for handling file uploads. For downloading files, we'll serve them from a specified directory.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, create a new directory for your project and initialize it with `npm init`.\n\n### Step 1: Install Required Packages\n\nYou'll need to install `express` and `multer`. You can do this using npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install express multer\n```\n\n### Step 2: Set Up the Server\n\nCreate a file named `server.js` and set up the basic structure of your Express server.\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst multer = require('multer');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\n// Directory where uploaded files will be stored\nconst uploadDir = 'uploads';\nif (!fs.existsSync(uploadDir)) {\n  fs.mkdirSync(uploadDir);\n}\n\n// Multer storage configuration\nconst storage = multer.diskStorage({\n  destination: function (req, file, cb) {\n    cb(null, uploadDir);\n  },\n  filename: function (req, file, cb) {\n    cb(null, Date.now() + path.extname(file.originalname)); // Adds timestamp to filenames\n  }\n});\n\nconst upload = multer({ storage: storage });\n\n// Endpoint for uploading files\napp.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {\n  if (!req.file) {\n    return res.status(400).send('No file uploaded.');\n  }\n  res.send('File uploaded successfully.');\n});\n\n// Endpoint for downloading files\napp.get('/download/:filename', (req, res) => {\n  const filename = req.params.filename;\n  const filepath = path.join(uploadDir, filename);\n  if (fs.existsSync(filepath)) {\n    res.download(filepath, filename, err => {\n      if (err) {\n        res.status(500).send('Error downloading file.');\n      }\n    });\n  } else {\n    res.status(404).send('File not found.');\n  }\n});\n\n// Start the server\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Setting Up Express and Multer:**\n   - We import the required modules: `express`, `multer`, and `path`.\n   - Create an Express app and define the port to listen on.\n\n2. **Upload Directory:**\n   - Specify a directory (`uploads`) where uploaded files will be stored.\n   - Ensure the directory exists; if not, create it.\n\n3. **Multer Configuration:**\n   - Configure Multer to store uploaded files in the specified directory with a unique filename based on timestamps to avoid conflicts.\n\n4. **Upload Endpoint:**\n   - Define a POST endpoint `/upload` that uses Multer to handle file uploads.\n   - If no file is uploaded, return a 400 Bad Request error.\n   - If the file is uploaded successfully, send a success message.\n\n5. **Download Endpoint:**\n   - Define a GET endpoint `/download/:filename` to download files.\n   - Construct the file path using the provided filename.\n   - Check if the file exists; if it does, use `res.download` to allow the user to download it.\n   - If the file doesn't exist, return a 404 Not Found error.\n\n6. **Starting the Server:**\n   - Start the server and log a message indicating it's running.\n\n### Step 3: Run the Server\n\nIn your terminal, navigate to your project directory and run:\n\n```bash\nnode server.js\n```\n\nYour server should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n### Testing the Endpoints\n\n- **Upload a File:**\n  - Use a tool like Postman or cURL to send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/upload` with a file attached under the key `'file'`.\n\n- **Download a File:**\n  - Once a file is uploaded, you can download it by visiting `http://localhost:3000/download/<filename>` in your browser or using a GET request from a tool like Postman or cURL.\n\nThat's it! You've set up a basic Node.js Express server with file upload and download capabilities. You can expand this further by adding more features like file listing, delete functionality, or handling multiple file uploads."
