        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the factory normally produces 1,200 units every day. Because of an upcoming holiday, they need to produce 15% more units for 10 days. We need to find out how many additional units they need to produce during this period.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what 15% more units means. If they normally produce 1,200 units a day, 15% more would be the additional units they need to produce on top of the normal amount each day.\n\nSo, to find 15% of 1,200, I can calculate it as follows:\n\n15% of 1,200 = (15/100) * 1,200\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n15 divided by 100 is 0.15.\n\n0.15 multiplied by 1,200 is 180.\n\nSo, they need to produce an additional 180 units each day for 10 days.\n\nNow, to find the total additional units for the 10 days, I need to multiply the daily additional units by the number of days.\n\nAdditional units per day: 180\n\nNumber of days: 10\n\nTotal additional units = 180 * 10 = 1,800 units.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe I can calculate the total production required for the 10 days with the increased production and then subtract the normal production for the same period to find the additional units.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the increased daily production:\n\nNormal production: 1,200 units\n\nIncreased production per day: 1,200 + 180 = 1,380 units\n\nNow, for 10 days, the total production with the increase would be:\n\n1,380 units/day * 10 days = 13,800 units\n\nNormally, without the increase, they would produce:\n\n1,200 units/day * 10 days = 12,000 units\n\nSo, the additional units needed are:\n\n13,800 - 12,000 = 1,800 units\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the additional units they need to produce during this period are 1,800 units.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there any possibility that the 15% increase is applied differently, maybe on the total production over 10 days instead of daily?\n\nLet me explore that.\n\nIf the 15% increase is applied to the total production over 10 days:\n\nNormal total production for 10 days: 1,200 units/day * 10 days = 12,000 units\n\n15% of 12,000 units: (15/100) * 12,000 = 0.15 * 12,000 = 1,800 units\n\nSo, again, the additional units required are 1,800 units.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, whether the increase is applied daily or over the total production, the additional units needed are the same.\n\nTherefore, the factory needs to produce an additional 1,800 units during the 10-day period.\n\nI think that's the answer. But to make sure, let me consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem.\n\nIs there any chance that the 15% increase is compounded daily or something like that? Hmm, unlikely, as the problem says \"produce 15% more units for 10 days,\" which suggests a straightforward increase in daily production.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"additional units,\" so it's clear that we need to find how many extra units they need to produce beyond their normal production level.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the factory needs to produce an additional 1,800 units over the 10-day period due to the holiday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1800} \\]"
