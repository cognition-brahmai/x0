        "content": "I'd be happy to help you with that! The producer-consumer problem is a classic synchronization problem in computer science, and using condition variables and mutex locks in C++ is a great way to handle it in a multi-threaded environment.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to develop this program:\n\n1. **Define the Shared Resource:** We need a buffer to store the numbers produced by the producers. This buffer should be protected by a mutex to ensure that only one thread can access it at a time.\n\n2. **Producers:** Multiple producer threads will generate random numbers and add them to the buffer. They should wait if the buffer is full.\n\n3. **Consumers:** Multiple consumer threads will remove numbers from the buffer and calculate the running average. They should wait if the buffer is empty.\n\n4. **Condition Variables:** We'll use condition variables to signal between producers and consumers when the buffer state changes (from full to not full, or from empty to not empty).\n\n5. **Termination:** We need a way to signal that all production is done, and consumers should exit after processing all items.\n\nLet's start by including the necessary headers and defining some constants.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <thread>\n#include <mutex>\n#include <condition_variable>\n#include <queue>\n#include <random>\n\nconst int BUFFER_SIZE = 10;\nconst int NUM_PRODUCERS = 3;\nconst int NUM_CONSUMERS = 2;\nconst int TOTAL_NUMBERS = 20;\n```\n\nNext, we'll define the shared buffer and the associated mutex and condition variables.\n\n```cpp\nstd::queue<int> buffer;\nstd::mutex mtx;\nstd::condition_variable cv_producer, cv_consumer;\nbool production_done = false;\n```\n\nNow, let's define the producer function. Each producer will generate a random number and add it to the buffer. If the buffer is full, it will wait until there is space.\n\n```cpp\nstd::default_random_engine generator;\nstd::uniform_int_distribution<int> distribution(1, 100);\n\nvoid producer(int id) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < TOTAL_NUMBERS / NUM_PRODUCERS; ++i) {\n        int number = distribution(generator);\n        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);\n        cv_producer.wait(lock, []{ return buffer.size() < BUFFER_SIZE; });\n        buffer.push(number);\n        std::cout << \"Producer \" << id << \" added \" << number << \", buffer size: \" << buffer.size() << std::endl;\n        lock.unlock();\n        cv_consumer.notify_one();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNext, the consumer function. Each consumer will remove a number from the buffer and calculate the running average. If the buffer is empty, it will wait until there are items to consume.\n\n```cpp\ndouble sum = 0.0;\nint count = 0;\n\nvoid consumer(int id) {\n    while (true) {\n        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);\n        cv_consumer.wait(lock, [&]{ return !buffer.empty() || production_done; });\n        if (buffer.empty() && production_done) {\n            break;\n        }\n        int number = buffer.front();\n        buffer.pop();\n        sum += number;\n        ++count;\n        double average = sum / count;\n        std::cout << \"Consumer \" << id << \" consumed \" << number << \", running average: \" << average << std::endl;\n        lock.unlock();\n        cv_producer.notify_one();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, the main function to set up the producers and consumers.\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    std::vector<std::thread> producers;\n    std::vector<std::thread> consumers;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_PRODUCERS; ++i) {\n        producers.emplace_back(producer, i);\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_CONSUMERS; ++i) {\n        consumers.emplace_back(consumer, i);\n    }\n\n    for (auto& producer : producers) {\n        producer.join();\n    }\n\n    {\n        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);\n        production_done = true;\n        lock.unlock();\n        cv_consumer.notify_all();\n    }\n\n    for (auto& consumer : consumers) {\n        consumer.join();\n    }\n\n    std::cout << \"All producers and consumers have finished.\" << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Shared Resources:**\n   - `buffer`: A queue to hold the produced numbers.\n   - `mtx`: A mutex to protect access to the buffer.\n   - `cv_producer` and `cv_consumer`: Condition variables to signal between producers and consumers.\n   - `production_done`: A flag to indicate that all production is completed.\n\n2. **Producers:**\n   - Generate random numbers and add them to the buffer.\n   - Wait if the buffer is full.\n   - Notify consumers when a number is added.\n\n3. **Consumers:**\n   - Remove numbers from the buffer and calculate the running average.\n   - Wait if the buffer is empty.\n   - Check the `production_done` flag to exit if no more production is happening and the buffer is empty.\n   - Notify producers when a number is consumed.\n\n4. **Main Function:**\n   - Creates and starts the producer and consumer threads.\n   - Waits for all producers to finish.\n   - Sets the `production_done` flag and notifies all consumers.\n   - Waits for all consumers to finish.\n\nThis setup ensures that producers and consumers synchronize correctly using condition variables and mutexes, preventing race conditions and deadlocks."
