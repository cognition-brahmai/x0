        "content": "Certainly! Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular method for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, especially when dealing with weighted edges. Below is a Python program that implements Dijkstra's algorithm for an undirected, weighted graph.\n\nFirst, we need to represent the graph. For this example, we'll use an adjacency list where each node maps to a list of its neighboring nodes and their corresponding edge weights.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: We'll use a dictionary where keys are nodes, and values are lists of tuples, each containing a neighboring node and the weight of the edge connecting them.\n\n2. **Priority Queue**: We'll use a priority queue (min-heap) to always select the node with the smallest known distance to process next.\n\n3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:\n   - Initialize distances to all nodes as infinite, except for the start node, which is set to zero.\n   - Use a priority queue to keep track of nodes to visit, starting with the start node.\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue the node with the smallest distance, and update the distances of its neighbors if a shorter path is found.\n\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: Keep track of the previous node for each node to reconstruct the path once the end node is reached.\n\nHere's the complete Python code:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef dijkstra(graph, start, end):\n    # Priority queue to hold nodes to visit: (distance, node)\n    queue = []\n    heapq.heapify(queue)\n    \n    # Dictionary to hold the shortest known distance to each node\n    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}\n    distances[start] = 0\n    \n    # Dictionary to hold the previous node in the shortest path\n    previous_nodes = {node: None for node in graph}\n    \n    # Add the start node to the queue\n    heapq.heappush(queue, (0, start))\n    \n    while queue:\n        # Get the node with the smallest distance\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)\n        \n        # Nodes can only be added to the queue once due to the distances update logic\n        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node]:\n            distance = current_distance + weight\n            \n            # Only consider this new path if it's better\n            if distance < distances[neighbor]:\n                distances[neighbor] = distance\n                previous_nodes[neighbor] = current_node\n                heapq.heappush(queue, (distance, neighbor))\n    \n    # Reconstruct the path\n    path = []\n    current = end\n    while current is not None:\n        path.append(current)\n        current = previous_nodes[current]\n    # Reverse the path to get from start to end\n    path = path[::-1]\n    \n    return path, distances[end]\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Example graph represented as an adjacency list\n    graph = {\n        'A': [('B', 1), ('C', 4)],\n        'B': [('A', 1), ('C', 2), ('D', 5)],\n        'C': [('A', 4), ('B', 2), ('D', 1)],\n        'D': [('B', 5), ('C', 1)]\n    }\n    \n    start_node = 'A'\n    end_node = 'D'\n    \n    path, distance = dijkstra(graph, start_node, end_node)\n    \n    print(f\"Shortest path from {start_node} to {end_node}: {path}\")\n    print(f\"Distance: {distance}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is defined as a dictionary where each key is a node, and the value is a list of tuples containing neighboring nodes and edge weights.\n\n2. **Priority Queue**: We use a heap queue to efficiently get the node with the smallest distance.\n\n3. **Distance Tracking**: We maintain a dictionary to keep track of the shortest known distance to each node from the start node.\n\n4. **Previous Nodes**: Another dictionary keeps track of the previous node in the shortest path to any node, which is used to reconstruct the path once the end node is reached.\n\n5. **Algorithm Execution**: The algorithm processes nodes in order of their distance from the start, updating distances to neighboring nodes if a shorter path is found.\n\n6. **Path Reconstruction**: After the algorithm completes, we backtrack from the end node to the start node using the `previous_nodes` dictionary to get the shortest path.\n\nThis implementation should work for any undirected, weighted graph represented in the specified format."
