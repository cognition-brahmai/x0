        "content": "So Tom scores 6 points in 2 minutes, and I need to find out how many points he would score in an hour if he keeps up that same rate. Okay, first things first, I need to understand the rate at which Tom is scoring points.\n\nHe scores 6 points in 2 minutes. So, to find out his scoring rate per minute, I can divide the points by the time in minutes. That would be:\n\n6 points / 2 minutes = 3 points per minute\n\nSo, Tom scores 3 points every minute.\n\nNow, there are 60 minutes in an hour. If he keeps scoring at 3 points per minute, then in an hour, he would score:\n\n3 points/minute * 60 minutes = 180 points\n\nWait a second, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could find out how many 2-minute intervals there are in an hour, since the original rate is given for 2 minutes.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so the number of 2-minute intervals in an hour is:\n\n60 minutes / 2 minutes = 30 intervals\n\nSince he scores 6 points in each 2-minute interval, over 30 intervals, he would score:\n\n6 points/interval * 30 intervals = 180 points\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, it looks like 180 points is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there anything else I need to consider here? The problem says he keeps scoring at the same rate, so I don't think there's any need to account for resting periods or anything like that.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. I converted everything to minutes and points, which seems appropriate.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use proportions. If 2 minutes correspond to 6 points, then 60 minutes would correspond to x points.\n\nSo, setting up a proportion:\n\n2 minutes / 6 points = 60 minutes / x points\n\nThen, solving for x:\n\nx = (6 points * 60 minutes) / 2 minutes = (360) / 2 = 180 points\n\nAgain, the same answer. It seems consistent across different methods.\n\nI think I'm confident with this result. Tom would score 180 points in an hour if he keeps up the same scoring rate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]"
