        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. John reads 30 pages per hour and takes a 15-minute break every hour. He starts reading a 300-page book at 8 AM and we need to find out when he'll finish it.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how much time he spends per hour, including his break. He reads for 1 hour and then takes a 15-minute break. So, each cycle consists of:\n\n- Reading time: 1 hour\n\n- Break time: 15 minutes\n\nTotal time per cycle: 1 hour + 15 minutes = 75 minutes\n\nNow, in each cycle, he reads 30 pages. So, his reading rate is 30 pages every 75 minutes.\n\nThe book has 300 pages. To find out how many cycles he needs to complete the book, we divide the total pages by the pages per cycle:\n\nNumber of cycles = 300 pages / 30 pages per cycle = 10 cycles\n\nNow, each cycle takes 75 minutes. So, total time required is:\n\nTotal time = 10 cycles * 75 minutes per cycle = 750 minutes\n\nTo convert minutes into hours and minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n\n750 minutes \u00f7 60 = 12 hours and 30 minutes\n\nNow, he starts at 8 AM. Adding 12 hours and 30 minutes to 8 AM:\n\n8 AM + 12 hours = 8 PM\n\n8 PM + 30 minutes = 8:30 PM\n\nSo, according to this calculation, he would finish at 8:30 PM.\n\nWait a minute, but let's think about this again. In the last cycle, does he really need to take a break? Because after the last cycle, he's finished reading, so he wouldn't need to take another break.\n\nLet's adjust the calculation to account for this.\n\nIn the first 9 cycles, he reads 270 pages (9 cycles * 30 pages), and in the 10th cycle, he reads the remaining 30 pages.\n\nFor the first 9 cycles:\n\nTime per cycle: 75 minutes\n\nTotal time for 9 cycles: 9 * 75 = 675 minutes\n\nFor the 10th cycle:\n\nHe reads the last 30 pages in 1 hour (60 minutes), and since he's finished reading, he doesn't need to take the 15-minute break.\n\nSo, total time for the 10th cycle: 60 minutes\n\nNow, total time required:\n\nTime for first 9 cycles: 675 minutes\n\nTime for the 10th cycle: 60 minutes\n\nTotal time: 675 + 60 = 735 minutes\n\nConvert 735 minutes to hours and minutes:\n\n735 \u00f7 60 = 12 hours and 15 minutes\n\nAdding this to the start time of 8 AM:\n\n8 AM + 12 hours = 8 PM\n\n8 PM + 15 minutes = 8:15 PM\n\nSo, with this adjustment, he would finish at 8:15 PM.\n\nBut, let's consider another aspect. Does he take a break after the first hour of reading, or does he read for an hour, take a break, and then repeat?\n\nActually, the way it's worded: \"takes a break every hour for 15 minutes.\" This suggests that after every hour of reading, he takes a 15-minute break.\n\nSo, in the first hour, he reads 30 pages, then takes a 15-minute break. Then reads another hour, another break, and so on.\n\nSo, for 10 cycles of reading 30 pages each, that's 10 hours of reading, and 9 breaks of 15 minutes each (since after the last reading period, he doesn't need another break).\n\nLet's calculate it this way:\n\nTotal reading time: 10 hours\n\nTotal break time: 9 breaks * 15 minutes = 135 minutes = 2 hours and 15 minutes\n\nTotal time required: 10 hours + 2 hours 15 minutes = 12 hours 15 minutes\n\nAdding this to the start time of 8 AM:\n\n8 AM + 12 hours = 8 PM\n\n8 PM + 15 minutes = 8:15 PM\n\nThis matches the previous adjusted calculation.\n\nSo, the correct finishing time is 8:15 PM.\n\nWait, but in the initial straightforward calculation, I got 8:30 PM, and then after adjusting for the last cycle not having a break, it became 8:15 PM. Now, with this third approach, it's also 8:15 PM.\n\nTherefore, the initial adjustment and this third approach both lead to 8:15 PM, while the first straightforward approach gave 8:30 PM.\n\nI think the correct answer is 8:15 PM, as the last reading period is not followed by a break.\n\nSo, John will finish reading the 300-page book at 8:15 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8:15 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
