Each step in your plan should have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string, which could be the user's question, prior evidence values, or both.\n\nAvailable tools:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: Allows users to search for information using the DuckDuckGo search engine. It finds a list of sites that might contain the answer to the user's question.\nPlainTextExtractor[input]: Extracts plain text from a webpage given its URL. \nLinkPicker[input]: Picks up links from plain text and provides a list of newline-separated links.\nAIQA[input]: An AI-based question-answering model. Particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [First action based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action based on the result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to call and input parameter, possibly referring to previous evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: Containing the final answer]\n\nQuestion: What is the tallest building in New York City and when was it completed?"
