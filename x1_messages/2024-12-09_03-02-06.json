        "content": "So there are 6 cats in the room, and each cat has 4 legs. To find out the total number of legs, I need to multiply the number of cats by the number of legs each cat has. So, that would be 6 cats times 4 legs per cat. Let me do the math: 6 times 4 is 24. So, there are 24 legs in total in the room.\n\nBut wait a minute, is there anything else I should consider? Are there any other creatures in the room that might have legs? The question mentions only cats, so probably not. It's straightforward: 6 cats, each with 4 legs, total of 24 legs.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should think about it differently. If I count the legs one by one, starting with the first cat: 1,2,3,4. Then the second cat: 5,6,7,8. Continue this for all six cats: 9,10,11,12; 13,14,15,16; 17,18,19,20; 21,22,23,24. Yep, still 24 legs.\n\nAlternatively, I could add 4 legs six times: 4+4+4+4+4+4=24. Same result.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. 24 legs in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
