        "content": "I'm here to help you with your question about animation filmmaking. So, you're asking which stage involves deciding how characters will move and interact. Let's look at the options you provided:\n\nA. Rendering\n\nB. Storyboarding\n\nC. Modelling\n\nD. Texturing\n\nE. Both A and C\n\nFirst, let's briefly understand what each of these terms generally refers to in the animation process.\n\nA. Rendering: This is the final step where the animated scenes are processed into completed frames or images. It's like taking the finished animation and turning it into a viewable format.\n\nB. Storyboarding: This is where the sequence of events in the story is laid out visually. It's like creating a comic strip of the movie, showing the key scenes and camera angles.\n\nC. Modelling: This involves creating the 3D models of characters, props, and environments. It's like building the characters and world in digital form.\n\nD. Texturing: This is applying colors, patterns, and other surface details to the 3D models to make them look more realistic or stylized.\n\nNow, considering these definitions, which one involves deciding how characters will move and interact?\n\nWell, storyboarding does show the sequence of events and perhaps some basic character actions, but it's more about the overall story structure and less about detailed movements.\n\nModelling is about creating the shapes and forms of characters, but not necessarily how they move.\n\nRendering is the final step, turning the animation into images, but again, not about deciding movements.\n\nTexturing is about surface details, not movements.\n\nSo, none of these directly mention the decision-making process for character movements and interactions.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's a stage missing from your list, like \"animation\" or \"rigging.\" In traditional 3D animation pipelines, after modelling, characters need to be rigged, which means setting up a skeleton or controls that allow animators to pose and move the character.\n\nThen, in the animation stage, animators decide how characters move and interact based on the storyboard and direction from the directors.\n\nBut since \"animation\" isn't listed here, maybe the closest option is storyboarding, where basic movements and interactions are planned out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps modelling involves some decision-making about how characters will move, especially if it's about designing their flexibility and range of motion.\n\nBut I think the most accurate answer, given the options, is B. Storyboarding, because that's where the visual storytelling and character actions are first laid out.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that in practice, deciding how characters move and interact is a collaborative process that happens throughout the animation production, from storyboarding to animation itself.\n\nBut based on the options provided, I would go with B. Storyboarding.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
