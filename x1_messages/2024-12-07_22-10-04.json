        "content": "So, the store sells 3 pairs of socks for $5, and I need to figure out how much it would cost to buy enough socks for a soccer team with 11 players. Assuming each player needs one pair of socks, I need to buy 11 pairs of socks.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many sets of 3 pairs I can get in 11 pairs. So, I divide 11 by 3, which gives me 3 sets of 3 pairs, with 2 pairs left over because 3 times 3 is 9, and 11 minus 9 is 2.\n\nEach set of 3 pairs costs $5, so for 3 sets, that would be 3 times $5, which is $15. Now, I have 2 pairs left to buy. Since the store sells them in sets of 3 for $5, I might need to buy another set of 3 pairs to get those 2 pairs, which means I'd be paying for 3 pairs but only needing 2.\n\nBut that doesn't seem efficient. Maybe I should see if the store sells individual pairs. If they do, then I can buy the remaining 2 pairs at the individual price. However, the information given only mentions that they sell 3 pairs for $5, so I might have to assume that individual pairs are not sold separately, and I have to buy another set of 3 pairs.\n\nSo, in that case, I would need to buy 4 sets of 3 pairs, which is 12 pairs in total, and that would cost 4 times $5, which is $20. But I only need 11 pairs, so I would have 1 extra pair.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the store offers a discount for buying multiple sets. But since that information isn't provided, I can't assume any discount.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find the cost per pair and then multiply by 11. If 3 pairs cost $5, then one pair costs $5 divided by 3, which is approximately $1.666..., or $1.67 per pair.\n\nSo, 11 pairs at $1.67 each would be approximately $18.37.\n\nBut since the store sells them in sets of 3 for $5, and possibly doesn't sell individually, I might need to stick with buying sets.\n\nLet me check which option is cheaper. Buying 4 sets of 3 pairs for $20 gives me 12 pairs, which is more than enough, but it costs $20.\n\nIf I could buy 3 sets for $15 and get 9 pairs, and then buy another set of 3 for $5 to get the remaining 2 pairs, that would be $20 again, still.\n\nAlternatively, if I could buy 3 sets and then buy individual pairs, but since the store doesn't sell individually, I can't do that.\n\nSo, it seems like I have to buy 4 sets of 3 pairs for $20 to get at least 11 pairs.\n\nBut waiting, maybe there's another way. Perhaps the store has a bulk pricing for larger quantities. But again, since that information isn't provided, I can't assume that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can buy 3 sets of 3 pairs for $15 and then find another way to get the remaining 2 pairs, perhaps from another store or somehow.\n\nBut the question is focused on buying from this particular store, so I might need to stick with buying 4 sets for $20.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can negotiate with the store to sell me 11 pairs at a pro-rated price.\n\nBut again, since that's not specified, I can't assume that's an option.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most straightforward approach is to buy 4 sets of 3 pairs for $20.\n\nTherefore, the cost to buy enough socks for a soccer team with 11 players is $20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
