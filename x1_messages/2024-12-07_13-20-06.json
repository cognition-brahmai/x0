        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 friends, and each orders either a burger or a salad. We need to find out the minimum number of burgers ordered, given that there are more burgers than salads.\n\nSo, first, I need to understand what \"more burgers than salads\" means. It means that the number of burgers is greater than the number of salads.\n\nLet me denote the number of burgers as B and the number of salads as S. Since there are 5 people in total, B + S = 5.\n\nAnd since there are more burgers than salads, B > S.\n\nI need to find the smallest possible value of B that satisfies both B + S = 5 and B > S.\n\nLet me try to list out all possible combinations of B and S that add up to 5:\n\n- B = 0, S = 5\n\n- B = 1, S = 4\n\n- B = 2, S = 3\n\n- B = 3, S = 2\n\n- B = 4, S = 1\n\n- B = 5, S = 0\n\nNow, out of these, which ones have B > S?\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- B = 0, S = 5: 0 > 5? No.\n\n- B = 1, S = 4: 1 > 4? No.\n\n- B = 2, S = 3: 2 > 3? No.\n\n- B = 3, S = 2: 3 > 2? Yes.\n\n- B = 4, S = 1: 4 > 1? Yes.\n\n- B = 5, S = 0: 5 > 0? Yes.\n\nSo, the combinations where there are more burgers than salads are:\n\n- B = 3, S = 2\n\n- B = 4, S = 1\n\n- B = 5, S = 0\n\nAmong these, the smallest value of B is 3.\n\nWait a minute, is there a way to confirm this without listing all possibilities?\n\nLet's think about it differently. Since B + S = 5 and B > S, I can substitute S with 5 - B.\n\nSo, B > 5 - B\n\nAdding B to both sides: 2B > 5\n\nDividing both sides by 2: B > 2.5\n\nSince B has to be an integer (you can't order half a burger), the smallest integer greater than 2.5 is 3.\n\nSo, B must be at least 3.\n\nThat matches what I found earlier by listing the possibilities.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this?\n\nMaybe using inequalities.\n\nWe have B > S and B + S = 5.\n\nSo, B > 5 - B\n\n2B > 5\n\nB > 2.5\n\nAgain, B has to be an integer, so B \u2265 3.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if B = 3, then S = 2, and 3 > 2, which satisfies the condition.\n\nIf B = 2, then S = 3, and 2 < 3, which does not satisfy B > S.\n\nTherefore, B cannot be 2.\n\nHence, the minimum number of burgers ordered is 3.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
