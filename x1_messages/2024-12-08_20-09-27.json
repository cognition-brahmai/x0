        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I have 50 coins made up of nickels and dimes, and their total value is $3.75. I need to figure out how many of each coin there are. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that nickels are worth 5 cents each and dimes are worth 10 cents each. The total number of coins is 50, and their combined value is $3.75, which is 375 cents. So, I need to find out how many nickels and how many dimes make up these 50 coins and 375 cents.\n\nMaybe I can set up some equations here. Let's say:\n\n- Let n be the number of nickels.\n\n- Let d be the number of dimes.\n\nFrom the problem, I know that:\n\n1. The total number of coins is 50, so n + d = 50.\n\n2. The total value of the coins is 375 cents, so 5n + 10d = 375.\n\nOkay, so I have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\nn + d = 50\n\n5n + 10d = 375\n\nI need to solve for n and d.\n\nOne way to solve this is by substitution. I can solve the first equation for one variable and substitute it into the second equation.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for n:\n\nn = 50 - d\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation:\n\n5(50 - d) + 10d = 375\n\nOkay, let's simplify that:\n\n250 - 5d + 10d = 375\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n250 + 5d = 375\n\nNow, subtract 250 from both sides:\n\n5d = 125\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nd = 25\n\nSo, there are 25 dimes.\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation for n:\n\nn = 50 - 25 = 25\n\nSo, there are 25 nickels and 25 dimes.\n\nBut wait, let me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf I have 25 nickels at 5 cents each, that's 25 * 5 = 125 cents.\n\nAnd 25 dimes at 10 cents each is 25 * 10 = 250 cents.\n\nAdding those together: 125 + 250 = 375 cents, which matches the total value.\n\nAlso, 25 + 25 = 50 coins, which matches the total number of coins.\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used elimination to solve the system of equations.\n\nLet's see:\n\nI have:\n\nn + d = 50\n\n5n + 10d = 375\n\nI can multiply the first equation by 5 to make the coefficients of n the same:\n\n5n + 5d = 250\n\nNow, subtract this from the second equation:\n\n(5n + 10d) - (5n + 5d) = 375 - 250\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n5d = 125\n\nSo, d = 25, just like before.\n\nThen, n = 50 - 25 = 25.\n\nSame result.\n\nAnother way could be to think about it in terms of the difference in value.\n\nSuppose all 50 coins are nickels. That would be 50 * 5 = 250 cents.\n\nBut the actual total is 375 cents, which is 375 - 250 = 125 cents more.\n\nEach time I replace a nickel with a dime, I gain 5 cents (since a dime is worth 10 cents and a nickel is 5, so the difference is 5 cents).\n\nSo, to make up the 125 cents difference, I need to replace 125 / 5 = 25 nickels with dimes.\n\nTherefore, there are 25 dimes and 25 nickels.\n\nThat's another way to think about it, and it confirms the same answer.\n\nI could also consider the average value of the coins.\n\nThe total value is 375 cents for 50 coins, so the average value per coin is 375 / 50 = 7.5 cents.\n\nSince nickels are 5 cents and dimes are 10 cents, the average of 7.5 cents suggests that the number of nickels and dimes are equal, because 7.5 is the midpoint between 5 and 10.\n\nGiven that, it makes sense that there are equal numbers of nickels and dimes, which is 25 each.\n\nThis is consistent with the previous methods.\n\nSo, all these different approaches lead to the same conclusion: there are 25 nickels and 25 dimes.\n\nIt's good to see that multiple methods confirm the same answer, which increases confidence in the solution.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there could be other solutions.\n\nSuppose I try n = 26 nickels and d = 24 dimes.\n\nThen, the total number of coins is 26 + 24 = 50, which is correct.\n\nThe total value would be 26 * 5 + 24 * 10 = 130 + 240 = 370 cents, which is less than 375 cents.\n\nSimilarly, if I try n = 24 nickels and d = 26 dimes.\n\nTotal coins: 24 + 26 = 50.\n\nTotal value: 24 * 5 + 26 * 10 = 120 + 260 = 380 cents, which is more than 375.\n\nSo, only n = 25 and d = 25 gives the exact total value of 375 cents.\n\nTherefore, there are no other integer solutions that satisfy both the number of coins and the total value.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 25 nickels and 25 dimes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25 \\text{ nickels and } 25 \\text{ dimes}} \\]"
