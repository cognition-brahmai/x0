        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a person who drinks an average of 3 cups of water per day. We want to find out how many gallons of water they consume in one year. Okay, first things first, we need to know how many days there are in a year. The problem says to assume there are 365 days in a year. Got it.\n\nSo, if they drink 3 cups per day, for 365 days, that would be 3 cups times 365 days. Let me calculate that:\n\n3 cups/day \u00d7 365 days = 1095 cups per year.\n\nAlright, now we need to convert cups to gallons. The problem states that there are 16 cups in a gallon. So, to find out how many gallons that is, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per gallon:\n\n1095 cups \u00f7 16 cups/gallon.\n\nLet me do that division:\n\n1095 \u00f7 16 = 68.4375 gallons.\n\nSo, that's approximately 68.44 gallons per year.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should round it differently. The problem didn't specify how to round, so maybe I should keep it as is. Or perhaps the exact fraction would be better.\n\nLet me see, 1095 divided by 16 is exactly 68.4375. Maybe I should present it as a fraction. 68 and 7/16 gallons, since 0.4375 is equal to 7/16.\n\nBut I think decimals are fine, as long as it's clear. Maybe I should include the decimal form and perhaps mention the fraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use a certain conversion factor or to consider leap years, but the problem specifies to assume 365 days, so I'll stick with that.\n\nIs there any other aspect to consider here? Like, is there a standard cup size or anything? Probably not, since the problem provides the conversion to gallons directly.\n\nSo, my final answer is that the person consumes 68.44 gallons of water in one year.\n\nWait, but actually, 1095 divided by 16 is exactly 68.4375, and if we round to two decimal places, it's 68.44. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by finding out how many gallons per day and then multiplying by the number of days.\n\nSo, 3 cups per day divided by 16 cups per gallon is 3/16 gallons per day.\n\nThen, 3/16 gallons/day \u00d7 365 days = (3/16) \u00d7 365.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 3 times 365 is 1095.\n\nThen, 1095 divided by 16 is 68.4375 gallons.\n\nSame as before. So, that reinforces that my initial calculation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the number of gallons per week or per month, but since the problem is asking for a yearly consumption, daily and yearly calculations seem most straightforward.\n\nIs there any possibility that the number of cups per gallon is different? Well, in the US, there are 16 US customary cups in a US liquid gallon. But since the problem provides the conversion, we should use that.\n\nIn some other systems, like the imperial system, the number of cups per gallon might be different, but again, the problem gives us the conversion to use.\n\nSo, I think 68.44 gallons is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but to be precise, maybe I should include the units throughout the calculation.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nTotal cups per year: 3 cups/day \u00d7 365 days/year = 1095 cups/year.\n\nThen, convert cups to gallons: 1095 cups \u00d7 (1 gallon / 16 cups) = 1095/16 gallons = 68.4375 gallons.\n\nYes, that's better. Including units helps to see that the units cancel out appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the annual consumption in gallons directly:\n\nAnnual consumption = (daily consumption) \u00d7 (days per year) / (cups per gallon)\n\nSo, Annual consumption = 3 cups/day \u00d7 365 days/year \u00f7 16 cups/gallon = 68.4375 gallons/year.\n\nSame result.\n\nI think it's clear now. The person consumes approximately 68.44 gallons of water in one year.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any leap years or variations in day length, but the problem specifies to assume exactly 365 days, so no need to complicate it further.\n\nAlso, perhaps considering significant figures, but since the given values are 3 cups (1 significant figure) and 365 days (3 significant figures), and 16 cups per gallon (2 significant figures), the answer should probably be reported to 2 significant figures, which would be 68 gallons.\n\nBut 3 cups has only one significant figure, so maybe the answer should be 70 gallons. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"average of 3 cups\", which might imply more precision. Maybe it's 3.0 cups, which would be 2 significant figures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should just keep the decimal as is, since the calculation gives 68.4375, and round it appropriately.\n\nIf I round 68.4375 to two decimal places, it's 68.44 gallons.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider significant figures, 3 cups/day has one significant figure, so the answer should be reported with one significant figure: 70 gallons.\n\nBut 365 has three, and 16 has two, so maybe the limiting factor is the 3 cups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 16 cups per gallon is exact, so it doesn't limit the significant figures.\n\nThis could get a bit tricky, but perhaps for practical purposes, reporting the answer as 68.44 gallons is fine.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem provides numbers with what seem to be precise values, maybe reporting the answer with decimals is acceptable.\n\nIn any case, the main calculation is correct: 1095 cups per year divided by 16 cups per gallon equals 68.4375 gallons per year.\n\nSo, my final answer is approximately 68.44 gallons per year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{68.44} \\]"
