        "content": "Let's tackle this expression step by step. The expression given is (4^2 - 1) * (3 + 2)^2. Okay, so first things first, I need to remember the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\nFirst parenthesis: (4^2 - 1)\n\nSecond parenthesis: (3 + 2)^2\n\nI need to evaluate what's inside each set of parentheses before doing anything else.\n\nLet's look at the first one: (4^2 - 1)\n\nI know that exponents come before subtraction, so I'll calculate 4^2 first.\n\n4^2 means 4 multiplied by itself, which is 16.\n\nSo, 16 - 1 equals 15.\n\nGreat, so the first part simplifies to 15.\n\nNow, the second parenthesis: (3 + 2)^2\n\nHere, addition inside the parentheses comes before the exponent.\n\n3 + 2 equals 5.\n\nThen, 5 squared is 5 * 5, which is 25.\n\nSo, the second part simplifies to 25.\n\nNow, the expression is simplified to 15 * 25.\n\nNow, I just need to multiply these two numbers together.\n\n15 * 25.\n\nWell, 15 * 10 is 150, and 15 * 15 is 225, but since it's 15 * 25, let me do it properly.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 25 as 100/4, so 15 * 100 is 1500, and 1500 divided by 4 is 375.\n\nOr, I can use regular multiplication:\n\n   15\n\n* 25\n\n------\n\n   75   (15 * 5)\n\n  30    (15 * 2, shifted one position to the left, so it's 300)\n\n------\n\n  375\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the final answer is 375.\n\nWait a minute, just to double-check, let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother approach could be to expand the expressions before multiplying.\n\nSo, (4^2 - 1) is 16 - 1 = 15, and (3 + 2)^2 is 5^2 = 25, and 15 * 25 = 375.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to look for a different method, perhaps I could consider the difference of squares or some other algebraic identities, but in this case, it's straightforward arithmetic.\n\nI don't think there's any simplification or shortcut here beyond just calculating it step by step.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 375 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{375} \\]"
