        "content": "I'm trying to think of a country where people eat a lot of potatoes but not much rice. Hmm, maybe somewhere in Europe where potatoes are a staple food. Like Ireland, for example. I know that Ireland is famous for potatoes, but I'm not sure about their rice consumption. Maybe I should look that up.\n\nWait, I remember that in Ireland, potatoes have a long history, especially since the Irish potato famine. So, they probably consume a significant amount of potatoes. As for rice, I don't recall it being a major part of their diet. But I should check some statistics to be sure.\n\nLet me see, maybe I can look up per capita consumption of potatoes and rice in different countries. That should give me a clear idea. I think the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) provides such data. I'll try to find the latest available data.\n\nOkay, according to the FAO data, Ireland does have a high consumption of potatoes. In fact, per capita potato consumption in Ireland is one of the highest in Europe. As for rice, it seems that rice consumption in Ireland is relatively low compared to other European countries.\n\nSo, Ireland might be a good example. Another country that comes to mind is Belarus. I've heard that potatoes are a staple food there as well. Let me check the consumption statistics for Belarus.\n\nYes, Belarus also has high potato consumption. In fact, some Eastern European countries are known for their potato dishes. But again, I need to check their rice consumption to see if it's low.\n\nAccording to the data, rice consumption in Belarus is indeed lower compared to potato consumption. So, Belarus could also be a possible answer.\n\nBut let's think outside of Europe as well. Maybe there are countries in South America or Asia where potatoes are consumed heavily but rice is not a major part of the diet.\n\nIn South America, Peru comes to mind because potatoes originated there. However, Peru also has a significant rice consumption, especially in coastal regions where rice is a staple along with potatoes.\n\nAnother country could be Russia. Russians are known for their love of potatoes; dishes like \"borshch\" and \"vareniki\" often include potatoes. As for rice, while it's not entirely absent, it's not as central to the Russian diet as potatoes.\n\nLet me verify the consumption statistics for Russia. Yes, potato consumption in Russia is quite high, and rice consumption is relatively lower.\n\nSo, between Ireland, Belarus, and Russia, all seem to fit the description of consuming a lot of potatoes but little rice. Maybe I should consider which one has the highest potato consumption relative to rice.\n\nLooking at the data, it seems that Belarus has one of the highest potato consumption rates in the world, with a per capita consumption well above that of rice.\n\nTherefore, Belarus might be the best example of a country where people consume a lot of potatoes but very little rice.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another angle. Maybe there are countries where potatoes are a major part of the diet due to geographical or historical reasons, and rice isn't as prevalent.\n\nFor instance, in some African countries, potatoes have been introduced and are now part of the diet, but rice consumption might vary.\n\nHowever, in many African countries, rice is actually a major staple, especially in West and Central Africa. So, it might be harder to find a country in Africa where potatoes are consumed a lot but rice is not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some countries in Oceania or the Pacific Islands have higher potato consumption and lower rice consumption, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nLet me consider the United States. Americans consume a lot of potatoes, especially in the form of french fries and potato chips. But they also consume a significant amount of rice, especially in certain regions like the South and among ethnic minorities.\n\nSo, the US might not fit the criteria of consuming very little rice.\n\nWhat about Poland? Poles are known for their love of potatoes; dishes like \"pierogi\" often include potatoes. As for rice, it's not as central to the Polish diet compared to potatoes.\n\nChecking the consumption data, potato consumption in Poland is higher than rice consumption, so it could be another example.\n\nHowever, Belarus still seems to have a more pronounced difference in consumption levels between potatoes and rice.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the cuisines of these countries to get a better understanding.\n\nIn Belarusian cuisine, potatoes are indeed a staple and are used in a variety of dishes, such as draniki (pancakes made from grated potatoes), potato soup, and many side dishes. Rice is not traditionally a major component of Belarusian cuisine, although it has become more common in recent times.\n\nIn contrast, in countries like India or China, rice is a primary staple, and potato consumption, while significant, is secondary.\n\nTherefore, Belarus seems to fit the description of a country where people consume a lot of potatoes but very little rice.\n\nTo summarize, based on consumption data and culinary traditions, Belarus is a country where potatoes are heavily consumed, and rice plays a minor role in the diet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Belarus}} \\]"
