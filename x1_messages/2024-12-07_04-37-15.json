Then, I put back 3 apples. So, I'm adding 3 apples back to the table. So, 7 plus 3 is 10 apples on the table now. But the question is, how many apples do I have? Hmm, does it mean how many apples I took with me or how many I have in total?\n\nWait a minute, when I took away 5 apples, that means I have those 5 apples with me. Then I put back 3 of them, which means I gave back 3 apples to the table. So, I had 5 apples, then I put back 3, so I have 5 minus 3, which is 2 apples left with me.\n\nBut let's double-check. Initially, there were 12 apples on the table. I took away 5, so now I have 5 apples, and the table has 7. Then I put back 3 apples, so I give those 3 back to the table. So, the table now has 7 plus 3, which is 10 apples, and I have 5 minus 3, which is 2 apples.\n\nSo, the question is, how many apples do I have? I think it should be 2 apples.\n\nBut wait, maybe the question is about how many apples are on the table. Let's see. It says, \"how many apples do you have?\" So, it's probably asking about the apples I have with me, not on the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a trick question. Maybe it's asking about the total number of apples, which would still be 12, because apples haven't been added or removed, just moved around.\n\nLet me think differently. There are 12 apples on the table. I took away 5, so I have 5 apples, and the table has 7. Then I put back 3, so I give those 3 back to the table, so now the table has 10 apples, and I have 2 apples. So, in total, there are still 12 apples (10 on the table and 2 with me).\n\nBut the question is, how many apples do I have? So, I should have 2 apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is ambiguous, and it depends on whether \"you\" refers to me or someone else. But in this context, it seems \"you\" is the person taking and putting back apples.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 2 apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
