But it's not about how hard you get hit; it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done.\n\nNow, I've been where you are. Full of dreams, full of fire. But the road to the top is tough. It's filled with setbacks and failures. Remember, every champion was once a contender who refused to give up.\n\nYou see, it's not about being the best right now. It's about being better than you were yesterday. Each day, push yourself a little harder. Run that extra mile, lift that extra weight. Because when the going gets tough, and it will, your training will be your shield.\n\nDon't be afraid to make mistakes. In fact, embrace them. Because every mistake is a lesson, and every lesson makes you stronger. So, when you fall down, and you will, make sure you get back up stronger than before.\n\nAnd let me tell you something about pain. Pain is temporary. It may last a minute, or an hour, or a day, but eventually, it will subside. It's your courage that must last a lifetime.\n\nNow, I know some of you are looking at me, thinking, \"Rocky Balboa, the Italian Stallion.\" Yeah, I had my moments in the sun. But before that, I was just a kid from Philadelphia with big dreams. I worked for it, every single day. I sacrificed, I persevered, and I never gave up.\n\nSo, to all of you out there, don't let anyone tell you that you can't do it. Don't listen to the naysayers. Believe in yourself, even when no one else does. Because deep down, you know what you're capable of.\n\nAnd remember, it's not about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done.\n\nSo, go out there, give it your all, and never, ever quit. Because the world belongs to those who never give up.\n\nThat's all I got. Now, go out there and show 'em what you're made of.\n\n**Rocky Balboa**"
