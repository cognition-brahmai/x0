        "content": "Let's see. The car rental company has 200 cars in total. Out of these, 60% are compact cars, 25% are sedans, and the remaining are SUVs. I need to find out how many SUVs there are.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many compact cars there are. Since 60% of the cars are compact, I can calculate that by taking 60% of 200.\n\nSo, 60% of 200 is (60/100) * 200 = 0.6 * 200 = 120 cars.\n\nNext, I'll find out how many sedans there are. 25% of the cars are sedans, so that's (25/100) * 200 = 0.25 * 200 = 50 cars.\n\nNow, to find the number of SUVs, I need to subtract the number of compact cars and sedans from the total number of cars.\n\nSo, SUVs = Total cars - Compact cars - Sedans = 200 - 120 - 50 = 30 cars.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to check this?\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the percentage of SUVs first. Since compact cars are 60% and sedans are 25%, the remaining percentage must be SUVs.\n\nSo, SUV percentage = 100% - 60% - 25% = 15%.\n\nThen, the number of SUVs would be 15% of 200, which is (15/100) * 200 = 0.15 * 200 = 30 cars.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. So, the company has 30 SUVs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
