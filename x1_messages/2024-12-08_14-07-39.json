        "content": "So the factory makes 150 units every day and works for 20 days each month. Each unit is sold for $25. I need to find out the monthly revenue.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many units are produced in a month. Since they produce 150 units per day and work 20 days a month, I can multiply those two numbers to get the total monthly production.\n\nSo, 150 units/day times 20 days/month equals 3,000 units per month.\n\nNext, each unit is sold for $25, so to find the total revenue, I need to multiply the number of units produced in a month by the price per unit.\n\nThat would be 3,000 units times $25 per unit.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 3,000 times 25.\n\nWell, 3 times 25 is 75, and since there are three zeros in 3,000, that makes 75 followed by three zeros, which is 75,000.\n\nSo, the monthly revenue should be $75,000.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 150 units per day and 20 days per month:\n\n150 \u00d7 20 = 3,000 units per month. That seems correct.\n\nThen, each unit is sold for $25:\n\n3,000 \u00d7 25 = 75,000.\n\nYes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of it as 3,000 units times 25 dollars per unit.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that for each unit sold, the factory gets $25, so for 3,000 units, it would be 3,000 times 25.\n\nI can also break it down further if I'm still unsure.\n\nLet's see, 150 units per day at $25 each would generate daily revenue of 150 \u00d7 25.\n\n150 \u00d7 25: 100 \u00d7 25 is 2,500, and 50 \u00d7 25 is 1,250. So, 2,500 + 1,250 equals 3,750.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 150 \u00d7 25.\n\nActually, 100 \u00d7 25 is 2,500, and 50 \u00d7 25 is 1,250, so yes, 2,500 + 1,250 is 3,750.\n\nSo, daily revenue is $3,750.\n\nNow, over 20 days, the monthly revenue would be 3,750 \u00d7 20.\n\n3,750 \u00d7 20: well, 3,750 times 10 is 37,500, so times 20 would be 75,000.\n\nAgain, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that in a month, producing 3,000 units at $25 each, it's indeed 3,000 \u00d7 25 = 75,000.\n\nSo, the monthly revenue is $75,000.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75000} \\]"
