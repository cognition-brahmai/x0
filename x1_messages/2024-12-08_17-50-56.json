The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, then f'(x) = n * x^{n-1}.\n\nLet's break it down term by term:\n\n1. For the first term, x^3:\n\n   Applying the power rule: n = 3, so f'(x) = 3 * x^{3-1} = 3x^2.\n\n2. For the second term, -2x^2:\n\n   First, note that the coefficient is -2. The power rule applies to the variable part, x^2.\n\n   So, n = 2, and the derivative is: -2 * 2 * x^{2-1} = -4x.\n\n3. For the third term, 4x:\n\n   Here, n = 1 (since x = x^1).\n\n   Applying the power rule: 4 * 1 * x^{1-1} = 4 * 1 * x^0 = 4 * 1 * 1 = 4.\n\n   (Recall that x^0 = 1).\n\n4. For the constant term, -7:\n\n   The derivative of a constant is zero.\n\nNow, combine the derivatives of all terms:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 4.\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x - 7 is f'(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3x^2 - 4x + 4} \\]"
