        "content": "So if the plane is flying at an average speed of 550 mph against a headwind of 50 mph, we need to find out its ground speed. Ground speed is the speed of the aircraft relative to the ground, taking into account the effect of the wind.\n\nFirst, let's understand the terms involved:\n\n- **Airspeed**: This is the speed of the aircraft relative to the air mass it's flying through. In this case, the average airspeed is 550 mph.\n\n- **Headwind**: This is the wind blowing in the opposite direction to the aircraft's motion. Here, it's 50 mph.\n\n- **Ground speed**: This is the speed of the aircraft relative to the ground.\n\nWhen flying against a headwind, the aircraft's ground speed is less than its airspeed because the headwind slows it down. To find the ground speed, we subtract the headwind speed from the airspeed.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\nGround speed = Airspeed - Headwind speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nGround speed = 550 mph - 50 mph = 500 mph\n\nTherefore, the plane's ground speed is 500 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500 \\text{ mph}} \\]"
