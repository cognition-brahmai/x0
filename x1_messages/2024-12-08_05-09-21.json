        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that cranks out widgets at a rate of 200 per hour. But every 6 hours, it has to stop for maintenance for 2 hours. We need to find out how many widgets are produced in a full 24-hour period.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the production cycle. The factory works for 6 hours, then stops for 2 hours for maintenance, and this cycle repeats.\n\nSo, one complete cycle is 6 hours of production plus 2 hours of maintenance, which totals 8 hours.\n\nNow, in a 24-hour period, how many such cycles are there?\n\n24 hours divided by 8 hours per cycle equals 3 cycles.\n\nAlright, so there are 3 complete cycles in 24 hours.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the production per cycle.\n\nThe factory produces 200 widgets per hour for 6 hours, so that's 200 * 6 = 1200 widgets per cycle.\n\nSince there are 3 cycles in 24 hours, the total production would be 1200 * 3 = 3600 widgets.\n\nWait a minute, but let's make sure there's no overlapping or extra time.\n\nEach cycle is 8 hours, and 3 cycles would cover 24 hours exactly. So, no extra time.\n\nTherefore, the total production is 3600 widgets in 24 hours.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total production time in 24 hours.\n\nFirst, find out how much time is spent on production and how much on maintenance in 24 hours.\n\nWe have 3 cycles, each with 6 hours of production and 2 hours of maintenance.\n\nSo, total production time is 3 * 6 = 18 hours.\n\nTotal maintenance time is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.\n\nNow, production is 200 widgets per hour, so in 18 hours, it's 200 * 18 = 3600 widgets.\n\nSame as before, so that checks out.\n\nWait, but is there any possibility that the factory could squeeze in extra production time?\n\nLet's see, in a 24-hour period, with cycles of 8 hours each, totaling 24 hours exactly, there's no extra time.\n\nHowever, perhaps we should consider if the last cycle finishes early or something, but in this case, it's exactly 3 cycles fitting into 24 hours.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maintenance overlap affects production, but according to the problem, maintenance happens after every 6 hours of production, lasting 2 hours, and then the cycle repeats.\n\nSo, no, the calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the factory can produce 3600 widgets in a 24-hour period.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3600} \\]"
