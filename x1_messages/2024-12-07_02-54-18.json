        "content": "Let's break this down. So, the cyclist is riding at two different speeds for different durations. First, they ride at 12 miles per hour for 2 hours, and then they speed up to 18 miles per hour for the next 3 hours. To find the total distance covered, I need to calculate the distance for each part of the trip and then add them together.\n\nOkay, so for the first part, at 12 miles per hour for 2 hours, the distance is speed multiplied by time. That would be 12 miles per hour times 2 hours, which equals 24 miles.\n\nThen, for the second part, at 18 miles per hour for 3 hours, again, distance is speed times time. So, 18 miles per hour times 3 hours equals 54 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just add those two distances together: 24 miles plus 54 miles equals 78 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe by calculating the average speed or something like that? But, since the speeds are different for different times, I think the best way is just to calculate each part separately and add them up.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. First part: 12 miles per hour times 2 hours is indeed 24 miles. Second part: 18 miles per hour times 3 hours is 54 miles. Adding them up gives 78 miles. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to calculate the average speed over the entire trip, I could maybe find the total distance that way. The total time is 2 hours plus 3 hours, which is 5 hours. The total distance is 78 miles, so the average speed would be 78 miles divided by 5 hours, which is 15.6 miles per hour. But since the speeds were different for different periods, this average makes sense because it's between 12 and 18 miles per hour.\n\nBut the question is asking for the total distance, not the average speed, so my initial approach is sufficient.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider, like rest stops or changes in speed? The problem says the cyclist rides at a constant speed for each segment, so I don't think so.\n\nTherefore, the total distance covered by the cyclist is 78 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{78} \\]"
