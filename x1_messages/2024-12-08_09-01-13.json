        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have bags of apples containing either 5 or 7 apples each, and we want to find the largest number of apples that can't be bought exactly using any combination of these bags.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to buy a combination of these bags. If I buy one bag of 5 and one bag of 7, I get 12 apples. If I buy two bags of 5, that's 10 apples, and so on. So, essentially, any total number of apples that can be bought is a sum of multiples of 5 and 7.\n\nMathematically, this sounds like finding linear combinations of 5 and 7. Specifically, amounts that can be expressed as 5x + 7y, where x and y are non-negative integers representing the number of bags of 5 and 7, respectively.\n\nNow, I need to find the largest number that cannot be expressed in this form. I recall that there's a formula for the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of two relatively prime integers a and b, which is ab - a - b. This is known as the Chicken McNugget theorem or the Frobenius coin problem.\n\nIn this case, a = 5 and b = 7. Are 5 and 7 relatively prime? Well, their greatest common divisor is 1, so yes, they are relatively prime.\n\nSo, applying the formula: 5*7 - 5 - 7 = 35 - 5 - 7 = 23.\n\nWait a minute, is 23 the largest number that cannot be expressed as 5x + 7y? Let me check if 23 can indeed not be expressed in that form.\n\nLet's try to find non-negative integers x and y such that 5x + 7y = 23.\n\nIf y = 0, then 5x = 23, which is not possible since 23 is not divisible by 5.\n\nIf y = 1, then 5x + 7 = 23 \u21d2 5x = 16 \u21d2 x = 16/5, which is not an integer.\n\nIf y = 2, then 5x + 14 = 23 \u21d2 5x = 9 \u21d2 x = 9/5, not an integer.\n\nIf y = 3, then 5x + 21 = 23 \u21d2 5x = 2 \u21d2 x = 2/5, not an integer.\n\nSo, indeed, 23 cannot be expressed as 5x + 7y with x and y being non-negative integers.\n\nNow, to confirm that 23 is the largest such number, I should check that every number larger than 23 can be expressed in that form.\n\nLet's check a few numbers above 23.\n\n24: Can 5x + 7y = 24?\n\nTry y = 1: 5x + 7 = 24 \u21d2 5x = 17 \u21d2 x = 17/5, not integer.\n\ny = 2: 5x + 14 = 24 \u21d2 5x = 10 \u21d2 x = 2. So, 5*2 + 7*2 = 10 + 14 = 24. Good.\n\n25: 5*5 + 7*0 = 25.\n\n26: 5*1 + 7*3 = 5 + 21 = 26.\n\n27: 5*3 + 7*1 = 15 + 12 = 27.\n\nWait, 15 + 12 is 27, but 7*1 is 7, so 15 + 7 is 22, not 27. Wait, I think I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, 5*3 is 15, and 7*1 is 7, which sums to 22, not 27. So, that doesn't work.\n\nLet me try again.\n\ny = 0: 5x = 27 \u21d2 not possible.\n\ny = 1: 5x + 7 = 27 \u21d2 5x = 20 \u21d2 x = 4. So, 5*4 + 7*1 = 20 + 7 = 27. There we go.\n\n28: 7*4 = 28, so x = 0, y = 4.\n\n29: 5*3 + 7*2 = 15 + 14 = 29.\n\n30: 5*6 + 7*0 = 30.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, it seems that 23 is indeed the largest number that cannot be expressed as a combination of 5 and 7.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check if there's any number larger than 23 that cannot be expressed in that form.\n\nLet's check 31.\n\n31: Can 5x + 7y = 31?\n\ny = 0: 5x = 31 \u21d2 not integer.\n\ny = 1: 5x + 7 = 31 \u21d2 5x = 24 \u21d2 not integer.\n\ny = 2: 5x + 14 = 31 \u21d2 5x = 17 \u21d2 not integer.\n\ny = 3: 5x + 21 = 31 \u21d2 5x = 10 \u21d2 x = 2. So, 5*2 + 7*3 = 10 + 21 = 31. Good.\n\n32: 5*3 + 7*1 = 15 + 7 = 22. Wait, that's not 32.\n\nWait, maybe y = 2: 5x + 14 = 32 \u21d2 5x = 18 \u21d2 not integer.\n\ny = 3: 5x + 21 = 32 \u21d2 5x = 11 \u21d2 not integer.\n\ny = 4: 5x + 28 = 32 \u21d2 5x = 4 \u21d2 not integer.\n\nSo, 32 cannot be expressed as 5x + 7y.\n\nWait a minute, but according to the Chicken McNugget theorem, 23 should be the largest number that cannot be expressed in that form. But 32 seems to be larger and also cannot be expressed.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in my earlier checks.\n\nLet me re-examine the theorem. The Chicken McNugget theorem states that for two coprime integers a and b, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of a and b is ab - a - b.\n\nIn this case, a = 5, b = 7, so 35 - 5 - 7 = 23, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut according to my check, 32 cannot be expressed as 5x + 7y, which contradicts the theorem.\n\nLet me double-check my calculation for 32.\n\n5x + 7y = 32.\n\nLet's try y = 1: 5x + 7 = 32 \u21d2 5x = 25 \u21d2 x = 5. So, 5*5 + 7*1 = 25 + 7 = 32. There it is.\n\nAh, I must have made a mistake earlier. So, yes, 32 can be expressed as 5*5 + 7*1.\n\nLet me check another number, say 33.\n\n33: 5x + 7y = 33.\n\ny = 0: 5x = 33 \u21d2 not integer.\n\ny = 1: 5x + 7 = 33 \u21d2 5x = 26 \u21d2 not integer.\n\ny = 2: 5x + 14 = 33 \u21d2 5x = 19 \u21d2 not integer.\n\ny = 3: 5x + 21 = 33 \u21d2 5x = 12 \u21d2 not integer.\n\ny = 4: 5x + 28 = 33 \u21d2 5x = 5 \u21d2 x = 1. So, 5*1 + 7*4 = 5 + 28 = 33.\n\nGood.\n\nSo, it seems that indeed, 23 is the largest number that cannot be expressed as a combination of 5 and 7.\n\nTo further confirm, let's see if there are any numbers larger than 23 that cannot be expressed in that form.\n\nLet's check 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, and 34.\n\n24: 5*2 + 7*2 = 10 + 14 = 24.\n\n25: 5*5 + 7*0 = 25.\n\n26: 5*1 + 7*3 = 5 + 21 = 26.\n\n27: 5*4 + 7*1 = 20 + 7 = 27.\n\n28: 5*0 + 7*4 = 28.\n\n29: 5*3 + 7*2 = 15 + 14 = 29.\n\n30: 5*6 + 7*0 = 30.\n\n31: 5*5 + 7*1 = 25 + 6 = 31. Wait, 7*1 is 7, so 25 + 7 is 32, not 31. Wait, maybe I need to try different values.\n\ny = 0: 5x = 31 \u21d2 not integer.\n\ny = 1: 5x + 7 = 31 \u21d2 5x = 24 \u21d2 not integer.\n\ny = 2: 5x + 14 = 31 \u21d2 5x = 17 \u21d2 not integer.\n\ny = 3: 5x + 21 = 31 \u21d2 5x = 10 \u21d2 x = 2. So, 5*2 + 7*3 = 10 + 21 = 31.\n\nThere it is.\n\n32: As previously, 5*5 + 7*1 = 25 + 7 = 32.\n\n33: 5*1 + 7*4 = 5 + 28 = 33.\n\n34: 5*3 + 7*3 = 15 + 14 = 29. Wait, that's 29, not 34.\n\nWait, maybe y = 2: 5x + 14 = 34 \u21d2 5x = 20 \u21d2 x = 4. So, 5*4 + 7*2 = 20 + 14 = 34.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, all numbers from 24 up to 34 can be expressed as combinations of 5 and 7.\n\nGiven that, and according to the Chicken McNugget theorem, 23 should indeed be the largest number that cannot be expressed in that form.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's see if there's a general way to express any number greater than 23 as a combination of 5 and 7.\n\nSuppose we have a number n > 23.\n\nWe can try to express n as 5x + 7y.\n\nSince 5 and 7 are coprime, for any n >= 0, there exists integers x and y such that 5x + 7y = n, but we need non-negative integers.\n\nThe theorem guarantees that for n >= ab - a - b + 1 = 24, n can be expressed as 5x + 7y with x and y non-negative.\n\nBut in practice, as we've seen, some numbers below 24 can also be expressed in this way, but 23 is the first one that cannot.\n\nTherefore, the largest number of apples that cannot be bought exactly using a combination of bags of 5 and 7 is 23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{23} \\]"
