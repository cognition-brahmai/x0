        "content": "So, there's this group of friends who need to split the cost of a $300 hotel room evenly among themselves, and there are 6 people in the group. You want to know how much each person has to pay, right?\n\nWell, to find out how much each person has to pay when sharing a cost evenly, you basically need to divide the total cost by the number of people. So, in this case, it's $300 divided by 6 people.\n\nLet me just write that down to make sure I get it right:\n\nTotal cost: $300\n\nNumber of people: 6\n\nAmount per person: $300 \u00f7 6\n\nNow, I know that dividing 300 by 6 is pretty straightforward. Let's see:\n\n6 times what equals 300? Well, 6 times 50 is 300, because 6 times 5 is 30, and since it's 6 times 50, it's 300.\n\nSo, each person would have to pay $50.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If each of the 6 people pays $50, then the total would be 6 times 50, which is indeed 300. So, that checks out.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Well, sometimes there might be taxes or additional fees, but since the question doesn't mention anything beyond the $300 hotel room cost, I'll assume that's the total cost they need to split.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the hotel room cost is being split evenly, meaning each person pays the same amount. There might be situations where people pay different amounts, but based on the information given, it's an equal split.\n\nSo, to sum it up, each person has to pay $50.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if the hotel applies any discounts or if there are any special conditions, but again, the question doesn't provide that information. So, I'll stick with the given numbers.\n\nAnother thing to consider is if the hotel charges per person or per room. In this case, it's a $300 hotel room, so the total cost for the room is $300, and it's to be split among 6 people.\n\nLet me think about real-life scenarios. Sometimes hotels have different room rates based on the number of occupants, but since the total cost is already given as $300 for the room, I think it's safe to assume that's the final amount to be split.\n\nIs there a possibility of tax being added to the room rate? In many places, hotel rooms are subject to sales tax or hospitality tax. However, since the question specifies the hotel room is $300 and doesn't mention any taxes, I'll assume that $300 is the total cost before taxes, and the friends are splitting that cost.\n\nBut if there is tax, it would need to be added to the total cost before dividing it among the people. However, without specific information about taxes, I can't factor that in.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, each person pays $50.\n\nLet me put it another way. If you have a total bill of $300 and six people are sharing it equally, each person's share is $300 divided by 6, which is $50.\n\nAlternatively, you could think of it as each person contributing an equal part to reach the total of $300. So, if you multiply each person's contribution by the number of people, you should get the total cost:\n\n$50 x 6 = $300\n\nThat matches the total cost, so it seems correct.\n\nIs there any other angle to this? Maybe considering tip or gratuity, but again, the question doesn't mention anything about that. So, I won't include it.\n\nIn conclusion, each person has to pay $50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
