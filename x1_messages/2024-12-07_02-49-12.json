        "content": "So I have this problem: a book has 200 pages, and I read 25 pages per day. I need to find out how many days it will take to finish the book. Hmm, this seems like a division problem. I think I need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages I read each day.\n\nSo, total pages are 200, and I read 25 pages per day. So, 200 divided by 25 should give me the number of days. Let me do that calculation.\n\n200 \u00f7 25. Well, 25 times 8 is 200. So, 25 \u00d7 8 = 200. Therefore, it should take 8 days to finish the book.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If I read 25 pages each day for 8 days, that's 25 \u00d7 8 = 200 pages, which matches the total number of pages in the book. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using multiplication. If I let the number of days be D, then 25 pages per day times D days should equal 200 pages. So, 25D = 200. To find D, I can divide both sides by 25. So, D = 200 \u00f7 25, which again is 8.\n\nAlright, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. I think I've got it right.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this. For example, maybe some days I read more or less, but the problem says I read 25 pages per day, so I'm assuming it's a constant rate.\n\nAlso, the book has 200 pages, and I'm not skipping any pages, so no need to consider any deductions.\n\nSo, in conclusion, it will take 8 days to finish the book if I read 25 pages each day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
