        "content": "Let's see. So, there are houses on both sides of the street, 10 on one side and 15 on the other, making a total of 25 houses. Each house has one dog, so there are 25 dogs in total. Each dog barks at exactly two cats, and no cat is barked at by more than one dog. So, I need to find out how many cats there are in total.\n\nAlright, so if each dog barks at exactly two cats, and there are 25 dogs, then the total number of cat-dog relationships is 25 dogs times 2 cats per dog, which is 50. But since no cat is barked at by more than one dog, that means each cat is only barked at by one dog. So, the total number of cats should be equal to the total number of cat-dog relationships, which is 50.\n\nWait a minute, but that doesn't sound right. If each dog barks at two cats, and no cat is barked at by more than one dog, then yes, it should be 50 cats. But is there any possibility that cats are shared between dogs? Oh, but the problem says that there are no duplicate cat targets among the dogs, which I think means that no cat is barked at by more than one dog. So, each cat is unique to the dogs that bark at them.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then indeed, with 25 dogs each barking at 2 unique cats, there should be 50 unique cats in total.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem says \"no duplicate cat targets among the dogs,\" which could mean that no cat is barked at by more than one dog. So, each cat is barked at by at most one dog.\n\nGiven that, if each dog barks at exactly two cats, and no cat is barked at by more than one dog, then the total number of cats should be exactly twice the number of dogs, which is 50.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the phrase \"no duplicate cat targets among the dogs.\" Maybe it means that each dog has unique cats that no other dog barks at. But that seems similar to what I thought before.\n\nLet me try to rephrase it. If each dog barks at exactly two cats, and no two dogs bark at the same cat, then indeed, each cat is barked at by only one dog.\n\nSo, for each dog, there are two unique cats that only that dog barks at. Therefore, the total number of cats is simply 25 dogs times 2 cats per dog, which is 50 cats.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
