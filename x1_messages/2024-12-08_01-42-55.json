        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a triangle with side lengths of 7 inches, 10 inches, and 13 inches, and I need to find its area. Hmm, I don't know the height or anything, just the lengths of the three sides. I wonder what formula I can use for this.\n\nI remember there's something called Heron's formula that lets you find the area of a triangle when you know all three sides. Heron's formula looks like this: area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where a, b, and c are the side lengths, and s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the semi-perimeter, s. The semi-perimeter is half of the perimeter, so s = (a + b + c)/2. Plugging in the side lengths: s = (7 + 10 + 13)/2 = 30/2 = 15 inches.\n\nNow, plug s and the side lengths into Heron's formula: area = sqrt[15(15 - 7)(15 - 10)(15 - 13)] = sqrt[15 * 8 * 5 * 2].\n\nLet's calculate inside the square root: 15 * 8 = 120, then 120 * 5 = 600, and 600 * 2 = 1200. So, area = sqrt[1200].\n\nSimplify sqrt[1200]. I know that 1200 = 400 * 3, and sqrt[400] = 20, so area = 20 * sqrt[3]. Alternatively, I can leave it as sqrt[1200], but I think 20sqrt[3] is nicer.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to find the area without using Heron's formula? Maybe if I can find the height corresponding to one of the sides.\n\nLet's say I pick the base as 13 inches. If I can find the height to that base, then area = (1/2)*base*height.\n\nBut how do I find the height? I don't know any angles here, so I can't use trigonometry directly. Maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height.\n\nSuppose I have a triangle with sides a, b, and c, and I drop an altitude to side c, splitting it into d and (c - d). Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, h^2 + d^2 = a^2, and h^2 + (c - d)^2 = b^2.\n\nSo, I have:\n\nh^2 + d^2 = a^2 (1)\n\nh^2 + (c - d)^2 = b^2 (2)\n\nSubtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n(h^2 + (c - d)^2) - (h^2 + d^2) = b^2 - a^2\n\nExpand (c - d)^2: c^2 - 2cd + d^2\n\nSo, h^2 + c^2 - 2cd + d^2 - h^2 - d^2 = b^2 - a^2\n\nSimplify: c^2 - 2cd = b^2 - a^2\n\nNow, solve for d: c^2 - b^2 + a^2 = 2cd \u2192 d = (c^2 - b^2 + a^2)/(2c)\n\nWait, this seems familiar. Actually, this is similar to the formula for the length of the median, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me plug in the values: a = 7, b = 10, c = 13.\n\nSo, d = (13^2 - 10^2 + 7^2)/(2*13) = (169 - 100 + 49)/26 = (118)/26 = 59/13 \u2248 4.538 inches\n\nThen, h^2 + d^2 = a^2 \u2192 h^2 + (59/13)^2 = 7^2 \u2192 h^2 + 3481/169 = 49 \u2192 h^2 = 49 - 3481/169\n\nConvert 49 to 49*169/169 = 8281/169\n\nSo, h^2 = 8281/169 - 3481/169 = 4800/169 \u2192 h = sqrt(4800)/13 = (sqrt(4800))/13\n\nSimplify sqrt(4800): sqrt(1600 * 3) = 40sqrt(3)\n\nSo, h = 40sqrt(3)/13 inches\n\nThen, area = (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*13*(40sqrt(3)/13) = (1/2)*40sqrt(3) = 20sqrt(3) inches squared\n\nWait, that's the same result I got from Heron's formula. Good, it matches.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized that this is a right-angled triangle because 7^2 + 10^2 = 49 + 100 = 149, which is not equal to 13^2 = 169, so it's not a right-angled triangle. Wait, maybe I should check if it's a right-angled triangle.\n\nFor a right-angled triangle, the Pythagorean theorem should hold: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where c is the hypotenuse.\n\nHere, 7^2 + 10^2 = 49 + 100 = 149, which is not equal to 13^2 = 169, so it's not a right-angled triangle. So, that approach won't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use trigonometry to find one of the angles and then use the formula area = (1/2)*a*b*sin(C).\n\nBut to use that, I need to know one of the angles, which I don't. I would have to use the law of cosines to find an angle first, which might be more complicated than using Heron's formula.\n\nSo, Heron's formula seems like the most straightforward method here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the area in terms of the sides and the radius of the circumscribed circle, but I don't know the radius, so that won't help.\n\nOr the formula involving the inradius, but again, I don't know the inradius.\n\nSo, Heron's formula is probably the best way to go.\n\nJust to double-check, let's plug the values into Heron's formula again.\n\ns = 15 inches\n\nArea = sqrt[15(15 - 7)(15 - 10)(15 - 13)] = sqrt[15 * 8 * 5 * 2] = sqrt[1200] = 20sqrt(3) inches squared\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I want a decimal approximation, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so area \u2248 20 * 1.732 = 34.64 inches squared.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify, I can leave it in terms of sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 20sqrt(3) inches squared.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20\\sqrt{3}} \\]"
