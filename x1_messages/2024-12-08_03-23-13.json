        "content": "To find the sum of all three-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 1, 2, and 3 without repetition, we can follow a systematic approach.\n\nFirst, let's determine how many such three-digit numbers exist. Since we're forming three-digit numbers without repeating any digits, and we have three distinct digits (1, 2, and 3), the total number of possible combinations is the number of permutations of these three digits taken all at once. The formula for permutations without repetition is n!, where n is the number of distinct items.\n\nSo, for our case:\n\nNumber of three-digit numbers = 3! = 6\n\nNow, let's list all possible three-digit numbers using the digits 1, 2, and 3 without repetition:\n\n1. 123\n\n2. 132\n\n3. 213\n\n4. 231\n\n5. 312\n\n6. 321\n\nNext, we need to find the sum of these numbers:\n\nSum = 123 + 132 + 213 + 231 + 312 + 321\n\nInstead of adding them one by one, which can be time-consuming, let's look for a pattern or a formula that can help us calculate this sum more efficiently.\n\nEach digit (1, 2, and 3) will appear in each place (hundreds, tens, and units) an equal number of times because all permutations are considered.\n\nSince there are 6 numbers in total and 3 positions, each digit will appear in each position (hundreds, tens, units) exactly 2 times (because 6 divided by 3 is 2).\n\nSo, for each position:\n\n- Hundreds place: each digit (1, 2, 3) appears 2 times.\n\n- Tens place: each digit (1, 2, 3) appears 2 times.\n\n- Units place: each digit (1, 2, 3) appears 2 times.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total sum contributed by each position.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place:\n\nEach digit appears 2 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSum for hundreds place = 2*(1 + 2 + 3)*100 = 2*6*100 = 1200\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nSum for tens place = 2*(1 + 2 + 3)*10 = 2*6*10 = 120\n\nAnd for the units place:\n\nSum for units place = 2*(1 + 2 + 3)*1 = 2*6*1 = 12\n\nNow, the total sum is the sum of the contributions from all three places:\n\nTotal sum = 1200 + 120 + 12 = 1332\n\nTherefore, the sum of all three-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 1, 2, and 3 without repetition is 1332.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1332} \\]"
