        "content": "Yes, Coca-Cola played a significant role in shaping the modern image of Santa Claus as a jolly old man in red robes. Prior to the 1930s, depictions of Santa Claus varied widely, ranging from a tall and gaunt figure to a more elfin appearance. However, in the 1930s, Coca-Cola commissioned artist Haddon Sundblom to create illustrations for their Christmas advertising campaigns.\n\nSundblom's illustrations featured Santa Claus as a friendly, plump, and cheerful character wearing red and white clothing, which coincidentally matched Coca-Cola's brand colors. These images were widely distributed and became immensely popular, helping to standardize the modern image of Santa Claus that we recognize today.\n\nWhile Coca-Cola did not create the concept of Santa Claus, their advertising efforts significantly influenced and solidified the contemporary visual representation of this beloved figure."
