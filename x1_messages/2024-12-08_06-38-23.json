        "content": "So, I have this question here: \"The human body contains about 60% water. If a person weighs 70 kg, how much of their weight is due to water? Explain step-by-step.\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down. So, first off, I know that percentages are parts per hundred. So, if something is 60%, that means it's 60 out of 100, or 60/100, which is the same as 0.60 in decimal form.\n\nNow, the question says that the human body contains about 60% water. So, for a person who weighs 70 kg, I need to find out how much of that 70 kg is water.\n\nTo find that out, I think I need to calculate 60% of 70 kg. So, in mathematical terms, that would be:\n\nWater weight = 60% of 70 kg\n\nFirst, I'll convert the percentage to a decimal. As I mentioned earlier, 60% is the same as 0.60.\n\nSo, Water weight = 0.60 \u00d7 70 kg\n\nNow, multiplying 0.60 by 70:\n\n0.60 \u00d7 70 = 42 kg\n\nSo, the water weight is 42 kg.\n\nBut let's double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Another way to think about percentages is to use the formula:\n\n(Percentage / 100) \u00d7 Total amount\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n(60 / 100) \u00d7 70 kg = 0.60 \u00d7 70 kg = 42 kg\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of fractions. 60% is the same as 60/100, which can be simplified to 3/5.\n\nSo, Water weight = (3/5) \u00d7 70 kg\n\nNow, multiplying 3/5 by 70:\n\n(3 \u00d7 70) / 5 = 210 / 5 = 42 kg\n\nAgain, I get 42 kg.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I end up with 42 kg.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another approach. If 60% of the body is water, then the remaining 40% must be other materials, like muscles, bones, etc.\n\nBut I don't need to calculate that for this question. The question only asks for the water weight.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the units. The weight is given in kilograms (kg), and since water is measured in mass, kg is appropriate.\n\nBut just to be sure, in the context of body weight, kg is a measure of mass, not weight. Weight is actually a force measured in newtons, but since in everyday language, people use \"weight\" to mean mass, I'll stick with kg.\n\nSo, the answer should be 42 kg.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this. Suppose I have 100% of the body weight is 70 kg. Then, 60% of that should be water.\n\nSo, setting up a proportion:\n\n100% is to 70 kg as 60% is to x kg\n\nSo, x = (60% / 100%) \u00d7 70 kg = 0.60 \u00d7 70 kg = 42 kg\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of decimals without converting the percentage.\n\nSo, 60% of 70 kg is simply 0.60 times 70 kg, which is 42 kg.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer is definitely 42 kg.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider the context. An average human body is about 60% water. For a 70 kg person, 42 kg of water makes sense because that's roughly two-thirds of the body weight, which aligns with the general knowledge that water makes up a significant portion of body mass.\n\nAdditionally, I can think about it in terms of cross-multiplication.\n\nIf 100% corresponds to 70 kg, then 60% corresponds to x kg.\n\nSo, 100% / 70 kg = 60% / x kg\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n100% \u00d7 x kg = 60% \u00d7 70 kg\n\nSo, x kg = (60% \u00d7 70 kg) / 100% = (0.60 \u00d7 70 kg) = 42 kg\n\nOnce again, 42 kg.\n\nI think I've covered all the possible ways to approach this problem, and every method leads me to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the amount of weight due to water in a 70 kg person is 42 kg.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{42 \\text{ kg}} \\]"
