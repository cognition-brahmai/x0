        "content": "Let's see. The company has an annual budget of $1,200,000. They allocate 35% for salaries and 25% for office expenses. The rest goes to marketing. I need to find out how much is allocated for marketing.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much is allocated for salaries and office expenses combined, and then subtract that from the total budget to find the marketing allocation.\n\nSo, salaries are 35% of $1,200,000. Let me calculate that:\n\n35% of $1,200,000 is (35/100) * 1,200,000 = 0.35 * 1,200,000 = $420,000.\n\nNext, office expenses are 25% of $1,200,000. So:\n\n25% of $1,200,000 is (25/100) * 1,200,000 = 0.25 * 1,200,000 = $300,000.\n\nNow, total allocation for salaries and office expenses is $420,000 + $300,000 = $720,000.\n\nTo find the marketing allocation, I subtract this total from the overall budget:\n\n$1,200,000 - $720,000 = $480,000.\n\nSo, the company allocates $480,000 for marketing.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's another way to approach this. Since I know the percentages allocated to salaries and office expenses, perhaps I can find the percentage allocated to marketing first and then calculate the dollar amount.\n\nLet's try that. Total percentage allocated to salaries and office expenses is 35% + 25% = 60%.\n\nTherefore, the percentage allocated to marketing is 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nNow, 40% of $1,200,000 is (40/100) * 1,200,000 = 0.40 * 1,200,000 = $480,000.\n\nHey, I get the same answer as before, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could verify this by calculating each percentage directly from the budget and ensuring they add up to the total.\n\nSo, salaries: 35% of $1,200,000 = $420,000.\n\nOffice expenses: 25% of $1,200,000 = $300,000.\n\nMarketing: 40% of $1,200,000 = $480,000.\n\nTotal allocated: $420,000 + $300,000 + $480,000 = $1,200,000, which matches the total budget.\n\nPerfect, everything checks out.\n\nI think the answer is $480,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{480000} \\]"
