        "content": "Let's see. There are 4 barbers in the town, and each one cuts hair for exactly 3 other barbers. So, if we think about it, each barber is giving haircuts to 3 others. That means, for each barber, there are 3 haircuts being given.\n\nSo, if there are 4 barbers, and each gives 3 haircuts, then total haircuts would be 4 times 3, which is 12. But wait a minute, that doesn't sound right because in this setup, each haircut involves two barbers: one giving the haircut and one receiving it.\n\nActually, maybe I should think about it differently. If each barber cuts hair for 3 others, and there are 4 barbers, then it seems like there are 4 barbers each giving 3 haircuts, leading to 12 haircuts in total. But is there any overlap or double-counting here?\n\nLet me try to list them out to make sure. Let's name the barbers A, B, C, and D.\n\n- A gives haircuts to B, C, and D.\n\n- B gives haircuts to A, C, and D.\n\n- C gives haircuts to A, B, and D.\n\n- D gives haircuts to A, B, and C.\n\nWait a second, in this setup, A is giving haircuts to B, C, and D, and B is giving haircuts to A, C, and D, and so on. So, for example, A gives to B, and B gives back to A. Similarly, A gives to C, C gives back to A, and so on.\n\nSo, each pair of barbers is exchanging haircuts. For example, A and B: A gives to B, and B gives to A. Same with A and C, A and D, B and C, B and D, and C and D.\n\nSo, how many unique pairs of barbers are there? Well, with 4 barbers, the number of unique pairs is \"4 choose 2,\" which is 6.\n\nAnd in each pair, there are two haircuts: one in each direction. So, 6 pairs times 2 haircuts per pair would be 12 haircuts in total.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that might be double-counting. Is it?\n\nLet me think again. If A gives to B, that's one haircut. B gives to A, that's another haircut. Similarly for all other pairs.\n\nSo, yes, that means there are 12 haircuts in total.\n\nAlternatively, since each barber gives 3 haircuts, and there are 4 barbers, 4 times 3 is 12.\n\nSo, it seems consistent.\n\nBut let's consider if there's another way to look at it. Maybe using graph theory. If we consider each barber as a node, and each haircut as a directed edge from the barber giving the haircut to the barber receiving it.\n\nSo, in this graph, each node has an out-degree of 3 (since each gives 3 haircuts) and an in-degree of 3 (since each receives 3 haircuts).\n\nThe total number of edges in the graph would be the total number of haircuts.\n\nSince each of the 4 barbers has 3 outgoing edges, the total number of edges is 4 times 3, which is 12.\n\nAlternatively, since each pair of barbers has two directed edges between them (one in each direction), and there are 6 unique pairs, total haircuts are 12.\n\nSo, either way, it seems to be 12 haircuts.\n\nBut let me double-check with a smaller number to see if this logic holds.\n\nSuppose there are 2 barbers: A and B.\n\nEach gives haircuts to the other one.\n\nSo, A gives to B, and B gives to A. That's 2 haircuts in total.\n\nUsing the formula: number of barbers is 2, each gives 1 haircut, so 2 times 1 is 2.\n\nAlternatively, number of unique pairs is 1 (A and B), and each pair has 2 haircuts, so 1 times 2 is 2.\n\nNow, with 3 barbers: A, B, C.\n\nEach gives haircuts to the other two.\n\nSo, A gives to B and C.\n\nB gives to A and C.\n\nC gives to A and B.\n\nTotal haircuts: 6.\n\nUsing the formula: 3 barbers, each gives 2 haircuts, 3 times 2 is 6.\n\nAlternatively, number of unique pairs is 3 (AB, AC, BC), each with 2 haircuts, so 3 times 2 is 6.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nSo, extrapolating to 4 barbers, each giving 3 haircuts, total should be 12.\n\nAlternatively, number of unique pairs is 6, times 2 haircuts per pair, total 12.\n\nTherefore, the total number of haircuts given among the barbers is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
