        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a C# program that reads a large text file line by line and counts the occurrences of each word, storing the results in a dictionary. This is a great way to handle large files efficiently without loading the entire file into memory at once.\n\nFirst, make sure you have a text file ready to test your program. Let's assume the file is named \"largeTextFile.txt\" and it's located in the same directory as your C# project.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Create a New C# Console Project\n\nIf you're using Visual Studio, create a new Console App project. If you're using .NET Core, you can create a new console project using the dotnet CLI:\n\n```sh\ndotnet new console -n WordCount\ncd WordCount\n```\n\n### Step 2: Add Necessary Namespaces\n\nYou'll need to include some namespaces for file handling and regular expressions:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Text.RegularExpressions;\n```\n\n### Step 3: Read the File Line by Line\n\nTo read a large file efficiently, use a `StreamReader` which allows you to read the file line by line without loading the entire file into memory.\n\n### Step 4: Split Lines into Words\n\nFor each line, split it into words. You can use regular expressions to handle different types of word boundaries.\n\n### Step 5: Count Word Occurrences\n\nUse a `Dictionary<string, int>` to keep track of the word counts. For each word, check if it's already in the dictionary and increment its count accordingly.\n\n### Step 6: Handle Punctuation and Case Sensitivity\n\nTo ensure accurate word counts, you might want to convert all words to lowercase and remove punctuation.\n\n### Complete Program\n\nHere's the complete C# program that accomplishes this:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Text.RegularExpressions;\n\nnamespace WordCount\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            string filePath = \"largeTextFile.txt\";\n            var wordCounts = new Dictionary<string, int>();\n\n            try\n            {\n                using (var reader = new StreamReader(filePath))\n                {\n                    string line;\n                    while ((line = reader.ReadLine()) != null)\n                    {\n                        // Use regex to find words and ignore punctuation\n                        var matches = Regex.Matches(line.ToLower(), @\"\\b\\w+\\b\");\n                        foreach (Match match in matches)\n                        {\n                            string word = match.Value;\n                            if (wordCounts.ContainsKey(word))\n                            {\n                                wordCounts[word]++;\n                            }\n                            else\n                            {\n                                wordCounts[word] = 1;\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n\n                // Print the word counts\n                foreach (var pair in wordCounts)\n                {\n                    Console.WriteLine($\"{pair.Key}: {pair.Value}\");\n                }\n            }\n            catch (Exception ex)\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine($\"An error occurred: {ex.Message}\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading the File**: We use a `StreamReader` to read the file line by line, which is memory efficient for large files.\n2. **Splitting into Words**: We use a regular expression `\\b\\w+\\b` to match words while ignoring punctuation. Converting the line to lowercase ensures that the word count is case-insensitive.\n3. **Counting Words**: We maintain a dictionary to keep track of word counts. For each word, we check if it's already in the dictionary and update its count accordingly.\n4. **Error Handling**: We wrap the reading and processing logic in a try-catch block to handle any potential exceptions, such as file not found or read errors.\n\nThis program should give you a good starting point for counting word occurrences in large text files using C#."
