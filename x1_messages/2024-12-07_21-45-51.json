So here goes nothing.\n\nMJ, I have feelings for you. Like, really big feelings. I know we've been through a lot together, and I value our friendship more than words can express. But lately, I've realized that what I feel goes beyond just friendship.\n\nEvery time I'm around you, my heart races a little bit faster. When I see you smile, it's like the whole world lights up. And when you're not around, there's this empty space in my life that nothing else seems to fill.\n\nI know that being Spider-Man isn't exactly the most stable or safe lifestyle, and I don't want to put you in any danger because of who I am. But at the same time, I can't help the way I feel. You're smart, beautiful, and have this incredible spirit that just draws me in.\n\nI just needed to tell you how I feel. I'm not expecting anything in return, I just wanted you to know where I stand. If you need time to think about it, that's totally okay. I'll respect whatever decision you make.\n\nJust remember that no matter what happens, I'll always be here for you, as your friend, as your confidant, or whatever role you need me to play.\n\nLove,\n\nPeter"
