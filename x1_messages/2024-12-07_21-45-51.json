Here it goes:\n\nI'm not a textbook, but I can teach you a thing or two.\nI'm not a tutor, but I can help you through.\nWith notes and rhythms, I dance in your head,\nEnhancing memory, making learning instead.\n\nI can be classical, jazz, or pop,\nBut whatever the genre, I've got the scope\nTo boost your focus, reduce stress too,\nAnd even help with tasks that need to be renewed.\n\nSo, what am I? A friend that's always there,\nImproving cognition without any affair.\nJust listen closely, let my melodies play,\nAnd watch as your mind finds its way.\n\nWhat am I?"
