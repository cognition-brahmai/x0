This place has been abandoned for years.\n\n**Eleanor:** Grandpa, it's our family's lighthouse. I want to restore it, make it shine again.\n\n**Captain Thomas:** But they say it's haunted. People have reported strange noises and sightings.\n\n**Eleanor:** Nonsense. Just old tales to scare visitors away.\n\n*(SFX: Creaking door as they enter the lighthouse)*\n\n**Captain Thomas:** *(Whispering)* Maybe we should leave while we still can.\n\n**Eleanor:** We've come this far. Let's at least take a look inside.\n\n*(SFX: Echoing footsteps upstairs)*\n\n**[Scene 2: Exploring the Lighthouse]**\n\n*(SFX: Wind whistling through cracks, distant creaks)*\n\n**Eleanor:** Wow, it's bigger than Iremember. So much dust and cobwebs.\n\n**Captain Thomas:** Be careful, Eleanor. The stairs are rotten in some places.\n\n*(SFX: Footsteps pause, then continue carefully)*\n\n**Eleanor:** Grandpa, do you hear that?\n\n**Captain Thomas:** Hear what?\n\n**Eleanor:** Like...whispers. Far away.\n\n*(SFX: Faint whispers, indistinct murmurs)*\n\n**Captain Thomas:** Probably just the wind. Let's keep moving.\n\n*(SFX: They reach the top, the beacon room)*\n\n**Eleanor:** Oh, look at this! The lens is still intact.\n\n**Captain Thomas:** Amazing. It must have been magnificent when it was operational.\n\n*(SFX: The hum of the beacon starts softly, gradually getting louder)*\n\n**Eleanor:** Let's clean this up and get it working again.\n\n**Captain Thomas:** Maybe we should call it a day. It's getting late.\n\n**Eleanor:** Just a little more, Grandpa. Please?\n\n**Captain Thomas:** Alright, but only for a bit.\n\n*(SFX: Cleaning sounds, muffled conversation)*\n\n**[Scene 3: The Storm Approaches]**\n\n*(SFX: Thunder grows louder, rain starts to pour)*\n\n**Eleanor:** Grandpa, I think a storm is coming.\n\n**Captain Thomas:** We need to get down from here. It's not safe.\n\n*(SFX: Strong gusts of wind, lightning flashes outside)*\n\n**Eleanor:** Wait, the beacon isn't working properly. The light is flickering.\n\n**Captain Thomas:** I'll check the mechanism.\n\n*(SFX: Sounds of Captain Thomas fiddling with machinery)*\n\n**Eleanor:** Grandpa, I'm scared.\n\n**Captain Thomas:** It's okay, Eleanor. I'm here.\n\n*(SFX: Sudden loud crash, like something falling)*\n\n**Eleanor:** What was that?\n\n**Captain Thomas:** I don't know. Stay here.\n\n*(SFX: Captain Thomas descends the stairs cautiously)*\n\n**Eleanor:** Grandpa? Grandpa, where are you?\n\n*(SFX: Footsteps echoing downstairs, then silence)*\n\n**Eleanor:** Grandpa?\n\n*(SFX: Whispering becomes louder, more distinct)*\n\n**Ghost:** *(Whispering)* Leave...while you still can.\n\n**Eleanor:** Who's there? Show yourself!\n\n*(SFX: Eerie laughter, footsteps approaching)*\n\n**Eleanor:** *(Shouting)* Grandpa! Help me!\n\n*(SFX: More whispers, sounds of something moving upstairs)*\n\n**[Scene 4: The Haunting Intensifies]**\n\n*(SFX: Thunder and lightning continue, rain pounds against the lighthouse)*\n\n**Eleanor:** *(Panicking)* This is ridiculous. I need to find Grandpa.\n\n*(SFX: Eleanor descends the stairs cautiously)*\n\n**Eleanor:** Grandpa? Can you hear me?\n\n*(SFX: No response, only the sound of the storm)*\n\n**Eleanor:** Maybe he went down to the kitchen to find a flashlight.\n\n*(SFX: Eleanor reaches the bottom floor, opens doors)*\n\n**Eleanor:** Grandpa? Where are you?\n\n*(SFX: A door slams shut somewhere upstairs)*\n\n**Eleanor:** That wasn't me. Someone...or something is here with me.\n\n*(SFX: Whispering gets louder, footsteps echo)*\n\n**Ghost:** *(Whispering)* You shouldn't have come here.\n\n**Eleanor:** *(Defiantly)* I'm not leaving until I find Grandpa.\n\n*(SFX: Sudden loud bang, like a window shattering)*\n\n**Eleanor:** *(Screaming)* What is happening?\n\n*(SFX: The beacon upstairs starts flashing rapidly, casting eerie shadows)*\n\n**[Scene 5: The Revelation]**\n\n*(SFX: Eleanor runs upstairs, panting)*\n\n**Eleanor:** Grandpa! Please, answer me!\n\n*(SFX: She reaches the beacon room, finds Captain Thomas unconscious)*\n\n**Eleanor:** Grandpa! Wake up!\n\n*(SFX: Eleanor tries to help him, then hears more whispers)*\n\n**Ghost:** *(Louder now)* He shouldn't have come back. None of you should have come back.\n\n**Eleanor:** Who are you? What do you want?\n\n**Ghost:** *(Sobs)* They promised to bring me home. But they never did.\n\n**Eleanor:** I don't understand.\n\n**Ghost:** *(Angry now)* You don't understand? You have no idea what you've awakened.\n\n*(SFX: The beacon flashes erratically, lightning outside syncs with the flashes)*\n\n**Eleanor:** Please, I just want to help my grandfather.\n\n**Ghost:** *(Softens)* Help him leave. Before it's too late.\n\n**Eleanor:** How do I do that?\n\n**Ghost:** *(Whispers)* Find the journal. In the old keeper's quarters.\n\n**Eleanor:** I'll try.\n\n*(SFX: Eleanor hurries downstairs, searching rooms)*\n\n**Eleanor:** *(Muttering)* Old keeper's quarters...where is that?\n\n*(SFX: She finds a small room, dusty and forgotten)*\n\n**Eleanor:** Here, a journal. *(Flips through pages)* Old entries...about the lighthouse.\n\n*(SFX: Reads aloud)* \"Another storm tonight. The beacon failed again. I fear for my life.\"\n\n**Ghost:** *(Whispering)* That was me. I was the keeper before you.\n\n**Eleanor:** Why are you here? Why haven't you moved on?\n\n**Ghost:** *(Desperate)* Because I died here, alone. No one came to rescue me.\n\n**Eleanor:** I'm sorry. Is that why you're haunting the lighthouse?\n\n**Ghost:** *(Nods, though Eleanor can't see)* To warn others. To keep them away.\n\n**Eleanor:** But Grandpa and I just want to restore it. We mean no harm.\n\n**Ghost:** *(Skeptical)* You think you can fix what's broken? It's too late.\n\n**Eleanor:** Please, help us leave safely. We'll make sure your story is told, that you're remembered.\n\n**Ghost:** *(Pauses)* If you do that, I'll let you go.\n\n**Eleanor:** Deal.\n\n*(SFX: The whispers subside, the beacon stabilizes)*\n\n**[Scene 6: Escape from the Lighthouse]**\n\n*(SFX: Eleanor rushes back to Captain Thomas, tries to wake him up)*\n\n**Eleanor:** Grandpa, wake up. We need to get out of here.\n\n*(SFX: Captain Thomas stirs, groans)*\n\n**Captain Thomas:** Eleanor? What happened?\n\n**Eleanor:** Long story. We need to go now.\n\n*(SFX: They make their way downstairs, the storm still rages outside)*\n\n**Captain Thomas:** How are we going to get out in this weather?\n\n**Eleanor:** I'll carry you if I have to.\n\n*(SFX: They reach the entrance, the door is stuck)*\n\n**Captain Thomas:** It's jammed. We're trapped.\n\n*(SFX: The ghost's whisper is heard again)*\n\n**Ghost:** *(Gentler now)* Follow the light.\n\n**Eleanor:** What?\n\n*(SFX: The beacon starts flashing in a specific pattern, guiding them)*\n\n**Eleanor:** Maybe it's showing us a way out.\n\n*(SFX: They follow the beacon's flashes, finding a hidden exit)*\n\n**Captain Thomas:** Over here. There's a back door.\n\n*(SFX: They exit the lighthouse, the storm seems to Part slightly)*\n\n**Eleanor:** Hurry, Grandpa. Let's get to the car.\n\n*(SFX: They run through the rain, reaching a car parked nearby)*\n\n**Captain Thomas:** Thank goodness. We made it.\n\n*(SFX: They get into the car, start the engine)*\n\n**Eleanor:** Now, to keep our promise. I need to find a way to honor the old keeper's memory.\n\n**Captain Thomas:** We will, Eleanor. We will.\n\n*(SFX: The car drives away, the lighthouse fades into the fog)*\n\n**Ghost:** *(Whispering, fading away)* Finally...peace.\n\n*(SFX: The lighthouse beacon dims, then goes out completely)*\n\n**[End of Play]**"
