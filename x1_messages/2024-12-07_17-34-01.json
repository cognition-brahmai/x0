        "content": "To calculate the total revenue for the month, we need to find out how much money the company made from selling both Product X and Product Y. Revenue is simply the amount of money earned from selling goods or services, and it's calculated by multiplying the number of units sold by the price per unit for each product, then adding those amounts together.\n\nFirst, let's look at Product X:\n\n- Price per unit of Product X: $30\n\n- Number of units sold: 100\n\nSo, the revenue from Product X is:\n\nRevenue from X = Price per unit of X \u00d7 Number of units sold of X\n\nRevenue from X = $30 \u00d7 100\n\nRevenue from X = $3,000\n\nNext, let's calculate the revenue from Product Y:\n\n- Price per unit of Product Y: $50\n\n- Number of units sold: 200\n\nRevenue from Y = Price per unit of Y \u00d7 Number of units sold of Y\n\nRevenue from Y = $50 \u00d7 200\n\nRevenue from Y = $10,000\n\nNow, to find the total revenue for the month, we add the revenue from both products together:\n\nTotal revenue = Revenue from X + Revenue from Y\n\nTotal revenue = $3,000 + $10,000\n\nTotal revenue = $13,000\n\nSo, the company's total revenue for that month is $13,000.\n\nTo double-check our calculations, let's ensure that we've multiplied and added correctly.\n\nFirst, for Product X:\n\n$30 per unit \u00d7 100 units = $3,000\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nFor Product Y:\n\n$50 per unit \u00d7 200 units = $10,000\n\nThat also seems correct.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n$3,000 + $10,000 = $13,000\n\nEverything checks out. Therefore, the total revenue for the month is indeed $13,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13000} \\]"
