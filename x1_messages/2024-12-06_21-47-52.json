        "content": "I'm going to create a simple ATM simulation in C#. This program will allow users to check their balance, deposit money, withdraw money, and exit the program. I need to make sure that users enter a valid PIN before accessing their account, that withdrawal amounts do not exceed the available balance, and that there's a daily withdrawal limit enforced.\n\nFirst, I need to plan out the structure of the program. Since it's a console application, I'll be using the Console class to handle input and output. I'll need to keep track of the user's balance, PIN, and the daily withdrawal limit.\n\nLet me think about how to handle the PIN validation. I'll assume there's a single user account with a predefined PIN. For simplicity, I'll hardcode the PIN in the program, but in a real-world scenario, this would be stored securely, perhaps hashed and salted.\n\nNext, I need to decide on the initial balance and the daily withdrawal limit. Let's say the initial balance is $1000 and the daily withdrawal limit is $500. I'll need variables to store these values and keep track of how much has been withdrawn in a day.\n\nI should also consider the data types to use. Since we're dealing with money, it's important to use a type that can handle decimal places accurately. In C#, the decimal type is suitable for financial calculations.\n\nNow, let's think about the menu options. The program should present a menu to the user with options to check balance, deposit, withdraw, and exit. The user should be prompted to enter their PIN before they can access these options.\n\nOnce the PIN is validated, the user can choose an option. For checking balance, it's straightforward\u2014just display the current balance. For depositing money, the user enters an amount, and it's added to the balance. For withdrawing money, I need to check if the withdrawal amount is less than or equal to the available balance and also less than or equal to the daily withdrawal limit minus the amount already withdrawn that day.\n\nI need to keep track of the total withdrawals in a day. I'll need a variable to store the total withdrawals for the day, and each time a withdrawal is made, I'll add the withdrawal amount to this total.\n\nLet me outline the steps in pseudocode:\n\n1. Define constants for PIN, initial balance, and daily withdrawal limit.\n\n2. Initialize variables for current balance and total withdrawals today.\n\n3. Prompt user to enter PIN.\n\n4. Validate PIN.\n\n5. If PIN is correct, display menu:\n\na. Check balance\n\nb. Deposit money\n\nc. Withdraw money\n\nd. Exit\n\n6. Based on user's choice, perform the corresponding action.\n\n7. For withdrawal, check if withdrawal amount <= balance and withdrawal amount + total withdrawals today <= daily withdrawal limit.\n\n8. Update balance and total withdrawals accordingly.\n\n9. Loop back to menu until user chooses to exit.\n\nI should also handle invalid inputs, like non-numeric input for amounts or invalid menu choices.\n\nLet me consider how to handle the daily withdrawal limit across multiple sessions. For simplicity, I'll assume that the program resets the total withdrawals at the end of each day or when the program is restarted. In a real ATM system, this would be managed based on actual dates.\n\nNow, let's start translating this into actual C# code.\n\nFirst, I'll set up the console application project in Visual Studio.\n\nThen, I'll define the constants and variables:\n\nconst string CORRECT_PIN = \"1234\";\n\nconst decimal INITIAL_BALANCE = 1000.00m;\n\nconst decimal DAILY_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT = 500.00m;\n\ndecimal currentBalance = INITIAL_BALANCE;\n\ndecimal totalWithdrawalsToday = 0.00m;\n\nNext, I'll write a method to prompt the user for the PIN and validate it.\n\nstring enteredPin = Console.ReadLine();\n\nif (enteredPin != CORRECT_PIN)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid PIN. Exiting.\");\n\nreturn;\n\n}\n\nThen, I'll create a loop to display the menu and handle user choices until they choose to exit.\n\nwhile (true)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"ATM Menu:\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"1. Check Balance\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"2. Deposit Money\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"3. Withdraw Money\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"4. Exit\");\n\nConsole.Write(\"Enter your choice: \");\n\nstring choice = Console.ReadLine();\n\nswitch (choice)\n\n{\n\ncase \"1\":\n\n// Check Balance\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Your balance is: $\" + currentBalance);\n\nbreak;\n\ncase \"2\":\n\n// Deposit Money\n\nConsole.Write(\"Enter amount to deposit: \");\n\nif (decimal.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out decimal depositAmount))\n\n{\n\ncurrentBalance += depositAmount;\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Deposit successful. New balance: $\" + currentBalance);\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid amount.\");\n\n}\n\nbreak;\n\ncase \"3\":\n\n// Withdraw Money\n\nConsole.Write(\"Enter amount to withdraw: \");\n\nif (decimal.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out decimal withdrawalAmount))\n\n{\n\nif (withdrawalAmount > currentBalance)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Insufficient funds.\");\n\n}\n\nelse if (totalWithdrawalsToday + withdrawalAmount > DAILY_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Daily withdrawal limit exceeded.\");\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\ncurrentBalance -= withdrawalAmount;\n\ntotalWithdrawalsToday += withdrawalAmount;\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Withdrawal successful. New balance: $\" + currentBalance);\n\n}\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid amount.\");\n\n}\n\nbreak;\n\ncase \"4\":\n\n// Exit\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Thank you for using the ATM. Goodbye!\");\n\nreturn;\n\ndefault:\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\");\n\nbreak;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThis seems like a good starting point. I need to make sure that the program handles only valid numeric inputs for deposits and withdrawals. I'm using decimal.TryParse to attempt to parse the input into a decimal, which is safer than directly converting it, as it avoids exceptions for invalid inputs.\n\nI should also consider adding some error messages and perhaps limit the number of invalid PIN attempts, but for simplicity, I'll just have it exit after one invalid attempt.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the code. Since it's a simple program, I can keep it all in the Main method. But for better organization, I could create separate methods for each functionality, like CheckBalance(), Deposit(), Withdraw(), and ValidatePin().\n\nLet me refactor the code to use methods.\n\nFirst, create a method to validate the PIN:\n\nbool ValidatePin()\n\n{\n\nConsole.Write(\"Enter your PIN: \");\n\nstring enteredPin = Console.ReadLine();\n\nreturn enteredPin == CORRECT_PIN;\n\n}\n\nThen, create methods for each menu option:\n\nvoid CheckBalance(decimal balance)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Your balance is: $\" + balance);\n\n}\n\nvoid Deposit(ref decimal balance)\n\n{\n\nConsole.Write(\"Enter amount to deposit: \");\n\nif (decimal.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out decimal depositAmount))\n\n{\n\nbalance += depositAmount;\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Deposit successful. New balance: $\" + balance);\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid amount.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\nvoid Withdraw(ref decimal balance, ref decimal totalWithdrawalsToday)\n\n{\n\nConsole.Write(\"Enter amount to withdraw: \");\n\nif (decimal.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out decimal withdrawalAmount))\n\n{\n\nif (withdrawalAmount > balance)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Insufficient funds.\");\n\n}\n\nelse if (totalWithdrawalsToday + withdrawalAmount > DAILY_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Daily withdrawal limit exceeded.\");\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nbalance -= withdrawalAmount;\n\ntotalWithdrawalsToday += withdrawalAmount;\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Withdrawal successful. New balance: $\" + balance);\n\n}\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid amount.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\nNow, in the Main method, I can call these methods based on the user's choice.\n\nIn the Main method:\n\nif (!ValidatePin())\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid PIN. Exiting.\");\n\nreturn;\n\n}\n\ndecimal currentBalance = INITIAL_BALANCE;\n\ndecimal totalWithdrawalsToday = 0.00m;\n\nwhile (true)\n\n{\n\n// Display menu and get choice\n\n// Based on choice, call corresponding method\n\n}\n\nThis makes the code cleaner and more modular.\n\nI should also consider adding a way to reset the totalWithdrawalsToday at the end of the day, but since this is a simple simulation, I'll assume it resets when the program restarts.\n\nAnother consideration is to format the currency outputs to two decimal places. I can use the \"F2\" format specifier for that.\n\nFor example:\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Your balance is: $\" + balance.ToString(\"F2\"));\n\nSimilarly for other amounts.\n\nLet me update the methods accordingly.\n\nvoid CheckBalance(decimal balance)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Your balance is: $\" + balance.ToString(\"F2\"));\n\n}\n\nvoid Deposit(ref decimal balance)\n\n{\n\nConsole.Write(\"Enter amount to deposit: \");\n\nif (decimal.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out decimal depositAmount))\n\n{\n\nbalance += depositAmount;\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Deposit successful. New balance: $\" + balance.ToString(\"F2\"));\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid amount.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\nvoid Withdraw(ref decimal balance, ref decimal totalWithdrawalsToday)\n\n{\n\nConsole.Write(\"Enter amount to withdraw: \");\n\nif (decimal.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out decimal withdrawalAmount))\n\n{\n\nif (withdrawalAmount > balance)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Insufficient funds.\");\n\n}\n\nelse if (totalWithdrawalsToday + withdrawalAmount > DAILY_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Daily withdrawal limit exceeded.\");\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nbalance -= withdrawalAmount;\n\ntotalWithdrawalsToday += withdrawalAmount;\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Withdrawal successful. New balance: $\" + balance.ToString(\"F2\"));\n\n}\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid amount.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThis should give a more professional look to the output.\n\nI might also want to add some checks to ensure that withdrawal and deposit amounts are positive.\n\nFor example, in the Withdraw method:\n\nif (withdrawalAmount <= 0)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Withdrawal amount must be positive.\");\n\nreturn;\n\n}\n\nSimilarly, in the Deposit method:\n\nif (depositAmount <= 0)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Deposit amount must be positive.\");\n\nreturn;\n\n}\n\nThis prevents invalid operations.\n\nLet me also think about the user experience. After each operation, the program should wait for the user to read the message before clearing the screen or proceeding to the next operation. In a real ATM, the screen would clear after certain operations for security reasons, but in this simulation, I'll just wait for the user to press a key before continuing.\n\nI can use Console.ReadLine() or Console.ReadKey() to achieve this.\n\nFor example, after each operation, I can add:\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Press any key to continue.\");\n\nConsole.ReadKey();\n\nThis will give the user a chance to see the result before the menu is displayed again.\n\nI'll add this at the end of each menu option.\n\nFinally, I should test the program to ensure that all functionalities work as expected, including edge cases like entering zero or negative amounts, exceeding the withdrawal limit, and insufficient funds.\n\nLet me summarize the final structure of the program:\n\n- Define constants for PIN, initial balance, and daily withdrawal limit.\n\n- Define methods for validating PIN, checking balance, depositing, withdrawing, and the main loop.\n\n- In the Main method, validate the PIN; if correct, enter the main loop where the menu is displayed and user choices are handled.\n\n- Use ref parameters for balance and totalWithdrawalsToday in deposit and withdraw methods to modify their values.\n\n- Format currency outputs to two decimal places.\n\n- Add checks for positive amounts in deposit and withdraw methods.\n\n- Optionally, add pauses after each operation to allow the user to see the results.\n\nThis should cover all the requirements mentioned.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple ATM simulation in C#, we need to allow users to check their balance, deposit money, withdraw money, and exit the program. We must ensure that users enter a valid PIN before accessing their account, that withdrawal amounts do not exceed the available balance, and that a daily withdrawal limit is enforced.\n\n### Approach\n1. **PIN Validation:** A hardcoded PIN for simplicity (in a real scenario, this should be handled securely).\n2. **Balance and Limits:** Use `decimal` for monetary values to maintain precision.\n3. **Menu Driven:** A loop presenting options to check balance, deposit, withdraw, or exit.\n4. **Input Handling:** Validate user inputs to handle non-numeric values and invalid choices.\n5. **Transaction Limits:** Enforce daily withdrawal limits and check for sufficient balance.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    // Constants\n    private const string CORRECT_PIN = \"1234\";\n    private const decimal INITIAL_BALANCE = 1000.00m;\n    private const decimal DAILY_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT = 500.00m;\n\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        if (!ValidatePin())\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Invalid PIN.
