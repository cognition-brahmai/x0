        "content": "So the store is offering a 15% discount on a product that originally costs $120. I need to find out what the new price is after the discount. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a 15% discount means. Percentages can be a bit tricky, but I think I've got it. A 15% discount means that the store is taking off 15% of the original price from the total amount I have to pay. So, I need to calculate what 15% of $120 is and then subtract that from $120 to get the discounted price.\n\nLet me try to calculate 15% of $120. I know that percentages can be converted into decimals for easier calculation. So, 15% as a decimal is 0.15. Now, I multiply 0.15 by 120 to find out how much the discount is.\n\n0.15 \u00d7 120 = ?\n\nLet me do the multiplication. 0.15 times 100 is 15, and 0.15 times 20 is 3. So, 15 + 3 equals 18. Therefore, the discount amount is $18.\n\nNow, I need to subtract that $18 from the original price of $120 to get the new price.\n\n120 - 18 = 102\n\nSo, the new discounted price should be $102.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe instead of calculating the discount and then subtracting it, I can find out what percentage of the original price I actually have to pay after the discount.\n\nIf there's a 15% discount, that means I'm paying 100% - 15% = 85% of the original price. So, maybe I can calculate 85% of $120 directly.\n\nLet me try that. 85% as a decimal is 0.85. Now, multiply 0.85 by 120.\n\n0.85 \u00d7 120 = ?\n\n0.85 times 100 is 85, and 0.85 times 20 is 17. So, 85 + 17 equals 102.\n\nAgain, I get $102 as the discounted price. That's good, both methods give me the same answer, so I can be confident that $102 is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's try another approach. Maybe using fractions. I know that 15% is the same as 15/100, which simplifies to 3/20.\n\nSo, the discount is 3/20 of $120. Let's calculate that.\n\n3/20 \u00d7 120 = (3 \u00d7 120) / 20 = 360 / 20 = 18\n\nAgain, the discount is $18, and subtracting that from $120 gives $102.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the remaining amount I have to pay, which is 85%, that's 85/100 or 17/20.\n\nSo, 17/20 of $120 is (17 \u00d7 120) / 20 = 2040 / 20 = 102\n\nOnce more, I arrive at $102.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough. The new discounted price is $102.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let's consider if the discount was higher or lower. If the discount was 50%, the price would be $60, which makes sense because half of $120 is $60. But here, the discount is only 15%, which is a lot less, so the price should be closer to the original, which $102 is.\n\nAlso, if I check the percentage discount: $18 is what percentage of $120? Let's see, 18/120 = 0.15, which is 15%, which matches the given discount.\n\nSo, everything checks out. The new price after a 15% discount on a $120 product is $102.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{102} \\]"
