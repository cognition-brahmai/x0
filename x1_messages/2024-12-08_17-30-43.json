        "content": "I believe you're referring to Tango, a dance style that originated in the late 19th century along the R\u00edo de la Plata, which forms the natural border between Argentina and Uruguay. However, it's widely recognized as an Argentine dance. Tango is known for its dramatic poses, complex footwork, and close embrace between partners. It has since spread worldwide and evolved into various styles, but its passionate and emotional expression remains a central characteristic."
