        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A factory produces 250 units of product A and 350 units of product B every day. Each unit of product A needs 2 hours of labor, and each unit of product B needs 3 hours of labor. I need to find out how many total hours of labor the factory requires for production in a week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the daily labor hours for each product and then sum them up for a week.\n\nLet me start with product A. They produce 250 units daily, and each unit requires 2 hours of labor. So, the daily labor for product A is:\n\n250 units * 2 hours/unit = 500 hours per day.\n\nSimilarly, for product B, they produce 350 units daily, and each unit requires 3 hours of labor. So, the daily labor for product B is:\n\n350 units * 3 hours/unit = 1050 hours per day.\n\nNow, the total daily labor for both products is:\n\n500 hours (A) + 1050 hours (B) = 1550 hours per day.\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, the total weekly labor hours would be:\n\n1550 hours/day * 7 days/week = 10,850 hours per week.\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot of labor hours. Maybe I should double-check my calculations.\n\nLet me recalculate for product A:\n\n250 units * 2 hours/unit = 500 hours per day. That seems correct.\n\nFor product B:\n\n350 units * 3 hours/unit = 1050 hours per day. That also seems correct.\n\nTotal daily labor:\n\n500 + 1050 = 1550 hours per day. Alright.\n\nNow, for a week:\n\n1550 hours/day * 7 days = 10,850 hours per week.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider if the factory operates every day of the week. The problem doesn't specify any days off, so I'll assume it operates 7 days a week.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory has different shifts or something, but the problem doesn't mention that, so I'll stick with the straightforward calculation.\n\nSo, the factory requires 10,850 hours of labor per week for production.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10850} \\]"
