        "content": "So the train goes from Station A to Station B, which are 180 miles apart, and it takes 3 hours to do that. I need to find out the average speed of the train during this trip. Okay, average speed is usually calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken. So, in this case, it would be 180 miles divided by 3 hours. Let me do the math: 180 divided by 3 equals 60. So, the average speed is 60 miles per hour. But wait, is there anything else I need to consider here? The problem says the train travels at a constant speed, so that means the speed doesn't change during the journey. Therefore, the average speed should be the same as the constant speed. So, 60 miles per hour is the answer. I think that makes sense."
