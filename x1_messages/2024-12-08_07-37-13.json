        "content": "So I've got this problem: \"In how many ways can you distribute 12 identical apples among three different baskets?\" Hmm, this seems like a problem about combinations and permutations, but since the apples are identical, the order doesn't matter, right? So, it's more about combinations.\n\nLet me think about this. If the apples were distinct, then the number of ways would be different, but since they're identical, it's about how many ways to partition the number 12 into three parts, where each part represents the number of apples in each basket.\n\nWait, but baskets are different, so the order does matter in that sense. For example, putting 5 apples in basket A, 4 in B, and 3 in C is different from putting 3 in A, 4 in B, and 5 in C, even though the numbers are the same.\n\nBut since the apples are identical, the only thing that matters is how many go into each basket, not which specific apples go where.\n\nSo, this sounds like a \"stars and bars\" problem. I think I've heard about that in combinatorics. The formula for distributing n identical items into k distinct bins is C(n + k - 1, k - 1), where C is the combination function.\n\nLet me check that. Here, n = 12 apples, and k = 3 baskets. So, it should be C(12 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(14, 2).\n\nWait, but that seems too small. Let me make sure I'm remembering the formula correctly. Yeah, the formula is C(n + k - 1, k - 1) or equivalently C(n + k - 1, n).\n\nSo, in this case, C(12 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(14, 2). Let's calculate that. C(14, 2) is (14 * 13) / (2 * 1) = 91.\n\nSo, there are 91 ways to distribute 12 identical apples among three different baskets.\n\nBut, I'm a bit unsure because maybe some constraints are missing. For example, can baskets be empty? If baskets cannot be empty, meaning each basket must have at least one apple, then the formula changes slightly.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify that baskets can't be empty, so empty baskets are allowed. So, my initial calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if baskets couldn't be empty, then each basket must have at least one apple, so we can first put one apple in each basket, and then distribute the remaining apples freely.\n\nSo, if baskets cannot be empty, then we'd have 12 - 3 = 9 apples left to distribute freely among 3 baskets, with each basket possibly getting zero additional apples.\n\nSo, that would be C(9 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(11, 2) = 55 ways.\n\nBut since the problem allows for empty baskets, the correct answer should be 91.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a smaller example to make sure I understand.\n\nSuppose I have 3 apples and 2 baskets. According to the formula, it should be C(3 + 2 - 1, 2 - 1) = C(4, 1) = 4 ways.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. All 3 apples in basket A, 0 in basket B.\n\n2. 2 apples in basket A, 1 in basket B.\n\n3. 1 apple in basket A, 2 in basket B.\n\n4. 0 apples in basket A, 3 in basket B.\n\nYes, that's 4 ways, which matches the formula.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to the original problem, C(14, 2) = 91 seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to consider the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation x + y + z = 12, where x, y, z represent the number of apples in each of the three baskets.\n\nAnd the formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to x1 + x2 + ... + xk = n is C(n + k - 1, k - 1), which again gives C(12 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(14, 2) = 91.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 91 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{91} \\]"
