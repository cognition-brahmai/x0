        "content": "So the factory makes widgets at a rate of 60 widgets per hour, and it takes 3 hours to produce enough widgets to fill one shipping container. I need to find out how many widgets fit into one shipping container.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. If the factory produces 60 widgets every hour, and it works for 3 hours to fill a container, I can probably find the total number of widgets by multiplying the rate by the time.\n\nSo, widgets per hour times number of hours should give me the total widgets per container. That is, 60 widgets/hour times 3 hours.\n\nLet me do the math: 60 times 3 is 180.\n\nSo, one shipping container fits 180 widgets.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider here? Like, maybe the factory's production rate changes or something, but the problem says it's a constant rate of 60 widgets per hour.\n\nAlso, it says \"it takes 3 hours to produce enough widgets to fill one shipping container,\" which seems straightforward. So, in 3 hours, producing at 60 widgets per hour, that should be 180 widgets.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using rates or something, but it seems pretty simple.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of rates. The production rate is 60 widgets per hour, and time is 3 hours, so the total production is rate multiplied by time, which is again 180 widgets.\n\nIs there any chance that the shipping container capacity might be different based on the type of widgets or something? The problem doesn't specify any variations, so I'll assume that all widgets are the same and the container capacity is consistent.\n\nAlso, perhaps there's a need to consider if there's any waste or defects in production, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I'll assume all produced widgets are good and fit into the container.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial calculation, 60 widgets per hour times 3 hours equals 180 widgets per container.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]"
