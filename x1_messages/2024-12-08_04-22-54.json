        "content": "Let's see. There are 400 students in total at this school. Now, 60% of them play soccer, and 30% play basketball. Additionally, 20% of the students don't play either sport. I need to find out how many students play both soccer and basketball.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many students play soccer and how many play basketball.\n\nSo, 60% of 400 students play soccer. Let me calculate that:\n\n60% of 400 is 0.6 times 400, which is 240 students.\n\nSimilarly, 30% of 400 students play basketball:\n\n30% of 400 is 0.3 times 400, which is 120 students.\n\nNow, 20% of the students don't play either sport. So, that means 80% do play at least one of the sports, right? Because 100% minus 20% is 80%.\n\nSo, 80% of 400 students play at least soccer or basketball:\n\n80% of 400 is 0.8 times 400, which is 320 students.\n\nWait a minute, so 320 students play at least one sport, but we have 240 playing soccer and 120 playing basketball. If I add those up, that's 240 plus 120, which is 360. But according to the previous calculation, only 320 students play at least one sport. So, there's an overlap here.\n\nThat overlap is the number of students who play both soccer and basketball. Because if someone plays both, they are counted in both the soccer and basketball groups.\n\nSo, if I add the number of soccer and basketball players, that's 240 plus 120 equals 360, but only 320 students play at least one sport. So, the difference between these two numbers should be the number of students who are counted twice because they play both sports.\n\nSo, 360 minus 320 equals 40 students.\n\nTherefore, 40 students play both soccer and basketball.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nTotal students playing at least one sport is 320.\n\nNumber playing soccer is 240.\n\nNumber playing basketball is 120.\n\nBut 240 plus 120 is 360, which is 40 more than 320.\n\nSo, yes, those 40 extra students are the ones who are counted in both groups because they play both sports.\n\nSo, the number of students who play both soccer and basketball is 40.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
