        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a bag with balls of different colors: 4 red, 6 blue, and 10 green. I need to find the probability of picking either a red or a blue ball at random. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the basic formula for probability: the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue ball.\n\nSo, the number of red balls is 4, and the number of blue balls is 6. So, the total number of favorable outcomes should be 4 plus 6, which is 10.\n\nNow, what's the total number of possible outcomes? That's the total number of balls in the bag. There are 4 red, 6 blue, and 10 green, so 4 + 6 + 10 equals 20 balls in total.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 10 divided by 20. That simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using the addition rule for probabilities. Since I'm dealing with two separate events\u2014picking a red ball or picking a blue ball\u2014and these are mutually exclusive events (you can't pick a ball that's both red and blue at the same time), maybe I can add their individual probabilities.\n\nLet's try that. The probability of picking a red ball is 4/20, which simplifies to 1/5. The probability of picking a blue ball is 6/20, which simplifies to 3/10. Now, if I add these probabilities together: 1/5 plus 3/10.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. 1/5 is equivalent to 2/10, so 2/10 plus 3/10 equals 5/10, which simplifies to 1/2. So, I get the same answer as before.\n\nThat's good; it's consistent. So, the probability of picking either a red or a blue ball is 1/2.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can check this another way. Let's consider the probability of not picking a green ball, since the only other options are red and blue.\n\nThe number of green balls is 10, and the total number of balls is 20, so the probability of picking a green ball is 10/20, which is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not picking a green ball\u2014that is, picking either red or blue\u2014is 1 minus 1/2, which is also 1/2.\n\nAgain, the same answer. So, no matter which method I use, I end up with the same probability.\n\nIt seems like 1/2 is the correct answer. I've verified it through three different approaches: directly calculating the ratio of favorable to total outcomes, adding the individual probabilities of each favorable outcome, and using the complement rule by subtracting the probability of the unwanted outcome from 1.\n\nI think that's solid. There doesn't seem to be any mistake in these calculations.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the probability. For example, is the picking done with replacement or without? In this problem, it says \"pick one ball from the bag without looking,\" and since it's just one ball, replacement isn't an issue.\n\nAlso, the problem doesn't mention anything about the balls being identical or different in size or weight, which might affect the probability. But since it's specified that they're just colored differently, and we're picking randomly, I think it's safe to assume that each ball has an equal chance of being picked.\n\nSo, no, I don't think there are any hidden variables here. The answer should be straightforward.\n\nJust for kicks, let's imagine that there are different weights or sizes, but the problem doesn't specify that, so we can't consider it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick in the wording, like \"without looking,\" but that's standard language in probability problems to indicate randomness.\n\nNo, I think it's clear: 4 red, 6 blue, 10 green, total of 20 balls, picking one at random, probability of it being red or blue.\n\nCalculations confirm it's 10 favorable outcomes out of 20 possible, which is 1/2.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
