        "content": "In triangle ABC, we're given that angle A is 35 degrees, angle B is 75 degrees, and side AB is 10 units long. We need to find the length of side AC.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is 180 degrees. So, we can find angle C by subtracting the sum of angles A and B from 180 degrees.\n\nAngle C = 180 - angle A - angle B\nAngle C = 180 - 35 - 75\nAngle C = 70 degrees\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Sines to find the length of side AC. The Law of Sines states that in any triangle, the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of the opposite angle is the same for all three sides.\n\nSo, for sides AB, BC, and AC, and their opposite angles C, A, and B respectively, we have:\n\nAB / sin C = BC / sin A = AC / sin B\n\nWe are interested in finding AC, and we know AB, angle A, angle B, and angle C.\n\nLet's set up the ratio using AB and angle C, and AC and angle B:\n\nAB / sin C = AC / sin B\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n10 / sin 70 = AC / sin 75\n\nNow, we can solve for AC by cross-multiplying:\n\nAC = (10 * sin 75) / sin 70\n\nLet's calculate the values of sin 75 and sin 70.\n\nSin 75 is approximately 0.9659\nSin 70 is approximately 0.9397\n\nNow, plug these values into the equation:\n\nAC = (10 * 0.9659) / 0.9397\nAC = 9.659 / 0.9397\nAC \u2248 10.28 units\n\nTherefore, the length of side AC is approximately 10.28 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10.28} \\]"
