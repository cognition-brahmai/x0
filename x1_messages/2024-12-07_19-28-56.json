        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: a factory produces 500 units of product A every 8 hours and 300 units of product B every 6 hours. I need to find out how many units of both products are produced in 24 hours. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much of each product is produced per hour, and then multiply that by 24 to get the total production for both products in 24 hours. That sounds like a plan.\n\nStarting with product A: it produces 500 units every 8 hours. So, to find the hourly production rate for product A, I can divide 500 by 8.\n\n500 \u00f7 8 = 62.5 units per hour.\n\nOkay, so product A produces 62.5 units each hour.\n\nNow, for product B: it produces 300 units every 6 hours. So, the hourly production rate for product B would be 300 divided by 6.\n\n300 \u00f7 6 = 50 units per hour.\n\nAlright, product B produces 50 units each hour.\n\nNow, to find out how much of each product is produced in 24 hours, I can multiply their respective hourly production rates by 24.\n\nFor product A: 62.5 units/hour \u00d7 24 hours = 1500 units.\n\nFor product B: 50 units/hour \u00d7 24 hours = 1200 units.\n\nNow, to find the total units of both products produced in 24 hours, I can add these two amounts together.\n\n1500 + 1200 = 2700 units.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe without calculating the hourly production rates?\n\nLet me think. The factory produces 500 units of A every 8 hours. In 24 hours, there are three 8-hour periods, so 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500 units of A.\n\nSimilarly, for product B, it produces 300 units every 6 hours. In 24 hours, there are four 6-hour periods, so 300 \u00d7 4 = 1200 units of B.\n\nAgain, adding them up: 1500 + 1200 = 2700 units.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like the total production of both products in 24 hours is 2700 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2700} \\]"
