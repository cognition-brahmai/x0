        "content": "Let's see. There's a class of 30 students, and 60% of them are boys. So, first I need to find out how many boys there are. \n\n60% of 30 is calculated by 0.60 times 30, which is 18. So, there are 18 boys in the class.\n\nNow, the rest of the students are girls. So, 30 minus 18 equals 12 girls.\n\nNext, it says that 40% of the boys have brown eyes. So, I need to find 40% of 18.\n\n40% of 18 is 0.40 times 18, which is 7.2. But since we can't have a fraction of a student, I'll round it to the nearest whole number, which is 7 boys with brown eyes.\n\nThen, 50% of the girls have brown eyes. So, 50% of 12 is 0.50 times 12, which is 6 girls with brown eyes.\n\nNow, to find the total number of students with brown eyes, I'll add the number of boys with brown eyes and the number of girls with brown eyes.\n\nThat's 7 plus 6, which equals 13.\n\nSo, there are 13 students in total with brown eyes.\n\nWait a minute, but when I calculated 40% of 18, I got 7.2, and I rounded it to 7. Maybe I should consider that 7.2 means 7 boys have brown eyes, since you can't have a partial student.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that 7.2 means 7 boys have brown eyes and part of another student, but since we can't have partial students, it's reasonable to round to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, the total remains 13 students with brown eyes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
