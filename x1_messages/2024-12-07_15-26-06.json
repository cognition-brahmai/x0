Writing a Go program to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion is a great way to understand both Go programming and recursion concepts. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, what is a factorial? Factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It's denoted by n!. For example, 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nRecursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In programming, this means a function calling itself with a simpler version of the original problem, until it reaches a base case that can be solved directly.\n\nSo, for factorial, the recursive definition is:\n\n- Base case: If n is 0 or 1, then factorial is 1.\n\n- Recursive case: If n > 1, then factorial is n multiplied by the factorial of (n-1).\n\nIn Go, you can define a function that calls itself to achieve this.\n\nBut before we dive into the code, let's think about how the program will flow:\n\n1. Prompt the user to enter a number.\n\n2. Read the input from the user.\n\n3. Check if the input is a non-negative integer.\n\n4. If it is, calculate the factorial using recursion.\n\n5. Print the result.\n\n6. If it's not a non-negative integer, handle the error appropriately.\n\nNow, let's consider the Go language features we'll use:\n\n- For user input, we'll use the \"fmt\" package, which provides functions for formatted I/O.\n\n- For recursion, we'll define a function that calls itself.\n\n- We'll also handle potential errors, like if the user enters a negative number or non-integer values.\n\nLet's sketch a rough structure of the program:\n\n- Import necessary packages.\n\n- Define a recursive function to calculate factorial.\n\n- In the main function, prompt the user for input.\n\n- Read the input and convert it to an integer.\n\n- Check if the input is valid and non-negative.\n\n- If valid, call the recursive factorial function and print the result.\n\n- If invalid, print an error message.\n\nNow, let's think about the recursive function.\n\nFunction name: factorial\n\nParameters: an integer n\n\nReturns: an integer (the factorial of n)\n\nBase case: if n is 0 or 1, return 1\n\nRecursive case: return n * factorial(n-1)\n\nBut wait, in Go, functions can be declared after they are called, as long as the function signatures are known. So, we can define the factorial function before the main function.\n\nAlso, in Go, recursion needs to be handled carefully because Go doesn't optimize tail recursion. So, for very large inputs, this might lead to stack overflows. But for the sake of this example, we'll assume the input is reasonable.\n\nNow, for reading user input:\n\n- Use fmt.Println to prompt the user.\n\n- Use fmt.Scanln to read the input.\n\n- Convert the input to an integer using strconv.Atoi or similar.\n\n- Handle any errors that might occur during conversion.\n\nLet's consider how to handle invalid inputs:\n\n- If the input is not an integer, print an error message.\n\n- If the input is negative, print an error message.\n\n- If the input is too large (factorial grows very fast), you might face integer overflow, but for simplicity, we'll assume the input is within the range of int64.\n\nIn Go, integers can be of different sizes, like int8, int16, int32, int64. Factorial of numbers beyond 20 will exceed int64, but again, for simplicity, we'll use int64.\n\nWait, but in Go, the default integer type is int, which is implementation-defined (usually 32-bit or 64-bit depending on the architecture). To be safe, we'll use uint64 for factorial calculations since factorials are always positive.\n\nBut actually, even uint64 won't suffice for large factorials. For example, 21! is already larger than uint64 can hold. So, perhaps it's better to use math/big's Binomial function or something similar, but that might be overkill for this simple program.\n\nAlternatively, we can limit the input to a reasonable size, say up to 20, and use uint64.\n\nLet's proceed with uint64 and limit the input to 20.\n\nSo, in the main function:\n\n- Print \"Enter a non-negative integer: \"\n\n- Read the input using fmt.Scanln\n\n- Convert the input to uint64\n\n- Check if the input is within 0 to 20\n\n- If yes, call factorial function and print the result\n\n- If no, print an error message\n\nWait, but uint64 can't hold negative numbers, so we don't need to check for negativity if we've already ensured it's a valid uint64. But since we're reading from user input, we need to handle both invalid format and out-of-range errors.\n\nPerhaps it's better to read the input as a string, parse it as an integer, and handle any errors that occur during parsing.\n\nAlso, in Go, it's idiomatic to handle errors using if statements with the error variable.\n\nLet's think about the steps in code:\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\n\"fmt\"\n\n\"strconv\"\n\n)\n\nfunc factorial(n uint64) uint64 {\n\nif n == 0 || n == 1 {\n\nreturn 1\n\n}\n\nreturn n * factorial(n-1)\n\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\nfmt.Println(\"Enter a non-negative integer: \")\n\nvar input string\n\nfmt.Scanln(&input)\n\nn, err := strconv.ParseUint(input, 10, 64)\n\nif err != nil {\n\nfmt.Println(\"Error: Invalid input. Please enter a non-negative integer.\")\n\nreturn\n\n}\n\nif n > 20 {\n\nfmt.Println(\"Error: Input too large. Please enter a number between 0 and 20.\")\n\nreturn\n\n}\n\nresult := factorial(n)\n\nfmt.Printf(\"Factorial of %d is %d\\n\", n, result)\n\n}\n\nThis seems straightforward. Let's consider some edge cases:\n\n- Input: 0 \u2192 Factorial: 1\n\n- Input: 1 \u2192 Factorial: 1\n\n- Input: 5 \u2192 Factorial: 120\n\n- Input: 20 \u2192 Factorial: 2432902008176640000\n\n- Input: -1 \u2192 Error\n\n- Input: 21 \u2192 Error\n\n- Input: abc \u2192 Error\n\nAlso, in Go, recursion has a stack limit. The default stack size is 2MB, which should be sufficient for small inputs like up to 20. But for larger inputs, you might hit a stack overflow.\n\nTo handle larger factorials, you could use iteration instead of recursion, or increase the stack size, but that's beyond the scope of this program.\n\nAlternatively, you could use the math/big package to handle big integers, but again, for simplicity, we'll stick with uint64.\n\nLet's also consider if there's a way to optimize this, but since recursion is required, we'll keep it as is.\n\nNow, let's think about how to compile and run this program.\n\nAssuming you have Go installed, you can save this code to a file, say factorial.go, and run:\n\ngo run factorial.go\n\nOr build it into an executable:\n\ngo build factorial.go\n\nThen run the executable.\n\nIn the program, we're using fmt.Scanln to read input. On some systems, especially Windows, Scanln might behave differently with newline characters, but for simplicity, we'll assume it works as expected.\n\nAlternatively, you can use bufio package for more robust input reading.\n\nBut for this example, fmt.Scanln should suffice.\n\nLet me also consider if there's a way to make this program more user-friendly, like allowing multiple inputs or handling interrupts gracefully.\n\nBut for a simple program, the above should be adequate.\n\nOne more thing: in Go, it's good practice to handle all possible errors. So, in the main function, we're checking if the parsing fails and printing an error message.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the input is within the range that uint64 can handle.\n\nAlright, I think this covers the requirements. Let's summarize:\n\n- We've defined a recursive function to calculate factorial.\n\n- We've handled user input and potential errors.\n\n- We've limited the input to a reasonable range to avoid integer overflow.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"
