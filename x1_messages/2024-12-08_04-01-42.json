Each plan will be followed by an evidence value, which is the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be either the user's question, one or more previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nBing[input]: A tool that allows users to search for information using the Bing search engine. This tool helps in finding relevant sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nWebReader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkPicker[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nSAM[input]: Question answering language model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2019 and what was their most famous work?"
