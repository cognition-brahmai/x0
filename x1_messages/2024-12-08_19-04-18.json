        "content": "So there are 12 people in a room, and everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes take place in total, and also how many handshakes Alice makes.\n\nFirst, let's think about the total number of handshakes. If there are 12 people, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, we can think of this as finding the number of unique pairs of people, since each handshake is between two people.\n\nIn mathematics, the number of ways to choose 2 items out of n without regard to order is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, 2) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nHere, n is 12, so plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 66 handshakes in total.\n\nNow, for Alice. Alice shakes hands with everyone else in the room exactly once. Since there are 12 people in total, including Alice, that means there are 11 other people. Therefore, Alice makes 11 handshakes.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. If there are 12 people, and each shakes hands with 11 others, that would suggest a total of 12 \u00d7 11 = 132 handshakes. But we already calculated that the total number of handshakes is 66. So, what's going on here?\n\nAh, I see. The issue is that in this approach, each handshake is being counted twice \u2013 once for each participant. So, to get the actual number of unique handshakes, we need to divide by 2. That's why the combination formula divides by 2.\n\nSo, in the total handshakes calculation, it's correct to use C(12, 2) = 66.\n\nFor Alice, since she shakes hands with each of the other 11 people exactly once, she indeed makes 11 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as Alice shaking hands with 11 people, and then the remaining 10 people shaking hands among themselves. The number of handshakes among the remaining 10 people would be C(10, 2) = 45. Adding Alice's 11 handshakes, we get 11 + 45 = 56, but that's not matching our earlier total of 66. Hmm, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's try to approach it differently.\n\nIf there are 12 people, and each shakes hands with 11 others, that's 12 \u00d7 11 = 132 handshakes, but since each handshake involves two people, we've double-counted each handshake. Therefore, the actual number of unique handshakes is 132 / 2 = 66, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, Alice makes 11 handshakes, and the total number is 66.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list out the handshakes. But with 12 people, that would be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it sequentially. The first person shakes hands with 11 others. The second person has already shaken hands with the first, so they shake hands with 10 remaining people. The third has already shaken hands with the first two, so they shake hands with 9 remaining people, and so on, down to the last two people who shake hands with each other.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be:\n\n11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 66\n\nWhich again confirms our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes is 66, and Alice makes 11 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{66 \\text{ total handshakes, Alice makes 11 handshakes}} \\]"
