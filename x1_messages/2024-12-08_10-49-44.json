        "content": "So the hospital wants to expand its emergency department to accommodate more patients. Currently, there are 20 beds serving an average of 60 patients per day, and they want to increase their capacity by 50%. First, I need to figure out what that means in terms of additional beds and space required, and also estimate the number of extra staff members needed to maintain a 1:4 nurse-to-patient ratio during peak hours.\n\nLet me start by understanding the current setup. There are 20 beds for 60 patients per day. That seems a bit confusing because beds are usually for patients who need to stay, but in an emergency department, patients might come and go more quickly. But for the purpose of this problem, I'll assume that the number of beds corresponds to the number of patients that can be treated at any given time.\n\nThey want to increase their capacity by 50%. So, if they currently serve 60 patients per day, increasing by 50% would mean serving an additional 30 patients per day, bringing the total to 90 patients per day.\n\nNow, to find out how many additional beds are needed, I need to determine the relationship between the number of beds and the number of patients served per day. Assuming that each bed can handle a certain number of patients per day, based on how long patients stay in the bed.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the average length of stay per patient, so maybe I need to look at it differently. Perhaps the number of beds determines the maximum number of patients that can be treated simultaneously, and the daily patient volume is based on how many times beds are turnover throughout the day.\n\nI recall that in hospitals, the bed turnover ratio or bed turnover rate is important. It indicates how many patients are treated in a bed over a specific period, usually a day.\n\nLet's assume that each bed is used a certain number of times a day. If there are 20 beds and they serve 60 patients per day, then on average, each bed is used 60 divided by 20, which is 3 times per day.\n\nSo, each bed handles 3 patients per day. If they want to increase their capacity by 50%, meaning they want to serve 90 patients per day, then with the same bed turnover rate of 3 patients per bed per day, they would need 90 divided by 3, which is 30 beds.\n\nCurrently, they have 20 beds, so they need an additional 10 beds.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. If each bed handles 3 patients per day, and they have 20 beds, that's 20 times 3, which is 60 patients per day, matching the current situation. If they want to serve 90 patients per day with the same turnover rate of 3 patients per bed per day, then they would need 90 divided by 3, which is indeed 30 beds. So, additional beds required would be 30 minus 20, which is 10 beds.\n\nNow, estimating the space needed for the expansion: each bed requires 150 square feet of space, including equipment and walking areas. So, for 10 additional beds, the space required would be 10 times 150, which is 1,500 square feet.\n\nNext, calculating the number of extra staff members needed to maintain a 1:4 nurse-to-patient ratio during peak hours. First, I need to understand what \"peak hours\" means. The problem doesn't specify, so I might need to make an assumption here.\n\nLet's assume that peak hours are the times when the emergency department is at its maximum capacity, which would be when all 30 beds are in use.\n\nSo, with 30 beds, and a 1:4 nurse-to-patient ratio, meaning one nurse for every four patients.\n\nWait, but in hospital settings, nurse-to-patient ratios are often specified per shift or per working hour. I need to clarify what is meant by \"during peak hours.\"\n\nIf the peak hours are, say, 8 hours a day, and during that time, the department is at full capacity, then the number of nurses needed during those peak hours would be based on the number of patients present at any given time.\n\nBut the ratio is 1:4, which seems low for a hospital setting. In many hospitals, especially in emergency departments, the ratio is higher, meaning fewer patients per nurse, to ensure adequate care.\n\nWait, maybe I need to verify that. A 1:4 ratio would mean one nurse for every four patients, which might be appropriate depending on the acuity of the patients.\n\nFor the sake of this problem, I'll proceed with the given ratio of 1:4.\n\nSo, if there are 30 beds, and assuming all are full during peak hours, then the number of nurses needed would be 30 divided by 4, which is 7.5. Since you can't have half a nurse, you would need to round up to 8 nurses during peak hours.\n\nNow, to find out the number of extra staff members needed, I need to know how many nurses are currently staffed during peak hours.\n\nAssuming that currently, with 20 beds, and the same 1:4 ratio, they would need 20 divided by 4, which is 5 nurses during peak hours.\n\nTherefore, the additional nurses needed would be 8 minus 5, which is 3 nurses.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Additional beds required: 10 beds\n\n- Space needed for expansion: 1,500 square feet\n\n- Extra staff members (nurses) needed: 3 nurses\n\nWait, but perhaps I should consider that nurses might work in shifts, and the total number needed per day would depend on the number of shifts.\n\nBut the problem seems to be focusing on the number of extra staff members needed during peak hours, so maybe we can stick with the 3 additional nurses.\n\nHowever, it might be more realistic to consider that nurses work in shifts, and the hospital would need to ensure adequate staffing across all shifts.\n\nBut based on the information provided, I'll stick with the 3 additional nurses needed during peak hours.\n\nLet me just double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, current capacity: 20 beds, 60 patients per day.\n\nIncrease capacity by 50%: 60 plus 30 equals 90 patients per day.\n\nAssuming each bed handles 3 patients per day (60 divided by 20), then for 90 patients per day, needed beds would be 90 divided by 3, which is 30 beds.\n\nTherefore, additional beds required: 30 minus 20 equals 10 beds.\n\nSpace required: 10 beds times 150 square feet per bed equals 1,500 square feet.\n\nNurses needed during peak hours:\n\n- Current: 20 beds / 4 = 5 nurses\n\n- Expanded: 30 beds / 4 = 7.5, round up to 8 nurses\n\n- Additional nurses needed: 8 minus 5 equals 3 nurses\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think this is a reasonable estimate based on the information provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ additional beds},\\ 1,500 \\text{ square feet},\\ 3 \\text{ additional nurses}} \\]"
