        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about an election. Candidate A got 55% of the total votes cast, and candidate B got 35%. The total number of votes cast was 12,000. I need to find out how many more votes candidate A received compared to candidate B.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how many votes each candidate received. Since candidate A got 55% of the total votes, I can calculate that by taking 55% of 12,000. Similarly, for candidate B, it's 35% of 12,000. Then, I can subtract the number of votes candidate B received from the number of votes candidate A received to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by calculating the votes for candidate A. 55% of 12,000 is:\n\n(55/100) * 12,000\n\nI can simplify that:\n\n55 * 12,000 / 100\n\nWell, 12,000 divided by 100 is 120, so:\n\n55 * 120 = 6,600\n\nSo, candidate A received 6,600 votes.\n\nNow, for candidate B, who got 35% of the total votes:\n\n(35/100) * 12,000\n\nSimilarly:\n\n35 * 12,000 / 100\n\nAgain, 12,000 divided by 100 is 120, so:\n\n35 * 120 = 4,200\n\nTherefore, candidate B received 4,200 votes.\n\nNow, to find out how many more votes candidate A received than candidate B, I subtract the votes for B from the votes for A:\n\n6,600 - 4,200 = 2,400\n\nSo, candidate A received 2,400 more votes than candidate B.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can find the percentage difference first and then apply it to the total votes.\n\nLet me think: candidate A has 55% and candidate B has 35%, so the difference in percentage is 55% - 35% = 20%.\n\nThen, 20% of the total votes would be:\n\n(20/100) * 12,000 = 0.2 * 12,000 = 2,400\n\nThat matches the earlier result. So, regardless of the method, the difference is 2,400 votes.\n\nIt's good to cross-verify like this to ensure accuracy.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total votes and how they are distributed. But I think the method I used is straightforward and accurate.\n\nSo, the final answer is that candidate A received 2,400 more votes than candidate B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2400} \\]"
