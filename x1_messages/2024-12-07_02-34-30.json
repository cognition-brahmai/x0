        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about two trains moving towards each other. One leaves from station A going at 60 mph, and the other leaves from station B at 40 mph. The distance between A and B is 200 miles. I need to find out how far the faster train travels before they meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's happening here. Both trains are moving towards each other, so their speeds add up when calculating how quickly they'll meet. So, the combined speed is 60 mph plus 40 mph, which is 100 mph. That means they're closing the distance between them at a rate of 100 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the distance between them is 200 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, Time = 200 miles / 100 mph = 2 hours.\n\nThat means they'll meet after 2 hours.\n\nNow, I need to find out how far the faster train has traveled in that time. The faster train is the one from station A, going at 60 mph.\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, Distance = 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nTherefore, the faster train will have traveled 120 miles before they meet.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this to confirm? Maybe using relative speed or something like that.\n\nLet's try it again. If I consider the faster train's speed relative to the slower one, it's 60 mph minus 40 mph, which is 20 mph. But that doesn't seem right for this scenario because they're moving towards each other. Oh, no, that would be if they were moving in the same direction.\n\nActually, my first approach seems correct. Their speeds add up when they're moving towards each other.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up equations for the positions of both trains as functions of time and set them equal to find when they meet.\n\nLet's denote the position of train A as \\( p_A(t) = 60t \\) miles from A, and the position of train B as \\( p_B(t) = 200 - 40t \\) miles from A, since it's moving towards A.\n\nSetting \\( p_A(t) = p_B(t) \\):\n\n60t = 200 - 40t\n\nNow, solve for t:\n\n60t + 40t = 200\n\n100t = 200\n\nt = 2 hours\n\nThen, distance traveled by train A is 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nYeah, that matches my first answer.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using proportions or something.\n\nHmm. The speeds are in the ratio of 60:40, which simplifies to 3:2. So, the distances they travel should also be in the ratio of their speeds because they travel for the same amount of time.\n\nSo, if the total distance is 200 miles, and the distances are in the ratio 3:2, then the faster train travels (3/5) of 200 miles.\n\nLet's calculate that: (3/5) \u00d7 200 = 120 miles.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, no matter how I approach it, I keep getting 120 miles.\n\nMaybe I can graph this to visualize it.\n\nIf I plot time on the x-axis and distance on the y-axis, train A's distance from A would be y = 60x, and train B's distance from A would be y = 200 - 40x.\n\nThey meet when 60x = 200 - 40x, which again gives x = 2 hours, and y = 120 miles.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how the distance between them decreases over time. It starts at 200 miles and decreases at 100 mph, so it takes 2 hours to reach zero distance.\n\nThen, in 2 hours, train A travels 120 miles.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways. I'm confident that the answer is 120 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
