For a picnic, it's important to choose dishes that are easy to transport, don't require much preparation on site, and can handle being outdoors for a few hours. Also, variety in flavors is key to keeping everyone satisfied. Here\u2019s a menu that ticks all those boxes:\n\n1. **Caprese Salad Skewers**:\n   - These are easy to make ahead of time. Thread cherry tomatoes, fresh mozzarella balls, and basil leaves onto skewers. Drizzle with balsamic glaze and olive oil. They're portable, require no utensils to prepare on site, and offer a refreshing taste.\n\n2. **Quinoa Salad**:\n   - Cook quinoa ahead of time and mix it with diced cucumbers, red onions, Kalamata olives, feta cheese, and a simple lemon-olive oil dressing. Quinoa holds up well and provides a good source of protein and fiber. It's also easy to portion into individual containers.\n\n3. **Homemade Hummus with Veggie Sticks**:\n   - Make a batch of hummus at home and bring it along with an assortment of veggies like carrots, celery, bell peppers, and cucumbers. This is not only healthy but also versatile and easy to eat.\n\n4. **Fruit Salad**:\n   - Chop up a variety of fruits like strawberries, blueberries, pineapple, mango, and grapes. Mix them together and perhaps add a touch of honey and lime juice for flavor. Fruit salads are light, refreshing, and perfect for a picnic.\n\n5. **Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Energy Bites**:\n   - These are no-bake treats made from oats, peanut butter, honey, and chocolate chips. Roll them into small balls and they're ready to eat. They're portable, satisfy sweet cravings, and provide some energy for outdoor activities.\n\nThis menu includes a mix of savory and sweet options, with a focus on freshness and ease of transport. Each dish can be prepared in advance and packed in containers that keep them fresh until mealtime. Enjoy your picnic!"
