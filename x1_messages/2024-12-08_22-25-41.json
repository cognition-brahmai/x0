        "content": "So I've got this problem here about two machines working together in a factory. Machine A can produce 30 units per hour, and Machine B can produce 20 units per hour. If both machines work together for 10 hours, I need to find out how many total units will be produced.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for both machines to work together. I think it means that they are both producing units at the same time, so their production rates add up.\n\nSo, Machine A produces 30 units per hour, and Machine B produces 20 units per hour. Together, they should produce 30 + 20 = 50 units per hour.\n\nNow, if they work together for 10 hours, I can find the total production by multiplying their combined hourly production rate by the number of hours they work.\n\nSo, total units = (combined production rate) \u00d7 (time)\n\nThat would be total units = 50 units/hour \u00d7 10 hours.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But maybe I should double-check if there's anything else I need to consider.\n\nIs there any chance that the machines might not work efficiently together, or maybe there's some overlap in their production that I need to account for? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I think it's safe to assume that their production rates are independent and additive.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any breaks or downtime in those 10 hours. The problem says \"both machines work together for 10 hours,\" so I'll assume they are working continuously without any breaks during that time.\n\nAlright, so sticking with the initial approach:\n\nTotal units = (Machine A's rate + Machine B's rate) \u00d7 time\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal units = (30 units/hour + 20 units/hour) \u00d7 10 hours = 50 units/hour \u00d7 10 hours = 500 units.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should calculate how much each machine produces separately and then add them up.\n\nMachine A produces 30 units per hour, so in 10 hours, it would produce 30 \u00d7 10 = 300 units.\n\nMachine B produces 20 units per hour, so in 10 hours, it would produce 20 \u00d7 10 = 200 units.\n\nAdding those together, 300 + 200 = 500 units.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm more confident now.\n\nIs there another way to look at this problem? Maybe using rates or something like that.\n\nWell, rates are essentially what I've used here. Machine A's rate is 30 units per hour, and Machine B's rate is 20 units per hour. When they work together, their rates add up to 50 units per hour.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of work done. But in this case, since the rates are constant and there's no interference between the machines, the straightforward addition should suffice.\n\nI should also make sure that the units are consistent. The production rates are given in units per hour, and the time is in hours, so everything matches up correctly.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the problem is trying to trick me in some way, but it seems pretty straightforward. There's no mention of varying rates or any other complications, so I don't think there's any trick here.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any formula I should be using. For work problems involving rates, the general formula is:\n\nTotal work = rate \u00d7 time\n\nIn this case, the total work is the total units produced, the rate is the combined production rate of both machines, and the time is 10 hours.\n\nSo, again, total units = (30 + 20) units/hour \u00d7 10 hours = 500 units.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it enough. The answer should be 500 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500} \\]"
