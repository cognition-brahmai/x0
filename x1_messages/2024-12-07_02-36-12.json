Each plan will have a corresponding evidence value which is the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user question, one or more previous evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nBing[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information using the Bing search engine. This tool is useful in finding an appropriate list of sites that may or may not include the answer to the user's question.\nWebScraper[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkExtractor[input]: Extract links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nQAEngine[input]: Question answering language model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What are some major accomplishments of Albert Einstein?"

        "content": "Alright, I need to find out about some major accomplishments of Albert Einstein. I think the best way to start is by searching for information about him. I can use the Bing search tool for that. So, my first plan is to search for \"Albert Einstein accomplishments\" using Bing.\n\n:evidence0: = Bing[\"Albert Einstein accomplishments\"]\n\nOnce I have the search results, I need to look through them to find relevant information. Probably, there will be several websites in the search results that talk about Einstein's achievements. I should pick a few reliable sources from these search results to get accurate information.\n\nPlan: Extract links from the search results to find relevant websites.\n\nTo do this, I can use the LinkExtractor tool on the search results I got from Bing.\n\n:evidence1: = LinkExtractor[:evidence0:]\n\nNow, with the list of links, I need to decide which ones to look into. It's important to choose sources that are credible, like educational websites, scientific journals, or well-known news outlets.\n\nPlan: Select a few credible links from the list.\n\nLet's say I pick the top three links that seem most relevant and credible. I can then use the WebScraper tool to extract the content from these links.\n\nFirst, I need to format the links into a single string separated by newline characters.\n\nPlan: Prepare the input for WebScraper.\n\nAssuming the links are link1, link2, and link3 from :evidence1:, I can create a string like \"link1\\nlink2\\nlink3\".\n\nThen, pass this string to WebScraper.\n\n:evidence2: = WebScraper[\"link1\\nlink2\\nlink3\"]\n\nThis should give me the plain text content from these websites.\n\nNow, with the text content, I need to find information about Einstein's major accomplishments. This might be scattered across different parts of the text, so I need a way to extract the relevant information.\n\nPlan: Use QAEngine to ask about Einstein's accomplishments based on the scraped text.\n\nI can formulate a question that references the evidence from the WebScraper.\n\n:evidence3: = QAEngine[\"What are some major accomplishments of Albert Einstein, based on :evidence2: ?\"]\n\nThis should give me an answer based on the text from the websites.\n\nHowever, to make sure the information is accurate and comprehensive, maybe I should look at more sources or cross-verify the information.\n\nPlan: Consider adding more sources or verifying the information.\n\nAlternatively, I can search for more specific terms related to Einstein's work, like \"theory of relativity,\" \"Einstein's contributions to physics,\" etc., and repeat the process.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume that the initial search and the information from the top three credible sources are sufficient.\n\nSo, the final answer would be :evidence3:.\n\nAnswer: :evidence3:\n\n**Final Plan:**\n\n1. Search for \"Albert Einstein accomplishments\" using Bing.\n   - :evidence0: = Bing[\"Albert Einstein accomplishments\"]\n\n2. Extract links from the search results.\n   - :evidence1: = LinkExtractor[:evidence0:]\n\n3. Select a few credible links from the extracted list.\n\n4. Prepare a string of selected links separated by newline characters.\n\n5. Scrape the content from the selected links.\n   - :evidence2: = WebScraper[\"selected_links\"]\n\n6. Use QAEngine to extract information about Einstein's major accomplishments based on the scraped text.\n   - :evidence3: = QAEngine[\"What are some major accomplishments of Albert Einstein, based on :evidence2: ?\"]\n\n7. The final answer is :evidence3:."
