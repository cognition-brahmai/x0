        "content": "To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word \"MATH\" without any restrictions, we need to calculate the number of permutations of the four distinct letters M, A, T, and H.\n\nSince all the letters are unique, the number of permutations is simply the factorial of the number of letters. The factorial of a number n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nIn this case, there are 4 letters, so we calculate 4!:\n\n4! = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24\n\nTherefore, there are 24 different ways to arrange the letters in the word \"MATH\" without any restrictions.\n\nTo verify this, let's list out all possible permutations:\n\n1. MATH\n\n2. MATh\n\n3. MAhT\n\n4. MAHT\n\n5. MT AH\n\n6. MTAH\n\n7. MTHA\n\n8. MHTA\n\n9. MHTA\n\n10. MHAT\n\n11. MHAT\n\n12. MHTA\n\n13. AMTH\n\n14. AMHT\n\n15. AT MH\n\n16. AT HM\n\n17. AHMT\n\n18. AHTM\n\n19. TM AH\n\n20. TMAH\n\n21. THMA\n\n22. TH AM\n\n23. TAHM\n\n24. TAMH\n\nWait a minute, I think I made a mistake in listing the permutations. Let's try to list them more systematically.\n\nLet's fix the first letter and find all possible arrangements for the remaining letters.\n\nStarting with M:\n\n- MATH\n\n- MATh\n\n- MAhT\n\n- MAHT\n\n- MT AH\n\n- MTAH\n\n- MTHA\n\n- MHTA\n\n- MHAT\n\n- MHA T\n\n- MHTA\n\n- MHAT\n\nSimilarly, starting with A:\n\n- AMTH\n\n- AMHT\n\n- AT MH\n\n- AT HM\n\n- AHMT\n\n- AHTM\n\nAnd so on for T and H.\n\nBut this is time-consuming, and I might miss some arrangements. Perhaps there's a better way to list them without repeating.\n\nAlternatively, since we know that there are 4 distinct letters, the number of permutations should indeed be 4! = 24.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Suppose we have 4 positions to fill with the letters M, A, T, and H, without any repetitions.\n\nFor the first position, we have 4 choices (M, A, T, H).\n\nOnce the first letter is chosen, there are 3 remaining choices for the second position.\n\nAfter choosing the first two letters, there are 2 choices left for the third position.\n\nFinally, there is only 1 choice left for the fourth position.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements is 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24.\n\nThis confirms our earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula for permutations of n distinct objects, which is n!.\n\nIn this case, n = 4 (M, A, T, H), so the number of permutations is 4! = 24.\n\nTherefore, there are 24 different ways to arrange the letters in the word \"MATH\" without any restrictions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
