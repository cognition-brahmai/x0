        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a bookstore that sells two types of books: hardcover and paperback. The hardcover books cost $25 each, and the paperbacks cost $15 each. The store sold a total of 100 books and made $2,000 from these sales. We need to find out how many of each type of book were sold.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define:\n\n- Let \\( h \\) be the number of hardcover books sold.\n\n- Let \\( p \\) be the number of paperback books sold.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of books sold is 100.\n\n2. The total sales amount is $2,000.\n\nSo, we can write two equations based on these pieces of information.\n\nThe first equation would represent the total number of books sold:\n\n\\[ h + p = 100 \\]\n\nThe second equation would represent the total sales amount:\n\n\\[ 25h + 15p = 2000 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. To solve this, we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. I'm pretty comfortable with both, but let's try the substitution method for this problem.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\n\\[ h + p = 100 \\]\n\nWe can solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. Let's solve for \\( h \\):\n\n\\[ h = 100 - p \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( h \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 25(100 - p) + 15p = 2000 \\]\n\nLet's simplify this:\n\n\\[ 2500 - 25p + 15p = 2000 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 2500 - 10p = 2000 \\]\n\nNow, let's isolate \\( p \\):\n\n\\[ -10p = 2000 - 2500 \\]\n\n\\[ -10p = -500 \\]\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{-500}{-10} \\]\n\n\\[ p = 50 \\]\n\nSo, 50 paperback books were sold.\n\nNow, we can find \\( h \\) by plugging \\( p \\) back into the first equation:\n\n\\[ h = 100 - 50 \\]\n\n\\[ h = 50 \\]\n\nTherefore, 50 hardcover books and 50 paperback books were sold.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If they sold 50 hardcover books at $25 each, that would be:\n\n\\[ 50 \\times 25 = 1250 \\]\n\nAnd 50 paperback books at $15 each:\n\n\\[ 50 \\times 15 = 750 \\]\n\nAdding those up:\n\n\\[ 1250 + 750 = 2000 \\]\n\nYes, that matches the total sales amount given in the problem. So, our solution seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using ratios or percentages?\n\nWell, another approach could be to think about the average price of the books sold. The total sales are $2,000 for 100 books, so the average price per book is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2000}{100} = 20 \\text{ dollars per book} \\]\n\nNow, since hardcover books are $25 and paperbacks are $15, and the average is $20, it suggests that the number of hardcover and paperback books sold are equal, because $20 is exactly halfway between $15 and $25. So, intuitively, it makes sense that 50 of each type were sold.\n\nThis is a nice way to check our answer quickly without going through the algebra. It's always good to have multiple methods to verify the solution.\n\nLet me think if there's any other way to look at this problem. Suppose we graphs the two equations. The first equation, \\( h + p = 100 \\), is a straight line with intercepts at (100,0) and (0,100). The second equation, \\( 25h + 15p = 2000 \\), is another straight line. The point where these two lines intersect would give us the solution.\n\nBut since this is a text-based problem, graphing might not be the most efficient method, especially since algebraic methods are straightforward here.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there could be multiple solutions. For example, is it possible that different combinations of hardcover and paperback books could add up to 100 books and $2,000 in sales?\n\nGiven that we have two equations and two variables, and the equations are linearly independent, there should be exactly one solution, which we've found to be 50 hardcover and 50 paperback books.\n\nTo ensure there are no other solutions, let's consider if negative numbers or fractions could be solutions. For instance, could \\( h \\) or \\( p \\) be negative? In this context, selling a negative number of books doesn't make sense, so we can disregard any negative solutions.\n\nSimilarly, the number of books sold must be whole numbers since you can't sell a fraction of a book. In our solution, both \\( h \\) and \\( p \\) are integers, which is appropriate.\n\nLet's also consider if there are any constraints we haven't accounted for. The problem states that the store sold a total of 100 books and made $2,000 in sales, with the prices of the books given. Assuming that all books sold are either hardcover or paperback, and there are no other types or discounts involved, our model seems adequate.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's imagine that there might be a scenario where the store sold a different number of books but still made $2,000. For example, if they sold only hardcover books, how many would they need to sell to make $2,000?\n\n\\[ 25h = 2000 \\]\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{2000}{25} = 80 \\]\n\nBut the total number of books sold would be 80, which doesn't match the given total of 100 books. Similarly, if they sold only paperback books:\n\n\\[ 15p = 2000 \\]\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{2000}{15} \\approx 133.33 \\]\n\nBut again, this doesn't match the total of 100 books, and plus, you can't sell a fraction of a book. So, our original solution still holds as the only feasible solution.\n\nLet me try another approach using matrices. We can represent the system of equations in matrix form:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n25 & 15\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nh \\\\\np\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n100 \\\\\n2000\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( h \\) and \\( p \\), we can find the inverse of the coefficient matrix and multiply both sides by it.\n\nFirst, find the determinant of the coefficient matrix:\n\n\\[ \\text{det} = (1)(15) - (1)(25) = 15 - 25 = -10 \\]\n\nNow, the inverse of the coefficient matrix is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{-10} \\begin{bmatrix} 15 & -1 \\\\ -25 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -1.5 & 0.1 \\\\ 2.5 & -0.1 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by the inverse:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nh \\\\\np\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1.5 & 0.1 \\\\\n2.5 & -0.1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n100 \\\\\n2000\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ h = (-1.5)(100) + (0.1)(2000) = -150 + 200 = 50 \\]\n\n\\[ p = (2.5)(100) + (-0.1)(2000) = 250 - 200 = 50 \\]\n\nAgain, we get \\( h = 50 \\) and \\( p = 50 \\), which matches our previous solution.\n\nThis matrix method confirms that our answer is correct. It's always reassuring to get the same result using different mathematical approaches.\n\nLet's consider if there's a way to solve this problem using proportions. The ratio of the prices of hardcover to paperback is $25:$15, which simplifies to 5:3.\n\nHowever, since we're dealing with the total number of books and total sales, proportions might not be the most direct method here. The earlier methods seem more straightforward for this particular problem.\n\nAnother angle to approach this from is to consider the difference in price between hardcover and paperback books. The difference is $25 - $15 = $10 per book.\n\nIf all 100 books were paperbacks, the total sales would be:\n\n\\[ 100 \\times 15 = 1500 \\]\n\nBut the actual sales are $2,000, which is $500 more than $1,500.\n\nSince each hardcover book brings in an extra $10 compared to a paperback, the number of hardcover books can be found by:\n\n\\[ \\text{number of hardcover books} = \\frac{2000 - 1500}{10} = \\frac{500}{10} = 50 \\]\n\nThen, the number of paperback books is:\n\n\\[ p = 100 - 50 = 50 \\]\n\nAgain, we arrive at the same solution. This method is often called the \"assumption method\" and can be efficient for problems like this.\n\nIt's interesting to see that no matter which method we use\u2014substitution, elimination, matrices, or the assumption method\u2014we consistently get 50 hardcover and 50 paperback books sold.\n\nThis reinforces our confidence in the solution. It's always a good practice to verify solutions using multiple methods, especially when first learning how to solve such problems.\n\nIn summary, the bookstore sold 50 hardcover books and 50 paperback books.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50 \\text{ hardcover books and } 50 \\text{ paperback books}} \\]"
