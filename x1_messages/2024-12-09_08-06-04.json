        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you write a Java program that reads a CSV file containing student information and then allows you to sort and display that information based on different criteria. Sounds like a good exercise in file I/O, object-oriented programming, and collection handling in Java.\n\nFirst, let's break down what we need to do:\n\n1. **Define a Student class**: This class will have properties for name, age, and grade, along with constructors and getters/setters.\n\n2. **Read a CSV file**: We'll use Java's built-in libraries to read from a CSV file and parse its contents into Student objects.\n\n3. **Store students in an ArrayList**: We'll create an ArrayList to hold all the Student objects.\n\n4. **Implement sorting methods**: We'll create methods to sort the list of students by name, age, or grade.\n\n5. **Display the sorted list**: Finally, we'll write a method to print the sorted list of students to the console.\n\nLet's start by defining the Student class.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Student class\n\n```java\npublic class Student {\n    private String name;\n    private int age;\n    private double grade;\n\n    public Student(String name, int age, double grade) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = age;\n        this.grade = grade;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public int getAge() {\n        return age;\n    }\n\n    public double getGrade() {\n        return grade;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"Student{name='\" + name + \"', age=\" + age + \", grade=\" + grade + \"}\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis class is straightforward. It has private fields for name, age, and grade, along with a constructor to initialize them and getters to access their values. The `toString` method is overridden to provide a nice string representation of the Student object.\n\n### Step 2: Read the CSV file\n\nFor reading the CSV file, we can use the `BufferedReader` class along with `FileReader`. We'll assume that the CSV file has columns in the order: name, age, grade, and that there are no headers.\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class StudentManager {\n\n    public static List<Student> readStudentsFromFile(String fileName) {\n        List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();\n        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {\n            String line;\n            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n                String[] values = line.split(\",\");\n                if (values.length == 3) {\n                    String name = values[0];\n                    int age = Integer.parseInt(values[1]);\n                    double grade = Double.parseDouble(values[2]);\n                    students.add(new Student(name, age, grade));\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n        return students;\n    }\n\n    // Sorting and display methods will be added here\n}\n```\n\nIn this method, we open the file specified by `fileName`, read it line by line, split each line by commas to get the name, age, and grade, convert age and grade to their appropriate types, and create a Student object which is then added to the list.\n\n### Step 3: Implement sorting methods\n\nTo sort the list of students, we can use the `Collections.sort` method along with a `Comparator`. We'll create separate methods for sorting by name, age, and grade.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Collections;\nimport java.util.Comparator;\n\npublic class StudentManager {\n\n    // ... readStudentsFromFile method ...\n\n    public static void sortByName(List<Student> students) {\n        Collections.sort(students, Comparator.comparing(Student::getName));\n    }\n\n    public static void sortByAge(List<Student> students) {\n        Collections.sort(students, Comparator.comparingInt(Student::getAge));\n    }\n\n    public static void sortByGrade(List<Student> students) {\n        Collections.sort(students, Comparator.comparingDouble(Student::getGrade));\n    }\n\n    // Display method will be added here\n}\n```\n\nEach sorting method takes the list of students and sorts it based on the specified field using a comparator.\n\n### Step 4: Implement the display method\n\nFinally, we need a method to display the list of students. We'll iterate through the list and print each student's details.\n\n```java\npublic class StudentManager {\n\n    // ... previous methods ...\n\n    public static void displayStudents(List<Student> students) {\n        for (Student student : students) {\n            System.out.println(student);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis method simply iterates through the list and prints each student using the `toString` method we defined in the Student class.\n\n### Step 5: Putting it all together\n\nNow, let's write a main method to test our StudentManager class. We'll read the students from a file, sort them by name, age, and grade, and display the results each time.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        List<Student> students = StudentManager.readStudentsFromFile(\"students.csv\");\n\n        System.out.println(\"Sorted by name:\");\n        StudentManager.sortByName(students);\n        StudentManager.displayStudents(students);\n\n        System.out.println(\"\\nSorted by age:\");\n        StudentManager.sortByAge(students);\n        StudentManager.displayStudents(students);\n\n        System.out.println(\"\\nSorted by grade:\");\n        StudentManager.sortByGrade(students);\n        StudentManager.displayStudents(students);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAssuming you have a file named \"students.csv\" in the same directory as your program, containing data like:\n\n```\nAlice,20,88.5\nBob,22,92.0\nCharlie,21,79.5\n```\n\nThis program will read the data, sort it by name, age, and grade, and print the results each time.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThat's it! You've created a Java program that reads student data from a CSV file, stores it in an ArrayList of Student objects, sorts the list by different criteria, and displays the sorted list. This exercise covers several important concepts in Java, including file I/O, object-oriented design, and collection handling.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further clarification on any part of this program, feel free to ask!"
