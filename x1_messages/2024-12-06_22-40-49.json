HMMs are statistical models where the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with hidden states. In speech recognition, the hidden states might correspond to the underlying words that a person is saying, while the observable data might be the acoustic signal. What is a key assumption made by HMMs in modeling sequences of observations?\nA. The probability of a particular state depends only on the previous state\nB. The probability of a particular state depends on all previous states\nC. The probability of a particular state depends on the next state\nD. The probability of a particular state is independent of other states"

        "content": "A key assumption made by Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in modeling sequences of observations is that the probability of a particular state depends only on the previous state. This is known as the Markov property, which states that the future state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. In the context of speech recognition, this means that the current word being spoken depends only on the previous word, not on the entire history of words spoken before that. This simplifying assumption makes HMMs computationally feasible and effective for many sequence modeling tasks, including speech and language processing."
