        "content": "Let's see. There are 20 students in the classroom, and each student has exactly 3 pencils. So, first, I need to find out how many pencils there are in total.\n\nIf each student has 3 pencils, then for 20 students, the total number of pencils would be 20 times 3. That is:\n\n20 students \u00d7 3 pencils/student = 60 pencils\n\nNow, each pencil costs $0.50. To find out the total cost of all the pencils, I need to multiply the number of pencils by the cost per pencil.\n\nSo, 60 pencils \u00d7 $0.50/pencil\n\nMultiplying 60 by 0.50:\n\n60 \u00d7 0.50 = 30\n\nTherefore, the total cost of all the pencils in the classroom is $30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
