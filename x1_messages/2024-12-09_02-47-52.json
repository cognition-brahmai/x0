        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: There's a box with red balls and blue balls. The probability of picking a red ball is 1/3, and there are 12 more blue balls than red balls. I need to find out how many balls are in the box in total.\n\nOkay, first things first. Probability is involved, so I remember that probability is the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of outcomes. Here, the favorable outcome is picking a red ball, and the total outcomes are all the balls in the box.\n\nSo, if the probability of picking a red ball is 1/3, that means the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls is equal to 1/3.\n\nLet me denote the number of red balls as R and the number of blue balls as B. So, the total number of balls is R + B.\n\nAccording to the problem, the probability of picking a red ball is R / (R + B) = 1/3.\n\nAlso, it's given that there are 12 more blue balls than red balls, which means B = R + 12.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. R / (R + B) = 1/3\n\n2. B = R + 12\n\nI can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for R.\n\nSo, plugging B = R + 12 into the first equation:\n\nR / (R + (R + 12)) = 1/3\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\nR / (2R + 12) = 1/3\n\nNow, cross-multiplying to solve for R:\n\nR * 3 = (2R + 12) * 1\n\nSo, 3R = 2R + 12\n\nSubtract 2R from both sides:\n\n3R - 2R = 12\n\nR = 12\n\nNow that I have R = 12, I can find B using the second equation:\n\nB = R + 12 = 12 + 12 = 24\n\nSo, there are 12 red balls and 24 blue balls.\n\nTo find the total number of balls, I add them together:\n\nTotal balls = R + B = 12 + 24 = 36\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIf there are 12 red balls and 24 blue balls, the total is indeed 36.\n\nNow, checking the probability:\n\nProbability of picking a red ball = R / total = 12 / 36 = 1/3\n\nWhich matches the given probability.\n\nAlso, the difference between blue and red balls is 24 - 12 = 12, which matches the given condition.\n\nSo, the total number of balls in the box is 36.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
