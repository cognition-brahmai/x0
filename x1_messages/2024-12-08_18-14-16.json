        "content": "Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that. So, you want a Golang program that implements a stack using linked lists, right? And this stack should have the basic operations like push, pop, peek, and a way to check if it's empty. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what a stack is. A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. That means the last element you add is the first one to be removed. It's like a stack of plates; you can only take the top plate off.\n\nNow, to implement this in Go, we'll use linked lists because they are efficient for stack operations. Linked lists allow us to add and remove elements from the top of the stack in constant time, O(1), which is ideal.\n\nSo, here's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Define the Node Structure**: Each element in the stack will be a node that holds some data and a pointer to the next node.\n\n2. **Define the Stack Structure**: This will hold a pointer to the top node of the stack.\n\n3. **Implement the Push Operation**: This adds a new node to the top of the stack.\n\n4. **Implement the Pop Operation**: This removes the top node from the stack and returns its data.\n\n5. **Implement the Peek Operation**: This returns the data of the top node without removing it.\n\n6. **Implement theIsEmpty Function**: This checks if the stack is empty.\n\nLet's start by defining the node structure. In Go, we can define a struct for the node:\n\n```go\ntype Node struct {\n    Data interface{}\n    Next *Node\n}\n```\n\nHere, `Data` can hold any type of data since we're using `interface{}`, and `Next` is a pointer to the next node in the stack.\n\nNext, we define the stack structure:\n\n```go\ntype Stack struct {\n    Top *Node\n}\n```\n\nThe `Top` field points to the top node of the stack. If `Top` is `nil`, the stack is empty.\n\nNow, let's implement the push operation. Push adds a new element to the top of the stack. Here's how we can do it:\n\n```go\nfunc (s *Stack) Push(data interface{}) {\n    newNode := &Node{Data: data, Next: s.Top}\n    s.Top = newNode\n}\n```\n\nThis function creates a new node with the given data and sets its `Next` pointer to the current top node. Then, it updates the `Top` pointer to point to the new node.\n\nNext, the pop operation. Pop removes the top element from the stack and returns its data. We need to handle the case where the stack is empty:\n\n```go\nfunc (s *Stack) Pop() (interface{}, error) {\n    if s.Top == nil {\n        return nil, errors.New(\"stack is empty\")\n    }\n    data := s.Top.Data\n    s.Top = s.Top.Next\n    return data, nil\n}\n```\n\nIf the stack is empty, we return an error. Otherwise, we store the data of the top node, update the `Top` pointer to the next node, and return the data.\n\nNow, the peek operation. Peek looks at the top element without removing it:\n\n```go\nfunc (s *Stack) Peek() (interface{}, error) {\n    if s.Top == nil {\n        return nil, errors.New(\"stack is empty\")\n    }\n    return s.Top.Data, nil\n}\n```\n\nSimilar to pop, but we just return the data without modifying the stack.\n\nFinally, the isEmpty function to check if the stack is empty:\n\n```go\nfunc (s *Stack) IsEmpty() bool {\n    return s.Top == nil\n}\n```\n\nThat's pretty straightforward. If `Top` is `nil`, the stack is empty.\n\nTo use this stack, you can create a new stack and perform operations on it. Here's a simple example:\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n    stack := &Stack{}\n    \n    stack.Push(1)\n    stack.Push(2)\n    stack.Push(3)\n    \n    if data, err := stack.Pop(); err == nil {\n        fmt.Println(\"Popped:\", data) // Should print 3\n    }\n    \n    if data, err := stack.Peek(); err == nil {\n        fmt.Println(\"Top element:\", data) // Should print 2\n    }\n    \n    if stack.IsEmpty() {\n        fmt.Println(\"Stack is empty\")\n    } else {\n        fmt.Println(\"Stack is not empty\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code pushes three elements onto the stack, pops one, peeks at the top element, and checks if the stack is empty.\n\nThat should cover the basics of implementing a stack using linked lists in Go.
