        "content": "So the factory makes 150 units each day and works 20 days each month. I need to find out how many units it makes in a whole year. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many units are produced in one month. Since it produces 150 units per day and works 20 days a month, I can multiply those two numbers to get the monthly production.\n\nSo, 150 units/day times 20 days/month equals 3,000 units per month.\n\nNow, to find out the annual production, I need to calculate how many units are produced in 12 months, since there are 12 months in a year.\n\nSo, 3,000 units/month times 12 months/year equals 36,000 units per year.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way could be to find out how many days the factory works in a year and then multiply that by the daily production.\n\nIf the factory operates 20 days each month and there are 12 months in a year, then the total number of working days in a year is 20 days/month times 12 months/year, which equals 240 days per year.\n\nThen, multiplying the daily production by the number of working days in a year: 150 units/day times 240 days/year equals 36,000 units per year.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, which is 36,000 units per year.\n\nI think that makes sense. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation.\n\nFor example, are there any holidays or downtime that might mean the factory doesn't operate for the full 20 days each month? The problem doesn't mention any exceptions, so I'll assume it operates exactly 20 days every month.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"the factory operates for 20 days per month,\" but in reality, months have different numbers of days, ranging from 28 to 31. But since the problem gives a fixed number of operating days per month, I'll stick with that.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any leap years or extra days in the year, but since the problem specifies \"per month\" and gives a fixed number of days, I don't think that's relevant here.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the factory produces 36,000 units in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36000} \\]"
