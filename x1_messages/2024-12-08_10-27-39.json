        "content": "Sure! I'd be happy to help you classify these common houseplants based on their care requirements. Let's look at each one:\n\n1. **Aloe Vera**\n   - **Light:** Aloe Vera prefers bright, indirect light. It can tolerate some direct sunlight, but too much can cause the leaves to burn.\n   - **Watering:** It's essential not to overwater Aloe Vera. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. During winter, reduce watering frequency.\n   - **Temperature:** Aloe Vera thrives in temperatures between 55-80\u00b0F (13-27\u00b0C). It doesn't do well in cold temperatures and should be protected from frost.\n\n2. **Snake Plant (Sansevieria)**\n   - **Light:** Snake Plants can tolerate low to bright indirect light. They are quite adaptable and can even survive in dimly lit areas, making them ideal for offices or rooms with minimal light.\n   - **Watering:** These plants are drought tolerant. Water thoroughly, then allow the soil to dry out completely before watering again. Overwatering is a common mistake and can lead to root rot.\n   - **Temperature:** Snake Plants prefer temperatures between 60-85\u00b0F (16-29\u00b0C). They can tolerate some temperature fluctuations but should be protected from cold drafts.\n\n3. **Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)**\n   - **Light:** Peace Lilies prefer bright, indirect light but can tolerate lower light conditions. Direct sunlight can scorch their leaves.\n   - **Watering:** Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. Yellow leaves can indicate overwatering.\n   - **Temperature:** These plants thrive in temperatures between 65-80\u00b0F (18-27\u00b0C). They do not like cold temperatures and should be kept away from drafts.\n\n4. **Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)**\n   - **Light:** Spider Plants prefer bright, indirect light but can tolerate lower light levels. Direct sunlight may cause their leaves to turn yellow.\n   - **Watering:** Keep the soil evenly moist during the growing season and reduce watering in winter. Avoid letting the soil dry out completely.\n   - **Temperature:** They prefer temperatures between 60-75\u00b0F (16-24\u00b0C). Spider Plants can tolerate a wider range but may suffer in extreme temperatures.\n\n5. **Rubber Tree (Ficus elastica)**\n   - **Light:** Rubber Trees prefer bright, indirect light. They can tolerate low light but may grow more slowly. Direct sunlight can burn their leaves.\n   - **Watering:** Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. During winter, reduce watering frequency. Overwatering can lead to root rot.\n   - **Temperature:** These plants prefer temperatures between 60-80\u00b0F (16-27\u00b0C). They do not like cold temperatures and should be protected from drafts.\n\nEach of these plants has its own specific care requirements, but they are generally considered easy to care for, making them popular choices for both beginners and experienced plant enthusiasts."
