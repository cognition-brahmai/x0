        "content": "Let's see here. So, the store sells apples in bags of 6 each, and if you buy 3 bags, you get one bag free. I need to figure out how many apples I get if I buy 12 bags.\n\nFirst, I should understand the deal. For every 3 bags I buy, I get an extra bag for free. So, effectively, for every 3 bags, I get 4 bags in total.\n\nNow, if I buy 12 bags, I need to see how many sets of 3 bags are in 12. That would be 12 divided by 3, which is 4. So, for 4 sets of 3 bags, I get 4 free bags.\n\nTherefore, the total number of bags I get is the 12 bags I bought plus the 4 free bags, which equals 16 bags.\n\nSince each bag contains 6 apples, the total number of apples would be 16 bags multiplied by 6 apples per bag, which is 96 apples.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If I buy 12 bags and get 4 free bags, that's indeed 16 bags. And 16 times 6 is 96. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps the free bag is added for every 3 bags purchased, so for 12 bags, it's 12 divided by 3, which is 4 free bags, as I thought.\n\nSo, total bags are 12 + 4 = 16, and 16 times 6 equals 96 apples.\n\nI think that's the answer: 96 apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{96} \\]"
