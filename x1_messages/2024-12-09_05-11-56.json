Store this evidence into a variable #E[index] that can be referenced later.\n\nHere are the tools at your disposal:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: A tool that enables users to search for information through DuckDuckGo. This tool generates a list of sites that might contain the answer to the user's query.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts key pieces of information from plain text and produces a summarized version of the text.\nURLFinder[input]: Finds URLs from plain text and outputs a plain text, newline delimited list of URLs.\nQAModel[input]: A question-answering language model that answers questions based on an input text passage. The input must be a text question that references a #E[n] variable, e.g., What is the population of New York City, given #E1?\n\nThe input to each function should simply be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., QAModel[What is the capital of France, given #E3?].\n\nMake sure to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should follow this format:\nPlan: [first action based on input question]\n#E1 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on result of #E1]\n#E2 = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context #E1\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: Who invented the telephone and what was their motivation behind it?"
