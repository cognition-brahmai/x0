        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a theme park designing a new roller coaster with a height restriction of 48 inches or taller. According to the census data, different age groups have different percentages of children who meet this height requirement. Specifically, it's broken down into three age groups: ages 4-6 with 40% meeting the requirement, ages 7-9 with 75%, and ages 10-12 with 95%. The park expects an equal number of visitors from each age group, and I need to find out the overall percentage of children who will be able to ride the new roller coaster.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have three age groups with different percentages of children tall enough to ride the roller coaster, and the park expects an equal number of visitors from each group. So, to find the overall percentage, I probably need to find some kind of average of these percentages, but I have to make sure I'm doing it correctly because it's not always straightforward when dealing with percentages.\n\nLet me list out the given data:\n\n- Ages 4-6: 40%\n\n- Ages 7-9: 75%\n\n- Ages 10-12: 95%\n\nAnd the park expects an equal number of visitors from each age group. Since the number of visitors from each group is equal, I can assume that each group makes up one-third of the total visitors.\n\nTo find the overall percentage, I can calculate the weighted average of these percentages, where each percentage is weighted by the proportion of visitors from that age group. Since the proportions are equal, it's simply the average of the three percentages.\n\nSo, the overall percentage \\( P \\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{40\\% + 75\\% + 95\\%}{3} \\]\n\nLet me add those percentages together:\n\n40% + 75% = 115%\n\n115% + 95% = 210%\n\nNow, divide by 3:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{210\\%}{3} = 70\\% \\]\n\nSo, the overall percentage of children who will be able to ride the new roller coaster is 70%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations. 40 plus 75 is indeed 115, and 115 plus 95 is 210. Dividing 210 by 3 is 70. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of actual numbers to verify. Suppose the park has 100 visitors from each age group. So, total visitors are 300.\n\n- From ages 4-6: 40% of 100 = 40 children can ride.\n\n- From ages 7-9: 75% of 100 = 75 children can ride.\n\n- From ages 10-12: 95% of 100 = 95 children can ride.\n\nTotal children who can ride: 40 + 75 + 95 = 210\n\nTotal visitors: 300\n\nOverall percentage: \\(\\frac{210}{300} \\times 100\\% = 70\\%\\)\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the overall percentage is indeed 70%.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe if the age groups had different numbers of visitors, but in this case, it's specified that the park expects an equal number of visitors from each age group. So, the straightforward average is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, if the proportions were different, I would need to weight each percentage accordingly. But since they're equal, the simple average works.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 70% is the correct overall percentage of children who will be able to ride the new roller coaster.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70\\%} \\]"
