It is useful for finding sites that may contain answers to your questions.\nTextScraper[input]: This tool extracts text from websites. The input should be one or more URLs separated by commas.\nLinkExtractor[input]: This tool extracts links from plain text and produces a list of links as output.\nQAModel[input]: This tool answers questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g. What color is the cat, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2020 and what was their contribution?"
