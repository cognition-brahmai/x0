        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 employees, each making $50,000 a year. So, currently, the total salary paid by the company is 10 times $50,000, which is $500,000 per year.\n\nNow, the company wants to give raises such that the total salary becomes $600,000 per year. So, the total increase in salary is $600,000 - $500,000 = $100,000.\n\nThis $100,000 is distributed among the 10 employees. To find out how much each employee gets, we can divide $100,000 by 10, which is $10,000 per employee.\n\nSo, each employee gets a raise of $10,000, making their new salary $50,000 + $10,000 = $60,000 per year.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the new average salary. Since all employees get the same raise and the total salary is now $600,000 for 10 employees, the average salary would be $600,000 divided by 10, which is $60,000.\n\nSo, the new average salary is $60,000.\n\nAlternatively, since all employees receive the same raise and the average salary is just the total salary divided by the number of employees, we could have directly calculated the new average by dividing $600,000 by 10.\n\nEither way, the answer is $60,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60000} \\]"
