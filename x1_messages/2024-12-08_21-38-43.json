        "content": "So the city has $500,000 to spend on installing public Wi-Fi hotspots in the downtown area. Each hotspot costs $10,000 to install, and there's an additional $1,000 per year for maintenance per hotspot. The city wants to make sure that it can cover the maintenance costs for at least five years within this budget.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much money needs to be set aside for maintenance over five years for each hotspot. Since each hotspot costs $1,000 per year for maintenance, for five years that would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Maintenance per hotspot for 5 years} = \\$1,000 \\times 5 = \\$5,000 \\]\n\nSo, for each hotspot, the total cost would be the installation cost plus the maintenance cost for five years:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost per hotspot} = \\$10,000 + \\$5,000 = \\$15,000 \\]\n\nNow, to find out the maximum number of hotspots the city can install within the $500,000 budget, I need to divide the total budget by the total cost per hotspot:\n\n\\[ \\text{Maximum number of hotspots} = \\frac{\\$500,000}{\\$15,000} \\]\n\nLet me do that calculation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{500,000}{15,000} = 33.\\overline{3} \\]\n\nSince the city can't install a fraction of a hotspot, they can install a maximum of 33 hotspots.\n\nBut let me double-check this to make sure I haven't missed anything. If they install 33 hotspots, the total cost would be:\n\n\\[ 33 \\times \\$15,000 = \\$495,000 \\]\n\nThat leaves $5,000 unused from the $500,000 budget. Now, if they try to install 34 hotspots:\n\n\\[ 34 \\times \\$15,000 = \\$510,000 \\]\n\nWhich is $10,000 over the budget. So, indeed, 33 is the maximum number they can install without exceeding the budget.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. Perhaps they can install more hotspots and cover only part of the maintenance costs within the budget. But the problem specifies that they want to ensure coverage for at least five years within the given budget, so they need to cover the full maintenance costs for that period.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to separate the installation costs and the maintenance costs. The total installation cost for \\( n \\) hotspots would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Installation total} = \\$10,000 \\times n \\]\n\nThe total maintenance cost for five years for \\( n \\) hotspots would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Maintenance total} = \\$1,000 \\times 5 \\times n = \\$5,000 \\times n \\]\n\nSo, the total cost is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = (\\$10,000 \\times n) + (\\$5,000 \\times n) = \\$15,000 \\times n \\]\n\nSetting this equal to the budget:\n\n\\[ \\$15,000 \\times n \\leq \\$500,000 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[ n \\leq \\frac{500,000}{15,000} = 33.\\overline{3} \\]\n\nAgain, this confirms that the maximum whole number of hotspots they can install is 33.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other costs that might be involved, such as setup costs, permits, or ongoing operational costs beyond maintenance. However, based on the information provided, the only costs mentioned are installation and annual maintenance.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the maintenance cost is specified as $1,000 per year per hotspot, and it's for at least five years. If the city plans to operate the hotspots beyond five years, they would need to budget additional maintenance costs separately, but for this project, they're only considering the initial five-year period.\n\nIn conclusion, the city can install a maximum of 33 hotspots with their $500,000 budget, ensuring that both installation and five years of maintenance are fully covered.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33} \\]"
