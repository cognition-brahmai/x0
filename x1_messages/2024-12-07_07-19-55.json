        "content": "So I have this problem: determine the Galois group of the polynomial \\( x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 \\) over the rational numbers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Galois theory, but I'll try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a Galois group is. It's a group that relates to the roots of a polynomial and the fields generated by those roots. Specifically, it's the group of automorphisms of the splitting field of the polynomial that fix the base field, which in this case is the rational numbers.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is find the roots of the polynomial \\( x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 \\). This looks like a quartic polynomial, and quartics can be a bit tricky, but maybe it can be factored or solved using a substitution.\n\nLet me try substituting \\( y = x^2 \\). Then the polynomial becomes \\( y^2 - 10y + 1 \\). That's a quadratic in terms of \\( y \\), which is easier to solve.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{100 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{96}}{2} = \\frac{10 \\pm 4\\sqrt{6}}{2} = 5 \\pm 2\\sqrt{6} \\]\n\nSo, \\( y = 5 + 2\\sqrt{6} \\) or \\( y = 5 - 2\\sqrt{6} \\).\n\nNow, recall that \\( y = x^2 \\), so to find \\( x \\), I take square roots:\n\n\\[ x = \\pm \\sqrt{5 + 2\\sqrt{6}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\pm \\sqrt{5 - 2\\sqrt{6}} \\]\n\nSo, the four roots of the polynomial are:\n\n\\[ x_1 = \\sqrt{5 + 2\\sqrt{6}}, \\quad x_2 = -\\sqrt{5 + 2\\sqrt{6}}, \\quad x_3 = \\sqrt{5 - 2\\sqrt{6}}, \\quad x_4 = -\\sqrt{5 - 2\\sqrt{6}} \\]\n\nNext, I need to find the splitting field of this polynomial over the rationals. The splitting field is the smallest field extension of the rationals that contains all four of these roots.\n\nSo, let's consider \\( K = \\mathbb{Q}(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) \\). But I need to express this field in a more manageable way.\n\nFirst, notice that \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_3 \\) are positive, and \\( x_2 \\) and \\( x_4 \\) are their negatives. So, really, \\( K = \\mathbb{Q}(x_1, x_3) \\), since \\( x_2 \\) and \\( x_4 \\) can be obtained by multiplying \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_3 \\) by -1, which is already in the rationals.\n\nNow, let's look at \\( x_1 = \\sqrt{5 + 2\\sqrt{6}} \\) and \\( x_3 = \\sqrt{5 - 2\\sqrt{6}} \\).\n\nIt might be helpful to simplify these square roots. I suspect that these can be expressed in terms of simpler square roots.\n\nLet me assume that \\( \\sqrt{5 + 2\\sqrt{6}} = \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are rational numbers to be determined.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[ 5 + 2\\sqrt{6} = a + 2\\sqrt{ab} + b \\]\n\nSo, \\( a + b = 5 \\) and \\( 2\\sqrt{ab} = 2\\sqrt{6} \\), which implies \\( ab = 6 \\).\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n\\[ a + b = 5 \\]\n\n\\[ ab = 6 \\]\n\nThis is a system that can be solved by considering it as a quadratic equation whose roots are \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ t^2 - 5t + 6 = 0 \\]\n\nFactoring:\n\n\\[ (t - 2)(t - 3) = 0 \\]\n\nSo, \\( t = 2 \\) or \\( t = 3 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = 3 \\), or vice versa.\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{5 + 2\\sqrt{6}} = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{5 - 2\\sqrt{6}} = \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let's check:\n\n\\[ (\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3})^2 = 2 + 2\\sqrt{6} + 3 = 5 + 2\\sqrt{6} \\]\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\[ (\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3})^2 = 2 - 2\\sqrt{6} + 3 = 5 - 2\\sqrt{6} \\]\n\nSo, indeed,\n\n\\[ x_1 = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\n\\[ x_2 = -(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}) \\]\n\n\\[ x_3 = \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\n\\[ x_4 = -(\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}) \\]\n\nTherefore, the splitting field \\( K \\) is \\( \\mathbb{Q}(x_1, x_3) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}) \\).\n\nBut actually, since \\( \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\) and \\( \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} \\) are both in \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\), and in fact, \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\), because:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} = \\frac{(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3})^2 - 5}{2\\sqrt{6}} \\]\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Maybe it's easier to note that \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) can be expressed in terms of \\( \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\) and \\( \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nIndeed,\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}) + (\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3})}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{3} = \\frac{(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}) - (\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3})}{2} \\]\n\nSo, \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\).\n\nTherefore, the splitting field \\( K \\) is \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\).\n\nNow, to find the Galois group, I need to determine the automorphisms of \\( K \\) that fix \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\).\n\nFirst, let's find the degree of the extension \\( [K : \\mathbb{Q}] \\).\n\nSince \\( K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\), and \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\) has degree 2 over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), because the minimal polynomial of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) is \\( x^2 - 2 \\), which is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\) has degree 2 if \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) is not in \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\).\n\nIs \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\)? Suppose \\( \\sqrt{3} = a + b\\sqrt{2} \\), where \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\).\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[ 3 = a^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{2} + 2b^2 \\]\n\n\\[ 3 = (a^2 + 2b^2) + 2ab\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nFor this to hold, the rational and irrational parts must be equal:\n\n\\[ a^2 + 2b^2 = 3 \\]\n\n\\[ 2ab = 0 \\]\n\nFrom \\( 2ab = 0 \\), either \\( a = 0 \\) or \\( b = 0 \\).\n\nIf \\( a = 0 \\), then \\( 2b^2 = 3 \\), so \\( b^2 = \\frac{3}{2} \\), and \\( b = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} \\), which is not rational.\n\nIf \\( b = 0 \\), then \\( a^2 = 3 \\), and \\( a = \\pm \\sqrt{3} \\), which is also not rational.\n\nTherefore, \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) is not in \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\), so the degree of the extension \\( [K : \\mathbb{Q}] = [ \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) ] \\times [ \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) : \\mathbb{Q} ] = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\).\n\nSo, the degree is 4, which means the Galois group has order 4.\n\nNow, I need to find all the automorphisms of \\( K \\) that fix \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\). Since the extension is Galois (it's the splitting field of a separable polynomial), the Galois group has order equal to the degree of the extension, which is 4.\n\nSo, there are four automorphisms. What are they?\n\nWell, any automorphism is determined by where it sends the generators \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( \\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nAn automorphism must send \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) to another root of its minimal polynomial over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), which is \\( x^2 - 2 \\), so it can be sent to \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) or \\( -\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nSimilarly, it must send \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) to another root of its minimal polynomial over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), which is \\( x^2 - 3 \\), so it can be sent to \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) or \\( -\\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nTherefore, there are four possible automorphisms:\n\n1. \\( \\sigma_1 \\): \\( \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2} \\), \\( \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3} \\) (the identity)\n\n2. \\( \\sigma_2 \\): \\( \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2} \\), \\( \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3} \\)\n\n3. \\( \\sigma_3 \\): \\( \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2} \\), \\( \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3} \\)\n\n4. \\( \\sigma_4 \\): \\( \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2} \\), \\( \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3} \\)\n\nI need to check that these are indeed automorphisms and that they are distinct.\n\nClearly, \\( \\sigma_1 \\) is the identity. The others are non-trivial automorphisms because they change at least one generator.\n\nNow, let's see what these automorphisms do to the roots of the polynomial.\n\nRecall that the roots are:\n\n\\[ x_1 = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\n\\[ x_2 = -\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\n\\[ x_3 = \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\n\\[ x_4 = -\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nWait a second, actually, earlier I had:\n\n\\[ x_1 = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\n\\[ x_2 = -(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\n\\[ x_3 = \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\n\\[ x_4 = -(\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's see how each automorphism permutes these roots.\n\n1. \\( \\sigma_1 \\):\n\n\\[ \\sigma_1(x_1) = \\sigma_1(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = x_1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_1(x_2) = -\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} = x_2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_1(x_3) = \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} = x_3 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_1(x_4) = -\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = x_4 \\]\n\nSo, \\( \\sigma_1 \\) is the identity permutation.\n\n2. \\( \\sigma_2 \\):\n\n\\[ \\sigma_2(x_1) = \\sigma_2(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = x_4 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_2(x_2) = \\sigma_2(-\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = x_1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_2(x_3) = \\sigma_2(\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} = x_2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_2(x_4) = \\sigma_2(-\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} = x_3 \\]\n\nSo, \\( \\sigma_2 \\) corresponds to the permutation:\n\n\\[ x_1 \\mapsto x_4 \\]\n\n\\[ x_2 \\mapsto x_1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_3 \\mapsto x_2 \\]\n\n\\[ x_4 \\mapsto x_3 \\]\n\nIn cycle notation, this is \\( (x_1 x_4 x_3 x_2) \\).\n\n3. \\( \\sigma_3 \\):\n\n\\[ \\sigma_3(x_1) = \\sigma_3(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} = x_3 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_3(x_2) = \\sigma_3(-\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = x_4 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_3(x_3) = \\sigma_3(\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = x_1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_3(x_4) = \\sigma_3(-\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} = x_2 \\]\n\nSo, \\( \\sigma_3 \\) corresponds to the permutation:\n\n\\[ x_1 \\mapsto x_3 \\]\n\n\\[ x_2 \\mapsto x_4 \\]\n\n\\[ x_3 \\mapsto x_1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_4 \\mapsto x_2 \\]\n\nIn cycle notation, this is \\( (x_1 x_3)(x_2 x_4) \\).\n\n4. \\( \\sigma_4 \\):\n\n\\[ \\sigma_4(x_1) = \\sigma_4(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} = x_2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_4(x_2) = \\sigma_4(-\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = x_1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_4(x_3) = \\sigma_4(\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = x_4 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_4(x_4) = \\sigma_4(-\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} = x_3 \\]\n\nSo, \\( \\sigma_4 \\) corresponds to the permutation:\n\n\\[ x_1 \\mapsto x_2 \\]\n\n\\[ x_2 \\mapsto x_1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_3 \\mapsto x_4 \\]\n\n\\[ x_4 \\mapsto x_3 \\]\n\nIn cycle notation, this is \\( (x_1 x_2)(x_3 x_4) \\).\n\nNow, let's summarize the permutations corresponding to each automorphism:\n\n- \\( \\sigma_1 \\): identity (does nothing)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_2 \\): \\( (x_1 x_4 x_3 x_2) \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_3 \\): \\( (x_1 x_3)(x_2 x_4) \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_4 \\): \\( (x_1 x_2)(x_3 x_4) \\)\n\nNow, to determine the structure of the Galois group, we need to see what group these permutations form.\n\nLet's consider the permutations in terms of the symmetric group \\( S_4 \\), since there are four roots.\n\nFirst, note that \\( \\sigma_2 \\) is a 4-cycle: \\( (x_1 x_4 x_3 x_2) \\).\n\n\\( \\sigma_3 \\) is a product of two disjoint transpositions: \\( (x_1 x_3)(x_2 x_4) \\).\n\n\\( \\sigma_4 \\) is also a product of two disjoint transpositions: \\( (x_1 x_2)(x_3 x_4) \\).\n\nNow, let's see the relations between these permutations.\n\nFirst, the order of \\( \\sigma_2 \\) is 4, since it's a 4-cycle.\n\nThe orders of \\( \\sigma_3 \\) and \\( \\sigma_4 \\) are both 2, since they are products of disjoint transpositions.\n\nNow, let's compute some compositions to see the group structure.\n\nCompute \\( \\sigma_2^2 \\):\n\n\\[ \\sigma_2^2: x_1 \\mapsto x_3 \\mapsto x_2 \\]\n\n\\[ x_2 \\mapsto x_4 \\mapsto x_1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_3 \\mapsto x_2 \\mapsto x_1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_4 \\mapsto x_1 \\mapsto x_4 \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.

In general, permutations do not commute, but in this specific case, these two permutations happen to commute.\n\nWait, but in general, products of disjoint transpositions commute, but here \\( \\sigma_3 \\) and \\( \\sigma_4 \\) are not disjoint; they share elements.\n\nWait, no, \\( \\sigma_3 = (x_1 x_3)(x_2 x_4) \\) and \\( \\sigma_4 = (x_1 x_2)(x_3 x_4) \\), so they are not disjoint; they affect the same elements.\n\nYet, in this case, \\( \\sigma_3 \\cdot \\sigma_4 = \\sigma_4 \\cdot \\sigma_3 = \\sigma_2 \\).\n\nThis is an interesting relation.\n\nNow, considering the relations:\n\n- \\( \\sigma_2^4 = \\text{identity} \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_3^2 = \\text{identity} \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_4^2 = \\text{identity} \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_3 \\cdot \\sigma_4 = \\sigma_2 \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_2^2 = \\sigma_3 \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_2^3 = \\sigma_4 \\)\n\nThis seems to suggest that the Galois group is generated by \\( \\sigma_2 \\), a 4-cycle, and that \\( \\sigma_3 \\) and \\( \\sigma_4 \\) are its squares and cubes, respectively.\n\nWait, no. From \\( \\sigma_2^2 = \\sigma_3 \\), and \\( \\sigma_2^3 = \\sigma_4 \\), that would imply that \\( \\sigma_3 \\) and \\( \\sigma_4 \\) are powers of \\( \\sigma_2 \\), but \\( \\sigma_3 \\) and \\( \\sigma_4 \\) are both of order 2, while \\( \\sigma_2 \\) is of order 4.\n\nBut in a cyclic group of order 4, the squares would be of order 2, which matches \\( \\sigma_3 \\), and the cube would be of order 4, which matches \\( \\sigma_4 \\), but wait, \\( \\sigma_4 \\) is of order 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me recall that in a cyclic group of order 4, say \\( \\langle \\sigma_2 \\rangle \\), the elements are:\n\n- \\( \\text{identity} \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_2 \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_2^2 \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_2^3 \\)\n\nAnd the orders are:\n\n- \\( \\sigma_2 \\): order 4\n\n- \\( \\sigma_2^2 \\): order 2\n\n- \\( \\sigma_2^3 \\): order 4\n\nBut in our case, \\( \\sigma_3 = \\sigma_2^2 \\), which is of order 2, and \\( \\sigma_4 = \\sigma_2^3 \\), which should be of order 4, but earlier we defined \\( \\sigma_4 \\) as \\( (x_1 x_2)(x_3 x_4) \\), which is a product of two disjoint transpositions and thus of order 2.\n\nThis is a contradiction because in a cyclic group of order 4, the element \\( \\sigma_2^3 \\) has order 4, but here \\( \\sigma_4 \\) has order 2.\n\nTherefore, the Galois group cannot be cyclic of order 4.\n\nSo, what's going on here?\n\nPerhaps the Galois group is the Klein four-group, which has four elements, all of order 2.\n\nBut wait, \\( \\sigma_2 \\) is of order 4, according to our earlier calculation, because it's a 4-cycle.\n\nBut in the Klein four-group, all non-identity elements are of order 2.\n\nSo, that can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Galois group is the dihedral group of order 4, which is isomorphic to the Klein four-group.\n\nWait, no, the dihedral group of order 4 is actually cyclic of order 4, corresponding to the symmetries of a square, but that's not correct.\n\nWait, the dihedral group \\( D_4 \\) has order 8, corresponding to the symmetries of a square.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing notations here.\n\nActually, the dihedral group \\( D_n \\) has order 2n.\n\nSo, \\( D_4 \\) has order 8, which is too big for our case.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of the quaternion group, but that's also order 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Galois group is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, but that would require all non-identity elements to be of order 2.\n\nBut in our case, \\( \\sigma_2 \\) is of order 4, as it's a 4-cycle.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought \\( \\sigma_2^2 = \\sigma_3 \\), which is of order 2, and \\( \\sigma_2^3 = \\sigma_4 \\), which is also of order 2, but that can't be, because in a cyclic group of order 4, \\( \\sigma_2^3 \\) should be of order 4.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps my assumption that \\( \\sigma_2^3 = \\sigma_4 \\) is incorrect.\n\nLet me double-check the composition.\n\nCompute \\( \\sigma_2^3 \\):\n\n\\[ \\sigma_2^3 = \\sigma_2 \\cdot \\sigma_2^2 = \\sigma_2 \\cdot \\sigma_3 \\]\n\nAs computed earlier, \\( \\sigma_2 \\cdot \\sigma_3 = (x_1 x_2)(x_3 x_4) = \\sigma_4 \\), which is of order 2.\n\nBut in a cyclic group of order 4, \\( \\sigma_2^3 \\) should be of order 4, but here \\( \\sigma_4 \\) is of order 2.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the Galois group is not cyclic.\n\nTherefore, the Galois group must be the Klein four-group, where all non-identity elements are of order 2.\n\nBut wait, in the Klein four-group, all non-identity elements are of order 2, but in our case, \\( \\sigma_2 \\) is a 4-cycle, which is of order 4.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nSo, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that \\( \\sigma_2^2 = \\sigma_3 \\).\n\nLet me re-examine that.\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\n\\[ \\sigma_2^2: x_1 \\mapsto x_3 \\]\n\n\\[ x_2 \\mapsto x_4 \\]\n\n\\[ x_3 \\mapsto x_2 \\]\n\n\\[ x_4 \\mapsto x_1 \\]\n\nWait, that's \\( (x_1 x_3)(x_2 x_4) \\), which is \\( \\sigma_3 \\), which is of order 2.\n\nBut in a cyclic group of order 4, \\( \\sigma_2^2 \\) should be of order 2, which matches.\n\nBut then \\( \\sigma_2^3 = \\sigma_2 \\cdot \\sigma_2^2 = \\sigma_2 \\cdot \\sigma_3 = \\sigma_4 \\), which is also of order 2.\n\nBut in a cyclic group of order 4, \\( \\sigma_2^3 \\) should be of order 4, but here \\( \\sigma_4 \\) is of order 2.\n\nThis suggests that our group is not cyclic.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the Galois group is the Klein four-group.\n\nBut in the Klein four-group, all non-identity elements are of order 2, but we have \\( \\sigma_2 \\), which is a 4-cycle and should be of order 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconsider the order of \\( \\sigma_2 \\).\n\nLet me compute \\( \\sigma_2^4 \\):\n\n\\[ \\sigma_2^4 = \\sigma_2 \\cdot \\sigma_2^3 = \\sigma_2 \\cdot \\sigma_4 \\]\n\nFrom earlier, \\( \\sigma_2 \\cdot \\sigma_4 = \\sigma_2 \\cdot \\sigma_2 \\cdot \\sigma_3 = \\sigma_2^2 \\cdot \\sigma_3 = \\sigma_3 \\cdot \\sigma_3 = \\text{identity} \\)\n\nWait, that suggests that \\( \\sigma_2^4 = \\text{identity} \\), which is consistent with \\( \\sigma_2 \\) being of order 4.\n\nBut in the Klein four-group, all elements have order dividing 2, so it can't be that.\n\nTherefore, the Galois group is not the Klein four-group.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the dihedral group of order 4, which is isomorphic to the Klein four-group.\n\nWait, no, the dihedral group of order 4 is actually cyclic, I think.\n\nWait, no, the dihedral group \\( D_2 \\) is of order 4 and is isomorphic to the Klein four-group.\n\nBut earlier analysis shows that our group has an element of order 4, namely \\( \\sigma_2 \\), so it can't be the Klein four-group.\n\nTherefore, perhaps it's the cyclic group of order 4.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that \\( \\sigma_2^3 = \\sigma_4 \\), which is of order 2, but in a cyclic group of order 4, \\( \\sigma_2^3 \\) should be of order 4.\n\nThis suggests a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express \\( \\sigma_4 \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the degrees of the extensions.\n\nWe have \\( K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\), which is a degree 4 extension of \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\).\n\nThe Galois group should be of order 4.\n\nNow, in a Galois extension, the Galois group is isomorphic to the group of automorphisms that fix the base field.\n\nGiven that, and considering the automorphisms we have:\n\n- Identity\n\n- \\( \\sigma_2 \\): 4-cycle\n\n- \\( \\sigma_3 \\): product of two transpositions\n\n- \\( \\sigma_4 \\): product of two transpositions\n\nBut in a cyclic group of order 4, the generators have order 4, and the square of the generator has order 2.\n\nSo, perhaps it's cyclic after all.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the Klein four-group, but that seems inconsistent with the orders.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming \\( \\sigma_4 \\) is of order 2.\n\nLet me check \\( \\sigma_4^2 \\):\n\n\\[ \\sigma_4^2: x_1 \\mapsto x_2 \\mapsto x_1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_2 \\mapsto x_1 \\mapsto x_2 \\]\n\n\\[ x_3 \\mapsto x_4 \\mapsto x_3 \\]\n\n\\[ x_4 \\mapsto x_3 \\mapsto x_4 \\]\n\nSo, \\( \\sigma_4^2 \\) is the identity, confirming that \\( \\sigma_4 \\) is of order 2.\n\nSimilarly, \\( \\sigma_3^2 \\) is the identity.\n\nBut \\( \\sigma_2^2 = \\sigma_3 \\), which is of order 2, so \\( \\sigma_2^4 = (\\sigma_2^2)^2 = \\sigma_3^2 = \\text{identity} \\), which is consistent.\n\nNow, in a cyclic group of order 4, say \\( \\langle \\sigma_2 \\rangle \\), the elements are:\n\n- \\( \\text{identity} \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_2 \\) (order 4)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_2^2 \\) (order 2)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_2^3 \\) (order 4)\n\nBut in our case, \\( \\sigma_2^3 = \\sigma_4 \\), which is of order 2, not 4.\n\nThis suggests that our group is not cyclic.\n\nTherefore, the only other group of order 4 is the Klein four-group, but that requires all non-identity elements to be of order 2, which contradicts \\( \\sigma_2 \\) being of order 4.\n\nThis seems like a contradiction.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in assuming that \\( \\sigma_2^3 = \\sigma_4 \\).\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n\\[ \\sigma_2^2 = \\sigma_3 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_2^3 = \\sigma_2 \\cdot \\sigma_3 = \\sigma_4 \\]\n\nBut \\( \\sigma_4 \\) is of order 2, whereas in a cyclic group, \\( \\sigma_2^3 \\) should be of order 4.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the group is not cyclic.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the Galois group is the Klein four-group, and there is an error in my earlier assumption about the order of \\( \\sigma_2 \\).\n\nLet me consider that maybe \\( \\sigma_2 \\) is actually of order 2.\n\nWait, but \\( \\sigma_2 \\) is a 4-cycle, which should be of order 4.\n\nUnless, perhaps, in this specific context, the 4-cycle corresponds to an element of order 2.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense, because a 4-cycle has order 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misidentified the permutation corresponding to \\( \\sigma_2 \\).\n\nLet me re-examine \\( \\sigma_2 \\):\n\n\\[ \\sigma_2(x_1) = -\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = x_4 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_2(x_2) = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = x_1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_2(x_3) = -\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} = x_2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_2(x_4) = \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} = x_3 \\]\n\nSo, \\( \\sigma_2 \\): \\( x_1 \\mapsto x_4 \\), \\( x_4 \\mapsto x_3 \\), \\( x_3 \\mapsto x_2 \\), \\( x_2 \\mapsto x_1 \\), which is indeed a 4-cycle: \\( (x_1 x_4 x_3 x_2) \\), and should have order 4.\n\nBut in our earlier composition, \\( \\sigma_2^2 = \\sigma_3 \\), which is of order 2, and \\( \\sigma_2^3 = \\sigma_4 \\), which is also of order 2.\n\nThis suggests that \\( \\sigma_2^3 \\) should be of order 4 in a cyclic group, but here it's of order 2.\n\nThis inconsistency implies that the group is not cyclic.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the Galois group is the Klein four-group, and there is a mistake in considering \\( \\sigma_2 \\) as a 4-cycle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Galois group is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 4, which is the Klein four-group.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the Klein four-group requires all non-identity elements to be of order 2, which contradicts \\( \\sigma_2 \\) being of order 4.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the Galois group is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, and that \\( \\sigma_2 \\), despite appearing as a 4-cycle, actually has order 2 in this context.\n\nLet me check \\( \\sigma_2^2 \\):\n\n\\[ \\sigma_2^2(x_1) = \\sigma_2(\\sigma_2(x_1)) = \\sigma_2(x_4) = x_3 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_2^2(x_2) = \\sigma_2(\\sigma_2(x_2)) = \\sigma_2(x_1) = x_4 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_2^2(x_3) = \\sigma_2(\\sigma_2(x_3)) = \\sigma_2(x_2) = x_1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_2^2(x_4) = \\sigma_2(\\sigma_2(x_4)) = \\sigma_2(x_3) = x_2 \\]\n\nSo, \\( \\sigma_2^2 = (x_1 x_3)(x_2 x_4) = \\sigma_3 \\), which is of order 2.\n\nThen, \\( \\sigma_2^4 = (\\sigma_2^2)^2 = \\sigma_3^2 = \\text{identity} \\), so \\( \\sigma_2^4 = \\text{identity} \\), implying that the order of \\( \\sigma_2 \\) divides 4.\n\nBut earlier, I thought \\( \\sigma_2 \\) is a 4-cycle and should have order 4, but in this group, \\( \\sigma_2^4 = \\text{identity} \\), and \\( \\sigma_2^2 \\) is of order 2.\n\nWait, but in the Klein four-group, all elements have order dividing 2.\n\nSo, if \\( \\sigma_2^2 = \\sigma_3 \\), and \\( \\sigma_3^2 = \\text{identity} \\), then \\( \\sigma_2^4 = \\text{identity} \\), but also \\( \\sigma_2^2 = \\sigma_3 \\), which is of order 2.\n\nThis suggests that \\( \\sigma_2^2 = \\sigma_3 \\), and \\( \\sigma_2^4 = \\text{identity} \\), but \\( \\sigma_2^3 = \\sigma_4 \\), which is also of order 2.\n\nThis seems inconsistent with \\( \\sigma_2 \\) being of order 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the group is the Klein four-group, and \\( \\sigma_2 \\) is actually of order 2, but appears as a 4-cycle due to some specific properties of the extension.\n\nThis is getting too confusing.\n\nMaybe I should consider another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Galois group is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 8, but that seems unlikely since our group has only 4 elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in considering the degrees of the extensions.\n\nWait, perhaps the extension is not Galois, but that can't be, because it's the splitting field of a separable polynomial, so it must be Galois.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misidentified the roots or the automorphisms.\n\nLet me double-check the roots.\n\nThe polynomial is \\( x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 \\).\n\nLet me compute the discriminant to get an idea of the Galois group.\n\nFor a quartic polynomial \\( x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d \\), the discriminant \\( D \\) is given by a certain formula, but I don't remember it off the top of my head.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider resolvent cubics or other invariants, but that might be too advanced for my current level.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the fixed fields corresponding to each automorphism.\n\nFor example, the fixed field of \\( \\sigma_2 \\) should be \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})^{\\langle \\sigma_2 \\rangle} \\), which would be the subfield fixed by \\( \\sigma_2 \\).\n\nBut this seems too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the tower of extensions:\n\n\\( \\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\), with each extension being quadratic.\n\nThen, the Galois group should be isomorphic to the Klein four-group, which is consistent with the extensions being abelian.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that \\( \\sigma_2 \\) is of order 4, which contradicts that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this case, the Galois group is indeed the Klein four-group, and my earlier assumption about \\( \\sigma_2 \\) being of order 4 is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps in this specific extension, the 4-cycle corresponds to an element of order 2.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense, because a 4-cycle should have order 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way I'm labeling the roots is causing confusion.\n\nLet me try redefining the roots.\n\nLet \\( \\alpha = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\), \\( \\beta = \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} \\), \\( \\gamma = -\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\), \\( \\delta = -\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nThen, the automorphisms are:\n\n- \\( \\sigma_1 \\): identity\n\n- \\( \\sigma_2 \\): \\( \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2} \\), \\( \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3} \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_3 \\): \\( \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2} \\), \\( \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3} \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_4 \\): \\( \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2} \\), \\( \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3} \\)\n\nNow, apply these to the roots:\n\n- \\( \\sigma_2(\\alpha) = (-\\sqrt{2}) + \\sqrt{3} = \\gamma \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_2(\\beta) = (-\\sqrt{2}) - \\sqrt{3} = \\delta \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_2(\\gamma) = \\sigma_2(-\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = \\alpha \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_2(\\delta) = \\sigma_2(-\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} = \\beta \\)\n\nSo, \\( \\sigma_2 \\) maps: \\( \\alpha \\mapsto \\gamma \\), \\( \\beta \\mapsto \\delta \\), \\( \\gamma \\mapsto \\alpha \\), \\( \\delta \\mapsto \\beta \\), which is a product of two transpositions: \\( (\\alpha \\gamma)(\\beta \\delta) \\), which is of order 2.\n\nWait a minute, earlier I thought \\( \\sigma_2 \\) was a 4-cycle, but now it seems to be a product of two transpositions.\n\nWhere did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I see the mistake. In my earlier calculations, I incorrectly identified the permutation corresponding to \\( \\sigma_2 \\). It's actually a product of two transpositions, not a 4-cycle.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nGiven \\( \\sigma_2 \\):\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ \\alpha = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = \\gamma \\]\n\n\\[ \\beta = \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} = \\delta \\]\n\n\\[ \\gamma = -\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = \\alpha \\]\n\n\\[ \\delta = -\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} = \\beta \\]\n\nSo, \\( \\sigma_2 \\) acts as \\( (\\alpha \\gamma)(\\beta \\delta) \\), which is a product of two transpositions, and thus of order 2.\n\nSimilarly, \\( \\sigma_3 \\):\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ \\alpha = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} = \\beta \\]\n\n\\[ \\beta = \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = \\alpha \\]\n\n\\[ \\gamma = -\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} = \\delta \\]\n\n\\[ \\delta = -\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = \\gamma \\]\n\nSo, \\( \\sigma_3 \\) acts as \\( (\\alpha \\beta)(\\gamma \\delta) \\), also a product of two transpositions, order 2.\n\nFinally, \\( \\sigma_4 \\):\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ \\alpha = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} = \\delta \\]\n\n\\[ \\beta = \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = \\gamma \\]\n\n\\[ \\gamma = -\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} = \\beta \\]\n\n\\[ \\delta = -\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = \\alpha \\]\n\nSo, \\( \\sigma_4 \\) acts as \\( (\\alpha \\delta)(\\beta \\gamma) \\), again a product of two transpositions, order 2.\n\nNow, all non-identity automorphisms are of order 2, which suggests that the Galois group is the Klein four-group.\n\nLet me confirm this.\n\nThe Klein four-group has the following multiplication table:\n\n- Identity\n\n- \\( a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = \\text{identity} \\)\n\n- \\( ab = c \\), \\( ac = b \\), \\( bc = a \\)\n\nIn our case, let's set:\n\n- \\( \\sigma_1 = \\text{identity} \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_2 = a \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_3 = b \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_4 = c \\)\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ \\sigma_2 \\cdot \\sigma_3 = a \\cdot b = c = \\sigma_4 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_2 \\cdot \\sigma_4 = a \\cdot c = b = \\sigma_3 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_3 \\cdot \\sigma_4 = b \\cdot c = a = \\sigma_2 \\]\n\nThis matches the relations in the Klein four-group.\n\nTherefore, the Galois group is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, also known as \\( V_4 \\) or \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n\nSo, the Galois group of the polynomial \\( x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) is the Klein four-group.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{V_4 \\text{ or } \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2} \\]"
