        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains leaving from different cities at the same time and heading towards each other. City A and City B are 450 miles apart. The first train from City A is going at 60 mph, and the second train from City B is going at 90 mph. I need to find out when they will pass each other.\n\nFirst, I should understand that since they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. So, the combined speed is 60 mph + 90 mph = 150 mph. That means together, they're closing the distance between them at a rate of 150 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the total distance between the two cities is 450 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nTime = 450 miles / 150 mph = 3 hours\n\nThat means they will meet 3 hours after they start.\n\nSince both trains leave at 3 pm, I just need to add 3 hours to that time.\n\n3 pm + 3 hours = 6 pm\n\nSo, the trains will pass each other at 6 pm.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach this differently to confirm.\n\nLet's think about the individual distances each train travels in time t.\n\nFor the first train from City A:\n\nDistance = speed * time = 60 mph * t\n\nFor the second train from City B:\n\nDistance = 90 mph * t\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the sum of these distances should equal the total distance between the cities, which is 450 miles.\n\nSo:\n\n60t + 90t = 450\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n150t = 450\n\nNow, solving for t:\n\nt = 450 / 150 = 3 hours\n\nAgain, that's 3 hours, so 6 pm.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how much distance they cover together per hour. Every hour, they close the gap by 150 miles, so 450 miles divided by 150 miles per hour is indeed 3 hours.\n\nI think that's solid. No need to change the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6\\ \\text{pm}} \\]"
