        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about apples and oranges in a basket. Let me try to work through it step by step.\n\nStarting with 8 apples in the basket.\n\nFirst, I remove 3 apples and replace them with 3 oranges. So, after this step:\n\nApples left: 8 - 3 = 5 apples\n\nOranges added: 3 oranges\n\nSo, total fruits in the basket are still 8, but now there are 5 apples and 3 oranges.\n\nNext, I remove 2 more apples and replace them with 2 oranges.\n\nApples left: 5 - 2 = 3 apples\n\nOranges added: 3 + 2 = 5 oranges\n\nAgain, total fruits are still 8, but now it's 3 apples and 5 oranges.\n\nFinally, I remove 1 apple and replace it with an orange.\n\nApples left: 3 - 1 = 2 apples\n\nOranges added: 5 + 1 = 6 oranges\n\nTotal fruits remain 8, with 2 apples and 6 oranges.\n\nSo, the number of apples left in the basket is 2.\n\nWait a minute, that seemed straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nStart: 8 apples\n\nFirst removal: remove 3 apples, add 3 oranges\n\nApples: 8 - 3 = 5\n\nOranges: 0 + 3 = 3\n\nTotal: 5 apples + 3 oranges = 8 fruits\n\nSecond removal: remove 2 apples, add 2 oranges\n\nApples: 5 - 2 = 3\n\nOranges: 3 + 2 = 5\n\nTotal: 3 apples + 5 oranges = 8 fruits\n\nThird removal: remove 1 apple, add 1 orange\n\nApples: 3 - 1 = 2\n\nOranges: 5 + 1 = 6\n\nTotal: 2 apples + 6 oranges = 8 fruits\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final number of apples in the basket is 2.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it. Let's consider the total number of apples removed.\n\nTotal apples removed: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 apples\n\nStarting with 8 apples, minus 6 apples removed, that leaves 2 apples.\n\nThe oranges added don't affect the count of apples, so the final number of apples should indeed be 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a series of transactions.\n\nTransaction 1: -3 apples, +3 oranges\n\nTransaction 2: -2 apples, +2 oranges\n\nTransaction 3: -1 apple, +1 orange\n\nTotal change: -6 apples, +6 oranges\n\nStarting with 8 apples and 0 oranges, after all transactions:\n\nApples: 8 - 6 = 2\n\nOranges: 0 + 6 = 6\n\nAgain, 2 apples left.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The answer should be 2 apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
