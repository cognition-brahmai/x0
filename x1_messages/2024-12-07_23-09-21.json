        "content": "Let's break this down. The car rental company charges $20 per day and $0.15 per mile. The customer rents the car for 3 days and drives 150 miles. So, I need to calculate the total cost.\n\nFirst, the daily rental cost: $20 per day for 3 days. That should be $20 multiplied by 3, which is $60.\n\nNext, the mileage cost: $0.15 per mile for 150 miles. So, $0.15 multiplied by 150 equals... let's see, 0.15 times 100 is $15, and 0.15 times 50 is $7.50, so total mileage cost is $15 plus $7.50, which is $22.50.\n\nNow, add the daily rental cost and the mileage cost together: $60 plus $22.50 equals $82.50.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can do it another way to confirm.\n\nTotal cost = (number of days * daily rate) + (number of miles * per mile rate)\n\nSo, (3 * 20) + (150 * 0.15) = 60 + 22.50 = 82.50.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the total fixed cost plus the variable cost based on miles driven.\n\nThe fixed cost is the rental for 3 days, which is $60, and the variable cost is $22.50, totaling $82.50.\n\nI think that's the correct total amount the customer will be charged.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{82.50} \\]"
