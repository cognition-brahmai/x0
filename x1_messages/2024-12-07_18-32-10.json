        "content": "First, I need to figure out how many miles the car has traveled and then convert that distance into kilometers.\n\nSo, the car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for 4 hours. To find the distance in miles, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDistance = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 4 hours = 240 miles\n\nNow, I need to convert miles to kilometers. I know that 1 mile is approximately equal to 1.60934 kilometers.\n\nSo, to convert 240 miles to kilometers:\n\nDistance in kilometers = 240 miles \u00d7 1.60934 kilometers/mile\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n240 \u00d7 1.60934 = 386.2416 kilometers\n\nSo, the car has traveled approximately 386.24 kilometers.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that conversion factor to make sure I have it right. I've heard that 1 mile is about 1.6 kilometers, but I think 1.60934 is more precise.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\nYes, 1 mile is exactly 1.60934 kilometers.\n\nSo, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the approximate value of 1.6 kilometers per mile to get a rough estimate:\n\n240 miles \u00d7 1.6 kilometers/mile = 384 kilometers\n\nBut using the more precise conversion factor gives me 386.2416 kilometers.\n\nProbably, for most practical purposes, 386 kilometers is accurate enough.\n\nBut if I want to be more precise, I can round it to two decimal places, which would be 386.24 kilometers.\n\nAlternatively, depending on the context, sometimes rounding to the nearest whole number is sufficient.\n\nIn this case, since the speed and time are given with what seems like reasonable precision, I'll go with 386.24 kilometers.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the speed is given as 60 miles per hour, which is exact, and the time is 4 hours, which is also exact.\n\nTherefore, the distance in miles is exactly 240 miles.\n\nAnd using the exact conversion factor, the distance in kilometers is exactly 240 \u00d7 1.60934 = 386.2416 kilometers.\n\nIf I want to report this with appropriate significant figures, I need to consider the precision of the input values.\n\nThe speed is given as 60 miles per hour, which has two significant figures, and the time is 4 hours, which also has one significant figure.\n\nActually, \"4 hours\" can be considered to have one significant figure, while \"60 miles per hour\" has two significant figures.\n\nThe rule for multiplication is that the result should have the same number of significant figures as the input with the least number of significant figures.\n\nIn this case, that's one significant figure from \"4 hours.\"\n\nSo, the distance in miles should be reported as 300 miles (one significant figure).\n\nBut that seems a bit imprecise.\n\nWait, perhaps \"4 hours\" is intended to have one significant figure, but in practice, it might be measured more precisely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's safe to assume that \"4 hours\" has two significant figures, especially since \"60 miles per hour\" has two.\n\nBut to be cautious, I'll proceed with two significant figures.\n\nSo, 240 miles, which is 2.4 \u00d7 10^2 miles.\n\nNow, converting to kilometers:\n\n2.4 \u00d7 10^2 miles \u00d7 1.60934 kilometers/mile = 3.8624064 \u00d7 10^2 kilometers\n\nRounded to two significant figures, that's 3.9 \u00d7 10^2 kilometers, or 390 kilometers.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider \"4 hours\" to have one significant figure, then the distance should be reported as 400 kilometers.\n\nBut that seems too imprecise.\n\nMaybe in this context, it's better to assume that \"4 hours\" has two significant figures.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is approximately 386 kilometers, which can be rounded to 390 kilometers when considering significant figures.\n\nAlternatively, if more precision is desired, 386 kilometers is acceptable.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with 386 kilometers as the distance traveled by the car.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{386 \\text{ kilometers}} \\]"
