        "content": "So I've got this right triangle, and the legs are 5 inches and 12 inches long. I need to find out how long the hypotenuse is. I remember there's a formula for this, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Can you help me out?\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what's being asked. A right triangle has one right angle, and the sides are called legs and the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle, and it's the longest side of the triangle. So, in this case, I have the lengths of the two legs: 5 inches and 12 inches. I need to find the length of the hypotenuse.\n\n**Recalling the Formula**\n\nI think the Pythagorean theorem is what I need here. It's a formula that relates the lengths of the sides in a right triangle. The theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two legs (a and b). So, it's something like a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2. That sounds familiar.\n\n**Applying the Formula**\n\nOkay, so if a and b are the legs, and c is the hypotenuse, then I can plug in the values I have. Here, a = 5 inches and b = 12 inches. So, plugging into the formula:\n\n5\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n\nCalculating the squares:\n\n25 + 144 = c\u00b2\n\nAdding those up:\n\n169 = c\u00b2\n\nNow, to find c, I need to take the square root of both sides:\n\nc = \u221a169\n\nWhich is:\n\nc = 13 inches\n\nSo, the hypotenuse is 13 inches long.\n\n**Verifying the Answer**\n\nLet me just double-check that I did this correctly. The Pythagorean theorem does apply to right triangles, and I correctly identified the legs and the hypotenuse. I squared the lengths of the legs, added them together, and then took the square root of the sum to find the hypotenuse. That seems right.\n\nI also recall that there are some common right triangles with integer side lengths, like 3-4-5 and 5-12-13. Wait a minute, 5 and 12 are part of a 5-12-13 triangle. So, yeah, that matches what I calculated. I feel confident now that the hypotenuse is indeed 13 inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
