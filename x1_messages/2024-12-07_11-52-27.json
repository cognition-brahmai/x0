I've been meaning to write to you for a while now, but I've been so busy with Quidditch practice and homework that I never seemed to find the time. But today, I finally sat down to put my thoughts on parchment, and I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for our friendship.\n\nYou know, when we first met on the Hogwarts Express, I never could have imagined how much you would come to mean to me. You were so smart and bossy, but also kind and brave. And over the years, you've proven time and time again that you're one of the most loyal and selfless friends anyone could ask for.\n\nI don't think I can ever thank you enough for all the times you've stood by me, whether it was facing Voldemort, or just helping me with my homework. Your intelligence and quick thinking have saved my life more times than I can count, and I don't know what I would have done without you.\n\nBut beyond all that, you're just an amazing person to be around. You always know exactly what to say to make me feel better, and you're never afraid to speak your mind, even if it means disagreeing with me. I admire that about you so much.\n\nSo thank you, Hermione. Thank you for being my friend, for believing in me, and for always being there when I need you. I feel so lucky to have you in my life, and I promise to always be there for you too.\n\nWith all my gratitude,\n\nHarry"
