The producer-consumer problem is a classic synchronization problem in computer science, and using condition variables and mutex locks in C++ is a great way to handle it in a multi-threaded environment.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to develop this program:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - Producers generate random numbers and add them to a buffer.\n   - Consumers read numbers from the buffer and calculate the running average.\n   - We need to ensure that multiple producers and consumers can access the buffer without causing data inconsistencies.\n\n2. **Tools and Concepts:**\n   - **Mutex locks:** To protect the buffer from simultaneous access.\n   - **Condition variables:** To manage the waiting and signaling between producers and consumers.\n   - **Threads:** To run producers and consumers concurrently.\n\n3. **Design the Buffer:**\n   - Use a bounded buffer to store the numbers.\n   - Implement methods to add and remove numbers safely using mutex and condition variables.\n\n4. **Implement Producers:**\n   - Each producer thread generates a random number and adds it to the buffer.\n   - If the buffer is full, the producer should wait until space is available.\n\n5. **Implement Consumers:**\n   - Each consumer thread removes a number from the buffer and calculates the running average.\n   - If the buffer is empty, the consumer should wait until numbers are available.\n\n6. **Synchronization:**\n   - Use a mutex to guard access to the buffer.\n   - Use condition variables to signal when the buffer is no longer full (for producers) or no longer empty (for consumers).\n\n7. **Termination:**\n   - Decide on a mechanism to terminate the producer and consumer threads, such as a specific sentinel value or a shared flag.\n\n8. **Testing:**\n   - Ensure that the program handles multiple producers and consumers correctly.\n   - Verify that the running average is calculated accurately.\n\nLet's start by outlining the code structure.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we will create a multi-threaded C++ program that simulates the producer-consumer problem using condition variables and mutex locks. The program will have multiple producer threads generating random numbers and adding them to a shared buffer, and multiple consumer threads removing numbers from the buffer to calculate the running average.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Buffer Implementation:**\n   - Use a fixed-size buffer to store the numbers.\n   - Protect the buffer with a mutex to ensure exclusive access.\n   - Use condition variables to signal when the buffer is no longer full (for producers) or no longer empty (for consumers).\n\n2. **Producer Threads:**\n   - Generate random numbers and add them to the buffer.\n   - Wait if the buffer is full.\n\n3. **Consumer Threads:**\n   - Remove numbers from the buffer and calculate the running average.\n   - Wait if the buffer is empty.\n\n4. **Termination:**\n   - Use a flag to signal when all production is complete.\n   - Consumers terminate when no more data is expected and the buffer is empty.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <thread>\n#include <queue>\n#include <mutex>\n#include <condition_variable>\n#include <chrono>\n#include <numeric>\n#include <iomanip>\n\nclass ProducerConsumer {\npublic:\n    ProducerConsumer(size_t bufSize, size_t numProducers, size_t numConsumers)\n        : bufSize(bufSize), buffer(bufSize), mutex(), cvProduce(mutex), cvConsume(mutex), stop(false) {\n        for (size_t i = 0; i < numProducers; ++i) {\n            producers.push_back(std::thread(&ProducerConsumer::producer, this));\n        }\n        for (size_t i = 0; i < numConsumers; ++i) {\n            consumers.push_back(std::thread(&ProducerConsumer::consumer, this));\n        }\n    }\n\n    ~ProducerConsumer() {\n        {\n            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex);\n            stop = true;\n        }\n        cvProduce.notify_all();\n        cvConsume.notify_all();\n        for (auto& t : producers) {\n            t.join();\n        }\n        for (auto& t : consumers) {\n            t.join();\n        }\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    size_t bufSize;\n    std::queue<int> buffer;\n    std::mutex mutex;\n    std::condition_variable cvProduce;\n    std::condition_variable cvConsume;\n    bool stop;\n\n    std::vector<std::thread> producers;\n    std::vector<std::thread> consumers;\n\n    void producer() {\n        while (true) {\n            int num = rand() % 100 + 1; // Random number between 1 and 100\n            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex);\n            cvProduce.wait(lock, [this] { return buffer.size() < bufSize || stop; });\n            if (stop) break;\n            buffer.push(num);\n            std::cout << \"Produced: \" << num << \", Buffer size: \" << buffer.size() << std::endl;\n            cvConsume.notify_one();\n            std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));\n        }\n    }\n\n    void consumer() {\n        double sum = 0;\n        size_t count = 0;\n        while (true) {\n            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex);\n            cvConsume.wait(lock, [this] { return !buffer.empty() || stop; });\n            if (stop && buffer.empty()) break;\n            int num = buffer.front();\n            buffer.pop();\n            sum += num;\n            ++count;\n            double average = sum / count;\n            std::cout << \"Consumed: \" << num << \", Running Average: \" << std::fixed << std::setprecision(2) << average << \", Buffer size: \" << buffer.size() << std::endl;\n            cvProduce.notify_one();\n            std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(150));\n        }\n    }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    size_t bufSize = 5;\n    size_t numProducers = 3;\n    size_t numConsumers = 2;\n\n    ProducerConsumer pc(bufSize, numProducers, numConsumers);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Buffer Implementation:**\n   - A fixed-size queue (`std::queue`) is used to store the numbers.\n   - A mutex (`std::mutex`) ensures exclusive access to the buffer.\n   - Two condition variables (`std::condition_variable`) are used: one for producers to wait when the buffer is full, and one for consumers to wait when the buffer is empty.\n\n2. **Producer Threads:**\n   - Each producer generates a random number and attempts to add it to the buffer.\n   - If the buffer is full, the producer waits on the condition variable.\n   - Once space is available, the producer adds the number and notifies a consumer.\n\n3. **Consumer Threads:**\n   - Each consumer waits for numbers to be available in the buffer.\n   - When a number is consumed, it is used to update the running average.\n   - After consuming, the consumer notifies a producer to produce more if necessary.\n\n4. **Termination:**\n   - A boolean flag (`stop`) is set to true to indicate that no more production is needed.\n   - Consumers terminate after ensuring that the buffer is empty and no more production is expected.\n\nThis approach ensures that the buffer is handled correctly with proper synchronization, preventing data races and deadlocks."
