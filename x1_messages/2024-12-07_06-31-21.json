        "content": "Let's break this down. The car rental company charges a daily rate and an additional mileage fee. So, for renting the car for 3 days and driving 200 miles, I need to calculate both costs and then add them together.\n\nFirst, the daily charge: it's $25 per day. If I rent the car for 3 days, I'll multiply 25 by 3.\n\n25 * 3 = 75\n\nSo, the daily charge totals $75.\n\nNext, the mileage charge: it's $0.15 per mile. If I drive 200 miles, I'll multiply 0.15 by 200.\n\n0.15 * 200 = 30\n\nSo, the mileage charge is $30.\n\nNow, I'll add both charges together to find the total cost.\n\n75 + 30 = 105\n\nTherefore, the total cost to rent the car for 3 days and drive 200 miles would be $105.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]"
