        "content": "Let's see. The store sells apples in bags of 6, and John buys 3 bags. I need to find out how many apples he has in total.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. Each bag contains 6 apples, and John buys 3 of those bags. So, to find the total number of apples, I need to multiply the number of bags by the number of apples in each bag.\n\nSo, that would be 3 bags times 6 apples per bag.\n\nLet me write that down: 3 bags \u00d7 6 apples/bag.\n\nNow, when I multiply these, the \"bags\" unit will cancel out, and I'll be left with apples.\n\n3 \u00d7 6 = 18.\n\nSo, John has 18 apples.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using addition instead of multiplication.\n\nYes, since multiplication is essentially repeated addition. So, if each bag has 6 apples, and John buys 3 bags, I can add 6 apples three times.\n\nThat would be 6 + 6 + 6.\n\nLet me calculate that: 6 + 6 is 12, and 12 + 6 is 18.\n\nSo, again, I get 18 apples.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using division or something else.\n\nWell, since multiplication and division are inverses, I could think about it in terms of division, but it might not make as much sense in this context.\n\nFor example, if I had the total number of apples and wanted to find out how many bags that would be, I could divide by the number of apples per bag.\n\nBut in this case, I'm starting with the number of bags and multiplying by the number of apples per bag to get the total.\n\nSo, multiplication is the appropriate operation here.\n\nLet me just double-check if there's any other factor to consider. Is there any information given about apples being damaged or any apples being removed or added?\n\nNo, the problem simply states that bags contain 6 apples and John buys 3 bags.\n\nSo, no need to account for any additional or missing apples.\n\nTherefore, the total number of apples John has is 18.\n\nI think that's straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I can make it even more clear.\n\nLet me visualize this.\n\nImagine there are 3 bags, and each bag has 6 apples.\n\nSo, bag 1: 6 apples\n\nBag 2: 6 apples\n\nBag 3: 6 apples\n\nTotal apples = 6 + 6 + 6 = 18.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of multiplication, 3 bags \u00d7 6 apples/bag = 18 apples.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the answer is 18 apples.\n\nI don't see any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that 18 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
