This device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. It's often used to treat arrhythmias, which are irregularities in the heart's rhythm. While it can monitor heart rate and help manage certain heart conditions, its primary function is to regulate abnormal heart rhythms, not to deliver medication or replace the function of the heart entirely."
