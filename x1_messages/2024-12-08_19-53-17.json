        "content": "So in this group, 60% of people prefer tea over coffee, and there are 120 people in total. I need to find out how many more people prefer tea than coffee.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many people prefer tea. Since 60% prefer tea, I can calculate that by taking 60% of 120.\n\nSo, 60% of 120 is calculated as:\n\n0.60 * 120 = 72\n\nSo, 72 people prefer tea.\n\nNow, to find out how many prefer coffee, I can subtract the number of tea lovers from the total number of people.\n\n120 - 72 = 48\n\nSo, 48 people prefer coffee.\n\nNow, to find out how many more people prefer tea than coffee, I subtract the number of coffee lovers from the number of tea lovers.\n\n72 - 48 = 24\n\nTherefore, 24 more people prefer tea than coffee.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe by calculating the percentage that prefers coffee and then finding the difference in percentages.\n\nIf 60% prefer tea, then the remaining percentage prefers coffee.\n\n100% - 60% = 40%\n\nSo, 40% prefer coffee.\n\nNow, 40% of 120 is:\n\n0.40 * 120 = 48\n\nWhich matches what I found earlier.\n\nNow, the difference in percentages is:\n\n60% - 40% = 20%\n\nSo, 20% more people prefer tea than coffee.\n\nBut the question is asking for how many more people, not the percentage.\n\nSo, 20% of 120 is:\n\n0.20 * 120 = 24\n\nAgain, that's 24 people.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer: 24 more people prefer tea than coffee.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\nJust to double-check, I can add the number of tea and coffee lovers to see if it totals 120.\n\n72 + 48 = 120\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use proportions or ratios, but I think that's unnecessary in this case since the percentages are straightforward.\n\nAnother way is to think in terms of fractions.\n\n60% is the same as 3/5, since 60 divided by 100 is 3/5.\n\nSo, 3/5 of the group prefers tea.\n\n3/5 * 120 = 72, which matches earlier.\n\nSimilarly, 40% is 2/5.\n\n2/5 * 120 = 48, which also matches.\n\nDifference is still 24.\n\nI think I've confirmed the answer sufficiently.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
