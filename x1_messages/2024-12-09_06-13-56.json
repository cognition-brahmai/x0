        "content": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. The expression is (6^2 / 3) * 5 - 10. Okay, so first things first, I need to remember the order of operations. I think it's PEMDAS or something like that. PeMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, I'll follow that.\n\nStarting with the parentheses: (6^2 / 3). Inside the parentheses, I have an exponent and a division. According to PEMDAS, exponents come before division. So, first, I need to calculate 6 squared.\n\n6^2 is 6 times 6, which is 36. So, now the expression inside the parentheses is 36 / 3.\n\n36 divided by 3 is 12. So, the parentheses simplify to 12.\n\nNow, the expression is 12 * 5 - 10.\n\nNext, I have multiplication and subtraction. Multiplication comes before subtraction according to PEMDAS, so I'll do 12 multiplied by 5 first.\n\n12 * 5 is 60.\n\nNow, the expression is 60 - 10.\n\nFinally, 60 minus 10 is 50.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 50.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should plug the values again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting over:\n\n(6^2 / 3) * 5 - 10\n\nFirst, 6^2 is 36.\n\nThen, 36 / 3 is 12.\n\nThen, 12 * 5 is 60.\n\nFinally, 60 - 10 is 50.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it differently. Let's see.\n\nSometimes, the order of operations can be tricky, but in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the expression without the parentheses first.\n\nBut no, parentheses are supposed to be done first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the exponent first, so 6^2 is 36, then the expression becomes (36 / 3) * 5 - 10.\n\nThen, 36 / 3 is 12, so 12 * 5 is 60, and 60 - 10 is 50.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to misapply the order of operations, say, doing the division after multiplication, I might get a different answer, but that would be wrong.\n\nFor example, if I did 6^2 is 36, then divide by 3 which is 12, then multiply by 5 to get 60, and subtract 10 to get 50.\n\nAlternatively, if I incorrectly did the division after the multiplication, I might do 6^2 is 36, then multiply by 5 to get 180, then divide by 3 to get 60, then subtract 10 to get 50.\n\nWait, in this specific case, I still end up with 50, but that's just a coincidence.\n\nBecause actually, according to PEMDAS, multiplication and division are done from left to right.\n\nSo, in (6^2 / 3) * 5 - 10, after resolving the parentheses, it's 12 * 5 - 10.\n\nThen, multiplication before subtraction, so 12 * 5 is 60, then 60 - 10 is 50.\n\nYes, so the correct answer is indeed 50.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
