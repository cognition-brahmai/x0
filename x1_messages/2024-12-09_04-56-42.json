        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that. To monitor a directory for changes in Bash, we can use a combination of tools like `inotifywait` from the `inotify-tools` package, which is great for watching file system events in Linux.\n\nFirst, you need to make sure that `inotify-tools` is installed on your system. You can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install inotify-tools\n```\n\nOnce you have `inotify-tools` installed, you can create a Bash script that uses `inotifywait` to watch a specified directory for new files.\n\nHere's a simple script that does what you're asking for:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Check if the directory argument is provided\nif [ \"$#\" -ne 1 ]; then\n    echo \"Usage: $0 /path/to/directory\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n# Assign the first argument to the directory variable\ndirectory=\"$1\"\n\n# Check if the provided path is a directory\nif [ ! -d \"$directory\" ]; then\n    echo \"Error: $directory is not a valid directory.\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n# Watch the directory for new files\necho \"Monitoring $directory for new files...\"\ninotifywait -m -e create --format \"%w%f\" \"$directory\" | while read file\ndo\n    echo \"New file detected: $file\"\ndone\n```\n\nLet me explain what this script does:\n\n1. **Argument Check**: The script checks if exactly one argument is provided, which should be the directory path to monitor. If not, it prints usage information and exits.\n\n2. **Directory Validation**: It verifies that the provided path is indeed a directory. If not, it outputs an error message and exits.\n\n3. **Monitoring with inotifywait**:\n    - `inotifywait -m -e create --format \"%w%f\" \"$directory\"`: This command watches the specified directory for new files being created.\n        - `-m` makes `inotifywait` run in monitoring mode, meaning it will continue to watch for events indefinitely.\n        - `-e create` specifies that we're interested in the \"create\" event, which happens when a new file is added to the directory.\n        - `--format \"%w%f\"` formats the output to show the full path of the new file.\n    - The output of `inotifywait` is piped into a `while` loop that reads each new file event and prints a message indicating that a new file has been detected.\n\nTo use this script:\n\n1. Save it to a file, for example, `monitor_directory.sh`.\n\n2. Make the script executable:\n\n    ```bash\n    chmod +x monitor_directory.sh\n    ```\n\n3. Run the script, providing the directory you want to monitor as an argument:\n\n    ```bash\n    ./monitor_directory.sh /path/to/your/directory\n    ```\n\nNow, every time a new file is added to the specified directory, the script will print a message to the terminal indicating the path of the new file.\n\n**Note**: This script uses `inotifywait`, which is part of the `inotify-tools` package. Ensure that this package is installed on your system before running the script. Also, be aware that `inotifywait` may not be available on all Unix-like systems; it's primarily used on Linux systems.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
