But to be precise, while the Sahara is extremely hot, there are other deserts that can reach higher temperatures. For example, the Lut Desert in Iran has recorded some of the highest land surface temperatures on Earth. However, in terms of overall average temperatures, the Sahara is undoubtedly scorching. So, if we're talking about the largest hot desert in the world, the Sahara fits that description perfectly. But if we're pinpointing the absolute hottest, it might be a different one. What do you think?"
