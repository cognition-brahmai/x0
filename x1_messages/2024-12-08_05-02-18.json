        "content": "\"Fruitful Ventures\" is primarily using a digital marketing strategy for their new product. \n\nLet's break this down. Digital marketing encompasses various online marketing techniques aimed at promoting products or services through digital channels. In this case, \"Fruitful Ventures\" is employing several digital marketing tactics:\n\n1. **Social Media Advertisements:** They are running a series of advertisements on social media platforms. This is a key component of digital marketing, as it allows for targeted reach to specific demographics based on data analytics.\n\n2. **Influencer Partnerships:** Collaborating with influencers is another digital marketing strategy. Influencers can help boost brand credibility and reach a wider audience through their followers.\n\n3. **Promotional Events:** While events can be offline, if these are digital events or online webinars, they fall under digital marketing. Even if they are physical events, promoting them through digital channels would still be part of the digital marketing mix.\n\n4. **Customer Loyalty Program:** Offering discounts and special offers to repeat customers is a retention strategy that can be managed and promoted through digital channels, such as email marketing or mobile apps.\n\nGiven these points, the primary marketing strategy being used by \"Fruitful Ventures\" is digital marketing.\n\n**Option C: Digital marketing** is the correct answer.\n\nTo provide more context, let's briefly discuss why the other options are not the primary strategies in this scenario:\n\n**Option A: Direct marketing** typically involves communicating directly with customers through channels like email, mail, text messages, or phone calls. While \"Fruitful Ventures\" might be using some direct marketing techniques within their customer loyalty program, the main focus here is on broader digital advertising and influencer partnerships, which are more aligned with digital marketing.\n\n**Option B: Public relations (PR)** focuses on managing the spread of information between an organization and the public. PR activities might include press releases, media relations, and reputation management. Although PR could be a part of their overall marketing mix, the primary strategies mentioned\u2014advertisements, influencer partnerships, and promotional events\u2014are more directly associated with digital marketing.\n\n**Option D: Guerrilla marketing** is an unconventional and creative approach that aims to get maximum exposure with minimal resources. Examples include flash mobs, street art, or unusual promotions. While some promotional events could potentially be guerrilla marketing, the description provided doesn't specify that these events are unconventional or guerrilla in nature. Therefore, digital marketing remains the most accurate choice based on the information given.\n\nIn summary, \"Fruitful Ventures\" is chiefly utilizing digital marketing strategies to promote their new organic fruit juice product."
