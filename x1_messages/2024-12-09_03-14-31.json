        "content": "So there are 7 billion people on Earth, and each person takes up about 0.5 square meters of space. I need to find out how much total space all these people would take up if they stood side by side.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. We have a number of people and the space each one occupies. We need to find the total space occupied by all of them together.\n\nSo, the total space should be the number of people multiplied by the space each person takes up.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal space = number of people \u00d7 space per person\n\nNow, plugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal space = 7,000,000,000 people \u00d7 0.5 m\u00b2/person\n\nI can simplify this multiplication. Multiplying 7 billion by 0.5 is the same as multiplying 7 by 0.5 and then adding the zeros.\n\n7 \u00d7 0.5 = 3.5\n\nSo, 7,000,000,000 \u00d7 0.5 = 3,500,000,000 m\u00b2\n\nThat's 3.5 billion square meters.\n\nBut maybe it would be more understandable to convert this into larger units, like square kilometers.\n\nI know that 1 square kilometer is equal to 1,000,000 square meters.\n\nSo, to convert square meters to square kilometers, I divide by 1,000,000.\n\nTotal space in km\u00b2 = 3,500,000,000 m\u00b2 \u00f7 1,000,000 m\u00b2/km\u00b2 = 3,500 km\u00b2\n\nSo, all 7 billion people would take up 3,500 square kilometers if they stood side by side.\n\nTo get a sense of how much area that is, I can compare it to the size of some countries.\n\nFor example, the country of Luxembourg is about 2,586 square kilometers, so 3,500 km\u00b2 is a bit larger than Luxembourg.\n\nAlternatively, it's about the size of the state of Rhode Island in the USA, which is around 3,140 square kilometers.\n\nSo, in simple terms, if everyone on Earth stood side by side, they would cover an area roughly the size of Rhode Island or a bit larger than Luxembourg.\n\nThat's interesting to think about.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3500 \\text{ square kilometers}} \\]"
