Here's how I calculated it:\n\nFirst, list out the even numbers between 1 and 100: 2, 4, 6, ..., 98, 100.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 is 2, the common difference d is 2, and the last term an is 100.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\nSum = n/2 * (a1 + an)\n\nwhere n is the number of terms.\n\nFirst, we need to find n. We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\nan = a1 + (n - 1)d\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n100 = 2 + (n - 1)*2\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n98 = (n - 1)*2\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n49 = n - 1\n\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n\nn = 50\n\nNow plug n, a1, and an into the sum formula:\n\nSum = 50/2 * (2 + 100) = 25 * 102 = 2550\n\nSo, the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550."
