The proposed LED lighting system consumes only 300 watts per light. Calculate the total energy savings per hour if the stadium switches to LED lights, and determine how much money they can save on their electricity bill annually, assuming an average usage of 10 hours per day for 200 days a year and an electricity cost of $0.12 per kWh."

        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to calculate the energy savings per hour when the stadium switches from halogen lights to LED lights.\n\n1. **Calculate the total power consumption of the current halogen system per hour:**\n\n   - Number of halogen lights: 500\n\n   - Power per halogen light: 1,000 watts\n\n   Total power consumption (halogen) = Number of lights \u00d7 Power per light\n\n   Total power consumption (halogen) = 500 \u00d7 1,000 watts = 500,000 watts\n\n   Since 1 kilowatt (kW) = 1,000 watts, we can convert this to kilowatts:\n\n   Total power consumption (halogen) = 500,000 watts \u00f7 1,000 = 500 kW\n\n2. **Calculate the total power consumption of the proposed LED system per hour:**\n\n   - Number of LED lights: 500 (assuming the same number of lights)\n\n   - Power per LED light: 300 watts\n\n   Total power consumption (LED) = Number of lights \u00d7 Power per light\n\n   Total power consumption (LED) = 500 \u00d7 300 watts = 150,000 watts\n\n   Converting to kilowatts:\n\n   Total power consumption (LED) = 150,000 watts \u00f7 1,000 = 150 kW\n\n3. **Calculate the energy savings per hour:**\n\n   Energy savings per hour = Total power consumption (halogen) - Total power consumption (LED)\n\n   Energy savings per hour = 500 kW - 150 kW = 350 kW\n\n   So, the stadium saves 350 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per hour by switching to LED lights.\n\nNext, we need to determine the annual savings on the electricity bill.\n\n4. **Calculate the total energy savings per day:**\n\n   - Average usage per day: 10 hours\n\n   Total energy savings per day = Energy savings per hour \u00d7 Hours per day\n\n   Total energy savings per day = 350 kWh/hour \u00d7 10 hours = 3,500 kWh\n\n5. **Calculate the total energy savings per year:**\n\n   - Usage days per year: 200 days\n\n   Total energy savings per year = Total energy savings per day \u00d7 Days per year\n\n   Total energy savings per year = 3,500 kWh/day \u00d7 200 days = 700,000 kWh\n\n6. **Calculate the annual savings on the electricity bill:**\n\n   - Electricity cost: $0.12 per kWh\n\n   Annual savings = Total energy savings per year \u00d7 Electricity cost per kWh\n\n   Annual savings = 700,000 kWh \u00d7 $0.12/kWh = $84,000\n\nTherefore, by switching to LED lights, the stadium can save $84,000 on their electricity bill annually.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe total energy savings per hour is \\boxed{350 \\text{ kWh}}, and the annual savings on the electricity bill is \\boxed{84000 \\text{ dollars}}."
