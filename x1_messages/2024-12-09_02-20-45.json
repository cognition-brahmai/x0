        "content": "So, if a car is going at a steady 50 miles per hour, and you want to know how far it'll go in 3.5 hours, right? Well, to figure this out, we can use the basic formula for distance, which is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nIn this case, the speed is 50 miles per hour, and the time is 3.5 hours. So, plugging in the numbers:\n\nDistance = 50 miles/hour \u00d7 3.5 hours\n\nNow, when you multiply these, the hours unit cancels out, leaving you with miles. So:\n\nDistance = 50 \u00d7 3.5 miles\n\nTo make it easier, you can think of 3.5 as 3 + 0.5. So:\n\n50 \u00d7 3 = 150 miles\n\n50 \u00d7 0.5 = 25 miles\n\nAdd them together: 150 + 25 = 175 miles\n\nTherefore, the car will travel 175 miles in 3.5 hours at a constant speed of 50 miles per hour.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's double-check. Another way to think about it is to consider that in one hour, the car travels 50 miles. So in 3 hours, it would travel 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 miles. For the remaining 0.5 hour, it would travel half of 50 miles, which is 25 miles. Adding them up gives the same result: 150 + 25 = 175 miles.\n\nAlternatively, you could convert 3.5 hours into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3.5 hours is 3 hours plus 30 minutes. But that might complicate things unnecessary. Stick with the original method; it's straightforward.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the question is trying to trick me or something. Is there anything else I need to consider? Like, is the car accelerating or decelerating? No, it says it's traveling at a constant speed, so no need to worry about acceleration.\n\nAlso, is there any mention of obstacles or stops? Doesn't seem like it. So, we can assume the car is moving non-stop at 50 miles per hour for 3.5 hours.\n\nAnother thing to consider is units. Make sure that the units for speed and time are compatible. Here, speed is in miles per hour, and time is in hours, so they match perfectly.\n\nLet me consider if there's a more mathematical way to approach this. Speed is the rate of change of distance with respect to time. So, distance is the integral of speed over time. But since speed is constant, the integral is just speed multiplied by time, which brings us back to the original formula: distance = speed \u00d7 time.\n\nSo, no need to overcomplicate it with calculus; the basic formula works fine here.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's try using decimal multiplication directly:\n\n50 \u00d7 3.5\n\nTo multiply 50 by 3.5, you can think of 3.5 as 7/2.\n\nSo, 50 \u00d7 (7/2) = (50 \u00d7 7) / 2 = 350 / 2 = 175 miles\n\nSame answer again. Looks like 175 miles is the correct distance.\n\nLet me think about real-world implications. If a car is traveling at 50 mph, is that a typical speed? Well, 50 miles per hour is about 80 kilometers per hour, which is a common speed limit on highways in many countries. So, yes, it's a realistic speed.\n\nAlso, traveling for 3.5 hours at that speed would indeed cover 175 miles. To put that into perspective, that's roughly the distance between New York City and Philadelphia, for example.\n\nAlternatively, if you're more familiar with kilometers, 175 miles is approximately 282 kilometers.\n\nBut since the question is in miles, the answer should be in miles unless specified otherwise.\n\nWait, does the question specify the unit for the answer? Actually, it doesn't. But since the speed is given in miles per hour and time in hours, it makes sense to keep the distance in miles.\n\nJust to cover all bases, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect the distance traveled, like wind resistance or the car's fuel efficiency. But since the question states that the car is traveling at a constant speed, we can assume that external factors aren't affecting the speed, and thus, don't need to be considered for this calculation.\n\nMoreover, the question seems straightforward; it's a basic application of the distance formula. There aren't any tricks or additional variables to account for.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the car will travel 175 miles in 3.5 hours at a constant speed of 50 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{175} \\]"
