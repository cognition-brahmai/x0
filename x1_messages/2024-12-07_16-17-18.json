        "content": "To calculate the area under the curve y = x\u00b2 from x = 0 to x = 5, we need to use integral calculus. Specifically, we'll compute the definite integral of x\u00b2 with respect to x over the interval [0, 5].\n\nThe general formula for the area under the curve y = f(x) from x = a to x = b is given by:\n\nArea = \u222b from a to b of f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, f(x) = x\u00b2, a = 0, and b = 5.\n\nSo, Area = \u222b from 0 to 5 of x\u00b2 dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we first find the antiderivative of x\u00b2.\n\nThe antiderivative of x\u00b2 is (x\u00b3)/3.\n\nNow, we evaluate this antiderivative at the upper limit (x = 5) and subtract its value at the lower limit (x = 0).\n\nArea = [(5\u00b3)/3] - [(0\u00b3)/3]\n\nCalculating 5\u00b3:\n\n5\u00b3 = 125\n\nSo, (125)/3 - (0)/3 = 125/3 - 0 = 125/3\n\nTherefore, the area under the curve y = x\u00b2 from x = 0 to x = 5 is 125/3 square units.\n\nTo express it as a decimal, 125 divided by 3 is approximately 41.6667.\n\nSo, Area \u2248 41.6667 square units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{125}{3}} \\]"
