        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a bag with 5 red balls and 7 blue balls, making a total of 12 balls. We're picking 3 balls at random without replacement, and we want to find the probability that exactly 2 of them are red.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the formula for probability: it's the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the total number of possible ways to pick 3 balls out of 12 is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 12 and k = 3, so the total number of ways to choose 3 balls from 12 is C(12, 3).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(12, 3) = 12! / (3!(12 - 3)!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9!) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 9!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10) / 6 = 220.\n\nSo, there are 220 possible ways to choose any 3 balls from the bag.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to pick exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball.\n\nThere are 5 red balls and 7 blue balls.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 5 is C(5, 2), and the number of ways to choose 1 blue ball out of 7 is C(7, 1).\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is C(5, 2) \u00d7 C(7, 1).\n\nLet's calculate C(5, 2):\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5 - 2)!) = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 3!)) = (5 \u00d7 4) / 2 = 10.\n\nAnd C(7, 1) = 7! / (1!(7 - 1)!) = 7 / 1 = 7.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 10 \u00d7 7 = 70.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 70 / 220.\n\nWe can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 10: 7 / 22.\n\nSo, the probability is 7/22.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total number of ways to choose 3 balls from 12 is indeed C(12, 3) = 220.\n\nThen, for exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball, it's C(5, 2) \u00d7 C(7, 1) = 10 \u00d7 7 = 70.\n\nSo, probability is 70 / 220 = 7/22.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the problem in terms of sequential probabilities, considering the order in which the balls are picked.\n\nFor example, the probability of picking a red ball first, then another red ball, then a blue ball.\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter in this problem, the combination approach is more straightforward.\n\nStill, let's see if the sequential approach gives the same answer.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball first is 5/12.\n\nThen, without replacement, the probability of picking another red ball is now 4/11.\n\nThen, the probability of picking a blue ball is 7/10.\n\nSo, the probability of this sequence (red, red, blue) is (5/12) \u00d7 (4/11) \u00d7 (7/10).\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter, I need to consider all possible sequences where exactly 2 reds and 1 blue are picked.\n\nThese sequences are: RRB, RBR, BRR.\n\nEach of these has the same probability, so I can calculate one of them and multiply by 3.\n\nSo, probability of one sequence, say RRB, is (5/12) \u00d7 (4/11) \u00d7 (7/10).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 5/12 \u00d7 4/11 = (5 \u00d7 4) / (12 \u00d7 11) = 20 / 132 = 5/33.\n\nThen, 5/33 \u00d7 7/10 = (5 \u00d7 7) / (33 \u00d7 10) = 35 / 330 = 7/66.\n\nSince there are 3 such sequences, total probability is 3 \u00d7 (7/66) = 21/66 = 7/22.\n\nSo, again, we get 7/22.\n\nThat's reassuring, as it matches the previous result.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball is 7/22.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{22}} \\]"
