        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. So, you want a C++ program that calculates the factorial of an integer using recursion. Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a factorial is. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It's denoted by n!. For example, 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nIn recursion, a function calls itself with a smaller input until it reaches a base case, which is a case where the function doesn't call itself again. For factorial, the base case is when n is 0 or 1, because 0! = 1 and 1! = 1.\n\nSo, for our program, we'll write a recursive function that calculates the factorial. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. Include the necessary header files.\n2. Write the recursive function for factorial.\n3. In the main function, take an integer input from the user.\n4. Call the factorial function with the user's input and print the result.\n\nLet's write the code step by step.\n\nFirst, include the iostream header to use input and output streams.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n```\n\nNext, define the recursive factorial function. Let's name it `factorial`. It should take an integer n as input and return the factorial of n.\n\n```cpp\nint factorial(int n) {\n    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {\n        return 1;\n    } else {\n        return n * factorial(n - 1);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this function, if n is 0 or 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns n multiplied by the factorial of n-1, which is the recursive call.\n\nNow, in the `main` function, we need to take an integer input from the user and then call the `factorial` function with that input. Finally, we'll print the result.\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    int num;\n    std::cout << \"Enter a positive integer: \";\n    std::cin >> num;\n    if (num < 0) {\n        std::cout << \"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\" << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        int result = factorial(num);\n        std::cout << \"Factorial of \" << num << \" is \" << result << std::endl;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this `main` function, we first prompt the user to enter a positive integer. We read the input using `std::cin`. If the entered number is negative, we display a message saying that factorial is not defined for negative numbers. Otherwise, we calculate the factorial using the `factorial` function and print the result.\n\nThat's it! This program will calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further explanation."
