        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a rectangular garden that measures 20 feet by 30 feet, and I need to find its perimeter. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a rectangle is. A rectangle is a four-sided shape where opposite sides are equal in length and all angles are right angles, which means they're 90 degrees each.\n\nSo, in this garden, one pair of opposite sides is 20 feet each, and the other pair is 30 feet each. That makes sense because it's a rectangle.\n\nNow, the perimeter is the total distance around the edge of the shape. So, to find the perimeter of the garden, I need to add up the lengths of all four sides.\n\nLet me visualize this. If I imagine standing at one corner of the garden, I would walk 30 feet along one side, then 20 feet along the next side, then another 30 feet along the opposite side, and finally 20 feet back to the starting point. So, the perimeter would be 30 + 20 + 30 + 20 feet.\n\nBut there's probably a formula for this that can make it quicker. I recall that the perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width.\n\nIn this case, the length is 30 feet and the width is 20 feet. So, plugging those values into the formula, P = 2(30) + 2(20).\n\nLet me do the multiplication first: 2 times 30 is 60, and 2 times 20 is 40.\n\nNow, adding those together: 60 + 40 equals 100.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the garden is 100 feet.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this to double-check? Maybe using the concept of the perimeter being the sum of all sides.\n\nYes, as I thought earlier: 30 + 20 + 30 + 20 equals 100 feet.\n\nAlternatively, since opposite sides are equal, I could add the length and width and then multiply by 2.\n\nSo, 30 + 20 is 50, and 50 times 2 is 100 feet.\n\nHmm, all these methods lead me to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other factor that might affect the perimeter, like interior angles or something. But since it's a rectangle, and all angles are right angles, I don't think that affects the perimeter calculation.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. Both dimensions are given in feet, so the perimeter will indeed be in feet.\n\nOne more thing: sometimes, people get confused between perimeter and area. But in this case, the problem specifically asks for the perimeter, so I don't need to calculate the area.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The perimeter of the rectangular garden is 100 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
