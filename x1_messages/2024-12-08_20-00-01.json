        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains: one going from City A to City B that takes 6 hours, and another going from City B to City A that takes 8 hours. They start at the same time, and we need to find out how long it takes for them to meet.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the speeds of these trains. If the distance between City A and City B is, say, D miles, then the speed of the first train is D divided by 6 hours, right? So, speed = distance/time. Similarly, the speed of the second train is D divided by 8 hours.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n- Speed of Train 1 (from A to B): V1 = D / 6\n\n- Speed of Train 2 (from B to A): V2 = D / 8\n\nNow, since they're moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So, relative speed = V1 + V2.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nV1 + V2 = D/6 + D/8\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 8 is 24. So,\n\nV1 + V2 = (4D/24) + (3D/24) = (7D)/24\n\nSo, their relative speed is (7D)/24 per hour.\n\nNow, the initial distance between them is D miles. I need to find the time it takes for them to cover this distance at their relative speed.\n\nTime = Distance / Relative Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = D / (7D/24) = D * (24)/(7D) = 24/7 hours\n\n24 divided by 7 is approximately 3.4286 hours. To express it in hours and minutes, 0.4286 hours is about 25.71 minutes.\n\nSo, it's approximately 3 hours and 26 minutes.\n\nBut maybe I should check if there's a simpler way to think about this.\n\nAnother approach: let's assume the distance D is a specific value, say 24 miles, to make calculations easier since 24 is divisible by both 6 and 8.\n\n- Train 1: 24 miles in 6 hours \u2192 speed = 4 mph\n\n- Train 2: 24 miles in 8 hours \u2192 speed = 3 mph\n\nRelative speed = 4 + 3 = 7 mph\n\nTime to meet = distance / relative speed = 24 / 7 \u2248 3.4286 hours, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 24/7 hours, or approximately 3 hours and 26 minutes.\n\nBut maybe I should see if there's a formula for this kind of problem.\n\nI recall that when two objects are moving towards each other, the time to meet is the distance divided by the sum of their speeds.\n\nIn this case, it's exactly what I did.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of rates.\n\nLet me consider the fraction of the distance each train covers per hour.\n\n- Train 1 covers 1/6 of the distance per hour.\n\n- Train 2 covers 1/8 of the distance per hour.\n\nTogether, they cover 1/6 + 1/8 = 7/24 of the distance per hour.\n\nSo, the time to cover the whole distance is 1 / (7/24) = 24/7 hours.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think this confirms that 24/7 hours is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, perhaps I can consider the distance each train travels until they meet.\n\nLet\u2019s say they meet after t hours.\n\nIn t hours, Train 1 would have traveled a distance of (D/6)*t.\n\nTrain 2 would have traveled a distance of (D/8)*t.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the sum of these distances should equal the initial distance D.\n\nSo:\n\n(D/6)*t + (D/8)*t = D\n\nFactor out D and t:\n\nD*t*(1/6 + 1/8) = D\n\nDivide both sides by D:\n\nt*(1/6 + 1/8) = 1\n\nt*(7/24) = 1\n\nt = 24/7 hours\n\nSame answer again.\n\nI think it's clear now that the time it takes for the two trains to meet is 24/7 hours, which is approximately 3.4286 hours or 3 hours and 26 minutes.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify to provide the answer in minutes, I can leave it as 24/7 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to express it in hours and minutes, 24/7 hours is 3 hours plus 3/7 of an hour.\n\nSince 1 hour is 60 minutes, 3/7 of an hour is (3/7)*60 \u2248 25.71 minutes, which is approximately 26 minutes.\n\nSo, 3 hours and 26 minutes is a acceptable approximation.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't specify, I'll stick with the exact fraction: 24/7 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{7} \\text{ hours}} \\]"
