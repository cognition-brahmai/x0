        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a factory that produces two types of products, A and B. Each product A needs 3 hours of labor, and each product B needs 2 hours. The factory has only 60 hours of labor available each day. They make $50 profit on each A and $40 on each B. The question is, how many of each should they make to maximize their daily profit?\n\nAlright, first, I need to understand what's being asked. It seems like a optimization problem, where I have to maximize profit given a constraint on labor hours.\n\nLet me define some variables to make this clearer. Let's say:\n\n- Let x be the number of product A produced.\n\n- Let y be the number of product B produced.\n\nNow, each A takes 3 hours, and each B takes 2 hours, and total labor available is 60 hours. So, the labor constraint can be written as:\n\n3x + 2y \u2264 60\n\nAnd the profit from each A is $50, and from each B is $40. So, total profit P would be:\n\nP = 50x + 40y\n\nOur goal is to maximize P, given the constraint 3x + 2y \u2264 60.\n\nAlso, since we can't produce negative products, x \u2265 0 and y \u2265 0.\n\nThis looks like a linear programming problem, where we have linear inequalities and a linear objective function to maximize.\n\nTo solve this, I can graph the feasible region defined by the constraints and find the vertices. Then, evaluate the profit function at each vertex to find the maximum.\n\nFirst, let's graph the constraint 3x + 2y \u2264 60.\n\nTo graph this, it's helpful to find the intercepts.\n\nWhen x = 0:\n\n3(0) + 2y = 60 \u2192 y = 30\n\nWhen y = 0:\n\n3x + 2(0) = 60 \u2192 x = 20\n\nSo, the line 3x + 2y = 60 passes through (0,30) and (20,0).\n\nThe feasible region is below this line, including the axes where x \u2265 0 and y \u2265 0.\n\nNow, the vertices of the feasible region are:\n\n1. (0,0) - origin\n\n2. (20,0) - x-intercept\n\n3. (0,30) - y-intercept\n\nBut wait, is (0,30) actually feasible? Let's check:\n\n3(0) + 2(30) = 0 + 60 = 60, which is equal to 60, so yes.\n\nAlso, there might be another vertex where the constraint equation holds with equality, but in this case, it's already covered by (20,0) and (0,30).\n\nSo, the vertices are (0,0), (20,0), and (0,30).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the profit function P = 50x + 40y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0,0) = 50(0) + 40(0) = $0\n\n2. P(20,0) = 50(20) + 40(0) = $1000\n\n3. P(0,30) = 50(0) + 40(30) = $1200\n\nSo, based on this, producing 0 units of A and 30 units of B gives a higher profit of $1200 compared to producing 20 units of A and 0 units of B, which gives $1000.\n\nWait a minute, but let's see if there's a better combination inside the feasible region.\n\nMaybe there's a point where the profit is even higher.\n\nTo check this, I can see if there's a trade-off between A and B that could increase the profit.\n\nLet's see, for every unit of A I produce, I use 3 hours, and get $50 profit.\n\nFor every unit of B, I use 2 hours, and get $40 profit.\n\nSo, profit per hour for A is 50/3 \u2248 $16.67 per hour.\n\nFor B, it's 40/2 = $20 per hour.\n\nHmm, so B gives higher profit per hour.\n\nThat might suggest producing more B's.\n\nBut earlier, when I produced only B's, I got $1200.\n\nIs there a combination of A and B that could give more than $1200?\n\nLet me see if there's another vertex I haven't considered.\n\nWait, maybe there's a point where the constraint is active, and there's another intersection.\n\nBut in this case, with only one constraint and the non-negativity constraints, the feasible region is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (20,0), and (0,30).\n\nSo, unless the profit function suggests otherwise, the maximum should be at one of these vertices.\n\nBut maybe I can consider producing a combination of A and B.\n\nLet me see, suppose I produce some A and some B.\n\nLet's see, maybe find where the profit is maximized.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but that might be overkill for this linear problem.\n\nAlternatively, since it's linear, the maximum should occur at a vertex, but in this case, (0,30) gives $1200, which is higher than (20,0) giving $1000.\n\nIs there a way to produce some A and some B that gives more than $1200?\n\nLet me try to see.\n\nSuppose I produce 10 units of A and 15 units of B.\n\nLet's check if this is feasible:\n\n3(10) + 2(15) = 30 + 30 = 60 hours, which is exactly 60 hours.\n\nNow, profit would be:\n\nP = 50(10) + 40(15) = 500 + 600 = $1100\n\nWhich is less than $1200.\n\nSo, producing only B's gives higher profit.\n\nWhat if I produce 15 units of A and 7.5 units of B.\n\nWait, but I can't produce half units, probably.\n\nAssuming fractional units are allowed, let's see.\n\n3(15) + 2(7.5) = 45 + 15 = 60 hours.\n\nProfit: 50(15) + 40(7.5) = 750 + 300 = $1050\n\nStill less than $1200.\n\nWhat if I produce 5 units of A and 22.5 units of B.\n\n3(5) + 2(22.5) = 15 + 45 = 60 hours.\n\nProfit: 50(5) + 40(22.5) = 250 + 900 = $1150\n\nStill less than $1200.\n\nWhat if I produce 0 units of A and 30 units of B: $1200.\n\nSeems like producing only B's gives the highest profit.\n\nWait, but let's see, maybe there's a better combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the profit per hour more carefully.\n\nProfit per hour for A is $16.67, for B is $20.\n\nSo, B is more profitable per hour.\n\nTherefore, to maximize profit, given limited hours, producing only B's makes sense.\n\nBecause you get more profit per hour spent on B than on A.\n\nHence, using all 60 hours to produce B's gives the maximum profit.\n\nTherefore, the factory should produce 0 units of A and 30 units of B to maximize daily profit at $1200.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf I produce 10 units of A and 15 units of B, as before, profit is $1100, which is less.\n\nIf I produce 20 units of A and 0 units of B, profit is $1000, which is less.\n\nIf I produce 0 units of A and 30 units of B, profit is $1200.\n\nSeems like the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, if I produce, say, 10 units of A and 15 units of B, profit is $1100.\n\nStill less than $1200.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a combination where I produce a few A's and many B's.\n\nLet me try producing 5 units of A and 22.5 units of B.\n\nBut again, that gives $1150, which is less than $1200.\n\nAlternatively, producing 2 units of A and 27 units of B.\n\n3(2) + 2(27) = 6 + 54 = 60 hours.\n\nProfit: 50(2) + 40(27) = 100 + 1080 = $1180\n\nStill less than $1200.\n\nWhat if I produce 1 unit of A and 28.5 units of B.\n\n3(1) + 2(28.5) = 3 + 57 = 60 hours.\n\nProfit: 50(1) + 40(28.5) = 50 + 1140 = $1190\n\nStill less than $1200.\n\nApproaching $1200, but not exceeding it.\n\nSimilarly, producing 0 units of A and 30 units of B gives exactly $1200.\n\nSo, it seems like producing only B's maximizes the profit.\n\nTherefore, the factory should produce 0 units of A and 30 units of B to maximize their daily profit at $1200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0 \\text{ units of A and } 30 \\text{ units of B for a maximum profit of } \\$1200} \\]"
