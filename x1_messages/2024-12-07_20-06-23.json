He\\'s beating Hillary Clinton. Right now, with 14 percent of the precincts reporting, Obama has 52 percent to Hillary Clinton\\'s 46 percent. That lead probably will increase as the night goes on. Right now, 20,641 votes for Obama to 18,370 votes for Hillary Clinton. Remember, it\\'s early. Thirty-three delegates -- pledged delegates -- at stake tonight, seven super-delegates in the State of Mississippi. The next big contest, April 22, six weeks from today, in Pennsylvania. You\\'re going to be hearing a lot about the counties, the cities in Pennsylvania. There\\'s another important story we\\'re following, as well, and that involves the New York governor, Eliot Spitzer -- the sex scandal that\\'s unfolded. I want to bring John King in -- John, a lot of speculation tonight -- will this governor resign, will he be forced out? What is going on? Update our viewers on what we know. KING: Wolf, we are told flatly by a number of Democratic sources here in New York who are familiar with and, in some cases, involved in these conversations, that it is a matter of when, not a matter of if, Governor Eliot Spitzer will resign. And I was told by three sources who have good knowledge of these conversations and negotiations tonight that there is an attempt to orchestrate a resignation as early as tomorrow. The political track of that, I\\'m told, is going quite well. And that would involve submitting an official resignation and then a transfer of power -- the swearing in of New York\\'s lieutenant governor as its next governor. But there also are very important and critical legal negotiations involved. Governor Spitzer wants to do this as a package, if you will, and essentially negotiate with federal prosecutors. They\\'re also checking into possible state law violations to make sure that if he does some sort of a plea deal, it is done as a package and resolves his legal issues at once. So there are several sources saying that they believe this could be resolved as early as tomorrow. But they also are saying be careful and be cautious because of the sensitivity of the legal side of the conversations and negotiations. Until all of the documents are reviewed, until all the deals are finalized, it could collapse. But there are political operatives working for the governor and working for the lieutenant governor and others who are negotiating a scenario to orchestrate all this out. And some of the sources believe strongly it could happen as early as tomorrow. BLITZER: All right. I want to bring in -- thanks, John. I want to go out to Hawaii right now. We\\'ve tracked down our senior legal analyst, Jeff Toobin. You thought you might have the night off. Jeff, you have no night off. You\\'re joining us right now. And you have some unique perspective on Eliot Spitzer. You went to law school with him at Harvard Law School. You know this individual. There are some reports that even some of his advisers are saying, you know what, governor, fight it out, you can win this, don\\'t resign. But you just heard John King say it\\'s not a matter -- based on what he\\'s hearing -- not a matter of if, but when. Give us a little perspective on what you think is going on. JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Well, I know that there are plea negotiations in works and, as John said, a package deal. This is Spitzer\\'s best option at this point. He can promise to leave, but he\\'ll say -- as he\\'s saying to prosecutors -- look, I will only leave if I can tie up all of my potential criminal liability, know plead guilty to perhaps a misdemeanor, to some minor crime and be done to with it. He\\'s not going to quit unless he can also wrap up his legal problems. And that\\'s what the negotiations are going on. Michelle Hershman, who used to be one of his proteges in the New York attorney general\\'s office -- is now in private practice -- she\\'s representing him with Michael Garcia, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. That\\'s the negotiation that\\'s going on. But there is no doubt that his political career is over. His governorship is over. And the speed and drama of his fall is like nothing that I\\'ve ever seen in politics. BLITZER: It is breath-taking. Let\\'s talk about the law for a second. The Associated Press reporting that he may have spent, transferred some 80,000 dollars over a period of time to this prostitution ring. We don\\'t have that. We don\\'t know that. That\\'s what the Associated Press is reporting. But the federal investigation supposedly is involved in money transfer, what they call structuring. What\\'s the crime here potentially? Explain that to our viewers, Jeff. TOOBIN: Well, federal law for a long time has held that if you engage in any transaction of 5,000 dollars or more in cash, something called the Currency Transaction Report, a CTF has to be filed by the person receiving the cash. In response to that law, a lot of criminals, particularly drug dealers, started structuring transactions. They would deposit $4,900 in a bunch of different banks to avoid the requirement. That is a crime. Structuring is a crime. The question is, did Spitzer, in paying for these prostitutes, structures his cash transactions in such a way that CTRs wouldn\\'t be file. Why this is so significant is while being a John, patronizing a prostitute, is a minor crime, a misdemeanor at best, structuring transactions is money laundering, and is a felony. If prosecutors have that on Spitzer, that would be a much more complicated plea bargain and expose him to much greater criminal liability. I don\\'t know that there are -- there\\'s that evidence, but if there is, there\\'s a much more serious legal problem for Spitzer. BLITZER: According to \"The New York Times\" that crime structuring, money laundering, or moving money around to conceal its purpose, that carries with it potentially a five-year prison sentence. We spoke earlier though with Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor, who said that whole law was designed to deal with drug dealers and serious crime, not the kind of crime that\\'s alleged in this particular case. Is there a different standards? Are they using this money laundering part to go after someone who was involved with prostitutes? TOOBIN: Dershowitz is clearly right. That was the intent of the law. He\\'s wrong that it can\\'t be applied elsewhere. It has been applied elsewhere, to all kinds of white-collar criminal investigations. It\\'s, in fact, a routine part of white-collar investigations, to see if transactions were structured. So, there is absolutely nothing stopping the U.S. attorney from charging Spitzer with structuring, if in fact he did it in aid of hiring prostitutes. That\\'s just not any sort of legal defense. BLITZER: Jeff, as someone who went to law school with Eliot Spitzer, and someone who\\'s known for him for many years, what was your reaction yesterday when you heard this bombshell report? TOOBIN: Well, I have rarely been as shocked by a news story as I was by this one, because Eliot Spitzer, starting when I met him in 1983, was the straightest of the straight arrows. I met him when he was working with Alan Dershowitz of Claus Von Bulow\\'s defense, his appeal. One of the sort of jokes around the law school, what\\'s a total straight arrow like Eliot Spitzer doing working for a sleazy high-life character like Claus Von Bulow? That\\'s been the touch stone of his career. He has been this figure of rectitude, this rather arrogant, to many people, prosecutor. But what goes around comes around. You only need to see the joy on Wall Street and read it in today\\'s \"Wall Street Journal,\" how happy that his many targets are that Spitzer is getting his. The idea that Eliot Spitzer and Silda Spitzer, his wife, who was also in law school with us, that they\\'re enduring this family tragedy is just horrific to contemplate. BLITZER: Stand by, Jeff. We\\'ll continue our coverage of this. You know, Campbell, they called him the sheriff of Wall Street, Eliot Ness. He was a tough, no-nonsense prosecutor when he was the attorney general of New York state in 2004. He prosecuted -- he went after a prostitution ring, a high end prostitution ring in Staten Island. And, as Jeff said, this is about the last person you would have expected to find himself in this sort of affair. BROWN: It\\'s striking what Jeff pointed out and what you saw today, a lot of joy. I mean, this was a guy who had a lot of enemies. BORGER: -- is the word that everybody seems to be using, to see people taking joy in what\\'s occurred to him. I think it\\'s not so much that he prosecuted these folks on Wall Street or prostitution rings, in reading the pieces today. It was that he seemed to take so much pleasure in it, and didn\\'t, you know -- made people make perp walks when they didn\\'t really have to and that kind of thing. BROWN: Show-boating? BORGER: Show-boating a little. I think also, politically, quite frankly, in Albany, he doesn\\'t have a lot of friends in either party. That can come back and bite you in the rear end. BROWN: Hypocrisy? KING: There\\'s -- you hear, Republicans, but Republicans aren\\'t known to be overly partisan. This guy was so self-righteous as a prosecutor. The bigger calculation is the Democrats in this state. They\\'re hoping to gain some seats in a presidential year. New York would be Democratic. The balance of the state Senate is one or two seats. If the lieutenant governor becomes governor, the Democrats would need to win two seats. They know their chances. Down the ballot are dependent on having a good year. This is the last thing the New York State Democratic party wants. They want this to be over and they want it to be over now. BROWN: Let me take a walk back here. Both presidential candidates trying to stay as far as away from this as humanly possible. But Hillary Clinton\\'s from the state of New York. An issue for her or not really, Mark? HALPERIN: I think if it goes away quickly, it probably isn\\'t. It certainly brings up sex scandals, not the Clinton\\'s favorite topic. But, it does show just how precarious this race is. We try to factor everything into, will this give one side an advantage? She doesn\\'t lose a super delegate, because the lieutenant governor would become a super delegate. BROWN: He\\'s already a super delegate, I think. I read today. Maybe I\\'m wrong. HALPERIN: I don\\'t think he is. If he is then you\\'re right. BROWN: Even though we\\'re talking about one super delegate. HALPERIN: I think he\\'ll probably, as John King suggested, handle this relatively quickly, and I think it will get it off the national stage and voters in places like Pennsylvania will have better things to be concerned about, like the economy. MARTIN: For the average voter, this isn\\'t a matter of who he went after on Wall Street or that he was Eliot Ness. It boils down to the simple fact that this is a governor who simply destroyed the credibility and integrity of his office. This was not just what -- these days, after Bill Clinton, what we call a normal affair. This is a case of someone who was involved with a prostitute. People don\\'t want to see mayors, governors involved in these kinds of things. In Detroit right now, the city council voted on a resolution trying to get rid of Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. Why? Because he was having an affair with his chief of staff. That\\'s not what people expect. I think the anger is that you\\'re a governor. You know better. You know what, you need to get out of office, because that\\'s not the kind of behavior we want, because if you succumb to that, the question is, what will you succumb to next. BROWN: OK, they\\'re telling me, too, that the lieutenant governor is a super delegate. If she resigns, she would be down one super delegate. Leslie, have we heard the worst of this, too? Still more to come on this story? SANCHEZ: That\\'s probably the bigger issue. I have to agree with Roland. It\\'s a violation of public trust. Regardless of the Republican or Democrat, that\\'s really someone who\\'s representing the voters of New Mexico -- New Mexico? New York. Thank you. SANCHEZ: The real issue is the violation of public trust. I do go back to the super delegate issue. I think it\\'s something -- that\\'s a reason you haven\\'t heard anything from Hillary Clinton. It is a very difficult position to put that candidate in or any candidate. I think there\\'s more to be heard in that area. BROWN: We\\'re going to take a quick break. A reminder to everybody, go to CNNPolitics.com. We\\'ve got a lot going on online. We\\'re going to have a Lot more to come on the Mississippi vote, presidential politics. More on this topic as well. We\\'ll be right back.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 10 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
