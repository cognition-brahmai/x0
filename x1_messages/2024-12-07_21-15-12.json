        "content": "So, the farmer has 5 hens, and each hen lays 2 eggs per day. We need to find out how many eggs the farmer will have after one week.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many eggs are laid per day by all the hens together. Since each hen lays 2 eggs per day, and there are 5 hens, we can multiply the number of hens by the number of eggs each lays per day:\n\n5 hens * 2 eggs/hen/day = 10 eggs per day\n\nNow, we need to find out how many eggs are laid in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so we can multiply the daily egg production by 7:\n\n10 eggs/day * 7 days = 70 eggs\n\nSo, after one week, the farmer will have 70 eggs.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's make sure we're considering everything. Are there any other factors that could affect the total number of eggs? For example, does the farmer sell any eggs during the week, or are there any eggs that get broken? The problem doesn't mention anything about that, so we can assume that all the eggs laid are collected and kept by the farmer.\n\nAlso, we should confirm the number of days in a week. Typically, a week has 7 days, but if the problem specifies a different number, we should adjust accordingly. In this case, it's standard, so we'll stick with 7 days.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations:\n\n- Number of hens: 5\n\n- Eggs per hen per day: 2\n\n- Total eggs per day: 5 * 2 = 10\n\n- Number of days in a week: 7\n\n- Total eggs in one week: 10 * 7 = 70\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could think of it in terms of each hen's weekly production. If one hen lays 2 eggs per day, then in one week, one hen lays:\n\n2 eggs/day * 7 days = 14 eggs\n\nWith 5 hens, the total would be:\n\n5 hens * 14 eggs/hen = 70 eggs\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation, so we can be confident that 70 is the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the total number of hen-days. There are 5 hens over 7 days, which is:\n\n5 hens * 7 days = 35 hen-days\n\nSince each hen-day produces 2 eggs, the total number of eggs is:\n\n35 hen-days * 2 eggs/hen-day = 70 eggs\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think no matter how we approach it, the answer remains consistent. The farmer will have 70 eggs after one week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]"
