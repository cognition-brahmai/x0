        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Let's create a Python function that generates Fibonacci numbers up to a given limit using an iterative approach. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how we can achieve this:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We'll start by initializing the first two Fibonacci numbers, which are 0 and 1.\n2. **Iteration**: We'll use a loop to generate subsequent Fibonacci numbers by adding the last two numbers in the sequence.\n3. **Limit Check**: We'll continue this process until the next Fibonacci number exceeds the given limit.\n4. **Storing Results**: We'll store the Fibonacci numbers in a list and return this list once the limit is reached.\n\nLet's write the code accordingly:\n\n```python\ndef generate_fibonacci(limit):\n    # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    # List to store the Fibonacci numbers\n    fibonacci_numbers = []\n    \n    # Iterate until the next Fibonacci number exceeds the limit\n    while a <= limit:\n        # Append the current Fibonacci number to the list\n        fibonacci_numbers.append(a)\n        # Update the values of a and b\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    \n    return fibonacci_numbers\n\n# Example usage\nlimit = 100\nprint(generate_fibonacci(limit))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We set `a` and `b` to 0 and 1, respectively, which are the first two Fibonacci numbers.\n2. **List Initialization**: We create an empty list `fibonacci_numbers` to store the sequence.\n3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `a` (the current Fibonacci number) is less than or equal to the given limit.\n4. **Appending to List**: Inside the loop, we append the current Fibonacci number `a` to the list.\n5. **Updating Values**: We update `a` to `b` and `b` to `a + b` to get the next Fibonacci number.\n6. **Return Result**: Once the loop exits, we return the list of Fibonacci numbers.\n\nThis approach ensures that we generate Fibonacci numbers efficiently without recursion, which can be problematic for large limits due to stack overflow issues. The iterative method is both simple and efficient for this purpose."
