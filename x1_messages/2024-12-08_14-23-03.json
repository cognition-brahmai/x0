        "content": "Let's see. So, the store is offering a discount where the price is reduced by 20% each day, and the original price is $100. I need to find out what the price would be after 5 days.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a 20% discount means. A 20% discount means that each day, the price is reduced by 20% of its current value. So, each day, the price is 80% of the previous day's price because 100% - 20% = 80%.\n\nSo, if the original price is $100, after the first day, the price would be $100 multiplied by 0.8, which is $80.\n\nThen, on the second day, the price would be $80 multiplied by 0.8 again, which is $64.\n\nContinuing this pattern, on the third day, it would be $64 times 0.8, which is $51.20.\n\nOn the fourth day, $51.20 times 0.8 is $40.96.\n\nAnd finally, on the fifth day, $40.96 times 0.8 is $32.768.\n\nSo, after 5 days, the price would be approximately $32.77.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to calculate this without doing it day by day? I think there is a formula for exponential decay or something similar here.\n\nYes, since the price is reduced by a constant percentage each day, this is an example of exponential decay. The formula for exponential decay is:\n\n\\[ \\text{final amount} = \\text{initial amount} \\times (1 - \\text{rate})^{\\text{time}} \\]\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is $100, the rate is 20% or 0.20, and the time is 5 days.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{final price} = 100 \\times (1 - 0.20)^5 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{final price} = 100 \\times (0.80)^5 \\]\n\nNow, calculating \\(0.80^5\\):\n\n\\[ 0.80^5 = 0.80 \\times 0.80 \\times 0.80 \\times 0.80 \\times 0.80 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.80 \\times 0.80 = 0.64 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.64 \\times 0.80 = 0.512 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.512 \\times 0.80 = 0.4096 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.4096 \\times 0.80 = 0.32768 \\]\n\nSo, multiplying by the initial amount:\n\n\\[ \\text{final price} = 100 \\times 0.32768 = 32.768 \\]\n\nRounded to two decimal places, that's $32.77.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier by calculating day by day. It's good to see that both methods give the same result.\n\nI think that's the answer: after 5 days, the price would be approximately $32.77.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32.77} \\]"
