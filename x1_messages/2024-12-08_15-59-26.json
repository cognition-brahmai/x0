        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. I have a bag with 4 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. So, in total, there are 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 balls in the bag.\n\nThe question is about finding the probability of drawing a red ball followed by a blue ball without replacement. That means once I draw the first ball, I don't put it back into the bag before drawing the second one.\n\nOkay, so probability of drawing a red ball first. There are 4 red balls out of 9 total balls, so the probability for that is 4/9.\n\nNow, after drawing a red ball, I don't replace it, so now there are 8 balls left in the bag. The number of blue balls remains 3 because I only drew a red ball.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a blue ball next is 3 out of 8, which is 3/8.\n\nTo find the overall probability of both events happening in sequence\u2014first drawing a red ball and then a blue ball\u2014I need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, overall probability = (probability of first event) \u00d7 (probability of second event given the first has occurred)\n\nIn this case, it's (4/9) \u00d7 (3/8).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n(4/9) \u00d7 (3/8) = (4 \u00d7 3) / (9 \u00d7 8) = 12 / 72 = 1/6.\n\nWait, but I should double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 9 without replacement is C(9,2), which is 36.\n\nThe number of ways to draw a red ball first and then a blue ball would be:\n\nNumber of red balls times number of blue balls, but since the order matters here, it's not just combinations but permutations.\n\nActually, perhaps it's better to stick with the initial approach.\n\nAlternatively, the number of ways to first draw a red ball and then a blue ball is 4 (red) \u00d7 3 (blue) = 12.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes for drawing two balls without replacement is 9 \u00d7 8 = 72.\n\nSo, the probability is 12/72 = 1/6.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the combination approach, C(4,1) for red and C(3,1) for blue, and total C(9,2), but since order matters here, it's not directly applicable.\n\nWait, no. In combinations, order doesn't matter, but in this problem, order does matter because it's \"first draw red, then draw blue.\"\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to stick with the initial approach of multiplying the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the total permutations.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 9 in a specific order is P(9,2) = 9 \u00d7 8 = 72.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is number of ways to draw a red first and then a blue, which is 4 (red) \u00d7 3 (blue) = 12.\n\nTherefore, probability = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 12 / 72 = 1/6.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the probability of drawing a red first, which is 4/9, and then given that, the probability of drawing a blue next, which is 3/8, and multiply them together, which again gives 1/6.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, I'm getting 1/6 as the probability.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose I consider all possible sequences of drawing two balls without replacement and count how many of those sequences are red followed by blue.\n\nTotal sequences: 9 first draws and 8 second draws, so 72 possible sequences.\n\nFavorable sequences: 4 reds and for each red, 3 blues, so 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 favorable sequences.\n\nTherefore, probability is 12/72 = 1/6.\n\nYeah, I think that's solid.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider it as a conditional probability:\n\nProbability of drawing a blue ball on the second draw given that the first draw was red.\n\nSo, P(Blue second | Red first) = Number of blue balls / Total balls remaining after first draw = 3/8.\n\nAnd the probability of drawing a red first is 4/9.\n\nSo, P(Red first and Blue second) = P(Red first) \u00d7 P(Blue second | Red first) = (4/9) \u00d7 (3/8) = 1/6.\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently from different angles.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a red ball followed by a blue ball without replacement is 1/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{6}} \\]"
