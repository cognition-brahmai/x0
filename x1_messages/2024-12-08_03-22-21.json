        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces 150 widgets per hour. But there's a catch: every 2 hours, the machines need a 10-minute break for maintenance. We need to find out how many widgets are produced in a full 24-hour period.\n\nFirst, let's understand the production cycle. The factory works for 2 hours and then takes a 10-minute break. So, each cycle consists of 2 hours of production plus 10 minutes of break time.\n\nLet's convert everything to minutes to make calculations easier. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\n- Production time per cycle: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes\n\n- Break time per cycle: 10 minutes\n\n- Total cycle time: 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 130 minutes\n\nNow, in a 24-hour period, there are 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes.\n\nWe need to find out how many complete cycles fit into 1440 minutes.\n\nNumber of cycles = Total time available / Cycle time\n\nNumber of cycles = 1440 minutes / 130 minutes/cycle\n\nWhen we divide 1440 by 130, we get:\n\n1440 \u00f7 130 \u2248 11.0769\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a cycle in this context, we'll consider only complete cycles. So, there are 11 full cycles in 24 hours.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total production time. Since each cycle has 120 minutes of production time:\n\nTotal production time = Number of cycles * Production time per cycle\n\nTotal production time = 11 * 120 minutes = 1320 minutes\n\nNow, the factory produces 150 widgets per hour, which is 150 widgets/60 minutes = 2.5 widgets per minute.\n\nSo, total widgets produced in production time = Total production time * Production rate\n\nTotal widgets = 1320 minutes * 2.5 widgets/minute = 3300 widgets\n\nWait a minute, but there might be some leftover time after the 11 cycles. Earlier, we had 1440 minutes total, and each cycle is 130 minutes, so:\n\nTotal time for 11 cycles = 11 * 130 = 1430 minutes\n\nRemaining time = 1440 minutes - 1430 minutes = 10 minutes\n\nNow, in these remaining 10 minutes, the factory could be either in production or in a break, depending on the cycle pattern.\n\nLet's think about the sequence of cycles. Each cycle is 120 minutes production followed by 10 minutes break.\n\nSo, after 11 cycles:\n\n- 11 cycles * 120 minutes production = 1320 minutes production\n\n- 11 cycles * 10 minutes break = 110 minutes breaks\n\nTotal time used: 1320 + 110 = 1430 minutes\n\nRemaining time: 1440 - 1430 = 10 minutes\n\nNow, would these 10 minutes be used for production or another break?\n\nTypically, after the break, the production starts again. So, after the 11th break, the factory would start the 12th production cycle.\n\nBut since the full 120 minutes of the 12th cycle wouldn't fit (only 10 minutes are left), the factory would produce for those 10 minutes.\n\nSo, we need to add the production for these additional 10 minutes.\n\nProduction in additional time = 10 minutes * 2.5 widgets/minute = 25 widgets\n\nTherefore, total widgets produced = 3300 + 25 = 3325 widgets\n\nWait, but is this correct? Let's double-check.\n\nTotal time available: 1440 minutes\n\nTime used by 11 cycles:\n\n- Production: 11 * 120 = 1320 minutes\n\n- Breaks: 11 * 10 = 110 minutes\n\nTotal time used: 1320 + 110 = 1430 minutes\n\nRemaining time: 1440 - 1430 = 10 minutes\n\nSince the remaining 10 minutes are less than the production time of 120 minutes, the factory can't complete another full production cycle, but it can use these 10 minutes for production, as breaks are only taken after every 2 hours of production.\n\nTherefore, the factory would produce for an additional 10 minutes.\n\nSo, total production time = 1320 minutes + 10 minutes = 1330 minutes\n\nTotal widgets = 1330 minutes * 2.5 widgets/minute = 3325 widgets\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate it as:\n\n- 11 full cycles: 11 * 120 minutes = 1320 minutes production\n\n- Additional 10 minutes production\n\n- Total production time: 1320 + 10 = 1330 minutes\n\n- Total widgets: 1330 * 2.5 = 3325 widgets\n\nBut let's consider another perspective. Maybe the break after the 11th cycle isn't taken because the 24-hour period ends.\n\nWait, in our earlier calculation, the 11 cycles take 1430 minutes, and with an additional 10 minutes, it reaches 1440 minutes.\n\nBut according to the cycle pattern, after the 11th production cycle, there would be a 10-minute break, which would bring the total time to 1430 minutes (11*130 minutes).\n\nThen, in the remaining 10 minutes, the factory starts the 12th production cycle.\n\nSo, no additional break is taken after the 11th break because the total time is up.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces for an additional 10 minutes beyond the 11 cycles.\n\nHence, the total production time is 1320 minutes (from 11 cycles) plus 10 minutes, totaling 1330 minutes.\n\nTherefore, total widgets produced = 1330 * 2.5 = 3325 widgets.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor to account for.\n\nIs there a possibility that the factory doesn't produce for the entire 120 minutes in the last cycle due to the time constraints?\n\nWait, in our earlier approach, we're assuming that the additional 10 minutes are used entirely for production.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory follows the pattern strictly, after every 120 minutes of production, there is a 10-minute break.\n\nBut in the last part, since only 10 minutes are left, perhaps no production can happen, as a production cycle requires 120 minutes.\n\nWait, this introduces some ambiguity.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nLet's consider the sequence of production and break times.\n\nStarting from time t=0:\n\n- t=0 to t=120: production\n\n- t=120 to t=130: break\n\n- t=130 to t=250: production\n\n- t=250 to t=260: break\n\n- and so on...\n\nEach cycle is 130 minutes (120 production + 10 break).\n\nAfter 11 cycles:\n\n- Total time: 11 * 130 = 1430 minutes\n\n- Which includes 11 * 120 = 1320 minutes of production and 11 * 10 = 110 minutes of breaks\n\nRemaining time: 1440 - 1430 = 10 minutes\n\nIn these 10 minutes, the factory starts another production cycle, which would be production time since breaks are only after every 120 minutes of production.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces for an additional 10 minutes.\n\nThus, total production time is 1320 + 10 = 1330 minutes.\n\nProduction rate is 2.5 widgets per minute.\n\nTotal widgets = 1330 * 2.5 = 3325 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the last 10 minutes might not be enough to start a new production cycle, but since production cycles can be interrupted by breaks only after 120 minutes, the factory can produce for the remaining 10 minutes without taking another break.\n\nTherefore, the initial calculation seems correct.\n\nSo, the factory produces 3325 widgets in a 24-hour period.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3325} \\]"
