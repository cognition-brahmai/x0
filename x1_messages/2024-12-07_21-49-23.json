        "content": "In the context of creative writing, the term 'show, don't tell' primarily refers to B. The technique of giving the reader information through actions and details rather than explicit narration.\n\nTo elaborate, 'show, don't tell' is a principle that encourages writers to allow readers to experience a story through sensory details and actions, rather than being told about it directly. This approach makes the writing more engaging and immersive, as it allows readers to interpret and connect with the story on a deeper level.\n\nFor example, instead of stating that a character is sad (\"John was sad\"), which is telling, a writer might describe John's actions and surroundings to convey his emotional state (\"John trudged along, his shoulders slumped, and his eyes fixed on the damp pavement. The rain matched his mood, drizzling steadily as he walked.\"). This shows John's sadness through his body language and the atmospheric details, allowing readers to infer his emotional state rather than being explicitly told about it.\n\nWhile options A, C, and D are all important aspects of creative writing, they are specific techniques that fall under the broader umbrella of 'show, don't tell.' Descriptive language, dialogue, and symbolism are all tools that writers can use to show rather than tell, but the core concept is about how information is presented to the reader\u2014through experiential details and actions rather than straightforward narration.\n\nUnderstanding and applying 'show, don't tell' can significantly enhance the quality of your writing, making it more vivid, dynamic, and compelling. It challenges writers to think beyond simple exposition and to craft scenes that engage multiple senses and invite reader participation in the storytelling process."
