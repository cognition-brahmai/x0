        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a man who gives away parts of his money in a specific sequence and ends up with $60. We need to find out how much he had originally.\n\nFirst, he gives half of his money to his wife. Let's say he originally had x dollars. So, he gives x/2 to his wife. That means he has x - x/2 = x/2 left.\n\nNext, he gives one-third of what's left to his son. He has x/2 left, so one-third of that is (x/2)/3 = x/6. So, he gives x/6 to his son, and now he has x/2 - x/6 left. To subtract these, we need a common denominator, which is 6. So, x/2 is 3x/6, and 3x/6 - x/6 = 2x/6 = x/3 left.\n\nThen, he gives one-fourth of the remaining amount to his daughter. He has x/3 left, so one-fourth of that is (x/3)/4 = x/12. So, he gives x/12 to his daughter, and now he has x/3 - x/12 left. Again, common denominator is 12. x/3 is 4x/12, and 4x/12 - x/12 = 3x/12 = x/4 left.\n\nAccording to the problem, after all these transactions, he has $60 left. So, x/4 = 60.\n\nTo find x, we can multiply both sides by 4: x = 60 * 4 = 240.\n\nSo, he originally had $240.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nStart with $240.\n\nGives half to his wife: 240/2 = 120, so he has 240 - 120 = 120 left.\n\nThen, gives one-third of what's left to his son: 120/3 = 40, so he has 120 - 40 = 80 left.\n\nThen, gives one-fourth of the remaining amount to his daughter: 80/4 = 20, so he has 80 - 20 = 60 left.\n\nYes, that matches the problem. He has $60 left.\n\nSo, the answer is $240.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
