        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find out the capacity of a cylindrical water tank in gallons, given its diameter and height, and the conversion factor from cubic feet to gallons.\n\nFirst, I know that the capacity or volume of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( V \\) is the volume,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the base,\n\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder,\n\n- \\( \\pi \\) is a constant, approximately 3.14159.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the tank is 6 feet, I can find the radius by dividing the diameter by 2:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{6 \\text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nThe height \\( h \\) is given as 10 feet.\n\nNow, plugging these values into the volume formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi (3)^2 (10) \\]\n\n\\[ V = 3.14159 \\times 9 \\times 10 \\]\n\n\\[ V = 3.14159 \\times 90 \\]\n\n\\[ V \\approx 282.7434 \\text{ cubic feet} \\]\n\nNext, I need to convert this volume from cubic feet to gallons. The conversion factor given is 1 cubic foot \u2248 7.48 gallons.\n\nSo, the capacity in gallons \\( C \\) is:\n\n\\[ C = V \\times 7.48 \\]\n\n\\[ C \\approx 282.7434 \\times 7.48 \\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[ C \\approx 2114.33 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cylindrical water tank has a capacity of approximately 2114.33 gallons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2114.33 \\text{ gallons}} \\]"
