Each tool will generate an evidence value that can be used in subsequent steps.\n\nAvailable Tools:\nSearchEngine[input]: This tool allows you to search for information on the internet. The input is a string query and the output is a list of websites that may contain relevant information.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts text from a website given its URL. The input is a string containing the URL, and the output is plain text content of the webpage.\nQA[input]: Can answer questions based on common sense, general world knowledge or given context. The input should be a question string which may reference previous evidence variables as context.\nDataAnalyzer[input]: Analyzes data and extracts key points. Particularly useful when dealing with large amounts of text or data. Input must be a text string referencing an evidence variable.\n\nThe output format should be:\nPlan: [first action]\n#E1 = [function call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on #E1]\n#E2 = [next function call with input parameter, possibly referencing #E1]\n...\nFinal Answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: What are some of the main tourist attractions in Paris?"
