Also, each girl has 5 pencils, and each boy has 7 pencils. I need to find out how many pencils all the students have in total.\n\nAlright, first things first. I need to figure out how many girls and how many boys there are in the class. Let's use some variables to represent these unknowns. Let\u2019s say the number of boys is B and the number of girls is G.\n\nAccording to the problem, there are twice as many girls as boys, so I can write that as:\n\nG = 2B\n\nAlso, the total number of students is 30, so:\n\nB + G = 30\n\nNow, since I have G in terms of B, I can substitute G in the second equation:\n\nB + 2B = 30\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n3B = 30\n\nSo, B = 10\n\nNow that I have the number of boys, I can find the number of girls:\n\nG = 2 * 10 = 20\n\nAlright, so there are 10 boys and 20 girls in the class.\n\nNext, each girl has 5 pencils, so the total number of pencils that girls have is:\n\n20 girls * 5 pencils/girl = 100 pencils\n\nEach boy has 7 pencils, so the total number of pencils that boys have is:\n\n10 boys * 7 pencils/boy = 70 pencils\n\nNow, to find the total number of pencils all students have, I just need to add these two amounts together:\n\n100 pencils + 70 pencils = 170 pencils\n\nSo, all the students have 170 pencils in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the average number of pencils per student. But hmm, since girls and boys have different numbers of pencils, and different numbers of each, maybe that's not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total number of pencils as a combination of the pencils from girls and boys, which is what I did earlier.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the ratio of girls to boys. Since there are twice as many girls as boys, the ratio of girls to boys is 2:1. That means, for every 2 girls, there is 1 boy. So, in a class of 30 students, the number of boys is 30 / (2 + 1) = 30 / 3 = 10, and girls are 2 * 10 = 20. That matches what I found earlier.\n\nNow, multiplying the number of girls by pencils per girl and number of boys by pencils per boy, and adding them up, gives me 20 * 5 + 10 * 7 = 100 + 70 = 170 pencils.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of total pencils contributed by girls and boys separately and then sum them up, which is essentially what I did.\n\nI think that's correct. Maybe I can try another method to confirm.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the total number of pencils as the sum of pencils from all students. So, total pencils = (number of girls * pencils per girl) + (number of boys * pencils per boy).\n\nWe already know number of girls is 20 and number of boys is 10, with pencils per girl being 5 and pencils per boy being 7.\n\nSo, total pencils = (20 * 5) + (10 * 7) = 100 + 70 = 170.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think in terms of equations, I could set up a system of equations.\n\nLet B be the number of boys, G be the number of girls.\n\nWe have:\n\nG = 2B\n\nAnd\n\nB + G = 30\n\nSubstituting G in the second equation:\n\nB + 2B = 30\n\n3B = 30\n\nB = 10\n\nThen G = 20\n\nThen total pencils = 5G + 7B = 5*20 + 7*10 = 100 + 70 = 170\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the average number of pencils per student.\n\nThe average number of pencils per student would be the total number of pencils divided by the total number of students.\n\nBut I don't know the total number of pencils yet, that's what I'm trying to find.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the weighted average of pencils per student based on the proportion of girls and boys.\n\nThe proportion of girls is 20/30 = 2/3, and the proportion of boys is 10/30 = 1/3.\n\nSo, the average number of pencils per student would be:\n\n(2/3)*5 + (1/3)*7 = (10/3) + (7/3) = 17/3 \u2248 5.6667 pencils per student\n\nThen, total pencils would be average pencils per student times total number of students:\n\n17/3 * 30 = (17 * 30)/3 = 17 * 10 = 170 pencils\n\nAgain, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about it in terms of total pencils if all students were girls or all were boys.\n\nIf all 30 students were girls, total pencils would be 30 * 5 = 150 pencils.\n\nBut actually, some of them are boys who have 7 pencils each, which is 2 more pencils per boy than girls.\n\nSince there are 10 boys, that adds an extra 10 * 2 = 20 pencils to the total.\n\nSo, total pencils = 150 + 20 = 170 pencils.\n\nWait, that's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, if all 30 students were boys, total pencils would be 30 * 7 = 210 pencils.\n\nBut actually, there are 20 girls who have 2 pencils fewer than boys.\n\nSo, total pencils would be 210 - (20 * 2) = 210 - 40 = 170 pencils.\n\nAgain, that confirms the earlier result.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach this problem, I keep getting 170 pencils as the total.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the total number of pencils all students have is 170.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{170} \\]"
