        "content": "So I've got this probability question here: if you flip a fair coin 3 times, what's the probability of getting exactly 2 heads and 1 tail? Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that a fair coin has two sides: heads and tails, and each flip is independent of the others. That means the outcome of one flip doesn't affect the outcomes of the others. Each flip has a probability of 0.5 for heads and 0.5 for tails.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability of getting exactly 2 heads and 1 tail in 3 flips. One way to think about this is to list all possible outcomes of flipping a coin 3 times and then count how many of those outcomes have exactly 2 heads and 1 tail.\n\nLet's list all possible outcomes:\n\n1. Heads, Heads, Heads (HHH)\n\n2. Heads, Heads, Tails (HHT)\n\n3. Heads, Tails, Heads (HTH)\n\n4. Heads, Tails, Tails (HTT)\n\n5. Tails, Heads, Heads (THH)\n\n6. Tails, Heads, Tails (THT)\n\n7. Tails, Tails, Heads (TTH)\n\n8. Tails, Tails, Tails (TTT)\n\nSo, there are 8 possible outcomes in total.\n\nNow, let's see which of these have exactly 2 heads and 1 tail:\n\n- HHT has 2 heads and 1 tail.\n\n- HTH has 2 heads and 1 tail.\n\n- THH has 2 heads and 1 tail.\n\nSo, there are 3 outcomes that meet our criteria.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That is:\n\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes = 3 / 8\n\nWait a minute, but I've heard about something called the binomial probability formula. Maybe I should use that to verify my answer.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(k successes in n trials) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nIn this case, n = 3 (flips), k = 2 (heads), and p = 0.5 (probability of heads).\n\nFirst, I need to calculate \"3 choose 2,\" which is the number of ways to choose 2 heads out of 3 flips. That should be 3, as we saw earlier.\n\nThen, p^k = (0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\nAnd (1-p)^(n-k) = (0.5)^(3-2) = 0.5\n\nSo, plugging into the formula:\n\nP(2 heads in 3 flips) = 3 * 0.25 * 0.5 = 3 * 0.125 = 0.375\n\nBut 0.375 is the same as 3/8.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of getting heads on the first two flips and tails on the third: (0.5)*(0.5)*(0.5) = 0.125\n\nBut that's just one specific sequence. There are other sequences that also have exactly 2 heads and 1 tail: HHT, HTH, and THH.\n\nSo, I need to account for all these sequences. Since each sequence has a probability of 0.125, and there are 3 such sequences, the total probability is 3 * 0.125 = 0.375, or 3/8.\n\nWait, I just realized that I've been getting the same answer using different methods, which is a good sign that I'm on the right track.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I use the concept of permutations. The number of ways to arrange 2 heads and 1 tail in 3 flips is the number of permutations of H, H, T.\n\nThe formula for permutations of multiset is:\n\nNumber of permutations = n! / (k1! * k2! * ... * kt!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of items, and k1, k2, ..., kt are the frequencies of the distinct items.\n\nIn this case, n = 3, k1 = 2 (for heads), k2 = 1 (for tails).\n\nSo, number of permutations = 3! / (2! * 1!) = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nAgain, this matches what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 3/8.\n\nWait, but I recall that in probability, sometimes order doesn't matter, sometimes it does. In this case, since we're dealing with sequences of coin flips, order does matter because each sequence is distinct.\n\nHowever, in some probability problems, especially with combinations, order might not matter. But here, since each flip is independent, order is important.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the binomial coefficient, which accounts for the number of ways to choose k successes out of n trials, without regard to order, and then multiply by the probability of each specific sequence.\n\nThat's essentially what I did earlier.\n\nSo, to summarize, using the binomial probability formula, I get P = 3/8.\n\nAlternatively, by listing all possible outcomes and counting the favorable ones, I also get P = 3/8.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 3/8.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other approach.\n\nSuppose I use the concept of conditional probability. For example, what's the probability of getting 2 heads and 1 tail in any order.\n\nWell, that seems a bit circular, because conditional probability is usually used when there are dependencies between events, but in this case, each flip is independent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of generating functions or other advanced probability concepts, but that might be overkill for this simple problem.\n\nGiven that, I think I've covered all the necessary ground to confirm that the probability is indeed 3/8.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider the probability of getting exactly 2 heads and 1 tail.\n\nAs each flip is independent, the probability of any specific sequence with 2 heads and 1 tail is (0.5)^3 = 0.125.\n\nSince there are 3 such sequences, the total probability is 3 * 0.125 = 0.375, which is 3/8.\n\nI can't think of any reason why this would be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3/8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{8}} \\]"
