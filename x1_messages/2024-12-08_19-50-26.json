        "content": "Let's see. The baker uses 8 cups of flour to make 16 cookies. I need to find out how many cups he needs to make 48 cookies. Hmm, this seems like a proportion problem.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much flour is needed for one cookie. If 8 cups make 16 cookies, then for one cookie, it would be 8 cups divided by 16 cookies. Let me do that calculation: 8 divided by 16 is 0.5 cups per cookie.\n\nNow, if one cookie requires 0.5 cups of flour, then 48 cookies would require 48 times 0.5 cups. So, 48 times 0.5 is 24 cups.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe by seeing how many times 16 goes into 48 and then multiplying the flour accordingly.\n\nLet's try that. 48 divided by 16 is 3. So, if 16 cookies require 8 cups, then 48 cookies, which is three times as many, would require three times the flour. So, 8 cups times 3 is 24 cups.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer: 24 cups of flour are needed for 48 cookies.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check another way. Maybe using a proportion formula.\n\nSo, if 16 cookies : 8 cups = 48 cookies : x cups, then I can set up the proportion as x / 8 = 48 / 16.\n\nSolving for x, it would be x = (8 * 48) / 16. Let's calculate that: 8 times 48 is 384, divided by 16 is 24 cups.\n\nAgain, the same answer. So, I'm confident that 24 cups is the correct amount of flour needed for 48 cookies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
