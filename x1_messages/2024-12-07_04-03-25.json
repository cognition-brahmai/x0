        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangle. It says that the original length is 8 cm and the width is 6 cm. Then, it tells me to increase the length by 50% and decrease the width by 25%, and I need to find out what the new area will be after these changes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to increase the length by 50%. Increasing something by 50% means you're adding half of its original value to itself. So, for the length:\n\nOriginal length = 8 cm\n\nIncrease = 50% of 8 cm = 0.5 * 8 = 4 cm\n\nTherefore, new length = original length + increase = 8 cm + 4 cm = 12 cm\n\nNext, decreasing the width by 25% means you're subtracting a quarter of its original value from itself. So, for the width:\n\nOriginal width = 6 cm\n\nDecrease = 25% of 6 cm = 0.25 * 6 = 1.5 cm\n\nTherefore, new width = original width - decrease = 6 cm - 1.5 cm = 4.5 cm\n\nNow that I have the new dimensions, I can calculate the new area. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = length * width\n\nSo, new area = new length * new width = 12 cm * 4.5 cm\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n12 * 4.5 = 12 * (4 + 0.5) = (12 * 4) + (12 * 0.5) = 48 + 6 = 54 cm\u00b2\n\nWait, but I should check if there's another way to look at this. Maybe there's a shortcut to find the new area without finding the new length and width separately.\n\nLet's see: the original area is original length * original width = 8 cm * 6 cm = 48 cm\u00b2\n\nNow, the length is increased by 50%, which is a multiplication by 1.5 (since 100% + 50% = 150% = 1.5)\n\nThe width is decreased by 25%, which is a multiplication by 0.75 (since 100% - 25% = 75% = 0.75)\n\nSo, the new area should be original area * 1.5 * 0.75 = 48 * 1.5 * 0.75\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, 48 * 1.5 = 72\n\nThen, 72 * 0.75 = 54 cm\u00b2\n\nSo, I get the same answer as before, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of percentages. The length is increased by 50%, and the width is decreased by 25%. To find the overall percentage change in area, I can multiply the scale factors for length and width.\n\nScale factor for length = 150% = 1.5\n\nScale factor for width = 75% = 0.75\n\nOverall scale factor for area = 1.5 * 0.75 = 1.125, which is a 12.5% increase in area.\n\nSo, the new area would be original area * 1.125 = 48 * 1.125\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n48 * 1.125 = 48 * (1 + 0.125) = 48 * 1 + 48 * 0.125 = 48 + 6 = 54 cm\u00b2\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently. The new area of the rectangle after increasing the length by 50% and decreasing the width by 25% is 54 cm\u00b2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{54} \\]"
