        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a Python script that watches a specific directory for new files and automatically compresses them using the gzip library. Additionally, it will keep a log of which files have been compressed and what their original sizes were.\n\nFirst, we need to import the necessary libraries. We'll use `os` to interact with the directory, `time` to handle delays, `shutil` for file operations, and `gzip` for compression.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport time\nimport shutil\nimport gzip\n```\n\nNext, we need to define the directory we want to monitor. Let's assume the directory is named \"watch_dir\" in the same location as the script.\n\n```python\nwatch_dir = 'watch_dir'\n```\n\nWe should also set up a log file to record the compressed files and their original sizes. Let's name it \"compression_log.txt\".\n\n```python\nlog_file = 'compression_log.txt'\n```\n\nTo keep track of which files have already been compressed, we'll maintain a list of processed files. We'll read this list from the log file if it exists, or initialize an empty list otherwise.\n\n```python\nif os.path.exists(log_file):\n    with open(log_file, 'r') as f:\n        processed_files = set(line.split(',')[0] for line in f)\nelse:\n    processed_files = set()\n```\n\nNow, we'll enter a loop that continuously checks the directory for new files. We'll use a while loop with a sleep to periodically check for new files.\n\n```python\nwhile True:\n    current_files = set(os.listdir(watch_dir))\n    new_files = current_files - processed_files\n    for file_name in new_files:\n        file_path = os.path.join(watch_dir, file_name)\n        if os.path.isfile(file_path):\n            # Compress the file\n            with open(file_path, 'rb') as f_in:\n                with gzip.open(file_path + '.gz', 'wb') as f_out:\n                    shutil.copyfileobj(f_in, f_out)\n            # Record the compression in the log\n            original_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)\n            with open(log_file, 'a') as f:\n                f.write(f'{file_name},{original_size}\\n')\n            # Add to processed files\n            processed_files.add(file_name)\n            # Optionally, remove the original file\n            # os.remove(file_path)\n    time.sleep(5)  # Check every 5 seconds\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n- We list all files in the directory and find the new ones that haven't been processed yet.\n\n- For each new file, we open it in binary read mode and create a gzip-compressed version of it.\n\n- We log the file name and its original size in the log file.\n\n- We add the file to the set of processed files to avoid re-compressing it.\n\n- Optionally, you can choose to delete the original file after compression by uncommenting the `os.remove(file_path)` line.\n\n- The script sleeps for 5 seconds before checking again. You can adjust this interval as needed.\n\nThis script will run indefinitely, continuously monitoring the specified directory for new files to compress. Make sure to handle any exceptions that might occur, such as file access errors, to make the script more robust.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Python script that monitors a directory for new files and automatically compresses them using the gzip library, while maintaining a log of compressed files and their original sizes, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import necessary libraries**:\n    - `os` for directory interactions.\n    - `time` for delays.\n    - `shutil` for file operations.\n    - `gzip` for compression.\n\n2. **Define the directory to monitor**:\n    - Set the directory path to be watched for new files.\n\n3. **Set up a log file**:\n    - Define a log file to record compressed files and their original sizes.\n\n4. **Track processed files**:\n    - Read the list of already processed files from the log file if it exists, otherwise start with an empty set.\n\n5. **Continuously monitor the directory**:\n    - Use a loop to periodically check for new files in the directory.\n    - Compress new files using gzip and record the compression in the log file.\n    - Optionally, remove the original file after compression.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport time\nimport shutil\nimport gzip\n\n# Define the directory to monitor\nwatch_dir = 'watch_dir'\n\n# Define the log file\nlog_file = 'compression_log.txt'\n\n# Initialize the set of processed files\nif os.path.exists(log_file):\n    with open(log_file, 'r') as f:\n        processed_files = set(line.split(',')[0] for line in f)\nelse:\n    processed_files = set()\n\n# Continuously monitor the directory\nwhile True:\n    # Get the current list of files in the directory\n    current_files = set(os.listdir(watch_dir))\n    \n    # Find new files that haven't been processed yet\n    new_files = current_files - processed_files\n    \n    # Process each new file\n    for file_name in new_files:\n        file_path = os.path.join(watch_dir, file_name)\n        if os.path.isfile(file_path):\n            # Compress the file\n            with open(file_path, 'rb') as f_in:\n                with gzip.open(file_path + '.gz', 'wb') as f_out:\n                    shutil.copyfileobj(f_in, f_out)\n            # Log the compression\n            original_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)\n            with open(log_file, 'a') as f:\n                f.write(f'{file_name},{original_size}\\n')\n            # Add to processed files\n            processed_files.add(file_name)\n            # Optionally remove the original file\n            # os.remove(file_path)\n    \n    # Sleep for a while before checking again\n    time.sleep(5)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Import Libraries**:\n    - Essential modules for file operations and compression are imported.\n\n2. **Directory and Log File Setup**:\n    - Specify the directory to monitor and the log file for recording compressed files.\n\n3. **Track Processed Files**:\n    - Read the log file to get files already processed, if any.\n\n4. **Monitor Directory in a Loop**:\n    - Continuously check for new files in the directory.\n    - Compress new files using gzip and log the compression details.\n    - Optionally, remove the original file after compression to save space.\n\n5. **Time Delay**:\n    - Introduce a delay to avoid high CPU usage due to continuous checking.\n\nThis script ensures that any new files added to the specified directory are automatically compressed and logged, maintaining efficiency and organization."
