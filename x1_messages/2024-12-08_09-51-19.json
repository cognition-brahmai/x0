        "content": "Alright, I'm going to create a Python script that uses the Beautiful Soup library to scrape headings from a Wikipedia page and store them in a JSON object. I'll make sure to handle exceptions for invalid URLs or parsing issues.\n\nFirst, I need to install the required libraries if I haven't already. I'll need `beautifulsoup4` for parsing HTML and `requests` to handle HTTP requests. I can install them using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install beautifulsoup4 requests\n```\n\nNow, I'll start by importing the necessary modules:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport json\n```\n\nNext, I need to define a function that takes a URL as input, fetches the page, and parses it to extract headings. I'll target H1, H2, and H3 tags.\n\nI should handle exceptions for invalid URLs or failing requests. So, I'll use a try-except block for the HTTP request.\n\nOnce I have the page content, I'll create a Beautiful Soup object to parse it.\n\nThen, I'll find all the heading tags (H1, H2, H3) and extract their text.\n\nI'll organize these headings into a JSON object, perhaps categorizing them by their level.\n\nFinally, I'll return or print this JSON object.\n\nLet me sketch a rough structure of the function:\n\n```python\ndef scrape_headings(url):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Will raise an HTTPError if the HTTP request returned an unsuccessful status code\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching the URL: {e}\")\n        return {}\n    \n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n    \n    headings = {\n        'h1': [],\n        'h2': [],\n        'h3': []\n    }\n    \n    for tag in ['h1', 'h2', 'h3']:\n        elements = soup.find_all(tag)\n        for element in elements:\n            headings[tag].append(element.get_text())\n    \n    return json.dumps(headings, indent=4)\n```\n\nI should test this function with a Wikipedia URL, like \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping\".\n\nWait, Wikipedia pages might have multiple H1 tags, or none, as their structure can vary. H2 and H3 are more likely to be present for sections and subsections.\n\nI should also consider that some headings might contain more complex structures, like links or other tags, but for now, extracting plain text should suffice.\n\nAdditionally, I can add more error handling inside the parsing part, in case the HTML is not as expected.\n\nLet me think about the JSON output. It's a dictionary with keys 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', each mapping to a list of strings. Converting this to a JSON string with indentation will make it readable.\n\nI might also want to handle cases where there are no headings of a particular level by including empty lists in the JSON.\n\nLet me consider writing a main part of the script that accepts a URL as input from the user and calls this function.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    url = input(\"Enter the Wikipedia URL to scrape: \")\n    print(scrape_headings(url))\n```\n\nThis way, the script is interactive.\n\nI should also think about robustness. Maybe handle cases where the user inputs an invalid URL format or a page that doesn't exist.\n\nFurthermore, Wikipedia pages have a specific structure, and there might be more efficient ways to extract the heading hierarchy. But for simplicity, extracting all H1, H2, and H3 tags should work for most cases.\n\nI should also consider that some elements might have nested tags, but Beautiful Soup's `get_text()` method should handle that by extracting all text within the tag and its children.\n\nLet me think about potential improvements or additions:\n\n- Handling relative links or extracting more data besides headings.\n\n- Implementing options to output the JSON to a file.\n\n- Adding logging instead of print statements for better error tracking.\n\nBut for the scope of this task, extracting headings and handling basic exceptions should suffice.\n\nI need to make sure that the script is clear and well-commented, so anyone using it understands what's happening.\n\nLet me write a complete script with comments:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport json\n\ndef scrape_headings(url):\n    try:\n        # Send a GET request to the URL\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        # Raise an exception if the request was unsuccessful\n        response.raise_for_status()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching the URL: {e}\")\n        return {}\n    \n    # Parse the HTML content using Beautiful Soup\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n    \n    # Initialize a dictionary to hold headings of different levels\n    headings = {\n        'h1': [],\n        'h2': [],\n        'h3': []\n    }\n    \n    # Find all H1, H2, and H3 tags and extract their text\n    for tag in ['h1', 'h2', 'h3']:\n        elements = soup.find_all(tag)\n        for element in elements:\n            headings[tag].append(element.get_text())\n    \n    # Convert the headings dictionary to a JSON string with indentation\n    return json.dumps(headings, indent=4)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    url = input(\"Enter the Wikipedia URL to scrape: \")\n    print(scrape_headings(url))\n```\n\nThis script should work for most Wikipedia pages. However, Wikipedia has its own API for fetching data, which might be more reliable and efficient for scraping purposes. But since the task is to use Beautiful Soup, this approach should be acceptable.\n\nI should test this script with a few different Wikipedia pages to ensure it works consistently.\n\nFor example:\n\n- \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping\"\n\n- \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)\"\n\n- \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beautiful_Soup\"\n\nI should check if the script correctly extracts headings from these pages and handles any edge cases, such as pages without certain heading levels.\n\nAdditionally, I should be aware of Wikipedia's terms of use regarding web scraping and ensure that this script is used in compliance with their policies.\n\nOverall, this should accomplish the task as requested.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo scrape headings from a Wikipedia page and extract H1, H2, and H3 tags into a JSON object, you can use the following Python script. This script uses the Beautiful Soup library to parse the HTML content of the page and handles exceptions for invalid URLs or parsing issues.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport json\n\ndef scrape_headings(url):\n    try:\n        # Send a GET request to the URL\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        # Raise an exception if the request was unsuccessful\n        response.raise_for_status()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching the URL: {e}\")\n        return {}\n    \n    # Parse the HTML content using Beautiful Soup\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n    \n    # Initialize a dictionary to hold headings of different levels\n    headings = {\n        'h1': [],\n        'h2': [],\n        'h3': []\n    }\n    \n    # Find all H1, H2, and H3 tags and extract their text\n    for tag in ['h1', 'h2', 'h3']:\n        elements = soup.find_all(tag)\n        for element in elements:\n            headings[tag].append(element.get_text())\n    \n    # Convert the headings dictionary to a JSON string with indentation\n    return json.dumps(headings, indent=4)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    url = input(\"Enter the Wikipedia URL to scrape: \")\n    print(scrape_headings(url))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Import Required Libraries**: Import `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `json` to handle HTTP requests, parse HTML, and work with JSON data, respectively.\n\n2. **Define the Function `scrape_headings`**:\n    - **Fetch the URL**: Use `requests.get` to fetch the webpage. Handle exceptions for invalid URLs or failed requests.\n    - **Parse the HTML Content**: Use Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML content.\n    - **Extract Headings**: Find all H1, H2, and H3 tags and extract their text.\n    - **Store in JSON Format**: Organize the extracted headings into a dictionary and convert it to a JSON string.\n\n3. **Main Block**:\n    - Prompt the user to enter a Wikipedia URL.\n    - Call the `scrape_headings` function and print the returned JSON object.\n\nThis script provides a straightforward way to extract headings from a Wikipedia page and handle potential errors gracefully."
