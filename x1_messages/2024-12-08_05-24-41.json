        "content": "So, there are about 7.9 million species on Earth, and approximately 86% of them haven't been discovered yet. I need to find out how many species have been discovered so far.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the question is asking. It says that 86% of the species have not been discovered yet, which means that the remaining percentage has been discovered. So, if 86% are undiscovered, then 100% - 86% = 14% have been discovered.\n\nNow, I need to find 14% of 7.9 million species.\n\nTo calculate this, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply it by the total number of species.\n\n14% as a decimal is 0.14.\n\nSo, the number of discovered species is 7,900,000 * 0.14.\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n7,900,000 * 0.14 = 1,106,000.\n\nTherefore, about 1,106,000 species have been discovered so far.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal species = 7,900,000\n\nUndiscovered percentage = 86%\n\nDiscovered percentage = 100% - 86% = 14%\n\nDiscovered species = 7,900,000 * 0.14 = 1,106,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of fractions.\n\n14% is the same as 14/100, which simplifies to 7/50.\n\nSo, discovered species = 7,900,000 * (7/50)\n\nFirst, 7,900,000 divided by 50 is 158,000.\n\nThen, 158,000 * 7 = 1,106,000.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can use proportions.\n\nIf 100% represents 7,900,000 species,\n\nThen 1% represents 79,000 species.\n\nSo, 14% represents 14 * 79,000 = 1,106,000 species.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo, approximately 1,106,000 species have been discovered so far.\n\nBut the question says \"about 7.9 million species,\" so maybe I should round the answer accordingly.\n\n7.9 million is approximately 7,900,000.\n\nMy answer is 1,106,000, which is about 1.1 million.\n\nSo, roughly 1.1 million species have been discovered.\n\nThat seems like a reasonable estimate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1106000} \\]"
