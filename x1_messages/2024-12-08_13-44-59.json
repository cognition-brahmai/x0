Each tool should produce an evidence value, which is the output of a function given an input string (which could be the user's question, previous evidence values, or both).\n\nAvailable tools:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: A tool that uses DuckDuckGo search engine to find information. It provides a list of sites that might contain the answer to the user's question.\nWebScraper[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nURLExtractor[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nAIQA[input]: An AI-powered question answering model. It answers questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., What color is the car, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe output format should be:\nPlan: [first action based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may reference previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who invented the World Wide Web and what were its initial purposes?"

I have some tools to help me with this: DuckDuckGo for searching, WebScraper to get information from websites, URLExtractor to find links, and AIQA to answer questions based on text.\n\nFirst, I should probably search for information about the invention of the World Wide Web. I can use DuckDuckGo for that. So, I'll input \"who invented the World Wide Web\" into DuckDuckGo to get a list of relevant websites.\n\nPlan: Search for who invented the World Wide Web.\n:evidence0: = DuckDuckGo[\"who invented the World Wide Web\"]\n\nOnce I have the search results, I need to look at those websites to find the information. But looking at multiple websites might be time-consuming, so maybe I can extract the links from the search results and then decide which ones to scrape for content.\n\nPlan: Extract links from the DuckDuckGo search results.\n:evidence1: = URLExtractor[:evidence0:]\n\nNow, with the list of links, I should choose the most relevant ones to scrape for information. Maybe the top few links would be sufficient. I can assume that the first link is likely to be a reliable source, like a Wikipedia page or an official website.\n\nPlan: Scrape the content from the first link.\n:evidence2: = WebScraper[First link from :evidence1:]\n\nOnce I have the text from the website, I can look for the answer to my question. But since the text might be long, it's better to use AIQA to extract the specific information I need.\n\nPlan: Use AIQA to find out who invented the World Wide Web from the scraped text.\n:evidence3: = AIQA[\"Who invented the World Wide Web, given :evidence2:\"]\n\nNow, I need to find out the initial purposes of the World Wide Web. I can either look for this information on the same page or search again. To save time, maybe I can look for it in the same scraped text.\n\nPlan: Use AIQA to find the initial purposes of the World Wide Web from the same text.\n:evidence4: = AIQA[\"What were the initial purposes of the World Wide Web, given :evidence2:\"]\n\nIf the information isn't sufficient, I can consider scraping another website or searching again. But for now, I'll assume that the first source has both pieces of information.\n\nFinally, I can compile the answers from :evidence3: and :evidence4: to give the user a complete response.\n\nAnswer: :evidence3: and :evidence4:"
