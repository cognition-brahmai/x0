If each person contributes an equal amount, how much should each person pay if there are 7 people in the group?"

        "content": "So the total cost for renting the vacation house is the rental fee plus the cleaning fee, right? That would be $2,100 plus $150, which equals $2,250. Now, this amount needs to be split equally among 7 people. To find out how much each person should pay, I need to divide the total cost by the number of people.\n\nSo, $2,250 divided by 7. Let me do the math here. 2250 divided by 7.\n\n7 times 300 is 2100.\n\nSubtract 2100 from 2250, which leaves 150.\n\nNow, 7 times 21 is 147.\n\nSubtract 147 from 150, which leaves 3.\n\nSo, 7 times 0.4 is 2.8.\n\nSubtract 2.8 from 3, which leaves 0.2.\n\n7 times 0.02 is 0.14.\n\nSubtract 0.14 from 0.2, which leaves 0.06.\n\n7 times 0.008 is 0.056.\n\nSubtract 0.056 from 0.06, which leaves 0.004.\n\nThis is getting a bit messy. Maybe I should use a calculator for this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 2250 divided by 7.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\n7 times 300 is 2100, as I said before.\n\nSo, 2250 minus 2100 is 150.\n\nNow, 150 divided by 7.\n\n7 times 21 is 147.\n\nSo, 150 minus 147 is 3.\n\nSo, the amount each person pays is 300 plus 21, which is 321, plus the remaining 3 divided by 7.\n\n3 divided by 7 is approximately 0.42857, which rounds to about 0.43.\n\nSo, each person pays $321.43.\n\nWait a minute, let me check that again.\n\n300 plus 21 is 321, plus approximately 0.43 is 321.43.\n\nBut to be precise, 3 divided by 7 is approximately 0.42857, which is often rounded to 0.43.\n\nSo, each person should pay $321.43.\n\nBut to be exact, since 7 times 321 is 2247, which is 3 less than 2250, so to make it equal, each person should pay an additional 3 divided by 7, which is approximately 0.42857.\n\nSo, $321.43 is a reasonable approximation.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to be precise, each person pays $321.428571..., but in practice, it's better to round to two decimal places.\n\nSo, each person should pay $321.43.\n\nBut wait, if seven people pay $321.43, the total would be 7 times 321.43, which is 2250.01, which is one cent over.\n\nTo make it exact, perhaps six people pay $321.43 and one person pays $321.42, so that the total is exactly $2,250.\n\nLet me verify that.\n\n6 times 321.43 is 1,928.58.\n\nPlus one person paying 321.42 makes the total 1,928.58 plus 321.42 equals 2,250.00.\n\nPerfect, that works.\n\nSo, to split the cost equally, six people can pay $321.43 and one person can pay $321.42, totaling $2,250.\n\nAlternatively, if they prefer, they can all pay $321.43 and have one person receive a penny back, but that seems a bit awkward.\n\nSo, the better approach is to have six people pay $321.43 and one person pay $321.42.\n\nThis ensures the total cost is fully covered without any extra amount.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{321.43} \\]"
