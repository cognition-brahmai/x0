        "content": "Certainly! Below is a simple JavaScript program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to 'n' terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n\n```javascript\nfunction printFibonacci(n) {\n    let a = 0, b = 1, nextTerm;\n\n    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        console.log(a);\n        nextTerm = a + b;\n        a = b;\n        b = nextTerm;\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst numberOfTerms = 10;\nprintFibonacci(numberOfTerms);\n```\n\nIn this program:\n\n- We define a function `printFibonacci` that takes one parameter `n`, which represents the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence to print.\n\n- We initialize variables `a` and `b` to 0 and 1, respectively, which are the first two terms of the sequence.\n\n- We use a `for` loop that runs `n` times. In each iteration:\n\n- We print the current term `a`.\n\n- We calculate the next term in the sequence by adding `a` and `b` and store it in `nextTerm`.\n\n- We update `a` to be the value of `b`, and `b` to be the value of `nextTerm` for the next iteration.\n\n- To use this function, you can set `numberOfTerms` to the desired number of terms you want to print and call `printFibonacci(numberOfTerms)`. In the example, it prints the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nThis approach ensures that the sequence is generated and printed efficiently in a straightforward manner."
