        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces 200 widgets in an 8-hour workday. It operates 24 hours a day, which means there are three 8-hour shifts in a day. But here's the twist: during the night shift, production increases by 50%. We need to find out how many widgets are produced in one full day.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the production rates for different shifts. The problem states that the factory produces 200 widgets in an 8-hour workday. I assume this is the production during the day shift. So, day shift production is 200 widgets every 8 hours.\n\nNow, the factory operates 24 hours a day. That means there are three 8-hour shifts: day, afternoon, and night.\n\nThe problem mentions that production increases by 50% during the night shift. So, I need to calculate the production for each shift separately and then sum them up for the total daily production.\n\nLet me first find out the production rate per hour during the day shift.\n\nProduction during day shift: 200 widgets in 8 hours.\n\nSo, production rate per hour = 200 widgets / 8 hours = 25 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, during the night shift, production increases by 50%. So, the production rate per hour during the night shift is:\n\n25 widgets per hour + (50% of 25) = 25 + 12.5 = 37.5 widgets per hour.\n\nWait a minute, but widgets are typically whole items, so producing half a widget doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to consider that the production rate is in whole numbers, or perhaps the problem allows for fractional widgets. For now, I'll proceed with 37.5 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the production for each shift:\n\n1. Day shift: 200 widgets (given for 8 hours).\n\n2. Afternoon shift: same as day shift, assuming no change unless stated otherwise, so another 200 widgets.\n\n3. Night shift: increased by 50%, so production rate is 37.5 widgets per hour for 8 hours.\n\nLet me calculate the night shift production:\n\n37.5 widgets/hour * 8 hours = 300 widgets.\n\nNow, total production in one day = day shift + afternoon shift + night shift = 200 + 200 + 300 = 700 widgets.\n\nWait, but let's double-check if this is correct. The problem says the factory operates 24 hours a day and increases production by 50% during the night shift. But it doesn't specify if only the night shift has increased production or if both the afternoon and night shifts have increased production.\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"the factory operates 24 hours a day and increases production by 50% during the night shift.\"\n\nSo, only the night shift has increased production by 50%.\n\nTherefore, day shift: 200 widgets, afternoon shift: 200 widgets, night shift: 200 + (50% of 200) = 200 + 100 = 300 widgets.\n\nTotal production: 200 + 200 + 300 = 700 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, using the per hour rate:\n\nDay shift: 25 widgets/hour * 8 hours = 200 widgets.\n\nAfternoon shift: same as day shift, 25 widgets/hour * 8 hours = 200 widgets.\n\nNight shift: 37.5 widgets/hour * 8 hours = 300 widgets.\n\nTotal: 200 + 200 + 300 = 700 widgets.\n\nWait, but in the night shift, if production is increased by 50%, is it 50% per hour or 50% for the entire shift?\n\nThe problem says \"increases production by 50% during the night shift.\" It's probably referring to the production rate per hour, not the total shift production.\n\nSo, perhaps the night shift production should be calculated based on the per hour rate.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf the day shift produces 200 widgets in 8 hours, that's 25 widgets per hour.\n\nNight shift has a 50% increase in production rate, so 25 + (0.5*25) = 37.5 widgets per hour.\n\nTherefore, night shift production: 37.5 widgets/hour * 8 hours = 300 widgets.\n\nTotal production: day (200) + afternoon (200) + night (300) = 700 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the afternoon shift also has the same production rate as the day shift, unless specified otherwise.\n\nBut the problem only mentions an increase during the night shift, so I think it's safe to assume that the day and afternoon shifts have the same production rate.\n\nWait, but perhaps the afternoon shift also has increased production. The problem says \"the factory operates 24 hours a day and increases production by 50% during the night shift.\"\n\nThis suggests that only the night shift has increased production, and the other shifts maintain the regular production rate.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation seems correct: 200 (day) + 200 (afternoon) + 300 (night) = 700 widgets per day.\n\nBut let me consider another approach.\n\nIf the factory operates 24 hours a day, and the day shift is 8 hours with 200 widgets, that's 25 widgets per hour.\n\nIf the night shift has a 50% increase in production, that's 37.5 widgets per hour.\n\nSo, for 24 hours, production would be:\n\nDay shift: 8 hours * 25 = 200 widgets\n\nAfternoon shift: 8 hours * 25 = 200 widgets\n\nNight shift: 8 hours * 37.5 = 300 widgets\n\nTotal: 700 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory has three shifts, each producing at different rates.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify anything about the afternoon shift, so I think it's safe to assume it's the same as the day shift.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should consider that the day shift is 8 hours with 200 widgets, night shift is 8 hours with 50% more production, and the remaining 8 hours (afternoon shift) is the same as the day shift.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider that the night shift has an increased production rate, and the other shifts remain the same.\n\nSo, total production:\n\nDay shift: 200 widgets\n\nAfternoon shift: 200 widgets\n\nNight shift: 200 + (0.5*200) = 300 widgets\n\nTotal: 700 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the night shift's production rate is increased by 50%, meaning the per hour production is higher, leading to more production in the same 8-hour shift.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify the difference.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Day shift: 200 widgets in 8 hours (25 widgets/hour)\n\n- Afternoon shift: same as day shift, 200 widgets\n\n- Night shift: 50% more production rate per hour, so 37.5 widgets/hour * 8 hours = 300 widgets\n\n- Total: 200 + 200 + 300 = 700 widgets\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Day shift: 200 widgets in 8 hours\n\n- Afternoon shift: same as day shift, 200 widgets\n\n- Night shift: 200 widgets + 50% of 200 = 300 widgets\n\n- Total: 200 + 200 + 300 = 700 widgets\n\nBoth options lead to the same total production.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 700 widgets in one day.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps there's another way to interpret the problem.\n\nLet me consider that the factory's total production is increased by 50% during the night shift.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"increases production by 50% during the night shift,\" which likely refers to the production rate during that shift.\n\nTherefore, the night shift has a higher production rate compared to the day and afternoon shifts.\n\nHence, the initial calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the night shift produces 50% more widgets compared to the day shift.\n\nIn that case, night shift production would be 200 + (0.5*200) = 300 widgets.\n\nTotal production: 200 (day) + 200 (afternoon) + 300 (night) = 700 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the night shift has a 50% increase in production rate per hour, leading to higher production during that shift.\n\nBut as we've calculated, that also results in 700 widgets per day.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the factory produces 700 widgets in one day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{700} \\]"
