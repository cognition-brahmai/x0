        "content": "So if there are 24 hours in a day and someone sleeps for 8 hours, right? I need to find out what percentage of the day is spent sleeping. Okay, percentage means parts per hundred, right? So I need to find out what part of the day is sleeping and then convert that to a percentage.\n\nFirst, I should find out the ratio of sleeping hours to total hours in a day. That would be sleeping hours divided by total hours, I think. So, that's 8 hours divided by 24 hours. Let me do that calculation.\n\n8 divided by 24. Hmm, 8 divided by 24. Well, 8 times 3 is 24, so it's like 8/24 = 1/3. So, the ratio is one-third. But I need to convert that to a percentage.\n\nI know that to convert a fraction to a percentage, I can multiply by 100. So, one-third times 100 should give me the percentage. Let me calculate that.\n\n1/3 times 100 is approximately 33.333... So, it's about 33.33 percent. But maybe I should be more precise. Let me double-check this calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula:\n\nPercentage = (part/whole) * 100\n\nIn this case, the part is sleeping hours, which is 8, and the whole is total hours in a day, which is 24.\n\nSo, percentage = (8/24) * 100\n\nFirst, 8 divided by 24 is 0.333...\n\nThen, 0.333... multiplied by 100 is 33.33...\n\nSo, it's 33.33%. But maybe I can express it as 33.3 recurring.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people round it to 33.33% or sometimes they write it as 33 1/3 percent.\n\nLet me see which one is more appropriate. Since 1/3 is exactly 0.333..., it's common to write it as 33 1/3 percent.\n\nSo, perhaps the most accurate way to express it is 33 1/3 percent.\n\nBut in decimal form, it's 33.333..., which can be rounded to 33.33% depending on the required precision.\n\nI think for most purposes, saying 33.33% is fine, but mentioning 33 1/3 percent might be more precise because it acknowledges the repeating decimal.\n\nLet me confirm this with another method.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that 24 hours is the whole day, and sleeping takes up 8 hours of that. So, the fraction of the day spent sleeping is 8/24, which simplifies to 1/3, as I thought earlier.\n\nNow, to convert 1/3 to a percentage, I can divide 1 by 3 to get the decimal, which is 0.333..., and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n0.333... * 100 = 33.33...\n\nSo, again, I get 33.33%.\n\nAlternatively, I know that 1/3 is exactly equal to 0.333..., so in percentage, it's 33.33...%, which is often written as 33 1/3%.\n\nMaybe I can check this with a different approach.\n\nLet's consider that 24 hours is 100%, and I need to find what percentage 8 hours is of 24 hours.\n\nSo, proportionally:\n\n24 hours -> 100%\n\n8 hours -> x%\n\nSo, x = (8/24) * 100 = same as before, 33.33...\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of minutes or seconds, but that seems unnecessary because the calculation is straightforward with hours.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can verify this by considering the time spent awake.\n\nIf someone sleeps for 8 hours, they are awake for 24 - 8 = 16 hours.\n\nSo, the percentage of time awake is (16/24) * 100.\n\n16 divided by 24 is 0.666..., multiplied by 100 is 66.66...\n\nSo, awake time is 66.66%, and sleeping time is 33.33%, which together add up to 100%.\n\nThat makes sense because 33.33% + 66.66% = 99.99%, which is effectively 100% considering rounding errors.\n\nAlternatively, if I use fractions, 1/3 (sleeping) + 2/3 (awake) = 1 (whole day), which is 100%.\n\nSo, that confirms that 33.33% is the correct percentage of the day spent sleeping.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that 24 hours is the full period, and sleeping takes up one-third of that time.\n\nSince one-third is approximately 33.33%, that's the percentage of the day spent sleeping.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways, and the answer remains consistent.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the day spent sleeping is 33.33%.\n\nAlternatively, it can be expressed as 33 1/3%.\n\nSo, the final answer is 33.33%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33.33\\%} \\]"
