        "content": "Certainly! To create a function in Python that removes duplicates from a list of integers, you can use several approaches. One straightforward way is to convert the list to a set, which automatically removes duplicates because sets do not allow duplicate elements. Then, you can convert the set back to a list. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers):\n    return list(set(numbers))\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of integers called `numbers`, converts it to a set to remove duplicates, and then converts it back to a list. However, note that sets do not preserve the original order of elements. If you need to maintain the original order of elements, you can use a different approach, such as iterating through the list and adding elements to a new list only if they haven't been added before.\n\nHere's an example of how to do that:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates_ordered(numbers):\n    unique_numbers = []\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number not in unique_numbers:\n            unique_numbers.append(number)\n    return unique_numbers\n```\n\nIn this version, `remove_duplicates_ordered`, we iterate through each element in the input list `numbers`. For each element, we check if it is already in the `unique_numbers` list. If it's not, we append it to `unique_numbers`. This way, we ensure that duplicates are removed while preserving the original order of elements.\n\nYou can choose the appropriate function based on whether you need to preserve the order of elements or not.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo remove duplicates from a list of integers in Python while preserving the order, you can use the following function:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers):\n    unique_numbers = []\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number not in unique_numbers:\n            unique_numbers.append(number)\n    return unique_numbers\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Problem**: Remove duplicates from a list of integers.\n2. **Approach**:\n   - Use a list to store unique elements while maintaining the original order.\n   - Iterate through the input list and add elements to the new list only if they haven't been added before.\n3. **Solution Code**:\n   - `remove_duplicates`: This function takes a list of integers and returns a new list with duplicates removed, preserving the original order.\n\nThis method ensures that the original order of elements is maintained while removing duplicates, providing a straightforward and efficient solution to the problem."
