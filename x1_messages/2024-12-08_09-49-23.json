        "content": "So the city has a population of 500,000 people, and 60% of them are adults. First, I need to find out how many adults there are. To do that, I'll multiply the total population by 60%.\n\nSo, adults = 500,000 * 0.60 = 300,000 adults.\n\nNow, out of these adults, 20% have college degrees. So, to find out how many adults have college degrees, I'll multiply the number of adults by 20%.\n\nCollege degrees = 300,000 * 0.20 = 60,000 adults.\n\nTherefore, 60,000 adults in the city have college degrees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60000} \\]"
