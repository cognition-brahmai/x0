        "content": "So I've got this probability question here. It's about rolling a fair six-sided die three times and finding the probability of getting exactly one \"6\". Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that a fair six-sided die has equal chances for each face, so the probability of rolling a \"6\" is 1/6, and the probability of not rolling a \"6\" is 5/6.\n\nNow, since I'm rolling the die three times, I need to consider all the possible sequences where exactly one \"6\" appears. There are three positions where this single \"6\" can show up: on the first roll, the second roll, or the third roll.\n\nLet me consider each case separately.\n\n**Case 1:** \"6\" on the first roll.\n\n- First roll: \"6\" (probability: 1/6)\n\n- Second roll: not \"6\" (probability: 5/6)\n\n- Third roll: not \"6\" (probability: 5/6)\n\nSo, the probability for this sequence is (1/6) * (5/6) * (5/6).\n\n**Case 2:** \"6\" on the second roll.\n\n- First roll: not \"6\" (5/6)\n\n- Second roll: \"6\" (1/6)\n\n- Third roll: not \"6\" (5/6)\n\nAgain, the probability is (5/6) * (1/6) * (5/6).\n\n**Case 3:** \"6\" on the third roll.\n\n- First roll: not \"6\" (5/6)\n\n- Second roll: not \"6\" (5/6)\n\n- Third roll: \"6\" (1/6)\n\nProbability is (5/6) * (5/6) * (1/6).\n\nI notice that all three cases have the same probability: (1/6) * (5/6) * (5/6).\n\nSince these are mutually exclusive events (only one \"6\" can occur in one of the three positions), I can add up the probabilities of these cases to get the total probability of getting exactly one \"6\" in three rolls.\n\nSo, total probability = 3 * [(1/6) * (5/6) * (5/6)]\n\nNow, let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, calculate (1/6) * (5/6) * (5/6):\n\n= (1 * 5 * 5) / (6 * 6 * 6)\n\n= 25 / 216\n\nSince there are three such cases, total probability is:\n\n3 * (25/216) = 75 / 216\n\nNow, I can simplify this fraction.\n\nBoth 75 and 216 are divisible by 3.\n\n75 \u00f7 3 = 25\n\n216 \u00f7 3 = 72\n\nSo, 25/72.\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling exactly one \"6\" in three rolls of a fair six-sided die is 25/72.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(k successes in n trials) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- C(n,k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial\n\n- n is the number of trials\n\n- k is the number of successes\n\nIn this case:\n\nn = 3 (three rolls)\n\nk = 1 (exactly one \"6\")\n\np = 1/6 (probability of rolling a \"6\")\n\nSo, P = C(3,1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^(3-1)\n\nC(3,1) is 3.\n\nSo, P = 3 * (1/6) * (5/6)^2\n\nCalculate (5/6)^2:\n\n= 25/36\n\nSo, P = 3 * (1/6) * (25/36)\n\n= 3 * (25) / (6 * 36)\n\n= 75 / 216\n\nWhich simplifies to 25/72, just like before.\n\nAlright, so my initial calculation was correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a die three times. Since each roll is independent and there are six outcomes per roll, the total number of possible sequences is 6^3 = 216.\n\nNow, how many of these sequences have exactly one \"6\"?\n\nWell, there are three positions where the \"6\" can be, and for each position, the other two rolls must be anything but \"6\", which is five possibilities each.\n\nSo, number of favorable outcomes = 3 * 5 * 5 = 75\n\nTherefore, probability = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 75 / 216 = 25/72\n\nThis matches my previous calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also calculate the probability of getting no \"6\"s and the probability of getting two or three \"6\"s, and ensure that all probabilities sum up to 1.\n\nFirst, probability of no \"6\"s in three rolls:\n\nEach roll is not \"6\", so (5/6)^3 = 125/216\n\nProbability of exactly two \"6\"s:\n\nUsing the binomial formula:\n\nC(3,2) * (1/6)^2 * (5/6)^1 = 3 * (1/36) * (5/6) = 3 * 5 / 216 = 15/216\n\nProbability of exactly three \"6\"s:\n\nC(3,3) * (1/6)^3 = 1 * (1/216) = 1/216\n\nNow, let's add them all up:\n\nP(0 \"6\"s) + P(1 \"6\") + P(2 \"6\"s) + P(3 \"6\"s) = 125/216 + 75/216 + 15/216 + 1/216 = 216/216 = 1\n\nPerfect, it all adds up, which confirms that my calculation for P(1 \"6\") = 75/216 = 25/72 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this probability as a decimal or a percentage.\n\n25 divided by 72 is approximately 0.3472, or 34.72%.\n\nSo, there's roughly a 34.72% chance of rolling exactly one \"6\" in three rolls of a fair six-sided die.\n\nJust to check, I can think about it differently. The probability of getting exactly one \"6\" is the same as choosing one specific roll to be a \"6\" and the other two not to be \"6\"s.\n\nThere are C(3,1) = 3 ways to choose which roll is the \"6\", and for each choice, the probability is (1/6) * (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/216.\n\nSo, total probability is 3 * 25/216 = 75/216 = 25/72.\n\nYep, same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed this enough ways. The probability is indeed 25/72.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{72}} \\]"
