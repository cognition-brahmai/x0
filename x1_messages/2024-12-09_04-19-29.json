        "content": "So I have this problem here: I need to calculate the present value of an investment that will pay $5,000 in five years, and the annual interest rate is 4%. The formula given is PV = FV / (1 + r)^n. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each variable represents in the formula:\n\n- PV stands for Present Value, which is what I'm trying to find.\n\n- FV is the Future Value, which is the amount of money I'll have in the future, in this case, $5,000.\n\n- r is the annual interest rate, which is 4%.\n\n- n is the number of years, which is 5.\n\nSo, plugging in the values, it should look like PV = 5000 / (1 + 0.04)^5.\n\nWait a minute, I need to make sure I'm using the correct form of the interest rate. The interest rate is given as a percentage, 4%, so in decimal form, that's 0.04. Yes, that seems right.\n\nNow, calculating (1 + 0.04)^5.\n\nFirst, 1 + 0.04 = 1.04.\n\nThen, 1.04 raised to the power of 5.\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\n1.04^1 = 1.04\n\n1.04^2 = 1.04 * 1.04 = 1.0816\n\n1.04^3 = 1.0816 * 1.04 = 1.124864\n\n1.04^4 = 1.124864 * 1.04 = 1.16985856\n\n1.04^5 = 1.16985856 * 1.04 = approximately 1.2166529.\n\nSo, (1 + 0.04)^5 \u2248 1.2166529.\n\nNow, PV = 5000 / 1.2166529.\n\nLet me do this division.\n\n5000 divided by 1.2166529.\n\nLet me calculate it:\n\n5000 \u00f7 1.2166529 \u2248 4098.08.\n\nSo, the present value is approximately $4,098.08.\n\nBut, I should check if this makes sense.\n\nPresent value is the amount of money that, if invested today at the given interest rate, would grow to the future value in the specified number of years.\n\nSo, if I invest $4,098.08 today at 4% annually, in 5 years, it should grow to $5,000.\n\nLet me verify this by calculating the future value of $4,098.08 invested at 4% for 5 years.\n\nThe formula for future value is FV = PV * (1 + r)^n.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: FV = 4098.08 * (1 + 0.04)^5.\n\nWe already know that (1 + 0.04)^5 \u2248 1.2166529.\n\nSo, FV \u2248 4098.08 * 1.2166529 \u2248 5000.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the present value formula to see if $5,000 in 5 years at 4% discount rate gives me the present value.\n\nWait, I just did that.\n\nAnother way to think about present value is discounting the future value back to today's dollars, accounting for the interest rate.\n\nSo, essentially, I'm finding out how much I need to invest now to have $5,000 in 5 years, given a 4% annual return.\n\nMy calculation shows it's approximately $4,098.08.\n\nBut, I noticed that in my earlier calculation, I got PV = 5000 / 1.2166529 \u2248 4098.08.\n\nBut, when I multiply back, 4098.08 * 1.2166529, it should be exactly $5,000, but due to rounding, there might be a slight difference.\n\nLet me check the exact value without rounding.\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.04)^5 exactly.\n\n1.04^1 = 1.04000000\n\n1.04^2 = 1.08160000\n\n1.04^3 = 1.12486400\n\n1.04^4 = 1.16985856\n\n1.04^5 = 1.21665290\n\nNow, PV = 5000 / 1.21665290 = 4098.081423.\n\nSo, more precisely, $4,098.08.\n\nTherefore, the present value is $4,098.08.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like compounding frequency.\n\nThe problem says \"annual interest rate,\" so I assume it's compounded annually.\n\nIf it were compounded more frequently, like quarterly or monthly, the calculation would be different.\n\nBut based on the information given, I think annually is the correct assumption.\n\nSo, my final answer is $4,098.08.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4098.08} \\]"
