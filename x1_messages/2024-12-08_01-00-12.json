        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. So, in total, there are 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 balls in the bag. The question is, if I draw three balls without replacement, what's the probability that I get one ball of each color?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is the chance of something happening, and it's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are the ways to draw one ball of each color, and the total possible outcomes are all the ways to draw any three balls from the bag.\n\nSo, let's figure out the total number of possible outcomes. Since I'm drawing three balls without replacement from a bag of 10 balls, the total number of ways to do this is the combination of 10 balls taken 3 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible outcomes is C(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10 - 3)!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 120.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to draw one ball of each color. There are 5 red, 3 blue, and 2 green balls.\n\nSo, to get one of each color, I need to pick one red, one blue, and one green ball. The number of ways to pick one red ball from five is C(5, 1) = 5. Similarly, the number of ways to pick one blue ball from three is C(3, 1) = 3, and the number of ways to pick one green ball from two is C(2, 1) = 2.\n\nSince these are independent choices, the total number of favorable outcomes is the product of these individual choices: 5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 = 30.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 30 / 120 = 0.25, or 25%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal possible outcomes: C(10, 3) = 120. That seems correct.\n\nFavorable outcomes: C(5, 1) \u00d7 C(3, 1) \u00d7 C(2, 1) = 5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 = 30. That also seems right.\n\nSo, probability = 30 / 120 = 0.25. Yep, that looks correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this problem in terms of permutations, considering the order in which the balls are drawn, but since the problem doesn't specify order, using combinations seems appropriate.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to think about the probability step by step, considering that the drawing is without replacement.\n\nFor example, the probability of drawing a red ball first is 5/10, then a blue ball second is 3/9, and then a green ball third is 2/8. So, that would be (5/10) \u00d7 (3/9) \u00d7 (2/8).\n\nSimilarly, I could have other orders: red, green, blue; blue, red, green; blue, green, red; green, red, blue; green, blue, red.\n\nEach of these orders would have the same probability, so I could calculate the probability for one order and then multiply by the number of different orders.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nTake the order red, blue, green:\n\nProbability: (5/10) \u00d7 (3/9) \u00d7 (2/8) = (1/2) \u00d7 (1/3) \u00d7 (1/4) = 1/24.\n\nNow, how many different orders are there? There are 3 colors, and I'm drawing one of each, so the number of different orders is 3! = 6.\n\nTherefore, total probability = 6 \u00d7 (1/24) = 6/24 = 1/4 = 0.25, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nGood, both methods give the same answer, so I can be confident that 0.25 is the correct probability.\n\nLet me just make sure there aren't any other factors to consider. Is there any chance that some balls might be identical in color but different in some other way that's not specified? The problem just mentions colors, so I think it's safe to assume that all balls of the same color are identical.\n\nAlso, since it's drawing without replacement, I don't need to consider the possibility of drawing the same ball multiple times.\n\nSo, overall, I think the probability is indeed 25%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.25} \\]"
