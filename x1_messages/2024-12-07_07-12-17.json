        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a reality show with 16 contestants, and each week one contestant is eliminated until only one remains as the winner. The prize money starts at $10,000 in the first week and doubles every subsequent week. We need to calculate the total prize money awarded throughout the entire season, including the grand prize for the winner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how many weeks the show will run. Since there are 16 contestants and one is eliminated each week, the show will have 15 weeks of eliminations, with the last contestant being the winner.\n\nWait a minute, let's think about that again. If there are 16 contestants and one is eliminated each week, then in week 1, one contestant is eliminated, leaving 15. In week 2, another is eliminated, leaving 14, and so on, until week 15, when only two contestants remain. Then in week 16, the final elimination happens, leaving one winner. So, actually, there are 16 weeks in total.\n\nBut, the prize money starts at $10,000 in the first week and doubles every subsequent week. So, in week 1: $10,000, week 2: $20,000, week 3: $40,000, and so on.\n\nWait, but this seems off. If the prize money doubles every week, it would be increasing exponentially, which might not make sense in the context of a reality show's prize structure. But, according to the problem, it does say that the prize money doubles every subsequent week.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to calculate the prize money for each week and then sum them up.\n\nLet's denote the prize money in week n as P_n.\n\nGiven that P_1 = $10,000, and P_n = P_{n-1} * 2 for n > 1.\n\nSo, P_1 = $10,000\n\nP_2 = $20,000\n\nP_3 = $40,000\n\n...\n\nP_n = $10,000 * 2^{(n-1)}\n\nSince there are 16 weeks, n ranges from 1 to 16.\n\nThe total prize money awarded throughout the season is the sum of P_n from n=1 to n=16.\n\nSo, total prize money S = P_1 + P_2 + ... + P_16\n\nThis is a geometric series with first term a = $10,000, common ratio r = 2, and number of terms n = 16.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is given by S = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nS = 10,000 * (2^{16} - 1) / (2 - 1)\n\nS = 10,000 * (65,536 - 1) / 1\n\nS = 10,000 * 65,535\n\nS = $655,350,000\n\nWait, that seems extraordinarily high. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\n2^{16} is indeed 65,536.\n\nSo, 65,536 - 1 = 65,535\n\nThen, 10,000 * 65,535 = 655,350,000\n\nYes, that seems correct mathematicaly, but intuitively, a total prize pool of over $655 million for a reality show seems unrealistic.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup.\n\nLet me reconsider: the prize money increases incrementally based on the number of weeks a contestant stays in the competition. In the first week, the prize is $10,000, and it doubles every subsequent week.\n\nDoes this mean that each eliminated contestant receives the prize money corresponding to the week they were eliminated?\n\nFor example, the contestant eliminated in week 1 gets $10,000, week 2 gets $20,000, and so on, up to week 16.\n\nIf that's the case, then the total prize money is indeed the sum of the prizes for each week.\n\nBut again, that would total $655,350,000, which seems unfeasible for a reality show.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the prize money is awarded only to the final winner, with the amount doubling each week.\n\nFor instance, if the show progresses through 16 weeks, the winner gets the prize corresponding to week 16, which would be $10,000 * 2^{15} = $10,000 * 32,768 = $327,680,000\n\nAgain, that's still a huge amount.\n\nWait, perhaps the prize money is accumulated week by week. Meaning, the winner gets the sum of all weekly prizes.\n\nBut that would still be the same as the first calculation, $655,350,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the prize money doubles, but it's added to a cumulative prize that the current leader holds.\n\nBut that still seems to lead to a very high total prize.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the prize money doubles, but it's the increment per week, not the total prize per week.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the prize money increases incrementally based on the number of weeks a contestant stays in the competition. In the first week, the prize money is $10,000, and it doubles every subsequent week.\"\n\nThis seems to indicate that each week, the prize money for that week is double the previous week's prize.\n\nSo, week 1: $10,000\n\nWeek 2: $20,000\n\nWeek 3: $40,000\n\n...\n\nWeek 16: $10,000 * 2^{15} = $327,680,000\n\nThen, the total prize money would be the sum of all these weekly prizes.\n\nBut as calculated earlier, that's $655,350,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the winner gets the prize corresponding to the last week they were in the competition.\n\nBut in that case, since the winner stays for all 16 weeks, they would get the prize of week 16, which is $327,680,000.\n\nBut the problem says \"the prize money increases incrementally based on the number of weeks a contestant stays in the competition.\"\n\nThis suggests that the longer a contestant stays in the competition, the more their prize money increases.\n\nTherefore, the winner, who stays for all 16 weeks, would receive the prize corresponding to week 16, which is $327,680,000.\n\nBut the problem also says \"the show's prize money increases incrementally based on the number of weeks a contestant stays in the competition.\"\n\nThis could be interpreted in two ways:\n\n1. Each contestant receives a prize based on the number of weeks they stayed, with the prize increasing each week.\n\nIn this case, the total prize money would be the sum of prizes for all eliminated contestants plus the prize for the winner.\n\n2. Only the winner receives the prize, which is determined by the number of weeks they stayed in the competition.\n\nIn this case, the total prize money is just the prize for the final week.\n\nGiven that the problem mentions \"the show's prize money increases incrementally based on the number of weeks a contestant stays in the competition,\" it seems more likely that it's referring to the winner's prize increasing each week they remain in the competition.\n\nTherefore, the total prize money awarded throughout the season is just the prize for the final week, which is week 16: $10,000 * 2^{15} = $327,680,000.\n\nHowever, this seems inconsistent with the phrasing \"the show's prize money increases incrementally based on the number of weeks a contestant stays in the competition.\" This could imply that each week, the prize money for that week is higher, and multiple contestants receive prizes based on how long they stay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the prize money accumulates for the winner only.\n\nTo resolve this ambiguity, let's consider the problem again.\n\n\"The show's prize money increases incrementally based on the number of weeks a contestant stays in the competition. In the first week, the prize money is $10,000, and it doubles every subsequent week.\"\n\nThis seems to describe how the prize money grows over the course of the competition.\n\n\"Calculate the total prize money awarded throughout the entire season, including the grand prize for the winner.\"\n\nSo, we need to calculate the total prize money awarded to all contestants throughout the season, with the prize money increasing each week.\n\nGiven that, it makes sense that each eliminated contestant receives the prize money corresponding to the week they were eliminated, and the winner receives the prize corresponding to the final week.\n\nTherefore, the total prize money is the sum of the prizes for all 16 weeks.\n\nAs calculated earlier, this is a geometric series:\n\nS = 10,000 * (2^{16} - 1) / (2 - 1) = 10,000 * (65,536 - 1) = 10,000 * 65,535 = $655,350,000\n\nHowever, this amount seems excessively high for a reality show's prize pool, which makes me question whether the interpretation is correct.\n\nPerhaps there's another way to interpret the problem.\n\nLet's consider that the prize money doubles every week, but it's the incremental prize for each week, and the total prize is the cumulative sum for the winner.\n\nIn this case, the winner would receive the sum of all weekly prizes:\n\nWeek 1: $10,000\n\nWeek 2: $20,000\n\n...\n\nWeek 16: $327,680,000\n\nTotal: $655,350,000\n\nAgain, this leads to the same high total.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the prize money doubles, but it's the incremental prize added each week to the final winner's prize.\n\nIn this case, the total prize would still be the sum of the geometric series, leading to the same total.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the prize money doubles, but it's the grand prize that the winner receives at the end.\n\nIn this case, the total prize money would be just the prize for the final week: $327,680,000.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with the phrase \"the show's prize money increases incrementally based on the number of weeks a contestant stays in the competition.\"\n\nThis suggests that the prize money increases over time, implying that contestants who stay longer receive higher prizes.\n\nTherefore, it's more plausible that each eliminated contestant receives the prize corresponding to the week they were eliminated, and the winner receives the prize for the final week.\n\nThus, the total prize money is the sum of prizes for all weeks: $655,350,000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the winner receives the prize, which is determined by the number of weeks they stayed in the competition.\n\nIn this case, the total prize money would be the prize for week 16: $327,680,000.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, both interpretations are possible, leading to different total prize amounts.\n\nHowever, considering the instruction to calculate the total prize money awarded throughout the entire season, including the grand prize for the winner, it seems more comprehensive to consider prizes for all eliminated contestants plus the winner.\n\nTherefore, the total prize money is the sum of the prizes for all 16 weeks: $655,350,000.\n\nBut to confirm, let's consider the structure of typical reality shows.\n\nIn many reality shows, each eliminated contestant receives a consolation prize, with the winner receiving the grand prize.\n\nIf that's the case here, then the total prize money would be the sum of all individual prizes.\n\nHowever, in this problem, it's specified that the prize money increases incrementally based on the number of weeks a contestant stays in the competition, starting at $10,000 and doubling each week.\n\nTherefore, each week's prize is higher than the previous week's, and the winner, who stays the longest, receives the highest prize.\n\nThus, the total prize money is the sum of the prizes for all weeks.\n\nGiven that, the calculation stands: S = $655,350,000.\n\nAlternatively, if the prize money only applies to the winner, then it would be only the prize for week 16: $327,680,000.\n\nBut the problem specifies \"the show's prize money increases incrementally based on the number of weeks a contestant stays in the competition,\" which suggests that contestants who stay longer receive higher prizes.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that each eliminated contestant receives a prize corresponding to the week they were eliminated, with the winner receiving the prize for the final week.\n\nHence, the total prize money is the sum of all weekly prizes: $655,350,000.\n\nGiven the mathematical calculation and the problem's wording, this seems to be the correct total prize money awarded throughout the entire season.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{655350000} \\]"
