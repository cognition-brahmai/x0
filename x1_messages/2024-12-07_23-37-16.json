        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a tree grows 2 inches taller every year. I need to figure out how tall it will be after 50 years, and it started at 10 feet tall. The hint is to remember to convert units correctly, which makes me think that inches and feet are involved, and I need to handle that carefully.\n\nFirst, I should note down what I know:\n\n- Initial height: 10 feet\n\n- Growth per year: 2 inches\n\n- Time: 50 years\n\nMy goal is to find the total height after 50 years.\n\nI think the best approach is to calculate the total growth over 50 years and then add that to the initial height.\n\nSo, growth over 50 years = 2 inches/year * 50 years = 100 inches.\n\nNow, I need to add this growth to the initial height. But the initial height is in feet, and the growth is in inches. I need to make sure both are in the same unit before adding them.\n\nI can choose to convert everything to inches or everything to feet. Maybe converting everything to feet would be better because the initial height is given in feet.\n\nFirst, convert the initial height to inches:\n\n10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches.\n\nNow, add the growth: 120 inches + 100 inches = 220 inches.\n\nThen, convert the total height back to feet:\n\n220 inches / 12 inches/foot = 18.333... feet.\n\nAlternatively, I could have kept the initial height in feet and converted the growth to feet.\n\nLet's try that:\n\nGrowth over 50 years: 2 inches/year * 50 years = 100 inches.\n\nConvert 100 inches to feet: 100 inches / 12 inches/foot = 8.333... feet.\n\nNow, add this to the initial height: 10 feet + 8.333... feet = 18.333... feet.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is good.\n\nBut the problem might expect the answer in feet and inches. For example, 18 feet and 4 inches, since 0.333... of a foot is approximately 4 inches.\n\nTo convert the decimal part to inches:\n\n0.333... feet * 12 inches/foot = 4 inches.\n\nSo, the total height is 18 feet 4 inches.\n\nWait a minute, is 0.333... exactly equal to 1/3, and 1/3 of 12 inches is exactly 4 inches. So, yes, it's 18 feet 4 inches.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the total height in inches and then convert to feet and inches.\n\nTotal height: 120 inches (initial) + 100 inches (growth) = 220 inches.\n\nNow, to convert 220 inches to feet and inches:\n\nThere are 12 inches in a foot, so divide 220 by 12.\n\n220 \u00f7 12 = 18 with a remainder of 4.\n\nSo, 18 feet 4 inches.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier.\n\nI think the answer should be 18 feet 4 inches.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if the tree grows 2 inches every year starting from the initial height, does that include the initial height or not?\n\nWait, no, the initial height is given as 10 feet, and it grows 2 inches every year after that.\n\nSo, after 1 year, it's 10 feet + 2 inches, after 2 years, 10 feet + 4 inches, and so on.\n\nAfter 50 years, it's 10 feet + 100 inches.\n\nWhich is the same as what I calculated.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of total height as a function of time, it's initial height plus growth rate times time.\n\nH(t) = H0 + r*t, where H0 is initial height, r is growth rate, and t is time.\n\nIn this case, H0 = 10 feet, r = 2 inches/year, t = 50 years.\n\nSo, H(50) = 10 feet + 2 inches/year * 50 years = 10 feet + 100 inches.\n\nThen, convert 100 inches to feet: 100/12 = 8.333... feet.\n\nTotal height: 10 + 8.333... = 18.333... feet, which is 18 feet 4 inches.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the units throughout the calculation to avoid mistakes.\n\nInitial height: 10 feet.\n\nGrowth: 2 inches/year * 50 years = 100 inches.\n\nNow, to add feet and inches, convert one to the other.\n\nI chose to convert feet to inches earlier, but converting inches to feet is also fine.\n\nBoth methods gave the same answer, so I'm confident.\n\nPerhaps I can also think about the growth per year in feet.\n\n2 inches is 2/12 feet, which is 1/6 feet.\n\nSo, growth per year: 1/6 feet.\n\nOver 50 years: 50 * 1/6 = 50/6 = 8.333... feet.\n\nAdd to initial height: 10 + 8.333... = 18.333... feet.\n\nWhich is again 18 feet 4 inches.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed the answer through multiple methods, and they all point to 18 feet 4 inches.\n\nSo, the tree will be 18 feet 4 inches tall after 50 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18\\ \\text{feet}\\ 4\\ \\text{inches}} \\]"
