In this movie, Paparazzo is a photographer who works for a gossip magazine, and his name has since been adopted to refer to photographers who pursue celebrities to take their pictures, often in intrusive or aggressive ways. So, to answer your question directly, the film is \"La Dolce Vita\" by Federico Fellini, released in 1960."
