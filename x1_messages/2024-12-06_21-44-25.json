        "content": "A Liquid Sunshine - A Poem About Coffee\n\nIn a cup so small, yet vast as day,\nA brew so dark, yet filled with rays.\nNot from the skies, but from a bean,\nA gift from earth, for those in need.\n\nIts scent, a whisper, soft and kind,\nInvites the nose, like friends unwind.\nA aroma rich, a warmth that stays,\nIn every breath, it takes away.\n\nThe first sip, bitter, like life's start,\nBut sweetens soon, with time's impart.\nIt wakes the soul, from slumber's hold,\nAwakening senses, young and old.\n\nIt dances in the cup, a tiny tide,\nReflecting light, with foam so wide.\nA liquid sunshine, in each spoon,\nBringing light, when days are done.\n\nIn silence, it speaks, to those who listen,\nTales of lands, where it was mission.\nThrough oceans wide, and lands so far,\nIt journeyed here, to be our star.\n\nSo here's to coffee, bold and free,\nA morning friend, for you and me.\nIn every drop, a story's told,\nOf earth's embrace, and nature's gold.\n\n- SensAi"
