        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of 30 people. Among them, 18 play football, 16 play basketball, and 10 play both sports. We need to find out how many people don't play either sport.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many people play at least one of the sports, and then subtract that number from the total number of people to find those who don't play any sport.\n\nI recall there's a principle in set theory called the inclusion-exclusion principle that might be useful here. It helps to avoid double-counting when dealing with overlapping sets.\n\nSo, according to the inclusion-exclusion principle, the number of people who play either football or basketball is equal to the number who play football plus the number who play basketball minus the number who play both.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- F as the number of people who play football.\n\n- B as the number of people who play basketball.\n\n- Both as the number of people who play both sports.\n\nGiven:\n\nF = 18\n\nB = 16\n\nBoth = 10\n\nTotal number of people who play at least one sport = F + B - Both = 18 + 16 - 10 = 24\n\nNow, the total number of people in the group is 30. So, the number of people who don't play either sport should be the total number minus those who play at least one sport.\n\nSo, number of people who don't play either sport = Total - (F + B - Both) = 30 - 24 = 6\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf 18 play football and 16 play basketball, and 10 play both, then the number who play only football is 18 - 10 = 8, and the number who play only basketball is 16 - 10 = 6. So, total number who play at least one sport is 8 (only football) + 6 (only basketball) + 10 (both) = 24.\n\nYes, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, 30 - 24 = 6 people don't play either sport.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way is to use a Venn diagram. Imagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents football players, and the other represents basketball players.\n\n- The overlap (both sports) has 10 people.\n\n- Only football is 18 - 10 = 8.\n\n- Only basketball is 16 - 10 = 6.\n\nSo, adding up the parts: 8 (only football) + 6 (only basketball) + 10 (both) = 24.\n\nAgain, 30 - 24 = 6.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the union of two sets:\n\nn(A \u222a B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \u2229 B)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n(A) is the number of people who play football (18)\n\n- n(B) is the number of people who play basketball (16)\n\n- n(A \u2229 B) is the number who play both (10)\n\nSo, n(A \u222a B) = 18 + 16 - 10 = 24\n\nAnd again, total people minus those who play at least one sport: 30 - 24 = 6.\n\nI think this is consistent across different methods, so I'm confident that the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that some people might be playing other sports or something like that. The problem says \"play either football or basketball,\" and specifies the numbers accordingly.\n\nAssuming that the only sports being considered are football and basketball, and there are no other sports mentioned, then my calculation should hold.\n\nAlternatively, if there were other sports, the problem would probably specify that, but since it doesn't, I think it's safe to assume that the only sports being considered are football and basketball.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who do not play either sport is 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
