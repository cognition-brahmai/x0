        "content": "Actually, fortune cookies are not an ancient Chinese tradition. They are a relatively modern invention and are primarily associated with American Chinese cuisine. The origin of fortune cookies is a bit unclear, but they first appeared in the United States in the early 20th century. They are often served as dessert in Chinese restaurants in the US and contain a small piece of paper with a \"fortune\" or a wise saying inside. So, while they might be popular in Chinese restaurants, they don't have deep roots in traditional Chinese culture."
