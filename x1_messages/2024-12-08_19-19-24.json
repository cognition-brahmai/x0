The expression is:\n\n((4^2) / (8 - 3)) * 6 - 10\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\n1. Calculate the exponent: 4^2\n\n4^2 = 16\n\n2. Calculate the subtraction in the denominator: 8 - 3\n\n8 - 3 = 5\n\nNow the expression becomes:\n\n(16 / 5) * 6 - 10\n\nNext, perform the division:\n\n16 / 5 = 3.2\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n3.2 * 6 - 10\n\nThen, perform the multiplication:\n\n3.2 * 6 = 19.2\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n19.2 - 10\n\nFinally, perform the subtraction:\n\n19.2 - 10 = 9.2\n\nSo, the final answer is 9.2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9.2} \\]"
