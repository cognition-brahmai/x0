The term is borrowed from the Harry Potter series, where it denotes a person who lacks magical abilities and is not part of the wizarding world. In geocaching, muggles are those who don't participate in the sport and might not understand what geocachers are doing when they're searching for or interacting with caches. It's important for geocachers to be discreet to avoid drawing attention from muggles and to maintain the integrity and fun of the game."
