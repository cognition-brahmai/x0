I've chosen Jane Austen and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, as they are both highly influential in their respective literary traditions.\n\n**Jane Austen**\n\nJane Austen was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels, which interpret, critique and comment upon the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security.\n\nEarly Life:\nJane Austen was born on December 16, 1775, in Steventon, Hampshire, England. She was the seventh child of George Austen, a rector, and Cassandra Austen. Jane and her sister Cassandra were educated at home, receiving a curriculum typical for girls of their class, which included reading, writing, music, and French. Austen began writing at a young age, and her early works, including burlesques of popular novels, revealed her wit and talent.\n\nMajor Works:\nAusten's major works include \"Sense and Sensibility\" (1811), \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1813), \"Mansfield Park\" (1814), \"Emma\" (1815), \"Northanger Abbey\" (posthumously published in 1818), and \"Persuasion\" (also posthumously published in 1818). These novels are known for their realism, biting irony, and social commentary.\n\nWriting Style:\nAusten's writing style is characterized by her use of free indirect speech, which blends the narrator's voice with that of the characters, allowing readers deep insight into their thoughts and feelings. Her novels are also famous for their sharp wit and satirical portrayals of English landed society.\n\nInfluence on Literature:\nAusten's works have had a significant influence on literature and popular culture. Her novels have been adapted numerous times into films, television series, and plays. Moreover, her exploration of women's lives and her critique of social norms have inspired generations of writers. Austen is often credited with influencing the development of the modern novel, particularly in her focus on character and the importance of domestic settings.\n\n**Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez**\n\nGabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was a Colombian novelist, short-story writer, screenwriter, and journalist, known affectionately as Gabo or Gabito throughout Latin America. He was born on March 6, 1927, in Aracataca, Colombia, a small town near the Caribbean coast. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez is widely considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century and one of the leading figures of magical realism, a literary style that blends realistic depictions of the real world with magical elements.\n\nEarly Life:\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was born to Gabriel Eligio Garc\u00eda and Luisa Santiaga M\u00e1rquez Iguar\u00e1n. His father was a postal clerk and telegraph operator who later became a pharmacist and owner of a general store. His mother was a teacher. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was raised by his maternal grandparents, Do\u00f1a Tranquilina Iguar\u00e1n and Colonel Nicolas Ricardo M\u00e1rquez Mej\u00eda, who inspired much of his writing. He studied law at the National University of Colombia but later switched to journalism.\n\nMajor Works:\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's major works include \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" (1967), \"Love in the Time of Cholera\" (1985), and \"Chronicle of a Death Foretold\" (1981). \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" is often considered his masterpiece and one of the supreme achievements in 20th-century literature. It tells the story of seven generations of the Buend\u00eda family in the fictional town of Macondo.\n\nWriting Style:\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez is renowned for his innovative writing style, which combined realistic depictions of Latin American life with elements of fantasy and myth. This style, known as magical realism, allows supernatural or magical elements to coexist seamlessly with the real world, reflecting the region's cultural and historical realities.\n\nInfluence on Literature:\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's influence on literature is profound. His works have been translated into dozens of languages and have sold millions of copies worldwide. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982. His use of magical realism has inspired countless writers around the world, and his exploration of themes such as love, power, and the human condition continues to resonate with readers today.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth Jane Austen and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez have left indelible marks on the literary world. Austen's sharp social commentary and realistic portrayals of women's lives in early 19th-century England continue to captivate readers, while Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's innovative use of magical realism to explore the human experience has influenced generations of writers. Their works remain timeless testaments to the power of literature to illuminate the human condition."
