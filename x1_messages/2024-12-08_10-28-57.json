SANJAY GUPTA, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Jake was 12 when he found out he would lose his other eye. But former USC head coach Pete Carroll heard Jake\\'s story. He knew the boy was a huge lifelong fan and invited him to meet the team. OLSON: That team was there for me in my darkest hours. It\\'s something that I will always be grateful for. GUPTA: Despite losing his eyesight, Jake played football in high school. OLSON: A lot of it is just feel. GUPTA: Last year, he brought that talent to USC as a walk-on player for his beloved team. OLSON: I went in to play football with the mentality that I had nothing to lose. Life is unfair, but it\\'s taught me to keep fighting. GUPTA: Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN, reporting. BROOKE BALDWIN, CNN ANCHOR: And we continue on. You\\'re watching CNN\\'s special live coverage here from George Mason University. I\\'m in Fairfax, Virginia, today, where just hours from now, President Obama will face critics and supporters of his executive actions on guns this week during a town hall tonight here live on CNN. Let me be clear. Both the NRA and Gun Owners of America have declined CNN\\'s invitation to take part here, but we should note, despite that, there will be many NRA members and gun rights advocates in the audience. I will speak live with both sides here in just a moment. But, first, let me take you to Paris, breaking news out of France today, where schools went on lockdown, shops closed, streets got blocked off after this man wielding a butcher knife with fake explosives strapped to his body reportedly yelled Allahu akbar as he was trying to rush this Paris police station. Officers responded very quickly, shooting, killing this unidentified man. But here\\'s what they found on his body. They found a piece of paper with the ISIS flag printed on it. This is all happening -- just a little context for you -- this is now one year to the day, to the minutes after jihadists stormed the office of the satirical call newspaper/magazine \"Charlie Hebdo\" killing 12 people. The anti-terrorism branch of the Paris prosecutor\\'s office is investigating today\\'s incident. I have terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank joining me now. Paul, before we talk about -- anymore about \"Charlie Hebdo\" or even new information you have on the Paris attacks from November, talk to me about what\\'s your read on who appears to have acted alone, fake explosives? What\\'s your interpretation? PAUL CRUICKSHANK, CNN TERRORISM ANALYST: Well, there\\'s some very bizarre details that we\\'re learning, especially those details, Brooke, about the fake explosives. It suggests that this individual perhaps wanted to die, welcomed being shot, but it certainly has all the attributes of an ISIS-inspired attack and literally to the minute a year after the \"Charlie Hebdo\" attack, which was 11:30 a.m. a year ago, this attack 11:30 a.m. this morning here in Paris. Surely, that\\'s not, Brooke, a coincidence, given that timing similarity. But they are also learning that he made some pledge of allegiance, it appears, to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. We have seen that before in other ISIS-inspired plots. I have speaking to counterterrorism officials across Europe over the last few weeks. And what they are very concerned about is copycat attacks following the Paris attacks here in November. That really inspired these hard-line radicals in Europe. And from their monitoring, they have really been able to pick up the fact that it\\'s electrified that jihadi movement over here. There are a lot of concerns that we may see more of these ISIS- inspired attempts in the days ahead. BALDWIN: You mentioned the Paris attacks happened in November, those coordinated terrorist attacks in the city. You have new information on that today. Please share. CRUICKSHANK: Really stunning new information, Brooke, and this comes from a senior Belgian counterterrorism official, that there are two senior members of the conspiracy still at large who the night of the attacks, before the attacks, after were communicating with the Paris attackers from Brussels. These were two individuals who were actually identified on December 4 by Belgian authorities. But, at that time, they did not disclose their senior role in the plot, but they were able to do wiretaps, they were able to find out the contents of some of these communications. And it suggested they were more senior than Abdelhamid Abaaoud in this conspiracy. They are still at large. They feel like they have now identified their real identities, their real names and they hope they can obviously make arrests, but clearly a lot of concern. They are considered armed and dangerous. They could be plotting a new wave of attacks potentially here in Europe. One other detail that I have also received just recently from a senior European counterterrorism official is that ISIS operatives in Syria and Iraq from Europe are increasingly faking their own death. And this is very recent intelligence. And the concern is that some of these individuals may come back to Europe to launch attacks, real concerned about that tonight in Europe, Brooke. BALDWIN: That is indeed worrisome if that is the case. Paul Cruickshank tonight for us there in Paris, Paul, as always, thank you so much. To politics, we go, Burlington, Vermont. It\\'s a pretty small town, though facing one very large problem all because of one man, Donald Trump. In less than four hours from now, the Republican front-runner will be holding a rally there. Nothing unusual about that. Lines are already forming. OK. But perhaps folks know Trump that had sent out 20,000 free tickets for a venue with just 1,400 seats. Do the math. His campaign told police that 6,500 people have confirmed they are coming. Again, the venue only seats 1,400. Police say they will turn people away once the Flynn Center for Performing Arts hits capacity. Let\\'s go now there to Burlington to our senior Washington correspondent, Jeff Zeleny. Jeff Zeleny, I talked to the police chief earlier and said we have got this. People should be able to come and attend. Just wish they had a little more heads-up. How is the line looking? JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Brooke, I can tell you the line is growing as we stand here. And we\\'re still several hours before this event here. But I\\'m joined now by the executive director of the Flynn Center, John Killacky. And, John, tell me, how many people can this venue hold inside here? JOHN KILLACKY, FLYNN CENTER FOR PERFORMING ARTS: Well, 1,400. ZELENY: So this line looks, as I\\'m just eyeballing it, looks more than that. How are you planning to proceed in the next few hours? Is this your problem or the Trump\\'s campaign problem? KILLACKY: I think it\\'s a good problem, but it\\'s actually not a problem. Once we first come in, they will be seated and once we\\'re full, we\\'re full. The fire marshal will say we\\'re done. ZELENY: What does this line resemble? I know you have a lot of concerns and other types of events here. Is this big for a political crowd? What\\'s this line more look like to you? KILLACKY: We\\'re a performing arts center that mostly has shows. We have had lines longer than this for some of the acts that have been at the Flynn. We have done occasionally -- Senator Leahy did a fund-raiser with us. We did some mayoral forums. We have five people running for governor right now. We had them on the stage. So it\\'s a little atypical, but it\\'s OK what we do as well because we\\'re a civic institution. We receive federal and state dollars and we\\'re kind of glad to have the candidates running for president wanting to speak to Vermonters. ZELENY: As you know, Bernie Sanders, we\\'re in the hometown of Bernie Sanders. He was the mayor here from 1981 to 1989 and of course is still the senator. Surprised that there\\'s big of a Trump crowd in Burlington, Vermont? KILLACKY: There\\'s a crowd of Vermonters who want to listen to this candidate. I\\'m not sure it\\'s a Trump crowd. I\\'m not sure it\\'s a Bernie crowd. I think it\\'s an interested crowd. And that\\'s the greatest thing. People are coming to hear somebody. By having them here, we\\'re not endorsing anybody. ZELENY: Sure. KILLACKY: When Bernie wanted to announce, I was talking to his wife, Jane. And I said, bring him to the Flynn. Announce from the Flynn. She said, it\\'s too small. They did it at the waterfront. ZELENY: Great. John, thank you very much. We will see you inside later. We\\'re just going to walk down the line just a little bit here and see. As far as the eye can see, you can see people lining up for it. And, Ian (ph), I wonder if I could talk with you for just a second here. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here. ZELENY: You are an undecided voter standing in this line. Is that correct? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. ZELENY: Tell me why you came out today. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To see the comedy show. ZELENY: The comedy show? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, Donald Trump. He\\'s a comedian. He\\'s coming to the Flynn here. Claims he\\'s a politician. But I\\'m here to hear what he\\'s got to say. I don\\'t know why he\\'s coming to Vermont. ZELENY: So, safe to say you\\'re not a Donald Trump supporter, though? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I appreciate the ability for him to -- for free speech, and coming to say what he wants, but I won\\'t support him. ZELENY: But you\\'re standing in line a long time to not support someone. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I live around the block. I have been here for an hour-and-a-half maybe. It\\'s not... ZELENY: Not bad. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It\\'s not cold. It\\'s a beautiful day here in Vermont. ZELENY: But to give a full picture, it looks like we have a Trump supporter standing right here. Sir, what is your name? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One hundred percent. ZELENY: Sir, what is your name? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Steve. ZELENY: Steve, why are you standing out here? What do you think of Donald Trump coming to Burlington, Vermont? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do I think? ZELENY: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don\\'t have to think. He\\'s the man. Our country needs a person that\\'s going to stand up and work for our country, not for me, for the country. ZELENY: When people think of Burlington, Vermont, a lot of people think liberal, a lot of people think Senator Bernie Sanders. Do you think that there are a lot of Trump supporters in the state of Vermont and here today? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. ZELENY: But some? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Some. ZELENY: Are you surprised that Mr. Trump is coming to Burlington, Vermont? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. ZELENY: Why not? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He belongs here. ZELENY: On what issues specifically? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This country needs change, including from... ZELENY: Vermont is one of the states that actually has a Super Tuesday state. The voting is on March 1 here, so after Iowa, after New Hampshire. Are you confident that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee or do you think that he has a tough road ahead of him? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He will be. ZELENY: OK. Well, good luck getting in here. It\\'s a big crowd. It looks like you should make it. I don\\'t think we\\'re back to 1,500 here. Thank you very much. OK. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And I still stand up, no matter where it\\'s got to be. ZELENY: Right. So, Brooke, as you can see, the line is pretty long here. It stretches as far as I can see. We have about four hours until it begins here. And we will be inside throughout the day here -- back to you in Virginia. BALDWIN: Amazing. Amazing. Amazing hearing from the people. One is going for the comedy show. One is going because he doesn\\'t have to think because Donald Trump is the man. Jeff Zeleny, thank you very much. We will be watching you there in Vermont. Let\\'s move on to talk about this nasty day on Wall Street. Amid financial turmoil in China, the Dow went really into freefall today. Started on the wrong foot, opening down more than 300 points on the heels of China\\'s stock market crash. China\\'s tumble was apparently so severe, trading was halted for the second time this week. BALDWIN: Just ahead here on CNN, Donald Trump today from his campaign, this new video. You seen this? it specifically targeting Hillary Clinton and there are all kinds of faces in this video, including Monica Lewinsky and Bill Cosby. We have that as Trump\\'s rival deals with new concerns about his eligibility. Of course, talking about the Texas Senator Ted Cruz. And President Obama gets ready to face both critics and supporters of his executive actions on guns. Both sides of the debate will join me live here. And just two days ago, search crews found the body of a country singer who went missing during a hunting trip. His wife joins me live on what happened, what she missing, how she\\'s mourning ,their final conversation together. Do not miss this. You\\'re watching CNN\\'s special live coverage here from George Mason University.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 10 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
