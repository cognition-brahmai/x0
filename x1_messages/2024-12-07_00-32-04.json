        "content": "Let's see. There are 50 people in total in the room. Some have blue eyes, some have green eyes, and the rest have brown eyes. It says that there are twice as many people with green eyes as there are with blue eyes, and that 20 people have brown eyes. I need to find out how many people have blue eyes.\n\nFirst, I should probably define variables for the number of people with each eye color. Let's say:\n\n- Let B be the number of people with blue eyes.\n\n- Then, since there are twice as many people with green eyes as blue eyes, the number of people with green eyes is 2B.\n\n- And it's given that 20 people have brown eyes.\n\nSo, the total number of people is the sum of people with blue, green, and brown eyes. That is:\n\nB + 2B + 20 = 50\n\nCombining like terms, that's 3B + 20 = 50.\n\nNow, I need to solve for B. Subtract 20 from both sides:\n\n3B = 30\n\nThen, divide both sides by 3:\n\nB = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 people with blue eyes.\n\nBut wait, let me check if this makes sense. If B = 10, then green eyes are 2B = 20, and brown eyes are 20. Total is 10 + 20 + 20 = 50, which matches the total number of people. Okay, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
