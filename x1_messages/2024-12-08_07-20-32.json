        "content": "Let's tackle this pizza problem step by step. So, we've got a pizza shop that sells two types of pizzas: Veggie and Pepperoni. On Monday, they sold a total of 60 pizzas, and it's said that they sold twice as many Veggie pizzas as Pepperoni pizzas. We need to find out how many of each type they sold.\n\nFirst, I think I should define some variables to represent the unknowns. Let's let:\n\n- \\( P \\) represent the number of Pepperoni pizzas sold.\n\n- Since they sold twice as many Veggie pizzas as Pepperoni, I can represent the number of Veggie pizzas as \\( 2P \\).\n\nNow, according to the problem, the total number of pizzas sold is 60. So, the sum of Veggie and Pepperoni pizzas should equal 60. That gives me the equation:\n\n\\[ P + 2P = 60 \\]\n\nSimplifying that, I get:\n\n\\[ 3P = 60 \\]\n\nTo find \\( P \\), I'll divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\]\n\nSo, they sold 20 Pepperoni pizzas. Now, since Veggie pizzas are twice that amount, I can calculate:\n\n\\[ 2P = 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, they sold 40 Veggie pizzas.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If they sold 20 Pepperoni and 40 Veggie, that does add up to 60, and 40 is indeed twice 20. So, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the ratio of Veggie to Pepperoni pizzas. Since Veggie is twice Pepperoni, the ratio is 2:1. That means for every 3 pizzas sold, 2 are Veggie and 1 is Pepperoni.\n\nSo, if we divide the total pizzas by 3:\n\n\\[ \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\]\n\nThen, Pepperoni pizzas are 1 part, which is 20, and Veggie pizzas are 2 parts, which is 40. Same result as before.\n\nI think this confirms that the answer is 20 Pepperoni pizzas and 40 Veggie pizzas.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. The problem states that they sold twice as many Veggie pizzas as Pepperoni pizzas. So, it's clear that Veggie pizzas are twice the Pepperoni pizzas.\n\nI don't think there's any ambiguity here. So, I'm confident with the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThey sold \\(\\boxed{20}\\) Pepperoni pizzas and \\(\\boxed{40}\\) Veggie pizzas.\n"
