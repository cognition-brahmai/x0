        "content": "Certainly! To calculate the area of a triangle when you know the lengths of all three sides, you can use Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle whose sides have lengths a, b, and c is:\n\nArea = \u221a[s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)]\n\nwhere s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle:\n\ns = (a + b + c) / 2\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_triangle_area(a, b, c):\n    # Calculate the semi-perimeter\n    s = (a + b + c) / 2\n    # Calculate the area using Heron's formula\n    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))\n    return area\n\n# Example usage:\n# side_a = 3\n# side_b = 4\n# side_c = 5\n# print(calculate_triangle_area(side_a, side_b, side_c))  # Output should be 6.0 for a 3-4-5 right triangle\n```\n\nThis function takes three arguments, which are the lengths of the sides of the triangle, and returns the area. Make sure to provide positive real numbers for the side lengths, and that the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side to form a valid triangle.\n\nIf you want to handle cases where the input sides do not form a valid triangle, you can add a check for the triangle inequality theorem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_triangle_area(a, b, c):\n    # Check if the sides form a valid triangle\n    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:\n        raise ValueError(\"The provided sides do not form a valid triangle.\")\n    \n    # Calculate the semi-perimeter\n    s = (a + b + c) / 2\n    # Calculate the area using Heron's formula\n    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))\n    return area\n\n# Example usage:\n# side_a = 3\n# side_b = 4\n# side_c = 5\n# print(calculate_triangle_area(side_a, side_b, side_c))  # Output should be 6.0\n```\n\nThis version of the function will raise a ValueError if the provided side lengths do not satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, ensuring that only valid triangles are processed."
