        "content": "Alright, I need to create a JavaScript function that finds the intersection of two arrays of integers and returns their common elements sorted in ascending order. Also, the function should have a time complexity of O(n log n) or better. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, understanding what intersection means: it's the set of elements that are common to both arrays. So, if I have two arrays, say [1, 2, 3, 4] and [3, 4, 5, 6], their intersection should be [3, 4].\n\nNext, sorting in ascending order means the output should be in increasing order. So, even if the common elements are [4, 3], the output should be [3, 4].\n\nNow, regarding time complexity: O(n log n) or better. This means I need an efficient way to find the intersection without something like a nested loop, which would be O(n\u00b2).\n\nLet me think about different approaches:\n\n1. **Brute Force Approach**: Use two nested loops to compare each element of the first array with each element of the second array. If they match, add them to a result array. This is straightforward but inefficient with a time complexity of O(n\u00b2), which doesn't meet the requirement.\n\n2. **Using Sort and Filter**: First, sort both arrays, which would take O(n log n) time for each sort. Then, use two pointers to traverse both arrays simultaneously and collect common elements. This seems promising because after sorting, the traversal would be O(n), making the overall time complexity O(n log n).\n\n3. **Using a Set**: Convert one array into a set for O(1) lookups, then iterate through the second array and check if each element exists in the set. This would be O(n) for the iteration plus O(n) for set creation, resulting in O(n) time complexity, which is better than O(n log n).\n\nWait, but the problem asks for O(n log n) or better. So O(n) is fine, actually.\n\nLet me consider the set approach in more detail:\n\n- Convert the first array to a set.\n\n- Iterate through the second array, and for each element, check if it exists in the set.\n\n- If it does, add it to the result array.\n\n- Finally, sort the result array in ascending order.\n\nThis seems efficient. Let's think about potential issues.\n\n- Duplicates: If the arrays contain duplicates, this approach will include them in the intersection. But in set theory, intersection contains unique elements. So, should the intersection contain unique elements or preserve duplicates?\n\n- The problem says \"arrays of integers,\" but it doesn't specify whether duplicates are allowed or how to handle them.\n\n- To be safe, I'll assume that the intersection should contain unique elements only, as per set theory.\n\n- Therefore, using a set naturally handles uniqueness.\n\n- Also, sorting the result at the end will ensure the output is in ascending order.\n\nLet me try to write a pseudo-code for this:\n\n```\n\nfunction intersection(arr1, arr2) {\n\n  const set1 = new Set(arr1);\n\n  const result = [];\n\n  for (const num of arr2) {\n\n    if (set1.has(num)) {\n\n      result.push(num);\n\n      set1.delete(num); // to handle uniqueness\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  return result.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis seems okay, but I need to make sure that duplicates are handled correctly.\n\nWait, if I delete from the set after finding a match, it ensures that each element is only included once in the result, which aligns with the set intersection definition.\n\nLet me test this with an example:\n\narr1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]\n\narr2 = [2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nset1 = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4} -> actually, Set in JS will automatically handle uniqueness, so set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nThen, iterating through arr2:\n\n- 2 is in set1, add 2 to result, delete 2 from set1\n\n- next 2 is not in set1 anymore, so skip\n\n- 3 is in set1, add 3, delete 3\n\n- 4 is in set1, add 4, delete 4\n\n- 5 and 6 are not in set1, skip\n\nresult = [2, 3, 4]\n\nsorted result is [2, 3, 4]\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\narr1 = [1, 2, 3]\n\narr2 = [4, 5, 6]\n\nset1 = {1, 2, 3}\n\niterate through arr2:\n\n4 not in set1\n\n5 not in set1\n\n6 not in set1\n\nresult = []\n\nsorted result is []\n\nEmpty intersection, which is correct.\n\nEdge cases:\n\n- One or both arrays are empty: should return an empty array.\n\n- Arrays with negative numbers: should handle negatives correctly.\n\n- Arrays with only one element: should handle single-element arrays.\n\nLet me consider time and space complexity:\n\n- Creating a set from arr1: O(n)\n\n- Iterating through arr2 and checking set: O(m)\n\n- Sorting the result: O(k log k), where k is the number of intersections.\n\n- Overall time complexity: O(n + m + k log k)\n\n- Since k <= min(n, m), the overall time complexity is O(n + m + k log k), which is better than O(n log n) if k is small.\n\n- Space complexity: O(n) for the set + O(k) for the result array.\n\nThis seems acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if I sort both arrays first and then find the intersection, the time complexity would be:\n\n- Sorting both arrays: O(n log n) + O(m log m)\n\n- Finding intersection with two pointers: O(n + m)\n\n- Overall time complexity: O(n log n + m log m)\n\n- Space complexity: O(k) for the result array.\n\nComparing the two approaches:\n\n- Set approach: faster overall if n and m are large, since O(n + m + k log k) is better than O(n log n + m log m) when k is small.\n\n- However, in the set approach, sorting the result at the end is necessary, which is O(k log k).\n\n- In the sorting approach, the arrays are sorted first, which is more expensive, but finding the intersection is faster.\n\nGiven that the problem allows O(n log n) time complexity, both approaches should be acceptable, but the set approach might be more efficient in practice.\n\nBut, to ensure that the function is efficient, I'll proceed with the set approach.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in code.\n\nI need to:\n\n1. Convert the first array to a set.\n\n2. Iterate through the second array, check if each element is in the set.\n\n3. If it is, add it to the result array and remove it from the set to handle uniqueness.\n\n4. Sort the result array in ascending order.\n\n5. Return the sorted result array.\n\nI need to make sure that the function handles edge cases correctly, such as empty arrays or arrays with duplicate elements.\n\nAlso, I should consider the possibility of negative numbers and zeros in the arrays.\n\nLet me write a draft of the function:\n\n```\n\nfunction intersectArrays(arr1, arr2) {\n\n  const set1 = new Set(arr1);\n\n  const result = [];\n\n  for (const num of arr2) {\n\n    if (set1.has(num)) {\n\n      result.push(num);\n\n      set1.delete(num);\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  return result.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis seems straightforward. Now, let's test it with some examples.\n\nTest case 1:\n\narr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\narr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nExpected output: [3, 4]\n\nActual output: [3, 4]\n\nCorrect.\n\nTest case 2:\n\narr1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]\n\narr2 = [2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nExpected output: [2, 3, 4]\n\nActual output: [2, 3, 4]\n\nCorrect.\n\nTest case 3:\n\narr1 = [1, 2, 3]\n\narr2 = [4, 5, 6]\n\nExpected output: []\n\nActual output: []\n\nCorrect.\n\nTest case 4:\n\narr1 = []\n\narr2 = [1, 2, 3]\n\nExpected output: []\n\nActual output: []\n\nCorrect.\n\nTest case 5:\n\narr1 = [1, 2, 3]\n\narr2 = []\n\nExpected output: []\n\nActual output: []\n\nCorrect.\n\nTest case 6:\n\narr1 = [1]\n\narr2 = [1]\n\nExpected output: [1]\n\nActual output: [1]\n\nCorrect.\n\nTest case 7:\n\narr1 = [1]\n\narr2 = [2]\n\nExpected output: []\n\nActual output: []\n\nCorrect.\n\nTest case 8:\n\narr1 = [-1, 0, 1]\n\narr2 = [-1, 1, 2]\n\nExpected output: [-1, 1]\n\nActual output: [-1, 1]\n\nCorrect.\n\nSeems like the function works as expected.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the built-in filter method for a more concise solution:\n\n```\n\nfunction intersectArrays(arr1, arr2) {\n\n  const set1 = new Set(arr1);\n\n  const result = arr2.filter(num => set1.has(num));\n\n  set1.delete(num); // This won't work because filter doesn't mutate the set\n\n  return result.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n\n}\n\n```\n\nWait, but in this case, I can't delete from the set within the filter method because filter doesn't allow side effects like that. So, I need to handle uniqueness differently.\n\nAlternative approach: use a Set to track elements that have been added to the result.\n\n```\n\nfunction intersectArrays(arr1, arr2) {\n\n  const set1 = new Set(arr1);\n\n  const added = new Set();\n\n  const result = arr2.filter(num => set1.has(num) && !added.has(num) && added.add(num));\n\n  return result.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis is tricky because the filter method's callback can't handle multiple operations easily. It's better to stick with the initial approach using a for loop for clarity.\n\nAlternatively, after filtering, I can use a Set on the result to remove duplicates and then sort it.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, by deleting from set1, I ensure uniqueness without needing an additional set.\n\nLet me see:\n\n```\n\nfunction intersectArrays(arr1, arr2) {\n\n  const set1 = new Set(arr1);\n\n  const result = [];\n\n  for (const num of arr2) {\n\n    if (set1.has(num)) {\n\n      result.push(num);\n\n      set1.delete(num);\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  return result.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis seems clean and efficient.\n\nAnother thought: if I want to make it more efficient in terms of space, I could iterate through the smaller array and use a set for the larger array, but in big O notation, it's still the same.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll keep the initial approach.\n\nI think this function meets the requirements: it finds the intersection of two arrays, ensures unique elements, sorts them in ascending order, and has a time complexity of O(n + m + k log k), which is better than O(n log n).\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the intersection of two arrays of integers and return their common elements sorted in ascending order. We aim for a time complexity of O(n log n) or better.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Use a Set for Efficient Lookups**: Convert the first array to a Set for O(1) lookups.\n2. **Collect Common Elements**: Iterate through the second array and check if each element exists in the Set created from the first array. If it does, add it to the result array and remove it from the Set to ensure uniqueness.\n3. **Sort the Result**: Finally, sort the result array in ascending order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle uniqueness naturally using the Set and achieve an efficient time complexity.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```javascript\nfunction intersectArrays(arr1, arr2) {\n  const set1 = new Set(arr1);\n  const result = [];\n  for (const num of arr2) {\n    if (set1.has(num)) {\n      result.push(num);\n      set1.delete(num);\n    }\n  }\n  return result.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Convert to Set**: We convert `arr1` to a Set (`set1`), which provides O(1) time complexity for lookups and ensures uniqueness.\n2. **Find Intersections**: We iterate through `arr2` and check if each element exists in `set1`. If it does, we add it to the `result` array and remove it from `set1` to handle uniqueness.\n3. **Sort the Result**: The `result` array, which contains the intersection of the two arrays, is sorted in ascending order using the `sort` function with a comparator `(a, b) => a - b`.\n\nThis method is efficient and meets the required time complexity of O(n log n) or better, with the actual time complexity being O(n + m + k log k), where n and m are the lengths of the arrays and k is the number of intersections."
