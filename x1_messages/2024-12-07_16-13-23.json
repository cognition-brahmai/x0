        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a car factory that produces 120 cars per day and operates for 250 days a year. We need to find out how many cars it will produce in 3 years, with the production increasing by 10% each year.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The factory's daily production is 120 cars, and it works for 250 days a year. So, annually, it produces 120 cars/day * 250 days/year. That's the initial production rate.\n\nBut there's a catch: the production increases by 10% each year. So, each year, the factory produces 10% more cars than it did the previous year.\n\nLet me break it down year by year.\n\n**Year 1:**\n\nDaily production: 120 cars\n\nOperating days: 250 days\n\nAnnual production: 120 cars/day * 250 days = 30,000 cars\n\n**Year 2:**\n\nProduction increases by 10%, so:\n\nNew daily production: 120 cars/day * 1.10 = 132 cars/day\n\nAnnual production: 132 cars/day * 250 days = 33,000 cars\n\n**Year 3:**\n\nAnother 10% increase from Year 2:\n\nNew daily production: 132 cars/day * 1.10 = 145.2 cars/day\n\nAnnual production: 145.2 cars/day * 250 days = 36,300 cars\n\nNow, to find the total production over 3 years, I'll add up the annual productions:\n\nYear 1: 30,000 cars\n\nYear 2: 33,000 cars\n\nYear 3: 36,300 cars\n\nTotal: 30,000 + 33,000 + 36,300 = 99,300 cars\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to calculate this without doing each year separately? Maybe using the formula for compound interest or something similar, since the production increases by a percentage each year.\n\nLet me think about it. In finance, when you have a quantity that grows by a fixed percentage each year, you can use the compound interest formula:\n\nA = P(1 + r)^n\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the amount after n periods\n\n- P is the principal amount (initial amount)\n\n- r is the rate of increase per period\n\n- n is the number of periods\n\nIn this case, the initial annual production is 120 cars/day * 250 days/year = 30,000 cars/year.\n\nThe production increases by 10% each year, so r = 0.10.\n\nWe want to find the total production over 3 years.\n\nSo, the production each year would be:\n\nYear 1: 30,000 cars\n\nYear 2: 30,000 * 1.10 = 33,000 cars\n\nYear 3: 33,000 * 1.10 = 36,300 cars\n\nTotal: 30,000 + 33,000 + 36,300 = 99,300 cars\n\nAlternatively, using the compound interest approach for the sum:\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is given by:\n\nS = P * ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r\n\nWhere:\n\n- S is the sum of the series\n\n- P is the first term\n\n- r is the common ratio\n\n- n is the number of terms\n\nIn this case:\n\nP = 30,000 cars\n\nr = 0.10\n\nn = 3 years\n\nSo,\n\nS = 30,000 * ( (1 + 0.10)^3 - 1 ) / 0.10\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.10)^3 = (1.10)^3 = 1.331\n\nThen, S = 30,000 * (1.331 - 1) / 0.10 = 30,000 * (0.331) / 0.10 = 30,000 * 3.31 = 99,300 cars\n\nThat matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the total production over 3 years is 99,300 cars.\n\nBut let me double-check the daily production increase.\n\nWait, in my initial approach, I increased the daily production by 10% each year, but perhaps the production increase is on the annual total, not on the daily rate.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nIf the annual production increases by 10% each year, then:\n\nYear 1: 30,000 cars\n\nYear 2: 30,000 * 1.10 = 33,000 cars\n\nYear 3: 33,000 * 1.10 = 36,300 cars\n\nTotal: 30,000 + 33,000 + 36,300 = 99,300 cars\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, if the daily production increases by 10% each year, while operating days remain the same, then:\n\nYear 1: 120 cars/day * 250 days = 30,000 cars\n\nYear 2: 120 * 1.10 = 132 cars/day * 250 days = 33,000 cars\n\nYear 3: 132 * 1.10 = 145.2 cars/day * 250 days = 36,300 cars\n\nTotal: 30,000 + 33,000 + 36,300 = 99,300 cars\n\nAgain, the same total.\n\nI think the answer is 99,300 cars over 3 years.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if the production increase is compounded annually based on the daily production rate.\n\nIf the daily production increases by 10% each year, then yes, the above calculation holds.\n\nAlternatively, if the annual production increases by 10% each year, without specifying daily production, it still amounts to the same total.\n\nSo, regardless of how I look at it, the total production over 3 years is 99,300 cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{99300} \\]"
