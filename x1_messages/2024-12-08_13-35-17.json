        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a telecom company expanding its broadband network to rural areas. They need to install 3,000 miles of fiber-optic cable to connect 500 towns, each with an average population of 2,000 residents. The cost to lay the cable is $100,000 per mile, and they plan to offer broadband services at $50 per household per month. They're expecting a 25% market penetration rate and a 60% gross profit margin on revenues. I need to estimate the total investment required for this project and calculate the payback period.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total investment required. That should just be the cost of laying the cable. So, 3,000 miles at $100,000 per mile.\n\nTotal investment = 3,000 miles * $100,000/mile = $300,000,000.\n\nOkay, so that's the upfront cost. Now, I need to calculate the payback period. For that, I need to know how much revenue the company will generate per month and then see how long it will take to recover the $300 million investment.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many households there are in total. There are 500 towns, each with 2,000 residents. So, total residents = 500 towns * 2,000 residents/town = 1,000,000 residents.\n\nAssuming that each household has, say, 2.5 residents on average, the number of households would be:\n\nNumber of households = 1,000,000 residents / 2.5 residents/household = 400,000 households.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"per household,\" but it doesn't specify the average number of residents per household. Maybe I should assume that the 2,000 residents per town represent the number of potential customers or households. Let's check that.\n\nIf each town has 2,000 residents and they're offering broadband services to households, perhaps each household has one connection. Maybe it's safe to assume that the 2,000 residents per town correspond to 2,000 potential broadband subscribers, meaning one subscription per resident. But that seems high. Maybe it's households.\n\nPerhaps I should look back at the problem. It says \"average population of 2,000 residents each.\" It doesn't specify how many households that corresponds to. Maybe I need to make an assumption here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company is offering the service to households, and the population figure is just provided for context. Perhaps the number of potential customers is equal to the number of households, and I need to estimate the number of households based on population.\n\nLet me look up an average household size in rural areas in India, since the company is Indian. According to recent data, the average household size in India is about 4.7 people per household. So, for 2,000 residents per town, the number of households would be:\n\nNumber of households per town = 2,000 residents / 4.7 residents/household \u2248 425.5 households.\n\nBut since we can't have a fraction of a household, I'll round it to 426 households per town.\n\nTotal number of households in 500 towns = 500 towns * 426 households/town = 213,000 households.\n\nNow, the company expects a 25% market penetration rate. So, the number of subscribing households would be:\n\nSubscribing households = 213,000 households * 25% = 53,250 households.\n\nMonthly revenue from subscriptions would be:\n\nMonthly revenue = 53,250 households * $50/household/month = $2,662,500/month.\n\nNow, the company has a 60% gross profit margin on revenues. That means that 60% of the revenue is profit, and 40% is cost. But actually, gross profit margin is typically calculated as (revenue - cost of goods sold)/revenue. A 60% gross profit margin means that costs are 40% of revenue.\n\nBut in this context, I think it's safer to assume that the gross profit is 60% of revenue, meaning that the cost of providing the service is 40% of revenue.\n\nWait, actually, gross profit margin is defined as (gross profit)/revenue, so a 60% gross profit margin means that gross profit is 60% of revenue, and costs are 40% of revenue.\n\nBut for the payback period, I think I need to consider the net cash flow per month, which would be the revenue minus the costs associated with providing the service.\n\nBut the problem mentions a gross profit margin, which is revenue minus cost of goods sold (COGS). So, if the gross profit margin is 60%, that means COGS is 40% of revenue.\n\nBut in this scenario, the main cost is the initial investment in laying the cable. The monthly costs associated with providing the service might be relatively low, such as operational costs, maintenance, etc.\n\nHowever, to keep it simple, perhaps the 60% gross profit margin accounts for all variable costs associated with providing the service, and the initial investment is the only upfront cost.\n\nIn that case, the monthly profit would be 60% of the monthly revenue.\n\nMonthly profit = $2,662,500/month * 60% = $1,597,500/month.\n\nNow, to find the payback period, I need to divide the total investment by the monthly profit.\n\nPayback period (in months) = $300,000,000 / $1,597,500/month \u2248 187.7 months.\n\nThat seems like a very long time. Let me check my calculations.\n\nFirst, total investment: 3,000 miles * $100,000/mile = $300,000,000. That seems correct.\n\nNumber of households: 500 towns * (2,000 residents/town / 4.7 residents/household) \u2248 500 * 425.5 \u2248 212,750 households. I had 213,000 earlier, which is close enough.\n\nSubscribing households: 212,750 * 25% = 53,187.5 \u2248 53,188 households.\n\nMonthly revenue: 53,188 households * $50/household/month = $2,659,400/month.\n\nGross profit: $2,659,400 * 60% = $1,595,640/month.\n\nPayback period: $300,000,000 / $1,595,640/month \u2248 188 months.\n\nConverting that to years: 188 months / 12 months/year \u2248 15.67 years.\n\nThat seems like a very long payback period. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me double-check the household calculation. If each town has 2,000 residents and the average household size is 4.7, then households per town = 2,000 / 4.7 \u2248 425.53 households.\n\nTotal households in 500 towns: 500 * 425.53 \u2248 212,765 households.\n\nMarket penetration rate is 25%, so subscribing households = 212,765 * 0.25 \u2248 53,191 households.\n\nMonthly revenue: 53,191 * $50 = $2,659,550.\n\nGross profit: $2,659,550 * 0.60 \u2248 $1,595,730.\n\nPayback period: $300,000,000 / $1,595,730/month \u2248 188.03 months, or about 15.67 years.\n\nHmm, that seems excessively long. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nPerhaps the gross profit margin isn't 60% of revenue, but rather that the costs are 40% of revenue. Wait, that's essentially the same thing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 60% gross profit margin is after covering all expenses, including the initial investment. But that doesn't make sense, because the initial investment is a one-time cost, while the gross profit margin applies to ongoing revenues and costs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 60% gross profit margin is on the service revenues, meaning that for each dollar of revenue, $0.60 is profit, and $0.40 covers the variable costs.\n\nIn that case, the monthly profit would indeed be 60% of the monthly revenue, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 60% gross profit margin includes both variable and fixed costs. But in standard financial terms, gross profit margin typically refers to revenue minus cost of goods sold, which are the direct costs associated with providing the service.\n\nIn this case, the cost of goods sold would include the monthly operational costs of providing the broadband service, such as maintenance of the network, customer support, etc., but not the initial investment in laying the cable.\n\nTherefore, the initial investment is a sunk cost, and the payback period would be based on the monthly cash flows after covering the variable costs.\n\nGiven that, my earlier calculation seems correct.\n\nHowever, a payback period of over 15 years seems unrealistic for such a project. Maybe there are other factors to consider.\n\nPerhaps the company can get subsidies or other forms of financial assistance for expanding broadband to rural areas. Many governments offer incentives for such projects to promote digital inclusion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company can monetize the network in other ways, such as selling advertising or offering additional services.\n\nFurthermore, the population and subscription rates might grow over time, increasing revenue.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, I have to work with the given data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the average household size. Let me check the source of that data.\n\nAccording to the Census of India 2011, the average household size was approximately 4.3 persons per household. However, this might have changed in recent years. Using 4.7 might be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company considers each residence as a potential household, regardless of the number of residents.\n\nIf each town has 2,000 residents, and assuming one household per residence, then the number of households would be equal to the number of residences.\n\nBut the problem states \"average population of 2,000 residents each.\" It doesn't specify the number of households.\n\nPerhaps I should assume that each household has one broadband connection, and the number of households is equal to the number of residences.\n\nIn that case, the number of households per town would be equal to the number of residences, which is equal to the population divided by the average number of residents per household.\n\nBut if I assume one household per residence, then the number of households would be equal to the number of residences, which is equal to the population divided by the average household size.\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company considers each resident as a potential subscriber, but that seems unlikely, as typically broadband is sold per household.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company offers the service per resident, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nGiven that, I think my earlier assumption is reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2,000 residents per town correspond to the number of potential subscribers, meaning households.\n\nIn that case, if each town has 2,000 potential subscribers, and each subscriber is a household, then total households would be 500 towns * 2,000 households/town = 1,000,000 households.\n\nBut that seems high, considering that the average household size is around 4.7, which would imply a total population of 1,000,000 households * 4.7 residents/household = 4,700,000 residents.\n\nBut the problem states that each town has an average population of 2,000 residents, so for 500 towns, total residents would be 500 * 2,000 = 1,000,000 residents.\n\nSo, if there are 1,000,000 residents and an average household size of 4.7, then the number of households should be approximately 1,000,000 / 4.7 \u2248 212,766 households.\n\nThat's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, my earlier calculation seems correct.\n\nGiven that, the payback period is approximately 15.67 years, which seems long but perhaps acceptable for a long-term infrastructure project.\n\nAlternatively, the company might finance the investment through debt or equity, and the payback period would need to factor in the cost of capital.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, I think the payback period is approximately 15.7 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{15.7 \\text{ years}}"
