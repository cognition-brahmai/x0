Each plan will correspond to an evidence value, derived from the output of a function given an input string that could be the user's question, prior evidence values, or a combination thereof.\n\nAvailable tools:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: A tool allowing users to search for information via the DuckDuckGo search engine. Useful for locating potential sources that might hold answers to the user's question.\nSiteLoader[input]: Loads one or more websites from an input string comprising newline-separated links. Input is one or more links; output is plain text containing link contents.\nHyperlinkExtractor[input]: Pulls out hyperlinks from plain text, returning a plain-text, newline-separated list of links.\nInfoModel[input]: A question-answering language model adept at providing answers based on an input text passage. The input needs to be a textual question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [Initial action based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Subsequent action based on :evidence0:'s outcome]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to call and its input parameter, potentially referring back to earlier evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: - contains the final answer]\n\nQuestion: Who was the first person to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen and what was their motivation?"
