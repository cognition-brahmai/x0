A Colorado community in shock after a teenager known as a good student, an athlete, and a friend, opens fire at his school. Police hope to find out why he did that during key searches that are expected today. As you saw, a brutal blast from Kansas to Maine, heavy snow and sleet that\\'s hitting tens of millions of people today. We\\'ll tell you how bad it is going to get and who is going to get hit the hardest. And if you didn\\'t know this already, there is now more mega in the mega millions jackpot. No winner last night, that means that the prize will now soar to new heights. Find out that mind-blowing number and your chances of being a big winner. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us, I\\'m Martin Savidge. ANA CABRERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And I\\'m Ana Cabrera. We start today here in Centennial, Colorado. This town is trying to recover after a terrifying school shooting at Arapahoe High School, just behind me. You can see it is still a crime scene this morning -- a lot of the yellow tape still surrounding the school, cars still in the parking lot left here overnight as investigators search for clues. Now this morning right now, a 15-year-old girl is still in critical condition, shot here at Arapahoe High School by a classmate. The 18- year-old gunman is dead after apparently shooting himself. We\\'ve learned more about him. He\\'s been identified as Karl Pierson. Police say he walked into the school with a shotgun yesterday afternoon. Now, today, investigators are still searching this school. They\\'re also expected to search his home, his car and another home he apparently had access to, to try to figure out what have motivated his attack. We have learned Pierson was on the debate team here at the school. Now witnesses tell me he was looking for the debate coach yesterday afternoon. The sheriff says they believe there was a disagreement between Pierson and the debate coach, and that that might have been the motive for this shooting, that it was an act of revenge. But again, they\\'re still working to confirm those details. The debate coach was notified, we\\'re told, quickly rushed out of the school, hoping to draw the shooter out with him. But instead, the gunman opened fire, hitting a 15-year-old girl. Witnesses tell our affiliates that she screamed for help. She said there was a shooter. We just checked in with the hospital this morning, they can only say she is still in critical condition. We do know she underwent surgery yesterday -- a lot of thoughts and prayers with her and her family. Initially, officials thought there might have been another student shot, as well. Well, it turns out that second student just happened to be right next to the first victim. And that student was covered in blood from the 15-year-old girl but was not shot. So, just a glimpse of good news in all of this; obviously, though, a very terrifying situation for all of the students here. Here\\'s how one student described moments right after the shooting. JOHN SPIGEL, ARAPAHOE HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR: We heard, you know, just a really big bang. Our class really thought nothing of it, you know? It was just one. And 10 seconds later, three more, just consecutively in a row. There was screaming. We heard someone yelling \"Help me, help me, we need help.\" And after that, the entire building just went silent. Our class ran into the corner, we hid in the corner of the room. It was all we could do. We\\'re all scared now. CABRERA: These scenes bringing back chilling memories of Columbine students walking out with their hands up. Arapahoe High School is less than 10 miles away from Columbine and when police rushed in to Arapahoe High School yesterday, they tell us they also saw smoke, which now we know came from a Molotov cocktail of sorts. It was one of two that was found inside the school. One of those detonated; the other one they were able to recover before it had been detonated. They tell us no damage from those. Now, as investigators, again, continue to dig for clues here in Colorado, of course, hearts are also heavy, not just for the community here. This terrible shooting came just one day before the one-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, which is today. Poppy Harlow is following that story from New York this morning, or I guess afternoon there. Poppy, the President honoring those victims today, right? POPPY HARLOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. Good morning to you, Ana. Just shocking that there was another school shooting where you are, a day before the community and Newtown and the entire world grieves for the people of Newtown on this very, very difficult day. I want to show you some pictures of the President and the First Lady this morning lighting 26 candles for the 26 victims that were shot and killed at Sandy Hook Elementary there in Newtown one year ago today. They did it just about the time that that shooting happened a year ago. They also took a moment of silence, as we did, to remember the victims. The community has asked for privacy from the media, not to be there today, so they can heal on their own in their own way, and that is exactly what we are doing. Something stood out to me this week, Ana. A pastor from Newtown, Matt Krebin spoke and he said, \"Of course, our community is broken\", but he also said \"There is light that is shining through the cracks of this broken community from the acts of kindness from friends, from neighbors and from families.\" And that speaks to just how incredibly strong this community is. I was there after the tragic shooting and have been there throughout the year and this -- this community never ceases to amaze me. The President also talked about Newtown in his weekly address this morning, calling the families of Newtown, quote, \"impossibly brave\". And I think that sums it up very well. They are impossibly brave people. He also took it as an opportunity, though, to speak towards what he has been fighting for, along with some of these families, which is tougher federal gun legislation. I want you to take a listen to hear some of what the President said. BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We haven\\'t yet done enough to make our communities and our country safer. We have to do more to keep dangerous people from getting their hands on a gun so easily. We have to do more to heal troubled minds. We have to do everything we can to protect our children from harm and make them feel loved and valued and cared for. HARLOW: And this morning, outside of Washington, it is not about the politics of all of this. It is about the people and the families of Newtown, and our hearts are with them today. CABRERA: You mentioned their bravery, but I also think the word that comes to my mind is strength. HARLOW: Yes. CABRERA: Having to go forward and move on after losing loved ones. I know you\\'ve been in touch with victims\\' families from not only Newtown, Connecticut, but also from Aurora, Colorado and the movie theater shooting that we were reporting on just a little over a year ago. What memories, what feelings are they expressing today? HARLOW: Yes, that\\'s exactly right, Ana. Sandy Phillips, she is the mother of Jessica Ghawi I think everyone remembers Jessica; she\\'s the 24-year-old fiery red head who were shot and killed in that movie theater. Well her mom, Sandy Phillips, called me yesterday and said you know this is a very, very difficult time for us, obviously. But I said to her and she called me right after the shooting where you are, and I said, are you surprised another school shooting? And she said, \"I wish I could say yes, but, no, I am not surprised.\" Her life changed so significantly after her daughter died, of course. She gave up her career. She joined the Brady campaign and has been -- been fighting for tougher federal gun laws. That has been how she is coping, and she just told me, she\\'s actually going to a vigil where she lives in San Antonio today, that they\\'re having down there for the Newtown victims and for all victims of gun violence. So this is resonating across the country today, certainly. CABRERA: Some people don\\'t know how to prevent necessarily something like this, or can\\'t make sense of why these things happen. HARLOW: Right. CABRERA: But sometimes it does give comfort of course to try to turn it into a positive in some way if it means helping another family or preventing another attack like this. Poppy Harlow, thank you so much for that. I do want to let you know, we have been in touch with Sheriff Grayson Robinson here in Colorado to get the latest information on this shooting this morning. And he tells us right now their investigation is focusing on where the student\\'s gun came from, what hands it may have passed through, where specifically the student shot himself and, of course, the motive. Again, as we try to make sense of this horrible tragedy and this is just undeniably awful situation -- why? And so, those are details we hope to be able to provide for you as we continue to move through the morning -- Martin. SAVIDGE: Thanks Ana very much, we\\'ll continue to check back with you. Let\\'s talk about the weather, because a huge snowstorm is pushing its way from the Midwest to the east right now. It\\'s bringing heavy snow and freezing rain, and that would also mean misery to millions of people across the region that\\'s going to be affected. Folks in Chicago, well, they already know this all too well today. It is hovering around freezing there, and it\\'s exactly the place where we sent out our Jennifer Gray to share the misery, and she\\'s going to give us a better idea of just how bad the snowstorm is. Hello, Jennifer. JENNIFER GRAY, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Hi, Martin, yes, the snow has been coming down since the wee hours of the morning. We got here about 5:00 this morning. And it was snowing then, and still snowing now. You can see we\\'re in Grant Park, and about three inches have fallen so far, and another inch or two possible before the snow moves out of Chicago -- expected to move out about 3:00 this afternoon. You know, for the month of December, Chicago is supposed to have about three inches and before the snowstorm, they\\'ve already seen four. So we\\'re already ahead of schedule, and temperatures are expected to stay below freezing here in Chicago until at least Thursday. Now, this storm system is pushing across the country. I do want to show you the radar here in Chicago. It is going to be pushing out in the next couple of hours, and then the wider view, we are seeing this stretching anywhere from Chicago all the way to the northeast. So this stretches about 1,000 miles east-west, and it\\'s affecting tens of millions of people. So as we go through the afternoon today into tonight, it will continue snowing in New York and Boston and then by tomorrow, around midday or so, it should be pushing out of Boston and then pushing up into New England. So we\\'re going to see anywhere from five to seven inches of snow around the New York City area, and then around the Boston area they could see at least eight inches. And so, it is going to continue to be a mess as we go through the next 24 to 38 hours. Here in Chicago, though, the crews have been out, they have been plowing the streets, the sidewalks, they\\'ve been putting salt out so people are getting around pretty well, but I\\'m sure those overpasses and bridges can be quite dangerous at the moment with all of the snow we\\'ve gotten this morning -- Martin. SAVIDGE: Yes, but it still looks very, very pretty. Jennifer Gray thanks very much for standing out in the cold for us. We\\'ll be back in touch. Well, if you are feeling a bit chilled, how about this? Because the mega millions fever may be growing in you and just about everybody else across the country. Nobody -- and that is true, nobody had the winning numbers in last night\\'s drawing, which means the jackpot is up to $550 million. Not a record -- yet. The next drawing is Tuesday. How close did you come? Well, take a look. The winning numbers if you haven\\'t checked already -- 19, 24, 26, 27, 70. Mega ball 12. Your chances of winning, by the way, 1 in 259 million -- but eventually, somebody\\'s got to win, right? And you don\\'t have to necessarily win the lottery to afford a gallon of milk, but you could end up paying a lot more for it. It could soon cost about $7 a gallon. That\\'s right -- $7. I\\'ll tell you why. Also, yesterday\\'s shooting in Colorado is giving a lot of people an awful sense of deja vu. If you saw the images, you felt it. Our next guest will weigh in on why these mass shootings keep happening.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 30 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
