        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 6 red balls, 4 blue balls, and 5 green balls. So, total balls in the bag are 6 + 4 + 5, which is 15 balls. I need to find the probability of drawing exactly 2 red balls when I draw 3 balls without replacement.\n\nOkay, first things first, since we're drawing without replacement, the probability changes with each draw. So, I need to consider the probabilities step by step.\n\nLet me think about the total number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 15. That's a combination problem, right? Because the order doesn't matter. So, the total number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 15 is C(15,3), which is 15 choose 3.\n\nSimilarly, I need exactly 2 red balls. There are 6 red balls, so the number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 6 is C(6,2). And since I'm drawing 3 balls in total, and 2 are red, the third ball must be non-red. There are 4 blue and 5 green balls, making a total of 9 non-red balls. So, the number of ways to choose 1 non-red ball out of 9 is C(9,1).\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is C(6,2) times C(9,1). And the total number of possible outcomes is C(15,3). So, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, C(6,2) is (6!)/(2!(6-2)! ) = (6*5)/ (2*1) ) = 15.\n\nThen, C(9,1) is simply 9.\n\nSo, favorable outcomes are 15 * 9 = 135.\n\nNow, C(15,3) is (15!)/(3!(15-3)! ) = (15*14*13)/ (3*2*1) ) = (2730)/(6) = 455.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 135/455.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5.\n\n135 \u00f7 5 = 27\n\n455 \u00f7 5 = 91\n\nSo, 27/91.\n\nI think that's as simple as it gets.\n\nAlternatively, I could have thought about this problem in terms of probability steps.\n\nFirst, the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw is 6/15.\n\nThen, given that the first ball was red, the probability of drawing another red ball is 5/14.\n\nThen, the probability of drawing a non-red ball is 9/13.\n\nBut since the order can vary\u2014red, red, non-red; red, non-red, red; non-red, red, red\u2014 I need to account for all these sequences.\n\nSo, the probability for each sequence is:\n\nFor red, red, non-red: (6/15) * (5/14) * (9/13)\n\nFor red, non-red, red: (6/15) * (9/14) * (5/13)\n\nFor non-red, red, red: (9/15) * (6/14) * (5/13)\n\nLet's calculate each of these.\n\nFirst sequence: (6/15) * (5/14) * (9/13) = (6*5*9)/(15*14*13) = 270 / 2730 = 27/273 = 9/91\n\nSecond sequence: (6/15) * (9/14) * (5/13) = (6*9*5)/(15*14*13) = 270 / 2730 = 27/273 = 9/91\n\nThird sequence: (9/15) * (6/14) * (5/13) = (9*6*5)/(15*14*13) = 270 / 2730 = 27/273 = 9/91\n\nSo, each sequence has a probability of 9/91.\n\nSince these are mutually exclusive events, I can add their probabilities together.\n\n9/91 + 9/91 + 9/91 = 27/91\n\nWhich matches the earlier result of 135/455 simplified to 27/91.\n\nSo, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing exactly 2 red balls out of 3 draws without replacement is 27/91.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{27}{91}} \\]"
