She is indeed renowned for creating the \"little black dress,\" which revolutionized women's fashion by popularizing simple, elegant, and versatile attire. Additionally, Chanel No. 5 is one of the world's most famous perfumes, launched in 1921, and it was a groundbreaking achievement in the fragrance industry due to its complex blend of ingredients and its association with luxury and sophistication.\n\nChanel founded her fashion house in 1910, initially focusing on millinery but quickly expanding into clothing and accessories.
