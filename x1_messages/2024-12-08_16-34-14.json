        "content": "So the airport wants to expand its runway capacity to handle more flights. Currently, the runway can manage 20 landings and takeoffs per hour. The plan is to increase this capacity by 50%. The airport operates for 18 hours a day, and it's open 365 days a year. I need to find out how many additional flights the airport can handle daily and annually after the expansion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 50% increase in capacity means. If the current capacity is 20 flights per hour, a 50% increase would add half of that number to the current capacity. So, half of 20 is 10. Therefore, the new capacity would be 20 + 10 = 30 flights per hour.\n\nWait, but I should probably calculate it using multiplication for accuracy. To increase by 50%, you can multiply the current capacity by 1.5. So, 20 flights per hour times 1.5 equals 30 flights per hour. Yes, that matches my earlier addition.\n\nNow, to find the additional number of flights per day, I need to calculate the difference between the new capacity and the current capacity, and then multiply that by the number of operating hours in a day.\n\nThe current capacity is 20 flights per hour, and the new capacity is 30 flights per hour. So, the additional capacity per hour is 30 - 20 = 10 flights per hour.\n\nThe airport operates for 18 hours a day, so the additional daily flights would be 10 flights per hour times 18 hours, which equals 180 flights per day.\n\nNext, to find the annual increase in flight capacity, I need to multiply the additional daily flights by the number of operating days in a year. The airport operates 365 days a year, so 180 flights per day times 365 days equals:\n\n180 * 365 = let's see, 180 times 300 is 54,000, and 180 times 65 is 11,700. Adding those together, 54,000 + 11,700 equals 65,700 additional flights per year.\n\nWait a minute, does the airport really operate 365 days a year without any downtime for maintenance or other reasons? That seems unlikely, but since the problem states that it operates 365 days a year, I'll proceed with that figure.\n\nSo, in summary, after the expansion, the airport can handle an additional 180 flights per day and an additional 65,700 flights per year.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, the increase in capacity per hour: 20 flights per hour increased by 50% is indeed 30 flights per hour.\n\nAdditional flights per hour: 30 - 20 = 10 flights per hour.\n\nDaily additional flights: 10 flights per hour * 18 hours per day = 180 flights per day.\n\nAnnual additional flights: 180 flights per day * 365 days per year = 65,700 flights per year.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total flights before and after the expansion and then find the difference.\n\nCurrent daily flights: 20 flights per hour * 18 hours = 360 flights per day.\n\nExpanded daily flights: 30 flights per hour * 18 hours = 540 flights per day.\n\nDifference: 540 - 360 = 180 additional flights per day.\n\nCurrent annual flights: 360 flights per day * 365 days = 131,400 flights per year.\n\nExpanded annual flights: 540 flights per day * 365 days = 197,100 flights per year.\n\nDifference: 197,100 - 131,400 = 65,700 additional flights per year.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident about the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180 \\text{ additional flights per day and } 65,700 \\text{ additional flights per year}} \\]"
