        "content": "So there are 12 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes there will be in total. Hmm, this seems like a problem about combinations, where order doesn't matter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. Each handshake is between two people, and it doesn't matter who initiates the handshake; it's the same handshake either way. So, it's not like a situation where order matters, like arranging people in a line.\n\nI recall that in combinatorics, the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items without regard to the order is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, n is 12 (the number of people), and k is 2 (since a handshake is between two people).\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12!}{2!(12 - 2)!} = \\frac{12!}{2! \\cdot 10!}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the 10! in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 10!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{132}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nSo, there should be 66 handshakes in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. So, the first person shakes hands with 11 other people. The second person has already shaken hands with the first person, so they shake hands with 10 remaining people. The third person has already shaken hands with the first two, so they shake hands with 9 remaining people, and so on.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be:\n\n11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit off. If there are 12 people, the first person shakes hands with 11 others, the second with 10, and so on, down to the last person, who has already shaken hands with everyone else, so they shake hands with 0 new people.\n\nSo, the sum would be:\n\n11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0\n\nLet's add these up:\n\n11 + 10 = 21\n\n21 + 9 = 30\n\n30 + 8 = 38\n\n38 + 7 = 45\n\n45 + 6 = 51\n\n51 + 5 = 56\n\n56 + 4 = 60\n\n60 + 3 = 63\n\n63 + 2 = 65\n\n65 + 1 = 66\n\n66 + 0 = 66\n\nSo, again, I get 66 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, I know that the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nBut in this case, I'm summing from 11 down to 0, which is the same as summing the first 11 natural numbers.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{11 \\times 12}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nAgain, 66 handshakes.\n\nWait, but I recall that in some handshake problems, we might divide by 2 to avoid double-counting. For example, if we consider each pair of people, we don't want to count the handshake twice.\n\nBut in the combination formula, that's already taken care of because combinations don't consider order.\n\nIn the second method, where I added up the handshakes per person, I might be double-counting because when person A shakes hands with person B, it's the same as person B shaking hands with person A.\n\nBut in that sum, I'm only counting each handshake once because each handshake is counted from one person's perspective.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that each handshake involves two people. So, if I count the total number of handshakes from each person's perspective and then divide by 2 to correct for double-counting, that might be necessary.\n\nSo, if each of the 12 people shakes hands with 11 others, the total number of handshakes counted this way is 12 \u00d7 11 = 132. But since each handshake is counted twice (once for each participant), the actual number of unique handshakes is 132 / 2 = 66.\n\nThat matches my previous calculations.\n\nLet me try another approach to confirm. Maybe I can think about it recursively or look for a pattern with smaller numbers.\n\nSuppose there are 2 people: A and B. They shake hands once. So, handshakes = 1.\n\nWith 3 people: A, B, C. Handshakes: A-B, A-C, B-C. That's 3 handshakes.\n\nWith 4 people: A, B, C, D. Handshakes: A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, C-D. That's 6 handshakes.\n\nI can see a pattern here:\n\n- 2 people: 1 handshake\n\n- 3 people: 3 handshakes\n\n- 4 people: 6 handshakes\n\nThese are triangular numbers. The nth triangular number is given by n(n+1)/2.\n\nWait, but in this case, for n people, the number of handshakes is C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2.\n\nYes, that matches the combination formula.\n\nSo, for n = 12:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nAgain, 66 handshakes.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to think about it. Suppose I have 12 people sitting around a round table, and each person shakes hands with every other person. How many unique handshakes are there?\n\nWell, it's still the same as before; the arrangement doesn't change the number of unique pairs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it graph-theoretically, where each person is a vertex, and each handshake is an edge connecting two vertices. Then, the total number of handshakes is equal to the number of edges in a complete graph with 12 vertices.\n\nIn graph theory, a complete graph with n vertices has C(n, 2) edges.\n\nAgain, that's \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}.\n\nFor n = 12:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nConsistently getting 66 handshakes.\n\nIs there any possibility that the answer could be different? For example, if some handshakes are forbidden or if some people don't shake hands with each other, but in this problem, it's stated that each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once.\n\nSo, no exceptions; it's a complete graph.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that each handshake is a unique pair of people.\n\nThe number of unique pairs of 12 people is C(12, 2), which is 66.\n\nTherefore, there are 66 handshakes.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's try calculating C(12, 2) again:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12!}{2!(12 - 2)!} = \\frac{12!}{2! \\times 10!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 10!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nSame result.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that there are 66 handshakes in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{66} \\]"
