        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Implementing Dijkstra's algorithm in Go (Golang) involves several steps, including reading graph data, constructing the adjacency matrix, and then applying the algorithm to find the shortest path between two vertices.\n\nFirst, let's understand what Dijkstra's algorithm does. It's a popular algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.\n\nIn this implementation, we'll use an adjacency matrix to represent the graph. An adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph. The elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan for our program:\n\n1. **Input the number of vertices and edges.**\n2. **Input the edges and their weights to construct the adjacency matrix.**\n3. **Input the starting and ending vertices for which we want to find the shortest path.**\n4. **Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting vertex to the ending vertex.**\n5. **Output the shortest path and its total weight.**\n\nLet's dive into the code. We'll need to handle a few things carefully, such as initializing the adjacency matrix, handling infinite distances (for vertices not directly connected), and keeping track of visited vertices to avoid processing them multiple times.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in Go for a graph represented by an adjacency matrix, follow the steps below:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Input Handling:**\n   - Read the number of vertices and edges.\n   - Read the edges and their weights to construct the adjacency matrix.\n   - Specify the start and end vertices for which the shortest path is to be found.\n\n2. **Adjacency Matrix:**\n   - Use a 2D slice to represent the adjacency matrix.\n   - Initialize the matrix with maximum integer values for non-connected vertices and zero for self-connections.\n\n3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**\n   - Maintain a slice to track visited vertices.\n   - Use a slice to keep track of the shortest distances from the start vertex.\n   - Initialize the distance of the start vertex as 0 and all others as maximum integer values.\n   - Iterate through all vertices, selecting the vertex with the smallest distance, marking it as visited, and updating the distances of its adjacent vertices.\n\n4. **Output:**\n   - Print the shortest path distance from the start vertex to the end vertex.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"bufio\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"math\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"strconv\"\n\t\"strings\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\treader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)\n\n\tfmt.Print(\"Enter number of vertices: \")\n\tverticesStr, _ := reader.ReadString('\\n')\n\tverticesStr = strings.TrimSpace(verticesStr)\n\tvertices, _ := strconv.Atoi(verticesStr)\n\n\tfmt.Print(\"Enter number of edges: \")\n\tedgesStr, _ := reader.ReadString('\\n')\n\tedgesStr = strings.TrimSpace(edgesStr)\n\tedges, _ := strconv.Atoi(edgesStr)\n\n\t// Initialize adjacency matrix\n\tadjMatrix := make([][]int, vertices)\n\tfor i := range adjMatrix {\n\t\tadjMatrix[i] = make([]int, vertices)\n\t\tfor j := range adjMatrix[i] {\n\t\t\tadjMatrix[i][j] = math.MaxInt32\n\t\t}\n\t\tadjMatrix[i][i] = 0\n\t}\n\n\t// Read edges and weights\n\tfor i := 0; i < edges; i++ {\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"Enter edge %d (source destination weight): \", i+1)\n\t\tedgeStr, _ := reader.ReadString('\\n')\n\t\tedgeParts := strings.Fields(edgeStr)\n\t\tsrc, _ := strconv.Atoi(edgeParts[0])\n\t\tdst, _ := strconv.Atoi(edgeParts[1])\n\t\tweight, _ := strconv.Atoi(edgeParts[2])\n\t\tadjMatrix[src][dst] = weight\n\t\tadjMatrix[dst][src] = weight // For undirected graph\n\t}\n\n\tfmt.Print(\"Enter start vertex: \")\n\tstartStr, _ := reader.ReadString('\\n')\n\tstartStr = strings.TrimSpace(startStr)\n\tstart, _ := strconv.Atoi(startStr)\n\n\tfmt.Print(\"Enter end vertex: \")\n\tendStr, _ := reader.ReadString('\\n')\n\tendStr = strings.TrimSpace(endStr)\n\tend, _ := strconv.Atoi(endStr)\n\n\t// Dijkstra's algorithm\n\tdist := make([]int, vertices)\n\tvisited := make([]bool, vertices)\n\n\tfor i := range dist {\n\t\tdist[i] = math.MaxInt32\n\t}\n\tdist[start] = 0\n\n\tfor _ = 0; _ < vertices; _++ {\n\t\tu := findMinDistance(dist, visited)\n\t\tvisited[u] = true\n\n\t\tfor v := 0; v < vertices; v++ {\n\t\t\tif !visited[v] && adjMatrix[u][v] != math.MaxInt32 &&\n\t\t\t\tdist[u]+adjMatrix[u][v] < dist[v] {\n\t\t\t\tdist[v] = dist[u] + adjMatrix[u][v]\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Shortest distance from vertex %d to vertex %d is %d\\n\", start, end, dist[end])\n}\n\nfunc findMinDistance(dist []int, visited []bool) int {\n\tmin := math.MaxInt32\n\tminIndex := -1\n\n\tfor v := 0; v < len(dist); v++ {\n\t\tif !visited[v] && dist[v] <= min {\n\t\t\tmin = dist[v]\n\t\t\tminIndex = v\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn minIndex\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Input Handling:**\n   - The number of vertices and edges are read first.\n   - The adjacency matrix is initialized with maximum integer values for non-connected vertices and zero for self-connections.\n   - Edges and their weights are read and stored in the adjacency matrix.\n\n2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**\n   - `dist` slice keeps track of the shortest distances from the start vertex to all other vertices.\n   - `visited` slice tracks which vertices have been processed.\n   - The algorithm repeatedly selects the vertex with the minimum distance, marks it as visited, and updates the distances of its adjacent vertices.\n\n3. **Output:**\n   - The shortest path distance from the start vertex to the end vertex is printed.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the graph is treated as undirected by setting weights for both directions in the adjacency matrix. For directed graphs, remove the line that sets `adjMatrix[dst][src] = weight`."
