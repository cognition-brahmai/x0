        "content": "So, we've got this problem here about probabilities. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it. There's a box with balls of different colors: 10 red, 20 blue, and 30 green. So, in total, there are 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 balls in the box. Got it.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the probability that a ball drawn at random is either red or blue. Okay, probability. I remember that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls, which is 60. That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how many favorable outcomes there are. Favorable outcomes here mean drawing either a red or a blue ball. There are 10 red balls and 20 blue balls. So, the total number of favorable outcomes should be 10 (red) plus 20 (blue), which is 30.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check. There are 10 red and 20 blue, so together that\u2019s 30 balls that are either red or blue. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 30 divided by 60. That simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.\n\nBut let me think about this another way to make sure I\u2019m not missing anything. Probability of drawing a red ball is 10/60, and the probability of drawing a blue ball is 20/60. So, the total probability of drawing either red or blue should be 10/60 plus 20/60, which is 30/60, again simplifying to 1/2 or 0.5.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, that makes sense.\n\nIs there another way to look at this to confirm? Maybe by considering the probability of not drawing a green ball, since the only other options are red or blue.\n\nThere are 30 green balls out of 60, so the probability of drawing a green ball is 30/60, which is also 1/2 or 0.5. So, the probability of not drawing a green ball (i.e., drawing either red or blue) should be 1 minus the probability of drawing green, which is 1 - 0.5 = 0.5. Again, the same result.\n\nOkay, so all these different approaches are leading me to the same answer: 0.5 or 50%.\n\nLet me just make sure there aren\u2019t any tricky aspects here that I\u2019m overlooking. The problem says \u201ca ball is drawn at random,\u201d so we can assume that each ball has an equal chance of being drawn. There\u2019s no mention of any bias towards certain colors or anything like that, so our basic probability approach should hold.\n\nAlso, just to be thorough, let\u2019s check the total number of balls: 10 red + 20 blue + 30 green = 60 balls. Yes, that\u2019s correct.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability of drawing either a red or a blue ball is 30 out of 60, which is 0.5 or 50%.\n\nI think that\u2019s the answer. It seems straightforward once you break it down like this.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.5} \\]"
