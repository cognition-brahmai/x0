        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here: the ratio of cars to motorcycles is 3:2, and there are 18,000 vehicles in the city. I need to find out how many motorcycles there are.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio of 3:2 for cars to motorcycles means that for every 3 cars, there are 2 motorcycles. So, the total number of parts in the ratio is 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nNow, if there are 18,000 vehicles in total, these 18,000 vehicles are divided into 5 parts as per the ratio. So, to find out how many vehicles are in one part, I can divide the total number of vehicles by the total number of parts.\n\nLet me calculate that: 18,000 divided by 5.\n\n18,000 \u00f7 5 = 3,600.\n\nSo, each part represents 3,600 vehicles.\n\nNow, since motorcycles make up 2 parts of the ratio, I can find the number of motorcycles by multiplying the number of parts for motorcycles by the number of vehicles per part.\n\nSo, number of motorcycles = 2 parts \u00d7 3,600 vehicles/part = 7,200 vehicles.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal parts: 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nTotal vehicles: 18,000.\n\nVehicles per part: 18,000 \u00f7 5 = 3,600.\n\nMotorcycles: 2 parts \u00d7 3,600 = 7,200.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of fractions. The ratio 3:2 means that motorcycles are 2 parts out of 5 total parts. So, the fraction of vehicles that are motorcycles is 2/5.\n\nSo, number of motorcycles = (2/5) \u00d7 18,000.\n\nLet me calculate that: 2/5 of 18,000.\n\nFirst, 2/5 \u00d7 18,000 = (2 \u00d7 18,000) \u00f7 5 = 36,000 \u00f7 5 = 7,200.\n\nAgain, I get 7,200 motorcycles.\n\nAlternatively, I could find the number of cars first and then subtract from the total to find motorcycles.\n\nCars: 3 parts \u00d7 3,600 = 10,800.\n\nTotal vehicles: 10,800 cars + motorcycles = 18,000.\n\nSo, motorcycles = 18,000 - 10,800 = 7,200.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nWait, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using algebra.\n\nLet me denote the number of cars as 3x and the number of motorcycles as 2x, where x is a common multiplier.\n\nThen, the total number of vehicles is 3x + 2x = 5x.\n\nGiven that 5x = 18,000, I can solve for x.\n\n5x = 18,000.\n\nx = 18,000 \u00f7 5 = 3,600.\n\nThen, the number of motorcycles is 2x = 2 \u00d7 3,600 = 7,200.\n\nOnce again, I get 7,200 motorcycles.\n\nHmm, it seems consistent across different methods. I think I've got it right.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if the ratio holds.\n\nNumber of cars: 10,800.\n\nNumber of motorcycles: 7,200.\n\nRatio of cars to motorcycles: 10,800 : 7,200.\n\nDivide both numbers by 3,600: 10,800 \u00f7 3,600 = 3, and 7,200 \u00f7 3,600 = 2.\n\nSo, the ratio is indeed 3:2.\n\nAlso, the total number of vehicles: 10,800 + 7,200 = 18,000.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nI think 7,200 is the correct number of motorcycles in the city.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7200} \\]"
