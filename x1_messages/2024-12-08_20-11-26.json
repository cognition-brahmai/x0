        "content": "In genetics, a sequence of DNA that codes for a functional polypeptide or RNA molecule is known as a gene. So, the correct answer is D. A gene.\n\nTo elaborate a bit, let's go through each option to understand why the others aren't the right choice:\n\nA. A codon: A codon is a sequence of three DNA or RNA nucleotides that corresponds to a specific amino acid or stop signal during protein synthesis. While codons are part of the genetic code within genes, they don't represent the entire sequence that codes for a functional product.\n\nB. An allele: Alleles are alternative forms of a gene that can occupy the same location on a chromosome. For example, in humans, the gene for eye color has multiple alleles, each corresponding to different eye colors. Alleles are variations of a gene, not the gene itself.\n\nC. A chromosome: A chromosome is a structure composed of DNA and proteins that carries genetic information. It contains many genes along its length. So, while genes are located on chromosomes, a chromosome is not a single gene.\n\nD. A gene: As mentioned, a gene is a sequence of DNA that codes for a functional polypeptide (protein) or RNA molecule. This is the correct answer.\n\nE. None of the above: This isn't correct because option D is accurate.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the term for a DNA sequence that codes for a functional product is a gene."
