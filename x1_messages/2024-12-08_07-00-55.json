        "content": "Let's see. The car rental company has 150 cars in total. On Monday, 60% of them are rented out. So first, I need to find out how many cars that is.\n\nTo find 60% of 150, I can multiply 150 by 0.60.\n\n150 \u00d7 0.60 = 90 cars\n\nSo, 90 cars are rented out on Monday.\n\nNow, the company wants to reach an 80% rental rate. So, I need to find out what 80% of 150 cars is.\n\n150 \u00d7 0.80 = 120 cars\n\nSo, to reach an 80% rental rate, the company needs to have 120 cars rented out.\n\nCurrently, they have 90 cars rented out. So, to find out how many more cars need to be rented out to reach 120, I can subtract 90 from 120.\n\n120 - 90 = 30 cars\n\nTherefore, the company needs to rent out 30 more cars to reach an 80% rental rate.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Percentages can sometimes be tricky.\n\nSo, 60% of 150 is indeed 90, and 80% of 150 is 120. The difference between them is 30. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of percentage points. The company wants to increase its rental rate from 60% to 80%, which is an increase of 20 percentage points.\n\nTo find out how many cars that corresponds to, I can calculate 20% of 150.\n\n150 \u00d7 0.20 = 30 cars\n\nAgain, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 30 cars.\n\nBut let's consider if there's another way to look at this problem. Maybe using proportions or ratios.\n\nSuppose x is the number of additional cars that need to be rented out to reach 80%.\n\nSo, the total number of rented cars would be 90 + x, and this should be equal to 80% of 150.\n\nTherefore, 90 + x = 120\n\nSolving for x: x = 120 - 90 = 30\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up a proportion.\n\nThe current rented cars are 90 out of 150, and we want to reach 80 out of 100.\n\nSo, 90/150 = 0.6, and we want 0.8.\n\nBut that seems like a longer way, and it's probably unnecessary since I already have the direct calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of the number of cars available to be rented out, the company has 150 cars, and 90 are already rented, so there are 150 - 90 = 60 cars left.\n\nOut of these 60 cars, how many need to be rented to reach 80%?\n\nWell, we've already calculated that 120 cars need to be rented in total, and 90 are already rented, so 30 more need to be rented.\n\nAlternatively, if the company wants to reach 80% rental rate, and there are 60 cars left, they need to rent out 30 of them.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit circular. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose the company has 150 cars, and they want 80% to be rented. That's 120 cars.\n\nCurrently, 90 are rented. So, they need to rent out 30 more cars.\n\nAlternatively, what percentage of the remaining cars need to be rented out to reach 80%?\n\nThe remaining cars are 60, and they need to rent out 30 of them.\n\nSo, 30 out of 60 is 50%.\n\nMeaning, they need to rent out 50% of the remaining cars to reach 80% overall rental rate.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for how many more cars need to be rented out, not the percentage.\n\nSo, the direct answer is 30 cars.\n\nAlternatively, if the company rents out all 60 remaining cars, they would have 150 cars rented, which is 100%, but they only need 80%.\n\nSo, 120 cars in total need to be rented, and since 90 are already rented, 30 more are needed.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the number of cars that correspond to the difference between 80% and 60%, which is 20%.\n\n20% of 150 is 30 cars.\n\nTherefore, the company needs to rent out 30 more cars to reach an 80% rental rate.\n\nI think that's straightforward.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor that might affect this calculation.\n\nFor example, are there any constraints on the number of cars that can be rented out? The problem says there are 150 cars in total, and 90 are already rented, so 60 are left.\n\nAssuming all 60 are rentable, and there are no cars that are unavailable for rental due to maintenance or other reasons.\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any such constraints, so I can assume all remaining cars are available for rent.\n\nTherefore, the calculation stands: 30 more cars need to be rented out to reach 80% rental rate.\n\nAlternatively, if the company cannot rent out all 60 remaining cars for some reason, then the number might be different.\n\nBut based on the information provided, that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nSo, the final answer is 30 cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
