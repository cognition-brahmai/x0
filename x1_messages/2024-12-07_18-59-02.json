        "content": "Alright, I need to find out who was the first person to climb Mount Everest without using any extra oxygen and when that happened. This sounds like a specific achievement in mountaineering history, so I should be able to find this information through some research.\n\nFirst, I'll start by searching the web to get some initial information about this feat. I can use the Bing search tool for this purpose. So, my first step is:\n\nPlan: Search for information about the first person to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen.\n\n:Evidence1: = Bing[\"first person to climb Mount Everest without oxygen\"]\n\nNow, assuming that :Evidence1: gives me a list of links related to my query, I need to go through these links to find the most relevant one that can provide the answer I'm looking for. Probably, Wikipedia or some reputable mountaineering websites would have this information.\n\nSo, my next step is to select one of these links and read the content of the page.\n\nPlan: Choose a relevant link from the search results and extract its content.\n\n:Evidence2: = PageReader[:Evidence1\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6761\u94fe\u63a5]\n\nOnce I have the content of the page, I need to look for the specific information about the first person to climb Everest without supplemental oxygen and the year it happened. This might require me to read through the text and identify the relevant section.\n\nAlternatively, if the page has multiple links to other articles that might be more specific, I could collect those links and explore them further.\n\nPlan: If :Evidence2: contains multiple links, collect them for further exploration.\n\n:Evidence3: = LinkCollector[:Evidence2]\n\nBut perhaps it's more efficient to use the QAModel to directly ask about the first oxygen-less climber of Everest and the year, based on the text from :Evidence2:.\n\nPlan: Use QAModel to extract the answer from the page content.\n\n:Evidence4: = QAModel[\"Who was the first person to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen and when did this happen?\", :Evidence2]\n\nIf :Evidence4: provides a clear answer, then I can conclude my search. However, if the answer is unclear or incomplete, I might need to look at other pages or links collected in :Evidence3:.\n\nAlternatively, if the initial search didn't yield useful results, I might need to refine my search query and try again.\n\nPlan: If :Evidence4: is unclear, refine the search query and repeat the process.\n\n:Evidence5: = Bing[\"first solo climb of Mount Everest without oxygen\"]\n\nThen, proceed similarly by reading the content of the relevant pages and using QAModel to extract the information.\n\nBut let's assume that :Evidence4: gives me a satisfactory answer. For example, it might say that Phu Tsering was the first to do this in 1999 or something like that. Then, I can present this as the answer.\n\nAnswer: :Evidence4:\n\nHowever, to ensure accuracy, it might be a good idea to cross-verify this information with another source. So, I could choose another link from :Evidence1: and repeat the process to confirm the answer.\n\nPlan: Cross-verify the information with another source.\n\n:Evidence6: = PageReader[:Evidence1\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6761\u94fe\u63a5]\n\n:Evidence7: = QAModel[\"Who was the first person to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen and when did this happen?\", :Evidence6]\n\nThen, compare :Evidence4: and :Evidence7: to see if they match. If they do, that increases the confidence in the answer.\n\nAnswer: :Evidence4: (assuming it matches :Evidence7:)\n\nIf they don't match, I might need to look for a third source to resolve any discrepancies.\n\nPlan: If :Evidence4: and :Evidence7: differ, check a third source.\n\n:Evidence8: = PageReader[:Evidence1\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u6761\u94fe\u63a5]\n\n:Evidence9: = QAModel[\"Who was the first person to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen and when did this happen?\", :Evidence8]\n\nThen, decide based on the majority or the most credible source.\n\nAnswer: :Evidence9: (assuming it matches one of the previous evidences)\n\nOverall, the plan is to search for\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9605\u8bfb\u76f8\u5173\u9875\u9762\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528QAModel\u6765\u56de\u7b54\u5177\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u6765\u6e90\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Ed Viesturs was the first American to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen, in 2000. However, the first person to achieve this was Messner and Habeler in 1978.}} \\]"
