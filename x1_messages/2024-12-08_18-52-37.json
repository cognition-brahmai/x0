        "content": "So I need to calculate the double integral of xy over the region bounded by x=0, y=0, and x+y=1. Alright, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the region of integration. The boundaries are the x-axis (y=0), the y-axis (x=0), and the line x+y=1. So, it's a right triangle with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), and (0,1).\n\nNow, for double integrals, I need to set up the limits of integration. I can choose to integrate with respect to x first and then y, or vice versa. Let's pick integrating with respect to x first.\n\nSo, for a fixed y, x goes from x=0 to x=1-y (since x+y=1 implies x=1-y). Then y goes from y=0 to y=1.\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b(from y=0 to y=1) \u222b(from x=0 to x=1-y) xy dx dy\n\nFirst, integrate with respect to x:\n\n\u222b(from y=0 to y=1) [ (x^2 y)/2 ] from x=0 to x=1-y dy\n\nPlugging in the limits:\n\n\u222b(from y=0 to y=1) [ ((1-y)^2 y)/2 - 0 ] dy\n\nSimplify (1-y)^2:\n\n(1 - 2y + y^2) y / 2 = (y - 2y^2 + y^3)/2\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n(1/2) \u222b(from y=0 to y=1) (y - 2y^2 + y^3) dy\n\nNow, integrate term by term:\n\n(1/2) [ (y^2)/2 - (2y^3)/3 + (y^4)/4 ] from y=0 to y=1\n\nPlug in y=1:\n\n(1/2) [ (1/2) - (2/3) + (1/4) ] - (1/2)[0] = (1/2) [ (1/2) - (2/3) + (1/4) ]\n\nNow, find a common denominator for the fractions inside the brackets. The common denominator for 2, 3, and 4 is 12.\n\nSo, (1/2) - (2/3) + (1/4) = (6/12) - (8/12) + (3/12) = (6 - 8 + 3)/12 = (1/12)\n\nThen, (1/2) * (1/12) = 1/24\n\nSo, the double integral evaluates to 1/24.\n\nWait a minute, let me check if I did this correctly. Maybe I should try integrating in the other order, dy dx, to verify.\n\nSo, integrating with respect to y first.\n\nFor a fixed x, y goes from y=0 to y=1-x, and x goes from x=0 to x=1.\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b(from x=0 to x=1) \u222b(from y=0 to y=1-x) xy dy dx\n\nFirst, integrate with respect to y:\n\n\u222b(from x=0 to x=1) [ (x y^2)/2 ] from y=0 to y=1-x dx\n\nPlugging in the limits:\n\n\u222b(from x=0 to x=1) [ (x (1-x)^2)/2 - 0 ] dx = (1/2) \u222b(from x=0 to x=1) x (1 - 2x + x^2) dx\n\nExpand the integrand:\n\n(1/2) \u222b(from x=0 to x=1) (x - 2x^2 + x^3) dx\n\nIntegrate term by term:\n\n(1/2) [ (x^2)/2 - (2x^3)/3 + (x^4)/4 ] from x=0 to x=1\n\nPlug in x=1:\n\n(1/2) [ (1/2) - (2/3) + (1/4) ] - (1/2)[0] = (1/2) [ (1/2) - (2/3) + (1/4) ]\n\nAgain, same expression as before, which simplifies to 1/24.\n\nSo, regardless of the order of integration, I get the same result, which gives me confidence that 1/24 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could use iterated integrals to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a change of variables or exploit symmetry, but in this case, since the region is a triangle and the integrand is xy, which is already pretty simple, I think double integration is the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the integral of xy over this region is the same as the expected value of xy for points uniformly distributed in the triangle, but that might be overcomplicating things.\n\nSo, sticking with the double integral approach, I'm confident that 1/24 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{24}} \\]"
