        "content": "So I've got this system of linear equations to solve:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 5 \\)\n\n2. \\( 2x - y = 1 \\)\n\nI need to find the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that satisfy both equations at the same time. There are a few methods to solve systems like this, such as substitution, elimination, or even graphing. I think I'll use the elimination method because it seems straightforward for this pair of equations.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 5 \\)\n\n2. \\( 2x - y = 1 \\)\n\nI notice that in the first equation, \\( y \\) is positive, and in the second equation, \\( y \\) is negative. This is great because if I add the two equations together, the \\( y \\) terms should cancel each other out, leaving me with only \\( x \\) to solve for.\n\nSo, let's add the equations:\n\n\\( (x + y) + (2x - y) = 5 + 1 \\)\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n\\( x + y + 2x - y = 3x + 0y = 3x \\)\n\nAnd the right side:\n\n\\( 5 + 1 = 6 \\)\n\nSo, now I have:\n\n\\( 3x = 6 \\)\n\nTo find \\( x \\), I'll divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\)\n\nGreat, so \\( x = 2 \\). Now, I need to find \\( y \\). Since I have the value of \\( x \\), I can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for \\( y \\). I'll choose the first equation because it looks simpler:\n\n\\( x + y = 5 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 2 \\):\n\n\\( 2 + y = 5 \\)\n\nNow, subtract 2 from both sides:\n\n\\( y = 5 - 2 = 3 \\)\n\nSo, \\( y = 3 \\).\n\nTo make sure my solution is correct, I should check it in both original equations.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n\\( x + y = 2 + 3 = 5 \\), which matches the first equation.\n\nSecond equation:\n\n\\( 2x - y = 2(2) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1 \\), which matches the second equation.\n\nPerfect, it all checks out. So, the solution to the system is \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( y = 3 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{(2, 3)} \\]"
