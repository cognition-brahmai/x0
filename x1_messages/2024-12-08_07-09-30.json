        "content": "So I've got this sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, and it says each number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones. That sounds a lot like the Fibonacci sequence, which I've heard about before. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, but in this case, it starts with 1 and 1. So, I need to find the tenth number in this sequence.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the sequence step by step until I reach the tenth number.\n\nStarting with:\n\n1. 1\n\n2. 1\n\n3. 2 (1 + 1)\n\n4. 3 (1 + 2)\n\n5. 5 (2 + 3)\n\nNow, to find the sixth number:\n\n6. 5 + 3 = 8\n\nSeventh:\n\n7. 3 + 8 = 11\n\nWait, hold on. If I look back, the fifth number is 5, and the sixth is 8, so the seventh should be 5 + 8 = 13, not 3 + 8. Did I make a mistake there?\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nSo, fifth is 5, sixth is 8, then seventh is 5 + 8 = 13.\n\nEighth is 8 + 13 = 21.\n\nNinth is 13 + 21 = 34.\n\nTenth is 21 + 34 = 55.\n\nSo, according to this, the tenth number is 55.\n\nBut wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't mess up the additions.\n\nStarting over:\n\n1. 1\n\n2. 1\n\n3. 1 + 1 = 2\n\n4. 1 + 2 = 3\n\n5. 2 + 3 = 5\n\n6. 3 + 5 = 8\n\n7. 5 + 8 = 13\n\n8. 8 + 13 = 21\n\n9. 13 + 21 = 34\n\n10. 21 + 34 = 55\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the Fibonacci sequence to find the nth term. The general formula for the nth Fibonacci number is:\n\nF(n) = [ (\u03c6^n) - ((1-\u03c6)^n) ] / \u221a5\n\nWhere \u03c6 is the golden ratio, approximately 1.618033988749895.\n\nBut in this sequence, it starts with 1, 1, so it's similar to the Fibonacci sequence but shifted by one place, because the standard Fibonacci sequence starts with 0, 1.\n\nSo, if I want to use the formula, I need to adjust it accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, there's a closed-form expression for the nth term of a sequence where each term is the sum of the previous two. This is known as a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe characteristic equation for this recurrence relation is:\n\nx^2 - x - 1 = 0\n\nSolving this, I get x = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(5)] / 2, which are the golden ratio \u03c6 and its conjugate.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A * \u03c6^n + B * (1 - \u03c6)^n\n\nTo find A and B, I need to use the initial conditions.\n\nGiven:\n\na_1 = 1\n\na_2 = 1\n\nSo,\n\na_1: A * \u03c6 + B * (1 - \u03c6) = 1\n\na_2: A * \u03c6^2 + B * (1 - \u03c6)^2 = 1\n\nThis is a system of equations that I can solve for A and B.\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated for just finding the tenth term. Maybe it's easier to just continue the sequence as I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I can use Binet's formula, which is a closed-form expression for the nth Fibonacci number.\n\nBinet's formula is:\n\nF(n) = [ \u03c6^n - (1 - \u03c6)^n ] / \u221a5\n\nBut again, since our sequence starts with 1, 1, instead of 0, 1, I need to adjust the formula.\n\nActually, in this sequence, a_n = F(n+1), where F is the standard Fibonacci sequence.\n\nSo, to find the tenth term of our sequence, it would be F(11).\n\nUsing Binet's formula:\n\nF(11) = [ \u03c6^11 - (1 - \u03c6)^11 ] / \u221a5\n\nCalculating \u03c6^11 and (1 - \u03c6)^11 might be tedious, but I can compute it.\n\nFirst, \u03c6 = (1 + \u221a5)/2 \u2248 1.618033988749895\n\nAnd 1 - \u03c6 = (1 - \u221a5)/2 \u2248 -0.618033988749895\n\nNow, \u03c6^11 \u2248 191.0344\n\nAnd (1 - \u03c6)^11 \u2248 -0.0344\n\nSo, \u03c6^11 - (1 - \u03c6)^11 \u2248 191.0344 - (-0.0344) = 191.0688\n\nDivide by \u221a5 \u2248 2.2360679775\n\nSo, F(11) \u2248 191.0688 / 2.2360679775 \u2248 85.44\n\nWait, that can't be right because I previously got 55 by just adding the terms.\n\nLet me check my calculations.\n\nActually, \u03c6^11 is approximately 191.0344, and (1 - \u03c6)^11 is approximately -0.0344.\n\nSo, their difference is indeed approximately 191.0688.\n\nDividing by \u221a5 \u2248 2.2360679775 gives approximately 85.44, but that doesn't match the earlier result of 55.\n\nHmm, there must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied Binet's formula. Let me double-check the formula.\n\nBinet's formula is:\n\nF(n) = [ \u03c6^n - (1 - \u03c6)^n ] / \u221a5\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut perhaps I miscalculated \u03c6^11 and (1 - \u03c6)^11.\n\nLet me compute \u03c6^11 more accurately.\n\n\u03c6 = (1 + \u221a5)/2 \u2248 1.618033988749895\n\n\u03c6^2 = \u03c6 + 1\n\n\u03c6^3 = \u03c6^2 + \u03c6 = 2\u03c6 + 1\n\nAnd so on, but this might not help me get an accurate numerical value.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that F(n) is the nearest integer to \u03c6^n / \u221a5.\n\nSo, F(11) should be the nearest integer to \u03c6^11 / \u221a5.\n\nGiven that \u03c6^11 \u2248 191.0344 and \u221a5 \u2248 2.2360679775, then \u03c6^11 / \u221a5 \u2248 85.44.\n\nBut earlier, by adding the terms, I got 55.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in applying Binet's formula.\n\nLet me check the value of F(11).\n\nFrom the standard Fibonacci sequence:\n\nF(1) = 0\n\nF(2) = 1\n\nF(3) = 1\n\nF(4) = 2\n\nF(5) = 3\n\nF(6) = 5\n\nF(7) = 8\n\nF(8) = 13\n\nF(9) = 21\n\nF(10) = 34\n\nF(11) = 55\n\nSo, F(11) is indeed 55, not 85.\n\nWait a minute, that means my earlier calculation using Binet's formula must be wrong.\n\nLet me recalculate \u03c6^11 and (1 - \u03c6)^11 more carefully.\n\nFirst, \u03c6 = (1 + \u221a5)/2 \u2248 1.618033988749895\n\nSo, \u03c6^11 \u2248 191.0344\n\n(1 - \u03c6) = (1 - \u221a5)/2 \u2248 -0.618033988749895\n\nSo, (1 - \u03c6)^11 \u2248 -0.0344\n\nTherefore, \u03c6^11 - (1 - \u03c6)^11 \u2248 191.0344 - (-0.0344) = 191.0688\n\nNow, divide by \u221a5 \u2248 2.2360679775\n\nSo, 191.0688 / 2.2360679775 \u2248 85.44\n\nBut according to the table, F(11) = 55, not 85.\n\nThere's clearly a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying Binet's formula.\n\nLet me look up Binet's formula again.\n\nBinet's formula is:\n\nF(n) = (\u03c6^n - (1 - \u03c6)^n) / \u221a5\n\nBut perhaps the formula is slightly different for this sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to adjust n because our sequence starts with a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, which corresponds to F(2) and F(3) in the standard Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait, in the standard Fibonacci sequence:\n\nF(1) = 0\n\nF(2) = 1\n\nF(3) = 1\n\nF(4) = 2\n\nF(5) = 3\n\nF(6) = 5\n\nF(7) = 8\n\nF(8) = 13\n\nF(9) = 21\n\nF(10) = 34\n\nF(11) = 55\n\nBut in our sequence:\n\na_1 = 1 (which is F(2))\n\na_2 = 1 (which is F(3))\n\na_3 = 2 (which is F(4))\n\na_4 = 3 (which is F(5))\n\na_5 = 5 (which is F(6))\n\nSo, a_n = F(n+1)\n\nTherefore, a_10 = F(11) = 55\n\nSo, that matches the addition method.\n\nBut according to Binet's formula, F(11) should be 55, but my calculation gave approximately 85.\n\nThere must be an error in my calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate \u03c6^11 and (1 - \u03c6)^11.\n\n\u03c6 \u2248 1.618033988749895\n\n\u03c6^11 \u2248 191.0344\n\n(1 - \u03c6) \u2248 -0.618033988749895\n\n(1 - \u03c6)^11 \u2248 -0.0344\n\nSo, \u03c6^11 - (1 - \u03c6)^11 \u2248 191.0344 - (-0.0344) = 191.0688\n\nNow, divide by \u221a5 \u2248 2.2360679775\n\n191.0688 / 2.2360679775 \u2248 85.44\n\nBut F(11) is 55, not 85.\n\nThis doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating \u03c6^11.\n\nLet me compute \u03c6^11 step by step.\n\n\u03c6^1 = \u03c6 \u2248 1.618033988749895\n\n\u03c6^2 = \u03c6 + 1 \u2248 2.618033988749895\n\n\u03c6^3 = \u03c6^2 * \u03c6 \u2248 2.618033988749895 * 1.618033988749895 \u2248 4.2360679775\n\n\u03c6^4 = \u03c6^3 * \u03c6 \u2248 4.2360679775 * 1.618033988749895 \u2248 6.8541019662\n\n\u03c6^5 = \u03c6^4 * \u03c6 \u2248 6.8541019662 * 1.618033988749895 \u2248 11.0901699437\n\n\u03c6^6 = \u03c6^5 * \u03c6 \u2248 11.0901699437 * 1.618033988749895 \u2248 17.94427191\n\n\u03c6^7 = \u03c6^6 * \u03c6 \u2248 17.94427191 * 1.618033988749895 \u2248 29.03444185\n\n\u03c6^8 = \u03c6^7 * \u03c6 \u2248 29.03444185 * 1.618033988749895 \u2248 46.97871376\n\n\u03c6^9 = \u03c6^8 * \u03c6 \u2248 46.97871376 * 1.618033988749895 \u2248 75.91315561\n\n\u03c6^10 = \u03c6^9 * \u03c6 \u2248 75.91315561 * 1.618033988749895 \u2248 123.89186937\n\n\u03c6^11 = \u03c6^10 * \u03c6 \u2248 123.89186937 * 1.618033988749895 \u2248 200.80372874\n\nWait, earlier I had \u03c6^11 \u2248 191.0344, but now it's approximately 200.8037.\n\nSimilarly, (1 -
