        "content": "So I've got this equation to solve: 5(x - 3) = 10 + 2x. Alright, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to simplify both sides of the equation as much as possible.\n\nStarting with the left side, I have 5(x - 3). I need to distribute the 5 to both terms inside the parentheses. So, 5 times x is 5x, and 5 times -3 is -15. So, the left side becomes 5x - 15.\n\nNow, the equation looks like this: 5x - 15 = 10 + 2x.\n\nNext, I want to get all the x terms on one side and the constant terms on the other side. Let's move the 2x from the right side to the left side by subtracting 2x from both sides. So, 5x - 2x is 3x, and on the right side, 10 + 2x - 2x is just 10.\n\nNow, the equation is 3x - 15 = 10.\n\nNext, I'll move the -15 from the left side to the right side by adding 15 to both sides. So, 3x - 15 + 15 is 3x, and 10 + 15 is 25.\n\nNow, the equation is 3x = 25.\n\nFinally, to solve for x, I'll divide both sides by 3. So, x = 25/3.\n\nWait a minute, let me check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting equation: 5(x - 3) = 10 + 2x\n\nDistribute 5: 5x - 15 = 10 + 2x\n\nSubtract 2x from both sides: 3x - 15 = 10\n\nAdd 15 to both sides: 3x = 25\n\nDivide by 3: x = 25/3\n\nSeems correct. But let's double-check by plugging the value back into the original equation.\n\nLeft side: 5(x - 3) = 5(25/3 - 3) = 5(25/3 - 9/3) = 5(16/3) = 80/3\n\nRight side: 10 + 2x = 10 + 2*(25/3) = 10 + 50/3 = 30/3 + 50/3 = 80/3\n\nBoth sides equal, so x = 25/3 is indeed the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{3}} \\]"
