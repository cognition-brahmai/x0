First, I need to find out how much trash is generated per day by the entire city, and then multiply that by the number of days in a week to get the weekly total.\n\nSo, starting with the daily trash generation:\n\nNumber of people in NYC: 8,000,000\n\nAverage trash per person per day: 4.5 pounds\n\nTotal daily trash = Number of people \u00d7 Trash per person\n\nTotal daily trash = 8,000,000 \u00d7 4.5\n\nNow, multiplying that out:\n\n8,000,000 \u00d7 4.5 = 36,000,000 pounds per day\n\nOkay, so that's 36 million pounds of trash per day.\n\nNext, to find out the weekly generation, I need to multiply the daily amount by the number of days in a week.\n\nNumber of days in a week: 7\n\nTotal weekly trash = Total daily trash \u00d7 7\n\nTotal weekly trash = 36,000,000 \u00d7 7\n\nCalculating that:\n\n36,000,000 \u00d7 7 = 252,000,000 pounds per week\n\nSo, New York City generates approximately 252 million pounds of trash each week.\n\nWait a minute, does that sound right? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 8,000,000 people times 4.5 pounds per person per day:\n\n8,000,000 \u00d7 4.5 = 36,000,000 pounds per day. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 36,000,000 pounds per day times 7 days per week:\n\n36,000,000 \u00d7 7 = 252,000,000 pounds per week. Yep, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of smaller numbers to see if it makes sense. Suppose there were 100 people, each generating 1 pound per day. Then daily trash would be 100 pounds, and weekly trash would be 700 pounds. Applying the same logic here, with 8 million people and 4.5 pounds per day, the numbers scale up accordingly.\n\nAlso, considering that 8 million is 8\u00d710^6, and 4.5 is 4.5\u00d710^0, their product is 36\u00d710^6 pounds per day, which is 36 million pounds per day. Then, 36\u00d710^6 pounds per day times 7 days gives 252\u00d710^6 pounds per week, which is 252 million pounds per week.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the total trash generation over a week for one person: 4.5 pounds per day times 7 days equals 31.5 pounds per week per person. Then, for 8 million people, it would be 8,000,000 \u00d7 31.5 = 252,000,000 pounds per week. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, yeah, 252 million pounds of trash per week seems accurate.\n\nJust to put that into perspective, that's a massive amount of waste. It highlights the importance of recycling and waste management practices in such a densely populated city.\n\nAlternatively, if we wanted to consider the average per household instead of per person, we'd need additional data, like the average number of people per household in NYC. But since the question is given in terms of per person, I'll stick with that.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that this is a rough estimate based on averages. In reality, trash generation can vary based on different factors like time of year, events, and individual habits.\n\nBut based on the information provided, 252,000,000 pounds per week is the calculated amount of trash generated by New York City.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{252000000} \\]"
