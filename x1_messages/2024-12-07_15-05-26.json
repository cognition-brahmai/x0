        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is:\n\n((7 - 2)^2 * 4 + 12) / 6\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n(7 - 2) = 5\n\nNow the expression becomes:\n\n(5^2 * 4 + 12) / 6\n\nNext, exponents:\n\n5^2 = 25\n\nNow it's:\n\n(25 * 4 + 12) / 6\n\nThen, multiplication:\n\n25 * 4 = 100\n\nSo now we have:\n\n(100 + 12) / 6\n\nAddition:\n\n100 + 12 = 112\n\nNow, division:\n\n112 / 6 = 18.666...\n\nOr, as a fraction, it's 56/3.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 18.67 or exactly 56/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{56}{3}} \\]"
