However, I need to clarify that the question you've asked seems to be a bit unclear or perhaps a hypothetical scenario. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, you mentioned that a spaceship travels at 99% the speed of light for 5 years. That's an interesting setup involving relativistic speeds, which would indeed have significant effects due to time dilation as per Einstein's theory of relativity. At such high speeds, time passes differently for the spaceship compared to a stationary observer, but that might not directly relate to the number of oranges on board.\n\nThen, you asked, \"How many oranges are on board the spaceship?\" This seems unrelated to the initial part of the question. The number of oranges on board isn't typically determined by the speed of the spaceship or the duration of the travel, unless there's a specific context or scenario you're imagining.\n\nCould you please provide more details or clarify what you're trying to ask? I'd be happy to help once I understand the question better."
