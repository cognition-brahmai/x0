        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains moving towards each other from Town A and Town B, which are 300 miles apart. The first train from Town A is going at 60 mph, and the second train from Town B is going at 90 mph. I need to find out how long it will take for them to meet.\n\nOkay, so since they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. That makes sense because the closer they get, the faster they approach each other. So, the combined speed should be 60 mph plus 90 mph, which is 150 mph.\n\nNow, the total distance between the towns is 300 miles. If they're moving towards each other at a combined speed of 150 mph, I can find the time it takes for them to meet by dividing the distance by their combined speed.\n\nSo, time equals distance divided by speed. That would be 300 miles divided by 150 mph.\n\nLet me do the math: 300 divided by 150 is 2. So, it should take 2 hours for the trains to meet.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. In 2 hours, the first train would have traveled 60 mph times 2 hours, which is 120 miles. The second train would have traveled 90 mph times 2 hours, which is 180 miles. Adding those up, 120 plus 180 equals 300 miles, which is the total distance between the towns.\n\nPerfect, that checks out. So, the answer should be 2 hours.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider another approach. Let's think about their relative speed again. Since they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is indeed the sum of their individual speeds, which is 150 mph.\n\nSo, the formula is time = distance / relative speed, which is 300 / 150 = 2 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation based on the distances they travel. Let\u2019s say they meet after t hours.\n\nIn t hours, the first train travels 60t miles, and the second train travels 90t miles. Since they're moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they travel should equal the total distance between the towns.\n\nSo, 60t + 90t = 300.\n\nCombining like terms, that's 150t = 300.\n\nSolving for t, t = 300 / 150 = 2 hours.\n\nAgain, the same answer. Maybe I can consider the speed-time graph or something, but that seems unnecessary for this problem since the speeds are constant.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider one train stationary and the other approaching at the combined speed. If I consider the train from Town A stationary, then the train from Town B is approaching at 60 + 90 = 150 mph.\n\nSo, the time it takes for the moving train to cover the 300 miles is again 300 / 150 = 2 hours.\n\nI think no matter which way I look at it, the answer comes out to be 2 hours.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed, like whether the trains are accelerating or if the speed is not constant, but the problem says they're traveling at constant speeds of 60 mph and 90 mph.\n\nSo, no, that's not an issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about how far each train has traveled in a certain amount of time and see when their positions coincide.\n\nFor example, after 1 hour:\n\n- Train from A has traveled 60 miles.\n\n- Train from B has traveled 90 miles.\n\n- So, the remaining distance between them is 300 - 60 - 90 = 150 miles.\n\nAfter another hour:\n\n- Train from A travels another 60 miles, total 120 miles.\n\n- Train from B travels another 90 miles, total 180 miles.\n\n- Total distance covered by both is 120 + 180 = 300 miles, so they meet.\n\nYes, that also confirms that it takes 2 hours for them to meet.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways, and all methods lead to the same conclusion. So, I'm confident that the answer is 2 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
