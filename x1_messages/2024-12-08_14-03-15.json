I need to find out how many people have neither a cat nor a dog.\n\nOkay, let's start by understanding what's being asked. We have a total of 30 people, and some of them have pets\u2014specifically, cats and dogs. Some people have both a cat and a dog, which is important to note because they are being counted in both the cat and dog groups.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many people have at least one pet, either a cat or a dog or both. Then, I can subtract that number from the total number of people to find out how many have neither.\n\nSo, how many people have at least one pet? I know that if I just add the number of cat owners and dog owners, I get 18 + 12 = 30. But wait, that's the same as the total number of people. Does that mean everyone has a pet? But that can't be right because some people have both a cat and a dog.\n\nAh, yes, that's the key. The 6 people who have both a cat and a dog are being counted twice if I just add 18 and 12. So, to get the total number of people who have at least one pet, I need to subtract those 6 people who were double-counted.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nNumber of people with at least one pet = Number of cat owners + Number of dog owners - Number of people with both.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of people with at least one pet = 18 + 12 - 6 = 24.\n\nSo, 24 people have at least one pet. Now, to find out how many have neither, I subtract this number from the total number of people:\n\nNumber of people with neither = Total number of people - Number of people with at least one pet.\n\nNumber of people with neither = 30 - 24 = 6.\n\nTherefore, 6 people have neither a cat nor a dog.\n\nBut let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Another way to look at this is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nIn set theory, the principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any two sets, the size of their union is the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of their intersection.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nC = set of people who have a cat.\n\nD = set of people who have a dog.\n\nWe are given:\n\n|C| = 18,\n\n|D| = 12,\n\n|C \u2229 D| = 6.\n\nWe want to find the number of people who have at least one pet, which is |C \u222a D|.\n\nAccording to the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|C \u222a D| = |C| + |D| - |C \u2229 D| = 18 + 12 - 6 = 24.\n\nAgain, this matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, to find the number of people who have neither, we subtract |C \u222a D| from the total number of people:\n\nNeither = Total - |C \u222a D| = 30 - 24 = 6.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the people who have only cats, only dogs, and both, and then see how many are left without any pets.\n\nNumber of people with only cats: |C| - |C \u2229 D| = 18 - 6 = 12.\n\nNumber of people with only dogs: |D| - |C \u2229 D| = 12 - 6 = 6.\n\nNumber of people with both: |C \u2229 D| = 6.\n\nTotal number of pet owners: 12 (only cats) + 6 (only dogs) + 6 (both) = 24.\n\nAgain, subtracting from the total: 30 - 24 = 6 people with neither.\n\nThis reinforces the answer I arrived at earlier.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the data. For example, could there be people who have other types of pets, but the question is specifically about cats and dogs. It asks for people who have neither a cat nor a dog, so other pets wouldn't affect this calculation.\n\nAlso, the problem states that there are 30 people in the group, and it gives specific numbers for cat owners, dog owners, and those who have both. Assuming that all these numbers are mutually exclusive except for the overlap in those who have both cats and dogs.\n\nI think the answer is indeed 6 people have neither a cat nor a dog.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
