        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 10 houses in the village, and each house has at least one person living in it. Every person in the village is friends with exactly 9 other people. I need to find out how many people live in the village.\n\nFirst, I should probably think about how friendships work in this scenario. If every person has exactly 9 friends, and there are multiple people in the village, I need to figure out how these friendships are distributed.\n\nMaybe I can model this situation using graph theory, where each person is a vertex, and each friendship is an edge connecting two vertices. In this case, since every person is friends with exactly 9 others, the degree of each vertex is 9.\n\nWait, but there are 10 houses, and each house has at least one person. So, the number of people is at least 10, but it could be more.\n\nLet me denote the number of people in the village as n. So, n is at least 10.\n\nIn the graph, the sum of all degrees is equal to twice the number of edges, right? Because each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices.\n\nSo, the sum of degrees is 9n, since each of the n people has 9 friends.\n\nTherefore, the number of edges e is (9n)/2.\n\nBut in a graph, the number of edges must be an integer, so 9n must be even, meaning that n must be even.\n\nSo, n is even and at least 10.\n\nNow, I need to consider that there are 10 houses, each with at least one person. Maybe I need to think about how people are distributed among the houses and how that affects friendships.\n\nBut the problem doesn't provide any information about how friendships are affected by which house people live in. It just says that each person has exactly 9 friends, and there are 10 houses each with at least one person.\n\nPerhaps I can consider the entire village as one big group where friendships can be with anyone, regardless of the house they live in.\n\nIn that case, the graph is a 9-regular graph with n vertices, and I need to find n such that n is even and at least 10.\n\nBut there must be more constraints because not every even n will work.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about the total number of friendships.\n\nEach person has 9 friends, and there are n people, so total friendships are 9n, but since each friendship is counted twice (once for each friend), the actual number of unique friendships is (9n)/2.\n\nNow, I need to relate this to the number of houses.\n\nThere are 10 houses, each with at least one person. Let's denote the number of people in each house as h1, h2, ..., h10, where each hi >=1, and h1 + h2 + ... + h10 = n.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this partition into houses affects the friendship counts.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that friendships could be within the same house or between different houses, but the problem doesn't specify any restrictions based on houses.\n\nSo, perhaps the house information is just to set the scene and doesn't directly affect the friendships.\n\nIn that case, I can focus on the graph theory aspect.\n\nSo, we have a 9-regular graph with n vertices, and n is even and at least 10.\n\nBut I need to find the exact n.\n\nMaybe I can consider the possible values of n.\n\nSince n is even and at least 10, possible values are 10, 12, 14, etc.\n\nIs there a specific value of n for which a 9-regular graph exists?\n\nI recall that for a k-regular graph with n vertices to exist, n*k must be even, which is already satisfied since k=9 is odd, so n must be even, which it is.\n\nBut there might be other constraints.\n\nPerhaps I can think about the number of people per house.\n\nSince there are 10 houses, and each house has at least one person, the minimal case is that each house has exactly one person, so n=10.\n\nBut if n=10, then each person has 9 friends, which would mean that each person is friends with every other person in the village.\n\nSo, it's a complete graph on 10 vertices, K10.\n\nIn K10, each vertex has degree 9, which matches the condition.\n\nSo, in this case, with n=10, the conditions are satisfied.\n\nBut the problem states that each house has at least one person, not exactly one.\n\nSo, could there be more than one person per house?\n\nIf there are more people in some houses, then n would be greater than 10.\n\nBut in that case, how would the friendships work?\n\nIf n >10, can we still have a 9-regular graph?\n\nWait, in K10, if n=10, it's a 9-regular graph, as each person is friends with 9 others.\n\nIf n >10, say n=12, can we have a 9-regular graph with 12 vertices?\n\nLet me check: the sum of degrees would be 9*12=108, so the number of edges would be 108/2=54.\n\nBut is there a 9-regular graph with 12 vertices?\n\nI think so, but I'm not sure.\n\nHowever, I need to consider whether this fits with the house configuration.\n\nEach house has at least one person, but some houses could have more.\n\nSuppose one house has two people, and the other nine houses have one person each.\n\nThen, n=10+1=11.\n\nWait, no: 9 houses with one person and 1 house with two people: total n=11.\n\nBut 11 is odd, but n must be even, since 9n must be even.\n\nWait, 9n must be even because the sum of degrees is 9n, and it must be even, since it's twice the number of edges.\n\nSo, 9n even implies that n is even, since 9 is odd.\n\nTherefore, n must be even.\n\nSo, n=10,12,14,...\n\nNow, with n=10, the minimal case, it works.\n\nBut perhaps n=12 also works.\n\nBut I need to find the number of people in the village.\n\nIs there a unique solution?\n\nThe problem seems to suggest that there is a specific number of people in the village.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are multiple possible values of n, but perhaps only one makes sense given the constraints.\n\nWait, but in the minimal case, n=10 works.\n\nIf n=12, can we have a 9-regular graph on 12 vertices?\n\nI think it's possible, but I'm not sure.\n\nSimilarly, for n=14, and so on.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is designed such that n=10 is the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a way to determine that n must be 10 based on the given information.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose there are n people in the village, each with exactly 9 friends.\n\nTotal number of friendships is (9n)/2.\n\nNow, if the village is considered as a single entity, and friendships can be with anyone, then the graph is a 9-regular graph on n vertices.\n\nBut perhaps there are constraints based on the houses.\n\nEach house has at least one person, and there are 10 houses.\n\nSo, n >=10, and n is even.\n\nNow, in a 9-regular graph, the number of vertices n must be at least 10, since each person is friends with 9 others.\n\nWait, actually, in a 9-regular graph, each vertex has degree 9, meaning each person is connected to 9 others.\n\nIn graph theory, for a k-regular graph, the number of vertices n must be at least k+1 to form such a graph, but actually, it's possible to have a k-regular graph with n=k+1, which is the complete graph K_{k+1}.\n\nIn this case, k=9, so n>=10.\n\nWhich matches our earlier conclusion.\n\nNow, is there a way to have n=12 with a 9-regular graph?\n\nYes, it's possible to have such graphs, but perhaps in this specific problem, n=10 is the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is only one possible value of n that satisfies all the conditions.\n\nPerhaps the fact that there are 10 houses each with at least one person forces n=10.\n\nWait, but if some houses have more than one person, n could be greater than 10.\n\nHowever, the problem states that each house has at least one person, but doesn't specify any upper limit on the number of people per house.\n\nSo, n could be 10,12,14,...\n\nBut perhaps there is a unique solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the only possible value is n=10.\n\nLet me consider the following:\n\nIf n=10, and it's a complete graph K10, then each person is friends with every other person, which satisfies the condition of having exactly 9 friends.\n\nNow, if n=12, can we have a 9-regular graph on 12 vertices?\n\nYes, it's possible to construct such graphs, but perhaps in this context, it doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that n=10 is the only possible answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a unique solution based on the given constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of people is 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that friendships could be limited by house memberships, but the problem doesn't specify any such restrictions.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the minimal case is the intended answer.\n\nTherefore, the number of people in the village is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
