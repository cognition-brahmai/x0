        "content": "Let's see. The store sells apples for $2 per pound and oranges for $3 per pound. The customer buys 5 pounds of apples and 4 pounds of oranges. I need to find out the total cost before tax.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the cost of the apples. Since apples are $2 per pound and the customer buys 5 pounds, I can multiply 2 by 5. That should give me the total cost for the apples.\n\n2 * 5 = 10\n\nSo, the apples cost $10.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost of the oranges. Oranges are $3 per pound, and the customer buys 4 pounds. So, I'll multiply 3 by 4 to get the total cost for the oranges.\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nSo, the oranges cost $12.\n\nNow, to find the total cost before tax, I need to add the cost of the apples and the cost of the oranges together.\n\n10 + 12 = 22\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the purchase before tax is $22.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other cost involved here? Like, maybe a bag fee or something? But the question doesn't mention any additional costs, so I think $22 is the final answer.\n\nJust to double-check, let me go through the calculations again.\n\nApples: 5 pounds at $2 per pound.\n\n5 * 2 = 10\n\nOranges: 4 pounds at $3 per pound.\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nTotal: 10 + 12 = 22\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the customer's purchase costs $22 before tax.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22} \\]"
