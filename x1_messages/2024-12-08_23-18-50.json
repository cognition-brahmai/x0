        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! So, you want a Python function that takes two integers and checks if they are multiples of each other, right? That means, for two numbers, say a and b, you want to check if a is a multiple of b and if b is a multiple of a.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for one number to be a multiple of another. If a is a multiple of b, then a divided by b should give no remainder. In other words, a % b == 0. Similarly, if b is a multiple of a, then b % a == 0.\n\nSo, for two numbers to be multiples of each other, both these conditions should be true: a % b == 0 and b % a == 0.\n\nWait a minute, let's think about this. If a % b == 0, that means a is divisible by b without any remainder. And if b % a == 0, that means b is divisible by a without any remainder.\n\nLet's consider some examples to understand this better.\n\nExample 1:\n\nLet's take a = 6 and b = 3.\n\n6 % 3 = 0, so 6 is a multiple of 3.\n\n3 % 6 = 3, which is not 0, so 3 is not a multiple of 6.\n\nSo, in this case, only a is a multiple of b, but not vice versa.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTake a = 6 and b = 6.\n\n6 % 6 = 0, so 6 is a multiple of 6.\n\n6 % 6 = 0, so again, 6 is a multiple of 6.\n\nSo, both conditions are true.\n\nExample 3:\n\na = 4, b = 2.\n\n4 % 2 = 0, so 4 is a multiple of 2.\n\n2 % 4 = 2, which is not 0, so 2 is not a multiple of 4.\n\nExample 4:\n\na = 10, b = 5.\n\n10 % 5 = 0, so 10 is a multiple of 5.\n\n5 % 10 = 5, which is not 0, so 5 is not a multiple of 10.\n\nFrom these examples, it seems that for two different numbers, it's unlikely for both to be multiples of each other unless they are the same number.\n\nWait, but in example 2, where a and b are both 6, both conditions are true.\n\nAlso, consider a = 0 and b = 0.\n\n0 % 0 is undefined, actually. In programming, attempting to perform a modulo operation with 0 as the divisor will result in a runtime error.\n\nSimilarly, if one of the numbers is 0, say a = 0 and b = 5.\n\n0 % 5 = 0, so 0 is a multiple of 5.\n\n5 % 0 is undefined, error.\n\nSo, we need to handle cases where one or both numbers are 0.\n\nAnother thing to consider is negative numbers. Python's modulo operation with negative numbers works differently than with positive numbers.\n\nFor example:\n\n-6 % 3 = 0, so -6 is a multiple of 3.\n\n3 % -6 = 3, which is not 0, so 3 is not a multiple of -6.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n-6 % -3 = 0, so -6 is a multiple of -3.\n\n-3 % -6 = -3, which is not 0, so -3 is not a multiple of -6.\n\nSo, the sign doesn't really change the logic, as long as we're consistent with how Python handles the modulo operation.\n\nGiven all this, perhaps we can approach the problem by checking if both a % b == 0 and b % a == 0, keeping in mind to handle cases where a or b is 0.\n\nBut, as we saw, if a and b are non-zero and distinct, it's unlikely for both conditions to be true unless one is a multiple of the other in both directions, which only happens if a = b.\n\nWait, but in example 2, a = b = 6, and both conditions are true.\n\nSimilarly, a = b = any non-zero integer would satisfy both conditions.\n\nNow, what about a = 0 and b = 0?\n\nAs mentioned, 0 % 0 is undefined, so we need to handle this case separately.\n\nAlso, a = 0 and b = any non-zero integer.\n\n0 % b = 0, so 0 is a multiple of b.\n\nb % 0 is undefined, so we need to handle this as well.\n\nPerhaps, in such cases, we can consider that if one of the numbers is 0, then they are not multiples of each other, to avoid division by zero errors.\n\nAlternatively, we can say that 0 is a multiple of any non-zero integer, but any non-zero integer is not a multiple of 0.\n\nBut in our case, since we need both conditions to be true, perhaps it's safer to say that if either a or b is 0, they are not multiples of each other.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n\nTo create a function that checks if two integers are multiples of each other, we need to consider several scenarios, including cases where one or both numbers are zero. The function will return `True` only if both numbers are non-zero and they are multiples of each other, which essentially means they are equal in magnitude.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Check for Zero Values:**\n   - If either `a` or `b` is zero, they cannot be multiples of each other (to avoid division by zero errors).\n   \n2. **Check Multiples:**\n   - For two non-zero integers `a` and `b`, check if `a` is a multiple of `b` and `b` is a multiple of `a`.\n   - This condition holds true only if `a` and `b` are equal in magnitude.\n\n3. **Handle Negative Numbers:**\n   - Python's modulo operation handles negative numbers correctly, so no special handling is required beyond the general case.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef are_multiples(a, b):\n    if a == 0 or b == 0:\n        return False\n    return a % b == 0 and b % a == 0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Zero Check:** The function first checks if either `a` or `b` is zero. If so, it immediately returns `False` because multiples involving zero are not considered valid in this context.\n- **Multiples Check:** If both `a` and `b` are non-zero, it checks if `a` is a multiple of `b` and vice versa. This is only true if `a` and `b` are equal in magnitude.\n- **Negative Numbers:** The modulo operation in Python handles negative numbers appropriately, ensuring that the function works correctly with negative integers.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function behaves correctly for all integer inputs, including negative numbers and zeros."
