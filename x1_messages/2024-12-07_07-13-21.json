The set of all possible inputs is called the domain of the function, while the set of all possible outputs is called the range. In calculus, functions are often represented graphically, and their properties such as continuity, differentiability, and integrability are studied. Given this, which of the following statements about functions is correct?\n\nA. A function can assign more than one output to a single input.\nB. The domain of a function is the set of all possible outputs.\nC. The range of a function is the set of all possible inputs.\nD. The properties of a function cannot be studied graphically.\nE. A function assigns to each input exactly one output."

        "content": "Let's see. I have this question about functions in mathematics, and I need to pick the correct statement from the options given. Okay, first things first, I need to remember what a function is.\n\nSo, a function is like a rule that takes an input and gives exactly one output. That seems pretty straightforward. The question mentions that a function assigns to each input exactly one output, so that must be important.\n\nLet me look at option A: \"A function can assign more than one output to a single input.\" Hmm, but according to what I just recalled, a function should only give one output for each input. So, this sounds incorrect.\n\nOption B says: \"The domain of a function is the set of all possible outputs.\" Wait, no. The domain is the set of all possible inputs, right? The set of values that you can plug into the function. So, this seems wrong.\n\nOption C: \"The range of a function is the set of all possible inputs.\" Again, that doesn't sound right. I think the range is the set of all possible outputs, the values that the function can take on. So, this must be incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"The properties of a function cannot be studied graphically.\" I know that in calculus, we often look at graphs of functions to understand their properties, like whether they're continuous or differentiable. So, this seems false.\n\nOption E: \"A function assigns to each input exactly one output.\" This matches what I remember about functions. Each input corresponds to precisely one output.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option E is the correct statement about functions.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing. Let's think about each option again.\n\nOption A: If a rule assigns more than one output to an input, then by definition, it's not a function. It might be a relation, but not a function. So, definitely, this is incorrect.\n\nOption B: Domain is inputs, not outputs. Functions map from domain to range, so the domain is where the inputs live.\n\nOption C: Similarly, the range is the set of outputs, not inputs.\n\nOption D: Graphs are incredibly useful in calculus for visualizing and understanding function properties. So, this can't be correct.\n\nOption E: This aligns with the definition of a function.\n\nAlright, I'm confident that E is the correct choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{E} \\]"
