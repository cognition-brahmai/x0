        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to write a Java program that acts like a simple calculator. It should be able to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on what the user types in. So, if someone types something like \"5 + 3\", it should give back 8. Or if they type \"12 / 4\", it should return 3.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to structure this program. Since it's a command-line calculator, it should keep running until the user decides to exit. So, maybe I can put it in a loop that keeps asking for input until the user types something like \"exit\".\n\nI'll need to read input from the user, which in Java can be done using the Scanner class. So, I'll import Scanner from java.util.\n\nOnce I have the input, I need to parse it to understand what operation to perform. The input will be a string in the format \"number operator number\", like \"5 + 3\". So, I need to split this string into parts: the first number, the operator, and the second number.\n\nI can use the split() method of the String class to split the input string by spaces. That should give me an array of three strings: the first number, the operator, and the second number.\n\nThen, I need to convert these string numbers into actual numbers, probably doubles, so that I can perform mathematical operations on them.\n\nAfter that, I'll check what operator was entered and perform the corresponding operation:\n\n- If it's \"+\", I'll add the two numbers.\n\n- If it's \"-\", I'll subtract the second number from the first.\n\n- If it's \"*\", I'll multiply them.\n\n- If it's \"/\", I'll divide the first number by the second.\n\nI also need to handle some edge cases:\n\n- If the user enters something other than a number for the operands, I should handle that gracefully, maybe by showing an error message.\n\n- If the user tries to divide by zero, I need to catch that and tell them it's not allowed.\n\n- If the operator is something other than +, -, *, or /, I should inform the user that the operator is invalid.\n\nAlright, let's start by setting up the basic structure of the program.\n\nI'll create a class, say, CommandLineCalculator, and inside it, the main method where the program will start.\n\nFirst, I'll import the Scanner class:\n\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\nThen, define the class and the main method:\n\npublic class CommandLineCalculator {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        // Program code goes here\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nNow, inside the main method, I'll create a Scanner object to read input from the user:\n\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\nNext, I'll need a loop to keep the calculator running until the user wants to exit. I can use a while loop that continues until the user types \"exit\".\n\nSo, something like:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n    System.out.print(\"Enter expression or type 'exit' to quit: \");\n\n    String input = scanner.nextLine();\n\n    if (input.equalsIgnoreCase(\"exit\")) {\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n    // Parse and calculate the expression\n\n}\n\nThis way, the program keeps asking for expressions until the user types \"exit\".\n\nNow, inside the loop, after getting the input, I need to split it into parts.\n\nI'll use the split() method:\n\nString[] parts = input.split(\" \");\n\nI expect parts to be an array of three strings: [number, operator, number].\n\nBut I should check if the input has exactly three parts. If not, it's an invalid input.\n\nSo, I can add:\n\nif (parts.length != 3) {\n\n    System.out.println(\"Invalid expression. Please enter in the format: number operator number\");\n\n    continue;\n\n}\n\nAssuming the input is valid, I'll try to parse the first and second parts as doubles.\n\nDouble num1;\n\nDouble num2;\n\ntry {\n\n    num1 = Double.parseDouble(parts[0]);\n\n    num2 = Double.parseDouble(parts[2]);\n\n} catch (NumberFormatException e) {\n\n    System.out.println(\"Invalid numbers. Please enter valid numeric values.\");\n\n    continue;\n\n}\n\nNow, I have the two numbers and the operator. I can perform the operation based on the operator.\n\nI'll use a switch statement for this:\n\nswitch (parts[1]) {\n\n    case \"+\":\n\n        System.out.println(num1 + num2);\n\n        break;\n\n    case \"-\":\n\n        System.out.println(num1 - num2);\n\n        break;\n\n    case \"*\":\n\n        System.out.println(num1 * num2);\n\n        break;\n\n    case \"/\":\n\n        if (num2 == 0) {\n\n            System.out.println(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\");\n\n        } else {\n\n            System.out.println(num1 / num2);\n\n        }\n\n        break;\n\n    default:\n\n        System.out.println(\"Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.\");\n\n        break;\n\n}\n\nThis should cover the basic functionality.\n\nLet me think about potential improvements or additional features.\n\n- Maybe I can handle more operators in the future, like exponentiation or modulo.\n\n- I could also handle expressions with more than two operands, but that would complicate things.\n\n- Error handling can be improved to catch other kinds of errors.\n\n- I could also add a feature to keep a history of calculations.\n\nBut for a basic calculator, this should suffice.\n\nLet me write the complete code now.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple command-line calculator in Java that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you can use the following code. This program will continuously prompt the user to enter expressions like \"5 + 3\" or \"12 / 4\" and will provide the corresponding results. The program will run in a loop until the user decides to exit by typing \"exit\".\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class CommandLineCalculator {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        while (true) {\n            System.out.print(\"Enter expression or type 'exit' to quit: \");\n            String input = scanner.nextLine();\n\n            if (input.equalsIgnoreCase(\"exit\")) {\n                break;\n            }\n\n            String[] parts = input.split(\" \");\n\n            if (parts.length != 3) {\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid expression. Please enter in the format: number operator number\");\n                continue;\n            }\n\n            try {\n                double num1 = Double.parseDouble(parts[0]);\n                double num2 = Double.parseDouble(parts[2]);\n\n                switch (parts[1]) {\n                    case \"+\":\n                        System.out.println(num1 + num2);\n                        break;\n                    case \"-\":\n                        System.out.println(num1 - num2);\n                        break;\n                    case \"*\":\n                        System.out.println(num1 * num2);\n                        break;\n                    case \"/\":\n                        if (num2 == 0) {\n                            System.out.println(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\");\n                        } else {\n                            System.out.println(num1 / num2);\n                        }\n                        break;\n                    default:\n                        System.out.println(\"Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.\");\n                        break;\n                }\n            } catch (NumberFormatException e) {\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid numbers. Please enter valid numeric values.\");\n            }\n        }\n\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The program uses a `Scanner` to read input from the user in a loop. The loop continues until the user types \"exit\".\n\n2. **Expression Parsing**: The input string is split into an array based on spaces. It is expected to have exactly three parts: two numbers and an operator.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: \n   - Checks if the input has exactly three parts; otherwise, it prompts for the correct format.\n   - Tries to parse the first and third parts as doubles. If parsing fails, it informs the user about invalid numbers.\n   - For division, it checks if the denominator is zero and handles the division by zero error.\n\n4. **Operation Execution**: Uses a switch statement to perform the appropriate mathematical operation based on the operator provided.\n\nThis simple calculator handles basic arithmetic operations and provides feedback for invalid inputs, ensuring a smooth user experience."
