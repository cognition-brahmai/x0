        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. A leap year is a year that is exactly divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400. This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.\n\nHere's a simple Python function to check if a given year is a leap year:\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Example usage:\nyear = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\nif is_leap_year(year):\n    print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n```\n\nThis function takes a year as input and returns `True` if it's a leap year, otherwise `False`. The condition `(year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0)` checks the leap year rules:\n\n1. If the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, it's a leap year.\n\n2. If the year is divisible by 400, it's also a leap year.\n\nYou can test this function by entering different years. For example:\n\n- 2000: leap year\n\n- 1900: not a leap year\n\n- 2020: leap year\n\n- 2021: not a leap year\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!"
