        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: a train travels from City A to City B, covering a distance of 480 kilometers, and it takes 6 hours to do so. I need to find its average speed in meters per second. Okay, first things first, I need to understand what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, in this case, it's 480 kilometers divided by 6 hours.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the speed in meters per second, and the data is given in kilometers and hours. So, I need to convert the units accordingly. Let's start by finding the speed in kilometers per hour and then convert that to meters per second.\n\nSo, speed in kilometers per hour (km/h) is:\n\nSpeed = distance / time = 480 km / 6 h = 80 km/h\n\nNow, I need to convert 80 km/h to meters per second (m/s). To do that, I need to know how many meters are in a kilometer and how many seconds are in an hour.\n\nI know that:\n\n1 kilometer = 1,000 meters\n\n1 hour = 3,600 seconds (since 1 hour = 60 minutes and 1 minute = 60 seconds, so 60 * 60 = 3,600 seconds)\n\nSo, to convert km/h to m/s, I can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 km/h = 1,000 meters / 3,600 seconds = 5/18 m/s\n\nTherefore, to convert 80 km/h to m/s:\n\n80 km/h * (5/18) m/s per km/h = (80 * 5)/18 m/s = 400/18 m/s \u2248 22.22 m/s\n\nWait, but let's check if that's accurate. Alternatively, I can think of it in terms of multiplying by the ratio of meters to kilometers and seconds to hours.\n\nSo, 80 km/h * (1,000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3,600 s) = 80 * (1,000 / 3,600) m/s = 80 * (10 / 36) m/s = 80 * (5 / 18) m/s, which confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, 80 km/h is approximately 22.22 m/s.\n\nBut, to be precise, 400 divided by 18 is exactly 22.222... m/s, which can be written as 22.2 recurring m/s.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's a more precise way to calculate this without rounding off too early.\n\nLet me recalculate step by step:\n\nFirst, convert the distance from kilometers to meters:\n\n480 km = 480 * 1,000 m = 480,000 m\n\nThen, convert the time from hours to seconds:\n\n6 hours = 6 * 3,600 s = 21,600 s\n\nNow, average speed in m/s is:\n\nSpeed = distance / time = 480,000 m / 21,600 s\n\nLet's divide 480,000 by 21,600.\n\nFirst, simplify the fraction:\n\n480,000 \u00f7 21,600\n\nBoth numbers can be divided by 240 to simplify:\n\n480,000 \u00f7 240 = 2,000\n\n21,600 \u00f7 240 = 90\n\nSo, 2,000 / 90 = 200 / 9 = approximately 22.222... m/s\n\nSo, again, it's approximately 22.22 m/s.\n\nAlternatively, 200 divided by 9 is exactly 22.222..., which is 22 and 2/9 m/s.\n\nBut in decimal form, it's a repeating decimal, so it's often approximated as 22.22 m/s.\n\nHowever, to be precise, it's 22.222... m/s, or more accurately, 22.2 recurring m/s.\n\nBut for most practical purposes, 22.22 m/s is sufficient.\n\nLet me verify this with another method.\n\nAlternatively, I know that 1 km/h is equal to 5/18 m/s, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, 80 km/h * 5/18 = 400/18 = 22.222... m/s, which matches my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the average speed of the train is approximately 22.22 meters per second.\n\nBut to express it more precisely, I can write it as 22.22 m/s, understanding that it's a repeating decimal.\n\nAlternatively, I could express it as a fraction: 200/9 m/s.\n\nBut since the question likely expects a decimal answer, 22.22 m/s is acceptable.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there's a more accurate way to express this.\n\nLet me calculate 400 divided by 18 more precisely.\n\n400 \u00f7 18:\n\n18 * 22 = 396\n\n400 - 396 = 4\n\nSo, 400 \u00f7 18 = 22 with a remainder of 4.\n\nNow, 4/18 = 2/9 \u2248 0.222...\n\nSo, 22 + 0.222... = 22.222... m/s\n\nTherefore, it's accurate to say 22.22 m/s, rounding to two decimal places.\n\nAlternatively, if more precision is needed, I could write it as 22.222 m/s, but typically, two decimal places are sufficient for such calculations.\n\nSo, the average speed of the train is approximately 22.22 meters per second.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22.22} \\]"
