        "content": "So, I've got this problem here: A football team has 11 players, and there are 32 teams in the league. I need to find out how many players there are in total in the league. Hmm, seems straightforward, but let's break it down step by step to make sure I get it right.\n\nFirst, I know that each team has 11 players. That's a fact. And there are 32 teams in total. So, to find the total number of players, I should probably multiply the number of players per team by the number of teams. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, mathematically, it's:\n\nTotal players = number of players per team \u00d7 number of teams\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal players = 11 \u00d7 32\n\nNow, I need to calculate 11 times 32. Let's see, 11 times 30 is 330, and 11 times 2 is 22. So, adding those together, 330 + 22 equals 352.\n\nTherefore, there are 352 players in total in the league.\n\nBut wait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Are there any reserve players or something like that? The question just says \"a football team has 11 players,\" which typically refers to the starting lineup, but in reality, teams have more players including substitutes and reserves.\n\nHowever, since the problem specifies that each team has 11 players, I should probably stick to that number and not assume additional players. So, my answer should be 352 players in total.\n\nLet me just double-check my multiplication to be sure. 11 times 32:\n\n11\n\n\u00d7 32\n\n------\n\n22 (11\u00d72)\n\n330 (11\u00d730)\n\n------\n\n352\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of players in the league is 352.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{352} \\]"
