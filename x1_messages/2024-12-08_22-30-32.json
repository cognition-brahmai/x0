        "content": "Alright, I'm going to create a simple Node.js Express server that handles uploading JSON files containing book data and retrieving that data in a paginated manner. Since we're not using a database, I'll store the book data in-memory, probably in an array.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a basic Express server. I'll need to install Express and maybe body-parser for handling JSON data, although Express has built-in JSON parsing now. Also, for file uploads, I might need a package likemulter.\n\nLet me start by initializing a new Node.js project and installing the necessary dependencies.\n\n```bash\nmkdir book-server\ncd book-server\nnpm init -y\nnpm install express multer\n```\n\nNow, I'll create a file called server.js where I'll set up the Express app.\n\nI need two endpoints:\n\n1. POST /upload - for uploading the JSON file containing books.\n\n2. GET /books - for retrieving the books in a paginated list.\n\nFor the upload endpoint, I need to handle file uploads using multer. The uploaded file should be a JSON file containing an array of book objects, each with title, author, and publication year.\n\nI need to make sure that the uploaded file is parsed correctly and that the book data is stored in-memory. Since it's in-memory, I'll keep an array to store the books.\n\nFor the retrieval endpoint, I need to provide pagination. So, I should accept query parameters like page number and page size to determine which books to return.\n\nLet me sketch out the basic structure of the server.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Node.js Express server with the specified functionality, follow these steps:\n\n### Solution Code\n\n1. **Initialize the project and install dependencies:**\n   ```bash\n   mkdir book-server\n   cd book-server\n   npm init -y\n   npm install express multer\n   ```\n\n2. **Create `server.js`:**\n\n   ```javascript\n   const express = require('express');\n   const multer = require('multer');\n   const app = express();\n   const port = 3000;\n\n   // In-memory storage for books\n   let books = [];\n\n   // Configure multer for handling file uploads\n   const upload = multer({ storage: multer.memoryStorage() });\n\n   // POST /upload - Upload JSON file containing books\n   app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {\n     try {\n       const file = req.file;\n       if (!file) {\n         return res.status(400).send('No file uploaded.');\n       }\n       const fileData = JSON.parse(file.buffer.toString());\n       if (!Array.isArray(fileData)) {\n         return res.status(400).send('Uploaded file must contain an array of books.');\n       }\n       books = fileData;\n       res.status(200).send('Books uploaded successfully.');\n     } catch (error) {\n       console.error(error);\n       res.status(500).send('Error processing file.');\n     }\n   });\n\n   // GET /books - Retrieve paginated list of books\n   app.get('/books', (req, res) => {\n     try {\n       const page = parseInt(req.query.page, 10) || 1;\n       const pageSize = parseInt(req.query.pageSize, 10) || 10;\n       const startIndex = (page - 1) * pageSize;\n       const endIndex = startIndex + pageSize;\n\n       const paginatedBooks = books.slice(startIndex, endIndex);\n       res.json(paginatedBooks);\n     } catch (error) {\n       console.error(error);\n       res.status(500).send('Error retrieving books.');\n     }\n   });\n\n   // Start the server\n   app.listen(port, () => {\n     console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);\n   });\n   ```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Dependencies:**\n   - `express`: For creating the server and handling routes.\n   - `multer`: For handling file uploads.\n\n2. **In-Memory Storage:**\n   - An array `books` is used to store book data in memory.\n\n3. **File Upload Endpoint (`POST /upload`):**\n   - Uses `multer` to handle file uploads.\n   - Expects a single file containing JSON data.\n   - Parses the uploaded file and stores the book data in the `books` array.\n\n4. **Book Retrieval Endpoint (`GET /books`):**\n   - Accepts query parameters `page` and `pageSize` for pagination.\n   - Returns a paginated list of books based on the provided parameters.\n\n5. **Error Handling:**\n   - Basic error handling is implemented for file processing and data retrieval.\n\nThis setup provides a simple way to upload book data via a JSON file and retrieve it in a paginated manner without using any external databases."
