Currently, I'm using the following code:\n\n```python\njsts = 1335205804950\ndt = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(jsts/1000)\n```\n\nHowever, I have to divide the timestamp by 1000 to avoid getting an error that says `ValueError: year is out of range`. Is there a proper way to convert a JavaScript timestamp to Python `datetime`?"

        "content": "Yes, the way you're converting the JavaScript timestamp to a Python `datetime` object by dividing by 1000 is correct. This is because JavaScript timestamps are in milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970), whereas Python's `datetime.fromtimestamp()` method expects the timestamp to be in seconds since the Unix epoch.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **JavaScript Timestamp**: It's obtained in milliseconds.\n2. **Python `datetime`**: Expects a timestamp in seconds.\n\nTherefore, dividing the JavaScript timestamp by 1000 converts it from milliseconds to seconds, making it compatible with Python's `datetime.fromtimestamp()`.\n\nYour code correctly implements this conversion:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\njsts = 1335205804950  # JavaScript timestamp in milliseconds\ndt = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(jsts / 1000)  # Convert to seconds\nprint(dt)  # Output: 2012-04-23 18:30:04.950000\n```\n\nThis will give you the correct `datetime` object in Python. There's no alternative built-in method to handle millisecond timestamps directly, so dividing by 1000 is the proper and standard approach."
