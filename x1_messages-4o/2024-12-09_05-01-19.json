Here's what happens:\n\n1. When the `with` block is entered, the `time_print` function is called and starts executing. It records the current time in the variable `t`.\n\n2. The `yield` statement effectively pauses the execution of `time_print` and transfers control back to the code inside the `with` block (i.e., the code after `with time_print(\"processes\"):`). In this case, it runs the list comprehension `[doproc() for _ in range(500)]`.\n\n3. Once the block of code inside the `with` statement is executed (the list comprehension in this case), control returns to the `time_print` function, resuming right after the `yield` statement. The code inside the `finally` block then executes, printing the task name along with the time it took to execute the code inside the `with` block.\n\nRegarding when the `doproc` function gets executed: It is invoked 500 times within the list comprehension `[doproc() for _ in range(500)]`. This occurs during the execution of the code inside the `with` block, between the `yield` and the `finally` block in the `time_print` context manager. As a result, the total duration of these 500 function calls is measured and printed when the `finally` block runs."
