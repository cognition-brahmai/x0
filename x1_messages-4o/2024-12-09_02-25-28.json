For instance, I have the following list:\n\n```python\nA = [{'name':'john','age':45},\n     {'name':'andi','age':23},\n     {'name':'john','age':22},\n     {'name':'paul','age':35},\n     {'name':'john','age':21}]\n```\n\nI know how to sort this list by one value, such as 'name', using the following command:\n\n```python\nsorted(A, key = lambda user: user['name'])\n```\n\nHowever, I'm unsure how to sort this list by a second value, such as 'age'. Ideally, I want to sort by 'name' first and then by 'age'. The desired result would look something like this:\n\n```\nandi - 23\njohn - 21\njohn - 22\njohn - 45\npaul - 35\n```\n\nCan you guide me on how to achieve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! To sort a list of dictionaries by multiple keys in Python, you can use the `sorted()` function with a tuple as the key. The tuple should contain the values of the keys you want to sort by, in the order you want to sort them.\n\nFor your specific case, you want to sort by 'name' first and then by 'age'. You can achieve this by using the following code:\n\n```python\nsorted_list = sorted(A, key=lambda user: (user['name'], user['age']))\n```\n\nLet's break down the key function `lambda user: (user['name'], user['age'])`:\n\n- `user['name']`: This is the primary key for sorting. The list is first sorted by this key.\n- `user['age']`: This is the secondary key for sorting. Within each group of identical primary keys, the list is further sorted by this key.\n\nHere's how the sorted list would look:\n\n```python\n[\n    {'name': 'andi', 'age': 23},\n    {'name': 'john', 'age': 21},\n    {'name': 'john', 'age': 22},\n    {'name': 'john', 'age': 45},\n    {'name': 'paul', 'age': 35}\n]\n```\n\nThis will give you the desired order:\n\n```\nandi - 23\njohn - 21\njohn - 22\njohn - 45\npaul - 35\n```\n\nYou can print it in the desired format using:\n\n```python\nfor user in sorted_list:\n    print(f\"{user['name']} - {user['age']}\")\n```\n\nThis approach allows you to sort by multiple keys effectively."
