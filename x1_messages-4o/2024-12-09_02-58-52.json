Are there any advantages or disadvantages to these methods? I find it more intuitive to call it from `B` directly, but I wonder if there's a good reason where `super()` can only be used when using metaclasses."

        "content": "Using `super()` in Python, especially in Python 3, has several advantages over directly calling a superclass's method like `B.__init__(self)`. Here are some of the key differences and advantages of using `super()`:\n\n### Advantages of Using `super()`:\n\n1. **Multiple Inheritance**:\n   - `super()` is particularly useful in a multiple inheritance scenario. It ensures that the method resolution order (MRO) is respected and all classes in the hierarchy are properly initialized. This is something that directly calling `B.__init__(self)` cannot manage effectively.\n\n2. **Maintainability**:\n   - Using `super()` makes your code more maintainable. If you decide to change the superclass, you don't need to update the superclass name in the constructor calls. This helps reduce errors and makes refactoring easier.\n\n3. **Consistent Method Resolution Order**:\n   - `super()` ensures that the method resolution follows the MRO, which is a consistent and predictable order. This is crucial in complex class hierarchies where you want to make sure every class's method is called once and only once.\n\n4. **Flexibility**:\n   - In Python 3, using `super()` without arguments (`super()`) is simpler and more flexible. It automatically refers to the class and instance where it's used, making the code cleaner and less error-prone.\n\n### Disadvantages of Using `super()`:\n\n1. **Complexity**:\n   - For simple single inheritance hierarchies, using `super()` might seem unnecessarily complex, especially for beginners who are not familiar with the MRO.\n\n2. **Understanding MRO**:\n   - To effectively use `super()` in complex hierarchies, a good understanding of Python's MRO is necessary, which might add a learning curve.\n\n### When to Use Direct Calls:\n\n- Direct calls like `B.__init__(self)` might be acceptable in simple single inheritance scenarios, where you are sure that the class hierarchy will not change or become complex.\n- It can also be more intuitive in cases where you specifically want to call a method from a particular superclass, bypassing the MRO.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWhile directly calling a superclass's method might seem more intuitive in very simple cases, `super()` is generally the better approach due to its advantages in maintainability, flexibility, and proper handling of multiple inheritance. It is recommended to use `super()` to future-proof your code and ensure it behaves correctly in more complex scenarios."
