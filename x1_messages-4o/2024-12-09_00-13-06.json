        "content": "For large groups seeking a mode of public transportation with a lower carbon footprint, I would recommend using an electric bus. Electric buses are increasingly becoming popular in many cities around the world due to their environmental benefits. They produce zero tailpipe emissions, significantly reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional diesel or gasoline-powered buses. Additionally, electric buses are often quieter, which contributes to reduced noise pollution in urban areas. They can accommodate large groups comfortably, making them an excellent choice for sustainable group travel."
