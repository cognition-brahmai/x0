Let's examine the differences between consecutive numbers:\n\n- 5 - 2 = 3\n- 11 - 5 = 6\n- 23 - 11 = 12\n\nThe differences between consecutive terms are doubling: 3, 6, 12, ...\n\nThe next difference, continuing this pattern, would be 12 * 2 = 24.\n\nThus, the next number in the sequence would be:\n\n23 + 24 = 47\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is 47."
