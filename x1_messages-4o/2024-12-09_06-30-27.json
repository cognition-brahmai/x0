I have already set a random state in my StratifiedKFold but it does not seem to help. Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold, cross_val_score\n\nX = np.random.random((100,5))\ny = np.random.randint(0,2,(100,))\ncross_val_score = RandomForestClassifier()\ncv = StratifiedKFold(y, random_state=1)\ns = cross_val_score(cross_val_score, X, y,scoring='roc_auc', cv=cv)\nprint(s)\n# [ 0.42321429  0.44360902  0.34398496]\n\ns = cross_val_score(cross_val_score, X, y, scoring='roc_auc', cv=cv)\nprint(s)\n# [ 0.42678571  0.46804511  0.36090226]\n```\n\nCan you guide me on what I might be doing wrong that is causing the inconsistency in the results?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with inconsistent results in the `cross_val_score` function is likely due to the fact that the `RandomForestClassifier` itself has randomness in its algorithm, even if you have set the random state in `StratifiedKFold`. To achieve consistent results across different runs, you should also set the `random_state` parameter in the `RandomForestClassifier`. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold, cross_val_score\n\n# Generate random data\nX = np.random.random((100, 5))\ny = np.random.randint(0, 2, (100,))\n\n# Initialize the RandomForestClassifier with a random_state\nclassifier = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1)\n\n# Initialize StratifiedKFold with a random_state\ncv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=3, shuffle=True, random_state=1)\n\n# Use cross_val_score with the classifier and the StratifiedKFold\ns = cross_val_score(classifier, X, y, scoring='roc_auc', cv=cv)\nprint(s)\n\n# Call cross_val_score again to verify consistent results\ns = cross_val_score(classifier, X, y, scoring='roc_auc', cv=cv)\nprint(s)\n```\n\nIn this corrected code, I have:\n\n1. Set a `random_state` for the `RandomForestClassifier` to ensure that the randomness in the model itself is controlled.\n2. Specified `shuffle=True` in the `StratifiedKFold` to ensure that the data is shuffled before splitting, which is typically a good practice when combining it with a random state.\n\nBy controlling the randomness in both the model and the cross-validation setup, you should get consistent results across multiple runs."
