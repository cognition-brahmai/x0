I'm trying to do a test run with the following code:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nfrom logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler\n\n# logging.basicConfig(filename=\"example.log\", level=logging.DEBUG)\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger('my_logger')\nhandler = RotatingFileHandler(\"my_log.log\", maxBytes=2000, backupCount=10)\nlogger.addHandler(handler)\n\nfor _ in range(10000):\n    logger.debug(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\nHowever, with `logging.basicConfig` line commented out, the resulting `my_log.log` file contains no data. If I uncomment the line with `logging.basicConfig(filename=\"example.log\", level=logging.DEBUG)`, I get the expected `my_log.log` files with numbered suffixes. However, there is also the `example.log` which is a relatively large file."

        "content": "To configure Python's logging module to only generate `my_log.log` files and not create the `example.log` file, you need to ensure that your logger is properly set up with the desired handler and formatter, and you should avoid using `logging.basicConfig` if it's causing an unnecessary file creation. Instead, set up the logger manually without calling `basicConfig`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nfrom logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler\n\n# Set up a logger\nlogger = logging.getLogger('my_logger')\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  # Set the logging level\n\n# Create a handler that writes log messages to a file, with rotation\nhandler = RotatingFileHandler(\"my_log.log\", maxBytes=2000, backupCount=10)\nhandler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\n# Create a formatter and set it for the handler\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nhandler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\n# Add the handler to the logger\nlogger.addHandler(handler)\n\n# Log some test messages\nfor _ in range(10000):\n    logger.debug(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Logger Configuration**: Set the logger's level with `logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)` to ensure it captures all debug messages.\n2. **Handler and Formatter**: Assign a `Formatter` to your handler to format the log messages. This step is crucial to ensure the logs are written in a structured format.\n3. **Avoid `basicConfig`**: Since you're adding your own handlers, you don't need `basicConfig`, which would otherwise set up a global configuration that could include other handlers or configurations you don't want.\n\nBy configuring the logger, handler, and formatter as shown above, you can ensure that only `my_log.log` and its rotated versions are created, without an additional `example.log`."
