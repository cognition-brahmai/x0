Here's a simple example in Python:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total_cost(price, quantity, tax_rate):\n    # Calculate the subtotal\n    subtotal = price * quantity\n    \n    # Calculate the tax amount\n    tax_amount = subtotal * (tax_rate / 100)\n    \n    # Calculate the total cost\n    total_cost = subtotal + tax_amount\n    \n    return total_cost\n\n# Example usage:\nprice = 100  # Price per item\nquantity = 5  # Quantity of items\ntax_rate = 8  # Tax rate in percentage\n\ntotal_cost = calculate_total_cost(price, quantity, tax_rate)\nprint(f\"The total cost is: {total_cost}\")\n```\n\nThis function `calculate_total_cost` takes three arguments: `price` (the price per item), `quantity` (the number of items), and `tax_rate` (the tax rate as a percentage). It calculates the subtotal by multiplying the price by the quantity, then calculates the tax amount, and finally adds these to get the total cost.\n\nYou can adjust the `price`, `quantity`, and `tax_rate` variables with your specific values."
