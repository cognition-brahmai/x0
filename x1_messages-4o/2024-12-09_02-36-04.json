        "content": "I am planning to start using precomputed kernels in libSVM and wanted to make sure that libsvm provides accurate results. I started with non-precomputed kernels, using a simple linear kernel with 2 classes and three data points in 3-dimensional space. The data I used is as follows:\n\n```\n1 1:3 2:1 3:0\n2 1:3 2:3 3:1\n1 1:7 3:9\n```\n\nThe model file produced by calling `svm-train -s 0 - t 0` is:\n\n```\nsvm_type c_svc\nkernel_type linear\nnr_class 2\ntotal_sv 3\nrho -1.53951\nlabel 1 2\nnr_sv 2 1\nSV\n0.4126650675419768 1:3 2:1 3:0 \n0.03174528241667363 1:7 3:9 \n-0.4444103499586504 1:3 2:3 3:1 \n```\n\nHowever, when I manually calculate the solution, I get a different result. The coefficients `a1`, `a2`, `a3` returned by libsvm should be the values that maximize this equation `a1 + a2 + a3 - 5*a1*a1 + 12*a1*a2 - 21*a1*a3 - 19*a2*a2/2 + 21*a2*a3 - 65*a3*a3`, with the restrictions that `a1 + a3 = a2` and each of `a1`, `a2`, `a3` should be between 0 and 1 (the default value of C). According to the model file, the solution is `a1 = .412665...`, `a2 = .444410...`, `a3 = .031745...`. But when I substitute `a2 = a1 + a3` into the big formula and check if the partial derivatives are zero, they are not. So, am I making a mistake or is libsvm providing incorrect results?"

        "content": "The discrepancy you're observing could be due to several factors, including differences in how the optimization problem is formulated and solved, numerical precision, or the manual calculations used in verifying the results. Let's go through some points to consider:\n\n1. **Understanding the Optimization Problem**: The SVM optimization problem involves maximizing a dual objective function with constraints. The constraints you've mentioned, `a1 + a3 = a2` and the range for `a1, a2, a3`, might differ from the actual constraints used by libSVM. Typically, for a binary classification problem, the constraints are related to the sum of the Lagrange multipliers and the margin condition rather than specific equalities between them.\n\n2. **Dual Formulation in LibSVM**: The dual problem solved by libSVM is influenced by the data points, their labels, and the selected kernel. The constraints are typically that the sum of the product of the Lagrange multipliers and their corresponding labels is zero, and each Lagrange multiplier (alpha) is bounded between 0 and C.\n\n3. **Numerical Precision and Tolerances**: LibSVM uses numerical optimization techniques that might introduce small numerical inaccuracies. The solution found is often within a specified tolerance of optimality, which might not be precisely zero for the partial derivatives.\n\n4. **Manual Calculation Errors**: When manually calculating or verifying the solution, it's easy to introduce errors, especially in complex expressions. Double-check your calculations for any algebraic or computational mistakes.\n\n5. **Kernel and Hyperparameters**: Ensure that the kernel type and hyperparameters used in your manual calculations match those in your libSVM setup. Even small discrepancies can lead to different results.\n\n6. **Validation**: Consider using a validation set to assess the performance of your model, which may provide more practical insight into whether the model is behaving as expected.\n\nIn summary, the differences you're observing could stem from a mismatch in problem formulation, errors in manual calculations, or numerical precision issues. Review the formulation used by libSVM and ensure your manual calculations align with it. If the discrepancy persists, it might be beneficial to use a debugging or visualization tool to better understand the optimization process and results."
