However, even though the id is already in the list, the code I've written still appends the id. Can someone help identify what's wrong with my code? Here's the code:\n\n```python\nlist = ['350882 348521 350166\\r\\n']\nid = 348521\nif id not in list:\n    list.append(id)\nprint(list)\n```\nThe output I'm getting is: `['350882 348521 350166\\r\\n', 348521]`, even though `348521` is already present in the string in the list."

        "content": "The issue with your code is that the list contains a single string element: `'350882 348521 350166\\r\\n'`. When you check `if id not in list:`, you're checking if the integer `348521` is not a separate element in the list, which it isn't, so the integer gets appended.\n\nTo fix the issue, you need to split the string into individual components and check if the `id` is present within those components before appending. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\n# Original list with a single string element\nmy_list = ['350882 348521 350166\\r\\n']\n\n# Convert the single string into a list of strings\nid_list = my_list[0].strip().split()\n\n# Convert the id to a string for comparison\nid = '348521'\n\n# Check if the id is already present in the list of strings\nif id not in id_list:\n    # Append id to the original list (as a string within the single string element)\n    my_list[0] = my_list[0].strip() + ' ' + id + '\\r\\n'\n\nprint(my_list)\n```\n\nThis code will correctly check if `348521` is present in the list of strings derived from the single string in your list and will only append it if it's not already present. Note that I've changed the variable name from `list` to `my_list` to avoid shadowing the built-in `list` type in Python."
