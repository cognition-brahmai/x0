For example, with a function like this:\n\n```python\ndef foo(a, b=()):\n  print(a)\n  for x in b:\n    print(x)\n```\n\nI am specifically interested in a scenario where an immutable iterable is preferable. There seem to be very few examples of this use case that I can find."

        "content": "Using an empty tuple as a default for an iterable argument in a function, like in your example, can be quite effective and has some advantages, especially when you want to ensure immutability. Here's a breakdown of why this can be a good approach and any potential issues you might want to be aware of:\n\n### Advantages:\n1. **Immutability**: Tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, they cannot be modified. This makes them a safe choice for default arguments since they won't be accidentally altered within the function, unlike lists which can be modified.\n\n2. **Memory Efficiency**: An empty tuple is a single immutable object that is allocated once and can be shared across multiple calls to the function. This can be more memory-efficient than using a list, especially in cases where the function is called frequently without the need for the default argument.\n\n3. **Clarity of Intent**: Using a tuple as a default value can signal to other developers that the function is expected to work with an immutable sequence. This can help in understanding the function\u2019s design and expected usage.\n\n### Potential Issues:\n1. **Behavioral Expectations**: If users of the function expect the default iterable to be mutable (like a list), they might be surprised when trying to modify it and encountering errors. This could lead to confusion if not properly documented.\n\n2. **Type Constraints**: If the function is later modified to require operations that are specific to mutable sequences (e.g., appending elements), the use of a tuple could become a limitation.\n\n3. **Iterability Assumptions**: While an empty tuple works well as an iterable, if the function is expected to handle large or complex sequences, it might be beneficial to clearly document the choice of a tuple to prevent misconceptions about how the function should be used.\n\n### Best Practices:\n- **Documentation**: Clearly document the choice of using a tuple and the reasons behind it, especially if the immutability of the default argument is a design decision.\n- **Function Signature Clarity**: Consider if the function signature communicates the expected usage well. If the function is part of a public API, clarity in expected argument types is crucial.\n- **Error Handling**: Implement checks or error messages if the function requires behaviors incompatible with the immutability of a tuple.\n\nIn summary, using an empty tuple as a default argument is a good practice when you want to ensure immutability and avoid pitfalls associated with mutable default arguments. Just ensure that the choice is well-documented and aligns with the expected use cases of the function."
