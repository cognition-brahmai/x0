Here's a programming task that involves using dictionaries:\n\n---\n\n### Programming Task: Student Grades Manager\n\n#### Objective:\nCreate a simple console application that manages student grades using dictionaries. The application should allow users to add, update, and retrieve student grades, as well as calculate the average grade for a student.\n\n#### Requirements:\n\n1. **Add Student and Grade:**\n   - Allow the user to add a new student along with their grade.\n   - Ensure that the student's name is unique. If the student already exists, prompt the user to update the grade instead.\n\n2. **Update Student Grade:**\n   - Allow the user to update the grade of an existing student.\n\n3. **Retrieve Student Grade:**\n   - Allow the user to retrieve the grade of a specific student.\n\n4. **Calculate Average Grade:**\n   - Provide a functionality to calculate and display the average grade of all students.\n\n5. **Display All Students and Grades:**\n   - Display a list of all students and their corresponding grades.\n\n#### Suggested Steps:\n\n1. **Create a Dictionary:**\n   - Use a dictionary to store student names as keys and their grades as values.\n\n2. **Implement Functions:**\n   - `add_student(name, grade)`: Adds a new student and grade.\n   - `update_grade(name, grade)`: Updates the grade for an existing student.\n   - `get_grade(name)`: Retrieves the grade for a specific student.\n   - `calculate_average()`: Calculates the average grade of all students.\n   - `display_all_students()`: Displays all students and their grades.\n\n3. **Console Interface:**\n   - Create a simple text-based interface that allows the user to choose options to add, update, retrieve, calculate, or display data.\n\n#### Example Usage:\n\n```\nChoose an option:\n1. Add Student and Grade\n2. Update Student Grade\n3. Retrieve Student Grade\n4. Calculate Average Grade\n5. Display All Students and Grades\n6. Exit\n```\n\n#### Expected Output:\n\n- When adding a new student:\n  - \"Student added successfully.\"\n- When updating a grade:\n  - \"Grade updated successfully.\"\n- When retrieving a grade:\n  - \"The grade for [Student Name] is [Grade].\"\n- When calculating the average:\n  - \"The average grade is [Average].\"\n- When displaying all students:\n  - A list of all students and their grades.\n\n#### Additional Notes:\n- Validate user inputs to ensure proper data entry.\n- Handle edge cases, such as attempting to update or retrieve a grade for a non-existent student.\n\n---\n\nThis task will help you practice working with dictionaries, handling user input, and performing basic data manipulation in a programming context."
