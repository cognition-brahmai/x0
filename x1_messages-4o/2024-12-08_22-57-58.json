You need to consider multiple subdomains, international domain names, and non-ASCII characters while writing this code.

        "content": "Certainly! To thoroughly validate email addresses with PHP using regular expressions, we need to consider several components of an email address, including the local part (username), the domain, and the top-level domain (TLD). Additionally, we need to account for international domain names and non-ASCII characters.\n\nHere's a PHP function that uses regular expressions to validate email addresses with these considerations:\n\n```php\nfunction validateEmail($email) {\n    // Regular expression pattern for validating email addresses\n    $pattern = '/^(?!(?:(?:[^<>()[\\]\\\\.,;:\\s@\\\"]+(?:\\.[^<>()[\\]\\\\.,;:\\s@\\\"]+)*)|(\\\".+\\\"))@(?:(?:[^<>()[\\]\\\\.,;:\\s@\\\"]+\\.)*[^<>()[\\]\\\\.,;:\\s@\\\"]{2,}|(?:\\d{1,3}\\.){3}\\d{1,3}))(?:\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})$)(?:(?:[\\p{L}\\p{N}!#$%&\\'*+\\/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\\.[\\p{L}\\p{N}!#$%&\\'*+\\/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*)|(?:\\\"(?:[\\x01-\\x08\\x0b\\x0c\\x0e-\\x1f\\x21\\x23-\\x5b\\x5d-\\x7f]|\\\\[\\x01-\\x09\\x0b\\x0c\\x0e-\\x7f])*\\\")@(?:(?:[\\p{L}\\p{N}](?:[\\p{L}\\p{N}-]{0,61}[\\p{L}\\p{N}])?\\.)+[\\p{L}\\p{N}]{2,}|(?:\\d{1,3}\\.){3}\\d{1,3})(?:\\:\\d+)?)(?<!\\.)$/u';\n\n    // Validate the email address against the pattern\n    return preg_match($pattern, $email) === 1;\n}\n\n// Example usage\n$email = \"example@sub.domain.com\";\nif (validateEmail($email)) {\n    echo \"Valid email address.\";\n} else {\n    echo \"Invalid email address.\";\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Regular Expression:\n\n1. **Local Part (Username)**: \n   - Allows alphanumeric characters and special characters like `!#$%&'*+-/=?^_`{|}~`.\n   - Supports quoted strings for special cases.\n   - Considers Unicode characters using `\\p{L}` for letters and `\\p{N}` for numbers.\n\n2. **Domain Part**:\n   - Allows multiple subdomains.\n   - Supports Unicode characters using `\\p{L}` and `\\p{N}`.\n   - Accounts for IP address literals.\n   \n3. **Top-Level Domain (TLD)**:\n   - Ensures at least two characters for TLD.\n   - Supports both ASCII and non-ASCII characters.\n\n### Integration into a Larger Application:\n\nTo integrate this validation into a larger application, such as a web-based form in a PHP framework like Laravel, you could create a custom validation rule. Here\u2019s how you could do it in Laravel:\n\n1. **Create a Custom Validation Rule**:\n\n```php\n// Create a new custom rule using Artisan command\n// php artisan make:rule EmailValidation\n\n// In app/Rules/EmailValidation.php\nnamespace App\\Rules;\n\nuse Illuminate\\Contracts\\Validation\\Rule;\n\nclass EmailValidation implements Rule\n{\n    public function passes($attribute, $value)\n    {\n        $pattern = '/^(?!(?:(?:[^<>()[\\]\\\\.,;:\\s@\\\"]+(?:\\.[^<>()[\\]\\\\.,;:\\s@\\\"]+)*)|(\\\".+\\\"))@(?:(?:[^<>()[\\]\\\\.,;:\\s@\\\"]+\\.)*[^<>()[\\]\\\\.,;:\\s@\\\"]{2,}|(?:\\d{1,3}\\.){3}\\d{1,3}))(?:\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})$)(?:(?:[\\p{L}\\p{N}!#$%&\\'*+\\/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\\.[\\p{L}\\p{N}!#$%&\\'*+\\/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*)|(?:\\\"(?:[\\x01-\\x08\\x0b\\x0c\\x0e-\\x1f\\x21\\x23-\\x5b\\x5d-\\x7f]|\\\\[\\x01-\\x09\\x0b\\x0c\\x0e-\\x7f])*\\\")@(?:(?:[\\p{L}\\p{N}](?:[\\p{L}\\p{N}-]{0,61}[\\p{L}\\p{N}])?\\.)+[\\p{L}\\p{N}]{2,}|(?:\\d{1,3}\\.){3}\\d{1,3})(?:\\:\\d+)?)(?<!\\.)$/u';\n        return preg_match($pattern, $value) === 1;\n    }\n\n    public function message()\n    {\n        return 'The :attribute must be a valid email address.';\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. **Use the Custom Rule in a Form Request**:\n\n```php\n// In your FormRequest class\nuse App\\Rules\\EmailValidation;\n\npublic function rules()\n{\n    return [\n        'email' => ['required', 'string', new EmailValidation],\n    ];\n}\n```\n\nBy integrating this custom validation rule into your Laravel application, you ensure that any email address input is thoroughly validated according to the specified criteria. This approach makes it easy to maintain and update the validation logic while keeping your application clean and organized."
