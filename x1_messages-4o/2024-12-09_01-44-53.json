        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to `pytest` being installed in a different Python environment than the one you have activated with `pyenv`. When you use `pyenv shell 3.5.2`, it changes the Python version for the shell session, but it doesn't automatically change where `pytest` is being executed from. Here\u2019s how you can resolve this:\n\n1. **Ensure `pytest` is installed in the correct environment:**\n\n   First, make sure that `pytest` is installed for Python 3.5.2. You can do this by installing `pytest` into the active Python environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   pyenv shell 3.5.2\n   pip install pytest\n   ```\n\n2. **Check your PATH:**\n\n   Make sure that the `pytest` command you are running is the one installed for Python 3.5.2. You can check this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   which pytest\n   ```\n\n   This should point to a location under `~/.pyenv/versions/3.5.2/bin/pytest`. If it points somewhere else, it's likely that the `pytest` installed for another Python version (like the system Python) is being used.\n\n3. **Rehash pyenv:**\n\n   Sometimes, `pyenv` needs to be rehashed to recognize newly installed executables. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   pyenv rehash\n   ```\n\n4. **Use virtual environments:**\n\n   If you frequently switch Python versions, consider using `pyenv-virtualenv`. It integrates well with `pyenv` and helps manage dependencies for different projects. You can create a virtual environment with:\n\n   ```bash\n   pyenv virtualenv 3.5.2 myenv\n   pyenv activate myenv\n   pip install pytest\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to ensure that `pytest` runs with the correct Python version. If the issue persists, double-check your shell configuration files (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) to ensure there are no conflicting settings affecting your PATH."
