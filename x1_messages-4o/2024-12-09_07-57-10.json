        "content": "To hide the numbers on the axes while keeping the axis labels, you can use the `set_tick_params` method to set the visibility of the ticks to `False`. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Assuming sim_1 is already defined and contains 't' and 'V'\nplt.plot(sim_1['t'], sim_1['V'], 'k')\nplt.ylabel('V')\nplt.xlabel('t')\n\n# Hide the tick labels on both axes\nplt.gca().tick_params(axis='both', which='both', labelbottom=False, labelleft=False)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code will keep the axis labels `V` and `t` while hiding the numbers on both the x-axis and y-axis. The `tick_params` method is used to control the appearance of ticks, and setting `labelbottom` and `labelleft` to `False` hides the labels on the x-axis and y-axis, respectively."
