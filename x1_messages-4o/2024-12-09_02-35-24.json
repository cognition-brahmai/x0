        "content": "In CUDA, you can obtain IEEE 754 special values like infinity and NaN using predefined constants and functions that are part of the CUDA math API. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Infinity**: You can use the predefined constant `CUDART_INF` for positive infinity. For negative infinity, you can simply negate this value.\n\n   ```cpp\n   #include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n   __global__ void specialValuesKernel() {\n       float positiveInfinity = CUDART_INF;\n       float negativeInfinity = -CUDART_INF;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **NaN**: You can use the `nanf()` function for single-precision (float) NaN and `nan()` for double-precision (double) NaN. These functions take an unsigned integer argument that is used to create a specific bit-pattern NaN. If you just want a generic NaN, you can pass 0.\n\n   ```cpp\n   #include <cmath> // For nanf()\n\n   __global__ void specialValuesKernel() {\n       float nanValue = nanf(\"\"); // or nanf(\"0\")\n   }\n   ```\n\nNote: The argument to `nanf()` and `nan()` is typically a string containing a number or \"0\", which is used to set the payload of the NaN. However, passing an empty string or \"0\" is common to create a generic NaN.\n\nThese methods are stable and shouldn't be optimized out by the compiler, as they directly utilize CUDA's built-in mechanisms for handling special floating-point values."
