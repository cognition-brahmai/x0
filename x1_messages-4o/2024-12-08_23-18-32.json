The distance between these two cities is unknown to the tourists, but they do know the following facts:\n- If they travel at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, they will reach city B in 6 hours.\n- If they travel at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, they will reach city B in 5 hours.\nWhat is the distance between city A and city B? Provide your answer in miles, rounded to the nearest whole number."

Traveling at an average speed of 50 miles per hour for 6 hours:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 50 \\, \\text{miles/hour} \\times 6 \\, \\text{hours} = 300 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\n2. Traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 60 \\, \\text{miles/hour} \\times 5 \\, \\text{hours} = 300 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nIn both scenarios, the distance between city A and city B is 300 miles. Therefore, the distance is 300 miles."
