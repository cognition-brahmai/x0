Here's how you can do it:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nlet passage = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Proin lacinia nibh felis, quis dignissim quam interdum ut.\"\nlet wordToCount = \"quis\"\n\n// Split the passage into words using whitespace and punctuation as delimiters\nlet words = passage.components(separatedBy: CharacterSet.whitespacesAndNewlines.union(CharacterSet.punctuationCharacters))\n\n// Filter the words array to count the occurrences of the specific word\nlet count = words.filter { $0.lowercased() == wordToCount.lowercased() }.count\n\nprint(\"The word '\\(wordToCount)' appears \\(count) times in the passage.\")\n```\n\nThis code splits the passage into individual words by separating it with whitespace and punctuation characters. It then filters these words to find occurrences of the specified word, adjusting for case sensitivity by converting both the word and the elements in the array to lowercase before comparison. Finally, it counts and prints the number of times the word appears."
