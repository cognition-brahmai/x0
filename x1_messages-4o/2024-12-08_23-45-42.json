Each fruit has a different tax rate based on its country of origin, ranging from 6.25% to 9.75%. How can you calculate the cost of each fruit separately, taking into account the varying tax rates? Please provide the calculation steps in Latex format."

        "content": "To determine the individual cost of each fruit, we need to follow a series of steps. This involves calculating the original total cost before the discount, distributing the costs among the fruits, and then applying the tax rates to find the pre-tax cost of each fruit. Here's how you can approach this problem in a structured manner:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Original Total Cost\n\nThe total cost after a 10% discount is $52.83. Let's denote the original total cost as \\( T \\).\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{52.83}{0.90}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{52.83}{0.90} \\approx 58.70\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Define the Costs and Tax Rates\n\nAssume each fruit has a base cost of \\( x_i \\) and a tax rate of \\( t_i \\), where \\( i \\) ranges from 1 to 7.\n\nThe tax-inclusive cost for each fruit is:\n\n\\[\nx_i + x_i \\cdot t_i = x_i (1 + t_i)\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Set Up the System of Equations\n\nThe sum of the tax-inclusive costs of all fruits should equal the original total cost:\n\n\\[\nx_1(1 + t_1) + x_2(1 + t_2) + \\cdots + x_7(1 + t_7) = 58.70\n\\]\n\nGiven the tax rates \\( t_i \\) are between 6.25% and 9.75%, assign each fruit a unique tax rate from this range. For simplicity, suppose:\n\n- \\( t_1 = 6.25\\% \\)\n- \\( t_2 = 7.00\\% \\)\n- \\( t_3 = 7.75\\% \\)\n- \\( t_4 = 8.25\\% \\)\n- \\( t_5 = 8.50\\% \\)\n- \\( t_6 = 9.25\\% \\)\n- \\( t_7 = 9.75\\% \\)\n\n### Step 4: Solve for Each \\( x_i \\)\n\nFor simplicity in distributing the costs, assume each fruit costs approximately the same before tax, and solve using proportions since exact costs aren't specified. We can set these equations as:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx_1(1.0625) + x_2(1.07) + x_3(1.0775) + x_4(1.0825) + x_5(1.085) + x_6(1.0925) + x_7(1.0975) = 58.70\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTo solve this, you'll need additional constraints or assumptions about the relative base costs \\( x_i \\). In practice, you might need more information to solve this precisely, such as ratios or specific base costs for one or more fruits. In this scenario, you can distribute the total cost based on assumptions or known ratios about the fruits.\n\n### Step 5: Example Calculation\n\nFor instance, if we assume \\( x_1 \\approx x_2 \\approx \\cdots \\approx x_7 \\), then:\n\n\\[\n7x(1 + \\overline{t}) = 58.70\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\overline{t}\\) is the average of the tax rates. Calculate \\( \\overline{t} \\) and solve for \\( x \\).\n\nThis problem is typically solved with additional information or numerical methods if precise allocations are needed."
