        "content": "Integrating Facebook Login into your Django application involves a few steps, which include setting up a Facebook app, configuring Django settings, and using a library to handle the OAuth2 authentication flow. Here's a guide to help you through the process:\n\n### Step 1: Create a Facebook App\n1. **Visit [Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/)**\n   - Log in with your Facebook account.\n   - Go to \"My Apps\" and click \"Create App.\"\n\n2. **Configure Your App**\n   - Choose the type of app you want to create (e.g., Consumer).\n   - Fill in the required details like app name and contact email.\n   - Complete the security check.\n\n3. **Add Facebook Login Product**\n   - Navigate to the \"Add a Product\" section in the app dashboard.\n   - Select \"Facebook Login\" and set it up.\n\n4. **Configure OAuth Redirect URI**\n   - In the Facebook Login settings, add a redirect URI: `https://<your-domain>/accounts/facebook/login/callback/`\n   - Replace `<your-domain>` with your actual domain or `localhost` for local development.\n\n5. **Retrieve App ID and Secret**\n   - Go to the app settings and note down the App ID and App Secret.\n\n### Step 2: Install and Configure Python Social Auth\n1. **Install the Package**\n   - Use pip to install the necessary package:\n     ```\n     pip install social-auth-app-django\n     ```\n\n2. **Update Django Settings**\n   - Add `'social_django'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:\n     ```python\n     INSTALLED_APPS = [\n         ...\n         'social_django',\n         ...\n     ]\n     ```\n\n   - Add Authentication Backends:\n     ```python\n     AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (\n         'social_core.backends.facebook.FacebookOAuth2',\n         'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',\n     )\n     ```\n\n   - Add Social Auth settings:\n     ```python\n     SOCIAL_AUTH_FACEBOOK_KEY = '<your-app-id>'\n     SOCIAL_AUTH_FACEBOOK_SECRET = '<your-app-secret>'\n     SOCIAL_AUTH_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/'\n     ```\n\n   - Add context processors to `TEMPLATES`:\n     ```python\n     'context_processors': [\n         ...\n         'social_django.context_processors.backends',\n         'social_django.context_processors.login_redirect',\n         ...\n     ]\n     ```\n\n3. **Add URLs**\n   - Update your `urls.py` to include social auth URLs:\n     ```python\n     from django.urls import path, include\n\n     urlpatterns = [\n         ...\n         path('accounts/', include('social_django.urls', namespace='social')),\n         ...\n     ]\n     ```\n\n### Step 3: Create Login and Callback Views\n- Use Django's built-in views for authentication:\n  - The login URL will typically be `/accounts/login/` with a `?next=/<redirect-url>` query parameter.\n  - Facebook will handle the redirect to `/accounts/facebook/login/callback/` after authentication.\n\n### Step 4: Update Templates\n- Update your login template to include a link/button for Facebook login:\n  ```html\n  <a href=\"{% url 'social:begin' 'facebook' %}?next={{ request.path }}\">Login with Facebook</a>\n  ```\n\n### Step 5: Test and Debug\n- Ensure that your app is in development mode in the Facebook App dashboard if you are testing locally.\n- Test the login flow to ensure users can authenticate using their Facebook accounts.\n\n### Additional Resources\n- Check the [official documentation](https://python-social-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/facebook.html) for more detailed instructions and configuration options.\n- Refer to the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/) for any further integration details and best practices.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate Facebook Login into your Django application.
