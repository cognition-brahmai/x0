I have noticed that most examples I find online include a step of data normalization, like `X_train /= 255`. However, when I tested my model without this normalization step, the model's performance (accuracy) decreased, despite keeping the same number of epochs. Why does this happen? If I increase the number of epochs, can the accuracy reach the same level as a model trained with normalization? Does normalization affect accuracy, or just the training speed? Here is the source code for my training script:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers.convolutional import Conv2D\nfrom keras.layers.convolutional import MaxPooling2D\nfrom keras.layers.core import Activation\nfrom keras.layers.core import Flatten\nfrom keras.layers.core import Dense\nfrom keras.datasets import mnist\nfrom keras.utils import np_utils\nfrom keras.optimizers import SGD, RMSprop, Adam\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom keras import backend as k\n\ndef build(input_shape, classes):\n    model = Sequential()\n    model.add(Conv2D(20, kernel_size=5, padding=\"same\",activation='relu',input_shape=input_shape))\n    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), strides=(2, 2)))\n    model.add(Conv2D(50, kernel_size=5, padding=\"same\", activation='relu'))\n    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), strides=(2, 2)))\n    model.add(Flatten())\n    model.add(Dense(500))\n    model.add(Activation(\"relu\"))\n    model.add(Dense(classes))\n    model.add(Activation(\"softmax\"))\n    return model\n\nNB_EPOCH = 4 # number of epochs\nBATCH_SIZE = 128 # size of the batch\nVERBOSE = 1 # set the training phase as verbose\nOPTIMIZER = Adam() # optimizer\nVALIDATION_SPLIT=0.2 # percentage of the training data used for evaluating the loss function\nIMG_ROWS, IMG_COLS = 28, 28 # input image dimensions\nNB_CLASSES = 10 # number of outputs = number of digits\nINPUT_SHAPE = (1, IMG_ROWS, IMG_COLS) # shape of the input\n\n(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()\n\nk.set_image_dim_ordering(\"th\")\n\nX_train = X_train.astype('float32')\nX_test = X_test.astype('float32')\nX_train /= 255\nX_test /= 255\n\nX_train = X_train[:, np.newaxis, :, :]\nX_test = X_test[:, np.newaxis, :, :]\nprint(X_train.shape[0], 'train samples')\nprint(X_test.shape[0], 'test samples')\n\ny_train = np_utils.to_categorical(y_train, NB_CLASSES)\ny_test = np_utils.to_categorical(y_test, NB_CLASSES)\n\nmodel = build(input_shape=INPUT_SHAPE, classes=NB_CLASSES)\nmodel.compile(loss=\"categorical_crossentropy\", optimizer=OPTIMIZER,metrics=[\"accuracy\"])\n\nhistory = model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, epochs=NB_EPOCH, verbose=VERBOSE, validation_split=VALIDATION_SPLIT)\n\nmodel.save(\"model2\")\n\nscore = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=VERBOSE)\nprint('Test accuracy:', score[1])\n```"

        "content": "Normalization is a crucial step in training neural networks, particularly for image data. Here's why normalization affects model performance and why it's generally beneficial:\n\n1. **Normalization and Model Performance:**\n   - **Scale Consistency:** Neural networks perform better when the input features are on a similar scale. Pixel values in images range from 0 to 255. By normalizing the data (dividing by 255), the pixel values are scaled to a range between 0 and 1. This ensures that the model weights update more uniformly and efficiently during training.\n   - **Gradient Descent Efficiency:** Normalized inputs help gradient descent converge faster. If the input features have different ranges, the cost function can become steep and narrow in some dimensions, which makes the optimization algorithm slow and inefficient.\n   - **Avoiding Saturation:** Activation functions like sigmoid and tanh can saturate when inputs are large, leading to vanishing gradients. Although ReLU is less susceptible to this, normalized inputs still help in maintaining stable activations.\n\n2. **Training Speed vs. Accuracy:**\n   - **Training Speed:** Normalization generally speeds up the convergence of the model. This means that for a given number of epochs, a model trained with normalized data is likely to reach a better performance level than one trained without normalization.\n   - **Accuracy:** While theoretically, a model trained without normalization could eventually reach a similar accuracy given sufficient training time, it would require significantly more epochs to do so. Additionally, without normalization, the model may not converge to the optimal solution as reliably.\n\n3. **Practical Implications:**\n   - **Without Normalization:** If you omit normalization, the network may take a longer time to converge and might require more epochs to achieve the same level of accuracy. However, there is no guarantee that it will reach the same accuracy, as the optimization landscape changes.\n   - **With Normalization:** It is generally recommended to normalize input data as it leads to faster training and often better generalization, especially when the number of epochs is limited.\n\nTo summarize, normalization affects both the speed and the final accuracy of the model. It ensures that the model optimizes efficiently and effectively. Therefore, it's advisable to include normalization in your preprocessing pipeline to achieve better performance, especially when working with image data like the MNIST dataset."
