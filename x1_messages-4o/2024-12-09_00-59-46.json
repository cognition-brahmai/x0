For instance, I have a notebook running in either 'tmux' or 'screen' permanently, and I login remotely through 'ssh'. Sometimes, especially if I'm logging in after a long period, the token is requested again in order to access the notebook session. How can I retrieve this token without having to terminate and restart the notebook session with a new token?"

        "content": "To retrieve the login tokens for all running Jupyter Notebook instances without restarting them, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **SSH into your server**: First, make sure you are logged into the server where your Jupyter Notebooks are running.\n\n2. **Locate the Jupyter Notebook configuration and runtime directories**: Jupyter stores its runtime information in a specific directory. By default, this is usually located at `~/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/` on Linux systems. You can navigate to this directory using:\n   ```bash\n   cd ~/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/\n   ```\n\n3. **List the contents of the runtime directory**: Here, you'll find several JSON files, which represent the running Jupyter Notebook instances. They are typically named something like `nbserver-<pid>.json`.\n   ```bash\n   ls -l\n   ```\n\n4. **View the content of the JSON file**: Use a tool like `cat` or `less` to view the contents of the JSON file. You are looking for the token field.\n   ```bash\n   cat nbserver-<pid>.json\n   ```\n\n5. **Extract the token**: Inside the JSON file, you will find a field called `\"token\"`, which contains the token needed to access your Jupyter Notebook.\n   ```json\n   {\n       \"base_url\": \"/\",\n       \"hostname\": \"localhost\",\n       \"notebook_dir\": \"/path/to/notebooks\",\n       \"password\": false,\n       \"pid\": 12345,\n       \"port\": 8888,\n       \"secure\": false,\n       \"token\": \"your-token-here\",\n       \"url\": \"http://localhost:8888/\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n6. **Access your Jupyter Notebook**: Once you have the token, you can append it to your Jupyter Notebook URL in your web browser to access the running instance. For example:\n   ```\n   http://<your-server-ip>:<port>/?token=your-token-here\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you can retrieve the token of any running Jupyter Notebook instance without restarting it, ensuring continuous access to your sessions."
