The main.py script prints \"App started\" and continues into an infinite loop. When I start the container using the -it flag, it works as expected and I can see the output in the logs. However, when I try to run the container using the -d (detached) flag, the container seems to start normally but doesn't show any output in the logs or when I attach to the running container. The Docker version I am using is 1.5.0. Is there any difference in the way \"print\" behaves when ran in the background or any other reason for this issue?"

        "content": "When you run a Docker container in detached mode using the `-d` flag, the output from the process running inside the container isn't directly attached to your terminal. However, you should still be able to see the logs using `docker logs <container_id>`.\n\nIn Python 2.7, the standard output is buffered by default, which means that the output might not appear immediately. This could be the reason you're not seeing the expected output. When you run the container in interactive mode (`-it`), Python's standard output is unbuffered, which is why you see the output immediately.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can force Python to run in unbuffered mode by setting the `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` environment variable to `1`. You can do this in your Dockerfile or when starting the container. Here are a couple of ways to achieve this:\n\n1. **Modify the Dockerfile**: Add the following line before your `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` line:\n\n   ```dockerfile\n   ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1\n   ```\n\n2. **Set the environment variable when starting the container**: Use the `-e` flag with `docker run`:\n\n   ```sh\n   docker run -d -e PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 <your_image>\n   ```\n\nThis should ensure that the output from your Python script is immediately flushed to the logs, allowing you to see it with `docker logs`. If you've ensured that your app outputs correctly and it's still not showing, ensure that your logging configuration in Docker is set up correctly and check if there are any other issues with your script or Docker setup."
