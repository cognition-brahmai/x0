Let's consider the following formula:\nImpact on Stock Market = (Unemployment Rate Change / Initial Unemployment Rate) * (Sector Impact / Sector Contribution to GDP) * (Consumer Spending / GDP) * (Government Stimulus / GDP) * (Global Economic Trends / Domestic Economic Trends) * (Workforce Demographics / Productivity)\nUsing this formula, we can analyze the impact of the pandemic on different sectors and industries such as healthcare, technology, and retail, and forecast the potential long-term effects on the stock market. What additional economic data should we consider in order to provide a more comprehensive and nuanced analysis?"
