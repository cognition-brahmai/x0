        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find a palindrome that satisfies the following conditions:\n1. It can be expressed as the product of three distinct prime numbers.\n2. It can be expressed as the sum of three other distinct prime numbers.\n3. It can be expressed as the difference of three other distinct prime numbers.\n\nAdditionally, we need to find:\n- The total number of distinct prime factors in this palindrome.\n- The smallest prime factor of this palindrome.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Palindrome\nA palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. For this problem, we need a number that meets the criteria above.\n\n### Step 2: Prime Factorization\nWe need to find a number that is the product of three distinct primes and satisfies the other conditions. Let's start by considering small palindromes and check their prime factorizations.\n\n### Candidate Palindromes\nLet's try a few small palindromes:\n- 131: Prime (131)\n- 151: Prime (151)\n- 181: Prime (181)\n- 313: Prime (313)\n- 383: Prime (383)\n\nThese numbers are primes themselves, so they won't work as products of three distinct primes.\n\nLet's try a larger palindrome:\n- 969\n\n#### Factorization of 969:\n\\[ 969 = 3 \\times 17 \\times 19 \\]\nIt is a product of three distinct primes.\n\n### Step 3: Sum of Three Distinct Primes\nNext, we need to ensure 969 can be expressed as the sum of three distinct primes. Let's check:\n\\[ 969 = 953 + 11 + 5 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Difference of Three Distinct Primes\nFinally, ensure 969 can be expressed as the difference of three distinct primes. Let's check:\n\\[ 969 = 1171 - 197 - 5 \\]\n\n### Conclusion for 969\n- **Product of three distinct primes:** Yes, \\(3 \\times 17 \\times 19\\).\n- **Sum of three distinct primes:** Yes, \\(953 + 11 + 5\\).\n- **Difference of three distinct primes:** Yes, \\(1171 - 197 - 5\\).\n\n### Additional Information\n- **Total number of distinct prime factors:** 3 (3, 17, 19)\n- **Smallest prime factor:** 3\n\nThus, the largest palindrome fitting all these criteria is 969."
