The build runs successfully until the last line, where an exception occurs indicating 'source: not found'. I have verified the presence of the file and found that the 'source' command works in an interactive shell session. I initially thought the problem might be due to the difference between 'bash' as the Ubuntu login shell and 'dash' as the Ubuntu system shell, with 'dash' not supporting the 'source' command. However, using '.' instead of 'source' causes the Docker runtime to crash with a go panic exception. How can I successfully run a shell script from a Dockerfile RUN instruction to overcome this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the fact that the `RUN` instruction in a Dockerfile executes each command in a new shell instance, and by default, it uses `/bin/sh`, which may not support the `source` command. The `source` command is a bash builtin, and is not available in `sh` or `dash`.\n\nTo solve this issue, you can explicitly invoke `bash` in the `RUN` instruction. Here's how you can modify your Dockerfile to use `bash` for the `source` command:\n\n1. Make sure that `bash` is installed in your Docker image. If you're using an Ubuntu base image, it should already be installed, but you can ensure it by adding:\n\n    ```dockerfile\n    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y bash\n    ```\n\n2. Use `bash -c` in the `RUN` instruction to execute your script. Here's an example:\n\n    ```dockerfile\n    FROM python:3.9-slim\n\n    # Install bash\n    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y bash\n\n    # Copy your script into the image\n    COPY your_script.sh /path/to/your_script.sh\n\n    # Use bash to source the script\n    RUN bash -c \"source /path/to/your_script.sh && other_commands\"\n    ```\n\n3. If your script modifies environment variables that are needed in subsequent `RUN` commands, consider chaining commands within the same `RUN` instruction, or use Docker's `ENV` instruction to set environment variables globally.\n\nBy using `bash -c`, you ensure that the `source` command is executed in a bash shell, which should resolve the issue you're facing."
