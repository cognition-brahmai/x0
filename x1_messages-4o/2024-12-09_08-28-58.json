This constant is used in the second module (let's call it main) in an if statement like this: `if LOGGING_ACTIVATED: amqp_connector = Connector()`. In my test class for the main module, I want to patch this constant with the value `True`. However, using `@patch(\"config.LOGGING_ACTIVATED\", True)` or `@patch.object(\"config.LOGGING_ACTIVATED\", True)` does not seem to work. How can I patch a constant from different modules?"

        "content": "To patch a constant in Python, especially when dealing with different modules, you need to ensure that you're patching the constant in the correct namespace. The issue with `@patch(\"config.LOGGING_ACTIVATED\", True)` not working is likely because the `LOGGING_ACTIVATED` constant is being imported into the main module, and you're attempting to patch it in the `config` module's namespace instead.\n\nHere's how you can correctly patch the constant:\n\n1. **Identify where the constant is imported in the main module.** If you're importing it directly, like `from config import LOGGING_ACTIVATED`, then you need to patch it in the namespace of the main module.\n\n2. **Use the correct import path for patching.** You should patch the constant in the namespace where it is used, not where it is defined.\n\nFor example, if your main module is named `main.py` and you have:\n\n```python\n# main.py\nfrom config import LOGGING_ACTIVATED\n\nif LOGGING_ACTIVATED:\n    amqp_connector = Connector()\n```\n\nYou should patch it like this in your test:\n\n```python\nfrom unittest import TestCase\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nclass TestMain(TestCase):\n    @patch('main.LOGGING_ACTIVATED', True)\n    def test_logging_activated(self):\n        # Your test code here\n        # Since LOGGING_ACTIVATED is patched to True, the condition should pass\n        pass\n```\n\nIn this example, `@patch('main.LOGGING_ACTIVATED', True)` ensures that you're patching `LOGGING_ACTIVATED` in the namespace where it's actually used, which is `main`, not `config`.\n\nIf your `main.py` imports the entire `config` module (e.g., `import config`), then you would patch it like this:\n\n```python\n@patch('main.config.LOGGING_ACTIVATED', True)\n```\n\nRemember, the key is to patch the constant in the namespace where it is being used within your code."
