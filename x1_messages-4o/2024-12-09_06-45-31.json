        "content": "I am experiencing an unusual behavior with my Python code. I am currently using Python 2.6.6 on Windows 7. The issue is with the Try-Except-Else-Finally behavior with Return statements. I have two functions, demo1 and demo2, that contain these statements. Here are the functions:\n\n```python\ndef demo1():\n    try:\n        raise RuntimeError,\"To Force Issue\"\n    except:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 2\n    finally:\n        return 3\n\ndef demo2():\n    try:\n        try:\n            raise RuntimeError,\"To Force Issue\"\n        except:\n            return 1\n        else:\n            return 2\n        finally:\n            return 3\n    except:\n        print 4\n    else:\n        print 5\n    finally:\n        print 6\n```\nWhen I execute them as follows:\n\n```python\nprint demo1()\nprint demo2()\n```\nThe results are:\n\n```python\n3\n6\n3\n```\nI have two questions:\n1. Why is demo1 returning 3 instead of 1?\n2. Why is demo2 printing 6 instead of printing 6 along with 4 or 5?"

        "content": "The behavior you're encountering is due to how Python handles `try-except-else-finally` blocks, particularly when `return` statements are involved.\n\n### 1. Why is `demo1` returning 3 instead of 1?\n\nIn Python, the `finally` block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. If there's a `return` statement in the `finally` block, it will override any previous `return` statements in the `try` or `except` blocks.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens in `demo1`:\n\n- The `try` block raises a `RuntimeError`, so the control moves to the `except` block.\n- The `except` block contains a `return 1`, but before this value can be returned, the `finally` block is executed.\n- The `finally` block has a `return 3`, which overrides the `return 1` from the `except` block.\n- Thus, `demo1` returns 3.\n\n### 2. Why is `demo2` printing 6 instead of printing 6 along with 4 or 5?\n\nFor `demo2`, a similar principle applies:\n\n- In the inner `try` block, a `RuntimeError` is raised, moving execution to the inner `except` block.\n- The inner `except` block contains `return 1`, but before returning, the inner `finally` block is executed, containing `return 3`. This overrides the `return 1`.\n- The inner `finally` block executes, returning 3, which exits the inner `try-except-finally` block, effectively ending the function as well.\n- The outer `finally` block executes and prints 6, but the outer `except` and `else` blocks are not executed since the function has already returned from the inner `finally`.\n\nTherefore, `demo2` prints 6 due to the outer `finally` block executing, and the return value of the function is determined by the inner `finally` block's `return 3`, which is not printed because it is not used in a print statement."
