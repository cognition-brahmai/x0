One such error message I received after running a program named \"MatrixMul\". I have installed both x32 and x64 NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit v5.0 on my Window7x64 OS. The error message states \"Cannot find or open the PDB file\". How can I fix this error?\n\nError message: \n\n'matrixMul.exe': Loaded 'C:\\ProgramData\\NVIDIA Corporation\\CUDA Samples\\v5.0\\bin\\win32\\Debug\\matrixMul.exe', Symbols loaded.\n'matrixMul.exe': Loaded 'C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\ntdll.dll', Cannot find or open the PDB file\n'matrixMul.exe': Loaded 'C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\kernel32.dll', Cannot find or open the PDB file\n...

        "content": "The error message you're encountering, \"Cannot find or open the PDB file,\" is related to debugging symbols that are not available for the libraries your program is using. This is not necessarily an error that affects the execution of your program, but rather a notification that debugging information (symbol files) is not available for the system libraries or some components.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can address this issue:\n\n1. **Ignore if Unnecessary**: If your program is running correctly and you do not need to step into the system libraries for debugging purposes, you can ignore this message. The absence of PDB files does not impact the execution of your compiled program unless you need detailed debugging information.\n\n2. **Install Debugging Tools**: If you require detailed debugging information, you can install the Windows Debugging Tools, which may provide more detailed symbols for system libraries. You can do this by installing the Windows SDK, which includes debugging tools and symbols.\n\n3. **Configure Symbol Servers**: In Visual Studio or your preferred IDE, you can configure the debugger to download symbols from Microsoft\u2019s symbol servers. This can be done by accessing the Options menu in Visual Studio:\n   - Go to `Tools` -> `Options`.\n   - Navigate to `Debugging` -> `Symbols`.\n   - Check the box for \u201cMicrosoft Symbol Servers\u201d.\n\n4. **Check Your Build Configuration**: Ensure that you are building the project in the correct configuration (e.g., Debug or Release) and that the corresponding PDB files are being generated for your application.\n\n5. **Update CUDA Samples**: Make sure you are using the latest CUDA Samples that are compatible with your installed CUDA Toolkit version. Sometimes, samples might have been updated for better compatibility.\n\n6. **Reinstall CUDA Toolkit**: If the problem persists and is affecting functionality, consider reinstalling the CUDA Toolkit to ensure that all necessary components and configurations are correctly set up.\n\nRemember, the key here is whether you need to debug into these libraries or not. If you don't need to, these messages can generally be ignored. If debugging is needed, setting up symbol servers as described above will usually resolve the issue."
