        "content": "The error message you're encountering, `RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'mtest.get_ticks' was never awaited`, typically occurs when you define an asynchronous function (coroutine) but do not properly await its execution. In Python, asynchronous functions must be awaited to execute them. Here's a breakdown of how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure the Function is Awaited**: When you call an asynchronous function, you need to use the `await` keyword to wait for the completion of the coroutine. This means the calling function itself must also be asynchronous.\n\n2. **Example Code Structure**:\n   - Suppose you have the following asynchronous method in your class:\n\n     ```python\n     # In your separate file\n     import asyncio\n\n     class MyClass:\n         async def get_ticks(self):\n             # Simulate an async operation with await\n             await asyncio.sleep(1)\n             return \"Ticks data\"\n     ```\n\n   - When you import and use this class in your main file, ensure you await the method:\n\n     ```python\n     # In your main file\n     import asyncio\n     from your_module import MyClass\n\n     async def main():\n         mtest = MyClass()\n         ticks = await mtest.get_ticks()\n         print(ticks)\n\n     # Run the main function in the event loop\n     if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n         asyncio.run(main())\n     ```\n\n3. **Running the Event Loop**: The `asyncio.run(main())` function is used to run the asynchronous `main` function within an event loop. This is necessary because asynchronous functions need an event loop to execute.\n\n4. **Handling Asynchronous Context**: If you try to call `await mtest.get_ticks()` outside of an asynchronous context, you will face syntax errors. Ensure that all calls to asynchronous methods are within an async function.\n\nIf you follow these steps, you should be able to resolve the `RuntimeWarning` and properly execute your asynchronous code. If you have specific constraints or further questions, feel free to provide additional details."
