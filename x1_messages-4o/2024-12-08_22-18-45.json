        "content": "Can you generate a 10-second jingle by utilizing XML data and PHP programming, with an added complexity? Instead of using the conventional note sequence, let's modify the pitch and duration of each note using a series of puzzles. You must solve the following puzzles to determine the pitch and duration for each note in the jingle. Use the given example XML data and PHP code to play the resulting jingle. \n1. Solve a math problem: 2+2=?\n2. Play a note with a pitch of \"C\" and a duration of 0.5 seconds.\n3. Determine the next number in the sequence: 1, 3, 5, 7, __?\n4. Play a note with a pitch of \"D\" and a duration of 0.5 seconds.\n5. Find a five-letter word meaning \"to make small cuts.\"\n6. Play a note with a pitch of \"E\" and a duration of 0.5 seconds.\n7. Solve a math problem: 5x5=?\n8. Play a note with a pitch of \"C\" and a duration of 0.5 seconds.\n9. Find a four-letter word meaning \"opposite of short.\"\n10. Play a note with a pitch of \"E\" and a duration of 0.5 seconds.\n11. Solve a math problem: 9-3=?\n12. Play a note with a pitch of \"D\" and a duration of 0.5 seconds.\n13. Determine the next letter in the sequence: A, E, I, __?\n14. Play a note with a pitch of \"C\" and a duration of 0.5 seconds.\nGood luck with solving all the puzzles to generate the final jingle!"
