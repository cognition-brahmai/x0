I frequently toggle between insert and overwrite mode while editing, but sometimes I get stuck in overwrite mode and I'm unable to revert back. Despite checking the list of shortcuts in Jupyter and online, I haven't been able to find a solution. Could you tell me what the Jupyter shortcut key is to toggle between insert and overwrite mode?"

        "content": "In Jupyter Notebook, there isn't a dedicated keyboard shortcut to toggle between insert and overwrite modes directly, as you might find in some text editors or IDEs. The behavior you're experiencing might be related to the terminal or the text editor widget rather than Jupyter itself.\n\nHowever, if you find yourself stuck in overwrite mode, a common way to handle this in many environments is to use the `Insert` key on your keyboard. Pressing `Insert` usually toggles between insert and overwrite modes. Unfortunately, some keyboards, particularly on laptops, might not have a dedicated `Insert` key, or it might be accessed through a function key, like `Fn + Enter` or another key combination.\n\nIf your keyboard doesn't have an `Insert` key or if it doesn't seem to work, you might try these alternative steps:\n\n1. **Check Your Keyboard Layout**: Ensure that your keyboard layout settings in your virtual machine are correctly configured to match your physical keyboard.\n\n2. **Virtual Keyboards**: Use an on-screen keyboard to press the `Insert` key if your physical keyboard doesn\u2019t have one.\n\n3. **Update/Restart Jupyter**: Sometimes, simply saving your work and restarting the Jupyter Notebook can solve unexpected behavior.\n\n4. **External Text Editor**: If the issue is persistent, consider editing critical code in an external text editor and pasting it back into Jupyter.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, it might be worth checking for any Jupyter extensions or browser plugins that could be interfering with keyboard input and addressing any specific VM or browser configuration settings that might affect input handling."
