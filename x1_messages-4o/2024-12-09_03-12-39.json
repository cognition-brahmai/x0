However, when dealing with string continuation - especially when the code is indented in several blocks - it gets tricky. For example, trying to use a multiline string like this:\n\n```python\nmystr = \"\"\"Why, hello there\nwonderful stackoverflow people!\"\"\"\n```\n\nReturns the following:\n\n```python\n\"Why, hello there\\nwonderful stackoverflow people!\"\n```\n\nTo avoid the newline, I tried the following:\n\n```python\nmystr = \"Why, hello there \\\nwonderful stackoverflow people!\"\n```\n\nThis works but looks weird when the statement is indented. Attempting to indent the second line results in unnecessary spaces in the string. The only solution I've found is this:\n\n```python\nmystr = \"Why, hello there\" \\\n\"wonderful stackoverflow people!\"\n```\n\nBut it looks like there's a string in the middle of nowhere. What are some recommendations on how to do this and is there something I'm missing in the style guide that shows how this should be done?"

        "content": "When handling long strings in Python while adhering to style guidelines, there are a few approaches you can consider. Let's go through some of the options:\n\n1. **Implicit String Concatenation**: As you've already discovered, you can place two string literals next to each other without any operators, and Python will concatenate them. This is often the cleanest approach:\n\n    ```python\n    mystr = (\"Why, hello there \"\n             \"wonderful stackoverflow people!\")\n    ```\n\n    This method allows you to split the string across multiple lines, and the parentheses help in maintaining readability without any additional backslashes.\n\n2. **Using Triple-Quoted Strings**: If the primary concern is dealing with indentation and preserving formatting, you can use triple-quoted strings, but you'll need to handle the newlines explicitly:\n\n    ```python\n    mystr = \"\"\"Why, hello there \\\n    wonderful stackoverflow people!\"\"\"\n    ```\n\n    However, be mindful of the indentation in triple-quoted strings, as it will be preserved unless you use backslashes or string manipulation to remove it.\n\n3. **Using `textwrap.dedent()`**: If you prefer to use triple-quoted strings but want to strip the indentation, you can use the `textwrap.dedent()` function from the `textwrap` module:\n\n    ```python\n    import textwrap\n\n    mystr = textwrap.dedent(\"\"\"\\\n        Why, hello there\n        wonderful stackoverflow people!\"\"\")\n    ```\n\n    This approach allows for more readable code blocks, especially when dealing with longer texts.\n\n4. **Joining Strings**: Another approach is to use a list of strings and join them:\n\n    ```python\n    mystr = \"\".join([\n        \"Why, hello there \",\n        \"wonderful stackoverflow people!\"\n    ])\n    ```\n\n    This method can be particularly useful if you have a dynamically generated list of strings to concatenate.\n\nEach of these methods has its own advantages depending on your specific use case. The implicit concatenation with parentheses is often the most aesthetically pleasing and aligns well with Python's PEP 8 style guide. Choose the method that best balances readability and adherence to style guidelines for your particular project."
