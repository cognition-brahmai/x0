        "content": "To solve this problem, you can use the `collections` module in Python, which provides a `Counter` class that will help in counting the frequency of words in the sentence. Here's a function that performs the task:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport re\n\ndef most_frequent_words(sentence):\n    # Convert the sentence to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity\n    sentence = sentence.lower()\n    \n    # Remove punctuation using regular expressions\n    sentence = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', sentence)\n    \n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each word\n    word_count = Counter(words)\n    \n    # Get the three most common words\n    most_common_words = word_count.most_common(3)\n    \n    # Extract only the words from the most common word tuples\n    result = [word for word, count in most_common_words]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nsentence = \"The cat sat on the mat and licked its paw.\"\nprint(most_frequent_words(sentence))  # Output: ['the', 'cat', 'sat']\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Lowercasing**: The sentence is converted to lowercase to ensure that the function is case-insensitive.\n- **Removing Punctuation**: Regular expressions are used to remove punctuation marks from the sentence.\n- **Splitting**: The sentence is split into individual words.\n- **Counting**: The `Counter` class from the `collections` module counts the frequency of each word.\n- **Most Common Words**: The `most_common` method is used to extract the three words with the highest frequency.\n- **Output**: A list of the top three words is returned.\n\nThis function should work correctly for the example sentence provided."
