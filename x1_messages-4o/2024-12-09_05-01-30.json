        "content": "Yes, Ruby has an interactive shell called IRB (Interactive Ruby), which is quite similar to iPython. You can use IRB to experiment with Ruby code in real-time. To start IRB, you simply need to open your terminal and type:\n\n```bash\nirb\n```\n\nThis will give you an interactive Ruby shell where you can test out Ruby code snippets and see results instantly. \n\nFor Rails, you can use the Rails console, which provides an IRB session within the context of your Rails application. To start the Rails console, navigate to your Rails application's root directory in your terminal and run:\n\n```bash\nrails console\n```\n\nThis will load your Rails environment and allow you to interact with your application models and other components directly.\n\nRegarding the feature for introspection, you can enhance the IRB experience by using the `pry` gem. Pry is a powerful alternative to the standard IRB shell and offers additional features such as syntax highlighting, command history, and a powerful TAB completion system that can show you available methods and variables, which is similar to the introspection feature you mentioned.\n\nTo use Pry, first install it by adding it to your Gemfile or installing it directly via:\n\n```bash\ngem install pry\n```\n\nThen, you can start Pry by simply typing:\n\n```bash\npry\n```\n\nOr, if you want to use it within the context of a Rails application:\n\n```bash\nrails console\n```\n\nAnd then, within the console, require Pry:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'pry'\n```\n\nNow you have a powerful interactive shell with introspection capabilities that can help you learn Ruby, Rails, and libraries like Mechanize more effectively."
