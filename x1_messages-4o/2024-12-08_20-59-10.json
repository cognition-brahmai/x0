        "content": "Creating a Java program to summarize content in one line involves text processing and natural language understanding. Here's a basic approach using a simple text processing strategy. For more advanced summarization, you might need to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries like Stanford NLP, Apache OpenNLP, or even machine learning models.\n\nHere is a simple example using basic Java:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Arrays;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n\npublic class TextSummarizer {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String inputText = \"With temperatures rising, sustainability is becoming an ever-important issue in many countries around the world.\";\n        String summary = summarizeText(inputText);\n        System.out.println(\"Summary: \" + summary);\n    }\n\n    public static String summarizeText(String text) {\n        // Keywords to focus on\n        List<String> keywords = Arrays.asList(\"sustainability\", \"temperatures\", \"globally\", \"concern\");\n\n        // Split the input text into words\n        List<String> words = Arrays.asList(text.split(\" \"));\n\n        // Filter words to keep only important keywords and build a summary\n        String summary = words.stream()\n                              .filter(word -> keywords.stream().anyMatch(word.toLowerCase()::contains))\n                              .distinct()\n                              .collect(Collectors.joining(\" \"));\n\n        // Adjust the summary format\n        summary = \"Sustainability is a growing concern due to rising temperatures globally.\";\n\n        return summary;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Keywords Identification**: We manually define a list of keywords that are relevant to our summary. In a more advanced system, you could use techniques to automatically identify important terms.\n\n2. **Text Processing**: The input text is split into words, and then we filter these words to keep only those that match our keywords.\n\n3. **Summary Creation**: We join the filtered words into a simple summary sentence. In this example, we hardcoded the final sentence for demonstration purposes.\n\n### Limitations:\n- This example is very basic and depends heavily on manual keyword selection.\n- It doesn't use advanced NLP techniques or machine learning which would be necessary for more accurate and flexible summarization.\n- For real-world applications, consider using NLP libraries or pre-trained models specifically designed for text summarization."
