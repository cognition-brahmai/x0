        "content": "Your SQL query is essentially correct for merging two tables based on a common column and keeping only the rows with matching values. However, the `WHERE` clause with the `IN` condition is redundant in this case because the `INNER JOIN` operation itself ensures that only rows with matching values in the \"ID\" column are retained. Therefore, you can simplify your query by removing the `WHERE` clause. Here is the refined version of your query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM table1\nINNER JOIN table2\nON table1.ID = table2.ID;\n```\n\nThis query will return all columns from both `table1` and `table2` for each pair of rows where the \"ID\" column matches in both tables. If you want to select specific columns from each table, you can replace the `*` with the column names you are interested in."
