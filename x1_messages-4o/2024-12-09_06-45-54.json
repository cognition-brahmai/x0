        "content": "Certainly! Unzipping a file using Python is quite straightforward with the `zipfile` module. Here's how you can unzip all the contents of a zip file into the same directory:\n\n```python\nimport zipfile\nimport os\n\ndef unzip_file(zip_file_path, extract_to=None):\n    # If no extract directory is provided, use the directory of the zip file\n    if extract_to is None:\n        extract_to = os.path.dirname(zip_file_path)\n\n    # Open the zip file in read mode\n    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file_path, 'r') as zip_ref:\n        # Extract all the contents into the specified directory\n        zip_ref.extractall(extract_to)\n\n# Example usage\nzip_file_path = 'path/to/your/file.zip'\nunzip_file(zip_file_path)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. **Import the zipfile and os modules**: These are necessary for handling zip files and file system paths.\n\n2. **Define the `unzip_file` function**: This function takes two arguments, the path to the zip file (`zip_file_path`) and an optional extraction directory (`extract_to`). If no extraction directory is specified, it defaults to the directory where the zip file is located.\n\n3. **Open the zip file**: Using `zipfile.ZipFile`, open the zip file in read mode.\n\n4. **Extract all contents**: Use the `extractall()` method to extract all files and directories from the zip file to the specified extraction directory.\n\n5. **Example usage**: Replace `'path/to/your/file.zip'` with the actual path to your zip file when calling `unzip_file`.\n\nThis code will unzip all contents of the specified zip file into the same directory as the zip file unless you specify a different directory by providing the `extract_to` argument."
