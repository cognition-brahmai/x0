Given your sample data, we need to adjust the query to capture a broader range of motivational phrases. Here\u2019s a revised SQL query that attempts to match phrases related to overcoming obstacles and perseverance:\n\n```sql\nSELECT feedback_text, COUNT(*) as frequency \nFROM feedback\nWHERE feedback_text LIKE '%never give up%' \n   OR feedback_text LIKE '%going gets tough%' \n   OR feedback_text LIKE '%Perseverance%' \n   OR feedback_text LIKE '%Obstacles are opportunities%' \n   OR feedback_text LIKE '%believe in myself%' \n   OR feedback_text LIKE '%unstoppable%' \nGROUP BY feedback_text\nORDER BY frequency DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\nThis query targets specific phrases that are likely to be used in the context of overcoming obstacles and persevering. You can modify the `WHERE` clause to include other phrases or patterns that may be found in your feedback data related to this theme. If you have a more comprehensive list of relevant phrases, you can expand the `WHERE` clause accordingly."
