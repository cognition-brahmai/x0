        "content": "To arrange the key features in the table \"Declaration\" based on the clues provided, we need to identify the logical sequence of these features. The sequence is typically structured as follows for a historical declaration like the U.S. Declaration of Independence:\n\n1. **Feature D**: Outlining the basic rights of all human beings, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This sets the philosophical foundation for the rest of the document.\n2. **Feature E**: Providing a comprehensive list of natural rights, including the right to life, liberty, and property.\n3. **Feature C**: Enumerating the colonists' complaints against King George III and the British government. This justifies the need for independence by listing grievances.\n4. **Feature A**: Containing the declaration of the colonies as free and independent states, and the right to form alliances with foreign countries. This is the formal declaration of independence.\n5. **Feature B**: An act of bravery and defiance, as it is signed by the colonists. This signifies the commitment and risk taken by the signatories.\n\nBased on this logical order, here is the SQL query to reorder the features in the \"Declaration\" table:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE Declaration\nSET feature_order = CASE\n    WHEN feature_name = 'Feature D' THEN 1\n    WHEN feature_name = 'Feature E' THEN 2\n    WHEN feature_name = 'Feature C' THEN 3\n    WHEN feature_name = 'Feature A' THEN 4\n    WHEN feature_name = 'Feature B' THEN 5\nEND;\n\nSELECT * FROM Declaration\nORDER BY feature_order;\n```\n\nThis query updates the table to store an order for each feature and then selects all entries in the defined order."
