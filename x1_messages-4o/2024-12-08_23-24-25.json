Your task is to display the text \"Greetings\" in blue color and with a font size that is equal to the sum of the smallest and largest numbers in the table below, but only counting the numbers that are divisible by 3:\n|  3  |  7  |  8  |\n|  2  |  9  |  4  |\n|  5  |  1  |  6  |\nHint: Start by identifying the numbers that are divisible by 3, then find the smallest and largest ones and add them together to determine the font size."

Then, we find the smallest and largest of these numbers and add them together to determine the font size. Finally, we modify the given LaTeX code to display the text \"Greetings\" in blue with the calculated font size.\n\n### Step 1: Identify numbers divisible by 3\n\nThe table is:\n```\n|  3  |  7  |  8  |\n|  2  |  9  |  4  |\n|  5  |  1  |  6  |\n```\n\nNumbers divisible by 3 are: 3, 9, and 6.\n\n### Step 2: Find the smallest and largest numbers\n\n- Smallest number: 3\n- Largest number: 9\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the font size\n\nAdd the smallest and largest numbers: \\(3 + 9 = 12\\).\n\n### Step 4: Modify the LaTeX code\n\nUsing the calculated font size of 12 and setting the text color to blue, the LaTeX code will look like this:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{xcolor}\n\\usepackage{graphicx}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n% Set the font size to 12 and color to blue\n{\\fontsize{12}{14.4}\\selectfont \\textcolor{blue}{Greetings}}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nThis LaTeX code will display the text \"Greetings\" in blue with a font size of 12."
