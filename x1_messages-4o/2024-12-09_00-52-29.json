        "content": "Your current implementation of the Fibonacci sequence in a one-liner is clever, but it can indeed be simplified and made more Pythonic. Here's a more concise and Pythonic one-liner using `functools.reduce`:\n\n```python\nfrom functools import reduce\n\nfib = lambda n: reduce(lambda x, _: (x[1], x[0] + x[1]), range(n-1), (0, 1))[0]\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. **`reduce` function:** It takes a lambda function and an iterable, and applies the lambda function cumulatively to the items of the iterable.\n\n2. **Lambda function:** It updates the tuple `(x[1], x[0] + x[1])`, which effectively shifts the Fibonacci series forward by one step.\n\n3. **`range(n-1)`:** This generates a sequence of numbers from `0` to `n-2`, which determines how many times the lambda function should be applied.\n\n4. **Initial value `(0, 1)`:** This tuple represents the first two Fibonacci numbers, `0` and `1`.\n\n5. **Output `[0]`:** Finally, it extracts the first element of the tuple, which is the nth Fibonacci number.\n\nThis version is more readable and concise while still achieving the desired result. You can call it like this:\n\n```python\nprint(fib(8))  # Output: 13\n```\n\nThis way, it computes the nth Fibonacci number in a more Pythonic manner."
