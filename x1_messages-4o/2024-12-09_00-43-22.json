I want to exclude the `tests` directory from the distribution and include the LICENSE, README.md, RELEASE files either at the top level or inside the package1 directory. However, the `tests` directory remains in the created tar archive and gets installed to the site-packages and the files are copied to the archive but do not get installed to the site-packages directory of the package. Can you please help me solve these issues?"

        "content": "Certainly! It looks like you're dealing with a couple of issues related to packaging your Python project using setuptools. Let's address them one by one:\n\n### Excluding the `tests` Directory\n\nTo exclude the `tests` directory from your distribution, you are already using the `exclude=['tests']` option in `find_packages()`, which should work correctly. However, you might want to make sure that the `tests` directory is not being accidentally included due to other settings or commands.\n\nEnsure that your directory structure is correctly set up and that `find_packages()` is being used properly. You can try explicitly specifying the packages to include, although `exclude` should suffice.\n\n### Including LICENSE, README.md, and RELEASE Files\n\nTo include files like `LICENSE`, `README.md`, and `RELEASE` in your package, you should ensure that your `MANIFEST.in` is correct. Your `MANIFEST.in` looks good, but you might want to ensure its syntax is correct and matches the actual file names.\n\n**Setup Configuration:**\n\nHere's an updated version of your `setup.py` and some additional checks you can perform:\n\n1. **setup.py:**\n\n   Update your `setup.py` to ensure it correctly handles metadata and package data:\n\n   ```python\n   from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\n   setup(\n       name='package1',\n       version='1.1',\n       packages=find_packages(exclude=['tests']),\n       include_package_data=True,\n       package_data={\n           'package1': ['LICENSE', 'README.md', 'RELEASE'],\n       },\n       data_files=[('', ['LICENSE', 'README.md', 'RELEASE'])],\n       test_suite='tests',\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **MANIFEST.in:**\n\n   Ensure your `MANIFEST.in` is correctly named and located at the top level of your project directory:\n\n   ```\n   include LICENSE\n   include README.md\n   include RELEASE\n   ```\n\n### Additional Steps and Checks\n\n1. **Clear Previous Builds:**\n\n   Before building the distribution, clear any previous builds that might be causing issues:\n\n   ```bash\n   python setup.py clean --all\n   ```\n\n2. **Build the Package:**\n\n   Use the following command to create the source distribution:\n\n   ```bash\n   python setup.py sdist\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify the Contents:**\n\n   After building the distribution, inspect the `.tar.gz` file to ensure that the `tests` directory is excluded and the other files are included. You can extract the archive to check its contents.\n\n4. **Installation Check:**\n\n   After installing the package using `pip install .`, verify that the `LICENSE`, `README.md`, and `RELEASE` files are included in the site-packages directory. These should be included if specified correctly in `data_files`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issues you're facing with your setuptools configuration. If problems persist, double-check for any typos or path issues in your configuration files."
