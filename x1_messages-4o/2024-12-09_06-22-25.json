For example, I am using the following code:\n\n```python\nimport torch, seaborn as sns\n\nx = torch.distributions.Normal(torch.tensor([0.0]), torch.tensor([1.0]))\n```\nI am using `sns.distplot(x.sample((100000,)))` and `sns.distplot(x.rsample((100000,)))` to plot the distribution of the samples and the results appear similar. In what scenarios should I use `sample()` and when should I use `rsample()`?"

        "content": "In PyTorch, the `sample()` and `rsample()` methods are used to draw samples from a probability distribution, but they serve slightly different purposes, especially when it comes to differentiability and stochastic gradient estimations.\n\n### `sample()`\n\n- **Purpose**: The `sample()` method generates samples from the distribution in a standard way. It uses the underlying random number generator to produce samples that are not differentiable. This means that the samples are generated independently of any computational graph, and gradients cannot be backpropagated through the sampling process.\n\n- **Use Case**: Use `sample()` when you do not need to perform gradient-based optimization with respect to the samples. It's suitable for scenarios where you are interested in just obtaining samples from the distribution without any need for further gradient computations.\n\n### `rsample()`\n\n- **Purpose**: The `rsample()` method is used to generate samples in a way that maintains differentiability. It employs the \"reparameterization trick,\" which allows the gradients to flow through the sampling process. This is accomplished by expressing the samples as deterministic functions of some parameters plus randomness, typically through a transformation of a base random variable.\n\n- **Use Case**: Use `rsample()` when you need to perform gradient-based optimization on samples, such as in variational inference methods like the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). By using `rsample()`, you can backpropagate through the sampling process which is crucial for learning in models that rely on stochastic sampling in their architecture.\n\n### Why They Appear Similar\n\nThe distributions of the samples generated by both `sample()` and `rsample()` can appear similar because they are both drawn from the same underlying probability distribution. The difference lies in whether or not the sampling process supports gradient flow. If you're merely interested in the statistical properties of the distribution and not involved in an optimization process that requires backpropagation, either method will suffice. However, for models that require learning from samples, `rsample()` is the appropriate choice due to its differentiability property."
