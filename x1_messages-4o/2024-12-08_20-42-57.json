        "content": "A major U.S. city located in the Southwest region that fits your criteria is Austin, Texas. Austin has a population over one million, a median household income above $60,000, and is renowned for its booming tech industry.\n\n### Top Five Employers in Austin, Texas\n\n| Employer              | Industry         |\n|-----------------------|------------------|\n| Dell Technologies     | Technology       |\n| Apple Inc.            | Technology       |\n| IBM                   | Technology       |\n| Samsung Austin Semiconductor | Semiconductor |\n| University of Texas at Austin | Education      |\n\n### Code Snippet for Calculating Unemployment Rate\n\nHere's a simple Python program to calculate the unemployment rate given the employed and unemployed population data:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_unemployment_rate(employed, unemployed):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the unemployment rate.\n\n    :param employed: Number of employed individuals\n    :param unemployed: Number of unemployed individuals\n    :return: Unemployment rate as a percentage\n    \"\"\"\n    total_labor_force = employed + unemployed\n    if total_labor_force == 0:\n        return 0  # To handle division by zero if no labor force data is available\n    unemployment_rate = (unemployed / total_labor_force) * 100\n    return unemployment_rate\n\n# Example usage with hypothetical data\nemployed_population = 1000000  # Example number of employed individuals\nunemployed_population = 50000  # Example number of unemployed individuals\n\nunemployment_rate = calculate_unemployment_rate(employed_population, unemployed_population)\nprint(f\"The unemployment rate is {unemployment_rate:.2f}%\")\n```\n\nThis code snippet calculates the unemployment rate by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by the total labor force (sum of employed and unemployed individuals) and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. You can replace the example values with the latest data to get the current unemployment rate."
