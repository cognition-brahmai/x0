        "content": "To calculate the sum of all elements in a Binary Search Tree (BST), you can perform a tree traversal and accumulate the values of the nodes. A simple and effective approach is to use a recursive in-order traversal, but you can also use pre-order or post-order traversals. Here's a step-by-step guide using an in-order traversal, which processes nodes in a sorted order for BSTs:\n\n### Algorithm Steps\n\n1. **Define the Node Structure:**\n   Ensure that the tree nodes have a structure with a value and pointers to left and right children.\n\n2. **Recursive Function:**\n   Implement a recursive function that traverses the tree and adds the values.\n\n3. **Base Condition:**\n   If the current node is `null`, return 0, as there are no values to add from a null subtree.\n\n4. **Recursive Case:**\n   The sum for a node is the value of the node plus the sum of the left subtree and the sum of the right subtree.\n\n### Implementation\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the algorithm:\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):\n        self.value = value\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\ndef sum_of_bst(root):\n    if root is None:\n        return 0\n    return root.value + sum_of_bst(root.left) + sum_of_bst(root.right)\n\n# Example usage:\n# Construct a simple BST\n#       5\n#      / \\\n#     3   8\n#    / \\   \\\n#   1   4   10\n\nroot = TreeNode(5)\nroot.left = TreeNode(3, TreeNode(1), TreeNode(4))\nroot.right = TreeNode(8, None, TreeNode(10))\n\n# Calculate the sum of all elements\ntotal_sum = sum_of_bst(root)\nprint(\"The sum of all elements in the BST is:\", total_sum)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **TreeNode Class:** Defines the structure of a node in the BST with a value, and pointers to left and right children.\n- **sum_of_bst Function:** Recursively calculates the sum of all node values in the BST.\n- **Example Usage:** Constructs a sample BST and calculates the sum of its elements.\n\nThis algorithm efficiently computes the sum in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of nodes in the BST, since it visits each node exactly once."
