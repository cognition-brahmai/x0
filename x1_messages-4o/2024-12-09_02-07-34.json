        "content": "Yes, there is a more efficient way to count the number of times each character is repeated in a string without manually comparing each character. You can use Python's `collections` module, specifically the `Counter` class, which makes this task straightforward. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Example string\ninput_string = \"example string with repeated characters\"\n\n# Create a Counter object to count the occurrences of each character\nchar_count = Counter(input_string)\n\n# Print the count of each character\nfor char, count in char_count.items():\n    print(f\"Character: '{char}' - Count: {count}\")\n```\n\nThe `Counter` class automatically creates a dictionary where keys are characters from the string and values are their respective counts. This code will work for any string and handle all characters, not just A-Z. It's concise and eliminates the need to write repetitive code for each character."
