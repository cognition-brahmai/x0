For example, in this case, the longest sublist is [1,2,3] with a length of 3. I tried using `len(max(L))` to achieve this but it did not work as expected. Is there a way to achieve this without having to loop through each sublist?"

        "content": "The expression `len(max(L))` doesn't work as expected because `max()` will return the sublist that is considered the largest based on lexicographical order, not the longest sublist in terms of length.\n\nTo find the length of the longest sublist without explicitly using a loop, you can use the `max()` function combined with a generator expression that calculates the lengths of the sublists. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nL = [[1, 2, 3], [5, 7], [1, 3], [77]]\n\n# Use max with a key argument to find the longest sublist\nlongest_length = max(len(sublist) for sublist in L)\n\nprint(longest_length)\n```\n\nIn this code, `max()` is used with a generator expression `len(sublist) for sublist in L`, which iterates over each sublist in `L` and calculates its length. The `max()` function then finds the maximum length from these calculated lengths. This approach avoids explicitly writing a loop but still effectively evaluates the length of each sublist."
