However, even when the images are the same, the console is not printing \"photos profile are identical\". The code I am using is:\n\n```python\npath_photo_quora= \"/home/yousuf/Desktop/quora_photo.jpg\"\npath_photo_twitter=\"/home/yuf/Desktop/twitter_photo.jpeg\"\nif open(path_photo_quora,\"rb\").read() == open(path_photo_twitter,\"rb\").read():\n    print('photos profile are identical')\n```\n\nDespite the images being the same, I am not getting the expected output. How can I modify this code to correctly identify when two images are identical?"

        "content": "When you're comparing images by reading their binary data directly as in your script, even a small difference in file format, compression, or metadata can result in different binary representations, even if the visible content is identical. To ensure you accurately compare the visible content of the images, you should use an image processing library that allows you to compare the images at the pixel level. Here's how you can do that using the Python Imaging Library (PIL), specifically the `Pillow` package:\n\nFirst, you need to install the Pillow library if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install Pillow\n```\n\nThen, you can use the following script to compare the images:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageChops\n\ndef are_images_identical(path1, path2):\n    image1 = Image.open(path1)\n    image2 = Image.open(path2)\n\n    # Check if sizes are identical; if not, images are different\n    if image1.size != image2.size:\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the images have the same mode (e.g., RGB, RGBA)\n    if image1.mode != image2.mode:\n        return False\n\n    # Use ImageChops to find differences\n    diff = ImageChops.difference(image1, image2)\n\n    # If there are no differences, the images are identical\n    return not diff.getbbox()\n\npath_photo_quora = \"/home/yousuf/Desktop/quora_photo.jpg\"\npath_photo_twitter = \"/home/yousuf/Desktop/twitter_photo.jpeg\"\n\nif are_images_identical(path_photo_quora, path_photo_twitter):\n    print('photos profile are identical')\nelse:\n    print('photos profile are not identical')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Image Size and Mode Check**: First, it checks if the images have the same dimensions and mode. If not, they cannot be identical.\n2. **ImageChops.difference**: This function computes the per-pixel difference between two images. If the images are identical, the difference will yield an image with zero pixels, resulting in `diff.getbbox()` returning `None`.\n\nThis approach compares the actual pixel content, which is a more robust method for determining if two images are visually identical."
