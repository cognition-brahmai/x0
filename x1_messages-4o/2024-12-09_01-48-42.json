Specifically, when I compare the same method from 'OrderedDict' and 'dict', I get different results. When I run the code, the comparison \"OrderedDict.__repr__ is OrderedDict.__repr__\" returns False, whereas \"dict.__repr__ is dict.__repr__\" returns True. Why is the first result False when I expect it to be True?\n\n<pre><code>\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\nOrderedDict.__repr__ is OrderedDict.__repr__  # This returns False\ndict.__repr__ is dict.__repr__  # This returns True\n</code></pre>"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is related to how Python handles method lookups in classes, particularly with regards to class attributes and method descriptors.\n\nWhen you access `OrderedDict.__repr__`, you're accessing a method from a class defined in C (since `OrderedDict` is implemented in C as part of the `collections` module). In such cases, each access to `OrderedDict.__repr__` creates a new method-wrapper object, which means that each access results in a different object, thus the `is` comparison returns `False`.\n\nOn the other hand, `dict` is a built-in type, and when you access `dict.__repr__`, it directly returns the function object itself, which is a singleton in this context. Therefore, multiple accesses to `dict.__repr__` will return the same function object, resulting in `True` for the `is` comparison.\n\nTo summarize, the discrepancy arises because:\n- `OrderedDict.__repr__` creates a new method object on each access.\n- `dict.__repr__` accesses a singleton function object. \n\nThis difference is due to the internal implementation details of how Python handles method lookups for classes defined in C versus those defined as built-in types."
