        "content": "To merge all `.txt` files in a directory into a single large text file using Bash in Cygwin on Windows, you can use the `cat` command. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Using Bash in Cygwin:\n\n1. Open your Cygwin terminal.\n2. Navigate to the directory containing your `.txt` files.\n3. Run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   cat *.txt > merged_output.txt\n   ```\n\nThis command will concatenate all `.txt` files in the current directory and output them into a single file named `merged_output.txt`.\n\n### Using Windows Command Prompt:\n\nIf you want to achieve the same result using the Windows Command Prompt, you can use the `type` command:\n\n1. Open Command Prompt.\n2. Navigate to the directory containing your `.txt` files using the `cd` command.\n3. Execute the following command:\n\n   ```cmd\n   type *.txt > merged_output.txt\n   ```\n\nThis command will combine all `.txt` files in the current directory into a single file named `merged_output.txt`.\n\n### Using PowerShell:\n\nYou can also use PowerShell to perform this task:\n\n1. Open PowerShell.\n2. Navigate to the directory containing your `.txt` files.\n3. Run the following command:\n\n   ```powershell\n   Get-Content *.txt | Set-Content merged_output.txt\n   ```\n\nThis command will read the content of all `.txt` files and write them into `merged_output.txt`.\n\nEach of these methods will efficiently merge all `.txt` files in a directory into a single text file. Make sure you have write permissions in the directory to create or overwrite the `merged_output.txt` file."
