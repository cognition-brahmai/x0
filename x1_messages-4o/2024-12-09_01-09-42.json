My data is as follows:\n\n```python\ntest = pd.DataFrame({'days': [0,31,45]})\ntest['range'] = pd.cut(test.days, [0,30,60])\n```\n\nHowever, the output I am getting is not as expected:\n\n```python\n    days    range\n0   0       NaN\n1   31      (30, 60]\n2   45      (30, 60]\n```\n\nI am confused as to why the value '0' is not categorized under the range (0, 30]. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the interval `(0, 30]` does not include the value `0` because the interval is open on the left by default. In your case, `pd.cut()` considers the interval `(0, 30]` to include values greater than `0` and up to `30`.\n\nTo include `0` in the first interval, you can adjust the intervals to `[0, 30]` instead of `(0, 30]`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ntest = pd.DataFrame({'days': [0, 31, 45]})\ntest['range'] = pd.cut(test.days, [0, 30, 60], right=True, include_lowest=True)\n\nprint(test)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `right=True` means the intervals are closed on the right side, which is the default behavior.\n- `include_lowest=True` ensures that the lowest value of the first bin is included.\n\nThis should categorize `0` into the range `[0, 30]`, and you'll get the expected results:\n\n```plaintext\n   days    range\n0     0  [0, 30]\n1    31  (30, 60]\n2    45  (30, 60]\n```"
