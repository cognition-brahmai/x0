        "content": "This error is occurring because the `psycopg2` package, which is a PostgreSQL database adapter for Python, requires the `pg_config` executable to be available in your environment to compile from source. This typically happens when the PostgreSQL development libraries are not installed on your system.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Install PostgreSQL Development Packages:**\n\n   Depending on your operating system, you will need to install the PostgreSQL development packages which include `pg_config`.\n\n   - **macOS:** If you are using macOS, you can install PostgreSQL using Homebrew. Open a terminal and run:\n     ```bash\n     brew install postgresql\n     ```\n\n   - **Ubuntu/Debian:** You can install the PostgreSQL development files with:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get install libpq-dev\n     ```\n\n   - **Fedora:** If you are on Fedora, use:\n     ```bash\n     sudo dnf install postgresql-devel\n     ```\n\n   - **Windows:** On Windows, ensure PostgreSQL is installed and `pg_config` is in your PATH. You might need to manually add the PostgreSQL directory to your PATH environment variable.\n\n2. **Use `psycopg2-binary`:**\n\n   If you prefer to avoid dealing with the PostgreSQL development packages, you can install the `psycopg2-binary` package instead. This package is a pre-compiled version of `psycopg2` and does not require `pg_config`. You can do this by running:\n   ```bash\n   pip install psycopg2-binary\n   ```\n\n   After installing `psycopg2-binary`, you can then proceed to install `django-heroku`:\n   ```bash\n   pip install django-heroku\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Your Heroku Configuration:**\n\n   If you're pushing to Heroku, make sure that your `requirements.txt` file reflects the use of `psycopg2-binary` if you've opted for it. Update the file if necessary.\n\n4. **Re-deploy to Heroku:**\n\n   After making these adjustments, commit any changes to your project's files and push to Heroku again:\n   ```bash\n   git add .\n   git commit -m \"Fix psycopg2 dependency issue\"\n   git push heroku master\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and successfully install `django-heroku` along with its dependencies."
