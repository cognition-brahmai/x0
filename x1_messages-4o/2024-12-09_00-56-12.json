I am currently utilizing a threshold array (pickle file of isolation forest from scikit learn) and am attempting to convert the type from Float64 to Float32 with the following code:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(len(tree.tree_.threshold)):\n    tree.tree_.threshold[i] = tree.tree_.threshold[i].astype(np.float32)\n```\n\nThen I print it using:\n\n```python\nfor value in tree.tree_.threshold[:5]:\n    print(type(value))\n    print(value)\n```\n\nThe output I am receiving is:\n\n```python\n<class 'numpy.float64'>\n526226.0\n<class 'numpy.float64'>\n91.9514312744\n<class 'numpy.float64'>\n3.60330319405\n<class 'numpy.float64'>\n-2.0\n<class 'numpy.float64'>\n-2.0\n```\n\nIt appears that the conversion to Float32 is not occurring as expected. Is there a workaround for this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because the `astype(np.float32)` method creates a new array with the specified type without modifying the original array in place. Therefore, when you assign it back to the same index, it does not change the underlying data type of the array element.\n\nTo properly convert the entire `threshold` array from `float64` to `float32`, you can use the `astype` method on the entire array rather than individual elements. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Convert the entire threshold array to float32\ntree.tree_.threshold = tree.tree_.threshold.astype(np.float32)\n\n# Print the first five elements to check their types\nfor value in tree.tree_.threshold[:5]:\n    print(type(value))\n    print(value)\n```\n\nThis approach casts the entire `threshold` array to `float32` in one operation and updates it accordingly. This should yield the desired result with each element of the array now being `numpy.float32`."
