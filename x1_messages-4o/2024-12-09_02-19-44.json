        "content": "In PyQt or PySide, you don't necessarily have to find your own icons for every element. Both libraries provide access to a set of standard icons that are built into the system. These icons are part of the underlying Qt framework and are designed to integrate seamlessly with the look and feel of the desktop environment in which your application is running.\n\nYou can use the `QStyle` class to access these standard icons. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using QStyle**: Qt provides a set of standard icons through the `QStyle` class. You can retrieve these icons using the `standardIcon()` method. Here's an example:\n\n   ```python\n   from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QPushButton\n   from PyQt5.QtGui import QIcon\n   from PyQt5.QtCore import QCoreApplication\n\n   app = QApplication([])\n\n   # Get a standard icon\n   style = app.style()\n   icon = style.standardIcon(QStyle.SP_DialogOkButton)\n\n   # Use the icon in a button\n   button = QPushButton()\n   button.setIcon(icon)\n   button.show()\n\n   app.exec_()\n   ```\n\n   In this example, `QStyle.SP_DialogOkButton` is a standard icon identifier. There are many such identifiers for different standard actions like `SP_DialogCancelButton`, `SP_TrashIcon`, `SP_FileIcon`, etc.\n\n2. **Using QIcon.fromTheme**: If you're targeting environments that support icon themes (like many Linux desktop environments), you can use `QIcon.fromTheme()` to load icons by name from the current theme:\n\n   ```python\n   from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QPushButton\n   from PyQt5.QtGui import QIcon\n\n   app = QApplication([])\n\n   # Get an icon from the current theme\n   icon = QIcon.fromTheme(\"document-open\")\n\n   # Use the icon in a button\n   button = QPushButton()\n   button.setIcon(icon)\n   button.show()\n\n   app.exec_()\n   ```\n\n   This method is particularly useful for ensuring that your application looks consistent with the user's desktop environment.\n\nBy using these methods, you can leverage built-in icons that adapt to different desktop environments, making your application more visually consistent and easier to maintain across platforms."
