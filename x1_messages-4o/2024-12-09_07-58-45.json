I want to remove the first \"@\" on every word, so the final string should be \"hello jon i am @here or @@there and want something in 'here\". I have managed to remove the \"@\" character if it occurs just once using a regex with negative lookahead and negative lookbehind, but now I'm struggling to replace the \"@\" when it occurs more than once. Is there a way to do this replacement in one step?"

        "content": "To replace the first occurrence of \"@\" in every word in a given string, you can use a regular expression with a custom substitution function in Python. The `re.sub()` function allows you to specify a function that defines how each match should be replaced. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef replace_first_at_in_word(match):\n    word = match.group()\n    # Replace the first occurrence of \"@\" with an empty string in the word\n    return word.replace('@', '', 1)\n\n# Your input string\ninput_string = \"hello @jon i am @@here or @@@there and want some@thing in '@here\"\n\n# Use regex to find words containing \"@\" and apply the replacement function\noutput_string = re.sub(r'\\b\\S*@\\S*\\b', replace_first_at_in_word, input_string)\n\nprint(output_string)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Regular Expression (`\\b\\S*@\\S*\\b`)**: This pattern matches whole words (non-space sequences) that contain the \"@\" character. Here, `\\b` denotes a word boundary, `\\S*` matches any non-space characters, and `@` is the literal character we want to find within these words.\n- **Substitution Function (`replace_first_at_in_word`)**: This function takes a matched word and replaces the first \"@\" with an empty string, effectively removing it.\n- **`re.sub()`**: This function applies the regex pattern and substitution function to the input string, replacing each match according to the logic in `replace_first_at_in_word`.\n\nThis approach should correctly handle both single and multiple occurrences of \"@\" within each word, replacing only the first occurrence in each."
