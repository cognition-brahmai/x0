        "content": "The task is to maximize the area of a rectangular pen given a fixed perimeter. The perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by:\n\n\\[ P = 2(l + w) \\]\n\nwhere \\( l \\) is the length and \\( w \\) is the width of the rectangle. You're given that the perimeter \\( P \\) is 16 meters.\n\nLet's set up the equation for the perimeter:\n\n\\[ 2(l + w) = 16 \\]\n\nSolving for one of the variables, let's say \\( l \\):\n\n\\[ l + w = 8 \\]\n\\[ l = 8 - w \\]\n\nThe area \\( A \\) of the rectangle is given by:\n\n\\[ A = l \\times w \\]\n\\[ A = (8 - w) \\times w \\]\n\\[ A = 8w - w^2 \\]\n\nTo find the maximum area, we need to find the vertex of this quadratic equation. The vertex form of a quadratic function \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) is at \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n\nIn this case, \\( a = -1 \\) and \\( b = 8 \\):\n\n\\[ w = -\\frac{8}{2(-1)} = 4 \\]\n\nSubstituting back to find \\( l \\):\n\n\\[ l = 8 - w = 8 - 4 = 4 \\]\n\nSo, the dimensions of the pen that maximize the area are 4 meters by 4 meters. This means the pen is a square with side lengths of 4 meters.\n\nNote: The additional 48 meters of fencing wire mentioned is more than needed, as the required perimeter is only 16 meters given the maximum area constraint."
