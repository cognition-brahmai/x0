For example, if a variable 'ppl' is True, I want to format a variable 'num' to 2 decimal places, and if 'ppl' is False, I want to keep 'num' as it is. I tried using the following code - 'string = f'i am {num:.2f if ppl else num}', but it doesn't seem to work. I want to achieve the behaviour demonstrated by the below code using a simpler f-string if possible:\n\n```\nppl = True\nnum = 3\nstring = f'I am {num:.2f}' if ppl else f'I am {num}'\nprint(string)\n#if ppl False\n#=> i am 3\n#if ppl True\n#=> i am 3.00\n```"

        "content": "In Python, f-strings do not directly support conditional formatting within the curly braces. However, you can achieve the desired behavior by using a small trick involving a separate expression inside the f-string. You can handle the logic outside the f-string or use an inline conditional expression to determine the formatting before passing it to the f-string. Here's a concise way to achieve what you're looking for:\n\n```python\nppl = True\nnum = 3\nformatted_num = f\"{num:.2f}\" if ppl else f\"{num}\"\nstring = f\"I am {formatted_num}\"\nprint(string)\n```\n\nIn this approach, `formatted_num` is determined based on the condition `ppl`, and then it's incorporated into the main f-string `string`. This keeps the logic clean and straightforward while utilizing f-strings effectively."
