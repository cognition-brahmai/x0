        "content": "To calculate the sum and average of a specific column in a MySQL table, you can use the `SUM()` and `AVG()` aggregate functions in a `SELECT` query. Here is the basic syntax:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    SUM(column_name) AS total_sum,\n    AVG(column_name) AS average_value\nFROM \n    table_name;\n```\n\nReplace `column_name` with the name of the column you want to calculate the sum and average for, and replace `table_name` with the name of your table.\n\nFor example, if you have a table called `sales` and you want to find the sum and average of the `amount` column, the query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    SUM(amount) AS total_sum,\n    AVG(amount) AS average_value\nFROM \n    sales;\n```\n\nThis query will return the total sum and average of the values in the `amount` column from the `sales` table."
