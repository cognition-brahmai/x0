I am trying to run Pytorch with Cuda on my Mac but all the guides I have found assume I have an Nvidia graphic card. I found this issue https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/10657 which seems to suggest that I need to install ROCm, but according to their Supported Operating Systems, it only supports Linux. Is it possible to run Pytorch on GPU using a Mac and an AMD Graphic card?"

        "content": "Running PyTorch with GPU support on a MacBook that has an AMD GPU is indeed challenging due to the lack of native support for CUDA, which is specific to NVIDIA GPUs. macOS doesn't natively support other GPU frameworks like ROCm, which is AMD's alternative to CUDA and is primarily focused on Linux environments.\n\nHere are some potential options to consider:\n\n1. **Metal Performance Shaders (MPS):** Apple provides Metal, a low-level API for macOS, iOS, and other Apple operating systems, which can leverage the GPU. PyTorch has started supporting Metal via Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) for some operations, which could be a potential pathway if your application can be supported by this. You may need to check the PyTorch documentation and updates for the latest Metal support.\n\n2. **Running on CPU:** While this won't give you GPU acceleration, running PyTorch on CPU is straightforward and fully supported. For many applications, especially those not requiring extensive parallel computation, this might be sufficient.\n\n3. **External GPU (eGPU):** macOS supports eGPUs, and you could theoretically connect an NVIDIA GPU via an eGPU setup. However, this would require CUDA support, which is not natively provided by Apple, and would also require a setup that might not be officially supported by PyTorch.\n\n4. **Virtualization or Dual-Boot:** Consider running a Linux distribution via Boot Camp or a virtual machine that might have better support for ROCm. This approach can be complex and will require significant setup and tinkering.\n\n5. **Cloud Services:** Another option is to use cloud-based services like Google Colab, AWS, Azure, or others that offer virtual machines with NVIDIA GPUs and pre-installed CUDA and PyTorch setups.\n\nFor the most up-to-date support and capabilities, checking the PyTorch GitHub repository and forums for any developments in macOS GPU support would be beneficial. It's also worth reaching out to the community or forums for any workarounds that others might have successfully employed."
