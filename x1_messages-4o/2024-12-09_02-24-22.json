        "content": "It looks like you're using the `pandas` library to manipulate a DataFrame, and you're encountering an error when trying to clean the strings in the `result` column. The error you're seeing might be due to incorrect usage of the methods, or potentially an issue with how the functions are being called. Let's address the problem and provide a solution for cleaning your data.\n\nYou can clean the `result` column by using the `str.replace` method from pandas, which allows you to specify a regular expression pattern to match and replace unwanted parts of the string. Here's a solution using `str.replace` with a regular expression:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create the DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'time': ['09:00', '10:00', '11:00', '12:00', '13:00'],\n    'result': ['+52A', '+62B', '+44a', '+30b', '-110a']\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Use a regular expression to remove unwanted characters\ndf['result'] = df['result'].str.replace(r'[+-]', '', regex=True).str.replace(r'[a-zA-Z]', '', regex=True)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nHere's what this code does:\n\n- The `str.replace(r'[+-]', '', regex=True)` removes any leading '+' or '-' characters from the strings in the `result` column.\n- The `str.replace(r'[a-zA-Z]', '', regex=True)` removes any trailing alphabetic characters, regardless of case.\n\nAfter running this code, your DataFrame should look like:\n\n```\n    time result\n0  09:00     52\n1  10:00     62\n2  11:00     44\n3  12:00     30\n4  13:00    110\n```\n\nThis approach should efficiently clean up your data as required."
