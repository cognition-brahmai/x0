I installed the nvidia-current driver (nvidia-304 in my case), and verified that my kernel is using nvidia successfully. However, when I try to install CUDA with \"sudo apt-get install cuda\", it attempts to install nvidia-346, which causes my system to fail to display my desktop. I need to install CUDA to work correctly with my older nvidia driver. How can I do this? Is there a list that shows which CUDA toolkits correspond with each NVIDIA driver?"

        "content": "Installing CUDA for an older NVIDIA graphics card like the GeForce 8400 GS on Ubuntu 14.04 can indeed be tricky due to compatibility issues between the CUDA toolkit, NVIDIA drivers, and the operating system. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you install CUDA while maintaining compatibility with your older NVIDIA driver:\n\n1. **Check Compatibility**:\n   - NVIDIA provides a [CUDA compatibility matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html) which shows which versions of CUDA are compatible with specific driver versions. Unfortunately, the GeForce 8400 GS is quite old, and official CUDA support for it is limited.\n\n2. **Choose a Compatible CUDA Version**:\n   - Based on the matrix, CUDA 6.5 is likely the last version that would support your card. You may need to download it directly from the NVIDIA archive if it's not available in the usual repositories.\n\n3. **Download and Install CUDA 6.5**:\n   - Go to the [CUDA Toolkit Archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) and download the CUDA 6.5 installer for your system.\n   - Follow the installation instructions provided in the archive documentation. You might have to use a `.run` file instead of a package manager to avoid unwanted driver updates.\n\n4. **Prevent Driver Updates**:\n   - Once you confirm that the correct NVIDIA driver (nvidia-304) is installed and working, you should prevent it from being updated. You can do this by holding the package with the following command:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-mark hold nvidia-304\n     ```\n\n5. **Install CUDA without Updating Drivers**:\n   - When prompted during the CUDA installation, choose not to install the NVIDIA driver since you already have a working version for your card.\n   - You might need to use the `--override` option with the `.run` installer to bypass some checks.\n\n6. **Set Up Environment Variables**:\n   - Add the CUDA binaries to your PATH and the libraries to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. You can do this by adding the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` file:\n     ```bash\n     export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-6.5/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}\n     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-6.5/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}\n     ```\n\n7. **Reboot and Verify**:\n   - After installation, reboot your system. Verify the installation by running:\n     ```bash\n     nvcc -V\n     ```\n   - This should display the CUDA version if everything is set up correctly.\n\n8. **Test Your Setup**:\n   - Compile and run one of the CUDA samples provided in the toolkit to ensure that your setup is working.\n\nIf you encounter specific errors during installation, reviewing the logs can provide more insight into what's going wrong. Additionally, community forums and older threads related to CUDA on legacy hardware might offer more tailored solutions."
