Additionally, I am not sure what to search for in the documentation to find more information on this. What are %r and %s called exactly? Are they called formatting strings?"

        "content": "In Python, `%r` and `%s` are used in string formatting, specifically with the old-style string formatting method. These are often referred to as format specifiers.\n\nHere's the difference between the two:\n\n1. **%s**: This format specifier is used to convert any Python object using the `str()` function. It is generally used for producing human-readable output. When you use `%s`, Python tries to make the output as user-friendly as possible.\n\n2. **%r**: This format specifier uses the `repr()` function to convert the object into a string. The `repr()` function is intended to generate representations that are more developer-oriented and often include additional details. The output is usually more precise and intended to be unambiguous.\n\n**Why not just use %s all the time?**\n\nWhile `%s` is generally sufficient for most purposes, `%r` can be helpful when you need more detailed or precise output, particularly for debugging. It shows a representation of the object that includes any special characters, such as quotes around strings, which can be useful to see exactly what's being processed.\n\n**What to search for in the documentation:**\n\nThese are part of Python's old-style string formatting, often referred to as \"printf-style\" formatting. In the Python documentation, you can look into \"string formatting operations\" or \"old style string formatting\" for more details. You might also come across terms like \"format specifiers\" or \"string interpolation.\"\n\nPython's newer formatting methods, such as `str.format()` and f-strings (formatted string literals), provide more powerful and flexible ways to format strings, but understanding `%r` and `%s` can be useful for maintaining older code."
