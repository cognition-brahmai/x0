I followed the steps provided on the TensorFlow installation guide for Windows which included installing CUDA Toolkit 8.0, cuDNN v6.0, and ensuring my GPU card with CUDA Compute Capability 3.0 - GeForce 940MX is in place. I used the command `pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu` to install TensorFlow. However, when I try to import TensorFlow, I encounter an error. The traceback error messages indicate issues with locating 'cudart64_90.dll' and suggest that TensorFlow requires this DLL to be installed in a directory included in my %PATH% environment variable. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that there's a mismatch in the versions of CUDA or cuDNN that TensorFlow is expecting. Here's a step-by-step guide to help resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check TensorFlow Compatibility:**\n   Ensure that the version of TensorFlow you're attempting to install is compatible with the versions of CUDA and cuDNN you have. As of TensorFlow 1.12, the following combinations are commonly required:\n   - CUDA Toolkit: 9.0\n   - cuDNN: 7.0\n\n   You should check the specific version of TensorFlow you are installing and refer to its compatibility requirements.\n\n2. **Install the Correct CUDA Toolkit:**\n   Since the error mentions `cudart64_90.dll`, it seems TensorFlow is looking for CUDA 9.0. You should:\n   - Uninstall CUDA 8.0.\n   - Download and install CUDA 9.0 from the NVIDIA website.\n\n3. **Install cuDNN:**\n   - Download and install cuDNN 7.0 for CUDA 9.0.\n   - Ensure you copy the cuDNN files (especially `cudnn64_7.dll`) into the appropriate directories in your CUDA installation path (usually `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v9.0\\bin`).\n\n4. **Add to PATH Environment Variable:**\n   - Ensure that the directories containing your CUDA and cuDNN DLLs are added to your PATH environment variable. This typically includes:\n     - `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v9.0\\bin`\n     - `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v9.0\\extras\\CUPTI\\libx64`\n     - `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v9.0\\include`\n\n5. **Verify Installation:**\n   - Open a new command prompt and verify the CUDA installation with `nvcc --version`.\n   - Use `echo %PATH%` to ensure the paths are correctly set.\n\n6. **Reinstall TensorFlow:**\n   - Uninstall any existing TensorFlow installations with `pip uninstall tensorflow tensorflow-gpu`.\n   - Reinstall TensorFlow GPU version with `pip install tensorflow-gpu==<version_number>`, replacing `<version_number>` with a compatible version for CUDA 9.0 and cuDNN 7.0.\n\n7. **Test the Installation:**\n   - Launch Python and try importing TensorFlow again:\n     ```python\n     import tensorflow as tf\n     print(tf.__version__)\n     ```\n\nIf you still encounter issues, double-check the compatibility matrix on the TensorFlow website for the specific versions of TensorFlow, CUDA, and cuDNN you should use. Additionally, ensure your GPU drivers are up to date."
