I have a sorted list, for instance:\n\n```python\nmylist = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ,9  , 10 ]\n```\nThis list isn't just numbers, it's a list of objects that are sorted with a complicated time-consuming algorithm. I'm looking for a Python function that will give me 'N' items from this list, but will keep their original order. For example:\n\n```python\nrandomList = getRandom(mylist,4)\n# randomList = [ 3 , 6 ,7 , 9 ]\nrandomList = getRandom(mylist,4)\n# randomList = [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 ]\n```\nCould you help me with this?"

        "content": "Certainly! To get a random sample from a list while maintaining the ordering of items, you can use Python's `random.sample()` function to choose a random subset of indices and then sort these indices to maintain the order of the original list. Here\u2019s how you can implement such a function:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef getRandom(original_list, n):\n    # Get a random sample of indices\n    indices = random.sample(range(len(original_list)), n)\n    # Sort the indices to maintain the order\n    indices.sort()\n    # Use the indices to get the items from the original list\n    random_list = [original_list[i] for i in indices]\n    \n    return random_list\n\n# Example usage\nmylist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nrandomList1 = getRandom(mylist, 4)\nrandomList2 = getRandom(mylist, 4)\n\nprint(randomList1)\nprint(randomList2)\n```\n\nThis `getRandom` function takes the original list and the number of items `n` you want in your random sample. It generates random indices, sorts them to maintain the order, and then retrieves the corresponding items from the original list. Each call to `getRandom` will produce a different random output while maintaining the order of elements as they appear in the original list."
