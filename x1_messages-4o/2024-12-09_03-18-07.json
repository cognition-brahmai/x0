I am running a ruby script that prints \"hello\", sleeps for 2 seconds, and then prints \"goodbye\". This works fine and the output is printed with the 2 seconds delay. However, the readline() function hangs in the end and never quits. I never reach the last print statement in my Python script, which says \"This is never reached!\". Why is this happening and how can I fix it?\n\nPython script (main.py):\n\n```python\nfrom subprocess import Popen, PIPE, STDOUT\nimport pty\nimport os\n\nfile_path = '/Users/luciano/Desktop/ruby_sleep.rb'\ncommand = ' '.join([\"ruby\", file_path])\nmaster, slave = pty.openpty()\nproc = Popen(command, bufsize=0, shell=True, stdout=slave, stderr=slave, close_fds=True)     \nstdout = os.fdopen(master, 'r', 0)\n\nwhile proc.poll() is None:\n    data = stdout.readline()\n    if data != \"\":\n        print(data)\n    else:\n        break\n\nprint(\"This is never reached!\")\n```\n\nRuby script (ruby_sleep.rb):\n\n```ruby\nputs \"hello\"\nsleep 2\nputs \"goodbye!\"\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the `readline()` function is blocking; it waits for a newline character or EOF to continue. In your case, after the Ruby script finishes executing, the pipe doesn't immediately close, causing `readline()` to hang as it waits for more input.\n\nYou can address this by using a non-blocking approach. One way to do this is by using the `select` module in Python, which allows you to wait for I/O completion on multiple streams. Here's how you could modify your script to handle the blocking issue:\n\n```python\nfrom subprocess import Popen, PIPE\nimport os\nimport select\nimport pty\n\nfile_path = '/Users/luciano/Desktop/ruby_sleep.rb'\ncommand = ' '.join([\"ruby\", file_path])\nmaster, slave = pty.openpty()\nproc = Popen(command, bufsize=0, shell=True, stdout=slave, stderr=slave, close_fds=True)\nstdout = os.fdopen(master, 'r', 0)\n\nwhile True:\n    # Use select to wait for the file descriptor to be ready\n    ready, _, _ = select.select([stdout], [], [], 0.1)\n    if ready:\n        data = stdout.readline()\n        if data:\n            print(data, end='')  # Use end='' to avoid double newlines\n        else:\n            break\n    if proc.poll() is not None:\n        break\n\nprint(\"This is never reached!\")\n```\n\nHere's what this code does:\n\n1. **Select Module**: It uses `select.select()` to wait for the file descriptor to be ready for reading. This helps in non-blocking I/O operations.\n\n2. **Timeout**: The `select` call includes a timeout (0.1 seconds in this case), which prevents the loop from hanging indefinitely. This timeout can be adjusted as needed.\n\n3. **Check Process Status**: The loop checks if the process has ended using `proc.poll()`. If the process has ended and there's no more data to read, the loop breaks.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the script should no longer hang and will print both \"hello\" and \"goodbye\" with the appropriate delay, followed by \"This is never reached!\" once the Ruby script has finished executing."
