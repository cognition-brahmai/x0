        "content": "To split a string into multiple strings separated by at least one space in a Bash shell, you can use a `for` loop to iterate over each word in the string. Bash automatically splits strings into words based on whitespace when used in a `for` loop. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\ninput=\"${2}\"  # Assign the second argument to the input variable\n\n# Loop through each word in the input string\nfor word in $input; do\n  echo \"$word\"  # Print each word\ndone\n```\n\nThis script will split the input string `${2}` into words wherever there is a space (or multiple spaces), and the `for` loop will iterate through each word individually.\n\nTo check if a string contains spaces, you can use a simple `if` statement with a pattern match. Here's an example:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\ninput=\"${2}\"  # Assign the second argument to the input variable\n\n# Check if the string contains spaces\nif [[ \"$input\" == *\" \"* ]]; then\n  echo \"The string contains spaces.\"\nelse\n  echo \"The string does not contain spaces.\"\nfi\n```\n\nThis script uses a pattern match to check if there is a space character in the string and provides a simple conditional response based on that check."
