        "content": "Designing a SQL database for international movie theaters that handles multiple languages and currencies requires careful planning to accommodate diverse data while ensuring efficient querying. Here\u2019s a structured approach to both designing the database and crafting queries:\n\n### Database Structure\n\n1. **Movies Table:**\n   - `movie_id` (Primary Key)\n   - `title` (use a separate table for translations)\n   - `release_date`\n   - `duration`\n   - `genre`\n\n2. **Movie_Translations Table:**\n   - `translation_id` (Primary Key)\n   - `movie_id` (Foreign Key)\n   - `language_code` (e.g., 'en', 'es', 'fr')\n   - `localized_title`\n   - `description`\n\n3. **Theaters Table:**\n   - `theater_id` (Primary Key)\n   - `name`\n   - `location`\n   - `currency_code` (e.g., 'USD', 'EUR', 'INR')\n\n4. **Showtimes Table:**\n   - `showtime_id` (Primary Key)\n   - `movie_id` (Foreign Key)\n   - `theater_id` (Foreign Key)\n   - `showtime`\n   - `price` (stored in the theater's local currency)\n   - `available_seats`\n\n5. **Seats Table:**\n   - `seat_id` (Primary Key)\n   - `showtime_id` (Foreign Key)\n   - `seat_number`\n   - `is_available`\n\n6. **Currency_Exchange Table:**\n   - `currency_code` (Primary Key)\n   - `exchange_rate_to_usd` (or base currency)\n\n### Queries\n\n1. **Retrieve Movies Playing at a Specific Theater in a Specific Language:**\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT mt.localized_title, mt.description, m.genre\n   FROM Showtimes s\n   JOIN Movies m ON s.movie_id = m.movie_id\n   JOIN Movie_Translations mt ON m.movie_id = mt.movie_id\n   WHERE s.theater_id = ? AND mt.language_code = ?;\n   ```\n\n2. **Retrieve Available Showtimes and Prices in Local Currency:**\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT s.showtime, s.price, t.currency_code\n   FROM Showtimes s\n   JOIN Theaters t ON s.theater_id = t.theater_id\n   WHERE s.movie_id = ? AND t.theater_id = ?;\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Available Seats for Each Showtime:**\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT st.showtime, COUNT(se.seat_id) AS available_seats\n   FROM Showtimes st\n   JOIN Seats se ON st.showtime_id = se.showtime_id\n   WHERE se.is_available = 1 AND st.movie_id = ? AND st.theater_id = ?\n   GROUP BY st.showtime;\n   ```\n\n4. **Convert Price to Different Currency:**\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT s.showtime, \n          (s.price / ce.exchange_rate_to_usd * target_ce.exchange_rate_to_usd) AS converted_price,\n          target_ce.currency_code\n   FROM Showtimes s\n   JOIN Theaters t ON s.theater_id = t.theater_id\n   JOIN Currency_Exchange ce ON t.currency_code = ce.currency_code\n   JOIN Currency_Exchange target_ce ON target_ce.currency_code = ?\n   WHERE s.movie_id = ? AND t.theater_id = ?;\n   ```\n\n### Optimization Considerations\n\n- **Indexes:** Ensure that appropriate indexes are placed on frequently queried columns such as `movie_id`, `theater_id`, and `showtime_id` to enhance query performance.\n\n- **Normalization:** Keep the database normalized to reduce redundancy, especially for translations and currency conversions.\n\n- **Caching:** Consider caching frequently accessed data like exchange rates and movie translations to reduce database load.\n\n- **Partitioning:** If the database grows significantly, consider partitioning tables like `Showtimes` and `Seats` by theater or date to improve performance.\n\nThis structure and set of queries will help efficiently manage and query data for international movie theaters, accommodating language and currency differences."
