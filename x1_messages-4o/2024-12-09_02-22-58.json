I want to add a new column, `CATEGORY`, to `df`, based on matching columns with another dataframe, `df2`, which has around 700 rows. The `CATEGORY` column exists in `df2` alongside another column, `AUTHOR_NAME`, which matches a column in `df`. I've set matching indexes in `df2` and `df`, but some indexes in `df2` do not exist in `df`. My goal is to add the `CATEGORY` from `df2` to `df` when both the indexes and the `AUTHOR_NAME` match between the two dataframes. If there is no match, I'd like to add NaN. I tried merging the dataframes, but it resulted in a larger dataframe than I expected. I also tried using `df2` as a lookup table and applying a function to calculate the category, but it resulted in an `IndexError: ('index out of bounds', u'occurred at index 7614')`. How can I correctly add the `CATEGORY` column to my main dataframe?"

        "content": "To achieve your goal of adding the `CATEGORY` column from `df2` to `df` based on matching indexes and the `AUTHOR_NAME` column, you can use a combination of merging and indexing techniques that ensure you get the desired result without errors. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Ensure Consistent Indexing**: First, make sure the indexes in both dataframes are set correctly. Since you mentioned that the indexes are already matching where necessary, verify that both dataframes have the same index type and that `AUTHOR_NAME` is the common column.\n\n2. **Merge on Index and AUTHOR_NAME**: Use the `merge` function to combine the two dataframes based on both the index and the `AUTHOR_NAME` column. This will ensure that you only get matches where both conditions are satisfied.\n\n3. **Handle Non-matches with NaN**: By using the `how='left'` parameter in the merge function, you can ensure that non-matches in `df2` will result in NaN values in `df`.\n\nHere's how you can do it in code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming df and df2 are your dataframes\n\n# Reset index to ensure merging happens on both index and AUTHOR_NAME\ndf = df.reset_index()\ndf2 = df2.reset_index()\n\n# Merge the dataframes on the index and AUTHOR_NAME\ndf_merged = df.merge(df2[['index', 'AUTHOR_NAME', 'CATEGORY']], \n                     on=['index', 'AUTHOR_NAME'], \n                     how='left')\n\n# If needed, set the index back to the original\ndf_merged = df_merged.set_index('index')\n\n# Now, df_merged has the CATEGORY column added with NaN where no match is found\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Resetting the index**: This ensures that the merge can happen on both the index and `AUTHOR_NAME`. After merging, you can set the index back to its original state if necessary.\n- **Left Merge**: Using `how='left'` ensures that all rows in `df` are retained, and `CATEGORY` will be NaN for non-matching rows from `df2`.\n- **Selective Column Merge**: By only selecting necessary columns from `df2` (`index`, `AUTHOR_NAME`, `CATEGORY`), we ensure that the merge is efficient and does not bring in unnecessary data.\n\nThis should solve your issue without encountering index errors or resulting in a larger than expected dataframe."
