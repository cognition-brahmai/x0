        "content": "The color of a surface itself does not directly reduce air pollution. However, certain colors can have indirect effects on urban environments. For instance, lighter colors, like mint, tend to reflect more sunlight, which can help keep surfaces cooler and reduce the urban heat island effect. This can potentially decrease the energy demand for cooling and indirectly influence pollution levels by reducing emissions from power plants.\n\nThat said, the effectiveness of reducing air pollution is more about the materials and technologies used (e.g., green roofs, reflective surfaces, air-purifying paints) rather than the color itself. If the goal is to address urban air pollution, focusing on these technologies would be more impactful than choosing a specific color."
