However, when I try to check the accuracy with the following function:\n\n```python\ndef accuracy(predictions, labels):\n    return (100.0 * np.sum(np.argmax(predictions, 1) == np.argmax(labels, 1))\n          / predictions.shape[0])\n```\n\nI receive a DeprecationWarning: \"elementwise == comparison failed; this will raise an error in the future\", and it gives the accuracy as 0% for all datasets. My training set has a shape of (200000, 28, 28) and (200000,), validation set has a shape of (10000, 28, 28) and (10000,), and test set has a shape of (10000, 28, 28) and (10000,). How can I properly compare the arrays instead?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to the shape mismatch between `predictions` and `labels`. The `np.argmax` function is used to find the index of the maximum value along a specified axis, which is typically used for one-hot encoded labels or predictions that have multiple classes. However, your labels seem to be in a different format, possibly as a flat array of class indices rather than one-hot encoded vectors.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `accuracy` function to handle your case correctly:\n\n1. Ensure that your predictions are in the right shape. If your predictions are probabilities for each class, they should have the shape `(num_samples, num_classes)`. If they are class indices, they should have the shape `(num_samples,)`.\n\n2. Convert your labels to a format that matches your predictions. If they are currently class indices (e.g., `[0, 1, 2, ...]`), make sure they are compatible for comparison with your predictions.\n\nHere's a revised version of your function assuming `predictions` are class indices:\n\n```python\ndef accuracy(predictions, labels):\n    # Ensure predictions are class indices\n    pred_indices = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1) if len(predictions.shape) > 1 else predictions\n    return (100.0 * np.sum(pred_indices == labels) / len(labels))\n\n# Example usage:\n# predictions should be in the shape (num_samples, num_classes) if they are probabilities.\n# If predictions are already indices, they should be in the shape (num_samples,).\n```\n\nIf your predictions are probabilities and you need to convert them to class indices, ensure you use `np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)`. If your labels are already class indices, the above code should work directly. \n\nAlso, make sure to check the shapes of your arrays before using `np.argmax` to ensure they are compatible for comparison."
