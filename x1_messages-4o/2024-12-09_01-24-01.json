        "content": "The `MemoryError` you're encountering typically occurs when your program tries to use more memory than is available. In your case, generating all possible substrings for each input string and storing them in a list can lead to excessive memory usage, especially if the input strings are large.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how this can happen and some suggestions to resolve the issue:\n\n### Issue Explanation\n\n1. **Excessive Substring Generation:**\n   - For a string of length `n`, there are approximately \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\) substrings. This number grows quadratically with the length of the string. For large strings, this can result in a huge number of substrings.\n\n2. **Memory Usage:**\n   - Storing all these substrings in a list can quickly consume a lot of memory, especially considering that strings are immutable and each substring represents a new string object.\n\n### Solutions\n\n1. **Avoid Storing All Substrings:**\n   - Instead of storing all substrings, consider generating them on-the-fly when needed. This reduces memory usage significantly.\n\n2. **Use Generators:**\n   - Generators can be used to handle large data sets more efficiently by generating items one at a time and only when needed.\n\n3. **Optimize Substring Generation:**\n   - Use a more efficient algorithm to find and store only necessary substrings, or limit the length of the strings you are processing.\n\nHere's an optimized version of your code that uses a generator function to handle substrings and reduces memory usage by avoiding storing unnecessary substrings:\n\n```python\ndef generate_substrings(s):\n    a = len(s)\n    for i in range(a):\n        for j in range(i, a):\n            yield s[i:j+1]\n\ndef main():\n    no_str = int(input(\"Enter number of strings: \"))\n    substring_set = set()\n    for _ in range(no_str):\n        s = input(\"Enter string: \")\n        substring_set.update(generate_substrings(s))\n    \n    sub_strings = sorted(substring_set)\n    \n    queries = int(input(\"Enter number of queries: \"))\n    results = []\n    for _ in range(queries):\n        results.append(int(input(\"Enter index: \")))\n    \n    for p in results:\n        try:\n            print(sub_strings[p-1])\n        except IndexError:\n            print('INVALID')\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Input Size Limitations:** Be mindful of the input size and potentially limit the length of strings that the program can accept.\n- **Efficient Data Structures:** Consider using data structures that are more memory efficient if the problem allows.\n- **Profiling and Optimization:** Use tools to profile your code and identify bottlenecks in memory usage.\n\nBy optimizing how substrings are generated and handled, you'll reduce the risk of running into `MemoryError`."
