        "content": "An exit code 137 typically indicates that the process was killed by the operating system, usually due to excessive memory usage. This can happen when the system's Out-Of-Memory (OOM) killer terminates the process to free up memory. Here are some potential causes and solutions for this issue when running `xgboost.train()` in PyCharm or any other environment:\n\n1. **Memory Usage**: XGBoost can be quite memory-intensive, especially with large datasets or complex models. Ensure that your system has enough RAM to handle the data you're working with.\n\n2. **Data Size**: If you're working with a large dataset, consider reducing its size. You can sample a subset of the data for testing purposes. Alternatively, you can try using a smaller subset of features or reducing the complexity of the model.\n\n3. **Swap Space**: Ensure that your system has sufficient swap space. While it's not a substitute for RAM, having an adequate amount of swap space can sometimes help prevent OOM errors.\n\n4. **Python Version**: You're using Python 3.6; ensure that it's compatible with the version of XGBoost you're using. Sometimes, upgrading Python or XGBoost can resolve compatibility issues.\n\n5. **Parallelism**: Try reducing the number of parallel threads XGBoost uses. You can do this by setting the `nthread` parameter in the `xgboost.train()` function to a lower number, or even to 1, to limit the CPU usage and potentially reduce memory consumption.\n\n6. **Environment Configuration**: Check your environment configuration in PyCharm. Sometimes, running the script outside of the IDE, such as through a terminal or command line, can help determine if the issue is specific to the IDE.\n\n7. **System Monitoring**: Use system monitoring tools to observe memory usage when running the script. This can give you insights into whether you are indeed hitting the memory limits.\n\n8. **Model Complexity**: Consider simplifying your model. You can try reducing the number of trees, depth of trees, or other hyperparameters to reduce the complexity and memory footprint.\n\nBy addressing these areas, you should be able to either resolve the issue or gain more insight into what might be causing the excessive memory usage and the subsequent termination of your script."
