I am encountering a `SynchronousOnlyOperation` exception when making any Django ORM operation in a Jupyter notebook. The error message suggests wrapping each ORM call in a `sync_to_async()` function, but this is not a convenient solution, especially for related fields. I have tried `%autoawait off` magic, but it didn't work. Is there a way to either disable the sync in async context check in Django or run an IPykernel in a synchronous context?"

        "content": "To use Django's ORM in a Jupyter Notebook without encountering the `SynchronousOnlyOperation` exception, you can take a few steps to ensure that the ORM operations are executed in a synchronous context. The issue arises because Jupyter Notebooks run in an asynchronous event loop, and Django 3.0's ORM operations are not designed to run in such a context by default. Here are some steps you can take to work around this issue:\n\n1. **Disable Asynchronous Context Check**: This approach involves modifying Django's behavior, which might not be the best practice but can be useful for exploration and development purposes.\n\n   ```python\n   from django.db import connections\n   for conn in connections.all():\n       conn.force_sync_check = False\n   ```\n\n   This effectively disables the synchronous-only operation check, but keep in mind that this approach might have unintended side effects and should be used cautiously.\n\n2. **Run ORM Operations in a Synchronous Context**: You can create a synchronous context within an asynchronous environment by using `asyncio` to run synchronous code. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n   ```python\n   import asyncio\n\n   def sync_orm_operation():\n       # Place your Django ORM operation here\n       # e.g., MyModel.objects.all()\n       pass\n\n   asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(\n       asyncio.to_thread(sync_orm_operation)\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Use `sync_to_async()`**: Although you mentioned that this is not convenient, it's still a valid approach for converting sync functions to async. This would be the preferred method if you're working with Django async views or other async code.\n\n   ```python\n   from asgiref.sync import sync_to_async\n\n   async def async_orm_operation():\n       result = await sync_to_async(MyModel.objects.all)()\n       print(result)\n\n   asyncio.run(async_orm_operation())\n   ```\n\n4. **Use an Asynchronous ORM**: If you often work in asynchronous contexts, consider using an ORM that is designed to work asynchronously, like `Tortoise-ORM`. This would require more significant changes to your project setup.\n\n5. **Run a Separate Script**: As a workaround, consider writing a separate Python script that runs the ORM operations synchronously and outputs the results in a format that you can load into your Jupyter Notebook.\n\nThese methods should help you use Django's ORM within a Jupyter Notebook without triggering the `SynchronousOnlyOperation` exception. Choose the approach that best fits your use case and be cautious when disabling Django's safety checks."
