I have been using the `plot` method associated with pandas dataframes as follows:\n```python\ndf.plot(x='col_name_1', y='col_name_2')\n```\nBut, I noticed that among the plot styles listed [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/generated/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html) after the `kind` parameter, there are no points. I can use lines, bars, or even density, but I can't seem to figure out how to use points. Is there a workaround to solve this?"

        "content": "To plot two columns of a pandas DataFrame using points, you can use the `scatter` method provided by pandas, or you can use matplotlib directly for more control. The `scatter` method in pandas is specifically designed for creating scatter plots, which plot data points on a 2D plane.\n\nHere's how you can do it using pandas:\n\n```python\ndf.plot(kind='scatter', x='col_name_1', y='col_name_2')\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use matplotlib for more customization:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nplt.scatter(df['col_name_1'], df['col_name_2'])\nplt.xlabel('col_name_1')\nplt.ylabel('col_name_2')\nplt.title('Scatter Plot of col_name_1 vs col_name_2')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nBoth approaches will give you a scatter plot, which essentially plots individual data points on the graph. If you're looking for a plot with just points and no lines, using `kind='scatter'` with pandas or directly using `matplotlib.pyplot.scatter` is the way to go."
