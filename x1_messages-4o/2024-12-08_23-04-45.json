However, you will need to use logical reasoning and conditionals to identify the city with the highest population that meets the criteria. Good luck!\n```\nconst germanyCities = [\n  { name: \"Berlin\", population: 3769000 },\n  { name: \"Hamburg\", population: 1845000 },\n  { name: \"Munich\", population: 1472000 },\n  { name: \"Cologne\", population: 1088000 },\n  { name: \"Frankfurt\", population: 753056 },\n  { name: \"Stuttgart\", population: 634830 },\n  { name: \"D\u00fcsseldorf\", population: 619294 },\n  { name: \"Dortmund\", population: 588994 },\n  { name: \"Essen\", population: 583109 },\n  { name: \"Leipzig\", population: 570087 },\n  { name: \"Bremen\", population: 568321 },\n  { name: \"Dresden\", population: 555805 },\n  { name: \"Hanover\", population: 532163 },\n  { name: \"Nuremberg\", population: 518370 },\n  { name: \"Duisburg\", population: 498590 },\n  { name: \"Bochum\", population: 364628 },\n  { name: \"Wuppertal\", population: 354382 },\n  { name: \"Bielefeld\", population: 333786 },\n  { name: \"Bonn\", population: 327913 },\n  { name: \"M\u00fcnster\", population: 315293 },\n];\n//Your task is to write a code that will identify the German city with the highest population that meets the following criteria:\n//1.
