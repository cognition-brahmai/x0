        "content": "I am trying to figure out whether cudaMalloc and cudaFree are synchronous or asynchronous calls in CUDA. I have modified the \"simpleMultiGPU.cu\" sample code in CUDA SDK to experiment with this. Here is the code:\n\n```c\nfloat *dd[GPU_N];;\nfor (i = 0; i < GPU_N; i++){cudaSetDevice(i); cudaMalloc((void**)&dd[i], sizeof(float));}\n//Start timing and compute on GPU(s)\nprintf(\"Computing with %d GPUs...\\n\", GPU_N);\nStartTimer();\n\n//Copy data to GPU, launch the kernel and copy data back. All asynchronously\nfor (i = 0; i < GPU_N; i++)\n{   \n    //Set device\n    checkCudaErrors(cudaSetDevice(i));\n\n    //Copy input data from CPU\n    checkCudaErrors(cudaMemcpyAsync(plan[i].d_Data, plan[i].h_Data, plan[i].dataN * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, plan[i].stream));\n\n    //Perform GPU computations\n    reduceKernel<<<BLOCK_N, THREAD_N, 0, plan[i].stream>>>(plan[i].d_Sum, plan[i].d_Data, plan[i].dataN);\n    getLastCudaError(\"reduceKernel() execution failed.\\n\");\n\n    //Read back GPU results\n    checkCudaErrors(cudaMemcpyAsync(plan[i].h_Sum_from_device, plan[i].d_Sum, ACCUM_N *sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, plan[i].stream));\ncudaMalloc((void**)&dd[i],sizeof(float));\ncudaFree(dd[i]);\n\n//cudaStreamSynchronize(plan[i].stream);\n}\n```\n\nWhen I comment out the cudaMalloc line and cudaFree line respectively in the loop, I get different GPU processing times (30 milliseconds and 20 milliseconds respectively) on a 2-GPU system. Based on this, I think cudaMalloc is an asynchronous call and cudaFree is a synchronous call. Is my conclusion correct? If not, could you explain the design considerations of the CUDA architecture that affect this? I am using a device with a computation capability of 2.0 and have tried both CUDA 4.0 and CUDA 5.0."

        "content": "Your observations and conclusions about `cudaMalloc` and `cudaFree` are quite insightful. However, the behavior of these functions can sometimes be misunderstood due to their interactions with the CUDA runtime and the GPU's architecture.\n\n1. **`cudaMalloc`:** Typically, `cudaMalloc` is a synchronous call. When you allocate memory on a device, the call generally needs to ensure that the memory is allocated and ready for use before it returns. This often involves communication between the host and the device, making it a blocking operation. However, there might be cases where it appears to behave asynchronously due to the internal workings of the CUDA runtime, such as if the runtime defers some work until later or performs optimizations.\n\n2. **`cudaFree`:** Similarly, `cudaFree` is also generally a synchronous call. It needs to ensure that the memory is released and that any pending operations using that memory are completed. This guarantees that once `cudaFree` returns, the memory is free to be reallocated or used for other purposes without conflicts.\n\nThe difference in timings you observed might be related to several factors:\n\n- **Memory Management Overhead:** Both `cudaMalloc` and `cudaFree` incur some overhead due to memory management operations. If you remove these calls, this overhead is absent, leading to faster execution.\n\n- **Device Synchronization:** Since both `cudaMalloc` and `cudaFree` can lead to implicit device synchronization, they might affect the timing and execution order of your operations, leading to differences in performance.\n\n- **Resource Contention:** On a multi-GPU system, resource contention and how the runtime manages memory across multiple devices can also introduce variability in execution time.\n\nIn conclusion, while `cudaMalloc` and `cudaFree` are typically synchronous, the exact behavior can vary depending on factors like the CUDA version, the GPU architecture, and the specifics of the runtime environment. The observed behavior can be influenced by implicit synchronization, memory management overhead, and other factors that might not be immediately apparent."
