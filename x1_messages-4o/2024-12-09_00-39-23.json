I am using Python 2.7, wxPython, py2exe, py2app, and pyinstaller on two different computers, one Windows and one for Mac. I've tried using py2app and pyinstaller to generate an \".app\" for Mac. However, py2app includes the source code in the package, which I don't want to share with the final users, and pyinstaller generates a UNIX executable. How can I convert this UNIX executable to a Mac \".app\" and is there a way to compile Python code with GCC? In Windows, I created an \"exe\" file from Python code and it works, is it possible to create a single file \"app\" for Mac in a similar way?"

        "content": "Creating a cross-platform GUI application with Python that works on both Windows and Mac OS X involves several steps, especially when trying to bundle the application without exposing the source code. Here\u2019s a comprehensive guide to achieve this:\n\n### Using wxPython for GUI\n\n1. **WxPython Setup**: Ensure you have wxPython installed on both your Windows and Mac development environments. It provides native look and feel for applications.\n\n### Compiling for Windows\n\n1. **py2exe for Windows**:\n   - Use py2exe to convert your Python script into an executable (.exe). This tool will package your application with the necessary Python interpreter and libraries.\n\n2. **Steps**:\n   - Install py2exe: `pip install py2exe`\n   - Create a `setup.py` script for py2exe:\n     ```python\n     from distutils.core import setup\n     import py2exe\n\n     setup(\n         windows=[{'script': 'your_script.py'}],\n     )\n     ```\n   - Run the setup script: `python setup.py py2exe`\n\n3. **Obfuscation**:\n   - Use tools like `pyarmor` or `cython` to obfuscate your code before creating the executable if you want to protect your source code.\n\n### Compiling for Mac OS X\n\n1. **PyInstaller for Mac**:\n   - PyInstaller can be used to create a standalone application bundle (.app) for Mac.\n\n2. **Steps**:\n   - Install PyInstaller: `pip install pyinstaller`\n   - Use the command: `pyinstaller --onefile --windowed your_script.py`\n   - This generates a standalone executable. To create an `.app` bundle:\n     - Use `--windowed` to create a GUI application (no terminal window).\n     - Use `--onefile` to bundle everything into a single executable.\n\n3. **Managing Source Code**:\n   - PyInstaller by default doesn\u2019t include the source code in a readable form, but to increase security, you can use Cython to compile your Python code to C before using PyInstaller.\n\n4. **Creating a .app**:\n   - PyInstaller\u2019s `--windowed` option should suffice to make your application run like a standard Mac app.\n   - If further customization is needed, you can modify the `Info.plist` or package with an installer like `pkgbuild` or `productbuild`.\n\n5. **Using py2app**:\n   - Py2app is another option, but as you mentioned, it includes the source code. You can use Cython to compile your Python scripts to C, which can then be packaged using py2app.\n\n6. **Steps with py2app**:\n   - Install py2app: `pip install py2app`\n   - Create a `setup.py` script for py2app:\n     ```python\n     from setuptools import setup\n\n     APP = ['your_script.py']\n     OPTIONS = {\n         'argv_emulation': True,\n         'packages': ['wx'],\n     }\n\n     setup(\n         app=APP,\n         options={'py2app': OPTIONS},\n         setup_requires=['py2app'],\n     )\n     ```\n   - Run the setup script: `python setup.py py2app`\n\n### Using GCC\n\n- Directly compiling Python code with GCC isn't feasible since Python is an interpreted language. However, you can use Cython to convert Python code to C, which can then be compiled with GCC.\n\n### Summary\n\n- For Windows, use py2exe with possible obfuscation via PyArmor or Cython.\n- For Mac, use PyInstaller with Cython for obfuscation, or py2app with Cython to avoid source code inclusion.\n- Ensure your application is thoroughly tested on both platforms to handle any platform-specific issues."
