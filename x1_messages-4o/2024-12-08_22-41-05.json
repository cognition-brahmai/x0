        "content": "Converting a sentence from present tense to future tense programmatically is a challenging task because it involves understanding the context and structure of the sentence, including subject-verb agreement and handling irregular verbs. However, we can create a basic program in C# that attempts to convert sentences by adding \"will\" before the main verb. This approach won't handle all cases perfectly, especially complex sentences and irregular verbs, but it can serve as a simple starting point.\n\nBelow is a sample C# program that attempts to convert a sentence from present tense to future tense using basic string manipulation:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Enter a sentence in present tense:\");\n        string input = Console.ReadLine();\n\n        string futureTenseSentence = ConvertToFutureTense(input);\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Future tense: \" + futureTenseSentence);\n    }\n\n    static string ConvertToFutureTense(string sentence)\n    {\n        // Split the sentence into words\n        string[] words = sentence.Split(' ');\n\n        // Add \"will\" before the main verb, assuming the verb is the second word\n        for (int i = 0; i < words.Length; i++)\n        {\n            // A simple check for verbs (this is a basic example; real-world usage requires more complex logic)\n            if (IsPresentTenseVerb(words[i]))\n            {\n                words[i] = \"will \" + words[i];\n                break; // Assuming only one verb needs to be converted for simplicity\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Reconstruct the sentence\n        return string.Join(\" \", words);\n    }\n\n    static bool IsPresentTenseVerb(string word)\n    {\n        // A very simplistic check for present tense verbs; real implementation would be more complex\n        string[] presentTenseVerbs = { \"am\", \"is\", \"are\", \"eat\", \"go\", \"play\", \"have\", \"make\", \"do\" };\n        return Array.Exists(presentTenseVerbs, verb => verb.Equals(word, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input:** The program takes a sentence as input from the user.\n- **Splitting:** It splits the sentence into words.\n- **Verb Detection:** The program includes a very basic method to check if a word is a present tense verb, using a predefined list of common verbs.\n- **Conversion:** It adds \"will\" before the detected verb to convert the sentence into future tense.\n- **Output:** The modified sentence is then outputted.\n\n### Limitations:\n- This example uses a simple list to identify verbs, which is not comprehensive.\n- It assumes the verb is the second word in the sentence, which is not always the case.\n- It does not handle complex sentences, irregular verbs, or different forms of verbs.\n- Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools would be more appropriate for a robust solution."
