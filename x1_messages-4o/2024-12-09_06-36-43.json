This can be used in places where a statement is syntactically required but you don't want to perform any operation.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```cpp\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\n{\n    if (i % 2 == 0)\n        ;  // This is an empty statement, doing nothing for even numbers\n    else\n        std::cout << i << \" is odd\\n\";\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the semicolon after the `if` condition acts as a placeholder that does nothing when the condition is true. This is similar to how `pass` is used in Python."
