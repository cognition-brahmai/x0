I've been following this tutorial: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/contrib/admin/. I don't have any custom AdminSites and custom AdminModels. I've tried searching for solutions but have had no luck. The `settings.py` and `admin.py` code I'm using is provided. Can someone help me with this issue?"

    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error message you're encountering, \"`'WSGIRequest' object has no attribute 'user'`,\" typically suggests that there's an issue with the authentication middleware in your Django project. This error can occur if the request object doesn't have the `user` attribute, which is usually attached by the authentication middleware.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Middleware Configuration**:\n   Ensure that you have the required middleware classes in your `MIDDLEWARE` setting within the `settings.py` file. Specifically, you need to have the `AuthenticationMiddleware` included. Here's a typical middleware configuration:\n\n   ```python\n   MIDDLEWARE = [\n       'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',\n       'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',\n       'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',\n       'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',\n       'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',\n       'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',\n       'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',\n   ]\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Installed Apps**:\n   Make sure you have `'django.contrib.auth'` and `'django.contrib.contenttypes'` included in your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:\n\n   ```python\n   INSTALLED_APPS = [\n       'django.contrib.admin',\n       'django.contrib.auth',\n       'django.contrib.contenttypes',\n       'django.contrib.sessions',\n       'django.contrib.messages',\n       'django.contrib.staticfiles',\n       # Add your other apps here\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. **Database Migrations**:\n   Ensure that you have run all necessary database migrations. Sometimes the admin site might not work correctly if the database is not properly set up. Run the following commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n4. **Review URL Configuration**:\n   Double-check that your `urls.py` file is configured correctly to include the admin routes:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.contrib import admin\n   from django.urls import path\n\n   urlpatterns = [\n       path('admin/', admin.site.urls),\n       # Include other URL patterns here\n   ]\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Custom Middleware**:\n   If you've added any custom middleware, ensure that it isn't causing an issue by interfering with the request object.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue you're facing with the Django admin page. If the problem persists, please provide additional context or code snippets that might help in diagnosing the issue further."
