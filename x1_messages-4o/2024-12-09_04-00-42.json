I came across an example on Wikipedia where I noticed a \"-\" in the template syntax \"{%- for item in item_list %}\". I am not sure what this \"-\" means in the context of Jinja2 template engine. Additionally, can you recommend where I can find more Jinja2 examples, preferably those that work well with Google App Engine?"

        "content": "In Jinja2, the `-` character in template syntax like `{%- for item in item_list %}` is used to control whitespace. Specifically, it tells Jinja2 to strip whitespace around the block. This can be useful for tidying up the final rendered output by removing unnecessary spaces or newlines that could be introduced by template tags.\n\nHere's how it works:\n- `{%-` and `-%}`: These will strip whitespace before and after the block.\n- `{{-` and `-}}`: These are used to strip whitespace around variables or expressions.\n\nSo, in your example, `{%- for item in item_list %}`, the `-` ensures that any whitespace before the `for` tag and after the `endfor` tag is removed in the rendered output. This can be particularly useful when generating HTML or other formats where extra whitespace can be an issue.\n\nFor more Jinja2 examples, especially those that integrate well with Google App Engine, consider the following resources:\n\n1. **Jinja2 Documentation**: This is the official documentation and is very comprehensive. You can find it [here](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/). It covers the basics as well as advanced topics and includes examples.\n\n2. **Google Cloud Documentation**: Google Cloud's official documentation often includes examples of using Jinja2 with Google App Engine. You can explore their resources [here](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs).\n\n3. **GitHub Repositories**: Search for open-source projects on GitHub that use Google App Engine and Jinja2. Reviewing real-world examples can provide insights into best practices.\n\n4. **Online Tutorials and Courses**: Websites like Udemy, Coursera, or even free platforms like YouTube often have tutorials specifically tailored to using Jinja2 with Google App Engine.\n\n5. **Community Forums**: Websites like Stack Overflow can be a valuable resource for asking specific questions and finding examples shared by other developers.\n\nThese resources should give you a good start in mastering Jinja2 and effectively using it with Google App Engine."
