I understand that `__doc__` is used for Python docstrings and is useful for providing documentation within functions. However, I am unclear about its function when placed in the middle of a script. Could you explain its purpose and how it works?"

        "content": "In Python, `__doc__` is a special attribute that stores the docstring of a module, class, method, or function. A docstring is a literal string used to document a specific segment of code and is placed immediately after the definition of the module, class, method, or function.\n\nWhen you see `print(__doc__)` at the beginning or anywhere in a script, it's typically used to print the docstring of the module (i.e., the entire script file). This can serve several purposes:\n\n1. **Documentation**: By printing the module's docstring, the script provides immediate documentation to the user or developer executing the script. This can include a brief overview of what the script does, usage instructions, and any other relevant information.\n\n2. **Help and Usage Information**: For scripts that can be executed directly by a user (not just imported as a module), printing the docstring can serve as a quick way to display usage information, similar to a help message.\n\n3. **Educational and Demonstrative Purposes**: In examples or educational materials, printing the docstring can help demonstrate how to use the script or explain its components and functionality.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThis script demonstrates how to use the `print(__doc__)` statement.\nIt provides a brief overview and usage instructions.\n\nUsage:\n    python example_script.py\n\"\"\"\n\ndef example_function():\n    \"\"\"This is a simple example function.\"\"\"\n    return \"Hello, World!\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(__doc__)  # This prints the module-level docstring\n    print(example_function())\n```\n\nIn this script, when you run it, `print(__doc__)` will output the module's docstring, providing the user with an overview and usage instructions before proceeding with the rest of the script's execution.\n\nThis can be especially helpful in larger projects or when sharing scripts with others, as it ensures the documentation is readily available and visible upon execution."
