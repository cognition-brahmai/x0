This change will affect the code editor but not the terminal or console.\n\n3. **Console Font:**\n   - To change the font specifically for the terminal or Python console, go to `Editor` > `Color Scheme` > `Console Font`.\n   - Check the box labeled \"Use console font instead of the default\" to enable the console font settings.\n   - Adjust the font size and style as desired.\n\n4. **Terminal Font:**\n   - Navigate to `Editor` > `Color Scheme` > `Console Font` if you want to change the font for the terminal.\n   - Alternatively, go to `Appearance & Behavior` > `Appearance` > `Customize Fonts...` (if available) to adjust terminal font settings.\n\n5. **Apply Changes:**\n   - Click `Apply` and then `OK` to save the changes.\n\nAfter these steps, the font size in the terminal or Python console should be adjusted according to your preferences. Remember to restart PyCharm if changes do not take effect immediately."
