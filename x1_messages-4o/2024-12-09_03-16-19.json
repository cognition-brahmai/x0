        "content": "To achieve what you're trying to do, you need to make sure that when a POST request is made to the `/start` endpoint, it internally makes a POST request to the `/operation` endpoint. A redirect won't work for POST requests because HTTP redirects typically default to GET requests.\n\nInstead, you'll need to manually make a POST request from the `/start` endpoint to the `/operation` endpoint using a library like `requests`. Here's how you can modify your code to accomplish this:\n\n1. Install the `requests` library if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install requests\n```\n\n2. Update your Flask application code:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/start', methods=['POST'])\ndef start():\n    # Extract data from the initial POST request\n    data = request.get_json()\n\n    # Make a POST request to the '/operation' endpoint\n    operation_url = 'http://localhost:5000/operation'  # Ensure this URL is correct\n    headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}\n    operation_response = requests.post(operation_url, json=data, headers=headers)\n\n    # Return the response from the '/operation' endpoint\n    return jsonify(operation_response.json()), operation_response.status_code\n\n@app.route('/operation', methods=['POST'])\ndef operation():\n    # Extract data from the POST request\n    data = request.get_json()\n\n    # Process the data as needed\n    # For demonstration, just return the received data\n    response_data = {\"message\": \"Processed\", \"received_data\": data}\n\n    return jsonify(response_data)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The `/start` endpoint accepts a POST request and extracts any JSON data sent with the request.\n- It then makes a POST request to the `/operation` endpoint using the `requests` library, passing along the same data.\n- The `/operation` endpoint processes the data (or performs whatever logic you need) and returns a response.\n- The `/start` endpoint then returns the response received from the `/operation` endpoint to the original client.\n\n### Important Note:\n- When using `requests.post`, ensure that the URL is accurate and reachable. For local testing, you can use the actual host and port where your Flask app is running.\n- Be cautious of potential recursion or infinite loops if your application design inadvertently causes the `/operation` endpoint to call `/start` again."
