        "content": "Creating a comprehensive list of words that captures the emotional depth of a poem involves a multi-step approach that considers explicit emotions, implicit emotions, and literary devices. Here's a structured way to approach this task, along with an example HTML page that can serve as a tool for analysis:\n\n### Multi-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Read and Annotate the Poem:**\n   - Start by reading the poem multiple times.\n   - Annotate explicit emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness) directly mentioned in the text.\n   - Identify literary devices (e.g., metaphors, similes, imagery) that contribute to emotional depth.\n\n2. **Identify Implicit Emotions:**\n   - Look for context, tone, and subtleties that suggest deeper emotions.\n   - Consider the cultural and historical context that might influence emotional interpretation.\n\n3. **Create a Word List:**\n   - Compile words and phrases associated with identified emotions and literary devices.\n   - Group them into categories: explicit emotions, implicit emotions, and literary devices.\n\n4. **Analyze Emotional Range:**\n   - Assess the range and intensity of emotions conveyed.\n   - Consider how different elements of the poem interact to create a complex emotional landscape.\n\n### Example HTML Page:\n\nBelow is a simple HTML page example that uses a basic form to input a poem and a script to analyze the emotional range. This example uses JavaScript to perform a basic analysis:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Poem Emotion Analyzer</title>\n    <style>\n        body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 20px; }\n        textarea { width: 100%; height: 200px; }\n        button { margin-top: 10px; }\n        .result { margin-top: 20px; }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<h1>Poem Emotion Analyzer</h1>\n<p>Paste your poem below to analyze its emotional range:</p>\n\n<textarea id=\"poemInput\" placeholder=\"Paste your poem here...\"></textarea>\n<button onclick=\"analyzePoem()\">Analyze</button>\n\n<div class=\"result\" id=\"result\"></div>\n\n<script>\n    function analyzePoem() {\n        const poem = document.getElementById('poemInput').value;\n        const emotions = {\n            explicit: ['happy', 'sad', 'angry', 'joyful', 'fearful'],\n            implicit: ['loneliness', 'nostalgia', 'longing', 'tension'],\n            literaryDevices: ['metaphor', 'imagery', 'alliteration', 'symbolism']\n        };\n\n        let foundEmotions = { explicit: [], implicit: [], literaryDevices: [] };\n\n        for (let category in emotions) {\n            emotions[category].forEach(word => {\n                if (poem.toLowerCase().includes(word)) {\n                    foundEmotions[category].push(word);\n                }\n            });\n        }\n\n        const resultDiv = document.getElementById('result');\n        resultDiv.innerHTML = `<h3>Analysis Results:</h3>\n            <p><strong>Explicit Emotions:</strong> ${foundEmotions.explicit.join(', ') || 'None'}</p>\n            <p><strong>Implicit Emotions:</strong> ${foundEmotions.implicit.join(', ') || 'None'}</p>\n            <p><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> ${foundEmotions.literaryDevices.join(', ') || 'None'}</p>`;\n    }\n</script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### How to Use:\n\n1. Copy the HTML code into a `.html` file and open it in a web browser.\n2. Paste any poem into the text area.\n3. Click \"Analyze\" to see which explicit emotions, implicit emotions, and literary devices are detected based on the predefined lists.\n\n### Expand and Customize:\n\n- **Expand the Word Lists:** Tailor the lists of emotions and literary devices to fit the specific poem or a broader range of poetry analysis.\n- **Enhance Analysis:** Implement more sophisticated natural language processing techniques using libraries such as NLP.js or connect to APIs for deeper analysis."
