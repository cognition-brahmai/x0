However, when I run coverage for ./manage.py shell and exit out of it, it only shows me 37% code coverage. I understand that executed code doesn't necessarily mean tested code, but I'm unsure how to proceed. What I want is to import all the Python modules and \"settle down\" before executing any tests, and then directly communicate with coverage saying \"Ok, start counting reached code here.\" Ideally, nose would reset the \"touched\" lines of code right before executing each test suite. I'm not sure where to start with this problem. I've also tried executing `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=app.settings_dev coverage run app/tests/gme_test.py` and it worked by showing 1% coverage; but I can't figure out how to do this for the entire app. Here is my coverage config: \n\n```\n[run]\nsource = .\nbranch = False\ntimid = True\n[report]\nshow_missing = False\ninclude = *.py\nomit =\n    tests.py\n    *_test.py\n    *_tests.py\n    */site-packages/*\n    */migrations/*\n[html]\ntitle = Code Coverage\ndirectory = local_coverage_report\n```\n\nCould you provide any guidelines or help?"

        "content": "To improve and accurately measure code coverage for your Django application using `django-nose` and `coverage.py`, you need to ensure that the coverage tool is measuring the execution of your test cases rather than just the code execution during the runtime. Here are some steps and tips to help you achieve that:\n\n1. **Ensure Coverage is Run with Tests:**\n   You need to make sure that coverage is run in conjunction with your test suite. Instead of running the shell, you should run tests using `coverage` to measure the lines of code executed by your tests.\n\n   ```bash\n   coverage run manage.py test\n   ```\n\n   This command will execute all your tests and measure which lines of code are being executed by them.\n\n2. **Configure Nose with Coverage:**\n   If you are using `django-nose`, you can configure it to use coverage automatically by adding the following to your `settings.py`:\n\n   ```python\n   TEST_RUNNER = 'django_nose.NoseTestSuiteRunner'\n   NOSE_ARGS = [\n       '--with-coverage',\n       '--cover-package=your_app_name',  # Replace with your actual app name\n       '--cover-inclusive',\n       '--cover-erase',\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. **Specify the Correct Source:**\n   Ensure that the `source` in your `.coveragerc` file points to the specific packages/modules you want to measure. Using `source = .` might include unnecessary files. Update it to:\n\n   ```ini\n   [run]\n   source = your_app_name  # Replace with your actual app name\n   ```\n\n4. **Omit Test Files Correctly:**\n   Double-check the patterns in the `omit` section of your `.coveragerc` file. Ensure that you are not omitting files you intend to measure. You might want to adjust the patterns to be more specific.\n\n5. **Run Coverage Report:**\n   After running your tests with coverage, generate the report to see detailed coverage.\n\n   ```bash\n   coverage report -m\n   coverage html  # To generate an HTML report\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify Test Discovery:**\n   Ensure that all your tests are being discovered by `django-nose`. Sometimes tests might not run if they are not in the standard `tests.py` format or if they are in directories not recognized by Django's test discovery.\n\n7. **Examine Uncovered Code:**\n   Use the HTML report generated by `coverage` to visually inspect which parts of your code are not covered by tests. This can help you identify areas where you need to add more test cases.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to get a more accurate measurement of your code coverage and identify areas that need more testing. If you still encounter issues, consider checking the documentation for `coverage.py` and `django-nose` for more advanced configurations and troubleshooting tips."
