I want to replace this number with their word notation (for example, 3 should be replaced with 'three'). I've already developed a function that can accomplish this task, but I'm struggling with finding the number inside the string without disrupting the rest of the string contents. I'm trying to use the `re.sub` function, which can accept a \"callable\". However, the object passed to it is the internal `_sre.SRE_Match` and I'm not sure how to interact with it. My function accepts a number or its string representation. How should I compose a helper function which can be used to bridge the `re.sub` call with my function doing the required processing? Or is there a more efficient way to achieve my goal?"

        "content": "To accomplish the task of replacing numbers in a string with their corresponding word notation, you can use the `re.sub` function with a helper function. The helper function will be used to convert the matched number to its word representation. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Create a Function for Number to Word Conversion**: Assuming you already have a function that converts numbers to words, let's call it `number_to_words`.\n\n2. **Use Regular Expressions**: Use the `re.sub` function to find numbers in the string and replace them using your conversion function.\n\n3. **Define a Callable for `re.sub`**: The callable will take a match object as input, extract the number, and then call your number-to-word function.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Example function that converts numbers to words\ndef number_to_words(number):\n    # This is a simple implementation. You need a full implementation for complex cases.\n    num_words = {\n        0: \"zero\", 1: \"one\", 2: \"two\", 3: \"three\", 4: \"four\",\n        5: \"five\", 6: \"six\", 7: \"seven\", 8: \"eight\", 9: \"nine\"\n    }\n    return num_words.get(int(number), str(number))\n\n# Helper function to be used with re.sub\ndef replace_number_with_word(match):\n    number = match.group()  # Extract the matched number as a string\n    return number_to_words(number)\n\n# Example string\nexample_string = \"I have 2 apples and 3 bananas.\"\n\n# Use re.sub with the helper function\nresult = re.sub(r'\\b\\d+\\b', replace_number_with_word, example_string)\n\nprint(result)  # Output: \"I have two apples and three bananas.\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Regular Expression `\\b\\d+\\b`**: This pattern matches whole numbers in the string. `\\b` ensures word boundaries, so only standalone numbers are matched.\n- **`replace_number_with_word` Function**: This function is called for each match found by `re.sub`. It extracts the matched number using `match.group()` and passes it to `number_to_words` for conversion.\n- **Result**: The `re.sub` function replaces each matched number with its word representation in the original string.\n\nThis approach is efficient and leverages Python's regex capabilities to seamlessly integrate a custom conversion function."
