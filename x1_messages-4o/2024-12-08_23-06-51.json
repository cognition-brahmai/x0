Here\u2019s an example assuming your table is named `CampingItems` with columns `Item` and `Category`:\n\n```sql\nWITH RankedItems AS (\n    SELECT \n        Item,\n        Category,\n        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY Item) as rn\n    FROM \n        CampingItems\n    WHERE \n        Category IN ('Shelter', 'Cooking', 'Sleeping', 'Hygiene', 'Miscellaneous')\n)\nSELECT \n    Item,\n    Category\nFROM \n    RankedItems\nWHERE \n    rn = 1;\n```\n\nThis query assigns a row number to each item within its category and selects the first item from each of the specified categories. Adjust the `ORDER BY Item` clause as needed to prioritize items based on your criteria (e.g., alphabetically by `Item`, by popularity, etc.)."
