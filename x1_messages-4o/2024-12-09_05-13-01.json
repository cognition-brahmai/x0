        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that Sublime Text is unable to find the `python3` executable in your system's PATH. This is a common issue on macOS because Sublime Text may not be aware of the environment variables set in your shell configuration.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Find the Path to Python 3:**\n   Open your terminal and run the following command to find the path to your Python 3 installation:\n   ```bash\n   which python3\n   ```\n   This should return a path, such as `/usr/local/bin/python3`.\n\n2. **Modify the Build System:**\n   Instead of using just `\"python3\"` in your build system, use the full path you obtained from the `which` command. Modify your build system file to look like this:\n   ```json\n   {\n       \"cmd\": [\"/usr/local/bin/python3\", \"$file\"],\n       \"selector\": \"source.python\",\n       \"file_regex\": \"file \\\"(...*?)\\\", line ([0-9]+)\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Save and Use the Build System:**\n   Save your modified build system file. When you try to build your Python code, ensure that you select this custom build system from `Tools > Build System`.\n\n4. **Restart Sublime Text:**\n   Sometimes, changes in configurations require a restart. Close and reopen Sublime Text to ensure it picks up the new build system configuration.\n\nIf you continue to have issues, you might want to check the permissions of the Python executable or ensure that Python 3 is correctly installed on your system. Also, verify that the terminal command `python3` works as expected outside of Sublime Text."
