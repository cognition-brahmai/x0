However, if the year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year, unless:\n3. The year is also divisible by 400, in which case it is a leap year.\n\nLet's apply these rules to the year 2021:\n\n- 2021 is not divisible by 4 (2021 % 4 = 1), so it is not a leap year.\n\nTherefore, the year 2021 is not a leap year."
