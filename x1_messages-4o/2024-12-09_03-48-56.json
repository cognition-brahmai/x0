I require unbuffered output, so I attempted to use `#!/usr/bin/env python -u`, but this results in an error: `python -u: no such file or directory`. I discovered that `#/usr/bin/python -u` works, but it is essential for me to get the Python in PATH to support virtual `env` environments. What solutions do I have?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering arises from how the `env` command processes options. When you use `#!/usr/bin/env python -u`, `env` interprets `python -u` as a single command name, which it can't find.\n\nTo solve this problem while still allowing for unbuffered output and supporting virtual environments, you can modify your script to set the `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` environment variable instead of trying to pass the `-u` flag directly in the shebang line. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Use the `env` command in the shebang to locate the Python interpreter:\n   ```python\n   #!/usr/bin/env python\n   ```\n\n2. Set the `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` environment variable at the start of your script:\n   ```python\n   import os\n   os.environ['PYTHONUNBUFFERED'] = '1'\n   ```\n\nAlternatively, you can set the `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` environment variable in the shell before executing your script, like so:\n```bash\nexport PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1\n./your_script.py\n```\n\nBoth approaches will ensure that your Python script runs with unbuffered output while still supporting virtual environments and the `env` command to locate the Python interpreter on the system."
