        "content": "Yes, it's possible to display a picture and capture mouse click coordinates relative to the picture edges using Python on Windows. You can achieve this using libraries such as Tkinter or PyQt. Below is an example using Tkinter, which is a built-in library for creating graphical user interfaces in Python:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageTk\n\ndef on_click(event):\n    # Get the coordinates of the click relative to the image\n    x, y = event.x, event.y\n    print(f\"Clicked at: ({x}, {y})\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Create the main window\n    root = tk.Tk()\n    root.title(\"Image Click Coordinates\")\n\n    # Load the image\n    image_path = \"path_to_your_image.jpg\"  # Replace with your image path\n    image = Image.open(image_path)\n    photo = ImageTk.PhotoImage(image)\n\n    # Create a label to display the image\n    label = tk.Label(root, image=photo)\n    label.pack()\n\n    # Bind the click event to the on_click function\n    label.bind(\"<Button-1>\", on_click)\n\n    # Run the Tkinter main loop\n    root.mainloop()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Tkinter**: This is the GUI toolkit used for rendering the window and handling events like mouse clicks.\n- **PIL (Pillow)**: This library is used to load and handle the image file. `ImageTk.PhotoImage` is then used to convert the image into a format that Tkinter can display.\n- **on_click function**: This function is triggered whenever a left mouse button click (`<Button-1>`) event occurs on the image. It retrieves the coordinates of the click relative to the image and prints them.\n\n### Usage:\n1. Install the Pillow library if you haven't already by running `pip install pillow`.\n2. Replace `\"path_to_your_image.jpg\"` with the actual file path of the image you want to display.\n3. Run the script, and a window will open displaying your image. Click on the image, and the coordinates of your click will be printed in the console.\n\nThis approach is straightforward and works well for basic applications that need to capture click events on images. If you need more advanced features, you might consider using PyQt or other GUI libraries."
