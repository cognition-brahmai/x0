        "content": "To solve this problem, we must find four distinct prime numbers whose sum is 50 and whose product is a four-digit number with exactly three prime factors when written in exponential form. \n\nLet's denote these four primes as \\( p_1, p_2, p_3, \\) and \\( p_4 \\). We know that:\n\n1. \\( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = 50 \\)\n2. The product \\( p_1 \\times p_2 \\times p_3 \\times p_4 \\) is a four-digit number.\n3. The number must have exactly three prime factors in its exponential form, meaning one of the primes is repeated once.\n\nLet's begin by considering possible candidates for the primes. We need to find a combination of four distinct primes that add up to 50, while also considering the condition about the repeated prime.\n\nWe can start by trying smaller primes because they tend to produce products that are four-digit numbers:\n\n- Possible primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, etc.\n\nTo satisfy the condition of having three prime factors in exponential form, one of these primes must be repeated. Let's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. Assume \\( p_1 = 2 \\) (a small prime to keep the product manageable).\n2. \\( p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = 48 \\)\n\nNow, let's test some combinations:\n\n- Try \\( p_2 = 11 \\), \\( p_3 = 13 \\), \\( p_4 = 17 \\):\n\n  \\[\n  11 + 13 + 17 = 41\n  \\]\n\n  \\( 41 \\) is less than 48, so this combination will not work.\n\n- Try \\( p_2 = 7 \\), \\( p_3 = 13 \\), \\( p_4 = 19 \\):\n\n  \\[\n  7 + 13 + 19 = 39\n  \\]\n\n  This sum is also less than 48.\n\n- Try \\( p_2 = 7 \\), \\( p_3 = 11 \\), \\( p_4 = 23 \\):\n\n  \\[\n  7 + 11 + 23 = 41\n  \\]\n\n  Again, less than 48.\n\nLet's try another approach by assuming a repeated prime:\n\n- Assume \\( p_1 = p_2 = 5 \\):\n\n  \\[\n  5 + 5 + p_3 + p_4 = 50\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  p_3 + p_4 = 40\n  \\]\n\n  Now try different combinations for \\( p_3 \\) and \\( p_4 \\):\n\n- Try \\( p_3 = 17 \\), \\( p_4 = 23 \\):\n\n  \\[\n  17 + 23 = 40\n  \\]\n\n  This combination works, and the primes are \\( 5, 5, 17, 23 \\).\n\nLet's verify the product:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 5 \\times 17 \\times 23 = 5^2 \\times 17 \\times 23\n\\]\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n- \\( 5^2 = 25 \\)\n- \\( 25 \\times 17 = 425 \\)\n- \\( 425 \\times 23 = 9775 \\)\n\nThe product \\( 9775 \\) is indeed a four-digit number and meets the condition of having exactly three prime factors in its exponential form.\n\nTherefore, the four-digit positive integer you are thinking of is **9775**."
