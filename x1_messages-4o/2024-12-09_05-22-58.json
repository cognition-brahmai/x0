        "content": "How can I create a python pandas function that takes values from two different columns as arguments? I have a function that returns a 1 if the values of two columns are within the same range and 0 otherwise. I would like the function to take the value of each row in one column as the first argument (e.g., `RealTime` = `df['TimeCol']`) and the value of each row in another column as the second argument (`ResponseTime` = `df['ResponseCol']`). The result should be a new column in the dataframe. I tried the following code but it didn't work:\n\n```python\ndf['NewCol'] = df.apply(segmentMatch, args=(df['TimeCol'], df['ResponseCol']), axis=1)\n```\n\nHere is the segmentMatch function:\n\n```python\ndef segmentMatch(RealTime, ResponseTime):\n    if RealTime <= 566 and ResponseTime <= 566:\n        matchVar = 1\n    elif 566 < RealTime <= 1132 and 566 < ResponseTime <= 1132:\n        matchVar = 1\n    elif 1132 < RealTime <= 1698 and 1132 < ResponseTime <= 1698:\n        matchVar = 1\n    else:\n        matchVar = 0\n    return matchVar\n```"

        "content": "Your approach is almost correct, but the way you pass arguments to the `apply` function is a bit off. When using `apply` with `axis=1`, each row of the dataframe is passed as a Series to the function, so you need to access the column values from that Series. You don't need to pass the columns as separate arguments using `args`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to make it work:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample dataframe\ndata = {\n    'TimeCol': [100, 600, 1200, 1700],\n    'ResponseCol': [200, 700, 1300, 1600]\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\ndef segmentMatch(row):\n    RealTime = row['TimeCol']\n    ResponseTime = row['ResponseCol']\n    \n    if RealTime <= 566 and ResponseTime <= 566:\n        matchVar = 1\n    elif 566 < RealTime <= 1132 and 566 < ResponseTime <= 1132:\n        matchVar = 1\n    elif 1132 < RealTime <= 1698 and 1132 < ResponseTime <= 1698:\n        matchVar = 1\n    else:\n        matchVar = 0\n    \n    return matchVar\n\n# Apply the function\ndf['NewCol'] = df.apply(segmentMatch, axis=1)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The `segmentMatch` function now takes a single argument `row`, which is a Series representing a row of your dataframe.\n2. **Accessing Values**: Inside the function, access the values from the Series using `row['TimeCol']` and `row['ResponseCol']`.\n3. **Apply Function**: Use `df.apply(segmentMatch, axis=1)` to apply the function row-wise.\n\nThis should correctly create a new column `NewCol` in your dataframe with the desired values."
