I am able to handle strings and proper integers, however, I am having difficulties parsing all-spaces fields using int(). I am trying to handle this by defining a subclass of int that can parse blank strings. This way, I can change the type of appropriate table entries without introducing extra complexities in the parsing code. However, I am unable to override the constructor of a built-in type in a sub-type, as defining a constructor in the subclass does not seem to help. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nparse_table = [\n    ('name', type, length),\n    ....\n    ('numeric_field', int, 10), # int example\n    ('text_field', str, 100), # string example\n    ...\n]\n```\n\nI feel I might be missing something fundamental about how Python built-in types work. How should I approach this issue? I am also open to alternatives that do not add too much complexity."

        "content": "To handle parsing of all-spaces fields as integers in a fixed-length text record, you'll need to create a custom class for parsing integers that can gracefully handle blank values. Since you cannot directly override the constructor of a built-in type like `int`, you can instead define a new class that encapsulates the logic you desire.\n\nHere's one way to achieve that:\n\n```python\nclass BlankInt(int):\n    def __new__(cls, value):\n        # Check if the value is a string and is all spaces or empty\n        if isinstance(value, str) and value.strip() == '':\n            return super().__new__(cls, 0)  # Return 0 for blank values\n        try:\n            return super().__new__(cls, value)\n        except ValueError:\n            return super().__new__(cls, 0)  # Fallback to 0 in case of any conversion error\n\n# Example parse table using the custom BlankInt class\nparse_table = [\n    ('name', str, 10),\n    ('numeric_field', BlankInt, 10),\n    ('text_field', str, 100),\n]\n\ndef parse_record(record, parse_table):\n    parsed_data = {}\n    index = 0\n    for field_name, field_type, field_length in parse_table:\n        field_value = record[index:index+field_length]\n        parsed_data[field_name] = field_type(field_value)\n        index += field_length\n    return parsed_data\n\n# Example usage\nrecord = \"John Doe  1234567890Some text here                   \"\nparsed = parse_record(record, parse_table)\nprint(parsed)  # Output will include parsed integer values, handling blanks as 0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **BlankInt Class**: \n   - This subclass of `int` checks if the input value is a blank string (all spaces) and returns `0` if it is.\n   - It uses the `__new__` method because `int` is an immutable type, and `__new__` is used to create a new instance of immutable types.\n\n2. **Parse Table**: \n   - The `parse_table` now uses `BlankInt` for fields that should handle blank strings as zero.\n\n3. **Parsing Function**: \n   - The `parse_record` function iterates over the `parse_table`, slicing the record based on the specified length for each field, and applies the type conversion using the field's type (e.g., `BlankInt`, `str`).\n\nThis approach maintains simplicity while allowing the flexibility to handle blank integer fields appropriately."
