        "content": "To convert a tuple of tuples containing strings to a list of lists containing integers, you can use a list comprehension in Python. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n1. Iterate over each tuple in the main tuple.\n2. For each tuple, iterate over each string element.\n3. Convert each string element to an integer.\n4. Collect the integers into a new list.\n5. Collect each of these lists into your final list of lists.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can accomplish this:\n\n```python\nT1 = (('13', '17', '18', '21', '32'),\n      ('07', '11', '13', '14', '28'),\n      ('01', '05', '06', '08', '15', '16'))\n\n# Using list comprehension to convert tuples of strings to lists of integers\nT2 = [[int(number) for number in sub_tuple] for sub_tuple in T1]\n\nprint(T2)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[[13, 17, 18, 21, 32], [7, 11, 13, 14, 28], [1, 5, 6, 8, 15, 16]]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The outer list comprehension iterates over each tuple in `T1`.\n- The inner list comprehension iterates over each string in the current tuple (`sub_tuple`).\n- The `int(number)` function converts each string to an integer.\n- The inner list comprehension creates a list of integers for each tuple.\n- The outer list comprehension collects these lists into a final list of lists `T2`."
