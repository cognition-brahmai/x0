        "content": "In PyTorch, batch normalization for fully connected layers can be achieved using the `BatchNorm1d` class. Although `BatchNorm1d` might initially seem like it is only for 1-dimensional sequence data, it is actually designed to work with 2D input as well, which is typical for fully connected layers in neural networks.\n\nHere's how you can use `BatchNorm1d` for a fully connected layer in PyTorch:\n\n1. **Define the BatchNorm1d Layer**: When you define your model, you can add a `BatchNorm1d` layer after a fully connected (`Linear`) layer. The number of features for `BatchNorm1d` should match the number of output features of the fully connected layer.\n\n2. **Integrate into the Model**: You can integrate the batch normalization layer into your model by adding it in the `forward` method after the linear transformation and before the activation function.\n\nHere is a simple example to illustrate how to use `BatchNorm1d` with a fully connected layer:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass FullyConnectedModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):\n        super(FullyConnectedModel, self).__init__()\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)\n        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm1d(hidden_size)\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.fc1(x)\n        x = self.bn1(x)\n        x = torch.relu(x)\n        x = self.fc2(x)\n        return x\n\n# Example usage\ninput_size = 10\nhidden_size = 5\noutput_size = 2\nmodel = FullyConnectedModel(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)\n\n# Create a dummy input tensor\ninput_tensor = torch.randn(3, input_size)  # batch size of 3\noutput = model(input_tensor)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `fc1` is the first fully connected layer with an input size of `input_size` and an output size of `hidden_size`.\n- `bn1` is a `BatchNorm1d` layer that normalizes the output from `fc1` with `hidden_size` features.\n- The batch normalization is applied after the linear transformation (`fc1`) and before the non-linear activation function (`ReLU` in this case).\n\nThis setup is common for fully connected layers when using batch normalization in PyTorch."
