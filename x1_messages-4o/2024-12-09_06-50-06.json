I have been attempting to compile my Python 3.5 file using the latest py2exe version 0.9.2.2 with the command:\n```\npy -3.5 -m py2exe.build_exe myscript.py\n```\nHowever, I keep encountering an issue where the \"run-py3.5-win-amd64.exe\" file is not found in the ...lib\\site-packages\\py2exe\\ folder. Does this mean that py2exe 0.9.2.2 is only compatible up to Python 3.4?"

        "content": "As of the latest available information, py2exe version 0.9.2.2 does indeed have certain limitations regarding Python 3.5 compatibility. This version primarily supports Python 3.3 and 3.4. It appears that the \"run-py3.5-win-amd64.exe\" file is not included in the distribution, which suggests that full support for Python 3.5 might not be available in this version.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to work around this issue:\n\n1. **Check for Updates**: First, ensure you have the latest version of py2exe. Check the official py2exe website or repository for any newer releases or patches that might support Python 3.5.\n\n2. **Alternative Tools**: Consider using alternative packaging tools that support Python 3.5. For example, `cx_Freeze`, `PyInstaller`, or `py2app` might be more suitable for your needs and offer better support for newer versions of Python.\n\n3. **Custom Compile**: If you're comfortable with it, you might try modifying py2exe to add support for Python 3.5, though this will require some knowledge of both Python and the py2exe internals.\n\n4. **Community Support**: Explore community solutions or forks of py2exe on platforms like GitHub, where other developers might have already addressed this issue.\n\n5. **Downgrade Python**: As a last resort, if your application is compatible, you might consider temporarily downgrading to Python 3.4 to use py2exe if no other solution works for you.\n\nIt's always a good idea to keep an eye on the official documentation and community forums for any updates or shared solutions regarding compatibility issues."
