I heard that using the Math.sqrt() function in JavaScript can help with this. Can you write a code that generates the next number in this sequence using Math.sqrt()?"

The next number in the sequence would be \\(7^2\\).\n\nTo generate the next number in the sequence using JavaScript and the `Math.sqrt()` function, you can create a simple function to calculate the square of the next integer. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```javascript\nfunction nextSquareInSequence(currentNumber) {\n  // Find the square root of the current number\n  let n = Math.sqrt(currentNumber);\n  \n  // Increment the number to get the next integer\n  n++;\n  \n  // Return the square of the next integer\n  return n * n;\n}\n\n// The last number in your sequence is 36\nlet lastNumber = 36;\nlet nextNumber = nextSquareInSequence(lastNumber);\n\nconsole.log(\"The next number in the sequence is: \" + nextNumber);\n```\n\nThis code takes the last number in your sequence (36), calculates its square root to find the integer it's based on (which is 6), increments it by 1 to get the next integer (7), and then squares it to find the next number in the sequence, which is 49."
