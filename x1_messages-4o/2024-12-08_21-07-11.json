The only information you have is the enthalpy of vaporization, which is -30 kJ/mol. However, there is a twist - the lab's thermometer is malfunctioning, and it is displaying temperatures in Fahrenheit instead of Celsius. \nYour job is to use the given formula to calculate the boiling point of the liquid in both Kelvin and Fahrenheit. To make things even trickier, the only calculator available to you is missing the \"1/x\" button, so you'll have to get creative with your calculations. \nHints: \n1. Remember that the boiling point of water is 373.15 K and 212 \u00b0F. \n2. You can use ratios and proportions to calculate the boiling point in Fahrenheit. \n3. Round your final answers to the nearest whole number. \nLiquid | Enthalpy of Vaporization (\u0394Hvap) | Boiling Point in Kelvin (BP) | Boiling Point in Fahrenheit (BP)\n-------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------\nMysterious Liquid | -30 kJ/mol | ____________ K | ____________ \u00b0F \nWater | 40.7 kJ/mol | 373 K | 212 \u00b0F \nEthanol | 38.6 kJ/mol | 351 K | 173 \u00b0F \nBenzene | 30.8 kJ/mol | 353 K | 176 \u00b0F \nAcetone | 31.3 kJ/mol | 329 K | 136 \u00b0F \nChloroform | 29.8 kJ/mol | 334 K | 111 \u00b0F"

        "content": "To determine the boiling point of the mysterious liquid in both Kelvin and Fahrenheit, we can use the information provided about the enthalpy of vaporization and the boiling points of other substances.\n\nWe know:\n\n- The enthalpy of vaporization for the mysterious liquid is given as -30 kJ/mol. This is a typo or mistake because enthalpy values should be positive for phase changes like vaporization. Let's assume it is +30 kJ/mol instead.\n- To find the boiling point, we can use interpolation based on the given substances with known boiling points and enthalpy values.\n\nLet's list the relevant substances:\n\n- Benzene: \u0394Hvap = 30.8 kJ/mol, BP = 353 K\n- Chloroform: \u0394Hvap = 29.8 kJ/mol, BP = 334 K\n\nSince the enthalpy of vaporization of the mysterious liquid (30 kJ/mol) falls between chloroform and benzene, we'll interpolate between their boiling points.\n\n1. **Interpolate for Kelvin:**\n\n   The enthalpy difference between benzene and chloroform:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta_{\\text{Hvap}} = 30.8 - 29.8 = 1 \\, \\text{kJ/mol}\n   \\]\n\n   The boiling point difference between benzene and chloroform:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta_{\\text{BP}} = 353 - 334 = 19 \\, \\text{K}\n   \\]\n\n   The mysterious liquid's enthalpy is 30 kJ/mol:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Proportion} = \\frac{30 - 29.8}{1} = 0.2\n   \\]\n\n   Thus, the boiling point in Kelvin will be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{BP in K} = 334 + 0.2 \\times 19 = 334 + 3.8 = 337.8 \\, \\text{K}\n   \\]\n\n   Rounded to the nearest whole number: 338 K\n\n2. **Convert to Fahrenheit:**\n\n   Using the known boiling points in Kelvin and Fahrenheit:\n   - Chloroform: 334 K = 111 \u00b0F\n   - Benzene: 353 K = 176 \u00b0F\n\n   We can use a similar interpolation approach:\n\n   Kelvin difference: 19 K\n   Fahrenheit difference: 176 - 111 = 65 \u00b0F\n\n   Proportion for Fahrenheit:\n   \\[\n   \\text{BP in \u00b0F} = 111 + 0.2 \\times 65 = 111 + 13 = 124 \\, \\text{\u00b0F}\n   \\]\n\n   Rounded to the nearest whole number: 124 \u00b0F\n\nFinally, the boiling point of the mysterious liquid is approximately 338 K and 124 \u00b0F."
