Your task is to provide a speech that not only highlights the importance of individual responsibility and contribution towards a sustainable and just future but also presents practical and actionable steps for the graduates to make a positive impact in their respective fields. However, you must do this in a way that requires reasoning and deduction skills to understand and respond correctly.\nTo achieve this, I ask that you create a speech that includes a hidden code that provides a clue for the graduates to uncover a secret message. The speech should also include a table that outlines the key points of the speech and their corresponding time slots for optimal delivery, but the order of the points should be rearranged in a way that requires the graduates to solve a puzzle to figure out the correct order. Additionally, the code snippet that integrates interactive elements should be modified to include a logic puzzle that the audience must solve in order to engage with the interactive elements.\nAre you up for the challenge? Let's see if you can create a graduation speech that not only inspires but also challenges the graduates to think critically and solve puzzles."
