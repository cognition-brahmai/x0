How can I remove all empty lists from my original list?"

        "content": "To remove all empty lists from your original list, you can use a list comprehension to filter out the empty lists. The `remove()` method won't work in this case because it is designed to remove the first occurrence of a specific value, and not to iterate through the list and remove all occurrences of empty lists.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this with a list comprehension:\n\n```python\nlist1 = [[], [], [], [], [], 'text', 'text2', [], 'moreText']\nlist2 = [item for item in list1 if item != []]\n\nprint(list2)\n```\n\nThis will produce the desired output:\n\n```\n['text', 'text2', 'moreText']\n```\n\nThe list comprehension `[item for item in list1 if item != []]` iterates over each `item` in `list1` and includes it in the new list `list2` only if the `item` is not an empty list (`[]`)."
