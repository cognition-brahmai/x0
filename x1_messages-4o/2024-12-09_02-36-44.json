However, I encounter an error stating \"Could not find platform independent libraries <prefix>\", \"Could not find platform dependent libraries <exec_prefix>\", \"Consider setting $PYTHONHOME to <prefix>[:<exec_prefix>]\" and \"ImportError: No module named site\". I'm unsure about what <prefix> and <exec_prefix> are referring to. When I check my Python version, it returns Python 2.7.1. Additionally, I have a list of modules in the directory /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7, including site.py. How do I troubleshoot this problem and enable my computer to find the necessary Python modules?"

        "content": "The error messages you're encountering suggest an issue with the Python environment configuration, particularly with the `PYTHONHOME` and `PYTHONPATH` environment variables. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and resolve these issues:\n\n1. **Verify Python Installation**: Ensure that your Python installation is correctly set up. Since you mentioned Python 2.7.1, it might be beneficial to update to a more recent version of Python 2.7.x, as Python 2.7.1 is quite old.\n\n2. **Check Environment Variables**:\n   - Open your terminal and type `echo $PYTHONHOME` and `echo $PYTHONPATH` to check if these environment variables are set. They might be unset or incorrectly set.\n   - If they are set and point to incorrect locations, you can unset them using `unset PYTHONHOME` and `unset PYTHONPATH`.\n\n3. **Set PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH**:\n   - If needed, you can set `PYTHONHOME` to point to the root of your Python installation, which might be something like `/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7`.\n   - Set `PYTHONPATH` to include the directories where your Python libraries are located, typically `/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7`.\n\n   You can set these variables in your shell configuration file (like `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, or `.zshrc`):\n\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONHOME=/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7\n   export PYTHONPATH=/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7\n   ```\n\n   After editing your configuration file, make sure to source it with `source ~/.bash_profile` or restart your terminal.\n\n4. **Ensure Site Module is Accessible**:\n   - Verify that the `site.py` file exists in `/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7`.\n   - If the file is missing or corrupted, consider reinstalling Python.\n\n5. **Reinstall FontForge and Fontcustom**:\n   - Ensure that FontForge and Fontcustom are installed correctly. Sometimes, a reinstall can resolve path issues.\n   - You can reinstall FontForge using Homebrew:\n     ```bash\n     brew uninstall fontforge\n     brew install fontforge\n     ```\n   - Similarly, reinstall Fontcustom:\n     ```bash\n     gem uninstall fontcustom\n     gem install fontcustom\n     ```\n\n6. **Use Virtual Environments**:\n   - Consider using `virtualenv` to manage Python dependencies. It creates isolated environments, which can help avoid conflicts with system-wide packages.\n\n7. **Check for OSX-Specific Issues**:\n   - Sometimes, specific OSX versions have peculiarities with system paths. Ensure your system is updated to handle known issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with Python not finding the necessary modules. If problems persist, consider seeking help from communities like Stack Overflow with specific error messages and configuration details."
