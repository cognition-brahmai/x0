I want to replace 'long.file.name.jpg' with 'long.file.name_suff.jpg' and 'long.file.name_a.jpg' with 'long.file.name_suff.jpg'. I tried using the following code: `re.sub('(\\_a)?\\.[^\\.]*$' , '_suff.',\"long.file.name.jpg\")`. However, this removes the '.jpg' extension and I end up with 'long.file.name_suff.' instead of 'long.file.name_suff.jpg'. I understand this is due to the [^.]*$ part of my code, but I can't exclude it as I need to find the last occurrence of '_a' to replace or the last '.'. Is there a way to replace only part of the match?"

        "content": "Certainly! The challenge you're facing is due to the fact that your regular expression pattern is matching the file extension as well, which is then replaced by the substitution string. To achieve your goal, you can use a capturing group to selectively replace only the desired part of the match while retaining the file extension.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Pattern to match either '_a' before the extension or just the extension itself\npattern = r'(_a)?(\\.[^.]+)$'\nreplacement = r'_suff\\2'\n\n# Replace in the strings\nresult1 = re.sub(pattern, replacement, \"long.file.name.jpg\")\nresult2 = re.sub(pattern, replacement, \"long.file.name_a.jpg\")\n\nprint(result1)  # Output: long.file.name_suff.jpg\nprint(result2)  # Output: long.file.name_suff.jpg\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The pattern `(_a)?(\\.[^.]+)$` is used:\n  - `(_a)?`: Matches the optional `_a` at the end of the filename before the extension.\n  - `(\\.[^.]+)$`: Captures the file extension (e.g., `.jpg`) using a capturing group `(\\.[^.]+)`. This ensures that the extension itself is not removed.\n  \n- The replacement string `'_suff\\2'`:\n  - `_suff`: Inserts `_suff` into the filename.\n  - `\\2`: Refers to the second capturing group, which is the file extension, ensuring it remains unchanged.\n\nWith this approach, you're effectively inserting `_suff` before the file extension while preserving it, achieving the desired filename format."
