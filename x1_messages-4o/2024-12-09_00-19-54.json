I have tried researching the issue and added 'django.contrib.sites' to my installed apps, however, I am still receiving the same error. Is there an additional step I am missing?

        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that the `django_site` table does not exist in your database. This is a common issue when using the `django.contrib.sites` framework, which is often required by packages like `django-userena`.\n\nHere are the steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Add 'django.contrib.sites' to INSTALLED_APPS:**\n   You've already done this, but make sure it's correctly added. Your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py` should include:\n   ```python\n   INSTALLED_APPS = [\n       ...,\n       'django.contrib.sites',\n       ...,\n   ]\n   ```\n\n2. **Set the SITE_ID:**\n   You need to specify a `SITE_ID` in your `settings.py`:\n   ```python\n   SITE_ID = 1\n   ```\n\n3. **Run Migrations:**\n   Since the `django_site` table is missing, you probably need to run the migrations for the `sites` app:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py migrate sites\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Database:**\n   After running the migrations, check your database to ensure the `django_site` table exists. You can use a database management tool or execute a raw SQL query to verify.\n\n5. **Verify the Site Entry:**\n   Ensure there's an entry in the `django_site` table. You can create or edit the entry through the Django admin interface or by using the Django shell:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py shell\n   ```\n\n   Then run the following commands in the shell:\n   ```python\n   from django.contrib.sites.models import Site\n   Site.objects.create(domain='example.com', name='My Example')\n   ```\n\n6. **Restart the Server:**\n   Sometimes changes may not reflect until you restart your server. Make sure to do so:\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl restart your-server-service\n   ```\n\nIf you've followed these steps and are still encountering issues, it may help to check your database connection settings or look for any errors in the server logs. Additionally, ensure that all migrations have been applied successfully by running:\n```bash\npython manage.py showmigrations\n```\n\nIf any migrations are missing, run them to ensure your database schema is up to date."
