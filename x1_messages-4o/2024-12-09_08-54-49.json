Here is how you can replace the placeholders with valid variable names:\n\n```cpp\nint placeholder1 = 5;\nfloat placeholder2 = 3.14;\n```\n\nYou can use any valid identifier as a variable name. Here's an example with more descriptive names:\n\n```cpp\nint count = 5;\nfloat piValue = 3.14;\n```\n\nJust ensure that the variable names follow the conventions of starting with a letter or underscore, and not using any reserved keywords."
