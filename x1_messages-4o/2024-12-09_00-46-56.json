You supplied 'return a + b'\". How can I correctly apply the mocker function to patch my code? Here is the code I am working with:\n\n```python\n# test_capitalize.py\nimport time\n\ndef sum(a, b):\n    time.sleep(10)\n    return a + b\n\ndef test_sum(mocker):\n    mocker.patch('return a + b');\n    assertEqual(sum(2, 3), 9)\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is because the `mocker.patch()` function requires a valid target to patch, typically in the form of a module path and attribute name, and not an expression like `return a + b`.\n\nHere's how you can correctly use `mocker.patch()` to patch the `time.sleep` function in your `sum` function:\n\n1. You need to specify the correct module path for the `time.sleep` function you want to patch.\n2. Use `mocker.patch()` to replace `time.sleep` with a mock that doesn't actually sleep, which speeds up your test.\n\nHere's how you can modify your test:\n\n```python\n# test_capitalize.py\nimport time\n\ndef sum(a, b):\n    time.sleep(10)\n    return a + b\n\ndef test_sum(mocker):\n    # Patch time.sleep to avoid the actual delay\n    mocker.patch('time.sleep', return_value=None)\n    \n    # Assert the sum function returns the correct result\n    assert sum(2, 3) == 5\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **`mocker.patch('time.sleep', return_value=None)`**: This line replaces the `time.sleep` call within your `sum` function with a mock that does nothing, effectively removing the delay.\n- **Assertion**: Use `assert sum(2, 3) == 5` instead of `assertEqual(sum(2, 3), 9)`. The `sum` function should return `5` for the inputs `2` and `3`. Replace `assertEqual` with `assert` as `assertEqual` is typically used in unittest, not pytest.\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- Ensure that the module name in the `patch()` call matches the import path. If your `sum` function was in another module, you would need to patch `'your_module_path.time.sleep'`.\n- Use descriptive test names and assertions that match the expected behavior of your function for clarity."
