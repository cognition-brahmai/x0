I am able to install packages from the distribution into my environments using the 'conda install...' command. However, for some packages that are not part of the distribution, like Flask-WTF, flask-sqlalchemy, and alembic, I need to use 'pip install' in the active environment. When I check the contents of the environment, either in the directory or using 'conda list', these 'pip install'ed packages don't show up. When I use 'pip freeze' and 'pip list', all the packages I've ever installed are listed. How can I keep track of what is in each of my Anaconda 'env's, both 'pip' and 'conda' installed?"

        "content": "To effectively track packages installed via both `conda` and `pip` in an Anaconda environment, you'll need to consolidate information from both package managers. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:\n\n1. **Activate Your Environment**: First, ensure that you activate the environment you want to inspect. This ensures that any commands you run are targeting the correct environment.\n\n   ```bash\n   conda activate your_environment_name\n   ```\n\n2. **Use `conda list`**: This command lists all packages installed in the environment via `conda`. It includes both `conda` and `pip` installed packages, but it may not always show the detailed information for `pip` installed packages.\n\n   ```bash\n   conda list\n   ```\n\n3. **Use `pip list`**: This command shows all packages installed via `pip` in the active environment. It gives a comprehensive list of `pip`-installed packages including those that were installed as dependencies.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip list\n   ```\n\n4. **Combine Outputs**: To keep a consolidated list of all packages, you can manually combine the outputs of `conda list` and `pip list`. A simple way to do this is to redirect their outputs to separate text files and then manually merge them if needed.\n\n   ```bash\n   conda list > conda_packages.txt\n   pip list > pip_packages.txt\n   ```\n\n5. **Use `pip freeze`**: This command outputs installed packages in a format suitable for requirements files, which can be useful for recreating the environment elsewhere. However, it lists all `pip`-installed packages regardless of the source environment.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip freeze > requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n6. **Create an Environment YAML File**: Conda environments can be exported to a YAML file that captures both `conda` and `pip` installed packages (though pip packages may be under a separate section). This is the most integrated way to capture the complete environment setup.\n\n   ```bash\n   conda env export > environment.yml\n   ```\n\n   The `environment.yml` file will have a `dependencies` section where `conda` packages are listed, and a separate section for `pip` packages.\n\nBy following these steps, you can maintain a clear overview of all the packages installed in your Anaconda environment, regardless of whether they were installed via `conda` or `pip`. This method also assists in sharing or replicating environments across different systems."
