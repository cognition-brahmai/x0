        "content": "To assert that two dictionaries with nested contents are equal in Python using `pytest`, you can utilize the `assert` statement in combination with deep comparison. Since Python dictionaries are inherently unordered, you don't need to worry about the order of elements. However, you must ensure that all nested elements are also compared correctly. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using `assert` with `==`:** Python's equality operator `==` works well with dictionaries and performs a deep comparison by default. This means it will recursively compare nested dictionaries.\n\n2. **Using `pytest` utilities:** If you want better error messages, especially for deeply nested structures, you can use `pytest`'s `assert` with its enhanced assertion introspection.\n\nHere's an example of how you can assert two nested dictionaries are equal:\n\n```python\nimport pytest\n\ndef test_nested_dicts_equality():\n    dict1 = {\n        'key1': 'value1',\n        'key2': {\n            'nestedKey1': 'nestedValue1',\n            'nestedKey2': ['listItem1', 'listItem2']\n        },\n        'key3': 3\n    }\n\n    dict2 = {\n        'key1': 'value1',\n        'key2': {\n            'nestedKey2': ['listItem1', 'listItem2'],\n            'nestedKey1': 'nestedValue1'\n        },\n        'key3': 3\n    }\n\n    assert dict1 == dict2\n\n# This function can be run using pytest to verify that the dictionaries are equal.\n```\n\nIn this example, the order of keys in the dictionaries does not matter. The `assert` statement will ensure that both dictionaries have the same keys and corresponding values, even if they are nested. If there's a mismatch, `pytest` will provide a detailed error message indicating the point of failure. \n\nRemember to run your tests using the `pytest` command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\npytest your_test_file.py\n```\n\nReplace `your_test_file.py` with the name of your Python test file. This will execute the test and show you the results."
