I have a TensorFlow model where I currently evaluate the accuracy using a node in the graph that takes in logits and labels. I can plot the training accuracy and write it out as a scalar summary using the following code:\n\n```python\ntf.scalar_summary(\"Training Accuracy\", accuracy)\ntf.scalar_summary(\"SomethingElse\", foo)\nsummary_op = tf.merge_all_summaries()\nwriter = tf.train.SummaryWriter('/me/mydir/', graph=sess.graph)\n\nfor n in xrange(1000):\n  ...\n  summary, ..., ... = sess.run([summary_op, ..., ...], feed_dict)\n  writer.add_summary(summary, n)\n  ...\n```\n\nHowever, I am unsure how to do the same for the validation accuracy which I evaluate every 100 iterations using a separate feed_dict. How can I make another summary for the validation accuracy using the accuracy node?"

        "content": "To plot both training and validation accuracy on the same graph in TensorFlow, you can create separate scalar summaries for each and then merge them. You can achieve this by creating two different accuracy calculations and corresponding summary operations, one for training and one for validation. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code to accommodate this:\n\n1. **Define Separate Placeholders for Training and Validation:**\n\nFirst, ensure you have separate placeholders or nodes to compute accuracy for the training and validation datasets.\n\n2. **Create Separate Summary Operations:**\n\nYou will need to create separate summary operations for training and validation accuracy.\n\n3. **Log and Write Summaries:**\n\nWithin your training loop, compute and log the training accuracy at every step, and compute and log the validation accuracy every 100 steps or as required.\n\nHere's a modified code example for clarity:\n\n```python\n# Define placeholders or nodes for accuracy calculations\n# Assume `logits` and `labels` are defined elsewhere for both training and validation datasets\n\n# Training accuracy\ntrain_accuracy = # Define your training accuracy calculation here\ntf.summary.scalar(\"Training Accuracy\", train_accuracy)\n\n# Validation accuracy\nval_accuracy = # Define your validation accuracy calculation here\ntf.summary.scalar(\"Validation Accuracy\", val_accuracy)\n\n# Merge all summaries\nsummary_op = tf.summary.merge_all()\n\n# Create a summary writer\nwriter = tf.summary.FileWriter('/me/mydir/', graph=sess.graph)\n\nfor n in range(1000):\n    # Compute training accuracy and write summary\n    summary, _ = sess.run([summary_op, train_op], feed_dict=train_feed_dict)\n    writer.add_summary(summary, n)\n\n    # Compute validation accuracy every 100 iterations\n    if n % 100 == 0:\n        val_summary = sess.run(summary_op, feed_dict=val_feed_dict)\n        writer.add_summary(val_summary, n)\n\nwriter.close()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Separate Accuracy Calculations:** Ensure you have separate nodes or calculations for training and validation accuracy.\n- **Scalar Summaries:** Create scalar summaries for both training and validation accuracy.\n- **Conditional Logging:** Log validation accuracy at specific intervals (e.g., every 100 iterations) to avoid excessive computation during training.\n\nThis setup will allow you to visualize both training and validation accuracy on the same graph using TensorBoard, providing insights into how well your model is performing on both datasets over time."
