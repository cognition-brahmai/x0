Highlight the `Student Name` and `Study Hours`, then go to `Insert` > `Chart` > select a chart type, such as a bar chart.\n\n### Sample Table Code in Excel:\n\nHere's a sample of how your Excel table might look in terms of formulas:\n```excel\n| A              | B          | C                  | D                     | E                     | F            |\n|----------------|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------|\n| Student Name   | Study Hours| Average Study Hours| Deviation from Average| Significant Deviation | Attendance (%) |\n| John Doe       | 5          | =AVERAGE($B$2:$B$10)| =B2 - C2              | =IF(ABS(D2) > 2, \"Yes\", \"No\") | 90%         |\n| Jane Smith     | 7          | =AVERAGE($B$2:$B$10)| =B3 - C3              | =IF(ABS(D3) > 2, \"Yes\", \"No\") | 85%         |\n| ...            | ...        | ...                | ...                   | ...                   | ...          |\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- Adjust the range `$B$2:$B$10` based on your actual data range.\n- You can modify the \"significant deviation\" threshold according to your requirements.\n- This setup allows you to quickly see who is deviating from the average and their attendance rates.\n\nBy using this setup, you enable efficient tracking and management of student progress and attendance, with clear visual indicators of any significant deviations."
