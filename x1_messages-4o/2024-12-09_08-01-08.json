I've tried to use the package `nnet` successfully but `neuralnet` doesn't seem to be working for me. Despite reading the documentation, I can't seem to find a solution. I've tried using the same backpropagation algorithm as `nnet`, changing the activation function, and many other things but the results are still the same. Can someone help me understand why the `nnet` works while `neuralnet` doesn't? The data I'm working with is a binary classification from UCI, and I've converted it into a matrix with numerical values. Even after training, the summary of predicted values shows that the minimum, first quartile, median, mean, and third quartile values are virtually the same. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test (area under the curve) shows that the prediction performance is virtually the same as a random prediction."

        "content": "When you encounter a situation where predictions from a neural network are all the same, it often suggests an issue with the training process. Here are some potential reasons and solutions for why you might be experiencing this with the `neuralnet` package in R, while `nnet` works as expected:\n\n1. **Initialization of Weights**: Ensure that the weights are being initialized properly. If the weights are all initialized to the same values or very small values, it can lead to the network failing to learn. You might want to try different random seeds or explicitly set weight initialization if the package allows.\n\n2. **Scaling of Input Data**: Make sure your input data is properly scaled. Neural networks, especially those using sigmoid or tanh activation functions, perform better when input features are normalized (e.g., to a range of 0 to 1 or -1 to 1). \n\n3. **Learning Rate**: The learning rate might be too high or too low. Experiment with different learning rates to see if that resolves the issue.\n\n4. **Hidden Layers and Neurons**: Check the architecture of your neural network. If you're using too few neurons or layers, the model might not have enough capacity to learn. Conversely, too many neurons can lead to overfitting, though this typically doesn\u2019t cause the issue of identical predictions.\n\n5. **Activation Function**: Since you mentioned you've tried different activation functions, ensure that the chosen function is suitable for your problem. For binary classification, sigmoid activation is common for the output layer.\n\n6. **Convergence Criteria**: Check the stopping criteria for the training. If the criteria are too loose, training might stop prematurely before the network has learned meaningful patterns.\n\n7. **Data Issues**: Double-check your dataset for any issues, such as one class being heavily imbalanced or features being highly correlated, which might lead to poor learning.\n\n8. **Overfitting/Underfitting**: Consider using regularization techniques if overfitting is suspected, or increase the complexity of the model if underfitting is the issue.\n\n9. **Debugging Process**: Try to reduce the problem to a simpler dataset or a smaller model to understand where the issue lies. You can also visualize the loss during training to see if it's decreasing as expected.\n\n10. **Comparison with `nnet`**: Since `nnet` works, try to compare the configurations (like network architecture, learning rate, input scaling) between the two packages to identify what's different.\n\nIf these suggestions don't resolve the issue, consider sharing specific code snippets or data examples to get more targeted advice."
