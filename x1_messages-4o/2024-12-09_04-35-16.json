I am using GDAL and Matplotlib `contourf` function to create the plot from a GeoTIFF Digital Elevation Model I downloaded from a website. My problem is that the contour lines are \"white\", which generate some visual pollution. I would like to modify the way `contourf` creates these lighter lines, either via parameter setting or via hack. Is there a way to hide the contour line stroke on pyplot.contourf to get only fills? \n\nHere's the code I am currently using:\n\n```python\nfrom osgeo import gdal\nimport matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pylab import cm\nimport numpy\n\nf = 'rs.tif'\n\nelev = gdal.Open(f)\n\na = elev.GetRasterBand(1).ReadAsArray()\n\nw = elev.RasterXSize\nh = elev.RasterYSize\nprint w, h\n\naltura  = (0.35, 0.42)\nlargura = (0.70, 0.82)\n\na = a[int(h*altura[0]):int(h*altura[1]),\n      int(w*largura[0]):int(w*largura[1])]\n\n\ncont = plt.contourf(a, origin='upper', cmap=cm.gist_earth, levels=numpy.arange(0,1000,20))\nplt.title('Altitudes - max: %d m; min: %d m' % (numpy.amax(a), numpy.amin(a)))\nplt.show()\n```"

        "content": "The `contourf` function in Matplotlib is specifically designed to fill contours without drawing the contour lines. However, sometimes it might seem like there are lines due to the color transitions between different contour levels. If you're seeing lines, it might be due to the color map or the levels chosen. \n\nTo ensure that only the fills are shown and no contour lines are drawn, you can adjust the levels and colormap. You can also make sure that you're not confusing contour line artifacts with color transitions. If you're still seeing the lines, here are a few adjustments you can make:\n\n1. **Use `contourf` without `contour`**: Ensure you're only using `contourf` and not `contour` in the same plot. `contour` is used to draw the contour lines.\n\n2. **Adjust the colormap**: Sometimes the lines might appear due to sharp transitions in the colormap. Try using a smoother colormap or adjusting the levels.\n\n3. **Set the `extend` parameter**: If you have data that goes beyond the levels, `extend='both'` can help with smoother transitions.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom osgeo import gdal\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import cm\n\nf = 'rs.tif'\n\n# Open the GeoTIFF file\nelev = gdal.Open(f)\n\n# Read the first band as an array\na = elev.GetRasterBand(1).ReadAsArray()\n\nw = elev.RasterXSize\nh = elev.RasterYSize\nprint(w, h)\n\n# Define the slice of the array you want to plot\naltura = (0.35, 0.42)\nlargura = (0.70, 0.82)\n\na = a[int(h * altura[0]):int(h * altura[1]),\n      int(w * largura[0]):int(w * largura[1])]\n\n# Use contourf to create filled contours\ncont = plt.contourf(a, origin='upper', cmap=cm.gist_earth, levels=np.arange(0, 1000, 20), extend='both')\n\n# Add a colorbar for reference\nplt.colorbar(cont)\n\n# Set the title\nplt.title('Altitudes - max: %d m; min: %d m' % (np.amax(a), np.amin(a)))\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nKey points:\n- Ensure that `levels` are well defined to avoid abrupt color changes.\n- Use a colormap that has smooth transitions.\n- Make sure you're not using any additional lines or settings that might add contour lines accidentally.\n\nIf the issue persists, it might be worth checking the visualization on a different display or environment to ensure it's not a rendering artifact."
