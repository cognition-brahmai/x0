However, when I try to access the `functions` module from within `expander` and `language_id` using `from ..utilities.functions import *`, I get the following error:\n\n```\nValueError: Attempted relative import beyond toplevel package\n```\n\nEven though it seems to follow the documentation, I can't figure out what's going wrong. Can you help me understand this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with relative imports in Python is related to how Python handles module imports based on the script's execution context. When you run a script directly, it doesn't consider the package structure in the same way as it does when you're importing modules within a package. This is often why relative imports can be tricky.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening and how you can resolve it:\n\n1. **Understanding the Error:**\n   - The error `ValueError: Attempted relative import beyond toplevel package` occurs because when you run `main.py` directly, Python treats `main.py` as the top-level script and doesn't recognize the surrounding `src` directory as a package.\n   - Therefore, when `expander.py` or `language_id.py` tries to perform a relative import like `from ..utilities.functions import *`, Python interprets it as trying to go above the top-level script, which is not allowed.\n\n2. **Solutions:**\n\n   **Option 1: Use Absolute Imports**\n   - Modify your import statements in `expander.py` and `language_id.py` to use absolute imports instead of relative imports. This means you should write:\n     ```python\n     from utilities.functions import *\n     ```\n   - This requires you to ensure that `src` is in your Python path. You can achieve this by setting the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable or by running Python with the `-m` flag.\n\n   **Option 2: Change Your Execution Method**\n   - Instead of running `main.py` directly, run it as a module using the `-m` flag:\n     ```bash\n     python -m src.main\n     ```\n   - This approach treats the `src` directory as a package, allowing relative imports to work correctly.\n\n   **Option 3: Modify the Python Path Programmatically**\n   - You can modify the `sys.path` within `main.py` to include the `src` directory:\n     ```python\n     import sys\n     from pathlib import Path\n\n     # Add the src directory to sys.path\n     sys.path.append(str(Path(__file__).resolve().parent))\n\n     from components.expander import *\n     from components.language_id import *\n     ```\n\n3. **Recommendation:**\n   - Using absolute imports is generally more robust and less error-prone, especially for larger projects. It helps avoid issues with relative paths and makes your code easier to understand and maintain.\n\nBy adopting one of these solutions, you should be able to access the `functions` module from `expander.py` and `language_id.py` without encountering the import error."
