Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport codecs\n\n# Raw string representation\nraw_string = '\\\\x89\\\\n'\n\n# Decode the raw string\ndecoded_string = codecs.decode(raw_string, 'unicode_escape')\n\nprint(decoded_string)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, `decoded_string` will contain `'\\x89\\n'`, which is the desired output. The `unicode_escape` codec interprets the escape sequences in the string, converting them into the corresponding characters."
