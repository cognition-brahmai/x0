I have attempted the task with the following code but it doesn't seem to work.

        "content": "Certainly! It looks like there's a small syntax issue in your code. The correct way to check if a substring is present in a string in Python is to use the `in` keyword without the `is`. Also, make sure the indentation is correct and that you're using parentheses for the `print` function if you're using Python 3. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndog = \"xdasds\"\nif \"x\" in dog:\n    print(\"Yes!\")\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the corrected code:\n\n- `if \"x\" in dog:` checks if the character `'x'` is present in the string `dog`.\n- `print(\"Yes!\")` is the correct way to print in Python 3. If you're using Python 2, you can omit the parentheses, but using parentheses is a good practice for forward compatibility with Python 3.\n\nThis should correctly print \"Yes!\" if the letter `'x'` is found in the string `dog`."
