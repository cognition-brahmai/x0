I have set `DEBUG = False` in `settings.py`, therefore, `connections['default'].queries` is not constantly growing to a point where it consumes all memory. \n\nI have loaded the `User` table from `django.contrib.auth.models.User` with 10,000 users (each named 'test#' where # is a number between 1 and 10,000). I have attached the view to the `/leak/` URL and started the development server with `DEBUG=False`. \n\nWhen I run the command `% curl http://localhost:8000/leak/`, the `runserver` process' memory grows to a certain size and stays at that level. The memory isn't getting released to the system. Why is Django queryset behaving differently from a simple Python session where large chunks of memory get released after deletion?\n\nHere's the view I am using:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse\nimport time\n\ndef leak(request):\n    print \"loading users\"\n\n    users = []\n    users += list(User.objects.all())\n    users += list(User.objects.all())\n    users += list(User.objects.all())\n    users += list(User.objects.all())\n    users += list(User.objects.all())\n    users += list(User.objects.all())\n    users += list(User.objects.all())\n    users += list(User.objects.all())\n    users += list(User.objects.all())\n    users += list(User.objects.all())\n    users += list(User.objects.all())\n    users += list(User.objects.all())\n    users += list(User.objects.all())\n    users += list(User.objects.all())\n    users += list(User.objects.all())\n    users += list(User.objects.all())\n\n    print \"sleeping\"\n    time.sleep(10)\n\n    return HttpResponse('')\n```\n\nAlso, I'm using Python version 2.6.5."

        "content": "The behavior you're experiencing is related to how Python manages memory, particularly when using older versions like Python 2.6.5, and how Django handles database queries and memory allocation.\n\n**Key Points to Consider:**\n\n1. **Memory Management in Python:**\n   - Python's memory management is handled by the Python memory manager, and the memory allocation strategy can differ between versions.\n   - Python 2.6.5 does not have the same level of efficiency in memory management as later versions, which might lead to memory not being released as expected.\n\n2. **Garbage Collection:**\n   - Python uses a garbage collector to manage memory, but it does not always immediately return memory to the system. Instead, it keeps it for future allocations.\n   - Large objects or a large number of objects might lead to fragmentation and the memory might not be immediately released back to the OS after they are no longer needed.\n\n3. **Django's QuerySet Behavior:**\n   - Each call to `User.objects.all()` creates a new QuerySet and loads all user records into memory.\n   - You are repeatedly loading a large number of user records (10,000 users, 16 times), which can consume significant memory.\n   - The `users` list retains references to these objects until it is garbage collected.\n\n4. **Memory Usage in the Development Server:**\n   - The Django development server is not optimized for production use and may not handle memory as efficiently as a production server setup.\n   - Memory usage might appear high because the server process retains memory for reuse rather than releasing it immediately.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Optimize Query Usage:**\n   - Avoid loading all user records repeatedly. If possible, reduce the number of times you call `User.objects.all()`.\n   - Consider using `iterator()` to fetch the records in a memory-efficient manner if you need to process a large number of records.\n\n2. **Upgrade Python:**\n   - Consider upgrading to a more recent version of Python, as Python 2.6.5 is outdated and lacks many improvements and optimizations found in newer versions.\n\n3. **Profile Memory Usage:**\n   - Use tools like `objgraph`, `guppy`, or `memory_profiler` to analyze and understand memory usage patterns in your application.\n\n4. **Production Setup:**\n   - For more realistic memory usage, test your application in an environment that mirrors your production setup (e.g., using a WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI).\n\nBy addressing these points, you should be able to manage memory usage more effectively in your Django application."
