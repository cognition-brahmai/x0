        "content": "To create a logic puzzle about grocery discounts, let's first outline the various ways a shopper can save money on their grocery bill aside from a 20% discount:\n\n1. **Loyalty Programs**: Many stores offer loyalty programs where shoppers earn points for purchases, which can be redeemed for discounts.\n2. **Coupons**: Both digital and paper coupons can provide discounts on specific items.\n3. **Bulk Purchase Discounts**: Buying in larger quantities often results in a lower price per unit.\n4. **Store Promotions**: These could include \"Buy One, Get One Free\" (BOGO) offers.\n5. **Cashback Offers**: Credit card companies or apps sometimes offer cashback on grocery purchases.\n6. **Price Matching**: Some stores match the lower prices of competitors.\n7. **Clearance Sales**: Discounted items that are nearing expiration.\n8. **Seasonal Discounts**: Special discounts during certain seasons or holidays.\n9. **Senior Citizen or Student Discounts**: Certain demographics may receive additional discounts.\n10. **Online Shopping Discounts**: Using promo codes while shopping online.\n\n### Logic Puzzle\n\n**Puzzle Challenge:**\nYou have a grocery bill of $200. Besides the 20% store-wide discount, the store offers the following additional discounts:\n\n- A $10 off coupon for purchases over $50.\n- A 10% discount on all dairy products (total dairy bill is $40).\n- A BOGO offer on a $10 cereal (limit one free box).\n- A 5% cashback using a specific credit card.\n\n**Objective:**\nDetermine the most effective way to apply these discounts to minimize the total bill. Which discounts should be applied in what order to maximize savings? What is the final amount paid and the total savings?\n\n### Solution\n\n1. **Apply Store-wide Discount**:\n   - Initial bill: $200\n   - 20% store-wide discount: $200 \u00d7 0.20 = $40\n   - New bill: $200 - $40 = $160\n\n2. **Apply Dairy Discount**:\n   - Dairy bill: $40\n   - 10% off on dairy: $40 \u00d7 0.10 = $4\n   - New dairy bill: $40 - $4 = $36\n   - Total bill after dairy discount: $160 - $4 = $156\n\n3. **Apply $10 Off Coupon**:\n   - Since the bill is over $50, apply the coupon.\n   - New bill: $156 - $10 = $146\n\n4. **Apply BOGO Offer**:\n   - Buy one cereal for $10, get one free.\n   - Savings: $10\n   - No direct effect on total bill since it's already considered in the initial amount.\n\n5. **Apply Cashback**:\n   - 5% cashback on the final bill: $146 \u00d7 0.05 = $7.30\n   - Final effective bill after cashback: $146 - $7.30 = $138.70\n\n### Total Savings Calculation\n\n1. Store-wide discount: $40\n2. Dairy discount: $4\n3. Coupon: $10\n4. BOGO Savings: $10\n5. Cashback: $7.30\n\n**Total Savings = $40 + $4 + $10 + $10 + $7.30 = $71.30**\n\n**Minimum Number of Mathematical Operations:**\nTo calculate savings, you need to perform the following operations:\n- Multiplication for each percentage discount (3 operations).\n- Subtraction for applying each discount (5 operations).\n- Total: 8 mathematical operations.\n\nBy using these strategies and applying the discounts in an optimal order, the shopper can maximize their savings on the grocery bill."
