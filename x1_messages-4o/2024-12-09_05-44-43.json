Most other loss functions require outputs and labels of the same shape, but this one doesn't seem to. I'm receiving an InvalidArgumentError stating that I've received a label value of 2 which is outside the valid range of [0, 2). How do I provide proper parameters to the SparseCategoricalCrossentropy loss function in TensorFlow?\n\nHere is the code I'm using:\n\n```\nimport tensorflow as tf;\n\nscce = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy();\nLoss = scce(\n  tf.constant([ 1,    1,    1,    2   ], tf.float32),\n  tf.constant([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]], tf.float32)\n);\nprint(\"Loss:\", Loss.numpy());\n```\n\nAnd here is the error:\n\n```\nInvalidArgumentError: Received a label value of 2 which is outside the valid range of [0, 2).  \nLabel values: 1 1 1 2 [Op:SparseSoftmaxCrossEntropyWithLogits]\n```"

        "content": "The `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` loss function in TensorFlow expects the following:\n\n1. **Labels**: These should be integer values corresponding to the class indices. They should range from 0 to `num_classes - 1`.\n\n2. **Predictions**: These should be the logits or probabilities for each class. Typically, they are a 2D array where each row corresponds to a sample and each column corresponds to a class. The number of columns should be equal to `num_classes`.\n\nIn your code, the labels are `[1, 1, 1, 2]` and the predictions are `[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]`. The error suggests that the label `2` is out of the valid range, meaning your model predictions are indicating only two classes (0 and 1), but you have a label `2` which indicates a third class. Here\u2019s how you can address this:\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Number of Classes**: If you indeed have three classes (0, 1, and 2), ensure your predictions reflect this by having three columns. For instance, predictions might look like `[[0.1, 0.6, 0.3], [0.2, 0.3, 0.5], [0.7, 0.1, 0.2], [0.5, 0.2, 0.3]]`.\n\n2. **Match the Number of Classes**: If you meant to have two classes, then the labels should be within `[0, 1]`.\n\nHere is an example of how you might adjust your code if you intended to have three classes:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assume you have 3 classes, so predictions should have 3 columns.\npredictions = tf.constant([[0.1, 0.6, 0.3],\n                           [0.2, 0.3, 0.5],\n                           [0.7, 0.1, 0.2],\n                           [0.5, 0.2, 0.3]], dtype=tf.float32)\n\n# Labels should be integers indicating the class index.\nlabels = tf.constant([1, 1, 1, 2], dtype=tf.int32)\n\nscce = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy()\nloss = scce(labels, predictions)\nprint(\"Loss:\", loss.numpy())\n```\n\nEnsure that the `predictions` have the correct shape and the values are consistent with the number of classes you are working with. Also, remember that `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` expects labels as integers, not one-hot encoded vectors."
