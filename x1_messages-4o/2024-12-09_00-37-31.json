        "content": "In Python, you can convert a negative number to a positive one using the built-in `abs()` function. The `abs()` function returns the absolute value of a number, which is always positive or zero. If the number is already positive, `abs()` will leave it unchanged.\n\nHere's an example to demonstrate how it works:\n\n```python\ndef make_positive(number):\n    return abs(number)\n\n# Test examples\nnumber1 = -5\nnumber2 = 10\n\npositive_number1 = make_positive(number1)  # This will be 5\npositive_number2 = make_positive(number2)  # This will remain 10\n\nprint(positive_number1)  # Output: 5\nprint(positive_number2)  # Output: 10\n```\n\nIn this example, `make_positive()` takes a number as input and returns its absolute value. This ensures that the number is always positive regardless of whether it was originally negative or positive."
