I'm currently using the dict.get('keyword') method to interrogate a nested dictionary, and using a for loop to iterate over the results. However, my script fails when a key like \"parent\" or \"child\" does not exist. Even when I use a default value with the get() method, the chained .get() call fails when the key does not exist. The current solution I am using involves multiple try-except blocks around each .get() call, but this seems impractical. Is there a way to default return a value like \"skip\" or \"pass\" that would still support chaining and fail intelligently, rather than attempting to access keys that do not exist? I would ideally like to use a list comprehension for this task.\n\n<pre><code>\nM = cursor_object_results_of_db_query\n\nfor m in M:\n    X = m.get(\"gparents\").get(\"parent\").get(\"child\")\n    for x in X:\n        y = x.get(\"key\")\n</code></pre>"

        "content": "To handle chained, nested dictionary accesses where some keys might not exist, you can use a function that safely traverses the dictionary, returning a default value if any key in the chain is missing. This allows you to avoid multiple try-except blocks or deeply nested if statements. One approach is to use a helper function like `nested_get`, which you can incorporate into list comprehensions or loops as needed.\n\nHere's how you can implement `nested_get`:\n\n```python\ndef nested_get(d, keys, default=None):\n    \"\"\"Safely get a nested dictionary value and return a default if any key is missing.\"\"\"\n    for key in keys:\n        if isinstance(d, dict):\n            d = d.get(key, default)\n        else:\n            return default\n    return d\n\n# Example usage\nM = cursor_object_results_of_db_query\n\nfor m in M:\n    # Use the helper function to get a nested value\n    X = nested_get(m, [\"gparents\", \"parent\", \"child\"], default=[])\n    \n    # Check if X is iterable, and if not, skip iteration\n    if X:\n        for x in X:\n            y = x.get(\"key\")\n            # Process y as needed\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Definition (`nested_get`)**: \n   - The function takes three arguments: the dictionary `d`, a list of `keys` to traverse, and a `default` value to return if any key is not found.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Keys**:\n   - Loop through each key in the provided `keys` list.\n   - Use `get()` to attempt to retrieve the value for each key.\n   - If at any point `d` is not a dictionary, return the `default` value immediately.\n\n3. **Return Value**:\n   - If all keys are found, the function returns the final value.\n   - If any key is missing, it returns the specified `default` value, which can be an empty list, a string like `\"skip\"`, or any other placeholder that suits your needs.\n\n4. **Usage in Loop**:\n   - Use the `nested_get` function within the loop to retrieve nested values safely.\n   - Check if the result (`X`) is what you expect (e.g., a list) before further processing.\n\nThis method allows you to chain dictionary accesses safely and efficiently, making your code cleaner and more robust."
