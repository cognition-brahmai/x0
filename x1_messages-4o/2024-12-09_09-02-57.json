        "content": "To create a database table for storing student records, you can use SQL (Structured Query Language). Below is an example of how you could define a simple table structure for storing student information:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Students (\n    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n    DateOfBirth DATE NOT NULL,\n    Gender ENUM('Male', 'Female', 'Other') NOT NULL,\n    Email VARCHAR(100),\n    PhoneNumber VARCHAR(15),\n    Address TEXT,\n    EnrollmentDate DATE NOT NULL\n);\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the fields in this table:\n\n- `StudentID`: A unique identifier for each student. It's an integer and uses `AUTO_INCREMENT` to automatically generate a new ID for each new record.\n- `FirstName`: The first name of the student, stored as a variable-length string with a maximum length of 50 characters.\n- `LastName`: The last name of the student, similar to `FirstName`.\n- `DateOfBirth`: The student's date of birth, stored in the `DATE` format.\n- `Gender`: The student's gender, using an `ENUM` type to restrict values to 'Male', 'Female', or 'Other'.\n- `Email`: The student's email address, stored as a string with a maximum length of 100 characters.\n- `PhoneNumber`: The student's phone number, stored as a string with a maximum length of 15 characters.\n- `Address`: The student's address, stored as a text field to accommodate longer entries.\n- `EnrollmentDate`: The date the student enrolled, stored in the `DATE` format.\n\nYou can adjust the structure according to your specific requirements, such as adding more fields or changing data types."
