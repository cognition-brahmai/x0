        "content": "To write a Swift program that calculates the sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers, you can use a simple formula or iterate through a loop to accumulate the sum. Here's how you can implement both methods:\n\n### Using the Formula\nThe sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1)}{2} \\]\n\nHere's how you can implement it in Swift:\n\n```swift\nfunc sumOfNaturalNumbers(n: Int) -> Int {\n    return n * (n + 1) / 2\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nlet n = 10\nlet sum = sumOfNaturalNumbers(n: n)\nprint(\"The sum of the first \\(n) natural numbers is \\(sum).\")\n```\n\n### Using a Loop\nAlternatively, you can calculate the sum by iterating through the numbers:\n\n```swift\nfunc sumOfNaturalNumbersUsingLoop(n: Int) -> Int {\n    var sum = 0\n    for i in 1...n {\n        sum += i\n    }\n    return sum\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nlet n = 10\nlet sum = sumOfNaturalNumbersUsingLoop(n: n)\nprint(\"The sum of the first \\(n) natural numbers is \\(sum).\")\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you the correct sum. The formula method is more efficient as it calculates the result in constant time \\( O(1) \\), while the loop method takes linear time \\( O(n) \\)."
