        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the backend that Matplotlib is using for rendering the figures in your Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebooks generally use the `inline` backend to display figures directly within the notebook interface. It seems like you've made a small typo in your magic command. \n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. Correct the magic command typo: Replace `%matplot inline` with `%matplotlib inline`. This will ensure that Matplotlib uses the correct inline backend for Jupyter Notebook.\n\n2. Use `plt.show()` instead of `fig.show()`: While `fig.show()` might work in some environments, it\u2019s generally recommended to use `plt.show()` to display the figures in Jupyter Notebooks.\n\nHere's the corrected portion of your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\n# Assuming performance_metric is already defined elsewhere in your code.\n\n%matplotlib inline\n\ndef learning_curves(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test):\n    \"\"\" Calculates the performance of several models with varying sizes of training data.\n    The learning and testing error rates for each model are then plotted. \"\"\"\n\n    print (\"Creating learning curve graphs for max_depths of 1, 3, 6, and 10. . .\")\n\n    # Create the figure window\n    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\n\n    # We will vary the training set size so that we have 50 different sizes\n    sizes = np.rint(np.linspace(1, len(X_train), 50)).astype(int)\n    train_err = np.zeros(len(sizes))\n    test_err = np.zeros(len(sizes))\n\n    # Create four different models based on max_depth\n    for k, depth in enumerate([1, 3, 6, 10]):\n\n        for i, s in enumerate(sizes):\n\n            # Setup a decision tree regressor so that it learns a tree with max_depth = depth\n            regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=depth)\n\n            # Fit the learner to the training data\n            regressor.fit(X_train[:s], y_train[:s])\n\n            # Find the performance on the training set\n            train_err[i] = performance_metric(y_train[:s], regressor.predict(X_train[:s]))\n\n            # Find the performance on the testing set\n            test_err[i] = performance_metric(y_test, regressor.predict(X_test))\n\n        # Subplot the learning curve graph\n        ax = fig.add_subplot(2, 2, k+1)\n\n        ax.plot(sizes, test_err, lw=2, label='Testing Error')\n        ax.plot(sizes, train_err, lw=2, label='Training Error')\n        ax.legend()\n        ax.set_title('max_depth = %s' % (depth))\n        ax.set_xlabel('Number of Data Points in Training Set')\n        ax.set_ylabel('Total Error')\n        ax.set_xlim([0, len(X_train)])\n\n    # Visual aesthetics\n    fig.suptitle('Decision Tree Regressor Learning Performances', fontsize=18, y=1.03)\n    fig.tight_layout()\n    plt.show()\n```\n\nThis should resolve the warning and display your plots correctly within the notebook."
