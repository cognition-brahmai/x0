I am trying to parse this to a datetime object using strptime function in Python, but I'm encountering an error: 'redefinition of group name 'M' as group 5; was group 2'. I have used the following format '%Y-%M-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'. Is there a standard function available to solve this? I observed that there might be a typo in the format string where the first %M should be %m. How can I correct this?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the incorrect format specifier in your `strptime` function call. In the format string, `%M` represents minutes, while `%m` represents the month. The error occurs because the `%M` specifier is incorrectly used for the month, leading to a conflict in group names.\n\nHere's how you can correct the format string:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ntimestamp = '2012-03-01T10:00:00Z'\nformat_string = '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'\n\n# Parsing the timestamp to a datetime object\ndatetime_object = datetime.strptime(timestamp, format_string)\n\nprint(datetime_object)\n```\n\nIn this corrected format string:\n- `%Y` matches the year (e.g., 2012),\n- `%m` matches the month (e.g., 03),\n- `%d` matches the day (e.g., 01),\n- `%H` matches the hour (e.g., 10),\n- `%M` matches the minutes (e.g., 00),\n- `%S` matches the seconds (e.g., 00),\n- The `T` and `Z` are literals in the timestamp format.\n\nThis should parse the timestamp correctly without any errors."
