        "content": "To determine the final price John will pay for the phone, we need to apply the applicable discounts in sequence. John is eligible for the senior discount (20% off) and the veteran discount ($50 off).\n\n1. **Apply the senior discount (20% off):**\n   - The base price of the phone is $500.\n   - The senior discount is 20% of $500.\n   - 20% of $500 is \\(0.20 \\times 500 = $100\\).\n   - Subtract the discount from the base price: \\(500 - 100 = $400\\).\n\n2. **Apply the veteran discount ($50 off):**\n   - The price after the senior discount is $400.\n   - Subtract the $50 veteran discount: \\(400 - 50 = $350\\).\n\nTherefore, the final price John will pay for the phone is **$350**."
