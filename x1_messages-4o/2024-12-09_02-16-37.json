Flask does not have a direct equivalent to CherryPy's `default` method, but you can use route parameters and wildcard rules to handle any unspecified paths. Here's an example of how you can implement a default route in Flask:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/<path:subpath>', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef catch_all(subpath):\n    # Handle the request for the unspecified path\n    return f\"You have accessed the path: {subpath}\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nIn this setup:\n\n- The `/<path:subpath>` route acts as a catch-all for any path that isn't explicitly defined in your Flask application.\n- The `subpath` variable captures the entire path following the base URL.\n- This handler will respond to all HTTP methods unless you specify otherwise.\n\nThis approach allows you to handle routes dynamically much like the `default` method in CherryPy."
