In VB/VBA, \"Some string\" + Null results to Null while \"Some string\" & Null results to \"Some string\". I want to concatenate a required LastName and an optional FirstName values with a comma and space in between. If FirstName is None (Python's equivalent of VB/VBA's Null), I want the FullName to be set to LastName with no trailing comma. Is there a one-liner idiomatic way to do this in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, you can achieve the equivalent functionality using a conditional expression to handle the `None` value. You can use a one-liner that checks if the `FirstName` is `None` and constructs the `FullName` accordingly. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nLastName = \"Doe\"\nFirstName = None  # or some name, e.g., \"John\"\n\nFullName = f\"{LastName}{', ' + FirstName if FirstName is not None else ''}\"\n\nprint(FullName)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- We use an f-string to format the `FullName`.\n- The expression `', ' + FirstName if FirstName is not None else ''` checks if `FirstName` is not `None`. If it is not `None`, it concatenates `', '` with `FirstName`. If it is `None`, it appends an empty string, effectively omitting the comma and space.\n\nThis approach is both concise and idiomatic for handling optional values in Python."
