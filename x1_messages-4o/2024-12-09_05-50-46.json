        "content": "I am working on a machine learning task specifically for audio classification using a neural net. I am trying to obtain single vector feature representations for audio files. I have been using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) as a feature descriptor but I am having trouble converting the MFCC representation which is typically a matrix into a single feature vector. I am using librosa for this task. Also, my audio files vary in their shape as shown below:\n\n```python\nfor filename in os.listdir('data'):\n    y, sr = librosa.load('data/' + filename)\n    print filename, librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr).shape\n\n213493.ogg (20, 2375)\n120093.ogg (20, 7506)\n174576.ogg (20, 2482)\n194439.ogg (20, 14)\n107936.ogg (20, 2259)\n```\n\nIf this was a computer vision task, I would quantize these coefficients by doing k-means and then use something like scipy.cluster.vq to get vectors of identical shape for input to my neural net. Is this the right approach for the audio classification as well, or are there different or better approaches?"

        "content": "When dealing with audio classification tasks, obtaining a fixed-size feature vector from variable-length audio files is indeed a common challenge. Using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) is a good choice for feature extraction, but as you've noticed, it results in matrices of varying lengths due to different audio file durations.\n\nHere are a few approaches you can consider to convert the MFCC matrix into a fixed-size feature vector suitable for input into a neural network:\n\n1. **Statistical Aggregation**:\n   - Compute statistical measures such as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis across the time frames for each MFCC coefficient. This will convert your MFCC matrix into a fixed-size vector.\n   ```python\n   import numpy as np\n\n   def extract_features(y, sr):\n       mfcc = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr)\n       mfcc_mean = np.mean(mfcc, axis=1)\n       mfcc_std = np.std(mfcc, axis=1)\n       mfcc_skew = scipy.stats.skew(mfcc, axis=1)\n       mfcc_kurtosis = scipy.stats.kurtosis(mfcc, axis=1)\n       feature_vector = np.concatenate((mfcc_mean, mfcc_std, mfcc_skew, mfcc_kurtosis))\n       return feature_vector\n   ```\n\n2. **Pooling**:\n   - Use techniques like max pooling, average pooling, or global average pooling to reduce the matrix into a fixed-size vector.\n   ```python\n   def extract_features(y, sr):\n       mfcc = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr)\n       pooled_mfcc = np.max(mfcc, axis=1)\n       return pooled_mfcc\n   ```\n\n3. **Temporal Modeling**:\n   - Use a recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), or gated recurrent unit (GRU) to model the temporal dynamics of the MFCC features. You can input the entire MFCC matrix into such a model, which can learn to handle sequences of different lengths.\n\n4. **Bag of Audio Words**:\n   - Similar to your k-means approach in computer vision, you can use a \"bag of audio words\" approach. Cluster the MFCC features across your dataset, then represent each audio file by a histogram of the cluster assignments.\n\n5. **Learned Embeddings**:\n   - Use a pre-trained model like YAMNet or VGGish, which are specifically designed for audio tasks and can provide you with fixed-length embeddings for audio inputs.\n\n6. **Padding and Truncation**:\n   - If your dataset allows it, you can pad the MFCC matrix to a fixed length or truncate longer sequences. This is often used in conjunction with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for audio inputs.\n\nEach method has its trade-offs, and the choice depends on your specific dataset, the variability in audio length, and the complexity of the task. It's often useful to try a combination of these methods and evaluate their performance on your specific classification task."
