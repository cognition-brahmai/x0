        "content": "The equation you have is \\(2a + 3b = 15\\). You also have two formulas for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n\n1. \\(a = \\frac{15 - 3b}{2}\\)\n2. \\(b = \\frac{15 - 2a}{3}\\)\n\nTo find specific values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), you need one of the variables to be given or an additional equation. However, you can express \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in terms of the other variable.\n\nFor example, if you choose a specific value for \\(b\\), you can use the formula for \\(a\\) to find its corresponding value:\n\n- If \\(b = 0\\):\n  \\[\n  a = \\frac{15 - 3 \\times 0}{2} = \\frac{15}{2} = 7.5\n  \\]\n\n- If \\(b = 3\\):\n  \\[\n  a = \\frac{15 - 3 \\times 3}{2} = \\frac{15 - 9}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n  \\]\n\nSimilarly, if you choose a specific value for \\(a\\), you can use the formula for \\(b\\) to find its corresponding value:\n\n- If \\(a = 0\\):\n  \\[\n  b = \\frac{15 - 2 \\times 0}{3} = \\frac{15}{3} = 5\n  \\]\n\n- If \\(a = 4\\):\n  \\[\n  b = \\frac{15 - 2 \\times 4}{3} = \\frac{15 - 8}{3} = \\frac{7}{3} \\approx 2.33\n  \\]\n\nWithout additional constraints, there are infinitely many solutions to the equation, and you can choose any value for one variable to find the corresponding value of the other."
