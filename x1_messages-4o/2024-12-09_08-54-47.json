Below is a simple Python code snippet that allows you to calculate the balance after performing two transactions on your initial account balance.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_balance(initial_balance, transactions):\n    balance = initial_balance\n    for transaction in transactions:\n        balance += transaction\n    return balance\n\n# Initial account balance\ninitial_balance = 3500\n\n# List of transactions (positive for deposits, negative for withdrawals)\ntransactions = [-500, 200]  # Example: withdrew 500, deposited 200\n\n# Calculate the final balance\nfinal_balance = calculate_balance(initial_balance, transactions)\n\nprint(f\"The final balance after the transactions is: {final_balance}\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `initial_balance` is set to 3500.\n- `transactions` is a list where you can specify your transactions (use negative values for withdrawals and positive values for deposits).\n- The function `calculate_balance` computes the final balance after applying all transactions.\n\nYou can modify the `transactions` list with your actual transaction amounts to get the updated balance."
