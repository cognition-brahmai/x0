The dataframe should look like this:\n\n```plaintext\n    Timestamp    Usefulness\n 0   20140101      Yes\n 1   20140102      No\n 2   20140103      No\n \u2026\n```\n\nCould anyone help me to find a general solution to extract these data from the JSON file?"

        "content": "Certainly! To achieve this task, you can use Python and the `pandas` library, which is excellent for data manipulation and analysis. Assuming your JSON file contains one JSON object per line, you can follow these steps to extract the \"Timestamp\" and \"Usefulness\" fields and put them into a DataFrame:\n\n1. **Read the JSON file line by line**: Since each JSON object is on a separate line, you'll read the file line by line.\n2. **Parse each JSON object**: Use Python's `json` module to parse each line into a dictionary.\n3. **Extract the required fields**: For each dictionary, extract the \"Timestamp\" and \"Usefulness\" fields.\n4. **Create a DataFrame**: Use `pandas` to create a DataFrame from the extracted data.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet to accomplish this:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Initialize an empty list to store extracted data\ndata = []\n\n# Open the JSON file and read it line by line\nwith open('your_file.json', 'r') as file:\n    for line in file:\n        # Parse the JSON object\n        json_obj = json.loads(line.strip())\n        \n        # Extract the required fields\n        timestamp = json_obj.get(\"Timestamp\")\n        usefulness = json_obj.get(\"Usefulness\")\n        \n        # Append the extracted data to the list\n        data.append({\"Timestamp\": timestamp, \"Usefulness\": usefulness})\n\n# Create a DataFrame from the list\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Display the DataFrame\nprint(df)\n```\n\nReplace `'your_file.json'` with the actual path to your JSON file. This script will read your JSON file, extract the \"Timestamp\" and \"Usefulness\" fields from each JSON object, and store them in a DataFrame, which you can then display or manipulate as needed."
