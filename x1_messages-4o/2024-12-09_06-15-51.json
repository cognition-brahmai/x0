In certain conditions, I want this field to be hidden from the user while keeping the form as consistent as possible. I am aware that I can set attributes on the field with `form['fieldname'].field.widget.attr['readonly'] = 'readonly'` and set the desired initial value with `form.initial['fieldname'] = 'mydesiredvalue'`. However, these methods do not change the form of the widget. What's the best, most Django-friendly, and least hacky way to convert this field into a `HiddenInput` field?"

        "content": "To convert a `RegexField` or any other field into a `HiddenInput` field in Django, you can dynamically change the widget of the field in your form. This approach is clean, Django-friendly, and doesn't involve any hacks. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Override the form's `__init__` method.** You can modify the widget of the field based on some conditions when the form is initialized.\n\n2. **Use `HiddenInput` widget.** Django provides a `HiddenInput` widget that you can use to render a field as a hidden input.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom django.forms import HiddenInput\n\nclass MyForm(forms.Form):\n    my_regex_field = forms.RegexField(regex=r'^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$', required=True)\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Extract any custom parameters you might need\n        hide_field = kwargs.pop('hide_field', False)\n        \n        super(MyForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\n        # Check condition to hide the field\n        if hide_field:\n            self.fields['my_regex_field'].widget = HiddenInput()\n\n# Usage example\n# If you want to hide the field, pass `hide_field=True` when instantiating the form\nform = MyForm(hide_field=True)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Conditional Logic:** You can pass a condition (`hide_field` in this example) to the form's constructor to decide whether the field should be hidden or not. This can be based on your specific use case, such as user permissions, form state, etc.\n\n- **HiddenInput Widget:** By setting `self.fields['my_regex_field'].widget = HiddenInput()`, you change the widget of the `RegexField` to a hidden input, ensuring that it will not be visible to the user.\n\n- **Clean and Maintainable:** This approach keeps your form logic encapsulated within the form class and doesn't require any template hacks or JavaScript to hide the field.\n\nYou can adjust the condition based on whatever logic you have for when the field should be hidden. This method allows you to keep your form logic clean and Django-centric."
