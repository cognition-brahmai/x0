However, it seems to include all installed packages, even those not related to my project like Django. How can I generate a requirements file that only includes dependencies for this specific project? Also, how can I install a package with `pip` in the future to be used solely for this project? I believe this might be related to `virtualenv` but I'm not entirely sure."

        "content": "To generate a `requirements.txt` file that only includes the dependencies for your specific project, you should indeed use a virtual environment. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up a Virtual Environment\n\n1. **Install `virtualenv` (if not already installed):**\n   ```bash\n   pip install virtualenv\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a virtual environment for your project:**\n   Navigate to your project directory and run:\n   ```bash\n   virtualenv venv\n   ```\n   This will create a directory named `venv` (or whatever name you choose) in your project directory, which will contain a new, isolated Python environment.\n\n3. **Activate the virtual environment:**\n   - On Windows:\n     ```bash\n     venv\\Scripts\\activate\n     ```\n   - On macOS and Linux:\n     ```bash\n     source venv/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n   Once activated, your command line prompt should change to indicate the virtual environment is active.\n\n### Step 2: Install Packages\n\nWith the virtual environment activated, any package you install using `pip` will be installed solely in this environment and will not affect the global Python installation.\n\nFor example:\n```bash\npip install some-package\n```\n\n### Step 3: Generate `requirements.txt`\n\nAfter installing all the packages needed for your project within the virtual environment, you can generate a `requirements.txt` file:\n```bash\npip freeze > requirements.txt\n```\n\nThis file will now only include the packages installed in the virtual environment, which are the dependencies for your project.\n\n### Step 4: Using the Virtual Environment for Future Development\n\nWhenever you work on this project, make sure to activate the virtual environment using the activation command above. This ensures that any packages you install or use are isolated to the project.\n\n### Installing Packages in the Future\n\nWhenever you need to install a new package for this project, activate the virtual environment first, then use `pip install package-name`. This keeps your project dependencies clean and manageable.\n\n### Deactivation\n\nTo deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:\n```bash\ndeactivate\n```\n\nUsing virtual environments in this way helps you manage project dependencies efficiently and avoids conflicts between different projects\u2019 requirements."
