I was able to easily get it with CUDA 4.0 or earlier but after upgrading my CUDA toolkit to version 4.2, NVCC seems to be rejecting all my flags. Is there a way to get PTX assembler annotated with C/C++ code with the new LLVM back-end?"

        "content": "In CUDA 4.1 and later versions, NVIDIA made some changes that affected how you can generate annotated PTX code. While the older versions allowed more direct options for generating annotated PTX, the newer versions require a slightly different approach.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can generate PTX with C/C++ annotations in newer CUDA versions like 4.2 and 5.0:\n\n1. **Compile to PTX**: First, you need to compile your CUDA code to PTX. You can do this using the `-ptx` flag with `nvcc`. For example:\n\n   ```bash\n   nvcc -ptx your_file.cu -o your_file.ptx\n   ```\n\n2. **Use Debug Information**: To get annotations, you need to include debugging information. You can achieve this by using the `-G` flag, which generates debug information.\n\n   ```bash\n   nvcc -ptx -G your_file.cu -o your_file.ptx\n   ```\n\n3. **Generate Annotated PTX**: Unfortunately, the direct generation of fully annotated PTX (with interleaved C/C++ source) is not natively supported in the same way as it was with the earlier versions. However, you can still use a combination of host-side profiling tools and manual inspection. The `cuobjdump` tool can sometimes provide disassembled code with source information, although it is more focused on SASS (assembly) than PTX.\n\n4. **Check for Inline Annotations**: The `-lineinfo` option can sometimes help with inline annotations by providing line information in the PTX, which you can correlate back to your source code.\n\n   ```bash\n   nvcc -ptx -lineinfo your_file.cu -o your_file.ptx\n   ```\n\n5. **Manual Inspection**: For deeper analysis, you might need to manually inspect the PTX code generated and correlate it with your source code. This approach involves looking at the PTX instructions and understanding their correspondence to the C/C++ code.\n\nWhile these steps do not provide a direct equivalent of the earlier versions' annotated PTX, they can help you achieve a similar understanding through a combination of debug information and manual inspection. If you need more specific debugging capabilities, consider using tools like Nsight for a more integrated debugging and profiling experience."
