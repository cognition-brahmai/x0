The error I'm receiving is \"500: Internal Server Error, nbconvert failed: xelatex not found in PATH\". I've tried re-installing nbconvert via pip and conda, installing xelatex for Mac, re-installing Mactex, and installing pandoc. I've also located the directory for xelatex and copied it into the bin directory. However, then I get an error saying the format file 'xelatex.fmt' can't be found. Even after placing 'xelatex.fmt' in the directory, the error persists. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you\u2019re encountering is a common issue when trying to convert Jupyter notebooks to PDF using nbconvert because it relies on LaTeX, which can be tricky to set up correctly. Here are some steps you can try to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify MacTeX Installation**: \n   - Ensure that MacTeX is installed correctly. You can verify this by running `which xelatex` in your terminal. This should return the path to the xelatex executable if it\u2019s correctly installed.\n\n2. **Update PATH Environment Variable**:\n   - Make sure that the directory containing `xelatex` is in your PATH. You can do this by adding the following line to your `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, or `.zshrc` (depending on your shell):\n     ```bash\n     export PATH=\"/Library/TeX/texbin:$PATH\"\n     ```\n   - After editing the file, run `source ~/.bash_profile` (or the relevant file) to update your PATH.\n\n3. **Reinstall MacTeX**:\n   - Sometimes a fresh installation of MacTeX can resolve issues. Uninstall MacTeX using the uninstallation script provided by the MacTeX website and then reinstall it.\n\n4. **Check for Complete MacTeX Installation**:\n   - Make sure you have installed the full MacTeX package and not the BasicTeX package, as the latter may not include all necessary components.\n\n5. **Install Required Packages**:\n   - Ensure that all necessary LaTeX packages are installed. Sometimes additional packages are needed depending on the content of your notebook. You can install missing packages using `tlmgr`:\n     ```bash\n     sudo tlmgr update --self\n     sudo tlmgr install <package-name>\n     ```\n\n6. **Use Alternative Conversion Methods**:\n   - As a workaround, you can try exporting your notebook to HTML or Markdown and then converting it to PDF using a tool like `pandoc` or your browser's print-to-PDF feature.\n\n7. **Check for nbconvert Version**:\n   - Ensure that you\u2019re using a compatible version of `nbconvert`. You can check your version using:\n     ```bash\n     jupyter nbconvert --version\n     ```\n   - If needed, update `nbconvert` using `pip` or `conda`.\n\n8. **Investigate Log Files**:\n   - Check the Jupyter log files for more detailed error messages that might give clues on what\u2019s going wrong.\n\n9. **Use Virtual Environment**:\n   - If you\u2019re using multiple Python environments, ensure you\u2019re in the correct environment where both Jupyter and all required tools are installed.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with exporting your Jupyter notebook to PDF. If the issue persists, consider posting detailed logs or errors on forums like Stack Overflow for more targeted help."
