However, in Django, an unexisting parameter results in a 500 error page, which seems to be the desired behavior. So, is it okay to leave the code as it is or is there a better practice? Should I always use standard parameters passing like `/myaction/paramvalue/` instead of `/myaction?param_name=param_value` (it's a bit tricky to build such URLs for ajax requests)?"

        "content": "In Django, it's generally a good practice to handle potential exceptions such as `KeyError` when accessing request parameters, especially for optional parameters. This improves the robustness and user experience of your application by avoiding unnecessary 500 error pages, which can be confusing to users. Here's how you can handle this situation more gracefully:\n\n### Checking for Parameters\n\nYou can use the `get` method of the `QueryDict` object, which `request.GET` is an instance of. This method allows you to specify a default value if the parameter is not present, thus avoiding a `KeyError`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef my_view(request):\n    my_param = request.GET.get('param', None)  # Use .get() to avoid KeyError\n    if my_param is None:\n        # Handle the missing parameter case, maybe redirect or return an error message\n        return JsonResponse({'error': 'Missing parameter'}, status=400)\n    # Continue processing if the parameter exists\n    # ...\n```\n\n### URL Design\n\nRegarding URL design, both query parameters (`/myaction?param_name=param_value`) and path parameters (`/myaction/paramvalue/`) have their uses:\n\n- **Query Parameters**: They are suitable for optional parameters, filters, and when you have a large number of parameters. They are easier to build dynamically in Ajax requests.\n  \n- **Path Parameters**: They are often used for mandatory parameters that are integral to the resource being accessed, like IDs or slugs. They can make URLs more readable and RESTful.\n\nFor Ajax requests, query parameters are typically more convenient. However, you should ensure that your code gracefully handles cases where parameters might be missing.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIt's okay to use query parameters for Ajax requests and to handle potential missing parameters using methods like `request.GET.get()`. By doing this, you enhance the robustness of your application and provide a better user experience by avoiding unexpected errors."
