However, I'm facing an issue with the tqdm progress bar when using multiprocessing. The progress bar is displayed from 0 to 100% but it does not indicate the actual progress of the map function. How can I display a progress bar that correctly indicates the current step of the 'map' function? Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\nimport tqdm\nimport time\n\ndef _foo(my_number):\n   square = my_number * my_number\n   time.sleep(1)\n   return square \n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n   p = Pool(2)\n   r = p.map(_foo, tqdm.tqdm(range(0, 30)))\n   p.close()\n   p.join()\n```"

        "content": "To properly integrate the `tqdm` progress bar with `multiprocessing.Pool.map`, you can manually update the progress bar inside the function being executed by the pool. However, this requires a bit of a workaround since `tqdm` is not natively designed to work with `multiprocessing` in a straightforward way. Here's one approach to achieve this:\n\n1. Use a `tqdm` instance in the main process.\n2. Update this instance from within the `_foo` function using shared state or callbacks.\n\nOne straightforward way to achieve this is by updating the progress bar using a callback function. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool, Manager\nimport tqdm\nimport time\nimport itertools\n\ndef _foo(my_number, progress_queue):\n    square = my_number * my_number\n    time.sleep(1)\n    progress_queue.put(1)  # Add 1 to the progress queue to indicate progress\n    return square\n\ndef update_progress_bar(progress_queue, total_items):\n    with tqdm.tqdm(total=total_items) as pbar:\n        while True:\n            item = progress_queue.get()\n            if item is None:\n                break\n            pbar.update(item)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    total_iterations = 30\n    manager = Manager()\n    progress_queue = manager.Queue()\n\n    with Pool(processes=2) as pool:\n        # Start the progress bar updating process\n        progress_listener = pool.apply_async(update_progress_bar, (progress_queue, total_iterations))\n        \n        # Map the function to the pool with the additional argument for progress\n        result = pool.starmap(_foo, zip(range(total_iterations), itertools.repeat(progress_queue)))\n        \n        # Close the pool and wait for the progress listener to finish\n        progress_queue.put(None)  # Signal the progress listener to exit\n        pool.close()\n        pool.join()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`Manager.Queue`:** This allows sharing a queue between processes. Each call to `_foo` puts a `1` in the queue to indicate it has completed a task.\n- **`update_progress_bar`:** This function runs in a separate process and updates the progress bar based on items received from the queue.\n- **`pool.starmap`:** Used to pass multiple arguments to `_foo`. Here, `itertools.repeat(progress_queue)` is used to pass the same `progress_queue` to each call.\n\nThis setup ensures that the progress bar accurately reflects the progress of the map function's tasks."
