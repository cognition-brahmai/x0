Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nclass TestClassName(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n       pass\n\n    def setup_method(self, method):\n       print \"setup_method called\"\n\n    def teardown_method(self, method):\n       print \"teardown_method called\"\n\n    def test_a(self):\n       print \"test_a called\"\n       assert 1 == 1\n\n    def test_b(self):\n       print \"test_b called\"\n       assert 1 == 1\n```\n\nWhen I run `py.test -v -s`, it collects 0 items and skips 1. Can anyone please explain why this might be happening? I understand that the constructor isn't needed, but I am interested in understanding this behaviour of py.test."

        "content": "The behavior you're experiencing is due to how `pytest` (formerly known as `py.test`) handles the test discovery and execution process. In `pytest`, test classes are expected to follow a certain structure, and the presence of a custom `__init__` method can interfere with this process.\n\nHere\u2019s why your test class is being skipped:\n\n1. **Test Class Instantiation**:\n   - `pytest` uses test class instantiation to prepare tests for execution. When you define a custom `__init__` method, `pytest` requires specific arguments to be passed when creating an instance of your test class.\n   - In your case, the custom `__init__` method doesn't accept any arguments, but `pytest` might pass arguments during instantiation, leading to a mismatch. This prevents the test class from being properly instantiated and the tests from being executed.\n\n2. **Test Discovery**:\n   - During test discovery, `pytest` looks for classes that start with `Test` and contain methods that also start with `test_`.\n   - If the instantiation of the test class fails due to an incompatible `__init__` method, `pytest` will skip the class, as it cannot create an instance to find and run test methods.\n\nTo resolve this, you should remove the custom `__init__` method, as `pytest` does not require it for test classes. Your test setup and teardown can be handled using `setup_method` and `teardown_method`, respectively, which `pytest` will automatically recognize and use. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```python\nclass TestClassName(object):\n    def setup_method(self, method):\n       print(\"setup_method called\")\n\n    def teardown_method(self, method):\n       print(\"teardown_method called\")\n\n    def test_a(self):\n       print(\"test_a called\")\n       assert 1 == 1\n\n    def test_b(self):\n       print(\"test_b called\")\n       assert 1 == 1\n```\n\nWith the `__init__` method removed, `pytest` will correctly discover and execute your tests. If you need to perform some initialization for your tests, consider using `setup_method` or class-level fixtures provided by `pytest`."
