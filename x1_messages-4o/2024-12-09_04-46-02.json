An example of a list comprehension I am working with is:\n\n```python\nallUuids = [x.id for x in self.db.query(schema.allPostsUuid).execute(timeout = 20) if x.type == \"post\" and x.deleted is not False]\n```\n\nHow can I indent this in a way that makes it more readable?"

        "content": "To improve the readability of your Python list comprehension, you can break it down into multiple lines. This way, it's easier to see the different components of the comprehension, such as the expression, the loop, and the condition. Here's how you can format it:\n\n```python\nallUuids = [\n    x.id\n    for x in self.db.query(schema.allPostsUuid).execute(timeout=20)\n    if x.type == \"post\" and x.deleted is not False\n]\n```\n\nThis format separates the key parts of the list comprehension onto different lines:\n\n- The expression `x.id` is on its own line, making it clear what each element of the list will be.\n- The `for` loop starts on the next line, indicating the source of the items.\n- The `if` condition is on its own line, clearly showing the filtering condition.\n\nThis indentation style enhances readability by organizing the comprehension into logical sections, which can be particularly helpful when working with more complex comprehensions."
