        "content": "To resolve the issue of Django not recognizing the updated SQLite version on your CentOS 7 VPS, you need to ensure that your Python environment is using the updated version of SQLite. Here are the steps you can follow to achieve this:\n\n1. **Install the Updated Version of SQLite:**\n   First, make sure that you have successfully installed the updated version of SQLite (3.27.2) on your system. You can verify this by running:\n   ```bash\n   sqlite3 --version\n   ```\n   If it shows 3.27.2, then SQLite is correctly installed.\n\n2. **Recompile Python:**\n   The Python interpreter needs to be compiled against the new version of SQLite for Django to recognize it. You will need to recompile Python with the updated SQLite version. Here's how you can do it:\n\n   - First, remove the existing Python installation if necessary. Be cautious and ensure you have backups if needed.\n   \n   - Download the Python source code for the version you are using (e.g., Python 3.8.10):\n     ```bash\n     wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.10/Python-3.8.10.tgz\n     ```\n\n   - Extract the downloaded tarball:\n     ```bash\n     tar xzf Python-3.8.10.tgz\n     cd Python-3.8.10\n     ```\n   \n   - Before configuring, ensure that `pkg-config` is installed to help locate the correct SQLite version:\n     ```bash\n     sudo yum install pkg-config\n     ```\n\n   - Configure the build with the correct SQLite version:\n     ```bash\n     ./configure --enable-optimizations\n     ```\n     You might need to specify the path to the SQLite library if it is not in a standard location. For example:\n     ```bash\n     ./configure --enable-optimizations --with-sqlite3-libs=/usr/local/lib --with-sqlite3-includes=/usr/local/include\n     ```\n\n   - Compile and install Python:\n     ```bash\n     make\n     sudo make altinstall\n     ```\n     Use `altinstall` to avoid overwriting the default Python binary.\n\n3. **Verify the Python SQLite Version:**\n   After recompiling, check that Python is using the updated SQLite version:\n   ```bash\n   python3.8 -c \"import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.sqlite_version)\"\n   ```\n   This should print 3.27.2.\n\n4. **Update Your Virtual Environment:**\n   If you are using a virtual environment, recreate it with the newly compiled Python version:\n   ```bash\n   deactivate  # If the old virtual environment is active\n   rm -rf venv  # Remove the old virtual environment\n   python3.8 -m venv venv  # Create a new virtual environment\n   source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the new virtual environment\n   ```\n\n5. **Reinstall Django and Dependencies:**\n   After activating the new virtual environment, reinstall Django and any other dependencies your project requires:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n6. **Run Migrations:**\n   Now, try running the migrations again:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, Django should now be able to recognize the updated SQLite version, allowing you to run your migrations successfully."
