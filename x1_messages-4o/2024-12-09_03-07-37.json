        "content": "How can I import a column from a csv file as a string and not as an int64 in pandas? When I use the pandas read_csv function, it automatically converts the column to int64. I've tried using converters to cast the column as a string but it still returns the same result. Here's what I've tried:\n\n```python\ndf = read_csv('sample.csv')\n\ndf.ID\n>>>\n\n0   -9223372036854775808\n1   -9223372036854775808\n2   -9223372036854775808\n3   -9223372036854775808\n4   -9223372036854775808\n5   -9223372036854775808\n6   -9223372036854775808\nName: ID\n```\n\nAnd when using converters:\n\n```python\ndf = read_csv('sample.csv', converters={'ID': str})\ndf.ID\n>>>\n\n0   -9223372036854775808\n1   -9223372036854775808\n2   -9223372036854775808\n3   -9223372036854775808\n4   -9223372036854775808\n5   -9223372036854775808\n6   -9223372036854775808\nName: ID\n```"

        "content": "When importing a column from a CSV file as a string in pandas, you can specify the `dtype` parameter to ensure the column is read as a string. It seems like the issue might be related to how pandas infers the data type. To explicitly set the data type of the column to string, you can use the `dtype` parameter in `read_csv`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Specify the dtype for the 'ID' column as 'str'\ndf = pd.read_csv('sample.csv', dtype={'ID': str})\n\n# Verify the column is read as string\nprint(df.ID)\nprint(df.ID.dtypes)\n```\n\nBy specifying `dtype={'ID': str}`, you are instructing pandas to treat the 'ID' column as a string, regardless of its content. If this does not resolve the issue, ensure that there are no other issues with the CSV file itself, such as malformed data or incorrect delimiters.\n\nIf the problem persists, it might be worth checking if there are any other operations in your code that might be altering the column's data type after loading the CSV file."
