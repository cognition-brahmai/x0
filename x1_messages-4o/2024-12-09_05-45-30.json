The warning message is \"`should_run_async` will not call `transform_cell` automatically in the future\". I am unable to find any documentation related to this. Even though I am aware that I can suppress these warnings, I would like to understand what's happening. The code that I am using is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ipykernel/ipkernel.py:287: DeprecationWarning: `should_run_async` will not call `transform_cell` automatically in the future. Please pass the result to `transformed_cell` argument and any exception that happen during thetransform in `preprocessing_exc_tuple` in IPython 7.17 and above.\n  and should_run_async(code)\n```\n\nFor context, I am using Python 3.8.5, jupyter-client 6.1.6, jupyter-core 4.6.3, jupyterlab 2.2.4, jupyterlab-server 1.2.0 on Mac OS. Can you explain why this warning is appearing and how to address it?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The deprecation warning you're encountering is related to the execution model of the IPython kernel used in Jupyter notebooks. Specifically, it concerns the `should_run_async` function, which is part of the IPython kernel's handling of asynchronous code execution.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Async Execution in IPython**: \n   - IPython, which is the underlying kernel for Jupyter notebooks, supports both synchronous and asynchronous code execution. The `should_run_async` function is used internally to determine if a code cell should be run asynchronously.\n\n2. **Deprecation Warning**:\n   - The warning indicates that in future versions of IPython, the `should_run_async` function will not automatically call the `transform_cell` function. Instead, users or developers will need to handle the transformation explicitly by passing results to the `transformed_cell` argument and handling any exceptions in `preprocessing_exc_tuple`.\n\n3. **Why It's Occurring**:\n   - This warning is likely being triggered due to changes in the IPython execution model aimed at making it more flexible and explicit. Your current environment might be using libraries or extensions that rely on the older behavior, thus triggering this warning.\n\n4. **Addressing the Warning**:\n   - **Update Packages**: Ensure that all your Jupyter-related packages are up to date. Package updates often include fixes or adaptations to newer API changes.\n   - **Suppress Warnings**: While not a long-term solution, you can suppress these warnings if they are not affecting your work:\n     ```python\n     import warnings\n     warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=DeprecationWarning)\n     ```\n   - **Check Dependencies**: Look for any custom extensions or scripts that might be using the older API and update them if necessary.\n\n5. **Future Compatibility**:\n   - Keep an eye on updates from the IPython and Jupyter communities. They might provide more guidance or tools to handle these deprecations as newer versions are released.\n\nBy understanding the underlying cause of the warning and keeping your environment updated, you can mitigate potential issues and ensure that your workflow remains smooth."
