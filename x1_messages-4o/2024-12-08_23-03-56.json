But hold on, there's a twist. To solve this puzzle, you must use your mathematical skills to manipulate the numbers using only THREE of the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Can you crack this puzzle and arrange the numbers in ascending order? Good luck, and may the math be with you!"

Here are the numbers for reference:\n\n1. 1380004385\n2. 1439323776\n3. 331002651\n4. 206139589\n\nLet's apply the operations:\n\n1. **Operation 1: Subtraction**\n   - Subtract the smallest number from the largest:\n   - \\( 1439323776 - 206139589 = 1233184187 \\)\n\n2. **Operation 2: Division**\n   - Divide the second largest number by the second smallest:\n   - \\( 1380004385 / 331002651 \\approx 4.169 \\)\n\n3. **Operation 3: Addition**\n   - Add the two smallest numbers:\n   - \\( 331002651 + 206139589 = 537142240 \\)\n\nNow, let's arrange these results in ascending order:\n\n1. \\( 4.169 \\)\n2. \\( 537142240 \\)\n3. \\( 1233184187 \\)\n\nThese are the manipulated numbers in ascending order."
