Here's how you can check if the dictionary `x` contains the key `'a'`:\n\n```python\nx = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n\nif 'a' in x:\n    print(\"Key 'a' is present in the dictionary.\")\n    # You can add your code here to execute if the key is present\nelse:\n    print(\"Key 'a' is not present in the dictionary.\")\n```\n\nThis approach is both efficient and Pythonic for checking the existence of a key in a dictionary."
