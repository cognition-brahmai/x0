I want to perform nearly the same large block of stuff, involving 'gs' or not, depending on 'needs_with()'. In one scenario, a block would be encased in the 'with' statement, while another possibility would be the same block, but not encased, like it wasn't indented. When I tried this initially, I got indentation errors. Here's an example of what I tried:\n\n```python\nif needs_with():\n    with get_stuff() as gs:\n    # do nearly the same large block of stuff,\n    # involving gs or not, depending on needs_with()\n```"

        "content": "To conditionally use a `with` statement or not, you can structure your code to handle both scenarios by abstracting the logic into a function and using a context manager that does nothing when the condition is not met. In Python, you can achieve this with a custom context manager or by using the `contextlib.nullcontext` available from Python 3.7 onwards.\n\nHere's an example using `contextlib.nullcontext`:\n\n```python\nfrom contextlib import nullcontext\n\ndef perform_task(gs=None):\n    # do nearly the same large block of stuff\n    # involving gs or not, depending on needs_with()\n    if gs is not None:\n        # Perform operations with gs\n        print(\"Using context manager with gs\")\n    else:\n        # Perform operations without gs\n        print(\"Not using context manager\")\n\ndef main():\n    if needs_with():\n        context = get_stuff()\n    else:\n        context = nullcontext()\n\n    with context as gs:\n        perform_task(gs)\n\ndef needs_with():\n    # Your logic to determine if 'with' is needed\n    return True  # or False based on your condition\n\ndef get_stuff():\n    # Example of a context manager\n    class Stuff:\n        def __enter__(self):\n            print(\"Entering context\")\n            return \"some_resource\"\n\n        def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):\n            print(\"Exiting context\")\n\n    return Stuff()\n\nmain()\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `needs_with()` determines whether the `with` block is necessary.\n- `get_stuff()` is a context manager that you want to use conditionally.\n- `nullcontext()` acts as a no-op context manager when the `with` block isn't needed.\n- `perform_task()` is where you place the code that should run whether or not the `with` block is used, utilizing `gs` if it's available.\n\nThis approach allows you to maintain a single code block for the operations, avoiding code duplication and the indentation errors you encountered."
