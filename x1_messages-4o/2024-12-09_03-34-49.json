After initializing my database, I run `flask db init` followed by `flask db migrate` to migrate my models classes to the database. However, I am encountering an error: `sqlalchemy.exc.ArgumentError: Could not parse rfc1738 URL from string`. I am using Windows 10, my database is MySQL, and the installed extensions are `flask-migrate`, `flask-sqlalchemy`, `flask-login`. Here is the stack trace for your reference:\n```\n(env) \u03bb flask db migrate\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n...\nsqlalchemy.exc.ArgumentError: Could not parse rfc1738 URL from string 'mysql/dt_admin:dt2016@localhost/dreamteam_db'\n```\nHow can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `sqlalchemy.exc.ArgumentError: Could not parse rfc1738 URL from string`, indicates that SQLAlchemy is having trouble parsing the database URL you've provided. This is often due to an incorrect format within the URL. Let's resolve this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Correct Database URL Format:**\n   Ensure your database URL follows the correct RFC 1738 format, which for MySQL should look like:\n   ```\n   mysql://username:password@hostname/dbname\n   ```\n   In your case, it should be:\n   ```\n   mysql://dt_admin:dt2016@localhost/dreamteam_db\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Configuration:**\n   Make sure your `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` in your Flask application's configuration is set to the correct URL format. It should look something like this in your `config.py` or wherever you configure your Flask app:\n   ```python\n   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql://dt_admin:dt2016@localhost/dreamteam_db'\n   ```\n\n3. **Environment Variables:**\n   If you're setting this URL via environment variables, ensure that it's correctly exported. On Windows, you might set it using:\n   ```shell\n   set SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=mysql://dt_admin:dt2016@localhost/dreamteam_db\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Special Characters:**\n   If your username or password contains special characters, they need to be URL-encoded. For example, if your password is `pa$$word`, it should be encoded as `pa%24%24word`.\n\n5. **Package Versions:**\n   Ensure all your packages are up to date. You can upgrade them using pip:\n   ```shell\n   pip install --upgrade flask-migrate flask-sqlalchemy flask-login\n   ```\n\n6. **MySQL Driver:**\n   Ensure you have a MySQL driver installed, such as `mysqlclient` or `PyMySQL`. You can install it using pip:\n   ```shell\n   pip install mysqlclient\n   ```\n   or if you're using PyMySQL, adjust your URL to:\n   ```python\n   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+pymysql://dt_admin:dt2016@localhost/dreamteam_db'\n   ```\n\nAfter making these adjustments, try running `flask db migrate` again. If you continue to encounter issues, double-check the URL and any configurations related to your database connection."
