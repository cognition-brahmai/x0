However, I'm encountering an error that says, \"NotImplementedError: Please use HDF reader for matlab v7.3 files\". Could anyone who has faced the same problem please provide me with some sample code to solve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is because MATLAB version 7.3 files are stored in the HDF5 format, which the `scipy.io.loadmat` function does not support. Instead, you can use the `h5py` library to load these files in Python. Here's a sample code to help you read a MATLAB v7.3 file using `h5py`:\n\n1. First, make sure you have the `h5py` library installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install h5py\n   ```\n\n2. Use the following code to read your MATLAB v7.3 file:\n\n   ```python\n   import h5py\n\n   # Replace 'your_file.mat' with the path to your .mat file\n   file_path = 'your_file.mat'\n\n   # Open the .mat file using h5py\n   with h5py.File(file_path, 'r') as file:\n       # List all groups (top-level variables)\n       print(\"Keys: %s\" % file.keys())\n       keys = list(file.keys())\n\n       # Access a specific variable using its key\n       # Replace 'your_variable_name' with the actual variable name\n       your_variable_name = keys[0]  # For example, access the first variable\n       data = file[your_variable_name][()]\n\n       # Now 'data' contains the data for that variable\n       print(data)\n\n   ```\n\n3. This code will print the keys (variable names) stored in the MATLAB file and load the data for the first variable it finds. You can modify the `your_variable_name` to access other variables in the file.\n\nNote that the data structure may need additional processing depending on the complexity and type of the data stored in the MATLAB file. The data could be a simple array, a struct, or other complex structures, so you might need to handle the data accordingly after loading it."
