For instance, I have these two 1d arrays:\n\n```python\na = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])\nb = np.array([6,7,8,9,10])\n```\nI want to convert these into one 2d array, like this: `[[1,6], [2,7], [3,8], [4,9], [5, 10]]`. How can I achieve this?"

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nb = np.array([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\n\n# Use numpy.column_stack() to combine the arrays\nresult = np.column_stack((a, b))\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[[ 1  6]\n [ 2  7]\n [ 3  8]\n [ 4  9]\n [ 5 10]]\n```\n\nThe `numpy.column_stack()` function concatenates the arrays along the second axis (i.e., it stacks them as columns), resulting in a 2-dimensional array where each pair of elements from the input arrays becomes a row."
