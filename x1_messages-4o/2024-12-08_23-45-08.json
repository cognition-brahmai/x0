Here's the catch: I need you to provide the plan in a format that requires reasoning and problem-solving. I'm looking for an HTML page that includes a table with the recommended serving sizes for each food group. The catch is that the table should be encrypted using a code that requires the user to solve a math puzzle to access it. Are you up for the challenge?"

If correct, it reveals the meal plan table, otherwise, it prompts the user to try again.\n\n4. **Math Puzzle**: The puzzle is a playful reference to \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" where the answer to life, the universe, and everything is humorously said to be 42.\n\nThis setup encourages reasoning and problem-solving as the user needs to know or deduce the answer to access the meal plan."
