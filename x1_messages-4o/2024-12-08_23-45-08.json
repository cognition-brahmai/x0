Given the constraint that the drone uses 80% of its battery power during a single flight and can fly for 20 minutes before needing to be recharged, calculate the total footage that can be captured in GB, considering that the average video file size for one minute of 4K footage is 1.5 GB. Moreover, please also provide a table comparing the amount of footage that can be captured by the drone in different video resolutions (1080p, 2.7K, and 4K)."

        "content": "To determine the maximum video footage that can be captured by the Drone Phantom 5 during a single flight, we need to consider several factors such as battery capacity, flight time, and video file size for different resolutions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Battery Usage:**\n   - The drone uses 80% of its battery power during a single flight.\n   - Total flight time with 80% battery use is 20 minutes.\n\n2. **Video File Size for 4K:**\n   - Average video file size for one minute of 4K footage is 1.5 GB.\n   - Video file size for 20 minutes of 4K footage is:\n     \\[\n     20 \\text{ minutes} \\times 1.5 \\text{ GB/minute} = 30 \\text{ GB}\n     \\]\n\n### Table: Video Footage in Different Resolutions\n\nTo compare the amount of footage that can be captured in different video resolutions, we'll use the following average file sizes per minute:\n\n- **4K:** 1.5 GB/minute\n- **2.7K:** 1.0 GB/minute (approximation)\n- **1080p:** 0.5 GB/minute (approximation)\n\nUsing these approximations, we can calculate the total footage for each resolution:\n\n| Resolution | File Size per Minute | Total Footage for 20 Minutes |\n|------------|----------------------|------------------------------|\n| 4K         | 1.5 GB/minute        | 30 GB                        |\n| 2.7K       | 1.0 GB/minute        | 20 GB                        |\n| 1080p      | 0.5 GB/minute        | 10 GB                        |\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDuring a single flight using 80% of its battery capacity, the Drone Phantom 5 can capture up to 30 GB of 4K footage in 20 minutes. For different resolutions, the footage sizes are 20 GB for 2.7K and 10 GB for 1080p. These calculations assume consistent recording and no interruptions during the flight."
