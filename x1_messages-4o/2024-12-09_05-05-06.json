Here's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample data\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\ny = np.sin(x)\n\n# Create the plot\nplt.plot(x, y, label='sin(x)')\n\n# Define the range for the shaded area\nx_fill = np.linspace(3, 7, 100)\ny1 = np.sin(x_fill)\n\n# Add the shaded area\nplt.fill_between(x_fill, y1, color='yellow', alpha=0.5)\n\n# Add labels and legend\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('y')\nplt.title('Shaded Area Between Two Points')\nplt.legend()\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We create a sine wave using `np.sin`.\n- We use `fill_between` to fill the area between the sine curve (`y1`) and the x-axis over the interval [3, 7].\n- The `color` parameter sets the color of the shaded area, and `alpha` sets its transparency.\n\nYou can adjust the `x_fill` range to change the section of the plot where the area is shaded."
