I understand what they do and I've seen many examples of both, but I've not found a single scenario which necessitates the use of `classmethod` over `staticmethod`. The most common usage of `classmethod` I've seen is for creating a new instance of the class itself, in a way similar to this simplified example:\n\n```python\nclass Foo:\n    @classmethod\n    def create_new(cls):\n        return cls()\n```\nIn this case, a new instance of `Foo` is returned when calling `foo = Foo.create_new()`. However, I don't understand why I can't just use this instead:\n\n```python\nclass Foo:\n    @staticmethod\n    def create_new():\n        return Foo()\n```\nIt seems to do the exact same thing, so why should I ever prefer a `classmethod` over a `staticmethod`?"

        "content": "The choice between using a `classmethod` and a `staticmethod` often comes down to flexibility and future-proofing, especially in scenarios involving inheritance.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why you might prefer a `classmethod` over a `staticmethod`:\n\n1. **Access to Class State**: \n   - A `classmethod` receives the class itself as the first argument (`cls`), not an instance of the class. This allows the method to access and modify class state that is shared across all instances. In contrast, a `staticmethod` does not have access to the class or instance state.\n\n2. **Inheritance Support**:\n   - If you're working with inheritance, using a `classmethod` allows subclasses to override the class method. This means that if you call the method on a subclass, the `cls` argument will automatically refer to the subclass, not the base class. This is particularly useful when you want to create instances of the subclass but still use the same method from the base class.\n\n3. **Factory Methods**:\n   - A common use case for `classmethod` is to define factory methods. These are methods that return an instance of the class. If you have a complex construction logic or multiple ways to create an instance, class methods can provide a clean interface to do so. Using `cls()` instead of `Foo()` ensures that even if the method is called on a subclass, an instance of the subclass is created.\n\n4. **Consistency in Design**:\n   - If you anticipate that a method might need access to the class in the future, starting with a `classmethod` can be a proactive design choice. It keeps the method consistent with others that may require class-level access.\n\nHere is an example illustrating the inheritance benefit:\n\n```python\nclass Base:\n    @classmethod\n    def create_new(cls):\n        return cls()\n\nclass Sub(Base):\n    def __init__(self):\n        print(\"Instance of Sub created\")\n\n# Using classmethod\nsub_instance = Sub.create_new()  # This will print \"Instance of Sub created\"\n\n# If you used a staticmethod:\nsub_instance_static = Sub.create_new_static()  # This would have created an instance of Base, not Sub\n```\n\nIn this scenario, using a `staticmethod` would force you to manually handle the class instantiation logic if you ever wanted to support subclasses. By using a `classmethod`, the responsibility of knowing which class to instantiate is automatically handled by Python's method resolution order.\n\nSo, the main advantage of `classmethod` is its ability to work seamlessly with class inheritance and provide more dynamic and flexible class-based logic."
