However, when I run it along with the Tensorflow part, I encounter an error. The error seems to occur when Tensorflow session starts and it loads both GPUs. I've tried to restrict Tensorflow to load only one GPU with two methods, but neither of them works. The first method is setting the \"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\" environment variable to \"0\" before importing Tensorflow, and the second one is using tf.device to specify the GPU. How can I solve this problem and make Tensorflow use only one GPU?"

        "content": "To resolve the issue of TensorFlow using both GPUs instead of just one, you can try the following approaches. These methods should help you ensure that TensorFlow only utilizes the specified GPU:\n\n1. **Set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES Properly**: Ensure that you're setting the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable before importing any libraries that might use the GPU. This environment variable should be set as early as possible in your script.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = \"0\"  # Use only the first GPU\n\n    import tensorflow as tf\n    ```\n\n2. **Limit GPU Memory Growth**: Sometimes, TensorFlow allocates all available memory on the GPU by default. You can configure TensorFlow to allow memory growth, which might help in managing resources more efficiently.\n\n    ```python\n    import tensorflow as tf\n\n    gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')\n    if gpus:\n        try:\n            # Restrict TensorFlow to only allocate a specific GPU\n            tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices(gpus[0], 'GPU')\n\n            # Allow memory growth\n            for gpu in gpus:\n                tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)\n        except RuntimeError as e:\n            print(e)\n    ```\n\n3. **Use Logical Device Configuration**: Specify logical devices if you want finer control over how TensorFlow utilizes the GPUs.\n\n    ```python\n    import tensorflow as tf\n\n    gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')\n    if gpus:\n        try:\n            # Restrict TensorFlow to only use the first GPU\n            tf.config.set_visible_devices(gpus[0], 'GPU')\n            # Create a logical device\n            tf.config.experimental.set_virtual_device_configuration(\n                gpus[0],\n                [tf.config.experimental.VirtualDeviceConfiguration(memory_limit=2048)])  # Set memory limit if needed\n        except RuntimeError as e:\n            print(e)\n    ```\n\n4. **Check for Other Issues**: If the above methods don\u2019t work, ensure there are no other parts of your code or other libraries that might be interfering with GPU allocation. Sometimes, conflicts with other frameworks or incorrect environment setups can cause such issues.\n\n5. **Different TensorFlow and TensorRT Versions**: Ensure compatibility between TensorFlow and TensorRT versions, as mismatched versions can sometimes cause unexpected behavior.\n\n6. **Use Separate Processes**: If your application logic permits, consider running the TensorRT and TensorFlow processes separately, each in its own process with specific GPU allocations.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to control TensorFlow\u2019s GPU allocation more effectively and prevent it from using both GPUs."
