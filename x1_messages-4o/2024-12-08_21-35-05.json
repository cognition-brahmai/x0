        "content": "To solve this problem using Ruby, you can generate a set of five unique numbers randomly and then check if any combination of three numbers from this set sums to 13. Here's a basic approach to achieve this:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'set'\n\ndef generate_unique_numbers\n  numbers = Set.new\n  while numbers.size < 5\n    numbers.add(rand(1..10)) # Adjust the range as needed\n  end\n  numbers.to_a\nend\n\ndef sum_of_three_equals_thirteen?(numbers)\n  combinations = numbers.combination(3).to_a\n  combinations.any? { |combo| combo.sum == 13 }\nend\n\ndef find_valid_set\n  loop do\n    numbers = generate_unique_numbers\n    if sum_of_three_equals_thirteen?(numbers)\n      return numbers\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nactivities = find_valid_set\nputs \"Set of activities: #{activities}\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`generate_unique_numbers`**: This method generates a set of five unique numbers. It uses a `Set` to ensure uniqueness and randomly selects numbers from a defined range (in this case, 1 to 10, but this can be adjusted).\n\n2. **`sum_of_three_equals_thirteen?`**: This method checks if any combination of three numbers from the given set sums to 13. It uses the `combination` method to generate all possible combinations of three numbers.\n\n3. **`find_valid_set`**: This method continuously generates sets of numbers until it finds one that satisfies the condition that the sum of any three numbers equals 13.\n\n4. **Output**: The final valid set of activity numbers is printed once a suitable combination is found.\n\n### Usage:\n\n- Run this script to generate a valid set of activities.\n- Adjust the range in `rand(1..10)` to reflect the possible values of activities if necessary.\n- You can use this approach to explore different constraints by modifying the sum condition or the number of activities.\n\nThis code provides a simple yet effective way to solve the problem by iterating through possible sets until a valid combination is found."
