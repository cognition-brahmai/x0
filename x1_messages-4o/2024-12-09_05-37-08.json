        "content": "To assert that a JSON object or string is contained within a result in a Django unit test, you can convert both the expected and actual JSON objects to strings and then check if the expected string is in the actual string. Here\u2019s one way to implement this:\n\n```python\nimport json\nfrom django.test import TestCase\n\nclass MyTestCase(TestCase):\n    def test_contains_json_string(self):\n        result = '{\"car\": [\"toyota\", \"honda\"], \"color\": \"red\"}'  # Example result\n        expected_json = {\"car\": [\"toyota\", \"honda\"]}\n\n        # Convert the expected JSON object to a string\n        expected_string = json.dumps(expected_json, separators=(',', ':'))\n\n        # Assert that the expected JSON string is in the result\n        self.assertIn(expected_string, result)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n1. We use `json.dumps()` to convert the expected JSON object into a string. The `separators=(',', ':')` argument ensures that the JSON is formatted in a compact way without unnecessary spaces, which helps in matching it with the result string.\n\n2. We use `self.assertIn()` to check if the expected JSON string is contained within the result string. This method is part of Python's `unittest` framework and is available in Django's `TestCase` as well.\n\nMake sure that the `result` variable in your actual test contains a JSON-formatted string for this approach to work correctly."
