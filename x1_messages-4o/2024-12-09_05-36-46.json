I understand that the NumberFormat of a cell can be adjusted, but I'm also interested in setting font colors and attributes like bold, italic etc. I found a style.py class but it seems I can't set the style attribute of a cell. I'd prefer not to tinker with the Openpyxl source code. Has anyone found a solution to this?"

        "content": "Certainly! When working with Openpyxl to set styles such as font colors and text attributes like bold and italic, you can use the `openpyxl.styles` module. You don't need to modify the Openpyxl source code. Instead, you can use the built-in classes provided by Openpyxl for styling. Here's a brief guide on how you can apply styles to cells:\n\n1. **Import the necessary classes**: You will need to import `Font`, `PatternFill`, `Border`, `Side`, and `Alignment` from `openpyxl.styles`.\n\n2. **Create a Font object**: Use the `Font` class to set attributes like font name, size, color, bold, and italic.\n\n3. **Apply the style to the cell**: Assign the `Font` object to the `font` attribute of a cell.\n\nHere's a simple example to demonstrate how you can set the font style and color of a cell:\n\n```python\nfrom openpyxl import Workbook\nfrom openpyxl.styles import Font\n\n# Create a new workbook and select the active worksheet\nwb = Workbook()\nws = wb.active\n\n# Write some text to a cell\nws['A1'] = \"Hello, Openpyxl!\"\n\n# Create a Font object with desired style attributes\nfont_style = Font(name='Arial', size=12, bold=True, italic=True, color='FF0000')\n\n# Apply the font style to the cell\nws['A1'].font = font_style\n\n# Save the workbook\nwb.save(\"styled.xlsx\")\n```\n\n### Additional Styling Options:\n\n- **Fill Color**: Use `PatternFill` to set the background color of a cell.\n  ```python\n  from openpyxl.styles import PatternFill\n\n  fill_style = PatternFill(start_color=\"FFFF00\", end_color=\"FFFF00\", fill_type=\"solid\")\n  ws['A1'].fill = fill_style\n  ```\n\n- **Borders**: Use `Border` and `Side` to set cell borders.\n  ```python\n  from openpyxl.styles import Border, Side\n\n  border_style = Border(left=Side(style='thin'), right=Side(style='thin'), top=Side(style='thin'), bottom=Side(style='thin'))\n  ws['A1'].border = border_style\n  ```\n\n- **Alignment**: Use `Alignment` to align text within a cell.\n  ```python\n  from openpyxl.styles import Alignment\n\n  alignment_style = Alignment(horizontal='center', vertical='center')\n  ws['A1'].alignment = alignment_style\n  ```\n\nThis allows for a wide range of styling options without the need to directly manipulate the Openpyxl source code. You can customize each style object according to your requirements and apply them to specific cells or ranges in your workbook."
