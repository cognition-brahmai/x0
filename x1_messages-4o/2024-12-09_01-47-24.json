Using swftools didn't give satisfactory results as the fonts got ruined in the conversion. How can I perform this conversion ensuring that the images are lightweight and readable?"

        "content": "To convert PDFs into images using Python while ensuring that the images are lightweight and maintain readability, you can use the `pdf2image` library. This library is specifically designed for converting PDF files into images and can maintain the quality of the fonts and graphics. Below are the steps and a sample code to help you with the conversion:\n\n1. **Install Required Libraries:**\n\n   You'll need to install the `pdf2image` and `Pillow` libraries. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pdf2image pillow\n   ```\n\n   Additionally, you will need `poppler-utils` as a dependency. You can install it via a package manager (e.g., Homebrew on macOS, apt on Ubuntu, or choco on Windows).\n\n   - **For macOS:**\n\n     ```bash\n     brew install poppler\n     ```\n\n   - **For Ubuntu:**\n\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get install poppler-utils\n     ```\n\n   - **For Windows:**\n\n     You can download the Poppler binaries from [here](http://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/), extract them, and add the path to the binaries to your system's PATH environment variable.\n\n2. **Convert PDF to Images Using Python:**\n\n   Here's a sample script that converts each page of a PDF into an image:\n\n   ```python\n   from pdf2image import convert_from_path\n\n   # Function to convert PDF to images\n   def pdf_to_images(pdf_path, output_folder, dpi=200):\n       # Convert each page of the PDF to an image\n       images = convert_from_path(pdf_path, dpi=dpi)\n       \n       # Save each image to the specified output folder\n       for i, image in enumerate(images):\n           image_path = f\"{output_folder}/page_{i+1}.png\"\n           image.save(image_path, \"PNG\")\n           print(f\"Saved {image_path}\")\n\n   # Example usage\n   pdf_path = 'your_file.pdf'\n   output_folder = 'output_images'\n   pdf_to_images(pdf_path, output_folder)\n   ```\n\n3. **Adjust DPI for Quality and Size:**\n\n   The `dpi` parameter controls the resolution of the output images. A higher DPI will result in better quality images but larger file sizes. You can adjust the `dpi` value to find a balance between quality and file size that suits your needs.\n\n4. **Handling Multiple PDFs:**\n\n   If you have multiple PDFs to convert, you can loop through the files and apply the conversion function to each one.\n\nThis approach should help you convert your PDFs into lightweight and readable images. If you encounter any specific issues with certain files, you can adjust the settings or explore additional image processing techniques using `Pillow` to further optimize the images."
