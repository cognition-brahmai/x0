I have been able to achieve this in TensorFlow but I am having trouble replicating the same in PyTorch. The code I tried in PyTorch seems to take more time. The code is as follows:\n\n```python\nwith torch.cuda.device(0):\n    A = A.cuda()\nwith torch.cuda.device(1):\n    B = B.cuda()\nC = matpow(A, n) + matpow(B, n).cuda(0)\n```\nI am aware that there is a module to parallelize models on the batch dimension using `torch.nn.DataParallel`, but in this case, I am trying to do something more basic. How can I achieve this parallelization in PyTorch?"

        "content": "To parallelize the computation of `C = A^n + B^n` across two GPUs in PyTorch, you need to ensure that each computation (`A^n` and `B^n`) is explicitly assigned to its respective GPU and executed concurrently. Your current approach does not fully leverage PyTorch's asynchronous execution capabilities. Here's a refined version of your code to achieve parallelization:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef matpow(x, n):\n    result = x.clone()\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        result = torch.mm(result, x)\n    return result\n\n# Assuming A and B are already defined and are of appropriate dimensions\nA = A.cuda(0)  # Move A to GPU 0\nB = B.cuda(1)  # Move B to GPU 1\n\n# Create streams to parallelize execution\nstream0 = torch.cuda.Stream(device=0)\nstream1 = torch.cuda.Stream(device=1)\n\n# Launch kernel for A^n on GPU 0\nwith torch.cuda.stream(stream0):\n    An = matpow(A, n)\n\n# Launch kernel for B^n on GPU 1\nwith torch.cuda.stream(stream1):\n    Bn = matpow(B, n)\n\n# Wait for computations to complete\nstream0.synchronize()\nstream1.synchronize()\n\n# Move B^n result to GPU 0 and add\nBn = Bn.to(0)\nC = An + Bn\n\nprint(C)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **`cuda()` Method**: Ensure `A` is moved to GPU 0 and `B` to GPU 1 using `.cuda(device_id)`.\n\n2. **Streams**: Use CUDA streams to overlap the execution of operations on different GPUs. Each GPU can execute its stream independently without waiting for the other to complete.\n\n3. **Synchronization**: Use `stream.synchronize()` to ensure each GPU completes its computation before proceeding to the addition step.\n\n4. **Data Transfer**: After computing `B^n` on GPU 1, transfer it back to GPU 0 using `.to(0)` before performing the final addition.\n\nThis setup should help in parallelizing the computation efficiently by making sure each GPU works independently on its task before combining the results."
