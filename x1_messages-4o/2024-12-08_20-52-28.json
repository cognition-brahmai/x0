        "content": "To find the total number of squares on a chessboard, we need to consider all possible square sizes that can be formed within the 8x8 grid, not just the individual 1x1 squares.\n\nHere's how we can calculate it step-by-step:\n\n1. **1x1 Squares**: Each square on the chessboard is a 1x1 square. Since the chessboard is an 8x8 grid, it contains:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 8 = 64 \\text{ squares}\n   \\]\n\n2. **2x2 Squares**: A 2x2 square can be formed by choosing a starting point from one of the top-left corners of these squares. The top-left corner of a 2x2 square can be in one of the first 7 rows and first 7 columns, so there are:\n   \\[\n   7 \\times 7 = 49 \\text{ squares}\n   \\]\n\n3. **3x3 Squares**: Similarly, for 3x3 squares, the top-left corner can be in one of the first 6 rows and columns:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 6 = 36 \\text{ squares}\n   \\]\n\n4. **4x4 Squares**: For 4x4 squares, the top-left corner can be in one of the first 5 rows and columns:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 5 = 25 \\text{ squares}\n   \\]\n\n5. **5x5 Squares**: For 5x5 squares, the top-left corner can be in one of the first 4 rows and columns:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 4 = 16 \\text{ squares}\n   \\]\n\n6. **6x6 Squares**: For 6x6 squares, the top-left corner can be in one of the first 3 rows and columns:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 3 = 9 \\text{ squares}\n   \\]\n\n7. **7x7 Squares**: For 7x7 squares, the top-left corner can be in one of the first 2 rows and columns:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ squares}\n   \\]\n\n8. **8x8 Squares**: The entire chessboard itself is an 8x8 square:\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 1 = 1 \\text{ square}\n   \\]\n\nTo find the total number of squares on the chessboard, we sum up all these squares:\n\\[\n64 + 49 + 36 + 25 + 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 204\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of squares on the chessboard is 204."
