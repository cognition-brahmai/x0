        "content": "A unique feature of an electric scooter could be its regenerative braking system. This system allows the scooter to convert kinetic energy, usually lost during braking, back into stored energy in the battery. This not only enhances the scooter's energy efficiency by extending its range but also reduces wear and tear on the mechanical braking components, leading to lower maintenance costs and increased longevity of the vehicle. Additionally, regenerative braking contributes to a smoother and more controlled stopping experience, enhancing overall ride comfort and safety."
