I'm not sure what 'py35_0' signifies, though I assume it's the version of Python against which the package was built. I'm also unsure about the meaning of 'defaults'. Can someone help me with the correct command to install this specific version of the package and explain these terms?"

        "content": "To install a specific version of a package using Conda, you need to specify both the version of the package and, if necessary, the Python version it is built against. Here's a breakdown of the terms and how you can install the specific version you need:\n\n1. **Versioning**:\n   - `1.3.0` is the version of the 'rope' package you want to install.\n   - `py35_0` indicates that this version of the package was built for Python 3.5. The `0` at the end is the build number and can usually be ignored unless there are multiple builds for the same version.\n\n2. **Channel**:\n   - `defaults` refers to the default Anaconda channel from which packages are fetched.\n\nTo install the specific version of the `rope` package that you want, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\nconda install rope=1.3.0=py35_0\n```\n\nHere's what each part of the command does:\n- `rope=1.3.0` specifies the package name and the version you want.\n- `=py35_0` specifies the build, in this case for Python 3.5.\n\nBefore running the command, ensure that your active Conda environment is using Python 3.5, because the `py35_0` build of the package is specifically for Python 3.5. You can check your Python version in the current environment using:\n\n```bash\npython --version\n```\n\nIf your environment is not using Python 3.5, you might need to create a new environment with that Python version:\n\n```bash\nconda create -n myenv python=3.5\nconda activate myenv\n```\n\nThen run the install command in this new environment. This should ensure compatibility with the package build you are trying to install."
