I'm looking to divide this application into multiple Python files to manage the number of routes in `test.py`. Specifically, I want to create a `test2.py` file that contains routes not handled in `test.py`. I want this setup so that running `python test.py` will also pick up the routes on `test2.py` as if it were part of the same file. Could you guide me on the changes required in `test.py` and/or what to include in `test2.py` to achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired setup where you have multiple files for your Flask routes and running `python test.py` picks up routes from `test2.py`, you can use Flask Blueprints. Blueprints allow you to organize your application into modules, making it easier to manage as it grows.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to set this up:\n\n1. **Create `test.py`:** This will be your main application file. It will import and register the blueprint defined in `test2.py`.\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom test2 import test2_blueprint\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n# Register the blueprint\napp.register_blueprint(test2_blueprint)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef home():\n    return \"This is the home page from test.py\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n2. **Create `test2.py`:** This file will define a blueprint and contain the routes you want to separate from `test.py`.\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Blueprint\n\n# Create a blueprint\ntest2_blueprint = Blueprint('test2', __name__)\n\n@test2_blueprint.route('/test2')\ndef test2_route():\n    return \"This is a route from test2.py\"\n\n# Add more routes here as needed\n@test2_blueprint.route('/another-route')\ndef another_route():\n    return \"Another route from test2.py\"\n```\n\n3. **Explanation:**\n\n   - **Blueprint Creation:** In `test2.py`, you create a `Blueprint` object. This object represents a collection of routes and other application functionalities which you can register on the main application object (`app`).\n   \n   - **Route Definition:** Define routes within `test2.py` using the `test2_blueprint.route()` decorator instead of `app.route()`. This tells Flask that these routes are part of the `test2_blueprint`.\n   \n   - **Registering the Blueprint:** In `test.py`, you import the `test2_blueprint` and register it on the main Flask app using `app.register_blueprint(test2_blueprint)`.\n\n4. **Running the Application:** Now, when you run `python test.py`, Flask will start and all routes defined in both `test.py` and `test2.py` will be available.\n\nThis setup allows you to modularize your application by separating routes into different files, making it easier to maintain and extend. You can create additional files and blueprints in a similar manner as your application grows."
