I'm working with two lists like this:\n\n```python\nlist1 = [1, 2]\nlist2 = [3, 4]\n```\n\nI'd like the resulting list to look like this:\n\n```python\n[[[1,3], [2,4]], [[1,4], [2,3]]]\n```\n\nI've been trying to use the itertools module, but the closest I've gotten with `itertools.product()` is this:\n\n```python\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nlist2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]\nprint list(itertools.product(list1, list2))\n```\n\nWhich produces:\n\n```python\n[(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8)]\n```\n\nThis does all the possible combinations of items in each list, but not all the possible resulting lists. How can I achieve the desired output?"

        "content": "To generate all possible combinations of two lists where each combination is a pair of lists, you can use the `itertools.permutations` function to generate permutations of `list2` and then combine them with `list1`. Here's how you can achieve the desired output:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nlist1 = [1, 2]\nlist2 = [3, 4]\n\n# Generate all permutations of list2\npermutations_of_list2 = itertools.permutations(list2)\n\n# Create combinations by pairing list1 with each permutation of list2\ncombinations = []\nfor perm in permutations_of_list2:\n    combined = [[list1[i], perm[i]] for i in range(len(list1))]\n    combinations.append(combined)\n\nprint(combinations)\n```\n\nThis will produce the desired output:\n\n```python\n[[[1, 3], [2, 4]], [[1, 4], [2, 3]]]\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what this code does:\n1. It generates all permutations of `list2` using `itertools.permutations`.\n2. For each permutation, it pairs each element with the corresponding element in `list1`.\n3. It collects these pairs into a list and appends them to the `combinations` list.\n\nThis approach works well for lists of equal length, as it assumes `list1` and `list2` have the same number of elements."
