Here is what I've done so far:\n\n```python\nplt.scatter(x, y, c=tag)\nplt.colorbar()\n```\n\nThe tag is typically an integer ranging from 0-20 but the exact range may change. The default settings provide me with a continuous range of colors, but I would like a set of n discrete colors (n=20 in this example). Ideally, a tag value of 0 would produce a gray color and 1-20 would be colorful. I've found some 'cookbook' scripts but they are very complicated. Is there a simpler way to solve this problem?"

        "content": "Certainly! To create a discrete colorbar for a scatter plot in Matplotlib where each point is represented with a unique color based on an integer tag value, you can use a `ListedColormap` to define a set of discrete colors. You can also use the `BoundaryNorm` to ensure that the colors are mapped correctly to your integer tags. Here's a simplified approach:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.colors as mcolors\n\n# Example data\nx = np.random.rand(100)\ny = np.random.rand(100)\ntag = np.random.randint(0, 21, size=100)\n\n# Define a colormap with 21 colors (1 gray and 20 colorful)\ncolors = ['gray'] + [plt.cm.viridis(i) for i in np.linspace(0, 1, 20)]\ncmap = mcolors.ListedColormap(colors)\n\n# Define the normalization\nbounds = np.arange(-0.5, 21.5, 1)  # 21 boundaries for 21 discrete values\nnorm = mcolors.BoundaryNorm(bounds, cmap.N)\n\n# Create the scatter plot\nscatter = plt.scatter(x, y, c=tag, cmap=cmap, norm=norm)\n\n# Add a colorbar with discrete ticks\ncbar = plt.colorbar(scatter, ticks=np.arange(21))\ncbar.set_label('Tag Value')\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.xlabel('X-axis')\nplt.ylabel('Y-axis')\nplt.title('Scatter Plot with Discrete Colorbar')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **ListedColormap**: We create a list of colors, with the first color being gray and the rest being generated from the `viridis` colormap. This gives us a total of 21 colors.\n- **BoundaryNorm**: This is used to map the integer tag values to the correct color in the colormap. The `bounds` array defines the edges of each color segment.\n- **Colorbar Ticks**: By setting `ticks=np.arange(21)`, the colorbar will have discrete ticks corresponding to each integer tag value from 0 to 20.\n\nThis setup will give you a discrete colorbar that aligns with the integer tag values, providing a clear and visually distinct representation of each unique tag."
