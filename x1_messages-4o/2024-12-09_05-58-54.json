        "content": "Why does the `getattr` function not support consecutive attribute retrievals in Python? For example, if I set up two classes A and B, and set b as an attribute of a and c as an attribute of b, I can access b through a and c through b, but if I try to use `getattr` to access c through a and b, I get an AttributeError. Here's the code I'm using:\n```python\nclass A(): pass\n\na = A()\nb = A()\n\na.b = b\nb.c = 1\n\na.b     # this is b\ngetattr(a, \"b\") # so is this\n\na.b.c   # this is 1   \ngetattr(a, \"b.c\") # this raises an AttributeError\n```\nIt seems natural to me that `getattr(a, \"b.c\")` should return 1, but it doesn't. What's the reason behind this?"

        "content": "The `getattr` function in Python is designed to retrieve a single attribute from an object, as specified by the attribute name passed to it. When you call `getattr(a, \"b.c\")`, it tries to find an attribute named `\"b.c\"` directly on the object `a`, which doesn't exist, thus raising an `AttributeError`.\n\nThe reason `getattr` doesn't support dot notation for consecutive attribute retrievals is because each attribute access is treated as a separate operation. The dot notation `a.b.c` is effectively two separate attribute accesses: first `a.b`, which returns an object (in this case, `b`), and then `b.c`, which returns another attribute (in this case, `1`). \n\nIf you want to use `getattr` to achieve the same effect as `a.b.c`, you need to chain your calls to `getattr`, like so:\n\n```python\nintermediate = getattr(a, \"b\")  # This retrieves b from a\nresult = getattr(intermediate, \"c\")  # This retrieves c from b\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you want a single function call to handle the dot notation string, you can implement a utility function to do so:\n\n```python\ndef nested_getattr(obj, attr):\n    attributes = attr.split('.')\n    for attribute in attributes:\n        obj = getattr(obj, attribute)\n    return obj\n\n# Usage\nresult = nested_getattr(a, \"b.c\")  # This should return 1\n```\n\nThis `nested_getattr` function splits the attribute string by dots and retrieves each attribute sequentially, allowing you to access nested attributes in one go."
