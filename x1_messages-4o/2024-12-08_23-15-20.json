Here's how you can categorize these animals:\n\n1. **Cheetah**: Predator - Cheetahs are known for their speed and are adept hunters, primarily preying on animals like gazelles and other small to medium-sized ungulates.\n\n2. **Elephant**: Prey - While elephants are large and have few natural predators due to their size, they can still fall prey to large predator groups like lions, particularly when they are young or sick.\n\n3. **Rabbit**: Prey - Rabbits are herbivores and are commonly preyed upon by a variety of predators, including foxes, hawks, and coyotes."
