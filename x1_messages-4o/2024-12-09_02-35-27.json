For example, when I use a simple `open('test.txt', 'r')`, it doesn't work, even though I'm sure the file exists on the same level as the running Python file. I get the following error: \"FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:\". I've tried several solutions like changing `test.txt` to `./test.txt`, closing the project, deleting the .idea folder, opening the folder with code, reinstalling and installing the latest version of PyCharm, even invalidating caches and restarting. Unfortunately, none of these options have worked for me. Is there a way to tell PyCharm to refresh the current working directory or even to see where it thinks the current working directory is? I should also mention that running the script in a terminal window works, so it seems to be a problem specifically with PyCharm, not with the script itself."

        "content": "When working with PyCharm, issues with relative paths usually arise from the configuration of the working directory. Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve this problem and ensure that PyCharm is using the correct working directory:\n\n1. **Check the Working Directory in Run Configuration:**\n   - Go to `Run` in the top menu and select `Edit Configurations...`.\n   - In the Run/Debug Configurations window, make sure that the script you are trying to run is selected on the left.\n   - Look for the \"Working directory\" field. By default, it may not be set correctly, which can cause relative path issues.\n   - Click the folder icon next to it and set it to the directory where your script and `test.txt` are located.\n   - Apply the changes and try running your script again.\n\n2. **Verify Project Structure:**\n   - Ensure that your project structure is correctly set up in PyCharm. Sometimes, the folder containing your script is not marked as the source root, which could affect file access.\n   - Right-click on the folder containing your script in the Project pane and select `Mark Directory as` -> `Sources Root`.\n\n3. **Check for Virtual Environment:**\n   - If you're using a virtual environment, make sure that it's properly activated in PyCharm. Misconfigured environments can sometimes cause unexpected behavior.\n\n4. **Use Absolute Paths for Testing:**\n   - As a temporary measure, use an absolute path to access `test.txt` to verify that the rest of your script works correctly. This won't solve the relative path issue but can help isolate the problem.\n\n5. **Debugging Output:**\n   - Add a line in your script to print the current working directory to help diagnose the problem:\n     ```python\n     import os\n     print(\"Current Working Directory:\", os.getcwd())\n     ```\n   - This will show you where PyCharm is looking for `test.txt`.\n\n6. **Environment Variables:**\n   - Ensure no environment variables are affecting the path resolution. Sometimes, specific environment configurations can lead PyCharm to use an incorrect working directory.\n\nBy checking and adjusting the working directory settings in PyCharm and verifying the project structure, you should be able to resolve the relative path issue. If the problem persists, consider checking the PyCharm logs for any additional clues or errors that might indicate what's going wrong."
