        "content": "To determine the probability of success under the given constraints, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **First Toss:** The first toss must result in heads. Since the coin is fair, the probability of getting heads is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Second and Third Tosses:** These must result in different outcomes. There are two possible scenarios for different outcomes:\n   - Second toss is heads, and third toss is tails (HT).\n   - Second toss is tails, and third toss is heads (TH).\n\nFor each scenario:\n- The probability of HT (where H is heads and T is tails) is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n- The probability of TH is similarly \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\n3. **Combining the Conditions:** The probability of each complete sequence (first toss is heads, second and third are different) is:\n   - Heads, Heads, Tails (HHT): Probability is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n   - Heads, Tails, Heads (HTH): Probability is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\n4. **Total Probability of Success:** Since HHT and HTH are mutually exclusive and both satisfy the constraints, the total probability of success is the sum of their probabilities:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of success under the given conditions is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)."
