For instance, in the following code snippet:\n\n```python\n[print (\"bla1\") and print (\"bla2\") for i in list]\n```\nI expect that for a list of length 4, I would get the following output:\n\n```\nbla1\nbla2\nbla1\nbla2\nbla1\nbla2\nbla1\nbla2\n```\nHowever, I am struggling to find the correct way to do this in the documentation. Additionally, I would also like to understand how to create a new list from an old one where I might need to perform multiple operations on the elements. For example, if I have a list of lists, I would want to create a new list that is a result of manipulating these sublists."

        "content": "To perform multiple actions in a Python list comprehension, you can use a couple of approaches. The key here is to understand that list comprehensions are generally meant for creating lists, and they are not usually used for executing multiple statements because they expect a single expression. However, you can achieve your goal using some tricks.\n\n### Printing Multiple Messages\n\nTo print multiple lines as you described, you can simply include both `print` statements in a tuple or use a loop inside a function. Here's how you can do it:\n\n#### Using a Tuple:\n```python\n# Define the list you want to iterate over\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n# Use a tuple to execute multiple actions\n[ (print(\"bla1\"), print(\"bla2\")) for _ in my_list ]\n```\n\nThis will print:\n```\nbla1\nbla2\nbla1\nbla2\nbla1\nbla2\nbla1\nbla2\n```\n\n#### Using a Function:\nAnother way to handle this is to define a function that performs the operations you want, and then call that function within the list comprehension:\n\n```python\ndef print_both():\n    print(\"bla1\")\n    print(\"bla2\")\n\n# Use the function in the list comprehension\n[ print_both() for _ in my_list ]\n```\n\n### Manipulating a List of Lists\n\nIf you want to create a new list from an old one and perform multiple operations on each element, you can use a similar approach by defining functions for the operations you want to perform or by using inline operations.\n\n#### Example:\nSuppose you have a list of lists and you want to, for example, double each element of the sublists:\n\n```python\nmy_list_of_lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]\n\n# Create a new list by doubling each element in the sublists\nnew_list = [[element * 2 for element in sublist] for sublist in my_list_of_lists]\n\nprint(new_list)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n```\n[[2, 4], [6, 8], [10, 12]]\n```\n\nIn this example, we used nested list comprehensions to perform operations on each element of the sublists.\n\nBy using functions or tuples, you can elegantly handle multiple actions in list comprehensions. This way, you keep your code clean and understandable."
