The function should also output the largest and smallest prime numbers found in the array, as well as the total count of prime numbers. The input array should be sorted in descending order before the function is applied. \nThe function should be able to handle arrays of any size and should not use any external libraries or modules. Additionally, the function should be able to handle arrays with negative numbers and zero, but these should be excluded from the prime number count and sum. \nFor example, given the input array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], the function should return the sum of the prime numbers (2 + 3 + 5 + 7), the largest prime number (7), the smallest prime number (2), and the count of prime numbers (4). \nYou may assume that the input array contains only integers and that the integers are unique."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to implement a function that processes an array of integers and extracts prime numbers, computing their sum, the largest and smallest values, and their count. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Sorting the Array**: The input array should be sorted in descending order.\n2. **Prime Check**: We'll need a helper function to determine if a number is prime.\n3. **Processing the Array**: We'll iterate through the sorted array, identify prime numbers, and compute the desired outputs.\n\nBelow is the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is a prime number.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef process_primes(arr):\n    \"\"\"Process the array and return the sum, largest, smallest, and count of prime numbers.\"\"\"\n    # Sort the array in descending order\n    arr.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Initialize variables to store results\n    prime_sum = 0\n    prime_count = 0\n    largest_prime = None\n    smallest_prime = None\n    \n    # Iterate over the array to identify primes\n    for num in arr:\n        if is_prime(num):\n            if largest_prime is None:  # First prime found\n                largest_prime = num\n            smallest_prime = num  # Update smallest prime\n            prime_sum += num\n            prime_count += 1\n    \n    # Return the results as a tuple\n    return prime_sum, largest_prime, smallest_prime, prime_count\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nresult = process_primes(input_array)\nprint(\"Sum of primes:\", result[0])\nprint(\"Largest prime:\", result[1])\nprint(\"Smallest prime:\", result[2])\nprint(\"Count of primes:\", result[3])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`is_prime` Function**: This function checks if a number is prime. It handles edge cases by returning `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1 and implements a basic primality test for larger numbers.\n- **`process_primes` Function**: This function sorts the array in descending order and iterates through it. It uses the `is_prime` helper function to check each number. It keeps track of the sum, count, largest, and smallest prime numbers found.\n- **Output**: The function returns a tuple containing the sum of primes, the largest and smallest primes, and the count of primes.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the array and provides the required information about the prime numbers."
