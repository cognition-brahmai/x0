For example, if I have the list `values = ['1','2','3']`, how can I save it to a file such that it retains its format i.e. '['1','2','3']'? Currently, I manually print parts of the list in the terminal and copy those into a .txt file."

        "content": "Yes, you can save a list to a `.txt` file while maintaining its format using Python. You can achieve this by writing the list as a string representation to a file. Here's a simple way to do it:\n\n```python\nvalues = ['1', '2', '3']\n\n# Open or create a text file in write mode\nwith open('output.txt', 'w') as file:\n    # Convert the list to its string representation and write it to the file\n    file.write(str(values))\n```\n\nThis code snippet will create a file named `output.txt` (or overwrite it if it already exists) and write the list `values` to the file in the same format as you see it in Python, i.e., `['1', '2', '3']`.\n\nWhen you open `output.txt`, you'll see the content formatted as you wanted."
