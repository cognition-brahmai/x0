        "content": "To generate a quarterly sales performance report from your SQL database and present it in an Excel table format, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: SQL Query to Retrieve Data\n\nFirst, you'll need to write a SQL query to extract the necessary data from your \"sales\" table. Assuming you want to analyze the last quarter's data, here is a sample query that calculates total revenue, total quantity sold, and average revenue per unit for each product:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    product,\n    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity_sold,\n    SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue,\n    CASE WHEN SUM(quantity) > 0 THEN SUM(revenue) / SUM(quantity) ELSE 0 END AS average_revenue_per_unit\nFROM\n    sales\nWHERE\n    date >= DATEADD(QUARTER, DATEDIFF(QUARTER, 0, GETDATE()) - 1, 0) AND\n    date < DATEADD(QUARTER, DATEDIFF(QUARTER, 0, GETDATE()), 0)\nGROUP BY\n    product\nORDER BY\n    product;\n```\n\n### Step 2: Export the Data to Excel\n\nOnce you have executed the SQL query and obtained the results, you can export this data to Excel. This can usually be done using your database management tool's export functionality (e.g., MySQL Workbench, SQL Server Management Studio, or any other tool you are using).\n\n### Step 3: Format the Excel Table\n\nAfter exporting the data, open the Excel file and format the data as a table to make it presentable:\n\n1. **Select the Data Range**: Click and drag to select the range of data that you exported.\n   \n2. **Format as Table**: Go to the \"Home\" tab on the Excel ribbon, and click \"Format as Table.\" Choose a table style you prefer.\n\n3. **Add Table Headers**: Ensure your table has the following headers:\n   - Product\n   - Total Quantity Sold\n   - Total Revenue\n   - Average Revenue Per Unit\n\n4. **Adjust Column Widths**: Adjust the widths of the columns so that all data is visible.\n\n5. **Add Filters and Sorting**: If desired, you can add filters to each column to allow stakeholders to sort and filter the data according to their needs.\n\n### Step 4: Share the Excel File\n\nSave the Excel file and share it with stakeholders via email or a shared drive, ensuring they have access to the file.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll have created a quarterly sales performance report in an Excel table format that can be easily shared and interpreted by stakeholders."
