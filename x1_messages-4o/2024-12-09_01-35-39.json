Can anyone guide me on how to set this up properly?"

You can do this by running:\n   ```bash\n   pip install pylint\n   ```\n\n2. **Configure Pylint as an External Tool**:\n   - Open PyCharm and go to `File > Settings` (or `PyCharm > Preferences` on macOS).\n   - Navigate to `Tools > External Tools`.\n   - Click on the `+` button to add a new tool.\n\n3. **Fill in the Details**:\n   In the dialog that appears, fill in the following details:\n\n   - **Name**: Pylint\n   - **Program**: Path to your Python interpreter. You can find this path in `File > Settings > Project: [Your Project] > Python Interpreter`.\n   - **Arguments**: Fill this with the following:\n     ```bash\n     -m pylint $FilePathRelativeToProjectRoot$\n     ```\n   - **Working directory**: Use `$ProjectFileDir$`.\n\n4. **Advanced Options**:\n   Optionally, you can configure additional options under the \"Advanced Options\" section:\n   - **Synchronize files after execution**: Check this if you want PyCharm to refresh files after running Pylint.\n   - **Open console for tool output**: Check this if you want to see Pylint output in the console.\n\n5. **Run Pylint**:\n   - After you've set up Pylint as an external tool, you can run it by right-clicking on any file or directory in the Project view, selecting `External Tools`, and choosing `Pylint`.\n   - You can also run it from the `Tools` menu at the top.\n\n6. **Use `__init__.py`**:\n   If you want to treat directories as packages, ensure you have `__init__.py` files in those directories. However, this is more relevant to how Python treats directories and modules, and less about Pylint configuration.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully configure and use Pylint as an external tool in PyCharm. This setup allows you to lint your Python files directly from within the IDE, making it easier to ensure code quality and consistency."
