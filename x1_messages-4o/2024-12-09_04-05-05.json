        "content": "In your scenario, you're mixing a Sequential model with a Functional API by using a stateful LSTM. When using a stateful LSTM with the Sequential API, the state is preserved across batches within the same model call, but when you use the Functional API like you've done, it's important to understand how state management works.\n\n### Stateful LSTM Behavior\n\n1. **State Preservation:** In your example, `model(input_1)` and `model(input_2)` are separate function calls. The state of the LSTM is typically preserved across batches in the same session, but in a functional call setting like this, the state is not preserved between calls unless explicitly managed.\n\n2. **State Reset:** If you want to reset the states of the LSTM between calls or after each batch, Keras provides a method `model.reset_states()`. You should call `model.reset_states()` after `model(input_1)` and before you call `model(input_2)` if you want to start the second input sequence with a clean state.\n\n### How to Implement This\n\nHere's how you can manage the states manually:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.models import Model\nfrom keras.layers import Input, LSTM\n\n# Define the stateful LSTM model\ninput_shape = (...)  # Define your input shape\nstateful_lstm_layer = LSTM(..., stateful=True, batch_input_shape=input_shape)\n\n# Create Functional Model\ninput_1 = Input(shape=input_shape[1:])\ninput_2 = Input(shape=input_shape[1:])\n\noutput_1 = stateful_lstm_layer(input_1)\nmodel = Model(inputs=input_1, outputs=output_1)\n\n# Call with input_1\noutput_1_result = model(input_1)\n\n# Reset states\nmodel.reset_states()\n\n# Optionally, if you want to process input_2\noutput_2_result = model(input_2)\n```\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n- **Batch Size:** When using stateful LSTMs, ensure that the `batch_input_shape` is specified correctly and that the batch size remains consistent between calls.\n- **State Management:** Always remember that stateful LSTM states need to be managed carefully. Reset states when you need to start processing a new sequence or batch.\n- **Model Design:** Consider using model subclassing if you need more control over the state management and sequence processing, especially when combining Sequential and Functional APIs.\n\nThis approach allows you to control when the LSTM states are reset, ensuring that you can handle sequences independently as needed."
