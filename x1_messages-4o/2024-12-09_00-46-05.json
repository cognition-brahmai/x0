I am currently using the following script to read the file:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport sys\n\nfilename = sys.argv[1]\ndf = pd.read_csv(filename)\n```\n\nI currently have to manually open each file in a text editor and remove the last line. Is there a way to automate this process within the same Python/pandas script that loads the CSV?"

        "content": "Yes, you can automate the process of excluding the last line when reading a CSV file using pandas by utilizing the `skipfooter` parameter in the `pd.read_csv` function. This parameter allows you to skip a specified number of lines at the bottom of the file. Here's how you can modify your script to skip the last line:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport sys\n\nfilename = sys.argv[1]\ndf = pd.read_csv(filename, skipfooter=1, engine='python')\n\n# Now you can work with the DataFrame `df` as needed\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **`skipfooter` Parameter:** This parameter specifies the number of lines you want to skip at the end of the file. By setting it to `1`, you skip the last line.\n- **`engine='python'`:** The `skipfooter` parameter requires the Python engine because the default C engine does not support it. \n\nBy incorporating this change into your script, you can automatically handle CSV files that have a potentially corrupt last line without needing to manually edit them."
