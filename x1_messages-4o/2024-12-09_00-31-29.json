My directory structure is as follows: \n```\ndubliners/book/  [includes models.py, views.py, etc.]\ndubliners/templates/book/\n```\nI need to display a JPG image in the header of each web page. I'm unsure where I should store the image file or what path I should use for the `<img>` tag in the template to display the image. I've tried various locations and paths without success. I've even tried using both relative and absolute paths to the image but I still get a broken image icon displayed on the web page. For instance, I used the following tag in my template for an image in my home directory:\n```html\n<img src=\"/home/tony/london.jpg\" />\n```\nBut, the image doesn't display. If I save the web page as a static HTML file, the images are displayed, so the path seems to be correct. Could it be that the default Django web server only displays images if they're on a specific path?"

        "content": "In Django, serving static files such as images is handled differently from serving dynamic content. When you're developing locally with Django, you need to ensure that your static files are properly configured so the Django development server knows where to find them.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to help you display your image correctly:\n\n1. **Create a Static Directory:**\n   Inside your Django app (in this case, within `dubliners/book/`), create a folder named `static`. Within this `static` directory, create another folder named `book` to keep your app's static files organized.\n\n   ```\n   dubliners/book/static/book/\n   ```\n\n2. **Move Your Image:**\n   Place your `london.jpg` image inside the `dubliners/book/static/book/` directory.\n\n3. **Configure Static Files in `settings.py`:**\n   Make sure your `settings.py` file has the correct configuration for static files. Add or update these settings:\n\n   ```python\n   STATIC_URL = '/static/'\n\n   STATICFILES_DIRS = [\n       BASE_DIR / \"dubliners/book/static\",\n   ]\n   ```\n\n4. **Update Your Template:**\n   In your HTML template, use the `{% static %}` template tag to refer to the image. First, ensure you have `{% load static %}` at the top of your template file, then update your `<img>` tag:\n\n   ```html\n   {% load static %}\n   <img src=\"{% static 'book/london.jpg' %}\" alt=\"London Image\" />\n   ```\n\n5. **Run the Development Server:**\n   Make sure you restart the Django development server to apply any changes.\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py runserver\n   ```\n\n6. **Access the Page:**\n   Navigate to the page where you expect the image to appear. The image should now display correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, you're ensuring that Django knows where to find your static files and serves them correctly during development. Remember, when you deploy your Django project to a production server, you'll need to handle static files differently, usually by configuring your web server to serve them or using a dedicated service like AWS S3."
