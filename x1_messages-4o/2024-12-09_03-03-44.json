        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the way you're trying to merge the models. The `merge` function is not directly applicable to Sequential models in the way you've used it. Instead, you need to work with the functional API of Keras, which allows for more flexible model architectures, such as merging two models. Here's a way to do it using the functional API:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.layers import Input, Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, Dropout, Flatten, Dense\nfrom keras.models import Model\nfrom keras.layers import add  # or use concatenate, multiply, etc., depending on your need\n\ndef create_merged_model(input_shape):\n    # Define the input layer\n    input_layer = Input(shape=input_shape)\n    \n    # First model's layers\n    x1 = Conv1D(128, kernel_size=12, strides=4, padding='valid', activation='relu')(input_layer)\n    x1 = MaxPooling1D(pool_size=6)(x1)\n    x1 = Conv1D(256, kernel_size=12, strides=4, padding='valid', activation='relu')(x1)\n    x1 = MaxPooling1D(pool_size=6)(x1)\n    x1 = Dropout(.5)(x1)\n\n    # Second model's layers\n    x2 = Conv1D(128, kernel_size=20, strides=5, padding='valid', activation='relu')(input_layer)\n    x2 = MaxPooling1D(pool_size=5)(x2)\n    x2 = Conv1D(256, kernel_size=20, strides=5, padding='valid', activation='relu')(x2)\n    x2 = MaxPooling1D(pool_size=5)(x2)\n    x2 = Dropout(.5)(x2)\n\n    # Merge the outputs of the two models\n    merged = add([x1, x2])  # Use add, concatenate, multiply, etc., depending on what you need\n\n    # Continue with the rest of the model\n    flattened = Flatten()(merged)\n    dense1 = Dense(256, activation='relu')(flattened)\n    drop1 = Dropout(.5)(dense1)\n    dense2 = Dense(128, activation='relu')(drop1)\n    drop2 = Dropout(.35)(dense2)\n    output_layer = Dense(5, activation='softmax')(drop2)\n\n    # Create the model\n    model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)\n    \n    return model\n\n# Assuming input_shape is defined somewhere\nmodel = create_merged_model(input_shape)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Functional API**: This approach uses the `Model` class from Keras, which allows you to define complex architectures by explicitly specifying the inputs and outputs.\n\n2. **Layer Operations**: To merge layers, you can use operations like `add`, `concatenate`, `multiply`, etc., depending on the kind of operation you want to perform on the outputs of the two models.\n\n3. **Input Layer**: Start by defining an `Input` layer which will be shared by both branches of your model.\n\n4. **Output Specification**: End with specifying the `outputs` for the `Model` object.\n\nThis should resolve the error you are encountering and allow you to successfully merge the two sequential models."
