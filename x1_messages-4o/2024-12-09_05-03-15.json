For example, in a route like this:\n\n```python\n@app.route('/data/<section>')\ndef data(section):\n    print(section)\n```\n\nI can access the 'section' variable only from the 'data' endpoint, unless I pass it around as a function parameter. I also understand how to get query parameters by accessing the 'request' object, which works from the endpoint function as well as any other called function, without needing to pass anything around. For instance:\n\n```python\nrequest.args['param_name']\n```\n\nHowever, I am wondering if it is possible to access the path parameter (like 'section' in the above example) in the same way as the query parameters?"

        "content": "In Flask, path parameters are typically accessed directly within the route function where they are defined, as you've shown in your example. Unlike query parameters, which can be accessed globally via the `request` object, path parameters are not directly accessible outside the route function without explicitly passing them around.\n\nHowever, there is a way to make path parameters accessible in a similar manner to query parameters, by using Flask's `g` (global) object. The `g` object is a global namespace for holding data during a request, which allows you to store the path parameter and access it elsewhere in your application.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Use a before request handler to store the path parameter in `g`.\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, g\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.before_request\ndef before_request():\n    # Check if the request matches the route with the path parameter\n    if request.endpoint == 'data':\n        g.section = request.view_args.get('section')\n\n@app.route('/data/<section>')\ndef data(section):\n    # You can access `section` directly here\n    print(section)\n    # Or access it via `g` if you prefer\n    print(g.section)\n    return f\"Section: {section}\"\n\n@app.route('/other')\ndef other():\n    # Access the `section` path parameter in another endpoint\n    if hasattr(g, 'section'):\n        return f\"Section from another route: {g.section}\"\n    return \"No section available\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `before_request` function checks if the current endpoint is `data`. If it is, it stores the path parameter `section` in `g`. This makes it accessible in any other route or context during the same request, similar to how you'd access query parameters via `request.args`."
