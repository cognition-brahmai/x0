        "content": "To retrieve a list of customers who have placed more than three orders using SQL, you would typically need to have two tables: one for customers and one for orders. Let's assume the tables are structured as follows:\n\n- `Customers`: This table contains customer information.\n  - `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.\n  - `CustomerName`: Name of the customer.\n  - Other customer-related fields...\n\n- `Orders`: This table contains order information.\n  - `OrderID`: Unique identifier for each order.\n  - `CustomerID`: Foreign key linking the order to a customer.\n  - Other order-related fields...\n\nTo find customers who have placed more than three orders, you can use the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    C.CustomerID,\n    C.CustomerName,\n    COUNT(O.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders\nFROM\n    Customers C\nJOIN\n    Orders O ON C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID\nGROUP BY\n    C.CustomerID, C.CustomerName\nHAVING\n    COUNT(O.OrderID) > 3;\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the query:\n\n1. `SELECT` statement is used to specify the columns you want in the result: `CustomerID`, `CustomerName`, and the count of orders.\n\n2. `FROM` clause specifies the main table `Customers` with an alias `C`.\n\n3. `JOIN` clause is used to join the `Customers` table with the `Orders` table based on the `CustomerID`.\n\n4. `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by `CustomerID` and `CustomerName` to aggregate order counts for each customer.\n\n5. `HAVING` clause filters the groups to include only those with more than three orders by using `COUNT(O.OrderID) > 3`.\n\nThis query will return a list of customers who have placed more than three orders along with the count of their orders."
