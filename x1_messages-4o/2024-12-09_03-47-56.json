I attempted to register an instance of my class when the class is defined using the following code:\n\n```python\nregistry = {}\n\ndef register( cls ):\n   registry[cls.__name__] = cls() #problem here\n   return cls\n\n@register\nclass MyClass( Base ):\n   def __init__(self):\n      super( MyClass, self ).__init__() \n```\nHowever, this code generates a `NameError: global name 'MyClass' is not defined` error. The issue seems to be with the line where I'm trying to instantiate a `MyClass`, but the decorator hasn't returned yet so it doesn't exist. Is there a workaround for this, possibly using metaclasses?"

        "content": "You're correct that the issue arises because you're trying to instantiate `MyClass` before it's fully defined. To achieve auto-registration of a class when it's defined, using metaclasses is indeed a good approach. Metaclasses allow you to customize class creation, and you can use this mechanism to register your class instances automatically. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nregistry = {}\n\n# Define a metaclass\nclass AutoRegisterMeta(type):\n    def __init__(cls, name, bases, attrs):\n        super(AutoRegisterMeta, cls).__init__(name, bases, attrs)\n        # Register the instance\n        registry[name] = cls()\n\n# Use the metaclass in your class definition\nclass Base(metaclass=AutoRegisterMeta):\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\nclass MyClass(Base):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(MyClass, self).__init__()\n\n# Now MyClass will be auto-registered in the registry\nprint(registry)  # Output should show an instance of MyClass in the registry\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Metaclass Definition**: `AutoRegisterMeta` is a metaclass that overrides the `__init__` method. This method is called when a new class is created. In this method, you can access the class itself via the `cls` argument.\n\n2. **Registration**: Inside the `__init__` method of the metaclass, you create an instance of the class (`cls()`) and store it in the `registry` dictionary with the class name as the key.\n\n3. **Applying the Metaclass**: By defining `Base` to use `AutoRegisterMeta` as its metaclass, any subclass of `Base` will automatically use `AutoRegisterMeta` as its metaclass as well. This means that subclasses like `MyClass` will be registered as soon as they are defined.\n\nThis approach eliminates the issue with the class not being fully defined at the time of registration because the metaclass's `__init__` method is called after the class body has been fully processed."
