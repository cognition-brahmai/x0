Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]\n\n# Use slicing to get the first 10 elements\nfirst_10_elements = my_list[:10]\n\nprint(first_10_elements)\n```\n\nThis code uses the slicing syntax `my_list[:10]` to extract the first 10 elements from the list, which will output:\n\n```\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n```\n\nRemember to avoid using the name `list` for your variable as it shadows the built-in Python `list` type. It's better to use a different name, such as `my_list`, to avoid any potential issues."
