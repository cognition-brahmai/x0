        "content": "Certainly! You can create a function that iterates through the JSON data and checks the properties of each object to identify its type based on specific properties. Here's a Python function that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Sample JSON data\ndata = {\n    \"objects\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"phone\",\n            \"properties\": [\n                \"has touchscreen\",\n                \"used for communication\"\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"car\",\n            \"properties\": [\n                \"has wheels\",\n                \"used for transportation\"\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"laptop\",\n            \"properties\": [\n                \"has keyboard\",\n                \"used for computing\"\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\ndef identify_object_type(data, target_property):\n    # Iterate through each object in the JSON data\n    for obj in data[\"objects\"]:\n        # Check if the target property is in the object's properties\n        if target_property in obj[\"properties\"]:\n            # Print or return the name of the object\n            print(f'The object with the property \"{target_property}\" is: {obj[\"name\"]}')\n            return obj[\"name\"]\n    # If no object has the target property\n    print(f'No object found with the property \"{target_property}\".')\n    return None\n\n# Identify object with the property \"used for computing\"\nidentify_object_type(data, \"used for computing\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Data Structure**:\n   - The data is a dictionary containing a list of objects, each with a `name` and a list of `properties`.\n\n2. **Function**:\n   - `identify_object_type(data, target_property)`: This function takes the JSON data and a target property as inputs.\n   - It iterates over each object in the `objects` list.\n   - For each object, it checks if the `target_property` (e.g., \"used for computing\") is present in the `properties` list.\n   - If found, it prints and returns the name of the object.\n   - If no object with the target property is found, it prints a message indicating this.\n\n3. **Invocation**:\n   - The function is called with the target property \"used for computing\" to identify which object has this property.\n\nThis approach allows you to check for any specific property and identify the associated object dynamically."
