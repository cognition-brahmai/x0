This package has several \"extra_require\" packages and everything works fine when installing with \"pip install my_package\". Now, I have an extra package (let's call it \"extra1\") which requires a binary of a non-python library \"X\" to be called. The source code for this library \"X\" is included in the \"my_package\" codebase and is also part of the distribution. However, before \"X\" can be utilized, it has to be compiled into a binary on the target machine which is a C++ implementation. There is a Makefile in the \"X\" library optimized for different platform compilation, so all that's needed is to run \"make\" in the respective directory of the \"X\" library in the \"my_package\" when the build process is running. How can I run a terminal command (in this case \"make\") during the build process of the package using setuptools/distutils? And how can I ensure that this terminal command is executed only if the corresponding \"extra1\" is specified during the installation process? For example, if someone runs \"pip install my_package\", no additional compilation of library \"X\" should happen. But if someone runs \"pip install my_package [extra1]\", the \"X\" module needs to be compiled so that the corresponding binary would be created and available on the target machine."

        "content": "To achieve the compilation of the C++ library \"X\" only when the \"extra1\" option is specified during the installation of your package, you can customize the build process using `setuptools`. The idea is to create a custom command in the `setup.py` that will execute the `make` command when the `extra1` is specified, and then hook this custom command into the build process.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Define a Custom Build Command:**\n\n   You will need to create a custom build command that runs `make` in the directory where the source code of the library \"X\" is located.\n\n   ```python\n   from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n   from setuptools.command.build_ext import build_ext\n   import subprocess\n   import os\n\n   class CustomBuildExt(build_ext):\n       def run(self):\n           if 'extra1' in self.distribution.extras_require:\n               self.run_make()\n           super().run()\n\n       def run_make(self):\n           # Assuming 'X' is located in 'my_package/x_lib'\n           x_lib_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'my_package', 'x_lib')\n           subprocess.check_call(['make'], cwd=x_lib_dir)\n\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify Your `setup.py`:**\n\n   In your `setup.py`, you need to specify the `extras_require` for `extra1` and use the custom build command.\n\n   ```python\n   setup(\n       name='my_package',\n       version='0.1',\n       packages=find_packages(),\n       extras_require={\n           'extra1': ['some_dependency']  # list any Python dependencies for extra1\n       },\n       cmdclass={\n           'build_ext': CustomBuildExt,\n       },\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure Conditional Execution:**\n\n   The `run_make()` function is executed only when `extra1` is in `extras_require`. This ensures that the make process is only triggered when `pip install my_package[extra1]` is run.\n\n4. **Test Your Setup:**\n\n   Make sure you test your setup process in different environments to ensure that the `make` command is executed correctly when `extra1` is specified.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to compile the C++ library \"X\" only when the `extra1` is specified, keeping the installation process clean and efficient for users who don't need the extra functionality."
