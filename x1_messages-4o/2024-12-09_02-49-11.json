For example, when encountering a ZeroDivisionError in the file \"tmp.py\" at line 1, I want to format the output as \"ZeroDivisionError, tmp.py, 1\" instead of the standard traceback."

        "content": "To catch an exception in Python and extract specific information like the type of the exception, the file in which it occurred, and the line number, you can use the `traceback` module along with exception handling. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport traceback\n\ntry:\n    # Your code that may raise an exception\n    result = 1 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # Get the exception type\n    exception_type = type(e).__name__\n    \n    # Get the traceback object\n    tb = e.__traceback__\n    \n    # Extract the last traceback frame\n    filename = tb.tb_frame.f_code.co_filename\n    line_number = tb.tb_lineno\n    \n    # Format the output\n    formatted_output = f\"{exception_type}, {filename}, {line_number}\"\n    print(formatted_output)\n```\n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n1. The `try` block contains the code that may raise an exception.\n2. When an exception occurs, it is caught by the `except` block.\n3. `type(e).__name__` gives the name of the exception type.\n4. `e.__traceback__` provides the traceback object associated with the exception.\n5. From the traceback object, `tb_frame.f_code.co_filename` gives the filename and `tb_lineno` provides the line number where the exception occurred.\n6. Finally, the information is formatted and printed as required.\n\nThis will output:\n```\nZeroDivisionError, tmp.py, 1\n```\n\nReplace `1 / 0` with your actual code to catch different exceptions and get the information you need."
