I would like to print each item in the list followed by a comma, unless it is the last item in the list. However, my current code is not working as expected because it fails to print a comma after an item if it is the same as the last item in the list. How can I modify my code to always print a comma after an item unless it is the last item in the list? Here is my current code:\n\n```python\na = ['hello', 9, 3.14, 9]\nfor item in a:\n    print(item, end='')\n    if item != a[-1]:\n        print(', ')\n```\n\nThis code does not give me the output I want, which is:\n\n```python\nhello,\n9,\n3.14,\n9\n```\n\nInstead, it gives me this incorrect output:\n\n```python\nhello, \n93.14, \n9\n```\n\nI understand that this is because my code checks if the current item is not equal to the last item in the list before deciding whether to print a comma. However, I would like to modify my code so that it always prints a comma after an item unless the item is the actual last item in the list, not just equal to the last item."

        "content": "To achieve the desired output, you need to modify your code so that it checks the position of the item in the list rather than comparing the item itself with the last item. You can achieve this by using an index to determine if the current item is the last one in the list.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code that should work correctly:\n\n```python\na = ['hello', 9, 3.14, 9]\nfor index, item in enumerate(a):\n    print(item, end='')\n    if index != len(a) - 1:\n        print(', ', end='')\nprint()  # To ensure the output ends with a newline\n```\n\nHere's what this code does:\n\n- It uses `enumerate(a)` to iterate over the list `a` while keeping track of the current index.\n- It checks if the current index is not the last index (`len(a) - 1`).\n- If the current index is not the last one, it prints a comma and a space after the item.\n- This ensures that a comma is printed after each item except the last one, regardless of whether the item is equal to the last item in the list."
