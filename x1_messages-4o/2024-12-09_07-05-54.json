        "content": "Yes, in Python, it is guaranteed that `False` is equivalent to `0` and `True` is equivalent to `1`. This behavior is consistent across all versions of Python since the introduction of the `bool` type in Python 2.3, and it is documented in the official Python documentation.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Boolean Values as Integers**: In Python, the `bool` type is a subclass of `int`. This means that `True` and `False` can be used in arithmetic contexts as `1` and `0`, respectively. This is explicitly documented in the Python language reference. Therefore, you can rely on `0 == False` and `1 == True` evaluating to `True`.\n\n2. **Indexing with Boolean Values**: Since `False` and `True` are equivalent to `0` and `1`, you can use them as indices in lists. Therefore, the expression `['zero', 'one'][False]` will always return `'zero'` and `['zero', 'one'][True]` will always return `'one'`.\n\n3. **Official Documentation**: The behavior of `True` and `False` as `1` and `0` is confirmed in the official Python documentation. The documentation states that the `bool` type is a subclass of `int`, and therefore inherits its behavior, including arithmetic operations and indexing capabilities.\n\n4. **Future Compatibility**: While it's always good to be cautious about future changes, this behavior is fundamental to Python and is unlikely to change, as it would break a vast amount of existing code. The Python community values backward compatibility, especially for such core features.\n\nIn conclusion, you can confidently rely on this behavior across different Python versions, and it is unlikely to change in future versions."
