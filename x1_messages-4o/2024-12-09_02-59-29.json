I am trying to iterate through the section of the list that starts at the third element (index 2) until the end for each nested list. My code is as follows:\n\n```jinja\n{% for alpha in list %}\n    <div id=\"{{ loop.index }}\"> \n       <div class='sidebar-one'>\n          {% for beta in list[0][2:] %} #I want to iterate through list[0][2:] till list[n][2:]\n              <p> {{ beta[0][0] }} </p>\n          {% endfor %}\n       </div>\n    </div>\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\nI tried using range in the following way, but it threw an error:\n\n```jinja\n{% for n in range(1,n) %}\n{% for line in check[{{n}}][2:] %}\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\nThe error I received was:\n\n```\nTemplateSyntaxError: expected token ':', got '}'\n```"

        "content": "To iterate through a nested list in Jinja2 and access elements starting from a specific index, you need to adjust your logic to correctly use the loop index and slicing within the loop. Your current implementation has a couple of issues, mainly with accessing elements using the loop index and slicing syntax. Here's how you can achieve your goal:\n\n```jinja\n{% for alpha in list %}\n    <div id=\"{{ loop.index }}\"> \n       <div class='sidebar-one'>\n          {% for beta in alpha[2:] %}\n              <p> {{ beta[0][0] }} </p>\n          {% endfor %}\n       </div>\n    </div>\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Iteration over Nested List**: In the outer loop, you're iterating over `list`, and each `alpha` represents a nested list. Instead of using `list[0][2:]`, you should directly slice `alpha` to start from the third element.\n   \n2. **Correct Slicing**: Use `alpha[2:]` to iterate over elements of each nested list starting from index 2.\n   \n3. **Avoid Using Range**: You don't need to use `range` in this case because `Jinja2` can handle list slicing and direct iteration over elements within the template.\n\nWith these adjustments, your code should correctly iterate through each nested list starting from the third element."
