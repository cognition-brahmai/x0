According to the problem, this reversed number is 9 less than the original number:\n\n\\[ 10b + a = 10a + b - 9 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\( a + b = 13 \\)\n2. \\( 10b + a = 10a + b - 9 \\)\n\nLet's simplify the second equation:\n\n\\[ 10b + a = 10a + b - 9 \\]\n\nSubtract \\( b \\) and \\( a \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 9b = 9a - 9 \\]\n\nDivide everything by 9:\n\n\\[ b = a - 1 \\]\n\nNow substitute \\( b = a - 1 \\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[ a + (a - 1) = 13 \\]\n\n\\[ 2a - 1 = 13 \\]\n\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n\n\\[ 2a = 14 \\]\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n\\[ a = 7 \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( a = 7 \\) back into \\( b = a - 1 \\):\n\n\\[ b = 7 - 1 = 6 \\]\n\nThus, the original number is \\( 10a + b = 10(7) + 6 = 76 \\).\n\nSo, the original number is 76."
