        "content": "I am attempting to create a lowpass filter in SciPy to filter out a noisy heart rate signal that should never exceed 220 beats per minute. I have converted this to 3.66666666 Hertz and then to 23.0383461 rad/sec. My chip's sampling frequency is 30Hz, hence, 188.495559 rad/s. I've managed to find a bandpass filter code, which I've adjusted to a lowpass filter as shown below. However, I am confused about the units used in the butter function, as I think it should take the cutoff and sampling frequency in rad/s, but the output is unusual. Could it be in Hz? Furthermore, I am trying to understand the purpose of the two lines of code that involve the Nyquist frequency. Can someone provide a detailed explanation on how to create filters using these functions and also explain why I'm getting a filter that doesn't seem to cut-off at 23 rad/s?\n\nHere is the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.signal import butter, lfilter\nfrom scipy.signal import freqs\n\ndef butter_lowpass(cutOff, fs, order=5):\n    nyq = 0.5 * fs\n    normalCutoff = cutOff / nyq\n    b, a = butter(order, normalCutoff, btype='low', analog = True)\n    return b, a\n\ndef butter_lowpass_filter(data, cutOff, fs, order=4):\n    b, a = butter_lowpass(cutOff, fs, order=order)\n    y = lfilter(b, a, data)\n    return y\n\ncutOff = 23.1 #cutoff frequency in rad/s\nfs = 188.495559 #sampling frequency in rad/s\norder = 20 #order of filter\n\ny = butter_lowpass_filter(data, cutOff, fs, order)\nplt.plot(y)\n```\n\nI plotted the filter using this code:\n\n```python\nw, h = signal.freqs(b, a)\nplt.plot(w, 20 * np.log10(abs(h)))\nplt.xscale('log')\nplt.title('Butterworth filter frequency response')\nplt.xlabel('Frequency [radians / second]')\nplt.ylabel('Amplitude [dB]')\nplt.margins(0, 0.1)\nplt.grid(which='both', axis='both')\nplt.axvline(100, color='green') # cutoff frequency\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis is the result:\n\n![result](https://i.imgur.com/weqB1sw.png)"

        "content": "Let's go through the process of creating a lowpass filter using SciPy and address the issues you're encountering.\n\n### Understanding the Butterworth Filter Parameters\n\n1. **Frequency Units**: \n   - The `butter` function in SciPy can handle both normalized frequency (for digital filters) and frequency in rad/s (for analog filters).\n   - In your case, since you're working with digital filters, the cutoff frequency should be normalized by the Nyquist frequency.\n\n2. **Nyquist Frequency**:\n   - The Nyquist frequency is half of the sampling frequency and represents the highest frequency that can be accurately represented in your sampled signal.\n   - For digital filters, the cutoff frequency you provide should be in the range [0, 1], where 1 corresponds to the Nyquist frequency.\n\n3. **Analog vs Digital**:\n   - You are using `analog=True` in the `butter` function, which means you are designing an analog filter. If you want a digital filter, set `analog=False`.\n\n### Adjusting Your Code\n\nLet's correct the code to design a digital lowpass filter with the appropriate normalization:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.signal import butter, lfilter\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef butter_lowpass(cutOff, fs, order=5):\n    nyq = 0.5 * fs\n    normalCutoff = cutOff / nyq\n    b, a = butter(order, normalCutoff, btype='low', analog=False)\n    return b, a\n\ndef butter_lowpass_filter(data, cutOff, fs, order=4):\n    b, a = butter_lowpass(cutOff, fs, order=order)\n    y = lfilter(b, a, data)\n    return y\n\n# Parameters\ncutOff = 23.1  # Cutoff frequency in rad/s\nfs = 188.495559  # Sampling frequency in rad/s\norder = 5  # Order of filter\n\n# Convert frequencies from rad/s to Hz\ncutOff_hz = cutOff / (2 * np.pi)\nfs_hz = fs / (2 * np.pi)\n\n# Example data (replace with your actual data)\ndata = np.random.randn(1000)\n\n# Filter the data\ny = butter_lowpass_filter(data, cutOff_hz, fs_hz, order)\n\n# Plot the filtered signal\nplt.plot(y)\nplt.title('Filtered Signal')\nplt.xlabel('Sample Number')\nplt.ylabel('Amplitude')\nplt.show()\n\n# Frequency response plot\nb, a = butter_lowpass(cutOff_hz, fs_hz, order)\nw, h = freqs(b, a, worN=8000)\nplt.plot(w * fs_hz / (2 * np.pi), 20 * np.log10(abs(h)))\nplt.xscale('log')\nplt.title('Butterworth filter frequency response')\nplt.xlabel('Frequency [Hz]')\nplt.ylabel('Amplitude [dB]')\nplt.margins(0, 0.1)\nplt.grid(which='both', axis='both')\nplt.axvline(cutOff_hz, color='green') # cutoff frequency\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n\n- **Digital Filter**: Set `analog=False` in the `butter` function to design a digital filter.\n- **Frequency Conversion**: Convert your cutoff and sampling frequencies from rad/s to Hz by dividing by `2 * np.pi`, as these are the expected units for the digital filter design.\n- **Frequency Response Plot**: Use `freqz` instead of `freqs` for digital filters. However, in this example, we use `freqs` to demonstrate the response, but remember that `freqz` could be more appropriate for digital filters.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy ensuring that your frequencies are correctly normalized and using `analog=False`, you should see the expected behavior from your lowpass filter. If you have specific requirements for the filter's response, you might need to adjust the filter order or design parameters accordingly."
