However, when I open up my Terminal and type in 'python', it still shows Python 2.7.6, which is the default version that Apple ships with Yosemite. I installed Python 3 using the installer 'python-3.4.3-macosx10.6.pkg'. Could anyone help me understand where the Python 3.4.3 interpreter was installed? Additionally, do I need to uninstall Python 2.7.3 before setting a global environmental variable such as PYTHON_HOME to the location of the installed Python 3.4.3? If yes, could you guide me on how to do this?"

        "content": "When you install Python 3 on macOS, it doesn't replace the system Python (Python 2.7 in your case) which is located at `/usr/bin/python`. Instead, it installs alongside it. Here's how you can find and use Python 3.4.3:\n\n1. **Locate Python 3.4.3:**\n   - Open Terminal and type: \n     ```bash\n     which python3\n     ```\n   - This should return the path where Python 3 is installed, typically something like `/usr/local/bin/python3`.\n\n2. **Check the installed Python 3 version:**\n   - You can verify the version by typing:\n     ```bash\n     python3 --version\n     ```\n   - This should display Python 3.4.3.\n\n3. **Using Python 3:**\n   - Whenever you want to use Python 3, make sure to call `python3` instead of `python`.\n\n4. **Setting up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**\n   - It's a good idea to use virtual environments for your projects to manage dependencies separately. You can create a virtual environment using:\n     ```bash\n     python3 -m venv myenv\n     ```\n   - Activate it with:\n     ```bash\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     ```\n   - This will allow you to use Python 3 within the virtual environment without affecting the system Python.\n\n5. **No need to uninstall Python 2.7:**\n   - It's generally not recommended to uninstall the system version of Python (Python 2.7) on macOS, as some system utilities depend on it.\n\n6. **Setting PYTHON_HOME (optional):**\n   - If you want to set a global environmental variable for Python 3, you can add the following lines to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` (depending on your shell):\n     ```bash\n     export PYTHON_HOME=/usr/local/bin/python3\n     export PATH=$PYTHON_HOME:$PATH\n     ```\n   - After adding these lines, run `source ~/.bash_profile` or `source ~/.zshrc` to apply the changes.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to use Python 3 alongside Python 2 without any issues."
