        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that Django 2.0 and above require Python 3.4 or later. Since you're using Python 2.7.14, you won't be able to install Django 2.0.2. Python 2.7 does not support Django 2.x versions.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you have two main options:\n\n1. **Upgrade to Python 3:**\n   - Install a version of Python 3.4 or later on your system.\n   - Once Python 3 is installed, you can create a virtual environment using Python 3 and then install Django 2.0.2 within that environment.\n   - Example steps:\n     ```bash\n     python3 -m venv myenv\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     pip install Django==2.0.2\n     ```\n\n2. **Use an older version of Django:**\n   - If you need to stick with Python 2.7, you'll have to use an older version of Django that supports it. The latest version of Django that supports Python 2.7 is Django 1.11 LTS.\n   - You can install it using:\n     ```bash\n     pip install Django==1.11.29\n     ```\n\nFor the best long-term support and new features, I recommend upgrading to Python 3 and using the latest Django version compatible with it. Python 2.7 has reached its end of life, meaning it no longer receives updates or support."
