        "content": "Certainly! Here's a simple example of a loop in Python that counts up to 10 using a `for` loop:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    print(i)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `range(1, 11)` function generates numbers from 1 to 10, and the loop iterates over each of these numbers, printing them one by one.\n\nIf you prefer using a `while` loop, here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ncount = 1\nwhile count <= 10:\n    print(count)\n    count += 1\n```\n\nIn this `while` loop example, we start with `count` set to 1 and continue to loop while `count` is less than or equal to 10, printing the current value of `count` and then incrementing it by 1 in each iteration."
