My current code is:\n\n```python\ndf = df[df.index < '2013-10-16 08:00:00']\n```\n\nHowever, this is not producing the desired results and is not filtering out the times before 8 AM. Can you help me solve this issue?"

        "content": "Certainly! The issue with your code is that you're trying to filter the DataFrame for times before 8:00 AM using `df.index < '2013-10-16 08:00:00'`, which actually keeps all observations before 8:00 AM instead of removing them. To filter out observations before 8:00 AM, you should use a greater than or equal to condition. Additionally, ensure that your DataFrame's index is of a datetime type for proper comparison. Here's how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\n# Ensure the index is of datetime type\ndf.index = pd.to_datetime(df.index)\n\n# Filter the DataFrame to keep only observations at or after 8:00 AM\ndf = df[df.index >= '2013-10-16 08:00:00']\n```\n\nThis code will update the DataFrame to include only those observations that occur at or after 8:00 AM. Make sure the date '2013-10-16' matches the date in your DataFrame index, or adjust it accordingly if you're dealing with different dates."
