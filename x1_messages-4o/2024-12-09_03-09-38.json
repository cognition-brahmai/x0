In class `A`, I define an instance variable `self.name = 'A'` in the `__init__` method. When I inspect the `__dict__` member of an instance of `A`, it shows `{'name': 'A'}` which is expected. However, when I create a class `B` where I define a class variable `name = 'B'`, the `__dict__` member seems to be empty. What is the difference between these two scenarios and why doesn't `name` show up in `B`'s `__dict__`?\n\nHere is the code for reference:\n\nClass A:\n```python\nclass A:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.name = 'A'\n```\n\nClass B:\n```python\nclass B:\n    name = 'B'\n```"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to the difference between instance variables and class variables in Python.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening:\n\n1. **Class A**:\n   - In class `A`, `name` is an instance variable. This means that each instance of `A` will have its own `name` attribute.\n   - When you create an instance of `A` (e.g., `a_instance = A()`), the `__init__` method is called, and `self.name = 'A'` is executed. This adds an entry to the instance's `__dict__`, specifically `{'name': 'A'}`.\n   - `a_instance.__dict__` will show `{'name': 'A'}` because `name` is stored in the instance's dictionary.\n\n2. **Class B**:\n   - In class `B`, `name` is a class variable. Class variables are shared among all instances of the class and are defined at the class level, outside of any instance methods.\n   - When you create an instance of `B` (e.g., `b_instance = B()`), `b_instance` does not have its own `name` attribute in its `__dict__`. Instead, it inherits `name` from the class `B`.\n   - Since `name` is not an instance variable, `b_instance.__dict__` will be empty (`{}`) by default unless you add instance-specific attributes to `b_instance`.\n\nTo access the class variable `name`, you can do:\n```python\nprint(B.name)  # Output: 'B'\nprint(b_instance.name)  # Output: 'B', inherited from the class\n```\n\nIf you want `name` to show up in the instance's `__dict__`, you would need to assign it within an instance method like `__init__`, similar to how you did in class `A`:\n\n```python\nclass B:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.name = 'B'\n```\n\nNow, if you create an instance of `B` and check its `__dict__`, it will contain `{'name': 'B'}`."
