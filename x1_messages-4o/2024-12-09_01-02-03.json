I have been trying to improve my time series prediction problem with ANN and LSTM, adjusting various parameters, but only managed to get 8% better than the persistence prediction. Are there any pre-trained models in Keras or any other platform that I can use? \n\nAdditionally, I would like to know if it's possible to continue training a model with a new dataset that I will have access to in a month. This is not the same as training it in batches where you have all the data at once. Is this feasible and if so, how can I do it?"

        "content": "Yes, there are several pre-trained models and frameworks that you can use for time series prediction, especially when working with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Here are a few options and approaches you might consider:\n\n1. **Pre-trained Models:**\n   - While there aren't many widely-available pre-trained LSTM models specifically for time series prediction, you can explore libraries like **TensorFlow Hub** or **Hugging Face's Transformers** for models that might be adaptable for your needs.\n   - You can also look into general-purpose frameworks like **Prophet** by Facebook or **GluonTS** by Amazon, which are specifically designed for time series forecasting.\n\n2. **Transfer Learning:**\n   - You can use transfer learning by taking an existing model trained on a similar time series dataset and fine-tuning it on your data. This approach is more common in domains like computer vision and NLP but can be adapted for time series forecasting with careful consideration.\n\n3. **Model Repositories:**\n   - Platforms like **Keras Applications** or **Model Zoo** might have models that can be adapted for time series tasks, although they are more focused on image and NLP models.\n\n4. **Continuing Model Training:**\n   - Yes, it is possible to continue training a model with new data as it becomes available, a process often referred to as **incremental learning** or **online learning**.\n   - In Keras, you can achieve this by using the `fit()` method to continue training on new data. Make sure to save your model's weights and optimizer state after initial training so you can resume training seamlessly when new data arrives.\n   - Use the `model.save()` method to save your model, and `load_model()` to load it back for further training.\n   - When new data arrives, simply load your model and call `model.fit()` with the new dataset.\n\n5. **Considerations:**\n   - Make sure the new data is pre-processed in the same way as the initial data to maintain consistency.\n   - Be aware of potential issues with concept drift, where the statistical properties of the target variable change over time.\n\nBy leveraging these resources and techniques, you should be able to improve your time series prediction and adapt your model as new data becomes available."
