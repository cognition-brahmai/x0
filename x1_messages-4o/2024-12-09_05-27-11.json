The CSV does not contain any special characters except German ones and its size is 10MB. Here's the code I used:\n\n```python\ndf = pd.read_csv(r'path to file', sep=';')\n```\n\nAnd here is the error message:\n\n```python\nOSError                                   Traceback (most recent call\nlast)  in ()\n----> 1 df = pd.read_csv(r'path\n\u00dcbersicht\\Input\\test\\test.csv', sep=';')\nc:\\program files\\python36\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\io\\parsers.py in\nparser_f(filepath_or_buffer, sep, delimiter, header, names, index_col,\nusecols, squeeze, prefix, mangle_dupe_cols, dtype, engine, converters,\ntrue_values, false_values, skipinitialspace, skiprows, nrows,\nna_values, keep_default_na, na_filter, verbose, skip_blank_lines,\nparse_dates, infer_datetime_format, keep_date_col, date_parser,\ndayfirst, iterator, chunksize, compression, thousands, decimal,\nlineterminator, quotechar, quoting, escapechar, comment, encoding,\ndialect, tupleize_cols, error_bad_lines, warn_bad_lines, skipfooter,\nskip_footer, doublequote, delim_whitespace, as_recarray, compact_ints,\nuse_unsigned, low_memory, buffer_lines, memory_map, float_precision)\n```\n\nI tried another approach using the Python's built-in csv library:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nfile = csv.reader(open(r'pathtofile')) \n\nfor row in file:\n    print(row)\n    break\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(file, sep=';')\n```\n\nIt loads the file and prints the first line, but then I get a `ValueError: Invalid file path or buffer object type`. How can I resolve these issues and successfully load my CSV file using pandas?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering when trying to load a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame can be addressed in a few steps. Let's go through some potential solutions:\n\n1. **File Path**: Make sure the file path is correct and properly formatted. It looks like there might be an issue with the path in your example. Ensure that you're using the correct path and that it doesn't contain any special characters that might cause issues.\n\n2. **Encoding**: Since your CSV file contains German characters, there might be an encoding issue. Try specifying the encoding explicitly when reading the file:\n\n   ```python\n   df = pd.read_csv(r'path_to_file', sep=';', encoding='utf-8')\n   ```\n\n   If `utf-8` doesn't work, you might try other encodings like `latin1` or `ISO-8859-1`.\n\n3. **File Handling**: The second approach you tried using the `csv` module and then passing the file object to `pd.read_csv()` won't work because `pd.read_csv()` expects a file path or a file-like object, not a CSV reader object. Instead, use the correct file path directly with `pd.read_csv()`.\n\n4. **File Corruption**: Ensure that the CSV file is not corrupted. You can try opening it in a text editor or spreadsheet application to verify its contents.\n\n5. **Memory Issues**: If your system is running low on memory, it might cause issues with reading large files. Consider using the `chunksize` parameter to read the file in smaller chunks:\n\n   ```python\n   chunksize = 10000  # or any other size that fits your memory constraints\n   chunks = pd.read_csv(r'path_to_file', sep=';', encoding='utf-8', chunksize=chunksize)\n   df = pd.concat(chunks, ignore_index=True)\n   ```\n\n6. **Path String**: Make sure that your path string is correctly formatted. You can use raw strings (prefix the string with `r`) or escape backslashes properly.\n\nHere's a revised example with these considerations:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Correctly formatted path and specified encoding\ndf = pd.read_csv(r'path_to_file', sep=';', encoding='utf-8')\n\n# Optionally, if you encounter memory issues, use chunksize\n# chunksize = 10000\n# chunks = pd.read_csv(r'path_to_file', sep=';', encoding='utf-8', chunksize=chunksize)\n# df = pd.concat(chunks, ignore_index=True)\n\nprint(df.head())\n```\n\nBy addressing these potential issues, you should be able to load your CSV file successfully into a pandas DataFrame."
