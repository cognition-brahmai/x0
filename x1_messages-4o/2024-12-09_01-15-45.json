I have noticed the Python-Cloudfiles library has an object.stream() call which seems suitable for my requirements. However, I am unable to find an equivalent call in boto. Is it possible to perform an operation similar to \"shutil.copyfileobj(s3Object.stream(),rsObject.stream())\" using boto or any other S3 library?"

        "content": "To copy a file from Amazon S3 to Rackspace Cloudfiles without writing it to disk, you can indeed use the streaming capabilities provided by both libraries. Here's a way to achieve this using the `boto3` library for S3 and the `pyrax` library for Rackspace Cloudfiles.\n\nFirst, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:\n\n```bash\npip install boto3\npip install pyrax\n```\n\nHere is a sample code to perform the operation:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\nimport pyrax\nfrom io import BytesIO\n\n# Initialize boto3 S3 client\ns3_client = boto3.client('s3', aws_access_key_id='YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY',\n                         aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY',\n                         region_name='YOUR_AWS_REGION')\n\n# Initialize pyrax for Rackspace Cloudfiles\npyrax.set_setting(\"identity_type\", \"rackspace\")\npyrax.set_credentials(\"YOUR_RACKSPACE_USERNAME\", \"YOUR_RACKSPACE_API_KEY\")\ncf = pyrax.cloudfiles\n\ndef copy_s3_to_rackspace(s3_bucket_name, s3_key, rackspace_container, rackspace_object_name):\n    # Get the object from S3\n    s3_response = s3_client.get_object(Bucket=s3_bucket_name, Key=s3_key)\n    \n    # Use BytesIO to stream the object in memory\n    s3_object_stream = BytesIO(s3_response['Body'].read())\n    \n    # Upload the object to Rackspace Cloudfiles\n    cf.store_object(rackspace_container, obj_name=rackspace_object_name, data=s3_object_stream)\n\n# Example usage\ncopy_s3_to_rackspace('my-s3-bucket', 'path/to/my-file.txt', 'my-rackspace-container', 'my-file.txt')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Boto3 S3 Client**: This is initialized to interact with Amazon S3, which lets you retrieve the object using `get_object`. The response contains a 'Body' element which is a streamable object.\n\n2. **BytesIO**: This is used to keep the file in memory without writing it to disk. You read the S3 object's body and put it into a `BytesIO` stream.\n\n3. **Pyrax Cloud Files**: This is used to interact with Rackspace Cloudfiles. You authenticate using your Rackspace credentials and use the `store_object` method to upload the file from the `BytesIO` stream to your Rackspace container.\n\nMake sure to replace placeholders like `'YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY'`, `'YOUR_RACKSPACE_USERNAME'`, etc., with your actual credentials. This approach ensures that the file is streamed directly between S3 and Rackspace Cloudfiles without needing intermediate storage on disk."
