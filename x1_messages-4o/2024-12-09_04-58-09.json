I am trying to call the base class's classmethod from the derived class. Normally, I would use 'super' or even the base class name directly if this is a normal object method, but I can't find a way to call the classmethod in the base class. When I run the code, 'Base.do(a)' prints 'Base' class instead of 'Derived' class. How can I call 'Base.do' from 'Derived.do'?\n\n<pre><code>class Base(object):\n\n    @classmethod\n    def do(cls, a):\n        print cls, a\n\nclass Derived(Base):\n\n    @classmethod\n    def do(cls, a):\n        print 'In derived!'\n        # Base.do(cls, a) -- can't pass `cls`\n        Base.do(a)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    d = Derived()\n    d.do('hello')\n</code></pre>"

        "content": "In your current setup, when you call `Base.do(a)`, it uses the `Base` class's method, but it doesn't pass `cls` as the `Derived` class. To achieve your goal of calling `Base.do` from within `Derived.do` while still using `Derived` as the class (`cls`), you can directly pass `cls` when calling `Base.do`.\n\nHere's how you can modify the `Derived` class to achieve this:\n\n```python\nclass Base(object):\n\n    @classmethod\n    def do(cls, a):\n        print(cls, a)\n\nclass Derived(Base):\n\n    @classmethod\n    def do(cls, a):\n        print('In derived!')\n        # Pass cls explicitly to Base.do\n        Base.do(cls, a)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    d = Derived()\n    d.do('hello')\n```\n\nBy explicitly passing `cls` to `Base.do`, you ensure that the `Derived` class is used in the method call. This way, when you run the code, it will print the following:\n\n```\nIn derived!\n<class '__main__.Derived'> hello\n```\n\nThis output shows that `Base.do` is being called from `Derived.do` with the `Derived` class as the context."
