Despite following instructions from the PyTorch website and using pip3 to install torch and torchvision, an error (Command \"python setup.py egg_info\" failed with error code 1) occurs. I also attempted to use conda to install pytorch and cuda80 but received a conflict message. I have also tried to install a downloaded tar.bz2 file of PyTorch but received a 404 client error. I even tried `conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch` and `conda install -c derickl torchvision` but both resulted in missing packages errors. I have checked that `setuptools` is up to date. Can anyone assist in successfully installing PyTorch?"

        "content": "Installing PyTorch in Anaconda for Python 3.5 can sometimes be tricky, especially if you're encountering version conflicts or errors. Here are some steps and considerations that might help you resolve these issues:\n\n1. **Check Python Version Compatibility**: PyTorch may not support Python 3.5 for the latest versions. If possible, consider upgrading to Python 3.6 or later, as newer versions of PyTorch are more likely to support them.\n\n2. **Create a New Conda Environment**: Sometimes, starting with a fresh environment can help resolve package conflicts. You can create a new environment with a compatible Python version:\n\n    ```bash\n    conda create -n pytorch_env python=3.6\n    conda activate pytorch_env\n    ```\n\n3. **Install PyTorch Using Conda**: Use the official PyTorch channel to install PyTorch and its dependencies. Make sure you're using the correct command based on your CUDA version:\n\n    - For CPU-only version:\n      ```bash\n      conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch\n      ```\n\n    - For CUDA versions, replace `cpuonly` with `cudatoolkit=10.2` or another version depending on your setup:\n      ```bash\n      conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch\n      ```\n\n4. **Resolve Any Conflicts**: If you encounter conflicts, carefully read the error message to identify which packages are causing the issue. You may need to adjust versions or remove certain packages.\n\n5. **Download and Install Specific Versions**: If conflicts persist, you can try specifying exact versions of PyTorch and associated libraries:\n\n    ```bash\n    conda install pytorch==1.7.1 torchvision==0.8.2 torchaudio==0.7.2 cpuonly -c pytorch\n    ```\n\n6. **Check Internet Connection and Channels**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection and that your conda channels are set up correctly. You can check your conda configuration with:\n\n    ```bash\n    conda config --show\n    ```\n\n7. **Alternative Installation with Pip**: If conda continues to fail, you might try using pip within your conda environment:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install torch==1.7.1+cpu torchvision==0.8.2+cpu torchaudio==0.7.2 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html\n    ```\n\nRemember to activate your conda environment before trying these commands. If you still face issues, consider checking the PyTorch GitHub issues page or forums for similar problems and solutions."
