        "content": "Certainly! I can help you design a C++ program that sorts an array of words in alphabetical order. Below is a simple example of how you can achieve this using the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <string>\n#include <algorithm>\n\n// Function to display the vector of words\nvoid displayWords(const std::vector<std::string>& words) {\n    for (const auto& word : words) {\n        std::cout << word << \" \";\n    }\n    std::cout << std::endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Array of words to be sorted\n    std::vector<std::string> words = {\"banana\", \"apple\", \"orange\", \"grape\", \"kiwi\"};\n\n    std::cout << \"Original order: \";\n    displayWords(words);\n\n    // Sort the words in alphabetical order\n    std::sort(words.begin(), words.end());\n\n    std::cout << \"Sorted order: \";\n    displayWords(words);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### How It Works:\n1. **Include Necessary Headers**: We include headers like `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<string>`, and `<algorithm>` to make use of the necessary functionalities such as input/output, dynamic arrays, string handling, and sorting.\n\n2. **Display Function**: We define a `displayWords` function to print the words in the vector.\n\n3. **Main Function**:\n   - We start by creating a vector of strings called `words` containing the words you want to sort.\n   - We display the original order of words using the `displayWords` function.\n   - We use the `std::sort` function from the `<algorithm>` library to sort the words. This function takes two iterators: the beginning and the end of the container you want to sort.\n   - Finally, we display the sorted order of words.\n\nYou can modify the `words` vector to include any list of words you want to sort. This program will sort them in alphabetical order. Let me know if you have any questions or need further modifications!"
