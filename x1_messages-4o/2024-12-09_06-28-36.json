        "content": "Certainly! In Python, the `list.index(x)` method raises a `ValueError` if the item `x` is not found in the list. If you want to find the index of an item without raising an exception when the item is not present, you can use a helper function to achieve that. Here's a way to do it:\n\n```python\ndef safe_index(lst, x):\n    try:\n        return lst.index(x)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]\nitem_to_find = 25\n\nindex = safe_index(my_list, item_to_find)\nif index != -1:\n    print(f\"Item found at index: {index}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Item not found.\")\n```\n\nHowever, if you prefer not to use exception handling at all, you can use a conditional expression with the `in` operator:\n\n```python\ndef safe_index(lst, x):\n    return lst.index(x) if x in lst else -1\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]\nitem_to_find = 25\n\nindex = safe_index(my_list, item_to_find)\nif index != -1:\n    print(f\"Item found at index: {index}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Item not found.\")\n```\n\nThis function checks if the item `x` is in the list `lst` before attempting to find its index, thus avoiding exceptions entirely. If the item is not found, it returns `-1`, but you can customize the return value to suit your needs."
