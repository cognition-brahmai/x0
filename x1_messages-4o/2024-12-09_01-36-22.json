        "content": "The `wave` module in Python is designed to work with WAV files, not MP3 files. To play MP3 files, you can use libraries such as `pygame`, `pydub` with `simpleaudio`, or `playsound`. Here are examples using these libraries:\n\n### Using `pygame`\nFirst, you need to install the `pygame` library if you haven't already. You can do this via pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pygame\n```\n\nThen, you can use the following code to play an MP3 file:\n\n```python\nimport pygame\n\n# Initialize Pygame mixer\npygame.mixer.init()\n\n# Load the MP3 file\npygame.mixer.music.load(\"e:/LOCAL/Betrayer/Metalik Klinik1-Anak Sekolah.mp3\")\n\n# Play the MP3 file\npygame.mixer.music.play()\n\n# Keep the program running while the music is playing\nwhile pygame.mixer.music.get_busy():\n    pygame.time.Clock().tick(10)\n```\n\n### Using `pydub` with `simpleaudio`\nFirst, you need to install the necessary libraries:\n\n```bash\npip install pydub simpleaudio\n```\n\nThen, use the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom pydub import AudioSegment\nimport simpleaudio as sa\n\n# Load your MP3 file\nsong = AudioSegment.from_mp3(\"e:/LOCAL/Betrayer/Metalik Klinik1-Anak Sekolah.mp3\")\n\n# Play the song\nplay_obj = sa.play_buffer(song.raw_data, num_channels=song.channels, bytes_per_sample=song.sample_width, sample_rate=song.frame_rate)\n\n# Wait for playback to finish before exiting\nplay_obj.wait_done()\n```\n\n### Using `playsound`\nThis is the simplest method if you just want to play an MP3 file without any additional functionality:\n\n```bash\npip install playsound\n```\n\nThen use:\n\n```python\nfrom playsound import playsound\n\n# Play the MP3 file\nplaysound(\"e:/LOCAL/Betrayer/Metalik Klinik1-Anak Sekolah.mp3\")\n```\n\nChoose the method that best suits your needs. Each method has its own advantages, such as simplicity (`playsound`) or control over playback (`pygame`, `pydub`)."
