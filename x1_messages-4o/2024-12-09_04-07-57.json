Whenever my computer receives the SYN-ACK from the server, it generates an RST packet which stops the connection process. This happens on both OS X Lion and Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat, as they both reset the connection. I found this link (http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/net/0404.2/0021.html) but I am not sure if it explains the reason. Can anyone tell me why this is happening and how I can avoid it?"

        "content": "When you're crafting your own TCP packets, particularly for the three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK), there are a few reasons why your system might generate an RST packet in response to a SYN-ACK:\n\n1. **Mismatch in Expected Sequence Numbers**: Your operating system's TCP stack might not recognize the SYN-ACK as part of an initiated connection, particularly if the sequence numbers don't match the expected range. This can happen if your manually crafted SYN packet does not have the correct sequence number, or if there are discrepancies in the TCP options.\n\n2. **Source IP Address**: If the source IP address or port in your crafted SYN packet does not match any expected connection on your machine (i.e., it doesn't have an entry in the TCP connection table), the OS might send an RST packet because it doesn't see this as part of an existing or pending connection.\n\n3. **Firewall or Security Software**: Some firewalls or security software can detect and block unusual or malformed packets, resulting in an RST being sent to close what is perceived as an invalid or potentially harmful connection.\n\n4. **Operating System Behavior**: Some operating systems are configured to actively reset unknown or suspicious incoming connections to protect against spoofing or other network attacks.\n\nTo address the issue, consider the following steps:\n\n- **Check Sequence Numbers**: Ensure that your SYN packet has the correct initial sequence number and that you handle the sequence numbers correctly in your subsequent ACK packet.\n\n- **Use Raw Sockets with Care**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions and are using raw sockets correctly, as improper use can lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n- **Disable RST on Interface**: Temporarily disable sending of RST packets on the interface you are testing (if possible and safe) to verify if your crafted packets are otherwise correct. Note that this is usually not recommended on production systems due to security risks.\n\n- **Network Namespace or VM**: Consider running your experiments in a controlled environment, such as a network namespace or a virtual machine, to prevent interference with your main system's networking stack.\n\n- **Consult RFCs and Documentation**: Review relevant RFCs (e.g., RFC 793 for TCP) and documentation to ensure your packet structure is correct.\n\n- **Analyze with Tools**: Use packet analysis tools like Wireshark to verify the contents and flow of your packets to ensure they conform to expected TCP behavior.\n\nBy ensuring your packets are crafted correctly and match the expected format, you can minimize the chances of your operating system responding with an RST packet."
