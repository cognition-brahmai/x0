However, iPython interprets anything between dollar signs as a MathJax expression, which is not what I want. When I try to escape the dollar signs using a backslash, it prevents MathJax from working but the backslash is visible in the compiled Markdown. How can I successfully escape the dollar signs without the backslash being visible in the compiled Markdown?"

This will prevent MathJax from interpreting them, and the backslashes won't be visible in the compiled Markdown.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```markdown\n\\\\$\\\\$\\\\$\\\\$\n```\n\nEach dollar sign is preceded by two backslashes. This way, the dollar signs will be displayed correctly in the Markdown output without showing any backslashes or triggering MathJax rendering. \n\nAlternatively, you can use code blocks to display text literally, which also prevents any special interpretation by Markdown or MathJax:\n\n```markdown\n```\n$$$$\n```\n```\n\nThis approach uses triple backticks to create a code block, and anything inside will be shown as-is, with no special formatting or interpretation."
