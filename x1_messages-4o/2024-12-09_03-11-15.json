        "content": "The error you're encountering, specifically the `'\\r': command not found`, is typically indicative of a file format issue. Windows text files often use `\\r\\n` (carriage return and line feed) for new lines, whereas Unix-based systems like Cygwin expect just `\\n` (line feed). This discrepancy can lead to problems when shell scripts are executed in a Unix-like environment.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Convert Line Endings:**\n   You need to convert your `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile` files to Unix line endings. You can use a tool like `dos2unix` which is available in Cygwin. First, make sure it's installed:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-cyg install dos2unix\n   ```\n\n   Then, convert the files:\n\n   ```bash\n   dos2unix ~/.bashrc\n   dos2unix ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n\n2. **Check File Encoding:**\n   Ensure that your files are encoded properly. They should be in UTF-8 without BOM (Byte Order Mark). You can use a text editor like Notepad++ to change the encoding:\n   - Open the file in Notepad++.\n   - Go to the `Encoding` menu and select `Convert to UTF-8 (without BOM)` if it's not already set.\n\n3. **Review Environment Variables:**\n   Check how you are setting `JAVA_HOME`. You should not append to `JAVA_HOME`; it should be set directly. Modify your `.bashrc` file as follows:\n\n   ```bash\n   export JAVA_HOME=\"/cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/Java/jdk1.7.0_05\"\n   export PATH=\"$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH\"\n   ```\n\n   Make sure the path to your JDK is correct. It should point to the directory where your JDK is installed.\n\n4. **Reload Configuration:**\n   After making the changes, reload your configuration files to apply the changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the errors and set your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable correctly."
