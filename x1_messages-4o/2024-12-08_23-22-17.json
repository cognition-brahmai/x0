The book should offer a nuanced perspective on the complexities of family relationships, including but not limited to the dynamics between parents and children, siblings, and extended family members. It should also take into account factors such as cultural, societal, and personal contexts that shape such relationships.\nAs a reference, here's a C++ code that can help you extract data from a file and analyze it:\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <string>\n#include <vector>\nusing namespace std;\nstruct FamilyMember {\n    string name;\n    string relation;\n    int age;\n};\nint main() {\n    ifstream inFile;\n    inFile.open(\"family_data.txt\");\n    if (!inFile) {\n        cerr << \"Unable to open file datafile.txt\";\n        exit(1);\n    }\n    vector<FamilyMember> familyMembers;\n    string line;\n    while (getline(inFile, line)) {\n        string name, relation;\n        int age;\n        // extract data from line and store it in variables\n        // ...\n        familyMembers.push_back({name, relation, age});\n    }\n    // perform analysis on the data\n    // ...\n    inFile.close();\n    return 0;\n}"
