Assuming your data is organized in columns A, B, and C as follows:\n\n```\n   A       B         C\n1  Item    Quantity  Price\n2  Apple   3         2.6\n3  Banana  5         1.8\n4  Pears   2         3.9\n```\n\nYou can use the following formula in a cell (for example, D5) to calculate the total cost:\n\n```excel\n=SUM(B2*C2, B3*C3, B4*C4)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use this formula if you want a more dynamic approach, especially if your list of items is long:\n\n```excel\n=SUMPRODUCT(B2:B4, C2:C4)\n```\n\nThis formula multiplies each pair of Quantity and Price, and then sums the results. Adjust the cell ranges if your data is in different rows or if you have more items in the list."
