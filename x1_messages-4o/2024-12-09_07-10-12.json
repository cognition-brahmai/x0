The list I have is `l = [1,2,3,4,5,6]`. I want to get two elements per iteration so that I can print the sum of each pair of consecutive numbers.

        "content": "To achieve this, you can use a `for` loop with a step size of 2 to iterate over pairs of elements in the list. Here's how you can modify the loop or use list comprehension to print the sum of each pair of consecutive numbers:\n\n### Using a For Loop\n\n```python\nl = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nfor i in range(0, len(l), 2):\n    pair_sum = l[i] + l[i+1]\n    print(f\"{l[i]}+{l[i+1]}={pair_sum}\")\n```\n\n### Using List Comprehension\n\nWhile list comprehension is not typically used for printing, you can use it to create a list of formatted strings and then print them:\n\n```python\nl = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\noutput = [f\"{l[i]}+{l[i+1]}={l[i]+l[i+1]}\" for i in range(0, len(l), 2)]\nfor line in output:\n    print(line)\n```\n\nBoth methods will produce the desired output:\n\n```\n1+2=3\n3+4=7\n5+6=11\n```"
