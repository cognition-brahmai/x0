However, it seems that seaborn.tsplot does not currently allow direct control of legend placement based on lines 339-340 in seaborn's timeseries.py:\n\n```python\n    if legend:\n        ax.legend(loc=0, title=legend_name)\n```\nIs there a workaround using matplotlib? I am currently using seaborn version 0.6-dev."

        "content": "Certainly! While `seaborn.tsplot` doesn't directly allow for custom legend placement, you can leverage Matplotlib's functionality to adjust the legend position. After creating your plot with `seaborn.tsplot`, you can use Matplotlib's `legend` method to modify the legend's location.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Create your plot using `seaborn.tsplot`.\n2. Retrieve the current axis using Matplotlib.\n3. Adjust the legend's position using Matplotlib's `legend` method.\n\nHere's a code example demonstrating how to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample data\ndata = sns.load_dataset(\"flights\")\n\n# Create a time series plot\nsns.tsplot(time=\"year\", value=\"passengers\", unit=\"month\", condition=\"month\", data=data)\n\n# Retrieve the current axis\nax = plt.gca()\n\n# Move the legend outside the plot\n# Set bbox_to_anchor to move the legend box outside the plot area\n# Set loc to 'upper left' to anchor the legend to the upper left corner of the bounding box\nax.legend(loc='upper left', bbox_to_anchor=(1, 1), title=\"Month\")\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `plt.gca()` retrieves the current axis, allowing you to access the Matplotlib axis object.\n- `ax.legend()` is used to customize the legend. The `loc` parameter defines the location of the legend's anchor point, and `bbox_to_anchor` is used to position the legend outside the plot. `(1, 1)` will place it to the right of the plot.\n\nAdjust the `bbox_to_anchor` values to customize the legend's exact position as needed. This approach gives you flexibility with legend placement while using Seaborn for plotting."
