Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nFIFO = '/var/run/mypipe'\nos.mkfifo(FIFO)\nwith open(FIFO) as fifo:\n    while True:\n        line = fifo.read()\n```\n\nWould introducing 'sleep' help in this situation or would it cause the process to lose some input data from the pipe? I am unable to control the input and I'm unsure about the frequency of data input. I have researched about 'select' and 'poll' but I couldn't find any examples that directly address my issue. I am also curious about whether the 100% usage would have any impact on the data input, like data loss. I want the process to run continuously and 'listen' for data from the pipe, I do not want to break the loop."

        "content": "To address the issue of high CPU usage when reading from a named pipe in Python, introducing a sleep statement in your loop could reduce CPU usage, but it might not be the best approach, especially if you want to ensure you don't miss any data being written to the pipe. Instead, using `select` or `poll` is a more efficient method to handle this situation. These methods allow your program to wait for input to be available before attempting to read, reducing CPU usage significantly.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code using `select`:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport select\n\nFIFO = '/var/run/mypipe'\nos.mkfifo(FIFO)\n\nwith open(FIFO) as fifo:\n    while True:\n        # Use select to wait for data to be available\n        rlist, _, _ = select.select([fifo], [], [])\n        \n        # Read data once it's available\n        line = fifo.read()\n        if line:\n            print(line)  # or process the line as needed\n```\n\n### How `select` works:\n- `select.select(rlist, wlist, xlist[, timeout])`: `rlist` is a list of objects to be checked for incoming data. `wlist` and `xlist` are used for write and exceptional conditions, respectively, but you don't need them here.\n- The function will block until there's data to read, reducing CPU usage to almost zero when idle.\n\n### Impact on Data:\n- Using `select` won't cause data loss as it waits for the data to be available before reading.\n- If there's no data, it will simply wait, not consuming CPU unnecessarily.\n\n### Alternative - Using `poll`:\nIf you prefer, you can also use `poll` which is quite similar:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport select\n\nFIFO = '/var/run/mypipe'\nos.mkfifo(FIFO)\n\nwith open(FIFO) as fifo:\n    poller = select.poll()\n    poller.register(fifo, select.POLLIN)\n\n    while True:\n        events = poller.poll()\n        for fd, flag in events:\n            if flag & select.POLLIN:\n                line = fifo.read()\n                if line:\n                    print(line)  # or process the line as needed\n```\n\nBoth `select` and `poll` are efficient ways to handle I/O multiplexing and will help you avoid the high CPU usage problem while ensuring no data is lost."
