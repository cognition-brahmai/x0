On Linux, using the curl command, everything works fine. But when I try to write a script for Windows in Python 2.7.10 with Requests 2.8.1, I encounter an error 'requests.exceptions.SSLError: EOF occurred in violation of protocol'. The code I am using is:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nrequests.get('https://host/meters/a_serial/power', auth=('user', 'password'))\n```\n\nThis results in the following error:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:/Users/mzilio/PycharmProjects/pwrgtw/test.py\", line 20, in <module>\n    requests.get('https://host/meters/a_serial/power', auth=('user', 'password'))\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\requests\\api.py\", line 69, in get\n    return request('get', url, params=params, **kwargs)\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\requests\\api.py\", line 50, in request\n    response = session.request(method=method, url=url, **kwargs)\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\requests\\sessions.py\", line 468, in request\n    resp = self.send(prep, **send_kwargs)\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\requests\\sessions.py\", line 576, in send\n    r = adapter.send(request, **kwargs)\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\requests\\adapters.py\", line 433, in send\n    raise SSLError(e, request=request)\nrequests.exceptions.SSLError: EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:590)\n```\n\nI've tried to fix it with the following code:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter\nfrom requests.packages.urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager\nimport ssl\n\nclass MyAdapter(HTTPAdapter):\n    def init_poolmanager(self, connections, maxsize, block=False):\n        self.poolmanager = PoolManager(num_pools=connections,\n                                       maxsize=maxsize,\n                                       block=block,\n                                       ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1)\n\ns = requests.Session()\ns.mount('https://', MyAdapter())\ns.get('https://host/meters/a_serial/power')\n```\n\nBut it still doesn't work and I get the same error. Can someone help me solve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! The error you're encountering, `SSLError: EOF occurred in violation of protocol`, typically arises from SSL/TLS protocol mismatches between the client and server or due to certificate issues. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this:\n\n1. **Update Python and Requests**: \n   - Python 2.7.10 and Requests 2.8.1 are quite old. Consider upgrading to a more recent version of Python (preferably Python 3) and the latest version of the Requests library. This is important as newer versions support more recent SSL/TLS protocols.\n\n2. **Specify TLS Version**:\n   - The server may require a specific version of TLS. Your custom adapter is already attempting to use `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1`, but older versions might not support newer protocols. Try specifying `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2` if possible.\n\n3. **Verify SSL Certificate**:\n   - If you're working in a development environment and trust the server, you can disable SSL verification to see if the issue is related to the certificate. This is not recommended for production, but you can try:\n     ```python\n     s.get('https://host/meters/a_serial/power', verify=False)\n     ```\n   - If this works, you might need to add the server's certificate to your trusted CA store.\n\n4. **Check Server Configuration**:\n   - Ensure that the server is properly configured to support the TLS/SSL protocols you are trying to use.\n\n5. **Use a Compatible SSL Library**:\n   - Ensure that your Python environment uses a version of OpenSSL that supports the required protocols.\n\nHere's an example code snippet implementing some of these suggestions:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter\nfrom requests.packages.urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager\nimport ssl\n\nclass MyAdapter(HTTPAdapter):\n    def init_poolmanager(self, connections, maxsize, block=False):\n        self.poolmanager = PoolManager(num_pools=connections,\n                                       maxsize=maxsize,\n                                       block=block,\n                                       ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2)  # Try using TLSv1_2\n\ns = requests.Session()\ns.mount('https://', MyAdapter())\n\ntry:\n    response = s.get('https://host/meters/a_serial/power', auth=('user', 'password'), verify=False)  # Temporarily disable SSL verification\n    print(response.content)\nexcept requests.exceptions.SSLError as e:\n    print(f\"SSL error: {e}\")\n```\n\nRemember to revert the `verify=False` change once you identify the root cause and have a secure connection. Also, migrating to Python 3 is highly recommended for better support and security."
