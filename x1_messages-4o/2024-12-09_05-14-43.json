        "content": "The error message you are encountering, \"Coverage not available: unable to import coverage module,\" suggests that the `coverage` module is not installed or not accessible in your current Python environment. To resolve this issue, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install the Coverage Module:**\n   Ensure that the `coverage` module is installed in the environment where you are running `nosetests`. You can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install coverage\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Installation:**\n   After installing, verify that the `coverage` module is accessible. You can do this by starting a Python shell and trying to import the module:\n\n   ```python\n   import coverage\n   ```\n\n   If you don't encounter any errors, the module is installed correctly.\n\n3. **Check Python Environment:**\n   Make sure that you are using the correct Python environment where `coverage` is installed. If you are using virtual environments, activate the appropriate one before running `nosetests`.\n\n   ```bash\n   # If using virtualenv\n   source path/to/your/venv/bin/activate\n\n   # If using conda\n   conda activate your-env-name\n   ```\n\n4. **Re-run Nosetests:**\n   Once you have confirmed that the `coverage` module is installed and accessible, try running your tests again:\n\n   ```bash\n   nosetests -v --with-coverage\n   ```\n\n5. **Environment Path Issues:**\n   If the problem persists, check your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to ensure it includes the paths where your packages are installed. Sometimes, conflicts in environment paths can cause import errors.\n\n6. **Alternative Solution:**\n   If the error still occurs, consider using another tool for test coverage, such as `pytest` with the `pytest-cov` plugin, which is more modern and actively maintained.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with code coverage in Nose. Let me know if you need any more help!"
