I need to swap these values, i.e., if the value is 1 I need to change it to 0 and vice versa. I am currently using an if-else statement to do this but it seems too long. I have also tried creating a swap dictionary to map the values and it works. Is there a more Pythonic way to do this?\n\nHere is my current code:\n\n```python\nif val == 1:\n    val = 0\nelif val == 0:\n    val = 1\n```\n\nAnd my dictionary method:\n\n```python\nswap = {0: 1, 1:0}\nswap[val]\n```"

        "content": "Certainly! There is indeed a more concise and Pythonic way to swap the values of a binary variable (0 or 1) without using an if-else statement or a dictionary. You can achieve this using the XOR bitwise operator. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nval = val ^ 1\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The XOR operator (`^`) compares each bit of the numbers and returns 1 if the corresponding bits are different and 0 if they are the same.\n- For binary values 0 and 1:\n  - `0 ^ 1` results in `1`\n  - `1 ^ 1` results in `0`\n\nThis single line will toggle the value of `val` between 0 and 1 efficiently and is often considered a very Pythonic and clean way to achieve this."
