I have a property in my Django Model that I want to expose via a TastyPie ModelResource. My model is structured as follows:\n\n```python\nclass UserProfile(models.Model):\n    _genderChoices = ((u\"M\", u\"Male\"), (u\"F\", u\"Female\"))\n\n    user = Models.OneToOneField(User, editable=False)\n    gender = models.CharField(max_length=2, choices = _genderChoices)\n\n    def _get_full_name(self):\n        return \"%s %s\" % (self.user.first_name, self.user.last_name)\n\n    fullName = property(_get_full_name)\n```\n\nAnd my ModelResource is:\n\n```python\nclass UserProfileResource(ModelResource):\n    class Meta:\n        queryset = models.UserProfile.objects.all()\n        authorization = DjangoAuthorization()\n        fields = ['gender', 'fullName']\n```\n\nHowever, currently, the tastypie API is only outputting:\n\n```python\n{\n    gender: 'female',\n    resource_uri: \"/api/v1/userprofile/55/\"\n}\n```\n\nI have tried modifying the fields property in the ModelResource, but it didn't work. I'm trying to understand what could be causing this issue."

        "content": "To expose a property (virtual field) from a Django Model in a TastyPie `ModelResource`, you'll need to make use of the `dehydrate_<field_name>` method in your `ModelResource` class. This method allows you to customize the output for fields that are not directly part of the model's database schema, like your `fullName` property.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `UserProfileResource` to include the `fullName` property:\n\n```python\nfrom tastypie.resources import ModelResource\nfrom tastypie.authorization import DjangoAuthorization\nfrom myapp.models import UserProfile\n\nclass UserProfileResource(ModelResource):\n    class Meta:\n        queryset = UserProfile.objects.all()\n        authorization = DjangoAuthorization()\n        fields = ['gender']  # You can leave 'fullName' out from here\n\n    def dehydrate(self, bundle):\n        # Add the fullName property to the bundle's data\n        bundle.data['fullName'] = bundle.obj.fullName\n        return bundle\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Remove `fullName` from `fields`**: Since `fullName` is not a direct field in the model, it's better to handle it separately rather than listing it in the `fields` attribute.\n\n2. **Implement `dehydrate()` method**: This method is called to modify the data being sent to the client. By overriding it, you can add or modify the data that is returned in the API response. Here, we're adding the `fullName` property to the `bundle.data`.\n\nBy following this approach, your API response should include the `fullName` property along with the other fields:\n\n```python\n{\n    gender: 'female',\n    fullName: 'John Doe',\n    resource_uri: \"/api/v1/userprofile/55/\"\n}\n```\n\nThis solution effectively exposes your computed property through the TastyPie API."
