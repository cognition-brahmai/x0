Divide the sum by the total number of values in the list.\n3. Round the result to the nearest whole number if necessary.\n\nGiven the values 130, 200, 110, and 95, here is how you would do it in LaTeX:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\nThe numbers in the list are: 130, 200, 110, 95.\n\nThe formula to calculate the average is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of all numbers}}{\\text{Total number of values}}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the sum:\n\n\\[\n130 + 200 + 110 + 95 = 535\n\\]\n\nTotal number of values = 4.\n\nCalculating the average:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{535}{4} = 133.75\n\\]\n\nRounding 133.75 to the nearest whole number:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rounded Average} = 134\n\\]\n\nThus, the average of the given numbers, rounded to the nearest whole number, is 134.\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nThis LaTeX code will calculate and display the rounded average of the numbers."
