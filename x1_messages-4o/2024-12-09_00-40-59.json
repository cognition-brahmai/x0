        "content": "If you find that using `sed` is too slow for your needs, you can try using alternative commands that might perform better, particularly for large files. Here are a couple of options that you might consider:\n\n1. **Using `tail`:**\n\n   The `tail` command can be used to skip the first line and output the rest of the file, which can then be redirected to overwrite the original file.\n\n   ```bash\n   tail -n +2 \"$FILE\" > temp_file && mv temp_file \"$FILE\"\n   ```\n\n   This command uses `tail` to start reading from the second line (`+2`) and writes the output to a temporary file, which then replaces the original file.\n\n2. **Using `awk`:**\n\n   `awk` can also be used to skip the first line and is generally efficient.\n\n   ```bash\n   awk 'NR > 1' \"$FILE\" > temp_file && mv temp_file \"$FILE\"\n   ```\n\n   This command tells `awk` to print lines where the line number (`NR`) is greater than 1.\n\n3. **Using a loop with `head` and `tail`:**\n\n   If you need to repeatedly remove the first line, consider using a loop to automate the process until the file is empty or reaches a specific condition.\n\n   ```bash\n   while [[ -s \"$FILE\" ]]; do\n       tail -n +2 \"$FILE\" > temp_file && mv temp_file \"$FILE\"\n   done\n   ```\n\n   This loop will continue removing the first line until the file is empty.\n\nRemember to check whether the file is being accessed by other processes, as this could also slow down the operation. Using a temporary file helps ensure that the original file is not corrupted if the operation is interrupted. Also, ensure you have sufficient disk space for creating temporary files."
