For example, if the input is {320:1, 321:0, 322:3}, the function would return 321. I believe this could be achieved using the min() function but I'm not sure how to proceed. Can you help me with this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can use the `min()` function in Python to achieve this by specifying the dictionary's `get` method as the key function. This way, `min()` will evaluate the dictionary based on its values rather than its keys. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef get_key_of_min_value(d):\n    return min(d, key=d.get)\n\n# Example usage\nmy_dict = {320: 1, 321: 0, 322: 3}\nkey_with_min_value = get_key_of_min_value(my_dict)\nprint(key_with_min_value)  # Output: 321\n```\n\nIn this code, `min(d, key=d.get)` finds the key associated with the smallest value in the dictionary `d`. The `key=d.get` part tells `min()` to use the dictionary's values for comparison instead of its keys."
