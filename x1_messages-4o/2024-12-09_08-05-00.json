My goal is to continuously send data from the client to the server and vice versa. The server and client are able to communicate once successfully, but I am struggling to make it happen continuously. Could you please guide me on what I might be doing wrong?\n\nHere are my current scripts:\n\nServer.py:\n\n```python\nimport socket\n\nserversocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\nhost = \"192.168.1.3\"\nport = 8000\nprint (host)\nprint (port)\nserversocket.bind((host, port))\n\nserversocket.listen(5)\nprint ('server started and listening')\nwhile 1:\n    (clientsocket, address) = serversocket.accept()\n    print (\"connection found!\")\n    data = clientsocket.recv(1024).decode()\n    print (data)\n    r='REceieve'\n    clientsocket.send(r.encode())\n```\n\nClient.py:\n\n```python\nimport socket\n\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\nhost =\"192.168.1.3\"\nport =8000\ns.connect((host,port))\n\ndef ts(str):\n   s.send('e'.encode()) \n   data = ''\n   data = s.recv(1024).decode()\n   print (data)\n\nwhile 2:\n   r = input('enter')\n   ts(s)\n\ns.close ()\n```"

Here\u2019s a step-by-step improvement for both the server and client scripts:\n\n### Server.py\n\n```python\nimport socket\n\nserversocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\nhost = \"192.168.1.3\"\nport = 8000\nserversocket.bind((host, port))\n\nserversocket.listen(5)\nprint('Server started and listening')\n\n# Accept connection from the client\nclientsocket, address = serversocket.accept()\nprint(\"Connection established with:\", address)\n\nwhile True:\n    # Receive data from the client\n    data = clientsocket.recv(1024).decode()\n    if not data:\n        # If no data is received, break the loop\n        break\n    print(\"Client:\", data)\n\n    # Get response from the server user\n    response = input(\"Server: \")\n    clientsocket.send(response.encode())\n\nclientsocket.close()\n```\n\n### Client.py\n\n```python\nimport socket\n\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\nhost = \"192.168.1.3\"\nport = 8000\ns.connect((host, port))\n\nwhile True:\n    # Send message to the server\n    message = input(\"Client: \")\n    s.send(message.encode())\n\n    # Receive response from the server\n    data = s.recv(1024).decode()\n    if not data:\n        # If no data is received, break the loop\n        break\n    print(\"Server:\", data)\n\ns.close()\n```\n\n### Key Changes and Explanations:\n\n1. **Continuous Loop**: Both the server and client now have an infinite loop (`while True`) to continuously send and receive messages until the connection is closed.\n\n2. **Input from User**: Both scripts now prompt the user to input a message each time they want to send something. For the server, it uses `input(\"Server: \")`, and for the client, it uses `input(\"Client: \")`.\n\n3. **Break Condition**: Both scripts check if the received data is empty (`if not data:`), which indicates that the connection has been closed, thus breaking the loop.\n\n4. **Correct Function Usage**: In the client script, the function `ts` was redundant and incorrectly defined. Instead, the logic is now directly in the loop.\n\nThese changes should allow for continuous communication between the server and client. Make sure the IP address (`host`) and port are correctly set and the same on both the server and client scripts. Also, ensure any firewall settings allow for traffic on the specified port."
