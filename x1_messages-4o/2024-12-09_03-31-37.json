I would like to generate a file to store all of these variables, similar to the .h files in C that contain numerous #define. I have attempted to use configparser, but did not find it particularly intuitive or enjoyable. Is there a superior alternative?"

        "content": "In Python, there isn't a built-in mechanism specifically for defining constant variables like in some other programming languages. However, there are several common conventions and practices you can use to achieve a similar effect:\n\n1. **Use a Module**: You can create a separate Python file (module) to store your constants. By convention, you can use uppercase letters for constant names to indicate that they should not be changed.\n\n   ```python\n   # constants.py\n   PI = 3.14159\n   GRAVITY = 9.81\n   SPEED_OF_LIGHT = 299792458\n   ```\n\n   Then, you can import these constants into your main program:\n\n   ```python\n   # main.py\n   import constants\n\n   print(constants.PI)\n   ```\n\n2. **Use an Enum**: If your constants are related and you want to give them a bit more structure, you can use the `enum` module. This is especially useful for defining a set of related constants.\n\n   ```python\n   from enum import Enum\n\n   class Constants(Enum):\n       PI = 3.14159\n       GRAVITY = 9.81\n       SPEED_OF_LIGHT = 299792458\n\n   print(Constants.PI.value)\n   ```\n\n3. **Use a Class**: Another approach is to define a class with class attributes for your constants. This can be useful if you want to encapsulate your constants in a namespace.\n\n   ```python\n   class Constants:\n       PI = 3.14159\n       GRAVITY = 9.81\n       SPEED_OF_LIGHT = 299792458\n\n   print(Constants.PI)\n   ```\n\n4. **Use a NamedTuple**: If your constants are related and you want them to be immutable, you can use a `namedtuple` from the `collections` module.\n\n   ```python\n   from collections import namedtuple\n\n   Constants = namedtuple('Constants', ['PI', 'GRAVITY', 'SPEED_OF_LIGHT'])\n   constants = Constants(3.14159, 9.81, 299792458)\n\n   print(constants.PI)\n   ```\n\nThese methods provide clear, maintainable, and Pythonic ways to define and use constants in your programs. Choose the one that best fits your use case. For a large number of constants, using a module or a class is often the simplest and most straightforward approach."
