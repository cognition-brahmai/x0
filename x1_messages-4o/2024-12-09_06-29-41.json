I don't want to waste CPU resources checking the hardware too frequently, so I'd like to give other threads and processes a chance to execute. In other languages, there's usually a 'yield' function that gives control back to the scheduler, but I can't find a similar function in Python's threading library. What is the appropriate way to yield the rest of a thread's quantum in Python?\n\nHere's my current code:\n\n```python\nwhile not hardware_is_ready():\n    pass\nprocess_data_from_hardware()\n```\n\nI tried using a 'yield' function like this:\n\n```python\nwhile not hardware_is_ready():\n    threading.yield()          # This function doesn't exist.\nprocess_data_from_hardware()\n```\n\nBut Python's 'yield' is related to generators and doesn't work in this context. What should I do?"

        "content": "In Python, to effectively yield control in a multi-threaded environment and avoid busy-waiting, you can use the `time.sleep()` function. This allows the thread to pause for a specified amount of time, giving other threads and processes a chance to execute. While Python's threading library does not have a direct `yield` function like some other languages, using `time.sleep()` is a common and practical approach.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\nwhile not hardware_is_ready():\n    time.sleep(0.01)  # Sleep for 10 milliseconds\nprocess_data_from_hardware()\n```\n\nBy using `time.sleep(0.01)`, the thread pauses for 10 milliseconds on each iteration of the loop. This reduces CPU usage and allows other threads to execute. You can adjust the sleep duration based on the responsiveness you need and the performance characteristics of your application."
