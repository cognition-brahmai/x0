In this case, you want to sort based on the `resultType` attribute of each object in the list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Assuming your list is named `somelist`\n# and each object in the list has an attribute `resultType`\n\n# Define a function or lambda that retrieves the `resultType` from each object\nsomelist.sort(key=lambda obj: obj.resultType)\n\n# Now `somelist` is sorted in place based on the `resultType` attribute\n```\n\nIf you want to sort the list in descending order, you can add the `reverse=True` parameter:\n\n```python\nsomelist.sort(key=lambda obj: obj.resultType, reverse=True)\n```\n\nThis will sort the list in place, meaning the original list will be modified and sorted according to the `resultType` attribute of each object."
