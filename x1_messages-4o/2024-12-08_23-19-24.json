However, there's a catch - you cannot use a loop or any built-in functions to solve this problem. Can you figure out how to do it with only recursion and mathematical operations? Once you have a solution, provide the time and space complexity of your function. Remember, the time complexity refers to the number of operations required to solve the problem, while the space complexity refers to the amount of memory used. Good luck!"

        "content": "Certainly! We can solve this problem using recursion. The idea is to recursively sum the elements of the array by reducing the problem size at each step.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of the `sum_numbers` function in Go:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\n// sumNumbers is a recursive function that sums the numbers in an array.\nfunc sumNumbers(numbers []int) int {\n    if len(numbers) == 0 {\n        return 0\n    }\n    return numbers[0] + sumNumbers(numbers[1:])\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n    fmt.Println(sumNumbers(numbers)) // Output: 15\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The base case for the recursion is when the array is empty (`len(numbers) == 0`). In this case, the function returns 0 because there are no numbers to sum.\n- In the recursive case, we take the first element of the array (`numbers[0]`) and add it to the result of the recursive call `sumNumbers(numbers[1:])`, which sums the rest of the array.\n\n### Time and Space Complexity:\n- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of elements in the array. This is because we make one recursive call for each element in the array.\n- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(n) \\). This is due to the recursion stack. In the worst case, the depth of the recursion stack will be equal to the number of elements in the array, requiring \\( O(n) \\) space.\n\nThis implementation efficiently sums the elements of the array using recursion without any loops or built-in summation functions."
