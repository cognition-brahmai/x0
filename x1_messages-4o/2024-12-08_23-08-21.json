        "content": "To extract the title of the fourth Harry Potter movie from the given JSON data, you can use a JSON query. Since the data is structured as an array of movie objects, you can access the fourth element in the \"movies\" array.\n\nIn JSONPath, a query language similar to XPath for JSON, you can use the following query:\n\n```jsonpath\n$.movies[3].title\n```\n\nThis query will return:\n\n```\n\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\"\n```\n\nHere's a brief explanation:\n\n- `$` refers to the root object of the JSON.\n- `.movies` accesses the \"movies\" array.\n- `[3]` selects the fourth element in the array (indexing starts at 0).\n- `.title` accesses the \"title\" field within that movie object.\n\nIf you are using a programming language to process this JSON, you would use its specific syntax to achieve the same extraction. For example, in Python, you could do:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndata = {\n    \"movies\": [\n        {\n            \"title\": \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\",\n            \"release_year\": 2001\n        },\n        {\n            \"title\": \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\",\n            \"release_year\": 2002\n        },\n        {\n            \"title\": \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\",\n            \"release_year\": 2004\n        },\n        {\n            \"title\": \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\",\n            \"release_year\": 2005\n        },\n        {\n            \"title\": \"Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix\",\n            \"release_year\": 2007\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nfourth_movie_title = data['movies'][3]['title']\nprint(fourth_movie_title)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\n```"
