        "content": "I am using a Python script to collect data from a PIC microcontroller through a serial port at 2Mbps. The PIC and the FTDI usb-serial port are both operating perfectly at 2Mbps, as confirmed with an oscilloscope. I am sending messages of about 15 characters approximately 100-150 times per second and I'm incrementing a counter in each message to check for lost messages. I am able to read the serial port via Putty and my Python script (Python 2.7 and pySerial) on my Xubuntu virtual machine. However, I encounter an issue when opening the serial port via pySerial. Instead of receiving 100-150 messages per second, I receive about 5 per second. Even though the message increments one by one, I suspect that they are being stored in a buffer because I continue to receive messages even after turning off the PIC. Here is the code snippet I am using:\n\n```python\nser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 2000000, timeout=2, xonxoff=False, rtscts=False, dsrdtr=False) #Tried with and without the last 3 parameters, and also at 1Mbps, same happens.\nser.flushInput()\nser.flushOutput()\nWhile True:\n  data_raw = ser.readline()\n  print(data_raw)\n```\n\nWhy does pySerial take so much time to read from the serial port until the end of the line? How can I resolve this and receive the messages in real time?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with pySerial receiving data at a much slower rate than expected can be due to several factors. Let's go through some possible causes and solutions:\n\n1. **Line Ending Issue**: The `readline()` method waits for a newline character (`\\n`) to determine the end of a line. If your PIC microcontroller is not sending newline characters or is using a different line-ending character (like `\\r`), `readline()` will not behave as expected. You can try using `read_until()` with a specific line-ending character or manually handle the buffer:\n\n    ```python\n    import serial\n\n    ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 2000000, timeout=2, xonxoff=False, rtscts=False, dsrdtr=False)\n    ser.flushInput()\n    ser.flushOutput()\n\n    buffer = \"\"\n    while True:\n        if ser.in_waiting > 0:  # Check if there is data in the buffer\n            buffer += ser.read(ser.in_waiting).decode('utf-8')\n            if '\\n' in buffer:\n                lines = buffer.split('\\n')\n                for line in lines[:-1]:\n                    print(line)\n                buffer = lines[-1]\n    ```\n\n2. **Buffer Size**: The default buffer size might not be sufficient for handling high throughput data. You can try increasing the buffer size:\n\n    ```python\n    ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 2000000, timeout=2, xonxoff=False, rtscts=False, dsrdtr=False)\n    ser.set_buffer_size(rx_size=4096, tx_size=4096)\n    ```\n\n3. **Virtual Machine Performance**: Sometimes, serial communication can be affected by the performance of a virtual machine. If possible, try running your script on a native machine (not a virtual machine) to see if it improves performance.\n\n4. **Flow Control**: Ensure that there are no issues with flow control settings. You mentioned trying with and without `rtscts`, `xonxoff`, and `dsrdtr`. Verify that these settings match the configuration of your hardware.\n\n5. **Serial Port Configuration**: Verify that the serial port configuration such as baud rate, data bits, parity, and stop bits match exactly with those set on the PIC microcontroller.\n\n6. **Python Version**: You are using Python 2.7, which is outdated. If possible, upgrade to Python 3.x and use the latest version of pySerial, as it may have performance improvements and bug fixes.\n\n7. **CPU Usage and Performance**: Ensure that your CPU is not overloaded, as high CPU usage can lead to slower processing and reading of serial data.\n\nBy addressing these potential issues, you should be able to improve the performance of your serial communication and receive messages in real time."
