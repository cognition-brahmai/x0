        "content": "I'm trying to create a few Tkinter buttons using a for loop. I have a function that prints the name of the button, and I want each button to have its own parameter (e.g., \"Test\" for the first button and \"Test2\" for the second). However, when I press the buttons, they both print \"Test2\", which means they are using the same function with the same parameter. How can I resolve this issue? Here is the code I'm using:\n\n```python\ndef a(self, name):\n    print(name)\n\nusers = {\"Test\": \"127.0.0.0\", \"Test2\": \"128.0.0.0\"}\nrow = 1\nfor name in users:\n    user_button = Tkinter.Button(self.root, text=name, command=lambda: self.a(name))\n    user_button.grid(row=row, column=0)\n    row += 1\n```"

        "content": "This is a common issue when using lambda functions within a loop in Python. The problem occurs because the lambda function captures the variable `name` by reference, not by value. By the time the button is clicked, the loop has finished executing, and `name` is left with its last value in the loop.\n\nTo solve this issue, you can pass `name` as a default argument to the lambda function. This captures the current value of `name` at each iteration, rather than a reference to the variable itself.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to fix this issue:\n\n```python\ndef a(self, name):\n    print(name)\n\nusers = {\"Test\": \"127.0.0.0\", \"Test2\": \"128.0.0.0\"}\nrow = 1\nfor name in users:\n    user_button = Tkinter.Button(self.root, text=name, command=lambda name=name: self.a(name))\n    user_button.grid(row=row, column=0)\n    row += 1\n```\n\nBy adding `name=name` in the lambda function, you're creating a new default argument `name` for each lambda, which holds the value of `name` at the time the lambda is created. This ensures each button is associated with the correct name when clicked."
