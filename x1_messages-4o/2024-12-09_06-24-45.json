When I try to compile, I encounter the error \"Rcpp.h: No such file or directory\" even though Rcpp is installed and I have included Rcpp.h. I've been using CentOS, CUDA version 6, and have access to 4 GPUs of the same make and model. I want to make my package as platform-independent as possible and would also like to know how to compile with a Makevars or Makevars.in instead of a Makefile. Also, the error goes away when I separate my C++ and CUDA code into separate *.cpp and *.cu files. But, I would still like to be able to use CUDA and Rcpp in the same *.cu file. How can I resolve these issues?"

        "content": "To address your compilation issues and achieve platform-independence for your R package using CUDA and Rcpp, let's break down the solutions step-by-step.\n\n### Problem 1: \"Rcpp.h: No such file or directory\"\n\nThis error is usually caused by the compiler not finding the Rcpp headers. Here are some steps to resolve this:\n\n1. **Ensure Rcpp is Properly Installed:**\n   - Double-check that Rcpp is installed in your R environment using `install.packages(\"Rcpp\")`.\n   - Verify the installation by running `Rcpp::evalCpp(\"1+1\")` in R.\n\n2. **Include the Correct Header Paths:**\n   - In your `Makevars` or `Makevars.in`, you need to specify the include paths for Rcpp. You can do this by using:\n     ```make\n     PKG_CXXFLAGS = $(shell Rscript -e \"Rcpp:::CxxFlags()\")\n     PKG_LIBS = $(shell Rscript -e \"Rcpp:::LdFlags()\")\n     ```\n\n3. **Configure Your Makevars:**\n   - In the root of your package, create a file named `src/Makevars` or `src/Makevars.in`.\n   - Add the following lines to include paths and link libraries:\n     ```make\n     CUDA_HOME = /usr/local/cuda\n     PKG_CXXFLAGS += -I$(CUDA_HOME)/include $(shell Rscript -e \"Rcpp:::CxxFlags()\")\n     PKG_LIBS += -L$(CUDA_HOME)/lib64 -lcudart $(shell Rscript -e \"Rcpp:::LdFlags()\")\n     ```\n\n### Problem 2: Combining CUDA and Rcpp Code\n\nWhen you combine CUDA and Rcpp code, you need to ensure the compiler can handle both. Here\u2019s how you can resolve this:\n\n1. **Use Separate Compilation:**\n   - The error goes away when you separate files because `nvcc`, the CUDA compiler, can struggle with C++ headers like Rcpp. Continue to separate your CUDA and C++ logic into `.cu` and `.cpp` files.\n\n2. **Linking CUDA and C++ Code:**\n   - Compile your `.cu` files with `nvcc` and your `.cpp` files with `g++`.\n   - Use the `Makevars` file to ensure the correct compilation process:\n     ```make\n     NVCC = $(CUDA_HOME)/bin/nvcc\n     CUFLAGS = -O3 -G -g -Xcompiler -fPIC\n\n     object_files = my_cuda_code.o my_cpp_code.o\n\n     all: $(object_files)\n\n     my_cuda_code.o: my_cuda_code.cu\n     \t$(NVCC) $(CUFLAGS) -c my_cuda_code.cu -o my_cuda_code.o\n\n     my_cpp_code.o: my_cpp_code.cpp\n     \t$(CXX) $(PKG_CXXFLAGS) -c my_cpp_code.cpp -o my_cpp_code.o\n\n     clean:\n     \trm -f $(object_files)\n     ```\n\n3. **Linking:**\n   - Make sure to link all object files together in the R package setup.\n\nBy using these strategies, you'll be able to compile your R package that uses both CUDA and Rcpp effectively and maintain platform independence. If you encounter further issues, consider checking the compilation logs for additional errors or warnings, and adjust the paths based on your system's configuration."
