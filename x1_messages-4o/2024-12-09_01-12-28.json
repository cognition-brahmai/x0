For instance, my DataFrame looks like the one below:\n\n```\n      A\n0   [1,2]\n1   [3,4]\n2   [8,9] \n3   [2,6]\n```\n\nI am trying to access the first element of each list and save it into a new column of the DataFrame. The desired output would look like this:\n\n```\n      A     new_col\n0   [1,2]      1\n1   [3,4]      3\n2   [8,9]      8\n3   [2,6]      2\n```\n\nI understand that this could potentially be achieved by iterating over each row, but is there a more \"pythonic\" or efficient way to accomplish this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this efficiently using the `apply` method in combination with a lambda function. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'A': [[1, 2], [3, 4], [8, 9], [2, 6]]\n})\n\n# Create a new column 'new_col' by applying a lambda function\ndf['new_col'] = df['A'].apply(lambda x: x[0])\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThe `apply` method is a powerful tool in Pandas that allows you to apply a function along an axis of the DataFrame. Here, we're using it to extract the first element of each list in column 'A', which is exactly what you need.\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```\n      A     new_col\n0   [1, 2]      1\n1   [3, 4]      3\n2   [8, 9]      8\n3   [2, 6]      2\n```\n\nThis approach is both concise and efficient, leveraging Pandas' vectorized operations."
