I have installed PyMuPDF, muPDF, and fitz modules. However, when I run my code, I get an error. The code I'm using is as follows:\n\n```python\n    doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)\n            for i in range(len(doc)):\n                for img in doc.getPageImageList(i):\n                    xref = img[0]\n                    pix = fitz.Pixmap(doc, xref)\n                    if pix.n < 5:  # this is GRAY or RGB\n                        pix.writePNG(\"p%s-%s.png\" % (i, xref))\n                    else:  # CMYK: convert to RGB first\n                        pix1 = fitz.Pixmap(fitz.csRGB, pix)\n                        pix1.writePNG(\"p%s-%s.png\" % (i, xref))\n                        pix1 = None\n                    pix = None\n```\n\nThe full error message I get is:\n\n```bash\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File \"/home/waqar/PycharmProjects/predator/ExtractFileImage.py\", line 1, in <module>\n        import fitz\n      File \"/home/waqar/anaconda3/envs/retinanet/lib/python3.6/site-packages/fitz/__init__.py\", line 1, in <module>\n        from frontend import *\n    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'frontend'\n```"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering, \"No module named 'frontend',\" suggests that there might be an issue with the installation or importation of the PyMuPDF library. Here are some steps to help you resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check the Installation**:\n   - Ensure that you have installed the PyMuPDF package correctly. You can reinstall it using pip to make sure it's set up properly. Run the following command:\n     ```bash\n     pip install --upgrade pymupdf\n     ```\n   - If you're using a specific Python environment (like Anaconda), make sure you install PyMuPDF in that environment.\n\n2. **Verify the Package Import**:\n   - The `fitz` module is the correct import for PyMuPDF. However, if you've installed it as `pymupdf`, you might need to import it as follows:\n     ```python\n     import fitz  # This should be correct for PyMuPDF\n     ```\n\n3. **Check for Conflicting Installations**:\n   - Sometimes having multiple Python environments or previously installed versions of the same package can cause conflicts. Make sure that there are no old or conflicting installations by uninstalling any existing ones:\n     ```bash\n     pip uninstall fitz\n     pip uninstall pymupdf\n     ```\n   - After uninstalling, reinstall PyMuPDF again:\n     ```bash\n     pip install pymupdf\n     ```\n\n4. **Check the Python Environment**:\n   - Make sure that you're using the correct Python interpreter in your development environment. If you're using PyCharm, double-check the project interpreter settings to ensure it matches the environment where PyMuPDF is installed.\n\n5. **Debugging Path Issues**:\n   - You can also print the `sys.path` in your script to check if the directory where PyMuPDF is installed is included. Add these lines at the beginning of your script:\n     ```python\n     import sys\n     print(sys.path)\n     ```\n\n6. **Check the Python Version**:\n   - Ensure that the Python version you're using is compatible with the installed version of PyMuPDF. Sometimes, certain versions of a library are only compatible with specific Python versions.\n\n7. **Check for Updates**:\n   - Occasionally, a bug in a specific version of a library can cause errors. Check if there are any updates or patches for PyMuPDF that might resolve this issue.\n\nIf you've followed these steps and the issue persists, please provide additional context or error messages if any arise. This will help further diagnose the problem."
