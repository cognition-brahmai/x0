My project structure is as follows:\n\n```\nProject_path  \n |\n +--app\n |  |\n |  +--main.py\n +--static\n    |\n    +--js\n       |\n       +--jquery-1.11.2.min.js\n```\n\nMy `main.py` file is:\n\n```\n@app.route('/js/<path:path>')\ndef serve_static(path):\n    root_dir = os.path.dirname(os.getcwd())\n    print(os.path.join(root_dir, 'static', 'js', path))\n    return app.send_static_file(os.path.join(root_dir, 'static', 'js', path))\n```\n\nAnd my `index.html` is:\n```\n...\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/js/jquery-1.11.2.min.js\"></script>\n...\n```\n\nWhen I visit `/`, I can see the correct path of the JavaScript file (`Project_path/static/js/jquery-1.11.2.min.js`) printed on the screen, but I still get a 404 error (`127.0.0.1 - - [22/Dec/2014 11:26:30] \"GET /js/jquery-1.11.2.min.js HTTP/1.1\" 404 -`). What am I doing wrong?\n\nAlso, after stepping through the `send_static_file` method, I found that I should not use an absolute path as an argument. Flask has a judgement in `send_static_file`:\n\n```\nif os.path.isabs(filename) or \\\n   filename == '..' or \\\n   filename.startswith('../'):\n    raise NotFound()\n```\n\nSince the `filename` I passed in is an absolute path, Flask raises `NotFound()`. I think I need to pass in a relative path to `self.static_folder` (where `self` is `<Flask 'main'>`), which in my project is `Project_name/app/static`. However, I didn't set `static_folder` myself, which means Flask thinks the static folder should be there. Can you help me with this?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is related to the way Flask handles static files. By default, Flask serves static files from a folder named `static` located at the root of your application. Your current project structure doesn't follow this convention, and your attempt to serve static files manually using `send_static_file` is encountering the problem with absolute paths.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this:\n\n1. **Adjust Project Structure:**\n   Move the `static` folder inside the `app` directory, so it looks like this:\n\n   ```\n   Project_path  \n   |\n   +--app\n      |\n      +--main.py\n      +--static\n         |\n         +--js\n            |\n            +--jquery-1.11.2.min.js\n   ```\n\n2. **Update Flask Static Folder Configuration:**\n   In your `main.py`, configure Flask to use the `static` folder inside your `app` directory. You can do this by specifying the `static_folder` parameter when creating your Flask app instance:\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask, send_from_directory\n   import os\n\n   app = Flask(__name__, static_folder='static')\n\n   @app.route('/js/<path:path>')\n   def serve_static(path):\n       return send_from_directory(os.path.join(app.root_path, 'static', 'js'), path)\n\n   # Alternatively, if you move the static folder as suggested, you don't need this custom route.\n   # Flask will automatically serve files from the static directory.\n   ```\n\n3. **Serve Static Files Automatically:**\n   With the `static` folder inside the `app` directory, you don't need a custom route to serve static files. Flask will automatically handle requests for static files. You can simply include the script in your `index.html` like this:\n\n   ```html\n   ...\n   <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='js/jquery-1.11.2.min.js') }}\"></script>\n   ...\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, Flask will be able to automatically serve your static files from the `static` folder. The `url_for` function ensures that the URL is generated correctly, even if the application is hosted in a subdirectory or if the static files are served from a different path."
