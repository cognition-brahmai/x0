I noticed that while there is no mean absolute error (MAE), there is a NMAE. Can someone explain what the difference between these two metrics are? For instance, if I had two models with the following results: model 1 with an NMAE of -2.6 and model 2 with an NMAE of -3.0, which model would be considered better? In addition, how does a negative score compare to a positive one? For instance, if model 1 had an NMAE of -1.7 and model 2 had an MAE of 1.4, which model would be superior?"

        "content": "In machine learning and statistical modeling, metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used to evaluate the performance of regression models. MAE is a straightforward metric that calculates the average of the absolute errors, providing a sense of how much predictions deviate from actual values on average.\n\nThe term \"Negative Mean Absolute Error\" (NMAE) often appears in the context of certain scoring functions or cross-validation routines that aim to maximize a score. In these contexts, metrics are sometimes negated to fit into a framework where higher values indicate better performance. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** \n   - Non-negative value representing the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.\n   - Lower MAE indicates better model performance.\n\n2. **Negative Mean Absolute Error (NMAE):**\n   - Simply the negation of the MAE.\n   - Used where higher scores indicate better performance (e.g., within certain cross-validation functions in scikit-learn that maximize scores).\n   - A more negative NMAE indicates a worse performance when compared to a less negative NMAE.\n\n3. **Comparing Models:**\n   - For NMAE, a less negative score is better. So, between model 1 with an NMAE of -2.6 and model 2 with an NMAE of -3.0, model 1 is considered better because -2.6 is greater than -3.0.\n   - When comparing an NMAE to a positive MAE, the direct comparison can be misleading because they are effectively just negations of each other. To compare them, it's logical to convert the NMAE back to MAE (by taking the absolute value) and then compare. \n   - If model 1 has an NMAE of -1.7, its MAE is 1.7. Comparing this with model 2's MAE of 1.4, model 2 is better because it has a lower MAE.\n\nIn summary, when comparing models using these metrics, always ensure you're comparing like with like (i.e., both as MAE or both as NMAE) and remember that lower MAE (or less negative NMAE) indicates better model performance."
