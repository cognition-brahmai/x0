However, I also want to add an additional column that contains the number of rows in each group. Here is the code I have so far:\n\n```python\ndf['col1','col2','col3','col4'].groupby(['col1','col2']).mean()\n```\nI'm able to get the mean but I would also like to find out how many numbers were used to calculate these means. For instance, if the first group has 8 values and the second one has 10 values, how can I incorporate this into my dataframe?"

        "content": "To get group-wise statistics such as count and mean using `pandas`, you can use the `GroupBy` object and `agg` function. Additionally, you can reset the index to have your group keys as columns in the output DataFrame. Here's how you can modify your code to include the count of each group:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'col1': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B'],\n    'col2': ['X', 'Y', 'X', 'X', 'Y', 'Y', 'X', 'Y'],\n    'col3': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80],\n    'col4': [15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Group by 'col1' and 'col2', then calculate mean and size\ngrouped = df.groupby(['col1', 'col2']).agg(\n    mean_col3=('col3', 'mean'),\n    mean_col4=('col4', 'mean'),\n    count=('col3', 'size')  # or 'col4', both will give the same result for count\n).reset_index()\n\nprint(grouped)\n```\n\nHere's what this code does:\n- The `groupby(['col1', 'col2'])` groups the DataFrame by the specified columns.\n- The `agg` function is used to calculate different statistics for each group. You can specify the name of the resulting columns and the aggregation function you want to apply.\n  - `mean_col3=('col3', 'mean')` calculates the mean of `col3` for each group.\n  - `mean_col4=('col4', 'mean')` calculates the mean of `col4` for each group.\n  - `count=('col3', 'size')` calculates the number of rows in each group.\n- Finally, `reset_index()` is used to convert the group keys into columns in the resulting DataFrame.\n\nThis will give you a DataFrame with the mean of `col3` and `col4` for each group, along with a column for the count of rows in each group."
