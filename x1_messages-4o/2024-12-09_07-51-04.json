I need a method that can tell me the minimum angle to rotate from a to b, where a positive sign indicates a rotation from +x-axis towards +y-axis and a negative sign indicates a rotation from +x-axis towards -y-axis. For example:\n\n```python\nassert angle((1,0),(0,1)) == pi/2.\nassert angle((0,1),(1,0)) == -pi/2.\n```\n\nI am aware that theta = arccos((a.b)/(|a||b|)), however, this does not contain a sign."

        "content": "To calculate the signed angle between two vectors \\( \\mathbf{a} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{b} \\), you can use the `atan2` function, which can help distinguish between clockwise and counterclockwise rotations. The `atan2` function computes the angle based on the signs of the input, which allows it to capture the direction of the rotation.\n\nHere's a general method to compute the signed angle:\n\n1. Compute the dot product \\( \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} \\).\n2. Compute the cross product \\( \\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} \\).\n3. Use `atan2` to compute the signed angle.\n\nHere's the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef angle(a, b):\n    # Compute the dot product and determinant (cross product magnitude in 2D)\n    dot_product = a[0] * b[0] + a[1] * b[1]\n    cross_product_mag = a[0] * b[1] - a[1] * b[0]\n    \n    # Use atan2 to find the angle\n    theta = math.atan2(cross_product_mag, dot_product)\n    \n    return theta\n\n# Example usage\na = (1, 0)\nb = (0, 1)\nprint(angle(a, b))  # Output: pi/2\n\na = (0, 1)\nb = (1, 0)\nprint(angle(a, b))  # Output: -pi/2\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `dot_product` is calculated as \\( a_x \\cdot b_x + a_y \\cdot b_y \\).\n- The `cross_product_mag` in 2D is calculated as \\( a_x \\cdot b_y - a_y \\cdot b_x \\), which gives the magnitude of the vector perpendicular to both \\( \\mathbf{a} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{b} \\).\n- The `atan2` function takes the `cross_product_mag` as the first argument and the `dot_product` as the second argument, providing an angle in the range \\([- \\pi, \\pi]\\) that correctly indicates the rotation direction."
