In python arrays, this can be accomplished with `if row in array:` but this doesn't seem to work the same way for Numpy arrays. For example, with Python arrays:\n```\n>>> a = [[1,2],[10,20],[100,200]]\n>>> [1,2] in a\nTrue\n>>> [1,20] in a\nFalse\n```\nHowever, Numpy arrays give different results:\n```\n>>> a = np.array([[1,2],[10,20],[100,200]])\n>>> np.array([1,2]) in a\nTrue\n>>> np.array([1,20]) in a\nTrue\n>>> np.array([1,42]) in a\nTrue\n>>> np.array([42,1]) in a\nFalse\n```\nHow can I achieve the same effect as Python arrays in Numpy arrays, where the operation terminates upon finding the first matching row?"

        "content": "To achieve the same effect in Numpy arrays as you would with Python lists, you can utilize Numpy's vectorized operations for efficient row matching. Here's a Pythonic and efficient way to check if a Numpy array contains at least one instance of a given row:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the Numpy array\na = np.array([[1, 2], [10, 20], [100, 200]])\n\n# Define the row to check\nrow_to_check = np.array([1, 2])\n\n# Use np.all to compare each row with the row_to_check\ndef contains_row(array, row):\n    return np.any(np.all(array == row, axis=1))\n\n# Check if the given row is in the array\nresult = contains_row(a, row_to_check)\nprint(result)  # Output: True\n\n# Test with a different row\nrow_to_check = np.array([1, 20])\nresult = contains_row(a, row_to_check)\nprint(result)  # Output: False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`np.all(array == row, axis=1)`**: This creates a boolean array where each element is `True` if the corresponding row in `array` is equal to `row`. It does this by comparing each element of the row with the elements of the array along the specified axis (rows in this case).\n\n2. **`np.any(...)`**: This checks if there is any `True` value in the boolean array, which would indicate that at least one row in the array matches the specified row.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it leverages Numpy's fast vectorized operations, and it terminates as soon as it finds the first matching row, similar to the behavior with Python lists."
