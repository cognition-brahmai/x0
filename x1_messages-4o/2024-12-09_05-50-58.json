I have a package named 'p' with modules 'a' and 'b', where 'b' relies on 'a'. I've tried using relative import in 'b.py' like 'from . import a', but I get a ValueError: 'Attempted relative import in non-package' when I try to import 'b' from inside the 'p' directory. For reference, I'm using Python 2.7.3 and my directory looks like this:\n\n```\n/tmp\n    /p\n       a.py\n       b.py\n       __init__.py\n```\n\nThe following works when I'm outside the 'p' directory:\n\n```\n$ cd /tmp\n$ echo 'import p.b' | python\n```\n\nBut this does not work when I'm inside the 'p' directory:\n\n```\n$ cd /tmp/p\n$ echo 'import b' | python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"b.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from . import a\nValueError: Attempted relative import in non-package\n```\nWhy is this happening and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to how Python handles relative imports and the concept of packages. When you attempt to run a script directly inside the package directory (like `/tmp/p` in your case), Python does not recognize it as a package, but rather as a standalone script. This means relative imports, which are designed to work within a package, will fail because Python doesn't see the context of a package when running a script directly.\n\nTo resolve this, you can use absolute imports instead of relative imports, which should work regardless of your current working directory. Here are some approaches you can take:\n\n1. **Use Absolute Imports**: Change the import statement in `b.py` to use an absolute import. This way, it doesn't matter if you're running the script from inside the package directory or outside of it.\n\n   Modify your `b.py` like this:\n\n   ```python\n   import a\n   ```\n\n   This assumes that `p` is in your `PYTHONPATH` or is the current working directory when you run the script outside of `/tmp/p`.\n\n2. **Use the `-m` Option**: You can run your script using the `-m` option of the Python interpreter, which treats the directory as a package and allows relative imports to work correctly.\n\n   Run it like this:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ cd /tmp\n   $ python -m p.b\n   ```\n\n3. **Adjust the `PYTHONPATH`**: If you want to stay inside the `/tmp/p` directory and run `b.py`, you can adjust the `PYTHONPATH` to include the parent directory. This way, Python recognizes the package structure.\n\n   You can do this like:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ cd /tmp/p\n   $ PYTHONPATH=.. python -c 'import p.b'\n   ```\n\nThese modifications should help you resolve the import issues by ensuring that Python recognizes the package structure and can locate the modules correctly."
