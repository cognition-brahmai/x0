Can you provide an example of how I can write a script in Perl to generate Fibonacci numbers, similar to how it's done in Python? In Python, I can dynamically generate a subsection of a large list as needed using iterators. However, in Perl, lists seem more static. Can Perl's 'foreach' be dynamic or is it only based on a static list? Is there a Perl equivalent of Python's 'yield' that I'm missing?\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\ndef fibonacci(mag):\n     a, b = 0, 1\n     while a<=10**mag:\n         yield a\n         a, b = b, a+b\n\nfor number in fibonacci(15):  \n     print \"%17d\" % number\n```\n\nIn Perl, how can I achieve similar functionality?\n\n```perl\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nuse warnings; use strict;\n\nsub fibonacci {\n   # What goes here other than returning an array or list? \n}\n\nforeach my $number (fibonacci(15)) { print $number . \"\\n\"; }\n```"

        "content": "In Perl, you can achieve similar functionality to Python's generators using closures. Perl doesn't have a direct equivalent of Python's `yield`, but you can use closures to create an iterator-like behavior. Here's how you can implement a lazy Fibonacci sequence generator in Perl:\n\n```perl\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nuse warnings;\nuse strict;\n\nsub fibonacci {\n    my ($max_magnitude) = @_;\n    my ($a, $b) = (0, 1);\n\n    return sub {\n        if ($a <= 10**$max_magnitude) {\n            my $next = $a;\n            ($a, $b) = ($b, $a + $b);\n            return $next;\n        }\n        return;  # Return undef to signal end of iteration\n    };\n}\n\nmy $fib_iterator = fibonacci(15);\n\nwhile (defined(my $number = $fib_iterator->())) {\n    printf \"%17d\\n\", $number;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Closure**: The `fibonacci` subroutine returns a reference to an anonymous subroutine. This subroutine maintains its own state (`$a` and `$b`), which is preserved between calls.\n\n- **Iterator Behavior**: Each call to the `$fib_iterator->()` retrieves the next Fibonacci number. When the sequence exceeds `10**$max_magnitude`, it returns `undef`, which signals the end of the iteration.\n\n- **Looping**: The `while` loop continues calling the iterator until it returns `undef`.\n\nThis approach effectively mimics the behavior of Python's generator function in Perl by using a closure to encapsulate the state needed for iteration."
