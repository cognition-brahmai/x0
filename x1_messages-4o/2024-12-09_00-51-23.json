For example, with a simple dictionary like `myDict = {'key1':1, 'key2':2}`, I can use `print myDict.get('key3')` and no errors will be thrown even if 'key3' does not exist, as .get() returns None. However, with a nested dictionary, such as `myDict={}; myDict['key1'] = {'attr1':1,'attr2':2}`, using `print myDict.get('key1')['attr3']` will give a KeyError, and `print myDict.get('key3').get('attr1')` will fail with an AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'. How can I handle this situation?"

        "content": "To safely access nested dictionary values without encountering errors for non-existent keys, you can use a combination of the `.get()` method and conditional checks. Here\u2019s a step-by-step approach to handle this situation:\n\n1. Use the `.get()` method to safely retrieve the first level of the dictionary.\n2. Check if the result is not `None` before attempting to access further nested keys.\n3. Use `.get()` again on the nested dictionary if it exists.\n\nHere's an example of how you can handle this situation:\n\n```python\nmyDict = {'key1': {'attr1': 1, 'attr2': 2}}\n\n# Accessing a nested key safely\nouter_key = myDict.get('key1')  # First level access\nif outer_key is not None:\n    inner_value = outer_key.get('attr3')  # Second level access\nelse:\n    inner_value = None\n\nprint(inner_value)  # This will print None if 'key1' or 'attr3' doesn't exist\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use a function to make this process reusable:\n\n```python\ndef nested_get(dictionary, keys):\n    current = dictionary\n    for key in keys:\n        if isinstance(current, dict):\n            current = current.get(key)\n        else:\n            return None\n    return current\n\n# Usage\nvalue = nested_get(myDict, ['key1', 'attr3'])\nprint(value)  # This will print None if 'key1' or 'attr3' doesn't exist\n```\n\nThis function `nested_get` takes a dictionary and a list of keys, and it safely traverses through the nested dictionary structure, returning `None` if any key is not found."
