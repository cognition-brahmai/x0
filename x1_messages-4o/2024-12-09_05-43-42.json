I am writing a program that reads an Excel file and if today's date is in the Excel file's date column, I parse it. I've tried the following code:\n\n```python\ncur_date = datetime.today()\nbool_val = cur_date in df['date'] #evaluates to false\n```\nEven though today's date is in the file, it evaluates to false. I am only interested in the date and not the timestamp. I've tried to remove the timestamp with:\n\n```python\ncur_date = datetime.strptime(cur_date.strftime('%Y_%m_%d'), '%Y_%m_%d')\n```\nHowever, the comparison still fails. The dtype of the series is datetime64[ns]. How can I correctly perform this comparison?"

        "content": "To compare a `datetime` object with a Pandas DataFrame column of dtype `datetime64[ns]` and ensure that you are only comparing the date part (ignoring the time), you need to ensure that both the `datetime` object and the DataFrame column are converted to just the date. You can achieve this using the `pandas.Series.dt.date` attribute.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Sample DataFrame with a 'date' column\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'date': pd.to_datetime(['2023-10-01', '2023-10-02', '2023-10-03'])\n})\n\n# Get today's date\ncur_date = datetime.today().date()\n\n# Convert the DataFrame 'date' column to just the date\ndf['date'] = df['date'].dt.date\n\n# Check if today's date is in the 'date' column\nbool_val = cur_date in df['date'].values\n\nprint(bool_val)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Convert `cur_date` to a date**: By using `cur_date = datetime.today().date()`, we ensure that `cur_date` is of type `date`, not `datetime`.\n\n2. **Convert DataFrame column to date**: By using `df['date'] = df['date'].dt.date`, we extract only the date part from each element in the 'date' column of the DataFrame.\n\n3. **Perform the comparison**: When you use `in` to check if `cur_date` is in `df['date'].values`, it will now correctly check if today's date is present in the DataFrame column.\n\nThis approach ensures that both the `cur_date` and the DataFrame's 'date' column are in the same format, allowing for a proper comparison."
