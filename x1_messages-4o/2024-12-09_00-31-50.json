I'm building a wrapper for an in-house REST web service, and some calls need to be GET requests with parameters. I need to encode a dictionary into a query string, like \"?foo=bar&bla=blah\". The urllib2 documentation suggests that it decides whether to use POST or GET based on whether parameters are passed. However, is there a way to ensure that these parameters are included in a GET request? Additionally, is there a package that could support keep-alive, as the web server will constantly request things from the REST service, and ideally, convert the XML into a traversable Python object?"

        "content": "To make a GET request with parameters using Python's `urllib2` module, you need to manually construct the query string and append it to the URL. `urllib2` itself doesn't automatically handle query parameters for GET requests, but you can use `urllib` to encode the parameters.\n\nHere's how you can construct a GET request with parameters using `urllib` and `urllib2`:\n\n```python\nimport urllib\nimport urllib2\n\n# Your base URL\nurl = 'http://example.com/api'\n\n# Dictionary of query parameters\nparams = {\n    'foo': 'bar',\n    'bla': 'blah'\n}\n\n# Encode the parameters and append them to the URL\nquery_string = urllib.urlencode(params)\nurl_with_params = f\"{url}?{query_string}\"\n\n# Make the GET request\nrequest = urllib2.Request(url_with_params)\nresponse = urllib2.urlopen(request)\n\n# Read the response\nresponse_data = response.read()\nprint(response_data)\n```\n\nFor keep-alive support and enhanced functionality, you might want to consider using the `requests` library, which is more modern and user-friendly. It automatically handles keep-alive and provides a simple interface for making GET requests with parameters.\n\nHere's how you can achieve the same using the `requests` library:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Your base URL\nurl = 'http://example.com/api'\n\n# Dictionary of query parameters\nparams = {\n    'foo': 'bar',\n    'bla': 'blah'\n}\n\n# Make the GET request with parameters\nresponse = requests.get(url, params=params)\n\n# Read the response\nresponse_data = response.text\nprint(response_data)\n```\n\nThe `requests` library also has excellent support for handling responses and converting XML into a traversable Python object. You can use libraries like `xml.etree.ElementTree` or `lxml` to parse XML data.\n\nHere's an example of parsing XML using `ElementTree`:\n\n```python\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\n\n# Assuming 'response_data' contains the XML response as a string\nroot = ET.fromstring(response_data)\n\n# Traversing the XML\nfor child in root:\n    print(child.tag, child.attrib)\n```\n\nFor more complex XML parsing, consider using `lxml`, which provides more features and better performance."
