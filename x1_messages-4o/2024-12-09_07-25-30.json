This option allows you to specify a module path.\n   - Enter your module name in the `Module name` field. For example, if you want to run `foo.bar`, enter `foo.bar`.\n   - Ensure the `Python interpreter` is set to the correct interpreter for your project.\n   - Set the `Working directory` to the root directory of your project where the module hierarchy starts.\n\n4. **Additional Configuration (Optional)**:\n   - If you need to pass any command-line arguments to your module, you can specify them in the `Parameters` field.\n   - Adjust any environment variables or Python interpreter options as necessary in the respective fields.\n\n5. **Apply and Run**:\n   - Click `Apply` and then `OK` to save your configuration.\n   - You can now select this configuration from the run/debug dropdown menu and click the `Run` button to execute your module as `python -m foo.bar`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to run your Python entrypoint as a module directly within PyCharm, mimicking the behavior of the `python -m` command."
