If `project_id` is passed, I want to be able to use it. But right now, if I access the URL without the `project_id` parameter, I get a 404 error."

        "content": "To make the `project_id` parameter optional in your Django URL configuration, you need to modify the regular expression pattern in your URL configuration to account for the possibility of the `project_id` being absent. You can achieve this by making the `project_id` part of the regex pattern optional using a non-capturing group and a question mark (`?`) to indicate that the group is optional.\n\nHere's how you can modify your URL pattern to make `project_id` optional:\n\n```python\nfrom django.urls import path, re_path\nfrom tool.views import ProjectConfig\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    re_path(\n        r'^project_config/(?P<product>\\w+)(?:/(?P<project_id>\\w+))?/$',\n        ProjectConfig,\n        name='project_config'\n    ),\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `(?: ... )` is a non-capturing group, which allows you to group part of the regex without capturing it for back-referencing.\n- `?` after the non-capturing group `(?: ... )` makes the entire group optional.\n- `re_path` is used instead of `url` since `url` is deprecated in Django versions 2.0 and above. If you're using Django 2.0 or later, it's recommended to use `path` or `re_path`.\n\n### Adjusting the View:\n\nYou've already set `project_id` to have a default value of `None` in your `ProjectConfig` view, which is good. This means that if `project_id` is not provided, it will default to `None`, allowing your view logic to handle cases where `project_id` is not present.\n\nHere's a potential refinement, although your view is already set up correctly in terms of handling `project_id`:\n\n```python\ndef ProjectConfig(request, product, project_id=None, template_name='project.html'):\n    if project_id:\n        # Logic when project_id is present\n        pass\n    else:\n        # Logic when project_id is not present\n        pass\n    # Common logic\n    ...\n```\n\nWith this setup, both `/project_config/<product>/` and `/project_config/<product>/<project_id>/` should be valid and handled appropriately by your view."
