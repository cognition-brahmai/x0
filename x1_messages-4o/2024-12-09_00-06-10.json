Here's a simple and delicious recipe for a Berry Banana Fruit Salad:\n\n**Berry Banana Fruit Salad**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 2 ripe bananas, sliced\n- 1 cup strawberries, hulled and sliced\n- 1 cup raspberries\n- 1 cup blueberries\n\n**Optional Dressing:**\n- 1 tablespoon honey or agave syrup\n- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon or lime juice\n- A few fresh mint leaves for garnish (optional)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Fruit:**\n   - Begin by washing all the berries thoroughly under cold running water. Pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels.\n   - Hull and slice the strawberries.\n   - Slice the bananas just before assembling the salad to prevent them from browning.\n\n2. **Make the Dressing:**\n   - In a small bowl, whisk together the honey (or agave syrup) and lemon (or lime) juice until well combined. This dressing will add a touch of sweetness and a hint of tanginess to the fruit salad.\n\n3. **Assemble the Salad:**\n   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced bananas, strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries.\n   - Drizzle the honey-citrus dressing over the fruit. Gently toss the ingredients together using a spatula or large spoon, ensuring the dressing lightly coats the fruit without mashing it.\n\n4. **Serve:**\n   - Transfer the fruit salad to a serving bowl or individual dessert cups.\n   - Garnish with a few fresh mint leaves for a pop of color and added freshness, if desired.\n\n5. **Enjoy:**\n   - Serve immediately to enjoy the fruit at its freshest. This salad is perfect as a healthy snack, a light dessert, or a refreshing side dish.\n\nFeel free to adjust the quantities or add other fruits like kiwi or grapes to suit your taste preferences. Enjoy your delicious and refreshing Berry Banana Fruit Salad!"
