For example, 20:11:13 % (10 seconds) would yield 3 seconds and 20:11:13 % (10 minutes) would yield 1 minute and 13 seconds. What would be an elegant, efficient, and Pythonic way to achieve this? The relevant time-related types I am considering are datetime.datetime, datetime.time, and struct_time."

        "content": "To perform a rounding operation on time-related types in Python with control over the rounding resolution, you can use a combination of Python's `datetime` module and some basic arithmetic operations. Here's a general approach that you can adapt for different time-related types like `datetime.datetime`, `datetime.time`, and `time.struct_time`.\n\n### For `datetime.datetime` and `datetime.time`\n\nYou can create a function that takes a `datetime.datetime` or `datetime.time` object and a resolution in seconds, then performs the modulo operation to get the remainder. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\ndef round_time(dt, resolution):\n    \"\"\"Rounds a datetime or time object to the nearest resolution.\"\"\"\n    if isinstance(dt, datetime):\n        total_seconds = dt.hour * 3600 + dt.minute * 60 + dt.second\n    else:\n        total_seconds = dt.hour * 3600 + dt.minute * 60 + dt.second\n\n    remainder = total_seconds % resolution\n    return timedelta(seconds=remainder)\n\n# Example usage:\ndt = datetime(2023, 10, 3, 20, 11, 13)\nresolution_seconds = 10\nremainder = round_time(dt, resolution_seconds)\nprint(f\"Remainder for 10 seconds resolution: {remainder}\") # Output: 0:00:03\n\nresolution_seconds = 600  # 10 minutes\nremainder = round_time(dt, resolution_seconds)\nprint(f\"Remainder for 10 minutes resolution: {remainder}\") # Output: 0:01:13\n```\n\n### For `time.struct_time`\n\nIf you're dealing with `time.struct_time`, you can convert it to seconds since epoch, perform the modulo operation, and then convert it back if needed:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef round_struct_time(t, resolution):\n    \"\"\"Rounds a struct_time object to the nearest resolution.\"\"\"\n    total_seconds = t.tm_hour * 3600 + t.tm_min * 60 + t.tm_sec\n    remainder = total_seconds % resolution\n    return remainder\n\n# Example usage:\nt = time.struct_time((2023, 10, 3, 20, 11, 13, 0, 0, -1))\nresolution_seconds = 10\nremainder = round_struct_time(t, resolution_seconds)\nprint(f\"Remainder for 10 seconds resolution: {remainder} seconds\")  # Output: 3 seconds\n\nresolution_seconds = 600  # 10 minutes\nremainder = round_struct_time(t, resolution_seconds)\nprint(f\"Remainder for 10 minutes resolution: {remainder} seconds\")  # Output: 73 seconds\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Total Seconds Calculation**: Convert the time into total seconds for easier modulo operations.\n2. **Modulo Operation**: Use the modulo operator to find the remainder when dividing by the resolution.\n3. **Return Remainder**: The remainder will give you the leftover time that does not fit into the given resolution.\n\nThis approach is efficient and Pythonic, leveraging the capabilities of the `datetime` module and simple arithmetic. You can further extend this function to handle more complex scenarios or different input types as needed."
