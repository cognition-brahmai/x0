You can use the `iloc` indexer, which allows you to select rows and columns by position. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nlast_column = df.iloc[:, -1]\n```\n\nThis will select all rows (`:`) and the last column (`-1`) of the DataFrame `df`. Using `iloc` is not only more concise but also efficient for this purpose."
