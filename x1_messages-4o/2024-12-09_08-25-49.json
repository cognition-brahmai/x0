I have a canonical file structure as shown below:\n\n```\nmainpack/\n\n  __main__.py\n  __init__.py \n\n  - helpers/\n     __init__.py\n     path.py\n\n  - network/\n     __init__.py\n     clientlib.py\n     server.py\n\n  - gui/\n     __init__.py\n     mainwindow.py\n     controllers.py\n```\n\nIn this structure, modules in each package may want to access the `helpers` utilities through relative imports such as:\n\n```python\n# network/clientlib.py\nfrom ..helpers.path import create_dir\n```\n\nThe program is run \"as a script\" using the `__main__.py` file like this:\n\n```bash\npython mainpack/\n```\n\nFollowing PEP 366, I've put these lines in `__main__.py`:\n\n```python\n___package___ = \"mainpack\"\nfrom .network.clientlib import helloclient \n```\n\nBut when I try to run it, I get this error:\n\n```bash\n$ python mainpack \nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.6/runpy.py\", line 122, in _run_module_as_main\n    \"__main__\", fname, loader, pkg_name)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.6/runpy.py\", line 34, in _run_code\n    exec code in run_globals\n  File \"path/mainpack/__main__.py\", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;\n    from .network.clientlib import helloclient\nSystemError: Parent module 'mainpack' not loaded, cannot perform relative import\n```\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? What is the correct way to handle and effectively use relative imports? I have also tried to add the current directory to the PYTHONPATH but nothing changes."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the way Python handles relative imports when running a module as a script. PEP 366 provides a way to handle relative imports when a module within a package is executed directly, but it requires some additional setup.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what you need to do:\n\n### 1. Running the Package\n\nWhen you run `python mainpack/`, Python is looking for a `__main__.py` file in the `mainpack` directory, which is correct. However, the issue arises from the relative import in `__main__.py`. To allow relative imports to work when executing `__main__.py`, you can use the `-m` option to run the module as a package:\n\n```bash\npython -m mainpack\n```\n\nThis tells Python to treat `mainpack` as a package, allowing relative imports to work correctly.\n\n### 2. Modifying `__main__.py`\n\nYou should remove the `___package___` line and use absolute imports instead. The `__package__` attribute is automatically set when using the `-m` option, so you don\u2019t need to manually set it. Let's adjust your `__main__.py`:\n\n```python\n# __main__.py\nfrom mainpack.network.clientlib import helloclient\n\ndef main():\n    helloclient()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### 3. Using Absolute Imports\n\nIn Python, it's generally a good practice to use absolute imports, especially when dealing with larger projects. Update your import statements in the other modules accordingly. For example, in `network/clientlib.py`, you should use:\n\n```python\nfrom mainpack.helpers.path import create_dir\n```\n\n### 4. Running the Script\n\nWith the changes above, you should be able to run your package using:\n\n```bash\npython -m mainpack\n```\n\nThis approach should resolve the `SystemError` you are encountering and allow your relative imports to work as intended. By running the package with `-m`, Python sets up the module's package context correctly, enabling relative imports to function."
