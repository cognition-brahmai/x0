Open your Python interpreter or a Python script file.\n2. Import the NumPy library.\n3. Use the `__version__` attribute to print the version.\n\nHere is a sample code snippet:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nprint(np.__version__)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the version of NumPy that is currently installed in your environment."
