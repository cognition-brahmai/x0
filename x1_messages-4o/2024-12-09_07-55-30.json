The bot seems to run without any exceptions, and I can successfully call the debug output in `on_message()`. However, for some reason, I can't call any of the other commands. Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport discord\nimport asyncio\nfrom discord.ext import commands\n\nbot = commands.Bot(command_prefix = '-')\n@bot.event\nasync def on_ready():\n    print('Logged in as')\n    print(bot.user.name)\n    print(bot.user.id)\n    print('------')\n\n@bot.event\nasync def on_message(message):\n    if message.content.startswith('-debug'):\n        await message.channel.send('d')\n\n@bot.command(pass_context=True)\nasync def ping(ctx):\n    await ctx.channel.send('Pong!')\n\n@bot.command(pass_context=True)\nasync def add(ctx, *, arg):\n    await ctx.send(arg)\n```"
    },

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that the `on_message()` event is overriding the default command processing. When you define an `on_message()` event, it intercepts all messages that the bot can see, preventing the `commands.Bot` from automatically processing commands.\n\nTo fix this, you need to explicitly tell your bot to process commands after handling the message in `on_message()`. This can be done by adding `await bot.process_commands(message)` at the end of your `on_message()` function. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport discord\nfrom discord.ext import commands\n\nbot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='-')\n\n@bot.event\nasync def on_ready():\n    print('Logged in as')\n    print(bot.user.name)\n    print(bot.user.id)\n    print('------')\n\n@bot.event\nasync def on_message(message):\n    if message.content.startswith('-debug'):\n        await message.channel.send('d')\n    # Ensure other commands are processed\n    await bot.process_commands(message)\n\n@bot.command()\nasync def ping(ctx):\n    await ctx.send('Pong!')\n\n@bot.command()\nasync def add(ctx, *, arg):\n    await ctx.send(arg)\n\n# Remember to add your bot token \n# bot.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')\n```\n\nIn this updated code, `await bot.process_commands(message)` ensures that any commands that are not handled by your custom logic in `on_message()` are still processed by the default command handler. This should allow your `ping` and `add` commands to work as expected."
