For example, with the following code: \n```python\nlist = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"]\nprint(list[3]) # Number 3 is \"d\"\nprint(list[-4]) # Number -4 is \"a\"\n```\nWhy does the index -4 refer to \"a\" and not \"d\" as it would if indexing from the start of the list?"

        "content": "In Python, when you're indexing from the end of a list, negative indices are used. The negative index starts from `-1`, which corresponds to the last element of the list. This is a design choice in Python to provide a convenient way to access elements from the end of a list without having to calculate the length of the list.\n\nHere's how negative indexing works:\n\n- `-1` refers to the last element.\n- `-2` refers to the second to last element.\n- `-3` refers to the third to last element.\n- And so on.\n\nIn your example:\n\n- `list[3]` accesses the fourth element from the start, which is `\"d\"`.\n- `list[-1]` would access the last element, which is `\"d\"`.\n- `list[-2]` would access the second to last element, which is `\"c\"`.\n- `list[-3]` would access the third to last element, which is `\"b\"`.\n- `list[-4]` would access the fourth to last element, which is `\"a\"`.\n\nSo, when you use `list[-4]`, you're accessing the first element from the start because it's the fourth element from the end. Negative indices provide a way to count backwards from the end of the list, making it easy to access elements relative to the list's end."
