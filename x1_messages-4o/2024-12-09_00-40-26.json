An error message keeps appearing stating \"ImproperlyConfigured: Requested setting USE_I18N, but settings are not configured. You must either define the environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE or call settings.configure() before accessing settings.\" I'm not sure how to resolve this. The error traceback, my wsgi.py file, and manage.py file are provided for reference. Can anyone identify the problem and guide me on how to fix it?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that Django is trying to access the settings before they have been properly configured. This is usually due to the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable not being set correctly. Here are some steps you can follow to resolve the issue:\n\n### Check `manage.py`\nEnsure that your `manage.py` file is setting the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` correctly. It should look something like this:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project_name.settings')\n    try:\n        from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line\n    except ImportError as exc:\n        raise ImportError(\n            \"Couldn't import Django. Are you sure it's installed and available on your PYTHONPATH environment variable? Did you forget to activate a virtual environment?\"\n        ) from exc\n    execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Check `wsgi.py`\nEnsure that your `wsgi.py` file is also setting the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` correctly. It should look something like this:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nfrom django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application\n\nos.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project_name.settings')\n\napplication = get_wsgi_application()\n```\n\nReplace `'your_project_name.settings'` with the actual path to your settings module.\n\n### Heroku Configuration\nOn Heroku, you need to ensure that the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable is set. You can set environment variables in Heroku using the following command:\n\n```bash\nheroku config:set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=your_project_name.settings\n```\n\nEnsure that you replace `your_project_name.settings` with the correct path to your settings module.\n\n### Additional Checks\n- Ensure your `settings.py` file is correctly named and located in the correct directory.\n- Make sure you are activating the virtual environment where Django is installed before running any management commands.\n\n### Debugging Tips\n- Double-check that Heroku is using the correct Python runtime and that all dependencies are listed in your `requirements.txt`.\n- If you have multiple settings files (e.g., for different environments like development and production), ensure that the correct one is being referenced.\n\nAfter making these changes, redeploy your application to Heroku and see if the error persists. If you continue to experience issues, consider adding more details about your setup for further troubleshooting."
