I have noticed that Python adds an 'L' to the end of large exponent results, as shown in this example:\n\n```python\n>>> 25 ** 25\n88817841970012523233890533447265625L\n```\nHowever, after some tests, I found that any number below 10 doesn't include the 'L'. For example:\n\n```python\n>>> 9 ** 9\n387420489\n```\nWhy does this happen and is there any method to prevent it?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is specific to older versions of Python, specifically Python 2.x. In Python 2, there were two types of integers: `int` and `long`. The `int` type was typically used for smaller numbers, and the `long` type was used for larger numbers. When a number was too large to be represented as an `int`, Python would automatically use a `long`, and this was denoted by appending an `L` to the end of the number.\n\nIn your example:\n\n```python\n>>> 25 ** 25\n88817841970012523233890533447265625L\n```\n\nThe `L` indicates that the result is a `long` integer. However, for smaller numbers like `9 ** 9`, the result can still be represented as an `int`, so no `L` is appended.\n\nIn Python 3, this distinction between `int` and `long` has been removed. All integers are of type `int`, and they can grow as large as the memory allows without needing a separate type. Therefore, in Python 3, you won't see the `L` suffix anymore.\n\nIf you're using Python 2 and want to avoid the `L` suffix, you can convert the result to a string and then remove the `L`:\n\n```python\nresult = 25 ** 25\nresult_str = str(result).rstrip('L')\n```\n\nHowever, it's generally recommended to upgrade to Python 3, where this issue is naturally resolved and you get the benefit of many other improvements in the language."
