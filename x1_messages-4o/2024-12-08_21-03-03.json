Here is the code to convert pounds to kilograms and calculate the total weight lifted:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n\tweightLifted := 200 // in pounds\n\trepetitions := 10\n\n\t// Convert pounds to kilograms\n\tweightKg := float64(weightLifted) * 0.453592\n\n\t// Calculate total weight lifted in kg\n\ttotalWeightKg := weightKg * float64(repetitions)\n\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Total weight lifted: %.2f kg\\n\", totalWeightKg)\n}\n```\n\nYou can modify the `weightLifted` and `repetitions` variables to reflect the specific task you are calculating for. This code will output the total weight lifted in kilograms."
