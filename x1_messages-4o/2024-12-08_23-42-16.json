Below is a modified R code using the `rvest` package to scrape data and generate a list of cutting-edge technologies in AI, specifically in the field of computer vision. This example will demonstrate how you might scrape data from a website like IEEE or ACM Digital Library. Note that actual URLs and selectors need to be tailored to the specific website structure, which may require manual exploration of the website's HTML.\n\nPlease ensure you have the necessary permissions to scrape data from the website you target, as some sites may restrict this activity.\n\n```r\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# URL of the website to scrape (placeholder URL)\nurl <- 'https://example.com/computer-vision-technologies'\n\n# Read the HTML content from the website\nwebpage <- read_html(url)\n\n# Extract data based on the website's structure\n# The following is a placeholder for selectors. You'll need to adjust these.\ntitles <- webpage %>% html_nodes('.title-class') %>% html_text()\ndescriptions <- webpage %>% html_nodes('.description-class') %>% html_text()\napplications <- webpage %>% html_nodes('.applications-class') %>% html_text()\nlimitations <- webpage %>% html_nodes('.limitations-class') %>% html_text()\n\n# Combine the extracted data into a data frame\ntechnologies <- data.frame(\n  Technology = titles,\n  Description = descriptions,\n  Applications = applications,\n  Limitations = limitations,\n  stringsAsFactors = FALSE\n)\n\n# Display the top 5 cutting-edge technologies in computer vision\ntop_5_technologies <- head(technologies, 5)\n\nprint(top_5_technologies)\n```\n\n### Note:\n1. **URL**: Replace `'https://example.com/computer-vision-technologies'` with the actual URL of the page you want to scrape.\n2. **CSS Selectors**: The `.title-class`, `.description-class`, `.applications-class`, and `.limitations-class` are placeholders. You need to inspect the webpage (right-click on the page > Inspect) to find the correct CSS selectors for the elements you wish to extract.\n3. **Permissions**: Ensure you have permission to scrape the website, as per its `robots.txt` file or terms of service.\n\nThis code provides a framework. You'll need to adapt it to the specific website you're targeting, including identifying the correct nodes to scrape and handling any potential pagination or dynamic content loading."
