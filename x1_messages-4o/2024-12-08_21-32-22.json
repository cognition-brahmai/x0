Provide an example code snippet and explain how it relates to the following quote: \"Whether you think you can or you think you can't, you're right.\" - Henry Ford\n[PHP code]\n$targetValue = 42;\n$currentValue = 0;\n$values = array();\nwhile ($currentValue != $targetValue) {\n    array_push($values, $currentValue);\n    if ($currentValue < $targetValue) {\n        $currentValue += 5;\n    } else {\n        $currentValue -= 3;\n    }\n}\necho \"Values: \";\nforeach ($values as $value) {\n    echo $value . \", \";\n}\necho $targetValue;\nIn this PHP code snippet, we use an array to keep track of all the values that are generated before the target value is reached. This relates to the concept of self-fulfilling prophecies in that the program will continue to generate values until it reaches the desired outcome, just as a person's mindset can affect their actions and ultimately lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy. The Henry Ford quote emphasizes the power of one's thoughts and beliefs in determining their success or failure, which can be applied to programming and problem-solving as well."

        "content": "In the provided PHP code snippet, we see the concept of a self-fulfilling prophecy in action through the use of a loop that manipulates the `$currentValue` variable until it matches the `$targetValue`. The array `$values` keeps track of each step taken during this journey, illustrating how the program persistently works towards achieving the target value, mirroring how beliefs and actions can align to fulfill a self-predicted outcome.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the code snippet works:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `$targetValue` is set to 42, which is the goal the program aims to achieve.\n   - `$currentValue` starts at 0, indicating the starting point.\n   - `$values` is an array initialized to keep track of all intermediary values.\n\n2. **While Loop**:\n   - The loop continues as long as `$currentValue` is not equal to `$targetValue`.\n   - In each iteration, the current value is added to the `$values` array using `array_push()`.\n\n3. **Conditionals**:\n   - If `$currentValue` is less than `$targetValue`, it increases by 5.\n   - If `$currentValue` is greater than `$targetValue`, it decreases by 3.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - After the loop completes, the program outputs all values stored in the `$values` array, followed by the target value.\n\n**Connection to Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**:\n- The Henry Ford quote, \"Whether you think you can or you think you can't, you're right,\" highlights the influence of mindset on outcomes. The code's logic determines the path toward the target value, similar to how one's beliefs can guide actions toward achieving a goal.\n- The loop represents persistence and iterative progress, akin to maintaining a positive mindset. Each decision within the loop (incrementing or decrementing) reflects adjustments made to keep moving toward the desired outcome, embodying how actions influenced by belief can ultimately fulfill a prophecy.\n\nBy drawing this parallel, the code serves as an allegory for the power of determination and belief in achieving goals, just as a self-fulfilling prophecy does in real-life scenarios."
