        "content": "Yes, in Jinja2, you can format decimal numbers directly within your templates using filters. While there is no built-in method exactly like `strftime()` for numbers, you can use the `format` filter to achieve similar results.\n\nHere's how you can format decimal numbers using the `format` filter in Jinja2:\n\n```jinja\n{{ some_number | format('0.2f') }}\n```\n\nIn this example, `some_number` is the variable you want to format, and `'0.2f'` specifies that you want to format the number as a floating-point number with two decimal places. You can adjust the format string to suit your needs.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the format string `'0.2f'`:\n\n- `0` indicates that the number should be padded with zeros if it's shorter than the specified width (in this case, the width is implicitly determined by the number of decimal places).\n- `.2` specifies the number of decimal places to display.\n- `f` indicates that the number should be formatted as a floating-point number.\n\nYou can modify the format string to achieve different results, such as displaying more or fewer decimal places, adding commas, etc. If you have specific formatting needs, you can refer to Python's string formatting documentation, as Jinja2's `format` filter is based on Python's string formatting capabilities."
