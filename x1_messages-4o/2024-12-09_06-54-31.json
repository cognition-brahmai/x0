My HTML code includes the img tag with the source as \"ayrton_senna_movie_wallpaper_by_bashgfx-d4cm6x6.jpg\". In my Python code, I'm using the route '/index' to return the 'index.html' file. Where does Flask look for these image files?"

        "content": "In Flask, static files such as images, CSS, and JavaScript are typically served from a directory named `static`. By default, Flask looks for a folder named `static` in the root directory of your project. To properly reference an image file in your HTML, you need to place the image inside the `static` directory and use the `url_for` function to generate the correct URL path.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can set it up:\n\n1. **Project Structure**:\n    ```\n    your_project/\n    \u2502\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 app.py           # Your Flask app\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 templates/\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.html   # Your HTML file\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 static/\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 images/\n            \u2514\u2500\u2500 ayrton_senna_movie_wallpaper_by_bashgfx-d4cm6x6.jpg\n    ```\n\n2. **Flask Code (app.py)**:\n    Ensure your Flask app is routing to the `index.html` correctly.\n    ```python\n    from flask import Flask, render_template\n\n    app = Flask(__name__)\n\n    @app.route('/index')\n    def index():\n        return render_template('index.html')\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        app.run(debug=True)\n    ```\n\n3. **HTML Code (index.html)**:\n    Use the `url_for` function to correctly link to the image in the `static` directory.\n    ```html\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n        <title>Index Page</title>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <h1>Welcome to the Index Page</h1>\n        <img src=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='images/ayrton_senna_movie_wallpaper_by_bashgfx-d4cm6x6.jpg') }}\" alt=\"Ayrton Senna\">\n    </body>\n    </html>\n    ```\n\nBy organizing your files in this way and using `url_for`, you ensure Flask can find and serve your static files correctly. Make sure the `static` directory is at the same level as your Flask app (`app.py`) and that the image path in your HTML matches the actual path in the `static` directory."
