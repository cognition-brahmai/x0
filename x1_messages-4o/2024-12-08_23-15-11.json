Here's a general outline of how you might design such a program:\n\n### Step 1: Data Collection\nCollect a large dataset of news articles that are already labeled with categories. This data will be used to train the model. Each article should have a label indicating whether it belongs to sports, politics, entertainment, or economy.\n\n### Step 2: Preprocessing\nPrepare your data for analysis:\n- **Tokenization**: Split the text into words or tokens.\n- **Stop Word Removal**: Remove common words that don't add much meaning (e.g., \"and\", \"the\").\n- **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their base or root form.\n- **Vectorization**: Convert text into numerical format using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings like Word2Vec or BERT.\n\n### Step 3: Model Selection\nChoose a machine learning model suitable for text classification. Common models include:\n- Naive Bayes\n- Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n- Random Forest\n- Neural Networks (e.g., LSTM, CNN)\n- Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT)\n\n### Step 4: Training\nSplit your dataset into training and testing sets. Train your selected model on the training data.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluation\nEvaluate your model's performance using the testing data. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n\n### Step 6: Prediction\nOnce the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to classify new pieces of news.\n\n### Sample Code\nHere's a simple example using Python and the scikit-learn library:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\n\n# Sample data\ndata = [\n    (\"Italy's Richest Man, Count Giulio Zanda, Dies at Age 85\", \"economy\"),\n    # Add more labeled news samples here\n]\n\n# Extract features and labels\ntexts, labels = zip(*data)\n\n# Split data into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(texts, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Create a pipeline with a TfidfVectorizer and a Naive Bayes classifier\nmodel = make_pipeline(TfidfVectorizer(), MultinomialNB())\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Predict categories for the test set\npredicted_labels = model.predict(X_test)\n\n# Evaluate the model\nprint(classification_report(y_test, predicted_labels))\n\n# Classify a new piece of news\nnew_article = [\"Italy's Richest Man, Count Giulio Zanda, Dies at Age 85\"]\npredicted_category = model.predict(new_article)\nprint(f\"Predicted category: {predicted_category[0]}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, we used a Naive Bayes model with TF-IDF vectorization, but you can experiment with other models and techniques to improve performance. The prediction of the category for the sample news article would likely be \"economy,\" considering its content about wealth and a prominent individual in economic context."
