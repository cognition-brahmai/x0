How can I replace each of the words that begin with '@' with the output of a function that takes the word as an argument? I tried to do it with the following code but I'm not getting the desired output. Is there a clever way to do this?\n\n```python\ndef my_replace(match):\n    return match + str(match.index('e'))\n\n#Psuedo-code\n\nstring = \"The quick @red fox jumps over the @lame brown dog.\"\nstring.replace('@%match', my_replace(match))\n\n# Result\n\"The quick @red2 fox jumps over the @lame4 brown dog.\"\n```"

        "content": "To achieve the desired functionality, you can use regular expressions with the `re` module in Python. You'll want to find all words that start with '@', and then replace each of them using a function. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef my_replace(match):\n    # Get the matched word\n    word = match.group(0)\n    # Perform the replacement logic, for example, add the index of 'e'\n    return word + str(word.index('e'))\n\nstring = \"The quick @red fox jumps over the @lame brown dog.\"\n\n# Use re.sub with a regular expression to find words starting with '@'\nresult = re.sub(r'@\\w+', my_replace, string)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `re.sub` is used to substitute matches found by the regex pattern with the output of a function.\n- `r'@\\w+'` is the regular expression pattern that matches words starting with '@'. Here, `\\w+` matches one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores).\n- `my_replace` is a function that processes each match. It receives a match object, from which you can get the matched string using `match.group(0)`.\n- This example assumes you're adding the index of 'e' to the matched word. Adjust the logic in `my_replace` as needed for your specific use case."
