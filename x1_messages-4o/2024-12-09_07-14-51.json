        "content": "I am trying to understand the Python `hash` function and how it works with Python dictionaries. I created a custom class where all instances return the same hash value and expected that only one instance of this class can be in a `dict` at any time. However, I found that a `dict` can have multiple elements with the same hash. I also experimented by overriding the `__eq__` method so that all the instances of the class compare equal, and in this case, the `dict` only allows one instance. Could someone explain how a `dict` can have multiple elements with the same hash?\n\n```python\nclass C:\n    def __hash__(self):\n        return 42\n\nc, d = C(), C()\nx = {c: 'c', d: 'd'}\nprint(x)\n# {<__main__.C object at 0x7f0824087b80>: 'c', <__main__.C object at 0x7f0823ae2d60>: 'd'}\n# note that the dict has 2 elements\n\nclass D:\n    def __hash__(self):\n        return 42\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return True\n\np, q = D(), D()\ny = {p: 'p', q: 'q'}\nprint(y)\n# {<__main__.D object at 0x7f0823a9af40>: 'q'}\n# note that the dict only has 1 element\n```"

        "content": "To understand the behavior you're observing, it's important to delve into how Python dictionaries handle keys. In Python, a dictionary uses a combination of hash values and equality checks to manage its keys. Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Hash Values:** When you add a key to a dictionary, Python first computes the hash value of the key using the `__hash__` method. This hash value is used to determine the bucket location in the dictionary's array-based structure. However, hash collisions can occur, meaning different keys can have the same hash value.\n\n2. **Handling Hash Collisions:** When a hash collision occurs (two keys have the same hash value), Python uses the `__eq__` method to determine if the keys are actually the same. If two keys compare equal (i.e., `key1 == key2` returns `True`), the dictionary considers them the same and updates the value of the existing key. If they are not equal, both keys are stored in the dictionary despite having the same hash value.\n\n3. **Your Example with Class `C`:** \n   - Both instances `c` and `d` return the same hash value (`42`), so they are placed in the same bucket.\n   - However, since you did not override `__eq__`, the default object identity comparison is used (`c is d`), which returns `False` because `c` and `d` are different objects. Therefore, both instances are stored in the dictionary as separate keys.\n\n4. **Your Example with Class `D`:**\n   - Again, both instances `p` and `q` return the same hash value (`42`).\n   - This time, you have overridden `__eq__` to always return `True`, indicating that any two instances of `D` should be considered equal.\n   - Since `p == q` returns `True`, when you attempt to add `q` to the dictionary, it finds that `p` already exists as an equivalent key, and thus it updates the value associated with `p` to `'q'`. Therefore, only one key-value pair (`p: 'q'`) remains.\n\nIn summary, a dictionary can have multiple elements with the same hash value if they are not considered equal by the `__eq__` method. If `__eq__` indicates that they are equal, only one key-value pair will be retained, with the latest value overwriting the previous one."
