I have a script that copies files to another location and I want to move this process to a separate thread so I can output '....' to indicate the script is still running. The issue is that if the files can't be copied, it throws an exception. This works fine in the main thread but not when using the following code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    threadClass = TheThread(param1, param2, etc.)\n    threadClass.start()   ##### **Exception takes place here**\nexcept:\n    print \"Caught an exception\"\n```\nIn the thread class, I tried to re-throw the exception, but it does not work. The thread class code is:\n\n```python\nclass TheThread(threading.Thread):\n    def __init__(self, sourceFolder, destFolder):\n        threading.Thread.__init__(self)\n        self.sourceFolder = sourceFolder\n        self.destFolder = destFolder\n    \n    def run(self):\n        try:\n           shul.copytree(self.sourceFolder, self.destFolder)\n        except:\n           raise\n```\n\nI've seen suggestions to use `sys.exc_info()`, but I don't know where or how to use it. How can I catch a thread's exception in the caller thread?"

        "content": "Handling exceptions in a separate thread can indeed be tricky, because exceptions raised in a thread don't propagate back to the main thread. However, you can capture the exception in the thread and then communicate it back to the main thread in a controlled manner.\n\nHere's a way to achieve that by storing the exception information in an instance variable within the thread class and then checking for it after the thread finishes:\n\n```python\nimport threading\nimport shutil  # Make sure to use the correct import for copying\nimport sys\nimport traceback\n\nclass TheThread(threading.Thread):\n    def __init__(self, sourceFolder, destFolder):\n        threading.Thread.__init__(self)\n        self.sourceFolder = sourceFolder\n        self.destFolder = destFolder\n        self.exception = None  # To store exception info\n\n    def run(self):\n        try:\n            shutil.copytree(self.sourceFolder, self.destFolder)\n        except Exception as e:\n            # Capture the exception and traceback\n            self.exception = (e, traceback.format_exc())\n\n# Usage\nsource = 'path/to/source'\ndestination = 'path/to/destination'\n\nthreadClass = TheThread(source, destination)\nthreadClass.start()\nthreadClass.join()  # Wait for the thread to finish\n\nif threadClass.exception:\n    # Unpack and handle the exception\n    exception, traceback_str = threadClass.exception\n    print(\"Caught an exception in the thread:\")\n    print(traceback_str)\nelse:\n    print(\"Files copied successfully.\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Thread Synchronization**: Use `threadClass.join()` to wait for the thread to complete before checking for exceptions.\n\n2. **Exception Handling**: In the `run` method, capture the exception and traceback using `traceback.format_exc()` to get a detailed traceback as a string. This allows you to print or log detailed error information.\n\n3. **Communication**: By storing the exception information in an instance variable, you can communicate it back to the main thread safely.\n\n4. **Traceback**: Using `traceback.format_exc()` helps in getting a human-readable traceback that can be printed or logged, which is especially useful for debugging.\n\nBy following this approach, you can effectively handle exceptions in multi-threaded applications and ensure that any issues occurring in a separate thread are communicated back to the main thread."
