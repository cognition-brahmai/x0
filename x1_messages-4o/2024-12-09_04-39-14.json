Most of the errors I'm encountering are apiclient.errors.HttpError with different strings attached, like the following examples:\n\n<HttpError 409 when requesting https://www.googleapis.com/bigquery/v2/projects/some_id/datasets/some_dataset/tables?alt=json returned \"Already Exists: Table some_id:some_dataset.some_table\">\n\n<HttpError 404 when requesting https://www.googleapis.com/bigquery/v2/projects/some_id/jobs/sdfgsdfg?alt=json returned \"Not Found: Job some_id:sdfgsdfg\">\n\nCurrently, I'm using regex to handle these errors which feels messy and not ideal. Is there a more efficient way to manage these errors?"

        "content": "Handling Google API errors, particularly `HttpError` from the Google API Client in Python, can indeed be cumbersome if you're relying solely on regex to parse error messages. A more efficient and structured way to handle these errors involves using exception handling to catch specific error codes and act accordingly. Here's a streamlined approach to manage errors without relying on regex:\n\n1. **Use Try-Except Blocks**: You can use try-except blocks to catch `HttpError` exceptions specifically and then examine their status codes and content. This way, you can handle different errors based on their HTTP status codes (like 404, 409, etc.).\n\n2. **Access HttpError Attributes**: Instead of using regex, access the attributes of the `HttpError` object to get more structured information. The `HttpError` object contains a `resp` attribute that includes the status code and a `content` attribute that includes the error message.\n\nHere is a sample code snippet demonstrating this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom googleapiclient.errors import HttpError\n\ndef handle_bigquery_operation():\n    try:\n        # Your BigQuery operation here\n        pass\n    except HttpError as err:\n        status_code = err.resp.status\n        error_message = err.content.decode('utf-8')\n        \n        if status_code == 409:\n            print(f\"Conflict error: {error_message}\")\n            # Handle table already exists scenario\n        elif status_code == 404:\n            print(f\"Not found error: {error_message}\")\n            # Handle resource not found scenario\n        else:\n            print(f\"Unhandled HTTP error {status_code}: {error_message}\")\n            # Handle other unexpected errors\n\n# Example usage\nhandle_bigquery_operation()\n```\n\n3. **Consider Using Google Cloud Client Libraries**: If you are not already using them, consider switching to the Google Cloud Client Libraries for Python. These libraries are designed to simplify interactions with Google Cloud services, including error handling. They provide more Pythonic interfaces and often better error handling mechanisms than the underlying API client.\n\nUsing this structured approach can help you manage errors more effectively and reduce the reliance on regex parsing, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain."
