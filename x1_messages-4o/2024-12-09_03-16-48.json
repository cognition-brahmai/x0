I tried to install these via Pip but encountered several errors, including LNK2019, LNK1120, and a range of C errors (C2065, C2054, C2085, C2143 etc). Furthermore, I'm getting a fatal error LNK1120 associated with numpy.linalg.lapack_lite.pyd. I've also installed Fortran via MinGW/MSYS as SciPy complained about missing a Fortran compiler. What could be the correct way to install these libraries?"

        "content": "Installing 64-bit versions of NumPy and SciPy on a Windows machine can sometimes be tricky due to dependency and compiler issues. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you install these libraries smoothly:\n\n### Method 1: Using Pre-built Binaries\n\n1. **Uninstall Existing Packages:**\n   - First, ensure that you uninstall any existing installations of NumPy and SciPy to avoid conflicts.\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall numpy scipy\n   ```\n\n2. **Download Pre-built Binaries:**\n   - Go to [Christoph Gohlke\u2019s Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) and download the 64-bit wheel files for NumPy and SciPy that match your Python version.\n\n3. **Install the .whl Files:**\n   - Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the files and install them using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install numpy\u2011<version>\u2011cp<python-version>\u2011cp<python-version>\u2011win_amd64.whl\n   pip install scipy\u2011<version>\u2011cp<python-version>\u2011cp<python-version>\u2011win_amd64.whl\n   ```\n\n### Method 2: Using Anaconda\n\nIf you haven't already, you might consider using Anaconda, which simplifies installations of scientific packages on Windows:\n\n1. **Download and Install Anaconda:**\n   - Download and install Anaconda from [Anaconda\u2019s website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).\n\n2. **Create a New Environment:**\n   - Open Anaconda Prompt and create a new environment:\n   ```bash\n   conda create -n myenv python=3.x\n   ```\n\n3. **Activate the Environment:**\n   ```bash\n   conda activate myenv\n   ```\n\n4. **Install NumPy and SciPy:**\n   ```bash\n   conda install numpy scipy\n   ```\n\n### Method 3: Using Pip with a Suitable Compiler\n\nIf you prefer using pip, ensure you have a suitable compiler set up:\n\n1. **Install Microsoft Build Tools:**\n   - Download and install the [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).\n\n2. **Set Up Environment Variables:**\n   - Ensure that your environment variables are set correctly for the compiler to be recognized.\n\n3. **Install NumPy and SciPy:**\n   - Now try installing NumPy and SciPy using pip again:\n   ```bash\n   pip install numpy\n   pip install scipy\n   ```\n\n### General Tips\n\n- **Ensure Compatibility:** Make sure that the Python version, the NumPy, and SciPy versions are compatible.\n- **Update Pip:** Ensure that you are using the latest version of pip:\n  ```bash\n  python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n  ```\n- **Check Python Version:** Ensure you are using a 64-bit version of Python. You can check this by running:\n  ```bash\n  python -c \"import struct; print(struct.calcsize('P') * 8)\"\n  ```\n\nBy following one of these methods, you should be able to successfully install 64-bit versions of NumPy and SciPy on your Windows machine."
