These probabilities can be based on prior experience, experimental data, or assumptions.\n\n2. **Calculate the Combined Probability of Failure**: For each liquid, calculate the probability of not matching it correctly, which is \\( 1 - P(\\text{liquid}) \\). Multiply these probabilities for all liquids to get the combined probability of not matching any of the liquids correctly.\n\n3. **Calculate the Probability of At Least One Success**: Subtract the combined probability of failure from 1 to get the probability of correctly matching at least one liquid.\n\n4. **Adjust for Time**: Raise the result from step 3 to the power of \\( t \\) (10 minutes in this case) to account for the time available to make these matches.\n\nBy following these steps, you can calculate the probability of successfully matching each liquid with its corresponding label within the given time frame."
