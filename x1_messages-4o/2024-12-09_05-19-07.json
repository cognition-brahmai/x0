I have set up my database in the settings.py file as follows:\n\n```python\nDATABASES = {\n    'default':{\n        'ENGINE':'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2', # '.postgresql_psycopg2', '.mysql', or '.oracle'\n        'NAME':'indivo', # Required to be non-empty string\n        'USER':'indivo', # Required to be non-empty string\n        'PASSWORD':'ritvik',\n        'HOST':'', # Set to empty string for localhost.\n        'PORT':'', # Set to empty string for default.\n        },\n}\n```\n\nIn the PostgreSQL backend, I've performed the following steps:\n\n```bash\nrohit@rohit-desktop:~$ sudo su - postgres\npostgres@rohit-desktop:~$ createuser --superuser indivo   # create a super user indivo\npostgres@rohit-desktop:~$ psql  # open psql terminal \npsql (9.1.8)\nType \"help\" for help.\n\npostgres=# \\password indivo  # set the password ritvik\nEnter new password: \nEnter it again: \npostgres=# \\q   #logout \npostgres@rohit-desktop:~$ createdb -U indivo -O indivo indivo  #create db indivo \n```\n\nHowever, when I attempt to syncdb, I receive the following error: 'psycopg2.OperationalError: FATAL:  Peer authentication failed for user \"indivo\"'. What could be the possible mistake here?"

        "content": "The error message \"FATAL: Peer authentication failed for user 'indivo'\" typically indicates that PostgreSQL is trying to authenticate the user \"indivo\" using peer authentication, which means it is expecting the operating system user to match the PostgreSQL username. Since this is not the case, the authentication fails.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can change the authentication method for your PostgreSQL user in the `pg_hba.conf` file. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Locate the `pg_hba.conf` file:**\n   - The location of this file can vary depending on your system. Common locations include `/etc/postgresql/<version>/main/pg_hba.conf` on Debian-based systems or `/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf` on Red Hat-based systems.\n\n2. **Edit the `pg_hba.conf` file:**\n   - Open the file in a text editor with superuser privileges. For example:\n     ```bash\n     sudo nano /etc/postgresql/<version>/main/pg_hba.conf\n     ```\n\n3. **Modify the authentication method:**\n   - Look for a line that looks like this:\n     ```\n     local   all             all                                     peer\n     ```\n   - Change `peer` to `md5` to allow password authentication:\n     ```\n     local   all             all                                     md5\n     ```\n\n4. **Restart PostgreSQL:**\n   - After saving the changes, restart the PostgreSQL service to apply them:\n     ```bash\n     sudo service postgresql restart\n     ```\n   - On some systems, you might use:\n     ```bash\n     sudo systemctl restart postgresql\n     ```\n\n5. **Ensure your settings are correct:**\n   - Make sure your `settings.py` file has the correct database credentials, and you're not leaving `HOST` and `PORT` empty if you need to connect through a network interface other than localhost.\n\n6. **Try running `syncdb` again:**\n   - If you\u2019re using Django 1.9 or later, remember that `syncdb` has been replaced with `migrate`:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py migrate\n     ```\n\nThese steps should help resolve the peer authentication issue by switching to password-based authentication, which aligns with how you've set up your database user."
