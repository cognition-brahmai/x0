Ideally, I would like to achieve something similar to this:\n\n```python\nBabel==0.9.5 # translation\nCherryPy==3.2.0 # web server\nCreoleparser==0.7.1 # wiki formatting\nGenshi==0.5.1 # templating\n```"

Your example is perfectly valid:\n\n```plaintext\nBabel==0.9.5 # translation\nCherryPy==3.2.0 # web server\nCreoleparser==0.7.1 # wiki formatting\nGenshi==0.5.1 # templating\n```\n\nIn this example, each comment follows the package version specification, providing a brief explanation of the purpose of the package. This approach is helpful for documenting the role of each package in your project."
