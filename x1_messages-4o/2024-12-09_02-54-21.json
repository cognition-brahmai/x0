        "content": "To calculate the size of a directory in Python, you can traverse through the directory and sum up the sizes of all the files. Here's a function that does just that, and formats the size into a human-readable format:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef get_directory_size(directory):\n    total_size = 0\n    for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(directory):\n        for filename in filenames:\n            filepath = os.path.join(dirpath, filename)\n            if not os.path.islink(filepath):  # To avoid counting symbolic links\n                total_size += os.path.getsize(filepath)\n    return total_size\n\ndef format_size(size):\n    # Convert size to a human-readable format\n    for unit in ['B', 'KB', 'MB', 'GB', 'TB']:\n        if size < 1024.0:\n            return f\"{size:.2f} {unit}\"\n        size /= 1024.0\n\ndirectory_path = 'your_directory_path_here'\nsize_in_bytes = get_directory_size(directory_path)\nreadable_size = format_size(size_in_bytes)\n\nprint(f\"Total size of '{directory_path}' is: {readable_size}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **`os.walk`**: This function is used to iterate over all the directories and files within the specified directory.\n\n2. **`os.path.getsize`**: It retrieves the size of each file.\n\n3. **Size Formatting**: The `format_size` function converts the size from bytes to the most appropriate unit (B, KB, MB, GB, TB) for readability.\n\n### Usage:\n- Replace `'your_directory_path_here'` with the actual path of the directory whose size you want to calculate.\n- Run the script to get the total size in a readable format."
