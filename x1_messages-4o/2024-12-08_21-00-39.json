        "content": "The modulo operator (%) can be used to loop over an array effectively by taking advantage of its ability to wrap around indices. This is particularly useful when you want to iterate over an array in a circular manner without having to reset the index manually.\n\nLet\u2019s consider an array of size 3 and see how you can use the modulo operator to loop over it:\n\n```python\n# Define an array of size 3\narray = ['A', 'B', 'C']\n\n# Define the number of iterations you want to perform\niterations = 10\n\n# Loop over the array using the modulo operator\nfor i in range(iterations):\n    index = i % len(array)  # Use modulo to wrap around the index\n    print(array[index])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `array = ['A', 'B', 'C']`: This is the array that we want to loop over.\n\n- `iterations = 10`: This specifies the number of times you want to loop through the elements of the array. You can set this to any number based on your requirement.\n\n- `for i in range(iterations)`: This loop runs for the specified number of iterations.\n\n- `index = i % len(array)`: The modulo operator is used here to ensure that the index is always within the bounds of the array size. Since the array size is 3, `i % 3` will result in values 0, 1, or 2, repeating as `i` increases.\n\n- `print(array[index])`: This prints the element at the current index, effectively looping over the array in a circular manner.\n\nThis approach ensures that you can loop over any array repeatedly by just adjusting the number of iterations you want."
