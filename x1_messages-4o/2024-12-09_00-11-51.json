Using almond flour and aquafaba as substitutes is an excellent choice. Here's a modified version of the souffl\u00e9 recipe in JSON format using almond flour and aquafaba:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"ingredients\": [\n      {\n         \"name\": \"1 cup almond flour\",\n         \"type\": \"gluten-free\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"name\": \"2 tbsp vegan butter\",\n         \"type\": \"vegan\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"name\": \"1 cup almond milk\",\n         \"type\": \"vegan\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"name\": \"1/2 cup aquafaba\",\n         \"type\": \"vegan\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"name\": \"1/4 cup sugar\",\n         \"type\": \"vegan\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"name\": \"1/4 tsp salt\",\n         \"type\": \"vegan\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"name\": \"1/4 tsp cream of tartar\",\n         \"type\": \"vegan\"\n      }\n   ],\n   \"instructions\": [\n      \"Melt 2 tbsp of vegan butter in a saucepan.\",\n      \"Add 1 cup of almond flour to the melted butter and stir to create a roux.\",\n      \"Gradually add 1 cup of almond milk to the roux, stirring constantly, until it thickens to create a thick sauce.\",\n      \"In a separate bowl, combine 1/2 cup of aquafaba, 1/4 cup of sugar, 1/4 tsp of salt, and 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar.\",\n      \"Beat the aquafaba mixture until stiff peaks form.\",\n      \"Gently fold the aquafaba mixture into the sauce.\",\n      \"Pour the mixture into ramekins.\",\n      \"Bake at 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) for 15-20 minutes, or until the souffl\u00e9s are puffed and golden.\"\n   ]\n}\n```\n\n**Key Modifications:**\n\n1. **Butter Substitute:** Use vegan butter instead of regular butter.\n2. **Milk Substitute:** Use almond milk or another plant-based milk instead of dairy milk.\n3. **Egg Whites Substitute:** Use aquafaba (the liquid from a can of chickpeas) along with cream of tartar to mimic the fluffy texture of beaten egg whites.\n4. **Almond Flour:** Naturally gluten-free, almond flour serves as a great base for the souffl\u00e9.\n\nThis recipe uses aquafaba and almond flour to maintain the light and airy texture while being both gluten-free and vegan. Enjoy experimenting with these ingredients!"
