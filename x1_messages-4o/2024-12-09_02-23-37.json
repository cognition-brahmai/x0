Here's an example of what I've tried so far:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ne = np.array([[0., 1.],[2., 4.],[1., 5.]])\nfor row in xrange(e.shape[0]):\n    e[row] /= np.sum(e[row])\n```\n\nThis gives me the correct result:\n\n```python\narray([[ 0.        ,  1.        ],\n       [ 0.33333333,  0.66666667],\n       [ 0.16666667,  0.83333333]])\n```\n\nHowever, I'm convinced there's a more efficient way to accomplish this task using numpy's built-in functionalities. Can anyone help?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this more efficiently by taking advantage of NumPy's broadcasting capabilities, which allow you to perform operations across entire arrays without the need for explicit loops. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ne = np.array([[0., 1.], [2., 4.], [1., 5.]])\nrow_sums = e.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)\ne_normalized = e / row_sums\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `e.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)` calculates the sum of each row. The `axis=1` parameter specifies that the summation should occur over the rows, and `keepdims=True` ensures that the result has the same number of dimensions as the original array, making it compatible for broadcasting.\n- `e / row_sums` divides each element of the array `e` by the corresponding row sum, utilizing broadcasting to apply the division operation across the rows efficiently.\n\nThis method is not only more concise but also typically more efficient than using a loop, especially for larger arrays."
