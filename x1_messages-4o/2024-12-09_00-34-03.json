However, I keep getting a \"TesseractNotFound Error: tesseract is not installed or it's not in your path\" error even though I have installed tesseract for Windows using the installer. How can I fix this issue? Here's the code I've been using:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport pytesseract\n\nim = Image.open(\"sample1.jpg\")\n\ntext = pytesseract.image_to_string(im, lang = 'eng')\n\nprint(text)\n```\n\nI'm new to Python and I'm not sure how to proceed. I've tried restarting my Spyder application but it hasn't resolved the issue. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated."

        "content": "The error you're encountering typically occurs when the Tesseract executable isn't in your system's PATH, or pytesseract can't find where Tesseract is installed. Here's how you can resolve this issue on Windows:\n\n1. **Verify Tesseract Installation:**\n   - Make sure that Tesseract is installed correctly. If not, download and install it from the official [Tesseract GitHub page](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).\n\n2. **Add Tesseract to System PATH:**\n   - Find the directory where Tesseract is installed. Typically, it is located in `C:\\Program Files\\Tesseract-OCR`.\n   - Add this directory to your system's PATH:\n     - Open the Start Menu and search for \"Environment Variables\".\n     - Click on \"Edit the system environment variables\".\n     - In the System Properties window, click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n     - In the Environment Variables window, under \"System variables\", find the \"Path\" variable, select it, and click \"Edit\".\n     - Click \"New\" and add the path to the Tesseract installation directory (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\Tesseract-OCR`).\n     - Click OK to close all windows.\n\n3. **Set Tesseract Path in Code:**\n   - You can explicitly set the Tesseract executable path in your Python script. This is useful if you have multiple installations or if you encounter PATH issues:\n   ```python\n   from PIL import Image\n   import pytesseract\n\n   # Set this to the path where your tesseract executable is\n   pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\\Program Files\\Tesseract-OCR\\tesseract.exe'\n\n   im = Image.open(\"sample1.jpg\")\n\n   text = pytesseract.image_to_string(im, lang='eng')\n\n   print(text)\n   ```\n\n4. **Restart Your IDE or Command Prompt:**\n   - After making changes to the PATH, restart your IDE (Spyder, PyCharm, etc.) or Command Prompt to ensure the changes take effect.\n\n5. **Verify Installation from Command Line:**\n   - Open Command Prompt and type `tesseract -v` to verify the installation. This should print the version of Tesseract installed.\n\nBy following these steps, your Python script should be able to locate and use the Tesseract executable. If you still encounter issues, double-check the installation path and ensure there are no typos in your code."
