        "content": "The error you are encountering is because `strftime` is a method that operates on a single `datetime.date` object, while `all_data['Order Day new']` is a Pandas Series, not a single date object. To convert a datetime Series to a string format, you can use the `dt.strftime` method available for Pandas Series. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nall_data['Order Day new'] = all_data['Order Day new'].dt.strftime('%d/%m/%Y')\n```\n\nThis code will convert each datetime object in the Series to a string formatted as `dd/mm/yyyy`. Make sure that `all_data['Order Day new']` is indeed a datetime Series before applying the `dt.strftime` method. If it's not, you can convert it using `pd.to_datetime`:\n\n```python\nall_data['Order Day new'] = pd.to_datetime(all_data['Order Day new'])\nall_data['Order Day new'] = all_data['Order Day new'].dt.strftime('%d/%m/%Y')\n```\n\nWith these adjustments, your code should work without any errors."
