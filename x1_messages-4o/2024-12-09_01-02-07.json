        "content": "The error you are encountering is related to the missing host key policy in the Paramiko library. By default, Paramiko does not know what to do if it does not recognize the server's host key. To resolve this, you need to set a host key policy before attempting to connect. Here's how you can do that:\n\n```python\nimport paramiko\n\n# Create an SSH client instance\nssh = paramiko.SSHClient()\n\n# Set the host key policy to AutoAddPolicy, which automatically adds the host key to the known hosts\nssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())\n\n# Now, attempt to connect\nssh.connect('127.0.0.1', username='boatzart', password='mypassword')\n\n# Remember to close the connection when done\nssh.close()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **SSHClient:** This is an instance of the SSH client.\n2. **set_missing_host_key_policy:** This method sets the policy for automatically adding the server's host key to the known hosts. By setting it to `AutoAddPolicy`, it tells Paramiko to add the server's host key to the known hosts list automatically, which resolves the `Unknown server` error.\n3. **connect:** This method attempts to connect to the specified host using the given username and password.\n\n### Warning:\nUsing `AutoAddPolicy` can expose your application to man-in-the-middle attacks, as it blindly trusts any host key presented by the server. For a more secure approach, consider using `WarningPolicy` or `RejectPolicy`, or manually manage known hosts for added security."
