I have 'cublas64_55.dll', 'cufft64_35.dll' and etc all located in 'C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU ComputingTookit\\CUDA\\v5.5\\bin'. Additionally, both my CUDA_PATH and CUDA_PATH_5.5 environment variables are set to 'C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU ComputingTookit\\CUDA\\v5.5'. Despite this, Cudafy does not seem to be able to find it. Can anyone provide a solution for this problem?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with Cudafy not being able to find the `cublas64_55.dll` despite having the correct paths set up is a common problem. Here are some steps you can try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure that the `PATH` environment variable includes the directory where your CUDA binaries are located. You mentioned having set `CUDA_PATH` and `CUDA_PATH_5.5`, but also ensure that the `PATH` environment variable includes `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v5.5\\bin`.\n\n   To do this:\n   - Right-click on 'Computer' and select 'Properties'.\n   - Click on 'Advanced system settings'.\n   - Click on the 'Environment Variables' button.\n   - In the 'System variables' section, find the `Path` variable, click 'Edit', and ensure that the path `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v5.5\\bin` is included.\n\n2. **Verify DLL Location**: Double-check that the `cublas64_55.dll` is indeed in the `bin` directory of the CUDA installation. You can also try copying the DLL to the directory where your application is being executed to see if it makes a difference.\n\n3. **Check Compatibility**: Make sure that the version of Cudafy you are using is compatible with CUDA 5.5. Cudafy might have specific requirements or known issues with certain versions of CUDA.\n\n4. **Permissions**: Ensure that your user account has read permissions for the directory where the DLLs are located. Sometimes permission issues can prevent DLLs from being loaded.\n\n5. **Reboot Your System**: After making changes to environment variables, it can sometimes be necessary to reboot your system to ensure all processes are using the updated paths.\n\n6. **Dependency Walker**: Use a tool like Dependency Walker to check if there are any missing dependencies for the `cublas64_55.dll` that might be causing the issue.\n\n7. **Update Cudafy**: If possible, try updating to the latest version of Cudafy. There might be bug fixes or improvements that resolve this issue.\n\n8. **Visual Studio Configuration**: Ensure that your Visual Studio project is configured to target the correct platform (x64 in this case since you're using a 64-bit DLL).\n\nIf none of these solutions work, you may need to consider reaching out to Cudafy support or checking forums for similar issues specific to the version of CUDA and Visual Studio you are using."
