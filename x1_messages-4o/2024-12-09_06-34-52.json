I have multiple test files in Python organized as follows:\n\n```\ntests\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 test_apples.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 test_bananas.py.py\n```\n\nIn the '__init__.py' file, I import the tests like this:\n\n```python\nfrom test_apples import ApplesTest\nfrom test_bananas import BananasTest\n```\n\nHowever, when I run Pyflakes on the command line using `pyflakes .`, I get the following errors:\n\n```\ntests/__init__.py:1: [E] PYFLAKES:'ApplesTest' imported but unused\ntests/__init__.py:2: [E] PYFLAKES:'BananasTest' imported but unused\n```"

        "content": "To resolve the 'imported but unused' errors thrown by Pyflakes in the `__init__.py` file, you have a few options:\n\n### 1. Suppress the Warnings\n\nOne way to handle these warnings is to explicitly tell Pyflakes to ignore them by adding a comment at the end of each import line. This is not a built-in feature of Pyflakes itself, but many linters respect the `# noqa` comment to ignore specific warnings:\n\n```python\nfrom test_apples import ApplesTest  # noqa\nfrom test_bananas import BananasTest  # noqa\n```\n\n### 2. Use `__all__` to Explicitly Declare Exports\n\nYou can use the `__all__` variable to indicate that the imported modules are part of the intended public interface of the module. This can also help Pyflakes understand that the imports are intentional:\n\n```python\nfrom test_apples import ApplesTest\nfrom test_bananas import BananasTest\n\n__all__ = ['ApplesTest', 'BananasTest']\n```\n\n### 3. Rethink the Need for Imports in `__init__.py`\n\nIf these imports are not being used in `__init__.py`, and you are not using them elsewhere when importing the `tests` package, you might reconsider if you need to have these imports at all. If `__init__.py` is not serving a specific purpose for your test structure, you might not need these imports.\n\n### 4. Configure Pyflakes (or use a Different Linter)\n\nPyflakes is designed to be simple and doesn't offer configuration options to ignore specific errors. However, you could switch to a more configurable linter like Flake8, which combines Pyflakes, pycodestyle, and others. Flake8 allows you to ignore specific error codes in a configuration file or on the command line.\n\nFor example, to ignore unused import warnings in Flake8, you could add the following to a `.flake8` configuration file:\n\n```ini\n[flake8]\nignore = F401\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nChoose the approach that best fits your use case. Using `__all__` is generally a good practice when defining the public interface of a module, and it can help suppress such warnings while improving code clarity. However, if these imports are not necessary, consider removing them to keep the code clean and understandable."
