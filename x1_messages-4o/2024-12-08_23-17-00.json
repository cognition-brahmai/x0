        "content": "Certainly! You can design a Python function that uses a dictionary to count the number of unique characters in a given string. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef count_unique_characters(text):\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store character counts\n    char_count = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each character in the string\n    for char in text:\n        # If the character is already in the dictionary, increment its count\n        if char in char_count:\n            char_count[char] += 1\n        # If the character is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1\n        else:\n            char_count[char] = 1\n\n    # Return the number of unique characters by counting the keys in the dictionary\n    return len(char_count)\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\nunique_char_count = count_unique_characters(text)\nprint(f\"Number of unique characters: {unique_char_count}\")\n```\n\nIn this function, we iterate over each character in the string `text` and use a dictionary `char_count` to keep track of how many times each character appears. The keys of the dictionary are the characters, and the values are their respective counts. Finally, the function returns the number of unique characters by counting the number of keys in the dictionary."
