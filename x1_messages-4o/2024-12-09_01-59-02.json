After an update on my Mac, it won't let me reinstall lxml as it throws an error, \"In file included from src/lxml/lxml.etree.c:314: /private/tmp/pip_build_root/lxml/src/lxml/includes/etree_defs.h:9:10: fatal error: 'libxml/xmlversion.h' file not found.\" I attempted to use brew to install libxml2 and libxslt, which installed correctly, but lxml installation still failed. Previously, I managed to install by enabling the developer tools on Xcode, but after updating to Xcode 5, I no longer have that option. Can someone advise me on how to resolve this issue?"

        "content": "It seems like you're running into a common issue where the necessary header files for `libxml2` and `libxslt` are not being found by the `lxml` installer. Let's try a few steps to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Command Line Tools are Installed**: After updating Xcode, you might need to reinstall the command line tools. Open your terminal and run:\n\n   ```bash\n   xcode-select --install\n   ```\n\n   Follow the prompts to complete the installation if needed.\n\n2. **Set Environment Variables**: Sometimes the `lxml` installation needs explicit paths to the libraries. You can set these paths using environment variables. Run the following commands in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   export CFLAGS=\"-I$(brew --prefix libxml2)/include/libxml2 -I$(brew --prefix libxslt)/include\"\n   export LDFLAGS=\"-L$(brew --prefix libxml2)/lib -L$(brew --prefix libxslt)/lib\"\n   ```\n\n   These commands tell the compiler where to find the necessary libraries and headers.\n\n3. **Install lxml Using pip**: Once you've set the environment variables, try installing `lxml` again with pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install lxml\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Homebrew Installations**: Ensure that both `libxml2` and `libxslt` are installed correctly via Homebrew. You can check this with:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew list libxml2\n   brew list libxslt\n   ```\n\n   If they're not listed, you can install or reinstall them using:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install libxml2 libxslt\n   ```\n\n5. **Use Virtual Environment**: Sometimes using a virtual environment can isolate dependencies and prevent conflicts. Consider creating a virtual environment for your project:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   pip install lxml\n   ```\n\n6. **Check Python Version**: Ensure that the version of Python you are using is compatible with the version of `lxml` you are trying to install. Sometimes, using a different Python version can resolve these issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the installation issue with `lxml` on your Mac OS X 10.9. If the problem persists, please provide any additional error messages you encounter for further assistance."
