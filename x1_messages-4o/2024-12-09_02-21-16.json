I tried to override the user-agent of my crawlspider by adding an extra line to the project configuration file with the following code:\n\n```python\n[settings]\ndefault = myproject.settings\nUSER_AGENT = \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/27.0.1453.93 Safari/537.36\"\n\n[deploy]\n#url = http://localhost:6800/\nproject = myproject\n```\nHowever, when I run the crawler against my own website, the spider does not pick up my customized user agent but the default one \"Scrapy/0.18.2 (+http://scrapy.org)\". \nWhen I override the user agent globally, it works. Also, if I remove the line \"default = myproject.setting\" from the configuration file, and run scrapy crawl myproject.com, it says \"cannot find spider..\". What am I doing wrong?"

        "content": "To set up a custom User-Agent in Scrapy, you should modify the `settings.py` file within your Scrapy project, not the configuration file you are referring to. The `[settings]` and `[deploy]` sections you mentioned are not typically used for setting configurations in Scrapy. Let's go through the correct steps to set up a custom User-Agent:\n\n1. **Modify the `settings.py` file:**\n   Open the `settings.py` file in your Scrapy project and add or modify the `USER_AGENT` setting. Here's how you can do it:\n\n   ```python\n   # settings.py\n\n   USER_AGENT = \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/27.0.1453.93 Safari/537.36\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Ensure your spider is using the correct settings:**\n   Make sure that your spider is using the correct settings file. When you run your spider, it should automatically use `settings.py` from your project directory.\n\n3. **Check for any local overrides:**\n   If you are overriding the user agent in your spider code, it will take precedence over the global setting in `settings.py`. Make sure you are not accidentally setting a different user agent in your spider.\n\n4. **Running the spider:**\n   When running your spider, you should not need to specify any additional settings if everything is configured correctly. Simply run your spider using the command:\n\n   ```bash\n   scrapy crawl yourspidername\n   ```\n\n5. **Avoid using non-standard configuration files:**\n   The syntax you mentioned with `[settings]` and `[deploy]` is not standard for Scrapy. Stick to modifying `settings.py` for configuring global settings like the `USER_AGENT`.\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   To verify that the correct User-Agent is being used, you can inspect the requests being sent by your Scrapy spider. You can add logging to your spider to print out the User-Agent for each request:\n\n   ```python\n   import scrapy\n\n   class MySpider(scrapy.Spider):\n       name = 'myspider'\n\n       def start_requests(self):\n           urls = [\n               'http://example.com',\n           ]\n           for url in urls:\n               yield scrapy.Request(url=url, callback=self.parse)\n\n       def parse(self, response):\n           self.logger.info('User-Agent: %s', response.request.headers['User-Agent'])\n           # Your parsing logic here\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to set a custom User-Agent for your Scrapy project correctly."
