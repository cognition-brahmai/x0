I have found the definitions of the `delete` and `delete_by_query` functions, but there are no examples in the documentation on how to use them. For example, if I have inserted a new document like this:\n```python\ndoc = {'name':'Jacobian'}\ndb.index(index=\"reestr\",doc_type=\"some_type\",body=doc)\n```\nHow can I delete this document using `delete` and `delete_by_query` functions?"

        "content": "To delete documents from Elasticsearch using Python, you can use the `elasticsearch` Python client. You have two primary methods for deleting documents: `delete` and `delete_by_query`. Below are examples of how to use both methods.\n\n### Using `delete`\n\nThe `delete` method removes a document from an index by specifying its unique ID. If you know the ID of the document, you can use this method. Here is an example:\n\n```python\nfrom elasticsearch import Elasticsearch\n\n# Connect to the Elasticsearch cluster\nes = Elasticsearch()\n\n# Assume you have the document ID\ndoc_id = \"1\"\n\n# Delete the document by its ID\nresponse = es.delete(index=\"reestr\", doc_type=\"some_type\", id=doc_id)\n\nprint(response)\n```\n\n### Using `delete_by_query`\n\nThe `delete_by_query` method removes documents that match a specific query. This is useful when you don't know the document ID but want to delete documents based on certain criteria.\n\nFor example, to delete all documents where the `name` field is `Jacobian`, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom elasticsearch import Elasticsearch\n\n# Connect to the Elasticsearch cluster\nes = Elasticsearch()\n\n# Define the query to match documents\nquery = {\n    \"query\": {\n        \"match\": {\n            \"name\": \"Jacobian\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n# Delete documents matching the query\nresponse = es.delete_by_query(index=\"reestr\", body=query)\n\nprint(response)\n```\n\n### Important Notes:\n\n- Ensure that the Elasticsearch cluster is running and accessible.\n- The `doc_type` parameter is deprecated in Elasticsearch 7.x and removed in 8.x. If you're using a newer version of Elasticsearch, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.\n- Always handle exceptions and errors, especially in production code, to ensure that you have a robust solution.\n\nThese examples should help you delete documents from Elasticsearch using Python effectively."
