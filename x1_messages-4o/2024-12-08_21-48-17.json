Below is a detailed literary analysis of Shakespeare's Sonnet 18, formatted in LaTeX:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{titlesec}\n\\titleformat{\\section}{\\normalfont\\scshape}{\\thesection}{1em}{}\n\n\\title{\\textbf{Literary Analysis of Shakespeare's Sonnet 18}}\n\\author{SensAi}\n\\date{}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nWilliam Shakespeare's \\textbf{Sonnet 18}, often referred to by its opening line, \"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\" is one of the most famous of his 154 sonnets. The sonnet is a celebration of the beloved's beauty and an exploration of the theme of immortality through poetry.\n\n\\section{Theme}\nThe primary theme of Sonnet 18 is the eternal nature of art and beauty. Shakespeare asserts that while natural beauty is transient, the beauty captured in poetry is everlasting. The poem juxtaposes the ephemeral qualities of a summer's day with the enduring nature of the written word.\n\n\\section{Structure}\nSonnet 18 follows the traditional structure of a Shakespearean sonnet, comprising three quatrains and a final rhymed couplet. The rhyme scheme is \\textit{ABABCDCDEFEFGG}, and it is written in iambic pentameter.\n\n\\section{Literary Devices}\n\n\\subsection{Imagery}\nImagery is vividly employed in the sonnet to compare the beloved's beauty to a summer's day. Phrases like \"Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May\" and \"the eye of heaven shines\" create a vivid image of summer.\n\n\\subsection{Metaphor}\nThe sonnet opens with a metaphor, comparing the beloved to a summer's day. This metaphor is extended throughout the poem to highlight the beloved's superior qualities.\n\n\\subsection{Personification}\nPersonification is used in lines such as \"Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,\" where Death is given human attributes, emphasizing the power of poetry to defy mortality.\n\n\\subsection{Contrast}\nShakespeare contrasts the temporary nature of a summer's day with the eternal beauty of the beloved. Summer is depicted as fleeting and unpredictable, while the beloved's beauty is constant.\n\n\\section{Analysis}\n\n\\subsection{Quatrain 1}\nThe first quatrain poses the question of comparison between the beloved and a summer's day. The speaker immediately concludes that the beloved is \"more lovely and more temperate,\" establishing the superiority of the beloved's beauty.\n\n\\subsection{Quatrain 2}\nThe second quatrain elaborates on the shortcomings of summer: its brevity and susceptibility to change. This serves to highlight the imperfections of natural beauty, which the beloved transcends.\n\n\\subsection{Quatrain 3}\nThe third quatrain assures the beloved that their beauty will not fade, nor will they be claimed by Death. This assurance is grounded in the immortality provided by the poem itself.\n\n\\subsection{Couplet}\nThe concluding couplet, \"So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, / So long lives this, and this gives life to thee,\" asserts the enduring power of the written word to confer immortality.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nSonnet 18 is a testament to the power of poetry to capture and preserve beauty beyond the confines of time. Through the use of vivid imagery, metaphor, and personification, Shakespeare immortalizes the beloved's beauty, asserting the timeless nature of art.\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nThis LaTeX document provides a structured literary analysis of Sonnet 18, discussing its themes, structure, and literary devices, and concludes with an interpretation of its overall meaning."
