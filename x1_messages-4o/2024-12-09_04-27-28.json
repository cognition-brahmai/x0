        "content": "Yes, you can create a helper function to safely retrieve values from a nested dictionary using the `get()` method. Python's `dict.get()` method is handy for safely accessing dictionary values, but it doesn't support nested dictionaries out of the box. Here's a way to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef get_nested(dictionary, keys, default=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Safely get a value from a nested dictionary.\n    \n    :param dictionary: The dictionary to search.\n    :param keys: A list of keys representing the path to the desired value.\n    :param default: The default value to return if the path is not found.\n    :return: The value at the given path or the default value.\n    \"\"\"\n    current_dict = dictionary\n    for key in keys:\n        if isinstance(current_dict, dict):\n            current_dict = current_dict.get(key, default)\n        else:\n            return default\n    return current_dict\n\n# Example usage\nvalue = get_nested(example_dict, ['key1', 'key2'], default='default_value')\nprint(value)  # This will print the value if keys exist, otherwise 'default_value'\n```\n\nThis function `get_nested` takes a dictionary, a list of keys that represent the path to the desired value, and a default value to return if any key along the path is not found. This approach is more flexible and cleaner for accessing nested dictionary values safely."
