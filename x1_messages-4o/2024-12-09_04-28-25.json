        "content": "To fill the area between two specific vertical lines in Matplotlib, you can use the `axvspan` function, which is specifically designed for shading the area between two vertical lines. This function is more straightforward for this task compared to `fill_between`, `fill`, or `fill_betweenx`, which are typically used for filling between curves or lines.\n\nHere's how you can use `axvspan` to fill the area between `x=0.2` and `x=4` for the full y range of the plot:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample data\nx = np.linspace(0, 5, 100)\ny = np.sin(x)\n\nplt.plot(x, y, label='sin(x)')\n\n# Fill the area between x=0.2 and x=4\nplt.axvspan(0.2, 4, color='grey', alpha=0.3)\n\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('y')\nplt.title('Fill between x=0.2 and x=4')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example, `axvspan` is used to fill the area between the vertical lines at `x=0.2` and `x=4`. The `color` parameter sets the color of the shaded area, and `alpha` controls its transparency.\n\nIf you still prefer to use `fill_between`, you can do so by creating a mask for the x values that fall within the desired range. However, this approach is more complex and less direct than using `axvspan`. Here's how you could achieve it:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample data\nx = np.linspace(0, 5, 100)\ny = np.sin(x)\n\nplt.plot(x, y, label='sin(x)')\n\n# Create a mask for x values between 0.2 and 4\nmask = (x >= 0.2) & (x <= 4)\n\n# Fill the area between the masked x range\nplt.fill_between(x, y1=min(y), y2=max(y), where=mask, color='grey', alpha=0.3)\n\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('y')\nplt.title('Fill between x=0.2 and x=4 using fill_between')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `where` parameter is used to specify the condition under which the area should be filled. However, `fill_between` is generally more suited for filling between curves rather than vertical lines, so `axvspan` remains the simpler and more appropriate choice for your specific scenario."
