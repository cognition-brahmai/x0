I am currently using the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom celery.task.control import revoke\n\nrevoke(task_id, terminate=True)\n```\n\nwhere `task_id` is a string (I have also tried converting it into UUID using `uuid.UUID(task_id).hex`). However, when I restart Celery with `celery worker -A proj`, it still consumes the same message and starts processing it. Additionally, when viewed via `flower`, the message is still there in the broker section. How do I delete the message so that it can't be consumed again?"

        "content": "To explicitly revoke a task in Celery and ensure it is not retried or consumed again, you need to make sure that the task is revoked before it is picked up by a worker. Revoking a task in Celery marks it as \"do not execute\" in the worker's memory, but if the task is in the broker queue and not yet dispatched to a worker, it may still be picked up by a worker on restart.\n\nHere are some steps to ensure that the task is revoked effectively:\n\n1. **Revoke Before Task Execution**: Make sure you revoke the task before it is fetched by any worker. If the task is already in execution, you must rely on the `terminate=True` flag to terminate it forcefully.\n\n2. **Purge the Queue**: If you want to ensure the task is removed from the broker queue, you might need to purge the entire queue. Be cautious, as this will remove all tasks in the queue:\n\n    ```bash\n    celery -A proj purge\n    ```\n\n   This command will prompt you for confirmation before purging the queue.\n\n3. **Proper Use of UUID**: Ensure you are using the correct `task_id`. You do not need to convert it into UUID or hex format for revocation; it should be used as-is.\n\n4. **Check Task State**: If the task is still being executed or scheduled, check the task's state in the backend (if you are using one, like Redis or a database). Sometimes, tasks are retried due to failures, so ensure that retries are handled properly.\n\n5. **Inspect Tasks**: Use Celery's inspect command to check for active tasks and revoke them if necessary:\n\n    ```bash\n    celery -A proj inspect active\n    celery -A proj inspect reserved\n    ```\n\n   This will show you the tasks that are currently active or reserved by workers.\n\n6. **Update Flower**: Sometimes, Flower's view might not refresh immediately. Try refreshing Flower's UI or restarting Flower to get the most updated view of the tasks.\n\nIf you've followed these steps and tasks are still being consumed unexpectedly, consider checking your queue configuration and broker settings to ensure there are no issues with task retention or message expiration."
