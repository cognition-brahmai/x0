However, when I try to run individual tests I get a \"No such test\" error. Is there something wrong with the following commands?\n\n```\n$ nosetests test_web.py:test_checkout\n$ nosetests TestWeb:test_checkout\n```"

The issue might be due to the way the test is being specified. Here is the correct way to run a single test method from a test class using `nosetests`:\n\n1. **Specify the module and class:** You should include both the module (file name without the `.py` extension) and the class name.\n\n2. **Correct syntax:** Use the following command format:\n\n   ```\n   $ nosetests test_web.py:TestWeb.test_checkout\n   ```\n\n   Here's the breakdown:\n   - `test_web.py` is the name of your test file.\n   - `TestWeb` is the name of the class containing your test method.\n   - `test_checkout` is the method you want to run.\n\nIf you still encounter issues, ensure that:\n- There are no syntax errors in your test file.\n- The test method `test_checkout` is correctly defined within the `TestWeb` class.\n- Your Python environment is correctly set up and `nosetests` is installed and accessible.\n\nIf everything is set up correctly, this command should run only the `test_checkout` method from the `TestWeb` class in your `test_web.py` file."
