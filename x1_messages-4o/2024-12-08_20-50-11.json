        "content": "The density of a material is typically measured in units such as grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm\u00b3) or kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m\u00b3). For steel, which is an alloy primarily composed of iron and carbon, the density can vary slightly depending on its composition, but it is generally about:\n\n- **7.85 g/cm\u00b3** \n- **7850 kg/m\u00b3**\n\nThis value can vary depending on the specific type and grade of steel, as additional alloying elements can affect its density."
