        "content": "To strip all non-alphanumeric characters from a string in Python, you can use regular expressions (regex) with the `re` module. Regular expressions provide a flexible way to identify patterns in strings, and they are quite efficient for tasks like this. Here's how you can use regex to remove all non-alphanumeric characters from a string:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef remove_non_alphanumeric(s):\n    # Use regex to substitute non-alphanumeric characters with an empty string\n    return re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '', s)\n\n# Example usage\ninput_string = \"Hello, World! (Python is great.)\"\nclean_string = remove_non_alphanumeric(input_string)\nprint(clean_string)  # Output: HelloWorldPythonisgreat\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '', s)` is used to replace every character in the string `s` that is not an alphanumeric character (i.e., not a-z, A-Z, or 0-9) with an empty string `''`.\n- The pattern `[^a-zA-Z0-9]` matches any character that is not an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, or digit.\n- This effectively removes all punctuation and special characters from the string, leaving only the alphanumeric characters.\n\nThis method is efficient for most use cases and should perform well even on larger strings."
