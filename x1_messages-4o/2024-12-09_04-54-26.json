Specifically, I'm interested in the naming conventions for 'inner', 'function', and 'wrapped' in the example provided. The style guide does not mention it, and while I've found a helpful entry about decorators that consistently uses variations of 'wrapped' for the final function that is returned, it's unclear about the names used when creating decorators that take arguments.\n\nExample decorator:\n```python\ndef decorator_name(whatevs):\n    def inner(function):\n        def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):\n            # sweet decorator goodness\n        return wrapped\n    return inner\n```"

        "content": "In Python, decorators are a powerful feature that allows you to modify the behavior of functions or methods. When it comes to naming conventions within decorators, there isn't a strict set of rules, but there are some common practices that developers tend to follow for clarity and consistency. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the typical naming conventions used in the components of a decorator:\n\n1. **Outer Function (`decorator_name`)**:\n   - The outer function is typically named to reflect the purpose of the decorator. In your example, `decorator_name` should be replaced with a name that indicates what the decorator does (e.g., `log_execution`, `cache_result`, etc.).\n\n2. **Inner Function (`inner`)**:\n   - The inner function is often named `inner`, `wrapper`, or `decorator` if it\u2019s the main function that applies the decorator logic. This function is responsible for accepting the function to be decorated as its parameter. It can also be named to reflect its purpose, but generic names like `inner` or `wrapper` are commonly used for simplicity.\n\n3. **Innermost Function (`wrapped`)**:\n   - The innermost function, which actually wraps the function being decorated, is frequently named `wrapped`, `wrapper`, or `wrapped_function`. This function typically takes `*args` and `**kwargs` to handle any arguments that the original function might receive. The name `wrapped` is quite popular as it indicates that this function is the actual wrapping layer over the original function.\n\n4. **Arguments (`whatevs`)**:\n   - If your decorator takes arguments, the parameter names should be descriptive of what those arguments represent. In your example, `whatevs` is a placeholder and should be replaced with a name that reflects the purpose of the argument(s).\n\nHere\u2019s a more descriptive version of your example with these naming conventions applied:\n\n```python\ndef my_decorator(argument):\n    def wrapper_function(original_function):\n        def wrapped_function(*args, **kwargs):\n            # sweet decorator goodness\n            return original_function(*args, **kwargs)  # Ensure to return the result for correct functionality\n        return wrapped_function\n    return wrapper_function\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- `my_decorator` reflects the purpose of the decorator.\n- `wrapper_function` is used for the inner function that accepts the original function.\n- `wrapped_function` is the innermost function that replaces the original function, executing any additional logic.\n\nConsistency and clarity are key, so choose names that make the decorator's function and structure clear to anyone reading the code."
