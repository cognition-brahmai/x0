The function `missing_elements` includes the `yield from` statement which is not available in Python 2.7. If there are two `yield from` calls like in the example provided, are the entries from the two halves (upper and lower) appended to each other in one list? Would the parent recursion function with the `yield from` call be able to use both the halves together? How could I convert this code to be compatible with Python 2.7?\n\n```python\ndef missing_elements(L, start, end):  # Python 3.2\n    if end - start <= 1: \n        if L[end] - L[start] > 1:\n            yield from range(L[start] + 1, L[end])\n        return\n\n    index = start + (end - start) // 2\n\n    # is the lower half consecutive?\n    consecutive_low =  L[index] == L[start] + (index - start)\n    if not consecutive_low:\n        yield from missing_elements(L, start, index)\n\n    # is the upper part consecutive?\n    consecutive_high =  L[index] == L[end] - (end - index)\n    if not consecutive_high:\n        yield from missing_elements(L, index, end)\n\ndef main():\n    L = [10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20]\n    print(list(missing_elements(L, 0, len(L)-1)))\n    L = range(10, 21)\n    print(list(missing_elements(L, 0, len(L)-1)))\n\ndef missing_elements(L, start, end):  # Python 2.7\n    return_list = []                \n    if end - start <= 1: \n        if L[end] - L[start] > 1:\n            return range(L[start] + 1, L[end])\n\n    index = start + (end - start) // 2\n\n    # is the lower half consecutive?\n    consecutive_low =  L[index] == L[start] + (index - start)\n    if not consecutive_low:\n        return_list.append(missing_elements(L, start, index))\n\n    # is the upper part consecutive?\n    consecutive_high =  L[index] == L[end] - (end - index)\n    if not consecutive_high:\n        return_list.append(missing_elements(L, index, end))\n    return return_list\n```"

        "content": "To convert the given Python 3.2 code to be compatible with Python 2.7, we need to replace the `yield from` statement, which is not available in Python 2.7, with a generator pattern using explicit loops. The goal is to yield elements one by one instead of using `yield from`.\n\nHere's how you can modify the `missing_elements` function to work in Python 2.7:\n\n```python\ndef missing_elements(L, start, end):  # Python 2.7\n    if end - start <= 1: \n        if L[end] - L[start] > 1:\n            for x in range(L[start] + 1, L[end]):\n                yield x\n        return\n\n    index = start + (end - start) // 2\n\n    # is the lower half consecutive?\n    consecutive_low = L[index] == L[start] + (index - start)\n    if not consecutive_low:\n        for x in missing_elements(L, start, index):\n            yield x\n\n    # is the upper part consecutive?\n    consecutive_high = L[index] == L[end] - (end - index)\n    if not consecutive_high:\n        for x in missing_elements(L, index, end):\n            yield x\n\ndef main():\n    L = [10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20]\n    print(list(missing_elements(L, 0, len(L) - 1)))\n    L = range(10, 21)\n    print(list(missing_elements(L, 0, len(L) - 1)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Yield Replacement**: Instead of using `yield from`, use a `for` loop to iterate over the generator returned by the recursive call and yield each item individually.\n   \n2. **Range Compatibility**: In Python 2, `range` returns a list, and in Python 3, it returns a range object. However, this difference doesn't affect the logic here since we are using it in a loop to yield elements.\n\n3. **Main Function**: The `main()` function is used to execute and test the code, ensuring the function behaves as expected.\n\nBy making these changes, you should be able to run the code in Python 2.7 without using `yield from` and still achieve the same functionality."
