        "content": "When you're using the Pillow library in Python to open an image and you want to ensure that resources are properly managed, it's important to close the image file after you're done with it. Although the image will be closed automatically when the script terminates or the object is garbage collected, it's good practice to explicitly close it, especially in long-running applications or when opening many images.\n\nHere's how you can open, display, and then properly close an image using Pillow:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n# Open an image file\nwith Image.open('test.png') as img:\n    # Display the image\n    img.show()\n\n    # Provide user options to save or delete the image\n    user_choice = input(\"Do you want to save or delete the image? (save/delete): \").strip().lower()\n\n    if user_choice == 'save':\n        # Save the image to a new file\n        img.save('saved_test.png')\n        print(\"Image saved as 'saved_test.png'.\")\n    elif user_choice == 'delete':\n        # Delete logic can be implemented here\n        print(\"Image will not be saved.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice. No action taken.\")\n\n# The image is automatically closed when the with-block is exited\n```\n\nBy using a `with` statement, the image is automatically closed when the block is exited, regardless of whether it exits normally or due to an exception. This is a neat and effective way to manage resources."
