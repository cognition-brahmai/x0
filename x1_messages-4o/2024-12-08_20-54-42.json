First, echo the numbers and pipe them to the `sort` command.\n2. Use the `-n` option to sort numerically.\n3. Use the `-r` option to sort in reverse order, which will give you descending order.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\necho -e \"5\\n13\\n99\\n1\\n22\" | sort -nr\n```\n\nThis command will output:\n\n```\n99\n22\n13\n5\n1\n```\n\nTo determine the value of the first integer in the newly sorted sequence, you can use the `head` command to extract the first line of the sorted output:\n\n```bash\necho -e \"5\\n13\\n99\\n1\\n22\" | sort -nr | head -n 1\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n99\n```\n\nSo, the value of the first integer in the sorted sequence is 99."
