Can you calculate the probability of the sum of these two balls being an even number? In solving this problem, you are encouraged to utilize your understanding of even and odd numbers, and devise a multi-step approach to arrive at a solution."

        "content": "To find the probability that the sum of the two drawn balls is an even number, we first need to understand the properties of even and odd numbers. The sum of two integers is even if both integers are either even or both are odd.\n\n1. **Count the Even and Odd Numbered Balls:**\n   - There are 10 even-numbered balls (2, 4, 6, ..., 20).\n   - There are 10 odd-numbered balls (1, 3, 5, ..., 19).\n\n2. **Calculate Possible Outcomes:**\n   - The total number of ways to draw 2 balls from 20 is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{20}{2}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\binom{20}{2} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = 190\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Favorable Outcomes (Sum is Even):**\n   - **Both Balls are Even:** We choose 2 balls from the 10 even-numbered balls.\n     \\[\n     \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45\n     \\]\n   - **Both Balls are Odd:** We choose 2 balls from the 10 odd-numbered balls.\n     \\[\n     \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45\n     \\]\n\n   The sum of the favorable outcomes:\n   \\[\n   45 \\text{ (even + even)} + 45 \\text{ (odd + odd)} = 90\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - The probability that the sum of the numbers on the two drawn balls is even is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \\frac{90}{190} = \\frac{9}{19}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the probability that the sum of the two drawn balls is an even number is \\(\\frac{9}{19}\\)."
