        "content": "To upload a file to a specific virtual directory within an Amazon S3 bucket, you need to set the key name in the S3 bucket to include the desired path. In your case, you want to upload the file to the `bucket/images/holiday` directory. You can achieve this by modifying the `k.key` attribute to include the directory path.\n\nHere's how you can modify your existing code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport boto\nimport boto.s3\n\n# AWS ACCESS DETAILS\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = ''\nAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = ''\n\nbucket_name = AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID.lower() + '-mah-bucket'\nconn = boto.connect_s3(AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)\nbucket = conn.create_bucket(bucket_name, location=boto.s3.connection.Location.DEFAULT)\nuploadfile = sys.argv[1]\n\nprint 'Uploading %s to Amazon S3 bucket %s' % (uploadfile, bucket_name)\n\ndef percent_cb(complete, total):\n    sys.stdout.write('.')\n    sys.stdout.flush()\n\nfrom boto.s3.key import Key\nk = Key(bucket)\n\n# Set the key to include the desired virtual directory path\nk.key = 'images/holiday/' + uploadfile.split('/')[-1]  # Ensure only the file name is added to the path\n\nk.set_contents_from_filename(uploadfile, cb=percent_cb, num_cb=10)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Path Specification**: The `k.key` is set to `'images/holiday/' + uploadfile.split('/')[-1]`. This ensures that the file is uploaded to the `images/holiday` directory and maintains its original filename.\n\n2. **Variable Name**: Make sure `testfile` is replaced with `uploadfile` in `k.set_contents_from_filename(uploadfile, cb=percent_cb, num_cb=10)` to match the variable name used for the input file.\n\nThese changes ensure that the file is uploaded to the specified virtual directory within the S3 bucket."
