        "content": "In Python, I have a function that takes an integer and a boolean as arguments. If the integer falls within a certain range, I want the function to return the opposite of the given boolean. Currently, I'm using a nested if-statement to check the boolean and return its opposite. Is there a way to achieve this without the second if-statement? Here's the code I'm currently using:\n\n```python\ndef functionName(int, bool):\n    if int in range(...):\n        if bool == True:\n            return False\n        else:\n            return True\n```\n\nI'm looking for a way to directly return the opposite of the boolean without having to check if it's true or false."

        "content": "Certainly! You can simplify your function by using the `not` operator, which directly returns the opposite of a boolean value. This way, you can eliminate the nested `if` statement. Here's how you can rewrite your function:\n\n```python\ndef functionName(int_value, bool_value):\n    if int_value in range(...):\n        return not bool_value\n```\n\nIn this version, `not bool_value` will automatically return `False` if `bool_value` is `True`, and `True` if `bool_value` is `False`, which is exactly what you're looking for. The `not` operator is a clean and concise way to invert a boolean value."
