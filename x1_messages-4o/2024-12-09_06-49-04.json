        "content": "To verify the existence of a program within a Bash script, you can use the `command -v` or `type` command. These commands allow you to check if a program is available in the system's PATH. Here's a simple way to implement this check in your script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Program to check\nprogram_name=\"your_program\"\n\n# Check if the program exists\nif ! command -v \"$program_name\" &> /dev/null\nthen\n    echo \"Error: $program_name is not installed.\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n# If the program exists, continue with the rest of the script\necho \"$program_name is installed. Continuing with the script...\"\n\n# Rest of your script goes here\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `command -v \"$program_name\" &> /dev/null`: This checks if the program is in the system's PATH and redirects any output to `/dev/null` to suppress it.\n- `if ! ...`: The `!` negates the condition, so the block is executed if the program is not found.\n- `exit 1`: Exits the script with a status code of 1, indicating an error.\n- If the program is found, the script continues with the rest of the code after the `if` block.\n\nReplace `\"your_program\"` with the actual name of the program you want to check."
