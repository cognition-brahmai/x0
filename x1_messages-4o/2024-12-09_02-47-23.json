Currently, I am using the following code:\n\n```\nf = open(filename, 'r+')\ntext = f.read()\ntext = re.sub('foobar', 'bar', text)\nf.seek(0)\nf.write(text)\nf.close()\n```\n\nHowever, when the old file is larger than the new file, the new file retains a part of the old file at the end. How can I avoid this?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is due to the fact that when you overwrite the file with a shorter content, the leftover data from the previous file content remains. To avoid this, you need to truncate the file after writing the new content. This can be accomplished by using the `truncate()` method. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nwith open(filename, 'r+') as f:\n    text = f.read()\n    text = re.sub('foobar', 'bar', text)\n    f.seek(0)\n    f.write(text)\n    f.truncate()  # This removes any remaining old content\n```\n\nBy using `truncate()`, the file is cut off at the current file position, which is right after the new content you have written. This ensures that any leftover content from the previous version of the file is removed. Also, using `with` to open the file is a good practice as it automatically handles closing the file for you."
