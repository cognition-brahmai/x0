Initially, I tried to use a `self._nursery` in my class to spawn tasks but I have learnt that nursery objects can only be used in a context manager. I don't want to pass in a nursery from outside because it's an implementation detail. I want my objects to be able to spawn tasks that last as long as the object does, for example, a heartbeat task. How can I achieve this with Trio?"

        "content": "To achieve long-lived background tasks within a class using Trio, you'll need to effectively manage the lifecycle of your class and its associated tasks. Since `nursery` objects in Trio are indeed designed to be used within a context manager, you can't simply store and reuse them outside that context. However, you can use a combination of Trio's capabilities and Python's class structure to manage this.\n\nHere's a basic structure on how you can implement a class with long-lived background tasks using Trio:\n\n```python\nimport trio\n\nclass BackgroundTaskClass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._task_scope = None\n        self._cancel_scope = None\n\n    async def start(self):\n        async with trio.open_nursery() as nursery:\n            self._nursery = nursery\n            self._cancel_scope = nursery.cancel_scope\n            # Start your background tasks here\n            nursery.start_soon(self._background_task)\n\n    async def _background_task(self):\n        try:\n            while True:\n                print(\"Background task is running\")\n                await trio.sleep(1)  # simulate work\n        except trio.Cancelled:\n            print(\"Background task is cancelled\")\n\n    async def stop(self):\n        if self._cancel_scope:\n            self._cancel_scope.cancel()\n            await trio.sleep(0)  # Yield control to allow cancellation\n\n# Example usage\nasync def main():\n    my_object = BackgroundTaskClass()\n    await my_object.start()\n    await trio.sleep(5)  # Let the background task run for a while\n    await my_object.stop()\n\ntrio.run(main)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: The class initializes with attributes to hold the nursery and cancel scope.\n2. **Start Method**: The `start` method uses an `async with` block to open a nursery. It records the nursery's cancel scope for later use. You can start background tasks within this block.\n3. **Background Task**: The `_background_task` method represents a task that runs in the background. It loops indefinitely, doing some work and then sleeping. When the task is cancelled, it catches the `trio.Cancelled` exception to perform any necessary cleanup.\n4. **Stop Method**: The `stop` method cancels the tasks using the stored cancel scope, ensuring that all tasks within the nursery are properly terminated.\n\n### Usage:\n- Create an instance of your class and call `start()` to begin the background tasks.\n- Use `stop()` to cancel the tasks when you're done with the object.\n\nThis approach encapsulates the task management within the class, hiding the implementation details, and allows the tasks to run as long as the class instance is active."
