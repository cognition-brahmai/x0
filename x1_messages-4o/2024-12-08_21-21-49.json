        "content": "To calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle in Excel, you can use the Pythagorean theorem. The theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b).\n\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n\\[ c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\]\n\nIn Excel, you can use the `SQRT` function along with the `^` operator to calculate this.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Click on cell C1 where you want the result to appear.\n2. Enter the following formula:\n\n   ```excel\n   =SQRT(A1^2 + B1^2)\n   ```\n\nThis formula squares the values in A1 and B1, adds them together, and then takes the square root of the sum to give you the length of the hypotenuse. After you enter the formula, press Enter, and cell C1 will display the calculated hypotenuse length."
