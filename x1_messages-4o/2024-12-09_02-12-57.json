I want to identify whether it is Mac, Windows or Linux and write the result to a variable instead of printing it on the console. I am aware of using `os.system('uname -o')` in Linux, but it does not meet my requirement. Is there a cross-platform solution to this problem?"

        "content": "Yes, you can use the built-in `platform` module in Python to determine the operating system on which your script is running. This approach is cross-platform and works on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport platform\n\ndef get_os():\n    os_name = platform.system()\n    if os_name == \"Darwin\":\n        return \"Mac\"\n    elif os_name == \"Windows\":\n        return \"Windows\"\n    elif os_name == \"Linux\":\n        return \"Linux\"\n    else:\n        return \"Unknown\"\n\n# Store the result in a variable\noperating_system = get_os()\n\n# Now you can use the `operating_system` variable as needed\n```\n\nThis script will assign the name of the operating system to the `operating_system` variable, which you can then use in your program. The `platform.system()` function returns a string that identifies the OS: \"Darwin\" for macOS, \"Windows\" for Windows, and \"Linux\" for Linux."
