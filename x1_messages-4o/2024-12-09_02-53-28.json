However, I'm facing an error that states \"Expected 2D array, got 1D array instead.\" I think the tutorial might be for older versions of Python. Here's the script I'm using:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import style\n\nstyle.use(\"ggplot\")\nfrom sklearn import svm\n\nx = [1, 5, 1.5, 8, 1, 9]\ny = [2, 8, 1.8, 8, 0.6, 11]\n\nplt.scatter(x,y)\nplt.show()\n\nX = np.array([[1,2],\n             [5,8],\n             [1.5,1.8],\n             [8,8],\n             [1,0.6],\n             [9,11]])\n\ny = [0,1,0,1,0,1]\nX.reshape(1, -1)\n\nclf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear', C = 1.0)\nclf.fit(X,y)\n\nprint(clf.predict([0.58,0.76]))\n```\nI've already tried reshaping the array with `X.reshape(1, -1)` but it doesn't seem to work. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `predict` method expects a 2D array as input, but you're providing a 1D array. When you call `clf.predict([0.58,0.76])`, you should reshape it into a 2D array with one sample and two features.\n\nHere's how you can fix the issue:\n\n1. Reshape the input to the `predict` method to be a 2D array.\n2. Ensure that any reshaping you do is appropriate for the context.\n\nHere's the corrected part of your script:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import style\n\nstyle.use(\"ggplot\")\nfrom sklearn import svm\n\nx = [1, 5, 1.5, 8, 1, 9]\ny = [2, 8, 1.8, 8, 0.6, 11]\n\nplt.scatter(x, y)\nplt.show()\n\nX = np.array([[1, 2],\n              [5, 8],\n              [1.5, 1.8],\n              [8, 8],\n              [1, 0.6],\n              [9, 11]])\n\ny = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\nclf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear', C=1.0)\nclf.fit(X, y)\n\n# Reshape the input for prediction to a 2D array\nprediction_input = np.array([0.58, 0.76]).reshape(1, -1)\nprint(clf.predict(prediction_input))\n```\n\nIn this code, `prediction_input` is reshaped to a 2D array with shape `(1, 2)`, where `1` is the number of samples and `2` is the number of features, matching the dimensionality of the training data. This should resolve the error and allow you to make predictions."
