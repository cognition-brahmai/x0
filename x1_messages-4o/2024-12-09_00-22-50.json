For instance, my list looks like this:\n\n```python\nexample_list = [\n    {'points': 400, 'gold': 2480},\n    {'points': 100, 'gold': 610},\n    {'points': 100, 'gold': 620},\n    {'points': 100, 'gold': 620}\n]\n```\nI want to find the sum of all 'gold' values in these dictionaries. Currently, I am using a for loop to iterate through the list and add the 'gold' values, but I am looking for a more efficient and concise way to achieve this. My current code is as follows:\n\n```python\ntotal_gold = 0\nfor item in example_list:\n    total_gold += example_list[\"gold\"]\n```\nCan you suggest a better way to sum all 'gold' values, preferably a one-liner?"

Here's how you can do it in a one-liner:\n\n```python\ntotal_gold = sum(item['gold'] for item in example_list)\n```\n\nThis code snippet uses a generator expression to iterate over each dictionary in `example_list` and extract the 'gold' value, then sums up all these values using the `sum()` function. It's both efficient and easy to read."
