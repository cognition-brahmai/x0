Let's say I have the following lists:\n\n```python\nassignment = ['Title', 'Project1', 'Project2', 'Project3']\ngrades = [ ['Jim', 45, 50, 55], \\\n           ['Joe', 55, 50, 45], \\\n           ['Pat', 55, 60, 65] ]\n```\n\nI am currently able to zip these lists using the following code:\n\n```python\nzip(assignment, grades[0], grades[1], grades[2])\n```\n\nHowever, what I need to know is how I can use the zip function to zip these lists if the grades list contains an unknown number of items?"

        "content": "To zip an unknown number of lists in Python, you can use the `*` operator to unpack the list of lists. This allows you to pass each sublist within the `grades` list as separate arguments to the `zip` function. Here's how you can do it with your example:\n\n```python\nassignment = ['Title', 'Project1', 'Project2', 'Project3']\ngrades = [\n    ['Jim', 45, 50, 55],\n    ['Joe', 55, 50, 45],\n    ['Pat', 55, 60, 65]\n]\n\n# Unpacking the grades list using * operator\nzipped_lists = list(zip(assignment, *grades))\n\n# Print the zipped result\nfor item in zipped_lists:\n    print(item)\n```\n\nIn this code, `*grades` unpacks the grades list, effectively passing each list inside `grades` as separate arguments to the `zip` function. This way, you can handle any number of lists inside the `grades` list without knowing the count beforehand.\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```\n('Title', 'Jim', 'Joe', 'Pat')\n('Project1', 45, 55, 55)\n('Project2', 50, 50, 60)\n('Project3', 55, 45, 65)\n```\n\nThis will work for any number of sublists inside `grades`."
