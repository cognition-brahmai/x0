        "content": "Yes, Python has equivalent functions for the R functions `qnorm`, `qf`, and `qchi2` that you can find in the `scipy.stats` module. Here's how you can use them:\n\n1. **`qnorm`**: This is used to get the quantile function (inverse of the cumulative distribution function) for a standard normal distribution. In Python, you can use `scipy.stats.norm.ppf`.\n\n   ```python\n   from scipy.stats import norm\n\n   # Example: Get the quantile for the 95th percentile\n   quantile = norm.ppf(0.95)\n   print(quantile)\n   ```\n\n2. **`qf`**: This is used for the F-distribution. In Python, you can use `scipy.stats.f.ppf`.\n\n   ```python\n   from scipy.stats import f\n\n   # Example: Get the quantile for the 95th percentile of an F-distribution\n   # with degrees of freedom df1 and df2\n   df1 = 5\n   df2 = 10\n   quantile = f.ppf(0.95, df1, df2)\n   print(quantile)\n   ```\n\n3. **`qchi2`**: This is used for the chi-squared distribution. In Python, you can use `scipy.stats.chi2.ppf`.\n\n   ```python\n   from scipy.stats import chi2\n\n   # Example: Get the quantile for the 95th percentile of a chi-squared distribution\n   # with k degrees of freedom\n   k = 2\n   quantile = chi2.ppf(0.95, k)\n   print(quantile)\n   ```\n\nThese functions will allow you to compute quantiles for the respective distributions in a way similar to R. The `ppf` function stands for \"percent point function,\" which is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function (CDF)."
