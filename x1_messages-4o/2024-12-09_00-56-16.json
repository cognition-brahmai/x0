I've attempted to utilize setuptools `entry_points{'console_scripts': ... }` options to generate my executable scripts upon `python setuptools install`, in accordance with PEP 338. However, I have been unsuccessful with several attempts, including `entry_points={'console_scripts': ['mypkg=mypkg.__main__'],}`, `entry_points={'console_scripts': ['mypkg=mypkg.main'],}`, and `entry_points={'console_scripts': ['mypkg=python -m mypkg'],}`. How can I properly configure this to call `python -m mypackage` and pass *args, **kwargs?"

        "content": "To set up a `console_scripts` entry point in setuptools that effectively runs `python -m mypackage`, you need to create a small wrapper function in your package that calls `mypackage.__main__`. This is because `console_scripts` expects a function, not a module or command. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieving this:\n\n1. **Create a Wrapper Function**: In your package, create a module (e.g., `cli.py`) that contains a function which will serve as the entry point. This function should import your package and run it as a module.\n\n   ```python\n   # mypackage/cli.py\n   import runpy\n\n   def main():\n       runpy.run_module('mypackage', run_name='__main__')\n   ```\n\n2. **Set up `entry_points` in `setup.py`**: Use this wrapper function in the `entry_points` section of your `setup.py`.\n\n   ```python\n   # setup.py\n   from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\n   setup(\n       name='mypackage',\n       version='0.1',\n       packages=find_packages(),\n       entry_points={\n           'console_scripts': [\n               'mypkg=mypackage.cli:main',\n           ],\n       },\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Install the Package**: Use `pip` to install your package. This will create the `mypkg` executable script that you can run from the command line.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install .\n   ```\n\n4. **Run the Script**: Now you can use `mypkg` from the command line, and it will effectively run `python -m mypackage`.\n\n   ```bash\n   mypkg arg1 arg2\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you create a command-line script that simulates running your package as a module, allowing it to handle `*args` and `**kwargs` as you intended. This approach leverages `runpy.run_module` to execute your package's `__main__.py` functionality."
