I am aware that the total available constant memory is 64KB but I am unsure when this memory is actually allocated on the device. Does this limit apply to each kernel, CUDA context, or for the entire application? Suppose there are several kernels in a .cu file, each using less than 64K constant memory but the total constant memory usage exceeds 64K. Is it feasible to call these kernels sequentially? What would occur if they are called concurrently using different streams? Furthermore, what would happen if a large CUDA dynamic library had numerous kernels each using different amounts of constant memory? Lastly, what if there are two applications, each requiring more than half of the available constant memory? When would the second application fail - at the start, at cudaMemcpyToSymbol() calls, or at kernel execution?"

        "content": "Constant memory in CUDA 4.2, like in other versions, is a special memory space designed for read-only access by the GPU. This memory is cached to optimize bandwidth and is shared across all threads executing on the GPU. Here are some details on its allocation and usage:\n\n1. **Allocation**: Constant memory is allocated at the start of the application, typically during the first call to a CUDA API that requires device memory access, like `cudaMemcpyToSymbol()`. It is not allocated per kernel or per context but is a shared resource across the entire GPU.\n\n2. **Limit**: The 64KB limit applies to the entire application running on the GPU. This means that all kernels, regardless of whether they are in the same `.cu` file or different ones, share this 64KB of constant memory.\n\n3. **Sequential vs. Concurrent Execution**:\n   - **Sequential Execution**: If kernels are called sequentially, they can use different constant memory symbols, provided the total usage at any time does not exceed 64KB. Thus, you can have multiple kernels, each using different constant memory definitions, as long as they do not run concurrently.\n   - **Concurrent Execution**: If kernels are executed concurrently in different streams and if their combined constant memory usage exceeds 64KB, you will run into issues because they all share the same global constant memory space. The behavior is undefined and typically results in incorrect execution or errors.\n\n4. **Large CUDA Dynamic Library**: In a large CUDA dynamic library with numerous kernels, ensure that the total constant memory usage never exceeds 64KB at any point in time when kernels are running concurrently. If they are run sequentially, you need to manage the constant memory usage appropriately, ensuring that no single execution exceeds the limit.\n\n5. **Multiple Applications**: When two applications are running on the same GPU and both require constant memory:\n   - They must adhere to the total global constant memory limit of 64KB. If each requires more than half of the constant memory, the second application might fail at the point where `cudaMemcpyToSymbol()` is called or when the kernel is launched, depending on how the memory is managed and allocated.\n   - CUDA runtime should handle these situations gracefully, but it could lead to errors indicating insufficient resources if the applications exceed the memory limit.\n\nIn summary, managing constant memory in CUDA requires careful planning to ensure that the total usage does not exceed the hardware limits, particularly when dealing with concurrent kernel execution or multiple applications on a single device. If you anticipate exceeding these limits, consider using global memory instead, albeit with potential performance trade-offs."
