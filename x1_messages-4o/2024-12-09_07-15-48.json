I have a list of tuples, `markers = [(97,64),(45,84)]`, and I want to get this specific string as a result: `\"&markers=97,64&markers=45,84\"`. I tried using the following code:\n\n```python\nmarkers = [(97,64),(45,84)]\nresult = (\"&markers=%s\" %x for x in markers)\nreturn result\n```\n\nHowever, this does not return the actual string that I want. How can I modify my code to achieve this?"

        "content": "To generate the desired string from a list of tuples, you need to ensure that you are correctly formatting the tuples and then joining them together to form the final string. Your current approach using a generator expression is a good start, but you need to join the elements of the generator to create a single string. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired result:\n\n```python\nmarkers = [(97,64),(45,84)]\n# Use a list comprehension to format each tuple and then join them with an empty string\nresult = ''.join([\"&markers=%s,%s\" % (x[0], x[1]) for x in markers])\nprint(result)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the changes:\n- Use a list comprehension to iterate over the list of tuples `markers`.\n- Format each tuple `(x[0], x[1])` into the string `&markers=%s,%s`.\n- Use `join` with `''` (an empty string) to concatenate all formatted strings together.\n\nThis will give you the desired output: `\"&markers=97,64&markers=45,84\"`."
