In my code, I have a global variable 'myvar' which I'm trying to change its value inside a function using exec(). However, it seems the variable remains the same. Here's my code:\n\n```python\n>>> myvar = 'test'\n>>> def myfunc():\n...     global myvar\n...     exec('myvar = \"changed!\"')\n...     print(myvar)\n... \n>>> myfunc()\ntest\n>>> print(myvar)\ntest\n```\n\nWhy does the value of 'myvar' remain 'test' and not change to 'changed!' as expected?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to how the `exec()` function interacts with variable scopes in Python. When you use `exec()` inside a function, it does not automatically affect the function's local scope or the global scope as you might expect. Instead, `exec()` executes the code in a separate namespace.\n\nIn your code, you have declared `myvar` as a global variable within the function using the `global` keyword, which should allow you to modify the global variable directly. However, when you use `exec()`, it does not recognize this `global` declaration and instead operates in its own local context.\n\nHere's a way to achieve the desired behavior by explicitly passing the global and local dictionaries to `exec()`:\n\n```python\nmyvar = 'test'\n\ndef myfunc():\n    global myvar\n    exec('myvar = \"changed!\"', globals())\n    print(myvar)\n\nmyfunc()\nprint(myvar)\n```\n\nBy passing `globals()` to `exec()`, you're telling it to modify the global namespace, which allows the change to `myvar` to persist outside the function. After running this code, you should see:\n\n```\nchanged!\nchanged!\n```\n\nThis indicates that the global variable `myvar` was successfully modified by the `exec()` call within the function."
