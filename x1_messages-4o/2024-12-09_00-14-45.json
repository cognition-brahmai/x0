        "content": "In Python, is there an equivalent to the SED command in Bash that doesn't require a double loop? I am currently using the following Bash script, but it is too slow. I have two lists: List A has a bunch of numbers, and List B has the same bunch of numbers but in a different order. For each entry in List A, I want to find the line in List B with that same number and add value C to the end of it. Here's an example of what I want to achieve:\n\nInput:\n\n```\nTime\nBanana\nspinach\nturkey\n```\n\nCommand: `sed -i \"/Banana/ s/$/Toothpaste/\" file`\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nTime\nBananaToothpaste\nspinach\nturkey\n```\n\nThis is the Bash script I have been using:\n\n```\nfor line in $(cat DATSRCLN.txt.utf8); do\n        srch=$(echo $line | awk -F'^' '{print $1}');\n        rep=$(echo $line | awk -F'^' '{print $2}');\n        sed -i \"/$(echo $srch)/ s/$/^$(echo $rep)/\" tmp.1;\ndone\n```\n\nIs there a way to do this more efficiently in Python?"

        "content": "Yes, you can perform this task more efficiently in Python using the `re` module for regular expression operations and file reading/writing capabilities. Here's a Python script that mimics the behavior of your Bash script, but should be more efficient:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef update_file(input_file, data_file):\n    # Read the data file into a list of tuples\n    with open(data_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as df:\n        data = [line.strip().split('^') for line in df]\n\n    # Create a dictionary for quick lookup\n    data_dict = {srch: rep for srch, rep in data}\n\n    # Read the input file\n    with open(input_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        lines = f.readlines()\n\n    # Update lines based on the dictionary\n    updated_lines = []\n    for line in lines:\n        stripped_line = line.strip()\n        if stripped_line in data_dict:\n            updated_line = stripped_line + data_dict[stripped_line] + '\\n'\n            updated_lines.append(updated_line)\n        else:\n            updated_lines.append(line)\n\n    # Write the updated lines back to the file\n    with open(input_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        f.writelines(updated_lines)\n\n# Example usage\nupdate_file('tmp.1', 'DATSRCLN.txt.utf8')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Data Reading**: The script reads `DATSRCLN.txt.utf8` and creates a dictionary `data_dict` where keys are the search terms and values are the replacements. This makes lookups very fast.\n\n2. **File Processing**: It reads the input file `tmp.1` line by line, checks if the stripped line exists in the dictionary, and appends the replacement value if it does.\n\n3. **File Writing**: The updated lines are then written back to the input file.\n\n### Advantages:\n- **Efficiency**: Using a dictionary for lookups is faster than iterating through a list.\n- **Simplicity**: The file is read and written only once, reducing I/O operations.\n- **Flexibility**: This can be easily adjusted for different delimiters or file encodings.\n\nMake sure to adjust the file paths and names according to your setup."
