My Xcode is up-to-date. Could this issue be due to PIL not being compatible with Mac OS 10.9?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering seems to be related to missing X11 development files, which are needed to compile certain parts of PIL (Python Imaging Library) or its successor, Pillow, which is a more up-to-date and compatible fork of PIL.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install Xcode Command Line Tools:**\n   Make sure you have the Xcode Command Line Tools installed, as they include necessary compilers and libraries.\n   ```bash\n   xcode-select --install\n   ```\n\n2. **Install X11 Development Files:**\n   macOS 10.9 doesn't come with X11 files by default. You can install XQuartz, which provides the necessary X11 files.\n   - Download and install XQuartz from [here](https://www.xquartz.org/).\n   - After installing XQuartz, restart your terminal or your Mac to ensure the new paths are loaded.\n\n3. **Use Pillow Instead of PIL:**\n   Since PIL is outdated, it's better to use Pillow, which is a maintained version of PIL and compatible with newer systems.\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip install pillow\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Installation:**\n   After installing Pillow, verify that it was installed correctly by trying to import it in Python.\n   ```python\n   import PIL\n   from PIL import Image\n   ```\n\n5. **Troubleshoot Further:**\n   If you still encounter issues, ensure your Python environment is set up correctly and that you are using the right version of Python and pip. You might also want to try creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   pip install pillow\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully install the Pillow library with all necessary dependencies on your updated macOS 10.9 system."
