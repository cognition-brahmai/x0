        "content": "To optimize your code for flexibility and make it callable in different ways, you can consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Function Overloading**: If you're using a language that supports function overloading (like C++ or Java), you can define multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.\n\n2. **Default Parameters**: Use default parameters in your functions to allow them to be called with fewer arguments than they are defined to accept. This is particularly useful in languages like Python and JavaScript.\n\n3. **Variadic Functions**: Use variadic functions to accept a variable number of arguments. This is available in languages like Python (`*args` and `**kwargs`), JavaScript (spread/rest operators), and C++ (`...`).\n\n4. **Function Pointers/Callbacks**: In languages like C or C++, use function pointers to allow the passing of different functions as arguments to a function. In higher-level languages, you can use callbacks or higher-order functions.\n\n5. **Polymorphism**: If you are working in an object-oriented language, use polymorphism to define a common interface that different classes can implement. This allows you to call the same method on different objects.\n\n6. **Design Patterns**: Implement design patterns like Strategy or Command to allow the code to be used in various contexts.\n\n7. **Modularization**: Break down your code into smaller, reusable modules or functions. This helps in making the codebase more organized and functions more callable independently.\n\n8. **Functional Programming Techniques**: Use map, filter, and reduce functions to make your code more flexible and callable in different contexts.\n\n9. **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**: Use interfaces or abstract classes to define a contract that can be implemented by different classes.\n\n10. **Documentation and Naming**: Ensure that your code is well-documented and that function names and parameters are descriptive. This helps in understanding how the code can be called and used in different ways.\n\nHere's an example in Python demonstrating some of these techniques:\n\n```python\ndef process_data(data, transform=lambda x: x, *, verbose=False):\n    if verbose:\n        print(f\"Processing data: {data}\")\n    return transform(data)\n\n# Callable in different ways\nresult1 = process_data([1, 2, 3], transform=sum, verbose=True)\nresult2 = process_data(\"hello\", transform=str.upper)\nresult3 = process_data([1, 2, 3])  # Uses the default transform\n\nprint(result1)  # Output: 6\nprint(result2)  # Output: HELLO\nprint(result3)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `process_data` function can be called with different transformations and verbosity settings. The use of a lambda function for the default `transform` parameter makes it flexible without requiring the caller to always provide a transformation function."
