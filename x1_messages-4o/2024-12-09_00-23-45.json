I have the following dataset:\n\n```\n   resp          A          B          C\n0     1       poor       poor       good\n1     2       good       poor       good\n2     3  very good  very good  very good\n3     4       bad        poor       bad \n4     5   very bad   very bad   very bad\n5     6       poor       good   very bad\n6     7       good       good       good\n7     8  very good  very good  very good\n8     9       bad        bad    very bad\n9    10   very bad   very bad   very bad\n```\n\nI want to replace 'very bad' with 1, 'bad' with 2, 'poor' with 3, 'good' with 4, and 'very good' with 5 to obtain the following result:\n\n```\n   resp  A  B  C\n0      1  3  3  4\n1     2  4  3  4\n2     3  5  5  5\n3     4  2  3  2\n4     5  1  1  1\n5     6  3  4  1\n6     7  4  4  4\n7     8  5  5  5\n8     9  2  2  1\n9    10  1  1  1\n```\nIs there any method similar to `fillna` but that can replace specific strings with associated values?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this by using the `replace` method in pandas, which allows you to replace specific values in a DataFrame. You don't need to create a mapping function for each column; instead, you can define a dictionary that maps the strings to numbers and apply it to the entire DataFrame. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'resp': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],\n    'A': ['poor', 'good', 'very good', 'bad', 'very bad', 'poor', 'good', 'very good', 'bad', 'very bad'],\n    'B': ['poor', 'poor', 'very good', 'poor', 'very bad', 'good', 'good', 'very good', 'bad', 'very bad'],\n    'C': ['good', 'good', 'very good', 'bad', 'very bad', 'very bad', 'good', 'very good', 'very bad', 'very bad']\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Define the mapping dictionary\nmapping = {\n    'very bad': 1,\n    'bad': 2,\n    'poor': 3,\n    'good': 4,\n    'very good': 5\n}\n\n# Replace the strings with numbers\ndf.replace(mapping, inplace=True)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n   resp  A  B  C\n0     1  3  3  4\n1     2  4  3  4\n2     3  5  5  5\n3     4  2  3  2\n4     5  1  1  1\n5     6  3  4  1\n6     7  4  4  4\n7     8  5  5  5\n8     9  2  2  1\n9    10  1  1  1\n```\n\nThe `replace` method applies the mapping to all columns simultaneously, making it very convenient for this kind of task."
