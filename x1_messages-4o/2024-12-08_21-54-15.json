This helps in matching standalone words.\n- `[a-f0-9]+`: Matches one or more characters that are either a lowercase letter from 'a' to 'f' or a digit from '0' to '9'. This is the core part that identifies lowercase hexadecimal characters.\n- `\\b`: Again asserts a word boundary at the end of the word.\n\nThis regex pattern will match words consisting entirely of lowercase hexadecimal digits."
