        "content": "To forward fill specific columns in a pandas DataFrame, you can use the `fillna()` method with the `method='ffill'` argument, specifying the columns you want to forward fill. Here's how you can do it for a single column and for a group of columns:\n\n### Forward Fill a Single Column\n\nSuppose you have a DataFrame and you want to forward fill only the column `'x'`:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'x': [1, None, 3, None, 5],\n    'y': [None, 2, None, 4, None],\n    'z': [None, None, 3, None, 5]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Forward fill only column 'x'\ndf['x'] = df['x'].fillna(method='ffill')\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Forward Fill a Group of Columns\n\nIf you want to forward fill a group of columns like `['x', 'y']`, you can do it as follows:\n\n```python\n# Forward fill columns 'x' and 'y'\ndf[['x', 'y']] = df[['x', 'y']].fillna(method='ffill')\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- `fillna(method='ffill')`: This method fills the missing values with the last valid observation forward to the next valid.\n- By selecting specific columns (`df['x']` or `df[['x', 'y']]`), you can apply the forward fill operation only to those columns, leaving the rest of the DataFrame unchanged.\n\nThis approach provides you with the flexibility to forward fill only the columns you are interested in, rather than applying it to the entire DataFrame."
