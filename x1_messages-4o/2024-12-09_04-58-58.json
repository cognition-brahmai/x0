        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the use of the `multiprocessing` module on macOS. macOS's default behavior when forking processes can lead to issues when using certain libraries, especially those involving GUI elements or certain system calls. This is because macOS doesn't handle `fork()` well in a multi-threaded environment, which is what the error message is indicating.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can use the `spawn` or `forkserver` start method instead of the default `fork` start method for creating new processes. This approach is safer and avoids issues with libraries that have threading and initialization constraints.\n\nHere is how you can modify your code to use the `spawn` method:\n\n1. Import the `set_start_method` function from the `multiprocessing` module.\n2. Set the start method to `spawn` at the beginning of your script, before any other multiprocessing-related code.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom google.cloud import vision\nfrom google.cloud.vision import types\nimport time\n\nvision_client = vision.ImageAnnotatorClient()\n\ndef runAll(img_urls):\n    num_cores = multiprocessing.cpu_count()\n    print(\"Image URLS  {}\", len(img_urls))\n    if len(img_urls) > 2:\n        numberOfImages = 0\n    else:\n        numberOfImages = 1\n    start_timeProcess = time.time()\n    pool = multiprocessing.Pool()\n    pool.map(annotate, img_urls)\n    end_timeProcess = time.time()\n    print('\\n Time to complete ', end_timeProcess - start_timeProcess)\n\ndef annotate(img_path):\n    file = requests.get(img_path).content\n    print(\"file is\", file)\n    print('Process Working under ', os.getpid())\n    image = types.Image(content=file)\n    web_detection = vision_client.web_detection(image=image).web_detection\n    report(web_detection)\n\ndef report(web_detection):\n    # Implement your reporting logic here\n    pass\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Set the start method to 'spawn' for macOS compatibility\n    multiprocessing.set_start_method('spawn')\n\n    img_urls = [ALL_MY_Image_URLS]  # Replace with your list of image URLs\n\n    start_time = time.time()\n    runAll(img_urls)\n    print(\"--- %s seconds ---\" % (time.time() - start_time))\n```\n\nMake sure you update `ALL_MY_Image_URLS` with the actual list of image URLs you have. Also, ensure the `report` function is properly implemented to handle the results from the Google Vision API.\n\nBy setting the start method to `spawn`, your Python script will create separate processes in a manner that avoids the `fork()`-related issues on macOS."
