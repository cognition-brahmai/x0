Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\ntrace = (go.Scatter(x=[30,45],y=[3000,3000],\n            fill='tozeroy', \n#                 fillcolor='green',\n#                 fillcolor='rgb(26,150,65,0.5)',\n#                 fillcolor=dict(color='rgb(26,150,65,0.5)'),\n#          fillcolor=dict(marker=dict(color='rgb(26,150,65,0.5)')),\n            opacity=0.1,\n            showlegend=False,\n            hoverinfo='none',\n            mode='none'))\npy.offline.iplot(go.Figure(data=[trace]))\n```\n\nIn the default case, it results in the following plot:\n\n![default fillcolor](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q65q6.png)\n\nAnd when I use `fillcolor='green'`, it results in this nontransparent color:\n\n![fillcolor = green](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UWyd4.png)\n\nBut, the commented code results in the default case again. How can I change the fillcolor to another and still maintain transparency?"

        "content": "To achieve a transparent fill color in Plotly, you need to ensure that the alpha channel (transparency level) is set correctly in the RGBA color format. The fill color should be specified using the RGBA format where the last value represents the transparency level, ranging from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque). \n\nHere is how you can modify your code to set a transparent fill color:\n\n```python\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\n\n# Define the trace with transparent fill color\ntrace = go.Scatter(\n    x=[30, 45],\n    y=[3000, 3000],\n    fill='tozeroy',\n    fillcolor='rgba(26, 150, 65, 0.5)',  # Set to desired RGBA color with transparency\n    opacity=1,  # Set opacity to 1 to maintain transparency from fillcolor\n    showlegend=False,\n    hoverinfo='none',\n    mode='none'\n)\n\n# Plot the figure\npy.offline.iplot(go.Figure(data=[trace]))\n```\n\nA few key points to note:\n\n1. **RGBA Format**: Use `fillcolor='rgba(26, 150, 65, 0.5)'` to define the fill color with transparency. The values represent (red, green, blue, alpha), where alpha is the transparency level.\n\n2. **Opacity**: Keep `opacity=1` for the trace, as setting it to a lower value will affect the entire trace, including the border color if any. The `fillcolor` already contains transparency in its definition.\n\n3. **RGBA vs RGB**: Ensure you are using `rgba` instead of `rgb` to include the alpha transparency component.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to achieve the desired transparency for your plot's fill color."
