        "content": "I'm trying to create a Django Middleware class that executes only once at startup in order to initialize some arbitrary code. I followed a solution which involves raising MiddlewareNotUsed('Startup complete') after printing \"Hello world\". However, when I run Django using runserver and request a page, the \"Hello world\" message is printed twice in the terminal. I have the class included in the `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` list in my Django settings file. Can anyone explain why \"Hello world\" is being printed twice?\n\nHere is the middleware class:\n\n```python\nfrom django.core.exceptions import MiddlewareNotUsed\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\nclass StartupMiddleware(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        print \"Hello world\"\n        raise MiddlewareNotUsed('Startup complete')\n```\n\nAnd this is the terminal output:\n\n```python\nDjango version 1.3, using settings 'config.server'\nDevelopment server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/\nQuit the server with CONTROL-C.\nHello world\n[22/Jul/2011 15:54:36] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 698\nHello world\n[22/Jul/2011 15:54:36] \"GET /static/css/base.css HTTP/1.1\" 200 0\n```"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing\u2014where \"Hello world\" is printed twice\u2014is likely due to the way Django's development server operates. When you run Django using `manage.py runserver`, the development server typically starts two processes: one for handling the HTTP requests and one for auto-reloading the server when code changes are detected. This auto-reloading feature can cause your middleware's `__init__` method to be executed twice, once for each process.\n\nHere's a bit more on what's happening:\n\n1. **Main Server Process**: This process starts and initializes your middleware, printing \"Hello world\" and then raising `MiddlewareNotUsed`, which prevents the middleware from being used in future requests in this process.\n\n2. **Auto-reloader Process**: The auto-reloader is a separate process that watches for changes in your codebase. When it initializes, it also loads the middleware, printing \"Hello world\" and subsequently raising `MiddlewareNotUsed`.\n\nTo avoid this duplication during development, you can modify your middleware to ensure that it only runs in the main server process. One way to do this is by checking if the process is the auto-reloader process and skipping execution in that case:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom django.core.exceptions import MiddlewareNotUsed\n\nclass StartupMiddleware(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Check if this is the auto-reloader process\n        if os.environ.get('RUN_MAIN') == 'true':\n            print(\"Hello world\")\n            raise MiddlewareNotUsed('Startup complete')\n        else:\n            # If it's the auto-reloader process, disable the middleware immediately\n            raise MiddlewareNotUsed()\n```\n\nIn this code, `os.environ.get('RUN_MAIN') == 'true'` ensures that the code inside the block only runs in the main server process. The auto-reloader process will skip this block and immediately raise `MiddlewareNotUsed`, preventing \"Hello world\" from being printed twice. Note that this issue only affects the development server; it should not occur in a production deployment."
