However, the process crashes after parsing and I get an error message: 'failed to load external entity'. The error is related to the second line in the downloaded XML. This is the code I have so far:\n\n```python\nimport urllib2\nimport lxml.etree as etree\n\nfile = urllib2.urlopen(\"http://www.greenbuttondata.org/data/15MinLP_15Days.xml\")\ndata = file.read()\nfile.close()\n\ntree = etree.parse(data)\n```\nIs there a way to prevent the parser from trying to load the external entity, or is there another way to solve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the XML parser attempting to load an external entity, which can happen if the XML includes a DOCTYPE declaration or an external entity reference. To prevent this, you can parse the XML data using `lxml.etree.fromstring()` instead of `lxml.etree.parse()`, and disable the loading of external entities by using an `XMLParser` with the appropriate settings. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport urllib2\nimport lxml.etree as etree\n\n# Open the URL and read the XML data\nfile = urllib2.urlopen(\"http://www.greenbuttondata.org/data/15MinLP_15Days.xml\")\ndata = file.read()\nfile.close()\n\n# Create an XML parser that doesn't resolve external entities\nparser = etree.XMLParser(resolve_entities=False)\n\n# Parse the XML data from a string\ntree = etree.fromstring(data, parser=parser)\n\n# You can now work with 'tree' as an ElementTree object\n```\n\nBy using `etree.fromstring()` with a custom `XMLParser` that has `resolve_entities` set to `False`, you prevent the parser from trying to resolve and load any external entities, which should solve the issue you're facing."
