However, when I try to do this, gdb does not recognize the breakpoints placed on a Python script line. \n\nHere is what I tried:\n\n```shell\n$ gdb python\nGNU gdb (GDB) 7.3.50.20110806-cvs \n...\nReading symbols from /usr/bin/python...(no debugging symbols found)...done.\n(gdb) b test.py:3\nNo symbol table is loaded.  Use the \"file\" command.\nMake breakpoint pending on future shared library load? (y or [n]) y\n\nBreakpoint 1 (test.py:3) pending.\n(gdb) run test.py\nStarting program: /usr/bin/python test.py\n...\n```\n\nThough the Python script runs within gdb, the breakpoint is never reached.

        "content": "Debugging a Python script using `gdb` can be tricky because `gdb` is primarily a tool for debugging C/C++ binaries, and it doesn't inherently understand Python syntax or semantics. However, since you are interested in debugging the Python bindings of a shared object library, you can still use `gdb` to debug the C parts of your code. Here's a step-by-step guide to doing this effectively:\n\n### Steps to Debug Python with gdb\n\n1. **Compile the C/C++ Code with Debug Symbols:**\n   - Ensure that the shared object library (.so) is compiled with debug symbols. Use `-g` flag with `gcc` or `g++` during compilation.\n   - Example: `gcc -g -shared -o mylib.so mylib.c`\n\n2. **Use gdb to Start Python:**\n   - Start `gdb` with the Python executable, as you did.\n   ```shell\n   gdb python\n   ```\n\n3. **Set Breakpoints in C Code:**\n   - Instead of setting breakpoints in the Python script, set them in the C code. You can specify the source file and line number or function name.\n   - Example:\n   ```shell\n   (gdb) b my_c_function\n   ```\n\n4. **Run the Python Script:**\n   - Use the `run` command with your Python script as an argument.\n   ```shell\n   (gdb) run test.py\n   ```\n\n5. **Inspect Python Code:**\n   - While you can't directly set breakpoints in Python code, you can add `print` statements or use the Python debugger (`pdb`) to provide context about where you are in the Python execution.\n\n6. **Use gdb Python Extensions:**\n   - You can enhance the debugging experience by using `gdb` Python extensions, such as `gdb-7.2` or newer, which allow you to inspect Python objects.\n   - Load the Python extensions within `gdb`:\n   ```shell\n   (gdb) source /usr/share/gdb/python/gdbinit\n   ```\n\n7. **Alternative: Use pybind11 or Cython:**\n   - If you have control over the C extension, consider using `pybind11` or `Cython`, which might provide simpler ways to interface C/C++ with Python and often come with their own debugging utilities.\n\n### Alternative Tools for Debugging\n\n- **pdb (Python Debugger):**\n  - Use `pdb` to step through your Python code. You can invoke it by adding `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` at the desired location in your script.\n  - This won't help with the C part but is excellent for Python logic.\n\n- **gdb with Python Extensions:**\n  - Use the `gdb` Python extensions to introspect Python objects within `gdb`. This allows you to see Python stack frames, variables, and more.\n\n- **Valgrind:**\n  - Use Valgrind tools to check for memory errors in C extensions.\n\n- **lldb:**\n  - Similar to `gdb`, but often provides better support for debugging modern C++.\n\nBy combining these tools and strategies, you can effectively debug both the Python and C parts of your application."
