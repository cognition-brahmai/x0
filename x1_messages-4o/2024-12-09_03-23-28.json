I have written some simple multiprocessing code as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import Process, Manager\n\nmanager = Manager()\nd = manager.dict()\n\ndef f():\n    d[1].append(4)\n    print d\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    d[1] = []\n    p = Process(target=f)\n    p.start()\n    p.join()\n```\n\nWhen I run this code, the output I get is `{1: []}`. However, I expect to see `{1: [4]}`. Why isn't the result as expected?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how `multiprocessing.Manager` handles shared objects. When you create a shared dictionary using `Manager`, the dictionary itself is shared, but the objects inside it (like lists) are not automatically shared in the same way. This means that when you fetch `d[1]`, it returns a copy of the list, not the actual list stored in the manager dict. Any modifications to this copy won't be reflected in the manager dict.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. Modify the list in such a way that the manager dictionary knows about the change. You can achieve this by reassigning the list back to the dictionary after the modification.\n\n2. An alternative approach is to use a `Manager` list for the list you want to modify.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your code using the first approach:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import Process, Manager\n\ndef f(d):\n    temp_list = d[1]  # Get the list (a copy) from the manager dict\n    temp_list.append(4)  # Modify the copy\n    d[1] = temp_list  # Reassign the modified copy back to the manager dict\n    print(d)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    manager = Manager()\n    d = manager.dict()\n    d[1] = []  # Initialize the list in the manager dict\n    p = Process(target=f, args=(d,))\n    p.start()\n    p.join()\n\n    print(d)  # Output will be {1: [4]}\n```\n\nAlternatively, using a `Manager` list:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import Process, Manager\n\ndef f(d):\n    d[1].append(4)\n    print(d)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    manager = Manager()\n    d = manager.dict()\n    d[1] = manager.list()  # Use a Manager list\n    p = Process(target=f, args=(d,))\n    p.start()\n    p.join()\n\n    print(d)  # Output will be {1: [4]}\n```\n\nIn this alternative approach, by using `manager.list()`, you ensure that the list itself is managed and shared across processes, and modifications to it will be reflected in all processes."
