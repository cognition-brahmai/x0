The error occurs within my views.py file when I'm trying to assign values to the variable 'pack_size'. I have also provided my models.py and forms.py files for reference. Any idea what could be causing this issue?\n\nHere are the relevant code snippets:\n\nViews.py:\n\n```python\ndef storeliquor(request, store_id, liquor_id):        \n    #... (previous code omitted for brevity)\n    if c == \"1750 ML\":\n        pack_size = (\n            ('1', '1')\n            ('3', '3')\n            (b, b)\n            (h, h)\n            (d, d)\n            (e, e)\n            (r, r)\n        )\n    #... (rest of code omitted for brevity)\n```\n\nModels.py:\n\n```python\nclass LiquorOrder(models.Model):\n    LiquorOrderID = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)\n    storeliquorID = models.ForeignKey(StoreLiquor)\n    orderID = models.ForeignKey(Order)\n    OrderAmount = models.CharField('Order Amount', max_length=3)\n    TotalPrice = models.DecimalField('Total Price', max_digits=5, decimal_places=2)\n    StorePrice = models.DecimalField('Store Price', max_digits=5, decimal_places=2)\n```\n\nForms.py:\n\n```python\nclass AddToOrderForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    class Meta:\n        model = LiquorOrder\n        fields = ('OrderAmount', 'StorePrice')\n```"
    },

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `'TypeError: 'tuple' object is not callable'`, is likely due to a missing comma between the tuple elements in your `pack_size` assignment in the `views.py` file. In Python, tuples are defined by enclosing the items in parentheses and separating them with commas. If you forget a comma between two items, Python interprets it as a function call rather than a tuple, leading to the error you're seeing.\n\nHere's the corrected section of your `views.py` file:\n\n```python\ndef storeliquor(request, store_id, liquor_id):        \n    #... (previous code omitted for brevity)\n    if c == \"1750 ML\":\n        pack_size = (\n            ('1', '1'),\n            ('3', '3'),\n            (b, b),\n            (h, h),\n            (d, d),\n            (e, e),\n            (r, r),\n        )\n    #... (rest of code omitted for brevity)\n```\n\nBy adding commas after each tuple element, you properly define the `pack_size` as a tuple of tuples. This should resolve the `TypeError` you are encountering.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, ensure that variables like `b`, `h`, `d`, `e`, and `r` are defined elsewhere in your code, as they should hold values that are intended to be part of the `pack_size` choices."
