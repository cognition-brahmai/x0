The constants provided by numpy such as `np.finfo(np.float64).eps = 2.2204460492503131e-16` and `np.finfo(np.float64).tiny = 2.2250738585072014e-308` seem small but when I perform an operation like dividing by 2, the result seems even smaller. For example, when I do:\n\n```python\nx = np.finfo(np.float64).tiny\nx / 2\n```\nI get `6.9533558078350043e-310` which is smaller than the original number. Using a binary search, I can get down to about `1e-323`, at which point the value is rounded down to `0.0`. Is there a constant in numpy that represents this value, or is there a correct method to find this?"

        "content": "In NumPy, `np.finfo(np.float64).tiny` represents the smallest positive normalized number for a float64 data type, which is approximately \\(2.2250738585072014 \\times 10^{-308}\\). However, float64 can represent even smaller denormalized numbers, which are closer to zero, down to around \\(5 \\times 10^{-324}\\). These are sometimes referred to as subnormal numbers.\n\nWhen you divide `np.finfo(np.float64).tiny` by 2, you enter the realm of subnormal numbers. These numbers have less precision than normalized numbers, but they allow representation of values closer to zero.\n\nTo find the smallest positive representable float64 value, you can manually explore subnormal numbers like this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Start with the smallest denormalized number\nsmallest_positive = np.nextafter(0, 1, dtype=np.float64)\n\nprint(smallest_positive)\n```\n\nThe `np.nextafter` function is used here to find the next representable float64 value after 0 in the direction of 1, effectively giving you the smallest positive subnormal number. This is approximately \\(5 \\times 10^{-324}\\), which is the smallest positive float64 value that can be represented before hitting 0.0."
