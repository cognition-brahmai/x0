I am currently using `os.walk()` in my approach as shown in the code below:\n\n```python\nmyFolder = \"myfolder\"\nfileSet = set() # yes, I need a set()\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(myFolder):\n    for fileName in files:\n        fileSet.add(root.replace(myFolder, \"\") + os.sep + fileName)\n```\n\nHowever, this approach doesn't feel very \"pythonic\" to me. Can you suggest a better, more pythonic way to achieve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this in a more \"Pythonic\" way by using the `pathlib` module, which provides an object-oriented approach to handling filesystem paths. Here\u2019s how you can use it to get relative paths of files and subfolders within a specific folder:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nmyFolder = Path(\"myfolder\")\nfileSet = {str(file.relative_to(myFolder)) for file in myFolder.rglob('*') if file.is_file()}\n\nprint(fileSet)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`Path(\"myfolder\")`**: This creates a `Path` object for the specified directory.\n- **`myFolder.rglob('*')`**: This recursively finds all files and directories under `myfolder`. The `*` is a pattern that matches all files and directories.\n- **`file.is_file()`**: This filters the results to include only files.\n- **`file.relative_to(myFolder)`**: This gets the relative path of each file with respect to `myFolder`.\n- **`{...}`**: This is a set comprehension that collects all the relative paths into a set.\n\nThis approach is clean, concise, and leverages the powerful features of the `pathlib` module to handle paths in a more intuitive way."
