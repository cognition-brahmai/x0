You need to write a Python function that finds the largest number that is divisible by 3 and has a repeating digit. \nHere's the code you have so far:\ndef max_divisible_repeating(numbers):\n    max_num = None\n    for num in numbers:\n        # Check if number is divisible by 3\n        if num % 3 == 0:\n            # Check if number has repeating digit\n            for digit in str(num):\n                if str(num).count(digit) > 1:\n                    # Check if number is larger than current max\n                    if max_num is None or num > max_num:\n                        max_num = num\n                        break\n    return max_num\nHowever, you realize that this code is not efficient enough for large lists. Can you come up with a more efficient solution?"

        "content": "To improve the efficiency of the function, we can make some optimizations to reduce unnecessary computations. Here's a more efficient version:\n\n1. We can convert the number to a string once and reuse it, avoiding repeated conversions.\n2. Instead of checking each digit and counting its occurrences, we can use a set to track seen digits.\n3. We can break out of the loop as soon as we find a repeating digit.\n\nHere's the optimized code:\n\n```python\ndef max_divisible_repeating(numbers):\n    max_num = None\n    for num in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is divisible by 3\n        if num % 3 == 0:\n            num_str = str(num)\n            seen_digits = set()\n            has_repeating = False\n            # Check if the number has a repeating digit\n            for digit in num_str:\n                if digit in seen_digits:\n                    has_repeating = True\n                    break\n                seen_digits.add(digit)\n            # Update max_num if conditions are met\n            if has_repeating and (max_num is None or num > max_num):\n                max_num = num\n    return max_num\n```\n\n### Key Improvements:\n- **Set for Tracking Digits**: Using a set to track seen digits allows us to efficiently check for repeats.\n- **Break Early**: As soon as a repeating digit is found, we break out of the loop.\n- **Single Conversion**: Convert the number to a string once, rather than multiple times.\n\nThis code should be more efficient, especially for large lists, as it minimizes the number of operations for each number."
