This must hold true even when the phrase consists of white spaces, punctuations, and words written in both uppercase and lowercase letters. The algorithm should require multiple-step reasoning and must push the limits of your programming skills to the extreme."

        "content": "Creating an algorithm to detect a heteropalindrome phrase that retains its meaning when read backwards, accounting for spaces, punctuation, and case sensitivity, requires a comprehensive approach. Below is a step-by-step guide to constructing such an algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\nimport string\n\ndef is_heteropalindrome(phrase):\n    # Step 1: Normalize the phrase\n    def normalize(phrase):\n        # Remove punctuation using str.translate\n        phrase = phrase.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))\n        # Convert to lower case\n        phrase = phrase.lower()\n        # Remove spaces\n        phrase = phrase.replace(' ', '')\n        return phrase\n\n    # Step 2: Check if a phrase is a palindrome\n    def is_palindrome(normalized_phrase):\n        return normalized_phrase == normalized_phrase[::-1]\n\n    # Step 3: Normalize the input phrase\n    normalized_phrase = normalize(phrase)\n\n    # Step 4: Check if the normalized phrase is a palindrome\n    if is_palindrome(normalized_phrase):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Example usage\nphrases = [\n    \"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama\",\n    \"No 'x' in Nixon\",\n    \"Was it a car or a cat I saw?\",\n    \"Madam, in Eden, I'm Adam\",\n    \"Not a palindrome\"\n]\n\nresults = {phrase: is_heteropalindrome(phrase) for phrase in phrases}\n\nfor phrase, result in results.items():\n    print(f\"'{phrase}' is a heteropalindrome: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Normalization**: The `normalize` function cleans the phrase by removing punctuation (using `str.translate` and `string.punctuation`), converting all characters to lowercase, and removing spaces. This ensures that the comparison is fair and not affected by non-alphanumeric characters or case differences.\n\n2. **Palindrome Check**: The `is_palindrome` function checks if the normalized phrase reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\n3. **Integration**: The `is_heteropalindrome` function ties it all together by normalizing the input and then checking if the normalized string is a palindrome.\n\n4. **Example Usage**: The script includes examples to demonstrate how the algorithm works with various phrases, showing whether they qualify as heteropalindromes.\n\nThis algorithm provides a robust way to detect heteropalindromes, taking into account multiple complexities like case sensitivity and punctuation, and employs a clear multi-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution."
