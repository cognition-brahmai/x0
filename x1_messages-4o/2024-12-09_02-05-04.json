However, whenever I use the `pd.to_csv('C:/Path of file.csv')` command, the resulting CSV file includes an extra column of indexes that I don't want. I've tried using `pd.read_csv('C:/Path to file to edit.csv', index_col = False)` to read the file, and `pd.to_csv('C:/Path to save edited file.csv', index_col = False)` to save it, but I still end up with the unwanted index column. How can I avoid this?"

        "content": "To prevent pandas from creating an index column when saving a DataFrame to a CSV file, you should use the `index` parameter in the `to_csv` method, setting it to `False`. The `index_col` parameter is actually used when reading a CSV file to specify which column to use as the index, not when writing.\n\nHere's how you can save your DataFrame to a CSV file without including the index:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame, without using any column as the index\ndf = pd.read_csv('C:/Path to file to edit.csv', index_col=False)\n\n# Perform any modifications to the DataFrame as needed\n\n# Save the DataFrame to a CSV file without the index\ndf.to_csv('C:/Path to save edited file.csv', index=False)\n```\n\nBy setting `index=False` in the `to_csv` method, pandas will not write the index to the CSV file, thus preventing the creation of an extra index column. Make sure you're applying this parameter correctly when saving your DataFrame."
