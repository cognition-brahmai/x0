I'm now trying to find out if Python provides a similar feature, but I'm struggling to find any specific information confirming or denying this."

        "content": "Yes, Python does support prepared statements when interacting with MySQL databases. You can use the `mysql-connector-python` library or the popular `PyMySQL` library to work with MySQL databases in Python. Both libraries offer support for prepared statements, which can help improve the performance and security of your database queries.\n\nHere's an example of how to use prepared statements with `mysql-connector-python`:\n\n```python\nimport mysql.connector\n\n# Establish a connection to the database\nconnection = mysql.connector.connect(\n    host='localhost',\n    user='your_username',\n    password='your_password',\n    database='your_database'\n)\n\n# Create a cursor object\ncursor = connection.cursor(prepared=True)\n\n# Define a query using placeholders\nquery = \"SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE column1 = %s AND column2 = %s\"\n\n# Execute the query with parameters\ncursor.execute(query, (value1, value2))\n\n# Fetch the results\nresults = cursor.fetchall()\n\n# Process the results\nfor row in results:\n    print(row)\n\n# Close the cursor and connection\ncursor.close()\nconnection.close()\n```\n\nAnd with `PyMySQL`, the approach is similar:\n\n```python\nimport pymysql\n\n# Establish a connection to the database\nconnection = pymysql.connect(\n    host='localhost',\n    user='your_username',\n    password='your_password',\n    database='your_database'\n)\n\n# Create a cursor object\ncursor = connection.cursor()\n\n# Define a query using placeholders\nquery = \"SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE column1 = %s AND column2 = %s\"\n\n# Execute the query with parameters\ncursor.execute(query, (value1, value2))\n\n# Fetch the results\nresults = cursor.fetchall()\n\n# Process the results\nfor row in results:\n    print(row)\n\n# Close the cursor and connection\ncursor.close()\nconnection.close()\n```\n\nUsing prepared statements not only helps in optimizing query performance by allowing MySQL to parse and compile the queries just once, but also improves security by preventing SQL injection attacks."
