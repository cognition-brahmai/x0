        "content": "In Django, both `Model.id` and `Model.pk` essentially refer to the primary key of a model instance. However, there are subtle differences and some important points to understand:\n\n1. **Model.id**:\n   - By default, Django automatically adds an `id` field as the primary key to your models if you don't explicitly specify a primary key.\n   - `Model.id` is a direct reference to this default primary key field.\n   - If you define your own primary key field, the `id` attribute will not exist unless you specifically name your primary key field `id`.\n\n2. **Model.pk**:\n   - `Model.pk` is a more abstract way to refer to the primary key of a model instance.\n   - It always gives you the value of the primary key field, whatever the field name might be. So, if you have defined a custom primary key like `user_id`, `Model.pk` will refer to `user_id`.\n   - Using `pk` is generally preferred for the sake of abstraction and flexibility, especially if you might change the primary key field in the future.\n\nRegarding the Django documentation:\n\n- The Django documentation does not cover every single method of its classes in detail. It focuses on the most commonly used methods and attributes, providing examples and explanations for those.\n- Some methods and attributes might be part of Django\u2019s internal API or inherited from Python\u2019s standard libraries, so they might not be explicitly documented in Django's official documentation.\n- For comprehensive understanding, sometimes you might need to look at the Django source code or community resources like Django packages, forums, or more detailed tutorials.\n\nOverall, it's good practice to use `pk` for primary key references in Django models to maintain flexibility and readability in your code."
