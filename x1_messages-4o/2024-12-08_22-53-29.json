For the purpose of this example, let's assume you have a file named `gibbons_data.txt` that contains the weight and height data of adult gibbons in a structured format, such as:\n\n```\n12 45\n13 46\n14 44\n```\n\nwhere the first column represents weight (in kg) and the second column represents height (in cm).\n\nHere's a sample shell command that calculates the average weight and height and forms a sentence in the past tense:\n\n```bash\nawk '{ weight+=$1; height+=$2; count++ } END { avg_weight=weight/count; avg_height=height/count; printf \"The average weight was %.2f kg and the average height was %.2f cm.\\n\", avg_weight, avg_height }' gibbons_data.txt\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `awk` is used to process the data.\n- `weight+=$1` and `height+=$2` accumulate the total weight and height.\n- `count++` tracks the number of entries.\n- In the `END` block, the averages are calculated and a formatted sentence is printed using `printf`, which outputs the sentence in the past tense."
