Can you please guide me on how to correctly write a lambda function that can accommodate multiple lines?\n\n```\nd = lambda x: if x:\n                 return 1\n              else \n                 return 2\n```"

        "content": "Lambda functions in Python are designed to be simple, single-expression functions. They are limited to expressions rather than statements, which means you cannot include multi-line constructs like `if-else` statements with `return` statements directly within a lambda.\n\nHowever, you can use a conditional expression (also known as a ternary operator) to achieve similar functionality in a single line. Here is how you can rewrite your logic using a lambda function with a conditional expression:\n\n```python\nd = lambda x: 1 if x else 2\n```\n\nIn this example, `1 if x else 2` is a single expression: it returns `1` if `x` is truthy, otherwise it returns `2`.\n\nIf you need more complex logic that requires multiple lines, it's typically better to define a regular function using `def`. Here's how you can rewrite it as a normal function:\n\n```python\ndef d(x):\n    if x:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 2\n```\n\nUsing a regular function allows for more complex, multi-line logic and is generally more readable for complex operations."
