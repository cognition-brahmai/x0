        "content": "In Python, the idiomatic way to handle getters and setters is by using properties. The `@property` decorator allows you to define a method as a getter, and the `@<property_name>.setter` decorator allows you to define a method as a setter. This way, you can maintain the simplicity of attribute access while still providing the encapsulation and control of getter and setter methods.\n\nHere's a simple example to demonstrate how you can use properties in Python:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self._value = value  # Use a private attribute to store the value\n\n    @property\n    def value(self):\n        \"\"\"Getter method.\"\"\"\n        return self._value\n\n    @value.setter\n    def value(self, new_value):\n        \"\"\"Setter method.\"\"\"\n        if isinstance(new_value, int):  # Example validation\n            self._value = new_value\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Value must be an integer\")\n\n# Usage\nobj = MyClass(10)\nprint(obj.value)  # Accessing the getter\nobj.value = 20    # Using the setter\nprint(obj.value)\n\ntry:\n    obj.value = \"string\"  # This will raise a ValueError\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Encapsulation**: Use a private attribute (e.g., `_value`) to store the actual data. This protects the data from being accessed or modified directly.\n   \n2. **Getter**: Use the `@property` decorator to define a method that will act as a getter. You can include any necessary logic, such as validation or transformation, within this method.\n\n3. **Setter**: Use the `@<property_name>.setter` decorator to define a method that will act as a setter. This method can include logic for validating or transforming the input before setting the value.\n\n4. **Pythonic Style**: This approach maintains the clean, simple syntax of attribute access (`obj.value`) while allowing you to implement additional logic as needed.\n\nBy using properties, you get the benefits of encapsulation and control without sacrificing the simplicity and readability of your code."
