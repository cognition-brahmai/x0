        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the way you're trying to handle the many-to-many relationship between `SurveyResult` and `SurveyThread`. In Django, many-to-many relationships need to have both sides saved to the database before you can associate them with each other. \n\nHere's a breakdown of how to resolve this issue:\n\n### Issue Explanation\n\n1. **Many-to-Many Relationships:** In your `SurveyThread` model, you have a `ManyToManyField` linking to `SurveyResult`. This means that an instance of `SurveyThread` can be associated with multiple `SurveyResult` instances and vice versa.\n\n2. **Error Cause:** When you create a new `SurveyThread` and try to associate it with a `SurveyResult` using the `ManyToManyField` before the `SurveyThread` is saved to the database, Django raises an error because it doesn't yet have a primary key to use in the relationship.\n\n### Solution\n\nYou need to save the `SurveyThread` object first before adding it to the `ManyToManyField` relationship. Here are the changes you can make:\n\n#### Update the `save` method in `SurveyThreadForm`\n\n```python\ndef save(self, commit=True):\n    # Create a new SurveyThread instance\n    s = SurveyThread()\n    s.email = \"test@test.com\"\n    s.comment = self.cleaned_data['comment']\n\n    if commit:\n        # Save the SurveyThread instance first\n        s.save()\n        \n        # After saving, add the SurveyResult to the ManyToManyField\n        s.survey.add(self.survey)\n\n    return s\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. **Create and Save the `SurveyThread` Instance:** \n   - Create an instance of `SurveyThread` and set its fields.\n   - Call `s.save()` to save it to the database. This assigns a primary key to `s`, which is necessary for the many-to-many relationship.\n\n2. **Add the `SurveyResult`:**\n   - After saving the `SurveyThread`, use `s.survey.add(self.survey)` to associate the `SurveyResult` with the `SurveyThread`.\n\n#### Additional Notes\n\n- **Ensure Consistent Data:** Make sure that the `SurveyResult` instance (`self.survey`) is already saved to the database before you attempt to associate it.\n- **Validation:** Ensure that your form validation handles cases where the `SurveyResult` is missing or not valid.\n\nBy making these adjustments, you should be able to resolve the error and successfully save the form with the many-to-many relationship intact."
