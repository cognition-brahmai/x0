Can you provide an example of how to calculate it using Python code?\nThe formula for sum of squares in regression analysis is:\nSS = \u03a3(yi - \u0233)^2\nwhere yi is the observed value of the dependent variable, \u0233 is the mean of the dependent variable, and \u03a3 represents the sum of the values.\nHere is an example of how to calculate the sum of squares using Python code:\nimport numpy as np\n# Create some sample data\nx = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\ny = np.array([3, 5, 7, 9, 11])\n# Calculate the mean of y\ny_mean = np.mean(y)\n# Calculate the sum of squares\nss = np.sum((y - y_mean)**2)\nprint(\"Sum of Squares:\", ss)\nThis will output the sum of squares for the sample data."

        "content": "The formula you've provided is for calculating the Total Sum of Squares (SST) in regression analysis. This measures the total variation in the dependent variable `y`. Let's break it down further and also look into other components of sum of squares in regression:\n\n1. **Total Sum of Squares (SST):** Measures the total variation in the observed data.\n   \\[\n   SST = \\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Regression Sum of Squares (SSR):** Measures the variation explained by the regression model.\n   \\[\n   SSR = \\sum (\\hat{y}_i - \\bar{y})^2\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) is the predicted value from the model.\n\n3. **Error Sum of Squares (SSE):** Measures the variation not explained by the model.\n   \\[\n   SSE = \\sum (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n   \\]\n\nThe relationship between these is:\n\\[ \nSST = SSR + SSE \n\\]\n\nHere's how you can calculate these using Python with a simple linear regression example:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\n# Sample data\nx = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).reshape(-1, 1)  # Reshape for sklearn\ny = np.array([3, 5, 7, 9, 11])\n\n# Calculate mean of y\ny_mean = np.mean(y)\n\n# Fit linear regression model\nmodel = LinearRegression().fit(x, y)\ny_pred = model.predict(x)\n\n# Calculate SST\nsst = np.sum((y - y_mean)**2)\n\n# Calculate SSR\nssr = np.sum((y_pred - y_mean)**2)\n\n# Calculate SSE\nsse = np.sum((y - y_pred)**2)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(\"Total Sum of Squares (SST):\", sst)\nprint(\"Regression Sum of Squares (SSR):\", ssr)\nprint(\"Error Sum of Squares (SSE):\", sse)\n\n# Verify SST = SSR + SSE\nprint(\"SST equals SSR + SSE:\", np.isclose(sst, ssr + sse))\n```\n\nThis code uses a simple linear regression model from `scikit-learn` to make predictions, and then calculates the SST, SSR, and SSE. The final print statement checks the relationship between them to ensure the calculations are correct."
