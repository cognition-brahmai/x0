Since SQL doesn't inherently understand the order of meals, you can use a CASE statement to specify this custom sorting order. Here's an example query assuming you're using a SQL-based database:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Food, Meal\nFROM foods\nORDER BY\n  CASE\n    WHEN Meal = 'Breakfast' THEN 1\n    WHEN Meal = 'Lunch/Dinner' THEN 2\n    ELSE 3\n  END;\n```\n\nThis query assigns a number to each meal type based on the time of day it should be consumed, with Breakfast being the earliest, followed by Lunch/Dinner. The `ORDER BY` clause then sorts the rows based on these numbers."
