        "content": "How is the R2 value calculated in Scikit-learn's `metrics.r2_score()` function? The documentation mentions that the R\u00b2 score may be negative and it need not actually be the square of a quantity R. However, the Wikipedia article on R\u00b2 doesn't mention any R (not squared) quantity. I'm confused about whether Scikit-learn uses absolute differences instead of square differences. Could someone clarify this?"

        "content": "The R\u00b2 value, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure used to assess how well a model's predictions approximate the actual data. In Scikit-learn, the `metrics.r2_score()` function calculates this value based on the following formula:\n\n\\[ R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum (y_{\\text{true}} - y_{\\text{pred}})^2}{\\sum (y_{\\text{true}} - \\bar{y}_{\\text{true}})^2} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( y_{\\text{true}} \\) is the actual data.\n- \\( y_{\\text{pred}} \\) is the predicted data from the model.\n- \\( \\bar{y}_{\\text{true}} \\) is the mean of the actual data.\n\nThe numerator, \\(\\sum (y_{\\text{true}} - y_{\\text{pred}})^2\\), is the residual sum of squares (RSS), which measures the variance of the errors (differences between observed and predicted values). The denominator, \\(\\sum (y_{\\text{true}} - \\bar{y}_{\\text{true}})^2\\), is the total sum of squares (TSS), which measures the total variance in the actual data.\n\nThe R\u00b2 value essentially represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). An R\u00b2 of 1 indicates that the model perfectly predicts the data, while an R\u00b2 of 0 suggests that the model does no better than simply predicting the mean of the observed data. A negative R\u00b2 implies that the model is performing worse than a horizontal line (the mean of the observed data).\n\nRegarding your confusion with Wikipedia, the R\u00b2 value is not necessarily the square of a specific correlation coefficient R in the context of regression analysis, which might be the source of confusion. The term \"R\u00b2\" is a convention used to denote this specific statistical measure and is not directly linked to a square of a correlation coefficient in this context.\n\nScikit-learn does not use absolute differences; it uses squared differences, as shown in the formula. This is standard for calculating R\u00b2 in regression analysis."
