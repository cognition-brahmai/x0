        "content": "I am trying to find a method to split the text lines in a scanned document that has been adaptive thresholded. Currently, I am storing the pixel values of the document as unsigned ints from 0 to 255, and I am taking the average of the pixels in each line, splitting the lines into ranges based on whether the average of the pixels values is larger than 250, and then I take the median of each range of lines for which this holds. However, this method sometimes fails due to black splotches on the image. Is there a more noise-resistant way to accomplish this task? Here is some code for reference where \"warped\" is the original image and \"cuts\" is where I want to split the image.\n\n```python\nwarped = threshold_adaptive(warped, 250, offset = 10)\nwarped = warped.astype(\"uint8\") * 255\n\n# get areas where we can split image on whitespace to make OCR more accurate\ncolor_level = np.array([np.sum(line) / len(line) for line in warped])\ncuts = []\ni = 0\nwhile(i < len(color_level)):\n    if color_level[i] > 250:\n        begin = i\n        while(color_level[i] > 250):\n            i += 1\n        cuts.append((i + begin)/2) # middle of the whitespace region\n    else:\n        i += 1\n```\n\nHere is a sample image for reference: [Link to sample image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sxRq9.jpg)"

        "content": "To improve the robustness of your line detection method and make it more resistant to noise such as black splotches, you can consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Morphological Operations**: Before calculating the average pixel values, apply morphological operations like opening (erosion followed by dilation) to remove noise. This can help clean up small artifacts and splotches. You can use `cv2.morphologyEx` with a suitable kernel.\n\n    ```python\n    import cv2\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Define a kernel size based on your image size\n    kernel = np.ones((3, 3), np.uint8)\n    warped = cv2.morphologyEx(warped, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel)\n    ```\n\n2. **Connected Components Analysis**: Use connected components to identify and filter out small noise regions. This approach can help you focus only on larger text regions.\n\n    ```python\n    num_labels, labels_im = cv2.connectedComponents(warped)\n    # Filter out small components based on a size threshold\n    ```\n\n3. **Projection Profile**: Instead of using a simple average, consider using a projection profile. This involves summing pixel values across rows (horizontal projection) to detect lines. It's more robust against small noise.\n\n    ```python\n    projection = np.sum(warped, axis=1) / 255  # normalize if needed\n    ```\n\n4. **Adaptive Threshold Parameters**: You might need to fine-tune the parameters of your adaptive thresholding to better suit the document. Consider adjusting the block size and offset.\n\n5. **Use Median Filtering**: Apply a median filter to the projection profile to reduce the impact of noise.\n\n    ```python\n    from scipy.ndimage import median_filter\n\n    projection_filtered = median_filter(projection, size=5)\n    ```\n\n6. **Dynamic Thresholding for Cuts**: Instead of a fixed threshold of 250, use a dynamic threshold based on the image's characteristics, such as the mean or median of the projection profile.\n\n7. **Hough Transform for Line Detection**: As a more advanced approach, consider using the Hough Line Transform, which is robust to noise and can detect line structures.\n\n8. **Machine Learning Approach**: For a more complex solution, consider using a machine learning model trained to detect and segment text lines, such as a CNN or a custom OCR solution.\n\nBy combining these techniques, you should be able to improve the accuracy of line splitting in your scanned documents."
