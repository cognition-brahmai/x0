How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "In PyTorch, the `torch.dot()` function is specifically designed for 1-dimensional tensors (vectors), not for 2-dimensional tensors (matrices). To perform matrix multiplication with 2D tensors, you should use the `torch.matmul()` function or the `@` operator. Here's how you can modify your code to perform matrix multiplication in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\na = torch.ones((3, 2))\nb = torch.ones((2, 1))\nresult = torch.matmul(a, b)\n\n# Alternatively, you can use the @ operator for matrix multiplication\n# result = a @ b\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nBoth `torch.matmul(a, b)` and `a @ b` will correctly perform matrix multiplication with the given matrices `a` and `b`."
