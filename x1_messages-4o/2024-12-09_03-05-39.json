This allows you to import a module with a long name and give it a shorter alias, making your code more readable and easier to work with. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport a_ridiculously_long_module_name as short_name\n```\n\nAfter this import statement, you can use `short_name` to refer to `a_ridiculously_long_module_name` in your code. For example:\n\n```python\nresult = short_name.some_function()\n```\n\nThis approach is commonly used to make code cleaner, especially when dealing with modules that have long or cumbersome names."
