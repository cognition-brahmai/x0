Originally, I attempted to store `datetime.datetime` objects, but decided to shift to using a UNIX timestamp as they are just integers. Despite this change, I'm still encountering errors. I'm trying to retrieve the records later using comparisons like `SELECT * WHERE date1 < date2`. However, I'm getting a ValueError indicating that 'parameters are of unsupported type'. Here's the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3 as lite\nimport datetime\nimport time\n\nconn = lite.connect('dispatcher.db')\ncur = conn.cursor()\nquery = \"create table if not exists new_test (curent_dt)\"\ncur.execute(query)\nconn.commit()\nnow = datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(minutes=60)\ntemp = int(time.mktime(now.timetuple()))\ncur.execute('insert into new_test (curent_dt) values (? )', (temp))\nconn.commit()\nconn.close()\n```\n\nAnd here's the error I'm getting:\n\n```python\ncur.execute('insert into new_test (curent_dt) values (? )', (temp))\nValueError: parameters are of unsupported type\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to how the parameters are being passed to the SQL query. In SQLite, when using placeholders (`?`) in a query, the parameters need to be passed as a tuple. In your code, the `temp` variable is an integer, but it should be inside a tuple even if there's only one parameter. \n\nHere's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3 as lite\nimport datetime\nimport time\n\nconn = lite.connect('dispatcher.db')\ncur = conn.cursor()\nquery = \"create table if not exists new_test (curent_dt INTEGER)\"\ncur.execute(query)\nconn.commit()\n\nnow = datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(minutes=60)\ntemp = int(time.mktime(now.timetuple()))\n\n# Ensure `temp` is a tuple, even with a single element\ncur.execute('insert into new_test (curent_dt) values (?)', (temp,))\nconn.commit()\nconn.close()\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Tuple with a Single Element:** In the line where you execute the insert statement, ensure that `temp` is passed as a tuple by adding a comma after `temp` like this: `(temp,)`.\n\n2. **Column Type Declaration:** Although SQLite is dynamically typed, it's good practice to define the column types. Here, the column `curent_dt` is defined as `INTEGER`.\n\nWith these changes, your code should work without raising the `ValueError`. This should allow you to store UNIX timestamps in your SQLite database correctly."
