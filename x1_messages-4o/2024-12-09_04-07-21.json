        "content": "In a Python project that I worked on, I utilized the `logging` module quite extensively. However, I had to manually comment out many logging calls in the code, particularly in inner-loop-like sections, due to the overhead they caused. Is there a systematic way to eliminate logging calls in Python applications without having to manually comment and uncomment them all the time? Ideally, I'd like to use inspection/recompilation or bytecode manipulation to target only the code objects that are causing bottlenecks. This would allow me to add a manipulator as a post-compilation step and use a centralized configuration file. I would want to use this sparingly and with per-function granularity, only for code objects where `logging` has proven to be a bottleneck. Is there a solution for this?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this by using a combination of Python's introspection capabilities and dynamic code manipulation. Here's a high-level approach:\n\n1. **Use Decorators**: You can create a decorator that conditionally disables logging based on some criteria. This can be applied to specific functions where logging is a bottleneck.\n\n2. **Modify Bytecode**: For a more advanced solution, you can manipulate the bytecode of Python functions to remove or disable logging calls. This can be done using libraries such as `bytecode` or `codetransformer`.\n\n3. **Centralized Configuration**: Use a configuration file to specify which functions should have logging disabled. This can be as simple as a JSON file mapping function names to a boolean indicating whether logging should be disabled.\n\n4. **Post-Compilation Step**: Implement a script that reads the configuration file and applies the bytecode modifications to the specified functions. This script can be run as a post-compilation step.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might implement a decorator approach:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport functools\n\ndef conditional_logging(enable_logging=True):\n    def decorator(func):\n        @functools.wraps(func)\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            if enable_logging:\n                return func(*args, **kwargs)\n            else:\n                # Temporarily disable logging\n                logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)\n                try:\n                    return func(*args, **kwargs)\n                finally:\n                    # Re-enable logging\n                    logging.disable(logging.NOTSET)\n        return wrapper\n    return decorator\n\n# Example usage:\n@conditional_logging(enable_logging=False)\ndef my_function():\n    logging.info(\"This will not be logged if logging is disabled.\")\n    # Function logic...\n\n# Centralized configuration\nconfig = {\n    'my_function': False\n}\n\n# Apply decorators based on configuration\nmy_function = conditional_logging(config['my_function'])(my_function)\n```\n\nFor bytecode manipulation, you'll need to delve into libraries that allow you to manipulate Python's bytecode. Here's a brief overview of how you might use the `bytecode` library:\n\n```python\nfrom bytecode import Bytecode, Instr, InstrList\n\ndef remove_logging_calls(code_obj):\n    bytecode = Bytecode.from_code(code_obj)\n    new_instructions = InstrList()\n\n    for instr in bytecode:\n        if instr.opname == 'CALL_FUNCTION' and 'logging' in instr.argval:\n            # Skip logging calls\n            continue\n        new_instructions.append(instr)\n\n    bytecode.clear()\n    bytecode.extend(new_instructions)\n    return bytecode.to_code()\n\n# Usage: modify the code object of specific functions\nmy_function.__code__ = remove_logging_calls(my_function.__code__)\n```\n\nNote that bytecode manipulation is more complex and should be used with caution. It's important to thoroughly test any changes to ensure they don't inadvertently alter the behavior of your program."
