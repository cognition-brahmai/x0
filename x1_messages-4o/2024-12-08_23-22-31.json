The process can be described as follows:\n% 1. Sunlight contains all colors of the visible spectrum, but shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered more easily by the molecules in the atmosphere.\n% 2. As sunlight enters the atmosphere, the blue and violet wavelengths are scattered in all directions, including towards the Earth's surface.\n% 3. This scattered blue light is what we see when we look up at the sky during the day.\n% 4. The scattering effect is also why the sky appears reddish during sunrise and sunset, when the sunlight must pass through more of the Earth's atmosphere to reach us.\nSo, can you explain why the sky is blue using a MATLAB code comment with a similar explanation?"

        "content": "Certainly! Here is an explanation of why the sky appears blue, described in the form of a MATLAB code comment:\n\n```matlab\n% In this simulation, we model the Rayleigh scattering phenomenon responsible for the blue sky:\n% 1. Sunlight is composed of a spectrum of colors, each with different wavelengths.\n% 2. As sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with air molecules and small particles.\n% 3. Shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue (around 450-495 nm), are scattered more efficiently than longer wavelengths (like red) due to the inverse fourth power dependence on wavelength.\n% 4. Although violet light is scattered even more than blue, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light and some violet is absorbed by the ozone layer, making the sky appear predominantly blue.\n% 5. During sunrise and sunset, the sun is lower on the horizon, causing sunlight to pass through a thicker layer of the atmosphere, scattering shorter wavelengths out of the direct path and allowing longer wavelengths (reds and oranges) to dominate the view, creating the observed reddish sky.\n```"
