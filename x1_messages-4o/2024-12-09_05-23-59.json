It works perfectly fine with Python 2.x, but I'm encountering an error when testing it with Python 3. The code is as follows:\n\n```python\ndepend = None\nif not nmake:\n    depend = open(\".depend\", \"a\")\ndependmak = open(\".depend.mak\", \"a\")\ndepend = open(\".depend\", \"a\")\nprint >>depend, s,\n```\n\nThe error I'm receiving is:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"../../../../config/makedepend.py\", line 121, in <module>\n    print >>depend, s,\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for >>:\n  'builtin_function_or_method' and '_io.TextIOWrapper'\n```\n\nWhat is the optimal way to make this code compatible with both Python 2.x and 3.x versions?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the difference in how the `print` statement works between Python 2 and Python 3. In Python 2, `print` is a statement and supports the syntax `print >> file, content` to redirect output to a file. However, in Python 3, `print` is a function and the syntax has changed.\n\nTo make the code compatible with both Python 2.x and 3.x, you can use the `__future__` module to import the `print_function` from Python 3 into Python 2, and then use the `file` argument of the `print` function to specify the file you want to write to. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import print_function  # Importing the print function from Python 3\n\ndepend = None\nif not nmake:\n    depend = open(\".depend\", \"a\")\ndependmak = open(\".depend.mak\", \"a\")\ndepend = open(\".depend\", \"a\")\nprint(s, file=depend, end='')  # Using the print function with file and end arguments\n```\n\nKey changes:\n- Use `from __future__ import print_function` at the top of your script to enable the use of the `print` function in Python 2.\n- Replace `print >>depend, s,` with `print(s, file=depend, end='')` to explicitly specify the file and use the `end` parameter to avoid adding an extra newline character, which mimics the behavior of the trailing comma in Python 2.\n\nThis change should make your code work in both Python 2 and 3 environments."
