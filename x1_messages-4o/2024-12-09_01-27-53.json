While using Tesla or Fermi architecture, if a single warp tries to fetch elements of A at random, what is the expected number of bank conflicts? Here's what I have:\n\n```c\n__shared__ int A[N];          //N is some big constant integer\n...\nint v = A[ random(0..N-1) ];  // <-- expected number of bank conflicts here?\n```\n\nI am assuming all the random numbers are different, thus no broadcast mechanism. I am looking for a mathematical evaluation of the expected number of bank conflicts, but I'm not sure how to calculate it. I've tried to abstract the problem out from CUDA and look at it as a math problem, even searching it as an extension to the Birthday Paradox, but I found really complicated formulas and didn't find a final formula. Can you help me find a simpler way to calculate the expected number of bank conflicts in shared memory at random access?"

        "content": "To calculate the expected number of bank conflicts when accessing shared memory in CUDA, we need to consider how the shared memory is organized and how accesses are distributed across banks. In CUDA's Tesla and Fermi architectures, shared memory is divided into banks, and each bank can service only one request at a time. If multiple threads in a warp access the same bank, bank conflicts occur.\n\nAssuming that the shared memory has 32 banks (as was common in these architectures), each 32-bit integer will be mapped to a specific bank. The bank index is typically determined by the address of the element modulo the number of banks. When accesses are random, each thread's access can be considered as a random draw from the available banks.\n\nHere's how you can think about the problem mathematically:\n\n1. **Random Distribution Across Banks**: If each of the 32 threads in a warp accesses an element randomly, each access is equally likely to hit any of the 32 banks.\n\n2. **Expected Bank Conflicts**: The problem is analogous to distributing 32 balls (accesses) into 32 bins (banks) randomly. We want to calculate the expected number of bins that have more than one ball, which would correspond to bank conflicts.\n\n3. **Using Probability**: For each bank:\n   - The probability that exactly one thread accesses a particular bank is given by a binomial distribution.\n   - The probability of a bank conflict (more than one access) is complementary to the probability that zero or one thread accesses the bank.\n\n4. **Expected Number of Conflicts**: You can use the formula for expected number of bins with more than one ball:\n\n   \\[\n   E(\\text{conflicts}) = 32 - \\sum_{k=0}^{1} \\binom{32}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{32} \\right)^k \\left( \\frac{31}{32} \\right)^{32-k}\n   \\]\n\n   - The term \\(\\binom{32}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{32} \\right)^k \\left( \\frac{31}{32} \\right)^{32-k}\\) represents the probability that exactly \\(k\\) threads access a specific bank.\n\n5. **Simplifying the Calculation**: Since the calculations can be complex due to combinatorics, you can use approximations or simulations to estimate the number of conflicts more easily.\n\nBy considering the above points, you can derive an estimate for the expected number of bank conflicts. Typically, with completely random access, you can expect several bank conflicts due to the likelihood of multiple threads accessing the same bank, but this exact number can vary based on access patterns and random distribution."
