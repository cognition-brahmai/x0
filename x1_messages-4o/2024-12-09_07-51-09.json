Sometimes, these spawned processes get stuck and use up to 99% of the CPU. I'm considering using nice and ulimit, but I'm not sure how they would interact with subprocess. The limits I want to impose are: 1) kill the process if it takes more than 60 seconds; and 2) limit it to using only 20% of the CPU. I want these resource limits to apply only to the subprocess, not the Python process that spawns the subprocesses. Is there a way to apply nice and ulimit to a subprocess.call spawned process? Are there any better Python-native alternatives that I can use? I'm currently using a Linux Ubuntu system."

        "content": "To achieve your goals of limiting time and CPU usage for subprocesses in Python, you can consider a combination of approaches. While `nice` and `ulimit` are useful in certain contexts, they might not fully address your needs when using `subprocess.call`. Below are some Python-native solutions and techniques you can use:\n\n### 1. Limiting Execution Time\n\nYou can use the `timeout` parameter available in Python 3.5+ for functions like `subprocess.run` to automatically terminate a process if it exceeds a specified duration.\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ntry:\n    result = subprocess.run(\n        ['your_command', 'arg1', 'arg2'],\n        timeout=60,  # Timeout in seconds\n        check=True\n    )\nexcept subprocess.TimeoutExpired:\n    print(\"Process exceeded the time limit and was terminated.\")\nexcept subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\n    print(f\"Process returned a non-zero exit code: {e.returncode}\")\n```\n\n### 2. Limiting CPU Usage\n\nTo limit CPU usage, you can use the `cgroups` feature in Linux, which allows you to control resource allocation for processes. This requires some setup outside of Python, but you can manage it programmatically.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `psutil` library to monitor and enforce CPU limits:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nimport psutil\nimport time\nimport os\n\ndef limit_cpu_usage(pid, max_cpu_percent):\n    process = psutil.Process(pid)\n    while True:\n        cpu_usage = process.cpu_percent(interval=1)\n        if cpu_usage > max_cpu_percent:\n            process.suspend()\n            time.sleep(1)\n            process.resume()\n        time.sleep(1)\n\nprocess = subprocess.Popen(['your_command', 'arg1', 'arg2'])\ntry:\n    limit_cpu_usage(process.pid, max_cpu_percent=20)\n    process.wait(timeout=60)\nexcept subprocess.TimeoutExpired:\n    process.terminate()\n    print(\"Process exceeded the time limit and was terminated.\")\nexcept psutil.NoSuchProcess:\n    pass\n```\n\n### 3. Using `nice` and `ulimit`\n\nYou can set the `nice` value and `ulimit` constraints by prefixing your command with them, using shell=True:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ncommand = \"ulimit -t 60; nice -n 10 your_command arg1 arg2\"\nsubprocess.run(command, shell=True)\n```\n\n### 4. Python Libraries and Tools\n\n- **`timeout` Command**: You can use the `timeout` command available in many Unix-like systems to limit execution time when calling subprocesses.\n  \n  ```python\n  subprocess.run(['timeout', '60', 'your_command', 'arg1', 'arg2'])\n  ```\n\n- **Resource Module**: You can apply resource limits using the `resource` module in Python for CPU time (in seconds).\n\n  ```python\n  import resource\n  import subprocess\n\n  def limit_resources():\n      resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_CPU, (60, 60))  # Limit CPU time to 60 seconds\n\n  subprocess.run(['your_command', 'arg1', 'arg2'], preexec_fn=limit_resources)\n  ```\n\nBy combining these methods, you can effectively control the execution time and CPU usage of subprocesses in Python on a Linux system."
