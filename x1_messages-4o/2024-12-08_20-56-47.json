A function named `multiply` is defined, which takes two integer arguments `a` and `b`.\n2. The function returns the product of `a` and `b`.\n3. The function `multiply` is called with the arguments 4 and -2.\n4. The product of 4 and -2 is calculated, which is `4 * -2 = -8`.\n5. The resulting value, `-8`, is assigned to the variable `result`.\n6. The `print` function is used to output the value of `result` to the console.\n\nThus, when the code snippet is executed, it will print the value `-8` to the console."
