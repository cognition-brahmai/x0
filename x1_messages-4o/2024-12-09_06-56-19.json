Given that there are multiple files, I am not sure if I am saving the model correctly. Can you guide me on how to load the saved tokenizer from a pretrained model in Pytorch?"

        "content": "Certainly! When you save a tokenizer using Hugging Face's Transformers library, it generally involves multiple files, but you can load it quite easily using the `from_pretrained` method. You don't need to worry about the individual files. Here's how you can load the tokenizer:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import BertTokenizer\n\n# Load the tokenizer\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('./saved_model/')\n```\n\nIn this case, `BertTokenizer` is the class used for BERT-based models. If you're using a different model architecture or version, you might need to use a different tokenizer class, such as `RobertaTokenizer` or `DistilBertTokenizer`, etc., depending on the specific model you fine-tuned.\n\nThe `from_pretrained` method will automatically look for the necessary files in the specified directory (`./saved_model/`) and load them correctly.\n\nTo briefly explain the files:\n- `config.json`: Contains the configuration of the model.\n- `added_tokens.json`: If you added any new tokens to the tokenizer, they are saved here.\n- `special_tokens_map.json`: Maps special tokens like `[CLS]`, `[SEP]`, etc.\n- `tokenizer_config.json`: Configuration for the tokenizer.\n- `vocab.txt`: The vocabulary file for the tokenizer.\n- `pytorch_model.bin`: The model weights.\n\nSo, simply use the `from_pretrained` method with the appropriate tokenizer class to load it and you\u2019ll be ready to tokenize your text for inference or further processing!"
