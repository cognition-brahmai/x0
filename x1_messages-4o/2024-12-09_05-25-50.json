I have a `due_date` field which is supposed to be optional for the user in case they have a deadline for some to-do item. However, when I try to set `required=False` for the `due_date`, I get a TypeError due to unexpected keyword argument 'required'. How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "In Django, when you want to make a `DateTimeField` optional in your model, you should use the `blank=True` and `null=True` options instead of `required=False`. These options are used to allow the field to be optional in forms and to allow the database to store `NULL` for that field.\n\nHere's how you can define your `Item` model with an optional `due_date` field:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Item(models.Model):\n    # Other fields for your Item model\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n    description = models.TextField(blank=True)\n    \n    # Optional due_date field\n    due_date = models.DateTimeField(blank=True, null=True)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.name\n```\n\n- `blank=True`: This allows the field to be optional when using forms. It means the field is not required in form validation.\n- `null=True`: This specifies that the database should store `NULL` for the field when it is not provided.\n\nBy setting both `blank=True` and `null=True`, you ensure that the field is optional both in forms and in the database. This should resolve the issue you're encountering with the `TypeError` for the unexpected keyword argument 'required', as `required` is not a valid argument for model fields in Django."
