        "content": "Certainly! The `__import__` function in Python can be a bit tricky, especially when dealing with dotted module names. Let's break down how it works and why you might be seeing unexpected behavior.\n\nWhen you use `__import__` with a dotted name like `somepackage.somemodule`, it doesn't return the last module in the dotted path (`somemodule`). Instead, it returns the top-level package (`somepackage`). This behavior is by design and is documented in Python's official documentation.\n\nHere\u2019s a basic example to illustrate:\n\n```python\nimported_module = __import__('somepackage.somemodule')\n```\n\nIn this case, `imported_module` will be `somepackage`, not `somemodule`.\n\n### How to Access the Submodule\n\nTo access the submodule (`somemodule`), you'll need to navigate through the attributes of the top-level package:\n\n```python\nimported_module = __import__('somepackage.somemodule')\nsubmodule = getattr(imported_module, 'somemodule')\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `importlib` module, which provides a more modern and flexible approach to importing modules:\n\n```python\nimport importlib\n\nsubmodule = importlib.import_module('somepackage.somemodule')\n```\n\nThis method directly imports the module you specify, so `submodule` will be `somepackage.somemodule`.\n\n### Summary\n\n- `__import__('somepackage.somemodule')` returns the top-level package, not the submodule.\n- You need to manually navigate to the submodule using `getattr` or similar methods.\n- Consider using `importlib.import_module` for a more straightforward approach.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the situation! Let me know if you have any more questions."
