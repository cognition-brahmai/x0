        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because if an exception occurs in your `try` block, the `text` variable is never defined, resulting in a `NameError` when you try to access it outside the block. To ensure that `text` is available outside the block, you can initialize it before the `try` block. This way, it will have a defined state regardless of whether an exception occurs.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport urllib.request\n\nurl = \"http://www.google.com\"\ntext = None  # Initialize the variable before the try block\n\ntry:\n    page = urllib.request.urlopen(url)\n    text = page.read().decode('utf8')\nexcept (ValueError, RuntimeError, TypeError, NameError):\n    print(\"Unable to process your request dude!!\")\n\nif text is not None:\n    print(text)\nelse:\n    print(\"No content to display.\")\n```\n\nBy initializing `text` to `None` before the `try` block, you ensure that `text` is always defined. After the `try/except` block, you can check if `text` is `None` to determine whether the request was successful and handle it accordingly."
