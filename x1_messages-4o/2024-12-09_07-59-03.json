Despite the name \"positive,\" this field type is designed to accept any non-negative integer, which includes zero. Therefore, you can safely use `PositiveIntegerField` for your `points` field, and it will accept 0 as a valid value. \n\nIf you want to enforce that only strictly positive numbers (greater than zero) are allowed, you would need to add additional validation logic to your model."
