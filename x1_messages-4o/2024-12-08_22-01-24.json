The pattern in this sequence is multiplication by 2, so the missing number should be 60. Can you write a function that can solve this for any similar sequence?"

        "content": "Certainly! To solve this problem, you need to identify the pattern in the sequence and then calculate the missing number based on that pattern. In the given sequence, the pattern is that each number is multiplied by 2. Here's a Swift function that does just that:\n\n```swift\nfunc findMissingNumber(in sequence: [Int]) -> Int? {\n    // Check if the sequence has at least two numbers\n    guard sequence.count > 1 else {\n        return nil\n    }\n    \n    var multiplier = 0\n    \n    // Find the multiplier by checking the ratio between consecutive numbers\n    for i in 0..<(sequence.count - 1) {\n        if sequence[i] != -1 && sequence[i + 1] != -1 {\n            let currentMultiplier = sequence[i + 1] / sequence[i]\n            if multiplier == 0 {\n                multiplier = currentMultiplier\n            } else if multiplier != currentMultiplier {\n                // If multipliers are inconsistent, return nil\n                return nil\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Find the missing number\n    for i in 0..<sequence.count {\n        if sequence[i] == -1 {\n            if i > 0 {\n                // Use the previous element to find the missing number\n                return sequence[i - 1] * multiplier\n            } else if i < sequence.count - 1 {\n                // Use the next element to find the missing number\n                return sequence[i + 1] / multiplier\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return nil\n}\n\n// Example usage\nlet sequence = [12, 24, 36, 48, -1, 72]\nif let missingNumber = findMissingNumber(in: sequence) {\n    print(\"The missing number is \\(missingNumber)\")\n} else {\n    print(\"Could not determine the missing number or the sequence pattern is inconsistent.\")\n}\n```\n\nThis function works by first determining the common multiplier by examining non-missing, consecutive numbers in the sequence. Once the multiplier is identified, it calculates the missing number by using the known pattern. If the sequence doesn't follow a consistent pattern or doesn't contain enough information, the function returns `nil`."
