The directory to be searched is passed as an argument named `dir_to_search`, which looks like this: \n```\ntest/20/...\ntest/22/...\ntest/25/...\ntest/26/...\n```\nAll the above folders are empty. However, when I run the script, only the folders `20` and `22` get deleted. The folders `25` and `26` are not deleted even though they are empty. I'm also getting an exception `[Errno 39] Directory not empty`. Here is the code I'm using:\n```\nfor dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(dir_to_search):\n    //other codes\n\n    try:\n        os.rmdir(dirpath)\n    except OSError as ex:\n        print(ex)\n```\nCan anyone help me understand where I am making a mistake?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issue you are encountering is likely due to the way `os.walk()` traverses directories. By default, `os.walk()` generates the file names in a directory tree by walking the tree either top-down or bottom-up. In your case, you are using the default top-down approach, which means that `os.walk()` processes the parent directories before their subdirectories. This can cause issues when trying to remove directories recursively.\n\nTo address this issue, you need to ensure that you are removing the directories in a bottom-up manner instead. This way, the subdirectories are deleted before their parent directories, preventing the `Directory not empty` error. You can achieve this by setting the `topdown` parameter of `os.walk()` to `False`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef remove_empty_dirs(dir_to_search):\n    for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(dir_to_search, topdown=False):\n        # Attempt to remove the directory if it is empty\n        try:\n            os.rmdir(dirpath)\n            print(f\"Removed empty directory: {dirpath}\")\n        except OSError as ex:\n            print(f\"Error removing {dirpath}: {ex}\")\n\n# Example usage\ndir_to_search = 'test'  # Replace with your directory path\nremove_empty_dirs(dir_to_search)\n```\n\nBy setting `topdown=False`, the `os.walk()` function will traverse the directory tree from the bottom up, ensuring that all subdirectories are processed before their parent directories. This should resolve the issue and allow you to remove all empty directories as intended."
