        "content": "To solve the problem of adding five eights to the decimal number 9 and converting the result to binary, we first need to calculate the total in decimal and then convert that total to binary.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Calculate the total in decimal:\n   - Five eights: \\(5 \\times 8 = 40\\)\n   - Add 9 to 40: \\(40 + 9 = 49\\)\n\n2. Convert 49 to binary.\n\nNow, let's write the Java code to perform these calculations and conversion:\n\n```java\npublic class DecimalToBinary {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int numberOfEights = 5;\n        int valueOfEight = 8;\n        int baseValue = 9;\n\n        // Calculate the total in decimal\n        int total = (numberOfEights * valueOfEight) + baseValue;\n\n        // Convert the decimal total to binary\n        String binaryRepresentation = Integer.toBinaryString(total);\n\n        // Output the result\n        System.out.println(\"The binary equivalent of adding five eights to 9 is: \" + binaryRepresentation);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen you run this Java code, it will output the binary representation of 49, which is `110001`."
