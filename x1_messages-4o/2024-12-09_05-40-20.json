I'm not sure what's causing this issue. I did some updates with pip but as far as I know, there were no dependencies of `psycopg2` that were updated. Could someone help me understand why this issue has occurred and how can I fix it?"

        "content": "The `AttributeError` you're encountering suggests that Python can't find the `extras` module within `psycopg2`. This could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. **Incorrect Installation or Update**: It's possible that during the update process, `psycopg2` was not installed correctly, or the version installed doesn't include the `extras` module.\n\n2. **Namespace Conflicts**: There might be a module or a file named `psycopg2` in your project directory that's shadowing the actual `psycopg2` library.\n\n3. **Virtual Environment Issues**: If you're using a virtual environment, it's possible that the environment's packages aren't correctly set up or that `psycopg2` wasn't installed in the environment you're currently using.\n\nHere are some steps to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Installation**:\n    - Ensure `psycopg2` is installed correctly by running:\n      ```bash\n      pip show psycopg2\n      ```\n    - Reinstall `psycopg2` to ensure it's the correct version and includes extras:\n      ```bash\n      pip uninstall psycopg2\n      pip install psycopg2-binary\n      ```\n\n2. **Verify Imports**:\n    - Double-check your import statements to ensure they are correct. It should look like this:\n      ```python\n      import psycopg2\n      import psycopg2.extras\n      ```\n\n3. **Check Your Project Directory**:\n    - Make sure there are no files or directories named `psycopg2` in your project folder that could be causing a conflict.\n\n4. **Use a Virtual Environment**:\n    - If not already using one, consider creating a virtual environment to manage your dependencies:\n      ```bash\n      python -m venv myenv\n      source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n      pip install psycopg2-binary\n      ```\n\n5. **Check Python Path**:\n    - Verify that your Python path is set correctly and points to the correct installation of Python where `psycopg2` is installed.\n\nIf these steps don't resolve your issue, please provide more information about your setup, such as your operating system, the version of Python you're using, and any other relevant details."
