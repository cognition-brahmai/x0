For this, I am connecting to a server using putty and have created a script in the directory `.../Documents/LOG`. The script is:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# My first script\necho \"Hello World!\"\n```\n\nI have executed `chmod 755 my_script` to give it read/write/execute permissions. However, when I try to run the script using `./my_script`, I get an error saying `/bin/bash^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory`. \n\nWhen I run `which bash`, it returns `/bin/bash` and `echo $PATH` returns `/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/bin/mh`. I have also tried adding the current directory to `PATH`, but it did not solve the issue. How can I successfully run this bash script?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is often due to a mismatch in line endings between Windows and Unix/Linux systems. When you create a script on a Windows machine, it ends each line with a carriage return and a newline (`\\r\\n`), whereas Unix/Linux systems expect just a newline (`\\n`). The `^M` character in the error message is a representation of the carriage return (`\\r`) character.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to convert the line endings of your script to Unix format. There are several ways to do this:\n\n### Using dos2unix\nIf you have access to the `dos2unix` command, you can use it to convert your script:\n\n1. Run the following command on the server:\n   ```bash\n   dos2unix my_script\n   ```\n\nThis will convert the line endings and should resolve the issue.\n\n### Using a Text Editor\nYou can also use a text editor that supports changing line endings:\n\n1. **Notepad++**: Open your script in Notepad++. Go to `Edit` -> `EOL Conversion` -> `Unix (LF)`, then save the file.\n2. **Visual Studio Code**: Open your script, click on the CRLF text in the bottom right corner of the window, and select \"LF\" from the options.\n\n### Using sed\nIf you do not have `dos2unix` and prefer not to use a GUI-based text editor, you can use `sed` to remove the carriage return characters:\n\n1. Run the following command:\n   ```bash\n   sed -i 's/\\r$//' my_script\n   ```\n\n### Using Vim\nIf you are comfortable with Vim, you can open the file and re-save it with Unix line endings:\n\n1. Open the file with Vim:\n   ```bash\n   vim my_script\n   ```\n2. In Vim, enter command mode by pressing `:` and then type:\n   ```vim\n   :set ff=unix\n   ```\n3. Save and exit by typing:\n   ```vim\n   :wq\n   ```\n\nAfter converting the line endings, try running your script again using `./my_script`. This should solve the issue."
