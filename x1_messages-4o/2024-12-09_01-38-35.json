I am attempting to round this number to 3 decimal points so that the output looks like this: \n\n2.324e25\n\nI have tried to use the following code:\n\n```python\nx = 2.32432432423e25 \nnumber_rounded = round(x, 3)\n```\n\nHowever, when I print `number_rounded`, it outputs a number with the same format as `x`. How can I limit the display of `x` to just 4 significant digits?"

        "content": "In Python, the `round()` function rounds the number to a specified number of decimal places, but it doesn't affect the way floating-point numbers are represented in scientific notation. To achieve the desired format with a specific number of significant digits in scientific notation, you can use string formatting. Here's how you can format the number to 4 significant digits:\n\n```python\nx = 2.32432432423e25\nformatted_number = \"{:.3e}\".format(x)\nprint(formatted_number)\n```\n\nThis code snippet uses Python's string formatting to represent the number in scientific notation with 3 digits after the decimal point, effectively showing 4 significant digits in total. The output will be:\n\n```\n2.324e+25\n```\n\nThis displays the number with the desired precision."
