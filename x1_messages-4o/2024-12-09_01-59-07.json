I attempted to create such a regular expression using the following code: `re.compile(\"Sent from my [iPhone]|[iPod]\")`. However, this does not seem to work. How can I correctly create a regular expression that matches both phrases?"

        "content": "The issue with your regular expression `re.compile(\"Sent from my [iPhone]|[iPod]\")` is that the syntax for character classes `[ ]` is being misused. In regular expressions, square brackets `[ ]` define a character class, which matches any single character inside them. So, `[iPhone]` matches any one of the characters 'i', 'P', 'h', 'o', 'n', or 'e', and `[iPod]` matches any one of 'i', 'P', 'o', or 'd', which is not what you want.\n\nTo match the phrases \"Sent from my iPhone\" and \"Sent from my iPod\", you should use parentheses `( )` for grouping and the pipe `|` for alternation. Here is the corrected version of your regular expression:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\npattern = re.compile(r\"Sent from my (iPhone|iPod)\")\n```\n\nThis pattern uses parentheses to group `iPhone` and `iPod` together, and the `|` operator to indicate that either \"iPhone\" or \"iPod\" should be matched. The `r` before the string denotes a raw string in Python, which is a good practice when writing regular expressions to avoid issues with escape sequences.\n\nNow, this regular expression will correctly match both \"Sent from my iPhone\" and \"Sent from my iPod\"."
