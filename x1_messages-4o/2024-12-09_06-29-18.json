I am interested in using a tool like coverage in combination with a crawler like django-test-utils to find code that isn't being used, so we can mark it with deprecation warnings. However, when I tried running coverage.py with the Django debug server, it seemed to only profile the runserver machinery and not my views. We are continually improving our test coverage, but I was hoping for a faster method. Do you have any suggestions on how to efficiently find and mark unused Django code?"

        "content": "Finding and marking unused code in a Django project can indeed be challenging, especially when dealing with legacy code. Here are some strategies you can employ to tackle this issue:\n\n1. **Improve Test Coverage**: Continue to improve your test coverage to ensure that as much of your code as possible is executed during tests. This will help you identify areas of the code that are not being hit by any tests.\n\n2. **Use Coverage.py with Test Runner**: Instead of running `coverage.py` with the Django development server, integrate it with your test suite. Run your tests with coverage, which will help you identify which parts of your code are covered by tests. You can do this by running:\n   ```bash\n   coverage run manage.py test\n   coverage report\n   coverage html\n   ```\n   This will give you a detailed report on code coverage.\n\n3. **Static Code Analysis**: Use static analysis tools like `pylint`, `flake8`, or `vulture` which can help identify unused imports, variables, and functions. `vulture` is particularly useful for spotting dead code.\n\n4. **Dynamic Analysis with django-test-utils**: If you're interested in using a crawler to dynamically analyze code usage, you might consider writing end-to-end tests that navigate through your application. These tests can be run with coverage to identify which parts of your application are exercised during these interactions.\n\n5. **Code Profiling**: Use profiling tools to monitor which parts of the application are being executed during runtime. This can help you identify code paths that are never accessed.\n\n6. **Deprecation Warnings**: For code you suspect is unused but are not certain, you can mark it with deprecation warnings. This way, you can remove the code in a phased manner, giving time to catch any missed usage.\n\n7. **Manual Code Review**: Sometimes, a manual review of the codebase can also help identify unused code, especially if the codebase is not very large.\n\n8. **Refactoring**: Consider refactoring parts of your codebase. This can sometimes naturally reveal unused legacy code or make it easier to identify.\n\n9. **Version Control Analysis**: Check your version control history to help understand why certain code was added and if it is still relevant.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you should be able to efficiently find and mark unused code in your Django project."
