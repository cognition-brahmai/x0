        "content": "To draw a complete line across an image using OpenCV, given the polar coordinates (rho, theta) of the line, you can calculate the intersection points of the line with the image borders and then draw the line segment between these points. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **Understand Polar Coordinates**: In the polar coordinate system used by OpenCV's Hough Transform, `rho` is the perpendicular distance from the origin to the line, and `theta` is the angle between the x-axis and the perpendicular from the origin to the line.\n\n2. **Calculate Intersection Points**: Convert the polar coordinates into Cartesian coordinates to find the intersection points of the line with the edges of the image.\n\n3. **Draw the Line**: Use the `cv2.line` function to draw the line segment between the calculated points.\n\nHere's a sample code to demonstrate how to do this:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef draw_polar_line(img, rho, theta):\n    # Image dimensions\n    height, width = img.shape[:2]\n\n    # Calculate the cosine and sine of theta\n    a = np.cos(theta)\n    b = np.sin(theta)\n\n    # Calculate the x0, y0 (closest point to the origin)\n    x0 = a * rho\n    y0 = b * rho\n\n    # Calculate the points along the line at the edges of the image\n    # Two points are enough to define a line\n    x1 = int(x0 + 1000 * (-b))\n    y1 = int(y0 + 1000 * (a))\n    x2 = int(x0 - 1000 * (-b))\n    y2 = int(y0 - 1000 * (a))\n\n    # Draw the line on the image\n    cv2.line(img, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 2)\n\n# Example usage\nimg = np.zeros((500, 500, 3), dtype=np.uint8)\nrho = 250\ntheta = np.pi / 4  # 45 degrees\n\ndraw_polar_line(img, rho, theta)\n\n# Display the image\ncv2.imshow('Line', img)\ncv2.waitKey(0)\ncv2.destroyAllWindows()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`a` and `b`**: These are the cosine and sine of the angle `theta`. They help in calculating the coordinates of a point on the line.\n- **`x0` and `y0`**: These are the coordinates of a point on the line closest to the origin.\n- **`x1, y1` and `x2, y2`**: These are points far away from each other on the line (outside the image bounds), calculated by extending the line in both directions. This ensures that the line crosses the entire image when drawn.\n- **`cv2.line`**: This function draws the line between the two calculated points.\n\nAdjust `rho` and `theta` as per your line parameters. The example above draws a line at 45 degrees with a perpendicular distance of 250 pixels from the origin."
