According to the nvidia-smi manual, performance states range from P0 (maximum performance) to P12 (minimum performance). But, I am observing that my GPU is at P0 state when idle, and switches to P2 during heavy computation. Why does my GPU switch to P2 state during heavy computation instead of staying at P0? Is there a way to ensure my GPU always runs at P0 state for maximum performance?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing with your Nvidia GTX Titan X is related to how GPUs manage power and performance states to balance efficiency and thermal considerations. The P-states (performance states) indicate different levels of performance and power usage. P0 is the highest performance state, while higher-numbered states like P2, P3, etc., generally represent lower performance and power consumption.\n\nWhen your GPU switches to P2 during heavy computation, it may be due to thermal management or power constraints. The GPU might be reducing its clock speeds slightly to maintain safe operating temperatures or to stay within power limits. This behavior is typically controlled by the GPU's firmware and driver settings.\n\nIf you want to force your GPU to remain in the P0 state for maximum performance, you can try the following approaches, but do so with caution as it might increase power consumption and heat output:\n\n1. **Power Management Mode**: In the Nvidia Control Panel, you can set the \"Power management mode\" to \"Prefer maximum performance\" for the specific application you are running. This can encourage the GPU to stay in higher performance states.\n\n2. **Overclocking Tools**: Use third-party tools like MSI Afterburner to manually adjust the GPU's clock speeds and power limits. Be cautious with this approach, as it can lead to overheating and potentially damage the hardware if not managed properly.\n\n3. **Driver and Firmware Updates**: Ensure your GPU drivers and firmware are up-to-date, as newer updates might provide better power management and performance tuning.\n\n4. **Cooling Solutions**: Make sure your GPU is adequately cooled. Improving airflow in your case or using a more efficient cooling solution can help maintain lower temperatures, potentially allowing the GPU to stay in higher performance states.\n\nKeep in mind that forcing the GPU to stay in P0 might lead to increased power consumption and heat generation, which could potentially reduce the lifespan of the GPU. Always monitor temperatures and system stability when making such changes."
