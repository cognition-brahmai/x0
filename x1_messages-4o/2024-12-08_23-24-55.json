        "content": "How can you calculate the amount of money you will have in a bank account after one year if you have $100 in the account and it earns a 6% annual interest, compounded annually? \nTo solve this puzzle without using any formula or calculator, you can try breaking down the 6% interest rate into smaller fractions that are easier to work with. For example, you can divide it into two fractions: 3% and 3%, or even into three fractions: 2%, 2%, and 2%. Alternatively, you can approximate the answer using mental math.\nOnce you have your series of steps, you can apply them to the following code in C++ to calculate the answer:\n```c++\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cmath>\nusing namespace std;\nint main()\n{\n   double principal = 100.0;\n   double rate = 0.06;\n   double time = 1.0;\n   double amount = principal * pow(1 + rate, time);\n   cout << \"After \" << time << \" year(s), you will have $\" << amount << \" in your account.\" << endl;\n   return 0;\n}\n```\nTo apply your steps to the code, replace the value of \"rate\" with the fraction(s) you derived and run the code. For example, if you broke down the interest rate into three 2% fractions, you would replace \"rate = 0.06\" with \"rate = 0.02\" three times. Then, run the code to see the calculated amount in your account after one year."

        "content": "To calculate the amount of money you'll have in the bank account after one year with a 6% annual interest rate compounded annually, let's first break down the interest rate into smaller fractions. We can use three fractions of 2% each.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can think about it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Start with the initial principal**: $100.\n\n2. **Apply the first 2% increment**:  \n   \\[\n   100 \\times 0.02 = 2\n   \\]  \n   Adding this to the principal gives:  \n   \\[\n   100 + 2 = 102\n   \\]\n\n3. **Apply the second 2% increment**:  \n   \\[\n   102 \\times 0.02 = 2.04\n   \\]  \n   Adding this to the new principal gives:  \n   \\[\n   102 + 2.04 = 104.04\n   \\]\n\n4. **Apply the third 2% increment**:  \n   \\[\n   104.04 \\times 0.02 = 2.0808\n   \\]  \n   Adding this to the new principal gives:  \n   \\[\n   104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's apply this thought process to the C++ code by simulating three consecutive interest applications of 2% each:\n\n```c++\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    double principal = 100.0;\n    double rate1 = 0.02; // First 2%\n    double rate2 = 0.02; // Second 2%\n    double rate3 = 0.02; // Third 2%\n    \n    // Apply first 2%\n    principal = principal * (1 + rate1);\n    \n    // Apply second 2%\n    principal = principal * (1 + rate2);\n    \n    // Apply third 2%\n    principal = principal * (1 + rate3);\n    \n    cout << \"After 1 year(s), you will have $\" << principal << \" in your account.\" << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the final amount of $106.1208 after one year, which is consistent with the step-by-step breakdown. This approach effectively demonstrates how compounding works by applying smaller increments of the total interest rate."
