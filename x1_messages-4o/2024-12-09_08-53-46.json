        "content": "To calculate the total area of a polygon using its side lengths, you need to know additional information about the polygon. For a regular polygon (all sides and angles are equal), you can use a specific formula. For an irregular polygon, you would typically need additional details like the coordinates of the vertices or the apothem.\n\nLet's look at how to calculate the area of a regular polygon using Python. For a regular polygon, the formula for the area \\( A \\) is:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{4} \\times n \\times s^2 \\times \\cot\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right) \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of sides, and \\( s \\) is the length of each side.\n\nHere's a Python implementation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_regular_polygon_area(n, s):\n    # n is the number of sides\n    # s is the length of each side\n    if n < 3:\n        raise ValueError(\"A polygon must have at least 3 sides.\")\n    \n    # Calculate the area using the formula\n    area = (n * s**2) / (4 * math.tan(math.pi / n))\n    return area\n\n# Example usage\nnumber_of_sides = 5  # For example, a pentagon\nside_length = 6  # Length of each side\narea = calculate_regular_polygon_area(number_of_sides, side_length)\nprint(f\"The area of the regular polygon is: {area}\")\n```\n\nIf you're dealing with an irregular polygon, you would typically need the coordinates of the vertices to calculate the area using methods like the Shoelace formula (also known as Gauss's area formula).\n\nHere's an example using the Shoelace formula for a polygon defined by its vertices:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_irregular_polygon_area(vertices):\n    # vertices is a list of tuples [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn)]\n    n = len(vertices)\n    if n < 3:\n        raise ValueError(\"A polygon must have at least 3 vertices.\")\n    \n    area = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        x1, y1 = vertices[i]\n        x2, y2 = vertices[(i + 1) % n]\n        area += x1 * y2\n        area -= y1 * x2\n    area = abs(area) / 2\n    return area\n\n# Example usage\nvertices = [(0, 0), (4, 0), (4, 3), (0, 3)]  # A rectangle\narea = calculate_irregular_polygon_area(vertices)\nprint(f\"The area of the irregular polygon is: {area}\")\n```\n\nChoose the appropriate method based on whether your polygon is regular or irregular."
