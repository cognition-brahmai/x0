        "content": "Your implementation using the `math/rand` package is a common approach to generate random numbers within a specific range in Go. However, there are a couple of improvements you can make for better efficiency and randomness:\n\n1. **Use `rand.Seed` Once**: Seeding the random number generator each time you call the function can lead to less randomness if called in quick succession. It's usually better to seed it once, typically at the start of your program.\n\n2. **Use `rand.Intn` Correctly**: The `rand.Intn` function already handles the range in a more straightforward way without needing to adjust `max` by 1 when using it directly in your function.\n\nHere is a refined version of your code:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"math/rand\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n\n// Seed the random number generator once at the start\nfunc init() {\n\trand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())\n}\n\nfunc random(min, max int) int {\n\treturn rand.Intn(max-min+1) + min\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tnum := random(1, 100)\n\tfmt.Println(\"Random number between 1 and 100:\", num)\n}\n```\n\n### Key Improvements:\n- **`rand.Seed` in `init`**: This seeds the random number generator once when the program starts, using `time.Now().UnixNano()` for more precision.\n- **Range Handling**: By using `rand.Intn(max-min+1)`, you ensure the range includes both the minimum and maximum values, making it more intuitive.\n\nThis approach is both efficient and easy to understand while providing a truly random number within the specified range."
