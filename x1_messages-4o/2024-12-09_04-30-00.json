I have also tried to debug it but the debugger is not breaking on unhandled exceptions. Here is the screenshot of my configuration and the debugging output:\n\nConfiguration screenshot: ![screenshot](https://i.stack.imgur.com/U1IMt.jpg)\n\nDebugging output:\n\n```\nC:\\Python25\\python.exe \"C:\\Program Files\\JetBrains\\PyCharm 1.2.1\\helpers\\pydev\\pydevd.py\" --client 127.0.0.1 --port 49371 --file C:/Users/morpheus/PycharmProjects/untitled1/main.py\npydev debugger: warning: psyco not available for speedups (the debugger will still work correctly, but a bit slower)\npydev debugger: starting\nConnected to pydev debugger (build 105.58)\n```\n\nI noticed that PyCharm uses pydevd for the debugger and this seems to be the same issue as breaking on unhandled exceptions in pydev/gae. I can get the debugger to break on a non-gae project, but it won't break on a gae project. How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "To configure PyCharm to break on unhandled exceptions, especially in a Google App Engine (GAE) project, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. **Ensure Proper Configuration**:\n   - Go to `Run` -> `Edit Configurations`.\n   - Select your debug configuration.\n   - In the `Configuration` tab, ensure that the script path and working directory are correctly set.\n\n2. **Set Breakpoints**:\n   - Manually set breakpoints in your code by clicking in the gutter next to the line numbers. This will ensure that the debugger stops at those points and might help you identify any issues with unhandled exceptions.\n\n3. **Exception Breakpoints**:\n   - In PyCharm, you can set breakpoints for exceptions.\n   - Go to `Run` -> `View Breakpoints` or press `Ctrl+Shift+F8`.\n   - In the Breakpoints dialog, click the `+` icon and select `Python Exception Breakpoint`.\n   - You can configure it to break on specific exceptions or all exceptions.\n   - Make sure the `Enabled` checkbox is checked for the breakpoints you want.\n\n4. **Check the Debugger Settings**:\n   - Go to `File` -> `Settings` (or `PyCharm` -> `Preferences` on macOS).\n   - Navigate to `Build, Execution, Deployment` -> `Debugger`.\n   - Ensure that options related to exception handling are properly configured.\n\n5. **Update PyCharm and Plugins**:\n   - Ensure your PyCharm and all plugins, including Python support and any GAE-related plugins, are up to date. Sometimes, bugs in older versions can cause issues with debugging.\n\n6. **Check for Code Issues**:\n   - If you have custom exception handling in your code, it might be catching and suppressing exceptions. Review your code to ensure exceptions are not being caught and ignored unintentionally.\n\n7. **Use Console for Output**:\n   - Check the console output to see if there are any error messages or warnings that might indicate why the debugger isn't breaking.\n\n8. **Test with Non-GAE Project**:\n   - Since you mentioned it works with non-GAE projects, try debugging a simple script to ensure the debugger is functioning correctly. This will help isolate the issue to the GAE environment.\n\n9. **Consider Alternative Debugging**:\n   - If the issue persists, consider using logging to capture exception stack traces. You can use Python's `logging` module to log exceptions and review the logs.\n\nIf you've tried all these steps and the issue persists, it may be a bug or limitation specific to the version of PyCharm or the GAE support in PyCharm. Consider reaching out to JetBrains support or checking their issue tracker for similar reports and potential fixes."
