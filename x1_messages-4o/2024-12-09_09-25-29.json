        "content": "Certainly! To find the missing number in a given array of integers containing numbers from 1 to N with one missing, you can use the following algorithm:\n\n### Algorithm: Sum Formula Approach\n\n1. **Calculate the Expected Sum**: \n   - The sum of the first N natural numbers is given by the formula:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Expected Sum} = \\frac{N \\times (N + 1)}{2}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Actual Sum**:\n   - Sum all the elements present in the array.\n\n3. **Find the Missing Number**:\n   - Subtract the Actual Sum from the Expected Sum to find the missing number:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Missing Number} = \\text{Expected Sum} - \\text{Actual Sum}\n     \\]\n\n### Example Code in Python\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the above algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef find_missing_number(arr):\n    N = len(arr) + 1  # Since one number is missing\n    expected_sum = N * (N + 1) // 2\n    actual_sum = sum(arr)\n    missing_number = expected_sum - actual_sum\n    return missing_number\n\n# Example usage\narr = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]  # Missing number is 3\nmissing_number = find_missing_number(arr)\nprint(f\"The missing number is: {missing_number}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Step 1**: Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to N using the formula.\n- **Step 2**: Calculate the sum of the numbers present in the array.\n- **Step 3**: The difference between the expected sum and the actual sum gives the missing number.\n\nThis method is efficient with a time complexity of \\(O(N)\\) and a space complexity of \\(O(1)\\)."
