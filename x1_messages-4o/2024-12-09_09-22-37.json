        "content": "In C#, you can remove all leading and trailing whitespace from a string using the `Trim` method. This method is available on any string object and will remove any whitespace characters from the start and end of the string. Here's an example of how you can use it:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        string originalString = \"   Hello, World!   \";\n        string trimmedString = originalString.Trim();\n        \n        Console.WriteLine(\"Original String: [\" + originalString + \"]\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Trimmed String: [\" + trimmedString + \"]\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `originalString` contains leading and trailing whitespace. By calling `Trim()` on it, `trimmedString` will have these spaces removed. The output will show the difference before and after trimming:\n\n```\nOriginal String: [   Hello, World!   ]\nTrimmed String: [Hello, World!]\n```\n\nIf you want to remove only leading spaces, you can use the `TrimStart` method, and for only trailing spaces, you can use the `TrimEnd` method."
