I am trying to build a pipeline which first does RandomizedPCA on my training data and then fits a ridge regression model. However, I have run into some issues. Specifically, I want the GridSearchCV to report RMSE error, but this doesn't seem to be supported in sklearn, so I'm using MSE. However, the scores it reports are negative. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Ridge\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nimport numpy as np\n\npca = PCA(n_components=1000, whiten=True, svd_solver='randomized')\nrgn = Ridge()\n\npca_ridge = Pipeline([('pca', pca),\n                      ('ridge', rgn)])\n\nparameters = {'ridge__alpha': 10 ** np.linspace(-5, -2, 3)}\n\ngrid_search = GridSearchCV(pca_ridge, parameters, cv=2, n_jobs=1, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')\ngrid_search.fit(train_x, train_y[:, 1:])\n\ngrid_search.grid_scores_\n```\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n```python\n[mean: -0.02665, std: 0.00007, params: {'ridge__alpha': 1.0000000000000001e-05},\n mean: -0.02658, std: 0.00009, params: {'ridge__alpha': 0.031622776601683791},\n mean: -0.02626, std: 0.00008, params: {'ridge__alpha': 100.0}]\n```\n\nWhy is the mean squared error negative?"

        "content": "In scikit-learn, the scoring function for regression tasks during cross-validation is often used in a way where higher scores are better, which is consistent across various metrics. However, for metrics like mean squared error (MSE) where lower values are better, scikit-learn uses a negative sign to maintain this consistency. This is why you see \"neg_mean_squared_error\" as the scoring parameter in `GridSearchCV`.\n\nThe negative sign in the output is simply an artifact of this convention. It allows the grid search to maximize the score, as the higher (or less negative) the score, the better the model's performance. If you want to get the actual MSE values, you can simply take the negative of the reported scores.\n\nHere's how you could extract and convert the negative mean squared error to positive MSE or RMSE:\n\n```python\n# Extract the results\nresults = grid_search.cv_results_\n\n# Get the mean test scores (negative MSE)\nneg_mse_scores = results['mean_test_score']\n\n# Convert to positive MSE\nmse_scores = -neg_mse_scores\n\n# Convert to RMSE\nrmse_scores = np.sqrt(mse_scores)\n\nprint(\"MSE scores: \", mse_scores)\nprint(\"RMSE scores: \", rmse_scores)\n```\n\nThis will give you both MSE and RMSE values, which might be more intuitive for interpretation and comparison."
