Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Open System Properties**:\n   - Click on the \"Start\" button.\n   - Right-click on \"Computer\" and select \"Properties\".\n   - Click on \"Advanced system settings\" on the left.\n\n2. **Access Environment Variables**:\n   - In the \"System Properties\" window, click on the \"Advanced\" tab.\n   - Click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n\n3. **Add Python2 to the PATH**:\n   - In the \"Environment Variables\" window, under the \"System variables\" section, scroll down and find the \"Path\" variable.\n   - Select it and click on \"Edit\".\n   - In the \"Edit Environment Variable\" window, you'll see a list of paths separated by semicolons. Be careful not to delete existing paths.\n   - Add the path to your Python 2 installation, which in your case is `C:\\Python27`, to the end of the list. Make sure to separate it from the existing paths with a semicolon.\n   - Click \"OK\" to close the dialog boxes.\n\n4. **Set Up the Alias for Python2**:\n   If you want to use `python2` as a command to run Python 2, you can create a batch file:\n   - Open a text editor like Notepad.\n   - Type the following line:\n     ```batch\n     @C:\\Python27\\python.exe %*\n     ```\n   - Save this file as `python2.bat` in a directory that is included in your PATH environment variable, for instance, `C:\\Windows\\System32`.\n\n5. **Verify the Setup**:\n   - Open a new Command Prompt window.\n   - Type `python2` and press Enter.\n   - You should see the Python 2 interpreter start up, confirming that it is recognized as a command.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to run Python 2 using the `python2` command in your command line on Windows 7."
