When I zoom in or out of the graph, the image quality gets quite poor. The code I'm currently using to generate the graph is as follows:\n\n```python\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.gca(projection='3d')\nax.view_init(30, -90)\nax.set_xlabel(\"X\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Y\")\nax.set_zlabel(\"Z\")\nplt.xlim(0,pL)\nplt.ylim(0,pW)\nax.set_aspect(\"equal\")\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThe resulting plot from this code looks like this:\n\n![Example Plot](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MGR1b.png)\n\nI would appreciate any guidance on how to hide the axes and gridlines."

        "content": "To hide the axes and gridlines in a 3D plot using Matplotlib, you can modify your code as follows. You can use the `ax.set_axis_off()` method to turn off the axes, and to remove the gridlines, you can use `ax.grid(False)`:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\n\n# Assuming pL and pW are defined somewhere in your script\npL = 10  # Example value\npW = 10  # Example value\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\n\n# Set the view angle\nax.view_init(30, -90)\n\n# Remove axes\nax.set_axis_off()\n\n# Remove gridlines\nax.grid(False)\n\n# Set limits\nax.set_xlim(0, pL)\nax.set_ylim(0, pW)\nax.set_zlim(0, 10)  # Set a limit for the Z axis if needed\n\n# Set aspect ratio\nax.set_box_aspect([pL, pW, 10])  # Adjust the aspect ratio as needed\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `ax.set_axis_off()`: This command hides the axes, which includes the labels and ticks.\n- `ax.grid(False)`: This disables the gridlines on the plot.\n\nIf the image quality gets poor when you zoom in or out, ensure you are using a high DPI setting when saving your plot or displaying it. You can set the DPI using `plt.savefig('filename.png', dpi=300)` for saving the image with higher resolution. However, in interactive mode, the quality may depend on your display settings and Matplotlib's backend configuration."
