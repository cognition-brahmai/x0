I attempted to merge them with the following code: `mergeDict = dict(a.items() + b.items())`, however, the result is a dictionary that is no longer ordered. For example, if `a = {1, 2, 5, 6}` and `b = {0, 7, 3, 9}`, I'm aiming to get `mergeDict = {1, 2, 5, 6, 0, 7, 3, 9}`. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "In Python, you can use the `collections.OrderedDict` to maintain the order of dictionary items. Since Python 3.7, the built-in `dict` type also maintains insertion order, but for versions prior to that, you'll need to rely on `OrderedDict`.\n\nHere's how you can merge two ordered dictionaries while maintaining the order:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\n# Assuming a and b are OrderedDict instances\na = OrderedDict([(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (5, 'c'), (6, 'd')])\nb = OrderedDict([(0, 'e'), (7, 'f'), (3, 'g'), (9, 'h')])\n\n# Create a new OrderedDict by extending the items of a and b\nmergeDict = OrderedDict()\nmergeDict.update(a)\nmergeDict.update(b)\n\n# Print the merged dictionary to verify the order\nprint(mergeDict)\n```\n\nBy using `update()`, the items from dictionary `b` are added to `mergeDict` after the items from dictionary `a`, preserving the order in which they were added. Note that if there are duplicate keys between `a` and `b`, the value from `b` will overwrite the value from `a` in the `mergeDict`. If you are using Python 3.7 or later, you can achieve the same result using the built-in `dict` type:\n\n```python\na = {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 5: 'c', 6: 'd'}\nb = {0: 'e', 7: 'f', 3: 'g', 9: 'h'}\n\n# Create a new dictionary and update it with a and b\nmergeDict = {}\nmergeDict.update(a)\nmergeDict.update(b)\n\n# Print the merged dictionary to verify the order\nprint(mergeDict)\n```\n\nThis will give you the merged dictionary with the order `{1: 'a', 2: 'b', 5: 'c', 6: 'd', 0: 'e', 7: 'f', 3: 'g', 9: 'h'}`."
