I want to create a new dataframe with the following changes: For each set of duplicate `STATION_ID` values, I want to keep the row with the most recent entry for `DATE_CHANGED`. If the duplicate entries for the `STATION_ID` all have the same `DATE_CHANGED`, then I want to drop the duplicates and keep only a single row for the `STATION_ID`. If there are no duplicates for the `STATION_ID` value, then I want to keep the row as is. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "You can achieve this by using the Pandas library to manipulate your DataFrame. The following code will help you accomplish your task:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'DATE_CHANGED': ['2023-10-01', '2023-10-02', '2023-10-02', '2023-10-03', '2023-10-01'],\n    'STATION_ID': [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\ndf['DATE_CHANGED'] = pd.to_datetime(df['DATE_CHANGED'])\n\n# Sort the DataFrame by 'STATION_ID' and 'DATE_CHANGED'\ndf.sort_values(by=['STATION_ID', 'DATE_CHANGED'], ascending=[True, False], inplace=True)\n\n# Drop duplicates keeping the first occurrence (most recent 'DATE_CHANGED' due to sorting)\ndf_unique = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['STATION_ID'], keep='first')\n\n# Sort the result by 'STATION_ID' to maintain a consistent order\ndf_unique.sort_values(by='STATION_ID', inplace=True)\n\n# Reset index for neatness\ndf_unique.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)\n\nprint(df_unique)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what this code does:\n\n1. **Sorting**: It sorts the DataFrame by `STATION_ID` and `DATE_CHANGED` in descending order. This ensures that the most recent dates appear first for each `STATION_ID`.\n\n2. **Dropping Duplicates**: It uses `drop_duplicates()` to remove duplicate `STATION_ID` entries, keeping only the first occurrence (which is the most recent due to the sorting).\n\n3. **Sorting and Resetting Index**: Finally, it sorts the resulting DataFrame by `STATION_ID` for consistent order and resets the index for a clean DataFrame.\n\nThis will give you a DataFrame where for each set of duplicate `STATION_ID` values, only the row with the most recent `DATE_CHANGED` is retained, and if there are ties in `DATE_CHANGED`, only one of the duplicates is kept."
