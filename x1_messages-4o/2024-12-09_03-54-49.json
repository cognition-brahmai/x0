For example, in the expression 3 + x + x**2 + a*x*2, I want to extract the coefficients of x, x**2, etc. While I know how to get the coefficient of a specific term using coeff(), I am looking for a way to extract all coefficients. I tried using the method as_coefficients_dict(), but it doesn't seem to work as I expected."

        "content": "To extract all coefficients from a sympy expression, you can utilize the `as_coefficients_dict()` method in combination with iterating over the terms. The `as_coefficients_dict()` method returns a dictionary where the keys are the terms in the expression and the values are their corresponding coefficients. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the symbols\nx, a = symbols('x a')\n\n# Define the expression\nexpr = 3 + x + x**2 + a*x*2\n\n# Expand the expression if needed\nexpanded_expr = expand(expr)\n\n# Get the coefficients as a dictionary\ncoeff_dict = expanded_expr.as_coefficients_dict()\n\n# Display the coefficients\nfor term, coeff in coeff_dict.items():\n    print(f'Coefficient of {term}: {coeff}')\n```\n\nIn this example, `coeff_dict` will contain all the terms as keys and their coefficients as values. Iterating over this dictionary will give you the coefficients for each term in the expression. This approach should work well for extracting coefficients of all terms in a given sympy expression."
