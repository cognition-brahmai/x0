I've attempted to use `os.stat(f,'r').st_mtim` to do so, but I'm encountering an IOError: [Errno 13] file not accessible. I understand that updating or deleting files may not be possible, but is reading also restricted?"

        "content": "On Google App Engine, particularly in the standard environment, the filesystem is read-only except for the `/tmp` directory, which is writable at runtime. This means that while you're able to read files that are part of your deployed application, you cannot use functions like `os.stat` to get file metadata such as the last modified time. This is because the file system is abstracted away, and such metadata is not accessible in the standard environment.\n\nIf you need to access metadata like the last modified time, consider these alternatives:\n\n1. **Include Metadata in the Code**: If you know the last modified time of the files at the time of deployment, you can hardcode this information or include it in a separate metadata file that your application can read.\n\n2. **Use Google Cloud Storage**: If your files are stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS), you can use the GCS client library to access metadata about the files, including the last modified time.\n\n3. **App Engine Flexible Environment**: If you require more control over the file system, consider using the App Engine flexible environment, which provides more flexibility in terms of file system access.\n\n4. **Store Metadata in Datastore or Firestore**: If the last modified time is important for your application's logic, consider storing this information in a database like Datastore or Firestore, where you can read it as needed.\n\nFor most scenarios involving file metadata, using Google Cloud Storage is a suitable solution as it provides robust metadata support, including last modified timestamps."
