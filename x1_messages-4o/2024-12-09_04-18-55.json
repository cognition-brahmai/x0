I have a two-dimensional array of coordinates such as `x = array([[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]])` and a mask that looks like `mask = [False,False,True]`. When I attempt to use this mask on the 2D coordinate vector, I encounter an error message: `numpy.ma.core.MaskError: Mask and data not compatible: data size is 6, mask size is 3.` I attempted to use an alternative mask: `mask2 = np.column_stack((mask,mask))`, however, the output is not as expected. Instead of a 2D array, I get a 1D array. Is there an easier way to do this?"

        "content": "To properly mask a two-dimensional NumPy array using a one-dimensional mask, you should ensure that the mask is applied along the appropriate axis. In your case, you want to mask rows in a 2D array based on a 1D mask. Here's how you can do it:\n\nGiven your array `x` and the mask `mask`, you can apply the mask directly to select only the rows where the mask is `False`. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Your 2D array of coordinates\nx = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]])\n\n# Your mask\nmask = np.array([False, False, True])\n\n# Use the mask to filter the rows in the array\nmasked_array = x[~mask]\n\nprint(masked_array)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `mask` is a 1D array that indicates which rows should be excluded (where `True`) or included (where `False`).\n- Using `~mask` in `x[~mask]` inverts the boolean values in `mask`, so you select rows where `mask` is `False`.\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[[1 2]\n [2 3]]\n```\n\nThis approach directly masks the rows of the 2D array `x` according to the 1D `mask`. There's no need to reshape or stack the mask."
