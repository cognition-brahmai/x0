        "content": "In Python, there are various ways to define an empty object, and it's not always necessary to create an instance of a custom empty class. Here are a few methods you can use to create an empty object:\n\n1. **Using a Custom Class:**\n   You can define an empty class and create an instance of it. This is a more explicit way:\n\n   ```python\n   class Empty:\n       pass\n\n   empty_object = Empty()\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `object()`:**\n   You can use the built-in `object` class to create a minimalistic object. This is a quick way to create an empty object:\n\n   ```python\n   empty_object = object()\n   ```\n\n   However, note that this object doesn't allow you to dynamically add attributes to it.\n\n3. **Using `types.SimpleNamespace`:**\n   Starting from Python 3.3, you can use `types.SimpleNamespace` to create an empty object. This allows you to dynamically add attributes, which is useful for duck typing:\n\n   ```python\n   from types import SimpleNamespace\n\n   empty_object = SimpleNamespace()\n   ```\n\n   You can add attributes to this object as needed:\n\n   ```python\n   empty_object.some_attribute = 'value'\n   ```\n\nFor duck typing, the `types.SimpleNamespace` approach is particularly useful as it allows you to dynamically add and check for attributes, making it flexible for various use cases."
