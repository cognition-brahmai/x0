How can I modify my code to achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired outcome, you need to extract each file individually and save it directly into the target directory, stripping any folder structure from the file paths. You can achieve this by using the `os.path.basename()` function, which extracts only the file name from a given file path. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport zipfile\nimport os\n\nmy_dir = \"D:\\\\Download\\\\\"\nmy_zip = \"D:\\\\Download\\\\my_file.zip\"\n\n# Ensure the target directory exists\nos.makedirs(my_dir, exist_ok=True)\n\nwith zipfile.ZipFile(my_zip, 'r') as zip_file:\n    for file_info in zip_file.infolist():\n        # Get the file name only, without any directory structure\n        file_name = os.path.basename(file_info.filename)\n        # Skip directories\n        if not file_name:\n            continue\n\n        # Define the new path in the target directory\n        extracted_path = os.path.join(my_dir, file_name)\n\n        # Open the file from the zip and write it to the new location\n        with zip_file.open(file_info) as source, open(extracted_path, 'wb') as target:\n            target.write(source.read())\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **`os.path.basename()`**: This function extracts the file name from a path, effectively stripping away any directory structure.\n- **Skip Directories**: Directories in the zip file will have an empty `basename`, so we skip them.\n- **`os.makedirs()`**: This ensures that the target directory exists before extraction, using `exist_ok=True` to avoid errors if it already exists.\n- **`zip_file.open()`**: This method is used to open the file in the zip archive, which is then written to the target directory.\n\nThis approach will extract all files into the specified directory without retaining any subdirectory structure from the zip file."
