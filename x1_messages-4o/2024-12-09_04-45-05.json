Here is the code that I have written:\n\n```python\ndef get_all_substrings(string):\n  length = len(string)\n  alist = []\n  for i in xrange(length):\n    for j in xrange(i,length):\n      alist.append(string[i:j + 1]) \n  return alist\n\nprint get_all_substring('abcde')\n```\n\nCan anyone suggest a better way to solve this problem?"

        "content": "Your current approach is already quite straightforward and efficiently generates all contiguous substrings of a given string. However, Python 3 has replaced `xrange()` with `range()`, so if you're using Python 3, you'll need to update that. Additionally, you can optimize the code slightly by using list comprehensions, which are generally more concise and can be more efficient. Here's the updated version of your function using list comprehensions:\n\n```python\ndef get_all_substrings(string):\n    length = len(string)\n    return [string[i:j+1] for i in range(length) for j in range(i, length)]\n\nprint(get_all_substrings('abcde'))\n```\n\nThis version does the same thing as your original code but in a more concise manner. It leverages Python's list comprehension feature, which is often faster because it is implemented in C under the hood. However, the time complexity for generating all contiguous substrings remains O(n^2), as you need to consider all pairs of start and end indices."
