The function should take into account the following constraints: \n- The left child of a node has a value less than the parent node, and the right child has a value greater than the parent node. \n- There are no duplicate values in the tree. \n- The tree may contain up to 10,000 nodes. \n- The function should return a boolean value indicating whether the tree is a binary search tree or not. \nIn addition, provide a sample binary tree with at least 20 nodes for testing purposes."

        "content": "To determine if a binary tree is a binary search tree (BST) using SQL, we need to ensure that each node satisfies the BST properties relative to its ancestors. SQL is not inherently designed for recursive tree traversal, but we can simulate this using common table expressions (CTEs) and joins to propagate constraints down the tree.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Table Structure**: Assume we have a table `BinaryTree` with the columns `id`, `value`, `parent_id`, `is_left_child` (a boolean indicating whether the node is a left child of its parent).\n\n2. **Sample Data**: Let's create a sample binary tree with at least 20 nodes.\n\n3. **SQL Query**: Write a query using a common table expression (CTE) to check the BST properties.\n\n### Sample Binary Tree Structure\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE BinaryTree (\n    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    value INT NOT NULL,\n    parent_id INT,\n    is_left_child BOOLEAN,\n    FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES BinaryTree(id)\n);\n\n-- Sample data (at least 20 nodes)\nINSERT INTO BinaryTree (id, value, parent_id, is_left_child) VALUES\n(1, 15, NULL, NULL),  -- Root node\n(2, 10, 1, TRUE),\n(3, 20, 1, FALSE),\n(4, 5, 2, TRUE),\n(5, 12, 2, FALSE),\n(6, 18, 3, TRUE),\n(7, 25, 3, FALSE),\n(8, 3, 4, TRUE),\n(9, 7, 4, FALSE),\n(10, 11, 5, TRUE),\n(11, 13, 5, FALSE),\n(12, 17, 6, TRUE),\n(13, 19, 6, FALSE),\n(14, 23, 7, TRUE),\n(15, 30, 7, FALSE),\n(16, 1, 8, TRUE),\n(17, 4, 8, FALSE),\n(18, 6, 9, TRUE),\n(19, 8, 9, FALSE),\n(20, 16, 12, TRUE);\n```\n\n### SQL Query to Check BST\n\n```sql\nWITH RECURSIVE CheckBST AS (\n    SELECT\n        id,\n        value,\n        parent_id,\n        is_left_child,\n        value AS min_value,\n        value AS max_value\n    FROM BinaryTree\n    WHERE parent_id IS NULL  -- Start with the root node\n\n    UNION ALL\n\n    SELECT\n        bt.id,\n        bt.value,\n        bt.parent_id,\n        bt.is_left_child,\n        CASE\n            WHEN bt.is_left_child THEN cbst.min_value\n            ELSE cbst.value\n        END AS min_value,\n        CASE\n            WHEN bt.is_left_child THEN cbst.value\n            ELSE cbst.max_value\n        END AS max_value\n    FROM BinaryTree bt\n    JOIN CheckBST cbst ON bt.parent_id = cbst.id\n    WHERE\n        (bt.is_left_child AND bt.value < cbst.value) OR\n        (NOT bt.is_left_child AND bt.value > cbst.value)\n)\n\nSELECT NOT EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1\n    FROM CheckBST\n    WHERE value <= min_value OR value >= max_value\n) AS is_bst;\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The CTE `CheckBST` recursively traverses the tree, starting from the root (where `parent_id` is `NULL`).\n- For each node, it calculates the permissible range (`min_value` and `max_value`) based on whether it's a left or right child.\n- It checks if the current node's value fits within its permissible range.\n- The final `SELECT` checks if there are any violations of the BST properties in the entire tree.\n\nThis query should return `true` if the tree is a binary search tree, and `false` otherwise. Adjust the sample data to test various cases, ensuring that the tree structure is correctly represented in the `BinaryTree` table."
