I am trying to start a thread in a loop using `my_thread.start()`, but it fails to start more than one thread. Previously, I was using `my_thread.run()`, which worked, but now I am confused if `run()` is actually running a separate thread. Also, how should I be creating and starting threads? Can I pass variables into `start()`?"

        "content": "When working with threads in Python using the `threading` module, understanding the difference between `start()` and `run()` is crucial for correct thread management:\n\n1. **`start()` Method**:\n   - The `start()` method is used to initiate a thread\u2019s activity. When you call `start()`, it invokes the `run()` method in a separate thread of control. This means the `run()` method is executed in a new, separate thread, allowing your program to continue executing other code concurrently.\n   - Proper usage of threads requires you to call `start()` so that your task runs concurrently with the main thread or other threads.\n\n2. **`run()` Method**:\n   - The `run()` method is the entry point for a thread\u2019s activity but calling `run()` directly will not start a new thread; it will simply execute `run()` in the current thread, blocking it until `run()` completes.\n   - This is why when you were using `my_thread.run()`, it appeared to work, but was actually running sequentially in the main thread, not concurrently.\n\n3. **Creating and Starting Threads**:\n   - To properly create and start a thread, you should subclass `threading.Thread` and override the `run()` method to define what the thread will do. Then, create an instance of your subclass and call the `start()` method.\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     import threading\n\n     class MyThread(threading.Thread):\n         def __init__(self, arg):\n             super().__init__()\n             self.arg = arg\n\n         def run(self):\n             # Your thread code here\n             print(f\"Thread running with argument {self.arg}\")\n\n     # Create and start threads\n     for i in range(5):\n         thread = MyThread(i)\n         thread.start()\n     ```\n\n4. **Passing Arguments to Threads**:\n   - You cannot pass arguments directly via `start()`. Instead, you should pass arguments to the thread's constructor and store them in instance variables, as shown in the example above.\n   - Alternatively, you can use the `threading.Thread` constructor with the `target` and `args` parameters to specify a function and its arguments:\n     ```python\n     import threading\n\n     def thread_function(arg):\n         print(f\"Thread running with argument {arg}\")\n\n     for i in range(5):\n         thread = threading.Thread(target=thread_function, args=(i,))\n         thread.start()\n     ```\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can effectively create and manage multiple threads in your Python application."
