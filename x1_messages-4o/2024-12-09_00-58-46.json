I only want to initialize keys as I do not know the corresponding values until I have to set them later. For instance, I would like to do something like this:\n\n```python\nDefinition = {'apple': , 'ball': }\n```\n\nAnd then later I can set the values:\n\n```python\nDefinition[key] = something\n```\n\nI know what keys I want but I will add the values as they are found."

        "content": "In Python, you can initialize a dictionary with keys but without setting any corresponding values by assigning a placeholder value, like `None`, to each key. This approach allows you to define the keys in advance and set the values later. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Initialize the dictionary with keys and None as placeholder values\nDefinition = {'apple': None, 'ball': None}\n\n# Later, set the values as needed\nDefinition['apple'] = 'A fruit'\nDefinition['ball'] = 'A spherical object'\n\nprint(Definition)\n```\n\nIn this example, `None` is used as a placeholder value, which signifies that the value is yet to be defined. You can later update the dictionary with actual values for each key as shown. This approach provides a clear structure and allows you to manage your dictionary entries effectively."
