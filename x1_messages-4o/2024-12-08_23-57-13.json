        "content": "To solve the inequality \\(9x + 8 > 17\\), we'll follow a series of algebraic steps to isolate the variable \\(x\\). Here's a detailed guide on how to do it:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Write Down the Inequality:**\n   \\[\n   9x + 8 > 17\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract 8 from Both Sides:**\n   To isolate the term with \\(x\\), subtract 8 from each side of the inequality.\n   \\[\n   9x + 8 - 8 > 17 - 8\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   9x > 9\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 9:**\n   To solve for \\(x\\), divide each side of the inequality by 9.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9x}{9} > \\frac{9}{9}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   x > 1\n   \\]\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Subtracting 8**: The goal is to isolate \\(x\\) on one side, so we remove the constant 8 by subtracting it from both sides.\n- **Dividing by 9**: This step isolates \\(x\\) by eliminating the coefficient in front of it. Since we are dividing by a positive number, the direction of the inequality remains unchanged.\n\n### Solution:\nThe solution to the inequality \\(9x + 8 > 17\\) is \\(x > 1\\).\n\n### Verification and Representation:\n\n1. **Number Line:**\n   - Draw a number line.\n   - Mark a point at \\(x = 1\\).\n   - Use an open circle at \\(x = 1\\) to indicate that 1 is not included in the solution.\n   - Shade the region to the right of 1 to represent all numbers greater than 1.\n\n2. **Interval Notation:**\n   - The solution can be expressed in interval notation as \\((1, \\infty)\\).\n   - Here, the parenthesis indicates that 1 is not included in the solution, and infinity always has a parenthesis.\n\n### Verification:\nTo verify the solution, choose a number greater than 1 and substitute it back into the original inequality. For example, let \\(x = 2\\).\n\n- Substitute \\(x = 2\\) into the original inequality:\n  \\[\n  9(2) + 8 > 17 \\implies 18 + 8 > 17 \\implies 26 > 17\n  \\]\n- Since the inequality holds true, \\(x = 2\\) is a valid solution, confirming that \\(x > 1\\) is indeed correct.\n\nThis comprehensive approach should help you understand how to solve the inequality \\(9x + 8 > 17\\) and verify the solution."
