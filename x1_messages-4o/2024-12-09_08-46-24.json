I've been trying to convert this list to a numpy array and then getting the shape using numpy.ndarray.shape(). However, when I try to convert my list (which is a converted PyTorch Tensor, using list(pytorchTensor)) into an array, I receive a ValueError: only one element tensors can be converted to Python scalars. How can I get the shape of this list without converting it into a numpy array? The list looks like this:\n\n```\n[\ntensor([[-0.2781, -0.2567, -0.2353,  ..., -0.9640, -0.9855, -1.0069],  \n        [-0.2781, -0.2567, -0.2353,  ..., -1.0069, -1.0283, -1.0927],  \n        [-0.2567, -0.2567, -0.2138,  ..., -1.0712, -1.1141, -1.1784],  \n        ...,  \n        [-0.6640, -0.6425, -0.6211,  ..., -1.0712, -1.1141, -1.0927],  \n        [-0.6640, -0.6425, -0.5997,  ..., -0.9426, -0.9640, -0.9640],  \n        [-0.6640, -0.6425, -0.5997,  ..., -0.9640, -0.9426, -0.9426]]),\n\ntensor([[-0.0769, -0.0980, -0.0769,  ..., -0.9388, -0.9598, -0.9808],  \n        [-0.0559, -0.0769, -0.0980,  ..., -0.9598, -1.0018, -1.0228],    \n        [-0.0559, -0.0769, -0.0769,  ..., -1.0228, -1.0439, -1.0859],  \n        ...,  \n        [-0.4973, -0.4973, -0.4973,  ..., -1.0018, -1.0439, -1.0228],  \n        [-0.4973, -0.4973, -0.4973,  ..., -0.8757, -0.9177, -0.9177],  \n        [-0.4973, -0.4973, -0.4973,  ..., -0.9177, -0.8967, -0.8967]]),\n\ntensor([[-0.1313, -0.1313, -0.1100,  ..., -0.8115, -0.8328, -0.8753],  \n        [-0.1313, -0.1525, -0.1313,  ..., -0.8541, -0.8966, -0.9391],  \n        [-0.1100, -0.1313, -0.1100,  ..., -0.9391, -0.9816, -1.0666],  \n        ...,  \n        [-0.4502, -0.4714, -0.4502,  ..., -0.8966, -0.8966, -0.8966],  \n        [-0.4502, -0.4714, -0.4502,  ..., -0.8115, -0.8115, -0.7903],  \n        [-0.4502, -0.4714, -0.4502,  ..., -0.8115, -0.7690, -0.7690]]),\n] \n```"
