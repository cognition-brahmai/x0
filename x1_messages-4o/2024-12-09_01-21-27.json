How can I generate and display all the numbers at once?"

        "content": "The current code prints the list after each number is appended, which is why you see the list being printed one element at a time. If you want to generate and display all the numbers at once, you should move the `print` statement outside of the `for` loop. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nmy_randoms = []\nfor i in range(10):\n    my_randoms.append(random.randrange(1, 101, 1))\n\nprint(my_randoms)  # Print the list after all numbers are generated\n```\n\nThis code will populate `my_randoms` with 10 random numbers between 1 and 100, and then print the entire list after the loop has finished."
