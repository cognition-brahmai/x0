The function should also be able to handle variations in grammar and word order within the sentence. Additionally, the function should be able to handle cases where the targeted word is part of a larger word (e.g. \"understanding\" within \"misunderstanding\")."

        "content": "To handle the task of removing specific words from sentences in a dataset, we can create a Python function that processes each sentence, identifies and removes the targeted words, and handles word variations. We'll use regular expressions to ensure that we only remove the exact words and not parts of larger words. Here's a function to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef remove_target_words(sentences, target_words):\n    # Create a regex pattern for each target word to match whole words only\n    target_patterns = [r'\\b' + re.escape(word) + r'\\b' for word in target_words]\n    \n    # Combine all patterns into a single regex pattern\n    combined_pattern = '|'.join(target_patterns)\n    \n    # Process each sentence\n    processed_sentences = []\n    for sentence in sentences:\n        # Use regex to substitute the target words with an empty string\n        processed_sentence = re.sub(combined_pattern, '', sentence, flags=re.IGNORECASE)\n        # Remove extra spaces caused by deletions and strip leading/trailing spaces\n        processed_sentence = ' '.join(processed_sentence.split())\n        processed_sentences.append(processed_sentence)\n    \n    return processed_sentences\n\n# Example usage\nreviews = [\n    \"This is the best course I have ever taken\",\n    \"Understanding the basics is essential\",\n    \"Misunderstanding can lead to errors\"\n]\n\nwords_to_delete = [\"best\", \"Understanding\"]\n\ncleaned_reviews = remove_target_words(reviews, words_to_delete)\nfor review in cleaned_reviews:\n    print(review)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Regex Patterns**: We create a regex pattern for each target word using `\\b` to match whole words only, and `re.escape` to ensure special characters in words are treated literally.\n2. **Combined Pattern**: We combine all individual patterns into a single pattern using the `|` operator, which acts as a logical OR.\n3. **Case Insensitivity**: We use `flags=re.IGNORECASE` to ensure that the function is case-insensitive, handling variations in capitalization.\n4. **Cleaning Up**: After removing the words, we use `' '.join(sentence.split())` to remove any extra spaces that may result from word removal.\n\nThis function will remove the specified words from the sentences, ensuring that only whole words are removed and not substrings within larger words."
