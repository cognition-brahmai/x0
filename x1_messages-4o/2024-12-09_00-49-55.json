You can do this using the package manager `pip`. Here\u2019s how you can install it:\n\n1. **Open your command prompt or terminal**:\n   - On Windows, you can search for \"Command Prompt\" in the Start menu.\n   - On macOS or Linux, open the Terminal application.\n\n2. **Install the requests module**:\n   Run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n   If you are using Python 3, you might need to use `pip3` instead:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 install requests\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify the installation**:\n   After the installation completes, you can verify it by starting a Python shell and trying to import the module again:\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n   ```\n\n4. **Check your Python environment**:\n   Make sure you are installing the package in the correct Python environment, especially if you are using virtual environments or multiple Python versions. You can check which Python version you are using with:\n\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n   Or for Python 3:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 --version\n   ```\n\n5. **Use a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:\n   If you are not already using a virtual environment, it\u2019s a good practice to create one and install packages within it to avoid conflicts with other projects.\n\n   To create a virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   ```\n\n   Activate it:\n\n   - On Windows:\n\n     ```bash\n     myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n     ```\n\n   - On macOS/Linux:\n\n     ```bash\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n   Then install `requests` within this environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `ImportError` and successfully import the `requests` module in your Python script."
