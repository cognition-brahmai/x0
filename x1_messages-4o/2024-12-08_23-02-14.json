        "content": "Let's use the given clues to solve the puzzle step-by-step:\n\n1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes purple is twice as old as the person who likes blue.\n   - Possible pairs: (16, 8), (20, 10), (24, 12), (28, 14).\n   - Since the ages are 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28, the only valid pair is (24, 12).\n\n2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes red is 4 years younger than the person who likes green.\n   - Possible pairs: (12, 16), (16, 20), (20, 24), (24, 28).\n   - We know 12 is taken by blue, so valid pairs are (16, 20), (20, 24), (24, 28).\n\n3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow is either 12 or 28 years old.\n   - Since 12 is taken by blue, yellow must be 28 years old.\n\n4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes painting is 8 years older than the person who likes photography.\n   - Possible pairs: (20, 12), (24, 16).\n   - Since 12 is taken by blue, valid pair is (24, 16).\n\n5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes reading is not the youngest.\n   - The youngest is 12, and they like blue, so reading is not associated with age 12.\n\nNow, let's piece everything together:\n\n- From clue 1, blue is 12, purple is 24.\n- From clue 3, yellow is 28.\n- From clue 4, purple likes painting, photography is 16.\n- From clue 2, valid pair for red and green is (20, 24) or (16, 20).\n  - If green is 24, red is 20.\n  - But 24 is purple, so green cannot be 24.\n  - Thus, green is 20 and red is 16.\n- From clue 5, reading is not 12. Reading could be 16, 20, or 28.\n  - Since 16 is red, reading must be 20 or 28.\n  - Since 20 is green and no hobby is yet associated, reading is 20.\n- The only age left without a hobby is 28, which is yellow. \n\nSo, the final assignments are:\n\n- Age 12: Blue, Photography\n- Age 16: Red, (unknown hobby)\n- Age 20: Green, Reading\n- Age 24: Purple, Painting\n- Age 28: Yellow, (unknown hobby)\n\nThe unknown hobbies for 16 and 28 can be any unassigned hobbies, such as dancing or chess, if only those were given. However, based on this setup, these are the most logical associations based on provided clues."
