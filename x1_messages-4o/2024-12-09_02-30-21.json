I want to retrieve and print an element if there's a match for a substring, like `abc`.\n\nCurrently, I have the following code:\n\n```python\nsub = 'abc'\nprint any(sub in mystring for mystring in mylist)\n```\nThis prints `True` if any of the elements in the list contain the pattern `abc`. However, my objective is to print the specific element which matches the substring. For example, if I'm checking `'abc'`, I want to print `'abc123'` from the list. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To find and print the specific element that contains a given substring from a list, you can iterate through the list and check if each element contains the substring. If it does, you can print that element. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nmylist = ['abc123', 'def456', 'ghi789']\nsub = 'abc'\n\n# Iterate through each element in the list\nfor mystring in mylist:\n    # Check if the substring is in the current element\n    if sub in mystring:\n        # Print the element if the substring is found\n        print(mystring)\n```\n\nThis code will print `'abc123'` because it contains the substring `'abc'`. You can replace `'abc'` with any other substring you want to search for, and the code will print all elements in the list that contain that substring."
