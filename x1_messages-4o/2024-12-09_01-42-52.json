For example, the CSV looks like this:\n\n```\nlocation    name    Jan-2010    Feb-2010    March-2010\nA           \"test\"  12          20          30\nB           \"foo\"   18          20          25\n```\n\nI would like to reformat this data so that it looks like this:\n\n```\nlocation    name    Date        Value\nA           \"test\"  Jan-2010    12       \nA           \"test\"  Feb-2010    20\nA           \"test\"  March-2010  30\nB           \"foo\"   Jan-2010    18       \nB           \"foo\"   Feb-2010    20\nB           \"foo\"   March-2010  25\n```\n\nThe problem is, I don't know how many dates are in the column (although I know they will always start after the 'name' column). How can I convert the columns into rows with Pandas?"

        "content": "You can achieve this transformation using the `pandas` library in Python by utilizing the `melt` function. This function is ideal for reshaping data, allowing you to transform columns into rows. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load your CSV file into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')\n\n# Use melt to reshape the DataFrame\nreshaped_df = df.melt(id_vars=['location', 'name'], var_name='Date', value_name='Value')\n\n# Display the reshaped DataFrame\nprint(reshaped_df)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what each part of the `melt` function does:\n\n- `id_vars=['location', 'name']`: These are the columns that you want to keep as identifiers. They remain unchanged.\n- `var_name='Date'`: This sets the name of the new column that will contain the old column headers (the dates in your case).\n- `value_name='Value'`: This sets the name of the new column that will contain the data from the cells.\n\nThis will give you the desired format, converting your wide-formatted data into a long format. Make sure to replace `'your_file.csv'` with the actual path to your CSV file."
