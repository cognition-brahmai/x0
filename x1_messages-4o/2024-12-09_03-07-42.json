When I try to set the aspect ratio to 'equal', the z-axis does not change to 'equal'. Here is the code that I am currently using:\n\n```python\nfig = pylab.figure()\nmesFig = fig.gca(projection='3d', adjustable='box')\nmesFig.axis('equal')\nmesFig.plot(xC, yC, zC, 'r.')\nmesFig.plot(xO, yO, zO, 'b.')\npyplot.show()\n```\n\nThis gives me a graph where the unit length of the z-axis is not equal to the unit lengths of the x- and y- axes. All the solutions I have found so far do not work. How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "To achieve an equal aspect ratio in a 3D plot using `matplotlib`, you need to manually set the limits of each axis to ensure that they are equal. Unfortunately, `matplotlib` does not have a built-in function to automatically adjust the aspect ratio of 3D plots to be equal across all axes as it does for 2D plots. However, you can do this by setting the limits of the axes manually.\n\nHere's a way to ensure that the unit lengths on all axes are equal:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example data\nxC, yC, zC = np.random.rand(3, 100)\nxO, yO, zO = np.random.rand(3, 100)\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\n\n# Plotting the data points\nax.plot(xC, yC, zC, 'r.')\nax.plot(xO, yO, zO, 'b.')\n\n# Setting the same limits for all axes\nmax_range = np.array([xC.max()-xC.min(), yC.max()-yC.min(), zC.max()-zC.min()]).max() / 2.0\n\nmid_x = (xC.max()+xC.min()) * 0.5\nmid_y = (yC.max()+yC.min()) * 0.5\nmid_z = (zC.max()+zC.min()) * 0.5\n\nax.set_xlim(mid_x - max_range, mid_x + max_range)\nax.set_ylim(mid_y - max_range, mid_y + max_range)\nax.set_zlim(mid_z - max_range, mid_z + max_range)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. We first determine the range of values for each axis by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value.\n2. We find the maximum of these ranges and use it to set the limits for all three axes. This ensures that the unit length on each axis is equal.\n3. The axes limits are set around the midpoint of each axis to center the data.\n\nThis approach ensures that the aspect ratio is effectively equal across all axes, making your 3D plot more accurate in terms of spatial representation."
