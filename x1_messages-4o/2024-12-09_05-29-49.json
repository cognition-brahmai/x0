        "content": "The error you're encountering arises because you're trying to directly assign a `task` object to a composite field in your `task_info` message. In Protocol Buffers, composite fields (like nested messages) are not directly assignable; instead, you need to use the `CopyFrom` method to copy the contents of one message into another.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to resolve the error:\n\n```python\ntask = yacc.task()\ntask.id = 1000\ntask.msg = u\"test\"\n\nptask = yacc.task_info()\nptask.task.CopyFrom(task)  # Use CopyFrom to set the nested message\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **CopyFrom Method**: Protocol Buffers uses `CopyFrom` to assign one message to another. This is necessary because the fields are not directly assignable due to how Protocol Buffers manages memory and encoding.\n  \n- **Avoid Direct Assignment**: Direct assignment to a composite field is not allowed, which is why you encountered the `AttributeError`.\n\nBy using `CopyFrom`, you effectively copy the properties of the `task` message into the `task` field of the `task_info` message. This should resolve the error and allow you to proceed with transmitting your data."
