I have a dataframe that looks like this:\n\n```python\n     fruits | numFruits\n---------------------\n0  | apples |   10\n1  | grapes |   20\n2  |  figs  |   15\n```\n\nAnd I want to transform it to look like this:\n\n```python\n                 apples | grapes | figs\n-----------------------------------------\nMarket 1 Order |    10  |   20   |  15\n```\n\nI have tried using `pivot()`, `pivot_table()`, `Transpose` and `unstack()` but none of them seem to give me the desired result. Any help would be appreciated as I am new to Pandas."

        "content": "To transform your DataFrame from a column orientation to a row orientation as you've described, you can use the `set_index()` method along with `transpose()` (`T`) to achieve the desired result. Here's how you can do this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create the initial DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'fruits': ['apples', 'grapes', 'figs'],\n    'numFruits': [10, 20, 15]\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Set 'fruits' as the index and transpose the DataFrame\ndf_transformed = df.set_index('fruits').T\n\n# Rename the index to 'Market 1 Order' to match your desired output\ndf_transformed.index = ['Market 1 Order']\n\nprint(df_transformed)\n```\n\nThis will produce the following output:\n\n```\n                apples  grapes  figs\nMarket 1 Order      10      20    15\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what the code does:\n- `set_index('fruits')`: Sets the 'fruits' column as the index of the DataFrame.\n- `T`: Transposes the DataFrame, converting columns into rows and rows into columns.\n- `df_transformed.index = ['Market 1 Order']`: Renames the index of the transposed DataFrame to 'Market 1 Order'.\n\nThis should give you the desired format."
