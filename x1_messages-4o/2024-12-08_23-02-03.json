        "content": "Two compounds containing a carbon-hydrogen bond that are commonly used as organic solvents in the pharmaceutical industry are:\n\n1. **Toluene (C\u2086H\u2085CH\u2083):** Toluene is an aromatic hydrocarbon commonly used as a solvent for its ability to dissolve a wide range of organic compounds. It is often used in the synthesis and purification of pharmaceuticals.\n\n2. **Methanol (CH\u2083OH):** Methanol is a simple alcohol with a carbon-hydrogen bond. It is frequently used as a solvent in pharmaceutical applications due to its polar nature and ability to mix with water and other organic compounds.\n\nBoth of these solvents are integral in various chemical reactions and processes within the pharmaceutical industry."
