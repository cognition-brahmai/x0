        "content": "Prime numbers are fundamental elements in mathematics, cryptography, and computer science due to their unique properties and applications. Let's explore their significance and provide a detailed multiplication table for prime numbers between 2 and 10.\n\n### Significance of Prime Numbers\n\n#### In Mathematics:\n1. **Building Blocks of Numbers**: Prime numbers are the building blocks of all natural numbers. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, every integer greater than 1 can be uniquely represented as a product of prime numbers.\n2. **Number Theory**: They play a crucial role in number theory, a branch of pure mathematics devoted to studying the properties and relationships of numbers. Many mathematical conjectures and theorems are based on the properties of prime numbers.\n3. **Distribution**: The distribution of prime numbers is a deep area of research. The Prime Number Theorem provides an approximation of the distribution of primes, and the Riemann Hypothesis, one of the most famous unsolved problems, is related to the distribution of primes.\n\n#### In Cryptography:\n1. **Public-Key Cryptography**: Prime numbers are essential for cryptographic algorithms such as RSA, which rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime components. The security of these systems is based on the practical difficulty of factoring large product numbers.\n2. **Secure Communication**: Primes are used in various cryptographic protocols to secure digital communication. The generation of large prime numbers is fundamental to creating secure cryptographic keys.\n\n#### In Computer Science:\n1. **Algorithms**: Primes are used in several algorithms, including hashing functions and pseudo-random number generators.\n2. **Data Structures**: Prime numbers are often used in designing data structures like hash tables, where a prime number size can help in evenly distributing data to avoid collisions.\n3. **Complexity Theory**: Problems related to prime numbers, such as primality testing and integer factorization, are significant in complexity theory and computational mathematics.\n\n### Multiplication Table of Prime Numbers (2 to 10)\n\nBelow is a multiplication table for the prime numbers between 2 and 10, displaying each product in its expanded form:\n\n```\n|     | 2 (2x1)    | 3 (3x1)    | 5 (5x1)    | 7 (7x1)    |\n|-----|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| 2   | 4 (2x2)    | 6 (2x3)    | 10 (2x5)   | 14 (2x7)   |\n| 3   | 6 (3x2)    | 9 (3x3)    | 15 (3x5)   | 21 (3x7)   |\n| 5   | 10 (5x2)   | 15 (5x3)   | 25 (5x5)   | 35 (5x7)   |\n| 7   | 14 (7x2)   | 21 (7x3)   | 35 (7x5)   | 49 (7x7)   |\n```\n\nEach entry in the table represents a product of two prime numbers, with the expanded form showing the multiplicands and the resulting product. Prime numbers' properties and applications make them an indispensable part of various fields, influencing both theoretical and practical aspects of mathematics, cryptography, and computer science."
