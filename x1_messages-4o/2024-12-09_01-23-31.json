I'm currently stuck on a problem which requires me to create and return a student object with name, age, and major as input. I have a function `make_student(name, age, major)` and a class `Student` with attributes `name`, `age`, `major`. However, I'm unsure what it means to return an object. Should I create an array inside the function that holds these values? or create a class and let this function be inside it, and assign instances? Here is the class I have so far:\n\n```python\nclass Student:\n    name = \"Unknown name\"\n    age = 0\n    major = \"Unknown major\"\n```"

        "content": "To create and return a `Student` object, you don't need to use an array to hold the values. Instead, you should use the class definition to create an instance of the `Student` class and then return that instance from the function `make_student`.\n\nHere's how you can define the `Student` class and the `make_student` function to achieve this:\n\n```python\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name, age, major):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n        self.major = major\n\ndef make_student(name, age, major):\n    return Student(name, age, major)\n\n# Example usage\nstudent1 = make_student(\"Alice\", 20, \"Computer Science\")\nprint(student1.name)  # Output: Alice\nprint(student1.age)   # Output: 20\nprint(student1.major) # Output: Computer Science\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Class Definition**:\n   - The `Student` class has an `__init__` method, which is a special method in Python known as the initializer. It is called when you create an instance of the class.\n   - The `__init__` method takes `self` as the first parameter, which is a reference to the current instance of the class. It also takes `name`, `age`, and `major` as additional parameters to initialize the instance attributes.\n\n2. **Instance Attributes**:\n   - Inside the `__init__` method, you set the instance attributes (`self.name`, `self.age`, `self.major`) to the values provided when the instance is created.\n\n3. **Function `make_student`**:\n   - This function takes `name`, `age`, and `major` as arguments and returns a new instance of the `Student` class with these values.\n\nBy following this approach, you can create and return `Student` objects from the `make_student` function, allowing you to easily manage student data using instances of the class."
