        "content": "To convert a string in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD' to a date type in Python, you can use the `datetime` module. Specifically, you can use the `datetime.strptime()` method to parse the string and convert it into a `datetime` object. Once you have a `datetime` object, you can use the `isoweekday()` method to find out the day of the week.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Your string\ndate_string = '2012-02-10'\n\n# Convert the string to a datetime object\ndate_object = datetime.strptime(date_string, '%Y-%m-%d')\n\n# Use isoweekday() to get the day of the week\n# isoweekday() returns 1 for Monday and 7 for Sunday\nday_of_week = date_object.isoweekday()\n\nprint(day_of_week)\n```\n\nIn this example, `strptime()` is used to parse `date_string` using the format `'%Y-%m-%d'`, which corresponds to the year-month-day format of the input string. The `isoweekday()` method then returns the day of the week as an integer, where Monday is 1 and Sunday is 7."
