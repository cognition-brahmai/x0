However, there's a catch - the list includes a few fake temperatures that were mistakenly recorded. These fake temperatures are either 10 degrees Celsius lower or higher than the actual temperature at that time. Can you identify and remove these fake temperatures before calculating the average temperature for the day?"

        "content": "To calculate the average temperature accurately, we need to identify and remove the fake temperature readings. Since the fake temperatures are either 10 degrees Celsius lower or higher than the actual temperature, we can use statistical analysis to identify and remove these outliers.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: Gather the list of hourly temperatures recorded on December 15, 2020.\n\n2. **Initial Analysis**: Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the temperature list to get an overview of the data distribution.\n\n3. **Identify Outliers**: Identify potential outliers by checking which temperatures deviate significantly from the mean. A common method is to consider any temperature that falls outside the range of mean \u00b1 2*standard deviation as an outlier.\n\n4. **Remove Outliers**: Remove these identified outliers from the list.\n\n5. **Recalculate the Average**: After removing the outliers, calculate the mean of the remaining temperature data to get the average temperature for the day.\n\nHere is a rough code outline in Python that does this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example list of temperatures (replace this with actual data)\ntemperatures = [15, 16, 15, 25, 14, 15, 16, 5, 17, 15, 15, 16, 15, 15, 24]\n\n# Calculate mean and standard deviation\nmean_temp = np.mean(temperatures)\nstd_dev = np.std(temperatures)\n\n# Identify outliers\noutliers = [temp for temp in temperatures if (temp < mean_temp - 2*std_dev) or (temp > mean_temp + 2*std_dev)]\n\n# Filter out the outliers\nfiltered_temperatures = [temp for temp in temperatures if temp not in outliers]\n\n# Calculate the average of the filtered list\naverage_temperature = np.mean(filtered_temperatures)\n\nprint(\"Filtered Temperatures:\", filtered_temperatures)\nprint(\"Average Temperature:\", average_temperature)\n```\n\nThis approach assumes that the majority of the recorded temperatures are accurate and that the fake temperatures are statistical outliers. Adjust the threshold according to the specific characteristics of your dataset if necessary."
