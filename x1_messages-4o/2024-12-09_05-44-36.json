In Objective-C, a NSNotFound enum is returned (which is just a max int, indicating the item wasn't found) but in Python, an error is thrown. I have created a workaround, where I used -1 to indicate the item wasn't found. However, I am wondering if there is a better way to do this. Why doesn't Python have a built-in function for this? Here is the workaround I have come up with:\n\n```python\nindex = 0\nfor item in self.items:\n   if item.id == desired_id:\n        return index\n    index = index + 1\nreturn -1\n```"

        "content": "Your workaround is a common approach in Python when you want to find the index of an item in a list without raising an error if the item is not found. However, there is a more Pythonic way to achieve this using the `enumerate` function, which allows you to iterate over a list and get both the index and the item. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef find_index(items, desired_id):\n    for index, item in enumerate(items):\n        if item.id == desired_id:\n            return index\n    return -1\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also use a try-except block with the built-in `index` method, which will raise a `ValueError` if the item is not found. This approach is less efficient because it searches the list twice, but it may be easier to read in some contexts:\n\n```python\ndef find_index(items, desired_id):\n    try:\n        return next(index for index, item in enumerate(items) if item.id == desired_id)\n    except StopIteration:\n        return -1\n```\n\nPython doesn't have a built-in function that returns a special value like `NSNotFound` when an item is not found because it follows the \"Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission\" (EAFP) principle, which encourages handling exceptions rather than checking conditions beforehand. However, using `-1` as an indicator for \"not found\" is a common and acceptable pattern in Python."
