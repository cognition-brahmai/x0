        "content": "In computer science, a \"tree\" is a widely-used abstract data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes. It is a Turing-complete concept when used within a computational system that can simulate any Turing machine. Here's a formal definition:\n\n1. **Node**: Each element of a tree is called a node. A node contains a value or data and may have a link to other nodes.\n\n2. **Root**: The topmost node of a tree is called the root. There is only one root node in a tree, and it serves as the starting point of the tree.\n\n3. **Child**: A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root is called a child.\n\n4. **Parent**: A node directly connected to another node when moving towards the root is called a parent.\n\n5. **Leaf**: Nodes that do not have any children are called leaves or leaf nodes.\n\n6. **Subtree**: Any node of a tree, along with its descendants, can be considered as a subtree.\n\n7. **Edge**: The connection between two nodes is called an edge.\n\n8. **Depth**: The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.\n\n9. **Height**: The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.\n\n10. **Binary Tree**: A tree where each node has at most two children, often referred to as the left child and the right child.\n\n11. **Balanced Tree**: A tree where the height of the two child subtrees of any node differ by no more than one.\n\nIn the context of programming, trees are used in various applications such as representing hierarchical data, managing sorted lists, facilitating fast lookup operations, and more. They form the basis for binary search trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, B-trees, and many other specialized structures."
