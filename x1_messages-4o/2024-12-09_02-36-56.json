For instance, when using the filter method as shown below, how can I make it use 'OR' instead of 'AND'?\n\n```python\nPublisher.objects.filter(name__contains=\"press\", country__contains=\"U.S.A\")\n```\n\nThis automatically translates into the following SQL:\n\n```sql\nSELECT ... \nFROM publisher\nWHERE name LIKE '%press%'\nAND country LIKE '%U.S.A.%'\n```\n\nI am unable to find this in the Django documentation."

        "content": "To achieve the equivalent of an SQL `OR` operation in Django's ORM, you can use the `Q` objects. The `Q` objects allow you to construct complex queries by combining filters with logical operators like `OR`. Here's how you can modify your query to use `OR` instead of `AND`:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models import Q\n\n# Using Q objects to create an OR query\npublishers = Publisher.objects.filter(\n    Q(name__contains=\"press\") | Q(country__contains=\"U.S.A\")\n)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Q` objects are used to specify the conditions, and the `|` (pipe) operator is used to combine them with an `OR`. As a result, this query will retrieve publishers where the name contains \"press\" or the country contains \"U.S.A\". \n\nThis translates into the following SQL:\n\n```sql\nSELECT ... \nFROM publisher\nWHERE name LIKE '%press%'\nOR country LIKE '%U.S.A.%'\n```\n\nUsing `Q` objects is a powerful way to build more complex queries by combining multiple conditions with logical operators in Django."
