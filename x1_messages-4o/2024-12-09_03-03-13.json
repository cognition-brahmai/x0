        "content": "Yes, you can definitely use Doxygen to generate documentation for CUDA `.cu` files. By default, Doxygen might not recognize `.cu` as a standard file extension for C++ source files, which is likely why your `.cu` files are being ignored. However, you can configure Doxygen to process these files by modifying the Doxygen configuration file (`Doxyfile`). Here are the steps you can follow:\n\n1. **Edit the `Doxyfile`:** Open your Doxygen configuration file, which is typically named `Doxyfile`.\n\n2. **Add the `.cu` Extension:**\n   - Locate the `FILE_PATTERNS` setting in the `Doxyfile`. This setting specifies which file patterns Doxygen should consider for documentation.\n   - Add `*.cu` to the list of file patterns. It might look like this:\n     ```plaintext\n     FILE_PATTERNS = *.c *.cpp *.h *.hpp *.cu\n     ```\n\n3. **Set Input Directories:**\n   - Ensure that the `INPUT` setting includes the directories where your `.cu` files are located. For example:\n     ```plaintext\n     INPUT = src include\n     ```\n\n4. **Enable Parsing:**\n   - Ensure that `EXTRACT_ALL` is set to `YES` if you want Doxygen to extract documentation from all comment blocks, not just those with special Doxygen tags.\n     ```plaintext\n     EXTRACT_ALL = YES\n     ```\n\n5. **Run Doxygen:**\n   - After updating the `Doxyfile`, run Doxygen again to regenerate the documentation.\n\n6. **Verify the Output:**\n   - Check the generated documentation to ensure that the `.cu` files are included and documented correctly.\n\nBy configuring Doxygen to recognize `.cu` files, you should be able to generate documentation for your CUDA source files just like you would for standard C++ files. If you encounter any issues, ensure that your comment blocks are correctly formatted for Doxygen to parse them."
