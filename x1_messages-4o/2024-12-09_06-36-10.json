        "content": "To read only the column names of a CSV file into a list using Python, you can utilize the `csv.DictReader` to automatically obtain the field names. However, it looks like the code you've shared is attempting to use both `csv.reader` and `csv.DictReader` in a way that might not produce the desired results. Here's how you can read the header row efficiently:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\n# Open the CSV file\nwith open('details.csv', newline='') as csvfile:\n    # Use DictReader to read the file, which automatically reads the header\n    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)\n    # Get the fieldnames, which are the column names\n    column_names = reader.fieldnames\n\n# Print the column names\nprint(column_names)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `csv.DictReader` reads the first line of the CSV file as the fieldnames by default, so you don't need to read the first row separately.\n- The `fieldnames` attribute of `DictReader` gives you the list of column names directly.\n- Ensure that the CSV file path is correct and that the file is accessible.\n- Also, make sure there are no extra spaces in the column headers within the CSV file, as they may cause unexpected keys.\n\nThis should give you a list containing `[\"id\", \"name\", \"age\", \"sex\"]`. If your CSV file has no header or if the header is not on the first line, you would need to adjust your approach to handle those cases."
