However, when I try to load the model in Python 3.6 on my Windows 10 laptop using the `load_weights` method in Keras, I encounter a ValueError with Keras. How can I define the architecture of my model so I can use this model to predict on my Windows 10 laptop?"

        "content": "To load a saved model's weights in Keras and use it for predictions, you need to define the model architecture before loading the weights. This is because the weights alone do not contain information about the model's architecture. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Define the Model Architecture:**\n   You need to define the exact same model architecture that you used for training. This includes the type of layers, number of neurons, activation functions, etc.\n\n2. **Load the Weights:**\n   After defining the model, you can then load the weights from the saved file.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\n\n# Step 1: Define the model architecture\ndef create_model():\n    model = Sequential()\n    model.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_dim=your_input_dim))\n    model.add(Dense(units=32, activation='relu'))\n    model.add(Dense(units=1))  # Assuming a single output for regression\n    return model\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = create_model()\n\n# Step 2: Load the weights\nmodel.load_weights(\"kwhFinal.h5\")\n\n# Step 3: Compile the model (if necessary)\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')\n\n# Now you can use the model for predictions\n# Example:\n# predictions = model.predict(your_input_data)\n```\n\n### Important Notes:\n- **Input Dim**: Replace `your_input_dim` with the input dimension of your data that was used during training. It's crucial that this matches the original model.\n- **Compile Step**: Compiling the model is only necessary if you want to evaluate it or continue training. For just making predictions, it\u2019s not required.\n- **Dependencies**: Ensure that the versions of Keras and TensorFlow on your Windows machine are compatible with those used during training on the Linux platform.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully load your model weights and perform predictions on your Windows 10 laptop."
