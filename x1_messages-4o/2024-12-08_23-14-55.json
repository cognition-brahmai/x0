For example, if my array contains the strings \"apple\", \"banana\", \"carrot\", and \"date\", I want \"apple\" and \"banana\" to always appear at the beginning of the sorted list, followed by the remaining strings in alphabetical order.\nHere is the array in Ruby code:\nfruits = [\"banana\", \"date\", \"apple\", \"carrot\"]\nWhat Ruby code can I use to achieve this sorting behavior?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired sorting behavior in Ruby, you can use the `sort_by` method along with a custom sorting logic. You want to prioritize certain strings (\"apple\" and \"banana\" in this case) to always appear at the beginning of the sorted list, followed by the remaining strings in alphabetical order. \n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```ruby\nfruits = [\"banana\", \"date\", \"apple\", \"carrot\"]\n\npriority_fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\"]\n\nsorted_fruits = fruits.sort_by do |fruit|\n  # Assign a priority value to each fruit.\n  # Fruits in the priority list get a lower value (0), others get 1.\n  [priority_fruits.include?(fruit) ? 0 : 1, fruit]\nend\n\nputs sorted_fruits\n```\n\nThis code works as follows:\n1. Use `sort_by` to sort the array based on custom criteria.\n2. For each fruit, it checks if it's in the `priority_fruits` list.\n3. If it's a priority fruit, it's assigned a priority value of `0`, otherwise `1`.\n4. The fruits are then sorted first by their priority value, and then alphabetically by their names.\n\nThe output will be:\n```\napple\nbanana\ncarrot\ndate\n```\n\nThis ensures that \"apple\" and \"banana\" appear at the beginning, followed by the rest of the fruits sorted alphabetically."
