        "content": "Finding publicly available SOAP 1.2/WSDL 2.0 compliant web services for testing can be a bit challenging, as many services have moved towards REST APIs. However, there are still a few options you can explore:\n\n1. **Public SOAP Services**: \n   - **CountryInfoService**: A service that provides information about countries.\n   - **CurrencyConvertor**: Offers currency conversion information.\n\n2. **Create Your Own SOAP Service**:\n   - You can create your own SOAP service using frameworks like Apache CXF (Java) or .NET WCF. This way, you have complete control over the WSDL and can ensure it is SOAP 1.2 compliant.\n\n3. **SOAP Mocking Tools**:\n   - Use tools like SoapUI to mock SOAP services. SoapUI allows you to create and simulate SOAP services based on WSDL files, which can be very helpful for testing.\n\n4. **Testing with Python**:\n   - You can use Python libraries like `zeep` for creating SOAP clients. Zeep is a modern SOAP client for Python that supports both SOAP 1.1 and 1.2.\n\n5. **Online SOAP Testing Platforms**:\n   - Websites like WebServiceX.NET used to offer SOAP services for testing, but many are now defunct or have switched to REST.\n\n6. **Google Web API**:\n   - Google's SOAP Search API was discontinued, but if you have an existing API key, you might still be able to use it for testing, though this is not guaranteed.\n\nFor testing, you can start by setting up a simple SOAP server locally and then configure your Python client to interact with it. This will give you the flexibility to test various scenarios and ensure compliance with SOAP 1.2."
