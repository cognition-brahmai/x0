Initially, the Java Virtual Machine would not start, but I fixed that by editing the nsight.ini file and removing `-XX:MaxPermSize=256m` and updating `-Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion`. Now, I can get the splash screen and select a workspace directory. However, it crashes after showing a progress bar and only suggests looking in the log file for information. The log file contains the following entries: \n\n```\n!SESSION 2016-12-09 20:30:40.686 -----------------------------------------------\neclipse.buildId=unknown\njava.version=9-internal\njava.vendor=Oracle Corporation\nBootLoader constants: OS=linux, ARCH=x86_64, WS=gtk, NL=en_GB\nCommand-line arguments:  -os linux -ws gtk -arch x86_64\n\n... (remaining entries) ...\n```\n\nI installed nsight along with cuda using the NVIDIA .deb package repository from their website. I added it using `dpkg -i <cuda_file>.deb` and installed using `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt install cuda`. Standard eclipse installations work perfectly. Can anyone provide advice on how to resolve this issue?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're encountering compatibility issues between Nvidia Nsight and the version of Java you're using. Here are some potential solutions to address this issue:\n\n1. **Java Version Compatibility**: Nsight may not be fully compatible with Java 9. You might want to try using Java 8, which is more commonly supported by many applications. To do this, you can:\n\n   - Install Java 8: \n     ```bash\n     sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk\n     ```\n\n   - Set Java 8 as the default:\n     ```bash\n     sudo update-alternatives --config java\n     ```\n\n   - Select Java 8 from the list.\n\n2. **Check Nsight Documentation**: Verify the specific Java version requirements for the version of Nsight you're using. This information can usually be found in the installation documentation or release notes.\n\n3. **Environment Variables**: Ensure that the environment variables `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` are set to point to the Java 8 installation. You can add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:\n\n   ```bash\n   export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64\n   export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH\n   ```\n\n   Then, reload the configuration:\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n\n4. **Eclipse Configuration**: Since Nsight is based on Eclipse, ensure that the `nsight.ini` file points to the correct Java version. Add or modify the `-vm` argument in `nsight.ini` to specify the path to the Java 8 binary:\n\n   ```\n   -vm\n   /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/bin/java\n   ```\n\n5. **Log File Analysis**: Review the full log file generated by Nsight for any specific error messages that could provide more insight into the problem. Sometimes the log file contains detailed error messages that can point you in the right direction.\n\n6. **System Updates**: Make sure your system is fully updated, as there could be dependencies that need updates.\n\n7. **Reinstallation**: As a last resort, consider reinstalling Nsight to ensure all files and configurations are correct. You might also want to verify that you have the latest version of Nsight and CUDA.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the compatibility issue and get Nvidia Nsight running smoothly."
