        "content": "The error you're experiencing suggests that the code is expecting a string to check if certain substrings are present, but it\u2019s receiving a `PosixPath` object instead. This usually happens when you use the `pathlib` module for file paths and the code expects a plain string.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Convert `PosixPath` to String**: The error is likely occurring because somewhere in your database settings, a `Path` object from the `pathlib` module is used instead of a string. You should convert these `Path` objects to strings. For instance, in your `settings.py` file, make sure the database name is a string:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   from pathlib import Path\n\n   BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent\n\n   DATABASES = {\n       'default': {\n           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',\n           'NAME': str(BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3'),\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   By using `str(BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3')`, you ensure that the path is a string, not a `PosixPath`.\n\n2. **Check for Other Occurrences**: The same conversion should be applied to any other path settings you might have configured using `pathlib.Path` to ensure they're all strings where necessary.\n\n3. **Update Django**: Although it's not the root cause, consider updating Django if possible. Django 2.2 is an older version, and upgrading to a more recent version might prevent issues like these if they have been addressed in newer releases.\n\n4. **Review Third-Party Libraries**: If you are using any third-party libraries that might interact with your database settings, ensure they are up-to-date and compatible with Django 2.2.\n\nAfter making these changes, try running the `python3 manage.py check` command again. This should resolve the `TypeError` you encountered."
