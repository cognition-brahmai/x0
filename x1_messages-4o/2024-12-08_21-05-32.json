Your task is to create a new sequence of numbers based on the following rules:\n- Each number in the new sequence must be a prime number.\n- The new sequence must have exactly 4 numbers.\n- Each number in the new sequence must be created by subtracting the digits of two different numbers in the given sequence.\nFor example, if you subtract the digits of 7 from 17, you get 10. If you subtract the digits of 11 from 21, you get 10. The resulting sequence would be: 2, 3, 5, 7.\nYour goal is to write a program that can generate all possible valid sequences based on these rules. The program should take the original sequence as input and output all possible valid sequences. The output should be in the following format:\n|Original Sequence| New Sequence |\n|-----------------|--------------|\n|5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21| 2, 3, 5, 7|\nYour challenge is to create a program that requires reasoning and logic to solve, making it difficult for current AI systems to handle. Good luck!"

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to generate a sequence of prime numbers by subtracting the digits of two different numbers from the given sequence. Let's break down the steps and create a Python program to accomplish this:\n\n1. Extract the digits of each number in the original sequence.\n2. Subtract the digits of two different numbers to get a new number.\n3. Check if the resulting number is a prime number.\n4. Ensure the new sequence contains exactly four distinct prime numbers.\n5. Output all possible valid sequences.\n\nHere's a Python program to generate the possible valid sequences:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\nimport sympy\n\n# Function to check if a number is prime\ndef is_prime(n):\n    return sympy.isprime(n)\n\n# Function to extract digits and subtract them\ndef subtract_digits(a, b):\n    a_digits = [int(d) for d in str(a)]\n    b_digits = [int(d) for d in str(b)]\n    return abs(sum(a_digits) - sum(b_digits))\n\n# Generate all combinations of pairs from the sequence\ndef generate_prime_sequences(original_sequence):\n    valid_sequences = []\n    for pair in combinations(original_sequence, 2):\n        new_number = subtract_digits(pair[0], pair[1])\n        if is_prime(new_number):\n            valid_sequences.append(new_number)\n    return valid_sequences\n\n# Given original sequence\noriginal_sequence = [5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21]\n\n# Find all prime numbers by subtracting digits\npossible_primes = generate_prime_sequences(original_sequence)\n\n# Filter sequences with exactly 4 distinct primes\nunique_primes = set(possible_primes)\nvalid_sequences = [seq for seq in combinations(unique_primes, 4)]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"|Original Sequence| New Sequence |\")\nprint(\"|-----------------|--------------|\")\nfor seq in valid_sequences:\n    print(f\"|{', '.join(map(str, original_sequence))}| {', '.join(map(str, sorted(seq)))}|\")\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- We first define a function to check if a number is prime using the `sympy.isprime()` function.\n- We then extract the digits from the numbers in the original sequence and subtract them.\n- We iterate through all possible pairs of numbers from the original sequence and calculate the subtracted value.\n- We check if the result is a prime number and keep track of all unique prime numbers generated.\n- Finally, we create all combinations of the unique primes with a length of 4 and print the valid sequences.\n\nThis program will output all possible valid sequences based on the rules provided."
