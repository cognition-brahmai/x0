        "content": "To use `ForwardAgent yes` with Fabric to execute commands on a remote server and leverage your local SSH agent for operations like `git clone`, you need to ensure that SSH agent forwarding is enabled. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Ensure SSH Agent Forwarding is Enabled:**\n\n   First, make sure that your local SSH configuration is set to forward the agent. In your local `~/.ssh/config` file, add or update the following configuration:\n\n   ```plaintext\n   Host <your-remote-host>\n       ForwardAgent yes\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<your-remote-host>` with the hostname or IP address of the remote server you are connecting to.\n\n2. **Configure Fabric:**\n\n   When using Fabric, you can specify that SSH agent forwarding should be used. Here\u2019s how you can set it up in your Fabric script:\n\n   ```python\n   from fabric import Connection\n\n   # Replace with your actual remote host, user, and any other needed details\n   host = \"<your-remote-host>\"\n   user = \"<your-user>\"\n\n   # Establish a connection with SSH agent forwarding enabled\n   conn = Connection(host=host, user=user, forward_agent=True)\n\n   # Run the git clone command on the remote server\n   result = conn.run('git clone ssh://private/repo')\n\n   print(result.stdout)\n   ```\n\n   This script connects to the remote server using the specified host and user, with SSH agent forwarding enabled via the `forward_agent=True` parameter.\n\n3. **Start the SSH Agent Locally:**\n\n   If not already running, start your SSH agent and add your private key:\n\n   ```bash\n   eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\n   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n   ```\n\n   Replace `~/.ssh/id_rsa` with the path to your private key if it's different.\n\n4. **Test the Setup:**\n\n   Run your Fabric script and check if the `git clone` operation is successful using your local SSH agent credentials.\n\nBy setting up SSH agent forwarding, your local SSH keys are used for authentication on the remote server, allowing you to clone private repositories without needing to copy your private keys to the remote server."
