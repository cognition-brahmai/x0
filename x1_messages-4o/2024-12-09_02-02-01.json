        "content": "To verify if a text file is empty in Python, you can check the file size or read its contents. Here are two common methods:\n\n### Method 1: Check File Size\nYou can use the `os` module to check the file size. If the size is 0 bytes, the file is empty.\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nfile_path = 'path/to/your/file.txt'\n\nif os.path.getsize(file_path) == 0:\n    print(\"The file is empty.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The file is not empty.\")\n```\n\n### Method 2: Read File Content\nYou can open the file and read its contents to determine if it's empty.\n\n```python\nfile_path = 'path/to/your/file.txt'\n\nwith open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n    content = file.read()\n    if not content:\n        print(\"The file is empty.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The file is not empty.\")\n```\n\nBoth methods will help you determine if a text file is empty. Choose the one that best fits your requirements."
