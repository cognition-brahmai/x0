I have installed NVIDIA-driver 410.93 and cuda-toolkit 10.0. After compiling the cuda-samples, when I try to run ./deviceQuery, it returns an error: \"cudaGetDeviceCount returned 30 -> unknown error. Result = FAIL\". I have provided more information on my system configurations and command outputs. Is this problem related to modprobe or nvidia-uvm? I've asked this on NVIDIA-devtalk forum but haven't received a response yet. Can you please suggest a solution?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests an issue with the NVIDIA driver or CUDA setup not recognizing the GPU properly. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Driver Installation**: First, ensure that the NVIDIA driver is correctly installed and running. You can check this by running:\n   ```\n   nvidia-smi\n   ```\n   This command should display information about the GPU and the driver version. If this command fails, there might be an issue with the driver installation.\n\n2. **Check Kernel Module**: Ensure that the NVIDIA kernel modules are loaded. You can check this with:\n   ```\n   lsmod | grep nvidia\n   ```\n   If the modules are not loaded, you might need to load them manually using:\n   ```\n   sudo modprobe nvidia\n   sudo modprobe nvidia-uvm\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Additional Packages**: Sometimes, missing dependencies can cause issues. Make sure you have the following packages installed:\n   ```\n   sudo yum install kernel-devel kernel-headers\n   ```\n\n4. **Reinstall or Update NVIDIA Driver**: If there's a problem with the driver, consider reinstalling or updating it. Ensure you remove the existing driver completely before reinstalling:\n   ```\n   sudo yum remove xorg-x11-drv-nvidia\\*\n   ```\n   Then reinstall the NVIDIA driver.\n\n5. **Check Compatibility**: Check if the CUDA version (10.0) is compatible with the driver version (410.93) and your GPU model. Sometimes updating either CUDA or the driver can resolve compatibility issues.\n\n6. **Reinstall CUDA Toolkit**: If the issue persists, consider reinstalling the CUDA toolkit:\n   ```\n   sudo yum remove cuda\n   sudo yum install cuda\n   ```\n\n7. **Verify CUDA Setup**: After installation, verify the CUDA setup by checking environment variables:\n   ```\n   echo $PATH\n   echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n   Ensure that paths to CUDA binaries and libraries are included.\n\n8. **Check Logs**: Look at the system logs for any error messages related to NVIDIA:\n   ```\n   dmesg | grep -i nvidia\n   ```\n\n9. **Secure Boot**: If your system has Secure Boot enabled, it might prevent the NVIDIA kernel modules from loading. Consider disabling Secure Boot in the BIOS settings.\n\nIf you've tried all these steps and the issue persists, it may be helpful to look for specific error messages in the logs or to try a different combination of driver and CUDA versions. Additionally, ensure that your system BIOS and firmware are up to date."
