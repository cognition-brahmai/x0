I have this piece of code:\n\n```python\ncap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)\n\nwhile True:\n    ret, frame = cap.read() #returns ret and the frame\n    cv2.imshow('frame',frame)\n\n    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):\n        break\n```\n\nWhen I use `cv2.waitKey(1)`, I get a continuous live video feed from my laptop's webcam. However when I use `cv2.waitKey(0)`, I only get still images. Every time I close the window, another one pops up with another picture taken at that time. How come it doesn't show as a continuous feed with `cv2.waitKey(0)`?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to the different functionalities of `cv2.waitKey()` in OpenCV.\n\n1. **`cv2.waitKey(1)`**: This function waits for 1 millisecond for a key event. If no key is pressed in that time, the program continues executing. This is why you see a continuous video feed; the delay is minimal, allowing your loop to run almost continuously, updating the frames as they are captured.\n\n2. **`cv2.waitKey(0)`**: This function waits indefinitely for a key event. When you use `cv2.waitKey(0)`, the program pauses execution and waits for a key press before proceeding. This is why you only see a still image until you press a key, and upon pressing a key, the loop continues to the next iteration, capturing and displaying the next frame as a still image.\n\nFor a continuous video feed, you should use `cv2.waitKey(1)`, which introduces a very short delay and allows the loop to refresh the displayed frame continuously. If you need to control the frame rate more precisely, you can adjust the delay value in `cv2.waitKey()` to a higher number, such as `cv2.waitKey(30)`, which would approximate a 30 frames per second rate."
