        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the `render` function in your `user_profile` view is not returning an `HttpResponse` object. Instead, it's being called without capturing its return value, which means your function ends up returning `None` by default.\n\nThe `render` function in Django is used to combine a given template with a given context dictionary and return an `HttpResponse` object with that rendered text. To fix your issue, you need to return the result of the `render` function call. Additionally, note that `context_instance` is not needed in this newer version of Django as `context` is used instead.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nfrom django.shortcuts import render\nfrom django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login\n\ndef user_profile(request):\n    \"\"\"Displays information unique to the logged-in user.\"\"\"\n\n    user = authenticate(username='superuserusername', password='superuserpassword')\n    if user is not None:\n        login(request, user)\n        return render(request, 'auth_lifecycle/user_profile.html')\n    else:\n        # Handle the case where authentication fails\n        # For example, you may want to redirect to a login page or show an error message\n        return render(request, 'auth_lifecycle/login.html', {'error': 'Authentication failed'})\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the view function returns the `HttpResponse` object that `render` produces. Additionally, I've included a check to ensure that the user is authenticated before calling `login`, and added a simple error handling case for when authentication fails. You might want to customize this further based on your application's needs."
