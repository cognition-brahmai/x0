I am using `flow_from_directory` to get the training set from a folder with a structure like this:\n\n```\ntrain\n  class1\n  class2\n  class3\n  ...\n```\n\nI'm calling the generator like this:\n\n```\ntrain_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory( \n        train_data_dir,                              \n        target_size=(img_height, img_width),         \n        batch_size=32,                               \n        class_mode='categorical')  \n```\n\nI am not setting the `classes` argument, assuming that the labels would be in alphabetical order. However, when I classify the training images to check the labels being returned, I'm not getting any specific order. The training goes fine with an accuracy of around 85%, and there is consistency with the output labels when classifying images from the same class. How can I infer the labels numbers generated by `flow_from_directory` and map them to the classes?"

        "content": "To retrieve the label IDs and map them to the class names when using `flow_from_directory` in Keras, you can use the `class_indices` attribute of the generator. This attribute provides a dictionary mapping the class names to their corresponding integer labels. Here's how you can access and use it:\n\n```python\n# Assuming train_generator is your data generator\ntrain_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(\n    train_data_dir,\n    target_size=(img_height, img_width),\n    batch_size=32,\n    class_mode='categorical'\n)\n\n# Retrieve the class indices\nclass_indices = train_generator.class_indices\n\n# Printing the class indices\nprint(\"Class Indices:\")\nprint(class_indices)\n\n# You can create a reverse mapping if needed\nreverse_class_indices = {v: k for k, v in class_indices.items()}\n\n# Printing the reverse mapping\nprint(\"Reverse Class Indices:\")\nprint(reverse_class_indices)\n```\n\nThis will give you a dictionary where the keys are the class names (e.g., 'class1', 'class2', etc.), and the values are the integer labels assigned by `flow_from_directory`. The `reverse_class_indices` dictionary provides the inverse mapping, which can be useful for interpreting model outputs.\n\nThis mapping is based on the alphabetical order of the class folder names by default. Therefore, if your directory structure is like:\n\n```\ntrain\n  class1\n  class2\n  class3\n```\n\nYou can expect the keys in `class_indices` to be `{'class1': 0, 'class2': 1, 'class3': 2}` if 'class1', 'class2', 'class3' are sorted alphabetically.\n\nBy using these mappings, you can easily interpret the output of your model and ensure that the labels correspond to the correct class names."
