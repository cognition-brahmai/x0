I understand that to use permanent sessions, I would have to set `session.permanent = True` and the expiration date is based on `config['PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME']`. However, it seems odd that there is no direct way to request permanent sessions through configuration like `config['USE_PERMANENT_SESSION'] = True`. Where is the best place to define these permanent sessions? Should it be done in an `@app.before_request` function even though it means setting it at each request? Is it better to only request permanent sessions when processing `login_user()`, using volatile session cookies for all anonymous pages and switching to permanent sessions upon sign-in? Lastly, is there a way to set different lifetimes for the `session` cookie and the `remember_me` cookie?"

        "content": "Implementing permanent sessions in Flask requires a bit of manual setup, as you've noted. Here's a detailed guide on how you can achieve this, along with some considerations for different approaches:\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n1. **Configure Permanent Sessions:**\n   - Set `session.permanent = True` in your application. This will make the session cookie persistent across browser sessions.\n   - Define the lifetime of the session using `app.config['PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME']`. This config value expects a `timedelta` object.\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask, session\n   from datetime import timedelta\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n   app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'\n   app.config['PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME'] = timedelta(days=7)  # Example: 7 days\n   ```\n\n2. **Decide on When to Use Permanent Sessions:**\n   - **Global Approach:** Use an `@app.before_request` function to set `session.permanent = True` for all users, making all sessions permanent.\n\n     ```python\n     @app.before_request\n     def make_session_permanent():\n         session.permanent = True\n     ```\n\n   - **Selective Approach:** Set `session.permanent = True` only after certain actions, such as user login. This approach is more efficient if you only want logged-in users to have persistent sessions.\n\n     ```python\n     @app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])\n     def login_user():\n         # Authenticate user...\n         session.permanent = True  # Set session to permanent after login\n         # Continue with login logic...\n     ```\n\n3. **Handling Different Lifetimes for `session` and `remember_me`:**\n   - Flask does not natively support different lifetimes for different cookies. However, if you're using Flask-Login, it provides a `remember_me` feature that can be configured separately.\n   - Set a different `remember_me` duration by configuring `REMEMBER_COOKIE_DURATION`.\n\n   ```python\n   from flask_login import LoginManager\n\n   login_manager = LoginManager()\n   login_manager.init_app(app)\n   app.config['REMEMBER_COOKIE_DURATION'] = timedelta(days=30)  # Example: 30 days\n   ```\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **Efficiency:** If you set `session.permanent = True` globally, every session will be persistent, which might not be necessary for all users. Consider the selective approach to reduce unnecessary load.\n- **Security:** Be mindful of security implications. Permanent sessions mean cookies remain on the user's browser for a longer time, increasing the risk if a user's device is compromised.\n- **User Experience:** Consider user perception and experience. For apps where users expect to stay logged in, longer session durations are beneficial. For more sensitive applications, shorter sessions might be preferable.\n\nBy configuring sessions thoughtfully, you can balance between user convenience and security needs."
