In C, I would do it like so:\n\n```c\nuint32_t number=100;\narray[0]=(number >>24) & 0xff;\narray[1]=(number >>16) & 0xff;\narray[2]=(number >>8) & 0xff;\narray[3]=number & 0xff;\n```\n\nCould someone provide me with a Python equivalent for this? It feels a bit strange for me to program without explicit data types."

        "content": "Certainly! In Python, you can achieve the same effect using the `to_bytes` method available for integer objects. This method will convert your integer into a byte array. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nnumber = 100\n# Convert the unsigned integer to a byte array of 4 bytes (32 bits)\nbyte_array = number.to_bytes(4, byteorder='big')\n\n# Print the byte array to see the result\nprint(list(byte_array))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `4` is the number of bytes you want in the array (since `uint32_t` is 4 bytes).\n- `byteorder='big'` specifies that the most significant byte is at the beginning of the byte array. This is equivalent to shifting bits to the right as you did in C.\n- If you need little-endian order (least significant byte first), you can use `byteorder='little'`.\n\nThis will give you a byte representation of the integer similar to what you would achieve with bitwise operations in C. The `list(byte_array)` will output the list of byte values, which is similar to the array of `uint8_t` values you would have in C."
