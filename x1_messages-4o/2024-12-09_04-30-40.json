These blank pages occur between the title page and the TOC, the TOC and the introduction, and so on. I've tried two solutions suggested by a user, but neither worked for me. The first solution:\n\n```python\nlatex_elements = {\n'classoptions': ',oneside',\n}\n```\nresulted in a `! Package babel Error: You haven't specified a language option.` error. And the second solution:\n\n```python\nlatex_font_size = '10pt,oneside'\n```\nran successfully, but it produced a PDF that only contained the odd-numbered pages of my document. Can anyone suggest a way to generate a PDF without these blank pages?"

        "content": "To address the issue of blank pages in the PDF generated by Sphinx documentation, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. **Check Language Settings**: Ensure that you have specified a language in your `conf.py` file under the `latex_elements` dictionary. If not, add a language option to avoid the babel error. For example, if your documentation is in English, you can add:\n\n    ```python\n    latex_elements = {\n        'classoptions': ',oneside',\n        'babel': '\\\\usepackage[english]{babel}',\n    }\n    ```\n\n2. **Adjust the Document Class Options**: You can specify the document class options more explicitly to ensure that the document is generated as a single-sided document. Update your `latex_elements` as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    latex_elements = {\n        'papersize': 'a4paper',\n        'pointsize': '10pt',\n        'classoptions': ',oneside',\n        'babel': '\\\\usepackage[english]{babel}',\n        'extraclassoptions': 'openany',  # This option helps to suppress blank pages\n    }\n    ```\n\n3. **Modify the LaTeX Preamble**: If the above doesn't work, you can also try adding custom LaTeX commands to further control page breaks. In the `latex_elements` dictionary, you can add a `preamble` key:\n\n    ```python\n    latex_elements = {\n        'preamble': r'''\n            \\usepackage{etoolbox}\n            \\patchcmd{\\chapter}{\\thispagestyle{plain}}{\\thispagestyle{empty}}{}{}\n            \\let\\cleardoublepage\\clearpage\n        ''',\n        'classoptions': ',oneside',\n        'babel': '\\\\usepackage[english]{babel}',\n    }\n    ```\n\n   This preamble modification uses the `etoolbox` package to patch the chapter command and replaces `\\cleardoublepage` with `\\clearpage`, helping to eliminate unwanted blank pages.\n\n4. **Rebuild the PDF**: After applying these changes, rebuild your documentation using the `make latexpdf` command to see if the blank pages are removed.\n\nThese steps should help in generating a PDF without the unwanted blank pages. If you encounter further issues, ensure your Sphinx version and LaTeX setup are up-to-date and compatible with these configurations."
