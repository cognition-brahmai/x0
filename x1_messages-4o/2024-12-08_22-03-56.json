Here's a breakdown of the command:\n\n1. **Expression**: `(12-8)/8` calculates the fractional increase in revenue, which is `(current - previous) / previous`.\n2. **Multiplication by 100**: `((12-8)/8)*100` converts the fractional increase to a percentage.\n3. **`scale=2`**: This sets the precision to two decimal places for the result.\n\nThe command you provided is:\n\n```shell\necho \"scale=2; ((12-8)/8)*100\" | bc\n```\n\n**Output**:\nThe output of this command will be `50.00`, which means there is a 50% increase in revenue from the previous quarter to the current quarter."
