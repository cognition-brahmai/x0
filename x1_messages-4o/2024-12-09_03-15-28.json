One of the requirements I have is that each subclass needs to have some specific static class variables. What is the best way to enforce that these variables are present? Should I throw an exception if they are absent when I want to use them, or is there a more efficient way? Here's an example of what I'm working with:\n\n```\nclass Bar(Foo):\n  page_name = 'New Page'\n```\n\nThe 'page_name' variable has to be present for it to be processed in the following manner:\n\n```\npage_names = process_pages(list_of_pages)\n\ndef process_pages(list_of_pages):\n  page_names = []\n\n  for page in list_of_pages:\n    page_names.append(page.page_name)\n\n  return page_names\n```"

        "content": "To ensure that each subclass has specific static class variables like `page_name`, you can use a combination of metaclasses and abstract base classes (ABCs) in Python. This approach allows you to enforce that subclasses have these variables at class definition time, rather than waiting until runtime to throw an exception.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n1. **Define a Metaclass**: This will check for the presence of the required class variables when a class is created.\n\n2. **Use an Abstract Base Class**: This will help in defining the contract for subclasses, indicating that they must include certain static variables.\n\nHere is a code example of how you could implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod\n\nclass BaseMeta(ABCMeta):\n    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, class_dict):\n        cls = super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, class_dict)\n        required_attributes = ['page_name']\n        \n        for attr in required_attributes:\n            if not hasattr(cls, attr):\n                raise TypeError(f\"Class {name} is missing required static attribute: {attr}\")\n        \n        return cls\n\nclass Foo(metaclass=BaseMeta):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def some_method(self):\n        pass\n\n# Example subclass with the required attribute\nclass Bar(Foo):\n    page_name = 'New Page'\n    \n    def some_method(self):\n        pass\n\n# Example subclass without the required attribute\nclass Baz(Foo):\n    # This will raise an error because `page_name` is missing\n    def some_method(self):\n        pass\n\n# Your processing function\ndef process_pages(list_of_pages):\n    page_names = []\n\n    for page in list_of_pages:\n        page_names.append(page.page_name)\n\n    return page_names\n\n# Example usage\nlist_of_pages = [Bar()]  # This should work fine\npage_names = process_pages(list_of_pages)\nprint(page_names)\n\n# Uncommenting the following line will raise a TypeError\n# list_of_pages = [Baz()]  # This will raise a TypeError when Baz is defined\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **BaseMeta**: A metaclass is defined that checks if the required static class variables (`page_name` in this case) are present in the subclass. If any required attribute is missing, it raises a `TypeError`.\n\n- **Foo**: An abstract base class that uses `BaseMeta` as its metaclass. This class can also define abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.\n\n- **Bar**: A subclass of `Foo` that correctly defines the required `page_name` attribute.\n\n- **Baz**: Another subclass of `Foo` that does not define `page_name`, and thus raises a `TypeError` when the class is created.\n\nThis approach ensures that the presence of `page_name` is checked at class creation time, rather than waiting until you try to access the attribute."
