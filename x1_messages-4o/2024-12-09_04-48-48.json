I cloned a github repository using `!git clone https://github.com/llSourcell/Pokemon_GAN.git` and I wanted to modify a .py file within this repository. I've attempted to use `%load filename.py` as suggested in another Stack Overflow post, but each time I run this command, I get disconnected. Is there another way to modify a .py file without the trouble of downloading it to my computer, editing it, and then re-uploading it?"

        "content": "Editing and saving `.py` files directly in Google Colab can be accomplished in a few straightforward steps. Since you've cloned a repository, you'll have access to all of its files within the Colab environment. Here's how you can edit and save `.py` files:\n\n1. **Navigate to the File:**\n   - Use the file explorer on the left side of the Colab interface to navigate to the cloned repository. Click on the folder icon to open the file explorer.\n\n2. **Edit the File in the Text Editor:**\n   - Double-click the `.py` file you want to edit. This will open the file in a text editor within the Colab interface, and you can directly make changes to the code.\n\n3. **Save the Changes:**\n   - After making your edits, simply save the file by clicking `File` > `Save` from the Colab menu, or by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + S` (Cmd + S on Mac).\n\n4. **Alternative Method - Using Code Cells:**\n   - If you prefer to make changes using code cells, you can use the following approach:\n     - Use the `%%writefile` magic command to write to a file. This is particularly useful if you want to programmatically make changes or create a new file.\n     ```python\n     %%writefile path/to/your_script.py\n     # Your modified or new code here\n     ```\n\n5. **Run the Updated Script:**\n   - Once you've saved your changes, you can run the script as usual using the `!python path/to/your_script.py` command in a Colab cell.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to edit and save `.py` files directly in Google Colab without any need to download and re-upload them. If you encounter any issues with disconnections, try refreshing the Colab page or clearing the runtime."
