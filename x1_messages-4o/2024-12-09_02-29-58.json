The documentation says `os.getuid()` returns the current process\u2019s user id, and `os.geteuid()` returns the current process\u2019s effective user id. However, both seem to work the same for me, whether I'm using Python 2.x or 3.x. I am using it to check if the script is being run as root. Can you explain the distinction between user id and effective user id?"

        "content": "The distinction between the real user ID (`os.getuid()`) and the effective user ID (`os.geteuid()`) is important in Unix-like operating systems for understanding access control and permissions.\n\n1. **Real User ID (`os.getuid()`)**:\n   - This represents the user ID of the user who originally started the process. It identifies the actual owner of the process and is used primarily for accounting purposes.\n   - The real user ID is usually the same as the effective user ID, except in cases where a program or script is running with elevated privileges, such as when using the `setuid` mechanism.\n\n2. **Effective User ID (`os.geteuid()`)**:\n   - The effective user ID determines the access permissions for the process. It is used by the operating system to decide what resources the process can access. \n   - In scenarios where a program has the setuid bit set, the effective UID can be different from the real UID. For example, a program owned by root with the setuid bit set will have an effective UID of root when executed by a non-root user, allowing the program to perform tasks with root privileges.\n\nIn your case, where both `os.getuid()` and `os.geteuid()` return the same value, it likely means that you are not running a setuid program, and your script is not being executed with elevated privileges. This is typical for most scripts unless specifically configured otherwise.\n\nIf you're checking if a script is being run as root, you can still use either method in most common scenarios. However, be aware that if you deal with setuid programs in the future, this distinction becomes crucial. To check if your script is running as root, you can use:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nif os.geteuid() == 0:\n    print(\"Running as root!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Not running as root.\")\n```\n\nThis checks the effective user ID, which is what determines the permissions and access rights of the process."
