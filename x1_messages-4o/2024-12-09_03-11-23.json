I usually use a string tokenized with shlex.split as 'argv' argument for Popen, as shown in the following example: \n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nimport shlex\nprint subprocess.Popen(shlex.split(r'ls -l'), stdin = subprocess.PIPE, stdout = subprocess.PIPE, stderr = subprocess.PIPE).communicate()[0]\n```\n\nHowever, when I try to use pipes (as in the following example), it doesn't seem to work and returns nothing:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nimport shlex\nprint subprocess.Popen(shlex.split(r'ls -l | sed \"s/a/b/g\"'), stdin = subprocess.PIPE, stdout = subprocess.PIPE, stderr = subprocess.PIPE).communicate()[0]\n```\n\nCan you help me understand what I am doing wrong?"

        "content": "When using `subprocess.Popen` in Python to execute shell commands that include pipes, you need to create a pipeline by chaining multiple `Popen` calls manually. The `|` symbol is a shell feature and doesn't work directly with `Popen` unless you use the `shell=True` argument, which is generally not recommended due to security concerns and the potential for shell injection vulnerabilities.\n\nHere's how you can manually create a pipeline by chaining `Popen` calls:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nimport shlex\n\n# First command\np1 = subprocess.Popen(shlex.split('ls -l'), stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\n\n# Second command, taking the output of the first command as its input\np2 = subprocess.Popen(shlex.split('sed \"s/a/b/g\"'), stdin=p1.stdout, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\n\n# Close the stdout of p1 to allow p1 to receive a SIGPIPE if p2 exits\np1.stdout.close()\n\n# Get the final output\noutput, error = p2.communicate()\n\n# Print the output\nprint(output.decode('utf-8'))\n```\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the above code:\n\n1. The first command, `ls -l`, is executed and its output is directed to `p1.stdout`.\n2. The second command, `sed \"s/a/b/g\"`, takes its input from `p1.stdout`.\n3. The `p1.stdout.close()` is called to allow `p1` to terminate gracefully.\n4. `p2.communicate()` is used to read the output of the second command and wait for it to finish.\n\nThis way, you can chain as many commands as you like by continuing to pass the `stdout` of one process to the `stdin` of the next."
