        "content": "The phrase \"Salut tout le monde!\" translates to \"Hello everyone!\" in English.\n\n### Etymology and Meanings of \"Salut\"\n\n- **Etymology**: The word \"salut\" originates from the Latin word \"salus,\" meaning health or well-being. In Old French, it evolved into \"salut,\" retaining a similar meaning.\n\n- **Meanings in Different Contexts**:\n  - Informal greeting: \"Salut\" is commonly used in French as an informal way to say \"hi\" or \"hello.\" It is typically used among friends or people of the same age group.\n  - Farewell: \"Salut\" can also be used to say \"bye\" when parting ways.\n  - In other contexts, \"salut\" can refer to a salute or a gesture of respect.\n\n### Comparison with Other French Greetings\n\n- **Bonjour**: This is a more formal greeting than \"salut\" and is equivalent to \"good morning\" or \"good day\" in English. It is suitable for use in both formal and informal settings.\n\n- **Coucou**: This is an even more informal greeting than \"salut,\" often used to grab someone's attention in a friendly and playful manner, similar to saying \"hey\" or \"hi there\" in English.\n\n### Python Code Snippet Using Google Translate API\n\nTo perform the translation using the Google Translate API, you can use the `googletrans` library. Note that the following snippet assumes you have installed the library using `pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1`.\n\n```python\nfrom googletrans import Translator\n\n# Initialize the translator\ntranslator = Translator()\n\n# Phrase to translate\nphrase = \"Salut tout le monde!\"\n\n# Perform the translation\ntranslated = translator.translate(phrase, src='fr', dest='en')\n\n# Output the translation in plain text\nprint(\"Translated Text:\", translated.text)\n\n# Output the translation in LaTeX format\nlatex_translation = r\"\\text{\" + translated.text.replace('_', '\\_') + r\"}\"\nprint(\"LaTeX Format:\", latex_translation)\n```\n\n### Output\n\nWhen you run this code, it will display the translated text as well as the translation formatted for LaTeX:\n\n```\nTranslated Text: Hello everyone!\nLaTeX Format: \\text{Hello everyone!}\n```\n\nEnsure that you have internet access and the necessary library installed to execute the code snippet successfully."
