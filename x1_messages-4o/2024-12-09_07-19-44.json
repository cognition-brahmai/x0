Here's the code that I've been using:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ny = np.array([2,1,5,2])          # y axis\nx = np.array([1,2,3,4])          # x axis\nm = np.ma.masked_where(y>2, y)   # filter out values larger than 2\n\nprint(m)\n# Output: [2 1 -- 2]\nprint(np.ma.compressed(m))\n# Output: [2 1 2]\n```\nI then attempt to apply the mask to the x array using this code:\n```python\nnew_x = x[m.mask].copy()\nprint(new_x)\n# Output: array([5])\n```\nThis doesn't give me the desired result. I've found a workaround, but it's a bit messy:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nx = np.array([1,2,3,4])\ny = np.array([2,1,5,2])\nm = np.ma.masked_where(y>2, y)\nnew_x = np.ma.masked_array(x, m.mask)\nprint(np.ma.compressed(new_x))\n# Output: [1 2 4]\n```\nIs there a more elegant solution?"

        "content": "Certainly! Your approach using `np.ma.masked_array` is on the right track, but we can make it a bit more concise. The key is to apply the mask from `y` directly to `x` using `np.ma.masked_where` or `np.ma.masked_array` as you've done. Here\u2019s a cleaner way to achieve the desired result:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the arrays\ny = np.array([2, 1, 5, 2])\nx = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\n\n# Create a mask where values in y are greater than 2\nmask = y > 2\n\n# Apply the mask to x using np.ma.masked_array\nmasked_x = np.ma.masked_array(x, mask)\n\n# Extract the unmasked elements\nresult = masked_x.compressed()\n\nprint(result)\n# Output: [1 2 4]\n```\n\nIn this version, the mask is created based directly on the condition `y > 2`, and this mask is then applied to `x` using `np.ma.masked_array`. Finally, `compressed()` is used to extract the values from `x` that correspond to the unmasked elements in `y`. This approach is concise and efficiently applies the mask from `y` to `x`."
