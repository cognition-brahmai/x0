I have tried the following methods to start chromedriver:\n```python\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome('/usr/local/bin/chromedriver')\n```\nand\n```python\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='/usr/local/bin/chromedriver')\n```\nand\n```python\nimport os\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\nchromedriver = \"/usr/local/bin/chromedriver\"\nos.environ[\"webdriver.chrome.driver\"] = chromedriver\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome(chromedriver)\ndriver.get(\"http://stackoverflow.com\")\n```\nHowever, these methods do not seem to work and I'm getting the error: `selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: 'ChromeDriver executable needs to be available in the path.` I have checked multiple times and the `chromedriver` is present in the location `/usr/local/bin`. My google-chrome location is `/usr/bin/google-chrome`. Could anyone help me figure out why my scripts are not working?"

        "content": "It looks like there might be a few issues causing the `WebDriverException` error you're encountering. Let's go through a checklist to ensure everything is set up properly:\n\n1. **Chromedriver Path**: Ensure that the Chromedriver executable has the correct permissions. Execute the following command to make it executable:\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/chromedriver\n   ```\n\n2. **PATH Environment Variable**: The Chromedriver executable needs to be in your system's PATH. You can add it by modifying your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file. Add the following line at the end of the file:\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin\n   ```\n   Then, run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.bash_profile` to apply the changes.\n\n3. **Chromedriver Version**: Make sure that the version of Chromedriver matches the version of Google Chrome installed on your system. You can check the version of Chrome by running:\n   ```bash\n   google-chrome --version\n   ```\n   and the version of Chromedriver by running:\n   ```bash\n   /usr/local/bin/chromedriver --version\n   ```\n   If there's a mismatch, download the appropriate version of Chromedriver from the [official site](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/).\n\n4. **Selenium Version**: Ensure you have the latest version of Selenium installed. You can update it using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade selenium\n   ```\n\n5. **Specifying the Path Correctly**: When initializing the `webdriver.Chrome()`, you can specify options instead of the executable path if the PATH is set correctly. Here's a simplified version:\n   ```python\n   from selenium import webdriver\n   from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service\n\n   service = Service('/usr/local/bin/chromedriver')\n   driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service)\n   driver.get(\"http://stackoverflow.com\")\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue. If the problem persists, please check for any additional error messages that might provide more insight into what's going wrong."
