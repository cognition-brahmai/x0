        "content": "I am studying Convolutional Neural Networks and have come across a concept that I am finding difficult to understand. In a research paper, the authors mentioned that they use small 3x3 receptive fields throughout the whole network rather than using larger receptive fields in the early convolutional layers. They go on to state that a stack of two 3x3 convolutional layers (without any spatial pooling in between) has an effective receptive field of 5x5, and three such layers have a 7x7 effective receptive field. However, I am struggling to understand how they end up with a receptive field of 7x7. As per my understanding, if we take an image of 100x100, the first layer would zero-pad the image and convolve it with a 3x3 filter, outputting another 100x100 filtered image. The second layer would do the same with the output of the first layer and the third layer would repeat the process with the output of the second layer. Can someone explain to me what I am missing in my understanding?"

        "content": "Certainly! The concept of effective receptive field in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can indeed be a bit tricky at first, but let's break it down.\n\n1. **Receptive Field Basics**: The receptive field of a neuron in a CNN refers to the specific region of the input image that influences that neuron's output. As you stack more convolutional layers, each neuron's receptive field in the deeper layers corresponds to a larger area in the original input image.\n\n2. **3x3 Convolutional Layers**: When you use a 3x3 convolutional filter, each output pixel is influenced directly by a 3x3 region of the input. This is the immediate receptive field of that layer.\n\n3. **Stacking Convolutional Layers**: When you stack multiple convolutional layers, the receptive field grows. Here's how:\n   - **First Layer**: A 3x3 filter directly covers a 3x3 area of the input.\n   - **Second Layer**: Another 3x3 filter on top of the first layer's output means that each pixel in the second layer's output is influenced by a 5x5 area of the original input. This is because each of the 3x3 areas from the first layer overlaps with others, effectively expanding the receptive field.\n   - **Third Layer**: A third 3x3 filter expands the receptive field further to a 7x7 area on the original input. This happens because each pixel in the third layer's output is influenced by a 3x3 area from the second layer, which itself is influenced by a 5x5 area from the first layer.\n\n4. **Visualization of Growth**:\n   - **Layer 1**: 3x3\n   - **Layer 2**: 5x5 (since each 3x3 area from Layer 1 overlaps and contributes to a larger area)\n   - **Layer 3**: 7x7 (each 3x3 from Layer 2 translates to a larger 7x7 area on the original input)\n\n5. **Padding and Stride**: Assuming you are using padding (commonly done to maintain the input size) and a stride of 1, the output size remains the same, but the receptive field grows with each layer.\n\nSo, in essence, each additional 3x3 layer adds an extra layer of influence, extending the effective receptive field by 2 in each direction. This growth is what allows a stack of 3x3 convolutions to achieve the same effective receptive field size as a single larger convolution, such as 5x5 or 7x7, but with fewer parameters and potentially better learning characteristics due to the increased depth and non-linearities."
