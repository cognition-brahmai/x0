Specifically, I'm trying to decode a URL like \"example.com?title=%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F+%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%89%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0\" into \"example.com?title=\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f+\u0437\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u0430\" in Python 2.7. I've tried using the following code: \"url=urllib.unquote(url.encode(\"utf8\"))\", but it's returning something that doesn't look right. Can someone please help me solve this issue?"

        "content": "To decode a URL in Python 2.7, you can use the `urllib` module. The `unquote` function is designed to decode percent-encoded characters in URLs. However, when dealing with non-ASCII characters, you may need an additional step to properly handle the encoding.\n\nHere's how you can decode the given URL:\n\n```python\nimport urllib\n\nurl = \"example.com?title=%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F+%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%89%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0\"\ndecoded_url = urllib.unquote(url)\n\n# Decode from UTF-8 to Unicode\ndecoded_url_utf8 = decoded_url.decode('utf8')\n\nprint(decoded_url_utf8)\n```\n\nExplanation of the code:\n\n1. **`urllib.unquote(url)`**: This function decodes the percent-encoded string, converting `%D0%BF` and similar sequences back to their byte representations.\n\n2. **`.decode('utf8')`**: Since the decoded result might still be in byte format, especially for non-ASCII characters, you need to decode it from UTF-8 to Unicode to properly display the characters.\n\nWhen you run this code, it should correctly output the URL with the decoded Cyrillic characters: `\"example.com?title=\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f+\u0437\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u0430\"`. Make sure your terminal or console supports Unicode to see the characters properly."
