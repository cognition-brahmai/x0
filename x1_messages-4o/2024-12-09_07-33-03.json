In Python, parentheses are used for function calls, while square brackets are used for indexing arrays and lists. \n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\narr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])\n\nprint(arr[0, 0])\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, `arr[0, 0]` is used to access the element in the first row and first column of the array, which is `1`. Make sure to use square brackets for indexing arrays in numpy."
