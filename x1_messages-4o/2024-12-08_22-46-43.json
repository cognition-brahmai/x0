        "content": "To solve a system of equations using LaTeX and PHP, we'll first need to represent the equations in LaTeX and then use PHP to solve them. For simplicity, let's assume we have a system of linear equations based on the three variables: price (\\(x_1\\)), advertising cost (\\(x_2\\)), and time of year (\\(x_3\\)) to predict sales (\\(y\\)).\n\n### LaTeX Code\n\nBelow is a sample LaTeX representation of the system of equations:\n\n```latex\n\\begin{align*}\na_1x_1 + b_1x_2 + c_1x_3 &= y_1 \\\\\na_2x_1 + b_2x_2 + c_2x_3 &= y_2 \\\\\na_3x_1 + b_3x_2 + c_3x_3 &= y_3 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n```\n\nThis represents three equations with coefficients \\(a, b, c\\) and the sales \\(y\\) associated with each equation.\n\n### PHP Code\n\nTo solve this system of equations, you can use PHP's capabilities to perform matrix operations or use a library that supports linear algebra. Here, I'll provide a simple PHP example using basic operations to solve a system of three equations.\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nfunction solveEquations($coefficients, $constants) {\n    // Assuming $coefficients is a 3x3 matrix and $constants is a 3x1 matrix\n    $a = $coefficients[0];\n    $b = $coefficients[1];\n    $c = $coefficients[2];\n\n    $d = $constants[0];\n    $e = $constants[1];\n    $f = $constants[2];\n\n    // Calculate the determinants\n    $D = ($a[0] * ($b[1] * $c[2] - $b[2] * $c[1])) - ($a[1] * ($b[0] * $c[2] - $b[2] * $c[0])) + ($a[2] * ($b[0] * $c[1] - $b[1] * $c[0]));\n\n    $Dx = ($d * ($b[1] * $c[2] - $b[2] * $c[1])) - ($a[1] * ($e * $c[2] - $f * $c[1])) + ($a[2] * ($e * $c[1] - $f * $b[1]));\n    $Dy = ($a[0] * ($e * $c[2] - $f * $c[1])) - ($d * ($b[0] * $c[2] - $f * $c[0])) + ($a[2] * ($b[0] * $f - $e * $c[0]));\n    $Dz = ($a[0] * ($b[1] * $f - $b[2] * $e)) - ($a[1] * ($b[0] * $f - $e * $c[0])) + ($d * ($b[0] * $c[1] - $b[1] * $c[0]));\n\n    // Calculate the variables\n    $x1 = $Dx / $D;\n    $x2 = $Dy / $D;\n    $x3 = $Dz / $D;\n\n    return [$x1, $x2, $x3];\n}\n\n// Example coefficients and constants\n$coefficients = [\n    [1, 2, 3],\n    [4, 5, 6],\n    [7, 8, 10]\n];\n\n$constants = [6, 15, 25];\n\n$result = solveEquations($coefficients, $constants);\n\necho \"Price: {$result[0]}, Advertising Cost: {$result[1]}, Time of Year: {$result[2]}\";\n?>\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **LaTeX Code**: The system of equations is expressed in LaTeX format, showing how each variable and its coefficients relate to the sales.\n\n2. **PHP Code**: This PHP script defines a function `solveEquations` to solve a system of linear equations using determinants (Cramer's rule). The example provides a set of coefficients and constants, and the function returns the solutions for the variables.\n\nThis example assumes the system of equations can be solved using Cramer's rule, which requires that the determinant \\(D\\) is non-zero. Adjust the coefficients and constants as per your specific data to use this in a real-case scenario."
