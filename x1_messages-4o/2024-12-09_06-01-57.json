        "content": "To focus on a specific region of the x-axis, you can use the `plt.xlim()` function to set the limits of the x-axis to the desired range. In your case, you want to focus on the region from 1.3 to 4 on the x-axis. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport pyfits\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n\n# Assuming I have my data in the current directory\na = pyfits.getdata('fits1.fits')\nx = a['data1']  # Lets assume data1 is the column: [0, 1, 1.3, 1.5, 2, 4, 8]\ny = a['data2']  # And data2 is the column: [0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3]\n\n# Plot the data\nplt.plot(x, y)\n\n# Set the x-axis limits to focus on the region from 1.3 to 4\nplt.xlim(1.3, 4)\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis sets the x-axis to only display the range between 1.3 and 4, allowing you to focus on that specific region of your data. You can also use `plt.ylim()` if you need to adjust the y-axis as well."
