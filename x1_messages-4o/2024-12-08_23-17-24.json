Here's a concept for a graphic t-shirt design featuring the pun \"Tuckered Out\":\n\n**Front Design:**\n\n- **Background**: A soft, pastel-colored background, perhaps a light blue or green, to give a relaxed and calming vibe.\n  \n- **Central Image**: An adorable cartoon turtle, lounging on its back with a content smile, wearing a tiny nightcap. The turtle should have its legs tucked in slightly, emphasizing the \"tucked\" theme.\n\n- **Text**: Above the turtle, in bold, playful letters, the text \"Tuckered Out\" is written. The font could be rounded and bubbly to match the light-hearted theme. Consider using a gradient effect or a subtle shadow to make the text pop against the background.\n\n- **Additional Elements**: Add a few Zzz's floating above the turtle to indicate it's sleeping, and maybe a small moon or some stars around to enhance the sleepy theme.\n\n**Back Design (Optional):**\n\n- You could add a small, simple illustration of a turtle shell with the text \"Ready to Chill\" just below the neckline.\n\nThis design combines humor and a cute visual that many people can relate to, making it a fun addition to any casual wardrobe!"
