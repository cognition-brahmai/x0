        "content": "The three main ingredients for making a classic Italian spaghetti sauce, often referred to as marinara sauce, are:\n\n1. **Tomatoes**: Fresh ripe tomatoes or good quality canned tomatoes (like San Marzano) are used as the base of the sauce.\n\n2. **Garlic**: Adds a robust and aromatic flavor to the sauce.\n\n3. **Olive Oil**: Used to saut\u00e9 the garlic and sometimes onions, providing a rich and smooth texture.\n\nThese ingredients form the foundation, and you can enhance the sauce with additional ingredients like onions, basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar to balance the acidity of the tomatoes."
