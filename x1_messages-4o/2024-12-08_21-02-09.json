        "content": "Creating an app to promote physical activity among teens using Swift can be an engaging project. To achieve this, you can leverage the Core Motion framework in iOS to track steps and set daily goals. Below is a basic outline and sample code to help you get started.\n\n### Steps to Create the App:\n\n1. **Set Up Your Project:**\n   - Open Xcode and create a new iOS project.\n   - Choose \"App\" under iOS and click \"Next.\"\n   - Enter your project details and ensure you select \"Swift\" as the language.\n\n2. **Enable HealthKit:**\n   - Go to the project settings, select your app target, and navigate to the \"Signing & Capabilities\" tab.\n   - Add \"HealthKit\" to the capabilities.\n\n3. **Import Core Motion and HealthKit:**\n   - Import these frameworks in your ViewController.\n\n4. **Request Permission:**\n   - Request authorization to access step count data.\n\n5. **Track Steps:**\n   - Use `CMPedometer` to track steps in real-time.\n\n6. **Set Daily Goals:**\n   - Store and compare the step count against user-defined goals.\n\nHere's some sample code to get you started:\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\nimport CoreMotion\nimport HealthKit\n\nclass ViewController: UIViewController {\n    private let pedometer = CMPedometer()\n    private let healthStore = HKHealthStore()\n    \n    @IBOutlet weak var stepsLabel: UILabel!\n    @IBOutlet weak var goalLabel: UILabel!\n    \n    var dailyStepGoal: Int = 10000 // Example goal\n\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        requestAuthorization()\n        startTrackingSteps()\n    }\n\n    func requestAuthorization() {\n        let stepType = HKObjectType.quantityType(forIdentifier: .stepCount)!\n        \n        healthStore.requestAuthorization(toShare: [], read: [stepType]) { (success, error) in\n            if !success {\n                print(\"Authorization failed\")\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    func startTrackingSteps() {\n        guard CMPedometer.isStepCountingAvailable() else {\n            stepsLabel.text = \"Step counting is not available\"\n            return\n        }\n\n        pedometer.startUpdates(from: Date()) { [weak self] data, error in\n            guard let self = self else { return }\n            guard error == nil else {\n                print(\"Error: \\(String(describing: error))\")\n                return\n            }\n\n            DispatchQueue.main.async {\n                if let numberOfSteps = data?.numberOfSteps {\n                    self.stepsLabel.text = \"Steps: \\(numberOfSteps)\"\n                    self.updateGoalStatus(currentSteps: numberOfSteps.intValue)\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    func updateGoalStatus(currentSteps: Int) {\n        if currentSteps >= dailyStepGoal {\n            goalLabel.text = \"Goal Achieved! \ud83c\udf89\"\n        } else {\n            goalLabel.text = \"Keep Going! \\(dailyStepGoal - currentSteps) steps to go.\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **CMPedometer**: Used to retrieve live pedometer data such as steps.\n- **HealthKit**: Used to request permissions and access step data.\n- **Authorization**: Make sure you handle user permissions appropriately.\n- **UI Elements**: Create labels or other UI elements in your storyboard to display steps and goal status.\n\n### Extending Functionality:\n\n- Add user inputs to set personal daily goals.\n- Implement notifications to remind users to stay active.\n- Use charts to visualize step data over time.\n\nThis is a basic implementation to get you started on motivating teens to be more active. You can enhance the app further with additional features and a more interactive user interface."
