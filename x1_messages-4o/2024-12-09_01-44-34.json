Here's how you can complete your code:\n\n```python\nfor k, v in mydict.items():\n    if v is None:\n        mydict[k] = \"\"  # Replace None with an empty string\n```\n\nThis loop iterates through each key-value pair in the dictionary `mydict`. When it finds a value that is `None`, it replaces that value with an empty string `\"\"`. After running this loop, all occurrences of `None` in your dictionary will be replaced with an empty string."
