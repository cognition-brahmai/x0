        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to missing SSL libraries, which are required for building the `psycopg2` package. This is a common issue on macOS, especially after system updates. Here's how you can resolve it:\n\n1. **Install OpenSSL via Homebrew**:\n   If you haven't already, install Homebrew, which is a package manager for macOS. You can install Homebrew by running the following command in your terminal:\n   ```bash\n   /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n   ```\n\n   Once Homebrew is installed, use it to install OpenSSL:\n   ```bash\n   brew install openssl\n   ```\n\n2. **Set Environment Variables**:\n   You need to specify the path to the OpenSSL libraries so that the `psycopg2` installation knows where to find them. You can do this by setting the `LDFLAGS` and `CPPFLAGS` environment variables before running the pip install command:\n   ```bash\n   export LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib\"\n   export CPPFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Install psycopg2-binary**:\n   An alternative and often simpler solution is to install `psycopg2-binary`, which is a pre-compiled package that doesn't require building from source:\n   ```bash\n   pip install psycopg2-binary\n   ```\n\n4. **Retry Installing psycopg2**:\n   If you still prefer to use the standard `psycopg2` package, you can retry the installation after setting the environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   pip install psycopg2\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the linker error and successfully install the `psycopg2` package on your macOS system."
