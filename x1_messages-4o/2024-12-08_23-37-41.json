To compute the value of the polynomial expression \\(3x^2 + 6x - 5\\) when \\(x\\) is substituted with 2.5, you can use the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the value of x\nx = 2.5\n\n# Calculate the value of the polynomial expression\nresult = 3 * x**2 + 6 * x - 5\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The value of the polynomial expression is:\", result)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will compute the value of the polynomial for \\(x = 2.5\\) and output the result."
