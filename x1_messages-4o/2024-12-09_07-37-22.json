I have a large dataset in memory, in the form of numpy arrays and dictionaries, that I want to store into files for quick loading later on. While the np.save and np.load functions work well for numpy arrays, I am having trouble with dictionary objects. For instance, I have attempted to save and load a dictionary with the following code:\n\n```python\nd1={'key1':[5,10], 'key2':[50,100]}\nnp.save(\"d1.npy\", d1)\nd2=np.load(\"d1.npy\")\n```\n\nAfter loading, it appears that the dictionary has been converted into a numpy array (as shown by the output of `d2`), and further dictionary operations like `get` are not working. Here is the error I encounter:\n\n```python\nd2.get('key2')\n```\n\nError:\n```python\nAttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'get'\n```\n\nIs there a way to load the data from the file as a dict instead of a numpy array?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that `np.save` and `np.load` are designed primarily for saving and loading numpy arrays, not Python dictionaries. When you attempt to save a dictionary using `np.save`, it treats the dictionary as a generic object and does not preserve it as a dictionary during the loading process.\n\nTo save and load dictionaries while maintaining their structure, you can use the `numpy` `np.savez` and `np.load` functions with the `allow_pickle=True` option, or better yet, use the `pickle` module which is specifically designed for serializing and deserializing Python objects.\n\nHere's how you can save and load dictionaries using `pickle`:\n\n### Using `pickle`\n\n```python\nimport pickle\n\n# Saving the dictionary\nd1 = {'key1': [5, 10], 'key2': [50, 100]}\nwith open('d1.pkl', 'wb') as f:\n    pickle.dump(d1, f)\n\n# Loading the dictionary\nwith open('d1.pkl', 'rb') as f:\n    d2 = pickle.load(f)\n\n# Now you can use dictionary methods\nvalue = d2.get('key2')\nprint(value) # Output: [50, 100]\n```\n\n### Using `np.savez` with `allow_pickle=True`\n\nIf you prefer to stick with numpy, you can save the dictionary as a single object in a `.npz` file:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Saving the dictionary using numpy's savez\nd1 = {'key1': [5, 10], 'key2': [50, 100]}\nnp.savez('d1.npz', data=d1)\n\n# Loading the dictionary\nloaded = np.load('d1.npz', allow_pickle=True)\nd2 = loaded['data'].item()\n\n# Now you can use dictionary methods\nvalue = d2.get('key2')\nprint(value) # Output: [50, 100]\n```\n\nIn this case, `np.savez` saves the dictionary as a single object and `allow_pickle=True` ensures that the dictionary is loaded properly with its original structure. Remember to call `.item()` on the loaded object to convert it back to a dictionary."
