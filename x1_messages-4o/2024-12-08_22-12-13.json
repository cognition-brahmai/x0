        "content": "The sequence you provided is a geometric sequence. In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. In this sequence, the common ratio is 2, because each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2.\n\nTo find the sum of the first 10 terms of this geometric sequence, we use the formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) terms of a geometric sequence:\n\n\\[ S_n = a \\frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( a \\) is the first term of the sequence,\n- \\( r \\) is the common ratio,\n- \\( n \\) is the number of terms to sum.\n\nFor this sequence:\n- \\( a = 1 \\),\n- \\( r = 2 \\),\n- \\( n = 10 \\).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ S_{10} = 1 \\frac{2^{10} - 1}{2 - 1} = 1 \\times (1024 - 1) = 1023 \\]\n\nSo, the sum of the first 10 terms is 1023.\n\nTo determine the nth term of the sequence where n is a prime number greater than 20, we use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence:\n\n\\[ a_n = a \\cdot r^{n-1} \\]\n\nLet's consider the smallest prime number greater than 20, which is 23.\n\n\\[ a_{23} = 1 \\cdot 2^{23-1} = 2^{22} \\]\n\nCalculating \\( 2^{22} \\):\n\n\\[ 2^{22} = 4,194,304 \\]\n\nTherefore, the 23rd term of the sequence is 4,194,304."
