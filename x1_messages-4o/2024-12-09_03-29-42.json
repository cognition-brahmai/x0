        "content": "In Python, there isn't a direct equivalent of the JavaScript `>>>` operator, which is a logical (unsigned) right shift. The `>>` operator in Python is an arithmetic (signed) right shift, similar to JavaScript's `>>`, which means it preserves the sign bit for negative numbers.\n\nTo achieve a logical right shift in Python, especially for negative numbers, you can manually handle the conversion to an unsigned integer. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\ndef logical_right_shift(value, shift):\n    if value >= 0:\n        return value >> shift\n    else:\n        # Find the number of bits in the integer\n        num_bits = value.bit_length()\n        # Add the leading bits that represent the two's complement negative number\n        value += 1 << num_bits\n        # Perform the logical right shift\n        return value >> shift\n\n# Examples\nprint(logical_right_shift(-1000, 3))  # Output: 536870787\nprint(logical_right_shift(-1000 >> 3, 0))  # Output: -125\nprint(logical_right_shift(1000, 3))   # Output: 125\nprint(logical_right_shift(1000 >> 3, 0))   # Output: 125\n```\n\n### How It Works:\n1. For positive numbers, the behavior remains the same as the arithmetic shift (`>>`).\n2. For negative numbers, first calculate the number of bits required to represent the number in binary.\n3. Adjust the negative number to its unsigned equivalent by adding `1 << num_bits` (which effectively adds enough to make it positive).\n4. Perform the normal right shift on the adjusted value.\n\nThis approach mimics the logical right shift behavior as seen in JavaScript's `>>>` operator."
