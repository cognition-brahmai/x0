I'm attempting to make the list available via %s in the SQL statement as shown in the following code:\n\n```python\n# using psycopg2\ncountryList=['UK','France']\n\nsql='SELECT * from countries WHERE country IN (%s)'\ndata=[countryList]\ncur.execute(sql,data)\n```\n\nHowever, I'm encountering an error after running \"WHERE country in (ARRAY[...])\". Is there a way to achieve this without resorting to string manipulation?"

        "content": "Certainly! When using `psycopg2` with PostgreSQL, you can pass a list to a `WHERE IN` clause by using the `ANY` function with an array. Here's how you can modify your query to properly use the list of countries without resorting to string manipulation:\n\n```python\n# using psycopg2\ncountryList = ['UK', 'France']\n\n# Use ANY with an array\nsql = 'SELECT * FROM countries WHERE country = ANY (%s)'\ndata = (countryList,)\ncur.execute(sql, data)\n```\n\nIn this modified code:\n\n- The `%s` placeholder is used for the parameter substitution.\n- The `countryList` is passed as a tuple `(countryList,)` to make sure it's correctly treated as a single parameter.\n- The `= ANY (%s)` construct is used to check if any element in the array matches the `country` column.\n\nBy using this method, you avoid the need for string manipulation and adhere to best practices for parameterized queries, which helps prevent SQL injection attacks."
