I have a large chunk of data and I want to extract just the first few lines without performing a split() operation on the entire string. The version of Python being used is 2.7. Here's an example to illustrate my scenario:\n\n```python\ndef handleMessage(msg):\n   headerTo  = msg.readline()\n   headerFrom= msg.readline()\n   sendMessage(headerTo,headerFrom,msg)\n\nmsg = \"Bob Smith\\nJane Doe\\nJane,\\nPlease order more widgets\\nThanks,\\nBob\\n\"\nhandleMessage(msg)\n```\nI want this to result in: \n```python\nsendMessage(\"Bob Smith\", \"Jane Doe\", \"Jane,\\nPlease order...\")\n```\nI understand that I could create a class to achieve this, but I'm interested in knowing whether there's a built-in solution."

        "content": "In Python 2.7, there's no built-in method to directly perform a `readline()` operation on a string as you would with a file object. However, you can utilize Python's `StringIO` module from the `io` library to achieve similar functionality. `StringIO` allows you to treat a string as a file-like object, enabling the use of `readline()` and other file operations.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `handleMessage` function to work with the `StringIO` class:\n\n```python\nfrom io import StringIO\n\ndef handleMessage(msg):\n    # Create a StringIO object from the string\n    msg_io = StringIO(msg)\n    \n    # Use readline() to read lines\n    headerTo  = msg_io.readline().strip()\n    headerFrom = msg_io.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Since the rest of the message is also needed, extract it\n    remaining_msg = msg_io.read().strip()\n    \n    # Call sendMessage with the required arguments\n    sendMessage(headerTo, headerFrom, remaining_msg)\n\ndef sendMessage(headerTo, headerFrom, remaining_msg):\n    print(\"To:\", headerTo)\n    print(\"From:\", headerFrom)\n    print(\"Message:\", remaining_msg)\n\n# Test the function\nmsg = \"Bob Smith\\nJane Doe\\nJane,\\nPlease order more widgets\\nThanks,\\nBob\\n\"\nhandleMessage(msg)\n```\n\nIn this example, `StringIO` is used to mimic file-like behavior, allowing you to call `readline()` and `read()` directly on the string. This way, you can efficiently extract the first few lines without having to split the entire string initially."
