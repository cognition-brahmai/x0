You can use the following formula to compute the surface area of a sphere: 4\u03c0r\u00b2. Please include the code to compute the mass of the sphere in grams, given its density. Finally, output the surface area and mass in a formatted string."

        "content": "Certainly! To compute the surface area of a sphere with a given radius and its mass given the density of the material, you can use the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nradius = 5  # Radius of the sphere in cm\ndensity = 3  # Density of the material in g/cm\u00b3\n\n# Compute the surface area of the sphere\nsurface_area = 4 * math.pi * radius ** 2\n\n# Compute the volume of the sphere\nvolume = (4/3) * math.pi * radius ** 3\n\n# Compute the mass of the sphere using the formula: mass = density * volume\nmass = density * volume\n\n# Output the results\nprint(f\"Surface Area of the sphere: {surface_area:.2f} cm\u00b2\")\nprint(f\"Mass of the sphere: {mass:.2f} grams\")\n```\n\nThis code calculates the surface area using the formula \\(4\\pi r^2\\) and the volume using the formula \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\). The mass is then calculated by multiplying the volume by the density. The results are printed in a formatted string."
