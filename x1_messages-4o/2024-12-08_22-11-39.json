        "content": "To fetch the last record from a table called 'Employees' using Go, you will typically use a SQL query to select the last record. The exact query may depend on how you define the \"last\" record (for instance, based on a timestamp or an auto-incrementing ID). Here's an example using the `database/sql` package to achieve this:\n\nAssuming you want to fetch the last record based on an auto-incrementing ID column named `id`, the code might look like this:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"database/sql\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"log\"\n\n    _ \"github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql\" // Import the MySQL driver\n)\n\ntype Employee struct {\n    ID   int\n    Name string\n    // Add more fields as per your table schema\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    // Replace with your own connection string\n    dsn := \"username:password@tcp(localhost:3306)/yourdbname\"\n    \n    db, err := sql.Open(\"mysql\", dsn)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n    defer db.Close()\n\n    var employee Employee\n\n    // Query to fetch the last record based on the highest ID\n    query := `SELECT id, name FROM Employees ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1`\n\n    row := db.QueryRow(query)\n    err = row.Scan(&employee.ID, &employee.Name)\n    if err != nil {\n        if err == sql.ErrNoRows {\n            fmt.Println(\"No records found\")\n        } else {\n            log.Fatal(err)\n        }\n    } else {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Last Employee Record: ID = %d, Name = %s\\n\", employee.ID, employee.Name)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- Replace `username`, `password`, `localhost:3306`, and `yourdbname` with your actual database credentials and connection details.\n- The SQL query `SELECT id, name FROM Employees ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1` fetches the last record based on the highest `id`. Adjust the query if you define \"last\" differently (e.g., based on a timestamp).\n- The `Scan` method maps the result to the `Employee` struct fields. Ensure you add all necessary fields to the struct and adjust the query and `Scan` accordingly.\n- Handle the case where no rows are returned to avoid runtime errors.\n\nEnsure you have the necessary database driver (in this case, MySQL) installed. You can install it using `go get`:\n\n```sh\ngo get -u github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql\n```\n\nThis code is a basic example and may require modifications to fit your specific database schema and application requirements."
