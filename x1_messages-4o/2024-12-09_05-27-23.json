Despite not encountering any errors during the process, I find no records in the table. I am utilizing the PostgreSQL database that came with the Bitnami djangostack installation. Do I need to commit the changes or is there something else I am missing? Below is the code I have been using:\n\n```python\nimport psycopg2\n\ntry:\n    conn = psycopg2.connect(\"dbname='djangostack' user='bitnami' host='localhost' password='password'\")\nexcept:\n    print \"Cannot connect to db\"\n\ncur = conn.cursor()\n\ntry:\n    cur.execute(\"\"\"insert into cnet values ('r', 's', 'e', 'c', 'w', 's', 'i', 'd', 't')\"\"\")\nexcept:\n    print \"Cannot insert\"\n```"

        "content": "It looks like you're missing a crucial step in your code: committing the transaction. In PostgreSQL, as with many other databases, you need to explicitly commit transactions to save the changes to the database. The default behavior for psycopg2 is to start a transaction implicitly, so without a commit, your changes won't be saved.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code with the commit added:\n\n```python\nimport psycopg2\n\ntry:\n    conn = psycopg2.connect(\"dbname='djangostack' user='bitnami' host='localhost' password='password'\")\n    cur = conn.cursor()\n\n    try:\n        cur.execute(\"\"\"INSERT INTO cnet VALUES ('r', 's', 'e', 'c', 'w', 's', 'i', 'd', 't')\"\"\")\n        conn.commit()  # Commit the transaction\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"Cannot insert:\", e)\n        conn.rollback()  # Rollback in case of error\n\nfinally:\n    cur.close()\n    conn.close()\n```\n\n### Additional Recommendations:\n1. **Error Handling:** It's a good practice to catch specific exceptions rather than generic ones so that you have a better understanding of what might go wrong.\n   \n2. **Connection Management:** Ensure that you close both the cursor and the connection with `cur.close()` and `conn.close()` to free up resources.\n\n3. **Parameterization:** Consider using parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection, like so:\n   ```python\n   cur.execute(\n       \"INSERT INTO cnet VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)\",\n       ('r', 's', 'e', 'c', 'w', 's', 'i', 'd', 't')\n   )\n   ```\n4. **Check Table Schema:** Ensure that the number of values and their data types match the table schema.\n\nBy making these adjustments, you should be able to insert records into your PostgreSQL database using psycopg2 successfully."
