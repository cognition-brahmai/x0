        "content": "To perform a comprehensive syntactic analysis and identify the grammatical elements in the sentence \"What is the capital of France?\", we can use the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) in Python. Additionally, we can determine the type of sentence (interrogative, declarative, or imperative) using simple pattern matching.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these tasks:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk import pos_tag, word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.tree import Tree\nfrom nltk.parse import CoreNLPParser\n\n# You might need to download these resources if they are not already present\nnltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')\nnltk.download('punkt')\n\n# Sentence\nsentence = \"What is the capital of France?\"\n\n# Tokenize and POS Tagging\ntokens = word_tokenize(sentence)\npos_tags = pos_tag(tokens)\n\n# Syntactic function using POS Tags and Constituency Parsing\ndef syntactic_analysis(sentence):\n    parser = CoreNLPParser(url='http://localhost:9000')  # CoreNLP server should be running\n    parse_tree = next(parser.raw_parse(sentence))\n    return parse_tree\n\n# Sentence type identification\ndef identify_sentence_type(sentence):\n    if sentence.endswith('?'):\n        return 'Interrogative'\n    elif sentence.endswith('.'):\n        return 'Declarative'\n    elif sentence.endswith('!'):\n        return 'Imperative'\n    else:\n        return 'Unknown'\n\n# Output\nsyntactic_function = syntactic_analysis(sentence)\nsentence_type = identify_sentence_type(sentence)\n\nprint(\"POS Tags:\", pos_tags)\nprint(\"Parse Tree:\", syntactic_function)\nprint(\"Sentence Type:\", sentence_type)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Syntax Rules and Principles\n\n1. **Tokenization and POS Tagging:**\n   - We first tokenize the sentence into individual words.\n   - Each word is then tagged with a part of speech (POS) using the `pos_tag` function. In the sentence \"What is the capital of France?\", the tags might look like this: `[('What', 'WP'), ('is', 'VBZ'), ('the', 'DT'), ('capital', 'NN'), ('of', 'IN'), ('France', 'NNP'), ('?', '.')]`.\n\n2. **Constituency Parsing:**\n   - We use the CoreNLPParser to get a parse tree of the sentence, which shows the hierarchical structure of the sentence according to the rules of syntax. This involves identifying noun phrases (NP), verb phrases (VP), and other elements as per the sentence structure.\n\n3. **Identifying Sentence Type:**\n   - The sentence type is identified by looking at the punctuation at the end of the sentence.\n   - A question mark '?' indicates an interrogative sentence.\n   - A period '.' indicates a declarative sentence.\n   - An exclamation mark '!' is typically used for imperative sentences (though context is also important).\n\nIn the sentence \"What is the capital of France?\", the use of the word \"What\" as a question word and the presence of a question mark at the end clearly indicate that it is an interrogative sentence. The parse tree and POS tags help in understanding the grammatical structure, such as identifying \"What\" as a Wh-pronoun, \"is\" as a verb, and so on."
