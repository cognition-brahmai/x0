        "content": "In this scenario, we have a sandbox where the sand particles, represented by their sizes, form a perfect square when arranged in a line. This means that the total number of sand particles, \\( n \\), is a perfect square, i.e., \\( n = k^2 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nYou mentioned that the smallest sand particle is represented by 1, which implies that the sand particles are likely represented by consecutive integers starting from 1. Therefore, the representations of the sand particles would be \\( 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n \\).\n\nGiven that the total number of particles \\( n \\) is a perfect square, the largest sand particle would be represented by the integer \\( n \\) itself.\n\nHence, the representation of the largest sand particle in the sandbox is \\( n \\), where \\( n = k^2 \\) for some integer \\( k \\)."
