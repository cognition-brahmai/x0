However, when I try to compile the code, I receive an error message as follows:\n\n```python\nFile \"client.py\", line 4, in \n   client_socket.connect(('localhost', 5000))\nFile \"\", line 1, in connect\nsocket.error: [Errno 111] Connection refused\n```\n\nI've done some research and found solutions suggesting changes in the port number and using 'connect' instead of 'bind', but none of these seem to apply to my situation. I am new to network programming and Python, so any help would be appreciated. The code I am working with is as follows:\n\n```python\n#client example\nimport socket\nclient_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\nclient_socket.connect(('localhost', 5000))\nwhile 1:\n    data = client_socket.recv(512)\n    if ( data == 'q' or data == 'Q'):\n        client_socket.close()\n        break;\n    else:\n        print \"RECIEVED:\" , data\n        data = raw_input ( \"SEND( TYPE q or Q to Quit):\" )\n        if (data <> 'Q' and data <> 'q'):\n            client_socket.send(data)\n        else:\n            client_socket.send(data)\n            client_socket.close()\n            break;\n```"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering, `[Errno 111] Connection refused`, typically means that there is no server listening on the specified address and port. In your case, it seems like the client is trying to connect to a server on `localhost` at port `5000`, but there is no server running on that port.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Server is Running:**\n   - Make sure you have a server program running on your machine that is listening on `localhost` at port `5000`. Without a server, your client will not be able to establish a connection.\n\n2. **Server Code Example:**\n   - Here\u2019s a simple server code you can use to test your client:\n\n   ```python\n   import socket\n\n   server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n   server_socket.bind(('localhost', 5000))\n   server_socket.listen(1)\n\n   print(\"Server is listening on port 5000\")\n\n   conn, addr = server_socket.accept()\n   print(f\"Connected by {addr}\")\n\n   while True:\n       data = conn.recv(512)\n       if not data or data.decode().lower() == 'q':\n           break\n       print(\"Received:\", data.decode())\n       conn.send(data)  # Echo back received data\n\n   conn.close()\n   server_socket.close()\n   ```\n\n   - Save this code in a separate file, e.g., `server.py`, and run it before you run your client.\n\n3. **Check Port Availability:**\n   - Ensure that port `5000` is available and not blocked by any firewall or used by another application.\n\n4. **Python Version Consideration:**\n   - Your client code seems to be written in Python 2. If you\u2019re using Python 3, you need to make some changes:\n     - Change `print` statements to use parentheses.\n     - Use `input()` instead of `raw_input()`.\n     - Use `!=` instead of `<>`.\n\n   Here\u2019s the modified client code for Python 3:\n\n   ```python\n   # client example\n   import socket\n\n   client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n   client_socket.connect(('localhost', 5000))\n   while True:\n       data = client_socket.recv(512).decode()\n       if data.lower() == 'q':\n           client_socket.close()\n           break\n       else:\n           print(\"RECEIVED:\", data)\n           data = input(\"SEND (TYPE q or Q to Quit): \")\n           if data.lower() != 'q':\n               client_socket.send(data.encode())\n           else:\n               client_socket.send(data.encode())\n               client_socket.close()\n               break\n   ```\n\n5. **Testing:**\n   - Run the server code first and ensure it is listening. Then, run the client code. You should be able to send messages back and forth.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the connection refused error and successfully run your socket client-server program."
