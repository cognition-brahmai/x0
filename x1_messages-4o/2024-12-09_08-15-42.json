        "content": "Downgrading your Python version from 3.7 to 3.6 can be done using a few different methods. Since you've already tried `brew` and `pyenv`, let's go over the steps to ensure everything is set up correctly. I'll outline the process using `pyenv`, which is often the most flexible and effective way to manage multiple Python versions.\n\n### Step-by-step Guide Using `pyenv`\n\n1. **Install pyenv** (if not already installed):\n   - Ensure you have the dependencies required for building Python versions:\n     ```bash\n     # For macOS\n     brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib\n     ```\n\n   - Install `pyenv` via Homebrew:\n     ```bash\n     brew update\n     brew install pyenv\n     ```\n\n2. **Configure shell environment for pyenv**:\n   - Add `pyenv` initialization to your shell startup file (e.g. `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc` for Zsh users, or `~/.bash_profile`):\n     ```bash\n     echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc\n     echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc\n     echo 'eval \"$(pyenv init --path)\"' >> ~/.bashrc\n     echo 'eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"' >> ~/.bashrc\n     ```\n\n   - Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or the respective file for your shell).\n\n3. **Install Python 3.6 using pyenv**:\n   - List all available Python versions to ensure 3.6.x is available:\n     ```bash\n     pyenv install --list\n     ```\n\n   - Install the desired version of Python 3.6 (replace `3.6.x` with the specific version number you want):\n     ```bash\n     pyenv install 3.6.x\n     ```\n\n4. **Set the Python version**:\n   - Set the global Python version to 3.6.x:\n     ```bash\n     pyenv global 3.6.x\n     ```\n\n   - Alternatively, set the Python version for a specific project directory:\n     ```bash\n     cd your_project_directory\n     pyenv local 3.6.x\n     ```\n\n5. **Verify your Python version**:\n   - Check to ensure that the correct version is now being used:\n     ```bash\n     python --version\n     ```\n\n6. **Install TensorFlow**:\n   - Once you have the correct Python version, you can proceed to install TensorFlow:\n     ```bash\n     pip install tensorflow\n     ```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n- **Ensure Shell Configurations Are Correct**: Double-check that your shell configuration file is correctly set up for `pyenv`.\n- **Rehash pyenv**: If you encounter issues, try rehashing `pyenv`:\n  ```bash\n  pyenv rehash\n  ```\n\n- **Check for Conflicting Python Installations**: Ensure there are no other conflicting Python installations that might be interfering with `pyenv`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully downgrade to Python 3.6 and install TensorFlow.
