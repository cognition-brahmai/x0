        "content": "Creating a function to check if a given sentence is a pangram in Scala involves ensuring that the sentence contains every letter of the alphabet at least once. To consider unusual linguistic or cultural considerations, we might want to think about alphabets with diacritics or scripts in other languages, but since we're focusing on the English alphabet, we'll keep it simple for now.\n\nHere's how you can systematically approach the problem:\n\n1. **Normalize the Input**: Convert the input string to lowercase to handle case insensitivity.\n2. **Filter Non-Alphabetic Characters**: Remove any non-alphabetic characters to focus on letters only.\n3. **Check for All Alphabet Letters**: Compare the set of letters in the input with the set of all 26 lowercase English letters.\n\nHere is the code following this approach:\n\n```scala\ndef isPangram(input: String): Boolean = {\n  // Normalize the input by converting it to lowercase\n  val normalizedInput = input.toLowerCase\n  \n  // Define a set containing all the letters of the English alphabet\n  val alphabetSet = ('a' to 'z').toSet\n  \n  // Extract only the alphabetical characters from the input\n  val lettersInInput = normalizedInput.filter(_.isLetter).toSet\n  \n  // Check if all alphabet letters are present in the input\n  alphabetSet.subsetOf(lettersInInput)\n}\n\n// Example usage\nprintln(isPangram(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\")) // true\nprintln(isPangram(\"Hello, World!\")) // false\n```\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Normalization**: We convert the input string to lowercase to ensure that we do not miss any letter due to case differences (e.g., 'A' vs 'a').\n  \n- **Filtering**: By filtering out non-letter characters, we handle cases where numbers, punctuation, or symbols are present in the input string. This ensures our comparison is only concerned with the alphabet.\n\n- **Set Comparison**: Using sets simplifies comparison. We check if the alphabet set is a subset of the letters found in the input. This method is efficient and concise.\n\n### Linguistic Considerations\n\nWhile this function works for the English alphabet, different languages have different alphabets which might include diacritical marks or additional letters. If you were to extend this function to handle other alphabets, you would need to adjust the `alphabetSet` accordingly. Additionally, cultural variations in language might require localization of the function to handle specific linguistic nuances."
