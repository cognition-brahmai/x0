This implies that the `cudaMemcpyAsync` function should fail if I use simple memory. However, when I tried the following program for testing purposes, this is not what happened. What is the effect of using pageable memory for asynchronous memory copy? How did `cudaMemcpyAsync` execute without page locked memory? Am I missing something here?\n\nKernel Code:\n\n```\n__global__ void kernel_increment(float* src, float* dst, int n)\n{\n    int tid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n\n    if(tid<n)   \n        dst[tid] = src[tid] + 1.0f;\n}\n```\n\nMain Code:\n\n```\nint main()\n{\n    float *hPtr1, *hPtr2, *dPtr1, *dPtr2;\n\n    const int n = 1000;\n\n    size_t bytes = n * sizeof(float);\n\n    cudaStream_t str1, str2;\n\n    hPtr1 = new float[n];\n    hPtr2 = new float[n];\n\n    for(int i=0; i<n; i++)\n        hPtr1[i] = static_cast<float>(i);\n\n    cudaMalloc<float>(&dPtr1,bytes);\n    cudaMalloc<float>(&dPtr2,bytes);\n\n    dim3 block(16);\n    dim3 grid((n + block.x - 1)/block.x);\n\n    cudaStreamCreate(&str1);\n    cudaStreamCreate(&str2);\n\n    cudaMemcpyAsync(dPtr1,hPtr1,bytes,cudaMemcpyHostToDevice,str1);\n    kernel_increment<<<grid,block,0,str2>>>(dPtr1,dPtr2,n);\n    cudaMemcpyAsync(hPtr2,dPtr2,bytes,cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost,str1);\n\n    printf(\"Status: %s\\n\",cudaGetErrorString(cudaGetLastError()));\n\n    cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n\n    printf(\"Status: %s\\n\",cudaGetErrorString(cudaGetLastError()));\n\n    cudaStreamDestroy(str1);\n    cudaStreamDestroy(str2);\n\n    cudaFree(dPtr1);\n    cudaFree(dPtr2);\n\n    for(int i=0; i<n; i++)\n        std::cout<<hPtr2[i]<<std::endl;\n\n    delete[] hPtr1;\n    delete[] hPtr2;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing when using `cudaMemcpyAsync` with pageable host memory can be explained by CUDA's handling of memory transfers. While it's true that using pinned (page-locked) memory is recommended for asynchronous transfers, CUDA does not strictly enforce this requirement, which is why your program still executes without errors. However, there are some important nuances and implications to understand:\n\n1. **Performance Considerations**: When you use pageable memory with `cudaMemcpyAsync`, CUDA internally uses a staging buffer in pinned memory to perform the transfer. This means that the data is first copied from pageable memory to this staging area, and then from the staging area to device memory. As a result, the transfer will not be truly asynchronous and might degrade performance compared to using pinned memory.\n\n2. **Implicit Synchronization**: Due to the use of a staging buffer with pageable memory, the transfer might involve implicit synchronization, which can reduce the overlap between computation and data transfer. The primary advantage of using asynchronous transfers is to overlap data transfers with kernel execution or other operations, and this advantage is diminished when using pageable memory.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Since `cudaMemcpyAsync` does not explicitly fail with pageable memory, the function call itself will succeed, but you might notice reduced performance. CUDA will still manage to execute the operations, but the expected performance gains from using streams and asynchronous operations might not be realized.\n\n4. **Correctness**: The correctness of your program is not affected by using pageable memory. The operations will still complete and produce the correct results, as you observed in your output.\n\nIn summary, while the use of pageable memory does not cause an outright failure with `cudaMemcpyAsync`, it can impact the performance benefits that are typically associated with asynchronous transfers. For optimal performance, especially when aiming for high throughput and overlapping data transfers with computation, it's recommended to use pinned memory. You can achieve this by using `cudaMallocHost` to allocate your host memory.\n\nIf you want to see the difference, try replacing the allocations for `hPtr1` and `hPtr2` with:\n\n```cpp\ncudaMallocHost(&hPtr1, bytes);\ncudaMallocHost(&hPtr2, bytes);\n```\n\nAnd remember to free this memory using `cudaFreeHost` rather than `delete[]`. This change should help you achieve the desired asynchronous behavior and performance improvements."
