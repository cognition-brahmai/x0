Here, I'll use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the entire first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \\(x\\) in both equations:\n\n\\[\n2(3x + 5y) = 2(1)\n\\]\n\nThis results in:\n\n\\[\n6x + 10y = 2\n\\]\n\nNow we have the modified system:\n\n1. \\(6x + 10y = 2\\)\n2. \\(6x + 4y = 2\\)\n\nNext, subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n(6x + 10y) - (6x + 4y) = 2 - 2\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n6y = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(y = 0\\).\n\nNow substitute \\(y = 0\\) back into the first original equation to find \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n3x + 5(0) = 1\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n3x = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(x = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nTherefore, the solution to the system of equations is:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{3}, \\quad y = 0\n\\]"
