        "content": "Certainly! The sequence you've provided seems to follow a pattern where each term is generated by the formula:\n\n\\[ a_n = 2^{(n+1)} + 2^{(n)} \\]\n\nFor the given sequence:\n- \\( a_1 = 2^{(1+1)} + 2^{(1)} = 2^2 + 2^1 = 4 + 2 = 6 \\)\n- \\( a_2 = 2^{(2+1)} + 2^{(2)} = 2^3 + 2^2 = 8 + 4 = 14 \\)\n- \\( a_3 = 2^{(3+1)} + 2^{(3)} = 2^4 + 2^3 = 16 + 8 = 30 \\)\n- \\( a_4 = 2^{(4+1)} + 2^{(4)} = 2^5 + 2^4 = 32 + 16 = 62 \\)\n\nContinuing this pattern for the next term:\n- \\( a_5 = 2^{(5+1)} + 2^{(5)} = 2^6 + 2^5 = 64 + 32 = 96 \\)\n\nHowever, the answer is mentioned to be a three-digit number, suggesting a different pattern or series might be involved. Let's consider the sequence follows a recursive pattern or double the previous term and add an increment as per a typical pattern found in some sequences.\n\nIn the given sequence, the differences between terms are increasing by powers of 2:\n- 6 - 2 = 4 = \\(2^2\\)\n- 14 - 6 = 8 = \\(2^3\\)\n- 30 - 14 = 16 = \\(2^4\\)\n- 62 - 30 = 32 = \\(2^5\\)\n\nContinuing this pattern:\n- Next difference = \\(2^6 = 64\\)\n\nAdding this to the last term in the sequence:\n- Next term = 62 + 64 = 126\n\nTherefore, the MATLAB code to generate the next number in the sequence would be:\n\n```matlab\n% Define the sequence\nsequence = [2, 6, 14, 30, 62];\n\n% Calculate the next term in the sequence\nnext_difference = 2^6; % The next difference based on the pattern\nnext_term = sequence(end) + next_difference;\n\n% Display the next term\ndisp(['The next term in the sequence is: ', num2str(next_term)]);\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the next term in the sequence, which is 126, a three-digit number."
