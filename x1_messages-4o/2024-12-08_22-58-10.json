The catch is that the website only accepts IP addresses that are in binary format and do not start with the binary sequence 01000000. Can you convert your IP address into binary format and figure out if it meets the website's criteria for access? Remember, the IP address must be in the standard IPv4 format (e.g. 192.168.0.1). Good luck!"
