Despite configuring my project to use this extension, I receive an error stating \"Unknown directive type 'autoclass'\" when I try to use `autoclass`. I have configured my `PYTHONPATH` correctly, but still encounter this issue. My index file is as follows:\n\n```python\n.. ATOM documentation master file, created by\n   sphinx-quickstart on Thu Nov 22 15:24:42 2012.\n   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least\n   contain the root `toctree` directive.\n\nWelcome to ATOM's documentation!\n================================\n\nContents:\n\n.. toctree::\n   :maxdepth: 2\n\n.. automodule:: atom\n\nIndices and tables\n==================\n\n* :ref:`genindex`\n* :ref:`modindex`\n* :ref:`search`\n```\n\nCan someone please assist me in resolving this problem?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"Unknown directive type 'autoclass',\" typically indicates that the `autodoc` extension isn't being properly loaded or configured in your Sphinx setup. Here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure `sphinx.ext.autodoc` is Enabled**:\n   Make sure that the `autodoc` extension is included in the `extensions` list in your `conf.py` file. It should look something like this:\n\n   ```python\n   extensions = [\n       'sphinx.ext.autodoc',\n       # other extensions\n   ]\n   ```\n\n2. **Check `sys.path` Configuration**:\n   Ensure that your `sys.path` is correctly set up to include the directory where your module is located. This is typically done in your `conf.py` file:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   import sys\n   sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../path/to/your/module'))\n   ```\n\n   Replace `../path/to/your/module` with the actual path to your module.\n\n3. **Verify `conf.py` Settings**:\n   Double-check other settings in your `conf.py` file. Ensure that there are no syntax errors or misconfigurations that might prevent Sphinx from loading extensions properly.\n\n4. **Rebuild Your Documentation**:\n   After making changes to your `conf.py` or other Sphinx configuration files, you should clean and rebuild your documentation. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   make clean\n   make html\n   ```\n\n   This will ensure that any outdated files are removed and everything is rebuilt from scratch.\n\n5. **Check the `autoclass` Directive Usage**:\n   Ensure that the `autoclass` directive is used correctly in your documentation files. It should be used inside a reStructuredText file, like so:\n\n   ```rst\n   .. autoclass:: YourClassName\n      :members:\n   ```\n\n   Make sure `YourClassName` is the correct name of the class you want to document.\n\n6. **Install/Update Sphinx**:\n   If the issue persists, make sure you have Sphinx and its extensions installed and updated. You can update Sphinx using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -U sphinx\n   ```\n\n7. **Check for Custom Directives**:\n   If you've defined any custom directives or extensions, ensure they are correctly implemented and not conflicting with `autodoc`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with the `autoclass` directive. If the problem continues, consider checking logs or console output for additional error messages that might provide further clues."
