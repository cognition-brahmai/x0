The following sample code calculates the average of positive numbers, but I need to modify it to handle negative numbers as well:\ndouble average(int array[], int size) {\n    double sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {\n        if (array[i] < 0) {\n            // handling negative numbers\n        }\n        sum += array[i];\n    }\n    return sum / size;\n}"

        "content": "To modify the function so that it calculates the average of both positive and negative numbers, you don't actually need to make any changes specific to handling negative numbers. The existing code already sums all numbers, regardless of their sign. However, if you want to ensure that negative numbers are included in the calculation of the average, you just need to make sure that the logic for summing and counting elements is correct.\n\nHere's how you can modify the function to ensure it handles both positive and negative numbers:\n\n```cpp\ndouble average(int array[], int size) {\n    if (size == 0) return 0;  // Handle the case where the array is empty to avoid division by zero.\n\n    double sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {\n        sum += array[i];  // Add both positive and negative numbers to the sum.\n    }\n    return sum / size;  // Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements.\n}\n```\n\nIf you were considering handling negative numbers differently, such as calculating separate averages for positive and negative numbers, you could expand the function like this:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nvoid average(int array[], int size, double &avgPositive, double &avgNegative) {\n    double sumPositive = 0;\n    double sumNegative = 0;\n    int countPositive = 0;\n    int countNegative = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {\n        if (array[i] >= 0) {\n            sumPositive += array[i];\n            countPositive++;\n        } else {\n            sumNegative += array[i];\n            countNegative++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    avgPositive = (countPositive > 0) ? (sumPositive / countPositive) : 0;\n    avgNegative = (countNegative > 0) ? (sumNegative / countNegative) : 0;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int numbers[] = {1, -2, 3, -4, 5};\n    int size = sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(numbers[0]);\n    double avgPos, avgNeg;\n\n    average(numbers, size, avgPos, avgNeg);\n\n    std::cout << \"Average of positive numbers: \" << avgPos << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Average of negative numbers: \" << avgNeg << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this expanded version, the function calculates and returns separate averages for positive and negative numbers. It uses reference parameters to provide the results back to the caller."
