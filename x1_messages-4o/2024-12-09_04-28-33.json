I used `dict.fromkeys(l, [0,0])` to initialize my dictionary with `[0,0]` as values. However, I found that when I modify one list, all others change as well. Is there a way to ensure that each value of the dictionary is a separate list without iterating over all keys and setting them equal to a list?\n\nHere is the code I used:\n\n```python\nl = ['a','b','c']\nd = dict.fromkeys(l, [0,0]) # initializing dictionary with [0,0] as values\n\nd['a'] is d['b'] # returns True\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering stems from the way `dict.fromkeys` works when you use a mutable object (like a list) as the default value. When you pass a mutable object as the default value in `dict.fromkeys`, all dictionary keys share the same single instance of that object. This is why modifying one list affects all the others.\n\nTo create a dictionary where each key has its own separate list, you can use a dictionary comprehension or a loop to initialize the dictionary. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Using Dictionary Comprehension\n\n```python\nl = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nd = {key: [0, 0] for key in l}\n\n# Now, each key in the dictionary 'd' has its own separate list\nd['a'] is d['b']  # This will return False\n```\n\n### Using a Loop\n\n```python\nl = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nd = {}\nfor key in l:\n    d[key] = [0, 0]\n\n# Again, each key has its own separate list\nd['a'] is d['b']  # This will return False\n```\n\nBoth methods ensure that each key in your dictionary is associated with a separate list, so changes to one list won't affect the others."
