After performing the necessary operations, I tried closing the connection using csr.close() and del csr as shown in the code below. However, this leaves me with an open connection. How do I properly close this connection?\n\n```python\nimport pyodbc\nconn = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER=MySQL ODBC 5.1 driver;SERVER=localhost;DATABASE=spt;UID=who;PWD=testest') \n\ncsr = conn.cursor()  \ncsr.close()\ndel csr\n```"

        "content": "To properly close the connection using pyodbc, you need to ensure that both the cursor and the connection are closed. In your code, you are only closing the cursor, but you should also close the connection. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pyodbc\n\n# Establish the connection\nconn = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER=MySQL ODBC 5.1 driver;SERVER=localhost;DATABASE=spt;UID=who;PWD=testest') \n\n# Create a cursor from the connection\ncsr = conn.cursor()\n\n# Perform your database operations here\n\n# Close the cursor\ncsr.close()\n\n# Close the connection\nconn.close()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Closing the Cursor:** This is important to free up database resources allocated for the cursor.\n2. **Closing the Connection:** This is crucial to ensure that the connection to the database is terminated and no resources are left hanging.\n\nAlways make sure to close both the cursor and the connection when you're done with your database operations to prevent any resource leaks."
