I found some information in the official documentation regarding the `subprocess.CalledProcessError` exception and the `returncode` attribute, but there are no examples given and I haven't found help on Google. How can I obtain the value of the error code?"

        "content": "To obtain the error code when a command fails using `subprocess.check_output`, you can indeed use the `subprocess.CalledProcessError` exception. This exception is raised when a command executed via `subprocess.check_output` returns a non-zero exit status. The `returncode` attribute of this exception contains the error code you're interested in.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this in your code:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\nsearch = \"your_search_term\"  # Replace this with your actual search term\n\ntry:\n    grepOut = subprocess.check_output(\"grep \" + search + \" tmp\", shell=True)\n    print(\"Command output:\", grepOut.decode())\nexcept subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\n    print(\"Command failed with error code:\", e.returncode)\n    print(\"Error message:\", e.output.decode())\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `subprocess.check_output` is used to execute the command.\n- If the command fails (i.e., returns a non-zero exit status), a `subprocess.CalledProcessError` is raised.\n- The `returncode` attribute of the exception contains the error code.\n- The `output` attribute contains the output of the command (if any), which you can decode and print to understand more about the failure.\n\nMake sure to replace `\"your_search_term\"` with the actual search term you want to use with `grep`. This example will catch the error, print the error code, and show the error message, if any."
