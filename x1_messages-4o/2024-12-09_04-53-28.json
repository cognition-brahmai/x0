        "content": "To round up an integer to the next hundred in Python, you can use a simple mathematical approach. You can define a function that calculates the next multiple of 100 greater than the given integer. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef round_up_to_next_hundred(n):\n    return math.ceil(n / 100) * 100\n\n# Example usage\nnumber = 130\nrounded_number = round_up_to_next_hundred(number)\nprint(rounded_number)  # Output: 200\n```\n\nIn this code, we first divide the number by 100, then use `math.ceil()` to round it up to the nearest integer, and finally multiply it back by 100 to get the next hundred. This will ensure that any number that is not already a multiple of 100 will be rounded up to the next hundred."
