Your goal is to find out the rate of change in the usage of the word over a certain period of time. \nTo calculate the rate of change, you need to use the formula: (final value - initial value) / initial value. The initial value is the number of times the word appears in the text corpus at the start of the time period, and the final value is the number of times it appears at the end of the time period. \nTo determine the usage of the word in the text corpus, use the formula: (number of times the word appears in the text corpus) / (total number of words in the text corpus). \nLastly, you need to provide examples of how the meaning of the word has shifted during the time period. Use context clues and analyze the surrounding words to determine any shifts in meaning. Good luck!"

        "content": "To tackle this task, we'll break it down into several steps. Here's a guide on how to perform the analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Initial and Final Word Usage\n\n1. **Initial and Final Word Count:**  \n   - First, identify the number of times the word appears in the text corpus at the start of the time period (Initial Count).\n   - Identify the number of times the word appears at the end of the time period (Final Count).\n\n2. **Total Word Count:**  \n   - Calculate the total number of words in the corpus at both the start and end of the period.\n\n3. **Usage Calculation:**  \n   - Calculate the word usage at the start:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Initial Usage} = \\frac{\\text{Initial Count}}{\\text{Total Words at Start}}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate the word usage at the end:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Final Usage} = \\frac{\\text{Final Count}}{\\text{Total Words at End}}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Rate of Change\n\n- Use the formula to determine the rate of change in word usage:  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Rate of Change} = \\frac{\\text{Final Usage} - \\text{Initial Usage}}{\\text{Initial Usage}}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Shift in Meaning\n\n1. **Contextual Analysis:**\n   - Examine the surrounding words in sentences or paragraphs where the word appears at both time points.\n   - Look for changes in modifiers, verbs, or nouns that accompany the word, as these can indicate shifts in meaning or connotation.\n\n2. **Semantic Analysis:**\n   - Identify any new contexts or subjects in which the word is used.\n   - Note changes in tone, such as from positive to negative or formal to informal usage.\n\n3. **Examples:**\n   - Provide specific examples from the text that illustrate these shifts. Note the context before and after to highlight how the usage has evolved.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's say we are analyzing the word \"cloud\" over a decade in a tech-related corpus.\n\n- **Initial Analysis (2010):**  \n  - \"Cloud\" is primarily used in the context of weather forecasts or poetic descriptions.\n  - Initial Usage: 0.05% of the total words.\n\n- **Final Analysis (2020):**  \n  - \"Cloud\" is predominantly used in the context of cloud computing and technology.\n  - Final Usage: 0.20% of the total words.\n\n- **Rate of Change Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Rate of Change} = \\frac{0.20\\% - 0.05\\%}{0.05\\%} = 300\\%\n  \\]\n  This indicates a significant increase in the usage of \"cloud\" in a technological context.\n\n- **Shift in Meaning:**\n  - In 2010, \"cloud\" might appear in contexts like \"the clouds are gathering\" or \"a cloud of mystery.\"\n  - By 2020, it might appear as \"cloud storage solutions\" or \"cloud infrastructure,\" indicating a shift towards an IT context.\n\nBy following these steps, you can analyze the frequency and semantic change of any word in a text corpus over time."
