        "content": "Pickling dynamically created nested classes in Python can be tricky because the pickle module requires that the classes and functions being pickled be importable from the top level of a module. Nested classes are not importable in this way, which is why you're encountering a `PicklingError`.\n\nTo work around this, you can define your nested classes at the module level instead of within another class. Here's how you can refactor your code:\n\n1. Move the nested classes out of the `WidgetType` class.\n2. Update the references to these classes accordingly.\n\nHere's an example of how you can refactor your code:\n\n```python\n# Define the classes at the module level\nclass FloatType(object):\n    pass\n\nclass TextType(object):\n    pass\n\nclass WidgetType(object):\n    # Just a placeholder if you still need this class\n    FloatType = FloatType\n    TextType = TextType\n\nclass ObjectToPickle(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.type = TextType  # Reference the TextType class directly\n\n# Now you can pickle an instance of ObjectToPickle\nimport pickle\n\nobj = ObjectToPickle()\nserialized_obj = pickle.dumps(obj)\n\n# You can also deserialize it back\ndeserialized_obj = pickle.loads(serialized_obj)\n```\n\nBy defining `FloatType` and `TextType` at the module level, they become directly importable, which allows `pickle` to serialize and deserialize instances of `ObjectToPickle` without errors. This should resolve the `PicklingError` you've encountered."
