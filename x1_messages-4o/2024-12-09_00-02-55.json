The main function already has two variables, num1 and num2, set to 5 and 10 respectively. Your task is to add a function that calculates the sum of these two numbers and returns the result. However, you cannot use the + operator or any other arithmetic operator in your implementation. Good luck!"

        "content": "Sure! To achieve this task without using the `+` operator or any other arithmetic operator, we can use bitwise operations. The sum of two numbers can be computed using bitwise XOR (^) and AND (&) operators, along with bit shifting. Here's how you can modify the C++ code to include a function that calculates the sum:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\n// Function to calculate the sum of two numbers using bitwise operations\nint addWithoutPlus(int a, int b) {\n    while (b != 0) {\n        // Calculate the carry using AND operator\n        int carry = a & b;\n\n        // Calculate the sum without carry using XOR operator\n        a = a ^ b;\n\n        // Shift the carry by one to add it to the next higher bit\n        b = carry << 1;\n    }\n    return a;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int num1 = 5;\n    int num2 = 10;\n    \n    int sum = addWithoutPlus(num1, num2);\n    \n    std::cout << \"The sum of \" << num1 << \" and \" << num2 << \" is: \" << sum << std::endl;\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **XOR (^)**: This operator gets the sum of bits without considering the carry.\n- **AND (&)**: This operator is used to determine which positions need a carry.\n- **Left Shift (<<)**: This operator shifts the carry to the next higher bit position.\n\nThe process is repeated in a loop until there is no carry left (i.e., `b` becomes zero), which means the addition is complete. This technique effectively simulates the addition process performed by a half-adder/full-adder in digital electronics."
