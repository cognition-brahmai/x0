I've observed that both functions seem to give similar results when I sample from a Normal distribution. Here is the example code I used:\n\n```python\nimport torch, seaborn as sns\n\nx = torch.distributions.Normal(torch.tensor([0.0]), torch.tensor([1.0]))\n```\n\nThe result is:\n\n```python\nsns.distplot(x.sample((100000,)))\nsns.distplot(x.rsample((100000,)))\n```\n\nWhen should I use `sample()`, and when should I use `rsample()`?"

        "content": "In PyTorch, both `sample()` and `rsample()` are methods used for generating samples from a probability distribution, but they are different in how they generate these samples and how they can be used in the context of differentiable programming.\n\n### `sample()`\n\n- **Purpose:** The `sample()` method generates samples from the distribution without any requirement for gradient tracking. This means the samples are drawn in a way that is not differentiable with respect to the parameters of the distribution.\n- **Use Case:** Use `sample()` when you don't need to compute gradients with respect to the parameters of the distribution. This is typically the case when you are simulating data or when the samples are not part of a neural network that requires backpropagation through the sampling process.\n\n### `rsample()`\n\n- **Purpose:** The `rsample()` method generates samples using the \"reparameterization trick,\" which allows gradients to flow through the sampling process. This makes it differentiable with respect to the distribution\u2019s parameters.\n- **Use Case:** Use `rsample()` when you need to incorporate the sampling process into a differentiable computation graph, such as when you are training models like variational autoencoders (VAEs) where the parameters of the distribution need to be learned and gradients need to be propagated through the samples.\n\n### Why They Appear Similar in Your Example\n\nIn your example, both `sample()` and `rsample()` give similar results because they are both sampling from the same Normal distribution. However, the key difference lies in how they handle gradient computation:\n\n- With `sample()`, the generated samples are not linked to the computation graph for backpropagation.\n- With `rsample()`, the generated samples are part of the computation graph, allowing gradients to be computed with respect to the distribution parameters.\n\n### Visualizing the Difference\n\nIn a typical scenario where you're not concerned about backpropagation through the sampling process, you might not see any difference in the sample distributions. However, in a machine learning model that learns distribution parameters, the choice of using `rsample()` would be crucial for enabling gradient-based optimization.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Use `sample()` for non-differentiable sampling.\n- Use `rsample()` for differentiable sampling when you need to backpropagate through the sampling process."
