        "content": "To create a C++ program that searches for a specific number in a sorted array using the binary search algorithm, you can follow these steps. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.\n\nHere is a simple C++ program that implements binary search:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function to perform binary search\nint binarySearch(int array[], int size, int target) {\n    int left = 0;\n    int right = size - 1;\n\n    while (left <= right) {\n        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\n\n        // Check if the target is present at mid\n        if (array[mid] == target) {\n            return mid; // Target found, return its index\n        }\n\n        // If target is greater, ignore the left half\n        if (array[mid] < target) {\n            left = mid + 1;\n        }\n        // If target is smaller, ignore the right half\n        else {\n            right = mid - 1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return -1; // Target not found\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Sorted array\n    int array[] = {2, 3, 4, 10, 40};\n    int size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);\n    int target = 10; // The number to be searched\n\n    int result = binarySearch(array, size, target);\n\n    if (result != -1) {\n        cout << \"Element found at index \" << result << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"Element not found in the array\" << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `binarySearch` takes an array, its size, and the target value to search for.\n- The `left` and `right` pointers represent the current search interval.\n- The `mid` index is calculated to check the middle element of the current search interval.\n- If the target value is equal to the middle element, its index is returned.\n- If the target is greater than the middle element, the left pointer is adjusted to `mid + 1`.\n- If the target is smaller than the middle element, the right pointer is adjusted to `mid - 1`.\n- The process repeats until the target is found or the search interval is empty.\n\nYou can change the `target` variable in the `main` function to search for different numbers in the array. The array must be sorted for binary search to work correctly."
