        "content": "I am working on creating a modular application in Flask using Blueprints but I am encountering a problem with creating models. It seems I have to reference the app to get the `db` object from Flask-SQLAlchemy. I would prefer to be able to use some blueprints with more than one app in a similar manner to Django apps. One solution could be to have the Blueprint create the `db` instance, which the app then imports along with the rest of the blueprint, but then any other blueprint wishing to create models would need to import from that blueprint instead of the app. Is there a way to let Blueprints define models without any awareness of the app they're being used in later and have several Blueprints come together without importing the app module/package from your Blueprint? Are Blueprints not meant to be independent of the app and be redistributable like Django apps? If not, what pattern should I use to create something similar? Should I use Flask extensions or centralize all models/schemas like Ruby on Rails?"

        "content": "Flask Blueprints are designed to help organize your application into modules, but they are not entirely independent of the application context like Django apps. Here are some approaches you can consider to manage models and database connections in a more modular fashion:\n\n1. **Application Factory Pattern**:\n   - Use an application factory function to create your Flask app. This pattern allows you to initialize extensions like Flask-SQLAlchemy without needing a global application context.\n   - In each of your blueprints, you can define models without immediately binding them to a database instance. Instead, you can bind them when the application is created.\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask\n   from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n\n   db = SQLAlchemy()\n\n   def create_app(config_filename):\n       app = Flask(__name__)\n       app.config.from_pyfile(config_filename)\n       db.init_app(app)\n\n       from your_blueprint_module import your_blueprint\n       app.register_blueprint(your_blueprint)\n\n       return app\n   ```\n\n2. **Separate Model Definitions**:\n   - Define your models in separate modules or packages. Import these models in your application factory and bind them to the `db` instance when the app is initialized.\n   - This way, you can reuse models across different applications by importing them into each app's factory function.\n\n3. **Flask-SQLAlchemy Bindings**:\n   - Use Flask-SQLAlchemy's ability to work with multiple databases by defining multiple binds. You can configure and bind models to different databases if needed.\n   - This approach allows you more flexibility if you want to distribute your models.\n\n4. **Flask Extensions**:\n   - If your blueprints require specific functionality, consider creating a custom Flask extension to encapsulate that functionality. This way, you can reuse the extension across different applications.\n\n5. **Model Centralization**:\n   - While it might seem counterintuitive to centralize models, you can still maintain modularity by organizing models in packages and using import statements judiciously. This approach is similar to how Django centralizes models in each app.\n\nIn summary, while Flask Blueprints are not as independent as Django apps, you can still achieve a modular architecture by using the application factory pattern, organizing models into packages, and leveraging Flask-SQLAlchemy's capabilities. This will allow you to maintain reusable components across different Flask applications."
