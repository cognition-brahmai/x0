I tried using `dt.date.today` after importing datetime as dt but it returned `<built-in method today of type object at 0x000000001E2658B0>` when I printed the date. Here's my code:\n```python\nimport datetime as dt     \ndate = dt.date.today\nprint(date)\n# <built-in method today of type object at 0x000000001E2658B0>\nDf['Date'] = date\n```"

        "content": "It looks like you're trying to assign today's date to a variable and then insert it into a DataFrame. The issue is that you're not actually calling the `today()` method; you're just referencing it. You need to include parentheses to call the method and get the current date.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport datetime as dt\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Get today's date\ndate = dt.date.today()\n\n# Format the date as Month/Day/Year\nformatted_date = date.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')\n\n# Create a DataFrame and set the 'Date' column\nDf = pd.DataFrame({'Date': [formatted_date]})\n\nprint(Df)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `dt.date.today()` gets today's date.\n- `strftime('%m/%d/%Y')` formats the date in the Month/Day/Year format.\n- A DataFrame is created with the formatted date as the 'Date' column.\n\nThis should give you a DataFrame with today's date in the desired format."
