        "content": "In general, when you set environment variables in a terminal session, they are scoped to that session. This means that once you close the terminal, the environment variables are lost. This behavior is consistent across most operating systems, including macOS, Linux, and Windows. The reason is that environment variables are typically meant to be temporary and specific to the current process and its children.\n\nHowever, you can make environment variables persist across terminal sessions by defining them in your shell's configuration files. On macOS, the default shell is usually `zsh` or `bash`, depending on your system version.\n\nHere's how you can make environment variables persistent:\n\n1. **For `zsh`:** Edit the `~/.zshrc` file.\n2. **For `bash`:** Edit the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file.\n\nAdd your environment variables to the respective file. For example:\n\n```sh\nexport MY_VARIABLE=\"my_value\"\n```\n\nAfter you add the variables, you can apply the changes immediately by sourcing the file:\n\n```sh\nsource ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc\n```\n\nThis way, the environment variables will be set each time you open a new terminal window.\n\nRemember, if you're running a script that needs these variables, and the script is executed in a different context (like a cron job or a system service), you might need to ensure the environment is set within that context as well."
