        "content": "To create a Python function that compares two numbers and returns the larger one, you can use a simple `if` statement to check which number is greater. Here's a sample function:\n\n```python\ndef get_larger_number(num1, num2):\n    if num1 > num2:\n        return num1\n    else:\n        return num2\n\n# Example usage:\nnumber1 = 10\nnumber2 = 20\nlarger_number = get_larger_number(number1, number2)\nprint(\"The larger number is:\", larger_number)\n```\n\nIn this function, `get_larger_number`, you pass two numbers, `num1` and `num2`, as arguments. The function uses an `if` statement to compare them. If `num1` is greater than `num2`, it returns `num1`; otherwise, it returns `num2`. You can call this function with any two numbers to find the larger one."
