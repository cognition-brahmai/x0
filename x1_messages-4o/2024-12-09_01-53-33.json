I have a list of strings and a separate string as shown below:\n\n```python\nlist1 = ['foo', 'fob', 'faz', 'funk']\nstring = 'bar'\n```\n\nI want to append 'bar' to each string in the list1 and store the result in a new list, for example:\n\n```python\nlist2 = ['foobar', 'fobbar', 'fazbar', 'funkbar']\n```\n\nI have tried using for loops and list comprehension but my attempts have not been successful. Can you help me with the correct way to do this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this using a list comprehension, which is a concise way to create a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable. Here's how you can append the string `'bar'` to each element in the `list1` and store the results in a new list called `list2`:\n\n```python\nlist1 = ['foo', 'fob', 'faz', 'funk']\nstring = 'bar'\n\nlist2 = [item + string for item in list1]\n\nprint(list2)\n```\n\nIn this code, `item + string` concatenates the string `'bar'` to each element in `list1`. The list comprehension iterates over each element in `list1`, performs the concatenation, and creates a new list `list2` with the resulting strings. When you run this code, `list2` will contain `['foobar', 'fobbar', 'fazbar', 'funkbar']`."
