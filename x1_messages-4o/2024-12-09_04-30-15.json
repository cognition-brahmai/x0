Here is the code I'm referring to:\n\n```python\nclass Test(object):\n  def method_one(self):\n    print \"Called method_one\"\n\n  def method_two():\n    print \"Called method_two\"\n\na_test = Test()\na_test.method_one()\na_test.method_two()\n```"

        "content": "Certainly! In Python, methods within a class can be instance methods, class methods, or static methods. Let's break down what's happening in the code you've provided:\n\n1. **`method_one(self)`**:\n   - This is an instance method. The `self` parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class. When you call this method, it automatically receives the instance (`a_test` in this case) as its first argument.\n   - You can call this method on an instance of the class, like `a_test.method_one()`, and it will work properly because it expects an instance as its first argument.\n\n2. **`method_two()`**:\n   - This is not properly set up as a static or class method. It lacks the `self` parameter, which means it doesn't automatically receive any reference to an instance or the class itself.\n   - When you try to call `a_test.method_two()`, it will raise a `TypeError` because Python tries to pass the instance `a_test` as the first argument, but `method_two()` is not configured to accept any arguments.\n\nTo fix this, you have two options depending on what you want the method to do:\n\n- **Static Method**: If `method_two` doesn't need access to the instance or class, you can make it a static method by using the `@staticmethod` decorator:\n\n  ```python\n  class Test(object):\n      def method_one(self):\n          print(\"Called method_one\")\n\n      @staticmethod\n      def method_two():\n          print(\"Called method_two\")\n\n  a_test = Test()\n  a_test.method_one()  # Works fine\n  a_test.method_two()  # Works fine\n  ```\n\n  Here, `method_two` is a static method, and you can call it on an instance or the class itself (`Test.method_two()`), without any issues.\n\n- **Class Method**: If you want `method_two` to have access to the class (but not necessarily an instance), you can make it a class method using the `@classmethod` decorator:\n\n  ```python\n  class Test(object):\n      def method_one(self):\n          print(\"Called method_one\")\n\n      @classmethod\n      def method_two(cls):\n          print(\"Called method_two\")\n\n  a_test = Test()\n  a_test.method_one()  # Works fine\n  a_test.method_two()  # Works fine\n  ```\n\n  In this case, `method_two` receives the class `Test` as its first argument, which is useful if you need to access or modify class-level attributes.\n\nIn summary, the difference in your code is due to the lack of a proper method signature for `method_two`. By using decorators like `@staticmethod` or `@classmethod`, you can define the method's behavior correctly."
