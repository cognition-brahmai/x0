        "content": "Certainly! You can modify your Python function to select 50 items at random from the original list using the `random.sample()` function. This function allows you to randomly select a specified number of items from a list without replacement. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef randomize_and_select_items(input_file, output_file, num_items=50):\n    # Read items from the input file\n    with open(input_file, 'r') as file:\n        items = file.readlines()\n    \n    # Remove any trailing newlines from each item\n    items = [item.strip() for item in items]\n\n    # Check if the list has at least num_items elements\n    if len(items) < num_items:\n        print(f\"Warning: The list contains only {len(items)} items, fewer than the requested {num_items}.\")\n        num_items = len(items)  # Adjust the number of items to select\n\n    # Select num_items randomly from the list\n    selected_items = random.sample(items, num_items)\n\n    # Write the selected items to the output file\n    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:\n        for item in selected_items:\n            file.write(item + '\\n')\n\n# Example usage\ninput_file = 'input.txt'\noutput_file = 'output.txt'\nrandomize_and_select_items(input_file, output_file)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Reading the file**: The function reads all items from the `input_file` and strips any trailing newline characters.\n- **Checking the list size**: Before attempting to select 50 items, the function checks if the list contains at least 50 items. If not, it adjusts the number of items to select to be the size of the list.\n- **Random selection**: `random.sample(items, num_items)` is used to select 50 items (or fewer if the list is smaller) at random.\n- **Writing to the output file**: The selected items are written to the `output_file`.\n\nThis approach ensures that you select 50 random items directly from the original list, and it handles cases where the list might have fewer than 50 items."
