        "content": "To efficiently check if each row in a numpy ndarray is strictly increasing, you can leverage vectorized operations provided by numpy, which are typically faster than iterating over rows with a Python loop. Here's how you can implement the `monotonically_increasing` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef monotonically_increasing(a):\n    # Calculate the differences between consecutive elements along each row\n    diffs = np.diff(a, axis=1)\n    # Check if all differences are positive (strictly increasing) for each row\n    is_increasing = np.all(diffs > 0, axis=1)\n    return is_increasing\n\n# Example usage\na = np.asarray([[1, 2, 3], [1, 5, 7], [4, 3, 6]])\nprint(monotonically_increasing(a))\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the function works:\n\n1. **`np.diff(a, axis=1)`**: This calculates the difference between each element and the next one along each row. For example, in the first row `[1, 2, 3]`, it will compute `[2-1, 3-2]` resulting in `[1, 1]`.\n\n2. **`diffs > 0`**: This creates a boolean array where each element indicates whether the corresponding difference is greater than 0.\n\n3. **`np.all(..., axis=1)`**: This checks if all elements in each row of the boolean array are `True`, indicating that the row is strictly increasing.\n\nThis approach is efficient for large matrices like 1000x1000 because it uses numpy's vectorized operations, which are highly optimized in C and avoid the overhead of Python loops."
