If the worker wants to double the amount of cement used, how much sand and water would they need to maintain the same ratio of ingredients? Assume all other factors remain constant. Hint: The ratio of sand to water to cement in the original mixture is 10:4:1."

To maintain the same ratio:\n\n1. **For sand:**\n   - Originally, for 1 kilogram of cement, 10 kilograms of sand is used.\n   - Therefore, for 2 kilograms of cement, the amount of sand needed would be \\(10 \\times 2 = 20\\) kilograms.\n\n2. **For water:**\n   - Originally, for 1 kilogram of cement, 4 liters of water is used (since the original ratio is 10:4:1, 4 liters is derived from \\(8 \\div 2\\)).\n   - Therefore, for 2 kilograms of cement, the amount of water needed would be \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) liters.\n\nThe worker will need 20 kilograms of sand and 8 liters of water to maintain the same ratio of ingredients while doubling the amount of cement."
