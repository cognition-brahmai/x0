        "content": "I am using scikit-learn's GridSearchCV to iterate over a parameter space to tune a model for a neural network. I have a grid with the parameters 'num_hidden_layers' ranges from 0 to 2, 'hidden_layer_size' ranges from 64 to 256, and 'activation' has options of 'sigmoid', 'relu', 'tanh'. However, I'm encountering an issue where the model runs redundant models when 'num_hidden_layers' is set to 0, running models with 0 hidden layers and 64, 128, and 256 units. This is inefficient and I need to write more code to remove redundancy in the results. Is there a way to prevent such parameter combinations, possibly by passing a tuple of parameters?\n\n```python\nparams = {'num_hidden_layers': [0,1,2],\n          'hidden_layer_size': [64,128,256],\n          'activation': ['sigmoid', 'relu', 'tanh']}\n```"

        "content": "To address the issue of running redundant model configurations where `num_hidden_layers` is set to 0, yet `hidden_layer_size` is still iterated over, you can use a custom parameter grid that excludes these unnecessary combinations. One effective approach is to use a list of dictionaries to specify valid parameter combinations explicitly. This involves manually constructing the grid to ensure that `hidden_layer_size` is only relevant when `num_hidden_layers` is greater than 0.\n\nHere is how you can modify your parameter grid:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n\n# Define parameter grid with valid combinations only\nparams = [\n    {'num_hidden_layers': [0], 'activation': ['sigmoid', 'relu', 'tanh']},\n    {'num_hidden_layers': [1, 2], 'hidden_layer_size': [64, 128, 256], 'activation': ['sigmoid', 'relu', 'tanh']}\n]\n\n# Assuming 'model' is your neural network model\ngrid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=model, param_grid=params, cv=5)\n\n# Fit the model with your data\ngrid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)\n```\n\nIn this setup:\n- When `num_hidden_layers` is 0, `hidden_layer_size` is not specified, ensuring no models are trained with hidden layers when they shouldn't be.\n- For `num_hidden_layers` set to 1 or 2, `hidden_layer_size` is included, allowing for testing of these configurations.\n\nThis approach ensures that only meaningful combinations of parameters are considered during the grid search, thereby eliminating unnecessary computations and making the process more efficient."
