I am currently using the following code which uses list comprehension and a generator:\n\n```python\nday_count = (end_date - start_date).days + 1\nfor single_date in [d for d in (start_date + timedelta(n) for n in range(day_count)) if d <= end_date]:\n    print strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\", single_date.timetuple())\n```\nI am printing the dates for demo purposes only but my actual use will be for generating a report. The `start_date` and `end_date` variables are `datetime.date` objects as I do not need the timestamps. For a start date of `2009-05-30` and an end date of `2009-06-09`, the output from the code is a list of dates from the start date to the end date. How can I better achieve this?"

        "content": "Your current implementation is functional, but it can be simplified for better readability and performance. You can achieve the same result without creating an unnecessary list using a generator expression directly in the for loop. Here's an improved version of your script:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import timedelta, date\n\ndef daterange(start_date, end_date):\n    for n in range((end_date - start_date).days + 1):\n        yield start_date + timedelta(n)\n\nfor single_date in daterange(start_date, end_date):\n    print(single_date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\"))\n```\n\n### Key Improvements:\n\n1. **Generator Function:** I've created a `daterange` generator function that yields each date in the range directly. This avoids the creation of an intermediate list, which is more memory efficient.\n\n2. **Use of `strftime`:** The `strftime` method is used directly on `single_date` for formatting, which is cleaner.\n\n3. **Code Readability:** The code is now more readable and easier to understand, making it clear that the function `daterange` is responsible for generating dates one by one.\n\nThis version of the code will iterate through each date from `start_date` to `end_date` inclusively, just like your original code, but with improved readability and performance."
