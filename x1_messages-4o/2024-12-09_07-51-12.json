    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that when you add a new column with `nullable=False` to an existing table, the database expects this column to have non-null values for all existing rows. Since the column is new, it doesn't have any data yet, resulting in null values for existing records, which violates the `nullable=False` constraint.\n\nHere are a few strategies to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Add with Default Value**: You can add the new column with a default value, which will be used to populate the column for existing rows. This ensures that no null values exist when the column is first created.\n\n    ```python\n    op.add_column('mytable', sa.Column('mycolumn', sa.String(), nullable=False, server_default='default_value'))\n    ```\n\n   After the column is created, you can remove the `server_default` if it's not needed:\n\n    ```python\n    with op.batch_alter_table('mytable') as batch_op:\n        batch_op.alter_column('mycolumn', server_default=None)\n    ```\n\n2. **Add as Nullable, Then Update**: Another approach is to first add the column as nullable, then update the values, and finally alter the column to be non-nullable.\n\n    ```python\n    op.add_column('mytable', sa.Column('mycolumn', sa.String(), nullable=True))\n    \n    # Update the column with a non-null value\n    op.execute('UPDATE mytable SET mycolumn = \\'default_value\\' WHERE mycolumn IS NULL')\n    \n    # Alter the column to be non-nullable\n    with op.batch_alter_table('mytable') as batch_op:\n        batch_op.alter_column('mycolumn', nullable=False)\n    ```\n\n3. **Use Backfill in a Separate Migration**: You could also consider using separate Alembic migration scripts to handle this in stages. First, add the column as nullable, then backfill it with non-null data, and finally alter it to be non-nullable.\n\nChoose the approach that best fits your application's needs and data integrity requirements."
