        "content": "Certainly! If you are working directly with TensorFlow and want to perform hyperparameter tuning, you have a few options that don't require using Keras or Tflearn:\n\n1. **Optuna**: Optuna is an automatic hyperparameter optimization framework that is very flexible and easy to integrate with TensorFlow. It allows you to define a search space for your hyperparameters, and it uses a process called \"samplers\" to efficiently explore the space.\n\n2. **Hyperopt**: Hyperopt is another popular library for hyperparameter optimization. It provides several optimization algorithms, including Random Search, TPE (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator), and more. You can easily define your search space and objective function with it.\n\n3. **Ray Tune**: Ray Tune is a scalable hyperparameter tuning library that supports distributed hyperparameter search. It integrates well with TensorFlow and provides a variety of search algorithms such as random search, Bayesian optimization, and more.\n\n4. **Scikit-Optimize (skopt)**: Skopt is a simple and efficient library for sequential model-based optimization, which is a type of Bayesian optimization. It can be used for hyperparameter tuning and is compatible with any model, including those built with TensorFlow.\n\n5. **Ax (Adaptive Experimentation Platform)**: Developed by Facebook, Ax is a platform for managing and optimizing experiments. It offers Bayesian optimization and can be used with TensorFlow models.\n\nThese libraries provide the flexibility to define optimization objectives and search spaces that suit your specific TensorFlow setup. You can integrate them into your TensorFlow code to optimize hyperparameters efficiently."
