        "content": "It seems like you're encountering an issue due to a recent change or update in the `tf-nightly` package, which might have affected the internal APIs. This can happen with pre-release versions like `tf-nightly` as they often contain experimental features and changes that are not yet stable. \n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. **Use a Stable TensorFlow Version:**\n   Instead of using `tf-nightly`, consider using the latest stable release of TensorFlow. You can install it by running:\n   ```python\n   !pip install tensorflow\n   ```\n\n2. **Check for Version Compatibility:**\n   If you need to use specific features from a nightly build, try to find a version that was working previously. You can specify the version by appending `==<version_number>` to the package name:\n   ```python\n   !pip install tf-nightly==<specific_version>\n   ```\n\n3. **Remove Old Installations:**\n   Ensure that there are no conflicting installations of TensorFlow and Keras. You can uninstall them and reinstall the desired versions:\n   ```python\n   !pip uninstall -y tensorflow tf-nightly keras keras-preprocessing\n   !pip install tensorflow  # or tf-nightly if needed\n   ```\n\n4. **Use Compatible Imports:**\n   Make sure that you're using compatible imports for TensorFlow and Keras. Since TensorFlow 2.x integrates Keras, it's recommended to use `tensorflow.keras` instead of standalone `keras`:\n   ```python\n   from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image\n   from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\n   from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import Callback, ModelCheckpoint, ReduceLROnPlateau, EarlyStopping\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Code for Deprecated Features:**\n   Ensure that your code does not rely on deprecated APIs. You may need to update parts of your code to use newer APIs if some functions have been removed or renamed.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import error and get your Colab notebook running again. If the problem persists, you can check TensorFlow's GitHub issues page or forums for any recent changes that might have affected the `tf-nightly` build."
