I understand that I can use `pip install project[extra]` when the project is on PyPI, and `pip install -e git+https://github.com/user/project.git#egg=project` for a git repository. However, I'm struggling to figure out how to combine these two options."

You can combine both the git URL and the extras in a single pip command. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/user/project.git#egg=project[extra]\n```\n\nIn this command:\n\n- `git+https://github.com/user/project.git` is the URL of the git repository.\n- `#egg=project` specifies the name of the project.\n- `[extra]` specifies the extras you want to install.\n\nMake sure to replace `user`, `project`, and `extra` with the appropriate username, repository name, and extras you wish to include. If there are multiple extras, you can separate them with commas, like so: `[extra1,extra2]`.\n\nThis command tells pip to clone the repository and install the package along with the specified extras."
