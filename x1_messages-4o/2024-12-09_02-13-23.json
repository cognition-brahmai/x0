        "content": "In Python 2.6, the `print` statement is not thread-safe because it can be interrupted by other threads, leading to jumbled output. To ensure thread-safe printing, you can use a lock to serialize access to `sys.stdout` or any other output stream.\n\nHere's how you can implement a thread-safe print function in Python 2.6 using the `threading` module:\n\n```python\nimport threading\nimport sys\n\n# Create a lock object\nprint_lock = threading.Lock()\n\ndef thread_safe_print(*args):\n    # Acquire the lock before printing\n    with print_lock:\n        # Use sys.stdout.write to print the arguments with a space separator\n        sys.stdout.write(' '.join(map(str, args)) + '\\n')\n\n# Example usage\ndef worker(number):\n    for i in range(3):\n        thread_safe_print(\"Worker\", number, \"iteration\", i)\n\n# Create multiple threads\nthreads = []\nfor i in range(5):\n    t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(i,))\n    threads.append(t)\n    t.start()\n\nfor t in threads:\n    t.join()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Lock Object**: A `Lock` object is created using `threading.Lock()`. This lock will be used to ensure that only one thread can execute the print operation at a time.\n- **thread_safe_print Function**: This function takes any number of arguments, acquires the lock, and then writes the output to `sys.stdout`. The lock is released automatically after the block inside `with` finishes.\n- **sys.stdout.write**: I used `sys.stdout.write` instead of `print` to have more control over the output format and ensure compatibility with Python 2.6.\n\nBy wrapping the print operation with a lock, you ensure that the output from different threads does not get mixed up, achieving thread safety."
