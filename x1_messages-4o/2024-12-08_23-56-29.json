However, focusing on the specifics:\n\n- **Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra**: It has a variant with 12GB RAM, an IP68 rating, supports 5G, and is priced around $1,200. It also has a battery life that can easily exceed 10 hours depending on usage.\n\n- **OnePlus 9 Pro**: This model also offers 12GB RAM, 5G connectivity, an IP68 rating (for some variants), and a battery life that can meet the 10-hour requirement. Its price is close to the range specified.\n\n- **Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max**: While Apple doesn't typically specify RAM, it is known for high performance and has an IP68 rating, 5G support, and a price around $1,200.\n\nBased on the specifications provided, the **Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra** seems the most likely candidate due to its direct alignment with the specified features and price range."
