I tried using the bash script `rm -r *.pyc`, expecting it to recurse through the folders and remove all .pyc files. However, this script is not working as expected. Could you guide me on what I am doing wrong and how I can correctly remove all .pyc files?"

To remove `.pyc` files recursively, you can use the `find` command in combination with `rm`. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\nOpen your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project, then run the following command:\n\n```bash\nfind . -name \"*.pyc\" -exec rm -f {} +\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what this command does:\n\n- `find .`: Starts the search from the current directory (`.`).\n- `-name \"*.pyc\"`: Searches for files ending with `.pyc`.\n- `-exec rm -f {} +`: Executes the `rm -f` command on each file found. The `{}` is a placeholder for the current file, and `+` allows `rm` to handle multiple files at once, which can be more efficient.\n\nThis will remove all `.pyc` files from your entire project directory structure. Make sure to double-check the command if you're using it in a production environment to avoid accidental deletion of important files."
