        "content": "To generate a summary of the article, you can use PHP libraries such as `PHP-ML` for machine learning tasks or `Summarizer` for natural language processing (NLP) in PHP. Here is an example of how you might integrate a simple text summarization into your existing PHP code:\n\n**Step 1: Install a Text Summarization Library**\n\nFirst, you need a summarization library. If you are using Composer, you can include a library like `summarizer`:\n\n```bash\ncomposer require joeferguson/summarizer\n```\n\n**Step 2: Modify Your PHP Code**\n\nHere's how you can modify your existing PHP code to include a summary of the article:\n\n```php\n<?php\nrequire 'vendor/autoload.php'; // Ensure this is correct path to your Composer autoload file\n\nuse Summarizer\\Summarizer;\n\n// Database connection details\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"username\";\n$password = \"password\";\n$dbname = \"database_name\";\n\n// Create connection\n$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n// Check connection\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n\n// Retrieve latest news article\n$sql = \"SELECT * FROM news_articles ORDER BY date_published DESC LIMIT 1\";\n$result = $conn->query($sql);\n\nif ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n    // Output data of the latest article\n    while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n        echo \"<h2>\" . $row[\"title\"] . \"</h2>\";\n        echo \"<p>\" . $row[\"content\"] . \"</p>\";\n\n        // Generate summary\n        $summarizer = new Summarizer();\n        $summary = $summarizer->summarize($row[\"content\"]);\n\n        // Output summary\n        echo \"<h3>Article Summary:</h3>\";\n        echo \"<p>\" . $summary . \"</p>\";\n    }\n} else {\n    echo \"0 results\";\n}\n\n$conn->close();\n?>\n```\n\n**Note:**\n- Ensure that you have installed and configured the library properly.\n- You might need to adjust the summarization method based on the library's capabilities.\n- The summarization might not be perfect due to the limitations of simple NLP libraries. For more advanced summarization, consider integrating with a more sophisticated NLP service or library.\n- Always ensure that any third-party library or service you use complies with your application's privacy and data security requirements."
