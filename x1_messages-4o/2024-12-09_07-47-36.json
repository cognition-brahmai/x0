Here is the current code I am using:\n\n```python\nnrow = ncol = 2\na = []\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=nrow, ncols=ncol)\nfor i, row in enumerate(axs):\n    for j, ax in enumerate(row):\n        a.append(ax)\n\nfor i, ax in enumerate(a):\n    ax.set_ylabel(str(i))\n```\nThis approach works well, even if `nrow` or `ncol` is equal to 1. However, I tried using list comprehension in the following way:\n\n```python\n[element for tupl in tupleOfTuples for element in tupl]\n```\nThis, however, fails if `nrows` or `ncols` is equal to 1. Is there a simple or clean way to achieve this?"

        "content": "When using `plt.subplots`, if either `nrows` or `ncols` is set to 1, `axs` becomes a 1D array instead of a 2D array (or a single `Axes` object if both are set to 1). This might cause issues when you attempt to iterate over it as if it's always 2D.\n\nTo handle this situation gracefully, you can use `np.ravel()` to flatten the array regardless of its dimension. Here's how you can modify your code to handle the case when either `nrows` or `ncols` is 1:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nnrow = ncol = 2\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=nrow, ncols=ncol)\n\n# Use np.ravel() to flatten the axs array\na = np.ravel(axs)\n\nfor i, ax in enumerate(a):\n    ax.set_ylabel(str(i))\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer using list comprehension, you can handle both cases by checking the dimension of `axs`:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nnrow = ncol = 2\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=nrow, ncols=ncol)\n\n# Check if axs is a 2D array or not\nif isinstance(axs, np.ndarray) and axs.ndim > 1:\n    a = [ax for ax_row in axs for ax in ax_row]\nelse:\n    a = np.ravel(axs)  # Or simply a = [axs]\n\nfor i, ax in enumerate(a):\n    ax.set_ylabel(str(i))\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis way, your code will work correctly regardless of whether `nrows` or `ncols` is 1."
