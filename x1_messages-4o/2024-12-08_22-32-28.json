        "content": "To include the top five largest cities for each state that shares a border with Mexico and display them in a LaTeX table format, you'll need to modify your Ruby code to fetch the city data as well. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Fetch City Data**: You'll need another API or dataset that provides city population data for each state.\n2. **Process and Sort Data**: Extract and sort the cities by population for each qualifying state.\n3. **Generate LaTeX Table**: Format the output as a LaTeX table.\n\nFor this example, I'll assume you have access to city population data and show you how to construct the LaTeX table. Since I don't have access to a specific API, I'll demonstrate using a hypothetical data structure.\n\nHere's a complete example:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'net/http'\nrequire 'json'\n\n# Example data structure for city populations in states\ncity_data = {\n  \"TX\" => [\n    { name: \"Houston\", population: 2328000 },\n    { name: \"San Antonio\", population: 1547000 },\n    { name: \"Dallas\", population: 1340000 },\n    { name: \"Austin\", population: 993000 },\n    { name: \"Fort Worth\", population: 902000 },\n    # Add more cities as needed\n  ],\n  \"NM\" => [\n    { name: \"Albuquerque\", population: 561000 },\n    { name: \"Las Cruces\", population: 102000 },\n    { name: \"Rio Rancho\", population: 99000 },\n    { name: \"Santa Fe\", population: 85000 },\n    { name: \"Roswell\", population: 48000 },\n    # Add more cities as needed\n  ],\n  \"AZ\" => [\n    { name: \"Phoenix\", population: 1690000 },\n    { name: \"Tucson\", population: 545000 },\n    { name: \"Mesa\", population: 508000 },\n    { name: \"Chandler\", population: 261000 },\n    { name: \"Scottsdale\", population: 255000 },\n    # Add more cities as needed\n  ],\n  \"CA\" => [\n    { name: \"Los Angeles\", population: 3980000 },\n    { name: \"San Diego\", population: 1420000 },\n    { name: \"San Jose\", population: 1035000 },\n    { name: \"San Francisco\", population: 883000 },\n    { name: \"Fresno\", population: 530000 },\n    # Add more cities as needed\n  ]\n}\n\n# LaTeX table header\nputs \"\\\\begin{table}[ht]\"\nputs \"\\\\centering\"\nputs \"\\\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\"\nputs \"\\\\hline\"\nputs \"State & Cities \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline\"\n\n# Loop through each state\ncity_data.each do |state_code, cities|\n  # Sort cities by population\n  sorted_cities = cities.sort_by { |city| -city[:population] }.first(5)\n  \n  # Format cities as a string\n  city_list = sorted_cities.map { |city| \"#{city[:name]} (#{city[:population]})\" }.join(\", \")\n\n  # Output LaTeX table row\n  puts \"#{state_code} & #{city_list} \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline\"\nend\n\n# LaTeX table footer\nputs \"\\\\end{tabular}\"\nputs \"\\\\caption{Top 5 Largest Cities in Each Border State}\"\nputs \"\\\\end{table}\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Data Structure**: Here, `city_data` is a hash with state codes as keys and arrays of city hashes as values. Each city hash contains the city name and population.\n- **Sorting and Selection**: For each state, cities are sorted by population in descending order, and the top five are selected.\n- **LaTeX Table**: The output is formatted as a LaTeX table with state codes and lists of the top five cities.\n\n### Note:\n- You will need to replace the `city_data` hash with actual data from an API or dataset.\n- Ensure you have proper permissions and access to the data source you choose for city populations."
