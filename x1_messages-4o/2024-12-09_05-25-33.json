        "content": "The error message \"CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version\" usually indicates a mismatch between the installed NVIDIA driver version and the version required by the CUDA toolkit you are using. Here are steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check CUDA Toolkit Version**:\n   - First, determine which version of the CUDA Toolkit you have installed. You can do so by checking the CUDA directory or running `nvcc --version` in the terminal.\n\n2. **Verify Driver Compatibility**:\n   - Visit the [NVIDIA CUDA compatibility page](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html) to determine the minimum driver version required for your CUDA Toolkit version.\n\n3. **Update NVIDIA Driver**:\n   - Since you are using driver version 331.79, it is likely too old for recent CUDA versions. You need to update your NVIDIA driver to a version compatible with your CUDA Toolkit.\n   - To update the driver, you can use the following steps:\n     - Open a terminal and run `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa` to add the graphics drivers PPA.\n     - Update your package list with `sudo apt-get update`.\n     - Install a newer driver version using `sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver-<latest-version>`, replacing `<latest-version>` with the latest version number available for your GPU (e.g., 460, 470, etc.).\n     - Reboot your system after installation.\n\n4. **Reinstall CUDA Toolkit** (if necessary):\n   - If updating the driver doesn't resolve the issue, consider reinstalling the CUDA Toolkit to ensure that its components are correctly set up.\n\n5. **Verify Installation**:\n   - After updating the driver and/or reinstalling the CUDA Toolkit, verify the installation by running `nvidia-smi` to check the driver version and running the `deviceQuery` program again.\n\n6. **Check Environment Variables**:\n   - Make sure your environment variables are set correctly:\n     - Add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`:\n       ```bash\n       export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}\n       export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}\n       ```\n     - Reload the shell with `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.profile`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully run the `deviceQuery` program."
