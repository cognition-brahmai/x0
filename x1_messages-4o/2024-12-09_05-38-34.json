When I invoke Python from the shell, it replicates its environment and starts the Python process. For instance, if I set an environment variable like so:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"FOO\"] = \"A_Value\"\n```\n\nWhen the Python process returns, \"FOO\", assuming it was undefined originally, will still be undefined. Is it possible to change this behavior? I am aware that this problem is typically solved using the command `source script_name.sh`, but this doesn't align with some other requirements I have."

        "content": "In general, a child process in Linux (or most operating systems) cannot directly modify the environment of its parent process. When you run a Python script from a shell, the script is executed in a child process. Any changes made to the environment variables within the script will not affect the parent shell's environment.\n\nHowever, you can work around this limitation using a few different approaches:\n\n1. **Exporting Environment Variables through a Script:**\n\n   You can have Python generate a shell script that exports the necessary environment variables, and then source that script from the parent shell. Here's a basic example:\n\n   ```python\n   # my_script.py\n   with open(\"set_env.sh\", \"w\") as f:\n       f.write('export FOO=\"A_Value\"\\n')\n   ```\n\n   Then, in your shell, you would run:\n\n   ```bash\n   python my_script.py\n   source set_env.sh\n   ```\n\n   This approach requires an extra step but allows you to modify the parent shell's environment.\n\n2. **Using `eval` with Command Substitution:**\n\n   You can have your Python script print out the export commands, and then use command substitution with `eval` to set the environment variables in the parent shell:\n\n   ```python\n   # my_script.py\n   print('export FOO=\"A_Value\"')\n   ```\n\n   Then you can run:\n\n   ```bash\n   eval $(python my_script.py)\n   ```\n\n   This method directly evaluates the output of the Python script in the shell, setting the environment variables.\n\n3. **Using a Wrapper Shell Script:**\n\n   You can create a shell script that both runs the Python script and sources another script with the environment changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   # wrapper.sh\n   python my_script.py\n   source set_env.sh\n   ```\n\n   Here, `my_script.py` would create `set_env.sh` as shown in the first method.\n\nThese methods provide a way to update the parent shell's environment indirectly by leveraging shell capabilities, as direct modification from within a child process is not possible."
