        "content": "I am trying to create a function 'test' in Python that takes in two parameters, a list 'X' and an integer 'N'. In the function, I am trying to get the shape of 'X' using the '.shape' attribute. However, I am encountering an error that says `AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'shape'`. I think this is because 'X' is a list and not a numpy array. How do I convert 'X' into a numpy array to avoid this error? Here is the code I am currently using:\n\n```python\ndef test(X, N):\n    [n,T] = X.shape\n    print \"n : \", n\n    print \"T : \", T\n\n\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\n\n    X = [[[-9.035250067710876], [7.453250169754028], [33.34074878692627]], [[-6.63700008392334], [5.132999956607819], [31.66075038909912]], [[-5.1272499561309814], [8.251499891281128], [30.925999641418457]]]\n    N = 200\n    test(X, N)\n```"

        "content": "To resolve the `AttributeError` you're encountering, you need to convert the list `X` into a NumPy array. This will allow you to use the `.shape` attribute, which is available for NumPy arrays. To do this, you first need to import the NumPy library and then convert the list to a NumPy array using `numpy.array()`. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef test(X, N):\n    X = np.array(X)  # Convert the list to a NumPy array\n    n, T, _ = X.shape  # Unpack the shape of the array; _ is used to ignore the third dimension\n    print(\"n:\", n)\n    print(\"T:\", T)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    X = [[[-9.035250067710876], [7.453250169754028], [33.34074878692627]], \n         [[-6.63700008392334], [5.132999956607819], [31.66075038909912]], \n         [[-5.1272499561309814], [8.251499891281128], [30.925999641418457]]]\n    N = 200\n    test(X, N)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Import NumPy**: Ensure that you have imported the NumPy library using `import numpy as np`.\n2. **Convert List to NumPy Array**: Use `np.array(X)` to convert the list `X` into a NumPy array.\n3. **Unpack Shape**: The shape of the array is unpacked into `n`, `T`, and `_`. The underscore `_` is used to ignore the third dimension since it's not needed in the print statements.\n\nThis should resolve the error and allow you to work with the shape of `X` as intended."
