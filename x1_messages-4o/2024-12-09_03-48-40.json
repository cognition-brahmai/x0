Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef list_files_in_directory(directory):\n    try:\n        # List all entries in the given directory\n        entries = os.listdir(directory)\n        \n        # Filter out entries that are not files\n        files = [entry for entry in entries if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(directory, entry))]\n        \n        return files\n    \n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        return f\"The directory '{directory}' does not exist.\"\n    except PermissionError:\n        return f\"Permission denied for accessing the directory '{directory}'.\"\n\n# Example usage:\ndirectory_path = '/path/to/your/directory'\nfile_names = list_files_in_directory(directory_path)\nprint(file_names)\n```\n\nReplace `'/path/to/your/directory'` with the path to the directory you want to list the files from. This script will print a list of file names that are directly within the specified directory, excluding any files within sub-directories."
