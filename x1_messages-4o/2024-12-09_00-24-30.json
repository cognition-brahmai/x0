After running 'nvidia-smi -L', I get the following output: \n\n```C:\\Users\\me>nvidia-smi -L    \nGPU 0: Quadro K2000 (UUID: GPU-b1ac50d1-019c-58e1-3598-4877fddd3f17)    \nGPU 1: Quadro 2000 (UUID: GPU-1f22a253-c329-dfb7-0db4-e005efb6a4c7)\n```\n\nHowever, when I use the same IDs in my code with 'cuDeviceGetName(.., ID)', the devices seem to be inverted, with GPU 0 becoming Quadro 2000 and GPU 1 becoming Quadro K2000. I am currently using CUDA 6.5. Is this an expected behavior or a bug? Is there a workaround to get the 'real' ID of GPUs using 'nvidia-smi'? I have thought of using the UUID to get the proper device with 'nvmlDeviceGetUUID()', but it seems too complicated for my needs. I've also looked at the nvidia-smi manpage, which recommends using either UUDI or PCI bus ID for consistency, as device enumeration order is not guaranteed to be consistent. However, I'm still looking for a simpler solution."

        "content": "The inconsistency you're experiencing between the `nvidia-smi` output and the CUDA device enumeration is a known issue, primarily because the way GPUs are enumerated by the operating system, NVIDIA drivers, and CUDA runtime can differ. This is not a bug per se but rather an artifact of how devices are accessed and ordered.\n\nHere are some points and potential workarounds:\n\n1. **Device Enumeration Order**: The enumeration order of GPUs can vary based on how the operating system recognizes them and how the CUDA runtime initializes them. This can lead to differences in the order reported by `nvidia-smi` and CUDA functions such as `cuDeviceGetName()`.\n\n2. **Using PCI Bus IDs**: Instead of relying on the device IDs, consider using the PCI Bus IDs to uniquely identify and access GPUs. The PCI Bus ID is a unique identifier for each GPU and remains consistent across different tools like `nvidia-smi`, CUDA, and NVML.\n\n3. **UUIDs**: While using UUIDs might seem complex, they are a reliable way to identify GPUs uniquely. You can retrieve the UUID for each device using NVML and map it to the CUDA device using the device properties.\n\n4. **nvmlDeviceGetPciInfo**: You can use NVML to get the PCI info (Bus ID) for the GPUs and then use this information to map to CUDA device IDs. This method involves using NVML functions such as `nvmlDeviceGetHandleByIndex` and `nvmlDeviceGetPciInfo`.\n\n5. **Check CUDA Runtime Version**: Ensure you are using a compatible and up-to-date version of the CUDA Runtime with your drivers. Sometimes, updating the CUDA toolkit and drivers can resolve discrepancies.\n\n6. **Environment Variables**: There are environment variables such as `CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER` and `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` that can affect how devices are enumerated. Ensure these are not causing any unexpected behavior.\n\nHere's a basic outline of how you might use PCI Bus IDs in your code:\n\n```c\n// Use NVML to get the PCI Bus ID of the device\nchar pciBusId[NVML_DEVICE_PCI_BUS_ID_BUFFER_SIZE];\nnvmlDeviceGetPciInfo(device, &pciInfo);\nstrncpy(pciBusId, pciInfo.busId, NVML_DEVICE_PCI_BUS_ID_BUFFER_SIZE);\n\n// Use this PCI Bus ID to match with the CUDA device\nint deviceCount;\ncudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < deviceCount; i++) {\n    char cudaPciBusId[13];\n    cudaDeviceGetPCIBusId(cudaPciBusId, 13, i);\n    if (strcmp(cudaPciBusId, pciBusId) == 0) {\n        // This is the matching device\n        cudaSetDevice(i);\n        break;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy aligning the PCI Bus IDs from NVML and CUDA, you can ensure that you're interacting with the correct GPU, regardless of the enumeration order differences."
