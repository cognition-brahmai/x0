I was successful in installing pyenv through Homebrew, however, I encounter an error when attempting to install a new version of Python. I think the issue might be related to the new M1 chip or the Big Sur OS. Despite following the instructions provided in these links: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/1643#issuecomment-655710632 and https://dev.to/kojikanao/install-python-3-8-0-via-pyenv-on-bigsur-4oee, the error message remains the same. Below is the command I input into the terminal and the error message I receive:\n\n```\n$ CFLAGS=\"-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include -I$(brew --prefix bzip2)/include -I$(brew --prefix readline)/include -I$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)/usr/include\" LDFLAGS=\"-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib -L$(brew --prefix readline)/lib -L$(brew --prefix zlib)/lib -L$(brew --prefix bzip2)/lib\" pyenv install --patch 3.8.3 < <(curl -sSL https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/8ea6353.patch\\?full_index\\=1)\npython-build: use openssl@1.1 from homebrew\npython-build: use readline from homebrew\nDownloading Python-3.8.3.tar.xz...\n-> https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.3/Python-3.8.3.tar.xz\nInstalling Python-3.8.3...\npatching file Misc/NEWS.d/next/macOS/2020-06-24-13-51-57.bpo-41100.mcHdc5.rst\npatching file configure\nHunk #1 succeeded at 3398 (offset -28 lines).\npatching file configure.ac\nHunk #1 succeeded at 498 (offset -12 lines).\npython-build: use readline from homebrew\npython-build: use zlib from xcode sdk\nBUILD FAILED (OS X 11.1 using python-build 20180424)\nInspect or clean up the working tree at /var/folders/w3/wh28vlqs2txcyl67cjcd689h0000gn/T/python-build.20201217143449.26458\nResults logged to /var/folders/w3/wh28vlqs2txcyl67cjcd689h0000gn/T/python-build.20201217143449.26458.log\nLast 10 log lines:\nchecking size of _Bool... 1\nchecking size of off_t... 8\nchecking whether to enable large file support... no\nchecking size of time_t... 8\nchecking for pthread_t... yes\nchecking size of pthread_t... 8\nchecking size of pthread_key_t... 8\nchecking whether pthread_key_t is compatible with int... no\nconfigure: error: Unexpected output of 'arch' on OSX\nmake: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.

        "content": "Installing Python on a Mac with an M1 chip can indeed present some challenges due to the architecture differences and system configurations. The issue you're facing seems to be related to the 'arch' output not being recognized correctly during the configuration phase. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Rosetta 2 is Installed**: Some Python versions might require Rosetta 2 to emulate x86 architecture. You can install it using:\n   ```bash\n   /usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Homebrew Architecture**: Make sure that Homebrew is installed for both ARM and x86, as you might need to switch between them. You can install the x86 version by running:\n   ```bash\n   arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Use `arch` Command**: When running `pyenv install`, try forcing the x86 architecture to see if it resolves the issue:\n   ```bash\n   arch -x86_64 pyenv install 3.8.3\n   ```\n\n4. **Update Pyenv and Plugins**: Ensure that you have the latest version of pyenv and any relevant plugins:\n   ```bash\n   brew upgrade pyenv\n   ```\n\n5. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed for building Python:\n   ```bash\n   brew install openssl readline zlib bzip2\n   ```\n\n6. **Set Environment Variables**: You might need to explicitly set environment variables for flags:\n   ```bash\n   export CFLAGS=\"-I$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)/include -I$(brew --prefix bzip2)/include -I$(brew --prefix readline)/include\"\n   export LDFLAGS=\"-L$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)/lib -L$(brew --prefix readline)/lib -L$(brew --prefix zlib)/lib -L$(brew --prefix bzip2)/lib\"\n   ```\n\n7. **Try Different Python Version**: If 3.8.3 is problematic, you can try installing a slightly different version like 3.8.10 or 3.9.x that might have better support for M1 and Big Sur.\n\n8. **Review Build Logs**: Check the logs at the path provided in the error message for more insights into what might be going wrong.\n\n9. **Use a Precompiled Version**: As a last resort, consider using a precompiled Python version for M1, which can be installed through other tools like `miniconda` if building from source continues to be problematic.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully install Python using pyenv on your M1 MacBook Air."
