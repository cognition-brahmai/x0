These countries are known for their significant influence on regional and global affairs, particularly in terms of economic power. Here's a brief overview of each country's economic growth over the past decade:\n\n1. **Brazil**: \n   - **Early 2010s**: Brazil experienced strong economic growth, largely driven by a commodities boom and increased consumer spending.\n   - **Mid-2010s**: The economy faced a severe recession starting in 2014, attributed to falling commodity prices, political instability, and structural economic issues.\n   - **Late 2010s to early 2020s**: Brazil's economy showed signs of recovery, but growth remained modest. Challenges included political uncertainty, inflation control, and structural reforms.\n   - **2020s**: The COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted Brazil's economy, but recovery efforts have been ongoing with a focus on digitalization and infrastructure investment.\n\n2. **Russia**:\n   - **Early 2010s**: Russia benefited from high oil prices, which contributed to economic growth. However, growth was uneven and heavily reliant on energy exports.\n   - **Mid-2010s**: The economy was hit by Western sanctions following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, along with a drop in oil prices, leading to a recession.\n   - **Late 2010s**: Russia experienced modest recovery, focusing on fiscal stability and diversification efforts to reduce dependency on oil and gas.\n   - **2020s**: The global pandemic and fluctuating oil prices affected economic performance. Russia has been focusing on technological innovation and import substitution to drive growth.\n\n3. **India**:\n   - **Early 2010s**: India saw rapid economic growth, fueled by reforms, a young workforce, and increased foreign investment.\n   - **Mid-2010s**: Growth continued, though slowed by regulatory challenges, rural distress, and demonetization in 2016.\n   - **Late 2010s to early 2020s**: India continued to experience strong growth, driven by the services and technology sectors. However, the pandemic resulted in a sharp contraction followed by a recovery phase.\n   - **2020s**: India has been focusing on infrastructure development, digital transformation, and manufacturing to boost economic resilience.\n\n4. **China**:\n   - **Early 2010s**: China's economy was characterized by rapid growth, driven by industrialization, export expansion, and urbanization.\n   - **Mid-2010s**: Growth began to moderate as China transitioned from an investment-led to a consumption-driven economy. Structural reforms were implemented to address debt and environmental concerns.\n   - **Late 2010s to early 2020s**: The trade war with the United States and the COVID-19 pandemic posed challenges, but China rebounded quickly, maintaining growth through strong domestic consumption and technological advancement.\n   - **2020s**: China continues to focus on high-quality growth, emphasizing innovation, technology, and sustainable development.\n\nOverall, the BRIC countries have faced diverse challenges and opportunities over the past decade, with each country navigating its unique path to economic growth and development."
