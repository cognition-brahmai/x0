The survey contains two questions: one inquiring about the level of satisfaction with the service and the other asking about the likelihood of recommending the service to a friend. The possible responses are categorized into five levels for each question."

        "content": "To calculate the mean score for each question in a customer satisfaction survey using a Likert scale, you'll first need to assign numerical values to each of the response categories. Typically, the scale might be assigned values like this:\n\n1. Very Satisfied / Very Likely\n2. Satisfied / Likely\n3. Neutral\n4. Unsatisfied / Unlikely\n5. Very Unsatisfied / Very Unlikely\n\nOnce you have the responses collected, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Assign Numerical Values**: Convert each response to its corresponding numerical value.\n\n2. **Sum the Scores for Each Question**: Add up all the numerical values for each question.\n\n3. **Count the Number of Responses**: Determine how many responses were given for each question.\n\n4. **Calculate the Mean Score**: Divide the total score by the number of responses for each question.\n\nLet's walk through an example:\n\nSuppose you have the following responses for each question:\n\n- **Satisfaction with the Service**: Very Satisfied (1), Satisfied (2), Neutral (3), Satisfied (2), Very Unsatisfied (5)\n- **Likelihood to Recommend**: Likely (2), Very Likely (1), Neutral (3), Very Unlikely (5), Likely (2)\n\n**Calculations**:\n\n1. **Satisfaction with the Service**:\n   - Numerical values: [1, 2, 3, 2, 5]\n   - Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 13\n   - Number of responses = 5\n   - Mean score = 13 / 5 = 2.6\n\n2. **Likelihood to Recommend**:\n   - Numerical values: [2, 1, 3, 5, 2]\n   - Sum = 2 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 13\n   - Number of responses = 5\n   - Mean score = 13 / 5 = 2.6\n\nThus, both questions have a mean score of 2.6, indicating a general tendency towards satisfaction and likelihood to recommend, closer to the \"Satisfied\" and \"Likely\" responses on the Likert scale."
