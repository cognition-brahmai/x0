Here is an example of my code:\n\n```python\nclass Person():\n    def __init__(self, name, phone):\n        self.name = name\n        self.phone = phone\n\nclass Teenager(Person):\n    def __init__(self, name, phone, website):\n        self.name=name\n        self.phone=phone\n        self.website=website\n```\n\nI have a feeling that there are redundant parts in this code. Could you help me identify which parts are redundant with respect to which attributes are already inherited from the parent class?"

        "content": "Certainly! In your code, the `Teenager` class is inheriting from the `Person` class, which means it already has access to the `name` and `phone` attributes. However, in your current implementation of the `Teenager` class, you are manually assigning `name` and `phone` again in the `__init__` method, which leads to redundancy.\n\nTo avoid this redundancy, you can use the `super()` function to call the `__init__` method of the `Person` class. This will automatically initialize the `name` and `phone` attributes, allowing you to focus only on the additional attributes specific to the `Teenager` class, such as `website`.\n\nHere's your revised code:\n\n```python\nclass Person:\n    def __init__(self, name, phone):\n        self.name = name\n        self.phone = phone\n\nclass Teenager(Person):\n    def __init__(self, name, phone, website):\n        super().__init__(name, phone)  # Call the parent class's __init__ method\n        self.website = website  # Initialize additional attribute\n```\n\nBy using `super().__init__(name, phone)`, you ensure that the `name` and `phone` attributes are inherited and initialized properly without redundancy. The `Teenager` class then only needs to handle its additional `website` attribute."
