The error message is \"python-pylint 'C0103:Invalid constant name\". Even though I'm aware that this issue might not be critical, it's causing me inconvenience. How can I resolve this issue? The code for my program is as follows:\n\n```python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\nimport sys\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom flask_bootstrap import Bootstrap\nfrom flask_moment import Moment\nfrom flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n\nreload(sys)\nsys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'hard to guess string'\napp.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'mysql://root:@localhost:3306/test?'\napp.config['SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN'] = True\napp.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = True\n\nbootstrap = Bootstrap(app)\nmoment = Moment(app)\ndb = SQLAlchemy(app)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    db.create_all()\n    app.run()\n```"

        "content": "The Pylint error \"C0103: Invalid constant name\" is a naming convention violation warning. Pylint follows PEP 8, which is the Python style guide, and it expects constants to be named using all uppercase letters with underscores separating words. In your code, the variable names `app`, `bootstrap`, `moment`, and `db` are being flagged because Pylint considers them to be constants due to their global scope, and it expects them to be named in uppercase.\n\nHere are a few possible solutions to address this issue:\n\n1. **Rename Variables:**\n   You can rename your global variables to follow the PEP 8 guideline for constants. However, this might not be practical if you prefer these names for readability.\n\n2. **Suppress the Warning:**\n   If you don't want to rename the variables, you can suppress the warning by adding a comment at the top of your file to disable this specific Pylint message:\n\n   ```python\n   # pylint: disable=C0103\n   ```\n\n   This will suppress all \"Invalid constant name\" warnings in the file.\n\n3. **Pylint Configuration:**\n   You can configure Pylint to ignore this particular warning by adding or modifying a `.pylintrc` configuration file in your project directory. Add the following line under the `[MESSAGES CONTROL]` section:\n\n   ```\n   disable=C0103\n   ```\n\n   This will disable the warning across your project.\n\n4. **Local Suppression:**\n   If you want to suppress the warning only for specific lines, you can use an inline comment to disable the warning temporarily:\n\n   ```python\n   app = Flask(__name__)  # pylint: disable=C0103\n   bootstrap = Bootstrap(app)  # pylint: disable=C0103\n   moment = Moment(app)  # pylint: disable=C0103\n   db = SQLAlchemy(app)  # pylint: disable=C0103\n   ```\n\nChoose the option that best fits your needs and coding style preferences."
