Then, you reach into the box again and take out one more ball. What is the probability that the second ball is the same color as the first ball you set aside? \nHint: Consider the number of balls left in the box after you take the first ball out."

The first ball is black.\n2. The first ball is white.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for each scenario:\n\n1. **First ball is black:**\n   - Probability of drawing a black ball first: \\( \\frac{30}{60} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n   - After removing one black ball, you have 29 black balls and 30 white balls left.\n   - Probability of drawing another black ball: \\( \\frac{29}{59} \\).\n\n2. **First ball is white:**\n   - Probability of drawing a white ball first: \\( \\frac{30}{60} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n   - After removing one white ball, you have 30 black balls and 29 white balls left.\n   - Probability of drawing another white ball: \\( \\frac{29}{59} \\).\n\nNow, we calculate the total probability that the second ball is the same color as the first one:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Total Probability} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{29}{59}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{29}{59}\\right) = \\frac{29}{59}.\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability that the second ball is the same color as the first one is \\(\\frac{29}{59}\\)."
