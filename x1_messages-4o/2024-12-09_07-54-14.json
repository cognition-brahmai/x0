I am unsure what the `10` parameter represents in this line of code. Does it signify the number of filters or the number of activations the filter will provide?"

This parameter specifies how many different convolutional filters will be applied to the input data.\n\nEach filter will produce a separate feature map, so the output of this convolutional layer will have 10 feature maps. These feature maps can be thought of as different \"views\" or aspects of the input data that the network has learned to recognize. Therefore, the `10` signifies the number of feature maps or activations that the layer will output."
