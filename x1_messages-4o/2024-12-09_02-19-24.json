        "content": "In PyTorch, the `nn.Sequential` class does not have an `add` method like Keras's Sequential model. Instead, you can pass the layers as arguments to the `nn.Sequential` constructor at the time of initialization. Here's how you can construct a sequential model similar to the one you attempted:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nnet = nn.Sequential(\n    nn.Linear(3, 4),\n    nn.Sigmoid(),\n    nn.Linear(4, 1),\n    nn.Sigmoid()\n)\n\nnet.float()\n```\n\nIn this code, you directly pass the layers as arguments to `nn.Sequential`. The model will contain a linear layer with 3 input features and 4 output features, followed by a Sigmoid activation, another linear layer with 4 input features and 1 output feature, and another Sigmoid activation. This should work without any attribute errors."
