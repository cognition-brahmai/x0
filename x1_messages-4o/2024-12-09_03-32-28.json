However, `redis.keys()` is returning a list of bytes objects, such as `[b'abcde']`, instead of strings. I've tried setting `charset`, `encoding`, and `decode_responses` in my redis generator, but it hasn't worked. How can I insert the data as a string ahead and not have to iterate over the keys list and change each element to a string while checking it?"

        "content": "When using the `redis-py` library, the default behavior is to return keys and values as bytes. To automatically decode these bytes into strings, you need to set the `decode_responses` parameter to `True` when you create your Redis client instance. This should solve the issue of having to manually decode each key or value.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport redis\n\n# Create a Redis client with decode_responses set to True\nclient = redis.StrictRedis(\n    host='localhost',  # Your Redis server host\n    port=6379,         # Your Redis server port\n    db=0,              # Your Redis database\n    decode_responses=True  # Automatically decode bytes to strings\n)\n\n# Now, when you use client.keys() or any other method, the responses will be strings\nkeys = client.keys('*')  # Get all keys\nprint(keys)  # This will print a list of strings instead of a list of bytes\n```\n\nWith `decode_responses=True`, all responses from the Redis server are automatically decoded using the specified encoding (default is UTF-8). This includes keys, values, and any other data returned from the server. So, you don't need to manually decode each key or value, and you can directly work with strings in your Python code."
