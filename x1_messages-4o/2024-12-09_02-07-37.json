        "content": "It sounds like you've encountered a common issue where pgAdmin4 appears to start successfully according to the logs, but the application doesn't fully load or display as expected. Here are several steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Clear Browser Cache**: If you're accessing pgAdmin4 through a web browser, try clearing your browser cache or using a different browser to see if that resolves the issue.\n\n2. **Disable Browser Extensions**: Sometimes, browser extensions can interfere with web applications. Try disabling extensions temporarily to see if pgAdmin4 loads correctly.\n\n3. **Check Firewall and Antivirus**: Ensure that your firewall or antivirus software isn't blocking pgAdmin4. You might need to add an exception for the application or temporarily disable these services to test.\n\n4. **Reinstall pgAdmin4**: There might be an issue with the current installation. Uninstall pgAdmin4, delete any leftover configuration files, and reinstall it.\n\n5. **Check Server Mode Configuration**: Ensure that the SERVER_MODE parameter in the configuration is set correctly. It should be set to `False` for desktop mode if you're running it locally.\n\n6. **Check for Conflicting Processes**: Make sure no other processes are using the same port (64222 in your case). You can use tools like `netstat` to check for port conflicts.\n\n7. **Run as Administrator**: Try running pgAdmin4 with administrator privileges. Right-click the application and select \"Run as Administrator.\"\n\n8. **Check for Errors in Developer Tools**: Open the developer tools in your browser (usually accessible with F12) and check the console for any errors that might provide additional clues.\n\n9. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure that the necessary Python environment variables are correctly set up, as the application relies on Python to function.\n\n10. **Update pgAdmin4**: Ensure you are using the latest version of pgAdmin4, as updates often fix bugs and improve compatibility.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, you might want to check the community forums for pgAdmin4 or file a bug report if you believe it might be a software issue."
