        "content": "In Flask, you can execute a specific action for every request without using a decorator by utilizing the `before_request` and `after_request` hooks. These hooks allow you to run code before and after each request, respectively. For adding analytics information, you can choose either of these hooks depending on whether you need the information before the request is processed or after.\n\nHere's how you can use these hooks:\n\n1. **Using `before_request`:** This hook is executed before the request is processed by the view function. It's useful for tasks like logging, authentication checks, etc.\n\n    ```python\n    from flask import Flask\n\n    app = Flask(__name__)\n\n    @app.before_request\n    def before_request_func():\n        # Code to execute before each request\n        print(\"This code runs before each request.\")\n        # Add your analytics logic here\n\n    @app.route('/')\n    def index():\n        return \"Hello, World!\"\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        app.run(debug=True)\n    ```\n\n2. **Using `after_request`:** This hook is executed after the request is processed by the view function, but before the response is sent to the client. It's useful for tasks like modifying the response or logging response details.\n\n    ```python\n    from flask import Flask, request\n\n    app = Flask(__name__)\n\n    @app.after_request\n    def after_request_func(response):\n        # Code to execute after each request\n        print(\"This code runs after each request.\")\n        # Add your analytics logic here\n        # You can use the `response` object if needed\n        return response\n\n    @app.route('/')\n    def index():\n        return \"Hello, World!\"\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        app.run(debug=True)\n    ```\n\n3. **Combining both hooks:** If you need to execute code both before and after the request, you can use both hooks together.\n\n    ```python\n    from flask import Flask, request\n\n    app = Flask(__name__)\n\n    @app.before_request\n    def before_request_func():\n        print(\"This code runs before each request.\")\n        # Add your analytics logic here\n\n    @app.after_request\n    def after_request_func(response):\n        print(\"This code runs after each request.\")\n        # Add your analytics logic here\n        return response\n\n    @app.route('/')\n    def index():\n        return \"Hello, World!\"\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        app.run(debug=True)\n    ```\n\nBy using these hooks, you can ensure that your analytics code runs for every request without having to manually decorate each view function."
