I have been successfully running several Python scripts, invoking them from a base script using the subprocess module: `subprocess.popen([sys.executable, 'script.py'], shell=True)`. However, these scripts execute some simulations (.exe files from a C++ application) that generate output to the shell. All these outputs are written to the base shell from where I've launched these scripts. I would like to create a new shell for each script. Despite my attempts to create new shells using the `shell=True` attribute when calling subprocess.call (also tried with popen), it is not working. How can I create a new shell for each process generated with the subprocess.call?"

        "content": "To initiate new shells for each Python script you run from a base script, you can use the `subprocess.Popen` function with the appropriate parameters. However, the `shell=True` parameter alone does not necessarily open a new terminal window. On Windows, you might need to specify the use of a new terminal explicitly. Below are examples for both Windows and Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS):\n\n### For Windows:\nYou can use the `start` command in combination with `subprocess.Popen` to open a new command prompt window for each script you run:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\nscripts = ['script1.py', 'script2.py', 'script3.py']  # List your scripts here\n\nfor script in scripts:\n    subprocess.Popen(['start', 'cmd', '/k', sys.executable, script], shell=True)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the command used:\n- `start`: A command to open a new command prompt window.\n- `cmd`: Opens a command prompt.\n- `/k`: Keeps the command prompt open after the script execution.\n\n### For Unix-like Systems:\nOn Unix-like systems, you can use terminal emulators such as `gnome-terminal`, `xterm`, or `konsole` to open new terminal windows for each script:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\nscripts = ['script1.py', 'script2.py', 'script3.py']  # List your scripts here\n\nfor script in scripts:\n    subprocess.Popen(['gnome-terminal', '--', sys.executable, script])\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `gnome-terminal` with your preferred terminal emulator if you're not using GNOME.\n\n### Note:\n- Ensure that the terminal emulator commands are installed and available in your system's `PATH`.\n- This approach opens a new terminal window for each script, which can help in viewing outputs separately.\n\nBy using these methods, each script will run in its own separate terminal window, allowing you to see the output of your simulations in isolation."
