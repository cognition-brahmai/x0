Here's a basic example:\n\n```ruby\n# Define the words in the required order\nwords = ['control', 'economy', 'politics']\n\n# Construct the sentence\nsentence = \"The #{words[0]} of the #{words[1]} is often influenced by #{words[2]}.\"\n\n# Output the sentence\nputs sentence\n```\n\nWhen you run this Ruby script, it will output the sentence: \"The control of the economy is often influenced by politics.\" \n\nFeel free to modify the sentence structure as you see fit!"
