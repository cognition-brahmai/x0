        "content": "Yes, it is possible to display a pandas DataFrame in Visual Studio Code while debugging, similar to how it is displayed in PyCharm. Visual Studio Code provides several ways to inspect data during debugging, and with the right setup, you can achieve a similar experience. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Install the Python Extension**: Ensure you have the Python extension for Visual Studio Code installed. This extension provides support for debugging Python code.\n\n2. **Use the Debugger**: When you set a breakpoint in your code and start debugging, you can inspect variables, including pandas DataFrames, in the 'Variables' panel. However, this might not display the DataFrame in a tabular format directly.\n\n3. **Interactive Window**: You can open an interactive window by using the Jupyter extension (also from Microsoft). This allows you to run cells interactively and view DataFrames in a Jupyter-like format. You can highlight the code you want to execute, right-click, and select \"Run Selection/Line in Interactive Window.\"\n\n4. **Data Viewer**: Visual Studio Code has a built-in Data Viewer that can display DataFrames in a tabular format. To use it, you can:\n   - Go to the 'Variables' panel during a debugging session.\n   - Locate your DataFrame variable.\n   - Click on the magnifying glass icon next to the DataFrame variable name to open it in the Data Viewer.\n\n5. **Jupyter Notebooks**: If you prefer a notebook interface, you can use Jupyter Notebooks directly within Visual Studio Code. This provides a seamless way to interact with pandas DataFrames as you would in other notebook environments.\n\nBy using these methods, you can effectively inspect and interact with pandas DataFrames while debugging in Visual Studio Code."
