To solve this issue, you need to convert the integer `c` to a string before concatenation. Here's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\na = raw_input(\"Enter a: \")\nb = raw_input(\"Enter b: \")\nprint \"a + b as strings: \" + a + b\na = int(a)\nb = int(b)\nc = a + b\nprint \"a + b as integers: \" + str(c)\n```\n\nIn this corrected code, I've used `str(c)` to convert the integer `c` to a string, which allows you to concatenate it with other strings in the `print` statement without encountering a TypeError."
