I tried using a for loop to iterate over the dataframe but I'm not sure if it's the most efficient way. In addition, I have more than 100 columns and I don't want to explicitly name the columns that I want to update. I want to divide the value of each column by 2 (except for the stream column). So, how can I divide all values by 2 of all rows that have stream 2, without changing the stream column?\n\n```python\nfor index, row in df.iterrows():\n    if df1.loc[index,'stream'] == 2:\n       # do something\n```"

        "content": "You can efficiently update the values of the columns in a Pandas DataFrame using boolean indexing and vectorized operations, without the need for an explicit loop. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. First, filter the DataFrame to get only the rows where the \"stream\" column is 2.\n2. Then, divide all columns by 2 except the \"stream\" column.\n\nHere's how you can do it using Pandas:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Example DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'stream': [1, 2, 2, 1, 3],\n    'feat': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],\n    'another_feat': [15, 25, 35, 45, 55],\n    # Add more columns as needed\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Boolean mask for rows where 'stream' is 2\nmask = df['stream'] == 2\n\n# Divide all columns by 2 where the mask is True, except for the 'stream' column\ndf.loc[mask, df.columns != 'stream'] /= 2\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `mask = df['stream'] == 2` creates a boolean mask that is `True` for the rows where the \"stream\" column is 2.\n- `df.loc[mask, df.columns != 'stream'] /= 2` uses this mask to select the relevant rows and columns. It divides the values in all columns except 'stream' by 2 for those rows.\n- Note that we use `df.columns != 'stream'` to exclude the \"stream\" column from being divided.\n\nThis approach is vectorized and should be more efficient than using a for loop, especially for larger DataFrames."
