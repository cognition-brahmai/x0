The dataframe looks like this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nx = np.tile(np.arange(3),3)\ny = np.repeat(np.arange(3),3)\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"x\": x, \"y\": y})\n```\nThe dataframe `df` is:\n\n```python\n   x  y\n0  0  0\n1  1  0\n2  2  0\n3  0  1\n4  1  1\n5  2  1\n6  0  2\n7  1  2\n8  2  2\n```\nI need to sort this dataframe first by column `x`, and second by column `y`, so I used the following code:\n\n```python\ndf2 = df.sort_values([\"x\", \"y\"])\n```\n\nThe sorted `df2` is:\n\n```python\n   x  y\n0  0  0\n3  0  1\n6  0  2\n1  1  0\n4  1  1\n7  1  2\n2  2  0\n5  2  1\n8  2  2\n```\nNow, I want to reset the index such that it becomes ascending again. I want to obtain this:\n\n```python\n   x  y\n0  0  0\n1  0  1\n2  0  2\n3  1  0\n4  1  1\n5  1  2\n6  2  0\n7  2  1\n8  2  2\n```\nI tried using the following code, but it didn't work as expected. It doesn't change the index at all:\n\n```python\ndf2.reindex(np.arange(len(df2.index)))\n```\nHow can I correctly reset the index after sorting the dataframe?"

        "content": "To reset the index of your sorted DataFrame `df2` and make it ascending, you should use the `reset_index` method. By default, `reset_index` will drop the old index and create a new one. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndf2 = df2.reset_index(drop=True)\n```\n\nThis will give you the desired DataFrame with a reset index:\n\n```python\n   x  y\n0  0  0\n1  0  1\n2  0  2\n3  1  0\n4  1  1\n5  1  2\n6  2  0\n7  2  1\n8  2  2\n```\n\nThe `drop=True` parameter ensures that the old index is not added as a column in the DataFrame. This is typically what you want when you just want to reorder the index without keeping the old one."
