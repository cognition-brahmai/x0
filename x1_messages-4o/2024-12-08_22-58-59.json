        "content": "To establish a correlation between the rise of online retail sales and a specific demographic group's purchasing behavior, we would need both the sentence and the table of online retail sales data that you're referring to. However, without specific data, I can provide a hypothetical example:\n\nLet's say the sentence mentions an increase in online retail sales over the past five years. The table shows data indicating that a significant portion of this increase is attributed to millennials aged 25-34.\n\nExample Correlation:\n- Online retail sales have been rising steadily over the past five years.\n- The data reveals that millennials (age group 25-34) have shown a marked increase in online purchases during this period.\n- This correlation suggests that millennials, who are tech-savvy and prioritize convenience, have contributed significantly to the growth in online retail sales due to their preference for digital shopping platforms.\n\nIf you provide more specific details or data, I can tailor the correlation more accurately to the information you have."
