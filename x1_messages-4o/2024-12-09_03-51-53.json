        "content": "In Python, the built-in string type is implemented in C as part of the CPython interpreter, which makes it a bit challenging to locate directly in Python's source code. However, you can find it within the CPython source code repository.\n\nThe string type in Python is represented by the `PyUnicodeObject` structure, and its implementation can primarily be found in the `Objects` directory of the CPython source code, specifically in the following files:\n\n1. **`unicodeobject.c`** - This file contains the implementation of the Unicode string type in Python.\n2. **`stringobject.c`** - Although this file used to contain the implementation for byte strings (in Python 2), in Python 3, the focus is mainly on Unicode strings, so most string-related functionality is in `unicodeobject.c`.\n\nYou can explore the CPython GitHub repository for the specific version of Python you are interested in. For example, the GitHub repository for CPython is located at [https://github.com/python/cpython](https://github.com/python/cpython).\n\nFor documentation on how the string type is implemented and its methods, you can refer to the official Python documentation:\n- [Built-in Types: Text Sequence Type - str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str)\n\nIf you're interested in overloading the `+` operator for strings, you can achieve this by subclassing `str` and overriding the `__add__` method. Here's an example of how you might do this in Python:\n\n```python\nclass CustomString(str):\n    def __add__(self, other):\n        # Customize the behavior of the + operator\n        if isinstance(other, str):\n            return CustomString(super().__add__(other))\n        return NotImplemented\n\n# Example usage\ns1 = CustomString(\"Hello\")\ns2 = CustomString(\"World\")\nprint(s1 + s2)  # Output: HelloWorld\n```\n\nIn this example, `CustomString` is a subclass of `str`, and we override the `__add__` method to provide custom behavior for the `+` operator."
