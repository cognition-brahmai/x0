I am trying to print a list of the objects that have been found using the code `print([category_index.get(i) for i in classes[0]])` or print the number of objects found using `print(num_detections)`. However, in both cases, it gives me a list with 300 values or simply a value `[300.]` respectively. I am using Faster RCNN model's config file and checkpoints for training. How can I return only the objects that are present in the image?"

        "content": "When using TensorFlow's Object Detection API with models like Faster R-CNN, you typically get outputs that include all potential detections with their associated scores. The reason you're seeing 300 values is that the model outputs a fixed number of predictions, which is often set to 300 by default in the Faster R-CNN model configuration. However, not all of these predictions correspond to actual objects as many are likely to have scores below a certain threshold.\n\nTo filter out the relevant detections, you need to apply a score threshold that will help you determine which objects are actually present. Here's how you can modify your code to only print the objects that have a detection score above a certain threshold (e.g., 0.5):\n\n1. **Set a score threshold**: Decide on a minimum score threshold to consider a detection as valid. A common value is 0.5, but you can adjust this based on your needs.\n\n2. **Filter detections**: Use this threshold to filter out low-confidence detections.\n\nHere is a code snippet to illustrate this process:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming you have the following variables from your model's output\n# boxes: array of bounding box coordinates\n# scores: array of detection scores\n# classes: array of detected class indices\n# num_detections: total number of detections (though it might be set to 300, not all are valid)\n# category_index: dictionary mapping class indices to class names\n\n# Set your desired score threshold\nscore_threshold = 0.5\n\n# Filter out detections below the threshold\nvalid_detections = [i for i in range(int(num_detections)) if scores[0][i] > score_threshold]\n\n# Print the valid detections\nprint(\"Detected objects:\")\nfor i in valid_detections:\n    class_id = int(classes[0][i])\n    class_name = category_index.get(class_id, {}).get('name', 'N/A')\n    score = scores[0][i]\n    print(f\"Object: {class_name}, Score: {score}\")\n\n# If you just want to print the number of valid detections\nprint(\"Number of valid detections:\", len(valid_detections))\n```\n\nThis code filters the detections using a score threshold, extracts the class names for valid detections, and prints them. Adjust the `score_threshold` according to the specificity and sensitivity you need for your application."
