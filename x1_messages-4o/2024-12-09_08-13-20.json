The device properties for my laptop's GT650m show 384 cores, 2 SMPs, with 1024 threads per SMP. How are these numbers related to each other and warp size? I assume that there are 192 cores per SMP, but that doesn't seem to be a factor of 1024. If each core runs a warp of 32 threads, I would expect 32 * 192 threads per SMP, or 2^5 * (2^7 + 2^6), or 4096 + 2048 = 6142. What piece of the puzzle am I missing here?"

        "content": "The relationship between the number of cores, Streaming Multiprocessors (SMPs), and the maximum thread count in an NVIDIA GPU can initially seem a bit complex, but it becomes clearer once you understand the architecture of NVIDIA's CUDA cores and the concept of warps.\n\n1. **CUDA Cores and SMPs**: \n   - Each Streaming Multiprocessor (SMP) is composed of a certain number of CUDA cores. In older architectures like the Kepler architecture (to which your GT 650M belongs), each SMP contains 192 CUDA cores.\n\n2. **Threads and Warps**:\n   - A warp is a group of 32 threads that are executed concurrently. This is a fundamental execution unit in NVIDIA's architecture.\n   - The maximum number of threads that can be active per SMP is determined by the architectural limits. For Kepler, this is often 2048 threads per SMP.\n\n3. **Thread Blocks and Maximum Thread Count**:\n   - While each SMP can have a maximum of 2048 threads resident at a time, these threads are grouped into blocks, which are further divided into warps for execution. \n   - The actual execution is handled in warps, and not all cores are utilized at the same time unless there is optimal occupancy.\n\n4. **Your GT 650M**:\n   - With 2 SMPs and 192 cores per SMP, you indeed get 384 cores in total.\n   - Each SMP can handle up to 2048 threads, but this is not directly tied to the number of cores because threads are scheduled in warps, and resource constraints like registers and shared memory can limit the number of active warps.\n   - The 1024 threads per SMP you mentioned might be a practical or configurational limit for your specific device model or setup, reflecting how many threads can be efficiently managed given the available resources.\n\nThe key point is that while the number of cores dictates the potential parallel execution capacity, the actual number of threads running concurrently is determined by how these threads are managed in warps and blocks, and is subject to resource constraints. If you were calculating 6142, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in how these values relate to warp execution specifically; the actual number is tied to the limits imposed by the architecture and not directly by multiplying core counts by warp sizes."
