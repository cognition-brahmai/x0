Let's say I have an array like this:\n\n```\n[\n[John,2],\n[Jim,9],\n[Jason,1]\n]\n```\n\nAnd I want to sort it to look like this:\n\n```\n[\n[Jason,1],\n[John,2],\n[Jim,9],\n]\n```\n\nWhat would be the best approach to do this? Additionally, I am running into an 'index out of range' error when I try to sort a two dimensional array with 1000 rows and 3 columns based on the third column. The code I am currently using is: \n\n``` sorted_list = sorted(list_not_sorted, key=lambda x:x[2]) ```\n\nIs this the correct way to sort based on the third column?"

        "content": "To sort a multidimensional array by a specific column, you can use the `sorted()` function in Python with a custom key. Your initial example of sorting the array by the second element in each sub-array is correct. Here's how you can do it for the given array:\n\n```python\narray = [\n    ['John', 2],\n    ['Jim', 9],\n    ['Jason', 1]\n]\n\n# Sort by the second element in each sub-array\nsorted_array = sorted(array, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\nprint(sorted_array)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[\n    ['Jason', 1],\n    ['John', 2],\n    ['Jim', 9]\n]\n```\n\nRegarding your issue with the 'index out of range' error when sorting a two-dimensional array with 1000 rows and 3 columns based on the third column, it seems that there might be some sub-arrays that do not have three elements. To avoid this error, you need to ensure that all sub-arrays have at least three elements before you attempt to sort them. You can do this by using a filter or adding a check in your key function. Here's how you can modify your sorting code to include this check:\n\n```python\n# Ensure all sub-arrays have at least three elements before sorting\nfiltered_list = [x for x in list_not_sorted if len(x) >= 3]\n\n# Sort by the third element in each sub-array\nsorted_list = sorted(filtered_list, key=lambda x: x[2])\n\nprint(sorted_list)\n```\n\nThis approach filters out any sub-arrays that have fewer than three elements, preventing the 'index out of range' error when accessing `x[2]`."
