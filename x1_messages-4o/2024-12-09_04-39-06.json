Each name in the file is separated by a newline. Here is my current implementation:\n\n```python\nnames_list = open(\"names\", \"r\").read().splitlines()\n```\n\nThe file format is as follows:\n\n```python\nAllman\nAtkinson\n\nBehlendorf \n```\n\nI want to ensure that any lines that contain only whitespace are ignored."

        "content": "To efficiently ignore blank lines or lines that contain only whitespace while reading a file in Python, you can use a list comprehension combined with the `strip()` method. This approach is both concise and Pythonic. Here's how you can modify your current implementation:\n\n```python\nwith open(\"names\", \"r\") as file:\n    names_list = [line.strip() for line in file if line.strip()]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`with open(\"names\", \"r\") as file:`**: This opens the file and ensures that it is properly closed after processing, even if an error occurs.\n- **`line.strip()`**: This method removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the line, including newline characters.\n- **`if line.strip()`**: This condition ensures that only non-empty lines (after stripping whitespace) are included in `names_list`.\n- **List Comprehension**: This creates a new list of names, filtering out any lines that are blank or contain only whitespace.\n\nThis method is efficient and easy to read, adhering to Python's philosophy of writing clear and concise code."
