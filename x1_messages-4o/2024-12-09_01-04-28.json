You can multiply a string by an integer to repeat the string that many times. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nprint('-' * 3)  # This will print '---'\n```\n\nIn this example, the `'-'` string is multiplied by `3`, resulting in the string `'---'`, which is then printed. This approach is simple and does not require a loop."
