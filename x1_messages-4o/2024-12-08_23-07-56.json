        "content": "In the given sentence, personification is employed by attributing human-like characteristics to inanimate objects, specifically the clocks. The striking of \"thirteen\" clocks suggests an unnatural or eerie alteration to the concept of time, emphasizing the control the dystopian government exerts over reality itself. This manipulation of time is further highlighted by the paradoxical description of a \"bright but frigid April day,\" combining elements that typically do not coexist. This personification not only brings the clocks to life but also underscores the tension and unnaturalness of the dystopian setting, where even time, a seemingly constant and neutral entity, has been commandeered by the oppressive regime. It serves to create an unsettling atmosphere, reflecting the pervasive control and distortion of normalcy experienced by the characters within this world."
