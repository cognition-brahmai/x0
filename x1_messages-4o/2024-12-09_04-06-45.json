I have an array 'b' and I want to copy its data into array 'a', but without modifying the address of array 'a'. This is because an external library (PyFFTW) uses a pointer to my array that cannot change. Currently, I am doing this with a loop as shown below:\n\n```python\na = numpy.empty(n, dtype=complex)\nfor i in xrange(a.size):\n  a[i] = b[i]\n```\nIs it possible to perform this operation without using a loop?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this without using an explicit loop by using NumPy's array slicing and assignment features, which are both efficient and fast. You can simply assign the contents of `b` to `a` using slicing, as shown below:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.empty(n, dtype=complex)\nb = np.array([...], dtype=complex)  # Ensure b is the same shape and dtype\n\n# Copy data from b to a without changing a's address\na[:] = b\n```\n\nThe `a[:] = b` operation copies the contents of `b` into `a` element-wise. This operation maintains the memory address of `a`, which should be compatible with your requirement regarding the external library's pointer. This method is vectorized and leverages NumPy's optimized routines, making it significantly faster than a Python loop."
