Post downloading the tutorial and running it on my computer, I encountered an error stating \"AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'feature_column'\". I have learned that this error can occur on older versions of tensorflow, however, I am currently using the latest version: 1.3.0. Could you explain why I am experiencing this problem and how I can resolve it?"

        "content": "It seems like there might be a misunderstanding regarding the versioning of TensorFlow. The tutorial you're following likely requires a more recent version of TensorFlow than 1.3.0. The module `tensorflow.feature_column` was introduced in TensorFlow 1.4.0. Therefore, using TensorFlow 1.3.0 would indeed cause this `AttributeError`.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should upgrade your TensorFlow installation to a version that supports the `feature_column` module. Here's how you can upgrade TensorFlow using pip:\n\n1. First, ensure that you're using a Python environment (like a virtual environment) to avoid conflicts with other projects.\n\n2. Upgrade TensorFlow to the latest stable version by running the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade tensorflow\n   ```\n\n   If you have a GPU and want to utilize it, you can install the GPU version:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu\n   ```\n\n3. After upgrading, verify the installation by checking the version:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   print(tf.__version__)\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that the version is 1.4.0 or higher.\n\nBy upgrading to a suitable version of TensorFlow, you should be able to run the tutorial without encountering the `AttributeError`. If you encounter any other issues, ensure that all dependencies are up to date and that your Python environment is correctly configured."
