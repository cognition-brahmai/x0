These tasks include reasoning, learning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, perception, and even exhibiting creativity. AI systems can be classified into two main types: narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks like speech recognition or image classification, and general AI, which aims to perform any intellectual task that a human can do. AI technologies include machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning, which enable computers to learn from and make decisions based on data."
