        "content": "You can use a combination of shell commands like `grep` and `wc` to count the number of times the hashtag `#SmallActionsMakeADifference` appears in a given text file. Here's a command that will help you achieve that:\n\n```bash\ngrep -o '#SmallActionsMakeADifference' yourfile.txt | wc -l\n```\n\nHere's what each part of the command does:\n\n- `grep -o '#SmallActionsMakeADifference' yourfile.txt`: The `grep` command searches for the specified pattern, which is the hashtag in this case, in the file `yourfile.txt`. The `-o` option tells `grep` to output only the matched parts of the line, each on a new line.\n\n- `|`: This pipe operator sends the output of the `grep` command as input to the next command.\n\n- `wc -l`: The `wc` (word count) command with the `-l` option counts the number of lines. Since each occurrence of the hashtag is output on a new line by `grep`, `wc -l` effectively counts the number of times the hashtag appears in the file.\n\nMake sure to replace `yourfile.txt` with the actual name of your text file."
