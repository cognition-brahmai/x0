I have tried using the more_itertools.windowed() function but it does not produce the desired output. For example, given the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and a window size of 3, I want to obtain the next three values in front and the previous three values behind each element. The more_itertools.windowed() function does not ignore the current value and doesn't work quite right for my requirements. Is there a way to do this effectively in python?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired sliding window both forward and backward for each element in the list, you can implement a custom function in Python. The idea is to iterate over each element and collect the previous and next `n` elements, excluding the current element itself. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef sliding_window_both_directions(lst, window_size):\n    result = []\n    n = len(lst)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        # Get previous elements\n        start = max(i - window_size, 0)\n        prev_elements = lst[start:i]\n\n        # Get next elements\n        end = min(i + window_size + 1, n)\n        next_elements = lst[i+1:end]\n        \n        # Combine previous and next elements\n        window = prev_elements + next_elements\n        result.append(window)\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nlst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nwindow_size = 3\nwindows = sliding_window_both_directions(lst, window_size)\n\nfor i, window in enumerate(windows):\n    print(f\"Element {lst[i]}: {window}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Previous Elements**: For each element, we calculate the starting index as `max(i - window_size, 0)` to ensure we don't go out of bounds on the lower side.\n- **Next Elements**: Similarly, the ending index is calculated as `min(i + window_size + 1, n)` to ensure we don't exceed the length of the list.\n- **Combining**: We combine the previous and next elements, and store them in a result list for each element.\n- This approach avoids including the current element in its own sliding window.\n\nThis custom solution should meet your requirements by providing a sliding window of values for each element in both forward and backward directions, excluding the element itself."
