I want to determine if any subclass has overridden a specific method in the super-class. Here is my current implementation:\n\n```python\nclass Super:\n   def __init__(self):\n      if self.method == Super.method:\n         print 'same'\n      else:\n         print 'different'\n     \n   @classmethod\n   def method(cls):\n      pass\n\nclass Sub1(Super):\n   def method(self):\n      print 'hi'\n  \nclass Sub2(Super):\n   pass\n\nSuper() # should be same\nSub1() # should be different\nSub2() # should be same\n\n>>> same\n>>> different\n>>> different\n```\n\nThis approach seems to work for `Sub1` but not for `Sub2`. Is there any way for a super-class to know if a sub-class has overridden a method?"

        "content": "In Python, you can detect if a subclass has overridden a method from the superclass by comparing the method reference of the subclass with that of the superclass. You can achieve this by leveraging the `type` function to access the class of the instance and compare its method with the superclass method.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your implementation to make it work as expected:\n\n```python\nclass Super:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Get the method from the class of the instance\n        instance_method = type(self).method\n        # Get the method from the superclass\n        superclass_method = Super.method\n        # Compare if they are the same\n        if instance_method == superclass_method:\n            print('same')\n        else:\n            print('different')\n     \n    def method(self):\n        pass\n\nclass Sub1(Super):\n    def method(self):\n        print('hi')\n  \nclass Sub2(Super):\n    pass\n\nSuper()  # should be same\nSub1()   # should be different\nSub2()   # should be same\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `type(self).method` retrieves the `method` from the class of the current instance (`self`). This reflects the actual method that will be executed when called on the instance.\n- `Super.method` retrieves the `method` from the superclass.\n- By comparing these two, you can determine if the subclass has overridden the method.\n\nThis should give you the desired output:\n```\nsame\ndifferent\nsame\n```"
