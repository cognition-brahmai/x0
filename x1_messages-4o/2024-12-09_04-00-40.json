I have a piece of code that works well in Python 2.7 using urllib2, which goes to an internet page that requires authorization and retrieves information from that page. However, I can't get my code to work in Python 3.4 because urllib2 doesn't exist and urllib works differently. I've tried various solutions from online sources but have not found a solution yet. Can anyone help me adjust my code to work with Python 3.4? This is the code I am currently using:\n\n```\nrequest = urllib2.Request('http://mysite/admin/index.cgi?index=127')\nbase64string = base64.encodestring('%s:%s' % ('login', 'password')).replace('\\n', '')\nrequest.add_header(\"Authorization\", \"Basic %s\" % base64string)\nresult = urllib2.urlopen(request)\nresulttext = result.read()\n```"

        "content": "Certainly! In Python 3, the `urllib2` module has been split across several modules in the `urllib` package. Here's how you can adjust your code to work with Python 3.4 using `urllib.request` and `base64`:\n\n```python\nimport urllib.request\nimport base64\n\n# Create a request object\nurl = 'http://mysite/admin/index.cgi?index=127'\nrequest = urllib.request.Request(url)\n\n# Encode the username and password\nusername = 'login'\npassword = 'password'\ncredentials = ('%s:%s' % (username, password)).encode('utf-8')\nbase64string = base64.b64encode(credentials).decode('utf-8')\n\n# Add the Authorization header\nrequest.add_header(\"Authorization\", \"Basic %s\" % base64string)\n\n# Open the URL and read the response\ntry:\n    with urllib.request.urlopen(request) as response:\n        resulttext = response.read()\n        print(resulttext.decode('utf-8'))\nexcept urllib.error.URLError as e:\n    print(e.reason)\n```\n\n### Key Adjustments:\n\n1. **Import Changes**: Use `urllib.request` instead of `urllib2`.\n\n2. **Base64 Encoding**: Use `base64.b64encode()` which returns a bytes object in Python 3, so you need to decode it to a string using `.decode('utf-8')`.\n\n3. **Request and Response Handling**: Use `urllib.request.Request` to create a request and `urllib.request.urlopen` to open the URL. The `urlopen` function returns a context manager, so it's recommended to use it with the `with` statement for cleaner resource management.\n\nThis code should work in Python 3.4 and help you access the webpage with basic HTTP authentication."
