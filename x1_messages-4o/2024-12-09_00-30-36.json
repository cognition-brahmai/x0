Why am I getting a KeyError when trying to access the 'Date' column?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the KeyError for the 'Date' column could be due to several reasons. Here are some possibilities and how you can address them:\n\n1. **Whitespace or Hidden Characters**: Sometimes, column names might have leading or trailing spaces, or other hidden characters. You can strip these characters to ensure you're accessing the column correctly.\n\n   ```python\n   df_ticks.columns = df_ticks.columns.str.strip()\n   df_ticks['Date']\n   ```\n\n2. **Encoding Issues**: If the CSV file has a specific encoding, it might cause unexpected characters to appear in column names. Try specifying the encoding when reading the CSV file.\n\n   ```python\n   df_ticks = pd.read_csv('values.csv', delimiter=',', encoding='utf-8')\n   ```\n\n3. **Differences in Capitalization or Spelling**: Double-check the exact spelling and capitalization of the column name in the CSV file. Ensure that it matches precisely what you're trying to access.\n\n4. **File Structure or Delimiters**: Ensure that the delimiter is correctly specified. If the file is not using a comma as the delimiter, adjust the `delimiter` parameter accordingly.\n\n5. **Print Column Names for Verification**: To investigate further, print the column names and verify their exact format.\n\n   ```python\n   print(list(df_ticks.columns))\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Duplicate Columns**: If there are duplicate column names, pandas might rename them with a suffix like '.1', causing issues when accessing columns by their original names.\n\n   If none of these solutions work, it's worth examining the CSV file directly, perhaps in a text editor, to confirm the column names and structure."
