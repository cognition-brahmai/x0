When I run \"python manage.py migrate\", this is what I get:\n\n```\nOperations to perform:\n  Synchronize unmigrated apps: myapp\n  Apply all migrations: admin, contenttypes, auth, sessions\nSynchronizing apps without migrations:\n  Creating tables...\n  Installing custom SQL...\n  Installing indexes...\nRunning migrations:\n  No migrations to apply.\n```\n\nEven when I make changes to any models in 'myapp', it still says unmigrated as expected. But when I run \"python manage.py makemigrations myapp\", I get \"No changes detected in app 'myapp'\". It doesn't seem to matter what or how I run the command, it's never detecting the app as having changes, nor is it adding any migration files to the app. Is there any way to force an app onto migrations and essentially say \"This is my base to work with\" or am I missing something? I am using a PostgreSQL database."

        "content": "The issue you're facing with Django 1.7 not detecting changes in your \"myapp\" could stem from a few different factors. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check App Configuration:**\n   - Ensure that your app is listed in the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting within your `settings.py` file. This is crucial for Django to recognize and manage migrations for your app.\n\n2. **Ensure Models are Defined Correctly:**\n   - Make sure that your models are properly defined in the `models.py` file of your app. Django needs to recognize them to create migrations.\n\n3. **Verify App Label and Meta Class:**\n   - Double-check that your models don't have any unusual `Meta` options that might affect migrations.\n   - Ensure there isn't a custom app label set in your `apps.py` that might be misconfigured.\n\n4. **Initial Migration Creation:**\n   - If `makemigrations` isn't detecting changes because it doesn't recognize an initial migration, you can try creating an initial migration manually:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py makemigrations --empty myapp\n     ```\n   - This will create a base migration file where you can manually define the schema as seen in your current database state.\n\n5. **Delete Migration History (Use with Caution):**\n   - If there's a migration history conflict, you might need to remove migration files and database migration history. Be careful with this, especially in production environments:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py migrate myapp zero\n     ```\n   - Then delete the existing migration files in `myapp/migrations/` directory, except for `__init__.py`.\n\n6. **Database Introspection:**\n   - Make sure your database schema is in sync with your model fields. Sometimes manual changes to the database can cause issues.\n   - You can use Django's `inspectdb` command to generate models from your existing database and compare them with your current models.\n\n7. **Check for Model Import Errors:**\n   - Ensure there are no import errors in your `models.py` file. Run:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py shell\n     ```\n   - Then try importing your models manually to see if any errors occur.\n\n8. **Debugging:**\n   - Use the `--verbosity` flag to get more information while running `makemigrations`:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py makemigrations myapp --verbosity 2\n     ```\n\n9. **Update Django:**\n   - If possible, consider updating Django to a more recent version. Django 1.7 is quite outdated, and there may be bug fixes in newer versions that address this issue.\n\nAfter trying these steps, you should be able to force Django to recognize your app's migrations correctly. If you continue to face issues, consider seeking help from the Django community or reviewing the Django documentation for migration troubleshooting."
