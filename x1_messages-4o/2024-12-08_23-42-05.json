        "content": "To generate a sentence that completes a given sentence using the word \"exploding,\" you can follow the example you provided, which uses the `fmt.Sprintf` function to format and concatenate strings in Go. Below is a detailed explanation and a slightly more flexible code example that allows you to pass different sentences and words as arguments:\n\n### Step-by-step Explanation:\n\n1. **Import the Package**: Import the `fmt` package, which provides I/O formatting functions.\n\n2. **Define Variables**: Define the `sentence` and `word` variables. The `sentence` variable will hold the initial part of the sentence, and the `word` variable will hold the word you want to add.\n\n3. **Concatenate Strings**: Use `fmt.Sprintf` to concatenate the sentence and the word. This function allows you to format strings using a format specifier, where `%s` is used to insert strings.\n\n4. **Print the Result**: Use `fmt.Println` to print the completed sentence.\n\n### Flexible Code Example:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\n// Function to complete the sentence with the given word\nfunc completeSentence(sentence, word string) string {\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s %s.\", sentence, word)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    // Example usage\n    originalSentence := \"He ran through the streets, his chest\"\n    wordToAdd := \"exploding\"\n    \n    completedSentence := completeSentence(originalSentence, wordToAdd)\n    fmt.Println(completedSentence)\n}\n```\n\n### How to Use the Code:\n- **Modify `originalSentence`**: Change the value of `originalSentence` to any sentence fragment you wish to complete.\n- **Change `wordToAdd`**: Assign any word you want to append to the sentence.\n\nThis code is modular, allowing you to use the `completeSentence` function to concatenate any sentence and word you choose. This approach is useful if you need to generate multiple sentences or handle user input, as it separates the logic of sentence completion into a reusable function."
