        "content": "To convert the singular noun \"tooth\" into its plural form \"teeth\" in Swift, you can follow a similar approach as in Ruby, but you'll need to manually handle the irregular pluralization since Swift doesn't have built-in pluralization support like Rails in Ruby. Here's how you can do it in Swift:\n\n```swift\nfunc pluralize(noun: String) -> String {\n    switch noun {\n    case \"tooth\":\n        return \"teeth\"\n    default:\n        return noun + \"s\"\n    }\n}\n\nlet singular = \"tooth\"\nlet plural = pluralize(noun: singular)\nprint(plural) // Output: teeth\n```\n\nIn this Swift code, we define a function `pluralize` that checks if the noun is \"tooth\". If it is, it returns \"teeth\". Otherwise, it appends an \"s\" to form the plural. When you call this function with the noun \"tooth\", it will output \"teeth\"."
