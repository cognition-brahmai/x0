However, I'm encountering an issue where my code prints out three extra characters \"\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf\" at the start. Here's the code I'm using:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    data=open('info.txt')\n    for each_line in data:\n        try:\n            (role,line_spoken)=each_line.split(':',1)\n            print(role,end='')\n            print(' said: ',end='')\n            print(line_spoken,end='')\n        except ValueError:\n            print(each_line)\n    data.close()\nexcept IOError:\n     print(\"File is missing\")\n```\n\nWhen I run this, it prints out:\n\n```python\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfMan said:  Is this the right room for an argument?\nOther Man said:  I've told you once.\nMan said:  No you haven't!\nOther Man said:  Yes I have.\n```\n\nBut I expect it to print:\n\n```python\nMan said:  Is this the right room for an argument?\nOther Man said:  I've told you once.\nMan said:  No you haven't!\nOther Man said:  Yes I have.\n```\n\nWhy are these extra characters being printed, and how can I correct this?"

        "content": "The extra characters \"\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf\" you're encountering at the start of your output are indicative of a Byte Order Mark (BOM) in your text file. The BOM is a Unicode character used to signal the endianness (byte order) of a text file or stream. It is commonly found at the beginning of text files saved in UTF-8 format with a BOM.\n\nTo handle this, you can open the file with the appropriate encoding that ignores the BOM. In Python, you can use the `utf-8-sig` encoding, which automatically skips the BOM if it is present. Here's how you can modify your code to handle the BOM:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Open the file with 'utf-8-sig' encoding to handle the BOM\n    with open('info.txt', encoding='utf-8-sig') as data:\n        for each_line in data:\n            try:\n                role, line_spoken = each_line.split(':', 1)\n                print(role, end='')\n                print(' said: ', end='')\n                print(line_spoken, end='')\n            except ValueError:\n                print(each_line)\nexcept IOError:\n    print(\"File is missing\")\n```\n\nA few additional improvements have been made:\n\n- I've used a `with` statement for opening the file, which ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.\n- I've removed the redundant parentheses in the tuple unpacking for clarity.\n\nWith this change, your code should correctly handle and ignore the BOM, resulting in the expected output."
