I want to be able to provide the input either from the first parameter or from stdin, allowing for usage patterns such as:\n\n```bash\nts2date 1267619929\n```\nand\n```bash\necho 1267619929 | ts2date\n```\nBoth commands should output \"Wed Mar 3 13:38:49 2010\"."

        "content": "You can create a Bash script called `ts2date` to achieve this functionality. The script will check if an argument is provided; if not, it will read from standard input. Then, it will use the `date` command to convert the Unix timestamp to a human-readable date format. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n1. Create a new file named `ts2date` and open it in a text editor.\n\n2. Add the following script to the file:\n\n   ```bash\n   #!/bin/bash\n\n   # Check if the first argument is provided, otherwise read from stdin\n   if [ -n \"$1\" ]; then\n       timestamp=\"$1\"\n   else\n       read timestamp\n   fi\n\n   # Convert the timestamp to a human-readable date\n   date -d @\"$timestamp\" +\"%a %b %d %T %Y\"\n   ```\n\n3. Save the file and exit the editor.\n\n4. Make the script executable by running the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x ts2date\n   ```\n\n5. Now you can use the `ts2date` script in your terminal as follows:\n\n   - Provide the timestamp as an argument:\n\n     ```bash\n     ./ts2date 1267619929\n     ```\n\n   - Use it with a timestamp from standard input:\n\n     ```bash\n     echo 1267619929 | ./ts2date\n     ```\n\nBoth commands should correctly output `Wed Mar 3 13:38:49 2010`."
