        "content": "To resolve the issue you're facing with installing `psycopg2` and its dependencies on Alpine Linux, you need to make sure that you're installing the correct packages. The naming of packages in Alpine Linux can differ slightly from other distributions. Specifically, you need to install the `postgresql-dev` package instead of `libpq-dev`, and for Python, you should use `python2-dev` for Python 2.7. Also, ensure you have `gcc` and `musl-dev` for compiling the C extensions.\n\nHere's an updated version of your Dockerfile:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM python:2.7-alpine\n\n# Install build dependencies\nRUN apk update && \\\n    apk add --no-cache \\\n    gcc \\\n    musl-dev \\\n    postgresql-dev \\\n    python2-dev\n\n# Install psycopg2\nRUN pip install psycopg2\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Update Package Index**: `apk update` updates the package index to ensure you are installing the latest versions.\n\n2. **Install Required Packages**:\n   - `gcc` and `musl-dev`: These are needed to compile C extensions.\n   - `postgresql-dev`: This replaces `libpq-dev` and provides the necessary headers and libraries for PostgreSQL.\n   - `python2-dev`: This replaces `python-dev` for Python 2.7 on Alpine.\n\n3. **No Cache**: The `--no-cache` option prevents storing the index locally, which saves space.\n\nTry building your Docker image again with this updated Dockerfile, and it should resolve the dependency issues."
