Currently, I am trying to list all the files under the directory 'C:\\Users\\akrio\\Desktop\\Test'. However, my function is returning a nested list instead of a single list. Here's my code for reference:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\ndef searching_all_files(directory: Path):   \n    file_list = [] # A list for storing files existing in directories\n\n    for x in directory.iterdir():\n        if x.is_file():\n           file_list.append(x)\n        else:\n           file_list.append(searching_all_files(directory/x))\n\n    return file_list\n\n\np = Path('C:\\\\Users\\\\akrio\\\\Desktop\\\\Test')\n\nprint(searching_all_files(p))\n```\n\nI expect to have a list containing the following paths:\n\n- `c:\\desktop\\test\\A\\A.txt`\n- `c:\\desktop\\test\\B\\B_1\\B.txt`\n- `c:\\desktop\\test\\123.txt`\n\nCan anyone help me correct my code?"

        "content": "The issue with your current implementation is that when you recursively call `searching_all_files`, it returns a list, which you then append to `file_list`, resulting in a nested list structure. To resolve this, you should extend the `file_list` with the results of the recursive call rather than appending them. Here's the corrected version of your function:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\ndef searching_all_files(directory: Path):\n    file_list = []  # A list for storing files existing in directories\n\n    for x in directory.iterdir():\n        if x.is_file():\n            file_list.append(x)\n        elif x.is_dir():\n            file_list.extend(searching_all_files(x))  # Extend the list with files from subdirectories\n\n    return file_list\n\n# Specify the directory path\np = Path('C:\\\\Users\\\\akrio\\\\Desktop\\\\Test')\n\n# Print the list of all files\nprint(searching_all_files(p))\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Use `extend` instead of `append`:** This will add the list of files from the recursive call into the current list, rather than adding the list itself as an element.\n2. **Correct directory handling:** Ensure the recursive call uses `x` directly because `x` already represents the subdirectory.\n\nThis should provide you with a flat list of all files in the specified directory and its subdirectories."
