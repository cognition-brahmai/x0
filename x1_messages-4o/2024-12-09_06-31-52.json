I am aware of tuple unpacking but this type of assignment is causing me some confusion, especially when the RHS is mutable. I am having difficulty finding the right keywords to search for this in the Python documentation."

        "content": "In Python, the type of assignment you are referring to is known as \"chained assignment.\" This occurs when you use multiple equals signs on a single line to assign the same value to multiple variables. For example, in the expression `a = b = True`, both `a` and `b` are assigned the value `True`.\n\nChained assignment works by evaluating the expression on the right-hand side and then assigning that single result to each of the variables on the left-hand side. It's important to be cautious when using chained assignment with mutable objects like lists or dictionaries. This is because all the variables will reference the same mutable object, meaning changes to the object through one variable will affect all other variables pointing to that object.\n\nHere's a short example illustrating this with a mutable object:\n\n```python\nx = y = []\nx.append(1)\nprint(x)  # Output: [1]\nprint(y)  # Output: [1]\n```\n\nIn this example, `x` and `y` both reference the same list object. When you append `1` to the list using `x`, it is also reflected in `y`, because they are two references to the same object.\n\nTo find more information about this, you might look for terms like \"chained assignment\" or \"multiple assignment\" in Python documentation or resources."
