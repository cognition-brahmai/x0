Specifically, when the `state` goes from `Setup` to `Active`, I want to create Units and populate the `started` field with the current datetime. I suspect that I might need a model instance method but I am not sure how to proceed. I've tried adding an initialization method and a save method to the `Game` class as shown below. Can you help me with this?\n\nHere is the code for my `Game` model:\n\n```python\nclass Game(models.Model):\n    STATE_CHOICES = (\n        ('S', 'Setup'),\n        ('A', 'Active'),\n        ('P', 'Paused'),\n        ('F', 'Finished')\n    )\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    owner = models.ForeignKey(User)\n    created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\n    started = models.DateTimeField(null=True)\n    state = models.CharField(max_length=1, choices=STATE_CHOICES, default='S')\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super(Game, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        self.old_state = self.state\n\n    def save(self, force_insert=False, force_update=False):\n        if self.old_state == 'S' and self.state == 'A':\n            self.started = datetime.datetime.now()\n        super(Game, self).save(force_insert, force_update)\n        self.old_state = self.state\n```"

        "content": "To achieve the desired functionality where actions are triggered when the `state` field changes from `Setup` to `Active`, you can modify your `Game` model as follows:\n\n1. **Use `__init__` to Track Old State**: Keep the logic to track the old state in the `__init__` method.\n2. **Override the `save` Method**: In the `save` method, check for the state transition condition and perform your actions.\n3. **Ensure Proper Handling of Positional and Keyword Arguments in `save`**: Use `*args` and `**kwargs` to ensure compatibility with Django's `save` method signature.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\nfrom django.utils import timezone\n\nclass Game(models.Model):\n    STATE_CHOICES = (\n        ('S', 'Setup'),\n        ('A', 'Active'),\n        ('P', 'Paused'),\n        ('F', 'Finished')\n    )\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    owner = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\n    started = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)\n    state = models.CharField(max_length=1, choices=STATE_CHOICES, default='S')\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super(Game, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        self._old_state = self.state\n\n    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Check if the state is transitioning from 'Setup' to 'Active'\n        if self._old_state == 'S' and self.state == 'A':\n            self.started = timezone.now()  # Use Django's timezone to ensure timezone awareness\n            self.create_units()  # Call a method to create units\n\n        # Save the current state to the old state variable\n        super(Game, self).save(*args, **kwargs)\n        self._old_state = self.state\n\n    def create_units(self):\n        # Logic to create units goes here\n        print(\"Units created\")  # Replace this with actual unit creation logic\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Tracking Old State**: The `_old_state` attribute is initialized in the `__init__` method to keep track of the previous state.\n- **Using `timezone.now()`**: This ensures that your application handles time zones correctly.\n- **Creating Units**: The `create_units` method is a placeholder for your logic to create units. Replace the print statement with the actual logic needed to create units.\n\n### Additional Suggestions:\n\n- Make sure your `create_units` method has the necessary logic to create units associated with the `Game` instance.\n- Ensure that you handle any database transactions appropriately if creating units involves complex operations.\n- Consider adding error handling within the `save` method to manage any potential issues during the transition.\n\nThis setup should help you achieve the desired behavior when the `state` changes from `Setup` to `Active`."
