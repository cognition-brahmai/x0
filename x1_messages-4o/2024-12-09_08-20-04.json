However, I am having difficulty understanding how to do this. Can someone provide an example or resource that demonstrates how to implement `__iter__(self)` for a container object? Specifically, my container is a map that stores values by unique keys, similar to a dictionary. I need to iterate through it in a way similar to how you would do it for a dictionary: `for k, v in mydict.items()`. I need my iterator to be able to return two elements, possibly as a tuple. Can someone help clarify how I can implement such an iterator for a map-like custom class?"

        "content": "Certainly! To implement an iterator for a custom container in Python that behaves like a dictionary, you'll want to define the `__iter__()` method and possibly also the `items()` method to allow iterating over key-value pairs, similar to how you would with a dictionary.\n\nHere's a step-by-step example of how you can implement this in your custom container class:\n\n```python\nclass CustomMap:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._data = {}  # Internal dictionary to store key-value pairs\n\n    def __setitem__(self, key, value):\n        self._data[key] = value\n\n    def __getitem__(self, key):\n        return self._data[key]\n\n    def __iter__(self):\n        # This will allow iteration over keys, similar to a dictionary\n        return iter(self._data)\n\n    def items(self):\n        # This will allow iteration over key-value pairs\n        for key, value in self._data.items():\n            yield (key, value)\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_map = CustomMap()\nmy_map['a'] = 1\nmy_map['b'] = 2\nmy_map['c'] = 3\n\n# Iterating over keys\nfor key in my_map:\n    print(key)\n\n# Iterating over key-value pairs\nfor key, value in my_map.items():\n    print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Internal Storage**: The `CustomMap` class uses a dictionary (`self._data`) to store key-value pairs internally. This takes advantage of Python's built-in dictionary functionality for storage.\n\n2. **`__setitem__` and `__getitem__`**: These methods allow you to set and get items using the bracket notation, similar to a dictionary (`my_map['key']`).\n\n3. **`__iter__` Method**: This method returns an iterator over the keys of the dictionary, which allows you to use `for key in my_map:` syntax.\n\n4. **`items()` Method**: This method is a generator function that yields key-value pairs as tuples, similar to the `items()` method of a dictionary. This allows you to iterate over the container using `for k, v in my_map.items():`.\n\nWith this setup, your `CustomMap` class will behave much like a standard Python dictionary when it comes to iteration."
