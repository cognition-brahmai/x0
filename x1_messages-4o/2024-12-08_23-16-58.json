In this case, \"We shall overcome\" and \"oh yes, we shall overcome\" are both independent clauses.\n\n2. **Comma**: Used after \"oh yes\" to set off the interjection, providing a natural pause in the sentence.\n\nIf you were to follow the Associated Press Stylebook, the punctuation would be similar, as both guides would prioritize clarity in this case:\n\n\"We shall overcome; oh yes, we shall overcome.\"\n\nBoth style guides agree on using a semi-colon between closely related independent clauses and a comma after the interjection."
