For instance, I have this code:\n\n<pre><code>def aa():\n    print aa.__name__\n    print aa.__hash__\n    # other similar\n</code></pre>\n\nIf I wanted to use 'aa()' as a template for other functions like 'bb()', I would have to write:\n\n<pre><code>def bb():\n    print bb.__name__\n    print bb.__hash__\n    # other similar\n</code></pre>\n\nI'm hoping to find a solution similar to the following:\n\n<pre><code>def whatever():\n    print self.__name__\n    print self.__hash__\n    # other similar\n</code></pre>\n\nHowever, I've heard using a class to solve this problem could be troublesome as it requires redefining all existing functions. Are there any suggestions or alternatives?"

        "content": "In Python, functions do not have a built-in mechanism like `self` in class methods to reference themselves generically. However, you can achieve a similar effect by using decorators or closures. Here's an approach using a decorator to achieve what you're looking for:\n\n### Using a Decorator\n\nYou can create a decorator that provides the function with a reference to itself:\n\n```python\ndef self_reference_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        print(func.__name__)\n        print(func.__hash__)\n        # Call the original function with self-reference\n        return func(func, *args, **kwargs)\n    return wrapper\n\n@self_reference_decorator\ndef aa(self):\n    # Now you can access the function itself with 'self'\n    print(self.__name__)\n\n@self_reference_decorator\ndef bb(self):\n    # Access the function itself with 'self'\n    print(self.__name__)\n\naa()\nbb()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Decorator**: The `self_reference_decorator` takes a function `func` and returns a `wrapper` function.\n- **Wrapper Function**: The `wrapper` function prints the desired attributes and calls the original function with `func` (acting as `self`) passed as the first argument.\n- **Function Definition**: Each function decorated with `@self_reference_decorator` receives itself as the first argument, allowing it to access its attributes like `__name__` or `__hash__`.\n\nThis way, you can write generic functions without manually repeating the function name each time. You can apply this decorator to any function you want to have this self-referencing capability."
