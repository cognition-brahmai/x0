I trained a model to classify images from 2 classes and saved it using `model.save()`. The model trained successfully with an accuracy of 0.98. I used the following code to load and test this model on new images. However, when I try to predict the class of a new image, the output is `[[0]]`. Why wouldn't it give out the actual name of the class and why `[[0]]`?"

        "content": "When you predict the class of an input image using a trained model in Keras, you typically get a numerical output, such as `[[0]]`, which corresponds to the class index. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to interpret this output and modify your code to get the actual class name:\n\n1. **Loading the Model**: First, ensure you are loading the model correctly. You can use `keras.models.load_model()` to load your saved model.\n\n2. **Preprocessing the Image**: Before making predictions, the image needs to be preprocessed in the same way as the training data. This usually involves resizing, scaling, and possibly other transformations. For example:\n\n    ```python\n    from keras.preprocessing import image\n    import numpy as np\n\n    img_path = 'path_to_your_image.jpg'\n    img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(img_height, img_width))  # Use the same size as during training\n    img_array = image.img_to_array(img)\n    img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)  # Add batch dimension\n    img_array /= 255.0  # Scale pixel values to [0, 1] if you did this during training\n    ```\n\n3. **Making Predictions**: Use the `predict()` method to get the model's predictions.\n\n    ```python\n    predictions = model.predict(img_array)\n    ```\n\n   If your model has a single output neuron with a sigmoid activation function (common in binary classification), `predictions` will be a single value between 0 and 1. You can threshold this value to determine the class.\n\n4. **Interpreting the Predictions**: If you\u2019re getting `[[0]]`, it probably means the predicted class index is 0. To map this to a class name, you need to have a dictionary or list of class names.\n\n    ```python\n    class_names = ['class1', 'class2']  # Replace with your actual class names\n    predicted_class_index = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)[0]\n    predicted_class_name = class_names[predicted_class_index]\n    print('Predicted class:', predicted_class_name)\n    ```\n\n   For binary classification with a single output neuron, you might do:\n\n    ```python\n    if predictions[0] > 0.5:\n        predicted_class_name = class_names[1]\n    else:\n        predicted_class_name = class_names[0]\n    print('Predicted class:', predicted_class_name)\n    ```\n\n5. **Ensure Proper Mapping**: Make sure your `class_names` list is in the same order as the indices used during training.\n\nOnce you've set up your code following these steps, your prediction output should correspond to the actual class names rather than numerical indices."
