As per my requirements, the order of parameters matters. If A: (1, 0) and B: (1, -1), then calling angle_clockwise(A, B) should return 45 and angle_clockwise(B, A) should return 315. The algorithm should work as follows:\n\n1. Draw a line (line 1) between the first point parameter and the origin (0, 0).\n2. Draw a line (line 2) between the second point parameter and the origin (0, 0).\n3. Revolve line 1 around the origin (0, 0) clockwise until it overlaps line 2.\n4. The angular distance line 1 traveled will be the returned angle."

        "content": "To solve this problem in Python, you can use the `math` module to calculate the angles of the two vectors (from the origin to each point) with respect to the positive x-axis. Then, compute the clockwise angle difference between the two points. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide and code to achieve this:\n\n1. Calculate the angle of each point with respect to the positive x-axis using the `atan2` function, which gives the angle in radians.\n2. Convert the radians to degrees.\n3. Compute the difference between the two angles.\n4. Adjust the difference to ensure it represents a clockwise rotation.\n\nHere's a Python function implementing the above logic:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef angle_clockwise(A, B):\n    # Calculate the angle of the vector A with the x-axis\n    angle_a = math.degrees(math.atan2(A[1], A[0]))\n    # Calculate the angle of the vector B with the x-axis\n    angle_b = math.degrees(math.atan2(B[1], B[0]))\n    \n    # Calculate the clockwise angle difference\n    clockwise_angle = (angle_b - angle_a) % 360\n    \n    # If the angle is negative, convert it to a positive clockwise angle\n    if clockwise_angle < 0:\n        clockwise_angle += 360\n        \n    return clockwise_angle\n\n# Test cases\nA = (1, 0)\nB = (1, -1)\n\nprint(angle_clockwise(A, B))  # Output should be 45\nprint(angle_clockwise(B, A))  # Output should be 315\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `math.atan2(y, x)` calculates the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x, y)`.\n- `math.degrees()` converts the angle from radians to degrees.\n- The modulo operation `% 360` ensures the angle is within the range of 0 to 360 degrees.\n- If the calculated angle is negative, adding 360 degrees ensures it represents a clockwise movement.\n\nThis function should work for any two points, considering the order of the points, and correctly calculates the clockwise angle between them relative to the origin."
