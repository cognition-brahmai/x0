I am running the genfromtxt function using the following code:\n\n```python\ndate_conv = lambda x: str(x).replace(\":\", \"/\")\ntime_conv = lambda x: str(x)\n\na = np.genfromtxt(input.txt, delimiter=',', skip_header=4,\n      usecols=[0, 1] + radii_indices, converters={0: date_conv, 1: time_conv})\n```\n\nThe input.txt file is obtained from this gist. When I check the shape of array 'a' using `np.shape(a)`, it returns a shape of `(918,)` indicating that it is a 1D array. Additionally, when I check the first element of array 'a' using `a[0]`, it returns a tuple. However, when I remove the converters specification from the genfromtxt function, it produces a 2D array with shape `(918, 24)`."

        "content": "When using `numpy.genfromtxt` with the `converters` parameter, it can lead to a 1D array of tuples instead of a 2D array because of how the conversion process interacts with the data structure.\n\nHere's what's happening in your case:\n\n1. **Converters Handling**: When you specify converters, `genfromtxt` applies these functions to the specified columns. The converters are expected to return a single value, which is then used to construct the tuple for each row. If the converters are returning a string or any single value, `genfromtxt` will collect these into a tuple for each row.\n\n2. **Tuple Formation**: If the converters return a single value for each column, the output is treated as a tuple for each row. This results in a 1D array of tuples because each row is essentially being packed into a single tuple, rather than being extended into separate columns.\n\n3. **Default Behavior**: Without converters, `genfromtxt` directly reads the values and places them into a 2D array since it doesn't need to perform any transformation that would convert them into a different structure.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo ensure that you get a 2D array, you need to make sure that each converter returns a consistent structure that aligns with the number of columns you expect. Here's a potential modification to your converters:\n\n```python\ndate_conv = lambda x: str(x).replace(\":\", \"/\")\ntime_conv = lambda x: str(x)\n\n# Assuming radii_indices is a list of column indices that you want to convert\ndef custom_converter(x):\n    # Convert x and return a tuple or list with the same number of elements\n    return (date_conv(x[0]), time_conv(x[1])) + tuple(float(x[i]) for i in radii_indices)\n\na = np.genfromtxt('input.txt', delimiter=',', skip_header=4,\n                  converters={i: custom_converter for i in [0, 1]},\n                  usecols=[0, 1] + radii_indices)\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Ensure Correct Return Type**: Make sure each converter returns a value that matches the intended data type and structure for the output array.\n- **Debugging**: You can print the output from your converters for a single line to ensure they're functioning as expected before using them in `genfromtxt`.\n- **Check Data**: Ensure that the input data aligns with the expectations of your converters, especially regarding delimiters and data consistency.\n\nBy addressing the structure returned by your converters, you should be able to maintain the 2D structure of the array."
