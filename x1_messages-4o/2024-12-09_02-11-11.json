        "content": "It seems like you're encountering an import error related to the URL configuration in your Django project. Let's go through a few steps to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check the `urls.py` Location:**\n   Ensure that your `urls.py` file is indeed located in the `polls` directory under `mysite`. The correct path should be `mysite/polls/urls.py`.\n\n2. **Correct Import Statements:**\n   Make sure that your import statements are correct. Since `django.conf.urls.defaults` is deprecated, you should update your import statements. Here's how you can modify your `urls.py` files:\n\n   In `mysite/urls.py`:\n   ```python\n   from django.conf.urls import include, url\n   from django.contrib import admin\n   admin.autodiscover()\n\n   urlpatterns = [\n       url(r'^polls/', include('polls.urls')),\n       url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),\n   ]\n   ```\n\n   In `mysite/polls/urls.py`:\n   ```python\n   from django.conf.urls import url\n   from . import views\n\n   urlpatterns = [\n       url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),\n       url(r'^(?P<poll_id>\\d+)/$', views.detail, name='detail'),\n       url(r'^(?P<poll_id>\\d+)/results/$', views.results, name='results'),\n       url(r'^(?P<poll_id>\\d+)/vote/$', views.vote, name='vote'),\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure `views.py` Exists:**\n   Make sure that your `mysite/polls` directory has a `views.py` file containing the `index`, `detail`, `results`, and `vote` view functions.\n\n4. **Check for `__init__.py` Files:**\n   Ensure that your `polls` directory has an `__init__.py` file. This file can be empty but must be present for Python to recognize the directory as a package.\n\n5. **Update Django Version:**\n   If you are using a version of Django that is 1.10 or newer, make sure to use `from django.conf.urls import url` instead of `from django.conf.urls.defaults import *`.\n\nAfter making these changes, try running your Django project again. If you still encounter issues, double-check the paths and ensure that your project structure is correctly set up."
