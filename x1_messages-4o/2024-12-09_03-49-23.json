This error arises when I'm trying to use the POSTMAN tool to post \"access\" and \"req\" data. I thought this error might be due to a file size limitation, so I added `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE = 100000000` to my settings.py file, but the error persists. I have also referred to this stack overflow question: \"How to avoid 'The number of GET/POST parameters exceeded' error?\", but I haven't found a solution. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the number of form fields being submitted in your request, rather than the size of the data. Django's `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FIELDS` setting controls the maximum number of fields allowed in a single request to help prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to increase the value of `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FIELDS` in your `settings.py` file. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Open your `settings.py` file.\n2. Add or update the `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FIELDS` setting to a higher value. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FIELDS = 10000  # You can adjust this value as needed\n   ```\n\n3. Save the changes and restart your Django server for the changes to take effect.\n\nMake sure to choose a sensible value for `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FIELDS` based on your application's needs. Setting it too high could expose your application to certain types of attacks, so it's important to strike a balance between functionality and security.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, double-check that your request actually requires the number of fields being sent, as there might be an underlying issue causing an excessive number of parameters to be generated."
