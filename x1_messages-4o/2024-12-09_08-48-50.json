        "content": "Creating a recursive function in Python to print values from 0 to `n` can be done by having the function call itself with an incremented value until the desired number is reached. Here's a step-by-step guide and example code:\n\n1. **Define the Base Case:** The base case is the condition under which the recursion stops. In this scenario, it will stop when the current number exceeds `n`.\n\n2. **Recursive Case:** If the current number is less than or equal to `n`, print the current number and then call the function recursively with an incremented value.\n\nHere is an example implementation of such a recursive function:\n\n```python\ndef print_numbers(current, n):\n    # Base case: When current exceeds n, stop the recursion\n    if current > n:\n        return\n    # Print the current number\n    print(current)\n    # Recursive call with the next number\n    print_numbers(current + 1, n)\n\n# Function call to print numbers from 0 to n\nn = 10  # You can change this value to any non-negative integer\nprint_numbers(0, n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Base Case:** `if current > n:` stops the recursion once the current value exceeds `n`.\n- **Recursive Step:** `print_numbers(current + 1, n)` calls the function again with `current` incremented by 1.\n- **Function Call:** Initially call the function with `current` set to 0 to start the sequence.\n\nThis code will print numbers from 0 up to `n`, inclusive, using recursion. You can change the value of `n` to any non-negative integer to modify the range."
