I realized that 'input_data' is not built-in, so I downloaded the complete folder from TensorFlow's repository. However, I am not sure how to begin the tutorial. Should I change my working directory to the downloaded folder or add this to my 'tensorflow' directory? If I am to add the files, where should I add them? I installed 'tensorflow' with 'pip' on my OSX and the current location is '~/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/__init__.py'. Are these files meant to be accessed directly through 'tensorflow' like 'sklearn' datasets? Or am I supposed to cd into the directory and work from there? The example is not clear. Here is the code and the error:\n\n```python\nimport input_data\nmnist = input_data.read_data_sets(\"MNIST_data/\", one_hot=True)\n\nImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-6-a5af65173c89> in <module>()\n----> 1 import input_data\n      2 mnist = tf.input_data.read_data_sets(\"MNIST_data/\", one_hot=True)\n\nImportError: No module named input_data\n```"

        "content": "The `input_data` module you're referring to is not a built-in part of TensorFlow; it's a utility script that used to be included in some older tutorials to help with loading the MNIST dataset. However, this script is not part of the TensorFlow library when you install it via `pip`.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue and work with the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow:\n\n1. **Using TensorFlow Datasets:**\n\n   TensorFlow now provides an efficient way to load datasets, including MNIST, through the `tensorflow_datasets` library. You can install it with:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install tensorflow-datasets\n   ```\n\n   And then modify your code to use `tensorflow_datasets`:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   import tensorflow_datasets as tfds\n\n   # Load MNIST dataset\n   mnist_data, mnist_info = tfds.load('mnist', with_info=True, as_supervised=True)\n\n   train_data, test_data = mnist_data['train'], mnist_data['test']\n\n   # Example: Access one batch of train data\n   for image, label in train_data.take(1):\n       print(image, label)\n   ```\n\n2. **Using Keras Datasets:**\n\n   Another way to access the MNIST dataset is through the Keras API, which is integrated within TensorFlow:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n\n   # Load MNIST dataset\n   mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist\n\n   (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()\n\n   # Normalize the input data\n   x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0\n\n   # Example: Access the first training image and label\n   print(x_train[0], y_train[0])\n   ```\n\n3. **Using the Old `input_data.py` Script (Not Recommended):**\n\n   If you want to use the old `input_data.py` script, you should place the `input_data.py` file in the same directory as your script, or ensure it's in your Python path. However, this approach is outdated, and it is recommended to use one of the above methods.\n\nBy using `tensorflow_datasets` or the Keras API, you can avoid the hassle of managing separate files and ensure you are using a more modern and efficient approach to loading datasets in TensorFlow."
