I have followed the directions provided at https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows and set up my system accordingly. I am working in a Jupyter notebook in a virtualenv environment, with `tensorflow-gpu` installed. I have installed CUDA 9.1 and cuDNN for CUDA 9.1, and `cuDNN64_7.dll` is accessible via the PATH variable. My computer features an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 with up-to-date drivers. Despite all of this, Tensorflow does not seem to recognize any usable GPU, as indicated by the output of `device_lib.list_local_devices()` and `K.tensorflow_backend._get_available_gpus()`. How can I debug this issue and determine the source of the problem?"

        "content": "When TensorFlow doesn't recognize your GPU, there are several steps you can take to diagnose and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify GPU Compatibility**: Ensure that your GPU (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780) is compatible with the versions of CUDA and cuDNN you have installed. The GTX 780 should work with CUDA 9.1, but double-check with the official TensorFlow and CUDA compatibility matrix to ensure compatibility with your setup.\n\n2. **Check CUDA and cuDNN Installation**:\n   - Make sure that CUDA is properly installed. You can check by running `nvcc --version` in the command line to confirm that it's correctly set up.\n   - Ensure that the cuDNN files are placed in the correct directories within the CUDA installation folder. This typically includes copying `cudnn64_7.dll` to the `bin` directory, `cudnn.lib` to the `lib` directory, and `cudnn.h` to the `include` directory.\n\n3. **Environment Variables**:\n   - Check that the environment variables are set correctly. Specifically, verify that `CUDA_HOME` and `PATH` include the paths to the CUDA and cuDNN directories.\n   - Example PATH variable entries might be: `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v9.1\\bin` and `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v9.1\\lib\\x64`.\n\n4. **TensorFlow Version**:\n   - Ensure that the version of `tensorflow-gpu` you have installed is compatible with CUDA 9.1. If you're using an older version of TensorFlow, it might not support CUDA 9.1.\n\n5. **Check TensorFlow Logs**:\n   - Run your code and check the logs for any error messages related to GPU initialization. TensorFlow may provide detailed information about what's going wrong.\n\n6. **Update Drivers**:\n   - Even if your drivers are up-to-date, consider reinstalling them to ensure that they are properly configured.\n\n7. **Test with a Simple Script**:\n   - Create a simple TensorFlow script to test GPU availability.\n     ```python\n     import tensorflow as tf\n     print(\"Num GPUs Available: \", len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')))\n     ```\n   - This can help determine if the issue is with your broader setup or just the specific project.\n\n8. **Verify Virtual Environment**:\n   - Ensure that your virtual environment is correctly configured and that you are activating it before running Jupyter Notebook.\n\n9. **Jupyter Notebook Configuration**:\n   - Sometimes, Jupyter Notebook might not use the virtualenv\u2019s Python interpreter. Ensure that the kernel in Jupyter Notebook is pointing to the correct virtual environment.\n\n10. **Consult Community and Documentation**:\n    - If the problem persists, consult the TensorFlow GitHub issues page or TensorFlow's community forums for any similar issues or solutions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify the source of the problem and get TensorFlow to recognize your GPU."
