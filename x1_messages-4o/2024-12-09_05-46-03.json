Here's how you can do it for your given array `A`:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nA = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 0]])\n\n# Find the index of the minimum value in the flattened array\nmin_index_flat = np.argmin(A)\n\n# Convert the flat index to a tuple of row and column indices\nmin_index_2d = np.unravel_index(min_index_flat, A.shape)\n\nprint(min_index_2d)\n```\n\nIn this code, `np.argmin(A)` returns the index of the minimum value in the flattened version of the array. `np.unravel_index` then converts this flat index into a tuple of row and column indices based on the shape of the array. For your example, it will output `(1, 1)` which corresponds to the minimum value `0` in the array."
