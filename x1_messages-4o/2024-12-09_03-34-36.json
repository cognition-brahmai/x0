Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport xlsxwriter\n\nworkbook = xlsxwriter.Workbook(\"file.xlsx\")\nworksheet1 = workbook.add_worksheet()\n\nworksheet1.write(1, 1,\"long text hidden test-1\" )\nworksheet1.write(2, 1,\"long text hidden test-2\")\nworksheet1.write(3, 1,\"short-1\")\nworksheet1.write(4, 1,\"short-2\")\nworksheet1.write(1, 2,\"Hello world\" )\nworksheet1.write(2, 2,\"Hello world\")\nworksheet1.write(3, 2,\"Hello world\")\nworksheet1.write(4, 2,\"Hello world\")\n\nworkbook.close()\n```\n\nBut the output I am getting is this:\n[Image - cells with hidden text]\n\nAnd what I am expecting is cells with adjusted widths like this:\n[Image - cells with adjusted widths]"

        "content": "To adjust the cell width in Excel using the `xlsxwriter` library in Python, you can use the `set_column` method. This method allows you to specify the width of one or more columns so that the text fits properly. You can set the width manually by trial and error or by using a formula to approximate the required width based on your text length.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to set the column widths:\n\n```python\nimport xlsxwriter\n\n# Create a new Excel workbook and add a worksheet\nworkbook = xlsxwriter.Workbook(\"file.xlsx\")\nworksheet1 = workbook.add_worksheet()\n\n# Set the width of column B (index 1) and column C (index 2) to fit the text\nworksheet1.set_column(1, 1, 25)  # You can adjust the width value as needed\nworksheet1.set_column(2, 2, 20)  # Set width for another column if needed\n\n# Write data to the worksheet\nworksheet1.write(1, 1, \"long text hidden test-1\")\nworksheet1.write(2, 1, \"long text hidden test-2\")\nworksheet1.write(3, 1, \"short-1\")\nworksheet1.write(4, 1, \"short-2\")\nworksheet1.write(1, 2, \"Hello world\")\nworksheet1.write(2, 2, \"Hello world\")\nworksheet1.write(3, 2, \"Hello world\")\nworksheet1.write(4, 2, \"Hello world\")\n\n# Close the workbook\nworkbook.close()\n```\n\nIn this code, `worksheet1.set_column(1, 1, 25)` sets the width of column B to 25 units, which should be enough to display your text without it being cut off. You may need to adjust the width value depending on the specific text you have in your cells. Similarly, you can set the width for other columns using the same method."
