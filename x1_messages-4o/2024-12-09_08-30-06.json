How can I fix this?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is due to the use of `sns.factorplot`, which has been deprecated since Seaborn version 0.9.0 and replaced with `sns.catplot`. The `mpl.rc(\"figure\", figsize=(45, 10))` call sets the default figure size for matplotlib plots, but it may not affect the size of `sns.factorplot` figures as expected.\n\nTo control the figure size in Seaborn's newer version, you should switch to using `sns.catplot` and use the `height` and `aspect` parameters to define the size. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\n%pylab inline\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Load your data\ntypessns = pd.read_csv('C:/data/testesns.csv', sep=';')\n\n# Use sns.catplot instead of sns.factorplot\nsns.catplot(x=\"MONTH\", y=\"VALUE\", hue=\"REGION\", data=typessns, kind=\"box\", palette=\"OrRd\",\n            height=10, aspect=4.5)  # This will give you a figure size equivalent to 45x10\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this updated code:\n- `height` controls the height of each facet (in inches).\n- `aspect` controls the width-to-height aspect ratio. In this example, `aspect=4.5` will create a plot that is 4.5 times wider than the specified `height`.\n\nThis should give you the larger figure size you're aiming for."
