        "content": "The `AttributeError` you're encountering typically suggests that there might be a naming conflict or a circular import issue. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Check for Naming Conflicts**:\n   - Make sure that your script file is not named `requests.py`. If it is, Python might be trying to import your script as the `requests` module. Rename your script to something else, like `check_my_pass.py`.\n\n2. **Check for Circular Imports**:\n   - Ensure that there are no circular imports in your code. A circular import occurs when two or more modules import each other directly or indirectly. In your case, ensure that `requests` is not importing anything from your script.\n\n3. **Check Your Environment**:\n   - Ensure that you haven't accidentally named another module or file in your project `requests.py`. This would cause a conflict with the actual `requests` library.\n\n4. **Reinstall the `requests` Library**:\n   - Sometimes, the library might not be installed correctly. Try reinstalling it using pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip uninstall requests\n     pip install requests\n     ```\n\n5. **Check for Other Issues**:\n   - If you have any other files in your project directory that could be conflicting with the `requests` module, make sure to rename them.\n\n6. **Verify Your Code**:\n   - Double-check your code to ensure that there are no typo errors or misconfigurations in the way you're importing and using the `requests` module.\n\nAfter making these changes, try running your script again. If the issue persists, feel free to share any additional details or code snippets that might help in diagnosing the problem further."
