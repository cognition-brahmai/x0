        "content": "Is it true that in Python 3.x, if an object has an `__eq__` method it is automatically unhashable, unlike in Python 2.x? I encountered this issue in Python 3.1 with the following code:\n\n```python\nclass O(object):\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return 'whatever'\no = O()\nd = {o: 0}\n```\nThis results in an error:\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<pyshell#16>\", line 1, in <module>\n    d = {o: 0}\nTypeError: unhashable type: 'O'\n```\nFollowing this, I have a personal issue that needs resolving. I have an object `ChangeTracker` which stores a `WeakKeyDictionary` that points to several objects, each object has the value of their pickle dump at a certain time point in the past. Whenever an existing object is checked in, the change tracker checks if its new pickle is identical to its old one, therefore indicating whether the object has changed in the meantime. Now, I can't even check if the given object is in the library, because it raises an exception about the object being unhashable due to it having a `__eq__` method. How can I work around this?"

        "content": "In Python 3.x, if you define an `__eq__` method but do not define a `__hash__` method, your object becomes unhashable by default. This is different from Python 2.x, where objects were hashable by default even if `__eq__` was defined, unless you explicitly made them unhashable.\n\nIn Python 3.x, if you want an object to be hashable and still define a custom `__eq__` method, you need to also provide a `__hash__` method. The rationale behind this change is to avoid accidental errors where the equality and hash contract is broken.\n\nHere's how you can modify your class to make instances hashable:\n\n```python\nclass O(object):\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return 'whatever'\n\n    def __hash__(self):\n        # Return a constant hash value or implement a hash based on your attributes\n        return hash('O')  # or return hash((self.attr1, self.attr2, ...)) for more complex objects\n\no = O()\nd = {o: 0}  # Now this should not raise an error\n```\n\nRegarding your `ChangeTracker` issue, you can similarly make sure that the objects you are tracking are hashable. If these objects are under your control, you might want to define a suitable `__hash__` method for them. If not, you can wrap these objects in another class that provides a hash implementation.\n\nHere's an example of how you could wrap an object:\n\n```python\nclass HashableWrapper:\n    def __init__(self, obj):\n        self.obj = obj\n\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return isinstance(other, HashableWrapper) and self.obj == other.obj\n\n    def __hash__(self):\n        return hash(self.obj)  # Assuming self.obj is hashable\n\n# Usage with ChangeTracker\nwrapper = HashableWrapper(some_object)\nchange_tracker.add(wrapper)\n```\n\nThis way, you can still track changes without running into the unhashable object issue."
