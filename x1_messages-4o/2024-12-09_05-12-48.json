        "content": "In Python, you can determine the number of currently running threads by using the `threading` module, which provides a convenient way to handle threads. The `threading.enumerate()` function returns a list of all alive `Thread` objects, and you can simply get the count of those threads using the `len()` function.\n\nHere's a simple example to illustrate how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport threading\nimport time\n\ndef worker():\n    \"\"\"Thread worker function\"\"\"\n    time.sleep(1)\n\n# Start a few threads\nthreads = []\nfor i in range(5):\n    t = threading.Thread(target=worker)\n    t.start()\n    threads.append(t)\n\n# Get the count of currently active (running) threads\nactive_threads_count = len(threading.enumerate())\nprint(f\"Number of currently running threads: {active_threads_count}\")\n\n# Wait for all threads to complete\nfor t in threads:\n    t.join()\n```\n\nIn this example, we create five threads that execute the `worker` function, which simply sleeps for one second. We then use `threading.enumerate()` to get a list of all active threads and determine its length to find out how many threads are currently running.\n\nKeep in mind that `threading.enumerate()` includes the main thread as well, so if you want to count only the non-main threads, you might need to subtract one from the count:\n\n```python\nnon_main_threads_count = len(threading.enumerate()) - 1\n```\n\nThis will give you the count of all threads excluding the main thread."
