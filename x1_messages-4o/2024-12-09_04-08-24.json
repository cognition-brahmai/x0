        "content": "I am relatively new to Python and I am currently learning how to use Django. I am using the `assertRaises` test to check for a `ValidationError` in my code, which is working fine. However, I have multiple `ValidationError`s in my code and I want to make sure that the correct one is returned. I thought of passing something into `assertRaises` but it seems like I can't. So, I decided to use `assertTrue` and check the exception message instead. However, I am having trouble accessing it. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nclass DailyEntriesTests(TestCase):\n    def test_cant_have_ip_and_user(self):\n        u = createUser(False)\n        de = createDailyEntry(u, \"1.1.1.1\", 1)\n        with self.assertRaises(ValidationError) as cm:\n            de.full_clean()\n\n        # this line bombs - message doesn't exist. I also tried \"error_code\" like I saw in the documentation, but that doesn't work\n        print(cm.exception.message)\n\n        self.assertTrue(cm.exception.message.contains(\"Both\"))\n```\n\nAs you can see, I am trying to print `cm.exception.message` but I am getting an error that the message does not exist. I also tried \"error_code\" as seen in the documentation, but that doesn't work either. Is this a good approach to solve this issue or is there a better way to do it?"

        "content": "When dealing with `ValidationError` in Django, the exception provides a `message_dict` or `messages` attribute rather than a single `message` attribute. Depending on how your validation error is structured, you can access these attributes to check the specific error messages.\n\nHere's how you can modify your test to correctly access the exception messages:\n\n```python\nclass DailyEntriesTests(TestCase):\n    def test_cant_have_ip_and_user(self):\n        u = createUser(False)\n        de = createDailyEntry(u, \"1.1.1.1\", 1)\n        with self.assertRaises(ValidationError) as cm:\n            de.full_clean()\n\n        # Access the messages attribute\n        error_messages = cm.exception.messages\n\n        # Print the error messages for debugging purposes\n        print(error_messages)\n\n        # Check if the specific message you expect is in the error messages\n        self.assertTrue(any(\"Both\" in message for message in error_messages))\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the changes:\n\n- **Access the `messages` Attribute**: If your `ValidationError` is a simple one, you can use `cm.exception.messages` to get a list of error messages. If it's a form or model validation error, it may contain a `message_dict`.\n\n- **Iterate Through Messages**: Use a list comprehension or any other iteration method to check if the specific substring is present in the messages. This gives you flexibility if the message isn't an exact match.\n\n- **Debugging**: Printing the exception messages can help you understand what is being returned and adjust your assertions accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that you are checking for the correct validation error, and it provides a robust way to handle multiple errors in a single validation operation."
