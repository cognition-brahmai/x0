        "content": "To find the number of possible combinations of 7 letters, you'll need to determine if you want to consider:\n\n1. **Permutations**, where the order of the letters matters.\n2. **Combinations**, where the order of the letters does not matter.\n\nSince you mentioned \"combinations,\" I'll assume you mean the second scenario where the order doesn't matter. However, we also need to know how many letters you're choosing from, as this impacts the calculation. Assuming you're choosing 7 letters from a set of 26 distinct letters (like the English alphabet), the number of combinations would be calculated as follows:\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from (26 for the alphabet).\n- \\( r \\) is the number of items to choose (7 in this case).\n\nUsing this formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{26}{7} = \\frac{26!}{7! \\times (26-7)!} = \\frac{26!}{7! \\times 19!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{26}{7} = \\frac{26 \\times 25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20}{7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 65780\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 65,780 possible combinations of 7 letters chosen from a set of 26 distinct letters."
