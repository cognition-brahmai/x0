However, I can guide you on how to structure the table and where to potentially find the data you need:\n\n### Structure of the Excel Table\n\n1. **Columns**: \n   - Year\n   - GDP (in trillions of USD)\n   - Information Technology Sector Growth (%)\n   - Worker Productivity Gains (%)\n   - Consumer Demand Growth (%)\n   - Government Investments in R&D (in billions of USD)\n   - Other Contributing Factors (qualitative data)\n\n2. **Rows**:\n   - Each row will represent a year from 1989 to 2019.\n\n### Steps to Create the Table\n\n1. **Collect GDP Data**: \n   - You can obtain historical U.S. GDP data from sources like the World Bank, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), or the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED).\n\n2. **Information Technology Sector Growth**:\n   - Research reports from technology industry groups or publications like Gartner, McKinsey, or industry-specific data from BEA.\n\n3. **Worker Productivity Gains**:\n   - Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides data on productivity gains.\n\n4. **Consumer Demand Growth**:\n   - Look for consumer spending reports from BEA or market research firms.\n\n5. **Government Investments in R&D**:\n   - National Science Foundation (NSF) and other governmental reports provide insights into R&D investments over the years.\n\n6. **Other Contributing Factors**:\n   - Qualitative data from economic studies, historical analyses, and economic publications can provide insights into factors like policy changes, global economic conditions, etc.\n\n### Example Entry:\n\n| Year | GDP (USD Trillions) | IT Sector Growth (%) | Productivity Gains (%) | Consumer Demand Growth (%) | Gov. R&D Investment (USD Billions) | Other Factors |\n|------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------|\n| 1989 | 5.7                  | 3.5                 | 1.8                    | 2.5                        | 50                                 | End of Cold War expansion |\n\n### Tips:\n\n- Make use of charts and graphs in Excel to visualize trends over the years.\n- Use pivot tables to analyze the data more dynamically.\n- Ensure data accuracy by cross-referencing multiple sources.\n\nBy following this framework, you should be able to construct a comprehensive table summarizing the growth of the U.S. economy from 1989 to 2019."
