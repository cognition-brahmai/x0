I also vaguely remember hearing that adding a dash to the end prevents someone from passing a command to your script, but I can't find any details on that. Is there any Bash shebang that is objectively better than the others for most use cases?"

        "content": "The shebang (`#!`) in a script specifies the interpreter that should be used to execute the script. For Bash scripting, there are a few common options, each with its own advantages:\n\n1. **`#!/bin/bash`**:\n   - This explicitly specifies the Bash shell located at `/bin/bash`.\n   - It is a good choice if you are certain that your script will only be run on systems where Bash is located at `/bin/bash` (such as many Linux distributions).\n   - It ensures that the script is executed with Bash, regardless of the user's default shell.\n\n2. **`#!/usr/bin/env bash`**:\n   - This uses the `env` command to find Bash in the user's `PATH`.\n   - It is more portable than `#!/bin/bash` because it does not assume the location of Bash.\n   - This is particularly useful on systems where Bash may not be located in `/bin`, such as some BSD variants or certain configurations of macOS.\n   - It is generally recommended for scripts that need to be portable across different UNIX-like systems.\n\n3. **`#!/bin/sh`**:\n   - Historically, `sh` referred to the Bourne shell, but on many modern systems, `/bin/sh` is a link to another shell (often Bash or Dash).\n   - If you use this shebang, your script should be POSIX-compliant and not rely on Bash-specific features.\n   - It's a good choice for scripts that need to run in a minimal or POSIX-compliant environment.\n\n4. **`#!/bin/sh -`**:\n   - The dash (`-`) is used to indicate the end of options for the interpreter.\n   - It can be used to ensure that no additional options are passed to the shell when executing the script.\n   - However, this does not prevent passing arguments to the script itself; it only affects how the shell interprets the script's execution options.\n\nRegarding security and preventing command injection, the use of `-` in the shebang line is not typically related to preventing command injection. Command injection vulnerabilities are usually a result of how input is handled within the script, not the shebang itself. To prevent such issues, you should always sanitize and validate any external input your script processes.\n\nIn summary, for most use cases, `#!/usr/bin/env bash` is recommended for portability, while `#!/bin/bash` is suitable for environments where you have control over the shell's location and want to ensure Bash-specific features are available. Always focus on writing secure code by handling user input safely, regardless of the shebang used."
