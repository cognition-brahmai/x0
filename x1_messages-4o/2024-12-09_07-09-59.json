The current implementation uses a one-liner if-else statement, but I would like to know if there's a way to make it cleaner by avoiding the `else` part. Here is my current code: \n\n```python\nnum1 = 10\nsomeBoolValue = True\nnum1 = 20 if someBoolValue else num1\n```\n\nI attempted to replace the `else` part with `pass` like so: `num1 = 20 if someBoolValue else pass`, but I encountered a syntax error. Is there a cleaner way to implement this logic?"

        "content": "In Python, the ternary conditional operator `x if condition else y` requires both the `if` and `else` parts to be present because it needs to know what value to assign in both cases. However, there are alternative ways to achieve this logic without explicitly using `else`.\n\nOne way is to directly assign the value based on the condition as shown below:\n\n```python\nnum1 = 10\nsomeBoolValue = True\n\nif someBoolValue:\n    num1 = 20\n```\n\nThis approach is straightforward and eliminates the need for an else clause since you're only interested in changing `num1` when `someBoolValue` is `True`.\n\nAnother approach is to use short-circuit evaluation with logical operators, but this is less common for assignment:\n\n```python\nnum1 = 10\nsomeBoolValue = True\n\nsomeBoolValue and (num1 := 20)\n```\n\nIn this example, `and` will evaluate the expression `num1 := 20` only if `someBoolValue` is `True`, effectively changing `num1` only when the condition is met.\n\nThese methods should help you achieve a cleaner implementation without explicitly needing an else clause."
