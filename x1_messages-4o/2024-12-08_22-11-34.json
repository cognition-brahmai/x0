        "content": "To achieve this task, you can create a Java program as follows. This program includes the `Tuple` class, which will store each bigram as a pair of words. The program will extract bigrams from the input text and ensure that each word in the bigram is no more than 5 characters long.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\n// Define Tuple class to store pairs of words\nclass Tuple {\n    private String first;\n    private String second;\n\n    public Tuple(String first, String second) {\n        this.first = first;\n        this.second = second;\n    }\n\n    public String getFirst() {\n        return first;\n    }\n\n    public String getSecond() {\n        return second;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"(\" + first + \", \" + second + \")\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class BigramsExtractor {\n\n    public static List<Tuple> extractBigrams(String text) {\n        String[] words = text.split(\" \");\n        List<Tuple> bigrams = new ArrayList<>();\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < words.length - 1; i++) {\n            if (words[i].length() <= 5 && words[i + 1].length() <= 5) {\n                Tuple tuple = new Tuple(words[i], words[i + 1]);\n                bigrams.add(tuple);\n            }\n        }\n\n        return bigrams;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String text = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\";\n        List<Tuple> result = extractBigrams(text);\n\n        // Print the list of bigrams\n        for (Tuple tuple : result) {\n            System.out.println(tuple);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Tuple Class**: This class is defined to hold a pair of words. It has two fields, `first` and `second`, along with a constructor to initialize these fields. The `toString` method is overridden for easy printing of tuples.\n\n2. **extractBigrams Method**: This method takes a string as input, splits it into words, and iterates through the words to form bigrams. It checks if both words in the bigram have a length of 5 or less before adding them to the list of bigrams.\n\n3. **Main Method**: This method demonstrates the use of the `extractBigrams` method by passing a sample text and printing the extracted bigrams.\n\nThis code will output the bigrams from the given text while ensuring each word in the bigram is limited to a maximum length of 5 characters."
