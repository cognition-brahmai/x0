        "content": "To derive a formula to calculate the mass and volume of an object given its density, you can start with the basic formula for density:\n\n\\[ \\text{Density} (\\rho) = \\frac{\\text{Mass} (m)}{\\text{Volume} (V)} \\]\n\nGiven the density \\(\\rho = 20 \\, \\text{kg/L}\\), you can rearrange this formula to solve for either mass or volume depending on what information you have:\n\n1. **To find Mass (m):**\n\n   \\[ m = \\rho \\times V \\]\n\n   This formula indicates that the mass is equal to the density multiplied by the volume.\n\n2. **To find Volume (V):**\n\n   \\[ V = \\frac{m}{\\rho} \\]\n\n   This formula indicates that the volume is equal to the mass divided by the density.\n\n### Example Calculation\n\nLet's calculate the mass and volume for an example scenario using the given density:\n\n#### Example 1: Calculate Mass\n\nSuppose you have an object with a volume of 5 liters (L). To find the mass:\n\n\\[ m = \\rho \\times V = 20 \\, \\text{kg/L} \\times 5 \\, \\text{L} = 100 \\, \\text{kg} \\]\n\nSo, the mass of the object is 100 kg.\n\n#### Example 2: Calculate Volume\n\nSuppose you have an object with a mass of 60 kilograms (kg). To find the volume:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{m}{\\rho} = \\frac{60 \\, \\text{kg}}{20 \\, \\text{kg/L}} = 3 \\, \\text{L} \\]\n\nSo, the volume of the object is 3 liters.\n\nThese formulas allow you to calculate either mass or volume when given the density and one of the other two variables."
