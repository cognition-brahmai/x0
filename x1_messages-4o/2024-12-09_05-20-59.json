        "content": "Certainly! The terms 'decision boundary' and 'optimal hyperplane' are related but have distinct meanings in the context of support vector machines (SVMs) and machine learning.\n\n1. **Decision Boundary**:\n   - A decision boundary is a general term used in classification problems to describe the surface that separates different classes. In a two-dimensional space, this is typically a line, but in higher dimensions, it becomes a hyperplane.\n   - The decision boundary is where the model decides to switch from predicting one class to another. It is essentially the threshold that distinguishes different classes in the feature space.\n\n2. **Optimal Hyperplane**:\n   - In the context of SVMs, the optimal hyperplane is a specific decision boundary that maximizes the margin between the classes. The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class, which are known as support vectors.\n   - The optimal hyperplane is the one that not only separates the classes but does so with the greatest possible margin. This is important because maximizing the margin tends to improve the generalization of the classifier to new data.\n\nIn summary, while both terms refer to the concept of separating classes, the decision boundary is a more general term that applies to any classification model, and the optimal hyperplane is specifically the decision boundary chosen by an SVM to maximize the margin between classes."
