Your task is to mix three of these liquids together to create a new compound with a unique color. However, the mixing process must follow a particular order to achieve the desired outcome. Here are some guidelines to help you solve the puzzle:\n1. Mixing A and D in any order will result in a red liquid.\n2. Mixing B and C in any order will result in a green liquid.\n3. Mixing C and E in any order will result in a blue liquid.\n4. Mixing D and F in any order will result in a yellow liquid.\nUsing these guidelines, can you figure out the correct order to mix the three liquids to produce a purple compound? Good luck!"

Let's break down the guidelines:\n\n1. Mixing A and D results in red.\n2. Mixing C and E results in blue.\n\nBy combining these findings, we can create purple by first mixing A and D to get red, and then adding the result to the mixture of C and E, which gives blue. The presence of both red and blue in the mixture will result in a purple compound.\n\nTherefore, the correct order to mix the three liquids to produce a purple compound is:\n1. Mix A and D to form red.\n2. Mix C and E to form blue.\n3. Combine the red mixture with the blue mixture to get purple."
