The query \"SELECT fooid FROM foo WHERE bar IN ('A','C')\" works perfectly fine from the MySQL command-line but doesn't return any rows when executed from Python. How should I modify my Python code to select those fooid's where bar is in ('A','C')? \n\nHere is the Python code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport MySQLdb\nimport config\nconnection=MySQLdb.connect(\n    host=config.HOST,user=config.USER,passwd=config.PASS,db='test')\ncursor=connection.cursor()\n\nsql='SELECT fooid FROM foo WHERE bar IN %s'\nargs=[['A','C']]\ncursor.execute(sql,args)\ndata=cursor.fetchall()\nprint(data)\n# ()\n```\n\nThe table structure looks like this:\n\n```mysql\nmysql&gt; SELECT * FROM foo;\n+-------+-----+\n| fooid | bar |\n+-------+-----+\n|     1 | A   | \n|     2 | B   | \n|     3 | C   | \n|     4 | D   | \n+-------+-----+\n4 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n```\n\nWhen I switch the roles of 'bar' and 'fooid' in the Python code, it works and successfully selects those 'bar's where 'fooid' is in (1,3). Also, when I enable the general query log, it looks like too many quotes are being placed around 'A' and 'C'. How can I use a parametrized query using the 'IN' SQL syntax or should I construct the SQL string manually?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is due to how the parameterization works with the `IN` clause in SQL. In your current code, you're passing a list within a list as an argument, which is not correctly being translated into the SQL query you intend to execute. MySQLdb doesn't automatically unpack the list into a format suitable for the `IN` clause.\n\nTo resolve this, you can construct the query string manually with placeholders for each item in your list and then pass the flattened list of arguments. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired result:\n\n```python\nimport MySQLdb\nimport config\n\nconnection = MySQLdb.connect(\n    host=config.HOST, user=config.USER, passwd=config.PASS, db='test')\ncursor = connection.cursor()\n\n# List of items for the IN clause\nbars = ['A', 'C']\n\n# Dynamically create placeholders for the number of items in bars\nplaceholders = ', '.join(['%s'] * len(bars))\n\n# Construct the SQL query with placeholders\nsql = f'SELECT fooid FROM foo WHERE bar IN ({placeholders})'\n\n# Execute the query with the flattened list of arguments\ncursor.execute(sql, bars)\ndata = cursor.fetchall()\n\nprint(data)\n\n# Close the cursor and connection\ncursor.close()\nconnection.close()\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Placeholders**: We dynamically generate a string of placeholders (`%s`) based on the number of items in your list.\n2. **Unpack the List**: We directly pass the list `bars` to `cursor.execute()`, which corresponds to the placeholders.\n\nThis approach ensures that your query is both secure (avoiding SQL injection) and correctly formatted for execution."
