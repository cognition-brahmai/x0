        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to a change in how Xcode's command line tools handle certain compiler flags. Specifically, the `-mno-fused-madd` flag is no longer recognized, which leads to the error during the installation of `psycopg2`.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. **Update Xcode and Command Line Tools**:\n   - Ensure that you have the latest version of Xcode and the Command Line Tools installed. You can update Xcode from the Mac App Store.\n   - After updating Xcode, open the Terminal and run:\n     ```bash\n     xcode-select --install\n     ```\n   - This will ensure you have the latest Command Line Tools.\n\n2. **Modify Environment Variables**:\n   - You can temporarily modify the environment to bypass the error by setting the following variable before running the installation command:\n     ```bash\n     export CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments\n     export CPPFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments\n     ```\n   - Then, try installing `psycopg2` again:\n     ```bash\n     pip install psycopg2\n     ```\n\n3. **Use a Binary Distribution**:\n   - If the issue persists, you can try installing a precompiled binary version of `psycopg2`. Use `psycopg2-binary` which is a stand-alone package that includes the compiled C extensions:\n     ```bash\n     pip install psycopg2-binary\n     ```\n\n4. **Alternative Compilers**:\n   - If you have Homebrew installed, you can try using an alternative version of GCC:\n     ```bash\n     brew install gcc\n     ```\n   - Then, set the appropriate compiler flags to use this version of GCC.\n\n5. **Create a Virtual Environment**:\n   - Sometimes, creating a new virtual environment can help resolve dependency issues:\n     ```bash\n     python -m venv myenv\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     pip install psycopg2\n     ```\n\nThese steps should help you bypass the error and successfully install the `psycopg2` package on your system."
