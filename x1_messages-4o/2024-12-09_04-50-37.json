Currently, when I try to initialize the client using the code `client = boto3.client('cloudfront')`, it defaults to using the default profile. I haven't found a way to specify a different profile in the official documentation."

        "content": "To specify a particular AWS profile when using the Boto3 library, you can make use of the `boto3.Session` object, which allows you to define the profile you want to use. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. First, ensure that your AWS credentials file (usually located at `~/.aws/credentials` on Linux and macOS, or `C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\.aws\\credentials` on Windows) contains the profile you want to use. It should look something like this:\n\n    ```ini\n    [default]\n    aws_access_key_id = YOUR_DEFAULT_ACCESS_KEY\n    aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_DEFAULT_SECRET_KEY\n\n    [myprofile]\n    aws_access_key_id = YOUR_OTHER_ACCESS_KEY\n    aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_OTHER_SECRET_KEY\n    ```\n\n2. Use the `boto3.Session` to specify the profile when creating the client. Here's an example:\n\n    ```python\n    import boto3\n\n    # Create a session using the specified profile\n    session = boto3.Session(profile_name='myprofile')\n\n    # Use this session to create a CloudFront client\n    client = session.client('cloudfront')\n\n    # Now you can use the client to interact with CloudFront\n    response = client.list_distributions()\n    print(response)\n    ```\n\n3. By using the `Session` object, you have more control over the AWS credentials and configuration, and you can easily switch between different profiles.\n\nThis approach should allow you to specify the profile you want to use when working with Boto3 and AWS resources."
