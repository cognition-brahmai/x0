I have an input list like this:\n\n```python\ninputs = [\"1, foo, bar\", \"2, tom, jerry\"]\n```\nand I want to achieve an output like this:\n\n```python\n[[1, \"foo\", \"bar\"], [2, \"tom\", \"jerry\"]]\n```\nWhen I try to split the string in a comprehension, I get the following output:\n\n```python\n[s.split(\",\") for s in inputs]\n# Output: [['1', ' foo', ' bar'], ['2', ' tom', ' jerry']]\n```\nHowever, I'm having difficulty figuring out how to access the columns after the string has been split inside the comprehension, because it seems to require a variable assignment. The following are not valid Python, but illustrate what I'm looking for:\n\n```python\n[[int(x), y.strip(), z.strip() for x,y,z = s.split(\",\")] for s in inputs]\n# or\n[[int(v[0]), v[1].strip(), v[2].strip() for v = s.split(\",\")] for s in inputs]\n```\nIs there a way to assign variables inside a comprehension so that the output can be composed of functions of the variables?"

        "content": "In Python, you cannot perform variable assignments directly within list comprehensions. However, you can achieve your desired output by using a nested list comprehension combined with a simple unpacking of the split results outside of the comprehension. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ninputs = [\"1, foo, bar\", \"2, tom, jerry\"]\n\n# Using a list comprehension with unpacking\noutput = [[int(x), y.strip(), z.strip()] for s in inputs for x, y, z in [s.split(\",\")]]\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\nLet's break down what's happening here:\n\n1. **Splitting**: For each string `s` in the `inputs` list, you split `s` by the comma `,` which results in a list like `['1', ' foo', ' bar']`.\n\n2. **Unpacking**: The `for x, y, z in [s.split(\",\")]` part uses a single-element list as an intermediate step to allow unpacking of the split result into variables `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n\n3. **List Comprehension**: You use these unpacked variables to construct the desired inner lists: `[int(x), y.strip(), z.strip()]`.\n\n4. **Stripping and Conversion**: `int(x)` converts the first element to an integer, and `y.strip()` and `z.strip()` remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the second and third elements.\n\nThe result is the list of lists you were looking for:\n\n```python\n[[1, \"foo\", \"bar\"], [2, \"tom\", \"jerry\"]]\n```"
