        "content": "The error you are encountering is likely due to a compatibility issue between the CUDA version and the compiler you are using. The error messages suggest that the template specialization syntax is not being interpreted correctly, which can happen if the compiler is not fully compatible with the CUDA toolkit version you are using.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Compiler Version**: Ensure that you are using a version of GCC that is compatible with CUDA 8.0. CUDA 8.0 supports GCC 4.8 and 5.x, but not newer versions. You can check your GCC version by running `gcc --version`.\n\n2. **Use the Correct GCC Version**: If you are using a newer version of GCC, you may need to install an older version and set it as the default for compiling CUDA code. You can do this by installing GCC 4.8 or 5.x and using the `update-alternatives` tool to switch versions.\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install gcc-4.8 g++-4.8\n   sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 50\n   sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8 50\n   ```\n\n3. **Modify the Makefile**: Ensure that the `Makefile` for Darknet is set to use the correct GPU architecture and paths. Also, make sure it points to the correct version of GCC.\n\n4. **CUDA Path and SYMLINKS**: Double-check that the symbolic links for CUDA are correctly set up in `/usr/local/cuda`. Sometimes, there can be issues if the symlinks are pointing to incorrect directories.\n\n5. **Reinstall CUDA Toolkit**: If the above steps do not resolve the issue, consider reinstalling the CUDA toolkit to ensure that there were no issues during the initial installation.\n\n6. **Check for Updates and Patches**: Sometimes, there are patches or updated versions of libraries that can resolve compatibility problems. Check the NVIDIA website or forums for any updates related to the CUDA version you are using.\n\n7. **Use a Newer Ubuntu Version (Optional)**: If possible, consider upgrading to a newer version of Ubuntu that might have better support for your specific setup. Though this is a more involved solution, it might save time in the long run.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue or at least narrow down the root cause. If the problem persists, consider seeking help from the NVIDIA Developer Forums or similar communities where others might have encountered and solved similar issues."
