Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\na = open(\"file\", \"r\")\nb = a.readline().strip()\na.close()\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you only want to remove the newline character specifically and not other whitespace, you can use `rstrip()` with `'\\n'` as an argument:\n\n```python\na = open(\"file\", \"r\")\nb = a.readline().rstrip('\\n')\na.close()\n```\n\nThis will ensure that the newline character is removed from the end of the line, while leaving other whitespace intact."
