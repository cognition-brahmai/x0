        "content": "The error you're encountering, `'pandas' object has no attribute 'DataFrame'`, suggests that there might be an issue with how the `pandas` library is being imported or used in your environment. Here are a few steps to help you troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check for Naming Conflicts**: Ensure that you don't have a file named `pandas.py` in your working directory, as this can shadow the actual `pandas` module.\n\n2. **Verify Installation**: Make sure that the `pandas` library is correctly installed. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n   ```bash\n   pip install pandas\n   ```\n\n3. **Importing `numpy`**: Your code uses `np.random.rand()` but does not import the `numpy` module. Make sure to import it at the beginning of your script:\n   ```python\n   import numpy as np\n   ```\n\n4. **Correct the Display Option**: The line `pd.options.display.mpl_style = 'default'` is incorrect. The `mpl_style` option was deprecated. If you're trying to use a specific style for plotting, consider using:\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n   plt.style.use('default')\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Other Programming Environment Issues**: Sometimes, certain IDEs or Jupyter notebooks might have issues if the kernel or console is not properly reset. Try restarting your IDE or Jupyter kernel.\n\nAfter addressing these points, your corrected code should look like this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Create the DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(12, 2), columns=['Apples', 'Oranges'])\ndf['Categories'] = pd.Series(list('AAAABBBBCCCC'))\n\n# Apply default plot style\nplt.style.use('default')\n\n# Boxplot\ndf.boxplot(by='Categories')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nRun the corrected code, and it should work without errors. If the problem persists, try running the script in a clean environment to ensure there are no other conflicting factors."
