I'm currently using this function to output a dictionary, and it seems to print out each item in alphabetical order based on the key. For example:\n\n```python\nd = {\"z\":0,\"y\":0,\"x\":0}\nyaml.dump( d, default_flow_style=False )\n# Outputs: 'x: 0\\ny: 0\\nz: 0\\n'\n```\n\nIn my particular case, printing in reverse would be sufficient, but for completeness, I'm also interested in a solution that gives more precise control over the order. I've tried using `collections.OrderedDict`, but PyYAML doesn't seem to support it. I've also considered subclassing `yaml.Dumper`, but I'm not sure if it has the ability to change item order."

        "content": "PyYAML does not maintain order of dictionary keys by default when dumping, as it converts dictionaries to a regular dictionary which does not preserve order. However, you can achieve the desired order output using a couple of different methods.\n\n### Method 1: Use `collections.OrderedDict`\n\nPyYAML can support ordering when you explicitly use `OrderedDict` from the `collections` module. Starting from Python 3.7, regular dictionaries maintain the insertion order as well. However, if you're using an older version of Python or want to ensure backward compatibility, you can use `OrderedDict`.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport yaml\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\nd = OrderedDict([(\"z\", 0), (\"y\", 0), (\"x\", 0)])\noutput = yaml.dump(d, default_flow_style=False)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis will maintain the order as specified in the `OrderedDict`.\n\n### Method 2: Custom YAML Dumper\n\nIf you need more precise control over the order, you can customize the YAML dumper to manipulate the order of keys. Here's an example of subclassing the dumper to reverse the order:\n\n```python\nimport yaml\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\nclass CustomDumper(yaml.SafeDumper):\n    def represent_dict(self, data):\n        return self.represent_mapping('tag:yaml.org,2002:map', data.items())\n\nCustomDumper.add_representer(OrderedDict, CustomDumper.represent_dict)\n\nd = OrderedDict([(\"z\", 0), (\"y\", 0), (\"x\", 0)])\n# Reverse order\nreversed_dict = OrderedDict(reversed(list(d.items())))\n\noutput = yaml.dump(reversed_dict, Dumper=CustomDumper, default_flow_style=False)\nprint(output)\n```\n\n### Method 3: Sorting Keys\n\nIf you want to sort keys in a specific order (other than the insertion order), you can sort them before creating the `OrderedDict`:\n\n```python\nimport yaml\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\nd = {\"z\": 0, \"y\": 0, \"x\": 0}\nsorted_items = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda item: item[0], reverse=True)  # Sort in reverse order\nordered_dict = OrderedDict(sorted_items)\n\noutput = yaml.dump(ordered_dict, default_flow_style=False)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThese methods should help you achieve control over the order of key/value pairs when dumping YAML using PyYAML."
