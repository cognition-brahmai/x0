When I use the following code: \n\n```python\nimport csv\nimport urllib.request\n\nurl = \"ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/file_list.csv\"\nftpstream = urllib.request.urlopen(url)\ncsvfile = csv.reader(ftpstream)\ndata = [row for row in csvfile]\n```\n\nI get the following error:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<pyshell#4>\", line 1, in <module>\ndata = [row for row in csvfile]\nFile \"<pyshell#4>\", line 1, in <listcomp>\ndata = [row for row in csvfile]\n_csv.Error: iterator should return strings, not bytes (did you open the file in text mode?)\n```\n\nI believe I should be working with strings not bytes. Can you help me solve this problem and explain what is going wrong?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is because the data read from the URL is in bytes, but the `csv.reader` expects the input to be in a string format. To solve this issue, you need to decode the bytes into a string before passing it to the `csv.reader`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to handle this:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nimport urllib.request\n\nurl = \"ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/file_list.csv\"\nftpstream = urllib.request.urlopen(url)\n\n# Decode the bytes to a string\ndecoded_stream = (line.decode('utf-8') for line in ftpstream)\n\n# Use the csv reader on the decoded string\ncsvfile = csv.reader(decoded_stream)\ndata = [row for row in csvfile]\n\n# Print the first few rows to check\nfor row in data[:5]:\n    print(row)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Decoding:** The line `decoded_stream = (line.decode('utf-8') for line in ftpstream)` converts each line from bytes to a string using UTF-8 encoding. This is necessary because the `csv.reader` expects input as a string.\n- **Generator Expression:** The expression `(line.decode('utf-8') for line in ftpstream)` is a generator expression that lazily decodes each line as you iterate over `ftpstream`, which is more memory efficient especially for large files.\n\nThis should resolve the error and allow you to read the CSV data correctly."
