        "content": "In shell commands, the `&&` operator is used to chain commands together, executing them sequentially with a condition: the next command executes only if the previous command is successful. In other words, `command1 && command2` means \"execute `command2` only if `command1` succeeds (returns an exit status of 0).\"\n\nHere's an example to illustrate its use:\n\n```bash\nmkdir new_directory && cd new_directory\n```\n\nIn this example, the `cd new_directory` command will only be executed if `mkdir new_directory` successfully creates the directory. If `mkdir` fails (for example, if the directory already exists), `cd` will not be executed.\n\nThis is particularly useful for ensuring that subsequent commands are only run when prior commands complete successfully, helping to prevent errors and ensure that your script or command sequence runs smoothly."
