        "content": "In Python 3, the `md5` functionality is available as part of the `hashlib` module. You don't need a separate module for MD5 hashing. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\n# Create an md5 hash object\nmd5_hash = hashlib.md5()\n\n# Update the hash object with the data you want to hash\nmd5_hash.update(b\"your data here\")\n\n# Get the hexadecimal representation of the hash\nhash_result = md5_hash.hexdigest()\n\nprint(hash_result)\n```\n\nIf you are looking for a more secure hash function to replace MD5, consider using SHA-256, which is also available in the `hashlib` module:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\n# Create a SHA-256 hash object\nsha256_hash = hashlib.sha256()\n\n# Update the hash object with the data you want to hash\nsha256_hash.update(b\"your data here\")\n\n# Get the hexadecimal representation of the hash\nhash_result = sha256_hash.hexdigest()\n\nprint(hash_result)\n```\n\nSHA-256 is generally recommended over MD5 for cryptographic purposes due to its improved security."
